AHA SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT
Atrial Fibrillation Burden: Moving Beyond 
Atrial Fibrillation as a Binary Entity
A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
Circulation
http://circ.ahajournals.org
ABSTRACT: Our understanding of the risk factors and complications 
of atrial fibrillation (AF) is based mostly on studies that have evaluated 
AF in a binary fashion (present or absent) and have not investigated 
AF burden. This scientific statement discusses the published literature 
and knowledge gaps related to methods of defining and measuring AF 
burden, the relationship of AF burden to cardiovascular and neurological 
outcomes, and the effect of lifestyle and risk factor modification on AF 
burden. Many studies examine outcomes by AF burden classified by 
AF type (paroxysmal versus nonparoxysmal); however, quantitatively, 
AF burden can be defined by longest duration, number of AF episodes 
during a monitoring period, and the proportion of time an individual is 
in AF during a monitoring period (expressed as a percentage). Current 
guidelines make identical recommendations for anticoagulation regardless 
of AF pattern or burden; however, a review of recent evidence suggests 
that higher AF burden is associated with higher risk of stroke. It is unclear 
whether the risk increases continuously or whether a threshold exists; 
if a threshold exists, it has not been defined. Higher burden of AF is 
also associated with higher prevalence and incidence of heart failure 
and higher risk of mortality, but not necessarily lower quality of life. A 
structured and comprehensive risk factor management program targeting 
risk factors, weight loss, and maintenance of a healthy weight appears to 
be effective in reducing AF burden. Despite this growing understanding of 
AF burden, research is needed into validation of definitions and measures 
of AF burden, determination of the threshold of AF burden that results in 
an increased risk of stroke that warrants anticoagulation, and discovery 
of the mechanisms underlying the weak temporal correlations of AF and 
stroke. Moreover, developments in monitoring technologies will likely 
change the landscape of long-term AF monitoring and could allow better 
definition of the significance of changes in AF burden over time.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
A
trial fibrillation (AF) is a serious public health 
problem because of its increasing incidence and 
prevalence in the aging population1 and its as-
sociation with elevated risks of cardiovascular events 
and death.2–7 Our understanding of the risk factors and 
complications of AF is based mostly on studies that 
have evaluated AF in a binary fashion (present or ab-
sent) and have not investigated AF burden (quantity or 
amount of AF that a person has). The optimal method 
of measuring AF burden, the prognostic significance of 
AF type (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent)8 or AF 
duration, and the relationship of lifestyle and intensive 
risk factor modification to AF burden are all important 
knowledge gaps that require clarification. This scientific 
statement comprehensively discusses the published lit-
erature and knowledge gaps related to (1) methods of 
defining and measuring AF burden, (2) relationship of 
AF type or device-detected AF duration to cardiovas-
cular and neurological outcomes, and (3) effect of life-
style and risk factor modification on AF burden. We will 
also propose future directions for research to address 
knowledge gaps.
It is not the goal of this scientific statement to pro-
vide specific formal clinical recommendations. Instead, 
the general goal of this scientific statement is to in-
crease knowledge and awareness by healthcare pro-
fessionals of effective, state-of-the-art science related 
to the causes, prevention, detection, management, 
and future research needs related to AF burden. The 
information presented here represents the synthesis 
of data and a consensus of experts convened on the 
writing committee. Members of the writing committee 
performed detailed literature searches using PubMed, 
Web of Science, and Scopus to identify relevant origi-
nal articles, guideline statements, and review articles in 
the literature. We restricted literature searches to ar-
ticles published in English from the year 2000 and later. 
Search terms included but were not limited to atrial fi-
brillation, atrial fibrillation burden, atrial fibrillation fre-
quency, atrial fibrillation duration, atrial fibrillation type 
or pattern, device-detected atrial fibrillation, device-
detected atrial tachyarrhythmias, pacemaker-detected 
atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, pacemaker-de-
tected atrial tachyarrhythmias, atrial high-rate episodes, 
subclinical atrial fibrillation, silent atrial fibrillation, and 
subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias. The document was 
peer reviewed by official external reviewers represent-
ing experts in population-based, clinical, and transla-
tional research on AF.
DEFINITION OF AF BURDEN
In the simplest sense, AF burden refers to the amount 
of AF that an individual has. By considering AF bur-
den, we regard AF as a quantitative entity and move 
beyond merely treating AF as a binary condition (pres-
ence or absence of AF). There are many ways one can 
define AF burden, such as the duration of the longest 
AF episode or number of AF episodes during a certain 
monitoring period. Intuitively, the best definition for AF 
burden is the proportion of time an individual is in AF 
during a monitoring period, expressed as a percentage. 
Literature on AF burden using the latter definition is 
sparse simply because continuous ambulatory monitor-
ing would be required to meet this definition. Conse-
quently, the majority of studies that have addressed AF 
burden have mostly focused on AF type or pattern (par-
oxysmal, persistent, and permanent)8 or device-detect-
ed AF duration as measured from cardiac implantable 
electronic devices (CIEDs).
AF PATTERN OR TYPE AND RISK OF 
STROKE
Although one would expect that AF burden should be 
directly proportional to stroke risk, current guidelines 
recommend assessing stroke risk on the basis of the 
individual patient risk profile, not on AF type, pattern, 
or burden. The approach to risk stratification has been 
constrained by the fact that the decision to anticoagu-
late is binary (we prescribe an oral anticoagulant [OAC], 
or we do not), and risks attributable to patient char-
acteristics (those included in the CHA2DS2-VASc score, 
for instance) have been thought to overwhelm the risk 
attributable to AF pattern. On its own, a particular AF 
pattern is unlikely to spare high-risk patients from anti-
coagulation or warrant OAC use for low-risk patients. 
Nonetheless, understanding the relationship between 
AF pattern and stroke risk might yield some pathophysi-
ological insight into this disease process and motivate 
further investigation in stroke prevention.
Clinical Trials (OACs)
Current practice guidelines make identical recommen-
dations for anticoagulation regardless of AF pattern; 
however, the large, heterogeneous prospective trials in 
the direct OAC era have afforded an opportunity to re-
visit this paradigm. Post hoc analyses of the ARISTOTLE 
(Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Throm-
boembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), ENGAGE-AF (Ef-
fective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Genera-
tion in Atrial Fibrillation), and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban 
Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared 
With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke 
and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trials have all 
shown consistently lower stroke rates for patients with 
paroxysmal AF than for those with persistent AF, even 
after adjustment for baseline characteristics (ARISTO-
TLE: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.51–0.93], P=0.0159; ROCKET: adjusted

HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63–1.0], P=0.04810; and ENGAGE-
AF: adjusted HR, 0.79; P=0.01511). In the RE-LY trial 
(Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation 
Therapy), the stroke rates were numerically lower in 
paroxysmal versus persistent AF (1.32% versus 1.55%, 
respectively), but no formal adjusted comparisons were 
made, and patients with paroxysmal AF tended to have 
lower CHADS2 scores.12
Older data on anticoagulated patients in SPORTIF 
(Stroke Prevention Using Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial 
Fibrillation) III and V (randomized to either vitamin K an-
tagonist or ximelagatran) demonstrated an annual stroke/
systemic embolic event rate of 1.73% for persistent AF 
and 0.93% for paroxysmal AF (adjusted HR, 1.87 [95% 
CI, 1.04–3.36]; P=0.037 for persistent versus paroxysmal 
AF).13 Similarly, the AMADEUS trial (Evaluating the Use 
of SR34006 Compared to Warfarin or Acenocoumarol 
in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) demonstrated higher 
rates of a composite of cardiovascular death and stroke 
or systemic embolism among anticoagulated patients 
with nonparoxysmal AF (HR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.08–2.55]; 
P=0.02).14 However, SPORTIF III and V demonstrated sim-
ilar stroke rates in patients with at least 2 risk factors for 
stroke, which suggests that at the higher end of the risk 
spectrum, the paroxysmal AF pattern is not associated 
with significantly lower stroke risk.
Clinical Trials (Antiplatelet Agents)
Although antiplatelet therapy currently plays only a 
very small role in the prevention of stroke in AF, a reex-
amination of studies involving antiplatelet therapy can 
shed some light on the relationship between AF pat-
tern and stroke in patients who have not undergone 
anticoagulation. Analyses of aspirin-treated patients 
in the ACTIVE-A (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial 
With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) and 
 
AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to 
Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have 
Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treat-
ment) trials suggest that the pattern of AF is related to 
stroke risk among patients who have not undergone 
anticoagulation.15 This study demonstrated yearly isch-
emic stroke rates of 2.1%, 3.0%, and 4.2% for parox-
ysmal, persistent, and permanent AF, respectively, with 
an adjusted HR of 1.83 (P<0.001) for permanent versus 
paroxysmal AF and 1.44 (P=0.02) for persistent versus 
paroxysmal AF.15
Conversely, analysis of aspirin-treated patients in the 
SPAF trial (Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation) dem-
onstrated a comparable annualized rate of ischemic 
stroke in those with intermittent (3.2%) and sustained 
(3.3%) AF.16 Similarly, analysis of the ACTIVE-W study, 
which examined patients being treated with combined 
antiplatelet therapy or OACs, demonstrated a similar 
annualized risk of stroke or systemic embolism in parox-
ysmal AF and sustained AF (adjusted relative risk, 0.94 
[95% CI, 0.63–1.40]; P=0.755).17 These mixed data 
suggest that the differences in stroke rate by AF pat-
tern could be less consistent in a population not treated 
with OAC; however, these studies were comparatively 
small, including only 460 patients with paroxysmal AF 
in SPAF and 1202 patients in ACTIVE-W, and might 
be less representative of contemporary practice out-
comes. Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients 
with persistent AF were randomized to warfarin rather 
than combination antiplatelet therapy in ACTIVE-W 
(65% for paroxysmal AF versus 85% for sustained AF, 
P=0.0001), which could have attenuated some differ-
ence attributable to the underlying AF pattern.
AF Registries
Data from AF registries and population-based studies 
are also mixed. This likely speaks to the complexity in risk 
adjustment between AF type and differential treatment 
patterns (eg, anticoagulation rate), which confounds 
the relationship between AF type and stroke risk. It is 
well established that patient characteristics differ signifi-
cantly by AF type, generally trending toward higher-risk 
features in persistent AF,18,19 which makes rigorous ad-
justment critical for all epidemiological studies.
In the Loire Valley Atrial Fibrillation Project AF cohort, 
the rates of stroke differed significantly by pattern of AF; 
however, clinical factors, not AF pattern, independently 
increased the risk of stroke in multivariate analyses.20 
On the basis of this finding, the authors concluded that 
stroke risk is similar across all patterns of AF and that 
antithrombotic therapy should be based on clinical risk 
factors, not on AF pattern. Similarly, both the EORP-AF 
(EURObservational Research Programme–Atrial Fibrilla-
tion) General Pilot Registry and the J-RHYTHM (Japa-
nese Rhythm Management Trial for Atrial Fibrillation) 
Registry demonstrated higher death rates with nonpar-
oxysmal AF; however, in the multivariable Cox model, 
nonparoxysmal AF was not an independent predictor 
of death during follow-up.21,22 In the Euro Heart Survey, 
paroxysmal AF had comparable risk for thromboembol-
ic events as persistent and permanent AF.23,24
Conversely, in a large cohort of Japanese patients 
(Fushimi AF Registry), paroxysmal AF was indepen-
dently associated with lower incidence of stroke/sys-
temic embolism than sustained AF.25 Also, a second-
ary prevention study demonstrated a nearly 2-fold 
increased risk of stroke with persistent AF, even after 
adjustment for age, sex, previous anticoagulation, and 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale severity of 
the index event.26 Finally, a meta-analysis of 12 studies 
(nearly 100 000 patients) demonstrated a multivari-
able adjusted HR for thromboembolism of 1.38 (95% 
CI, 1.19–1.61) for nonparoxysmal AF compared with 
paroxysmal AF.27

AND GUIDELINES
Impact on Stroke Severity
One study demonstrated more severe neurological defi-
cits and poorer outcomes in patients with persistent AF 
(versus paroxysmal AF) who have had a cardioembolic 
stroke.28–30 Patients with persistent AF might also be 
at higher risk of a recurrent stroke.26,31 However, per-
haps because of its higher prevalence than persistent 
AF and the fact that many patients with paroxysmal AF 
are not treated with anticoagulation,32,33 paroxysmal AF 
remains the most common AF pattern among all pa-
tients presenting with acute stroke.34 Table 1 presents 
a list of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
outcomes according to AF pattern.
Conclusions
• Current guidelines recommend using vascular risk 
factors (as measured by the CHA2DS2-VASc score) 
and not considering AF burden when making deci-
sions regarding anticoagulation for stroke preven-
tion in AF.
• The strongest evidence, however, suggests that 
patients with persistent AF are at higher risk of 
stroke than those with paroxysmal AF.
− This relationship holds among contemporary 
patients treated with appropriate anticoagulation:
▪ Post hoc analyses of the ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE- 
AF, and ROCKET-AF trials have all shown con-
sistently lower stroke rates for patients with 
paroxysmal than for persistent AF, even after 
adjustment for baseline characteristics.
− The relationship is also present in patients not 
treated with anticoagulation:
▪ Analyses of aspirin-treated patients in the 
ACTIVE-A and AVERROES trials showed 
higher stroke risk in persistent and permanent 
AF than in paroxysmal AF.
▪ However, older studies (SPAF and ACTIVE-W) 
did not demonstrate this relationship, but 
these studies might be comparatively under-
powered and potentially less representative of 
contemporary practice outcomes.
− Data from AF registries and population-based 
studies are also mixed, but the largest meta-
analysis (12 studies and nearly 100 
000 patients) 
demonstrated an HR of 1.38 for nonparoxysmal 
AF compared with paroxysmal AF (Table 1). 
DEVICE-DETECTED AF DURATION AND 
STROKE RISK
Patients with CIEDs are at particularly high risk of 
AF,35 likely related to the high prevalence of underly-
ing cardiac pathology such as sinus node dysfunction 
and cardiomyopathy, which predispose to AF. Unlike 
ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring devices 
of specific intervals (1 day to 4 weeks), CIEDs provide 
full-time continuous monitoring of atrial and ventricular 
arrhythmias. In devices with atrial leads, cumulative AF 
burden is tracked, and individual atrial arrhythmias can 
be stored by the device by autotriggered alerts. A full 
array of diagnostic information is available, including 
date, time, duration, and atrial arrhythmia cycle length, 
as well as day-level AF burden. Because many implant-
able cardioverter-defibrillators implanted for primary 
prevention of sudden death are single-chamber devices 
(with only a ventricular lead), newer technologies have 
emerged to allow for AF detection based on R-R cycle 
length irregularity with conventional leads.36
Caution is needed in interpreting device-detected AF 
and using atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) as a surro-
gate for AF. False detection of AF can occur because 
of far-field R-wave oversensing by the atrial lead or 
sustained runs of premature atrial complexes or atrial 
tachycardia. Implantable loop recorders or implantable 
cardiac monitors, which rely on R-R intervals for arrhyth-
mia detection, have lower sensitivity and specificity for 
AF identification than limb-lead–based ambulatory elec-
trocardiography monitors and CIEDs with atrial leads.37 
Newer-generation algorithms, although improved, are 
still dependent on the background incidence rate of the 
monitored population, programmed sensitivity, and the 
duration of detected AF episodes.38 AF can be missed 
by transvenous lead CIEDs if episodes of AF are very 
brief or slow. In the ASSERT trial (Asymptomatic Stroke 
and Atrial Fibrillation Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients 
and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial), 
17.3% of AHREs at >190 bpm that lasted >6 minutes 
were found to be false positive for AF.39 Nevertheless, 
given the continuous monitoring for long periods of 
time, CIEDs afford a potential opportunity to examine 
the relationship between AF burden and risk of stroke, 
both for estimating risk of stroke and for the expected 
benefit of stroke prevention therapy. Studies have gen-
erally shown that higher AF burden is associated with a 
higher risk of stroke; however, thresholds have not been 
reproducibly identified. Confounding the observation is 
that patients with higher AF burden also tend to have a 
higher prevalence of other conditions that increase risk 
of stroke, such as advanced age or heart failure (HF).
In studies that evaluate risk based on AF duration, 
the cut points were generally arbitrarily prespecified 
rather than empirically derived. In a secondary analy-
sis of the MOST trial (Mode Selection Trial) of 316 pa-
tients with sinus node dysfunction and dual-chamber 
pacemakers, an AHRE (atrial rate >220 bpm) cutoff of 5 
minutes was chosen to avoid false-positive results from 
oversensing.40,41 Presence of 5-minute AHREs was as-
sociated with increased risk of death or nonfatal stroke 
(HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.51–5.15; P=0.0011) and of AF.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
This study was limited by its small size, retrospective 
design, and the fact that only AHREs that lasted >5 
minutes were considered; thus, the prognostic signifi-
cance of shorter episodes or much longer episodes (eg, 
hours) was not evaluated. The TRENDS study (A Pro-
spective Study of the Clinical Significance of Atrial 
Arrhythmias Detected by Implanted Device Diagnostics) 
was a prospective, observational study of 2846 patients 
with CIEDs and risk factors for stroke.42 In TRENDS, 
compared with no atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs)/AF, the 
stroke risk was doubled in those with high AT/AF bur-
den (≥5.5 hours on any single day in a 30-day window) 
but not in those with low AT/AF burden (<5.5 hours on 
any single day in a 30-day window), which suggests 
that stroke risk is a quantitative function of AT/AF bur-
den. The 5.5-hour threshold was chosen as the cutoff 
because it was the median AT/AF burden and not an 
empirical threshold of risk.
In ASSERT, subclinical episodes of AT (defined as 
atrial rates ≥190 bpm lasting >6 minutes) were associ-
ated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (HR, 1.76; 
95% CI, 0.99–3.11).43 The cutoff of 6 minutes was pre-
specified. The increase in risk was similar for episodes 
>6 hours (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.13–3.55). A follow-up 
analysis demonstrated that subclinical AT only increased 
the risk of stroke or systemic embolism for episodes 
>24 hours (adjusted HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.51–6.95)44 
and that risk of stroke in patients with subclinical AT 
between 6 minutes and 6 hours (adjusted HR, 0.75; 
95% CI, 0.29–1.96) and between 6 hours and 24 hours 
(adjusted HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.40–4.37) was not signifi-
cantly different from that for patients without subclini-
cal AT. Cutoffs were based on manufacturer categories 
for classification of subclinical AT.
To evaluate further whether AF burden correlates 
with stroke risk, the SOS AF project (Stroke Preven-
tion Strategies Based on Atrial Fibrillation Information 
From Implanted Devices) performed a pooled analysis 
of individual patient data from 5 prospective studies 
comprising 10 
016 patients without permanent AF and 
previously implanted with CIEDs.45 The annual stroke 
risk for different categories of AF burden (0 to <5 min-
utes, ≥5 minutes to <1 hour, ≥1 hour to <6 hours, ≥6 
hours to <12 hours, ≥12 hours to <23 hours, and ≥23 
hours) was 0.24%, 0.08%, 0.34%, 0.26%, 0.30%, 
and 0.23%, respectively.
In a case-crossover analysis involving 9850 patients 
with CIEDs remotely monitored in the Veterans Admin-
istration Health Care System between 2002 and 2012, 
Turakhia and colleagues46 found that AF burden of ≥5.5 
hours in a given day raised the short-term risk of stroke 
4- to 5-fold. Moreover, they found a strong relationship 
of temporal proximity of AF with ischemic stroke: the risk 
was highest in the 5 to 10 days after the episode of AF; 
by 30 days, the risk of stroke events was no longer ele-
vated. The cutoff of 5.5 hours was based on the previous 
TRENDS study.42 When the AF cutoff was changed from 
30 minutes to 6 hours in increments, there was no risk 
threshold identified. Finally, the majority of strokes that 
occurred were temporally dissociated from AF. Therefore, 
although a transient increase in risk based on AF onset 
was identified, the overall attributable risk was low.
Table 2 presents a list of studies of CIEDs evaluating 
the association of AF burden and risk of stroke.
Conclusions
• In virtually all studies, cutoffs for AF burden were 
arbitrarily prespecified rather than empirically 
derived.
• The effect of very brief AF episodes (<5 to 6 minutes) 
 
on stroke risk has not been rigorously evaluated 
and remains unknown.
• Although increasing AF burden is generally asso-
ciated with an increasing risk of stroke, the rela-
tionship is not well characterized with respect to 
functional form (eg, threshold or monotonicity) or 
duration of any transient risk.
• Among patients with CIEDs, the majority of isch-
emic strokes are temporally discordant from AF 
episodes.
• AHREs in MOST40 and AT/AF in TRENDS42 and 
ASSERT43 might have included atrial flutter. It is 
unclear whether the ischemic stroke risk of atrial 
flutter is the same as that of AF. As such, some cau-
tion is needed in interpreting AF burden–related 
ischemic stroke risk from these studies (Table 2).
AF TYPE, AF DURATION, AND 
NONSTROKE OUTCOMES
Nonstroke outcomes of AF that have been described 
include HF,3 cognitive impairment and dementia,52 myo-
cardial infarction,6,7 chronic kidney disease progression 
to end-stage renal disease,53,54 sudden cardiac death,5 
and all-cause death.4 Whereas a clear association exists 
between AF and cardioembolic stroke, the relationships 
between AF and other cardiac and noncardiac out-
comes, quality of life, and death are more complex. As 
such, inferring directional relationships between AF and 
most nonstroke outcomes is treacherous. Despite these 
challenges, understanding the correlations between AF 
type and AF duration with nonstroke outcomes pro-
vides additional prognostic information regarding AF 
burden. However, the data are scarce in this area.
Heart Failure
HF and AF are highly concordant. They represent over-
lapping epidemics, with AF occurring in more than half 
of individuals with HF and HF occurring in more than

Safety end point (if relevant): ISTH major 
bleeding
Secondary efficacy 
end point was all-
cause mortality
There was a consistent reduction in 
stroke or systemic embolism (P for 
interaction=0.71), all-cause mortality 
(P for interaction=0.75), and major 
bleeding (P for interaction=0.50) with 
apixaban compared with warfarin for 
both AF types. Apixaban was superior 
to warfarin in all studied end points, 
regardless of AF duration at study entry 
(P for all interactions=0.13).
Rate of stroke or systemic embolism 
was significantly higher in patients with 
persistent or permanent AF than in 
patients with paroxysmal AF (1.52 vs 
0.98%; P=0.003, adjusted P=0.015). 
There was also a trend toward higher 
mortality in patients with persistent 
or permanent AF (3.90 vs 2.81%; 
P=0.0002, adjusted P=0.066). 
Analyses comparing outcomes by AF 
pattern adjusted for age; sex; region; prior 
myocardial infarction; HF; prior stroke; TIA 
or systemic embolism; DM; hypertension; 
prior clinically relevant or spontaneous 
bleeding; time from first documented 
occurrence of AF to randomization (ie, 
duration of AF); whether a VKA was used 
before enrollment; vascular disease; and 
baseline use of aspirin, statins, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor blockers, and amiodarone
Primary end point: Stroke or systemic 
embolism
Safety end point: Major bleeding
All-cause mortality
Patients with persistent AF had higher 
adjusted rates of stroke or systemic 
embolism (2.18 vs 1.73 events per 100 
patient-years, P=0.048) and all-cause 
mortality (4.78 vs 3.52, P=0.006). Rates 
of major bleeding were similar (3.55 
vs 3.31, P=0.77). Rates of stroke or 
systemic embolism in both types of AF 
did not differ by treatment assignment 
(rivaroxaban vs warfarin, P for 
interaction=0.6).
Efficacy end point models were adjusted 
for the following: age, sex, BMI, region, 
DM, prior stroke/TIA, vascular disease, 
myocardial infarction, peripheral artery 
disease, carotid occlusive disease, 
CHF, hypertension, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, DBP
, creatinine 
clearance, heart rate, and abstinence from 
alcohol.
Safety end point models were adjusted for 
the following: prior stroke/TIA; anemia; 
prior gastrointestinal bleed; chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease; DBP; 
creatinine clearance; platelets; albumin; 
and prior aspirin, VKA, or thienopyridine 
use.
Primary end point: Stroke/SEE
Safety end point: Major bleeding
All-cause mortality
Primary end point of stroke/SEE was 
lower in patients with paroxysmal AF 
(1.49% per y) than in persistent AF 
(1.83% per y; adjusted P=0.015) and 
permanent AF (1.95% per y; adjusted 
P=0.004)
Analyses by AF pattern were adjusted for 
sex, age, race, geographic region, BMI, 
smoking status, alcohol use, prior stroke 
or TIA, hypertension, CAD, dyslipidemia, 
CHF, DM, increased risk of falling, hepatic 
disease, neuropsychiatric disease, prior 
nonintracranial bleed, use of antiplatelet 
agents at randomization, and creatinine 
clearance at randomization.
Primary end point: Composite of 
cardiovascular death and stroke or systemic 
embolism
Safety end point: Major bleeding, defined 
as bleeding that was fatal, intracranial, or 
affecting another critical anatomic site, or 
overt bleeding with a drop in hemoglobin 
≥20 g/L or requiring transfusion of ≥2 U of 
erythrocytes
 
HR (for primary outcome) for permanent 
vs nonpermanent AF was 1.68 (95% CI, 
1.08–2.55; P=0.02)
Multivariate model included adjustment 
for age, sex, creatinine (log transformed), 
hypertension, DM, and previous stroke/TIA/
thromboembolism, and CAD
Primary end point: Stroke and SEEs
Safety end point: Major bleeding
Mortality
Annual event rates for stroke ⁄SEE were 
1.73% for persistent AF and 0.93% for 
paroxysmal AF. In multivariate analysis, 
after adjustment for stroke risk factors, 
sex, and aspirin usage, differences 
remained statistically significant, with 
higher HR for stroke/SEE in persistent AF 
(vs paroxysmal AF: HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 
1.04–3.36; P=0.037).
Adjustment was performed for 7 
predefined risk factors from clinical study 
protocol: previous stroke, TIA, or systemic 
embolism; hypertension; LVD (EF <40% or

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Chen et al 
Atrial Fibrillation Burden
one third of individuals with AF.55 The incidence of HF 
is ≈2-fold greater than the incidence of stroke in pa-
tients with AF. AF is known to promote symptomatic 
HF through multiple mechanisms and vice versa.56 It is 
unknown to what extent AF drives subsequent HF (eg, 
tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy and loss of atrio-
ventricular synchrony) versus AF merely manifesting be-
fore HF from common underlying pathophysiology (eg, 
primary myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptosis 
leading to neurohormonal activation, electrical abnor-
malities, and elevated filling pressures). AF and HF, as 
well as downstream morbidity and mortality, share com-
mon risk factors: obesity, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, 
hypertension, prior myocardial infarction, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease, and renal disease.
The data are scarce on the relationship of burden 
and type of AF to incident HF. In a contemporary Ameri-
can registry of AF, incident HF developed in 3.6% of pa-
tients over the 2-year follow-up period (ejection fraction 
was >40% in 64%, ≤40% in 13.5%, and unmeasured 
in the remainder).57 In multivariable analysis, compared 
with paroxysmal AF, the presence of permanent AF was 
associated with a higher rate of incident HF (HR, 1.60; 
95% CI, 1.18–2.16), which suggests that a higher bur-
den of AF is associated with a greater risk for HF. In a 
global AF registry, prevalent HF was 33% in paroxysmal 
AF, 44% in persistent AF, and 56% in permanent AF, 
which suggests a higher burden of AF is associated with 
a greater prevalence of HF.18
Cognitive Impairment and Dementia
Although there is compelling evidence to support an 
association of AF with greater cognitive decline and 
risk of dementia,52 there is a paucity of data on the 
relationship between AF burden and cognitive per-
formance. A small, cross-sectional study based on the 
ARIC cohort (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) 
provided evidence that persistent AF might be asso-
ciated with lower cognitive function than paroxysmal 
AF.58 This study included 325 participants (mean age, 
76.9±5.2 years; 53% women) who underwent cogni-
tive tests and heart rhythm recording using a 14-day 
patch monitor. AF was detected in 26 participants 
(8.0%): 14 with low AF burden (range, 1%–6%) or 
paroxysmal AF and 12 with high burden (100%) or 
persistent AF. Compared with no AF, persistent AF, but 
not paroxysmal AF, was independently associated with 
lower z scores on the Digit Span Backward test (execu-
tive function), the Trail Making Test part B (executive 
function), and Animal Naming (verbal fluency). Pro-
spective evaluation of AF burden in relation to longitu-
dinal change in cognitive scores and incident dementia 
is needed to confirm this association.
Quality of Life
AF is associated with lower quality of life, both direct-
ly and through its association with other factors that 
affect quality of life. The AFEQT (Atrial Fibrillation Ef-
fect on Quality-of-Life) health status measure was as-
sessed in 2007 AF patients from the ORBIT registry 
(Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of 
Atrial Fibrillation).59 The median AFEQT summary score 
was 82 (interquartile range [IQR], 67–94; 0 worst to 
100 best). Multiple factors were independently asso-
ciated with lower AFEQT score: female sex, younger 
age, new-onset AF, higher heart rate, obstructive sleep

apnea, symptomatic HF, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and coronary artery disease. Of note, patients 
with new-onset AF had worse symptoms than those 
with permanent AF.59
Interventions aimed at reducing AF burden have not 
translated proportionally to improvement in quality of 
life. A strategy of rhythm control for patients with AF, 
even if successful, was not shown to result in better 
quality of life than in patients treated with rate control,60 
for older patients or for patients with HF and reduced 
ejection fraction.61 In an AF cohort, patients undergoing 
cardioversion compared with matched patients without 
cardioversion did not exhibit greater symptom improve-
ment (34% versus 42%) or less symptomatic progression 
(15% versus 4%) by European Heart Rhythm Associa-
tion scores.62 In patients randomized to antiarrhythmic 
drug therapy versus ablation, quality of life was similar 
after treatment, despite less AF in the ablation group.63 
Overall, these data suggest that higher AF burden is not 
necessarily related to lower quality of life.
Mortality
AF is associated with an increased risk of mortality.4,5,64 
Importantly, higher AF burden is associated with higher 
risk of mortality. In a systematic review of 12 studies 
of nearly 100 
000 patients that compared outcomes by 
type of AF, overall unadjusted all-cause mortality was 
higher in patients with nonparoxysmal AF than in those 
with paroxysmal AF (relative risk, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26–
1.70); multivariable adjustment only partially attenu-
ated this association (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09–1.37).27
The data are less clear on how AHREs relate to mor-
tality, with a suggestion that these low-burden events 
carry lower mortality risk, in part because studies have 
been smaller with less precision. In one study of 394 pa-
tients with cardiac resynchronization therapy, although 
the 20% of patients with AHREs (compared with those 
without) had an increased risk of clinical AF (HR, 2.35; 
95% CI, 1.47–3.74) and thromboembolic events (HR, 
2.30; 95% CI, 1.09–4.83; P=0.028), the risk of mor-
tality was not higher (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.64–1.45).50 
By contrast, in a study of 224 patients with pacemak-
ers, 17% had AHREs of ≥5-minute duration within 6 
months of pacemaker implantation; in multivariate 
analysis adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular dis-
eases, presence of AHREs was associated with a sig-
nificant increase in cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.80; 
95% CI, 1.24–6.31) and stroke mortality (HR, 9.65; 
95% CI, 1.56–59.9), with a trend toward increased all-
cause mortality (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.98–3.26).65 The 
subgroup of patients with AHREs of ≥5-minute but <1-
day duration also had a significantly increased cardio-
vascular mortality (HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.37–7.66).
Primary end point: Stroke, noncerebral 
systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, or 
vascular death
Safety end point: Major bleeding, defined as 
any bleeding requiring transfusion of ≥2 U of 
red blood cells or equivalent of whole blood, 
or as bleeding associated with death; drop in 
hemoglobin ≥5 g/dl; significant hypotension 
with need for inotropic support; intraocular 
bleeding; bleeding requiring surgery; or 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
 
Similar annualized risk of stroke or 
systemic embolism in paroxysmal AF 
and sustained AF (adjusted RR, 0.94 
[0.63–1.40]; P=0.755)
Analyses by AF pattern were adjusted 
for age, hypertension, HF, valvular heart 
disease, and DM
Primary end point: Ischemic stroke
 
In SPAF aspirin-treated patients, there 
was a comparable annualized rate of 
ischemic stroke in those with intermittent 
(3.2%) and sustained (3.3%) AF
Primary analyses were unadjusted. 
Differences in age-adjusted RRs between 
patients with intermittent and sustained 
AF were evaluated by fitting the model, 
adjusted for age, pattern of AF, and factor 
of interest, and then testing significance of 
the interaction term for pattern of AF and 
factor of interest.

Atrial Fibrillation Burden
Conclusions
• Compared with paroxysmal AF, nonparoxysmal AF 
is associated with higher prevalence and incidence 
of HF.
• Although 1 small cross-sectional study reported 
that persistent AF was associated with lower cog-
nitive function than paroxysmal AF, data on the 
relationship between AF burden and cognitive 
function are scarce, which represents a critical 
knowledge gap that demands more attention.
• Higher AF burden is not necessarily related to 
lower quality of life; new-onset AF is associated 
with worse quality of life than reported in patients 
with permanent AF. Interventions aimed at reduc-
ing AF burden have not translated to improvement 
in quality of life.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
• Compared with paroxysmal AF, nonparoxysmal AF 
is associated with higher risk of mortality. The data 
are less clear with device-detected AHRE.
• High-quality research is needed to understand how 
maintenance of sinus rhythm and anticoagulation 
relate to cardiac function, quality of life, and mor-
tality in patients with various types and durations 
of AF, particularly among the population at risk of 
HF or who have coexistent HF.
ATHEROSCLEROTIC AND LIFESTYLE 
RISK FACTORS AND AF BURDEN
Physical inactivity, obesity, and hypertension have all 
been linked to increased incidence of AF66,67; however, 
the degree to which atherosclerotic and lifestyle factors 
contribute to AF burden is not well established. There is 
emerging evidence that comprehensive approaches to 
reduce obesity, improve physical activity, and appropri-
ately manage obstructive sleep apnea can reduce recur-
rence of AF after ablation, but the degree to which AF 
burden is reduced has been reported in only a few stud-
ies. The following section presents the limited evidence 
that has been generated from observational studies and 
single-center, small, RCTs in which a variety of methods 
to measure AF burden or recurrence were used.
Comprehensive Risk Factor Management
Australian investigators reported the results of a study 
in which participants with AF and body mass index 
(BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 opted for comprehensive risk factor 
management or standard management and were fol-
lowed up for 15 months,68 2 years,69 and 5 years (LEG-
ACY study [Long-term Effect of Goal-Directed Weight 
Management on Atrial Fibrillation Cohort: A 5-Year Fol-
low-up Study]).70,71 AF burden was measured by 7-day 
Holter monitoring. For 75 participants in the risk factor 
intervention group, the probability of experiencing 1 or 
more 30-second episodes of AF decreased from base-
line (0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.7) to the 15-month follow-up 
(0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.3). In comparison, the probability 
of experiencing 1 or more 30-second episodes of AF did 
not significantly decrease from baseline to 15-month 
follow-up (0.6 [95% CI, 0.5–0.7] to 0.5 [95% CI, 
0.4–0.6]) in 75 participants who received usual care.68 
A significant group-by-time interaction (P<0.001) was 
demonstrated. In a subsequent report,69 freedom from 
AF 2 years after catheter ablation was greater in those 
who chose to participate in the risk factor management 
program than in those who chose not to participate. 
The structured weight loss component of the risk factor 
modification intervention produced the greatest benefit 
for reduction of AF burden (without additional catheter 
ablation or drug therapy) in those whose weight loss 
was >10% of their baseline weight, progressive, and 
linear and did not fluctuate more than 2% over the 
5-year follow-up.70 
The benefit of cardiorespiratory fitness for reduc-
ing AF burden was evaluated in 308 subjects who 
participated in the risk factor management program. 
Over the 5-year follow-up, AF-free survival was greater 
(P<0.001) in those who improved their cardiorespira-
tory fitness by ≥2 metabolic equivalents than in those 
whose metabolic equivalent gain was <2.71 Although 
the most powerful components of this comprehensive 
risk factor management intervention appear to be the 
weight loss and physical activity programs, it is not clear 
how other components of the intervention might have 
interacted with weight loss and exercise programs to 
contribute to decreased AF burden.
Exercise Training
There is evidence to suggest that a lower level of car-
diorespiratory fitness is associated with a higher risk of 
AF.72 The benefit of structured exercise programs for 
reducing AF symptoms and improving cardiorespira-
tory capacity has been reported,73,74 but RCTs report-
ing the benefit of exercise training to reduce AF burden 
are limited. Malmo et al75 reported that in 25 partici-
pants assigned to a 12-week aerobic interval training 
program with 3-month follow-up, the mean time in 
AF decreased from 8.1% to 4.8% compared with an 
increase from 10.4% to 14.6% in the 25 participants 
assigned to the control group (P=0.009). Although this 
study was limited by a relatively small sample size and 
short follow-up, the use of an implantable loop record-
er to quantify AF throughout the study was a strength 
compared with studies that used 7-day Holter monitor 
recordings68–70 to quantify AF.
Weight Reduction
Obesity is associated with a higher risk of AF.76–78 Other 
than LEGACY,70 most studies investigating the relation-
ship between adiposity and AF have focused on AF in-
cidence or recurrence and not AF burden. For example, 
in Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes), an in-
tensive lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and 
maintain weight loss did not reduce the risk of develop-
ing AF compared with diabetes mellitus support and 
education in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.79 
Moreover, findings have been mixed, with some studies 
reporting no increased risk for AF recurrence with high-
er BMI80,81 and others reporting increased risk for AF 
recurrence with higher BMI after catheter ablation.82–84 
A meta-analysis of 6 observational studies (2358 par-
ticipants) that used either event monitors or 24-hour 
Holter monitor recordings to detect AF revealed that a 
BMI ≥25 kg/m2 was associated with a 31% increased

risk of AF recurrence after ablation.85 Compared with 
participants with normal BMI (<25 kg/m2), those cat-
egorized as obese (≥30 kg/m2) had a 38% increased 
risk of AF recurrence.85
One limitation of the above studies was the short 
follow-up time, with only 280,83 of the 6 studies follow-
ing participants for at least 24 months. A recent study 
conducted follow-up on 2715 participants for 5 years 
after ablation to examine the association of BMI with 
ablation outcomes.86 A BMI >35 kg/m2 was a significant 
predictor of AF recurrence. As BMI increased over the 
5 years, there was a linear increase in the proportion of 
participants with persistent AF, from 46.2% to 65.1% 
(P<0.001); this finding would suggest that not only 
was increased BMI a risk factor for AF recurrence, but 
it also might have contributed to an increased AF bur-
den. By contrast, a retrospective study of 1558 patients 
who underwent ablation revealed that over 3 years 
of follow-up, there was a trend for but no statistically 
significant relationship between increased BMI and in-
creased risk of AF recurrence after ablation.84 Findings 
from this study, however, are limited by its retrospective 
approach and lack of an objective method to detect AF 
episodes during follow-up.
Authors of a recent meta-analysis87 reported asso-
ciations of measures of adiposity with postablation AF: 
1-SD higher values for epicardial fat volume, waist-to-
hip ratio, waist circumference, and BMI were associ-
ated with a 2.69 (95% CI, 1.66–4.07), 1.32 (95% CI, 
1.25–1.41), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.08–1.14), and 1.22 (95% 
CI, 1.17–1.27) fold increased risk of postablation AF, 
respectively. However, details such as timing and meth-
od of postablation detection of AF were not reported. 
The effect of these adiposity variables was not reported 
in terms of AF frequency and duration, but findings 
highlight the importance of considering measures be-
yond BMI to elucidate the influence of obesity on AF 
burden.
Blood Pressure Lowering
Although the link between hypertension and higher 
AF risk is well recognized,66 it is unclear whether inten-
sive blood pressure (BP) lowering would be associated 
with a lower incidence of AF. The ACCORD (Action to 
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) BP trial showed 
that intensive BP lowering reduced the risk of a com-
posite outcome of AF and abnormal P-wave indices88; 
however, given the composite outcome in this study, 
more definitive studies that specifically evaluate AF in-
cidence are needed. Moreover, the data are scarce on 
whether intensive BP lowering or treatment with spe-
cific BP-lowering agents would reduce AF burden. In a 
1-group crossover trial, Deftereos et al89 reported that 
participants (n=60) with paroxysmal AF experienced a 
significant (P<0.01) reduction (from 82 mm 
Hg [IQR, 
74–87 mm 
Hg] to 78 mm 
Hg [IQR, 71–82 mm 
Hg]) in 
diastolic BP when treated with moxonidine, but that 
reduction was not associated with reduced AF bur-
den. However, participants who were monitored with 
48-hour Holter recordings experienced fewer episodes 
(P<0.01) and minutes (P<0.01) of AF per day, respec-
tively, when treated with moxonidine (1 episode [IQR, 
1–3 episodes] and 16.5 minutes [IQR, 15.0–57.8 min-
utes]) compared with periods when they used the pla-
cebo (3 episodes [IQR, 2–3 episodes] and 28.0 minutes 
[IQR, 15.0–57.8 minutes]).
Stress Management
Theoretically, cognitive behavioral therapies that coun-
teract the stress response could reduce sympathetic 
stimulation and diminish arrhythmogenic triggers that 
can stimulate AF. Lampert et al90 reported an associa-
tion between experiencing negative emotion and sub-
sequent AF episodes, documented by a nonlooping 
event recorder. Yet few investigators have explored the 
effect of cognitive and behavioral therapies on reduc-
ing AF burden. Using a prospective pre-post cohort 
design, Lakkireddy et al91 evaluated the influence of 
yoga on the number of AF episodes experienced by 
participants with paroxysmal AF who participated in a 
3-month yoga program. AF episodes were measured 
by a nonlooping event recorder that participants used 
at least once daily and if symptoms were experienced. 
The frequency of AF episodes decreased significantly 
from baseline to study completion for both symptom-
atic (3.8±3.0 to 2.1±2.6, P<0.001) and asymptomatic 
(0.12±0.44 to 0.04±0.20, P<0.001) AF. These findings 
suggest a benefit from the yoga intervention, but the 
lack of a control group and short follow-up period limit 
the strength of the evidence. In a descriptive study,92 
65% of participants endorsed stress or worry as a cause 
of their AF, yet the science to explain the relationship 
between perceived stress and AF burden is underde-
veloped.
Conclusions
Tables 3 and 4 present a list of studies that have in-
vestigated comprehensive risk factor management pro-
grams and risk factor modification interventions as they 
relate to AF burden.
• A structured and comprehensive risk factor man-
agement program targeting atherosclerotic risk 
factors is effective in reducing AF burden (Table 3).
• More RCTs of exercise training interventions with 
longer follow-up are needed to confirm whether 
exercise training is effective in reducing AF burden. 
More research is also needed to determine the 
dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) of physi-
cal exercise required to reduce AF burden.

more likely to be free of AF 24 
mo after ablation than those 
who declined to participate.
Method of AF detection was 
ECG, with 7-d Holter monitor

greater degree in the risk factor 
management group.
AF-free survival was 
defined as freedom 
from atrial arrhythmia 
≥30 s after 3-mo 
blanking period; the 
risk factor management 
program was an 
independent predictor 
of AF-free survival

management program. Groups 
were categorized as ≥10% 
weight loss, 3%–9% weight 
loss, <3% weight loss, and 5-y

Inclusion criteria: 
Patients with BMI ≥27

Primary end point: 
AF-free survival, 
defined as 
freedom from 
atrial arrhythmia 
≥30 s after 3-mo 
blanking period

AF-free survival was greatest in 
participants who lost ≥10% of 
body weight and maintained the 
loss over 5 y.
Method of AF detection was 
ECG and 7-d Holter monitor, but 
frequency was not reported.
Progressive linear weight loss 
was associated with greater AF-
free survival.
Program required patients to 
maintain food and activity 
diaries; attrition was substantial.
These findings are notable 
because they provide insight 
into the threshold of weight loss 
that reduces AF recurrence.
At 5 y: ≥10% weight 
loss, 45.5% AF-free; 
3%–9% weight 
loss, 22.2% AF-free; 
and <3% weight 
loss, 13.4% AF-free

program.
Method of AF detection was 
ECG and 7-d Holter monitor, but

standard Bruce protocol.
These findings are notable 
because they provide insight

reduces AF recurrence.
Program required patients to

At study completion: 
89% of patients with 
≥2 MET gain were AF-
free; 40% of patients 
with <2 MET gain were 
AF-free (P<0.001).
In multivariate analysis, 
every MET gained from 
baseline was associated 
with a 12% decrease

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
• Weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight are 
effective in reducing AF burden.
• Adiposity measures such as epicardial fat, waist cir-
cumference, and waist-to-hip ratio could improve 
our understanding of the contribution of obesity 
to AF burden.
• Published data regarding whether intensive BP 
lowering would reduce AF burden are lacking.
• RCTs are needed to determine whether interven-
tions to manage stress (eg, yoga, mindfulness 
meditation) would reduce AF burden (Table 4).
KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND FUTURE 
DIRECTIONS
Defining AF Burden
Current guidelines define presence of AF as electro-
cardiographic documentation of absolutely irregular 
RR intervals and no discernible, distinct P waves last-
ing for at least 30 seconds.94 As such, manufacturers 
of ambulatory heart rhythm monitors, such as iRhythm 
Technologies, have used the 30-second cutoff to de-
fine presence of AF. It might be more useful, however, 
to consider AF not as a binary state but rather on a 
spectrum of atrial disease severity, defined in part by a 
factor of how much time or burden one is in this state. 
As has been discussed thoroughly in this document, 
the amount of time spent in AF has a direct effect on 
outcomes such as stroke. How one measures burden 
of AF beyond paroxysmal or nonparoxysmal AF types, 
however, needs consensus.
A reasonable and convenient definition of AF burden 
is the amount of time spent in AF divided by the total 
amount of time a patient is monitored. Most commer-
cial loop monitors report AF burden using this definition. 
In many studies, AF burden is defined as the maximum 
amount of time in AF over a 24-hour period. In the pres-
ent era of long-term continuous monitoring, however, 
this convenient definition of AF burden becomes prob-
lematic. With long-term monitoring, a single but pro-
longed episode of AF could be interpreted as low AF bur-
den, and very frequent but brief episodes of AF could be 
interpreted as high AF burden, which calls into question 
whether it is the duration of the longest single episode 
or total AF burden that is prognostically more important.
The concept of temporal AF burden aggregation, or 
AF density, was defined by Charitos et al95 as a measure 
of the concentration of AF episodes. More precisely, AF 
density was defined as the absolute cumulative devia-
tion of the patient’s actual burden development from 
the hypothetical uniform burden development divided 
by the minimum time required for development of all 
AF episodes. Given the same AF burden, a patient with 
a small number of prolonged episodes of AF has a high-
er AF density than a patient with many brief episodes of 
AF. In this study, the authors demonstrated that detec-
tion of AF in patients with a high density of AF is more 
challenging with intermittent monitoring. Moreover, 
how AF density affects risk of stroke and other out-
comes is not well studied.
Therefore, the definition of AF burden must take into 
account not only the percentage of time in AF but also 
the monitoring time window. For example, one defini-
tion of AF burden that can be adopted is 7-day peak AF 
burden: the maximum percentage of time in AF during 
any 7-day window. This is a modification of the com-
monly used definition of maximum AF burden in a 24-
hour monitoring window, which has obvious limitations 
because of the short monitoring time. Using a 24-hour 
monitoring window, patients with a single 24-hour epi-
sode over the span of 1 year will have the same AF bur-
den as patients with sustained AF over the span of 1 year, 
although they would likely have different prognoses.
Validating Measures of AF Burden
A critical knowledge gap that needs to be addressed is 
the threshold of AF burden that results in an increased 
risk of stroke that warrants anticoagulation. The an-
swer to this question might depend on the context in 
which AF is being measured. In standard clinical set-
tings, where AF is identified with intermittent monitor-
ing and in response to symptoms, the clinical burden 
of AF might not impact stroke risk.16,17,24,96 It is possible 
that by the time patients reach a clinical diagnosis, they 
have already crossed a yet unspecified threshold of el-
evated stroke risk. In these patients, AF burden might 
play a less critical factor in determining stroke risk and 
need for anticoagulation.
However, there is a trend toward more widespread 
use of long-term monitoring for subclinical or asymp-
tomatic AF. As summarized earlier, in trials such as AS-
SERT, atrial tachyarrhythmias lasting >6 minutes were 
associated with higher stroke risk.43 More recently, long-
term implantable monitors in targeted high-risk patient 
populations, such as those with cryptogenic strokes, 
have revealed high rates of subclinical AF.97 The key 
knowledge gap that remains, therefore, is this: In pa-
tients without overt clinical AF, how much AF burden 
is necessary to justify initiation of anticoagulation? Re-
sults from the CRYSTAL AF study (Cryptogenic Stroke 
and Underlying AF) imply that a single episode lasting 
>6 minutes might be sufficient to increase risk; how-
ever, as summarized earlier, studies of device-detected 
AF have found thresholds of elevated risk that vary from 
5 minutes to >24 hours (Table 2). Prospective long-term 
monitoring studies are needed to determine the AF 
burden threshold at which the risk of stroke increases. 
Ultimately, randomized anticoagulation clinical trials in 
asymptomatic patients who meet a predefined AF bur-
den threshold on long-term monitoring will be needed

CI, 0.19–1.0), and duration 
decreased from 1176 (95% 
CI, 720–1632) to 491 
(95% CI, 159–822) min. 
For control group, episodes 
decreased from 2.8 (95%

quantify AF. Those participating 
in the tailored weight loss 
program experienced less AF 
burden than those who did 
not participate.
The weight loss program 
was intense, requiring 
use of meal replacements 
when weight loss was not

Catheter ablation was 
performed on 14 patients

Atrial Fibrillation Burden
to answer this question. Ongoing trials include ARTESiA 
(Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in 
Patients With Device-Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrilla-
tion)98 and NOAH (Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anti-
coagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes).99 
Similarly, future studies to determine the threshold of AF 
burden that results in increased risk of other outcomes 
such as HF and dementia will also be needed (Table 5).
Most of what is known about the effects of AF 
burden and consequences of AF comes from studies 
in patients with permanent pacemakers or implant-
able cardioverter-defibrillators or those who have had 
prior strokes. Prospective studies of the effects of AF 
burden on stroke and other outcomes will be necessary 
in broader community-based cohorts. Studies such as 
National Institutes of Health–funded projects to better 
define the prevalence of subclinical AF and the risks as-
sociated with AF burden using external loop monitors 
in the ARIC (R01HL126637), Women’s Health Initiative 
(R01HL136390), and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atheroscle-
rosis (R01HL127659) cohorts are ongoing.
Link Between AF Burden and Stroke
The concept that AF-related strokes are caused by for-
mation of left atrial clots that embolize has been consid-
ered dogma. It is believed that the risk of a clot forming 
and embolizing increases significantly after 48 hours of 
AF. This notion is based in part on studies in which stroke 
risk related to cardioversion is mitigated by ruling out left 
atrial clots with transesophageal echocardiogram in pa-
tients who have been in AF for >48 hours.100
However, studies in patients with long-term device 
monitoring reveal that the temporal relationship be-
tween AF burden and strokes might not be as strong 
as we have assumed.46,49 In the Veterans Administra-
tion Health Care System study,46 83% of patients with 
a stroke had no AF detected in the previous 120 days. 
Although most of the remaining patients with AF de-

Aim: To determine 
whether the effect of 
moxonidine as a central 
nervous sympathetic 
activation modulator 
affects AF burden in 
hypertensive patients 
with AF
Study type: 
Not an RCT; prospective 
double-blind, single-
group cross-over
Size: N=56
Inclusion criteria: 
Hypertensive patients 
with symptomatic AF 
in whom at least 5 
min of AF had been 
documented on a 
baseline 24-h Holter
Exclusion criteria: 
Age <25 or >80 y; 
known hypersensitivity 
to moxonidine; sinus 
node dysfunction; 
bradycardia <50 bpm 
at rest; glomerular 
filtration rate <30 
mL·min−1·1.73 m−2; 
history of angioneurotic 
edema; ejection 
fraction <0.40; angina 
pectoris; known 
peripheral artery 
disease; and others
Intervention: 
Each participant 
received treatment for 
two 6-wk periods: 1 
period with moxonidine 
and 1 period with 
placebo, with 2-wk 
washout between 
treatments
Comparator: 
Cross-over study
Primary end point: 
AF burden: min spent in AF 
per d when measured by 
three 48-h Holter recordings 
in moxonidine and placebo 
treatment periods
Secondary: Number of 
AF episodes per d. When 
treated with moxonidine, 
AF min per d were reduced 
from 28 to 16.5 (P<0.01).
AF duration was reduced 
by 41% and frequency 
by 66% while taking 
moxonidine.
Safety end point: No 
serious adverse events were 
documented
In this cross-over study, min 
of AF per d and episodes 
per d were reduced during 
treatment with moxonidine. 
AF detection method was 
48-h Holter recordings 3 
times during moxonidine and 
placebo treatment. 
AF symptoms were also 
reduced during moxonidine 
treatment. 
Compliance with treatment 
was monitored by pill counts.

AND GUIDELINES
short-term risk of AF; however, these studies also raise 
questions regarding the lack of a temporal relationship 
between AF and stroke in other patients. This lack of 
a temporal relationship can be explained either by the 
ability of left atrial clots to form and remain dormant for 
prolonged periods before embolizing or by the ability of 
AF to predispose patients to embolic events originat-
ing outside the left atrial appendage. One leading hy-
pothesis is that patients with AF might have associated 
endothelial dysfunction that leads to an inflammatory 
response and release of prothrombotic molecules such 
as von Willebrand factor.101,102 Studies focused on how 
AF burden affects endovascular function are needed 
to further explore these hypotheses. Another possible 
explanation could be related to the emerging concept 
that AF is on a continuum of atrial disease, or atriopa-
thy.103 It is plausible that stroke could occur at any stage 
of this continuum and that AF burden could simply be 
a marker of the severity of atriopathy and stroke risk.
AF Burden and Future Monitoring 
Techniques
The technologies used to monitor AF are advancing at 
a rapid pace. Several commercially available loop moni-
tors the size of a small patch are now available, and 
their ease of use results in excellent patient compli-
ance.104 Implantable loop recorders have become small 
enough and easy enough to implant that it is feasible 
to perform the procedure in-office.105 As both wear-
able and implantable technologies become smaller and 
more affordable, long-term continuous cardiac moni-
toring will become pervasive. It is conceivable that in 
the near future, most people, with and without known 
AF, will be continuously and indefinitely monitored.
As is often the case, improvements in medical tech-
nology outpace our ability to study their clinical implica-
tions. New questions and additional knowledge gaps 
are bound to arise. For example, as greater numbers 
of young and low-risk populations are monitored con-
tinuously, AF burden and the clinical consequences will 
need to be studied and redefined. Long-term monitor-
ing in large populations will also allow us to better de-
fine the significance of changes in AF burden over time.
CONCLUSIONS
• Many studies examine outcomes by AF burden 
classified by AF type (paroxysmal versus nonpar-
oxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or 
permanent). However, quantitatively, AF burden 
can be defined by longest duration, number of AF 
episodes during a monitoring period, and perhaps 
more comprehensively by the proportion of time 
an individual is in AF during a monitoring period, 
expressed as a percentage.
• Current guidelines recommend using vascular risk 
factors (as measured by the CHA2DS2-VASc score), 
and not considering AF burden, when making 
decisions regarding anticoagulation for stroke pre-
vention in AF.
• The strongest evidence suggests that patients 
with persistent AF are at higher risk of stroke than 
those with paroxysmal AF; however, the relation-
ship of increasing AF burden with risk of stroke 
is not well characterized. CIED-based studies con-
clude that higher AF burden is associated with 
higher risk of stroke, but it is unclear whether the 
risk increases continuously or whether a thresh-
old exists, in large part because of variable AF 
duration cutoffs, which were mostly arbitrarily 
prespecified rather than empirically derived. The 
effect of very brief AF episodes of <5 to 6 minutes 
on stroke risk has not been rigorously evaluated 
and remains unknown.
• Although one small cross-sectional study reported 
that persistent AF was associated with lower cog-
nitive function than paroxysmal AF, data on the 
relationship between AF burden and cognitive 
function are scarce, which represents a critical 
knowledge gap that demands more attention.
• Compared with paroxysmal AF, nonparoxysmal AF 
is associated with higher prevalence and incidence 
of HF and higher risk of mortality. The data are less 
clear with device-detected AHRE.
• Higher AF burden is not necessarily related to 
lower quality of life; new-onset AF is associated 
with worse quality of life than reported in patients 
with permanent AF. Interventions aimed at reduc-
ing AF burden have not translated to improvement 
in quality of life.
• A structured and comprehensive risk factor man-
agement program targeting atherosclerotic risk 
factors, weight loss, and maintaining a healthy 
weight is effective in reducing AF burden.
• Remaining knowledge gaps indicate the need for 
future studies, including those focused on valida-
tion of definitions and measures of AF burden, 
determination of the threshold of AF burden that 
results in an increased risk of stroke that warrants 
anticoagulation, and discovery of the mechanisms 
underlying the weak temporal correlations of AF 
and stroke.
• Developments in monitoring technologies will 
likely change the landscape of long-term AF moni-
toring and could allow better definition of the sig-
nificance of changes in AF burden over time.
