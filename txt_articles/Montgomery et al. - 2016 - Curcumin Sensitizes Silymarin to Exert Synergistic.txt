Abstract 
We studied combinatorial interactions of two phytochemicals, curcumin and silymarin, in their 
action against cancer cell proliferation. Curcumin is the major component of the spice turmeric. 
Silymarin is a bioactive component of milk thistle used as a protective supplement against liver 
disease. We studied antiproliferative effects of curcumin alone, silymarin alone and combinations 
of curcumin and silymarin using colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1, HCT116, LoVo). Curcumin 
inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas silymarin 
showed significant inhibition only at the highest concentrations assessed. We found synergistic 
effects when colon cancer cells were treated with curcumin and silymarin together. The 
combination treatment led to inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis 
compared to single compound treated cells. Combination treated cells exhibited marked cell 
rounding and membrane blebbing of apoptotic cells. Curcumin treated cells showed 3-fold more 
caspase3/7 activity whereas combination treated cells showed 5-fold more activity compared to 
control and silymarin treated cells. When DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed to curcumin, followed by 
treatment with silymarin, the cells underwent a high amount of cell death. The pre-exposure 
studies indicated curcumin sensitization of silymarin effect. Our results indicate that combinatorial 
treatments using phytochemicals are effective against colorectal cancer. 
Key words: curcumin, silymarin, synergy, colon cancer, phytochemicals. 
Introduction 
The incidence rate of cancer and other chronic 
diseases have been associated with the lack of eating 
healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and the 
consumption of western diets rich in processed foods 
and meat. Several scientific and epidemiological 
studies have shown strong associations between colon 
cancer and dietary factors. Colorectal cancer was the 
third most common cancer with nearly 1.4 million 
new cases in 2012 [1]. Though the colon cancer rate for 
Americans aged 50 and older is dropping due to 
effective screening, colon and rectal cancer rates are 
rising in younger Americans [2]. A recent study 
predicts that by 2030, the 20-34 age group will see 
colon cancer rates increase by 90% and rectal cancer 
rates increase by 124% [2]. Only 5 to 10% of colon 
cancers are due to genetic predisposition; others are 
due to diet and lifestyle habits [3]. Therefore changing 
diet and lifestyle habits has great potential to reduce 
incidence of colorectal cancer.  
Fruits, vegetables, and spices contain a wide 
variety of phytochemicals that may offer protection 
against colon cancer. Occasional exposure of colon 
cells to a single phytochemical may be insignificant. 
However, combinations of phytochemicals may 
provide additive or synergistic effects, and have 
effectiveness at low doses making them potent ways

to prevent or eliminate colon cancer initiation and/or 
progression. Many medicinal plants have been used 
with no side effects and phytochemicals derived from 
them exhibit anticancer properties [4]. Studies have 
shown that phytochemicals, such as curcumin, 
genistein, ellagic acid, silymarin and isothiocynates, 
exhibit 
readiosensitizing 
and 
chemosensitizing 
properties [4]. Current chemotherapeutic agents’ 
exhibit high toxicities and side effects: phytochemicals 
derived from plants offer safety and no side effects. 
Also, a single phytochemical at high concentration 
may exhibit anticancer activity. By combining two 
phytochemicals, anticancer activity at much lower 
doses has been sought. Our present study is aimed at 
single versus combination phytochemical effects 
against colorectal cancer cells. The hypothesis of this 
study was that combinations of phytochemicals exert 
beneficial health effects beyond what is provided by 
single phytochemicals alone. Additive or synergistic 
effects exerted that are protective may compensate for 
low amounts of phytochemicals present in foods.  
The best approach for phytochemical use is to 
understand the mechanism of action of plant-derived 
compounds and use these compounds in combination 
with each other or current therapeutic agents so that 
low dosage treatment exerts maximum treatment 
benefits. Using this strategy, we have identified that 
curcumin, the major component of turmeric, when 
used in combination with silymarin, the bioactive 
component of milk thistle, elicits a maximum effect on 
inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation. Results of 
clinical trials show that curcumin is non-toxic and 
well-tolerated (in 12 g dosages) [5]. Silymarin is used 
for liver health in traditional medicine [6]. Both 
silymarin and curcumin have shown inhibitory effects 
against several types of cancer [6-8]. In colorectal 
cancer cells, silymarin exhibits anti-proliferative effect 
only at high concentrations [9]. We investigated the in 
vitro effect of curcumin and silymarin alone and in 
combination on human colorectal cancer cell lines 
(DLD-1, LoVo, HCT116). Our results show that a 
curcumin + silymarin combination leads to more cell 
death by apoptosis than a single compound treatment 
alone. Also, curcumin sensitizes the anti-proliferative 
effect of silymarin. 
Materials and Methods 
Cell Lines and Reagents 
Human colon cancer cells (DLD-1, LoVo, 
HCT116) were obtained from the American Type 
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured 
(37°C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, 
sodium pyruvate, and HEPES buffer. DMEM and 
culture medium supplements were purchased from 
Hyclone (Logan, UT). Curcumin and silymarin 
(Sigma-Aldrich, Inc, St. Louis, MO) were prepared 
and stored in DMSO at 100 mM stock solutions.  
 Cell Propagation and Cell Proliferation Assay 
DLD-1 cells were propagated (37°C, 5% CO2) 
until confluence was reached. Cells were treated with 
trypsin (0.25%) to detach them from culture plates 
followed by addition of enriched DMEM to neutralize 
trypsin. Cells (5000 cells/100 µl) were added to each 
well of 96-well microplates and incubated overnight 
to allow cells to attach. Cells were treated with 
curcumin alone, silymarin alone or curcumin + 
silymarin combination (12.5 µM curcumin held 
constant: silymarin at concentrations of 1.56, 3.125, 
6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 µM). Cell proliferation was 
assessed using a previously described crystal violet 
method [10, 11]. Briefly, all dilutions were made 
immediately before addition to cells, all treatments 
were 
performed 
in 
quadruplicate, 
and 
each 
experiment was performed at least three times 
independently. In addition to treatment wells, control 
wells were assessed which included cell blanks 
(media only), growth controls (untreated cells plus 
media), and vehicle controls (untreated cells plus 
media plus DMSO at the highest concentration 
assessed). At 48 h, cells were fixed by addition of 
glutaraldehyde (20 μL, 11% glutaraldehyde, 15 min 
rotation, 300 rpm), washed with water, dried and 
stained (0.1% crystal violet). Crystal violet that was 
not cell-bound was removed by washing (3 water 
washes) and then plates were dried. Cell-bound 
crystal violet was solubilized (10% acetic acid) and 
absorbance was determined in a microplate reader 
(562 nm).  
Synergy Determination  
Percent cell survival results were converted to 
Fraction Affected (FA). This conversion was made as 
follows. FA = 0 represents 100% viability; FA = 1 
represents 0% viability. Curcumin + silymarin 
interactions were assessed by Combination Index (CI) 
analysis using the CompuSyn software program 
(ComboSyn, Inc, Paramus, NJ) that is based on the 
Chou-Talalay equation [12]. Interpretations of CI 
results follow. CI values <1 indicate synergism; =1 
indicates additivity; >1 indicates antagonism. 
Live and Apoptotic Cell Assay 
DLD-1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a 
density of 5000 cells/well. The next day media were 
replaced and treatments added: DMSO (vehicle 
control), curcumin (12.5 µM), silymarin (12.5 µM) or 
combination of curcumin (12.5 µM) and silymarin

(12.5 µM). Plates were incubated (37oC, 5% CO2, 48 h). 
Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using the 
ApoTox-Glo™ Triplex Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) 
that quantitated activity of caspases-3/7. The basis of 
the assay was that a fluorogenic cell-permeable 
peptide gets cleaved by a protease upon entry into 
living cells and cleaved peptides generated a 
fluorescent signal proportional to number of live cells. 
Fluorescence 
intensity 
was 
measured 
at 
the 
wavelengths 405EX/505EM. The next step was addition 
of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent (luminogenic substrate 
with tetrapeptide sequence DEVD attached) to 
microwells and incubation (room temperature). 
Caspase digestion of the peptide released a luciferase 
substrate and resulted in luciferase action (production 
of 
the 
luminescent 
signal). 
Fluorescence 
and 
luminescence were measured with a Synergy 
instrumentation (Biotek, Winooski, VT).  
Western Blot 
After treatment of cells with vehicle or 
phytochemicals, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer 
(50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton 
X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40,2.5 mM Na3VO4, 25 μg/ml 
aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin A, 
and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 
centrifuged (10,000 g, 15 min). Supernatant was 
removed and protein concentration determined by the 
BCA method (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). 
Cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were 
separated by SDS gel electrophoresis after which 
proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a 
nitrocellulose 
membrane 
(Pierce 
Biotechnology, 
Rockford, IL). The membrane was blocked using 
blocking buffer (TBST: 20 mM Tris, pH7.6, 100 μM 
NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% nonfat dry milk) and 
incubation (1 h, room temperature, gentle agitation). 
After blocking, the membrane was washed and 
incubated with primary anti-caspase-3 antibody (Cell 
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) in TBST 
blocking buffer (overnight, 4°C). Primary antibody 
was then removed, membrane washed three times 
with 
TBST 
and 
incubated 
with 
horseradish 
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1 h, room 
temperature). Immunoreactive bands were visualized 
by a chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce 
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). β-actin was used as the 
loading control.  
Sensitizing Effect of Phytochemical 
A pre-treatment experiment was performed to 
determine whether curcumin or silymarin mediated a 
sensitizing effect. Cells were pre-treated with either 
curcumin 
or 
silymarin 
for 
24 
hours. 
After 
pretreatment, the cells were washed with DMEM 
media without serum and treated with curcumin (if 
pretreated with silymarin) or silymarin (if pretreated 
with curcumin) with varying concentrations of the 
phytochemicals for 48 h.  
In 
an 
initial 
experiment 
of 
silymarin 
pre-exposure curcumin-treatment, cells were exposed 
(24 h, 37oC) to silymarin at three different 
concentrations (25, 50, 100 µM) or vehicle (DMSO), 
washed with DMEM media without serum and then 
incubated with curcumin (3.125 µM). Besides DMSO 
vehicle control, another control was cells that were 
not pre-exposed to silymarin, that is, cells incubated 
only with curcumin (3.125 µM) treatment. Results of 
silymarin pre-exposed, curcumin-treated cells were 
compared to results of no silymarin pre-exposure, 
curcumin treated cells.  
The reverse experiment was also performed. For 
curcumin pre-exposure, silymarin-treatment studies, 
cells were exposed (24 h, 37oC) to curcumin at three 
different concentrations (3.125, 6.25, 12.5 µM) or 
vehicle (DMSO), washed with DMEM media without 
serum and then incubated with silymarin (3.125 µM). 
Cells that were not pre-exposed to curcumin, that is, 
cells incubated only with silymarin (3.125 µM) 
treatment served as no pre-exposure controls. Results 
of curcumin pre-exposed, silymarin-treated cells were 
compared to results of no curcumin pre-exposure, 
silymarin treated cells.  
Statistics 
Data 
were 
reported 
as 
mean 
± 
SEM. 
Comparisons of the compounds were performed 
utilizing ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni 
pairwise comparisons. Significance was reported at 
p<0.05 unless otherwise stated.  
Results 
Antiproliferative Effects of Curcumin, 
Silymarin and Curcumin + Silymarin 
Combination 
Three colorectal cancer cell lines (DLD-1, LoVo, 
HCT116) were exposed to silymarin alone, curcumin 
alone, or curcumin and silymarin in combination 
(curcumin concentration constant (12.5µM) while 
varying silymarin concentration from 1.56 to 100 µM). 
Inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for curcumin were 
determined in each cell line with results as follow: 
12.0±0.9 µM for DLD-1 cells; 12.6±2 µM for LoVo cells; 
and 7±0.6 µM for HCT116 cells. Curcumin (12.5 µM) 
was selected for use as the concentration at which 
curcumin was held constant in combination studies. 
Similarly, IC50 for silymarin was assessed and 
determined to be 161±9 µM for DLD-1 cells (data not 
shown) which justified performance of silymarin

concentration response up to 100 µM for single and 
combination compound treatment.  
Results evident in all three cell lines were that 
silymarin alone showed significant inhibition of cell 
growth only at higher concentrations (Figure 1A-C) 
whereas curcumin alone exhibited a marked effect on 
all three cell lines, starting at 3.125 µM for DLD-1 and 
HCT116 cells and 6.25 µM for LoVo cells. (Figure 
1A-C). To determine whether curcumin + silymarin 
combination 
treatments 
exhibited 
more 
antiproliferative effects than either compound alone, 
colorectal cancer cell lines (DLD-1, LoVo, HCT116) 
were treated with curcumin+silymarin combination, 
that is, curcumin held constant (at 12.5 µM) and 
varying silymarin concentrations (1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 
12.5, 25, 50, 100 µM). It was observed that no 
statistically significant difference existed between 
curcumin and silymarin alone treated cells at 1.56 and 
3.125 µM in DLD-1 and LoVo cells (Figure 1A and B), 
but 
a 
significant 
difference 
existed 
between 
combination treated and single compound-treated 
cells even at low dose (Figure 1A and 1B). At higher 
concentrations of curcumin alone and curcumin + 
silymarin compounds (25 to 100 µM), no statistically 
significant difference was observed, mainly because 
maximum cell death occurred at these concentrations 
(Figure 1A-C). Therefore, curcumin + silymarin 
compound inhibited significantly (p<0.001) more cell 
growth than silymarin alone at all concentrations 
tested 
(Figure 
1A-C). 
Combination 
compound 
inhibited significantly (p<0.001) more cell growth 
than curcumin alone (at concentrations of 1.56, 3.125, 
6.25 µM: Figure 1A-C).  
Combination index (CI) analysis was used to 
determine whether the effect was synergistic, additive 
or antagonistic using the CompuSyn system. Percent 
cell survival from DLD-1 data (Figure 1A) was 
converted to growth inhibition, termed Fraction 
Affected (FA), and plotted against the CI (Figure 1D). 
With the single exception of combination treatment 
with curcumin (12.5 µM) and silymarin (1.56 µM), all 
combination ratios exhibited CI<1 which indicated a 
synergistic interaction between the two compounds 
[13].

silymarin) at different concentrations (1.56-100 µM) were tested for anti-proliferative effects when presented to colon cancer cells (DLD-1, LoVo, HCT116) singly or in 
combination (i.e., 12.5 µM curcumin held constant and silymarin at varying concentrations). (A). DLD-1 colon cancer cell results. (B). LoVo colon cancer cell results. (C). 
HCT116 colon cancer cell results. In all cell lines tested, combination compound treatments showed significant differences compared to single compound treatments (p<0.01 at 
1.56-12.5µM). No significant differences were observed between combination compound and curcumin at 25-100µM because maximum cell death occurred. (D). Combination 
Index (CI) analysis of growth inhibition in DLD-1 cells after 48 h incubation using curcumin (12.5 µM) and silymarin (varying concentrations). Data from Figure 1A were converted 
to Fraction Affected (FA) and plotted against Combination Index (CI). Combination treatments were curcumin (held constant at 12.5 µM) and silymarin (at varying 
concentrations). Results were as follows for silymarin concentration: ○ = 1.56 µM; □ = 3.125 µM; ▼ = 6.25 µM; ● = 12.5 µM; ∆ = 25 µM; X = 50 µM; and ◊ 
= 
100 µM. Straight line 
on the graph designates a CI equal to 1. Combination Index interpretation was as follows: CI value of 1 indicates additivity; CI<1 indicates synergism; and CI>1 indicates 
antagonism.

Figure 2. Increased apoptosis was induced by curcumin + silymarin combination treatment of DLD-1 colon cancer cells. (A). Phase contrast microscopic 
images (10X objective) of DLD-1 colon cancer cells after 48 h of treatment with (a) DMSO vehicle control; (b) curcumin alone at 12.5 µM CUR; (c) silymarin alone at 12.5 µM 
Sil; and (d) combination of curcumin+silymarin (12.5 µM for each compound). Morphological appearance of blebbing and cell shrinkage was visible in cells treated with curcumin 
alone (b) and curcumin + silymarin combination (d) indicating apoptosis. No morphological appearance of apoptotic cells was present in control (a) and silymarin- treated cells 
(c). (B). A caspase assay was used to identify apoptotic cells after 48 h treatment with phytochemicals. Except for control (vehicle) versus 12.5 µM silymarin alone (Sil), significant 
differences were noted in all comparisons: control versus Cur alone at 12.5 µM (p<0.01); control versus combination treatment Cur+Sil (p<0.01); Sil alone at 12.5 µM versus Cur 
alone at 12.5 µM (p<0.01); and Sil alone at 12.5 µM versus combination treatment Cur+Sil (p<0.001). Data represented results of 3 independent experiments (n=3). (C). DLD-1 
live cells after 48 h treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in live cells in curcumin alone Cur 12.5 µM versus control (p<0.01); and combination Cur+Sil versus 
control cells (p<0.001). No statistically significant difference existed between control versus silymarin alone at 12.5 µM. (D). Western blot analysis of treated cells for 
proteolytically cleaved, active caspase 3. Combination-treated cells (Cur+Sil each at 12.5 µM) exhibited a predominant band of cleaved caspase 3: a lighter cleaved caspase-3 band 
was observed in the curcumin-treated cells (Cur at 12.5 µM). No active caspase-3 was detected in control or silymarin-treated cells. CUR = curcumin. Sil = silymarin. 
 
Increased Apoptosis Induced by Curcumin + 
Silymarin Combination Treatment 
DLD-1 cells were treated with curcumin or 
silymarin, 
alone 
or 
in 
combination, 
and 
morphological changes were observed after 48 h 
(Figure 2A). Cells treated with curcumin at 12.5 µM 
(Figure 2A, panel b) and curcumin + silymarin 
combination (each at 12.5 µM) (Figure 2A, panel d) 
showed marked cell rounding and membrane 
blebbing suggestive of apoptosis compared to DMSO 
vehicle control (Figure 2A, panel a) and silymarin 
(Figure 2A, panel c) treated cells. Besides morphology 
as an indicator of apoptosis (Figure 2A), direct 
measures of apoptosis and live cells were obtained 
using an assay that measured inactive caspase 
(proenzyme) cleavage to the active form. The assay 
used 
was 
ApoTox-GloTM 
from 
Promega 
that 
measured live and apoptotic cells by activities of 
caspases 3 and 7 and reported results as relative 
luminescence (RLU).  
DLD-1 cells were treated with curcumin (12.5 
µM) alone, silymarin (12.5 µM) alone or curcumin + 
silymarin combination (each at 12.5 µM) for 48 h and 
analyzed for caspase3/7 activity. Low levels of 
activity were observed for control (DMSO vehicle) 
and silymarin (12.5 µM Sil) and no statistically 
significant difference was observed between the two 
(Figure 2B). Increased caspase 3/7 activity was 
evident in curcumin (12.5 µM Cur) and combination 
(12.5 µM Cur + 12.5 µM Sil) compared to vehicle 
(control) and silymarin (12.5 µM Sil) treated cells 
(Figure 2B). Curcumin (12.5 µM)-treated cells showed 
3-fold 
more 
apoptosis 
than 
the 
control 
and 
combination-treated cells had 5-fold more apoptosis 
than control (Figure 2B). As expected, treated cells 
that exhibited high levels of apoptosis (that is, Cur 
12.5 µM alone and Cur 12.5 µM + Sil 12.5 µM 
combination) displayed significantly (p<0.01 and 
p<0.001 respectively) lower numbers of live cells than 
the control (Figure 2C). There was no significant 
difference in live cells between control-treated and 
silymarin alone-treated cells (Figure 2C).

Figure 3. Phytochemical pre-treatment to assess sensitization effect. (A). DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed (Pexp: 24 h) to silymarin at three different concentrations 
(25, 50,100 µM). Cells were then washed and treated with curcumin (3.125 µM). No statistically significant difference existed between silymarin pre-exposed cells and those 
treated with curcumin. (B). DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed (Pexp: 24 h) to curcumin at three different concentrations (3.125, 6.25, 12.5 µM). Cells were then washed and treated 
with silymarin (3.125 µM). Curcumin pre-exposed cells were all different in a statistically significant manner from the no pre-exposure cells (No Pexp): Cur Pexp (3.125 µM) 
versus No Pexp (p<0.01); Cur Pexp (6.25 µM) versus No Pexp (p<0.001); and Cur Pexp (12.5 µM) versus No Pexp (p<0.001). 
 
To verify that active (cleaved) caspase 3 levels 
were indeed increased in the curcumin alone and 
curcumin + silymarin combination compared to 
silymarin alone and vehicle results, Western blot was 
performed (Figure 2D). Bands of uncleaved caspase 3 
were evident in each lane of the blot; however, 
cleaved caspase 3 bands were evident only in 
curcumin alone (faint band) and combination (more 
intense band) lanes and absent in control and 
silymarin lanes (Figure 2D). Therefore, results 
suggested that combination treatment of cells 
exhibited increased apoptosis.  
Sensitization Effect of Curcumin on Silymarin  
Next, we performed a pre-exposure study to 
elucidate whether curcumin or silymarin mediated 
sensitization that led to synergistic effect in the 
combination group. DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed (24 
h) to silymarin at three different concentrations (25, 
50, 100 µM). Cells were washed with serum-deficient 
medium and incubated (48 h) with curcumin (3.125 
µM). Percent cell survival was calculated based on no 
pre-exposure vehicle control (Figure 3A). Percent 
survival of silymarin pre-exposed (25, 50, 100 µM) 
curcumin-treated (3.125 µM) cells was compared to no 
pre-exposed, curcumin-treated cells (Figure 3A). No 
statistically significant difference was evident for the 
silymarin pre-exposed curcumin-treated cells versus 
no pre-exposed curcumin-treated cells (Figure 3A).  
We performed the converse experiment in which 
DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed to curcumin (3.125, 
6.25, 12.5 µM) and treated with silymarin (3.125 µM. 
Figure 3B). Curcumin pre-exposed silymarin-treated 
cells exhibited statistically significant differences 
when 
compared 
with 
no 
pre-exposure, 
silymarin-treated cells at each of the three curcumin 
concentrations tested (Cur 3.125 µM was p<0.01. CUR 
6.25 µM was p<0.001. CUR 12.5 µM was p<0.001) 
(Figure 
3B). 
Therefore, 
curcumin 
pre-exposure 
followed by silymarin treatment inhibited cell 
proliferation significantly compared to no curcumin 
pre-exposure control; whereas silymarin pre-exposure 
followed by curcumin treatment failed to inhibit cell 
proliferation compared to no silymarin pre-exposure 
(Figure 3 A, B). Pre-exposure to curcumin at all 
concentrations followed by treatment with silymarin 
(3.125 µM) showed statistically significant differences 
compared to non-pre-exposure controls (Figure 3B). 
These 
results 
strongly 
suggest 
that 
curcumin 
sensitizes anti-proliferative effect of silymarin. 
Discussion 
We found that silymarin and curcumin inhibited 
proliferation of three colon cancer cell lines, DLD-1, 
LoVo, and HCT116 (Figure 1 A-C). Combination 
effects of silymarin and curcumin resulted in higher 
levels of inhibition of cancer cell growth than either 
silymarin or curcumin alone (Figure 1A-C). Indeed, a 
synergistic effect on inhibition of DLD-1 cell 
proliferation was evident when curcumin and 
silymarin in combination were presented to the cells 
(Figure 1D). Combination Index analysis was assessed 
using a nonconstant ratio of curcumin and silymarin 
(Figure 1D). The Combination Index result of <1 
indicated that the interaction was a synergistic one 
(Figure 1D). All Combination Index results showed 
synergism except one condition (curcumin at 12.5 µM 
+ silymarin at 1.56 µM) which exhibited a slight 
antagonistic interaction (Figure 1D).  
The combination of both compounds showed a 
significant increase in apoptosis as analyzed by 
caspase3/7 activity assay (Figure 2B). Also, the 
increased cleaved caspase 3 protein was observed in 
Western blot only in combination treated cells (Figure 
2D). To understand the synergistic interaction of both 
compounds, 
we 
performed 
pre-exposure

experiments. The DLD-1 cells were pre-exposed to 
curcumin (3.125, 6.25, 12.5 µM. 24 h). At the 24 h time 
point, curcumin was removed by washes and then the 
cells were treated with silymarin (3.125 µM). Percent 
cell survival was calculated compared to control. 
Results of no pre-exposure compared to curcumin 
pre-exposed, silymarin (3.125 µM)-treated cells 
caused 
a 
statistically 
significant 
pre-exposure 
dose-dependent decrease in cell survival compared to 
no pre-exposed cell control (Figure 3B). When 
comparing these curcumin pre-exposure results with 
silymarin pre-exposure results obtained in the 
converse experiment, no significant difference was 
observed between the no pre-exposure control and 
the silymarin pre-exposed, curcumin-treated cells 
(Figure 3A). Therefore, the data strongly suggests that 
curcumin 
sensitizes 
DLD-1 
cells 
for 
silymarin-induced inhibitory effect thereby leading to 
an augmented effect on inhibition of cell proliferation. 
When cells were simultaneously exposed to both 
compounds, 
the 
curcumin-sensitizing 
effect 
augmented 
silymarin 
effect 
thereby 
providing 
evidence for the synergistic interaction.  
 Both curcumin, the curcuminoid present in 
turmeric, and silymarin from milk thistle [6] have 
reported anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo [5, 
7, 8]. Several studies demonstrated that curcumin 
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in 
several types of cancer [14-16]. Curcumin has also 
been credited with mediating radiosensitization and 
chemosensitization in cancer cells [17, 18]. Curcumin, 
when combined with different phytochemicals, 
exhibited antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects 
against cancer in a synergistic manner [19-21]. For 
example, curcumin displayed synergistic anticancer 
activity when combined with epigallocatechenin-3- 
gallate 
in 
human 
breast 
cancer 
[22], 
phenyl 
isothiocyanate in human prostate cancer cells [23, 24] 
and carnosic acid in human acute myeloid leukemia 
[20]. In the present study, we found that curcumin 
exhibited anticancer activity when combined with 
silymarin in a synergistic manner in the DLD-1 colon 
cancer cell line.  
Phytochemicals showing synergistic activity 
may 
be 
more 
advantageous 
than 
traditional 
chemotherapy. Even though chemotherapy eliminates 
tumor cells, it leads to several side effects. In addition, 
both chemo- and radio-therapy have been shown to 
cause epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that 
subsequently resulted in metastasis of the tumor [25, 
26]. 
Phytochemicals 
offer 
alternate 
therapeutic 
approaches to cancer treatments and avoid toxic states 
and side effects manifested by chemotherapeutic 
agents. 
The 
anticancer 
activity 
of 
curcumin 
and 
silymarin have been shown to act on several cellular 
targets [27, 28]. It has been reported that NF-kB 
transcriptionally regulates various proteins that 
participate in prosurvival signaling, such as BCL2 and 
cyclin D [29-31], thereby implicating the NF-kB 
pathway as an active and significant player in cancer 
development [30, 32, 33]. Both curcumin and 
silymarin have been reported to inhibit NF-kB activity 
by suppressing protein phosphorylation [34, 35]. 
Cellular commitment to apoptosis depends upon a 
balance between proteins that mediate cell survival 
versus those that mediate cell death [36, 37]. Both 
curcumin and silymarin have been shown to 
modulate the balance between pro-apototic and 
anti-apoptotic proteins that leads to apoptosis of 
cancer cells (36-38). We hypothesize that the 
synergistic curcumin plus silymarin combination 
effect on DLD-1 cells is due to the ability of both 
compounds to suppress NF-kB activity. Future 
studies will explore the NF-kB and apoptotic 
pathways to understand synergisitic effects of 
curcumin and silymarin on colon cancer cells.
