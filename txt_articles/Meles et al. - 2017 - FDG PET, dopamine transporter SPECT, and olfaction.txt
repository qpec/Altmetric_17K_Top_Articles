ABSTRACT
Background: Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder
is a prodromal stage of Parkinson’s disease and
dementia
with
Lewy
bodies.
Hyposmia,
reduced
dopamine transporter binding, and expression of the
brain metabolic PD-related pattern were each associ-
ated with increased risk of conversion to PD. The
objective of this study was to study the relationship
between the PD-related pattern, dopamine transport-
er binding, and olfaction in idiopathic REM sleep
behavior disorder.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 21 idiopathic
REM sleep behavior disorder subjects underwent 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose PET, dopamine transporter imag-
ing, and olfactory testing. For reference, we included
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET data of 19 controls, 20 PD
patients, and 22 patients with dementia with Lewy
bodies. PD-related pattern expression z-scores were
computed from all PET scans.
Results: PD-related pattern expression was higher in
idiopathic
REM
sleep
behavior
disorder
subjects
compared with controls (P 5 0.048), but lower com-
pared with PD (P 5 0.001) and dementia with Lewy
bodies (P < 0.0001). PD-related pattern expression
was higher in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder
subjects with hyposmia and in subjects with an
abnormal
dopamine
transporter
scan
(P < 0.05,
uncorrected).
Conclusion: PD-related pattern expression, dopamine
transporter binding, and olfaction may provide comple-
mentary information for predicting phenoconversion.

 prodromal stage of these disorders and may be crucial
for disease-modification trials. However, such trials
require biomarkers that can reliably identify at-risk indi-
viduals and predict clinical manifestation of PD/DLB.
Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by
disease-specific
patterns
of
altered
brain
glucose
metabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emis-
sion tomography (18F-FDG-PET) brain imaging. Such
patterns can be extracted from
18F-FDG-PET data
with scaled subprofile model and principal component
analysis (SSM PCA6). With SSM PCA, a PD-related
pattern
(PDRP)
has
been
identified
in
multiple
cohorts.7-10 The degree to which the PDRP is present
in a new 18F-FDG-PET scan can be quantified, result-
ing in a subject score. PDRP subject scores increase
with disease progression and decrease with effective
therapy.10,11
To date, 2 groups have reported that RBD subjects
have higher PDRP subject scores compared with con-
trols.12,13 In a longitudinal study of 17 RBD subjects,
baseline PDRP expression was associated with a high
risk of developing PD or DLB within 5 years.12
Other markers have also been considered. Loss of
striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding on single
photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT)
indicates imminent phenoconversion.14,15 In addition,
RBD subjects with baseline hyposmia have a high risk
of developing PD/DLB within 5 years of follow-up.16,17
The PDRP has potential as a disease biomarker in
prodromal subjects, but further validation by an inde-
pendent research group is essential. Moreover, direct
comparisons between PDRP expression, DAT binding,
and olfaction in the same RBD subjects have never
been made. We therefore studied these 3 markers in
21 RBD patients.
Methods
Twenty-one subjects with RBD (polysomnographi-
cally confirmed18) were evaluated with 18F-FDG-PET,
DAT-SPECT, and olfactory testing. Per inclusion crite-
ria, RBD subjects did not have parkinsonism19 or
DLB20 at the time of the study. Participants with a
history of psychotropic medication use before the
onset of RBD were excluded.21
Nineteen age-matched healthy controls were studied
with 18F-FDG-PET and olfactory testing. Controls did
not have RBD (score < 5 on the RBD screening ques-
tionnaire22) and furthermore had no first-degree fami-
ly members with a neurodegenerative disease.
RBD subjects and controls were investigated with the
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, ver-
sion 200323) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA).24 Olfactory function was assessed with Snif-
fin’ Sticks.15,16,25 Total olfaction scores (TDI) were
obtained by summing the threshold (T), discrimination
(D), and identification (I) subscores. Five olfactory
stages were defined as follows: anosmia, TDI � 15;
severe hyposmia, 15 < TDI � 20); moderate hyposmia,
20 < TDI � 25; mild hyposmia, 25 < TDI � 30; and nor-
mosmia, TDI > 30. In a previous study, it was deter-
mined that a baseline TDI score < 18 was associated
with increased risk of phenoconversion to PD/DLB
within 5 years of follow-up.16 We therefore divided
RBD patients into 2 groups: patients with TDI scores
< 18 and patients with TDI scores � 18.
For reference, we studied the 18F-FDG-PET scans of
retrospectively-included patients with clinical diagno-
ses of “probable PD” (n 5 20, nondemented, aged
67.5 6 8.6 years; 16 men; median disease duration, 2
years; interquartile range, 1-7 years) and “probable
DLB” (n 5 22, aged 73.7 6 7 years; 17 men; median
disease duration, 3 years; interquartile range, 1-4
years) according to consensus criteria.19,20
Exclusion criteria for all subjects included a history
of (other)
neurological diseases,
diabetes
mellitus,
stroke, significant head trauma, or other relevant
comorbidities. The study was approved by local insti-
tutional review boards. Voluntary written informed
consent was obtained from each subject after verbal
and written explanation of the study, in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
All subjects underwent static 18F-FDG-PET imaging
on a Siemens Biograph mCT-64 PET/CT camera (Sie-
mens, Munich, Germany) at the University Medical
Center
Groningen,
the
Netherlands.
Images
were
reconstructed with OSEM3D, including point-spread
function and time-of-flight modeling, and smoothed
with a Gaussian 8-mm full-width at half-maximum fil-
ter. Central nervous system depressants were discon-
tinued in all subjects for at least 24 hours before each
scan. In RBD patients, all RBD-related medications
(eg, melatonin or clonazepam) were discontinued for
at least 48 hours prescan. In PD and DLB patients,
dopamimetics were not withheld.
All images were spatially normalized onto an 18F-
FDG-PET template in Montreal Neurological Institute

Expression of the previously identified PDRP8 was cal-
culated in the new
18F-FDG-PET data as described
previously.27 All PDRP subject scores were z-trans-
formed to the controls (n 5 19), such that the average
PDRP z-score in controls was 0, with a standard devi-
ation of 1.
In future clinical trials of RBD, diagnostic tool spe-
cificity will be more important than sensitivity (ie,
RBD subjects who will not phenoconvert should be
excluded). We therefore reanalyzed the PDRP identifi-
cation cohort8 and selected a cutoff z-score that gave
100% specificity. At PDRP z 5 1.8, there was no mis-
classification of controls in the identification cohort
(data not shown). This threshold was applied to the
PDRP z scores in the current study (ie, a z score � 1.8
was considered indicative of PD).
RBD subjects underwent DAT imaging with 123I-2b-
carbomethoxy-3b-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-
nortropane single photon emission computed tomog-
raphy. DAT binding in striatal regions was quantified
with the Brain Registration & Analysis Software Suite
(BRASS; HERMES Medical, Sweden). Non-specific-
binding ratios were calculated in the caudate nucleus
and putamen bilaterally, using the occipital cortex for
reference
(ie,
nonspecific
binding).
DAT-binding
ratios that were 2 or more standard deviations lower
than age-matched expected control values were con-
sidered abnormal (see Supplementary Material). The
lowest putamen DAT-binding ratio of each subject
was used for further analyses. The median interval
between acquisition of the
123I-FP-CIT-SPECT and
18F-FDG-PET was 2.7 months (interquartile range,
1.3-4.6 months; total range, 12 days to 9.6 months).
Loss of striatal DAT binding in the putamen was con-
sidered abnormal for age in 9 of 21 RBD subjects.
Statistical Analysis
The normality of distribution of each variable was
assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, Q-Q plots, and
box plots. PDRP z-scores and DAT-binding ratios
were parametric. PDRP z-scores were compared across
controls, RBD, PD, and DLB with a 1-way analysis of
variance
(ANOVA)
with
post
hoc
Bonferroni
corrections.
PDRP z-scores were compared between RBD sub-
jects with normal and abnormal DAT scans with an
independent t test. PDRP z-scores and DAT-binding
ratios were also compared between the 2 olfaction cat-
egories (TDI score < 18 or � 18) with an independent t
test. These analyses were not corrected for multiple
comparisons.
In the 21 RBD subjects, correlations between PDRP
z-scores and DAT-binding ratios were tested for signifi-
cance with a Pearson correlation coefficient. TDI,
MoCA, and UPDRS-III scores were nonparametric.
Correlations between these variables and the imaging
metrics
(PDRP
z-scores
and
DAT
binding)
were
assessed with a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.
Correlations were considered significant at P < 0.05
(uncorrected). All analyses were performed using SPSS
software version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
UPDRS-III scores were significantly higher in RBD
subjects compared with controls. MoCA and olfaction
scores
were
significantly
lower
in
RBD
patients
(P < 0.01; Supplementary Table).
PDRP subject scores were not significantly different
between men (n 5 9) and women (n 5 10) in the con-
trol group (P 5 0.75, independent t test). Stepwise
increases in PDRP z scores were observed across
groups (ANOVA F81 5 59.06, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1). In
12 of 21 RBD subjects (57%), the PDRP z score sur-
passed the threshold (z � 1.8; Table 1).
In Table 1, PDRP z-scores, putamen DAT-binding
ratios, and TDI scores are shown for each RBD patient.
This permits identification of several RBD subgroups.
Subjects 1-3 have normal values for all 3 markers. Sub-
jects 17-21 have abnormal values for all 3 markers:

 too low for age, and TDI scores < 18. Subjects 15 and
16 have suprathreshold PDRP z-scores and abnormal
DAT scans, but TDI scores � 18. Of the 9 subjects with
abnormal DAT scans, 7 had suprathreshold PDRP z-
scores (subjects 15-21). Interestingly, of the 12 subjects
with normal DAT scans, 5 (42%) had suprathreshold
PDRP z-scores (subjects 10-14).
On average, subjects with abnormal DAT scans
(n 5 9) had higher PDRP z-scores compared with sub-
jects with normal DAT scans (P 5 0.044, uncorrected).
Subjects with olfaction scores < 18 (n 5 9) had higher
PDRP z-scores compared with subjects with olfaction
scores � 18 (P 5 0.032, uncorrected). Putamen DAT-
binding ratios were not significantly different between
the 2 olfaction groups (P 5 0.117). PDRP z-scores,
DAT binding, and olfaction were not significantly cor-
related, but trends were observed (n 5 21; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1).
Discussion
Our findings underscore the value of the PDRP as a
potential disease biomarker in idiopathic RBD. In line
with 2 previous studies, RBD subjects significantly
expressed the PDRP.12,13 Although on average, PDRP
z-scores were lower in RBD subjects compared with
PD/DLB, more than half of the RBD subjects already
had a PDRP z-score in the range of PD patients.
This study is the first to directly compare PDRP
expression, striatal DAT binding, and olfaction in RBD.
Although a trend was observed, PDRP and striatal DAT
binding were not significantly correlated. Previous stud-
ies in PD have shown that PDRP expression shows only
modest correlation to DAT binding.10,28,29 This may
indicate a partly nondopaminergic genesis of the PDRP.
Remarkably, 5 of 12 RBD patients with normal striatal
DAT binding had suprathreshold PDRP z-scores. In 2
of these cases,
18F-FDG-PET was performed before
DAT-SPECT. It has been shown that some DLB
patients may initially have unremarkable DAT scans.30
It is possible that RBD subjects with significant PDRP
expression but normal DAT binding will eventually
develop DLB. Longitudinal imaging studies of RBD
subjects are needed to further investigate the relation-
ship between PDRP expression and loss of DAT binding
in relation to the final clinical diagnosis.
That
there
was
no
direct
significant
correlation
between PDRP z-scores, DAT binding, and olfaction
could indicate that the 3 markers provide complementa-
ry information. For example, 2 cases had suprathreshold
PDRP z scores and abnormal DAT scans, but TDI scores
� 18. These subjects would have been considered at low
risk of phenoconversion if the olfaction scores alone had

aIn these 2 RBD subjects, 18F-FDG-PET was performed respectively 3.4 and 1.5 months before DAT-SPECT.
bOlfaction was measured with the Sniffin’ Sticks test; total TDI scores are reported in this table (see main text). A TDI > 30 indicates normal olfactory function;
a TDI � 20 indicates severe hyposmia. A TDI score < 18 was previously associated with an increased risk of phenoconversion to PD/DLB.16
cSubjects 1, 14, and 19 all have putamen DAT-binding ratios of 2.0. Subjects 1 and 14 are still in the “normal DAT” category, and subject 19 is in the “abnormal
DAT” category. This is because DAT-binding ratios were considered abnormal if they were 2 standard deviations below the value expected for age. For sub-
jects 1 and 14, the ratio of 2.0 is still normal for age (57 and 70 years old, respectively); however, for subject 19, this ratio is abnormal for age (50 years old).
We note that subject 1 has a borderline-normal DAT-binding ratio and PDRP z-score (z 5 1.7).

 been considered.16 We also identified 3 subjects with
normal values for all 3 markers. These individuals may
have a low risk of converting to PD/DLB. In contrast, 5
subjects had suprathreshold PDRP z scores, putamen
DAT binding too low for age, and TDI scores < 18; these
subjects may be considered to have a particularly high
risk of conversion within the next 5 years.
The data presented in this report are cross-sectional. A
longitudinal study of our RBD cohort is ongoing. Follow-
up data will be essential to elucidate if DAT-SPECT-
negative DLB cases, and perhaps subjects who later devel-
oped multiple system atrophy, contributed to the afore-
mentioned findings. We expect that the PDRP will be
especially informative, because in contrast to olfaction,31
the PDRP is a progression marker.11 Moreover, PDRP
expression is useful in the differential diagnosis of parkin-
sonian disorders,32 whereas DAT imaging is not.33
