Abstract
The transplantation of glucose-responsive, insulin-producing cells offers the potential for restoring 
glycemic control in diabetic patients1. Pancreas transplantation and the infusion of cadaveric islets 
are currently implemented clinically2, but are limited by the adverse effects of lifetime 
immunosuppression and the limited supply of donor tissue3. The latter concern may be addressed 
by recently described glucose responsive mature β-cells derived from human embryonic stem 
cells; called SC-β, these cells may represent an unlimited human cell source for pancreas 
replacement therapy4. Strategies to address the immunosuppression concern include 
immunoisolation of insulin-producing cells with porous biomaterials that function as an immune 
barrier5,6. However, clinical implementation has been challenging due to host immune responses 
to implant materials7. Here, we report the first long term glycemic correction of a diabetic, 
immune-competent animal model with human SC-β cells. SC-β cells were encapsulated with 
alginate-derivatives capable of mitigating foreign body responses in vivo, and implanted into the 
intraperitoneal (IP) space of streptozotocin-treated (STZ) C57BL/6J mice. These implants induced 
glycemic correction until removal at 174 days without any immunosuppression. Human C-peptide 
concentrations and in vivo glucose responsiveness demonstrate therapeutically relevant glycemic 
control. Implants retrieved after 174 days contained viable insulin-producing cells.
Diabetes is a global epidemic afflicting over 300 million people8. While a rigorous regimen 
of blood glucose monitoring coupled with daily injections of exogenous insulin remains the 
leading treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes, they still suffer ill effects due to the 
challenges associated with daily compliance9,10. In addition, the process by which beta cells 
of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans release insulin in response to changes in blood glucose 
concentrations is highly dynamic and imperfectly simulated by periodic insulin 
injections10,11. The transplantation of donor tissue would achieve insulin independence for 
type 1 diabetics2,12,13. Recently, the in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells 
(hPSCs) into functional pancreatic β-cells was reported, providing for the first time a path to 
produce an unlimited supply of human insulin-producing tissue (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 
1)4. Methods to relieve the need for life long immunosuppression are essential to enable 
broad clinical implementation of this new tissue source3,14,15.
Cell encapsulation can overcome the need for immunosuppression by protecting therapeutic 
tissues from rejection by the host immune system7,16. The most commonly investigated 
method for islet encapsulation therapy is the formulation of isolated islets into alginate 
microspheres16–20. Clinical evaluation of this technology in diabetic patients with cadaveric 
human islets has only achieved glycemic correction for short periods16,21,22. Implants from 
these studies elicit strong innate immune-mediated foreign body responses (FBR) that result 
in fibrotic deposition, nutrient isolation, and donor tissue necrosis23,24. Similar results are 
observed with encapsulated xenogeneic islets and pancreatic progenitor cells in preclinical 
diabetic mouse or non-human primate models, where both the therapeutic efficacy of 
encapsulated cadaveric human islets and pig islets is hampered by immunological 
responses19,25,26.

 A major contributor to the performance of encapsulated islet implants is the immune 
response to the biomaterials used for cell encapsulation5,7,17. We demonstrated that 
microsphere size can affect the immunological responses to implanted alginates27. More 
recently, we identified chemically-modified alginates such as triazole-thiomorpholine 
dioxide (TMTD, Supplementary Fig. 2) that resist implant fibrosis in both rodents and non-
human primates28. Here we show that triazole-thiomorpholine dioxide (TMTD) alginate-
encapsulated SC-β cells provide long-term glycemic correction and glucose-responsiveness 
without immune suppression in immune-competent C57BL/6J mice.
To ensure proper biocompatibility assessment in our studies we used immunocompetent 
C57BL/6J mice, because this strain is known to produce a strong fibrotic and foreign body 
response similar to observations made in human patients29. When implanted into the 
intraperitoneal space of non-human primates or rodents with robust immune systems such as 
C57BL/6J,30,31 conventional alginate microspheres elicit foreign body reactions and 
fibrosis30,31. However, 1.5 mm spheres of TMTD alginate mitigated fibrotic responses in 
non-human primates and C57BL/6J mice28. To determine whether encapsulation of SC-β 
cells can induce glycemic correction, we encapsulated cells with three different 
formulations: 500 µm alginate microcapsules conventionally used for islet encapsulation5,22, 
1.5 mm alginate spheres27, and 1.5 mm TMTD alginate spheres (Supplementary Fig. 2). 
Each of these formulations containing three different doses of SC-β were transplanted into 
diabetic streptozotocin (STZ) treated C57BL/6J mice32,33, and we evaluated their ability to 
restore normoglycemia for 90 days for XX days (Fig. 1c–e). Naked, non-encapsulated SC-β 
cells were unable to provide glycemic correction in this diabetic model regardless of 
implantation site (Supplementary Fig. 3). Mice transplanted with SC-β cells encapsulated in 
500 µm microcapsules showed the lowest levels of glycemic control, with only the highest 
dose of transplanted clusters able to restore normoglycemia for 15 days. SC-β cells 
encapsulated in 1.5 mm alginate spheres performed better than the 500 µm microcapsule 
formulation, with normoglycemia maintained for 20–30 days for the two higher doses, 
consistent with earlier results obtained using rat islets27. However, the 1.5 mm spheres were 
unable to sustain normoglycemia with SC-β cells as they could with rat islets, which can be 
rationalized by the increased xenogeneic immune responses against implants with human 
tissue compared to those with rat tissue. Sustained normoglycemia was achieved for over 70 
days with 1.5 mm TMTD alginate spheres at all three doses tested (Fig. 1e). Human C-
peptide concentrations detected in blood at 3, 6, and 9 weeks during the course of this study 
were consistent with the notion that transplanted SC-β cells remained functional; recipients 
of TMTD alginate spheres showed statistically significant higher levels of human C-peptide 
than the other treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 4). The C-peptide levels measured in 
the TMTD alginate group are also consistent with previous studies using human cells to cure 
diabetic immunocompromised mouse models4,33–35.
To evaluate the immune responses to these spheres, a separate cohort of encapsulated SC-β 
cells were implanted IP into C57BL/6 mice and retrieved after 14 days, a time point for 
monitoring foreign body responses to implanted materials. Cells associated with the outside 
of the spheres were isolated and analyzed by FACS (Fig. 2a). Statistically significant lower 
numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, B cells, and CD8+ T cells were associated with 
TMTD alginate encapsulated SC-β cells (formulation 3) compared to SLG20 (> 60% G, 75–

 220 kDa MW, NovaMatrix™) controls (formulation 1, 2). Implants retrieved after achieving 
glycemic correction for 80–90 days in STZ-C57BL/6J mice (implants from Fig. 1c–e) 
revealed that TMTD alginate spheres had much lower levels of fibrotic deposition (Fig. 2b–
f). Immunofluorescence staining of these retrieved spheres for cellular deposition (DAPI, F-
actin) and myofibroblasts (α-SMA) showed significantly lower levels of cellular deposition 
on TMTD alginate spheres (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 5 and 6). Proteomic analysis of 
these protein extracts detected 18 collagen isoforms, and 10 out of the 18 detected collagen 
proteins were significantly reduced in TMTD alginate transplants further showing that these 
materials are able to mitigate fibrotic responses (Fig. 2e). Western blot quantification of α-
SMA protein extracted from the retrieved implants also support the conclusion that there is 
lower fibrosis on TMTD spheres (Fig. 2f, and Supplementary Fig. 5d). Finally, consistent 
with these results, histological processing and immunostaining of TMTD encapsulated SC-β 
clusters prior to transplantation and retrieved after over 90 days from STZ-treated C57BL/6J 
mice revealed cell clusters with positive staining for the mature SC-β cell marker human 
insulin; minimal glucagon staining was observed (Fig. 2g and h). Maintenance of insulin 
positive cells post-retrieval suggests that the SC-β cells retaining their differentiation state 
through the entire study.
We next characterized the ability of TMTD alginate spheres to shield the encapsulated SC-β 
cells from the host immune system. Freeze-fracture cryogenic scanning electron microscopy 
(cryo-SEM) of the spheres display a heterogeneous pore structure with pore sizes ranging 
from sub-micron to 1–3 µm in size, a range capable of preventing permeation by cells and 
large proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Intravital imaging of transplanted spheres after 14 
days in B6.129S6-Ccr6tm1(EGFP)Irw/J mice, in which T, B, and dendritic cells express EGFP, 
showed localization of CCR6+ cells to regions of spheres containing SC-β cells, but an 
inability for these cells to make contact and initiate cytotoxic events (Supplementary Fig. 7).
The achievement of long-term glycemic correction in diabetic animal models has previously 
been defined as sustained normoglycemia for more than 100 days32,36. To evaluate the 
capacity of TMTD alginate encapsulated SC-β cell transplants to sustain normoglycemia, we 
tracked a separate cohort of transplanted STZ-treated C57BL/6J diabetic mice for 174 days, 
at which point implants were retrieved prior to the onset of complications of STZ treatment 
on the mice (Fig. 3a). Transplanted mice maintained glycemic correction over the entire 
period, even at the end of the experiment, and closely matched the blood glucose levels of 
wild type C57BL/6J mice tracked over a similar period. In addition, fasted human C-peptide 
levels over 100 pmol/L were recorded at multiple points throughout the study (Fig. 3c) and 
are comparable to C-peptide levels of fasted wild–type mice. We also performed a glucose 
challenge on these mice 150 days post-transplantation, and encapsulated SC-β cells restored 
normoglycemia at a rate comparable to wild type mice (Fig. 3b). Host pancreas insulin 
concentrations confirmed that STZ treatment induced hyperglycemia XXXX, and that there 
was a lack of endogenous pancreas regeneration in STZ-treated mice (Fig. 3d). SC-β cell 
implants retrieved after 6 months displayed no signs of fibrotic overgrowth, with minimal 
collagenous and cellular deposition evident on the capsule surface (Fig. 3e–h). Since spheres 
retrieved after 3 months showed minimal levels of fibrosis, this suggests that TMTD alginate 
mitigates immunological responses by inhibiting the activation of innate immune cell 
populations. Finally, immunostaining of implants retrieved 174 days post-transplantation

 again showed SC-β clusters staining positive for human insulin; these cells showed minimal 
co-localization with glucagon staining (Fig. 3i). Insulin-positive cells also stained positive 
for the nuclear factor Nkx6.1, a β cell marker, adding further evidence that SC-β cells 
maintained their differentiation state throughout the experiment (Fig. 3j).
Here we showed that encapsulated SC-β cells can achieve glucose-responsive, long-term 
glycemic correction (174 days with the mice still euglycemic at the end of the experiment) 
in an immune-competent diabetic animal with no immunosuppression utilizing a modified 
alginate capable of mitigating the foreign body response. To our knowledge, this is the first 
demonstration of long-term glycemic correction with SC-β cells and the longest duration of 
sustained normoglycemia achieved with any encapsulated insulin-producing human cell in a 
robust FBR rodent model. Previously, we showed that alginate spheres with large diameters 
(> 1.5 mm) could mitigate fibrosis and support euglycemia for 6 months with encapsulated 
rat islets in STZ-treated C57BL/6J mice27. In this report, we show that these same large 
spheres, when encapsulating human cells, can only support euglycemia for less than one 
month and become fibrosed in this animal model (Fig. 1d and Fig. 2d–f). These results 
highlight the added barrier erected by the increased immunological responses against 
xenogeneic human cell implants in this model, comparable to the aggressive immune 
responses of an autoimmune diabetic patient, and the need to develop materials that can 
mitigate these responses. Here, the combination of both increased sphere size and alginate 
derivatization was critical to mitigate these immunological responses. The TMTD alginate 
used here is part of a group of imidazole-modified alginates that mitigate foreign body 
responses in non-human primates for up to 6 months28. Taken together, these results lay the 
groundwork for studies in autoimmune animal models and future human studies with these 
formulations with the goal of achieving long-term replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes. 
We believe that encapsulated human SC-β cells have the potential to provide insulin 
independence for patients suffering from this disease.

Reproducibility
The batches of SC-β cells used for experiments presented in this manuscript ranged between 
40–65% NKX6.1/C-peptide double positive cells and a representative FACS plot for a single 
batch of cells is presented in Figure 1a. In brief, all materials were implanted 
intraperitoneally and retrieved at specified times from immunocompetent streptozotocin 
induced diabetic C57BL/6J or B6.129S6-Ccr6tm1(EGFP)Irw/J male mice in accordance with 
approved protocols and federal guidelines. No blinding or randomization was used. Sample 
processing, staining, FACS, and imaging were performed as detailed below. Shown are 
representative images in all cases at least from N = 15 mice per treatment group. FACS 
analysis was performed on two separate cohorts of N = 5 per treatment group (total of 10 
animals per treatment). Blood glucose correction, serum C-peptide analysis, and in vivo 
Glucose tolerance test studies were performed on three separate cohorts of N = 5 per 
treatment group (total of 15 animals per treatment). Western Blot analysis was performed on 
retrievals from three separate cohorts of N = 5 per treatment group (total of 15 animals per 
treatment). Long-term blood glucose monitoring study was terminated at approximately 6 
months (174 days) to avoid potential complications associated with tumors forming from the 
STZ treatment, which increase in incidence longer than 6 months post STZ administration. 
Quantified data shown are group mean values ± SEM.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, and N = 5 mice per time point and per treatment group 
and all experiments were at least repeated twice and in most cased three times (total sample 
size ranges between 10–15 animals per treatment group). We have specified in each figure 
caption the number of N’s for each experiment and treatment group. These sample sizes 
where chosen based on previous literature. All animals were included in analyses and 
cohorts where randomly selected. Investigators where not blind to performed experiments. 
Due to technical limitations (instrument throughput) for proteomics analysis 12 samples 
were analyzed per experiment by randomly selecting a collection of four samples per 
treatment group. FACS, Elisa, and western blot data was analyzed for statistical significance 
either by unpaired, two-tailed t-test, or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple 
comparison correction, unless indicated otherwise, as implemented in GraphPad Prism 5; *:

TMTD Alginate Synthesis
A complete description of methods and characterization are provided for TMTD alginate in 
reference 27, where the material is referred to as Z1-Y15. Briefly, 3.5 g of 4-
Propagylthiomorpholine 1,1-Dioxide (1 equiv. 20 mmol) was added to a solution of 2.5g 
TBTA (0.2 equiv, 4 mmol), 750µL Triethylamine (0.5 equiv, 10 mmol), 250mg Copper(I)-
iodide (0.06 equiv, 1.3 mmol) in 50ml methanol. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and 5.25 
ml of 11-Azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine (1 equiv, 20 mmol) was added. The reaction 
was agitated overnight at 55 °C, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure the 
next day. The crude reaction was purified by reverse phase (water/acetonitrile) flash 
chromatography on a C18 column, yielding purified TMTD amine. This product was then 
reacted with ultrapure alginate follows: 1.5 g of UP-VLVG (1 equiv, > 60% G, ~25 kDa 
MW, NovaMatrix™) was dissolved in 45ml of water and 675 mg of 2-Chloro-4,6-
dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine (CDMT, 0.5 equiv) and 840 µL of N-Methylmorpholine (NMM, 1 
equiv) was added. Then 7.65 mmol of the TMTD amine was dissolved in 22.5 ml 
acetonitrile and added to the mixture. The reaction was stirred overnight at 55 °C. The 
solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the solid was dissolved in water. The 
solution was filtered through a pad of cyano functionalized silica (Silicycle) and the water 
was removed under reduced pressure to concentrate the solution. It was then dialyzed 
against a 10,000 MWCO membrane in DI water overnight. The water was removed under 
reduced pressure to give the functionalized alginate.
Fabrication of alginate hydrogel spheres and cell encapsulation
Prior to sphere fabrication, buffers were sterilized by autoclave and alginate solutions were 
sterilized by filtration through a 0.2 um filter. Aseptic processing was implemented for 
fabrication by performing capsule formation in a type II class A2 biosafety cabinet to 
maintain sterility of manufactured microcapsules/spheres for subsequent implantation. An 
electrostatic droplet generator was set up in the biosafety cabinet as follows: an ES series 0–
100 kV, 20 Watt high voltage power generator (Gamma ES series, Gamma High Voltage 
Research, FL, USA) is connected to the top and bottom of a blunt tipped needle (SAI 
Infusion Technologies, IL, USA).
This needle is attached to a 5 mL luer lock syringe (BD, NJ, USA) which is clipped to a 
syringe pump (Pump 11 Pico Plus, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) that is oriented vertically. 
The syringe pump pumps alginate out into a glass dish containing a 20 mM barium 5% 
mannitol solution (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). The settings of the PicoPlus syringe pump 
are 12.06 mm diameter and 0.2 mL/min flow rate. After the capsules are formed, they are 
then collected and then washed with HEPES buffer (NaCl 15.428g, KCl 0.70g, 
MgCl2*6H2O 0.488g, 50 mL of HEPES (1 M) buffer solution (Gibco, Life Technologies,

 California, USA) in 2L of DiH2O) 4 times. The alginate capsules are left overnight at 4 °C. 
The capsules are then washed 2 times in 0.8% saline and kept at 4 °C until use.
To solubilize alginates, SLG20 (NovaMatrix, Sandvika, Norway) was dissolved at 1.4% 
weight to volume in 0.8% saline. TMTD alginate was initially dissolved at 5% weight to 
volume in 0.8% saline, and then blended with 3% weight to volume SLG100 (also dissolved 
in 0.8% saline) at a volume ratio of 80% TMTD alginate to 20% SLG100.
For formation of 0.5 mm spheres were generated with a 25G blunt needle, a voltage of 5kV 
and a 200 µl/min flow rate. For formation of 1.5 mm spheres, an 18 gauge blunt tipped 
needle (SAI Infusion Technologies) was used with a voltage of 5–7 kV.
Immediately prior to encapsulation, the cultured SC-β clusters were centrifuged at 1,400 rpm 
for 1 minute and washed with Ca-free Krebs-Henseleit (KH) Buffer (4.7mM KCl, 25mM 
HEPES, 1.2mM KH2PO4, 1.2mM MgSO4×7H2O, 135mM NaCl, pH≈7.4, ≈290 mOsm). 
After washing, SC-β cells were centrifuged again and all supernatant was aspirated. The SC-
β pellet was then re-suspended in the SLG20 or TMTD alginate solutions (described above) 
at cluster densities of 1,000, 250, and 100 clusters per 0.5 ml alginate solution. Spheres were 
crosslinked using a BaCl2 gelling solution and their sizes were controlled as described 
above. Immediately after crosslinking, the encapsulated SC-β clusters were washed 4 times 
with 50 mL of CMRLM media and cultured overnight in a spinner flask at 37°C prior to 
transplantation. Due to an inevitable loss of SC-β clusters during the encapsulation process, 
the total number of encapsulated clusters were recounted post-encapsulation
Transplantation surgeries
All animal protocols were approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care, and all surgical 
procedures and post-operative care was supervised by MIT Division of Comparative 
Medicine veterinary staff. Immune-competent male (6–14 weeks of age) STZ-induced 
diabetic C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) or male (6–10 weeks of age) 
B6.129S6-Ccr6tm1(EGFP)Irw/J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were 
anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in oxygen and had their abdomens shaved and sterilized 
using betadine and isopropanol. Preoperatively, all mice also received a 0.05 mg/kg dose of 
buprenorphine subcutaneously as a pre-surgical analgesic, along with 0.3 mL of 0.9% saline 
subcutaneously to prevent dehydration. A 0.5 mm incision was made along the midline of 
the abdomen and the peritoneal lining was exposed using blunt dissection. The peritoneal 
wall was then grasped with forceps and a 0.5–1 mm incision was made along the linea alba. 
A desired volume of spheres (all materials without islets, as well as SLG20 spheres 
encapsulating rat islets) were then loaded into a sterile pipette and implanted into the 
peritoneal cavity through the incision. The incision was then closed using 5-0 taper-tipped 
polydioxanone (PDS II) absorbable sutures. The skin was then closed over the incision using 
a wound clip and tissue glue.
Blood glucose monitoring
To create insulin-dependent diabetic mice, healthy C57BL/6J mice were treated with 
Streptozotocin (STZ) by the vendor (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) prior to shipment 
to MIT. The blood glucose levels of all the mice were retested prior to transplantation. Only

 mice whose 1 hour-fasted blood glucose levels were above 400 mg/dL for two consecutive 
days were considered diabetic and underwent transplantation.
Blood glucose levels were monitored two to three times a week following transplantation of 
islet-containing alginate capsules. To measure the blood glucose of animals we used 
clinically approved and commercially available handheld glucose meters (Clarity One, 
Clarity Diagnostic Test Group, Boca Raton, FL) with a measurement range of 0–600 mg/dL. 
These readers only require very low volumes of blood, (< 2 µl) making it feasible for us to 
perform multiple blood glucose measurements per week from mice. A small drop of blood 
was collected from the tail vein using a lancet and tested using a commercial glucometer 
(Clarity One, Clarity Diagnostic Test Group, Boca Raton, FL). Mice with unfasted blood 
glucose levels below 200 mg/dL were considered normoglycemic. Monitoring continued 
until experimental time points had been reached, at which point they were euthanized and 
the spheres were retrieved.
Human c-peptide monitoring
Human c-peptide levels were monitored every three weeks following transplantation of SC-β 
containing alginate capsules. Mice were fasted for 1 hour before blood collection, at which 
point approximately 100–150 µL of blood was collected retro-orbitally into a serum 
collection tube. Collected blood was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13000 rpm, serum was 
removed, and stored at 20 °C until assayed. Serum was assayed for human c-peptide using 
the Alpco human c-peptide kit (Catalog #: 80-CPTHU-E10) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
Retrieval of cells, tissues, and materials
At desired time points post-implantation or transplantation (with encapsulated islets), as 
specified in figures, mice were euthanized by CO2 administration, followed by cervical 
dislocation. In certain instances, 5 ml of ice cold PBS was first injected in order perform an 
intraperitoneal lavage to rinse out and collect free-floating intraperitoneal immune cells. An 
incision was then made using the forceps and scissors along the abdomen skin and 
peritoneal wall, and intraperitoneal lavage volumes were pipetted out into fresh 15 ml falcon 
tubes (each prepared with 5 ml of RPMI cell culture media). Next, a wash bottle tip was 
inserted into the abdominal cavity. KREBS buffer was then used to wash out all material 
spheres from the abdomen and into petri dishes for collection. After ensuring all the spheres 
were washed out or manually retrieved (if fibrosed directly to intraperitoneal tissues), they 
were transferred into 50 mL conical tubes for downstream processing and imaging. After 
intraperitoneal lavage and sphere retrieval, remaining fibrosed tissues were also excised for 
downstream FACS and expression analyses.
Imaging of the retrieved material spheres
For phase contrast imaging retrieved materials were gently washed using Krebs buffer and 
transferred into 35 mm petri dishes for phase contrast microscopy using an Evos Xl 
microscope (Advanced Microscopy Group).

 For bright-field imaging of retrieved materials, samples were gently washed using Krebs 
buffer and transferred into 35 mm petri dishes for bright-field imaging using a Leica 
Stereoscopic microscope.
Confocal Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence imaging was used to determine immune populations attached to 
spheres. Materials were retrieved from mice and fixed overnight using 4% paraformaldehyde 
at 4°C. Samples where then washed twice with KREBS buffer, permeabilized for 30 min 
using a 0.1% Triton X100 solution, and subsequently blocked for 1 hour using a 1% bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) solution. Next, the spheres were incubated for 1 hour in an 
immunostaining cocktail solution consisting of DAPI (500 nM), specific marker probes 
(1:200 dilution) in BSA. After staining, spheres were washed three times with a 0.1% Tween 
20 solution and maintained in a 50% glycerol solution. Spheres were then transferred to 
glass bottom dishes and imaged using an LSM 700 point scanning confocal microscope 
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena Germany) equipped with 5 and 10× objectives. Obtained 
images where adjusted linearly for presentation using Photoshop (Adobe Inc. Seattle, WA).
Proteomic Analysis
For this assay four samples were randomly selected from each treatment group for protein 
analysis.
Reduction, Alkylation and Tryptic Digestion—Retrieved samples were suspended in 
urea cell lysis buffer (8 M urea, Tris pH 8.0) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Equivalent 
amounts of protein were reduced (10 mM dithiothreitol, 56 °C for 45 min) and alkylated (50 
mM iodoacetamide, room temperature in the dark for 1 h). Proteins were subsequently 
digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI), at an enzyme/substrate 
ratio of 1:50, at room temperature overnight in 100 mM ammonium acetate pH 8.9. Trypsin 
activity was quenched by adding formic acid to a final concentration of 5%. Peptides were 
desalted using C18 SpinTips (Protea, Morgantown, WV) then lyophilized and stored at 
−80 °C.
TMT Labeling—Peptides were labeled with TMT 6plex (Thermo) per manufacturer’s 
instructions. Lyophilized samples were dissolved in 70 µL ethanol and 30 µl of 500 mM 
triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and the TMT reagent was dissolved in 30 µl of 
anhydrous acetonitrile. The solution containing peptides and TMT reagent was vortexed, 
incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Samples labeled with the six different isotopic TMT 
reagents were combined and concentrated to completion in a vacuum centrifuge. For the first 
analysis samples were labeled using the TMT 6plex channels as follows: 126 – TMTD-1.5 
biological replicate 1; 127- TMTD-1.5 biological replicate 2; 128 – SLG-1.5 biological 
replicate 1; 129 – SLG-1.5 biological replicate 2; 130 – SLG-0.5 250 biological replicate 1; 
and 131 – SLG-0.5 biological replicate 2. For the second analysis samples were labeled 
using the TMT 6plex channels as follows: 126 – TMTD-1.5 biological replicate 3; 127- 
TMTD-1.5 biological replicate 4; 128 – SLG-1.5 biological replicate 3; 129 – SLG-1.5 
biological replicate 4; 130 – SLG-0.5 biological replicate 3; and 131 – SLG- 0.5 biological 
replicate 4.

 LC-MS/MS—Peptides were then loaded on a precolumn and separated by reverse phase 
HPLC (Thermo Easy nLC1000) over a 140 minute gradient before nanoelectrospray using a 
QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-
dependent mode. The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 70,000 across 
350–2000 m/z, AGC 3e6, and maximum IT 50 ms. The full MS scan was followed by 
MS/MS for the top 10 precursor ions in each cycle with a NCE of 32 and dynamic exclusion 
of 30 s. Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Proteome Discoverer 
(Thermo) and Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science). Mascot search parameters were: 10 
ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.8 Dathe fragment ion mass tolerance; 2 missed 
cleavages of trypsin; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine; variable 
modification was methionine oxidation. TMT quantification was obtained using Proteome 
Discoverer and isotopically corrected per manufacturer’s instructions.
Histological processing for H&E and Masson’s Trichrome staining
Retrieved materials where fixed overnight using 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. After 
fixation, alginate sphere or retrieved tissue samples were washed using 70% alcohol. The 
materials where then mixed with 4 degrees calcium-cooled Histogel (VWR, CA # 
60872-486). After the molds hardened, the blocks were processed for paraffin embedding, 
sectioning and staining according to standard histological methods.
Histological immunostaining
Parafin embedded sectioned samples were stained for the following: human insulin (Anti-
insulin cat# ab7842, abcam), human c-peptide (C-peptide cat #GN-1D4, Developmental 
Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), NKX 6.1 (cat # F55A12, Developmental 
Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), human glucagon (Anti-Glucagon cat# 
ab82270, abcam). Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Parafin slides were deparaffinized through subsequent incubations in the following solvents 
(Xylene 5min 2× 100% ETOH 2min ×2 95% 2 min ×2 70% 2min ×2 d-water). Antigen 
retrieval was done by incubating sections for 30min in ice cooled PBS, and then blocking 
with 3% horse serum to block for 30 min. Antibody mixtures were then applied as follows: 
Primary A - Mix together KKX 6.1, 1 to 500 3% & horse serum and c-peptide, 1 to 500. 
Primary B - Mix together Human insulin 1 to 500 and glucagon 1 to 200, incubate for 2 
hours and then Wash in PBS 10min×4. Secondary A - Add anti-mouse AF594 1 to 500 and 
anti-rat AF488 1 to 500. Secondary B - Add anti-guinea pig AF488 1 to 500 with anti-
mouse AF594 1 to 500 incubate for 30min then wash 10min 4×. Slides were then stained 
with DAPI and coverslips mounted using prolong gold antifade (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA)
Western Blotting
Protein was extracted directly from materials for western blot analysis. For protein analyses, 
retrieved materials were prepared by immersing materials in Pierce RIPA buffer (Cat. 
#89901, Thermo Scientific) with protease inhibitors (Halt Protease inhibitor single-use 
cocktail, Cat. #78430, Thermo Scientific) on ice, and then lysed by sonication (for 30 
seconds on, 30 seconds off, twice at 70% amplitude). Samples were then subjected to

 constant agitation for 2 hours at 4°C. Lysates were then centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 
rpm at 4°C, and protein-containing supernatants were collected in fresh tubes kept on ice. In 
samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat (a top layer on the supernatant) was first removed 
before supernatant transfer. 20 µg protein (quantified by BCA assay, Pierce BCA protein 
assay kit, Cat. #23225, Thermo Scientific) for each lane was boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and 
electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Any kD 15-well comb mini-gel, Biorad, Cat. 
#456-9036) and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad, Cat. #162-0213). Blots 
were probed with anti-αSmooth Muscle actin antibody (1:400 dilution, Rabbit polyclonal to 
alpha smooth muscle actin; Cat. #ab5694, AbCam), and anti-β-actin antibody (1:4000 
dilution, monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody produced in mouse; Cat. #A1978, Sigma Aldrich) 
as a loading control followed by donkey anti-rabbit (1:15,000 dilution, Cat. #926-32213, Li-
Cor) and goat anti-mouse (1:15,000 dilution, Cat. #926-68070, Li-Cor) fluorophore-
conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using 
Odyssey detection (Li-Cor, Serial No. ODY-2329) at 700 and 800 nm wavelengths.
FACS analysis
Single-cell suspensions of cells from the surfaces of freshly retrieved capsules were prepared 
using a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Single-cell suspensions were prepared in a passive PEB 
dissociation buffer (1X PBS, pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, and 2 mM EDTA) and suspensions were 
passed through 70 µm filters (Cat. #22363548, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). This 
process removed the majority of cells adhered to the surface (>90%). The cells were then 
centrifuged at 300–400g at 4°C and resuspended in a minimal volume (~50 µl) of 
eBioscience Staining Buffer (Cat. #00-4222) for antibody incubation. All samples were then 
co-stained in the dark for 25 min at 4°C with two of the fluorescently tagged monoclonal 
antibodies specific for the cell markers CD68 (1 µl (0.5 µg) per sample; CD68-Alexa647, 
Clone FA-11, Cat. #11-5931, BioLegend), Ly-6G (Gr-1) (1 µl (0.5 µg) per sample; Ly-6G-
Alexa-647, Clone RB6-8C5, Cat. #108418, BioLegend), CD11b (1 µl (0.5 µg) per sample; 
or CD11b-Alexa-488, Clone M1/70, Cat. #101217, BioLegend), CD19 (1 µl (0.5 µg) per 
sample; CD19-Alexa-647, Clone 6D5, Cat. #115522, BioLegend), IgM (1 µl (0.5 µg) per 
sample; IgM-FITC, Clone RMM-1, Cat. #406506, BioLegend), CD8 (1 µl (0.5 µg) per 
sample; CD8-Alexa647, Clone 53-6.7, Cat. #100724, BioLegend), or NK1.1 (1 µl (0.5 µg) 
per sample; NK1.1-Alexa488, Clone PK136, Cat. #108718, BioLegend). Two ml of 
eBioscience Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer (Cat. #00-4222, eBioscience) was then added, 
and the samples were centrifuged at 400–500g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants were removed 
by aspiration, and this wash step was repeated two more times with staining buffer. 
Following the third wash, each sample was resuspended in 500 µl of Flow Cytometry 
Staining Buffer and run through a 40 µm filter (Cat. #22363547, Fisher Scientific) for 
eventual FACS analysis using a BD FACSCalibur (Cat. #342975), BD Biosciences, San 
Jose, CA, USA). For proper background and laser intensity settings, unstained, single 
antibody, and IgG (labeled with either Alexa-488 or Alexa- 647, BioLegend) controls were 
also run.

 Intravital Imaging
For intravital imaging, SC-β containing hydrogels of 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm sizes were 
fabricated with Qdot 605 (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY) and surgically implanted 
into B6.129S6- Ccr6tm1(EGFP)Irw/J mice as described above. After 14 days post implantation, 
the mice were placed under isoflurane anesthesia and a small incision was made at the site 
of the original surgery to expose beads. The mice were placed on an inverted microscope 
and imaged using a 25×, N.A. 1.05 objective on an Olympus FVB-1000 MP multiphoton 
microscope at an excitation wavelength of 860 nm. Z-stacks of 200 µm (10 µm steps) were 
acquired at 2-minute intervals for time series of 20 – 45 minutes depending on the image. 
The mice were kept under constant isoflurane anesthesia and monitored throughout the 
imaging session. Obtained images were analyzed using Velocity 3D Image Analysis 
Software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).
In vivo glucose challenges (GSIS)
Mice were fasted overnight (12 hours) prior to glucose challenge. On the day of the 
challenge, fasting blood glucose levels were measured and then mice were injected via tail-
vein with a 30 g/L solution of glucose at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Blood glucose was then 
monitored every 15 minutes for 2 hours.
Pancreas removal and insulin quantification
After 174 days, mice treated with SC-β cells encapsulated in TMTD-alginate were 
euthanized and the pancreas of each mouse removed. Each pancreas was weighed and then 
placed into vial with a stainless steel ball while keeping samples frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 
volume of 3 ml of acid ethanol was added to each vial and samples were homogenized on a 
GenoGrinder at 1000 rpm at 1 min increments until tissue was pulverized. Sample vials are 
held by aluminum blocks that can be placed in liquid nitrogen between each cycle to keep it 
cold. Vials were then centrifuged at 2400 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant (now 
containing insulin) was removed and stored, while the vial is filled with more acid ethanol 
and vortexed. The vials were left overnight shaking at 4°C. Again, vials were centrifuged at 
2400 rpm at 4°C for 30 min and the supernatant was collected and added to the previously 
stored supernatant. Acid ethanol was again added to the vials, vortexed, incubated overnight, 
centrifuged, and supernatant collected and combined. Supernatant solution was evaporated 
using a Genevac EZ-2 plus. Samples were stored at −80°C until used. Prior to insulin 
quantification, samples were resuspended in PBS and quantified using a mouse insulin 
ELISA kit (Alpco catalog #: 80-INSMS-E10) according to manufacturer’s instructions. This 
same procedure was repeated for healthy, wild type C57BL/6J mice and a STZ treated 
C57BL/6J mice.

SC-β cells encapsulated with TMTD alginate sustain normoglycemia in STZ-treated 
immune competent C57BL/6J mice. (a) SC-β cells were generated using the differentiation 
protocol described4. FACS analysis shows surface markers on cells at indicated 
differentiation stages. Data is representative of 10 separate differentiations from the HUES8 
stem cell line. (Editor: Stage 1–3 is previously described4 and not relevant to this 
manuscript) (b) Brightfield images of encapsulated SC-β cells.. Scale bar = 400 µm, N = 15. 
(c–e) SC-β cells encapsulated as shown in (b) were transplanted into the intraperitoneal 
space of STZ-treated C57BL/6 mice, and blood glucose concentrations were measured at 
indicated times. (c) 500 µm SLG20 alginate microcapsules; (d) 1.5 mm SLG20 alginate 
microspheres; (e) 1.5 mm TMTD alginate spheres. Three different doses of cell clusters 
(100, 250, and 1000 cluster per mouse) were implanted under each encapsulation condition. 
The red dashed line indicates the blood glucose cutoff for normoglycemia in mice. For 
reference 250 clusters equates to approximately 1 million cells. Error bars, mean ± s.e.m. 
Quantitative data shown is the average of N = 5 mice per treatment. All experiments were 
repeated three times for a total of N = 15 mice per treatment.
