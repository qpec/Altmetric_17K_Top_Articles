Mortality in the United States is 18% higher than in Costa Rica
among adult men and 10% higher among middle-aged women,
despite the several times higher income and health expenditures
of the United States. This comparison simultaneously shows the
potential for substantially lowering mortality in other middle-
income countries and highlights the United States’ poor health
performance. The United States’ underperformance is strongly
linked to its much steeper socioeconomic (SES) gradients in health.
Although the highest SES quartile in the United States has better
mortality than the highest quartile in Costa Rica, US mortality in its
lowest quartile is markedly worse than in Costa Rica’s lowest quar-
tile, providing powerful evidence that the US health inequality
patterns are not inevitable. High SES-mortality gradients in the
United States are apparent in all broad cause-of-death groups,
but Costa Rica’s overall mortality advantage can be explained
largely by two causes of death: lung cancer and heart disease.
Lung cancer mortality in the United States is four times higher
among men and six times higher among women compared with
Costa Rica. Mortality by heart disease is 54% and 12% higher in
the United States than in Costa Rica for men and women, respec-
tively. SES gradients for heart disease and diabetes mortality are
also much steeper in the United States. These patterns may be
partly explained by much steeper SES gradients in the United
States compared with Costa Rica for behavioral and medical risk
factors such as smoking, obesity, lack of health insurance, and
uncontrolled dysglycemia and hypertension.

C
osta Rica has higher life expectancy than the United States
even though its per capita income and its health expenditure
are small fractions of those in the United States (1). The purpose
of this article is to contribute to explaining why Costa Rica out-
performs the US in life expectancy at older adult ages, which are
the ages in which Costa Rican health achievements are most im-
pressive (2). The article focuses on economic inequality, smoking,
and obesity as important explanatory factors in this comparison,
following related research that has shown that these are strong
factors related to the relatively poor performance of life ex-
pectancy in the United States compared with other high-income
countries (3). It also addresses the relative explanatory importance
of health care systems and behavioral factors in the two countries.
Comparing health and mortality in these two countries may
help to identify pathways for improving health even under sub-
optimal economic circumstances, as well as help to improve tar-
geting of health interventions in high-income settings. A recent
series of reports by the National Academy of Sciences Panel on
Understanding Divergent Trends in Longevity in High-Income
Countries have summarized an impressive evidence base that help
to understand why US life expectancy lags those of other wealthy
countries (3–5). However, this research literature has overlooked
the potentially more striking comparisons with countries that wield
many fewer resources. Costa Rica is one of a handful of middle-
income countries in which the availability of data allows this type
of more striking comparison.
It is well established that economic development brings about
higher life expectancy to countries (6). Although health tech-
nologies have allowed extraordinary health improvements in-
dependent of economic development (7), a strong relationship
persists as shown in Fig. 1, which was built with World Bank data
for the 5-y period before the Great Recession and with per capita
gross domestic product purchasing power (GDP-PPP) as the
indicator of economic well-being. Less prosperous countries with
GDP of $1,000–2,000 per capita have life expectancies of about
60 y, whereas rich countries with about $40,000 GDP have life
expectancies close to 80 y. The correlation is not perfect but it is
high: 0.83 for the 178 countries in the figure. Particularly in-
teresting are those countries whose health indicator substantially
outperforms expectations—those above the prediction line in
Fig. 1—in contrast with underachievers below the prediction
line. Costa Rica, with a life expectancy at birth of 78.5 y, is a clear
health overachiever given its GDP-PPP of $9,200, an income
level at which the norm is a life expectancy of about 72 y according
to the prediction curve and according to what is observed in
countries such as Iran or Romania. The life expectancy in Costa
Rica is at a level expected for economies with a GDP of about
$40,000, closer to the United States, which slightly underachieves
expectations with a life expectancy of 77.4 y, 1 y lower than Costa
Rica (Fig. 1). Other overachievers identified in Fig. 1 are Vietnam,
Israel, and Japan, whereas South Africa, the Russian Federation,
and Kuwait are examples of clear underachievers.
The outstanding health indicators of Costa Rica have been
known for decades. The country was included, for example, as
one of the four study cases in the 1985 Rockefeller Foundation
report on ’’Good Health at Low Cost” (8). Although historical
data suggest that Costa Rica has had higher life expectancy than
the Latin American average since the early 20th century, it is in
the decade of the 1970s when the country essentially closed the
gap in life expectancy with high-income countries (9).
Significance
Recent National Academies of Sciences reports have summa-
rized evidence to understand why US health indicators lag
those of other countries, in an effort to explore the funda-
mental question of why some populations live longer than
others. However, this literature has failed to engage in the
potentially more striking comparisons with countries that out-
perform the United States despite wielding many fewer re-
sources. Costa Rica is one of a handful of middle-income
countries with data to conduct this comparison. The finding
that socioeconomic inequality in mortality is wider in the
United States than in Costa Rica, and that people lower on the
hierarchy in Costa Rica live longer than people in the equiva-
lent position in the United States, is startling.

 Costa Rica, a small Central American country comparable to
the states of South Carolina or Kentucky in territory and pop-
ulation size, is also known for being the oldest democracy in
Latin America, with a government that invests substantially in
social redistributive programs. These investments have in part
been enabled by eliminating the financial burden of military
expenditures after abolishing its armed forces in its 1949 Con-
stitution (10–12). However, income distribution is not particu-
larly egalitarian in Costa Rica. Its Gini index of 0.52 in 2012 is
similar to other countries in Latin America (e.g., Mexico, 0.51;
Chile, 0.52; Brazil, 0.53), which is the least egalitarian region in
the world. The Costa Rican Gini is also higher than the US Gini
of 0.40, which itself is higher than in most high-income countries
such as Sweden (0.25), Germany (0.30), or Japan (0.32) (13).
In contrast to the low financial access and fragmented health
care for low socioeconomic status (SES) adults under age 65 in
the United States (after age 65, essentially all US residents are
covered by Medicare insurance), Costa Rica has a single national
health insurance system that covers the vast majority of residents.
According to the 2011 census, 86% of Costa Ricans (96% of older
adults) are covered by the public health insurance and care system
known as the CCSS. The few uninsured individuals (largely a self-
selected healthier group) can obtain health care from the CCSS
for a subsidized fee or no fee if social workers verify that a patient
has no means of paying. The high health insurance and health care
coverage of Costa Rica is achieved at a fraction of the cost of
health care in the United States: health expenditures per capita in
the United States are about 10 times as high as in Costa Rica (1).
Delivery of primary health care, particularly to remote or poor
populations, has been singled out as a key factor to reduce mor-
tality in Costa Rica (14). We do not readily have data to assess the
relative quality of public health care services in Costa Rica com-
pared with the United States, but effectiveness appears high in
providing preventive and basic care such as vaccinations and in
controlling traditional communicable diseases such as tuberculosis
and malaria. However, the role of health system differences in
explaining international differences in mortality is uncertain, with
at best mixed research evidence. The recent National Research
Council studies of US health in international comparative perspec-
tive have noted that many of the health differences may originate
from social factors outside of the medical care system (5). Fur-
thermore, although cardiovascular mortality is comparatively
elevated in the United States, cardiovascular health care is gen-
erally better than in many other countries. Nevertheless, there are
well-documented disparities in access to care in the United States
for low-income populations; thus, it is plausible that the frag-
mented health care system could contribute to elevated mortality
among low SES populations in the United States.
High health inequalities by SES, race, and geography have
been singled out among the factors that explain the relatively poor
performance of life expectancy in the United States (15). More
precisely, low-SES individuals in the United States, African
Americans, and residents in some areas, such as the District of
Columbia, have very low levels of life expectancy that are un-
usual among developed countries. Other factors identified as
dragging down life expectancy in the United States are smoking
and, less clearly, obesity. These other health risks also have a
strong SES gradient in the United States (16).
Earlier research has shown that in Costa Rica SES disparities
in adult health are small, null, or even contrary to the expected
negative SES gradients (17). This article systematically compares
the SES gradients in adult mortality and health risk factors in
newly compiled Costa Rican data with comparable data in the
United States, namely the National Longitudinal Mortality Studies
(NLMS) in the two countries, the Costa Rican Longevity and
Healthy Aging Study (CRELES), and the US National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Results
The NLMS samples estimate reasonably well the mortality of the
population in both countries as shown by the overlap of the
confidence intervals of the samples’ estimates with the population-
based curve (18, 19) in most ages in Fig. 2. The exceptions are the
US estimates after age 80, which are significantly lower than the
population rates, possibly because of institutionalized individuals
being excluded in the US-NLMS sampling.
Fig. 2 also shows that male mortality is clearly lower in Costa
Rica than in the United States at all adult ages above 55 y, according
to both vital statistics and the NLMS samples. In contrast, the
differences between the two countries in female mortality are
less clear and vary by age and data source.
The NLMS samples show that Costa Rican male mortality is
0.85 (95% CI: 0.80–0.90) relative to the United States, or an 18%
higher mortality rate in the United States (Table 1). Among
females, mortality is an insignificantly 4% higher in Costa Rica.
Distinguishing the rates before and after 65 y of age is of interest
given that the Medicare plan in the United States begins uni-
versal health insurance only starting at this age (by contrast,
Costa Ricans are eligible for universal insurance at all ages). The
estimates for women are consistent with a relative mortality
improvement after age 65 in the United States: women in the
United States have 10% higher mortality than in Costa Rica before
age 65 and 8% lower mortality after this age. However, this relative
improvement in US health with age is not present (or is hidden by
other factors) in the comparison of males: the mortality disad-
vantage of US men is larger (22% higher mortality) after age 65
than before this age (11%). Consistent with other evidence, this
suggests that health insurance is not the major determinant of
these patterns.
Causes of Death. Two cause-of-death groups explain all of the
mortality advantage of Costa Rican men compared with the
United States: lung cancer and heart disease. The death rate
ratios (DRRs) in Table 1 indicate that US men have four times
higher risk of dying by lung cancer and 54% higher risk of dying
by heart diseases than Costa Rican men. If mortality by these two
causes of death was the same in the two countries, Costa Rican
men would have 13% higher general mortality than US men.
Lung cancer is important as a marker of the mortality effect of
smoking (20), and heart diseases are important due to causing
about one-third of deaths at these ages. The large Costa Rican
advantage in these two cause-of-death groups is in part coun-
terbalanced by excess mortality of Costa Rican men by cerebro-
vascular conditions or stroke (DRR of 1.38), diabetes (1.30), and
external injuries (1.34).
Costa Rican men also have a significant 28% lower mortality
by communicable diseases (mostly influenza), possibly because
of the more favorable weather of the tropics. However, this ad-
vantage has only a minor impact on life expectancy given that
communicable diseases now represent only about 5% of deaths;
the fact that Costa Rica has been able to essentially control its

INAUGURAL ARTICLE
 mortality by infectious diseases is a notable public health achieve-
ment. Not long ago, near three-fourths of Costa Rican deaths
were caused by communicable diseases such as diarrhea, malaria,
and tuberculosis (21).
Women in Costa Rican have a large advantage—larger than
men—in lung cancer mortality, which is one-sixth that of the
United States. However, women’s advantage in heart disease
mortality (DRR of 0.85) is not as large as that of men (0.60). The
advantage of Costa Rican women in these two causes of death is
more than counterbalanced by significantly higher mortality by
stroke (32% higher death rate), external injuries (59%), and
chronic respiratory diseases (59%). The higher Costa Rican
mortality by stroke among both men and women is a topic for
further research. The higher mortality by external injuries comes
from a poorer physical and institutional infrastructure to prevent
and treat accidents. The higher female mortality by respiratory
conditions is possibly a consequence of firewood cooking until
recent times in rural areas.
There are no significant differences between Costa Rica and
the United States in the mortality of the residual group of other
causes of death, which includes ill-defined diseases. This result
suggests that any concerns regarding differential quality across
the two countries in coding cause of death is not driving the
overall results.
Prevalence of Health Risk Factors. The comparison of prevalence of
selected health risk factors with data from CRELES and NHANES
surveys (Table 2) yield clues about the proximate determinants of
mortality and health in the two countries.
The lack of access to health care as measured by the pro-
portion uninsured at ages 55–64 is similar for men in the two
countries (13%) and lower for women in Costa Rica (5%) than
in the United States (14%). The ratio of people with controlled
to uncontrolled high blood pressure or dyslipidemia, which is
higher in the United States than in Costa Rica, suggests that the
high-coverage Costa Rican system is less effective in controlling
these chronic conditions. However, the degree of control of di-
abetes is similar in the two countries, suggesting Costa Rican
chronic disease management success in some domains. The
proportion with very high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an
objective marker of body inflammation in response to infections
and other diseases, is also identical in the two counties: 7% for
men and 11% for women.
Family support, in the form of living arrangements, appears
higher in Costa Rica than in the United States. Although 23% of

 women ages 55–79 y live alone in the United States, only 8% live
alone in Costa Rica. Moreover, in Costa Rica, most older adults
(near 70% in this sample) live in households of three or more
members, primarily with adult children, compared with only
about 25% in the United States. Additionally, if the proportion
with short telomeres in blood cells is taken as partially reflecting
stress, the data suggest that Costa Ricans may live under less
stressful circumstances than their US counterparts, especially
women (17% vs. 25% short telomeres).
The lower Costa Rican prevalence of obesity, sedentariness,
and dyslipidemia suggests healthier lifestyles, especially among
men in this country. This lifestyle advantage is not present among
Costa Rican women, who additionally show higher prevalence of
high blood pressure and diabetes, which in part could originate
in the high fertility levels that were common until recently in
Costa Rica.
A key lifestyle factor that appears favorable in Costa Rica is
smoking. Prevalence of past and current smoking is clearly lower
among women in Costa Rica than in the United States (which
also means lower secondhand smoking for men). Although there
are not significant differences in the reported prevalence of
smoking by men of the two countries, the substantially lower lung
cancer mortality of Costa Ricans pointed out before suggests
that smoking lifestyles (possibly including intensity of smoking
and secondhand smoke consumption) are less harmful among
men in Costa Rica than in the United States.
Inequality. We rank individuals by sorting them out in each
country according to their years of education and, as a second
criteria, by their household income level (wealth in Costa Rica).
Costa Ricans in the lowest SES rank quartile have significantly
lower age-adjusted mortality than their counterparts in the
United States (Fig. 3). By contrast, in the highest SES quartile
the United States has lower mortality at ages below 65 y. In the
two intermediate SES quartiles, there is no significant mortality
difference between the two countries, nor is there in the highest
quartile above age 65.
From a life expectancy standpoint, it is thus better to live in
Costa Rica for low-SES individuals, whereas it is better to live in
the United States for high-SES people younger than 65 y. This
Costa Rican advantage is a striking result given the large differences
in living standards between the two countries for individuals at the
same relative SES ranks, especially at low-SES levels. Taking, for
example, the most easily comparable indicator across countries—
human capital as measured by educational attainment—the lowest
SES quartile in the United States includes mostly high school
dropouts, whereas in Costa Rica, it is composed of people with only
0–3 y of primary school. In the highest SES quartile, US adults
are predominantly college graduates, whereas few of the corre-
sponding Costa Ricans have education above high school. It is
important to note, however, that this association does not imply
that it is the education or income—the two components of our
SES measure—itself that is exerting a direct causal influence on
mortality; instead, the mortality risk could well be driven in-
directly by other policy, environmental, or lifestyle risk factors
that disproportionately affect low-SES populations.
The smoothed regression lines in Fig. 3 show that linear trends
adequately represent the SES gradients on mortality, and thus
we can use a single index—the relative inequality index (RII)—
to describe the level of inequality in mortality in each population.
The slope of the regression-adjusted lines in Fig. 3 measures the
RII, which shows that mortality inequality is substantially higher
in the United States than in Costa Rica, especially before age 65.
Adults younger than 65 who are at the bottom of the SES rank
die at a rate 3.4 times higher than those at the upper ranks of
SES in the United States as measured by the RII. In contrast, the
corresponding RII in Costa Rica is only 1.5. The US SES gra-
dient in mortality falls substantially to an RII of 1.6 in ages 65
and over, whereas in Costa Rica, there is practically no gradient
(RII of 1.1) at these ages.
Racial and geographical differences in such a big and diverse
country as the United States could be confounding our estimates
of SES-driven mortality inequality. We check this possibility by
estimating the RII in the United States by ethnic groups and
states and by controlling in regression models the effect of state
of residence. The original RII of 3.4 estimated for adults below
age 65 is similar when estimated just for the white non-Hispanic
population (RII = 3.0). Similarly, the estimate is essentially un-
changed after controlling for 49 state of residence dummy vari-
ables in the regression model (RII = 3.3). In the state of Hawaii,
which has the highest life expectancy of the United States and
some similarities with Costa Rica’s climate, the RII is still a very
high 3.0. In Florida, another state with high life expectancy and
some similarities with Costa Rica, the RII is 3.8. The one US
subgroup within which a steep mortality gradient is not observed
is the Hispanic population, which has an RII of 1.5, identical to
Costa Rica.
Taking SES as a health risk factor and estimating its pop-
ulation attributable fraction (PAF) provides further information
for public policy purposes. If mortality inequalities by SES
quartiles were eliminated and the entire population had the
mortality of the highest SES quartile, the national mortality rate
would fall by 25% in the United States and 9% in Costa Rica,

 which would erase the entire adult mortality advantage of Costa
Rica over the United States.
Table 3 shows the RII in the two countries disaggregated by
sex and nine groups of cause of death. The RII falls to about half
for older US adults ages 65–84 compared with ages 40–64, which
is consistent with past studies showing that at older ages SES
gradients in health are less steep (22, 23). Among Costa Ricans,
both male and female, the RII before and after age 65 does not
differ significantly; the reason for the differential RII effects by
age in the two countries remains a topic for future research.
Among Costa Rican men, the data show no significant SES gra-
dient (the confidence interval overlaps 1), especially at older ages.
The SES gradients by cause of death, as measured by the RII,
show that substantial inequality is present in the United States in
all nine cause-of-death groups. By contrast, in Costa Rica, the
RII is significantly higher than one only for three groups: cere-
brovascular, external injuries, and, especially, chronic respiratory
mortality. RII is significantly steeper in the United States than in
Costa Rica only in mortality caused by heart diseases and di-
abetes. Lung cancer mortality inequality is also substantially higher
in the United States, but the overlapping confidence intervals
suggest that this could be result of chance alone.
Inequality in Health Risk Factors. Table 4 compares inequality in
the health risk factors whose prevalence we described before.
The table shows the RII for the odds of being affected by each
health risk taken as a binary condition. Being uninsured (ages
55–64) has by far the highest SES gradients in the two countries.
Especially in the United States, those at the bottom of the SES
rank have 26.3 times higher odds of being uninsured compared
with those at the top of the SES rank. This OR is 3.9 in Costa
Rica. The uninsured prevalence in the lowest SES quartile is
35% in the United States compared with 15% in Costa Rica,
whereas it is about the same (about 5%) in the fourth SES quartile
in the two countries.
Additionally, current smoking and uncontrolled high levels of
blood sugar also show dramatic differences in the SES gradient
in the two countries: no SES gradients in Costa Rica compared
with steep gradients in the United States. Obesity and un-
controlled hypertension also show steeper SES gradients in the
United States compared with Costa Rica, although the di-
vergence is less severe than that observed for the proportions
uninsured, smoking, and being dysglycemic. The different SES
gradients usually are in a direction of relatively more favorable
health of low-SES Costa Ricans compared with low-SES US
adults. The exception is the proportion with uncontrolled high
levels of blood sugar (dysglycemia), which is slightly lower in
Costa Rica at low-SES levels, and it is substantially unfavorable
in Costa Rica compared with the United States at high-SES
levels (21% vs. 9% in the higher SES quartile).
Sedentariness is the only health risk in which low-SES indi-
viduals have a clear advantage over high-SES adults in the two
countries. The RII of sedentariness is 0.29 in the United States
and 0.23 in Costa Rica. If sedentariness is bad for health, it
would be attenuating the health advantage that high-SES indi-
viduals have in many other health risk factors in the two countries.
The SES gradients in 5 of the 11 factors in Table 4 do not
differ between the two countries and thus do not contribute to
the higher mortality inequality observed in the United States;
these are living alone, sedentariness, uncontrolled dyslipidemia,
high inflammation, and short telomeres.
Discussion
We found that adult mortality of men is 18% higher in the
United States than in Costa Rica, and this difference is larger
among men older than 65 y. Among women, US mortality is 10%
higher than in Costa Rica before age 65, but 8% lower after age
65. The simple fact that Costa Rica has achieved similar or lower
adult mortality than the United States is a singular achievement

 considering the vastly higher living standards and health expen-
ditures in the United States. This fact also provides a striking
contradiction to expected cross-national SES gradients in mortality
and strong evidence that the substantially lower life expectancy
in many middle-income countries is not inevitable.
From the many factors associated with mortality levels in the
two countries, SES gradients in mortality stand out as particu-
larly different. At the highest SES quartile, adult mortality is
higher in Costa Rica than in the United States, as expected
considering the large advantages in income and health infrastruc-
ture of the United States. However, at the lowest SES quartile,
Costa Rican mortality is substantially superior to that of the United
States: a relatively poor person in Costa Rica has lower mortality
than a relatively poor person in the United States. Our estimates of
the PAF for SES suggest that as much as 40% of deaths of middle-
aged adults in the United States and 20% of deaths at older ages
are statistically attributable to SES gradients. The corresponding
PAFs in Costa Rican men are 10% and 0%, respectively.
Why is health inequality lower in Costa Rica? It is not because
of a more equal income distribution (i.e., shorter economic
distances between SES extremes). Costa Rica’s Gini index of
income inequality, for example, is 0.52 in 2012, which compares
unfavorably to the US Gini of 0.40 (13).
One hypothesis is that it is related to the lifetime universal
health insurance with excellent primary care access in Costa
Rica, which provides a strong safety net for the poor in contrast
to the high uninsurance rates among the poor before age 65 in
the United States (24). The US reduction in health inequalities
after age 65 is consistent with this hypothesis, although there are
many competing clues beyond the scope of this paper that sug-
gest that United States uninsurance is likely to be at most a
limited factor (5). Furthermore, the Costa Rican system lacks
capabilities to provide highly specialized health care, and it
cannot even meet some basic standards as shown by the high
prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in Costa Rica compared
with the United States. Nevertheless, the Costa Rican system has
erased the typical disadvantage of developing societies regarding
communicable disease mortality through widespread availability of
cost-effective primary care and public health interventions, and
this has helped raise overall Costa Rican life expectancy into the
range of high income countries.
The story of health inequality is, however, more than just
about access to health care. Other populations with universal
health care systems still show high SES gradients in health out-
comes (24). Furthermore, the Hispanic population in the United
States shows modest SES gradients under the same health care
system that produces high health inequality in the rest of society
(25, 26). An important literature (27) postulates that psychoso-
cial pathways link social hierarchy and health above and beyond
material resources and access to health care. Those pathways
involve concepts such as stress, control over life, insecurity,
anxiety, social isolation, self-image, happiness, and depression.
The magnitude of such factors in explaining broad mortality
patterns is still poorly understood, however, and future work is
needed to investigate the importance of these factors in explaining
Costa Rican vs. US outcomes.
Further clues can be gleaned from examining relative gradi-
ents for different causes of death, as well as for key risk factors.
We estimated substantial SES gradients in the United States in
all cause-of-death groups and in many risk factors such as lack of
insurance, smoking, obesity, and uncontrolled dysglycemia and
hypertension. The existence of these multiple gradients is consistent
with the “theory of fundamental causes” that postulates that SES acts
through multiple pathways and on multiple disease outcomes because
higher-SES individuals have more of the multiple resources (money,
knowledge, power, prestige, connections, etc.) that allow them to
avoid health risks or to obtain effective health care (28). However,
this still begs the question as to why SES is less important in Costa
Rica, where SES-driven inequality is substantially lower than in
the United States in almost all of the studied dimensions.
A particularly informative finding is that the adult mortality
advantage of Costa Rica over the United States concentrates
primarily in two causes of death: lung cancer and heart disease.
Lung cancer mortality is four times higher among men and six
times higher among women in the United States compared with
Costa Rica. Mortality by heart disease is 54% and 12% higher in
the United States than in Costa Rica for men and women, re-
spectively. These results point to smoking as an important ex-
planatory factor of low adult mortality of Costa Rica, as it has
been in other international comparisons of mortality (20, 29).
Using the epidemiological method proposed by Peto et al. (30)
to estimate smoking-related mortality under the assumption that
lung cancer mortality is a reliable marker of the cumulative
damage of smoking exposure, we estimate that if smoking was
eradicated, the advantage in cardiovascular mortality of Costa
Rica over the United States would disappear for men, and it
would reverse into a 34% disadvantage for Costa Rican women.
In turn, chronic respiratory mortality would be six times higher
among Costa Rican women (instead of the observed 1.76 rate
ratio) if smoking was eliminated in the two countries. In terms of
remaining life expectancy at age 40, eradicating smoking would
completely erase the observed advantage of almost 2 y of Costa
Rican men, and it would amplify to 3 y the observed slight
advantage of US women.
The data on self-reported smoking show, however, a paradox
in the smoking effect: current and past reported exposure to
smoking is significantly higher in the United States only among
women. Reported exposure to smoking is about the same among
men in the two countries. A similar paradox has been observed
for the Hispanic population compared with other ethnic groups
in the United States: substantially lower lung cancer mortality
among Hispanic men but about the same reported past and
present prevalence of smoking. This apparent contradiction has
been explained by a duration and intensity of smoking that is lower
among Hispanics (31, 32) and by a second-hand smoking exposure
of Hispanic men that is substantially lower than non-Hispanics
given the very low smoking prevalence of Hispanic women. The
levels of cotinine (a marker of smoking exposure) in blood are
substantially lower among Hispanic smokers than smokers of
other ethnic groups in the United States: one-sixth of the level in
whites and one-seventh of blacks (33). We do not have cotinine
information for Costa Rica, but, given the similarity of outcomes,
it is plausible to hypothesize that the low level of exposure of US
Hispanic smokers could also occur among Costa Rican smokers.
Both the prevalence and SES gradient of obesity are also
substantially lower in Costa Rica than in the US male pop-
ulation, suggesting that obesity might be another important part
of the explanation of the favorable health outcomes of Costa
Rica. Important international differences in life expectancy of
high-income countries, and its time trend, have been linked to
Table 4.

SOCIAL SCIENCES
INAUGURAL ARTICLE
 obesity (34). It must be noted, however, that the magnitude of
obesity effects on mortality, especially at older ages, is a matter
of controversy (35–37). To illustrate the magnitude of the pos-
sible effect of obesity, we estimate that mortality of US men
would be 16% lower if they had the distribution by waist cir-
cumference observed in Costa Rica and if the all-cause mortality
associated with central obesity was of the magnitude estimated in
a meta-analysis of 18 longitudinal studies in white adults (38).
Under those assumptions, the differences in central obesity
would be sufficient by itself to statistically explain all of the Costa
Rican male mortality advantage.
Thus, overall, an important part of the higher mortality of low-
SES individuals existing in the US appears to be linked to un-
healthy lifestyle factors, including smoking and obesity.
A known limitation of estimates of SES effects on health is
reverse causation: some individuals fall into low-SES ranks be-
cause of their poor health. If that was the case, then the high
negative SES association with poor health in the United States
might be spurious. However, substantial research suggests that
the effects are not spurious, but rather may reflect long-term
effects of low SES that operate via myriad pathways (39).
Using relative SES rank scales in each country may also lead to
different inferences than when using an absolute socioeconomic
indicator. To check the sensitivity of our results to this choice, we
estimated the effect of education as an absolute scale for the two
countries. Fourteen fewer years of education—the approximate
entire rank of this indicator—would increase US mortality by a
factor of 2.9 and 1.6 in ages 40–64 and 65–89, respectively. These
figures are similar to the RII estimated with the relative SES
scale: 3.4 and 1.6. The effects of 14 y of education in the two age
groups in Costa Rica mortality are 1.5 and 1.2, identical to those
estimated with the SES-rank relative scale. This coincidence
suggests that differential distributions of the population with very
high or very low SES have not skewed overall inferences from
the relative inequality measure used in our main analysis.
Known limitations of adult mortality data in developing countries
are age exaggeration of older individuals and underregistration of
deaths. The data used in this article for Costa Rica should be
virtually free of those limitations because (i) age was established
from the date of birth in the national registry and (ii) the follow-
up of deaths double checked survival with independent sources:
the voting lists in the NLMS and household visits in the
CRELES (40, 41). Two limitations in the databases used in this
article are (i) the exclusion of institutionalized individuals in the
US samples, which would slightly underestimate US mortality,
and (ii) the exclusion of foreigners (about 4% of the population)
in the Costa Rica follow-up, which might slightly overestimate
mortality if we believe that immigrants are a select group with
better than average health (42). The effect of these two limita-
tions would be, however, to understate the overperformance of
Costa Rican mortality.
Although this article compares individuals in the same age range
in the two countries, it is worth noting that they may have had
substantially different life course experiences, especially considering
that there was a huge gap in life expectancy and health between the
two countries until the 1970s. Survival selection of Costa Rican
adults is much higher than that of US adults. If this is a factor that
has given an advantage to elderly Costa Ricans, such advantage
would disappear in the future when cohorts with similar health
experiences in the two countries reach older ages.
Data and Methods
Data Used. Mortality estimates and its SES gradients in this article are based on
parallel NLMS conducted in the United States and Costa Rica by linking large
samples of individual-level census data (including SES variables) to the death
registries. For the United States, we use version 4 of the US-NLMS public use file
(43), which consists of a 6-y follow-up, starting in 1992, of a sample of non-
institutionalized individuals in the Current Population Survey (CPS). For Costa
Rica, we use a CR-NLMS that we created from a probabilistic sample of adults
in the 1984 census (40). We restrict Costa Rican observations to the 12-y follow-
up period starting in January 1990, so the observation period in both countries
is centered in 1996. We refer to the follow-up window as the 1990s period. To
minimize the possibility of death underregistration errors, the follow-up of
deaths in Costa Rica included survival checks against the voting lists for the
presidential elections conducted every 4 y starting in 1990. Only Costa Rican
nationals (96% at the study’s ages) were included in the Costa Rican data.
The NLMS analysis is restricted to ages 40–89 y. The lower age limit is
determined by the Costa Rican sample. The upper age limit is determined by
the lack of single year of age data in the public use US-NLMS files. Because
the US-NLMS sample does not include the institutionalized population, our
upper age limit also reduces the bias from this exclusion that mostly affects
very old individuals.
The analytical NLMS sample sizes differ substantially for the two countries:
288,000 in the United States and 17,500 in Costa Rica. The number of ob-
served deaths in the analysis period is 22,440 in the US sample and 2,415 in
Costa Rica.
We analyze all-cause mortality and mortality by nine large groups of
causes, namely (i) communicable diseases (which also includes HIV and acute
respiratory diseases), (ii) lung cancer, (iii) other cancer, (iv) heart diseases
(mostly myocardial infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease), (v) cere-
brovascular diseases (mostly stroke), (vi) chronic respiratory diseases (mostly
emphysema), (vii), diabetes mellitus, (viii) external injuries (accidents, ho-
micide, and suicide), and (ix) a residual group of other causes.
We complement the mortality analysis with a comparison of key health risk
factors with data from comparable nationally representative health surveys
publicly available: NHANES 2007–2010 in the United States (44) and CRELES
in Costa Rica (45). We used the information from individuals aged 65 or
more interviewed in the second CRELES wave of interviews conducted
mostly in 2007, as well as the data from the retirement cohort of individuals
(ages 55–64), interviewed mostly in 2011. The analytical sample sizes in these
two datasets were ∼4,000 in each country, ages 55 (the minimal age of in-
dividuals in CRELES) to 79 y (the highest age with detailed death information
in NHANES).
Definition of Variables. Based on previous literature, a range of health risk and
behavioral factors are compared using the NHANES and CRELES samples:
living arrangements as indicator of family support, whether uninsured,
smoking (never, former, current), body mass index (BMI) standard classification
(underweight, normal, overweight, and obese), abdominal girth (if waist cir-
cumference is more than 102 cm in males and 88 cm in females), sedentariness
(report of usually being seated more than 8 h/d), three categories (none, con-
trolled, and uncontrolled if biomarker level is fine but there is medical diagnosis
of the disease) of high blood pressure (cutoff: 140/90 mmHg systolic/diastolic),
dysglycemia (cutoff: 6.5% HbA1c) and dyslipidemia (cutoff: 240 mg/dL total
cholesterol), high CRP (cutoff at 1.0 mg/dL) levels as indicator of inflammation in
response to recent infection or heart diseases, and leukocyte telomere length
[cutoff at 0.8 relative telomere single copy gene (T/S) ratio] as potential marker
of stress and cellular aging.
Given the large differences in the absolute values of SES indicators in the
two countries such as education or income, we define a relative scale that
facilitates comparisons across countries: the SES rank of individuals in each
country as measured by their relative position in each sample after they are
sorted by years of attained education and, within each education category,
quintiles of income in the US or household wealth in Costa Rica. (An alter-
native approach would have been to compare mortality across the two
countries at any given SES level; e.g., comparing mortality across countries for
those with 9–11 y of education, then for 12 y, etc. A key drawback of such an
approach is that the selection into and meaning of a given education level
can also be very different in the two contexts, thus undermining the attempt
to standardize absolute SES level. For example, those with 9–11 y of edu-
cation in Costa Rica are among the relatively advantaged, whereas this
group in the United States is highly disadvantaged.)
The age of individuals in the Costa Rica data was determined using the
exact date of birth as recorded in the civil registration system (which was
linked to the surveys with the unique identification number of the Costa
Rican ID card). This procedure to determine age minimizes the possibility of
self-reported age errors that might distort mortality rates or other indicators
for elderly individuals. The US databases use self-reported ages.
Statistical Analysis. After splitting the NLMS databases by single-year age
segments during the survival follow-up periods, we compute death rates
using as the denominator the exact count of the number of person-years of
exposure in the surveys. We model age-adjusted death rates and death rate-
ratios using Poisson regression models, assuming that mortality grows ex-
ponentially with age—i.e., a Gompertz distribution—which is a reasonable
assumption for human populations in these ages (46).

 To compare the prevalence of health risk factors in the two countries,
we estimate age-adjusted proportions standardized using the US age
distribution.
The effect of the SES rank (on a 0–1 scale) on mortality rates or in the odds
of risk factors is an estimate of the so-called RII, or how many times higher
the mortality is at the lowest SES rank compared with the highest SES rank
(47). We estimate the RII using Poisson regression models for death rates and
logistic regression models for the probability of having each health risk
factor. All models control the effect of age as a continuous variable and its
square to allow nonlinear age effects.
