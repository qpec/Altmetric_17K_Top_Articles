 Abstract
Limited data exists on the interrelationships between physical activity (PA), sedentary
behaviors and sleep concerning cardiometabolic risk factors in aged adults at high cardio-
vascular disease risk. Our aim was to examine independent and joint associations between
time spent in leisure-time PA, sedentary behaviors and sleep on the prevalence of obesity,
type 2 diabetes (T2D) and components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Mediterranean
individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Cross-sectional analyses were performed on base-
line data from 5776 Spanish adults (aged 55-75y in men; 60-75y in women) with overweight/
obesity and MetS, from October 2013 to October 2016, in the PREDIMED-PLUS trial.
Employing multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with robust variance and constant time
(given the cross-sectional design), higher prevalence of obesity, T2D and abdominal obesity
as component of the MetS were associated with greater time in TV-viewing (Relative Risk,
RR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03; RR:1.04, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.06 and RR: 1.01 95%CI: 1.00, 1.02;
respectively, all P < .01). Conversely, greater time in moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) was
associated with lower prevalence of obesity, T2D, abdominal obesity and low HDL-choles-
terol (RR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.93, 0.97; RR: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.89, 0.99; RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.96,
0.98; and RR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.91, 0.99, respectively, all P < .05). For these outcomes, theo-
retically substituting 1-h/day of MVPA for 1-h/day TV-viewing was also significantly associ-
ated with lower prevalence (RR 0.91 to 0.97, all P < .05). Similar lower RR in these
outcomes was observed when substituting 1-h/day of MVPA for 1-h/day of sleeping. Longer
time watching TV and not meeting MVPA recommendations were jointly associated with
higher RR of the prevalence of obesity and T2D. We concluded that, in senior individuals at
high cardiovascular risk, greater time spent on MVPA and fewer on sedentary behaviors
was inversely associated with prevalence of obesity, T2D, and some of the components of
MetS.
Introduction
Physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviors and sleeping time are main components of the cir-
cadian cycle of which research has shown to strongly impact human health and to relate with
multiple cardiometabolic risk factors [1–3]. It is well established that increasing time spent in
MVPA is associated to a substantial risk reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mor-
tality [4–6]. Contrary, sedentary behaviors including sitting or reclining postures and activities
with �1.5 metabolic equivalent task (MET) of energy expenditure [7], such as watching TV,
have been repeatedly linked to increased CVD morbimortality [8–10], as well as the develop-
ment of T2D and MetS [11–13]. The fact these observations have been consistently reported
when controlling for physical activity suggests that sedentary behaviors may act as different
construct than physical inactivity [4,14] The relationships between sleep duration and cardio-
metabolic conditions are complex, yet sleep deprivation (i.e. sleeping �7 h, a common practice
among the general population) has been consistently related to higher average weight gain
[15], and to higher risk of obesity [16,17], T2D [18,19], hypertension and other hormonal and
metabolic disturbances [19].
Importantly, these cardiometabolic health-related effects attributed to PA, sedentary behav-
iors and altered sleep patterns have been extensively reported when assessed independently to

 each other [11,12,20,21]. However, time within the circadian cycle is finite, which challenges
the assumption that a sole activity acts independently from the others, and suggests that the
time spent in one activity is intrinsically co-dependent of the time spent on the rest of the
activities comprising total day time [22]. Isotemporal substitution modeling enables to better
discriminate the effects on health outcomes of simultaneously performing a single activity (e.g.
MVPA) and displacing another (e.g. watching TV), while controlling for other day activities
and capturing the effect of time [23,24]. These advantages may be especially important from a
public health perspective given that combined strategies, such as engaging in more MVPA and
less sedentary behaviors may be effective to prevent obesity, T2D and other relevant cardiome-
tabolic risk factors [4].
To date, some cross-sectional [22,25–27] and prospective studies [28–30] have addressed
the interrelationships between PA, sedentary behaviors and sleep in relation to cardiometa-
bolic risk factors in different populations including overweight/obese persons [22,28], T2D
patients [30] and healthy individuals [25,26]. Nevertheless, these associations have been barely
explored in a large population of elderly adults at high CVD risk—a typically overweight, sed-
entary and physically inactive group. Considering the high prevalence of cardiometabolic dis-
orders in this sector of the population and their consequent higher risks for several chronic
diseases, such studies are warranted in order to contribute to the development of preventive
strategies. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the independent and com-
bined associations between time spent in different activities, such as leisure-time PA, TV-view-
ing (as a proxy for sedentary behaviors) and sleep in relation to relevant cardiometabolic risk
factors including obesity, T2D and individual components of the MetS in senior adults at high
CV risk. By using isotemporal substitution modeling [31], the associations of theoretically
replacing one type of activity for another with the same amount of time on the prevalence of
the study outcomes were also evaluated.
Materials and methods
Study design and participants
The present investigation is a cross-sectional analysis on baseline data within the frame of the
PREDIMED-PLUS study, a 6-year multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, primary preven-
tion clinical trial conducted in Spain to assess the effect on CVD morbimortality of an inten-
sive weight loss intervention program based on an energy-restricted traditional Mediterranean
diet, PA promotion and behavioral support, in comparison with an usual care intervention
only with energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet (control group). A more detailed descrip-
tion of the PREDIMED-PLUS study is available at http://predimedplus.com/. This study was
registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial (ISRCT; http://www.
isrctn.com/ISRCTN89898870) with number 89898870. Registration date: 24 July 2014.
From October 2013 to October 2016, a total of 5776 participants were recruited and ran-
domized in 22 centres from different universities, hospitals and research institutes of Spain.
Each of these centres recruited participants from several Primary Care Health Facilities
belonging to the National Health System. The eligible participants were community-dwelling
adults (aged 55–75 in men; 60–75 in women) with overweight/obesity [body mass index
(BMI) �27 and <40 kg/m2], who met at least three components of the MetS according to the
updated harmonized criteria of the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart
Association and National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [32]. All participants included in
the current analysis presented data on PA, sedentary behaviors and sleeping time.
All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocol and procedures
were approved according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki by all the

Exposure variables
Sedentary behaviours were evaluated on weekdays and weekends with the validated Nurses’
Health Study questionnaire for sedentary behaviours [33], consisting of a set of open-ended
questions assessing the average daily time spent over the last year in watching TV, sitting while
using computer, sitting on journeys (for work purposes or leisure time, as driver or passenger
car, subway, bus, etc) and total sitting. Answers included 12 categories ranging from 0 to �9
h/day of sitting time for the corresponding activity. Because TV time is the most prevalent sed-
entary behavior, for which previous investigations among aged population have suggested to
fairly capture total sedentary time [34] and to consistently associate to higher risk of various
cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular mortality in a dose-response fashion [8], the
present study has evaluated TV time as a proxy for sedentary behaviors.
Leisure-time PA was assessed using the validated REGICOR questionnaire [35] (including
questions to collect information the type of activity, frequency (number of days) and duration
(min/day). The intensity was assigned based on the compendium of PA [36]. A trained inter-
viewer collected the required information about 6 types of activities performed during a con-
ventional month: brisk walking (5 MET), walking at a slow/normal pace (4 MET), walking in
the countryside (6 MET), climbing stairs (7 MET), working in the garden (5 MET), exercise or
play sports at home, outdoors or in a gym (11 MET). According to PA intensity, activities were
categorized into light PA <4.0 MET, moderate PA 4–5.5 MET and vigorous PA �6.0 MET.
Total leisure-time PA-related energy expenditure was estimated as the summed product of fre-
quency, duration and intensity of each activity divided by 30 days/month (MET�min/day). For
the present study, leisure-time PA was categorized in light PA (including leisurely stroll or
walk) and MVPA (including the sum for any activity of moderate or greater intensity). Finally,
PA time was computed as the sum of frequency�duration of each activity divided by 30 to
obtain the number of min/day.
Regarding sleep, participants reported their average daily sleeping time for both weekdays
and weekends, using the non-validated open question “How many hours do you sleep on aver-
age per day on weekdays and weekends?”
Outcomes ascertainment
Study outcomes were obesity, T2D and individual components of the MetS. Obesity was
defined as BMI �30 kg/m2. T2D was defined as previous clinical diagnosis of diabetes, or
HbA1c levels �6.5% or use of antidiabetic medication at baseline. Individual components of
the MetS were defined as follows: abdominal obesity (waist circumference �102 cm in men;
�88 cm in women), high blood pressure (systolic and/or diastolic �130/85 mmHg or using
antihypertensive drugs), hyperglycaemia (glucose �5.5 mmol/L or taking medication for ele-
vated glucose), hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides �1.7 mmol/L or taking triglyceride-

 lowering medication), low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c <1.03 mmol/L in men and <1.3 mmol/L
in women or taking HDL-c raising medication) [32].
Covariate assessment
The covariates were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires about socio-demographic
factors (sex, age, education, and marital and employment status), smoking habits, personal
and family history of illness, medical conditions, medication use and a 17-item screening ques-
tionnaire assessing adherence to an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet.
Anthropometric variables and blood pressure were determined by trained staff and in
accordance with the PREDIMED-PLUS operations protocol. Weight and height were mea-
sured with calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, respectively. BMI was calculated
as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared. Waist circumference was
measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, after normal exhalation, using an
anthropometric tape. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with the use of a validated
semiautomatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, Netherlands) while the participant was in a
seated position after 5 minutes of rest.
Blood samples were collected after 12 hours overnight fast and biochemical analyses were
performed on fasting plasma glucose, HDL-c and triglycerides concentrations in local labora-
tories using standard enzymatic methods.
Statistical analyses
In order to provide with more detailed information, baseline characteristics are presented
according to categories of total leisure-time PA in min/day (<15, from 15 to < 30, from 30
to < 60, from 60 to < 120 and �120) as means ± SD and number (%) by using one-way
ANOVA or chi-square tests as appropriate.
Given the cross-sectional design, Cox regression models with constant time of follow-up
for all individuals and robust variance estimates were fitted to estimate RR and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for each study outcome (obesity, T2D, and individual components of the MetS,
all as dichotomous variables) per 1-h/day increase in time spent in each activity separately
(TV-viewing, light PA and MVPA and sleeping, all as continuous variables). Correspondingly,
the time t was set to a constant (t = 1). According to methodologists, this model is better suited
than logistic regression for cross-sectional studies with frequent prevalent outcomes, such as
the present study, since it avoids the overestimation of the prevalence ratios derived from the
odds ratios when logistic regression is applied in analysis with frequent outcomes [37,38].
A crude model and three multivarible-adjusted Cox regression models were fitted as fol-
lows: a) model 1 [adjusted for age (continuous), sex, education level (illiterate/primary educa-
tion, secondary education and academic/graduate), smoking status (never smoker, past
smoker and current smoker), marital status (single/divorced, married and widower), family
history of coronary heart disease (yes or no) and energy-restricted Mediterranean diet adher-
ence (score 0 to 17 items, in categories of <8 or �9 items)], b) model 2 [model 1 plus the time
spent on the rest of the activities to precisely assess the independent effect of an activity]and c)
model 3 [model 2 plus each of the other components of the MetS, only for the associations
with each component of the MetS]. All models were stratified by recruiting center. In order to
correct for multiple testing, the Benjamini-Hochberg approach was applied to calculate false
discovery rate q values [39]. Effect modification by sex, age (�65, >65 years) and the exposure
variables (time spent in sleeping time, TV-viewing, light PA and MVPA) on each outcome was
evaluated by calculating te likelihood ratio test between the fully adjusted model and the same

 model adding the interaction product-term. All analysis testing for effect modifications by sex
and age showed no statistical significance (P >.40 for all interactions).
Taking advantage of the interpretation and the relevance to public health recommenda-
tions, we employed isotemporal substitution modeling to estimate the theoretical association
of replacing 1-h/day from one activity for 1-h/day of another activity on the prevalence of each
outcome, adjusting for potential confounders as detailed previously in models 2 and 3. For
these analyses, all activity variables (e.g., time spent in TV-viewing, light PA, and MVPA),
except the activity of interest which was dropped (e.g., sleeping time), were entered simulta-
neously into the models, along with a total discretionary time and covariates as follows:
h(t) = h0(t) exp [β1(TV-viewing) + β2(light PA) + β3(MVPA) + β4(total discretionary time) +
β5(covariates)], where t = 1. Total discretionary time was computed as a result of the sum of
hours spent in TV-viewing, light PA, MVPA and sleeping. Therefore, it is assumed that the
model was isotemporal when including the total discretionary time variable herein. Thus, the
Cox regression estimates for the included activities variables reflects the RR for each outcome
observed when the time spent in these activities increases 1-h/day because the time spent in
the omitted activity (e.g., sleeping) decreases 1-h/day.
Finally, because PA and TV-viewing are two closely-related lifestyle behaviours concerning
to cadiometabolic outcomes such as obesity and T2D [40] we explored the joint associations of
combining MVPA and time spent watching TV on obesity and T2D. For this purpose, MVPA
was first dichotomized into meeting or not meeting current WHO recommendations [41] for
MVPA set in �2.5 h/week (yes/no). Time spent in watching TV (in hours) was categorized in
three approximately equally distributed groups: low TV (�2h/day), medium TV (>2 to
�4h/day) and high TV (>4h/day). Therefore, each participant was cross-allocated to one of
the six joint categories and meeting MVPA recommendations and low TV group was consid-
ered as the reference category. The interaction between meeting or not meeting the recom-
mendations for MVPA and time spent watching TV in their associations with each outcome
was examined by calculating the likelihood ratio test between the fully adjusted model and the
same model including the interaction product-term (P>.30 for all the interactions).
Significance for all statistical tests was P < .05 for bilateral contrast. All analyses were cross-
sectional, and performed using Stata (14.0, StataCorp LP, Tx. USA).
Results
Individuals undergoing screening and meeting inclusion criteria, but eventually not being ran-
domized (n = 2239); and the trial participants randomized (n = 5776) showed no statistically
significant differences in terms of sex, age and BMI. Trial participants mean age was 65±4.9y
and 51.9% were men. More than 60% of the participants reported sleeping between 7 to <9 h/
day. On average, individuals spent 4.9 ± 2.3 h/day sitting and their average time watching TV
was 3.3±1.7 h/day, suggesting that they dedicate most of their sitting time watching TV (67%).
The total mean time spent in leisure time PA was 66.8 min/day and 45% of the population
reported spending �60 min/day on PA. MVPA was the most frequent PA intensity in this
population, contributing to 60% of the total min/ day. Table 1 presents participant characteris-
tics according to categories of total daily leisure-time PA. Compared to less active individuals,
physically active participants were more likely to be men, had lower BMI, lower body weight
and waist circumference, and spent less daily time in sedentary behaviors and watching TV.
They also had greater daily energy expenditure from PA and were more likely to adhere to the
energy-restricted Mediterranean diet.
Table 2 shows that 1-h/day increase in TV-viewing was significantly associated with higher
prevalence of obesity (RR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03) and T2D (RR: 1.04, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.06) after

 adjustment for the potential confounders and independently of time spent in other activities.
Conversely, 1-h/day increase in MVPA was significantly associated with 5 and 6% lower preva-
lence of obesity and T2D. Even after adjustment for T2D in the model with obesity as the expo-
sure, and vice versa, results remained unchanged.
Regarding the components of the MetS (Table 2), 1-h/day increase in TV-viewing was posi-
tively and independently associated with the prevalence of abdominal obesity (RR: 1.01, 95%

 CI: 1.00, 1.02) after adjustment for time spent in other activities and relevant covariates
(model 2). Conversely, 1-h/day increase in MVPA was associated with an independent and sig-
nificantly lower RR for abdominal obesity (RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.96, 0.98) and low-HDL-c (RR:
0.94, 95%CI: 0.90, 0.98). Further adjustment for each of the other four MetS components
(model 3) had little impact on the risk estimates. No association between TV-viewing and
MVPA, and the high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia components of
the MetS were found in fully adjusted models. No association with the study outcomes was
observed with sleeping and light intensity PA.
Isotemporal substitution models are highlighted in Figs 1 and 2, and fully displayed in S1
Table. Theoretically substituting 1-h/day of MVPA for 1-h/day of sleeping, TV-viewing and
light PA was associated with significantly lower prevalence of obesity (RR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.93,
0.97; RR: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.90, 0.94 and RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.93, 0.99; respectively). Likewise,

 replacing 1-h/day of TV-viewing with 1-h/day of either light PA (RR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.92, 0.98)
or sleeping (RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.96, 0.98) was also inversely associated with obesity (Fig 1A).
Similarly, substituting 1-h/day of MVPA for 1-h/day TV-viewing and light PA was associated
with low prevalence of T2D (RR: 0.91, 95%CI: 0.86, 0.96; and RR: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.85, 0.99,
respectively), as well as when substituting sleeping for TV-viewing (RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.93,
0.99) (Fig 1B).
Regarding components of the MetS, except for high blood pressure and hyperglycemia, the
substitution of 1-h/day of MVPA for sleeping and TV-viewing was significantly associated
with lower prevalence of abdominal obesity (RR:0.97; 95%CI:0.96, 0.98), hypertriglyceridemia
(RR:0.94; 95%CI: 0.90, 0.98) and low HDL-c (RR 0.94; 95%CI: 0.90, 0.98). Only for abdominal
obesity, hyperglycemia and low-HDL-c, substituting equal time of MVPA for light PA was
associated to a lower risk (RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95, 0.99; RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.93, 0.99; and RR:
0.92, 95%CI: 0.86, 0.98 respectively) (Fig 2). The opposite was also observed when MVPA was
dropped out of the isotemporal substitution models (S1 Table). Replacing 1-h/day of other
activities did not seem to be uniformly associated with the study outcomes, regardless of the
activity type displaced (S1 Table).
Fig 3 shows joint associations by combining time spent in MVPA and TV-viewing on obe-
sity and T2D prevalence. Fifty two percent of the participants met MVPA recommendations
of �2.5 h/wk of which 20% belonged to high TV group, whereas this was true for 31.5% of the
participants who did not meet MVPA recommendations. Compared to the reference group,
those participants who did not meet the MVPA recommendations showed progressively
higher RR for the prevalence of obesity parallel to time spent watching TV (RR 1.14 to 1.23, all
P < .05). However, participants at the high TV group and not meeting MVPA recommenda-
tions had highest risks of being obese (RR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.16, 1.30) (Fig 3A). Similar progres-
sive pattern was observed concerning T2D risk. Those participants at the high TV group
showed highest risks, regardless meeting (RR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.41) or not meeting (RR:
1.36, 95%CI: 1.18, 1.55) MVPA recommendations (Fig 3B), being the highest risk among the
group of not meeting MVPA recommendation and high TV.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has examined the complex interrela-
tionships between time spent in leisure-time PA, watching TV and sleep concerning to the
prevalence of relevant cardiometabolic risk factors in senior adults with overweight or obesity
and MetS at high CVD risk. The main findings in this report are that 1-h/day increase in
MVPA was independently and significantly associated with lower prevalence of obesity, T2D
and abdominal obesity and low HDL-c as independent components of the MetS. Contrary,
detrimental associations were observed when increasing 1-h/day in TV-viewing for the same
cardiometabolic risk factors, except for low HDL-c. Furthermore, when we theoretically
replaced 1-h/day TV-viewing and sleeping by equal amounts of MVPA, beneficial effects were
observed for these study outcomes, plus hypertriglyceridemia.
Our results on the independent associations between time spent in MVPA, TV-viewing
and different cardiometabolic risk factors are in line with most of previous cross-sectional
[13,20,21,27,42] and prospective studies [11,12,43,44] in different populations. For instance, a
cross-sectional study from the large EPIC-Norfolk cohort of 14,189 adults aged �45 years
showed that larger self-reported time spent in watching TV and in vigorous PA was positively
and negatively associated, respectively, with CVD risk profile including markers of obesity,
lipid profile and blood pressure [20]. Similar findings have been reported in other large
cohorts regarding these outcomes [13,42] based on self-reported behaviors, and also using

 accelerometer-derived objective measurements for physical activity [25,27,45]. These previous
results have been supported by various prospective studies, such as those from two large US
cohorts in healthy middle-aged men [12] and women [11] showing positive associations
between prolonged self-reported TV time and incidence of obesity and T2D. In contrast,
increasing physical activity per se or moderate activities such as brisk walking were related to
lower risk. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence from systematic reviews and meta-
analyses of prospective and randomized controlled trials suggesting unfavorable links regard-
ing TV-viewing or sedentary time, but favorable links with PA, in relation to obesity, T2D and
cardiometabolic risk factors, such as lipids levels [2,3,8,46,47], as well as all-cause mortality [6],
thereby supporting our study observations.
Although recently light PA has been suggested to play a positive role in preventing obesity,
T2D and cardiometabolic risk factors, no strong associations have been found in our study.
While there is some evidence for beneficial effects of light PA on health outcomes, such as
blood pressure among physically inactive individuals with hypertension [48], it is not entirely
unequivocal, particularly in regard to other cardiometabolic outcomes including body weight,
body fat or lipid profile [48,49]. Therefore, it is plausible that the lack of associations observed
in the literature and in our study might partly arise as a result of disparities in the design and
selected populations, as well as the levels of light PA used to assess the effects on cardiometa-
bolic health as they may be modest in comparison to those typically performed by adults [48].
Similarly, when looking at specific risk factors, we did not find any association between time
spent in leisure-time PA or TV-viewing, and the prevalence of hyperglycemia or high blood
pressure, which is in line with results from other authors [47,50], but not from all [13,45]. The
lack of associations observed in our study concerning these outcomes may be due to the popu-
lation studied, consisting of senior Mediterranean individuals at high CVD risk and using
multiple medication. Taken together, further longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify
these conflicting results in different populations.
It is recognized that sleeping >7–9 h/d is basic to promote optimal health [15,26], whereas
outside this range sleep has been generally unfavorable linked with obesity [16,17], T2D and
glucose metabolism disturbances [15,18], as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors [15].
Our study participants engaged an average of 7 sleeping hours per night on a regular basis and
a large proportion (60%) of them reported sleeping between 7 to <9 h/day, hence potentially
explaining the null association observed in our investigation.
Current public health strategies include separate messages advocating for increasing time
in active behaviors [41] and reducing sedentary time [51]; our study found support for each
of these. However, by employing theoretically isotemporal substitution modeling, a rela-
tively less studied analytical approach, we further demonstrated that reallocating time from
TV-viewing to additional MVPA was associated with a more favorable cardiometabolic pro-
file. Based in our findings on obesity, T2D and some components of the MetS, it seems to
exist different effect size in the associations between most activities and the study outcomes
when assessing them independently than when applying isotemporal substitution modeling,
even after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. For instance, we observed that 1-h/
d of MVPA was independently associated to 6% protection against T2D, whereas when this
activity replaced equal amounts of TV-viewing the protection increased up to 9% in our
population of senior adults at higher risk; i.e. with overweight/obesity and MetS. In accor-
dance to our results, recent reports applying same methodological approach and mostly
using accelerometry have generally shown similar findings in middle-aged healthy persons
[24–26] and adults with T2D [52]. Such studies have consistently evidenced that reallocating
time from sedentary behaviors to equal amounts of either moderate PA, vigorous PA or
MVPA was favorably associated to lower risk of obesity markers [25,26,52] as well as other

 CVD risk factors related to lipid profile and glucose metabolism [24–26], and even
decreased risk of all cause-death [5]. Together with previous evidence, our findings support
the notion that PA and sedentary behaviors have an individual impact on health outcomes,
yet these effects may be underestimated if substitution effects among these activities are not
considered. Given that PA and sedentary behaviors seem to strongly co-depend, it seems
necessary to consider the isotemporal substitution methodology, as it provides with richer
insights with relevant public health implications. Importantly, our investigation further
addressed the combined associations of meeting/not-meeting MVPA recommendations
and time spent watching TV in relation to obesity and T2D, indicating that the combination
of not meeting MVPA recommendations and spending great time watching TV may be a
strong risk factor for obesity. This message is of great importance given that evidence under-
pinning current international PA guidelines recommending �2.5 h/week of MVPA to
reduce risk for obesity and T2D is limited to independent associations between PA and
health outcomes [41]. In this context, our findings are in agreement with previous cross-sec-
tional studies in healthy overweight adults showing highest obesity risks when low MVPA
or insufficient PA levels were assessed in combination to greater TV time or sedentary
behavior [27,53]. Furthermore, a recent 5-years prospective analysis on healthy overweight/
obese adults revealed that larger MVPA time spent combined with lesser leisure time sitting
was associated with lower risk of obesity [43].
Potential mechanisms may be driving the findings of our study. One such mechanism
points out to the opposite contributions of PA and sedentary behaviors to energy balance by
either promoting or hampering energy expenditure, respectively, while preserving the energy
intake [54]. Additionally, it is plausible that time spent in watching TV results in increase total
energy intake given that individuals tend to eat while watching TV—particularly high calorie,
unhealthy foods [55]—which have been related to risk of obesity and diabetes [56]. Lastly, ben-
eficial associations from PA are partly attributed to its ability to ameliorate body composition
[57], improve glucose metabolism or enhance insulin sensitivity [3].
Study limitations and strengths
Some methodological limitations should be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional nature
does not allow us to address causality and we admit the possibility of reverse causality bias
as an alternative, non-causal, explanation of our results. Second, the present findings cannot
be extrapolated to other population groups given that our study participants are senior
adults with overweight/obesity and MetS. Additionally, although our study used self-
reported PA and sedentary time which may be subject to potential biases, we used specifi-
cally validated questionnaires [33] and our results are according to those studies using accel-
erometry methods [24–27,45]. Furthermore, despite TV time has been suggested as a proxy
for sedentary behaviors, the present study did not directly evaluate total sedentary time.
Similarly, sleeping was limited to sleep duration in the present study, which does not
account for the contribution of sleeping quality on cardiovascular health [58]. Finally, we
acknowledge that the clinical significance provided by some relatively small increases in the
risk prevalence of the study outcomes, remains unknown and deserves further exploration.
Our study also has various strengths, including the large study sample of men and women,
and the fully-adjusted analyses for potential confounding factors. Moreover, our study
extensively addressed the complex interrelationships between different behaviors in relation
to cardiometabolic risk factors by evaluating independent and combined associations, as
well as by employing theoretically isotemporal substitution modeling.

 Conclusions
The results in our study with senior adults at high CVD risk, suggest that greater time spent on
MVPA and fewer on sedentary behaviors is inversely associated with obesity, T2D and some
of the components of the MetS. Public health strategies focusing on avoiding sedentary behav-
iors and substituting equivalent times for MVPA may represent a more appropriate approach
in clinical practice for preventing cardiometabolic disorders, among aged populations at
higher CVD risk. Further investigations should prospectively confirm our findings and eluci-
date potential mechanisms involved.
