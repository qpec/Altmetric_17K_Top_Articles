Alcohol is a traditional social-bonding reinforcer; however, the neural mechanism underlying
ethanol-driven social behaviors remains elusive. Here, we report that ethanol facilitates
observational fear response. Observer mice exhibited stronger defensive immobility while
observing cagemates that received repetitive foot shocks if the observer mice had experi-
enced a brief priming foot shock. This enhancement was associated with an observation-
induced recruitment of subsets of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons in the observer
mouse that were responsive to its own pain. The vicariously activated ACC neurons projected
their axons preferentially to the basolateral amygdala. Ethanol shifted the ACC neuronal
balance toward inhibition, facilitated the preferential ACC neuronal recruitment during
observation, and enhanced observational fear response, independent of an oxytocin signaling
pathway. Furthermore, ethanol enhanced socially evoked fear response in autism model mice.

 A
lcohol has been enjoyed throughout the history of
humankind, as it promotes sociality1. Acute alcohol
consumption reduces social stress2, increases generosity3,
and improves recognition of facial expressions4. Recent studies
have demonstrated that it enhances social bonding5 and pro-
motes smile contagion6, suggesting that alcohol enhances affec-
tive empathy (or emotional contagion), which underlies altruistic
motivation
and
prosocial
behaviors.
However,
the
neural
mechanism of alcohol-driven sociality remains to be identified.
Sociality is enhanced by prior similar experiences. For example,
prior similar experiences of the events in stories increase empathy
for the persons in the stories7. Preis et al.8 reported that prior
pain exposures facilitate subsequent state empathy for pain.
Human brain imaging studies suggest that vicarious experience of
others’ pain involves shared representation of experienced and
observed pain9,10. This notion raises a possibility that this over-
lapping neural representation may underlie the experience-
dependent facilitation of empathy. However, voxel-level ana-
lyses using functional magnetic resonance imaging do not
necessarily support the shared representation hypothesis at the
single-neuron level11.
Empathy is a high-level affective process that is often expressed
by humans, but rodents also manifest some aspects of empathy-
like behaviors12–14. Affective empathy is modeled using the fear
observational system, in which an animal (observer) exhibits
behavioral defensive immobility when it observes the distress of a
conspecific (demonstrator) receiving electrical shocks15,16. In this
fear transmission system, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a
pain-relevant brain region, is critical for experiencing vicarious
pain15, consistent with human imaging studies9,10. However,
fundamental questions remain unsolved, including (i) whether
firsthand and vicarious pain activate the same ACC neurons at
the single-cell level and (ii) if so, whether ethanol modulates the
overlapping ACC neuronal representation and observational fear.
Like ethanol, the neuropeptide oxytocin is also involved in
social functioning, including consolation behavior14, maternal
care17, sociosexual behavior18, and social recognition19. Fur-
thermore, intranasal oxytocin improves behavioral and neural
deficits in autism20. Regarding empathy, intranasal oxytocin
enhances affective empathy in response to both positive- and
negative-valence stimuli21, and facilitates the perceptions of harm
for victims22. However, the social effect of oxytocin depends on
context. For example, oxytocin does not modulate empathic
responses to painful pictures but facilitates them when partici-
pants are asked to take the perspective of others23. Moreover, the
social effect of oxytocin differs between in-group and out-group
members24,25. In this work, we also examined the involvement of
endogenous oxytocin signaling in observational fear transmission
and compared it to the effect of exogenous ethanol. As a result,
we found that mice treated with ethanol-increased defensive
immobility while observing the distress of demonstrators. The
effect of ethanol emerged independently of the oxytocin signaling.
Results
Ethanol enhances socially evoked fear memory recall. We first
examined the effect of a prior shock experience on subsequent
fear observation in mice. A total of 80 pairs of cagemates
cohoused for 1–2 weeks were randomly divided into four groups,
no priming shock/fear observation (no-PS/FO), FO-only, PS-
only, and PS + FO (Fig. 1a), and each pair consisted of a ran-
domly chosen observer and demonstrator. In the PS + FO group,
the observers were briefly placed in a shock chamber and given a
single priming foot shock. Two hours later, the observers were
placed in a fear observational chamber in which demonstrators in
the neighboring compartment received repetitive foot shocks
(every 12 s for 4 min). In the FO-only group, observers were
placed in the same shock chamber but did not receive a priming
shock and were then tested for fear observation. In the PS-only
group, observers underwent a priming shock, but the demon-
strators did not receive repetitive shocks. During the fear obser-
vation period, the defensive immobility of the observers in the PS
+ FO group was significantly higher than that in the three other
groups (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the prior shock experience
facilitated observational fear response. When the observers in the
PS + FO group were re-exposed to the same context 24 h after the
observation, they exhibited defensive immobility (Supplementary
Fig. 1), indicating that they learned fear-associated contexts by
observing their cagemates’ behavior. The observers in the PS-only
group showed no apparent defensive immobility, and thus, the
priming shock alone was insufficient to induce fear response
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). The facilitatory effect of the
priming shock lasted for at least 4 w (Supplementary Fig. 2) and
was abolished by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/kg MK801,
an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibitor, 30 min
before the priming shock (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), but not 30
min before fear observation (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The priming
shock could not be replaced with other aversive experiences, such
as tail pinches or forced swimming (Supplementary Fig. 4),
suggesting that observational fear response is facilitated by
common
experiences
shared
between
demonstrators
and
observers16.
A recent study has reported that acute intranasal treatment
with oxytocin enhances observational fear in mice26. Therefore,
we examined the involvement of endogenous oxytocin in
observational fear by preventing the oxytocin signaling in the
FO-only group. Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg L-368,899,
an oxytocin receptor antagonist, 30 min before the fear observa-
tion reduced the duration of defensive immobility (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5). A similar effect of L-368,899 was produced when
observer mice had experienced a priming shock (Fig. 1c).
We investigated the effect of ethanol on observational fear
response. We adopted a dose of 1.5 g/kg, based on the blood
ethanol concentration observed with daily alcohol consumption
in humans27,28. Observers that had received intraperitoneal
injection of ethanol 30 min before the fear observation (i.e., 90
min after the priming shock) exhibited more defensive immobi-
lity than saline-treated controls (Fig. 1c), an effect that was not
reduced by L-368,899 (Fig. 1c). Thus, ethanol enhances observa-
tional fear response in an oxytocin-independent manner. The
facilitatory effect of ethanol on observational fear cannot be
explained by modulations of locomotor, anxiety, or pain-related
behavior because, consistent with previous reports29,30, this dose
of ethanol facilitated locomotor activity (Supplementary Fig. 6a,
b) and tended to decrease anxiety-like behaviors (Supplementary
Fig. 6c–f), but did not alter pain sensitivity (Supplementary
Fig. 6g, h). Moreover, the effect of ethanol was not likely due to
enhanced
consolidation
or
retrieval
of
a
simple
context-
dependent priming shock memory, given that ethanol prevented
contextual fear memory recall (Supplementary Fig. 7), and also
because observational fear response was enhanced 24 h after the
priming shock when ethanol was administered 30 min before the
fear observation but not when ethanol was administered 90 min
after the priming shock (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Importantly,
ethanol failed to enhance fear transmission in the FO-only group
(Supplementary Fig. 8c). Thus, we conclude that ethanol
facilitates socially evoked recall of observer’s own fear memory.
Firsthand and vicarious pain share neuronal representations.

fear at a cellular resolution, we conducted cellular compartment

 analyses of temporal activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization
(catFISH)31, which can discriminate neurons that are activated
during two time windows, the firsthand pain (primary shock) and
the vicarious pain (fear observation), by taking advantage of the
intracellular localization of the immediate early gene Arc; in
response to neuronal activity, Arc mRNA appears in the nucleus
within 5 min and moves to the cytoplasm 20–45 min later.
Therefore, in the experimental schedule depicted in Fig. 2a,
nuclear and cytoplasmic Arc-positive (Nuc+ and Cyto+, respec-
tively) cells are expected to represent neurons that were activated
by the fear observation and the priming shock, respectively. We
first analyzed the Arc expression in ACC neurons (Fig. 2b). The
percentages of Nuc+ cells were consistent with those reported in a
previous study32, and did not differ between the PS + FO and
FO-only groups (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the facilitatory effect of
the priming shock was not mediated simply by an increase in
ACC neuronal activity. We then computed the overlap score for
nuclear/cytoplasmic double-positive (Double+) cells (Fig. 2d),
which represents the extent to which neurons were commonly
activated by both the priming shock and the fear observation. The
PS + FO group had a significantly higher overlap score than the
FO-only control group (PS + FO: 57.9 ± 3.5, FO-only: 16.0 ± 1.4,
t10 = 11.2, P = 5.70 × 10−2, n = 6 mice per group). Consistent
with the behavioral data, the scores of the PS + FO group were
decreased and increased by intraperitoneal L-368,899 and etha-
nol, respectively (Fig. 2e), and L-368,899 did not affect ethanol-
induced increases in scores (Fig. 2e).
We also analyzed Arc mRNA in the anterior insular cortex, the
basal/lateral amygdala (BLA), and the dorsal hippocampal CA1
region (Supplementary Fig. 9), but unlike in the ACC, we failed to
find significant overlap scores (Fig. 2f), though these brain regions
exhibited significant percentages of Double+ cells; note that the
overlap score was defined such that it excluded the possible effects
of population sizes33. Consistent with that result, local injections
of 4.1 µg/side L-368,899 and 7.0 µg/side ethanol into the ACC
were sufficient to reduce and enhance observational fear response,
respectively (Fig. 3a). Moreover, individual-animal analyses
demonstrated that the duration of defensive immobility during
observation was positively correlated with the overlap scores of
ACC neurons, but not with the percentages of Cyto+ or Nuc+
cells (Fig. 3b–d).
Although the overlap scores in the BLA did not differ between
the PS-only and PS + FO groups (Fig. 2f), the BLA receives
anatomically direct afferents from the ACC, and this neural
pathway is a part of the neuronal substrate for observational fear
learning15,34. Thus, the overlapping ACC activity may be
transmitted to the BLA. We retrogradely labeled the neurons
projecting to the BLA by injecting Alexa 594-conjugated cholera
toxin subunit B (CTB, 0.5 µg/side) into the BLA and conducted
Arc catFISH for ACC neurons (Fig. 4a–d). CTB-positive cells
were more frequently observed in Cyto+ cells than in nucleic-
only Arc-positive cells or double-negative cells (Fig. 4e, n = 4
mice). Thus, ACC neurons that projected to the BLA were
preferentially recruited by a priming shock, potentially indicating

 that the increased overlap of ACC neuron ensembles reflects
increased functional connectivity between the ACC and BLA.
Ethanol shifts the E/I-balance in ACC neurons. To examine
how ethanol modulates ACC neuronal activity, we recorded
miniature
excitatory
and
inhibitory
postsynaptic
currents
(mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) from layer II/III ACC pyr-
amidal neurons in acute brain slices and bath-applied 50 mM
ethanol (Fig. 5a), which corresponds to the normal intrabrain
concentrations after systemic injection of ethanol35. Ethanol
decreased the amplitudes and frequencies of mEPSCs and
increased the frequencies of mIPSCs, whereas it did not alter the
amplitudes of mIPSCs (Supplementary Fig. 10). Overall, ethanol
decreased the mEPSC conductances (Fig. 5b, left) and increased
the mIPSC conductances (Fig. 5b, middle), thereby reducing the
net excitatory to inhibitory (E/I) ratio and tipping the balance
toward inhibition (Fig. 5b, right). To examine how the E/I-bal-
ance shift affects socially evoked fear memory recall, we injected
79 ng/side clonazepam, a traditional benzodiazepine, or 0.3 µg/
side picrotoxin, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A-receptor inhi-
bitor, into the ACC. Note that clonazepam is reported to reduce
the synaptic E/I ratios and thereby ameliorate social behavioral
deficits36. As we expected, clonazepam increased observational
fear response in control mice, whereas picrotoxin reduced it
(Fig. 5c). Picrotoxin also abolished ethanol-enhanced observa-
tional fear response (Fig. 5c).
Ethanol rescues social impairment of poly(I:C) mice. Finally,
we examined observational fear in a mouse model of maternal
immune activation37. In humans, maternal immune activation is
a known risk factor for autism spectrum disorder. We treated
pregnant mice with poly-inosine:cytosine (poly(I:C)), a synthetic
analogue of double-stranded RNA that mimics a molecular pat-
tern of viral infection, and tested the offspring in the fear
observation test. The priming shock failed to enhance observa-
tional fear response in these poly(I:C) mice (Fig. 6a). However,
intraperitoneal ethanol administration in poly(I:C) mice restored
observational fear response to levels comparable to those in
control mice (Fig. 6b). Poly(I:C) mice exhibited normal defensive
immobility during their own contextual fear conditioning and
higher defensive immobility during subsequent memory tests
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, neither fear expression nor fear
learning ability was impaired in poly(I:C) mice. Arc catFISH
revealed that poly(I:C) mice exhibited a lower ACC overlap score
than control mice (Fig. 6c), whereas there were no effects on the
percentages of either Cyto+ or Nuc+ cells per se (Supplementary
Fig. 12). The overlap score of poly(I:C) mice was increased by
intraperitoneal ethanol (Fig. 6d).

 Discussion
In the present study, we discovered that neuronal representations
of experienced and observed pain overlapped at the single-cell
level and were bidirectionally manipulable by administration of
ethanol or an oxytocin receptor antagonist, which induced a
corresponding change in defensive immobility during fear
observation.
Recent
studies
have
demonstrated
overlapping
neuronal
ensembles across associative memories in various learning para-
digms38,39, and the overlapping representations are indispensable
for a temporal link between discrete memories39. Our study
extends this notion to an inter-individual link of experiences. We
observed that the degrees of defensive immobility during obser-
vation were positively correlated with the overlap scores of ACC
neurons but not with the absolute numbers of activated neurons,
consistent with a report showing that the strength of fear memory
is not coded by the overall size of memory trace in the lateral
amygdala40. Thus, overlapping populations of ACC neurons may
integrate firsthand and vicarious pain information and facilitate
socially evoked fear memory recall.
Our findings suggest that overlapping neuronal representations
are shaped by neuronal E/I balance, consistent with other studies
about learning and memory. The E/I balance in individual neu-
rons is a fundamental determinant of memory allocation41,42.
The E/I balance regulates the neuronal overlap and thereby
determines whether two memories are integrated or segregated43.
A computational study has also shown that balanced E/I ratios
are required for noise-robust neuronal selection44. Moreover,
imbalanced E/I ratios are one of the major biological character-
istics of human autism spectrum disorders, in which the number
of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and the GABA con-
centration in the cerebral cortex are reduced45,46. GABAergic
signaling is also disrupted in mouse models of autism47,48. In
normal mice, an artificial elevation of the E/I balance leads to
social deficits36,49,50. However, the mechanisms linking the E/I
imbalance and social impairments remain unclear. Based on our
results, we suggest that ethanol reduced the E/I ratio, increased
the shared neuronal representations for experienced and observed
pain, and enhanced observational fear in both normal and autism
model mice, thus possibly providing a cell-level framework for
both sociality and social impairments in developmental disorders.
However, our data must be interpreted with caution. We per-
formed only pharmacological manipulations on the excitability of
neuronal circuits of the ACC and did not provided a direct link
between the E/I balance and social behavior. Moreover, we found
that injection of picrotoxin alone abolished the observational fear
response. Therefore, it is possible that picrotoxin caused dys-
function of the ACC neuronal circuits, rather than a modulation
of the E/I balance, and impaired social behavior.
We rule out the possibility that the facilitatory effect of ethanol
on defensive immobility during fear observation resulted merely
from ethanol-induced sedation because ethanol-increased loco-
motor activity and had no effect on immobility time in the open
field test at the dose (1.5 g/kg) used in our study. Consistent with
our observations, ethanol is known to increase locomotor fre-
quency but does not alter immobility in the open field test at
similar doses30. Another concern of using ethanol was the acute
effect on memory. In humans, ethanol administered after training
is reported to facilitate the ability to learn various tasks51–53; the
results from animal studies are contradictory. Posttraining etha-
nol can promote learning54,55 or impair learning56. Thus, in our
study, it is possible that ethanol-enhanced consolidation of the
priming shock memory facilitated observational fear. However,
we demonstrated that injection of ethanol prior to the fear
observation, but not after the priming shock, promoted obser-
vational fear, suggesting that the enhanced memory consolidation
cannot account for the facilitatory effect of ethanol. The defensive
immobility in the PS + FO group contains an aspect of memory
recall. Therefore, ethanol may increase defensive immobility by
enhancing the recall of observer’s own fear memory. We con-
firmed that ethanol did not promote fear memory recall in a
classical fear-conditioning paradigm. Previous reports have also
demonstrated that ethanol impairs, rather than facilitates, mem-
ory retrieval in the Morris water maze task57 and the passive
avoidance task58. Therefore, we believe that ethanol-increased
defensive immobility was unlikely to have been produced simply
by ethanol-enhanced associative memory recall. Moreover, we
confirmed that a priming shock per se did not enhance the fear
response and did not induce contextual associative fear memory.
These results suggest that the immobility behavior in the PS + FO
group is essentially different from fear memory recall in a classical

 fear conditioning. It is intriguing to find that ethanol did not
increase the defensive immobility in the FO-only group. Thus,
ethanol is unlikely to enhance empathetic fear responses. A
plausible interpretation is that ethanol selectively enhances a
socially evoked component of the fear memory recall.
Interestingly, alcohol-dependent patients are known to exhibit
a lower level of empathy59. This fact is apparently contradictory
to our findings, but chronic ethanol treatment induces neuro-
chemical changes in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
transmissions in the cerebral cortex, and those changes are dif-
ferent from the acute effect of ethanol. Chronic ethanol increases
the mRNA level of NMDA receptors60 and decreases the mRNA
level of GABAA receptors61, potentially shifting the E/I balance
toward excitation. In fact, cortical inhibition is reduced in alco-
holic patients62. By contrast, we found that the acute application
of ethanol shifted the E/I balance toward inhibition. Therefore,
ethanol seems to exert opposite effects in acute or chronic
treatment.
There are also conflicting reports regarding the effects of
ethanol on the perception of one’s own pain. Several studies have
demonstrated that systemic injection of ethanol induces analgesia
that is evaluated by tail-deflection or tail-flick assays63,64, whereas
other reports have shown that similar doses of ethanol have no
effect on motor responses to various intensities of electrical
shocks29 and even that ethanol induces hyperalgesia65. This dis-
crepancy may be due to differences in the types or intensities of
noxious stimuli delivered to animals64. In our study, intraper-
itoneal injection of 1.5 g/kg ethanol did not alter the minimal
electrical shock intensity needed to induce pain-related responses
or the frequency of acetic acid-induced writhing responses, sug-
gesting that ethanol did not apparently affect pain sensitivity.
Under our experimental conditions, therefore, ethanol-enhanced
observational fear is unlikely attributable to a sensitized pain
system.
In contrast to our findings, some studies have demonstrated
that ethanol enhances aggression in mice66,67. These studies
assessed aggressive behaviors using resident–intruder tests, in
which a resident mouse attacks an unfamiliar mouse that intrudes
the territory68. This paradigm differs from the situation in our
fear observation test in which an observer and a demonstrator are
cagemates and do not exhibit offensive behaviors against one
another. In general, familiarity between two animals is crucial for
establishing empathy-related behaviors, such as fear transmis-
sion15, prosocial behavior69, and social modulation of pain12. In
humans, oxytocin augments not only in-group favoritism but also
out-group derogation25. Ethanol may work in a similar way and
facilitate socially evoked fear memory recall only to in-group
members.
Also in contrast to our study showing that oxytocin increases
observational fear expression, several reports have demonstrated
that oxytocin attenuates fear per se through modulating the
activity of the central amygdala70,71. These studies showed that
artificial augmentation of oxytocin signaling, such as micro-
injection of oxytocin receptor agonist and optogenetically evoked
axonal oxytocin release, in the central amygdala causes fear
reduction, but they did not mention whether naturally released
endogenous oxytocin affects defensive immobility. Indeed, sys-
temic administration of L-368,899 (5 or 10 mg/kg) did not alter
defensive immobility in Pavlovian conditioning26. A meta-
analysis of human studies also found that intranasal oxytocin
did not significantly influence the expression of negative emo-
tions, including fear72. Therefore, it is unclear whether naturally
released oxytocin in the amygdala is truly involved in fear, even
though artificially elevated oxytocin signaling can attenuate fear.
On the other hand, we showed that intra-ACC injection of L-
368,899 is sufficient to reduce observational fear response, sug-
gesting that oxytocin differently affects Pavlovian-conditioned
fear and socially evoked fear. This difference may simply reflect

 the difference between the brain regions, and it is also possible
that oxytocin-reduced fear is surpassed by oxytocin-induced
facilitation of socially evoked fear.
In summary, we demonstrated that ACC neuronal repre-
sentation of self-experienced pain and vicarious pain overlaps at
the single-cell level and that this overlapping representation may
underlie shared affective states between individuals. Moreover,
our study revealed that the overlapping representation was
increased by acute administration of ethanol. Our data were
obtained exclusively from a fear observational system in mice,
and extrapolation to other empathetic states requires care; how-
ever, our findings provide insights into the role of ethanol in
sociality.
Methods
Animals. Male 4- to 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were
housed under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity (23 ± 1 °C, 55 ±
5%), maintained on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle with the lights on from 7:00 a.m. to
7:00 p.m., and had access to food and water ad libitum. Animal experiments were
performed with the approval of the animal experiment ethics committee at the
University of Tokyo (approval numbers: P24-70 and P29-11) and according to the
University of Tokyo guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. These
experimental protocols were carried out in accordance with the Fundamental
Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in
Academic Research Institutions (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology, Notice No. 71 of 2006), the Standards for Breeding and Housing
of and Pain Alleviation for Experimental Animals (Ministry of the Environment,
Notice No. 88 of 2006) and the Guidelines on the Method of Animal Disposal
(Prime Minister’s Office, Notice No. 40 of 1995).
Drugs. The doses of ethanol (1.5 g/kg for systemic injection, 7.0 μg/side for intra-
ACC injection, Wako) were determined based on the blood ethanol concentrations
observed with daily alcohol consumption in humans27,28, and on previous studies
of rodent behavior55,73. The concentration of ethanol (50 mM) in in vitro
experiments using brain slices was based on the normal intrabrain concentration
after systemic injection of ethanol35. The doses of other drugs were also chosen
with reference to previous reports of rodent behavior (MK801: 0.1 mg/kg74, Tocris
Bioscience; L-368,899: 5 mg/kg, 4.1 μg/side75, Tocris Bioscience; picrotoxin: 0.3 μg/
side76, Nacarai Tesque; clonazepam: 79 ng/side77, Wako). For behavioral experi-
ments, all drugs except for clonazepam were diluted in 0.9% saline. Clonazepam

 was diluted in 0.9% saline with 0.1% DMSO (Nacarai Tesque) because it is
hydrophobic. The injected volumes were 10 ml/kg for systemic injection and 0.5 μl/
side for intra-ACC injection.
Fear observation. For the fear observation test, two cagemates were defined as
either the observer or demonstrator and were individually placed in chambers that
were partitioned by a transparent plastic plate. The chamber for the observer had
plastic walls and a flat white floor (19 cm in width, 16 cm in depth, and 27 cm in
height). The chamber for the demonstrator (shock chamber) had plastic walls and a
metal grid floor (18 cm in width, 11 cm in depth, and 11 cm in height) connected to
a shock scrambler (SGA-2010, O’HARA, Tokyo, Japan). One mouse was placed in
each chamber for 5 min, and then the demonstrator received a 1-s foot shock
(1 mA) every 12 s for 4 min. During the fear observation period, the animals were
recorded at 2 Hz using a top-view digital camera. Immobility was automatically
identified using a custom-made MATLAB (R2013b; MathWorks, Natick, Massa-
chusetts, USA) routine74. After denoising the image, the mouse in each video frame
was binarized, and the body motion was detected by calculating the number of
pixels in which the binary values changed between two successive video frames.
Immobility time was defined based on the total number of frames in which the
number of pixel changes was below the threshold. The threshold was determined
such that the detected immobility was comparable to that obtained manually by
three well-trained experimenters. In the PS + FO group, observers received a single
priming foot shock (1 mA, 2 s) prior to fear observation. A priming shock was
given immediately after the observer was placed in a shock chamber. Immediately
after the shock delivery, the observer was returned to its home cage.
Tail pinch. The base of the mouse’s tail was pinched for 5 s using an artery clip
(4.5 cm in length). The latency until the mice tried to remove the tail clip was
recorded, and only those that attempted to remove the clip within 1 s were used in
the fear observation test.
Forced swimming. Individual mice were forced to swim inside a vertical Plexiglas
cylinder (inner ϕ = 12 cm). The water temperature was 22 ± 1 °C, the depth was
15 cm, and the above-water wall height was 8 cm. The mice were kept in the water
for 15 min, and within that time period, all mice began spending 60% of their time
immobile. The mice were then returned to their home cages. The water was
changed for each mouse.
Open field test. In each experiment, a mouse was placed in the center of a square,
white plastic box (40 cm in width, 40 cm in depth, and 30 cm in height) with an
open top. The test was conducted under the room brightness of 165 lux. A camera
was installed above the center of the field to monitor the instantaneous position of
the mouse. The total distance traveled for 10 min by each mouse was measured.
Ethanol (1.5 g/kg) or saline was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before the test.
Elevated plus-maze test. Individual mice were placed in the center of a maze with
four arms arranged in the shape of a plus sign. The maze consisted of a central
quadrangle (8 cm in width and 8 cm in length), two opposing open arms (25 cm in
length and 8 cm in width), and two opposing closed arms. These four arms were
identical in size, but the closed arms were equipped with 25-cm high walls at both
the sides and the far end. The floorboard was made of white plastic, and elevated
25 cm above the ground, and the walls were made of opaque gray plastic. At the
beginning of each trial, the mice were placed on the central quadrangle facing an
open arm. The apparatus was illuminated by ceiling lights at 165 lux. The move-
ments of the mice during a period of 5 min were recorded by a camera positioned
above the center of the maze. The numbers of entries into the open arms and the
closed arms and the time spent in each arm were manually determined. An entry
into an arm was defined as placement of all four paws on that arm. The number of
open-arm entries is expressed as a percentage of the total arm entries, i.e., open-
arm entries/(open-arm entries + closed-arm entries) × 100.
Shock threshold test for pain sensitivity. In each experiment, a mouse was
placed in a shock chamber consisting of a plastic box (18 cm in width, 11 cm in
depth, and 11 cm in height), four transparent walls and a metal grid floor con-
nected to a shock scrambler (SGA-2010, O’HARA, Tokyo, Japan). Repetitive 1-s
foot shocks were manually applied to the mouse at intervals of at least 30 s, and a
well-trained experimenter observed the behavioral responses. Shock intensities
started at 10 μA and increased at every 10-μA step until both a detectable reflex
muscle response and vocalization were induced. The minimal intensity of shock
necessary for inducing these responses was defined as the shock threshold. Ethanol
(1.5 g/kg) or saline was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before the test.
Acetic acid-induced writhing test. Pain sensitivity was evaluated by measuring
the acetic acid-induced writhing responses12,78. Acetic acid (0.9%) was intraper-
itoneally injected at a volume of 10 ml/kg into mice that were placed in a plastic
cage (18 cm in width, 11 cm in depth, and 11 cm in height) 5 min before the test.
Mice were habituated to these cages for 30 min before injection, and their move-
ments were video-recorded for 10 min. A stretching behavior of the hind limbs
accompanied by a contraction of the abdominal muscles was defined as a writhing
response. From each video, a total of 30 periods (each 5 s in length) were extracted
at an interval of 20 s. A blinded observer judged whether the writhing behaviors
were present or absent in these 5-s video clips. The writhing frequency was
expressed as the percentage of video clips with writhing responses.
Sample preparation and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Mice were sacrificed
5 min after the fear observation test was finished, and their brains were removed
and frozen quickly. In situ hybridization was performed as followings33. Coronal
brain sections (20 μm) were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe (1.5 μg/
ml). The signals were detected with an anti-digoxigenin-HRP antibody (1:500;
Roche, Cat# 11207733910, RRID: AB_514500) and then with biotinyl tyramide
(1:5000) and Alexa 488-conjugated or Alexa 594-conjugated streptavidin (Invi-
trogen). The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst. Z-stacks of 1-μm-thick
optical sections were acquired with a CV1000 confocal microscope using a 40×
objective lens (Yokogawa). The majority of cells exhibited whole, large nuclei
stained diffusely with the Hoechst dye. Only these putative neurons were included
in the analysis. The designation “nuclear positive” or “Nuc+” indicates neurons
that exhibited one or two of the intensely fluorescent intranuclear bodies. The
designation “cytoplasmic positive” or “Cyto+” indicates neurons that contained
perinuclear/cytoplasmic labeling across multiple optical sections. An overlap score
between neuronal populations that were active during the priming shock and the
fear observation was defined as (D – chance level)/(N – chance level), in which C
(percentage of total Cyto+ cells) represents cytoplasm only (%) plus Nuc+&Cyto+
(%); N (percentage of total Nuc+ cells) represents nucleus only (%) plus Nuc
+&Cyto+ (%); D represents percentage of cells in which Arc signals were observed
in both the cytoplasm and nucleus; the chance level was defined as C × N /100.
Surgery for microinjection. Under intraperitoneal xylazine (10 mg/kg) and pen-
tobarbital (25 mg/kg) anesthesia, mice were bilaterally implanted with 26-gauge
stainless steel guide cannulae (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, United States) into the
ACC (A/P 1.0 mm, L/M ± 0.2 mm, D/V 2.0 mm) or BLA (A/P 1.3 mm, L/M ± 3.3
mm, D/V 4.8 mm). These cannulae were fixed to the skull using a mixture of
acrylic and dental cement, and 33-gauge dummy cannulae were then inserted into
the guide cannulae to prevent clogging. Mice were given at least seven days of
postoperative recovery time. For microinjection, an infusion cannula was carefully
inserted into each guide cannula. Drug solution or an equivalent volume of saline
was bilaterally infused at a rate of 0.25 µl/min under free-moving conditions in a
plastic cage (18 cm in width, 11 cm in depth, and 11 cm in height). The infusion
cannulae were left in place for 2 min to avoid backward diffusion of the solution
into the guide cannulae.
In vitro electrophysiology. Acute neocortical slices containing the ACC area were
prepared from postnatal week 3–4 mice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
and decapitated, and the brain was coronally sliced (400 μm thick) in an ice-cold
oxygenated cutting solution consisting of (in mM) 222.1 sucrose, 27 NaHCO3, 1.4
NaH2PO4, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 7 MgSO4, and 0.5 ascorbic acid using a vibratome.
Slices were allowed to recover for at least 1 h while submerged in a chamber filled
with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at room temperature. aCSF
consisted of (in mM) 27 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.6 KCl, 1.24 KH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.4
CaCl2, and 10 glucose. Recordings were performed in a submerged chamber per-
fused at 3 ml/min with oxygenated aCSF at 34–37 °C. Whole-cell patch-clamp
current-clamped recordings were obtained, before and during bath application of
50 mM ethanol or 500 μM 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), from layer
II/III ACC pyramidal cells, which were visually identified under an infrared dif-
ferential interference contrast microscope (DAGE-MTI IR-1000). Patch pipettes
(3–6 MΩ) were filled with a Cs-based solution consisting of (in mM) 130
CsMeSO4, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and
10 QX-314. Fast-spiking interneurons were rejected based on their short time
constants (≤2.0 ms) and nonadaptive spiking patterns. The synaptic conductance
was calculated by dividing the charge (the time integral of excitatory/inhibitory
postsynaptic currents) by the driving force (clamped voltage)42. This measure is
believed to reflect general synaptic efficacy, including the amplitudes, durations,
and frequencies of synaptic events79.
Poly(I:C) preparation and gestational exposure. A maternal immune activation
mouse model was established according to Naviaux et al.80. Briefly, pregnant dams
received two doses of intraperitoneal poly(I:C) (potassium salt; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA, Cat# P9582) by injection (0.25 U/g [3 mg/kg] on E12.5 and 0.125
U/g [1.5 mg/kg] on E17.5), and the offspring were used for the experiments. As a
control group, saline was injected into pregnant females (referred to as the Vehicle
group). In the fear observation test, naïve mice of the same age were used as
demonstrators. Each demonstrator was pair-housed with an observer mouse for
1 week before the test.
Contextual fear conditioning. Fear conditioning was performed in a shock
chamber consisting of a plastic box (18 cm in width, 11 cm in depth, and 11 cm
in height) with transparent walls and a metal grid floor connected to a shock
scrambler (SGA-2010, O’HARA, Tokyo, Japan). Mice received a foot shock

 (1 mA, 1 s) 300 s after placement in the chamber and received three additional
shocks of the same intensity every 60 s. They were returned to the home cage 60 s
after the last shock. The animals were replaced in the same chamber 2 and 24 h
later, and their movements were video-recorded for 5 min. Immobility time was
calculated as described above.
Data analysis. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to confirm the normality of data
distributions. The Student t test, paired t test, Mann–Whitney U test, and t-based
bootstrap test were used for comparisons between two groups. One-way analysis of
variance, Kruskal–Wallis test and t-based bootstrap test were used for comparisons
among more than two independent groups. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
