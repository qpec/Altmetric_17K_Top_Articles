ABSTRACT Epilepsy is a neural disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Bang-sensitive Drosophila represent an important model
for studying epilepsy and neuronal excitability. Previous work identified the bang-sensitive gene slamdance (sda) as an allele of the
aminopeptidase N gene. Here we show through extensive genetic analysis, including recombination frequency, deficiency mapping,
transposon insertion complementation testing, RNA interference (RNAi), and genetic rescue that the gene responsible for the seizure
sensitivity is julius seizure (jus), formerly CG14509, which encodes a novel transmembrane domain protein. We also describe more
severe genetic alleles of jus. RNAi-mediated knockdown of jus revealed that it is required only in neurons and not glia, and that partial
bang-sensitivity is caused by knockdown in GABAergic or cholinergic but not glutamatergic neurons. RNAi knockdown of jus at the
early pupal stages leads to strong seizures in adult animals, implicating that stage as critical for epileptogenesis. A C-terminal-tagged
version of Jus was generated from a fosmid genomic clone. This fosmid fusion rescued the bang-sensitive phenotype and was
expressed in the optic lobes and the subesophageal and thoracic abdominal ganglia. The protein was primarily localized in axons,
especially in the neck connectives, extending into the thoracic abdominal ganglion.

E
PILEPSY is a debilitating neurological disorder character-
ized by unprovoked recurrent seizures and increased
seizure susceptibility, affecting 50 million people worldwide
(World Health Organization 2016). Despite its remarkable
prevalence, there are few effective treatments for the disease.
Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) act in relatively nonspe-
cific ways, even though there are a myriad of different seizure
types and etiologies. AEDs may provide initial relief, but
many patients gradually develop resistance to the drugs
and approximately one-third of patients are refractory to
any combinations of AEDs. The inadequacy of current treat-
ments for epilepsy reflects our lack of understanding of epi-
leptogenesis, how a brain becomes seizure prone.
A variety of model organisms have been used to study the
genetic causes of epilepsy, including zebrafish (Cunliffe 2016)
and Drosophila (Song and Tanouye 2008). Behavioral screens
in Drosophila have identified mutants and the underlying genes
that cause a “bang-sensitive” (BS) behavioral phenotype, that
is, they paralyze and seize following mechanical or electrical
stimulation (Pavlidis et al. 1994; Lee and Wu 2002; Fergestad
et al. 2006; Parker et al. 2010). One such BS mutant, slamdan-
ceiso7.8 (sdaiso7.8), although otherwise behaviorally normal, ex-
hibits neuronal hyperexcitability and paralysis for �20 sec
when subjected to mechanical shock (Zhang et al. 2002). Ge-
netic analysis attributed the sda phenotype to a mutation in the
Drosophila homolog of the human aminopeptidase N gene. Elec-
trophysiological analysis has shown that the mutation causes
seizure sensitivity by lowering the voltage threshold (Zhang
et al. 2002). Voltage clamp studies on first and third instar
larvae reveal that this may be caused by increased persistent
sodium current in motoneurons, causing longer plateau depo-
larizations and a greater number of action potentials compared
to wild-type flies (Marley and Baines 2011).
The aminopeptidase N gene of Drosophila is located on 3R
at polytene bands 97D7–97D9 (Attrill et al. 2016). Although
Zhang et al. (2002) performed a thorough genetic analysis of
the mutant with existing x-ray-induced deficiencies, we ob-
served a higher than expected recombination frequency

 (14.7%) between sdaiso7.8 and the transposon insertion line
P[GawB]386Y, which has an insertion site near the gene amon
at polytene bands 97C4–97C5 and sdaiso7.8 complemented mo-
lecularly defined deficiencies from the aminopeptidase N locus.
This suggested that the sda locus had been mislocalized
to aminopeptidase N. Here we demonstrate that the
sdaiso7.8 is an allele of an uncharacterized protein-coding
gene CG14509, which we name julius seizure (jus), after the
Roman emperor who reportedly suffered from epilepsy
(Hughes 2004). jus is located at polytene bands 98F10–
99A1, over 2.2 Mbp away from the aminopeptidase N gene.
This claim is supported with deficiency mapping, transposon
insertions, recombination frequencies, RNA interference
(RNAi), and genetic rescue. A comparison of seizure recovery
durations of different alleles and RNAi-mediated knockdowns
indicate that the sdaiso7.8 allele is likely a weak hypomorph of
jus. RNAi-directed knockdown of jus revealed that it is re-
quired in neurons and not glia, and that both GABAergic and
cholinergic neurons are important for the bang-sensitive phe-
notype. Jus expression is critical during the early pupal stage as
RNAi-mediated knockdown at that time interval results in
strongly bang-sensitive adults. A fosmid-based GFP fusion of
jus shows that the protein is expressed in neurons of the optic
lobe and strongly in selected neurons of the subesophageal
(SOG) and thoracic abdominal ganglia (TAG).
Materials and Methods
Fly stocks
Fly stocks were maintained on a glucose, yeast, and cornmeal
agar media at 22–25� in plastic vials unless otherwise noted.
The slamdanceiso7.8 mutant was a gift from M. A. Tanouye. Fly
stocks were obtained from either the Bloomington Stock Cen-
ter at Indiana University or from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi
Center (VDRC). When applicable, w1118 (BL #5905) was
used as a control.
Rescue constructs
To assemble the rescue construct, a PvuI–AgeI fragment con-
taining the jus open reading frame (restriction enzymes from
New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was purified from the
GH11945 cDNA clone (obtained from the Drosophila Geno-
mics Resource Center (DGRC), GenBank accession no.
AY128418) ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs)
into PacI–AgeI digested pUAS-c5-attB (Daniels et al. 2014)
and sent to Bestgene (Chino Hills, CA) for transformation
at the 68A4 docking site on chromosome 3. The rescue line
will be referred to as UAS-jus. The UAS-jus transgene was
recombined with sdaiso7.8 for rescue assays. w; UAS-jus,
sdaiso7.8 flies were crossed to P{GawB}elavC155; sdaiso7.8 or
w; P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=GMR55G02-GAL4}attP2, sdaiso7.8
and vortex tested as described below. For fosmid transgenic
generation, clone CBGtg9060B0572D was obtained from
Source BioScience (Nottingham, UK) containing the genomic
locus of jus and tagged at the C terminus with TY1, GFP, V5,
BLRP, and 33Flag (Sarov et al. 2016). The fosmid was sent to
Genetivision (Houston, TX) for injection and transformation
at the VK1(2R)59D3 docking site. Individual lines were
screened for V5 and Flag-tagged immunoreactivity. One line
was selected and it will be referred to as Fos{jus-TGVBF}.
For genomic rescue experiments, w; Fos{jus-TGVBF}/CyO;
PBac[WH]CG14509f04904/+ animals were crossed to sda iso7.8
animals. w+ F1 animals were selected so that all animals tested
were PBac[WH]CG14509f04904/sda iso7.8 and CyO+ animals (no
fosmid) were compared to CyO2 animals (fosmid containing)
in vortex testing (see below).
Vortex testing
Adult flies, at least 3 days posteclosion, were anesthetized with
carbon dioxide and placed in vials containing food and 10 flies
each. Twenty-four hours after CO2 exposure, the flies were
tested for bang sensitivity by vortexing the vial for 10 sec using
the Vortex Genie 2 (VWR Scientific, Radnor, PA) at maximum
speed. The number of flies that seized in response to the stim-
ulus was recorded. Recovery times were determined by record-
ing the interval elapsed for 50% of the flies to right themselves
following the cessation of vortexing. For jus alleles, RNAi with
different GAL4s, and rescue experiments with complementary
DNA (cDNA) and genomic constructs, at least 20 flies of each
genotype were tested, but in most cases, 60–80 flies were
tested. For the RNAi developmental time course with GAL80ts,
50% recovery time was determined by observing when ani-
mals awakened from seizures and attempted to stand. At least
30 flies were tested for each time point. For the fosmid rescue
experiments, at least 60 flies were tested for each genotype.
Complementation testing
sdaiso7.8 was mapped by crossing a series of overlapping mo-
lecularly defined deficiencies to sda iso7.8 homozygotes and
vortex testing the sda iso7.8/Df progeny for complementation.
The deficiencies extended from the gene rough to the gene
claret (�3,000,000 bp) on chromosome 3R. Crosses that yield-
ed nearly 100% bang-sensitive progeny were considered to
have failed to complement sdaiso7.8. Candidate genes were
selected from the overlapping regions of the noncomplement-
ing deficiencies. Fly stocks with transposable element insertion
sites within the candidate genes were also crossed to sdaiso7.8
and vortex tested for complementation. Transposon insertion
lines that failed to complement sdaiso7.8 were considered to
have insertion sites within the same gene as the sdaiso7.8 allele.
Recombination experiments
sda iso7.8 virgin females were crossed to males from the
transposon insertion line w*; P[GawB]386Y. sda iso7.8/w*;
P[GawB]386Y virgin females were then crossed back to sda iso 7.8
males. The recombinant progeny with the genotype w*,
P[GawB]386Y, sda iso 7.8/sda iso 7.8 could be identified as red
eyed and bang sensitive. The number of recombinants were
counted and multiplied by 2 to account for the other unde-
tectable recombinant genotype + sda iso 7.8/+ +. The total
number of recombinants was divided by the total number of
1262
M. Horne et al.
 progeny, and then multiplied by 100 to give the total percentage
of recombination. The same procedure was repeated to calcu-
late the percentage of recombination between sda iso 7.8 and
the transposon insertion line P{y[+mDint2] w[BR.E.BR]=

RNAi

the GAL4 driver line P{GawB}elavC155 (BL#458). Bang-
sensitive RNAi/GAL4 heterozygotes indicated successful
RNAi knockdown. Since the P{GawB}elavC155 GAL4 driver is
x-linked, only female progeny from the cross were RNAi/
GAL4 heterozygotes. The male progeny, which contained
only the RNAi gene or P{GawB}elavC155, were vortex tested
as a control. In most of the subsequent crosses, the P{y[+t7.7]
v[+t1.8]=TRiP.JF03192}attP2 RNAi line was crossed to

 (BL#58409), and OK371-GAL4 (BL#26160). For developmen-
tal studies, an Act5C-GAL4(BL#3954) construct was recombined
with the P{y[+t7.7] v[+t1.8]=TRiP.JF03192}attP2 RNAi line.
The resulting line was crossed to w[*]; P{w[+mC]=tubP-
GAL80ts; TM2/TM6B, Tb (BL#7108) and the resulting progeny
were incubated at either 22� or 29� at different developmental
stages. P{w[+mC]=tubP-GAL80ts/+; Act5C-GAL4, P{y[+t7.7]
v[+t1.8]=TRiP.JF03192}attP2/TM2 or TM6B, Tb, Hu animals
were selected and then vortex tested as described above. More
than 30 animals were tested for each time point.
Electrophysiological methods
Physiological recordings were performed on the giant fiber
(GF) pathway essentially as described (Howlett and Tanouye
2009). Flies were immobilized in dental wax and a small hole
was made through the cuticle of the thorax with a sharpened
tungsten needle to reveal the dorsal longitudinal flight muscle
(DLM). Two uninsulated sharpened tungsten electrodes were
inserted through the head cuticle into the brain and another
into the abdomen as a ground and fourth sharpened 2.5 MV
insulated recording electrode (MicroProbes, Gaithersburg,
MD) was inserted through the opening of the thorax into the
flight muscle. Stimuli were generated by a Grass S88 stimula-
tor and recordings were picked up by an A-M Systems AC
1800 amplifier (Sequim, WA) at a gain of 100 times and filter
settings of between 10 Hz and 5 kHz. Signals were digitized by
a Digidata 1322a (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and
recorded with pCLAMP8 software (Molecular Devices). GF
threshold and high-frequency stimulation protocols were as
described (Howlett and Tanouye 2009). Seizure intervals
were measured from the last spike of the initial seizure to
the first spike of the recovery seizure.
Antibody staining
Fos{jus-TGVBF} flies were briefly anesthetized in CO2, then
dipped in ethanol and dissected in Ca2+-free HL3 saline,
fixed, and stained as described (Lawton et al. 2014). After
staining, brains were postfixed for 15 min, rinsed, then
mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).
Mouse anti-V5 was used at 1:250 and secondary donkey
anti-mouse Alexa-488 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) was used
at 1:1000. Brains were imaged on an inverted Zeiss LSM
880 confocal microscope with C-Achroplan 323/0.85 Corr
M27 water lens. Images are maximal projections of confocal
stacks as processed by Zen (Peabody, MA) or Imaris software
v8.2.0 (Bitplane, Concord, MA).
Western blot
Ten heads from Fos{jus-TGVBF} were ground up in loading
buffer, heated to 95� for 3 min, loaded onto a 10% polyacryl-
amide gel, electrophoresed, and blotted onto Immobilon-P
PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were
blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk PBS with 0.05% Tween
20 (PBST), probed with anti-Flag M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) at 1:1000 dilution in PBST with 1% BSA, washed
and probed with donkey anti-mouse HRP (Jackson Immuno-
research, West Grove, PA) at 1:5000 dilution, washed in PBST,
and incubated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Blots were ex-
posed to BioMAX Light Film (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 sec.
Statistics
One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison’s test or
the Student’s t-test for pairwise comparisons were used as
appropriate. Significance testing and graphing was per-
formed with GraphPad Prism 8 software (La Jolla, CA).

Results
Complementation testing and recombination mapping
In our initial experiments, three lines of evidence suggested
that the previous mapping of sdaiso7.8 to 97D had been
inaccurate. First, initial recombination of sdaiso7.8, with a pre-
dicted nearby w+ marked P-element at polytene band 97C4-
5 revealed nearly a 15% recombination rate, suggesting that
the mutation is distant from the reported 97D7–9 location.
Second, recombination with w+ P-element and the dominant

 marker Dr indicated the sda locus was very near 99F12–99A
(Table 1). Third, the large, molecularly defined deficiency Df
(3R)ED6255 spanning the reported sda locus aminopeptidase
N complemented the sdaiso7.8 allele (Figure 1, A and B).
To remap the sda locus, a series of molecularly defined
deficiencies spanning from polytene bands 96E to 99B were
crossed to sdaiso7.8 (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows the percent-
age of bang-sensitive flies for each sdaiso7.8/Df combination.
The deficiencies Df(3R)ED6310, Df(3R)BSC874, and Df(3R)
BSC501 all failed to complement sdaiso7.8 and had an over-
lapping region between 3R: 29,138,895 and 3R: 29,191,671.
Candidate genes with high levels of expression in the nervous
system were chosen from this region for further investigation.
We then crossed sdaiso7.8 to flies containing transposon
insertions within the candidate genes. The transposon/
sdaiso7.8 transheterozygotes were vortex tested for behavioral
complementation. Table 2 shows the percentage of bang-
sensitive progeny for each genotype. The only stock that
failed to complement sdaiso7.8, PBac[WH]CG14509f04904,
contained an insertion site in an intron near the 59 end of
CG14509. Two other fly stocks, Mi[MIC]CG14509MI11213 and
Mi[ET1]CG14509MB12140, each with different transposon inser-
tion sites within CG14509, largely complemented sdaiso7.8 with
7.5 and 0% bang sensitivity, respectively, suggesting that they
do not significantly disrupt the expression of CG14509 (Table
2). Hemizygous combinations of sdaiso7.8 with Dfs resulted in
significantly longer recovery times than sdaiso7.8 homozy-
gotes (Figure 2). These data strongly point to CG14509 as
the gene responsible for the bang sensitivity. The coding se-
quence of CG14509, which we now refer to as Jus, consists of
a protein of �50 kDa with two predicted transmembrane
Figure 2 Recovery times of jus alleles. The 50% recovery times of allelic
combinations of jus are shown. The original sdaiso7.8 is a fairly weak hypo-
morph, while PBac[WH]CG14509f04904 is a stronger hypomorph but not a
null as revealed by the longer recovery time of PBac[WH]CG14509f04904/Df.
The strongest allelic combination of PBac[WH]CG14509f04904/Df(3R)BSC501
has a .10-fold recovery time as compared to that of sdaiso7.8. Significant
differences were observed between all allelic combinations (indicated with
**** p , 0.0001) except for sdaiso7.8 vs. sdaiso7.8/PBac[WH]CG14509f04904
and sdaiso7.8/Df(3R)501 vs. sdaiso7.8/Df(3R)874. Error bars are 6SEM.

 domains and an extracellular loop with multiple cysteine
residues, presumably forming disulfide bonds. The extracel-
lular loop is the only region expected to possess any signifi-
cant organized secondary structure (Kelley et al. 2015).
Genetic rescue
To further confirm that the defect in the sdaiso7.8 allele is due to a
mutation in jus, genetic rescue was performed. Using a UAS-jus
rescue construct and the panneural driver, elav-gal4, sdaiso7.8
homozygotes were rescued 100% in a vortex test assay (n =
20). Similar results were obtained in rescuing sdaiso7.8/Df mu-
tants (97% rescue, n = 36). The GAL4 line, w; P{y[+t7.7]
w[+mC]=GMR55G02-GAL4}attP2, from the genomic locus of
jus as the driver, was able to rescue 85% of the flies from bang
sensitivity (n = 61). Since UAS-jus rescued the sdaiso7.8 allele, we
attempted to identify the mutation responsible in sdaiso7.8 for the
bang-sensitive phenotype. However, we failed to detect any mu-
tation affecting the coding sequence by exon sequencing of jus.
RNAi
If the bang-sensitive phenotype results from a loss of jus func-
tion, it is predicted that knocking down jus expression would
lead to the seizure phenotype. We tested three different RNAi
lines: P{GD352}v4434, P{GD352}v4435, and P{y[+t7.7]
v[+t1.8]=TRiP.JF03192}attP2. Crossing each RNAi line to
P{GawB}elavC155 resulted in 100% bang sensitivity when
both transgenes were present, as compared to 0% in the
control without the GAL4 driver. Expression of RNAi with a
glial driver did not cause bang sensitivity. Expression in sub-
sets of neurons using either GABAergic or cholinergic drivers
resulted in varying percentages of bang-sensitive adults, but
expression using a glutamatergic-specific GAL4, OK371, had
no effect (Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained with
another independent glutamatergic driver (data not shown).
Using the strong Act5C-GAL4 in combination with P{y[+t7.7]
v[+t1.8]=TRiP.JF03192}attP2 resulted in bang-sensitive flies
with extremely long recovery times (Figure 3B), �10 times
greater than the sdaiso7.8 allele.
Seizure phenotype
One of the hallmarks of bang-sensitive mutants is the in-
duction of the phenotype with electrical stimulation (Song
and Tanouye 2008). High-frequency stimulation of the
sdaiso7.8 resulted in an initial seizure followed by a recov-
ery seizure, as has been previously reported (Zhang et al.
2002). Similar seizures were observed in the transposon
PBac[WH]CG14509f04904 homozygous line (Figure 4A). The
seizure thresholds of each genotype did not differ signifi-
cantly (7.75 V 6 0.3227 for sdaiso7.8 and 8.67 V 6 0.3727
P = 0.0786, two-tailed Student’s t-test). One striking differ-
ence in the PBac[WH]CG14509f04904 line was the inter-
val between the initial and the secondary seizure. sdaiso7.8
homozygotes had a mean interval of 29 6 4.3 sec, while
PBac[WH]CG14509f04904 had a significantly longer mean in-
terval of 56 6 14.0 sec (P = 0.0002, t-test, one tail, unpaired),
consistent with its longer recovery time following vortexing.
Expression in the CNS
To identify the expression pattern of jus, a fosmid clone (Sarov
et al. 2016) containing the full genomic region of jus with
in-frame tags of GFP, 33Flag, and V5 at its C terminus (Fig-
ure 5A) was inserted at a docking site at the distal end of
chromosome 2R. To assess the expression of this transgenic
Fos{jus-TGVBF}, a Western blot from head extracts was

dicted size for the tagged Jus protein of �90 kDa (Figure 5B).
No Flag immunoreactive band was detected in w1118 head ex-
tract controls (data not shown). To test the functionality of Jus-
TGVBF, we crossed the PBac transposon allele of jus to sdaiso7.8
with or without the Fos{jus-TGVBF} rescue construct. While
both sets of flies seized, the PBac[WH]CG14509f04904/sdaiso7.8
animals containing a single copy of the Fos{jus-TGVBF} rescue
construct recovered significantly faster than controls (P ,
0.0001), indicating the C-terminally tagged Jus is functional
(Figure 5C). To localize the tagged protein, an anti-V5 antibody
was used to stain Fos{jus-TGVBF} adult brains. The brain
showed expression in the optic lobes, SOG, and TAG (Figure
5, D–F). On the subcellular level, Jus-TGVBF is found abun-
dantly in neuronal processes, especially axons. In the optic
lobes, localization of Jus-TGVBF is found in synaptic layers
and in dendritic processes (Figure 5E), suggesting that Jus+
neurons are involved in visual processing. Similarly, strong
Jus-TGVBF localization is observed in the neck connectives,
which are composed of descending axons (Figure 5, D and
F). In the SOG, strong protein localization is observed in se-
lected cell bodies as well as in axons projecting to the TAG. In
the TAG, most of the expression is found in axons that traverse
T1, T2, T3, and the abdominal segment.
Critical period
To assess whether jus expression is required during development
for the bang-sensitive phenotype, the Act5c . RNAi line was
crossed to a w; P{w[+mC]=tubP-GAL80ts and incubated at
22�, then shifted to 29� at selected developmental stages. At
continuous 29� incubation, GAL80ts is inactivated and the RNAi
is transcribed, resulting in 100% of the progeny being bang

 sensitive with long severe seizures and extended time for full
recovery
. Continuous incubation at 22� resulted in the majority
of the flies with bang sensitivity but with much more rapid re-
covery
, likely owing to a combination of the strength ofthe Act5C-
GAL4 driver and some leakiness of GAL80ts at 22� (Figure 6A).
The recovery time of these animals was in a narrow time window
(�20 sec), with animals fully recovering mobility upon awaken-
ing from seizures (Figure 6B). To define the critical time window
for jus expression, crosses were started at 22�, then progeny were
shifted at the second instar, third instar, early pupal, or midpupal
stages to 29�. All animals (100%) shifted to 29� at the second
instar, third instar and the early pupal stage were bang sensitive
as adults. Those shifted at the midpupal (P4–P6) and those
raised completely at 22� show less than complete bang sensitivity
(Figure 6A,B). Interestingly
, animals that shifted to 29� as late as
the early pupal stage had seizures that were statistically no dif-
ferent from those of second or third instar but differed signifi-
cantly from animals shifted at the midpupal stage.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that the sdaiso 7.8 phenotype is caused
by a mutation in the protein coding gene, CG14509, which
we designate julius seizure (jus). The only deficiencies that
failed to complement sdaiso7.8 during genetic mapping were
Df(3R)ED6310, Df(3R)BSC874, and Df(3R)BSC501, which
had an overlapping region between 3R: 29,138,895 and 3R:
29,191,671 (Figure 1). Of the candidate genes chosen from this
region, only CG14509 exhibited bang sensitivity when disrupted
with transposon insertion PBac[WH]CG14509f04904 in combina-
tion with sdaiso7.8. Low recombination rates between w+
marked transposons and the dominant marker Dr in the jus
region are also consistent with CG14509 being the sda locus.
RNAi knockdown of CG14509, with three different RNAi lines:
P{GD352]v4434, P{GD352}v4435, and P{y[+t7.7] v[+t1.8]=
TRiP.JF03192}attP2 using a panneural GAL4 driver, provided
confirming evidence. Genetic rescue of sdaiso7.8 with a jus cDNA
and genomic fosmid construct strongly supports the notion that
sdaiso7.8 is an allele of jus. Earlier mapping efforts of sda may
have been misled by the use of x-ray-induced deficiencies that
may have chromosomal aberrations outside of the 97D region.
The Jus protein is predicted to have intracellular N and C
termini, two transmembrane domains and an extracellular loop
containing 12 cysteines that likely form disulfide bonds. A
proteomic study of Drosophila membrane proteins identified
CG14509 as a membrane protein (Khanna et al. 2010), consis-
tent with its two predicted transmembrane domains. Though
the protein bears no significant homology to vertebrate proteins
and the only recognizable domain, the EB domain (Marchler-
Bauer et al. 2015), has no described function, jus clearly has
importance in regulating neuronal excitability during Drosoph-
ila development. It is possible that another protein, without
detectable sequence homology, plays a similar functional role
in vertebrates. Further studies will be directed at understanding
which proteins and pathways are affected by jus.
Like other bang-sensitive mutants, seizures may be trig-
gered by direct high-frequency stimulation of the brains of jus
mutants. Here we show seizures in sdaiso7.8 like those pre-
viously reported (Zhang et al. 2002) and the seizure pheno-
type in the transposon allele, PBac[WH]CG14509f04904.
Notably, the interval between the initial seizure and recovery
seizure is significantly longer with the transposon allele. This
difference is in agreement with the much longer recovery
times following mechanical stimulation.

 TheexpressionofJus-TCVBFobservedintheopticlobesandin
many descending axons in the neck is suggestive of a role in
transmitting sensory information to the thoracic abdominal gan-
glion. Additional roles of Jus in sensory processing come from an
earlier study in which a transposon allele in CG14509 was found
to have defective olfactory responses (Sambandan et al. 2006).
The overall pattern of Jus neuronal expression is suggestive of a
network of interconnected neurons that may function to stabilize
excitability
, analogous to the network of Fru+ neurons involved
in all aspects of courtship (reviewed in Yamamoto 2007).
RNAi-mediated knockdown of jus in various neuronal pop-
ulations was an effective approach to identify the neurons that
regulate bang sensitivity. Panneural GAL4-driven RNAi expres-
sion results in strongly bang-sensitive flies, while glial or
glutamatergic drivers have no effect. Both GABAergic and
cholinergic drivers generate bang-sensitive adults, indicating
that these neuronal types are important for the phenotype.
For each of the neurotransmitter-specific GAL4 drivers tested,
other independent GAL4 lines, under control of genomic DNA
for vesicular transporters for GABA and acetylcholine, were
also used to drive RNAi expression. Similar seizure suscepti-
bility results were obtained (data not shown). Developmen-
tally controlled expression of RNAi using GAL4/GAL80ts
indicated that preadult expression of jus is important for reg-
ulating neuronal excitability. This is in agreement with previ-
ous work that indicated that increasing neural activity at either
the embryonic or pupal stages can result in a hyperexcitable
phenotype (Giachello and Baines 2015). Interestingly, we
identified the early pupal stage as important for determining
the seizure severity. Further studies can define the neuronal
processes impacted by a lack of jus during pupal development.
