CLINICAL STATEMENTS 
AND GUIDELINES
BACKGROUND: Poor lifestyle behaviors are leading causes of preventable 
diseases globally. Added sugars contribute to a diet that is energy dense 
but nutrient poor and increase risk of developing obesity, cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, obesity-related cancers, and dental caries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: For this American Heart Association scientific 
statement, the writing group reviewed and graded the current scientific 
evidence for studies examining the cardiovascular health effects of added 
sugars on children. The available literature was subdivided into 5 broad 
subareas: effects on blood pressure, lipids, insulin resistance and diabetes 
mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: Associations between added sugars and increased 
cardiovascular disease risk factors among US children are present at 
levels far below current consumption levels. Strong evidence supports 
the association of added sugars with increased cardiovascular disease 
risk in children through increased energy intake, increased adiposity, and 
dyslipidemia. The committee found that it is reasonable to recommend 
that children consume ≤25 g (100 cal or ≈6 teaspoons) of added sugars 
per day and to avoid added sugars for children <2 years of age. Although 
added sugars most likely can be safely consumed in low amounts as part 
of a healthy diet, few children achieve such levels, making this an important 
public health target.

A
therosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the 
leading cause of death in North Americans and 
generates tremendous personal and economic 
burden globally. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of CVD 
and its associated conditions (obesity, hypertension, 
type II diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver dis-
ease [NAFLD]) have focused attention on the role of diet 
and the growing evidence that atherosclerosis starts in 
childhood.1–3 Accumulating evidence implicates dietary 
sugars, particularly those added to processed foods or 
used in the preparation of foods and beverages. In part 
because of the lack of clarity and consensus on how 
much sugar is considered safe for children, sugars re-
main a commonly added ingredient in foods and drinks, 
and overall consumption by children and adults remains 
high. Although intake of added sugars has decreased 
slightly in recent years,4 they still contribute nearly 16% 
of the calories consumed by US children daily (Table 1).
The purposes of this statement are to review the 
available evidence on added sugars intake and CVD risk 
in children and adolescents, to identify research gaps, 
and to make recommendations on the consumption of 
added sugars intake to reduce CVD risk.
APPROACH
The writing group members conducted literature 
searches for each section using relevant search terms, 
including sugar, fructose, added sugars, dietary, sugar-
sweetened beverages, sweeteners, children, noncaloric 
sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, nonnutritive sweeten-
ers, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, triglycerides, 
lipids, cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk, uric 
acid, hypertension, blood pressure, allopurinol, liver, ste-
atohepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and inflam-
mation. The PubMed searches were limited to original 
research, studies conducted in humans, and systematic 
reviews through November 2015. The reference lists of 
relevant articles were reviewed for additional articles. 
The articles were summarized, and the summaries were 
discussed during conference calls among the topic area 
experts who were part of the writing group. Group con-
sensus was used to develop recommendations (Table 2).
To provide the most up-to-date estimates of added 
sugar consumption in the United States, dietary data 
from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey) 2009 to 2012 were analyzed. NHANES 
data are collected and made publically available by the 
National Center for Health Statistics. The analytical meth-
ods used replicate5 those used by Welsh et al in their 
analysis of NHANES data from 1999 through 2008.4
TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS
There are several different forms of dietary sugars, 
and the terminology used to describe them can be a 
source of confusion for researchers, policy makers, 
and consumers. Commonly used terms are described 
below.
Sugar
Although commonly used more broadly, the US Federal 
Drug Administration defines the term sugar as a sweet, 
crystalline substance, C12H22O11, obtained chiefly from 
the juice of the sugarcane and the sugar beet.6
Total Sugars
The term total sugars is used conventionally to describe 
the monosaccharides glucose, galactose, and fructose, 
as well as the disaccharides sucrose, lactose, maltose, 
and trehalose.7 Total sugars include all sugars in a food 
or beverage from any source, including those naturally 
occurring (such as fructose in fruit and lactose in milk) 
and those added to foods.6
Added Sugars
Added sugars, as defined by the US Department of Ag-
riculture, include all sugars used as ingredients in pro-
cessed and prepared foods and sugars eaten separately 
or added to foods at the table.8 The term was first used 
in the 2000 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans to high-
light foods and beverages that were higher in calories 
but lacked other important nutrients.9 Because fructose 
is the sweetest of the commonly consumed sugars, it 
(or sugars that contain it) is frequently added to foods 
and beverages to increase their palatability. As a result, 
sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, both of which are 
made up of glucose and fructose in approximately equal 
amounts, are the most commonly added sugars in the 
US food supply.
Naturally Occurring Sugars
Naturally occurring sugars include those that are an in-
nate component of foods (eg, fructose in fruits and veg-
etables and lactose in milk and other dairy products).6
Extrinsic and Intrinsic Sugars
The terms extrinsic and intrinsic sugars originated 
from the UK Department of Health. Intrinsic sugars 
are defined as sugars that are present within the cell 
walls of plants (eg, naturally occurring sugars) and 
are always accompanied by other nutrients. Extrinsic 
sugars are those not located within the cellular struc-
ture of a food and are found in fruit juice, honey, and 
syrups and added to processed foods. The term non-
milk extrinsic sugars is used to differentiate lactose-
containing extrinsic sugars from all others because

the metabolic response for the 2 types of sugars dif-
fers substantially.10
Free Sugars
Free sugars is a term used by the World Health Orga-
nization that refers to all monosaccharides and disac-
charides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, 
and consumer (eg, added sugars) plus sugars naturally 
present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices11 (eg, nonmilk 
extrinsic sugars).
CHALLENGES WITH STUDYING SUGARS  
IN THE DIET
Nutrition studies are inherently challenging because hu-
mans have complex activities, diets, and metabolism. In

attempts to study a single nutrient such as sugar, it is im-
possible to isolate its effects completely, especially with 
the known limitations in self-reported diet data from chil-
dren/parents and the short duration feasible with feeding 
studies. For example, adding sugars to a diet may result 
in the intake of excess calories. Some have proposed 
that studies should be adjusted for these effects. Howev-
er, adjustment does not mirror free-living people who do 
not typically adjust their diet or activity level to keep total 
calories at a set level. In fact, the most telling studies of 
the health effect of sugars are probably those in the real 
world. In our approach, we attempted to synthesize the 
body of literature under each topic, including articles that 
reflect real-world effects of sugar and those that attempt 
to discern biological effects of isolated added sugars 
administration while focusing on the goal of making high-
quality recommendations for practice and policy.

A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in 
the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Although randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a 
particular test or therapy is useful or effective.
*Data available from clinical trials or registries about the usefulness/efficacy in different subpopulations, such as sex, age, history of diabetes, history 
of prior myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, and prior aspirin use.

should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS 
AND GUIDELINES
Americans recommendations into food group–based ad-
vice for a healthy diet, suggested a limit ranging from 6% 
to 10% of total calorie intake as discretionary calories 
depending on a child’s age, sex, and level of physical ac-
tivity. Discretionary calories are those available for con-
sumption as added sugars and solid fats once a child’s 
daily nutrient requirements are met. In the same year, 
this recommendation was supported by the American 
Heart Association (AHA) in collaboration with the Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics, which also specified that 
“sweetened beverages and naturally sweet beverages, 
such as fruit juice, should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per 
day for children 1 to 6 years old and to 8 to 12 ounces 
per day for children 7 to 18 years old.”12
According to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans, reducing the consumption of added sugars would 
lower the energy content of the diet without compromis-
ing its nutrient adequacy.13 The guidelines suggested 
that this strategy could play an important role in reducing 
the high prevalence of obesity in the United States. The 
guidelines advised that sweetened foods and beverages 
be replaced with those that have no added sugars or are 
low in added sugars. For example, the guidelines advise 
consumers to “drink water instead of sugary drinks.” Also 
in 2010, the AHA advised that, to achieve and maintain 
healthy weights and to decrease cardiovascular risk while 
meeting essential nutritional needs, adults reduce their 
intake of added sugars.14 The AHA recommended an up-
per limit of intake of added sugars at 100 cal/d or 6 
teaspoons for most American women and 150 cal/d or 9 
teaspoons for most American men. The AHA recommen-
dation focused on all added sugars without singling out 
any particular types such as high-fructose corn syrup.14
The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee re-
leased a scientific report in early 2015 recommending that 
added sugars be limited.15 The report pointed out that in a 
healthy meal pattern, after food group and nutrient recom-
mendations are met, only a limited number of calories are 
available to be consumed as added sugars. Specifically, 
only 3% to 9% of calories would be available from added 
sugars for all patterns, and within the most appropriate pat-
terns (1600–2400 cal), the range is 4% to 6% of calories 
from added sugars (or 4.5–9.4 teaspoons). The expert 
committee concluded that strong and consistent evidence 
shows that intake of added sugars is associated with ex-
cess body weight compatible with a recommendation to 
keep added sugars intake <10% of total energy intake.
Since 2003, the World Health Organization has recom-
mended that the intake of free sugars be limited to <10% 
of total daily energy intake.11 Guidelines released by the 
World Health Organization in 2015 advised that people 
should reduce the amount of free sugars to <10% of 
their daily energy intake.16 The World Health Organization 
further advised that a reduction to <5% of total energy 
intake per day would have additional benefits in reduc-
ing the risk of noncommunicable diseases (specifically 
excess weight gain and dental caries) in adults and chil-
dren.16 Five percent of total energy intake is equivalent to 
≈25 g (≈6 teaspoons or ≈100 kcal) of sugar per day for 
an adult with a healthy body mass index (BMI).
CURRENT INTAKE LEVELS AND LEADING 
SOURCES
We used publically available data from the most recent 
cycles of the NHANES (2009–2012) to estimate current 
levels of added sugars intake.17 These estimates may 
be conservatively low because it is well established that 
self-reported dietary assessments underreport.18,19 Our 
analysis demonstrates that US children 2 to 19 years of 
age consume an average of 80 g added sugar daily (Ta-
ble 1). Absolute intake is higher among boys than girls 
(87 versus 73 g), but there were no differences when 
intake was assessed in relation to total energy intake 
(16.1% for both). Added sugars intake increases with 
age (Figure). Intake of free sugars, the combination of 
added sugars and sugars that occur naturally in honey, 
syrups, and juices, is 91 g and 18.5% total energy.
Foods and beverages each contribute half of the 
added sugars in children’s diets, 40 g each. The top 
contributors to added sugars intake include soda, fruit-
flavored and sports drinks, and cakes and cookies. The 
contribution of added sugars to total energy intake is 
summarized by food or beverage source in Table 1. 
Table 3 illustrates sugars intake in teaspoons by sex 
and age group.20 Previous research has suggested that 
most added sugars are consumed at home rather than 
away from home.21
SUGARS AND CVD RISK: BIOLOGICAL 
MECHANISMS
An ongoing debate exists as to whether fructose and 
glucose are similar in effect given that they are calo-
rically matched but have markedly different metabolic 
fates in the human body. After consumption, digestion, 
and absorption, both fructose and glucose are absorbed 
into the portal circulation and taken up into the liver.22 
The liver has a major role in controlling the amount of 
glucose that reaches peripheral tissues after a meal. In-
creased glucose in the portal blood stimulates insulin 
secretion, leading to increased uptake of glucose into 
muscle and adipose, increased synthesis of glycogen, 
increased fatty acid synthesis in the adipose, increased 
amino acid uptake, and induction of lipoprotein lipase 
into muscle and adipose.22 Fructose does not stimulate 
secretion of insulin to the same extent and is absorbed 
primarily into the liver where it stimulates de novo lipo-
genesis.23 The pathway of de novo lipogenesis produces 
saturated fatty acids, and although it is not a major path-
way in lean individuals (contributing just 10% of fatty ac-

ids in very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride), in obese, 
insulin-resistant individuals, this pathway becomes im-
portant because carbohydrates may provide up to 50% 
of the saturated fatty acids in very-low-density lipoprotein 
triglyceride.24 In 2014, a review of these mechanisms in-
cluded the postulation that because of this effect dietary 
sugars may be “as atherogenic as dietary saturated 
fatty acids.”24 Whether the fructose or glucose causes 
adverse effects may be academically debatable but is 
less important from a clinical standpoint because most 
food and beverage sources outside of research studies 
include both sugars.
Genetics and How They Affect CVD Risk
A further challenge of understanding the role of sugars 
in CVD risk for children is the variability of response 
among individuals. This example of personalized re-
sponse to a nutrient has confounded previous studies, 
but fortunately, recent investigations are revealing the 
underlying mechanisms. Genetics appear to have a pro-
found influence on carbohydrate response. Davis et al25 
demonstrated this in a study of the PNPLA3 (patatin-like 
phospholipase domain containing 3) gene, in which a 
polymorphism of this gene modified the effect of dietary 
sugars on the presence of hepatic fat. Finally, but per-
haps most obviously, the gut plays a critical role in nutri-
ent absorption, response, and modification, and this is 
true for dietary sugars. At this point, little is known about 
the interaction between microbiome and added sugars 
in humans; this is an area that needs study, particularly 
given the data demonstrating relationships between the 
microbiome and CVD risk.26
Metabolic and Satiety Responses to Liquids 
Versus Foods
The form in which added sugars are consumed also may 
influence the metabolic effects. Sugar-sweetened bev-
erages (SSBs) contribute a large number of calories to 
the American diet, and most are composed almost ex-
clusively of just 2 ingredients, added sugars and water. 
This makes them a good vehicle for testing the effect of 
added sugars with minimal risk of confounding by other 
nutrients. As a result, nearly all clinical trials examining 
added sugars intake have been done with SSBs used as 
the exposure. Insight into the effect of sugar-sweetened 
food consumption might be gained through studies of 
foods high in total carbohydrates. Several short-term 
studies have shown that carbohydrates consumed as 
solids are more satiating then those consumed as liq-
uids,27–30 and subsequent calorie balance appears to be 
compensated for by the additional calories, resulting in 
less body weight gain.27,31
DiMeglio and Mattes27 compared the effects of SSBs 
versus isocaloric jelly beans in a crossover study among 
15 adults and demonstrated an increase in body weight

over 4 weeks during the beverage condition but not with 
the jelly beans. Houchins et al32 performed a random-
ized, crossover study to compare the short- and long-
term (8 weeks) effects of fruits and vegetables in solid 
versus beverage form on appetite and energy intake. 
They found that hunger reduction was greater and sub-
sequent food intake lower with solids compared with 
liquids in the short term, but there were no significant 
differences after 8 weeks. In a follow-up study, Houchins 
et al30 provided energy-matched liquid and solid forms 
of fruits and vegetables to lean or overweight/obese 
adults for 8 weeks each. Although incomplete dietary 
compensation and weight gain occurred in both lean and 
overweight/obese groups during the beverage condition, 
results with the food condition were mixed. In the lean 
group, calorie compensation was precise, and there 
was no weight gain; however, in the overweight/obese 
group, compensation was poor, and there was signifi-
cant weight gain.
Data are sparse on the impact of liquid versus solid 
sugars consumption in children. In a 6-year longitudinal 
study of 8- to 10-year-old children, Olsen et al31 demon-
strated a stronger association between liquid sucrose 
consumption and proxies of adiposity (BMI and waist 
circumference) compared with solid sucrose consump-
tion. Lee et al33 used data from a 10-year study with 
annual follow-up of adolescent girls to examine the as-
sociation between added sugars intake and measures 
of adiposity. Before adjustment for total energy, each 
additional teaspoon of added sugars consumed in ei-
ther beverages or foods over the previous year was 
positively associated with change in waist circumfer-
ence (0.18 mm/teaspoon; P<0.001) and change in 
BMI z score (0.002 units per teaspoon; P=0.003). 
After adjustment for total energy, the association re-
mained significant only for liquid added sugars and 
waist circumference (0.16 mm/teaspoon; P=0.02). 
This supports the association between added sugars 
consumed in either foods or beverages and weight gain 
is mediated by total energy intake but also suggests 
that liquid sugars may uniquely affect body fat distri-
bution. These data support the reduction of all added 
sugars, but particularly SSBs, as a way to improve 
long-term cardiovascular health.
CVD RISK OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH 
ADDED SUGARS INTAKE
Excess Weight Gain and Obesity
A preponderance of relevant literature supports a re-
lationship between dietary sugars, specifically those 
found in SSBs, and increased adiposity in children. 
As described below, these studies range from large 
longitudinal studies to school-based, randomized, con-
trolled trials with variable methods of dietary assess-
ment and analyses (eg, not all adjust for total energy 
intake). Although evidence from cross-sectional stud-
ies has been mixed, many of these studies support a 
positive association between added sugar intakes and 
adiposity.34–49
Higher intakes of SSBs have been associated with in-
creased obesity risk among children of all ages. A small 
amount of literature has examined the consumption of 
SSBs in infants and very young children. Early introduc-
tion of SSBs (before 12 months of age) has been evalu-
ated and found to be associated with obesity at 6 years 
of age.50 In toddlers consuming no SSBs compared with 
those consuming ≥2 SSBs per day, consuming no SSBs 
was protective against obesity.51
In the preschool-aged group (2–5 years), 3 longitu-
dinal studies52–54 and 1 retrospective study55 concluded 
that a high SSB intake was associated with a higher BMI 
z score,52 obesity at 5 to 7 years of age,53 and risk of 
being overweight.54 High intake of SSBs in preschoolers 
who were diagnosed as overweight or obese was asso-
ciated with remaining overweight or obese 1 year later.50 
In children 5 to 12 years of age, soda intake56 and SSB 
intake have been linked to increased BMI values and risk 
of being overweight or obese. A similar relationship was 
also found in adolescents; a higher intake of SSBs was 
associated with a higher BMI,57,58 excess weight gain,59 
and increased adiposity and weight status.60 Other stud-
ies have found no association with weight gain or adi-
posity in all age groups specifically when adjusted for 
total energy.34,37–39,41,45,61–66 A few studies have shown 
mixed results in which SSBs were associated with BMI 
increases in their sample in girls66 or boys39 but not both.
The association between SSBs and various adiposity 
outcomes has been more consistent. Higher SSB intake 
has been linked specifically to higher skin-fold thick-
ness,63 waist circumference,33,40 and excess body fat44 
in children and adolescents, as well as a decrease in fat 
accumulation, when SSBs were replaced with a nonca-
loric beverage.67 Timing of SSB exposure may influence 
effects. For example, in the previously mentioned longi-
tudinal study, SSB intake during infancy (<12 months of 
age) was associated with obesity at 6 years of age.50
Studies evaluating added and total sugars have been 
less consistent in their findings, possibly as a result in 
part of methodological issues. High levels of added sug-
ars intake at 2 years of age have been linked to BMI 
z scores at 7 years of age,68 but this finding has not 
been consistent. In a cross-sectional study, added sug-
ars did not significantly change BMI z scores in 8- to 
18-year-olds.44 Total dietary sugars intake was found not 
to be predictive of BMI in a cross-sectional study using 
NHANES data for 1- to 18-year-olds.49 However, stud-
ies that examined total sucrose consumption over time 
have found that a higher intake of sucrose is related to 
an increased BMI,48 BMI z score,31 and waist circumfer-
ence31 in children. A similar increase in total fat mass has

been reported in children and adolescents who have high 
intakes of total sugars,35 fructose,47 and juice.69
In summary, children and adolescents who have high 
intakes of dietary sugars (specifically from SSBs and 
added sugars) tend to have higher daily energy intakes 
compared with similar populations with lower intakes of 
dietary sugars. Higher SSB and added sugars intake has 
been strongly linked to excess weight gain and an in-
creased risk of obesity. Importantly, the associations of 
added sugars intake and adverse outcomes in the longi-
tudinal and cross-sectional studies may also be driven by 
other factors such as the home environment, a broader 
unhealthy diet, and activity behaviors. Additionally, in ran-
domized, controlled trials in which children and adoles-
cents switched from SSBs to noncaloric beverages,67,70 
reductions in weight were found, strengthening the likeli-
hood that it is added sugars intake (at least in beverage 
form) that drives the causality of the findings.
Elevated Blood Pressure and Uric Acid Levels
An epidemiological link between sweeteners and hyper-
tension has been suspected for many years, but distin-
guishing the effects from those of obesity has been chal-
lenging. Jalal and colleagues71 evaluated this question 
in the NHANES data from 2000 to 2003. A strength of 
this data set, a survey of a representative sample of US 
adults and children, is the inclusion of both direct blood 
pressure measurement and dietary intake of fructose as 
determined by dietary questionnaire. The major finding 
was that there was a strong relationship between fruc-
tose intake and elevated systolic blood pressure that 
was independent of obesity.71 Nguyen and colleagues72 
also found an independent relationship between sugary 
soft drinks and hypertension in adolescents. A converse 
observation that improvement in blood pressure during 
lifestyle modification was greatest with a greater reduc-
tion in dietary sweeteners was made in a large study 
of adults randomized to brief counseling on the DASH 
(Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) Diet.73
Direct clinical trials of fructose intake provide further 
support for a role of dietary sweeteners in the develop-
ment of hypertension. Perez-Pozo et al74 administered 200 
g fructose per day to healthy overweight males. Over the 
2-week study period, subjects had an average increase 
of 7 mm 
Hg in systolic blood pressure and 6 mm 
Hg in 
diastolic blood pressure. Brymora and colleagues75 per-
formed the converse experiment. Twenty-eight subjects 
were placed on a very low fructose diet in which they re-
duced their average intake from 59 to 12 g/d. After 6 
weeks, the subjects had an average decrease of 6 mm 
Hg 
in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
The physiological link between fructose and increased 
blood pressure is likely indirect, acting through uric acid 
as an intermediary.76–79 In adolescents, there is a close as-
sociation between elevated serum uric acid and the onset 
of essential hypertension. The Moscow Children’s Hyper-
tension Study found hyperuricemia (>8.0 mg/dL) in 9.5% 
of children with normal blood pressure, 49% of children 
with borderline hypertension, and 73% of children with 
moderate and severe hypertension.80 The Hungarian Chil-
dren’s Health Study followed up all 17 
634 children born 
in Budapest in 1964 for >13 years and also identified hy-
peruricemia as a risk factor for hypertension.81 In a small 
study, Gruskin82 compared adolescents (13–18 years 
of age) with essential hypertension with age-matched, 
healthy control subjects with normal blood pressures. The 
hypertensive children had both elevated serum uric acid 
(mean >6.5 mg/dL) and higher peripheral renin activity. 
In a racially diverse population referred for the evaluation 
of hypertension, Feig and Johnson83 observed that the 
mean serum uric acid level was 3.6 mg/dL in children with 
white-coat hypertension or normal blood pressure and 
significantly higher, 6.7 mg/dL, in children with primary 
hypertension. Results from 2 small, clinical trials suggest 
that uric acid contributes directly to the development of 
hypertension in adolescents.84,85 Serum uric acid reduc-
tion, whether by reduced production or increased clear-
ance, significantly improved elevated blood pressure.
In summary, both epidemiological and clinical trial evi-
dence suggests that excessive fructose intake results in 
increased blood pressure in children and young adults. 
There are data that this effect can be mitigated by urate-
lowering therapy consistent with the hypothesis that the 
hypertensive effect of dietary sugars is mediated by the 
induction of hyperuricemia. Current evidence suggests 
that added sugars are a source of excess fructose and 
that reduction of fructose from added sugars is likely to 
decrease uric acid, possibly improving blood pressure 
in children. However, further research on this topic is 
needed to test whether a reduction in added sugars re-
sults in improved blood pressure in children.
Dyslipidemia
The majority of studies that evaluated lipid markers in 
children and associations with sugars, sucrose, fructose, 
or SSBs were cross-sectional. Of these studies, 2 had 
mixed findings of increased glucose or homeostasis model 
assessment–estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and 
systolic blood pressure with increased SSBs but no asso-
ciation with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride 
levels.86,87 The remaining 9 cross-sectional studies demon-
strated positive associations between increasing amounts 
of added sugars and higher triglyceride and/or lower HDL 
levels.40,88–95 As expected, low-density lipoprotein and/or to-
tal cholesterol was less related and/or inversely associated 
with added sugars consumption in some studies.86,94,95
One of the older studies, published in 1980, was 
unique because it included children who consumed very 
low amounts of sugar, which is rare in today’s culture.94

CLINICAL STATEMENTS 
AND GUIDELINES
1669 school children (75% white and 24% black), includ-
ing total sucrose obtained from 24-hour recalls and mea-
sured blood lipids. Plasma triglycerides were positively 
correlated and total cholesterol was negatively correlat-
ed with dietary sucrose; this association remained after 
adjustment for age, race, and sex. When children were 
divided into low (1st–10th percentile) versus intermediate 
and high consumers of sucrose, after adjustment for de-
mographics, triglycerides rose with higher sucrose, HDL 
fell, and total plasma cholesterol fell as sucrose intake 
increased. Notably, the average consumption of the low 
group was very low, ranging from 8 to 24 g/d (3.5%–
6.8% of calories per day). The average consumption of 
sucrose of the intermediate group was between 42 and 
80 g/d (9%–10% of calories per day), and the consump-
tion of the high consumers was up to 17% of total calo-
ries per day. For triglycerides, there was a significant dif-
ference between the intermediate and high groups.
Four longitudinal studies included lipids as an out-
come. All longitudinal studies confirmed an association 
between increased SSBs, sucrose, or added sugars and 
increased triglycerides plus lower HDL.57,96–98 The Lee et 
al98 study included 10-year follow-up of >2000 racially di-
verse children who were 9 and 10 years of age at base-
line. In low consumers of added sugars (<10% of total 
calories) compared with higher consumers, there was a 
0.26-mg/dL annual increase (improvement) in HDL levels 
over the 10 years. This added up to a 2.2 mg/dL higher 
HDL in the low consumers of added sugars.
There has been 1 intervention study in obese children 
comparing usual diet with a fructose-free study-provided 
diet. After 9 days of fructose-free diet, significant reduc-
tions were seen in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, 
blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity.99
In summary, although there are limited intervention 
studies, the preponderance of evidence from the avail-
able cross-sectional and longitudinal studies weighs in 
favor of improved triglycerides and HDL in children with 
low consumption of added sugars. Although traditionally 
triglycerides and HDL have not been a primary focus 
for decreasing CVD risk, newer data demonstrate that a 
high ratio of triglycerides to HDL predicts smaller dense 
low-density lipoprotein, a strong cardiovascular risk fac-
tor.100 More studies are needed in this area, particularly 
focusing on the relationships of added sugars consump-
tion in children and small dense low-density lipoprotein, 
HDL function, non–HDL cholesterol, and direct measure-
ments of cardiovascular health such as carotid intima-
media thickness and brachial vasodilation.
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
NAFLD has increased in the US population at an alarming 
rate, particularly among children.101 NAFLD is a disease 
of lipid metabolism in which excess triglycerides accumu-
lates in hepatocytes in the setting of increased adiposity, 
hypertriglyceridemia, and increased free fatty acid flux to 
the liver caused by insulin resistance. The role of sugar 
intakes in NAFLD is only partially understood.
Nine articles were available that examined sugar in-
take and its correlation with hepatic steatosis in children. 
Of the 4 cross-sectional studies, 2 studies reported an 
association between increased sugars intake and higher 
liver fat25 or blood measurements of liver inflammation,102 
1 study had conflicting findings,103 and 1 study did not 
show a relationship between total sugars or fructose 
and hepatic steatosis.104 A large, longitudinal study that 
examined fructose consumption and NAFLD in 592 ado-
lescents using ultrasound to identify hepatic steatosis 
found that energy-adjusted fructose intake at 14 years of 
age was independently associated with increased odds 
of NAFLD at 17 years of age.105 Reduction in added 
sugars has often been included as a part of a healthier 
lifestyle approach to treat NAFLD, and the combination 
of higher fiber, increased vegetables, greater physical 
activity, and added sugars reduction has been shown to 
be effective in reducing hepatic fat.106 However, the level 
of contribution of added sugars reduction to the positive 
findings in this type of intervention is unknown.
Few intervention studies that specifically targeted 
added sugars and liver outcomes in children are avail-
able. A 4-week randomized, controlled, clinical trial com-
pared type of sugar (fructose versus glucose) in a euca-
loric beverage study in children with NAFLD and found 
that hepatic fat did not change when glucose was sub-
stituted for fructose, although insulin resistance and sys-
temic inflammation improved.107 A small 6-month pilot 
study comparing education on a low-fat diet with educa-
tion on a low-fructose diet found significant improvement 
in oxidized low-density lipoprotein and a strong trend of 
improvement in alanine amino transferase after a low-
fructose diet educational intervention.103
In summary, although the cross-sectional data that 
exist to date conflict, the 1 large longitudinal study avail-
able suggests a relationship between fructose consump-
tion in children and hepatic fat. More research is needed, 
in particular because NAFLD does not occur in isolation 
and is almost always accompanied by 1 or all of the fol-
lowing: visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, 
high non–HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance.108 
Measuring outcomes of this clinical fatty liver syndrome 
after added sugars reduction may be a better marker of 
improvement compared with studying hepatic fat or in-
flammation levels alone. Important research gaps in this 
area are the lack of longitudinal and randomized studies 
testing sugar reduction or substitution as a treatment for 
NAFLD in children, the lack of information on dose effect 
of added sugars on NAFLD or the associated CVD risk 
factors, and the role of early sugars exposure on NAFLD. 
These specific areas of knowledge are critical for guid-
ing future practice and public health recommendations. 
For now, it appears that a diet low in added sugars for

overweight children with NAFLD is beneficial on the basis 
of the evidence to date and can be recommended espe-
cially given the low risk of harm and the lack of nutrient 
value of added sugars.
Insulin Resistance and Diabetes Mellitus
The effects of added sugars on insulin sensitivity have 
been measured as primary or secondary outcomes in a 
number of pediatric studies. A 2-year longitudinal study 
by Wang et al87 studied the associations between SSBs 
and their effect on glucose-insulin homeostasis among 
youth. The population included children between 8 and 
10 years of age with at least 1 obese biological par-
ent. Participants were classified as normal weight, over-
weight, or obese. Adipose measures, fasting glucose, 
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and the Matsuda insulin sensitiv-
ity index were measured. The data showed that a higher 
consumption (10 g/d) of added sugars from liquid sourc-
es was associated with 0.04-mmol/L higher fasting glu-
cose, 2.3-mmol/L higher fasting insulin, a 0.1-unit higher 
HOMA-IR, and a 0.4-unit lower Matsuda insulin sensitivity 
index in all participants. These observed increases were 
statistically significant in children who were classified as 
overweight/obese but not among the normal-weight chil-
dren. A cross-sectional study by Welsh et al95 of 2157 
US adolescents in NHANES between 1999 and 2004 
also showed a positive correlation between added sug-
ars and HOMA-IR among overweight adolescents but not 
among those with normal weight.
Heden et al109 showed that moderate amounts of fruc-
tose- or glucose-sweetened beverages for 2 weeks did 
not differentially alter metabolic health in male and female 
adolescents when the 2 beverages were compared. The 
study was a counterbalanced, single-blind study with 40 
male and female adolescents but was limited by its short 
duration. Contrary to this study, Jin et al107 demonstrated 
in a slightly longer 4-week double-blind, randomized, con-
trolled intervention study among Hispanic adolescents 
who were overweight with NAFLD that fructose beverage 
consumption increased insulin, HOMA-IR, and adipose in-
sulin resistance, whereas glucose beverage consumption 
was associated with lower insulin and HOMA-IR.
In summary, studies in this area are inconclusive. 
To date, added sugars appear to have a relationship 
with insulin resistance in children who are overweight, 
but this finding was not demonstrated in normal-weight 
children.
EVIDENCE OF DOSE RESPONSE TO ADDED 
SUGARS INTAKE
In our literature review, we found no studies direct-
ly testing what dose of added sugars in the diet of 
 
children would have no harmful effect on CVD risk. The 
following is a summary of the results of studies from 
each section above that indicate a level above which an 
increase in ≥1 cardiovascular risk factors was observed.
Cross-Sectional Studies
• Children consuming 3.5% to 6.8% of calories 
as sucrose (the lowest consumption group) had 
lower triglycerides and higher HDL than higher 
consumers.94
• Children consuming no SSBs compared with those 
consuming an average of 11.8 oz/d had lower 
C-reactive protein, smaller waist circumference, 
and higher HDL cholesterol.40
• Each additional SSB equivalent (≈1 cup or 8 oz) 
consumed by children daily was associated with 
a 5% increase in HOMA-IR, a 0.16-mm increase 
in systolic blood pressure, a 0.47-cm increase in 
waist circumference, a 0.90-percentile increase in 
BMI for age, and a 0.48-mg/dL decrease in HDL 
concentrations. The low consumers in this analysis 
consumed a mean of 0.1 oz of SSBs per day.91
• Adolescents who consumed >10% of their total 
energy as added sugars had lower HDL levels, 
higher triglycerides, and higher low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol levels than those who consumed 
less. Overweight or obese adolescents had higher 
insulin resistance (as assessed with HOMA-IR).95
Prospective Cohort
• Adolescents consuming <10% of their total calo-
ries as added sugars had higher HDL cholesterol 
levels than those consuming more.98
• Children who consumed ≈10% of calories from 
sucrose had a poorer diet quality and significantly 
decreased height compared with lower consumers.48
• Infants who drank ≥3 servings of SSBs per week 
had twice the odds of obesity at 6 years of age.50
• Annual changes in BMI z score and waist circum-
ference among girls increased significantly with 
each additional teaspoon of added sugar.98
Experimental Studies
• In a randomized, controlled trial in school children, 
1 SSB daily contributed an additional 104 cal 
from added sugars (≈5% of a 2000-cal diet) and 
increased body weight compared with a noncaloric 
beverage daily.67
Thus, there is consistent evidence that cardiovascular 
risk increases as added sugars consumption increases. 
Very low consumption (0.1 oz of SSBs per day) is asso-
ciated with lower CVD risk indicators. The “sweet spot” 
at which level of consumption added sugars could be

DIET QUALITY AND ADDED SUGARS INTAKE
Decreased Diet Quality
Few studies have reported variations in nutrient adequa-
cy (ie, decreased diet quality) based on intakes of added 
sugars; however, a study that examined this variation 
suggested displacement of micronutrients with increas-
ing amounts of sugars intake.110 Results from 10 years 
of follow-up in the National Growth and Health Study 
reported low intakes of vitamins A, D, and E, calcium, 
and potassium among adolescent girls across all 3 age 
ranges (9–13, 14–18, and 19–20 years).111 These ado-
lescents consumed >40% of total energy (>750 kcal/d) 
from solid fats and added sugars compared with the rec-
ommended limits ranging from 120 kcal/d for sedentary 
girls to 160 kcal/d for moderately active girls.
Diet quality may also be affected by total sugars intake 
and sources of sugars intakes. Frary and colleagues112 
reported added sugars data in children and adolescents 
from the 1994 to 1996 and 1998 Continuing Survey of 
Food Intakes by Individuals database (US Department of 
Agriculture). Whereas intake of presweetened dairy foods 
(ie, flavored milk or yogurts), beverages, and fortified ce-
reals favorably affected levels of micronutrients, SSBs, 
sugars and sweets, and sweetened grains adversely af-
fected diet quality. An Australian cross-sectional study of 
children 2 to 16 years of age based on two 24-hour re-
calls examined high glycemic carbohydrates, not sugars, 
and found that children who had a higher glycemic index 
of carbohydrates were more likely to fail to meet certain 
recommended nutrients, including calcium, and iodine.113 
A longitudinal study of Finnish children that collected di-
etary information annually from infancy to 9 years of age 
found that the highest consumers of sucrose tended to 
receive less vitamin E, niacin, calcium, iron, zinc, and di-
etary fiber compared with average and low consumers of 
sucrose.49 The lowest consumers of sucrose also con-
sumed more grains, vegetables, and dairy products,49 
thus supporting the idea that children who consume 
added sugars in high levels are consuming fewer of the 
micronutrients that are important for health.
A cross-sectional analysis of data from 2005 to 2008 
NHANES reported that dietary sodium intake among US 
children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age was posi-
tively associated with SSB consumption.114 The average 
dietary sodium intake was 3056 mg/d, well in excess of 
the recommended 2300 mg/d. The authors predicted 
that with reductions in sodium intake, SSB intake and 
thus calories from sugars intake would decrease. Among 
those who consumed SSBs, each additional 390 mg of 
sodium per day was associated with an increase of 32 
g of SSBs per day.
Another potential consequence of higher sugars in-
take, especially in liquid form (eg, SSBs), is increased 
total energy intake that is not compensated for by re-
duced energy intake during meals.115 Sugary beverages 
were found to conflict in flavor with vegetables, thereby 
suggesting that “combo meals” that include SSBs are 
typically not served with vegetables, whereas water or 
milk is better accepted. Reduction of SSBs could de-
crease energy intake in children, as demonstrated in a 
study by Briefel et al.116 Briefel and colleagues used diet 
modeling and reported that switching from SSBs and fla-
vored milks to unflavored low-fat milk at meals and water 
between meals saved on average 205 kcal/d, an ≈10% 
reduction in total energy intake.
Increased Diet Quality
Empty calories in children’s diets should be limited to the 
amount that fits their energy and nutrient needs. The Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics Council on School Health and 
Committee on Nutrition advises using the minimal amount 
of added sugars necessary to promote the palatability, en-
joyment, and consumption of nutrient-rich food items.117 
Thus, it is important to be judicious when including added 
sugars in children’s diets. SSBs, sweets, and sweetened 
grains are more likely to have a negative impact on diet 
quality, whereas sweetened dairy products and presweet-
ened cereals may have a positive impact.112 Examples of 
foods that may have a positive impact include sweetened 
dairy products such as low-fat or fat-free flavored milk, 
sweetened yogurt, and high-fiber breakfast cereals. Fat-
free flavored milk intake is associated with higher intakes 
of shortfall nutrients such as calcium and potassium and is 
not associated with adverse effects on BMI measures.118 
Furthermore, lower-calorie low-fat or fat-free milk with re-
duced added sugars appears to be acceptable to school-
aged children.119,120 Consuming ready-to-eat cereal at 
breakfast was associated with improved weight and nutri-
ent adequacy in black children.121 However, compared with 
low-sugar cereals, high-sugar cereals increase children’s 
total sugar consumption and reduce the overall nutritional 
quality of their breakfast.122 From these studies, it is ap-
parent that when children consume added sugars, it is 
better if the sugars are in foods and beverages that en-
hance, not diminish, the nutrient quality of the diet.
EARLY INTRODUCTION OF ADDED SUGARS
Children have a strong preference for a sweet taste, and 
early introduction of added sugars in the diet of infants and 
toddlers may promote sweet taste preference123 or may 
reflect other factors in the feeding environment. (Early intro-
duction of SSBs [before 12 months of age] is associated 
with an increased likelihood of consuming SSBs ≥1 time/
day at age 6 years.53) Recent research demonstrating the 
use of sucrose and glucose, which are sweeter than lac-

tose (the sugar found in breast milk), in infant formulas124 
highlights the need for research in this area. We found no 
studies evaluating added sugars and infant formulas. Given 
the importance of this early period on growth and future 
obesity and metabolic risk, this is a critical research need.
ALTERNATIVES TO ADDED SUGARS
As part of this scientific statement, a review of the lit-
erature on nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs; noncaloric 
artificial sweeteners) in children was performed because 
NNSs are often considered a tool to replace added 
sugars to help lower energy intake. The key words non-
nutritive sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, noncaloric 
sweeteners, and children were searched, with few rel-
evant articles identified.125 This highlights a major gap 
in information that has also been noted in the adult lit-
erature.126,127 NNS-flavored beverages have been used 
as comparison groups in several pediatric trials of 
SSBs.67,70 However, the studies were not designed to 
examine the effects of NNSs and did not include a water 
comparison group.
Currently, consumption of NNSs is low in children, al-
though it has increased over time. The AHA’s position 
on NNSs for adults is that, when used judiciously, NNSs 
substituted for added sugars in foods and beverages 
could help people reduce their calorie intake to reach and 
maintain a healthy body weight, as long as the substitu-
tion does not lead to consuming additional calories as 
compensation.127 The American Academy of Pediatrics 
concluded that data on NNSs are scarce in terms of the 
long-term benefits for weight management in children 
and adolescents or the consequences of long-term con-
sumption.117 Because of the lack of research in children, 
a recommendation either for or against the routine use of 
NNSs in the diets of children cannot be made at this time.
RESEARCH GAPS
As discussed above, important gaps exist in the knowl-
edge of sugars in children. Longitudinal studies, inter-
vention studies, and randomized, controlled trials are 
urgently needed to provide high-quality data for policy 
decisions. Specific remaining questions that are research 
priorities include the following:
• Is there a threshold of added sugars below which there 
are no negative effects on cardiovascular health?
• Is there a direct linear relationship between increas-
ing cardiovascular risk outcomes and added sugars 
intake? For example, is 1% better than 5%, which is 
better than 10%? Does this change by age?
• Are the risks associated with added sugars con-
sumption lower if the sugars are consumed in 
foods instead of in beverages?
• Does routine use of NNSs have adverse metabolic 
effects in children?
• Can the food industry move to gradually lower the 
amount of sugars added to foods, and if so, what 
is the expected outcome?
• Does sugar from 100% juice have biological and 
cardiovascular health effects in children similar to 
those of added sugars from SSBs?
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
On the basis of the existing literature and in combina-
tion with expert opinion, the following recommendations 
are made:
1.  
In randomized, controlled trials in which children 
and adolescents switch from SSBs to noncaloric 
beverages, reductions in weight were found, 
strengthening the likelihood that it is added sugars 
intake (at least in beverage form) that drives the 
causality of the findings. Therefore, it is recom-
mended that children and adolescents limit their 
intake of SSBs to 1 or fewer 8-oz beverages per 
week (Class I; Level of Evidence A).
2.  
In the absence of dose-assessment studies, we 
can only extrapolate from observational studies. 
On the basis of the studies showing an associa-
tion between decreased CVD risk factors and a low 
consumption of added sugars and the high poten-
tial benefit-to-risk ratio, it is reasonable to recom-
mend that children and adolescents consume ≤25 
g (100 cal or ≈6 teaspoons) of added sugars per 
day (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).
3.  
Because there is minimal room for nutrient-free 
calories in the habitual diets of very young children, 
added sugars should be avoided in the diet of chil-
dren <2 years of age (Class III; Level of Evidence C).
CONCLUSIONS
Our comprehensive review of the available evidence 
found that associations with increased CVD risk factors 
are present at levels far below US children’s current 
added sugars consumption levels. Current evidence sup-
ports the associations of added sugars with increased 
energy intake, increased adiposity, increased central adi-
posity, and increased dyslipidemia, all of which are dem-
onstrated CVD risk factors. Importantly, the introduction 
of added sugars during infancy appears to be particularly 
harmful and should be avoided. Although added sugars 
can mostly likely be safely consumed in low amounts as 
part of a healthy diet, little research has been done to es-
tablish a threshold between adverse effects and health, 
making this an important future research topic.
