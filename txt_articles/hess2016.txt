IMPORTANCE In the current therapeutic era, the risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) after
non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) has not been characterized
completely.
OBJECTIVE To determine the cumulative incidence of SCD during long-term follow-up after
NSTE ACS, to develop a risk model and risk score for SCD after NSTE ACS, and to assess the
association between recurrent events after the initial ACS presentation and the risk for SCD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This pooled cohort analysis merged individual data from
48 286 participants in 4 trials: the Apixaban for Prevention of Acute Ischemic Events 2
(APPRAISE-2), Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO), Thrombin
Receptor Antagonist for Clinical Event Reduction in Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRACER), and
Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute
Coronary Syndromes (TRILOGY ACS) trials. The cumulative incidence of SCD and
cardiovascular death was examined according to time after NSTE ACS. Using competing risk
and Cox proportional hazards models, clinical factors at baseline and after the index event
that were associated with SCD after NSTE ACS were identified. Baseline factors were used to
develop a risk model. Data were analyzed from January 2, 2014, to December 11, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sudden cardiac death.
RESULTS Of the initial 48 286 patients, 37 555 patients were enrolled after NSTE ACS (67.4%
men; 32.6% women; median [interquartile range] age, 65 [57-72] years). Among these, 2109
deaths occurred after a median follow-up of 12.1 months. Of 1640 cardiovascular deaths, 513
(31.3%) were SCD. At 6, 18, and 30 months, the cumulative incidence estimates of SCD were
0.79%, 1.65%, and 2.37%, respectively. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, older age,
diabetes mellitus, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher heart rate, prior
myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, Asian race, male sex, and high Killip class
were significantly associated with SCD. A model developed to calculate the risk for SCD in
trials with systematic collection of left ventricular ejection fraction had a C index of 0.77. An
integer-based score was developed from this model and yielded a calculated SCD probability
ranging from 0.1% to 56.7% (C statistic, 0.75). In a multivariable model that included
time-dependent clinical events occurring after the index hospitalization for ACS, SCD was
associated with recurrent myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 2.95; 95% CI, 2.29-3.80;
P < .001) and any hospitalization (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.98-3.03; P < .001), whereas coronary
revascularization had a negative relationship with SCD (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the current therapeutic era, SCD accounts for about
one-third of cardiovascular deaths after NSTE ACS. Risk stratification can be performed with
good accuracy using commonly collected clinical variables. Clinical events occurring after the
index hospitalization are underappreciated but important risk factors.

S
udden cardiac death (SCD) is a catastrophic sequela of
acute myocardial infarction (MI).1 Improvements in pri-
maryandsecondarycardiacpreventiontherapyhaveled
to reductions in coronary heart disease–related deaths dur-
ing the past 50 years, but corresponding declines in SCD have
not been observed.2,3 The temporal change in the incidence
of SCD after MI has been reported from large clinical trials, ter-
tiary care centers, and a community setting. However, prior
studies took place in the thrombolytic era4,5 or were limited
to one6,7 or two8 locations or trials.9 An understanding of SCD
in the setting of contemporary practice, with more accurate
diagnosisofMIviameasurementofcardiactroponinlevelsand
more widespread use of revascularization and dual antiplate-
let therapy, is needed.
Improving management strategies to prevent SCD after an
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) requires an understanding of
a patient’
s individual absolute risk. However, algorithms to as-
sess individual patients’risks for SCD in the post-ACS setting
have not been developed. In addition, the baseline risk for SCD
based on characteristics at presentation may change over time,
as in the case of recurrent clinical events. Finally, the effect of
events occurring after the index ACS, such as recurrent MI, on
the long-term risk for SCD is unclear.
We set out to address the aforementioned gaps in knowl-
edgeusingpooledpatient-leveldatafrom4contemporary,con-
trolled, multinational randomized clinical trials among pa-
tients presenting with an ACS. Specifically, the current analysis
sought to determine the cumulative incidence of SCD during
long-term follow-up after non–ST-segment elevation (NSTE)
ACS, to develop a risk-calculation model and risk score for SCD
after NSTE ACS, and to assess the association between ische-
mic events occurring after the initial ACS presentation and the
risk for SCD.
Methods
Data Sources and Study Population
Individual patient data from the following contemporary clini-
cal trials were pooled: Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient
Outcomes (PLATO; 18 624 participants),10,11 Apixaban for Pre-
vention of Acute Ischemic Events 2 (APPRAISE-2; 7392
participants),12,13 Thrombin Receptor Antagonist for Clinical
EventReductioninAcuteCoronarySyndrome(TRACER;12 944
participants),14,15 and Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify
the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary
Syndromes (TRILOGY ACS; 9326 participants).16,17 The
designs12,18-20 and primary results10,12,14,16 of these trials have
been published previously. They recruited patients with mod-
erate-tohigh-riskACS(high-riskunstableanginaandacuteMI)
andweremulticenter,randomized,andplacebocontrolled.Trial
dateswereOctober11,2006,toJuly18,2008,forPLATO;March
17, 2009, to November 18, 2010, for APPRAISE-2; December 18,
2007, to November 30, 2010, for TRACER; and June 27, 2008,
to September 12, 2011, for TRILOGY ACS. Data for this report
were previously collected during the conduct of the primary
trials, which were all approved by the appropriate national and
institutionalregulatoryauthoritiesandethicscommittees,and
all of the trials’participants provided written informed con-
sent. The institutional review board of Duke University ap-
proved the use of the deidentified data set for this analysis.
PLATOandAPPRAISE-2includedpatientswithST-segment
elevationMIorNSTEACS,whereasTRACERandTRILOGYACS
included patients with NSTE ACS only. For the present analy-
sis, the study cohort consisted of patients with an NSTE ACS
index event. Race or ethnicity was self-identified among sev-
eral options defined according to the trial and included in the
analysis in view of its potential role in SCD. Because the aim
of this analysis was to evaluate SCD, patients receiving an im-
plantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) after randomization
were excluded because SCD would have been prevented in
these patients, and ICD-prevented deaths were not collected
systematically. A total of 333 patients who had an ICD im-
planted at study entry or during follow-up were excluded
(PLATO, 111 participants; APPRAISE-2, 26 participants;
TRACER, 136 participants; and TRILOGY ACS, 60 partici-
pants). A method to measure left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) was not mandated, although echocardiography was
preferred when available.
Outcomes
The main outcome of interest for this analysis was SCD. In each
of the 4 trials included, components of the primary end point
wereadjudicatedbytheirrespectiveindependentclinicalevent
committees using standardized definitions. The clinical event
committees also adjudicated cause and type of death, includ-
ing a determination of whether the death was sudden and car-
diac related. We defined SCD as a sudden, unexpected death
that was cardiac in origin. Sudden cardiac death was wit-
nessed and occurred without new or worsening symptoms or
occurred within 60 minutes from the onset of new symp-
toms in the absence of a clear noncardiovascular cause. Alter-
natively, SCD was unwitnessed and occurred within 24 hours
of the patient being observed alive in the absence of preexist-
ing, progressive circulatory failure. Sudden death included
deaths that occurred after successful initial resuscitation with-
out subsequent recovery. Such deaths were a direct conse-
quence of the cardiac arrest. Classification of witnessed and
unwitnessed SCD performed by the clinical event committee
was available in 3 of the 4 trials (not TRILOGY ACS); in the
Key Points
Question What is the incidence of and risk for sudden cardiac
death (SCD) after non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary
syndrome (ACS)?
Findings In pooled data from 4 ACS trials, SCD occurred at a rate
of approximately 1% per year yet accounted for 31.3% of
cardiovascular deaths. Risk for SCD was assessed using left
ventricular ejection fraction, age, diabetes mellitus, estimated
glomerular filtration rate, heart rate, myocardial infarction,
peripheral artery disease, race, sex, and Killip class and was
modified by events after the index presentation.

3 trials for which this information was included in the data-
base, 180 of 289 SCDs (62.3%) were witnessed. Cardiac arrest
not followed by death (n = 66) was not counted as SCD.
Statistical Analysis
The analyses included herein were conducted from January
2, 2014, to December 11, 2015. Baseline characteristics of pa-
tients were compared among trials. Categorical and continu-
ous variables were displayed as frequencies and as medians
with 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Sudden cardiac
death, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death rates were
summarized with cumulative incidence curves. Time 0 was
defined as the day of randomization.
To identify factors associated with the risk for SCD, a strati-
fiedcompetingriskmodel21wasfitted.AFineandGraymodel22
accounts for competing risks of the outcome of interest and
can be interpreted in a manner similar to Cox proportional haz-
ardsmodels.Inthisinstance,themodelaccountedforthecom-
peting risk for non-SCD. Candidate covariates were age, sex,
race, region of origin, diabetes mellitus, prior MI, history of pe-
ripheral artery disease, body mass index, history of atrial fi-
brillation, dyslipidemia, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure,heartrate,smokingstatus,chronicobstructivepulmonary
disease, ST-segment changes, Killip class, estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate derived from the modified Cockcroft-Gault
equationthatadjustsforbodysurfacearea,23andpositivefind-
ings for cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase MB [myocardial
band] fraction and troponin).
The analysis was stratified by trial arm. The final model
was selected from the set of candidate variables using step-
wise selection. Linearity of continuous variables and the pro-
portional hazards assumption were examined; splines were
usedasappropriate,andnosubstantialdeviationfromthepro-
portional hazards assumption was noted for all variables.
The final model was selected using a stepwise selection
strategy. A first model was developed using the 4-trial cohort
(37 615 patients with NSTE ACS). Because LVEF and heart fail-
ure status are known to be important risk factors for SCD, we
developed a new and complete model from the trials in which
LVEFwassystematicallycollected(TRACERandTRILOGYACS;
22 270 patients). The final model inclusive of LVEF was con-
verted into a user-friendly integer score to calculate the prob-
ability of SCD at 2 years. Continuous variables were grouped
into convenient categories (eg, 10 years for age). Because SCD
is a relatively infrequent event, we decided to use the entire
database for development, without reserving a cohort for vali-
dation, to maximize the number of events in the develop-
ment of the model. Prognostic ability of the final model and
the derived score were quantified with the C statistic and the
optimism-corrected C statistic.24 Calibration of the score was
assessed by comparing the expected and observed cumula-
tive incidence at 2 years.
To assess the association between ischemic events occur-
ring after the index ACS presentation and the risk for SCD, the
following time-dependent covariates were added individu-
ally to the final adjusted model derived using the 4 trials: MI,
stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention and/or coronary
artery bypass grafting, and rehospitalization for any reason.
We specifically assessed the first of any particular events
occurring after hospitalization. For each of those variables, a
separate model adjusted for baseline variables was devel-
oped. To understand whether the baseline and time-
dependent covariates were related to SCD or a competing
risk, proportional hazards modeling was also performed. All
P values correspond to 2-sided hypothesis tests with α = .05.
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS software
(version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Baseline Patient Characteristics
Of the initial 48 286 patients, the final study sample con-
sisted of 37 555 patients who were enrolled after NSTE ACS
(4449 from APPRAISE-2; 11 032 from PLATO; 12 808 from
TRACER; and 9266 from TRILOGY ACS). In the pooled co-
hort, 83.3% had positive findings for cardiac biomarkers (tro-
ponin or creatine kinase MB fraction) at presentation. eTable
1 in the Supplement shows the patients’baseline characteris-
tics. In the overall study cohort, the median age was 65 (in-
terquartilerange,57-72)years;67.4%weremenand32.6%were
women. Patients were predominantly white (85.5%) and Eu-
ropean (53.8%). On presentation, blood pressure and heart rate
were usually within reference ranges, and the Killip class was
typicallyItoII(98.6%).Mostpatientshaddyslipidemia(58.1%),
whereas fewer had diabetes mellitus (34.1%), a history of MI
(33.0%), or peripheral artery disease (8.6%). In the 2 trials in
which LVEF was available, 40.6% of patients had some de-
gree of systolic dysfunction.
Incidence of SCD
After a median follow-up of 12.1 (interquartile range, 9.0-
18.4) months, a total of 2109 deaths occurred. Of 1640 cardio-
vascular deaths, 513 (31.3%) were SCDs. The rate of SCD was
1.18 per 100 patient-years of follow-up. The Figure shows the
cumulative incidence of sudden, cardiovascular, and all-
cause deaths as a function of time after NSTE ACS. At 6, 18, and
30 months, the cumulative incidences of SCD were 0.79%,
1.65%, and 2.37%, respectively. The SCD outcome accrues con-
tinuouslyovertime.Itseparatesfromotherformsofdeathearly

Baseline Factors Associated With SCD
VariablessignificantlyassociatedwithSCDonunivariateanaly-

eral artery disease, and it had a C statistic of 0.73 (optimism-
corrected C statistic, 0.72; eTable 3 in the Supplement). The fi-

LVEF, is reported in Table 1. The complete model, including

significance except for systolic blood pressure, with the addi-
tional strong association seen with LVEF (P < .001).
Integer-Based SCD Risk Calculator
The final multivariable model including baseline characteris-
tics was converted into a user-friendly, integer-based risk score
that could be used to estimate the risk for SCD in individual
patients with NSTE ACS with relative simplicity. This simpli-
fied, integer-based model did not have a significant loss in ac-
curacy compared with the full model (C statistic, 0.75). Table 2
shows points assigned to each variable in the model. Table 3
shows the calculated probability of SCD at 2 years, account-
ing for all risk factors. Based on a calculated integer score from
0 to 50, the estimated risk for SCD at 2 years ranged from 0.1%
to 56.7%. A total of 51.0% of patients had risks of less than 1%
(score, 0-15); 40.0% of patients had risks ranging from 1.7% to
3.3% (score, 20-25); and 9.0% of patients had a risk for SCD at
2 years of 6.1% or higher (score, ≥30).
Recurrent Clinical Events and Risk for Subsequent SCD
We assessed the relationship between time-dependent, recur-
rentclinicaleventsaftertheinitialhospitalizationforNSTEACS
and the risk for SCD. Patients who had recurrent MI (hazard
ratio [HR], 2.95; 95% CI, 2.29-3.80; χ2 = 70.1; P < .001) and
thosewhohadarehospitalizationforanyreason(HR,2.45;95%
CI, 1.98-3.03; χ2 = 68.7; P < .001) had an increase in the risk for
SCD.Revascularizationwithpercutaneousinterventionorcoro-
nary bypass grafting demonstrated a statistically significant
but weaker association with reduced SCD risk (HR, 0.75; 95%
CI, 0.58-0.98; χ2 = 4.6; P = .03); the association of percutane-
ous coronary intervention alone (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-
1.00; χ2 = 3.8; P = .05) or coronary artery bypass grafting alone
(HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 068-1.55; χ2 < 0.1; P = .91) was not signifi-
cant. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, re-
sults were consistent.
Discussion
We report 3 main findings of this analysis. First, in the cur-
rent NSTE ACS therapeutic era, SCD occurs relatively infre-
quently at a rate of approximately 1% per year, yet it accounts
for one-third of cardiovascular deaths observed during follow-
up. Sudden cardiac death accrues continuously over time; its
incidence does not plateau even after the first year from the
acute event. Second, an SCD risk model consisting of com-
monly collected clinical variables, from which we derived a
more user-friendly risk score, can be used for risk stratifica-
tion of SCD and identification of patients who are at higher risk
for SCD. Third, recurrent events subsequent to the initial ACS
presentation, in particular recurrent MI and rehospitaliza-
tion, are associated with the risk for subsequent SCD.
Several prior studies have identified factors associated
with SCD after MI. In an observational analysis of Olmsted
County in Minnesota, age, male sex, hypertension, comor-
bidity burden, and heart failure class were associated with
an elevated risk.7 In a secondary analysis of the Valsartan in
Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT)25—a multina-
tional clinical trial—increasing weight, lower creatinine
clearance, and country of enrollment were also identified as
risk factors. The results of the present study of baseline risk
factors are consistent with those of prior analyses.7,25,26
We also observed an increased risk for SCD after NSTE ACS
among Asian patients relative to those of other races.
Because Asians were underrepresented in prior studies, this
finding merits further investigation.
With certain clinical risk factors associated with SCD, the
development of a comprehensive risk-stratification tool that
accounts for SCD-associated clinical characteristics and pro-
duces a user-friendly risk score may be helpful in NSTE ACS
clinical care and research. First, this tool may be used to sup-
port treatment and counseling of individual patients. Sec-
ond, it may help select patients in whom devices aimed at pre-
venting SCD, such as ICDs or wearable defibrillators, could be
further studied.

at high risk for SCD gain a survival benefit from an ICD, includ-
ing those with a recent MI27,28 or recent revascularization.29
Because SCD represents a relatively common type of death af-
ter NSTE ACS, identifying subsets of patients with NSTE ACS at
high risk for SCD may lead to the development of targeted pri-
mary prevention strategies. A user-friendly risk score may be
usedforclinicalstudiesassessingthoseinterventions.Prospec-

sudden death is arrhythmic and may in fact stem from other
causes such as recurrent MI or cardiac rupture.
A key finding of this analysis is that the risk for SCD is not
static over time from NSTE ACS but is significantly influ-
enced by events that occur after the initial hospitalization.
Coronary artery disease is dynamic in nature, and markers of
risk shift with varying expression of the disease. In particu-
lar, a recurrent MI was associated with a 3.0-fold increase in
the risk for SCD, whereas rehospitalization for any reason was
associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the risk for SCD. Coro-
nary revascularization procedures were associated with a
decreased risk for SCD. Similar findings were observed in the
VALIANT trial,25 which only included patients with MI
presenting with heart failure or a reduced (<40%) LVEF. Our
results, in addition to confirming the importance of recurrent
ischemic events, expand their significance to a general popu-
lation with NSTE ACS.
In the Olmsted County database,7 the association with re-
current ischemic events was weaker. A comparative strength
of the present analysis is the use of trial data with systemati-
cally identified end points. The present analysis deepens un-
derstanding of the studied variables by examining their asso-
ciationwiththeriskforSCDandaccountingforcompetingrisks
for non-SCD; to our knowledge, our study is the first to do so.
Prevention of events downstream from the index hospitaliza-
tion may be as important as considering ICDs for these pa-
tients. More data regarding the additive prognostic signifi-
cance of clinical events after hospitalization and their
implications for treatment are needed.
Limitations of this analysis should be acknowledged. First,
this analysis uses databases from clinical trials, and only the
variables available from each trial database were used. In ad-
dition, because patients in clinical trials are known to be more
selected than real-world patients with ACS, issues with gen-
eralizability of clinical trial findings apply. Our analysis was ob-
servational in nature, and thus unmeasured or residual con-
founding may exist. The LVEF was not available in 2 of the 4

trials studied; therefore, the final model was developed using
only the 2 trials with consistent collection of LVEF. Nonethe-
less, the models from the 4 trials and the models including
LVEF and Killip class were consistent, with the additional pre-
cision gained by adding the LVEF.
Trials included in the analysis assessed experimental
therapies, and not all of them are currently considered stan-
dard of care. Additional differences were found in the con-
trol arms of the trials, although they all aimed to assess the
standard of care and generally used dual antiplatelet therapy
as background treatment. To address this issue, we consid-
ered arms within each trial as strata in the analysis. The
adjudication of SCD was based on clinical information
depicting the scenario of death and relied on information
provided by investigative sites.
Despite clear definitions, the cardiac or electrical origin of
SCD cannot be confirmed in all instances and in some cases is
assumed, particularly when death is unwitnessed. The mod-
els developed were based on simple baseline clinical informa-
tion, standard laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Although
we were able to discriminate high-risk groups of patients, a sig-
nificant number of events were still observed in the numeri-
cally larger, low-risk portion of the population. More detailed
investigation, such as an electrophysiology study, ambula-
tory electrocardiographic monitoring, or electrocardio-
graphic analysis, may be required on certain patients to fur-
ther characterize the risk for SCD.
Although the C index in our model has a good prognostic
value, it also shows that other information is needed for fur-
ther improvement of risk stratification. Because SCD is a rela-
tively infrequent event, we used the entire population to de-
velop the model so that no validation cohort was spared.
However, we performed internal validation with bootstrap-
ping that confirmed C statistics calculated in the model. Fur-
ther external validation would be helpful.
In view of the difficulty finding a comparable data set, a
prospectivelydesignedfuturestudymayberequired.Weshow
that recurrent clinical events are associated with the risk for
SCD, but those could not be included in the clinical risk model.
The outcome of this analysis was sudden death, and we did
not account for cardiac arrests not leading to death or ICD-
prevented deaths because this information was not col-
lected. Although the risk score presented was developed from
a large data set, further validation may be helpful.
Conclusions
Sudden cardiac death accounts for one-third of cardiovascu-
lar deaths observed after discharge from a hospitalization for
NSTE ACS. The risk for SCD significantly varies among pa-
tients with NSTE ACS, and a risk-stratification tool can be used
to identify patients with NSTE ACS at high risk. In addition,
patients with recurrent MI or rehospitalization after the ini-
tial NSTE ACS have a significantly increased risk for SCD. Fu-
ture research is needed to assess the implementation of drug-
or device-based strategies that may reduce the risk for SCD in
high-risk patients after NSTE ACS.
