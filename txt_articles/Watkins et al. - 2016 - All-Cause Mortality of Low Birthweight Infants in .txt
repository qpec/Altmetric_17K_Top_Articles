Abstract
Background
Low birthweight (LBW) is associated with increased mortality in infancy, but its association
with mortality in later childhood and adolescence is less clear. We investigated the associa-
tion between birthweight and all-cause mortality and identified major causes of mortality for
different birthweight groups.
Methods and Findings
We conducted a population study of all live births occurring in England and Wales between
1 January 1993 and 31 December 2011. Following exclusions, the 12,355,251 live births
were classified by birthweight: 500–1,499 g (very LBW [VLBW], n = 139,608), 1,500–2,499
g (LBW, n = 759,283), 2,500–3,499 g (n = 6,511,411), and �3,500 g (n = 4,944,949). The
association of birthweight group with mortality in infancy (<1 y of age) and childhood/adoles-
cence (1–18 y of age) was quantified, with and without covariates, through hazard ratios
using Cox regression. International Classification of Diseases codes identified causes of
death. In all, 74,890 (0.61%) individuals died between birth and 18 y of age, with 23% of
deaths occurring after infancy. Adjusted hazard ratios for infant deaths were 145 (95% CI
141, 149) and 9.8 (95% CI 9.5, 10.1) for the VLBW and LBW groups, respectively, com-
pared to the �3,500 g group. The respective hazard ratios for death occurring at age 1–18 y
were 6.6 (95% CI 6.1, 7.1) and 2.9 (95% CI 2.8, 3.1). Male gender, the youngest and oldest
maternal age bands, multiple births, and deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation score)
also contributed to increased deaths in the VLBW and LBW groups in both age ranges. In
infancy, perinatal factors, particularly respiratory issues and infections, explained 84% and
31% of deaths in the VLBW and LBW groups, respectively; congenital malformations
explained 36% and 23% in the LBW group and �2,500 g groups (2,500–3,499 g and
�3,500 g groups combined), respectively. Central nervous system conditions explained
20% of deaths in childhood/adolescence in the VLBW group, with deaths from neoplasms
and external conditions increasingly prevalent in the 1,500–2,499 g and �2,500 g

 birthweight groups. The study would have benefited had we had access to information on
gestational age and maternal smoking, but since the former is highly correlated with birth-
weight and the latter with deprivation, we believe that our findings remain robust despite
these shortcomings.
Conclusions
LBW is associated with infant and later child and adolescent mortality, with perinatal factors
and congenital malformations explaining many of the deaths. By understanding and amelio-
rating the influences of upstream exposures such as maternal smoking and deprivation,
later mortality can be decreased by reducing the delivery of vulnerable infants with LBW.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Death rates are increased in babies born with low birthweight (<2,500 g) compared to
those born with appropriate birth weight.
• As survival among babies with low birthweight continues to improve, it is important to
investigate longer term survival among these children, especially for those born with
very low birthweight (<1,500 g) or extremely low birthweight (<1,000 g).
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Using the largest and most recent dataset available, we investigated death rates in chil-
dren born with low birthweight between birth and 1 y of age and between 1 y and 18 y of
age.
• Among 12,355,251 live births in England and Wales between 1 January 1993 and 31
December 2011, there were 74,890 (0.61%) deaths between birth and 18 y of age, with
57,623 (77%) occurring in the first year of life and 17,267 (23%) occurring between 1
and 18 y of age.
• Death rates were higher in babies with low birthweight in both age groups, with death
occurring 130 times more frequently in the 500–1,499 g group than the �3,500 g group
in infancy. The majority (84%) of deaths were due to perinatal events in the very low
birthweight group but were more evenly distributed between perinatal events and con-
genital malformations in the other birthweight groups.
• Deaths in the 1–18 y group were more evenly distributed across causes, with conditions
of the nervous system (20%) and respiratory system (16%) being leading causes of death
in the lowest birthweight group but cancers and external conditions (including acci-
dents)—both at 20%—being primary causes of death in the �2,500 g groups.

 What Do These Findings Mean?
• The data showed that low birthweight is associated with increased death rates not only
in infancy but also through to adolescence. Since low birthweight has long-term conse-
quences, focusing on upstream events to prevent low birth weight remains an important
health goal.
Introduction
Low birthweight (LBW) (birthweight < 2,500 g) is associated with increased morbidity and
mortality in infancy and in adulthood [1–3]. These outcomes have become of greater impor-
tance as increasing numbers of extremely LBW and very LBW (VLBW) infants (defined as
birthweight < 1,000 g and < 1,500 g, respectively) survive the neonatal period [4,5]. Earlier
studies have investigated the relationship between LBW and mortality and morbidity in adult-
hood [6–8]. Risnes et al. in their systematic review included 15 cohorts with ~40,000 deaths
among 400,000 individuals [9]. The cohorts spanned a large range of birth dates and partici-
pant ages, although none included children or adolescents. Overall, there was a 6% lower risk
of death per kilogramme increase in birthweight. This association was strongest for mortality
from cardiovascular disease but weaker for mortality from neoplasms. Class et al., reporting on
almost 3.3 million births in Sweden between 1973 and 2007, studied death after the first year of
life up to 2012 [10]. They noted 0.73%, 0.44%, 0.35%, and 0.32% mortality in the �2,500 g,
2,501–3,000 g, 3,001–3,500 g, and >3,500 g birthweight groups, respectively. Furthermore,
LBW was associated with cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.
Whilst LBW newborns have increased mortality in the perinatal period and in infancy, it is
less clear if there is continuing increased mortality during childhood and adolescence. Due to
the increased survival of infants born with extremely LBW (<1,000 g) or VLBW (<1,500 g),
longer term outcomes, including morbidity, have become of increasing importance. Our recent
data show that both prematurity and fetal growth restriction in term-born infants are associ-
ated with later respiratory morbidity [11,12]. However, it is less clear if LBW is associated with
increased mortality in childhood and adolescence. Therefore, utilising what we believe to be
the largest and most recent cohort to date, we investigated the association between all-cause
mortality and birthweight and identified major causes of mortality for different birthweight
groups between birth and 18 y of age.
Methods
The study used anonymised data obtained after formal application to the Office for National
Statistics (ONS); thus, the authors did not have access to any identifiable data. Data for the All
Wales Perinatal Survey are collected after Confidentiality Advisory Group and ethical approv-
als. Anonymised data for all live births and deaths up to 18 y of age occurring in England and
Wales between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2011 were available (ONS). The data included
birthweight (babies are routinely weighed shortly after birth on calibrated scales) and the
covariates gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score, maternal age, and singleton/
multiple birth, as these have been shown to be associated with increased mortality [13,14]. In
addition, the data included age at time of death and cause of death. ONS data for infant deaths
were provided already classified into early neonatal, late neonatal, and post-neonatal deaths;

 beyond infancy, age in completed years at time of death was provided. Gestational age at birth
is not routinely recorded for deaths, but was available for the Welsh data. Welsh data were
obtained from the All Wales Perinatal Survey (https://awpsonline.uk/), as a separate cohort for
the same time period. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (version 9 up to
1999 and version 10 from 2000 onwards) were used to identify cause of death. Birthweights
were classified into four groups: 500–1,499 g (VLBW), 1,500–2,499 g (LBW), 2,500–3,499 g,
and �3,500 g. The latter two groups were merged for some analyses. The IMD, which is based
on a combined measure of deprivation including wealth, schooling, and home ownership in a
specific area [15], was divided into quintiles separately for England and Wales then combined
into a single variable. There were few missing values for the covariates (maximum of 22,061
[0.2%] for the IMD), and these missing values were unlikely to influence the overall conclu-
sions due to the large dataset.
Cox proportional hazards regression was specified as a means of analysing these data
through estimation of hazard ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals for the birth-
weight groups for infant mortality (death up to 12 mo of age) and child/adolescent mortality
(between 1 and 18 y of age, after censoring deaths occurring in infancy). A Cox model was
used to quantify differences between survival rates for the birthweight groups with and without
adjustments for relevant covariates. The proportional hazards assumption for the birthweight
groups was tested in each model by the addition of an appropriate time-dependant covariate—
a product of the system time variable called T_ (SPSS notation) and the variable age. All covari-
ates were categorical to permit possible non-linear responses. Mortality rates are also given in
person-years.
Inspired by peer review, we additionally considered how utilisation of birthweight as a con-
tinuous variable might change the results. We used Welsh infant mortality data, and continu-
ous birthweight was expressed as a five-knot restricted cubic spline to provide a linear
component within the Cox regression [16]. The knots were chosen in terms of birthweight at
0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 kg to approximately mimic the categorical birthweight bandings. A
five-knot spline has X (birthweight) and X2, X3, and X4, which are all functions in X. The haz-
ard function within the survival model is then
lðtjXÞ ¼ lðtÞexpðf ðXÞÞ ¼ lðtÞexpðbX þ b2X2 þ b3X3 þ b4X4Þ
Also following a request at peer review, we utilised the completeness of the data up to age 10
y—i.e., every child in the cohort either turned 10 y or died—to calculate the population attrib-
utable fraction (PAF) for deaths among 1 to 10 y olds [17–19].
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. Since congenital malformations are associated
with increased mortality [20], the analyses were repeated after exclusion of deaths from con-
genital malformations. Because there was an overall decrease in mortality over the last two
decades that could influence the results, we also confined the analyses to the most recent 5-y
period. In addition, deaths were classified according to the age bands 1–5, 6–10, and 11–18 y.
Finally, to assess the potential role of gestation period, we repeated the analyses for the Welsh
data with this covariate included, as gestation period was available for all births and deaths for
the study period. For the Welsh data, we also compared the infant mortality rate between
infants who had intrauterine growth restriction (<10% centile for birthweight adjusted for
gender and gestational age) and those with appropriate birthweight for their gestational age
(20%–80% centile) using LMSgrowth (Medical Research Council, UK) as the standard [21]. All
analyses were performed using PASW 20 (SPSS).

 Results
All-Cause Mortality
The total cohort included 12,457,528 live births in England and Wales between 1 January 1993
and 31 December 2011. Birthweight data were missing for 92,456 individuals, and data for
9,821 individuals were considered implausible or were outside the limits of analyses, including
birthweight of <500 g. The characteristics of the included 12,355,251 individuals, representing
121,208,305 person-years, are shown in Table 1. There were 139,608 (1.1% of all live births),
759,283 (6.1%), 6,511,411 (52.7%), and 4,944,949 (40.0%) live births in the 500–1,499 g, 1,500–
2,499 g, 2,500–3,499 g, and �3,500 g groups, respectively. In total, 74,890 (0.61%) live births
died between birth and 18 y of age, with 77% of deaths occurring in the first 12 mo of life and
23% between 1 and 18 y of age. The mortality rate per 100,000 person-years was 466 for infants
and 15.9 for children aged between 1 and 18 y. For the four birthweight groups, there were
25,414 (18.20%), 11,945 (1.57%), 25,750 (0.40%), and 11,781 (0.24%) deaths respectively.
Infant mortality rates were significantly greater in the VLBW and LBW groups: the rate
ratio and rate per 100,000 person-years were 129.7 and 1,985.2 for the 500–1,499 g group, 9.5
and 145.3 for the 1,500–2,499 g group, 1.9 and 28.8 for the 2,500–3,499 g group, and 1.0 (refer-
ence value) and 15.3 for the �3,500 g group, respectively. In addition, boys fared worse than
girls (S1 and S2 Figs) even with the exclusion of external conditions (including accidents) as
defined by ICD codes. The relative risk ratio of female:male deaths was 0.79 and 0.78 with and
without external conditions, respectively, for the <1 y group and 0.82 and 0.87 with and with-
out external conditions, respectively, for the 1–18 y group. Increased deprivation and multiple
births were associated with more deaths in all birthweight groups. Maternal age showed a U-
shaped relationship, with the greatest mortality in children born to the youngest and oldest
mothers (Table 1). The PAF for infant deaths and for deaths between 1 and 10 y of age was
56.6% and 10.7%, respectively, for the comparison between the 500–1,499 g and 1,500–2,499 g
groups combined and the �2,500 g groups (2,500–3,499 g and �3,500 g groups combined),
and 51.0% and 3.8%, respectively, when the <1,500 g group and �2,500 g groups were
compared.
For deaths occurring between 1 and 18 y of age, the rates per 100,000 person-years were
53.2, 29.5, 14.4, and 10.6, respectively, for the 500–1,499 g, 1,500–2,499 g, 2,500–2,499 g, and
�3,500 g groups. The rate ratios were 5.0, 2.8, and 1.3 for the first three groups, respectively,
compared to the �3,500 g group. Gender, deprivation, and maternal age bands showed similar
patterns as for infant deaths, but the difference between singleton and multiple births was
decreased.
Figs 1 and 2 show survival curves for the four birthweight groups in infancy and between 1
and 18 y of age (after censoring of deaths occurring in infancy). In addition to confirming the
association of LBW and increased mortality in infancy, the results show that mortality rates
were also increased for the lower birthweight groups in childhood/adolescence. Table 2 shows
hazard ratios adjusted for deprivation alone and for deprivation, maternal age, multiple birth
status, and gender. An inverse relationship was noted between the birthweight groups and
mortality, which was largely unaffected after adjustments for covariates.

 The coefficients β2, β3, and β4 were not significant (S9 Table), which implies that the log of
the hazard function λ is basically linear in birth weight (see S3 Fig). The actual expression is
lðtjXÞ ¼ lðtÞexpðf ðXÞÞ ¼ lðtÞexpð�2:370X þ 0:027X2 þ 0:063X3 þ 0:049X4Þ
When the hazard ratios were calculated at the midpoints between the knots, the values were
very close to those noted following Cox regression of the Welsh data using the categorical defi-
nitions (see S10 Table).
Cause-Specific Mortality
Fig 3 shows grouped causes of infant death for each birthweight group, with the �2,500 g
groups combined. In all, 84% of deaths in the <1,500 g group were related to perinatal events,
especially prematurity. For the 1,500–2,499 g group, perinatal events were responsible for 31%
of deaths, with congenital anomalies explaining 36% of deaths. Perinatal and congenital anom-
alies explained approximately half of the deaths in the �2,500 g groups. Further breakdown of
the most prevalent causes of infant deaths is shown in Table 3. Prematurity and hypoxic condi-
tions explained most of the perinatal deaths, and circulatory conditions explained a large

 groups, respectively, compared to the �2,500 g groups. For congenital anomalies, there was a
28-fold greater risk of dying in the <1,500 g group and a nearly 10-fold greater risk in the
1,500–2,499 group compared to the �2,500 groups.
Fig 4 shows grouped causes of death between 1 and 18 y by birthweight group. The causes
of death were more diverse, but perinatal causes remained significant in the <1,500 g group
and congenital anomalies in the 500–1,499 g and 1,500–2,499 g groups, but less so for the
�2,500 g groups. Further breakdown of the most prevalent causes of death is shown in Table 4,
where conditions associated with the nervous system, particularly cerebral palsy, were preva-
lent, with a rate ratio for cerebral palsy of 16.5 and 4.3 for the VLBW and LBW groups,

 respectively, compared to the �2,500 g groups. Overall, individuals in the VLBW and LBW
groups were 6.3 and 5.0 times more likely to die from congenital anomalies than individuals in
the �2,500 g groups. Respiratory conditions were responsible for more deaths in the two lower
birthweight groups, particularly from influenza/pneumonia, where the rate ratios were 8.4 and
3.7, respectively, compared to the �2,500 g groups. Neoplasms were the most common cause
of death in the �2,500 g groups, explaining 20% of deaths. External conditions including acci-
dents explained 18% of deaths for all birthweight groups; however, an increasing prevalence
was observed with increasing birthweight, i.e., 6% of deaths in the 500–1,499 g group increasing
to almost 20% in the �2,500 g group (Fig 4).
Sensitivity Analyses
Congenital malformations.
Results were only slightly different when congenital malfor-
mations were removed (S1 and S2 Tables).
Gestational age.
Gestational age was available for all Welsh live births via the All Wales
Perinatal Survey (https://awpsonline.uk/). For the study period, there were 635,428 live births
and 3,836 deaths between birth and 18 y of age for individuals with birthweight above 500 g.
For the VLBW group, the median gestation period was 29 wk (10th and 90th percentiles at 25
and 33 wk). Corresponding data for the LBW, 2,500–3,499 g, and �3,500 g groups were 36 (32,
39), 39 (37, 41), and 40 (39, 41) wk, respectively. S3 Table shows the Cox regression results for
the two age groups, which were very similar to the overall results. For all gestational age groups,
there was an increased risk of death in infancy if the infant had intrauterine growth restriction,
compared to appropriately grown infants (S4 Table), although the difference was not signifi-
cant for the 23–28 wk gestation group.
Temporal effects on mortality.
The time-varying covariate was significant in all regres-
sion models, suggesting that hazard ratios may be temporally affected. The effect of adjustment
for the time-varying covariate only slightly increased the hazard ratios (S5 Table). When the

 data were classified into shorter time periods (1993–1996, 1997–2001, 2002–2006, and 2007–
2011), the results remained essentially unchanged, with small increases for each time period
(S6 and S7 Tables). When deaths at age 1–18 y were divided into age groups, younger groups
had greater mortality (hazard ratio of 8.0 for 1–5 y olds, 4.2 for 6–10 y olds, and 2.7 for 11–18 y
olds) (S8 Table).
Discussion
This population-based study included data from 12,457,528 live births occurring in England
and Wales between 1993 and 2011. Overall, 0.61% (n = 74,890) died, with 23% of all deaths

 occurring at 1–18 y of age. Mortality was greater in the two lower birthweight groups than in
the two heavier birthweight groups in infancy and between 1–18 y of age, with little modifica-
tion by covariates. Adjusted hazard ratios for death in infancy were 145 (95% CI 141, 149) and
9.8 (95% CI 9.5, 10.1) for the VLBW and LBW groups, respectively, compared to the �3,500 g
group, and 6.6 (95% CI 6.1, 7.1) and 2.9 (95% CI 2.8, 3.1) for these birthweight groups for
deaths at 1–18 y of age. Gender, maternal age, multiple births, and deprivation also contributed
to increased deaths in the two lower birthweight groups. Deaths related to perinatal factors and
congenital malformations, especially from cardiovascular causes, were predominant in the two
lower birthweight groups in infancy and later in childhood and adolescence.
Increased infant mortality rate has been reported previously for lower birthweight groups
[9,22–26]. Horbar et al. reported an infant death rate of 12.4% for the 501–1,500 g birthweight
group—compared to 17.7% for the 500–1,499 g group our study—for 669 American hospitals
in 2009; the data are not directly comparable as they defined infant mortality as death occur-
ring prior to hospital discharge [27]. Doyle et al. reported that 66.9% of live-born individuals
with a birthweight of 500–999 g survived to 2 y of age excluding those with congenital anoma-
lies; when we calculated the same outcome for our data, the result was remarkably similar, at
63.1% [4]. Mortality after infancy in our <2,500 g groups is lower than Class and colleagues’

 report of 0.73% mortality in their �2,500 g group, most likely due to their follow-up to up to
34 y of age [10]. Of note is the systematic review by Risnes et al., who reported a 6% lower risk
of death for every kilogramme increase in birthweight [9].
Power and Li, using a cohort of ~17,000 individuals born in 1958 in Britain, showed an
inverse relationship between birthweight and infant mortality but not for deaths occurring >1
y of age [22]. Friedlander et al., in a larger cohort of 92,408 births in Jerusalem between 1964
and 1976, noted a strong relationship between LBW and death before 1 y of age but not
between LBW and death at 1–15 y of age [23]. Horta et al. studied 5,914 Brazilian children
born in 1982 for over 20 y, noting a significant relationship between LBW and mortality up to
4 y of age but not beyond [28]. Kajantie et al. studied 13,830 individuals born between 1924
and 1944 in Finland, following them from 1971 to a mean age of 56 y. They noted a positive
relationship between LBW and all-cause mortality at all ages for women but not for men, for
whom only infant mortality was associated with LBW [24]. Many of these studies were con-
strained by the limited numbers of deaths that occurred, especially beyond infancy.
Furthermore, many of these studies were conducted on populations several decades ago,
focusing on the consequences of LBW for adulthood morbidity and mortality. Overall survival
rates have improved, especially for infants born with birthweight � 1,500 g, and, more recently,
for those with birthweight � 1,000 g; our data, up to 2011, are more recent. By reporting mor-
tality rate data as both hazard ratios and person-years, we have taken into account that children
born recently will not have reached the age of 18 y during the study period. Our data show that
mortality is increased markedly in the lower birthweight groups compared to the heavier birth-
weight groups beyond infancy. Even in sensitivity analyses, the conclusions remain robust.
Males fared worse in both infancy and beyond. The mechanisms for this gender difference
remain unclear. Deprivation, multiple births, and maternal age have previously been shown to
be associated with increased mortality in infants, but we confirm their importance for
increased mortality also in childhood and adolescence [29–32].
Perinatal causes accounted for 52% of all deaths in infancy but accounted for 84% of deaths
in the VLBW group. Perhaps unsurprisingly, prematurity predominated as the cause of death
in this group, but of note is the fact that hypoxic/anoxic causes were responsible for a signifi-
cant number of deaths. Whilst there have been great improvements in maternal and neonatal
outcomes over the last two decades, these data suggest that targeting upstream risk factors for
LBW remains an important health goal. Congenital malformations were also important causes
of infant death, especially in the LBW group and the �2,500 g groups, explaining 36% and 23%
of deaths, respectively. Whilst congenital heart defects were responsible for a large number of
the deaths among those who died due to congenital malformation, disorders of the respiratory
and central nervous system and chromosomal afflictions resulted in significant mortality.
For the 1–18 y age group, the causes of death were more diverse, although perinatal causes
(precise causes were not recorded) were responsible for 13% of deaths in the VLBW group, and
congenital malformations for 10%–21% of deaths in all birthweight groups. Neoplasms and
accidents (external conditions) were important causes of death in the �2,500 g groups. This
concurs with the findings presented in Syddall et al., who noted an increase in neoplasms with
increasing birthweight, although their cohort covered a much wider age group (up to age 88 y)
than ours [33]. Similar data were also reported by Sidebotham et al. [34,35]. Rates of respira-
tory causes of death were similar between the groups. Hazard ratios were greater for almost all
causes of death (except neoplasms and external causes) in the VLBW and LBW groups com-
pared to the �2,500 g groups, thus suggesting that LBW has consequences well beyond early
childhood and that preventing LBW remains an important heath target. Whilst our aim was to
establish whether there is continuing mortality after low weight at birth and, if so, the underly-
ing causes for the increased mortality, it is clearly important to establish which upstream casual

 factors such as tobacco smoke and deprivation lead to delivery of LBW infants. Medical factors
may also contribute to earlier delivery, resulting in LBW infants; thus, caution is required not
to interpret LBW as being necessarily on the causal pathway to later mortality. Furthermore,
additional information is also required, as many deaths in the VLBW and LBW groups were
reported as being due to prematurity. In our study, maternal age, multiple births, and depriva-
tion all appeared to be associated with increased later mortality associated with LBW, thus pro-
viding additional interventional targets to improve mortality related to LBW. Although we did
not have information on antenatal maternal smoking exposure, it has been shown to be associ-
ated with LBW and clearly provides another target for intervention [36]. In addition, infant
deaths were increased in growth-restricted infants compared to appropriately grown infants
(S4 Table). Clearly, any factor—including maternal, fetal, and placental factors and also medi-
cal interventions—leading to growth-restricted infants at birth is associated with adverse lon-
ger term outcomes and provides an opportunity to investigate the upstream casual factors
resulting in LBW.
Crump et al. concluded from analyses of 674,820 births in Sweden from 1973 to 1979 that
cause-specific mortality was significantly related to gestational age at birth in their 1–5 y age
group but not for older age groups, although the latter conclusion may be due to limited num-
bers of deaths [37]. It has been suggested that relating mortality outcomes to gestational age
may be preferable to relating them to birthweight as gestational age reflects the maturity of the
infant at birth. Whilst this may be true, we believe that our results are equally valid, especially
as birthweight was highly correlated with gestational age, as shown by analyses of the Welsh
births, for which both gestational age and birthweight were available. The analyses of these
639,294 live births robustly supported our overall conclusions. Importantly, by investigating
the association of birthweight with mortality, we have identified three important areas that
need special attention: preterm labour, anoxic/hypoxic conditions of the newborn, and congen-
ital malformations. As major congenital malformations are associated with increased mortality,
we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding individuals with these conditions, but the relation-
ship between lower birthweight and mortality remained unchanged.
Survival rates improved over the 19-y study period; thus, we conducted another sensitivity
analysis investigating death up to 5 y of age for the most recent 5-y period. The association of
VLBW and LBW with later mortality remained, thus suggesting that the overall findings
remain robust. We also report the PAF for both infant and post-infant mortality, showing that
this fraction, unsurprisingly, is greatest in infancy, but for infants born at <2,500 g, it is nearly
11% for deaths occurring between 1 and 10 y of age. This implies that 11% of deaths between 1
and 10 y of age could be prevented by eliminating LBW.
The major strengths of this study and the reason why it is a relevant addition to the litera-
ture in this area are the inclusion of >12 million births and 74,890 deaths and the availability
of relevant and recent data up to the age of 18 y. We were also able to identify the underlying
causes of death. We had few missing data for the covariates we included, but we did not have
data on gestational age or maternal smoking. Since the former is highly correlated with birth-
weight and the latter with deprivation, we believe that our findings remain robust despite these
shortcomings. Additionally, by also treating birthweight as a continuous variable for the Welsh
data, we were able to show that there was no disadvantage in using banded, as opposed to con-
tinuous, birthweight data.
In conclusion, using what we believe to be the largest and most recent population-based
cohort that has been used to investigate this area, we have shown that VLBW and LBW are
associated with mortality in infancy and in childhood/adolescence. Major causes of death
include perinatal and congenital malformations in infancy, which continue to explain many
deaths that occur up to 18 y of age. LBW is clearly associated with later mortality in childhood

 and adolescence. By understanding and ameliorating the influences of upstream exposures
such maternal smoking and deprivation, later mortality can be decreased by reducing the deliv-
ery of vulnerable infants with LBW.
