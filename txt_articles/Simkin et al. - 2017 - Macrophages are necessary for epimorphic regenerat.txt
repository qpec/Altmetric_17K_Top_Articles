Abstract How the immune system affects tissue regeneration is not well understood. In this
study, we used an emerging mammalian model of epimorphic regeneration, the African spiny
mouse, to examine cell-based inflammation and tested the hypothesis that macrophages are
necessary for regeneration. By directly comparing inflammatory cell activation in a 4 mm ear injury
during regeneration (Acomys cahirinus) and scarring (Mus musculus), we found that both species
exhibited an acute inflammatory response, with scarring characterized by stronger
myeloperoxidase activity. In contrast, ROS production was stronger and more persistent during
regeneration. By depleting macrophages during injury, we demonstrate a functional requirement
for these cells to stimulate regeneration. Importantly, the spatial distribution of activated
macrophage subtypes was unique during regeneration with pro-inflammatory macrophages failing
to infiltrate the regeneration blastema. Together, our results demonstrate an essential role for
inflammatory cells to regulate a regenerative response.

Introduction
Over the past three decades, regenerative biology has merged its rich historical practice with new
genetic tools to discover how animals are capable of regenerating tissue and organs. Regeneration
biologists commonly investigate organ regeneration in a range of metazoans including hydra, planar-
ians, crickets, zebrafish, salamanders, newts, lizards and even some mammals. Conventional studies
perturb cellular functions or genetic pathways to inhibit the normal regenerative response and thus
seek to identify key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the regenerative response to
injury. Alternatively, some investigators have employed a comparative approach to discover key
mechanisms underlying regeneration. In this framework, two related species undergo different
responses to injury in identical tissues and exhibit either a regenerative or a scarring response
(Gawriluk et al., 2016; Sa
´nchez Alvarado, 2000; Sikes and Bely, 2010; Wagner and Misof, 1992).
This comparative approach may be particularly useful for unraveling complex interactions such as
how inflammation and immunity permit, instruct or inhibit local cells to initiate and undergo func-
tional regeneration in lieu of scarring.
Exactly how cellular inflammation and immunity affect regeneration remains controversial. One
perspective posits that inflammation impedes regeneration (Harty et al., 2003; Mescher et al.,
2017), a view supported by reports of less robust immune responses in animals and tissue that
regenerate when compared to those that cannot (Brant et al., 2016; Mak et al., 2009;
Mescher et al., 2013; Redd et al., 2004). Similarly, chronic inflammation leads to compromised
healing and fibrotic disease (Martin and Leibovich, 2005; Riches, 1988; Wynn, 2004). However,

 physical injury elicits inflammation during regeneration and scarring. Specifically, cytokines and che-
mokines produced by neutrophils, macrophages and T-cells recruit fibroblasts, promote granulation
tissue formation, activate myofibroblasts, and promote collagen production and deposition
(Aliprantis et al., 2007; Lakos et al., 2006; Mori et al., 2008; Ong et al., 1999; Smith et al.,
1995). Dampening the inflammatory response by depleting leukocytes creates better healing out-
comes following damage to skin, skeletal muscle, and liver (Dovi et al., 2003; Duffield et al., 2005;
Martin et al., 2003; Novak et al., 2014). Thus, when one considers that injury-mediated inflamma-
tion and immunity is an ancient process shared by animals (and plants) that can and cannot regener-
ate, a more nuanced relationship between regeneration and immunity emerges.
Mounting evidence suggests that certain immune cells may be necessary to induce and sustain
regeneration. Depletion of phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages and dendritic cells) inhibits regenera-
tion in axolotl limbs, zebrafish fins, and neonatal mouse hearts (Aurora et al., 2014; Godwin et al.,
2013; Petrie et al., 2014). Furthermore, the timing of leukocyte depletion has a major impact on
regenerative outcomes (Arnold et al., 2007; Duffield et al., 2005; Varga et al., 2016) supporting
an important role for changing immune cell phenotypes (Gensel and Zhang, 2015; Koh and DiPie-
tro, 2011; Mantovani et al., 2013). Although these findings support a positive function of certain
immune cells on regeneration, they also simplify important differences across species. For instance,
salamanders lack important T-cell phenotypes and utilize primarily IgM rather than IgG antibodies
while mounting an adaptive immune response (Chen and Robert, 2011; Cotter et al., 2008). While
this diversity is of interest to biologists, it may obscure the goal of regenerative medicine – to induce
regeneration in humans. This makes mammalian models of tissue regeneration especially relevant to
questions regarding what role immune cells play during regeneration.
eLife digest The cells of the immune system are essential to defend an organism from disease.
In addition, some of them are also thought to play an important role in helping injured tissues heal
or even regrow. For example, when an animal is injured, immune cells such as macrophages rush to
the wounded site to clear debris and help repair the damage. Macrophages come in different forms
and subtypes, and express different protein markers on their surface, depending on where in the
body they reside.
Few mammals can completely renew or regrow a damaged tissue – a process known as tissue
regeneration. Instead, humans and most other mammals repair injuries by producing scar tissue,
which has different properties compared to the original tissue it replaces. One exception is the
African spiny mouse, which, unlike other rodents studied, can regrow skin and fur, nerves, muscles,
and even cartilage. It has been shown that in highly regenerative animals such as salamanders and
zebrafish, macrophages are necessary to initiate tissue regeneration. Documented cases of tissue
regeneration in mammals are rare and therefore less understood. Until now, it was not clear why
two species as closely related as spiny mice and house mice would heal identical injuries in different
ways.
To better understand how new tissue regenerates, Simkin et al. compared the healing abilities of
spiny mice and house mice after they received an injury to their ear and showed that macrophages
appeared to be important for both the regeneration of new tissue and the formation of scar tissue.
When Simkin et al. removed all macrophages in the ear of spiny mice, their ear tissue could not heal
and regrow. When the macrophages were allowed to re-invade the injured site, the tissue in the ear
regenerated. Further experiments showed that during tissue regeneration and scarring, different
subtypes of macrophages appeared to be active.
The findings suggest that specific subtypes of macrophages could be a key element in helping
tissue to regenerate. An important next step will be to further explore the different types of
macrophages and whether the injury site determines what types of cells are active. A deeper
understanding of how tissues can regrow in mammals will be essential to advancing our ability to
stimulate tissue regeneration in humans.

in

(Gawriluk et al., 2016; Goss and Grimes, 1975; Joseph and Dyson, 1966; Matias Santos et al.,
2016; Seifert et al., 2012a; Williams-Boyce and Daniel, 1980). Recent work in African spiny mice
species (Acomys cahirinus, A. kempi and A. percivali) supports ear pinna regeneration as an epimor-
phic process (Gawriluk et al., 2016) aligning it with appendage regeneration in other vertebrate
regenerators such as salamanders, newts, zebrafish and lizards. Importantly, not all mammals can
regenerate ear tissue providing variation to compare regeneration and scarring in identical tissue
(Gawriluk et al., 2016; Williams-Boyce and Daniel, 1986). Spiny mice are able to regenerate full-
thickness skin, blood vessels, nerves, cartilage, adipose tissue and some muscle, whereas the same
injury in Mus musculus (outbred and inbred strains) leads to incomplete ear hole closure and scar for-
mation (Gawriluk et al., 2016; Matias Santos et al., 2016; Seifert et al., 2012a). Here, we report
how the two main orchestrators of inflammation, neutrophils and macrophages, respond to injury
during epimorphic regeneration in Acomys cahirinus compared to scarring in Mus musculus. Acomys
and Mus exhibit the same circulating leukocyte profiles, and we demonstrate a robust acute inflam-
matory response in both species. We demonstrate higher neutrophil activity in the scarring system
compared to higher ROS activity in the regenerative system. We show that macrophages between
the two species display similar in vitro properties providing a comparable baseline prior to and fol-
lowing injury. We also observed distinct differences in the spatiotemporal distribution of macro-
phage subtypes during regeneration and scarring. Finally, depletion of macrophages, prior to and
during injury, inhibited blastema formation and regeneration, thus demonstrating a necessity for
these cells.
Results
Circulating leukocyte profiles are similar between Acomys and Mus
We first set out to test if baseline differences in circulating peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profiles
existed prior to injury in Acomys and Mus. Using a Sudan Black B modified Giemsa-Wright stain, we
quantified monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils from Acomys and Mus whole blood
(Figure 1A–D). Both species exhibited similar profiles and typical morphologies for all four cell types
(Figure 1A–E). For instance, monocytes were distinguishable by their kidney-shaped nucleus and dif-
fuse cytoplasmic stain (Figure 1A), while lymphocytes were similar in size to RBCs and their compact
nucleus filled the entire cell (Figure 1B). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils stained strongly with
Sudan-Black B and displayed multi-lobed nuclei (Figure 1C). In contrast, while eosinophils displayed
multi-lobed nuclei and dark pink granules in the cytoplasm they contained few if any Sudan-Black-
stained granules (Figure 1D). In Mus and Acomys, the percentage of circulating lymphocytes was
significantly higher than other leukocyte populations, and eosinophils comprised the smallest popu-
lation of circulating leukocytes (Figure 1E) (Tukey’s Multiple comparison, simple effect p<0.05, Fig-
ure 1—source data 1). These data are consistent with other leukocyte profiles from outbred CD1
mice

(Hedrich, 2004). Importantly, while we identified differences in the percentage of leukocyte sub-
types within each species, leukocyte profiles were the same between Acomys and Mus (two-way
ANOVA, species effect F = 0.01, p=0.92, and leukocyte subtype effect F = 97.04, p<0.0001, n = 8
Acomys; n = 4 Mus). Our data demonstrate these two rodent species possess the same circulating
leukocyte profiles prior to injury and provide a baseline to ask if local differences arise following
injury.
The kinetics of inflammatory cell accumulation are generally similar
between regeneration and scarring
Building on our observation that circulating leukocyte populations are similar in Acomys and Mus,
we next assessed the acute inflammatory reaction to injury during epimorphic regeneration and scar-
ring using our 4 mm punch assay through the ear pinna (Gawriluk et al., 2016; Seifert et al.,
2012a) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C). To quantify the influx of myeloid cells into the injured
ear tissue, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using CD11b (Figure 2A–C).
CD11b (aka ITGAM) is a broad-spectrum marker used to isolate mammalian macrophages and

 neutrophils across a range of species from mouse to humans (Figueiredo et al., 2013;
Sawano et al., 2001; Tamatani et al., 1991; Venneri et al., 2007; Venosa et al., 2015). Using our
recently published regeneration transcriptome for Acomys, we found Cd11b was upregulated after
injury (Gawriluk et al., 2016). Alignment of Acomys and Mus Cd11b revealed 88% nucleotide iden-
tity compared to a 79% identity between Mus and Human (Table 1). FACS analysis using CD11b iso-
lated a specific cell population in Acomys and Mus (Figure 2A–B). While we observed a significant
increase in CD11b+ cells in response to injury in both species (two-way ANOVA with main effect

 time F = 31.86, p<0.0001 and species F = 17.06, p=0.0002), the acute increase at D3 was signifi-
cantly greater in Mus than Acomys (Sidak’s multiple comparison test p<0.05) (Figure 2C).
Because CD11b isolates macrophages and neutrophils, we next sought to individually quantify
neutrophil and macrophage influx at the injury site in Acomys and Mus. We first used the well-char-
acterized cell surface Ly6G antigen to separate neutrophil and macrophage populations in Mus
(Bain et al., 2014; Mirza et al., 2009; Rose et al., 2012) and detected a clear population of Ly6G+
cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). This population of Ly6G+ cells was significantly elevated in
healing tissue between D1-D7, with peak numbers occurring at D3 (Figure 2—figure supplement
2B). Whereas Ly6G+/CD11b+ cells dominated the injury site at D3 in Mus (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1C -blue dots), these cells were replaced by a Ly6G-/CD11b+ population at D7 (Figure 2—fig-
ure supplement 2C - red dots). Thus, during the initial wave of leukocyte recruitment in Mus (D1-5),
CD11b+ cells are primarily neutrophils and at later stages of inflammation (D7-D15) CD11b+ cells
are primarily macrophages (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D). Interestingly, we did not detect a
clear Ly6G+ population of CD11b+ cells from either tissue or circulating blood isolated from Acomys
(Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).
The failure to resolve a discrete population of Ly6G+ cells in Acomys suggested neutrophils might
more closely resemble rat and human neutrophils which lack Ly6G (Lee et al., 2013). The mouse Ly6

 gene complex is composed of 11 known Ly6 genes. Of these, the subcluster Ly6b, c, g and e are
most highly expressed by mouse neutrophils, whereas rat and human lack all these genes except
Ly6e (Lee et al., 2013). While we identified the genomic sequence and expressed transcript for the
Acomys homolog of Ly6e (Table 1), examination of the Ly6 gene complex using our preliminary A.
cahirinus genome revealed no homologs for Ly6b, Ly6c or Ly6g (Table 1). These data reveal that the
genomic structure for the Ly6 complex in Acomys is similar to rat and human suggesting that
Acomys neutrophils more closely resemble rat and human neutrophils which also lack Ly6g
(Lee et al., 2013).
Given these results, we turned to the neutrophilic marker MPO which reliably detects polymor-
phonuclear cells in tissue sections across species (Bradley et al., 1982; Petrie et al., 2014;
Seifert et al., 2012b). We assessed MPO reactivity at D1, D3, D5 and D10 to compare neutrophil
accumulation and clearance in Mus and Acomys (Figure 2D,E). Neutrophils were readily identified
as MPO+ with multi-lobed nuclei (Figure 2D), and Mus displayed a significantly higher number of
neutrophils 24 hr after injury when compared to Acomys (two-way ANOVA with main effects, species
F = 8.229, p=0.007 and time F = 11.12, p<0.0001; Sidak’s multiple comparison test for simple effect
between species, p<0.05 at D1) (Figure 2E). After D1, Mus and Acomys showed comparable num-
bers of neutrophils at the site of injury with a return to baseline levels by D10 (Figure 2E, Sidak’s
multiple comparison test for simple effect between species, p>0.05 at D3-10). In both species, neu-
trophils initially accumulated distal to the cut in the dermis and periodically exhibited signs of cell
death (e.g. pyknotic nuclei and reduction in cell size). We also observed neutrophils within the scab
at all timepoints analyzed (Figure 2D). Taken together, our results show that both species exhibit
neutrophil infiltration, accumulation and clearance in response to injury, although neutrophils accu-
mulate faster, at higher levels and appear to be more active 24 hr after injury in Mus.
Concomitant with neutrophil invasion, circulating and tissue-specific macrophages are activated
in response to injury and are recruited to the injury site at the outset of regenerative and scarring
responses (Godwin et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Nguyen-Chi et al., 2015; reviewed in Novak and
Koh, 2013; Petrie et al., 2014; Varga et al., 2016). To ascertain total macrophage abundance in
healing tissue, we employed the pan-macrophage marker, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule
1 (IBA-1), to quantify the spatiotemporal pattern of macrophage infiltration in Acomys and Mus. IBA-
1 is an actin-binding protein active in macrophages and microglia and has been used to label cells in
mouse, dog, cat, human and other primates (Imai et al., 1996; Ko
¨hler, 2007; Pierezan et al., 2014;
Sasaki et al., 2001; Schmidt et al., 2016). In Acomys, we found IBA-1+ cells in the mesenchyme
and
the
epidermis,
but
IBA-1

from

(Figure 2F, arrows). We found no significant difference in the amount of IBA-1+ cells between Mus
and Acomys at D5, D10 or D15 (Figure 2G, two-way ANOVA main effect species F = 0.132
p=0.723, and main effect time F = 0.438 p=0.655). Accumulation of IBA1+ cells occurred at similar
levels in both species within 200 mM proximal to and distal to the site of injury (Figure 2H–K). Nota-
bly, IBA-1+ cells were present within the blastemal region of D15 ears in Acomys (Figure 2H,I) as
well as within the central granulation tissue region of D15 ears in Mus (Figure 2J,K). These data
demonstrate that macrophages persist at the injury site during regeneration and scarring up to 2
weeks after injury.
Acute inflammation during regeneration is characterized by high ROS
production
To determine the extent of the inflammatory reaction in vivo, we measured myeloperoxidase (MPO)
activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Tseng and Kung, 2012). To track MPO activ-
ity in vivo we used luminol, a chemiluminescent compound that exhibits specific and high sensitivity
for phagocyte-mediated MPO activity from neutrophils (Gross et al., 2009). Due to its larger size
and reduced cell permeability (compared to luminol), we used lucigenin to measure ROS production
by NADPH oxidase. Lucigenin chemiluminescence is primarily attributed to macrophage activation,
and to a lesser extent from endothelial cell and neutrophil populations (Tseng and Kung, 2012).
Tracking luminol chemiluminescence, Mus displayed peak MPO activity between 24–48 hr after
injury (Figure 3A, repeated measures ANOVA F = 5.095, p<0.001). This finding was congruent with
our immunohistochemical cell count data using MPO (Figure 2E). While Acomys displayed a similar
peak in MPO activity, the magnitude was significantly muted compared to Mus (Figure 3A, *Sidak’s
multiple comparison test p<0.05 for time points indicated). Conversely, Acomys exhibited a much

 more robust production of ROS compared to Mus during the entire inflammatory phase (Figure 3B,
repeated measures ANOVA F = 4.536, p<0.001). Lucigenin chemiluminescence peaked 24 hr after
injury in Acomys and remained significantly elevated compared to Mus through D5 (Figure 3B,
*Sidak’s multiple comparison test p�0.05 for the time indicated). Throughout the inflammatory
phase, lucigenin chemiluminescence was significantly muted in Mus (Figure 3B). Together, these
data suggest a bias toward strong neutrophilic MPO activity during scarring and early and pro-
longed macrophage-produced ROS during regeneration.
Macrophage depletion inhibits blastema formation and regeneration
Persistence of macrophages at the injury site, coupled with stark differences in ROS production sug-
gested that macrophages might positively affect regeneration consistent with observations during
Xenopus tail regeneration (Love et al., 2013). In vivo depletion of macrophages using clodronate
liposomes during axolotl limb regeneration and via genetic ablation in zebrafish caudal fins supports
a requirement for these cells to stimulate a regenerative response (Godwin et al., 2013;
Petrie et al., 2014). Clodronate liposomes have been widely used to deplete systemic and local
populations of phagocytes, the majority of which are macrophages (reviewed in van Rooijen and
Hendrikx, 2010). In order to test if macrophages also regulate epimorphic regeneration in spiny
mice, we depleted these cells by injecting clodronate liposomes (Clo-Lipo) at the base of the ear
immediately prior to injury (D0), at D2, and at D5 (Figure 4A). Control animals received similar injec-
tions of PBS liposomes (control) (Figure 4A). Whereas control ear holes initiated a regenerative
response and began closing at D5, Clo-Lipo injected animals did not initiate ear hole closure until
D20 (Figure 4B–C). In contrast to control ears, which showed complete ear hole closure by D34, all
Clo-Lipo injected ears remained open past D44 (Figure 4B,C). Complete hole closure and regenera-
tion among Clo-Lipo-treated ears was delayed, with 3/12 closed by D53, 8/12 ears closed by D60
and 11/12 ears closed by D70 (Figure 4B–C). Although blastema formation and expansion occurred
in PBS-Lipo-treated ears, examination of Clo-Lipo-treated ears showed a sharp reduction in cell
accumulation past the original cut site anda delay in blastema formation at D20 (Figure 4D–E). The
early stages of blastema formation were evident in 50% of macrophage-depleted ears (4/8) begin-
ning at D20 (Figure 4D–E, dotted line denotes original plane of biopsy).
In Clo-Lipo-treated ears, we noted a slight expansion of ear hole area and residual scabbing at
D10 suggesting defects in re-epithelialization following macrophage depletion (Figure 4B–C).
Indeed, examining macrophage-depleted ear pinna at D5 we observed a lack of cartilage histolysis
(Figure 4F, green arrow) and a delay in re-epithelialization (Figure 4F, blue arrows). This delay in re-
epithelialization was coincident with an accumulation of neutrophils (Figure 4G yellow arrowheads)
when compared to control ears (Figure 4H–I). Monocytic cells were apparent throughout the tissue
in control ears (Figure 4H green arrowheads) but were absent in Clo-Lipo treated ears (Figure 4F).
We confirmed effective depletion of macrophages from the injury site by staining for the pan macro-
phage marker IBA-1 (Figure 4J–L). Macrophage populations can be restored within 2 weeks of the
final

treated ears, concurrent with re-epithelialization and initiation of blastema formation (Figure 4M–N).
Together, these data support the important activity of macrophages to facilitate histolysis and re-
epithelialization during the early phase of regeneration. Furthermore, our data suggests that macro-
phages directly or indirectly are necessary for blastema formation during regeneration in spiny mice.
Activated CD86+ macrophages are restricted from the regeneration
blastema
Macrophages maintain an interesting duality as professional phagocytes and as coordinators of the
local immune response. Because macrophages were present and persistent during regeneration and
scarring, it was possible that macrophage phenotype might contribute to the different healing out-
comes. First, we asked whether spiny mice macrophages could undergo classical (M1) and alterna-
tive (M2) activation under stereotypical conditions (Figure 5). We isolated spiny mouse bone marrow
as previously described for Mus (Edwards et al., 2006) and activated these cells using Macrophage-
Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) to produce activated bone-marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDM) (Figure 5). After 1 week in culture, all BMDM were CD11b+ (Figure 5A).

 Next, we tested if Acomys macrophages could undergo classical and alternative activation (polari-
zation) toward an M1 or M2 phenotype, respectively. Classic activation assays stimulate BMDMs
with the pro-inflammatory molecules interferon gamma (IFNg) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which
specifically increase the expression of CD86 among other pro-inflammatory cell surface markers and
cytokines (Edwards et al., 2006; Hathcock et al., 1994; Inaba et al., 1994). In response to IFNg
and LPS, Acomys BMDMs remained CD11b+ and upregulated CD86 compared to un-stimulated
and M2 stimulated macrophages (Figure 5B–F). Alternative activation with interleukin 4 (IL4)
increases the expression of CD206 (Stein et al., 1992) and Arginase 1 among other pro-reparative,
cytoprotective genes. In response to IL-4, Acomys BMDMs remained CD11b+ and expressed CD206
(Figure 5C,I). In contrast, most unstimulated and classically activated BMDMs were CD206-
(Figure 5G–H). In addition to CD206, stimulation with IL-4 also elicited Arginase 1 reactivity in
BMDMs (Figure 5F). We also isolated and activated BMDMs from Mus and confirmed they display a
similar pattern of protein regulation in response to polarization (Figure 5J–R). In addition to these
phenotypic markers, we also tested the mouse pan macrophage marker F4/80 (Austyn and Gordon,
1981) for its reactivity to Acomys macrophages (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Using unstimu-
lated BMDMs, we only found a small subset of F4/80+ cells in Acomys compared to ubiquitous
labeling in Mus (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,D). Following IFNg+LPS stimulation, we observed
an increase in F4/80+ Acomys macrophages, whereas IL-4 stimulation did not increase F4/80 label-
ing compared to unstimulated BMDMs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C). Examining F4/80
staining in vivo, we found that F4/80+ cells were distinct from CD206+ cells in Acomys (Figure 5—
figure supplement 1G). In contrast, we found that F4/80+ cells were mostly CD206+ in Mus sup-
porting its localization as a pan macrophage marker in Mus (Figure 5—figure supplement 1H).
Thus, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that F4/80 only marks a subset of macrophages in
Acomys (most likely M1). Despite this difference in F4/80 reactivity, our in vitro results show intrinsic
similarities between Acomys and Mus macrophages supporting a general capacity to activate and
change phenotype given specific wound contexts and stimuli.
Next, we addressed whether differences in the spatiotemporal distribution of macrophage sub-
types might promote regeneration in lieu of scarring. First, we quantified accumulation of classically
activated macrophages in healing tissue by staining for CD86 (Figure 5E and Figure 6A–B). Using
immunohistochemistry to localize CD86+ cells in Acomys and Mus, we determined these cells were
rare in uninjured ear tissue (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–F). Although rare, in Mus, we did find
CD86+-positive cells in the epidermal layer reminiscent of human Langerhan’s cells (Boltjes and van
Wijk, 2014) and in the perichondrium (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–F), whereas in uninjured
Acomys tissue CD86+ cells were restricted to the dermis (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E).
These cells had long, thin projections and a spindle-like shape characteristic of dermal dendritic cells
found in humans (Boltjes and van Wijk, 2014).
We next assessed the distribution of CD86+ cells during regeneration and scarring. Comparing
CD86+ cells distal to the injury between species, we found a significant effect of time (two-way
ANOVA F = 131.8, p<0.0001) and species (two-way ANOVA F = 220.0, p<0.0001) whereby injury eli-
cited a strong increase in CD86+ cells per unit area in Mus, but not in Acomys at D3 (Sidak’s multiple
comparison test p<0.05) (Figure 6A). Examining the spatial distribution of CD86+ cells in Mus, we
found that they accumulated in the connective tissue distal to the cut cartilage (Figure 6B). Co-stain-
ing with the T-cell surface marker CD3 revealed interactions between CD86+ and CD3+ cells in this
region as well as in the epidermis, consistent with the role of CD86 as a co-stimulatory molecule for
T-cell activation (Figure 6B). In contrast to Mus, CD86+ macrophages behaved very differently in
Acomys during regeneration. Following injury, we did not observe CD86+ cells accumulating in the
blastema (Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1J). Instead, at D15 we observed clusters of
CD86+ cells located almost exclusively lateral to the cut cartilage (Figure 6B). Thus, while CD86+
cells are present in Acomys, they remain proximally restricted and do not infiltrate the blastema,

 whereas these same cells in Mus accumulate in newly deposited connective tissue (granulation
tissue).
Although alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are usually associated with pro-regenerative
outcomes, this concept remains largely untested for epimorphic regeneration (Campbell et al.,
2013; Kigerl et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014). Using our comparative system, we tested for an asso-
ciation between CD206+ (M2) macrophages and a regenerative response. Prior to injury, CD206+
cells were spatially distributed throughout the ear in similar numbers in both species (Figure 6—fig-
ure supplement 2A–D). These cells were present in the dermis between the epidermis and elastic
cartilage of the ear (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D). We did not detect CD206+ cells in the
epidermis in either species. Quantifying CD206+ cells distal to the injury in Mus and Acomys, we
observed no significant difference across time (two-way ANOVA, F = 2.330, p=0.125) or between
species (two-way ANOVA, F = 1.540, p=0.23) (Figure 6C). After D3, CD206+ cell numbers remained
constant in Acomys and Mus and showed no significant change distal to the injury site (Figure 6C).
Unlike CD86+ cells that localize proximal to the injury in Acomys, CD206+ cells were observed distal
to the injury site in Acomys (and Mus) (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 2E–H). How-
ever, the distal distribution of these cells in Acomys appeared regionalized with a CD206+ dense
region directly beneath the epidermis and a CD206+ sparse region in the central blastema region of
the injury (Figure 6D). In Mus, CD206+ cells were evenly distributed throughout the connective tis-
sue distal to the injury (Figure 6D). Together with our data for IBA-1, our results show that
while macrophages infiltrate the injury area during regeneration, the blastema is relatively free of
classically activated macrophages.
Discussion
A popular hypothesis to explain why most mammals heal injuries with scar tissue is that they evolved
a strong inflammatory and adaptive immune response that induces intense fibrosis in lieu of regener-
ation (Godwin, 2014; Mescher et al., 2017). Yet, the fact that some mammals exhibit epimorphic
regeneration (e.g. rodent and primate digit tips, rabbit and spiny mice ear punches and skin) (Bor-
gens, 1982; Gawriluk et al., 2016; Goss and Grimes, 1975; Han et al., 2008; Joseph and Dyson,
1966; Neufeld and Zhao, 1993; Seifert et al., 2012a; Singer et al., 1987) suggests that regenera-
tion can occur despite a complex adaptive immune system. Different immune system components
and inherent physiological differences between mammals and traditional regeneration models like
salamanders, newts and zebrafish (e.g. homeothermy versus poikilothermy, high versus low meta-
bolic rates, etc.) make it difficult to extrapolate how inflammation and immunity might act to affect
regeneration in mammals. There have been few studies detailing how the immune system responds
during epimorphic regeneration and thus how it compares to immune mediated fibrosis. In this
study, we have begun to address how inflammatory cells behave during complex tissue regeneration
in African spiny mice (Acomys). We identified key differences in the spatiotemporal infiltration of
inflammatory cells in regenerating and scar-forming systems and demonstrated that reactive oxygen
species (ROS) catalyzed through NADPH oxidation were significantly increased at the injury site dur-
ing regeneration. Importantly, we showed that macrophages were required for regeneration to pro-
ceed. These results support a role for inflammatory cell signals polarizing the injury response toward
two very different outcomes.
Our characterization of circulating leukocyte profiles in Acomys and Mus, demonstrate that inher-
ent differences in myeloid cell numbers do not explain intrinsic differences in regenerative ability.
This contradicts a recent report suggesting that spiny mouse blood is neutropenic and that lower
numbers of circulating neutrophils are responsible for a muted inflammatory response to injury

 (Brant et al., 2016). In fact, our immunohistochemical data comparing neutrophil infiltration in
Acomys and Mus show that while neutrophils accumulate faster during scarring, peak neutrophil
numbers are equivalent 3 days after injury in both species. In general agreement with this data, we
observed differences in the intensity of myeloperoxidase activity via luminol chemilumenscence per-
sisting until D4 after which time there was no difference across species. While neutrophil invasion in
response to injury is apparent across all regenerating vertebrates (Jordan and Speidel, 1924;
Li et al., 2012; Seifert et al., 2012b), our results suggest that precise activity levels could lead to

(Margalit et al., 2005; Mescher et al., 2013), our data supports an initial wave of cell-based inflam-

regeneration
(Godwin et al., 2013; Petrie et al., 2014). Our results extend these vertebrate studies by demon-
strating a similar requirement during epimorphic regeneration in mammals. Acute depletion of
phagocytic monocytes with clodronate liposomes delayed the initiation of ear hole closure and blas-
tema formation by up to 2 weeks. Importantly, re-commencement of blastema formation was con-
current with the return of macrophages into the injured tissue. Examination of ear tissue at D5
revealed that phagocyte depletion delayed re-epithelialization and histolysis, two key events that
are themselves required for regeneration. It is possible that macrophages provide an initiating signal
for regeneration or remove subpopulations of local cells secreting inhibitory signals (e.g. senescent
cells). In support of the first idea, ROS production has been suggested as an essential early signal for
regeneration based on studies in Xenopus and zebrafish tail models of regeneration (Gauron et al.,
2013; Love et al., 2013). Macrophages are a major source of ROS after injury, and we observed sig-
nificantly stronger and prolonged ROS production during regeneration compared to scarring
(Weber et al., 2016). Understanding the functional consequences of balanced ROS production
through NADPH oxidation versus myeloperoxidase activity will require a more complete understand-
ing of what cell types are responsible for ROS production and how ROS more specifically can affect
local cellular phenotypes.
In support of the idea that macrophages may limit inhibitory signals through selective removal of
senescent cells, recent work in salamanders suggested that clearance of senescent cells is important
for limb regeneration (Yun et al., 2015) and persistence of senescent cells during liver regeneration
leads to excessive fibrosis (Krizhanovsky et al., 2008). Furthermore, the accumulation of senescent
cells with age has been suggested to shorten lifespan, degrade tissue function, and increase the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mammals (Baker et al., 2016, 2011). These and other
studies suggest that proper clearance of senescent cells from damaged tissues may promote regen-
erative outcomes. Interestingly, as the induction of cellular senescence occurs during normal wound
healing when a scar forms, it is possible that clearance of senescent cells is less important than the
secretory phenotype of these cells which in some contexts can promote regeneration. For instance,
short exposure to factors secreted by senescent cells in response to injury decreases fibrosis and
promotes stem cell gene expression (Chiche et al., 2017; Jun and Lau, 2010; Ritschka et al.,
2017). These studies underscore the importance of analyzing how senescent cells regulate regenera-
tion and scarring and provide evidence that the phenotype of senescent cells and their timely
removal by macrophages could be an important factor in Acomys ear regeneration.
While our data demonstrates that macrophages as a total population are required for regenera-
tion in mammals, a requirement for macrophage subtypes and how these cells interact with other
immune cells during epimorphic regeneration is not known. Because the activation of macrophages
is generally associated with collagen production and fibrotic disease (Duffield et al., 2005;
Gibbons et al., 2011; Wynn, 2008), the question remains as to how these immune cells orchestrate
both regeneration and scar-formation in different species. Previous studies suggest a temporal com-
ponent to macrophage function as a major factor for determining the outcome to skin, liver and
bone injury (Alexander et al., 2011; Arnold et al., 2007; Duffield et al., 2005; Mirza et al., 2009).
While we did not observe temporal differences in total macrophage accumulation between Acomys
and Mus in the ear pinna, we did observe distinct differences in the spatial distribution of macro-
phage subtypes. For instance, while M2 (CD206+) macrophages were present at comparable levels
in Acomys and Mus, we observed a zone dense in CD206+ macrophages in Acomys that were asso-
ciated with de novo hair follicle development and a zone sparse in CD206+ cells that were associ-
ated with an area of decreased collagen production and blastema formation. Whereas CD206+ cells
were absent from the blastema in Acomys, in Mus, we observed CD206+ cells throughout the colla-
gen-rich granulation tissue, a situation similar to fibrosis observed during skin wound repair
(Mirza and Koh, 2011; Song et al., 2000; Willenborg et al., 2012). The spatial restriction of CD206
+ cells suggests unique interactions between macrophages and surrounding cells may drive differen-
ces in a pro-regenerative or pro-fibrotic environment.

 On the other hand, it is possible that the local environment (cells and/or ECM) in regenerating
systems drives immune cell profile instead of immune cells driving injury outcomes. We noted an
accumulation of M1 macrophages (CD86+ cells) in injured Mus tissue, and the ability of CD86+ cells
to interact with CD3+ T-cells is consistent with the role of CD86 as a co-stimulatory molecule that
promotes T-cell activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hathcock et al., 1994;
Lanier et al., 1995; Peng et al., 2013). Conversely, the Acomys blastema was mostly devoid of M1
macrophages and we did not observe CD86+/CD3+ interacting cells. This was not due to an inability
to detect M1 macrophages in Acomys, as we readily observed these cells at the boundary between
injured and uninjured tissue. Moreover, we found that Acomys macrophages up-regulated CD86 in
vitro when classically activated in response to IFNg and LPS stimulation (Ding et al., 1993;
Freedman et al., 1991). This shows that Acomys macrophages possess the intrinsic ability to
express M1 markers (e.g. CD86) in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, but may be inhibited from
doing so within the blastema in vivo.
A recent report suggested that spiny mice regenerate skin because they lack a robust inflamma-
tory response (Brant et al., 2016). While our findings contradict their primary conclusions, careful
re-interpretation of their data supports the idea that inflammation occurs during regeneration and
scarring, and that different inflammatory cell phenotypes polarize the response to injury. Brant et al.
based their conclusions on three primary findings. First, they presented circulating leukocyte profiles
showing spiny mice with lower neutrophils and higher lymphocytes in circulation when compared to
CD1 mice and suggested this would lead to fewer neutrophils in spiny mice wounds. As we have
shown, neutrophils indeed arrive at the wound bed and numbers are not significantly different three
days post injury. Interestingly, our data for myeloperoxidase activity suggests that differences in neu-
trophil activity, rather than simple numerical differences, likely play a more important role during the
injury response. Second, they were unable to detect macrophages in spiny mice wounds using F4/80
and concluded no macrophages infiltrated regenerating skin wounds. Using a cross-species marker
for total macrophages (IBA1), we show that macrophages indeed infiltrate an injury site. More
importantly, we demonstrate that macrophages are required for regeneration. Instead, differential
infiltration of macrophage subtypes exists between regeneration and scarring. While F4/80 may be a
pan-macrophage marker in mice, studies have shown that this is not the case for humans
(Hamann et al., 2007), and it remains unclear if this is the case for other mammals. Our data shows
that F4/80 marks a subset of macrophages with pro-inflammatory characteristics in Acomys (i.e. F4/
80+ cells are increased with M1 stimulation in vitro and F4/80+ cells do not colocalize with the M2
marker, CD206, in vivo). When re-interpreted with this knowledge, their results align with our find-
ings that reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory macrophages enter the wound site during regenera-
tion or are present, but not activated toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Thirdly, using a
cytokine array designed against mouse antigens they detected 30 cytokines during acute inflamma-
tion (D0-D7 post injury) in Mus, but only detected 12 of these cytokines in spiny mice during the
same period. They interpreted the absence of 18 cytokines as an absence of these signals in spiny
mice wounds. However, without validation of epitopes, failure to detect particular spiny mouse cyto-
kines on a Mus-specific cytokine array does not reflect an absence of spiny mouse antigen. More-
over, of the 12 spiny mouse cytokines they did detect, 5 are classic pro-inflammatory markers (e.g.
IL-1a, IL-1ß, IL-1ra, CXCL13 and IFNg) that were upregulated in response to injury and present at
similar levels to Mus. Thus, their spiny mouse cytokine data demonstrates strong acute inflammation
in response to injury. Although nuances between regenerating dorsal skin wounds and complex tis-
sue of the ear pinna are likely to exist, fine-tuning inflammatory responses is key to promoting scar-
free outcomes.
Of the mammalian models of epimorphic regeneration that exist, very few have investigated how
inflammatory cells affect blastema formation and regeneration. A forthcoming study on digit tip
regeneration lends support to our conclusion that macrophages are required to help initiate regen-
eration (Muneoka et al., 2017). Autoimmune-prone MRL mouse strains and their parent strain LgJ
have been promoted as a mammalian regeneration model (Clark et al., 1998). Paradoxically, while
these strains possess enhanced rates of healing, published reports across most injury models have
demonstrated that they do not regenerate (Colwell et al., 2006; Gawriluk et al., 2016;
Moseley et al., 2011; Smiley et al., 2014). Studies have documented that the healing response of
the MRL mouse differs depending upon the type of injury, be it the ear pinna or other tissues
(Beare et al., 2006; Colwell et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2007; Kench et al., 1999; Rajnoch et al.,

cartilage nodules (Clark et al., 1998), larger holes and a 2 mm crush injury heal with excessive colla-
gen deposition producing a scar (Gawriluk et al., 2016; Rajnoch et al., 2003). In our view, the use
of MRL strains as purported regeneration models has obscured their potential utility for studying
inflammation and fibrosis. Of interest, MRL mice have been extensively studied for their aberrant
macrophage profiles (Dang-Vu et al., 1987; Donnelly et al., 1990; Santoro et al., 1988). Bone mar-
row and peritoneal macrophages proliferate without CSF stimulation (Hamilton et al., 1998), a rare
observation among other strains of mice, and accumulation of macrophages is commonly observed
in MRL tissues (Bloom et al., 1993; Davis and Lennon, 2005; Yui et al., 1991). Macrophages in
strains of MRL mice show higher production of H2O2 suggesting higher pro-inflammatory activity
(Dang-Vu et al., 1987) and show increased expression of Tgfb1, a growth factor implicated during
increased fibrosis (reviewed in Border and Noble, 1994; Kench et al., 1999). Thus, MRL macro-
phages and their response to injury are unique in many respects. A detailed study of the immune
response in MRL mice could instruct how inflammation guides fibrotic repair based on intrinsic and
environmental tissue differences.
Macrophage phenotypes change based on environmental cues (Stout et al., 2005) and macro-
phages that infiltrate injured tissue exhibit temporal changes in gene and protein expression
(Arnold et al., 2007; Varga et al., 2016). In addition, cancer and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
can drive macrophage phenotypes dampening the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(reviewed in Gao et al., 2016). These observations underscore the fluid nature of macrophage phe-
notypes in response to injury and disease and support a model where different subtypes differen-
tially affect healing outcomes. Although further work is needed to clarify macrophage activation
phenotypes during regeneration, our results support the initial inflammatory environment as a
potential source of pro-regenerative signals. Future studies in spiny mice will need to determine how
specific immune cell types signal to local cells, whether macrophages induce change in the ECM and
if these cells can be manipulated in a non-regenerative system. Future studies into the role of spe-
cific macrophage and other immune cell phenotypes will resolve the role of these cells in scar forma-
tion and regeneration.
Materials and methods
Animal care, 4 mm ear punch and tissue collection
Acomys cahirinus and Mus musculus (Swiss Webster Envigro_Harlan Hsd:ND4) were housed at the
University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. A. cahirinus were housed at a density of 10–15 individuals in
metal wire cages (24 in. x 18 in. x 16 in., height x width x depth) (Quality Cage Company, Portland,
OR) and fed a 3:1 mixture by volume of 14% protein mouse chow (Teklad Global 2014, Harlan Labo-
ratories, Indianapolis, IN) and black-oil sunflower seeds (Pennington Seed Inc., Madison, GA) 1x/day
(Haughton et al., 2016). Mus were fed mouse chow only. Acomys and Mus mice were exposed to
natural light, and all animals used were sexually mature. Experiments used a combination of male
and female animals matched between species. For ear punch, animals were anesthetized with 3%
vaporized isoflurane (v/v) (Henry Schein Animal Health, Dublin, OH) at 1 psi oxygen flow rate. A 4
mm biopsy punch (Sklar Instruments, West Chester, PA) was used to create a through-and-through
hole in the center of the right and left ear pinna. Ear tissue was collected at specified time points
with an 8 mm biopsy punch (Sklar Instruments, West Chester, PA) circumscribing the original injury.
All animal procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol 2013–1119.
Flow cytometry
Healing ear tissue was harvested as outline above at D0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15. To create a single-cell
suspension, both ears were combined into one tube for each animal, and we used enzymatic and
mechanical digestion as previously described with modifications (Jensen et al., 2010). Briefly, tissue
was digested with a 1:1 trypsin, dispase solution for 1 hr at 37˚C allowing for subsequent mechanical
separation of the epidermis. Separated epidermis and dermis were incubated with a solution of col-
lagenase (1 mg/mL, VWR RLMB120-0100), hyaluronidase (0.5 mg/mL, VWR IC1512780), and elastase
(0.015 U/mL, VWR IB1753-MC) in HBSS (VWR 45000–456) for 1 hr at 37˚C. Following digestion, cell

 suspensions were washed with PBS and filtered through a 70 mm cell strainer. Single-cell suspensions
were incubated with an FcgR block (CD16/32 block, 20 mg/mL, BD Pharmingen Cat# 553141) fol-
lowed by incubation with directly conjugated primary antibodies at 4˚C for 1 hr. Antibodies included
APC-conjugated Ly6G (BD Pharmingen Cat# 580599, 3 mg/mL), PE-conjugated CD11b (BD Pharmin-
gen, Cat# 557397, 3 mg/mL), diluted in FBS-staining buffer (BD Pharmingen, Cat# 554656). Fluores-
cent-activated cell sorting (FACS) was carried out by trained experts in the University of Kentucky
Flow Cytometry Core using the iCyt Synergy sorter system (Sony Biotechnology Inc., San Jose, CA).
Laser calibration and compensation was performed for each experiment using unstained, single fluo-
rescent, and fluorescent minus one (FMO) control samples. Dot plots were created using FloJo (ver-
sion 10) (n = 4 animals per timepoint).
Analysis of circulating leukocytes
Blood was collected from the submandibular venous bed of age and gender matched Acomys
(n = 8) and Mus (n = 4). Individuals were anesthetized with 4% (v/v) isoflurane and gently scruffed so
that the skin covering the submandibular venous bed was taut. A 5 mm lancet (Medipont Inc., Mine-
ola, NY) was inserted quickly into the venous bed and one drop of blood was collected per slide,
with a total of 3 drops per animal. Slides were allowed to air dry and were prepared for a Sudan
Black B modified Giemsa-Wright staining as described by (Sheehan and Storey, 1947) using formal-
dehyde vapor fixation for 10 min. Slides were incubated for 1 hr in a filtered Sudan Black B (3 mg/
mL, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) disodium hydrogen phosphate solution. Slides were incubated
with Giemsa-Wright (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) stain followed by a 1 min wash in 0.5% acetic
acid. Slides were allowed to air dry and coverslipped with CytoSeal XYL. Images were collected on
an Olympus BX51 upright microscope at 40x magnification. Ten fields of view were acquired per
slide for an average 9224 total cells per animal and an average 42 total white blood cells per animal.
White blood cells were hand counted based on granular staining and nuclear morphology. Cell sub-
type is reported as a percent of total WBC per animal (n = 4 Mus, n = 8 Acomys).
Intra-vital ROS measurements
On the days indicated, animals with 4 mm wounds were anesthetized using 2.5% (v/v) isoflurane and
injected I.P. with lucigenin (5 mg/kg in PBS; M8010 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or luminol (100
mg/kg in PBS; A4685 Sigma-Aldrich). After approximately 10 min of incubation, the animals were
imaged with a chemiluminescent, in vivo imaging-system (IVIS 200 Spectrum; Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
MA). We determined that the peak activity occurs within 20 min post injection, and thus, measured
luminescence during the first 25 min post injection. We acquired 15 images with a 60 s exposure,
f-stop equal to 1, binning factor equal to 8, and a 21.6 cm field of view. To analyze the radiance
emitted from the wounds, a circular region of interest with a diameter of 6 mm was placed around
each ear wound and the total flux in the regions was measured. The maximum value for each wound
over the 15 images was used for subsequent analyses.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Harvested tissue was placed into 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (American Master Tech Scien-
tific Inc., Lodi, CA) and incubated at 4˚C overnight. Tissue was washed three times with PBS, three
times with 70% (v/v) ethanol and stored at 4˚C in 70% (v/v) ethanol. All tissue processings were com-
pleted using a rapid microwave histoprocessor (Micron Instruments, Inc. Carlsbad, CA). Tissues were
embedded in paraffin (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and 5-mm sections were placed onto
Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). Immunohistochemical and H & E staining were performed
on deparaffinized and rehydrated sections. Immunohistochemical staining for rabbit anti-human
MPO (Dako, Cat #A0398) was carried out as previously described (Gawriluk et al., 2016) using
heat-mediated antigen retrieval in a Tris-EDTA buffer at pH9.0. For, secondary detection of the pri-
mary antibody, we used biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody followed by HRP-conjugated
streptavidin for 3,3’-diaminobenzidine conversion according to Vector Elite ABC staining kit (Vector,
Burlingame, CA). Nuclei were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin for brightfield visualization
and coverslips mounted with Cytoseal XYL (ThermoFischer, Waltham, MA).
Immunofluorescent staining was performed on flash frozen tissue collected in Tissue-Tek OCT
(Sakura, Torrance, CA) and frozen on dry ice. 8 mm sections were collected on a Leica CM1900

 cryostat at 20˚C. Tissue was subsequently fixed to slides with ice-cold acetone for 15 min and
washed in PBS. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies overnight: rat anti-mouse CD86

(Wako, Cat #019–19741). Secondary detection of antibodies was carried out using donkey antibod-
ies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 594 (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) Nuclei were counterstained
with 10 mg/ml DAPI and coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold mounting medium (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA) for fluorescence.
To quantify the total area of positive signal for fluorescent images, three photomicrographs within
the center of the injury were obtained at 40x magnification using an Olympus BX53 fluorescent
deconvolution microscope (Olympus America Inc). Quantification of positive signal was performed
on four separate samples (one ear per animal) per time point (unless otherwise noted) by threshold-
ing fluorescent signal and mask subsampling with Metamorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). The ratio of total immuno-positive area per total area of the region of interest was
then calculated. To quantify total number of DAB-positive cells, two photomicrographs within the
center of the injury were obtained at 20x magnification using an Olympus BX53 microscope. Counts
were calculated using the Cell Counter plugin for ImageJ (version 1.51d). Cells included in counts
were based on both nuclear morphology and immuno-positive staining. Total positive cells were
reported as a percent of total area (pixels) in a region of interest that excluded scab, epidermis, and
cartilage plate. The ID of the samples being run was blinded from the user until the end of the
analysis.
In vitro macrophage analysis
Macrophage progenitors were isolated from femur and tibia of Acomys and Mus. After sacrifice,
femur and tibia were surgically removed, and mechanically cleared of all skin, muscle and tendon.
Marrow was aspirated from bones by flushing the marrow with 10 mL of RPMI +10% FBS through a
28 gauge syringe. Red blood cells were lysed with a hypotonic solution and remaining cells were
plated at a density of 1 � 106 cells/mL in T-75 culture flasks. For the first 7 days, bone marrow cells
were grown in complete RPMI media supplemented with 20% L929 media containing M-CSF, 10%
FBS, 1% PenStrep. After 7 days in culture, BMDM were split using cold PBS and a cell scraper,
plated onto coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 5 � 105 cells/mL and allowed to settle for 24
hr in complete RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PenStrep. For macrophage activa-
tion, cells were stimulated with either 500 mL of IFNg (20 pg/mL) and LPS (200 ng/mL) in cRPMI
media 10% FBS or 500 uL of IL-4 (20 ng/mL) in cRPMI media 10% FBS. 24 hr after activation, media
was removed, cells washed once with cold PBS and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10
min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS to remove excess formalin, cells were per-
meabilized with 1% Triton x100 in PBS for 10 min. Immunocytochemistry was performed by first
blocking non-specific binding sites using 5% goat serum in PBS block. Cells were washed once with
PBS and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4˚C. Primary antibodies include rabbit anti
mouse Arginase 1 (1:500 GeneTex, Cat #113131), goat anti mouse CD206 (1:1000, R and D Systems,
Cat #AF2535), rat anti-mouse CD86 (1:100, BD Biosciences, Cat #553689), rat anti-mouse Cd11b
(1:500, Abd Serotec, Cat #MCA74G), rabbit anti-mouse IBA1 (1:1000, Wako, Cat #019–19741), rat
anti-mouse F4/80 (1:400, clone BM8, eBiosciences, Cat #14-4801-82). Detection of primary antibod-
ies was accomplished by incubating cells with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor fluoro-
phores (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as follows: Donkey anti-Goat AF546, Goat anti-Chicken
AF488, Donkey anti-Rat 488, and Donkey anti-Rabbit 546. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
and after air-drying, coverslips were mounted to slides using ImmunoMount (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA).
Clodronate-liposome injections
Following previously reported protocols (Barrera et al., 2000; Li et al., 2013; van Rooijen and Hen-
drikx, 2010), we inject 20 mL of 50 mg/mL clodronate liposomes- or PBS liposomes (www.clodro-
nate-liposomes.org, (van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010)) as vehicle control. Injections were
performed using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno Nevada) at the base of each ear at
D0, 2 and 5 after injury. Tissue was collected at D5 (n = 3 Acomys/treatment) and D20 (n = 4

 Acomys/treatment) for immunohistochemical and histological examination. Ear hole closure was
measured over time using a digital micrometer (n = 6 Acomys, 12 ears per treatment).
Statistics
For analyzing immuno-positive cells, observations within the same mouse were averaged so analysis
could be on the level of the experimental unit. For each marker, we analyzed the percentage of
immune-positive signal as a fraction of total DAPI positive area using a two-way ANOVA with spe-
cies, day and the species*day interaction). When noted, Sidak’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison tests
were conducted where appropriate using Prism 6 Data analysis software (Graphpad Software Inc, La
Jolla, CA). Sample size was determined by calculating power from previous immunohistochemical
studies. These calculations show with appropriate transformation of percentages and a standard
deviation of 0.07, groups of n = 4 animals should be sufficient to detect a species effect with a size
of 0.16395 with 80% power and alpha = 0.05. To calculate sample size for repeated measures, we
used previous wounding studies to determine maximum standard deviation of 2.21. These tests
show groups of n = 5 animals, 10 ears should be sufficient to detect a treatment effect of 2.77 with
80% power and alpha = 0.05. To analyze the chemiluminescent data, we performed a repeated-mea-
sure, two-way ANOVA with time and species as main effects and Sidak’s post-hoc tests to compare
the species x time effect. Graphs were created using Prism and annotated in Illustrator (Adobe Crea-
tive Suite 6, San Jose, CA). Graphs display standard error of mean (S.E.M.) with statistical signifi-
cance values indicated in figure legends. Sample size (n) is stated in each figure legend and refers to
biological replication size (n = number of distinct animals) with the exception of in vitro studies in
which n = number of technical replicates for BMDM activation.
