Focus on Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health
ABSTRACT
Objective: Age-appropriate criteria for 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in young 
children have been established. The present study 
investigated the long-term course of such PTSD and 
its predictors in young children.
Methods: Young children (aged 2–10 years) and 
parents/caregivers who had attended emergency 
departments after motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) 
between May 2004 and November 2005 were 
assessed at 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months post-MVC; 
71 families were re-interviewed 3 years post-MVC. 
Participants were assessed according to standard 
DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and a well-validated 
alternative algorithm for diagnosing PTSD in 
young children (PTSD-AA). Demographic, trauma-
related, and parental mental health variables and 
intellectual ability were also assessed at baseline.
Results: Using an “optimal-report” procedure (a 
positive diagnosis according to parent or child for 
older children, or just parent for younger children), 
7.0% met criteria for DSM-IV PTSD and 16.9% for 
PTSD-AA at 3 years. Using parent report alone, 
these rates were 1.4% and 2.8%, respectively. 
Parent-child agreement for PTSD and PTSD-AA 
was no better than chance (Cohen κ = –0.03 and 
–0.04, respectively). Baseline parent posttraumatic 
stress relating to the child’s trauma, and not 
trauma severity, was correlated with optimal-
report child PTSD-AA at each assessment (r values 
= 0.29–0.31) and accounted for unique variance in 
logistic regression models of this outcome at each 
assessment.
Conclusions: PTSD-AA in young children can persist 
for years but is underrecognized by parents despite 
its being shaped to a large extent by parents’ own 
acute traumatic stress in response to the child’s 
trauma.

P
osttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common debilitating 
disorder in youth.1 Until recently, the reactions of preschool and 
young children to trauma have received little attention.2 The past decade 
has witnessed far greater coverage of the reactions of young children 
to traumatic stressors,3 a step change facilitated by the proposal of age-
appropriate criteria for diagnosing PTSD. These criteria make allowances 
for the developmental limitations when assessing symptoms in this age 
group and the need to rely on parental/caregiver reporting.4 Amending 
the number of avoidance symptoms required (from 3 to 1) and dropping 
the requirement that a peritraumatic affective response be observed yield 
a far greater proportion who meet the threshold for “caseness” in young 
children.5,6 Multiple studies have attested to the construct and predictive 
validity7,8 of this age-appropriate alternative algorithm for diagnosing 
PTSD in young children (hereafter PTSD-AA), and minor amendments 
to the original PTSD-AA criteria led to the introduction of a preschool 
PTSD diagnosis within the DSM-5.9 Neither PTSD-AA nor the DSM-5 
preschool PTSD diagnosis requires a peritraumatic affective response, but 
both require 1 re-experiencing symptom, 1 avoidance symptom, and 2 
hyperarousal symptoms, where clinically significant distress or impairment 
in relationships is present.
With the establishment of a reliable and valid diagnostic algorithm in 
younger children, it has been possible to turn to researching the prevalence, 
course, etiology, and treatment of PTSD in this age group. Previously, we 
examined the reactions of 2- to 10-year-old children exposed to MVCs and 
explored the course of DSM-IV–defined PTSD and PTSD-AA from the acute 
posttrauma phase (ie, the first 4 weeks) to a 6-month follow-up assessment.7 
Although the subsequent preschool PTSD criteria within DSM-5 specify an 
age range up to 6 years, at the time of this initial study, it was important to 
examine the boundary conditions of the original PTSD-AA diagnosis up to 
the age of 10 years.4 The present study presents data from a 3-year follow-up 
of this cohort, allowing consideration of several pertinent questions relating 
to younger children’s responses to trauma.
First, the longer-term course of posttraumatic stress reactions in early 
childhood needs to be established. Adults report significant psychopathology 
related to traumatic experiences in early childhood10; however, many of 
these studies are based on retrospective accounts of multiple and repeated 
trauma exposure (eg, abuse) in childhood typically accompanied by other 
adversities (eg, neglect, parental mental illness). Long-term follow-up 
studies of single traumas have addressed older children and adolescents 
and have found that PTSD may persist for years in a substantial minority.11
Second, it is important to consider the validity of parental reports of their 
child’s dysfunction. Reliance on parent reporting introduces tremendous 
scope for bias in terms of under- and overreporting of symptomatology.
Third, early diagnostic markers for predicting a long-term, suboptimal 
response to traumatic stressors can be identified. Unique to this study is the 
ability to consider acute stress disorder (ASD), an early diagnostic marker 
found to have utility in adults and older youth.12,13

Meiser-Stedman et al
Finally, it is essential to identify early demographic, trauma 
severity, and familial predictors of PTSD/PTSD-AA. These 
data would inform the early clinical management of PTSD 
and theoretical models of dysfunction in this age group.3 A 
recent review2 suggested that there have been inconsistent 
results observed for the relationship between demographic 
variables (ie, age, sex) and PTSD in preschool and young 
children but more substantive evidence for trauma severity 
and parent mental health as risk factors for PTSD. Apart 
from a study14 that tracked preschoolers’ PTSD symptoms 
in response to a missile attack, most research has been cross-
sectional and has commonly addressed children exposed to 
interpersonal or domestic violence.2
This study therefore addressed the following research 
questions:
1. What is the prevalence of PTSD/PTSD-AA in children 
3 years after an MVC, and to what extent is this affected 
by age at the time of the trauma?
2. To what extent do children and their parents or caregivers 
(hereafter just “parents”) agree in their assessment of the 
child’s PTSD/PTSD-AA?
3. How well does ASD function as a predictor of PTSD/
PTSD-AA at this 3-year follow-up?
4. Which (if any) demographic, trauma severity, parental 
mental health, and intellectual variables predict PTSD/
PTSD-AA at each time point?
METHODS
Participants
Participants were from a previously reported prospective 
study7 of young children aged 2–10 years at the time of study 
entry who attended an emergency department in South 
London between May 2004 and November 2005 following 
an MVC. Exclusion criteria were the presence of moderate-
to-severe intellectual disabilities or moderate-to-severe 
traumatic brain injury. Of 114 child-parent dyads recruited 
for the initial 2- to 4-week posttrauma assessment (T1), 109 
(95.6%) completed a 6-month follow-up assessment (T2). 
At T2, permission was sought to recontact families for a 
potential 3-year posttrauma assessment (T3); all families 
gave consent to being recontacted.
Of the families who completed T1 and T2 assessments 
(n = 109), 33 (30.3%) could not be contacted again and 5 
(4.6%) were no longer willing to participate. One parent did 
not complete the interviews at the T1 and T2 assessments, 
although their child did complete these interviews; only 
the child’s data were included in the analyses presented 
here. Parents of 71 children (62.2% of T1 sample, 65.1% of 
T2 sample) consented to the T3 interview. Interviews were 
conducted with the child’s mother (n = 64), father (n = 2), 
grandmother (n = 2), uncle (n = 2), or aunt (n = 1). In 53 
cases, the children themselves (if 7 years or older) completed 
a structured interview for PTSD. The 18 children who did not 
complete the T3 interview assessment themselves were still 
under 7 years of age (n = 12), not allowed by their parents to 
do the interview (n = 3), unwilling to participate (n = 2), or 
withdrew during the interview (n = 1).
The final T3 sample (age at MVC, mean = 6.5 years, 
SD = 2.8; age at T3, mean = 10.3 years, SD = 2.9), were assessed 
on average 3.8 years (SD = 0.4) post-MVC. Thirty-four 
(47.9%) were female, and 42 (59.2%) belonged to a minority 
ethnic group. Twenty-seven (38.0%) were pedestrians, 36 
(50.7%) car passengers, 4 (5.6%) cyclists (who collided 
with a motor vehicle), and 4 (5.6%) bus passengers. Twenty 
participants (28.2%) had no injuries, 46 (64.8%) had only soft 
tissue injuries, and 5 (7.0%) had sustained a fracture. Four 
participants (5.6%) had lost consciousness, and 11 (15.5%) 
were admitted to the hospital. There were no significant 
differences between participants at T3 and those who 
participated only at the T1 and T2 assessments with respect to 
age, sex, ethnicity, MVC type, triage category, degree of injury, 
loss of consciousness, or hospital admission (all P values 
> .18). Furthermore, there were no differences in T2 parent- 
or child-reported PTSD symptom counts between those 
families that completed the T3 assessment and those that did 
not (t106 = 0.36, P = .7 and t42 = 0.87, P = .4, respectively).
Measures
Demographic and trauma-related variables. These data 
were gathered from the hospital emergency department 
records or parent interviews at T1. The presence of pre-
MVC emotional or behavioral disorders was established in 
an interview with parents (endorsed by parents as present 
or absent).
Child posttraumatic stress disorder. The study outcome 
measures were structured interviews of child PTSD/
PTSD-AA completed by parents and children 7 years or 
older. In addition to reporting parent- and child-report data, 
“combined-report” diagnoses (ie, from both parent and child 
responses, where both were available) and “optimal-report” 
diagnoses (based on the maximal information available, ie, 
parent-only responses for children under age 7 or combined 
report for children 7 years or older) are presented. This is 
consistent with practice parameter recommendations that 
data from multiple informants be routinely obtained and 
their utility maximized.15 While the use of the optimal-
report diagnosis increases the available sample size, the use 
of different assessment strategies in each age group may be 
viewed as methodologically problematic. To be transparent, 
the data for combined-report PTSD (ie, for children 7 years 
or older) are therefore also reported.
The PTSD Semi-Structured Interview and Observational 
Record for Infants and Young Children (IORYC)4,6 was used 
Clinical Points
 
■ There are limited data concerning the long-term course 
and etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 
preschool and young children.
 
■ Using age-appropriate diagnostic criteria, the study found 
that PTSD persists in a minority of young children exposed 
to single-event traumatic stressors.
 
■ Parental acute posttraumatic stress is a risk factor for acute 
and chronic child PTSD in young children.

to assess parent-report PTSD/PTSD-AA at each assessment 
point. The IORYC can yield a DSM-IV PTSD as well as 
PTSD-AA diagnosis. The IORYC possesses good interrater 
reliability4,5 and construct validity.7
At T1 and T2, child-report PTSD/PTSD-AA were assessed 
(for those 7 years or older) using the Clinician Administered 
PTSD Scale–Child and Adolescent Version (CAPS-CA).16 
The CAPS-CA is a child-report structured interview 
for assessing PTSD that possesses good psychometric 
properties.17 For children 7 years or older at T3, child-report 
PTSD/PTSD-AA were assessed using the PTSD Schedule of 
the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Child 
and Parent Schedule (ADIS-C/P).18 The ADIS-C/P can be 
used to derive a PTSD-AA diagnosis (as PTSD-AA criteria 
are a subset of DSM-IV criteria). The ADIS-C/P was selected 
for use at T3 given its suitability for telephone administration.
Continuous measures of PTSD severity were derived by 
counting endorsed symptoms; these data are reported in 
supplementary analyses (see Supplementary eTables 1–6 at 
PSYCHIATRIST.COM).
Parental mental health. Parental posttraumatic stress 
symptomatology at T1 relating to the child’s MVC was 
indexed using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale.19 Parental 
depressive symptomatology at T1 was assessed using the 
Depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale.20
Child intellectual performance. To investigate whether 
posttraumatic stress was related to intellectual functioning, 
the British Picture Vocabulary Scale, second edition, a 
standardized test of receptive vocabulary,21 was administered 
at T1.
Procedure
The T3 assessment was approved by Bexley and Greenwich 
Research Ethics Committee (08/H0809/18). To facilitate 
participation in the T3 assessment, telephone interviewing 
was used.
RESULTS
Prevalence of PTSD at 3-Year Follow-Up (T3)
The prevalence of PTSD-AA and PTSD diagnoses at 
T3, differentiated by age group at MVC and informant, is 
displayed in Table 1. Parent-report diagnoses were reported 
in only 1 or 2 cases. Child- and combined-report or optimal-
report diagnoses were much more frequently endorsed 
(ranging from 7.0%–20.8%).
In the case of child- and combined-report diagnoses 
(Table 1), these rates were reduced relative to T1 and T2. 
The proportion of cases at T3 meeting criteria for PTSD-AA 
or PTSD based on an optimal-report procedure also show 
improvement relative to earlier assessments (not previously 
reported; PTSD-AA prevalence was 28/113 [24.8%] at T1 and 
24/108 [22.2%] at T2; ASD prevalence was 14/113 [12.4%] 
cases at T1 and PTSD prevalence was 9/107 [8.4%] cases at 
T2). PTSD-AA, regardless of informant, was observed at a 
rate more than twice as great as that observed for standard 
PTSD criteria, as found previously.7
To investigate whether being a preschool-aged child 
at the MVC influenced the risk of developing PTSD/
PTSD-AA at T3, age-related comparisons were made. No 
age-group–related differences were observed, ie, children 
not old enough to self-report PTSD symptoms at T1/T2 
(ie, 2–6 years old) were as likely to meet criteria for PTSD/
PTSD-AA (regardless of informant) at T3 as those children 
who had provided self-report at T1/T2 (ie, 7–10 years old; 
Fisher exact test, P values > .3); moreover, there were no 
differences in mean child-reported symptoms at T3 between 
children aged 2–6 years and children aged 7–10 years at T1 
(t51 = 0.17, NS).

Meiser-Stedman et al
Since PTSD-AA can be diagnosed on the basis of fewer 
symptoms than PTSD, the increased prevalence of PTSD-AA 
may not be related to its developmental appropriateness 
but to its reduced symptom requirement. We therefore 
examined the mean number of symptoms for positive cases 
of each diagnosis at T3. There were no significant differences 
in symptom counts (although PTSD symptom counts were 
numerically higher) for diagnoses based on child report, 
combined parent-child report, or optimal report (all t values 
< 1.92, NS); parent-report comparison was not possible as 
only 1 child met criteria for parent-report PTSD. Moreover, 
with respect to child-report impairment severity, there were 
no differences between child-report PTSD and PTSD-AA 
cases (t = 0.3, P > .6), or between optimal- or combined-
report PTSD and PTSD-AA (optimal and combined report, 
t = 0.3, P > .6).
Parent-Child Agreement at T3
Parent-child agreement (Cohen κ) for the 53 children 
where data from both informants were available for PTSD 
was –0.03 and for PTSD-AA was –0.04—no better than 
chance. These figures did not differ even when restricting 
the calculations to older children who had been able to 
provide self-report at earlier assessments (–0.06 and –0.05, 
respectively; n = 27).
The Utility of Baseline (T1) PTSD Diagnoses  
in Predicting PTSD at 3-Year Follow-Up (T3)
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value 
(proportion diagnosed at T1 who retained the diagnosis 
at T3), and negative predictive value (proportion with no 
diagnosis at T1 who remained diagnosis-free at T3) for 
each diagnosis and informant are reported in Table 2. The 
strong relationship between parent-reported T1 ASD and 
T3 PTSD is most likely a statistical 
artifact caused by the low numbers 
of positive cases for parent report. 
The ability of T1 diagnoses to predict 
PTSD or PTSD-AA at 3 years (T3) was 
weak. For diagnoses that involved child 
report (child-alone, combined report, 
or optimal report), prediction statistics 
for T3 PTSD-AA were generally 
superior to those for T3 PTSD, 
notably when considering sensitivity 
and positive predictive values. The 
addition of parent report within 
combined-report diagnosis did not 
improve predictive ability above that of 
child report alone; indeed, specificity 
statistics for T3 PTSD-AA appeared to 
be weakened. Parent-report diagnoses 
(T1 ASD or PTSD-AA) were very 
insensitive predictors of corresponding 
child-report diagnoses at T3.
Of 11 cases who met criteria for 
combined-report PTSD-AA diagnosis 
at T3, only 4 had PTSD-AA at T1 based on parent report; 
likewise, for the 12 cases meeting criteria for PTSD-AA at T3 
based on optimal report, only 4 had PTSD-AA at T1 based 
on parent report.
Correlates and Predictors of  
Optimal-Report PTSD-AA at Each Assessment
As the optimal-report PTSD-AA diagnosis is most closely 
aligned with best diagnostic practice of utilizing multiple 
informants,15 this diagnosis was the dependent variable for 
correlational analyses (see Table 3) and regression modeling 
addressing possible risk factors for posttraumatic stress 
symptomatology (PTSS). Logistic regression was used to 
explore which variables accounted for unique variance 
in optimal-report PTSD-AA. Only significant zero-order 
correlates were included in these models; a forward conditional 
method of entry was used. For optimal-report PTSD-AA at 
T1, age, sex, persistent injury, and concurrent parental PTSS 
scores accounted for unique variance (χ24 = 41.25, P < .0001; 
Nagelkerke R2 = 0.53). Ethnicity, parental presence during the 
collision, and parental depression at T1 were not retained 
in the model. For optimal-report diagnoses at the 6-month 
assessment (T2), T1 persistent injury and T1 parental PTSS 
were retained in the model (χ22 = 21.91, P < .0001; Nagelkerke 
R2 = 0.41), but not age, ethnicity, intellectual performance, 
triage, fracture, admission, or post-MVC separation greater 
than 1 hour. For optimal-report diagnoses at the 3-year 
assessment (T3), T1 parental PTSS was retained in the model 
(χ21 = 6.30, P < .012; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.16), but not post-
MVC separation greater than 1 hour or parental depression. 
Parental PTSS at baseline was therefore the only variable to 
account for unique variance at each assessment point.
When initial optimal-report diagnosis at T1 was also 
entered in the first step of the model for T2, only persistent

injury was retained in the model, with optimal-report diagnosis 
at T1 also accounting for unique variance (χ23 = 26.11, 
P < .0001; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.47). When initial optimal-report

T1 optimal-report diagnosis not accounting for significant 
unique variance (χ23 = 12.29, P < .007; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.30).
To allow closer investigation of predictive data, parent-

DISCUSSION
This study addressed the assessment, prevalence, course, 
and risk factors for DSM-IV PTSD and PTSD-AA in young 
children exposed to an MVC 3 years earlier. With respect 
to our first question (ie, the prevalence of PTSD at 3 years 
post-MVC), child- and combined-report data suggested that 
a significant minority continues to present with clinically 
significant PTSS, even at this long-term follow-up assessment. 
Reliance on parent report alone, however, yielded very few 
cases, regardless of diagnostic algorithm. The 
use of PTSD-AA at T3 doubled the prevalence 
of disorder (whether based on child report, 
combined report, or optimal report) relative 
to PTSD at T3, consistent with data from T1 
and T2 assessments.7 The discrepancy between 
parent and child report was further borne out 
when addressing our second question (ie, the 
extent that children and their parents agree in 
their assessment), where parent-child agreement 
at T3 was no better than chance at the level of 
diagnosis.
With respect to our third question (ie, the 
ability of T1 diagnoses to predict T3 diagnoses), 
T1 PTSD-AA was more powerful at predicting 
the same diagnosis at T3 than T1 ASD at 
predicting PTSD at T3. Nevertheless, there 
seemed to be considerable natural recovery 
for PTSD-AA, as well as instances where 
children had PTSD at T3 (according to either 
diagnostic algorithm) but were not recognized 
as such during the T1 assessment. Parent report 
was either a weak predictor of diagnosis at T3 
follow-up or did not add to child report alone.
In addressing our fourth question (ie, risk 
factors for PTSD), parents’ own PTSS at study 
entry (T1) accounted for unique variance in 
optimal-report PTSD-AA at each assessment. 
Persistent injury at T1 accounted for unique 
variance in models of PTSD-AA at T1 and T2 
(consistent with other studies2 showing a link 
between trauma severity and PTSD) but not 
at T3, while female sex and age were only risk 
factors (ie, accounted for unique variance) for PTSD-AA at 
T1. Intelligence was mostly not significantly related to PTSD.
These findings emphasize the importance of considering 
young children’s long-term responses to traumatic stressors. 
As with earlier findings6,14 young children may develop 
clinically significant PTSS that persists for years and that 
in many instances may not be recognized by their parents. 
The number of participants reporting PTSD-AA 3 years 
later that had not been recognized by parents at an earlier 
assessment suggests that, even with the accommodations 
made for diagnosing PTSD in this age group, the reliance 
on parent report may be inadequate for identifying PTSD 
in some young children. Preschoolers were as likely as 
elementary-school–aged children to meet criteria for PTSD 
at T3. These findings also emphasize the importance of using 
a developmentally appropriate tool for diagnosing PTSD in 
children (eg, DSM-5 preschool child PTSD); the use of the 
PTSD-AA diagnosis more than doubled the number of cases 
identified by the DSM-IV PTSD diagnosis alone.
The present study adds to earlier work in this area by 
relating chronic reactions to acute responses, in terms of both 
children’s own acute reactions and their parent’s reactions. 
With respect to the early identification of children at risk of 
a chronic reaction to a traumatic stressor, diagnostic tools

Meiser-Stedman et al
(particularly child-report PTSD-AA) have some predictive 
ability. However, the utility of such constructs should not be 
overstated; there is considerable natural recovery over time, 
as well as some cases who met diagnostic threshold at a 3-year 
follow-up (T3) but who did not do so at previous assessments.
The current study strengthens the case for considering 
parental mental health in the aftermath of trauma, with 
parental acute PTSS at study entry consistently predicting 
their child’s PTSS, even 3 years posttrauma; strikingly, this 
was despite parents being very unlikely to acknowledge 
clinically significant PTSS in their child at this assessment. 
The direction of this effect is unclear. Parents’ own initial 
T1 PTSS could have been worsened by their children’s T1 
symptoms, children’s responses across time points could have 
been shaped by their parents’ initial reactions (eg, modeling 
avoidance), or a bidirectional effect may have resulted in a 
mutual amplification of symptomatology.22
The importance of familial factors in driving PTSD in this 
group was further underscored by the significant relationship 
between separation from parent during the trauma and PTSD 
in the first weeks following the trauma. The role of families in 
the development of chronic responses to traumatic stressors 
in young children still warrants further research, but these 
data speak to the need to consider trauma-exposed parent-
child dyads from the outset, rather than young children in 
isolation. Providing support for parents in the aftermath of 
trauma (eg, with psychoeducation about their own, as well 
as their child’s, posttraumatic stress) is therefore indicated. 
With respect to other risk factors, the relationship between 
trauma severity indices and PTSD-AA was mainly limited to 
the 6-month follow-up, but is supportive of a dose-response 
relationship for trauma exposure and PTSD risk in young 
children.
The study has several limitations. In particular, it suffers 
from a relatively small sample size. Given the number of 
analyses undertaken (even if many were only exploratory), 
the chance that a type I error could occur was increased. 
Moreover, the power of the regression models was modest; 
larger samples may have revealed more predictor variables.
In conclusion, this study suggests that a significant 
minority of young children exposed to single-event trauma 
may develop PTSD/PTSD-AA that persists for years. While 
parents’ own PTSS in the acute phase may contribute to 
persistent PTSD in young children, the present study also 
suggests that parents may fail to observe persistent PTSD in 
their children when the trauma occurs in early childhood.

Note. Only significant correlates were entered into the models presented here. Variables were entered using a 
stepwise method of entry. T1 = 2-4 weeks posttrauma; T2 = six months posttrauma; T3 = three years posttrauma; 
PDS = Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (parent PTSD). 
a Beta coefficients presented here are those values for the final regression model in each case. 
b In this model, parent-report PTSD symptoms at Time 1 were also entered.  
c Initial inspection of residuals plots suggested that there was some evidence of non-normality in the plot for the 
Time 3 assessment data. The modelling was therefore undertaken using a dependent variable that had been 
transformed (using natural logarithms); subsequent residual plots showed that the assumptions of regression were 
now met.

b Initially, no variables significantly contributed to a model of child-report PTSD symptoms at T2; it was only when 
T1 child-report symptoms were entered that the model became significant. 
c Initial inspection of residuals plots suggested that there was some evidence of non-normality in the plot for the 
Time 3 assessment data. The modelling was therefore undertaken using a dependent variable that had been
