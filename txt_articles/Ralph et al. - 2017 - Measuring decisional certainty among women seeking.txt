STRUCTURED ABSTRACT 
Objective
Evaluating decisional certainty is an important component of medical care, including pre-abortion care. 
However, minimal research has examined how to measure certainty with reliability and validity among 
women seeking abortion. We examine whether the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a measure widely 
used in other health specialties and considered the gold standard for measuring this construct, and the 
Taft-Baker Scale (TBS), a measure developed by abortion counselors, are valid and reliable for use with 
women seeking abortion and predict the decision to continue the pregnancy.  
Methods
Eligible women at four family planning facilities in Utah completed baseline demographic surveys and 
scales before their abortion information visit and follow-up interviews three weeks later. For each scale, 
we calculated mean scores and explored factors associated with high uncertainty.  We evaluated internal 
reliability using Cronbach’s alpha and assessed predictive validity by examining whether higher scale 
scores, indicative of decisional uncertainty or conflict, were associated with still being pregnant at follow-
up. 
Results
Five hundred women completed baseline surveys; two-thirds (63%) completed follow-up, at which time 
11% were still pregnant. Mean scores on the DCS (15.5/100) and TBS (12.4/100) indicated low 
uncertainty, with acceptable reliability (α=0.93 and 0.72, respectively). Higher scores on each scale were 
significantly and positively associated with still being pregnant at follow-up in both unadjusted and 
adjusted analyses.

Conclusion
The DCS and TBS demonstrate acceptable reliability and validity among women seeking abortion care. 
Comparing scores on the DCS in this population to other studies of decision-making suggests that the 
level of uncertainty in abortion decision-making is comparable to or lower than other health decisions. 
Implications
The high levels of decisional certainty found in this study challenge the narrative that abortion decision 
making is exceptional compared to other healthcare decisions and requires additional protection such as
laws mandating waiting periods, counseling, and ultrasound viewing.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Decisional conflict is defined as a state of uncertainty about a course of action when the choices involve 
risk, loss, regret, or a challenge to personal values [1]. Assessing and responding to decisional conflict—
and its corollary, decisional certainty—is routine in health care, particularly in fields such as obstetrics 
and oncology where decisions often require balancing complex benefits and risks which are sensitive to 
patients’ preferences and values [2-6].  
Evaluating how certain a woman is about her decision to obtain an abortion is also an important 
component of abortion care [7]. However, unlike other health care decisions, many states enforce laws 
whose stated purpose is to protect women seeking abortion from making an unconsidered decision [8, 
9]. Implicit in these laws is that women experience more conflict about abortion than other healthcare 
decisions and require additional time or information beyond that typically offered as part of abortion 
providers’ existing informed consent and counseling practices. 
Previous research suggests that the majority of women are certain of their abortion decision when they 
present for care [10-14]. However, minimal research has examined how to effectively measure certainty 
among women seeking abortion, or how women’s certainty about abortion compares to other health 
decisions. Here, we measure and explore factors associated with decisional certainty among women 
seeking abortion using both a validated scale used in other health specialties [15] and a scale developed 
using questions authored by abortion counselors [16]. We assess each scale’s psychometric performance
in a sample of women seeking abortion in Utah, some of whom decide to continue the pregnancy. 
Findings may aid providers in their pre-abortion counseling efforts [7] and can be useful in understanding
the magnitude of decisional uncertainty among women seeking abortion as compared to other health 
decisions.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 Sample and study procedures
This study was conducted with English- and Spanish-speaking women ages 15 and older seeking abortion
care at four family planning clinics in Utah between October 2013 and April 2014. Adults provided 
informed consent; minors aged 15 to 17 could participate with parental consent and their own assent. 
Detailed methods have been described elsewhere[17] . In brief, eligible women were asked to complete 
a baseline survey on an iPad prior to an abortion information visit and a follow up interview by phone 
with University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) interviewers three weeks later. Utah requires women 
seeking an abortion to complete a face-to-face information visit with their provider at least 72 hours 
before receiving an abortion. During this visit, the provider must read a state-mandated, standardized 
information script. Clinics in this study also provided pre-abortion counseling during this visit. Thus, all 
women recruited into the study were presenting for the first of two clinic visits, and would have to 
return at least 72 hours later for an abortion. Returning for this follow up visit was not a criterion for 
inclusion in the study. At the time that they completed the baseline survey, women had not yet had any 
interaction with a health care provider or counselor at the study clinic. The main goal of the overall study
was to examine women's reasons for not having an abortion under the 72-hour waiting period and two-
visit requirement[17]; thus, we aimed to recruit at least 75 women who completed an abortion 
information visit but did not return for an abortion. Previous research in a state without a two visit or 
waiting period requirement found that 7% of women seek but do not obtain an abortion [14]. Prior to 
the current study, clinic sources estimated that this figure was higher in Utah; thus, we conservatively 
assumed that 20% would not return for care and 25% would be lost to follow up, requiring an initial 
sample of 500 women.

Participants were remunerated with $10 for the baseline survey and $20 for the follow up phone 
interview. All research activities were approved by UCSF’s Committee on Human Research. 
2.2 Measures 
The baseline survey assessed women’s age, race, employment, educational attainment and education in 
progress, religious affiliation, and receipt of public assistance. It also included questions about lifetime 
mental health diagnoses and past year substance use. Women were asked about their relationship status
with the man involved in the pregnancy and his awareness of and support for the abortion, as well as 
who they had talked to about their abortion decision. To capture levels of misperceptions about 
abortion, women were presented with a series of statements summarizing common abortion myths 
derived from previous research [18-20] and asked which statement was closer to the truth (e.g., 
“abortion causes breast cancer” versus “abortion does NOT cause breast cancer,” see Table 1 for all 
myths presented). Women who incorrectly identified the myth as closer to the truth, or responded 
“Don’t know,” were categorized as endorsing that myth. For most women, gestational age at discovery of
pregnancy was calculated using the time elapsed between self-reported date of last menstrual period 
and date they discovered pregnancy. For a minority of women who could not recall these dates, women 
were asked about how many weeks or months ago these events occurred.  
The baseline survey included two scales designed to measure decisional certainty. The Decisional 
Conflict Scale (DCS) is a validated scale used to assess individuals’ perceptions of uncertainty in the 
context of healthcare decisions and to identify modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty [15]. It 
includes 16 items that can be scored in aggregate or as five subscales (Uncertainty, Informed, Values 
Clarity, Support, and Effective Decision). Women were asked their level of agreement (ranging from 
Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) for all items (see Figure 1a). One previous cross-sectional study used

this scale to assess decisional certainty among women who had an abortion in Portugal, and found low 
conflict post-abortion [21].  
The second, 4-item scale is from a needs assessment form found in a widely disseminated textbook on 
abortion care [16]. The original form contains 16 items developed by abortion counselors and designed 
to be self-administered to aid providers in pre-abortion counseling. Previous studies have used the 
responses to four of these items to classify women’s confidence in their decision [14, 22, 23]. Similar to 
the DCS, women are asked their level of agreement with each item (See Figure 1B). Based on input from 
the instrument creators, we refer to this scale as the Taft-Baker Scale (TBS) throughout the present 
analysis. 
The follow up phone interview included the closed-ended question “Have you had an abortion since you 
visited [clinic] on [date]?” We classified women as still pregnant if they responded “No” to this question. 
Women who experienced a miscarriage or discovered that they were not pregnant between baseline 
and follow up were excluded from the follow up sample for this analysis. 
2.3 Statistical Analyses 
We calculated a summary score on the DCS overall and each subscale using guidance from the scale 
authors [24] and consistent with previous literature; this involved summing responses across items 
(where 0=strongly agree, 1= agree, 2= neither agree or disagree, 3=disagree, and 4=strongly disagree), 
and transforming scores to range from 0 to 100. Lower scores reflect lower levels of decisional 
uncertainty. A similar approach was employed to calculate a summary score on the TBS. To ensure that a 
lower score on each item was reflective of lower certainty, we reverse coded two TBS items (#3 and #4, 
see Figure 1B). We examined the distribution of scale scores for normality and missingness, and 
calculated summary statistics on each measure including mean, median, standard deviation, and range. 
We present the median and range given the non-normal distribution of scores. We also present the

mean and standard deviation, in order to allow for direct comparisons between mean DCS score in our 
study population and how it was presented in other studies.
To compare agreement in responses on the two scales, we computed Cohen’s kappa statistics (ƙ) with 
95% confidence intervals. Scores on each scale were dichotomized to isolate individuals scoring above 
the 90th percentile. We considered kappa > 0.2 as evidence of fair agreement, > 0.4 as moderate 
agreement, > 0.6 as substantial agreement, and > 0.8 as almost perfect agreement [25]. In addition, we 
constructed two multivariate logistic regression models to predict scoring above the 90th percentile on 
each scale. 
We used Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests to examine whether scores differed between women who 
completed a follow up interview and those who were lost to follow up. A more extensive attrition 
analysis on this data has been described elsewhere[17] . 
2.3.1 Reliability 
The internal consistency of each scale was evaluated using Cronbach’s α. A threshold of α=0.70 was 
considered evidence of acceptable reliability [26]. 
2.3.2 Validity 
To examine group validity, we used Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Willis tests to evaluate if scores
differed between groups we hypothesized a priori would vary based on previous literature. For example, 
given studies suggesting that women who lack social support for their decision are more likely to 
anticipate difficulty coping post-abortion [22, 27], we hypothesized that male partner’s awareness of and
support for the abortion would influence women’s uncertainty. We also hypothesized that younger 
women and those with misinformation about the safety or long term health effects of abortion would 
express more uncertainty.

We assessed predictive validity in two ways. First, for both the DCS and TBS, we compared scale 
distributions between women who were still pregnant at follow up and those who received an abortion 
using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Second, we explored the performance of the DCS subscales and the
TBS in predicting still being pregnant at follow up using multivariate logistic regression models, extending
our previous work that found that a higher score on the DCS scale (i.e. more uncertainty) was 
significantly and positively associated with still being pregnant at follow up [17]. We conducted all 
analyses using Stata 14.0 (College Station, TX) [28]. 
3. RESULTS 
Among 683 eligible women approached to participate, 500 completed a baseline survey at the beginning
of their abortion information visit, for a response rate of 73%. Nearly two-thirds (n=309, 62%) completed
a follow up phone interview. The mean duration between baseline and follow up survey was 25.7 days. A
small minority (n=8, 3%) discovered that they were not pregnant or experienced a miscarriage by the 
follow up interview and were excluded from subsequent analyses as they no longer had a decision to 
make about the pregnancy. The majority (n=267, 89%) of those remaining had had an abortion by the 
follow up phone interview. 
Study participants were predominantly white (68%) and Hispanic/Latina (22%). The average age was 
25.6, and one-half (50%) were nulliparous.  One-third (32%) reported receiving public assistance in the 
last year. Three-quarters (76%) were employed or in school. Most (67%) were in a relationship with or 
married to the man involved in their pregnancy. Almost half (45%) reported being religiously affiliated 
(Table 1).

At baseline, 492 women completed all 16 items of the DCS. Scores on the DCS were heavily skewed 
toward low conflict scores and were not normally distributed. The median score was 9.4, and ranged 
from 0 to 68.8. The mean score was 15.5 (standard deviation (SD)=15.2).  There were no differences in 
mean DCS score according to whether or not women completed a follow up interview (p=0.558, Table 2).
Cronbach’s alpha for the DCS overall was 0.93, suggesting high internal consistency. Each subscale of the 
DCS also had acceptable internal reliability, with Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.75 for the Uncertainty 
Subscale to 0.92 for the Values Clarity subscale (Table 2). 
With respect to the individual items comprising the DCS scale, women scored highest (reflecting more 
uncertainty) on the item “This decision is easy for me to make” (mean = 1.55, SD=1.44). This was the 
only item for which less than half of women (34%) strongly agreed with the statement. Women scored 
lowest (reflecting less uncertainty) on the items “I know which options are available to me” (mean = 
0.31, SD=0.54) and “I expect to stick with my decision” (mean=0.40, SD=0.63, data not shown, see Figure
1a for response distributions to all items).  
Mean DCS scores differed between women who were still pregnant at follow up and those that received 
abortion care (28.5 and 13.8, p<0.000) (Table 2). In a multivariate model, a higher score on the 
Uncertainty subscale was significantly and positively associated with being pregnant at follow up 
(adjusted OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.08 (Table 3). 
Mean scores on the DCS were significantly higher, indicating more conflict, among women ages 19 and 
under as compared to women ages 20 and older (20.5 vs. 14.6, p=0.005). Finally, mean DCS scores also 
increased significantly with the number of abortion myths endorsed by women, from a low of 5.8 among
women endorsing zero myths to 21.1 among women endorsing four myths presented (p=0.0001, Table 
2).

3.2 Taft-Baker Scale 
At the baseline interview, 484 women completed all four items of the TBS. Similar to the DCS, scores 
were heavily skewed toward low uncertainty scores and were not normally distributed. The median 
score was 6.3 and ranged from 0 to 56.3. The mean score was 12.4 (standard deviation=14.7). There 
were no differences in mean TBS score according to whether women completed a follow up interview 
(p=0.923, Table 2). 
The reliability of the TBS was acceptable according to Cronbach’s alpha (α= 0.72) (Table 2). 
Mean TBS scores differed between women who were still pregnant at follow up and those that received 
an abortion (mean = 24.4 and 10.8, p<0.000) (Table 2). In a multivariate model, higher TBS score was 
significantly and positively associated with still being pregnant at follow up (adjusted OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 
1.03, 1.09). 
TBS scores also differed according to women’s age, with women aged 19 and under scoring higher than 
women aged 20 and older (16.4 vs. 11.7, p=0.003). There were no significant differences in mean scale 
scores according to partner involvement and support. Similar to the DCS, women who endorsed a larger 
number of abortion myths also scored higher on the TBS (Table 2). 
3.3 Agreement on scale scores 
Dichotomized scale scores at the 90th percentile demonstrated moderate agreement in responses 
between scales (ƙ=0.51, 95%CI=0.39, 0.63). The majority of women (84%) had scores reflecting low 
uncertainty on both scales. However, a subset of women (10%) had discordant DCS and TBS scores, and 
6% had scores reflecting high uncertainty on both scales.

In multivariate analyses, women’s age, endorsement of abortion myths, and religious affiliation were 
associated with scoring above the 90th percentile on the DCS. Age and endorsement of abortion myths 
were associated with scoring above the 90th percentile on the TBS. Specifically, women ages 35 and older
were less likely to have scores reflecting high conflict for the DCS (aOR=0.20, 95% CI:0.04, 0.91) and TBS 
(aOR=0.11, 95% CI:0.01, 0.88) as compared to women ages 25 to 34. For each additional abortion myth 
endorsed, women were more likely to score above the 90th percentile on the DCS (aOR=1.92, 95% CI: 
1.40, 2.62) and TBS (aOR=1.71, 1.23, 2.38). Finally, compared to women who reported no religious 
affiliation, women who reported being Mormon were significantly more likely to have scores reflecting 
high conflict on the DCS (aOR=2.71, 1.32, 5.54). 
4. DISCUSSION
Much of the discourse around abortion policy suggests that abortion decision-making is exceptional 
compared to other healthcare decisions [29], and thus requires additional protection by targeted laws 
such as mandated waiting periods, information scripts, and ultrasound viewing requirements. Levels of 
decisional uncertainty in this study as measured by the DCS (mean score (µ) = 15.5) were comparable to 
or lower than those found in other studies of women making healthcare decisions, such as mastectomy 
after a breast cancer diagnosis (DCS µ = 17.4)[30], prenatal testing after infertility (DCS µ =22.1)[31], or 
antidepressant use during pregnancy (DCS µ = 26.2)[32]. They are also lower than levels observed in 
studies of men and women making decisions about reconstructive knee surgery (DCS µ = 37.4-42.7)[33] 
or men deciding on prostate cancer treatment options (DCS µ=35.7)[34]. Thus, our findings challenge 
these laws’ implicit characterization of women making abortion decisions—as compared to other 
healthcare decisions—as particularly conflicted.

Our results are also consistent with previous research [10-14] indicating that the majority of women are 
certain of their decision when they present for abortion care. A unique contribution of our study is that, 
unlike previous research, we measured decisional certainty using two scales, one of which has been 
extensively validated and is considered to be the gold standard for measuring this construct across 
diverse health domains [35], and the other of which was developed by abortion providers explicitly for 
counseling purposes. Despite their different origins, both scales performed well in psychometric 
analyses, indicating their appropriateness for use among women seeking abortion care and ability to 
distinguish the minority of women who may benefit from additional support and clinic resources. 
Comparing scores between the DCS and TBS suggests that the two scales are capturing similar but not 
identical constructs. The 16 items in the DCS may permit exploration into more nuanced aspects of the 
decision-making process that are not captured in the 4-item TBS. The item on the DCS that women had 
the most difficult time agreeing with was “This decision is easy for me to make.” This is consistent with 
previous research in which over one-half of women who had an abortion retrospectively report that 
their decision was either somewhat or very difficult [36]. Importantly, difficulty deciding does not 
necessarily translate into continuing the pregnancy, as 4 in 5 women in our study who disagreed with 
the statement that the decision was easy had had an abortion at follow up.  Further, the majority (85%) 
of those who disagreed that the decision was easy also agreed with the statement that abortion was the 
better choice for them. This suggests that, as has been found in other research, women can 
simultaneously acknowledge that their abortion decision was not easy and that they are confident it was
the right decision for them [36]. 
Our study found that women who endorsed a greater number of myths about abortion were more likely 
to express uncertainty about their decision. Importantly, our study is not able to disentangle the 
temporal relationship between these variables. It is plausible that women who are more conflicted

about their decision seek out or internalize negative information about abortion in their environment
[37, 38] more readily than those who are certain of their decision. Alternatively, endorsement of myths 
about abortion, or, more broadly, holding negative attitudes toward abortion, could introduce 
uncertainty into women’s decision-making. In our study, myth endorsement and decisional certainty 
were assessed prior to any interaction with a provider at the study clinic. Future research should 
examine how the subsequent patient-provider interaction influences women’s myth endorsement and 
certainty, including heterogeneity in effects when providers must cover mandated information scripts 
that contain scientifically inaccurate or misleading information about abortion [39].
This study had several limitations. Our sample was limited to women seeking abortion care in four Utah 
facilities, and as a result differed from the national profile of women seeking abortion[40] in several 
respects. First, adolescent women were underrepresented here (6%) as compared to nationally (18%). 
Thus, our finding that adolescent women score higher on each scale merits additional exploration with a 
larger and more representative sample of young women. Second, Utah’s population, and therefore our 
study population, has an overrepresentation of Mormon women and underrepresentation of African-
American women seeking abortion as compared to national profiles. Interestingly, the larger sample of 
Mormon women allowed us to identify significant differences in levels of decisional certainty by religious
affiliation, with Mormon women more likely to have high uncertainty as compared to women reporting 
no religious affiliation. Additional exploration by not only religious denomination, but also religiosity, 
would provide a more complete assessment of the role of religion. Finally, approximately one-third of 
our sample did not complete a follow up interview, and our results might be biased if those with high 
uncertainty were more likely to be lost to follow-up. However, there was no evidence of differential 
attrition by DCS or TBS score, reducing the likelihood of this bias.

Moving forward, this study should give confidence to providers who want to use validated scales to 
assess their patient’s decisional certainty as part of pre-abortion counseling or informed consent. For 
example, the TBS could be used as an initial screening tool to identify the minority of women who are 
uncertain of their decision. The DCS and its subscales could then be administered to this subset of 
women to identify specific factors contributing to that uncertainty, supporting providers in their efforts 
to provide patient-centered counseling and care [41, 42].
