Abstract
Major Depressive Disorder is a prevalent psychiatric condition with limited therapeutic options 
beyond monoaminergic therapies. Although effective in some individuals, many patients fail to 
respond adequately to existing treatments and new pharmacologic targets are needed. HCN 
channels regulate excitability in neurons and blocking HCN channel function has been proposed 
as a novel antidepressant strategy. However, systemic blockade of HCN channels produces cardiac 
effects that limit this approach. Knockout (KO) of the brain-specific HCN channel auxiliary 
subunit TRIP8b also produces antidepressant-like behavioral effects and suggests that inhibiting 
TRIP8b function could produce antidepressant-like effects without affecting the heart. We 
examined the structural basis of TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel trafficking and its relationship to 
antidepressant-like behavior using a viral rescue approach in TRIP8b KO mice. We found that 
restoring TRIP8b to the hippocampus was sufficient to reverse the impaired HCN channel 
trafficking and antidepressant-like behavioral effects caused by TRIP8b KO. Moreover, we found 
that hippocampal expression of a mutated version of TRIP8b further impaired HCN channel 
trafficking and increased the antidepressant-like behavioral phenotype of TRIP8b KO mice. Thus, 
modulating the TRIP8b-HCN interaction bidirectionally influences channel trafficking and 
antidepressant-like behavior. Overall, our work suggests that small molecule inhibitors of the 
interaction between TRIP8b and HCN should produce antidepressant-like behaviors and could 
represent a new paradigm for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.
Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness that causes tremendous 
health and social issues worldwide1, 2. Pharmacological treatment of MDD consists 
primarily of drugs targeting monoaminergic neurotransmitters, but there is a need for 
additional therapeutic options because many patients fail to respond to these therapies. 
Recent evidence suggests that changes in excitability within neural circuits of the

 hippocampus may play an important role in MDD3–5. These findings raise the possibility 
that therapies affecting cellular excitability could function as novel antidepressants6, 7.
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are encoded by four 
pore-forming subunits (HCN1–4) and mediate Ih, a cationic current that regulates neuronal 
excitability8, 9. In pyramidal neurons of hippocampal area CA1, HCN channels are enriched 
in distal dendrites where they reduce network excitability by limiting integration of synaptic 
inputs and dampening Ca2+ signaling10–12. This unique subcellular distribution of HCN 
channels is regulated by Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b interacting protein 
(TRIP8b), an auxiliary subunit of HCN channels expressed uniquely in the nervous 
system13–16. Loss of TRIP8b eliminates the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels in 
pyramidal neurons of CA1 and leads to increased hippocampal excitability16. Knockdown of 
HCN1 in CA117 and genetic ablation of HCN1, HCN2, or TRIP8b16 all produce an increase 
in neuronal excitability and, interestingly, all lead to antidepressant-like effects on behavior. 
Although these results suggest that blocking HCN channels could be useful in treating 
MDD, the important role of Ih in cardiac function limits the clinical utility of systemic 
pharmacological blockade. Because TRIP8b is not expressed in the heart, we reasoned that 
disrupting the interaction between TRIP8b and HCN could increase hippocampal 
excitability and produce antidepressant-like behavioral effects without affecting HCN 
channels in the heart. In this paper, we establish the importance of the interaction between 
TRIP8b and HCN channels for channel trafficking and antidepressant-like behavioral 
effects.
TRIP8b binds to HCN pore-forming subunits at two distinct sites18, 19. While both sites 
independently influence subcellular trafficking in heterologous expression systems18, 19, it is 
less clear how the distinct interactions affect channel function and behavior in the brain. To 
define the importance of the two TRIP8b-HCN interactions in vivo, we used adeno-
associated viral (AAV) vectors to express wild type and mutant TRIP8b in the hippocampus 
of TRIP8b knockout (KO) mice. We found that restoring TRIP8b expression in CA1 neurons 
is sufficient to rescue the enrichment of HCN channels in CA1 pyramidal neuron distal 
dendrites and reverse the antidepressant-like behavior of TRIP8b KO mice. Mutating either 
interaction site prevented TRIP8b-mediated restoration of channel trafficking and reversal of 
antidepressant-like behavior. However, a mutant TRIP8b construct lacking the ability to 
interact with the HCN channel at its C-terminal tail further reduced the expression of HCN 
channels in dendrites of TRIP8b KO mice and increased their antidepressant-like behavior. 
These experiments demonstrate that disrupting either TRIP8b-HCN binding site interferes 
with HCN channel trafficking and function. Overall, our data suggest that disrupting the 
protein-protein interactions between TRIP8b and HCN channel pore-forming subunits 
should produce antidepressant-like behavioral effects and that targeting the interaction 
between TRIP8b and the HCN channel C-terminal tail may be particularly effective as a 
potential new therapeutic approach for MDD.

Results
Viral expression of TRIP8b rescues Ih in CA1 pyramidal neurons of TRIP8b KO mice
TRIP8b KO mice lack all TRIP8b isoforms and have a reduction in both the distal dendritic 
enrichment of HCN channels and somatic Ih in CA1 pyramidal neurons16. Although TRIP8b 
has many splice isoforms, previous work has shown that an isoform comprised of exons 1a, 
4, and exons 5–16 (TRIP8b(1a-4)) is the most common13, 22. Thus we began by determining 
if this isoform is sufficient to rescue HCN channel distal dendritic enrichment. We generated 
an AAV carrying TRIP8b (Figure 1A, AAV-TRIP8b-IRES-eGFP, hereafter referred to as 
AAV-TRIP8b) driven by the human synapsin promoter in order to restrict expression to 
neurons (Supplementary Figure 1). To investigate if AAV-TRIP8b rescues somatic Ih, we 
bilaterally injected the CA1 of TRIP8b KO mice with AAV-eGFP or AAV-TRIP8b and 
injected wild type (WT) mice with AAV-eGFP as a positive control. We then made whole-
cell recordings from the eGFP-labeled CA1 pyramidal neurons. As expected, AAV-eGFP did 
not influence Ih in wild type or TRIP8b KO pyramidal neurons. In response to 
hyperpolarizing current injections, WT pyramidal neurons transduced with control AAV-
eGFP displayed a voltage sag characteristic of Ih, which was noticeably reduced in TRIP8b 
KO mice transduced with AAV-eGFP. TRIP8b KO mice transduced with AAV-TRIP8b 
showed rescue of the sag ratio (Figure 1C/D, measured as ΔVmax/ΔVsteady-state). Voltage 
clamp measurements of Ih produced similar results (Figure 1E/F). Expression of AAV-
TRIP8b in TRIP8b KO mice yielded large, slowly activating inward currents in response to 
hyperpolarizing voltage steps that were significantly larger than currents recorded from 
AAV-eGFP control neurons. Although robust Ih changes were detected in our recordings, no 
change in either resting membrane potential or input resistance was noted (Table S1). One 
potential explanation for these findings is that resting membrane potential and input 
resistance are not uniquely dependent on Ih and compensatory changes in other currents 
might attenuate changes in these properties. It is also possible that cell-to-cell variability in 
AAV-mediated TRIP8b expression masked changes in these parameters.

 After determining that AAV-TRIP8b was sufficient to rescue somatic Ih, we next 
investigated its effect on distal dendritic enrichment by unilaterally injecting the viral 
constructs in TRIP8b KO mice and performing immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the 
uninjected hemisphere of all conditions, the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 and HCN2 
was markedly reduced, similar to our previous findings16. In TRIP8b KO mice injected with 
AAV-eGFP, no distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 or HCN2 was noted in the injected 
hemisphere (Supplementary Figure S2). In contrast, unilateral injection of AAV-TRIP8b led 
to successful rescue of the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 and HCN2 (Figure 2A). To 
quantify this effect, we scaled the magnitude of HCN1 staining in the injected hemisphere 
by the staining in the uninjected hemisphere using regions of interest (ROI) drawn over each 
anatomic structure (Figure 2B). As expected, AAV-TRIP8b produced an increase in HCN1 
staining in the distal dendrites of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM; Figure 2B) and 
in HCN protein on western blot (Supplementary Figure S3). These experiments demonstrate 
that viral rescue of TRIP8b in the hippocampus is sufficient to rescue HCN channel 
trafficking.
CA1 presynaptic inhibitory terminals express HCN1 in a TRIP8b-independent manner
Incidentally, we noted that HCN1 expression in the cell body layer of CA1 appeared 
punctate, suggesting that it was expressed by terminals synapsing onto the cell bodies of 
CA1 pyramidal neurons. We subsequently performed immunohistochemistry to confirm that 
indeed, the majority of HCN1 in the cell body layer is colocalized with vesicular GABA 
transporter (vGAT)-positive inhibitory terminals (Supplementary Figure S4). Similar 
experiments using a presynaptic excitatory marker (vGlut) and postsynaptic markers 
(PSD95, Gephrin) did not show colocalization (data not shown). As has been seen at other 
presynaptic terminals expressing HCN123, punctate HCN1 expression in the CA1 cell body 
layer was not changed in TRIP8b KO mice, suggesting that TRIP8b is not responsible for 
trafficking HCN1 to axonal terminals in these interneurons. Given that we used a synapsin 
promoter in our AAV, it remained possible that exogenous expression of TRIP8b in the 
interneurons affected HCN1 trafficking. However, we did not observe any change in the 
presynaptic localization of HCN1 after treatment with either AAV-eGFP or AAV-TRIP8b 
(Supplementary Figure S5). Given that HCN1 expression in CA1 interneurons did not 
change with genetic knockout of TRIP8b or viral expression of TRIP8b, we did not pursue 
these findings further.
Loss of the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels in CA1 is responsible for the 
increase in antidepressant-like behavior of TRIP8b KO mice
Previous reports have found that reduction of HCN channel expression by HCN1 or HCN2 
knockout16 leads to antidepressant-like effects on behavior in two common antidepressant 
screening tests: the Forced Swim Test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST). Because 
genetic ablation of TRIP8b16 and siRNA knockdown of HCN1 in CA1 pyramidal neurons17 
also lead to antidepressant-like effects on behavior, we reasoned there could be a specific 
link between antidepressant-like behavioral effects and the distal dendritic enrichment of 
HCN channels in CA1 dendrites. We next examined if rescuing the distal dendritic 
enrichment of HCN channels influenced performance on TST and FST. We injected the CA1 
of TRIP8b KO mice bilaterally with either an AAV-eGFP control or AAV-TRIP8b, which

 restored HCN channel distal dendritic enrichment in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We then 
performed FST and TST (Figure 2 C/D). As demonstrated previously, TRIP8b KO mice 
have reduced immobility time on both FST and TST compared to WT littermates. TRIP8b 
KO mice injected with AAV-TRIP8b showed increased immobility time on TST and FST 
compared to AAV-eGFP injected controls, indicating a reversal of the antidepressant-like 
behavior normally observed in TRIP8b KO mice. As a control for locomotor function, we 
also performed an open field test (Supplementary Figure S4). Consistent with a specific 
effect on TST and FST, no differences were observed between AAV-eGFP and AAV-TRIP8b 
treated mice. Our results indicate that rescuing the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN 
channels with bilateral AAV-TRIP8b injection is sufficient to reverse the behavioral 
phenotype of TRIP8b KO mice.
Both TRIP8b binding sites are required for distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels
We next set out to identify the TRIP8b domains that are necessary for HCN channel 
trafficking. All TRIP8b isoforms bind to HCN subunits at two distinct locations. First, there 
is an interaction between the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) of HCN channels 
and an acidic stretch of amino acids N-terminal to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 
domains of TRIP8b15, 24. Second, the TPR domains of TRIP8b bind to the C-terminal tail of 
HCN. To examine the role of each interaction site in vivo we generated AAVs to express 
TRIP8b mutants designed to selectively eliminate each binding site. We previously 
demonstrated that deletion of 58 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of TRIP8b common 
to all isoforms (TRIP8b(Δ58)) disrupts interaction with the CNBD of HCN subunits without 
blocking the interaction between TRIP8b and the HCN subunit C-terminal tail19. 
Conversely, mutation of a key asparagine residue in the C-terminal portion of TRIP8b – the 
13th residue of the third TPR domain (N13A) – disrupts binding to HCN subunit C-terminal 
tails while leaving the CNBD interaction intact19. To determine the importance of each 
TRIP8b-HCN interaction site for HCN channel surface trafficking in vivo, we performed 
whole cell recordings from TRIP8b KO mice bilaterally injected with AAV-eGFP, AAV-
TRIP8b(N13A) (Figure 3Ai, hereafter referred to be as AAV-N13A), or AAV-TRIP8b(Δ58) 
(Figure 3Aii, hereafter referred to be as AAV-Δ58). Interestingly, mutation of either binding 
site prevented the TRIP8b constructs from successfully rescuing the sag ratio (Figure 3B/D) 
or Ih amplitude (Figure 3C/E), indicating that both sites are necessary for TRIP8b-mediated 
upregulation of Ih in vivo.
Although mutation of either TRIP8b binding site prevented restoration of Ih in our whole 
cell recordings, somatic recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons may not detect small changes 
in ion channel function in the distal dendrites22. This is especially problematic in the 
TRIP8b KO animals that express substantially fewer HCN channels than wild type 
animals16. We therefore unilaterally injected TRIP8b KO mice with one of the viral 
constructs mentioned above (AAV-eGFP, AAV-N13A, AAV-Δ58), or AAV-TRIP8b(Δ58/
N13A), a double mutant lacking the ability to bind HCN subunits at either binding site 
(Figure 3Aiii, hereafter referred to be as an AAV-Δ58/N13A). We then performed IHC and 
quantified our images as above. We found that none of the mutants could restore HCN 
subunit distal dendritic enrichment (Figure 4 for HCN1, see Supplementary Figure S6 for 
Han et al.

 HCN2). These results indicate that both TRIP8b-HCN interaction sites are necessary for 
enriching HCN channels in distal CA1 dendrites.
Surprisingly, AAV-N13A decreased dendritic HCN1 signal intensity relative to AAV-eGFP 
injected TRIP8b KO mice, suggesting that the isolated loss of the interaction between 
TRIP8b and the HCN C-terminal tail may actively restrict dendritic targeting of HCN 
channels. We subsequently performed western blots from hippocampi of TRIP8b KO mice 
bilaterally injected with each TRIP8b mutant and noted a reduction in HCN1 and HCN2 
total protein after injection with AAV-N13A relative to other conditions (Supplementary 
Figure S7), confirming a ‘gain-of-function’ effect of the AAV-N13A mutant to actively 
reduce total HCN protein levels.
Since the mutant TRIP8b constructs failed to rescue distal dendritic enrichment, we 
reasoned they should not reverse the antidepressant-like behavior of TRIP8b KO mice. We 
bilaterally injected TRIP8b KO mice with AAV-N13A, AAV-Δ58, or AAV-eGFP as a 
control. Consistent with our electrophysiological and IHC results, bilateral injection of AAV-
Δ58 did not produce a change in either TST or FST (Figure 4). Remarkably, expression of 
AAV-N13A, which diminished dendritic HCN channel expression without affecting somatic 
Ih, reduced the immobility time during FST and TST even more than in KO animals injected 
with AAV-eGFP. To ensure that these differences in FST and TST were not the result of 
increased locomotor activity, we performed an open field test (Supplementary Figure S8) 
and detected no differences in locomotion between groups. These results demonstrate that 
the interaction between TRIP8b and both the CNBD and C-terminal tail binding sites is 
required to maintain proper distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels in vivo. In 
addition, both interaction sites are also necessary for reversing the antidepressant-like 
behavior of TRIP8b KO mice. Finally, the surprising finding that the N13A mutation, which 
prohibits TRIP8b interaction with the HCN subunit C-terminal tail, actively inhibits the 
distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels hints at a novel regulatory mechanism of HCN 
channel trafficking. These results show that manipulations of TRIP8b-HCN coupling lead to 
changes in the distal dendritic enrichment of the channels and that this distal dendritic 
trafficking is inversely correlated with antidepressant-like behavior.
Discussion
Genetic knockout of HCN1 or HCN216, as well as siRNA knockdown of HCN1 in the 
CA117, leads to antidepressant-like effects on behavior in the TST and FST. Importantly, the 
antidepressant-like behavior of the HCN1 and HCN2 KO mice is also observed in TRIP8b 
KO mice16. Because a critical role for TRIP8b in the CA1 is to facilitate the proper 
subcellular trafficking of HCN channels, these results suggest that the distal dendritic 
enrichment of HCN channels produced by TRIP8b is particularly relevant for influencing 
antidepressant-like behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate that bidirectionally 
manipulating the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels in CA1 is sufficient to 
influence antidepressant-like behaviors. Bilateral injection of AAV-TRIP8b restored the 
distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels and reversed the antidepressant-like behaviors 
of TRIP8b knockout, while bilateral injection of AAV-N13A reduced the distal dendritic 
enrichment of HCN channels and promoted antidepressant-like behaviors.

 Other studies have also pointed to a role for HCN channels in depression. Mice subjected to 
Chronic Social Defeat (CSD) stress develop depression-like behaviors, and a recent report 
demonstrated that Ih is significantly upregulated in NAc-projecting, VTA dopaminergic 
neurons25. Interestingly, chronic SSRI administration reduced the increase in Ih caused by 
CSD stress26. Corticotropin releasing factor, which has been implicated in depression 
pathogenesis through HPA axis dysfunction27, increases Ih in both the basolateral amygdala 
and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus28, 29. While evidence is accumulating for 
involvement of HCN channels in depression models, it remains to be determined if 
upregulation of HCN channels in distinct brain regions underlies depression. Future studies 
should also indicate whether upregulation of HCN or TRIP8b in hippocampal area CA1 
occurs in MDD patients or rodent models and whether reducing HCN channel function in 
the hippocampus underlies any of the clinical effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors.
The precise mechanism for how removal of dendritic HCN channels produces 
antidepressant-like behavior remains unclear. An accumulating body of evidence suggests 
that MDD is caused by dysfunction in many identifiable neuronal circuits. One recent report 
showed that chronic stress decreased both CA1 and hippocampal network excitability and 
that this decrease was reversible with antidepressants30. Loss of HCN channels from 
hippocampal distal dendrites increases temporal summation and cellular excitability, and in 
the context of the neuronal circuit hypothesis, increasing hippocampal network excitability 
is a plausible mechanism by which loss of HCN channels could influence antidepressant-
like behavior. In addition, the specific localization of HCN channels to the distal dendrites of 
CA1, which receive selective input from the entorhinal cortex, may confer a pathway-
specific regulation of excitability. Chronic stress in mice decreases EPSPs in the SLM of 
CA1 pyramidal cells through AMPA-R downregulation31. In addition, chronic SSRI 
treatment specifically reverses these AMPA-R mediated decreases in excitability of SLM 
synapses without changing the excitability of more proximal synapses32. Because HCN 
channels are enriched in the SLM, where they constrain excitability of temporoammonic 
inputs, loss of HCN channels in these distal dendrites could reverse or mitigate pathway-
specific synaptic weakening that may play a role in depression-like behaviors.
In this paper, we establish the distal dendritic enrichment of HCN channels in CA1 
pyramidal neurons as a key determinant of performance in the tail suspension test and forced 
swim test. For therapeutic purposes, it is significant to note that therapies aimed at disrupting 
either TRIP8b-HCN interaction site are predicted to limit trafficking of HCN channels and 
produce an increase in antidepressant-like behavior. Recent efforts have been directed at 
finding small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between the TPR domains of TRIP8b 
and the C-terminal tripeptide of HCN channel pore-forming subunits33. Given the brain-
specific expression pattern of TRIP8b, this strategy should limit cardiac effects seen with 
systemic HCN channel inhibitors. Overall, our results indicate that disrupting the distal 
dendritic enrichment of HCN channels through manipulations that impair TRIP8b-HCN 
interactions represents a promising target for future antidepressant therapies33.

 Figure 1. Viral expression of TRIP8b is sufficient to rescue Ih
A.) Schematic of TRIP8b interacting with a single HCN pore-forming subunit. The N-
terminal interaction occurs between the CNBD of HCN and an acidic stretch of amino acids 
in TRIP8b, schematized by a red shape. The C-terminal tail interaction occurs between the 
TPR domains of TRIP8b in gray and the ‘SNL’ tripeptide of HCN1, 2, and 4. The variably 
spliced N terminus of TRIP8b is represented by a green rectangle. B.) Schematic showing 
virus injection site. Coronal brain image generated using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas34. C.) 
Whole-cell somatic recordings from eGFP-positive CA1 pyramidal neurons four weeks after 
bilateral viral injection into TRIP8b KO mice. Representative traces are shown during 
hyperpolarizing current injection. D.) Quantification of sag ratio. For reference, WT mice 
injected with AAV-eGFP are also shown (WT: 1.23±0.02, n=8; AAV-eGFP: 1.07±0.01, n=9; 
AAV-TRIP8b: 1.27±0.04, n=8; (F(2,22)=11.64, p<0.001). E.) Quantification of Ih amplitude 
from somatic voltage-clamp recordings from TRIP8b KO animals injected with the indicated 
viral construct (AAV-eGFP: 0.24±0.05pA/pF, n=9, AAV-TRIP8b: 0.68±0.10pA/pF, n=7). 
AAV-eGFP injected wild type mice are included for reference (0.67±0.11 pA, n=8; 
F(2,21)=7.92, p<0.01). F.) Representative voltage-clamp traces in response to 
hyperpolarizing voltage steps. All error bars represent ± s.e.m and are described above as 
mean ± s.e.m. *p<0.05 on Tukey’s test following one way ANOVA.

 Figure 2. Dendritic targeting of HCN channels is rescued by viral delivery of TRIP8b
A.) Low power composite image of TRIP8b KO animals unilaterally injected with AAV-
TRIP8b. Uninjected hemisphere (left) shows absence of TRIP8b (red, top panel) and weak 
hippocampal HCN gradients (green, middle and lower panels). Injected hemisphere (right) 
shows restoration of the distal dendritic enrichment of TRIP8b, HCN1, and HCN2. SO: 
Stratum oriens, SP: Stratum pyramidale, SR: Stratum radiatum, SLM: Stratum lacunosum 
moleculare. Scale bar represents 200 µm. B.) Quantification of HCN1 channel expression 
after viral rescue. A value of ‘1’ represents no change in staining of HCN1 relative to the 
uninjected hemisphere. Asterisk denotes comparison of HCN1 staining in the SLM (AAV-
eGFP: 0.98±0.01 n=6, AAV-TRIP8b= 1.52±0.05 n=4, t=23.81, p<0.001). C/D) TRIP8b KO 
mice bilaterally injected with AAV-TRIP8b showed more immobility time on forced swim 
test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) relative to AAV-eGFP injected controls. Injection 
of AAV-TRIP8b increased the immobility time on TST (AAV-eGFP = 132±20.9 sec, AAV-
TRIP8b 166.16±26.5 sec, t=2.47, p<0.05) and FST (AAV-eGFP = 77.3±11.2 sec, AAV-
TRIP8b = 142.8±20.1 sec, t=6.96, p<0.05), indicating a reversal of the increase in

 antidepressant-like behavioral effects of TRIP8b KO mice (n=6,6). For comparison, 
uninjected wild type mice and uninjected TRIP8b KO mice are also shown to highlight the 
increase in antidepressant-like behavior for both TST (WT = 191.8±17.6 sec, TRIP8b 
KO=134.8±23.4 sec, t=4.47, p<0.05) and FST (WT=142.4±21.8 sec, TRIP8b 
KO=85.6±9.93 sec, t=5.72, p<0.05) (n=6,5). Note that the comparison between AAV-eGFP 
and AAV-TRIP8b is distinct from the comparison between wild type and TRIP8b KO mice 
because the AAV-eGFP/AAV-TRIP8b were both subject to bilateral viral injections while the 
other groups were not. *P<0.05 two tail unpaired T test. All error bars represent ± s.e.m. and 
are described above as mean ± s.e.m.

 Figure 3. Loss of either TRIP8b-HCN binding site blocks viral rescue of Ih
Ai–iii.) Schematic of mutant TRIP8b isoforms used showing predicted results of mutating 
either binding site. B.) Representative traces from EGFP-positive CA1 pyramidal neurons 
from each condition during hyperpolarizing current injections. Traces are scaled to ΔVmax to 
facilitate comparison of sag ratio. C.) Representative voltage-clamp recordings in response 
to hyperpolarizing voltage steps highlight slowly activating inward current. D.) 
Quantification of the sag ratio showed no difference by ANOVA (AAV-eGFP: 1.07±0.01, 
n=9; AAV-N13A: 1.11±0.02, n=7; AAV-Δ58: 1.09±0.01, n=6; F(2,19)=2.095, p>0.05). For

Voltage-clamp measurements of Ih also showed no difference by ANOVA). (AAV-eGFP: 
0.24±0.05 pA/pF, n=9; AAV-N13A: 0.282±0.09 pA/pF, n=7; AAV-Δ58: 0.27±0.04 pA/pF, 
n=5; F(2,19)=0.09, p>0.05). For comparison, the Ih amplitude from AAV-TRIP8b infected 
neurons is reproduced from Figure 1. All error bars represent ± standard error of the mean 
and are described above as mean ± s.e.m.

 Figure 4. Both TRIP8b-HCN binding sites are required for dendritic targeting of HCN channels
A.) Confocal images demonstrating that unilateral injection of AAV-N13A causes a 
reduction in HCN1 staining in the SLM. Top panels show staining for HCN1 (red), middle 
panel shows staining for eGFP (green), and the bottom panel shows a composite image. 
Images in the left column are from the uninjected (control) hemisphere, while the right 
column shows the AAV-N13A injected hemisphere. B/C.) Unilateral injection of either 
AAV-Δ58 or AAV-Δ58/N13A fails to rescue HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment. Display of 
images is identical to that in A. Scale bar represents 100 µm. D.) Quantification of HCN1

 distal enrichment. HCN1 staining intensity in regions of interest from the virally injected 
hemisphere were scaled by staining in the contralateral (uninjected) hemisphere. For 
comparison, the AAV-TRIP8b rescue experiment is reproduced from Figure 2. E.) 
Quantification of HCN1 staining in the SLM layer of CA1 (AAV-eGFP= 0.98±0.01, AAV-
Δ58=0.98±0.04, AAV-N13A=0.78±0.04, AAV-Δ58/N13A=0.99±0.07). A one way ANOVA 
comparing staining intensity in the SLM of the different conditions (AAV-eGFP, AAV-Δ58, 
AAV-N13A, AAV-Δ58/N13A) was found to be significant (F(3,17)=22.375, p<0.05). 
Tukey’s post hoc tests found a difference between AAV-N13A and AAV-eGFP (p<0.05), 
AAV-N13A and AAV-Δ58 (p<0.05), and AAV-N13A and AAV-N13A/Δ58 (p<0.05). A one 
way ANOVA comparing HCN1 staining in the cell body layer of the different conditions 
(AAV-eGFP, AAV-N13A, AAV-Δ58, AAV-Δ58/N13A) was not significant (F(3,17)=0.59, 
p>0.5) hence post hoc tests were not performed. F.) TRIP8b KO mice bilaterally injected 
with AAV-N13A, but not AAV-Δ58, show less immobility time on TST and FST. A one way 
ANOVA examining the immobility time on FST found a significant difference (AAV-
eGFP=148.42±18.8 sec, AAV-N13A=40.2±6.7 sec, AAV-Δ58=127.4±25.0 sec, 
F(2,18)=67.34, P<0.05), and follow up Tukey’s tests revealed a difference between AAV-
eGFP and AAV-N13A as well as a difference between AAV-N13A and AAV-Δ58. G.) A one 
way ANOVA examining the immobility time on TST was significantly different (AAV-
eGFP=130±12.2 sec, AAV-N13A=44.9±20.1 sec, AAV-Δ58=114±10.0 sec, F(2,17)=62.32, 
p<0.05) with Tukey’s test showing differences between AAV-eGFP and AAV-N13A and 
between AAV-Δ58 and AAV-N13A. *p<0.05 on Tukey’s HSD test following one way 
ANOVA. All error bars represent ± standard error of the mean and are described above as 
mean ± s.e.m.
