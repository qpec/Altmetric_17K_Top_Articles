Abstract
Objectives—To assess a novel physical rehabilitation intervention in older patients hospitalized 
for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).
Background—Following ADHF, older patients, who are frequently frail with multiple co-
morbidities, have prolonged and incomplete recovery of physical function and remain at high risk 
for poor outcomes.
Methods—This was a 3-site, randomized, attention-controlled pilot study of a tailored, 
progressive, multi-domain physical rehabilitation intervention beginning in the hospital and 
continuing for 12 weeks post-discharge in patients ≥60 years hospitalized with ADHF. The 
primary purpose was to assess feasibility and reasonableness of the hypothesis that the novel 
rehabilitation intervention would improve physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB)) over 3 months and reduce all-cause rehospitalizations over 6 months.
Results—We enrolled 27 ADHF patients aged 60–98 years: 59% women, 56% African-
American, 41% preserved ejection fraction (>45%). At baseline, participants had marked

 impairments in physical function, multiple co-morbidities, and frailty. Study retention (89%) and 
intervention adherence (93%) were excellent. At 3 months, we measured an intervention effect 
size for the SPPB score of +1.1 units (7.4±0.5 vs 6.3±0.5) and at 6 months observed an effect size 
for all-cause rehospitalization rate of −0.48 (1.16±0.35 vs. 1.64±0.39). The change in SPPB score 
was strongly related to all-cause rehospitalizations, explaining 91% of change.
Conclusions—These findings support the feasibility and rationale for a recently-launched, NIH-
funded trial to test the safety and efficacy of this novel multi-domain physical rehabilitation 
intervention to improve physical function and reduce rehospitalizations in older, frail ADHF 
patients with multiple comorbidities.

Introduction
Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in older 
adults and is associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures.
(1) Improving outcomes following ADHF hospitalization is a national health care priority. 
However, even with optimal adherence to heart failure (HF) management guidelines, 
outcomes following hospitalization remain poor(2,3) and >50% experience readmission or 
death within 6 months.(4)
We and others have recently shown that older patients hospitalized with ADHF are 
frequently frail with severe impairments in multiple domains of physical function, including 
strength, balance, mobility, and endurance.(5–7) These impairments may help explain 
persistently high rehospitalization rates, the majority of which are not due to recurrent 
ADHF.(4,8) However, current ADHF management strategies do not account for such 
impairments and prior exercise training trials in HF have systematically excluded patients 
with current or recent ADHF.(9–11) Furthermore, conventional cardiac rehabilitation 
programs are not designed to address the multi-domain functional impairments common in 
older ADHF patients, particularly balance impairments and commencing rehabilitation 
without doing so can increase injuries.(12) Consequently, the role of physical rehabilitation 
intervention in patients with ADHF and older, frail HF patients with severe, widespread 
functional impairments has been identified as a critical evidence gap.(11)
To begin to address this gap, we conducted a prospective, randomized, pilot study of a novel 
intervention designed to address the severe and widespread physical function impairments in 
older patients with ADHF. We hypothesize that a tailored, progressive, physical 
rehabilitation intervention addressing deficits in balance, mobility, strength, and endurance 
that begins during hospitalization and continues for 3 months following discharge will 
improve physical function and reduce rehospitalizations in this vulnerable population. 
Because there were no prior studies of such an intervention in this frail, elderly, acutely 
hospitalized population and considerable equipoise existed, the present pilot study was 
designed to determine feasibility and support the rationale and design of a future, large, 
definitive trial.

 Methods
Study Design and Population
This was a 3-site, randomized, attention-controlled pilot study of a novel, multi-domain 
physical rehabilitation intervention for older patients with ADHF beginning in the hospital 
and continuing for 12 weeks post-discharge with blinded assessment of outcome measures. 
As a pilot, the study was specifically not powered to definitively test the hypothesis. Rather, 
the study was designed to determine the feasibility of enrollment, retention, adherence, and 
follow-up, as well as the potential safety and potential for efficacy of the intervention, 
including estimate the intervention effect size. Such data are critical to determine the 
reasonableness of the hypotheses and to guide the design of a larger, definitive trial.
The study was inclusive of patients with multiple comorbidities, heterogeneous functional 
performance, and both reduced (<45%) and preserved (≥45%) ejection fraction (EF). 
Criteria for ADHF included: acute worsening of at least one HF symptom (exertional 
dyspnea or fatigue, swelling of legs or abdomen, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal 
dyspnea); at least one sign of HF (pulmonary congestion by exam or x-ray, elevated jugular 
or central venous pressure, peripheral edema, elevated B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( >100 
pg/ml) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type Natriuretic Peptide (>220pg/ml)); and change in 
medical treatment consistent with HF (e.g. augmentation of diuretics). The diagnosis of 
ADHF was confirmed by a study cardiologist with expertise in HF. Additional inclusion 
criteria were age >60 years, independence with basic activities of daily living prior to 
hospitalization, achievement of clinical stability allowing study participation, able to 
ambulate at least 4 meters (assistive device allowed) at the time of enrollment, and planned 
return to home post-discharge.
Exclusion criteria included: acute coronary syndrome; severe aortic stenosis; end-stage HF 
requiring advanced therapies or home intravenous inotropic therapy; functional status 
limited by condition other than HF at the time of enrollment; advanced chronic kidney 
disease defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL/min/1.73 m2; terminal illness 
other than HF; actively participating in supervised exercise training prior to hospitalization; 
or inability or unwillingness to adhere with the study protocol. All participants provided 
informed consent. The study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at each center 
and was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01508650).
Prior to hospital discharge and following medical stabilization and acquisition of baseline 
measurements, participants were randomly assigned in 1:1 fashion to a novel, progressive, 
multi-domain, 12-week physical function intervention or attention control. Participants were 
randomization using a computer-generated list (SAS software, version 9.0) and stratified by 
enrolling site and HF category (EF <45% or >45%).
Study Intervention
The multi-domain rehabilitation intervention for this study was a novel application of 
established rehabilitation therapies selected and integrated specifically for older patients 
hospitalized for ADHF. The goal of the intervention program was to improve performance in 
4 domains: balance, strength, mobility and endurance. Exercise prescription was adapted to

 individual functional deficits in each domain based on standardized protocols and 
administered by trained interventionists using specific milestones for progression.
The majority of the intervention consisted of 60-minute sessions three times per week for 12 
weeks in the outpatient setting beginning immediately following discharge. When feasible, 
daily 30-minute sessions during the hospitalization were also conducted. During the first 2–4 
weeks following hospital discharge, supervised home-based training was allowed for 
patients with particularly poor functional status. Target intensity was based on patient-
reported rate of perceived exertion (6–20 scale) and was initially low (≤12); after 2 weeks 
increased to 13 (“somewhat hard”; range 11–15) for endurance training and 15–16 for 
strength training.
To guide exercise prescription, participants in the intervention arm were stratified into 1 of 4 
levels for each functional domain (balance, mobility, strength and endurance). Exercises 
appropriate to the participant’s functional level in each domain were then selected from the 
intervention protocols. These included static and dynamic balance training (e.g., standing 
with narrow base of support; stand and reach); mobility training (e.g., dynamic start and stop 
and changing direction while walking); functional strength training focused on lower 
extremities (e.g., chair rise; step-ups); and endurance training (sustained walking preferred). 
During exercise sessions, rest breaks were allowed as needed and close one-on-one 
supervision was provided by study interventionists.
As performance improved, participants were advanced through a structured, gradual 
progression using specific small increments in each exercise. Standardized re-assessment of 
performance in each domain was conducted every 2 weeks to guide exercise progression.
In addition to these supervised, facility-based sessions, participants were given a brief home 
exercise prescription to be performed on non-program days. This included low intensity 
walking at usual pace for up to 30 minutes and simple functional strengthening exercises, 
such as repeated chair rise or supported calf raise. After completion of the 12-week 
outpatient intervention, participants transitioned to an unsupervised home-based 
maintenance exercise program utilizing an individualized exercise prescription developed by 
the intervention team.
The standardized protocol of exercises and progressions was designed to support consistent 
implementation of the intervention over time, between participants, and across sites. To 
further support intervention fidelity, in-person training of the study interventionists, who 
were experienced exercise physiologists and physical therapists, was conducted. An 
intervention leader provided ongoing oversite of study rehabilitation sessions at each site. 
Bi-weekly intervention teleconferences among all site intervention leaders and 
interventionists were conducted to provide continued monitoring and guidance.
Adherence and Retention
During the enrollment period and prior to randomization, participants underwent screening 
for potential barriers to adherence. The demands of study participation were discussed in 
detail with potential participants and, whenever possible, family and/or caregivers. A

 standardized assessment tool was used to query personal commitment to adhering to the 
study requirements, degree of support from family members, caregivers and outpatient 
physicians, and potential transportation barriers. Those unable or unwilling to fully commit 
to all aspects of study participation or who had a lack of support were considered high risk 
for non-adherence and were not randomized and were excluded from the study.
Flexible scheduling, ongoing engagement of the participant, participant’s family and 
caregivers, and transportation support were provided to promote study adherence and 
retention. In the event of an interruption due to illness, which was anticipated in this frail, 
high-risk population, participants in the intervention group were allowed up to two 
additional weeks to complete 36 multi-domain intervention sessions. Participants in both 
arms were allowed up to 2 additional weeks to complete the 3-month assessments.
Attention control group
Participants randomized to attention control received at least monthly contact from study 
personnel with scheduled phone calls (months 2, 4, 5 and 6) and follow-up assessments 
(months 1 and 3).
Usual care
Participants in both arms could receive standard therapies, including home health and 
outpatient rehabilitation, as directed by their clinical providers. In the event of scheduling 
conflict, priority was given to usual care therapies. Medical therapy and HF management 
was at the discretion of the participant’s treating physician and was specifically not 
addressed by the study protocol for either study arm.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was change in the Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB) at 3 months.(13) The SPPB is composed of 3 components, standing balance, gait 
speed, and timed repeated chair rise, each scored from 0–4 and combined for a total score of 
0–12. The secondary outcome measure was all-cause rehospitalizations through 6 months 
following discharge from index hospitalization. Other measures included 6-month all-cause 
rehospitalization days, and 3 month change in Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD), frailty 
status based on the Fried phenotype(14), health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) based on 
the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)(15), cognitive function based on 
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)(16) and depression symptoms based on the 15-
item Geriatric Depression Score (GDS-15).(17) All baseline measures were collected during 
the index hospitalization prior to randomization. Follow-up assessments were collected by 
trained, blinded assessors according to standardized protocols. Collection of clinical events 
was based on patient and caregiver report as well as review of medical records.
Statistical Analysis
Comparison of change in SPPB at 3 months between the attention control and intervention 
arms was made with analysis of covariance, with the 3-month value as the outcome and the 
baseline value as the covariate. Similar analyses were done for change in SPPB components, 
6MWD, frailty status, KCCQ, MoCA score and GDS-15 score.

 Re-hospitalizations were tracked and analyzed for all 27 participants (intention-to-treat 
analysis) for the entire 6-month study period. The number of all-cause re-hospitalizations 
per participant in each study arm was compared using analysis of covariance with HF 
category and baseline SPPB score as covariates. Secondary analysis of total number of all-
cause rehospitalization days was also performed.
Spearman rank correlations between the effect on SPPB or 6MWD and the number of all-
cause 6-month rehospitalizations were calculated. The extent the effect of group assignment 
(intervention vs attention control) on all-cause 6-month hospitalization was mediated by 
SPPB score was assessed. A two-tailed p value of <0.05 was used for significance.
Results
Of the 65 patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were offered participation, 
30 consented. Three patients were excluded by adherence risk screening, as per study 
protocol, such that 27 were randomized (15 intervention arm; 12 attention control). Baseline 
characteristics were balanced between the study arms with regards to older age, gender, race, 
number of comorbid conditions (approximately 5), markedly impaired functional status 
across multiple domains of physical function, high rates of frailty (≥50%), mild cognitive 
impairment (≥80%) and symptoms of depression (≥25%) (Table 1). Baseline functional 
status was very poor with approximately 40% of participants initially at the lowest 
stratification for most domains, 33% were at level 2, and 27% were at level 3. For example, 
nearly half the participants were unable to stand from a chair even once without the use of 
arms (strength level 1), stand unsupported with feet together for 10 seconds (balance level 
1), tolerate >2 minutes of continuous walking (endurance level 1), and had a gait speed of 
≤0.4 m/s (mobility level 1).
Twenty-four patients completed follow-up (3 dropouts; 89% retention rate). Participants who 
completed the intervention attended 92% of scheduled sessions.
At three months following hospital discharge the change in the SPPB score in the 
intervention group (4.8±2.8 to 6.9±3.0 units) compared to attention control (6.0±3.0 to 
6.8±3.3 units) showed an intervention effect size of +1.1 units (7.4±0.5 vs. 6.3±0.5) (Table 
2; Figure 1). For perspective on this magnitude of effect size, a clinically meaningful change 
in SPPB score is ≥0.6 units.(18) All individual component scores of the SPPB increased 
with the strongest trend seen with chair rise (lower extremity functional strength) (Table 2). 
At 3-month follow-up, there was an intervention effect size for 6MWD of +23 meters 
(247±22 vs 224±22 meters, intervention vs control, respectively) (Table 2; Figure 1). A 
clinically meaningful change in 6MWD is ≥20 meters.(18)
As expected during recovery from an ADHF hospitalization, at 3-month follow-up both 
groups had higher KCCQ score, with an intervention effect size of +5.4 points (+5 points is 
considered clinically meaningful).(19) Changes at 3-month follow-up in other variables, 
including in frailty, cognitive function, and depression are shown in Table 2.
There were 37 all-cause rehospitalizations during the 6-month follow-up, including 22 for 
ADHF, with 18 (67%) of the 27 participants experiencing at least one rehospitalization. The

 rate of 6-month all-cause rehospitalization was 29% lower in the intervention group 
(1.16±0.35 vs 1.64±0.39) and 6-month all-cause rehospitalization days were 47% lower per 
participant (6.0±2.5 vs 11.4±2.8), yielding an intervention effect size of −0.48 
hospitalizations and −5.4 days, respectively (Figure 2). The change in the SPPB score was 
inversely correlated with the change in 6-month all-cause rehospitalizations (−0.60; p<0.01). 
Change in in 6MWD did not correlate with change in hospitalizations (−0.17; p=0.42). The 
change in the SPPB score explained 91% of the change in all-cause rehospitalizations by 
mediation analysis.
There was one adverse event judged to be possibly related to the study intervention. The 
participant had completed a study intervention session uneventfully and returned home. 
Several hours later the participant had chest pain and was subsequently hospitalized with a 
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. There were no other adverse events judged to be 
related to study participation and the intervention was otherwise well tolerated without 
injury or falls, even among those at the lowest level of functioning. There were no deaths.
Discussion
The REHAB-HF Pilot study was a prospective, multi-center, pilot clinical trial evaluating a 
novel rehabilitation intervention in hospitalized older HF patients. The study successfully 
randomized 27 patients ≥60 years old hospitalized with ADHF to either a novel multi-
domain physical rehabilitation intervention or attention control. In both study arms baseline 
physical function impairments were severe, involving all physical function domains 
(balance, mobility, strength, and endurance), and frailty, severely reduced quality-of-life, 
cognitive dysfunction, and depression were common.(6) The intervention, which began 
during the index hospitalization and continued for 12-weeks in the outpatient setting, was 
generally well tolerated and there was good retention and adherence. At 3-month follow-up, 
we observed an intervention effect size of +1.1 units in the SPPB score, a well-accepted, 
standardized measure of physical function in frail older persons that is known to be strongly 
correlated with important clinical outcomes, including hospitalization, disability, and death.
(7,13) The established threshold for clinically meaningful change in SPPB score is +0.6 
units.(18) At 6-month follow-up, we observed an intervention effect size on all-cause re-
hospitalizations of −0.48 and on re-hospitalization days of −5.4 days. The change in SPPB 
score was inversely related to the change in rehospitalization rate. By mediation analysis, 
change in SPPB score explained 91% of the change in rehospitalization rate, supporting a 
potential mechanistic link between physical function and rehospitalizations in frail, older 
ADHF patients.
These findings support the reasonableness of our overall study hypothesis that a novel, 
tailored, progressive, multi-domain physical rehabilitation intervention is feasible in older 
patients with ADHF who have high rates of frailty and co-morbidities and has the potential 
to improve physical function and reduce rehospitalization rates. The results of this pilot 
study informed the design of a subsequent multi-center clinical trial that was funded by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is designed to definitively test this hypothesis. The 
recently launched trial (NCT# NCT01508650) will enroll 360 patients, a sample size 
supported by the present data.

 To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial of a physical rehabilitation 
intervention in older, hospitalized ADHF patients. Prior trials of exercise training in HF 
systematically excluded such patients(10) and evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of 
exercise intervention within 4–6 weeks following an ADHF hospitalization is very limited.
(11) Consequently, the most recent national society consensus statement recommends 
against enrolling recently hospitalized HF patients in cardiac rehabilitation and such patients 
were excluded from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decision 
memo expanding coverage for cardiac rehabilitation for patients with HF.(20,21) Addressing 
the critical evidence gap regarding the role of physical rehabilitation in patients recently 
hospitalized with AHDF has been designated as a high research priority by the NIH.(11)
Our findings suggest these severe functional impairments in older patients with ADHF may 
be modifiable with a sustained, targeted and progressive multi-domain rehabilitation 
intervention. The favorable trend towards reduced hospitalization observed in the 
intervention arm, which was almost entirely mediated by the change in physical function, 
provides encouraging evidence that clinical outcomes in older ADHF patients may be 
improved by successfully addressing these severe functional impairments.
Although encouraging, our findings also support the need for caution and further study 
regarding the role and design of physical rehabilitation in older patients with ADHF. The 
functional impairments in older patients following an ADHF hospitalization are far more 
severe and widespread than those reported in chronic stable HF patients and targeted by 
conventional cardiac rehabilitation.(6,9) For example, the average baseline 6MWD in the 
present cohort (178m) was half of that observed in similarly aged patients in the HF-
ACTION trial (~350m).(22) Severe lower extremity weakness prevented nearly half of older, 
frail ADHF patients from standing even once from a seated position without the use of arms.
(6) Importantly, older patients with ADHF also had severe deficits in balance and mobility 
which are not typically seen in chronic, stable HF patients and which are not addressed by 
conventional, endurance-based cardiac rehabilitation.(6,23) Initiating standard endurance 
exercise training in such patients without first addressing deficits in balance and mobility 
may limit efficacy(24) and increase the risk of injuries and falls.(12) To safely address these 
deficits, one-on-one training is often required(25), a feature incorporated into our 
intervention but not typically supported under current cardiac rehabilitation reimbursement 
models.
The present study was intended to address a critical evidence gap regarding physical 
function intervention in recently hospitalized, older frail HF patients. In HF-ACTION, the 
largest trial of physical rehabilitation in HF, mean age was <60 years and patients were 
mandated to be chronic, stable, with no medication changes or hospitalization within the 
prior 6 weeks. However, in reality, few HF-ACTION participants had been hospitalized for 
HF within even 6 months of enrollment.(9) Furthermore, functional impairments in older 
patients recovering from an ADHF hospitalization are dramatically more severe and 
widespread than those observed in chronic stable HF.(6) Recovery from this precipitous loss 
of function may be delayed and incomplete following hospital discharge.(26) Indeed, the 
attention control arm of this study continued to demonstrate severe physical dysfunction 
even three months following discharge. If successful, novel physical rehabilitation

 interventions like the one investigated in this study could serve as a “bridge” to more 
conventional cardiac rehabilitation interventions once functional impairments improve to the 
level for which cardiac rehabilitation has proven benefit.(9,10)
Limitations
This was a pilot study and was not designed or powered to definitively assess the efficacy or 
safety of the physical rehabilitation intervention. The findings should be considered 
preliminary and encouraging trends require confirmation in a larger, adequately powered 
clinical trial. There was considerable focus on retention and exercise adherence and similar 
rates may not be achieved outside the clinical research setting. Because they were excluded 
from the study, the results may not apply to patients who were not independent prior to 
admission, or who were expected to be discharged to a nursing home.
Future directions
Based on these pilot data, a larger, adequately powered NIH-funded multicenter randomized 
clinical trial, Rehabilitation and Exercise Training After Hospitalization (REHAB-HF) 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01508650) was recently launched to determine if this 
novel physical rehabilitation intervention will improve physical function and reduce all-
cause hospitalizations in older ADHF patients. Until results from adequately powered trials 
such as REHAB-HF are available, and consistent with CMS policy(21) and the most recent 
society consensus statement(20) we recommend caution regarding immediate or early 
rehabilitation in unselected older hospitalized ADHF patients.
Conclusions
The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, support the feasibility and safety of a 
novel, tailored multi-domain physical rehabilitation intervention starting in the hospital and 
continuing for 12 weeks immediately following discharge in older, frail ADHF patients, who 
may often have severe impairments in multiple physical domains (balance, mobility, strength 
and endurance). They also support the underlying hypothesis that in older ADHF patients, 
severe impairments in physical function are modifiable with a targeted intervention and that 
doing so may improve clinical outcomes. This pilot study informed the design of an ongoing 
clinical trial adequately powered to test if this novel intervention can improve physical 
function and reduce all-cause rehospitalization in older patients hospitalized with ADHF.

 Clinical Perspectives
Clinical Relevance
The present findings support that older patients hospitalized with ADHF have severe and 
widespread impairments in physical function that persist despite conventional HF 
treatment and contribute to adverse clinical outcomes.
Translational Outlook
Further study is needed to determine if sustained and gradually progressive multi-domain 
physical rehabilitation interventions targeting deficits in balance, mobility, strength and 
endurance can improve physical function and clinical outcomes in older patients with 
ADHF.

 Figure 1. 
Comparison of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and 6-Minute Walk distance 
(6MWD). At three months following hospital discharge the intervention effect size was +1.1 
units for the SPPB score (7.4±0.5 vs 6.3±0.5 units) and +23 meters for the 6MWD (247±22 
vs 224±22 meters). Comparisons made with analysis of covariance, with the 3-month value 
as the outcome and the baseline value as the covariate.

 Figure 2. 
Comparison of 6-month all-cause rehospitalizations and rehospitalization days. The 6-month 
all-cause rehospitalization rate was 29% lower in the intervention group (1.16±0.35 vs 
1.64±0.39), yielding an effect size −0.48 hospitalizations. The number of 6-month all-cause 
rehospitalization days were 47% lower per participant (6.0±2.5 vs 11.4±2.8), yielding an 
effect size of −5.4 days. Rehospitalization outcomes were tracked and analyzed for all 27 
participants (Rehab n=15; Control n=12). Comparisons made with analysis of covariance 
with HF category (ejection fraction <45% or >45%) and baseline SPPB score as covariates.
