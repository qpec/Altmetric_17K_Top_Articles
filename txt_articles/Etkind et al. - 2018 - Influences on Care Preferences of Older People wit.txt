OBJECTIVES: To determine and explore the influences
on care preferences of older people with advanced illness
and integrate our results into a model to guide practice
and research.
DESIGN: Systematic review using Medline, Embase, Psy-
chINFO, Web of Science, and OpenGrey databases from
inception to February 2017 and reference and citation list
searching. Included articles investigated influences on care
preference using qualitative or quantitative methodology.
Thematic synthesis of qualitative articles and narrative
synthesis of quantitative articles were undertaken.
SETTING: Hospital and community care settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Older
adults
with
advanced
illness,
including people with specific illnesses and markers of
advanced disease, populations identified as in the last year
of
life,
or
individuals
receiving
palliative
care
(N = 15,164).
MEASUREMENTS: The QualSys criteria were used to
assess study quality.
RESULTS: Of 12,142 search results, 57 articles were
included. Family and care context, illness, and individual
factors interact to influence care preferences. Support from
and burden on family and loved ones were prominent
influences on care preferences. Mechanisms by which pref-
erences are influenced include the process of trading-off
between competing priorities, making choices based on
expected outcome, level of engagement, and individual
ability to form and express preferences.
CONCLUSION: Family is particularly important as an
influence on care preferences, which are influenced by
complex interaction of family, individual, and illness fac-
tors. To support preferences, clinicians should consider
older people with illnesses and their families together as a
unit of care. J Am Geriatr Soc 2018.

W
orldwide demographic changes mean that more peo-
ple are living with and dying from chronic illness
and multimorbidity, and this number is expected to rise.1,2
The prevalence of chronic illness rises with age,3 so deliv-
ery of high-quality care in this growing population group
is a priority.4,5
Care of older people with chronic illness is often com-
plex,6,7 and to deliver person-centered care in this popula-
tion, a clear understanding of the person’s preferences for
care is needed.8 Person-centered care seeks to provide what
is necessary to meet individuals’ physical, psychological,
social, and spiritual needs by focusing on what is impor-
tant to them,5 and care preferences can be defined as what
people want from their care.9 They can be broadly classi-
fied as preferences for the context in which care is deliv-
ered; preferences for care relationships; preferences for
involvement in care; and preferences for care outcomes,
such
as
comfort
versus
extending
life
or
place
of
death.10,11 Observational studies have determined the con-
tent of care preferences in this population.12,13
Nevertheless, people do not simply have preferences,
so we need to know more than the content of preferences
to deliver responsive care. Preferences may become clear
only as they are elicited or may vary in importance at dif-
ferent times. Equally, changes in contextual factors or
experience may influence preferences.14–16 Influences on
care preferences have been investigated in qualitative and
quantitative studies,17–19 particularly factors associated
with preference for home care or home death.20,21 One
model lists illness-related factors, individual factors, and
environmental factors associated with place of death.22
Qualitative studies have highlighted the importance of
family support, personal experience and values as influ-
ences on preferences,23,24 but this evidence is mainly from
small observational studies. This body of evidence has
never been synthesized.

 To deliver care in line with personal preferences, it is
important to understand how they are influenced at a
broader level. Therefore, this review aimed to synthesize
evidence regarding the influences on preferences for care of
older people with advanced illness, producing a model of
the influences on care preferences in this population.
METHODS
This systematic review followed the principles of the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses guidelines25 and was based on a pre-agreed
protocol.
Search strategy and selection of articles
We searched online databases (Medline (Ovid), Embase,
PsycINFO, Web of Science), grey literature repositories (Open
Grey), and theses (EThos database) from inception to Febru-
ary 2017. The search strategy used Medical Subject Headings
and synonyms related to “preferences,” “advanced illness,”
and “older people” and was adapted from search strate-
gies
used
in
previous
systematic
reviews.10,13,26,27
See
Appendix S1 for the full search strategy. No limits were
placed on language or date. We also hand-searched reference
and citation lists of included articles. The search was updated
in December 2017. See Table 1 for inclusion and exclusion
criteria, and article selection process.
Quality assessment
Because this review includes studies of varied design, we
used the validated QualSys guidelines, designed for this
purpose,
to
assess
the
quality
of
included
articles.30
QualSys incorporates separate checklists of criteria for
qualitative and quantitative studies. Each criterion is rated
on a scale from 0 to 2, and a total score is calculated. The
research team agreed that a score of 75% or greater was
required for high quality and 60% or greater for medium
quality. No articles were excluded on quality, although we
used QualSys scores, alongside quantity and agreement of
evidence, to appraise the strength of evidence supporting
the
quantitative
synthesis,
based
on
existing
criteria
designed for this purpose.22,31
Data extraction and analysis
Data were extracted from included articles using a bespoke
pro forma that the research team agreed on in advance.
Basic data from each study (e.g., authors, country, sample
size) were extracted. For quantitative articles, findings
regarding influences on care preferences were extracted.
For qualitative studies, the entire Results or Findings sec-
tion was extracted for thematic synthesis.
The “three synthesis” approach proposed for reviews
of mixed studies was used in the analysis.32 Thus two ini-
tial syntheses were undertaken, one each for quantitative
and qualitative studies, followed by a third integrative
synthesis.33–36
Thematic synthesis, supported by NVIVO Software
version 10 (QSR International (UK) Ltd.), was used for
qualitative synthesis. This involved reading, re-reading,
and then coding all relevant text within the Results sec-
tions of included articles. We first coded inductively,
allowing for themes to emerge from the data.35 Deductive
coding, based on existing models, was then applied to
ensure relevance to previous work.22,23,35 In particular, we
used the Gomes model, which identifies illness, individual,
and environmental influences on place of death,22 and the
experience, health condition, and family components of
the Hattori model.23 Inductive and deductive coding were
combined to produce a final model that fit with the origi-
nal data. Using the entire Results section for analysis
meant that raw data and author interpretations were syn-
thesized, allowing us to build on existing work.35,37
For the quantitative synthesis, the variation in out-
comes across included articles precluded meaningful meta-
analysis. Therefore a descriptive synthesis of factors asso-
ciated with care preferences was undertaken. Factors were
grouped by preference category, and the direction of the
effect was recorded. Associations were linked to the
strength of evidence supporting them.
Table 1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria
•
Study population aged ≥65, or median age ≥65 if mixed population (excluded if >25% of participants aged <60,
or >10% aged <40).
•
Study is of people with advanced illness, including people with specific illnesses and markers of advanced disease,
populations identified as in the last year of life, or populations identified as palliative care populations. See Appendix S2
for detailed definition.
•
Study focuses primarily on what influences care preferences. We were interested in the broad areas of care context,
relationships, and outcomes, rather than specific preferences about individual treatments or management options,
and included preferences relating to any aspect of care, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual.
See Appendix S2 for detailed definition.
Exclusion criteria
•
Review articles and editorials.
•
Articles focusing only on concordance of preferences between patients and family or clinicians.
•
Studies in healthy older people, on the basis that those with good health may have perspectives on care preferences
different from perspectives of those with advanced illness.15
•
Studies of preferences for specific treatments including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which have been
synthesised elsewhere.28,29
Articles were screened by title and abstract, and those unrelated to influences on care preferences were discarded. Full texts of remaining articles were
assessed for inclusion by one researcher (SE), with 10% cross-checking by another researcher (AB). Disagreements were resolved by discussion within the
multidisciplinary research team. When full text was unavailable, an attempt was made to contact the original authors. Attempts were also made to find
follow-up articles from relevant conference abstracts.

 In the integration stage, findings from the quantitative
synthesis were mapped onto the qualitative model to pro-
duce an integrated model of the influences on care prefer-
ences,
using existing
models as a starting point.22,23
Triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data was used
to identify areas where evidence from different methodol-
ogy concurred and areas where there was disagreement.
RESULTS
The search retrieved 8,723 records once duplicates were
removed; 391 full-text articles were reviewed, and of these,
26 qualitative
papers, 30
quantitative papers, and 1
mixed-methods analysis were included (Figure 1). Included
papers were published between 1995 and 2017. In total
14,474, unique participants were included in the quantita-
tive papers and 857 in the qualitative papers. Twenty-five
(44%) studies were conducted in North America, 19
(33%) in Europe, 8 (14%) in Asia, and 3 (5%) in Aus-
tralasia, and 2 (4%) collected data internationally.
The 27 qualitative papers (Table 2) investigated influ-
ences on preferences for care context (place of care), care
involvement (communication and decision-making), and care
outcomes (quality of life, place of death). Thirteen papers
were of high quality, 13 of medium quality, and 1 of low
quality. All studies used interviews, ranging from structured
interviews to unstructured in-depth interviews. The 30
quantitative papers (see Appendix S3 for details) varied in
sample size from 38 to 2,452, and methodology ranged from
in-person questionnaires to national postal surveys. Sixteen
were high quality, 11 medium quality, and 3 low quality.
Based on qualitative, quantitative, and integration syn-
theses, we produced a model of the influences on prefer-
ences
for
care,
which
extends
the
Gomes
model
of
influences on place of death.22 Factors influencing care
preferences relating to family and care context, the individ-
ual, and the illness were identified and explored. We also
identified mechanisms by which preferences are influenced
(Figure 2). The synthesis indicates that it is the norm in
this
population
for
preferences
to
be
incompletely
expressed, and a clear decision-making process regarding
preferences is rare. Instead, preferences emerge from a
complex interaction of the areas and mechanisms identified
in this model, as described below.
Three areas describe the influences on care preferences in
this population: family and care context, the individual, and
the illness. How these are derived from the included qualita-
tive papers and aligned to the model is outlined below.
Family and care context
The strongest influences on preferences came from concerns
of and about family, and the wider care environment. We
found that trusting care relationships influence preferences

 for communication and that the level of support available
from health professionals and family is an important deter-
minant of preferences for care. The wish to avoid being a
burden often influenced preferences, and the views of and
concerns about family were of paramount importance:
Just to keep my daughter as calm as possible—that’s
the main thing. I don’t want to upset her any more
than I have to. What can you do? Your parents die,
that’s going to happen, so . . . there is nothing to be
done about it, but I want to, want her to be as calm
as possible. (82-year-old female) Gardner et al.43
Frequently, concerns about family were more promi-
nent than individuals’ own concerns about care preferences.
Although patients’ wishes may not be their prefer-
ence, such was their concern about their carer and
not wanting to become a burden; they were not
prepared to consider any other option for place of
end-of-life care. McCall et al.53
The Individual
Characteristics of individuals such as age influenced pref-
erences in some cases. Past experience of care, especially
caring for others at the end of life, influenced preferences
for one’s own care, whether relevant to one’s situation or
not.

 One of the most universal and influential events in the
lives of the residents was the death of a family member
or close friend. This influence was attributed to grief,
and by facts about end-of-life decisions and death
learned from the experience. In many cases, the situa-
tion of the loved one was not comparable with the res-
ident’s current situation. Nevertheless, many residents
applied the experience of the deceased as if it were
identical to their own situation. The opinions gener-
ated by these experiences were so strong that they
were not overridden by factual information about the
residents’ own health. Lambert et al.50
Perceptions of care, often based on experience, were
seen to shape preferences, sometimes very strongly.
Beliefs about what medical care was possible . . .
shaped preferences so fundamentally that a number
of respondents could not form a preference distinct
from these beliefs. Fried et al. (1998).42
Personal values, which are often long-held views, were
another strong influence on preferences, for example a
value of maintaining comfort may result in prioritization
of quality over quantity of life.
The desire to “die easily, without suffering” was
the most prevalent underlying wish, and one which
never changed. Hattori et al.23
A long-held desire to maintain independence may
influence preference for place of care.
I want to be self-sufficient. I don’t want to be sick.
Until I’m overwhelmed, I want to be able to deal
with it [my illness] on my terms (CA1030).54
The Illness
The illness context strongly influenced preferences, particu-
larly for those who were aware of their disease status and
accepted their situation.
But you know it has to end sometime when you are
80 and are also terminally ill [cancer]. Then you
know that you have to accept it. [interview 25]
Piers et al.55
Concerns about future changes in health were another
area influencing care preferences.
A number of participants wished to be placed in a
nursing facility when the time came, assuming their
physical
functions
would
deteriorate
and
they
would require nursing care in the future. Hattori
et al.23
MECHANISMS
In the qualitative synthesis, we identified mechanisms by
which these areas interact, namely, expectations, trade-offs,
engagement, and ability to form and express preferences.
Expectations
Personal experience, perceptions, illness context, and level
of knowledge combined to produce expectations about the
future, which guided care preferences, especially with
regard to place of care.
Preferences for site of care depended on the antici-
pated outcome of the illness episode. Fried et al.
1998.42
Maintaining and maximising personal dignity given
the prospect of loss of control over bodily func-
tions, of extreme pain, or of ‘going mad,’ was
bound up with a preference to place their final care
in the hands of professionals in a hospice setting.
Thomas et al.59
Trade-Offs
Personal values, illness context, and the wider care envi-
ronment may be traded off in formulation of preferences.
Presence and support of family exerted a strong influence
on preferences, and the views of loved ones may supersede
personal views and perceptions.
I would prefer to be at home. Um, but then again,
by the same token, if hubby doesn’t think he can
cope, which, it may come to that point, where he
can’t cope, with the whole physical thing, the men-
tal thing of me being at home, then I will willingly
come in [again]. (Female, married, 51–60). Broom
et al.38
Engagement
Preferences were not always actively expressed, and disen-
gagement, or “living in the moment,” was common. Leav-
ing decisions to chance or delegating to others may result.
I never thought about that. I think it should be left
to the doctor. Fleming et al.40
Conversely, some seek to keep control and maintain
independence
and
may
express
stronger
preferences.
Engagement also depends on temporal focus, acceptance
of the illness context and personal self-efficacy.
I am my own boss, am I not? My children don’t
control me. I decide what I want. Whether they like
it or not, yes it’s my decision. It’s my body. That’s
my opinion and no one can help me with that, no.
[interview 30]. Piers et al.55
Ability to form and express preferences
Illness, cognitive impairment, or disengagement commonly
resulted in low self-efficacy, such that preferences were not
formed or expressed. Expectations, trade-offs, and engage-
ment were less relevant to this group, who were unable to
form preferences using these mechanisms.
The data suggested that perceptions of self-efficacy
may influence not only the likelihood of setting
explicit
goals
but
also
the
nature
of
goals
themselves. Low self-efficacy resulted in either the
setting of no or less challenging goals. Bradley
et al.24
The quantitative synthesis also identified factors asso-
ciated with care preferences, which we used to confirm

 and extend this model. In particular, sociodemographic
variables (including age, sex, religiosity, educational level,
presence or absence of social support) were associated
with preferences for care. The associations supported by
moderate or high strength evidence are presented in Fig-
ure 3. For a full list of associations, see Appendix S4. In
particular, education and social class were associated with
preferences for greater involvement in communication,
whereas a higher level of social and family support was
associated with preferences for home care and home
death.
Triangulation between qualitative and quantitative
syntheses provides support for this model of influences on
care preference. Variables related to family (presence of
family, trust in family, living with a partner, marital sta-
tus) were associated with preference for home death, with
strong evidence, in line with the extensive discussion of the
influence of family in the qualitative data. Illness factors
including diagnosis, comorbidity level, and disease severity
were associated with care preferences, in line with qualita-
tive findings, although the specific associations were incon-
sistent, resulting in weaker evidence.
DISCUSSION
This
systematic
review
and
thematic
synthesis
brings
together, for the first time, qualitative and quantitative evi-
dence regarding influences on care preferences in older
people with advanced illness. Family and care context,
particularly support from family, are dominant influences
on care preferences in this population. These factors inter-
act with individual—sociodemographic characteristics, per-
sonal experience, and values—and illness-related factors to
influence care preferences. We identify four mechanisms
affecting how these areas interact, conscious or uncon-
scious trade-offs, consideration of what is expected to
occur, engagement with preferences, and ability to form or
express preferences.
The great importance of family support is evident in
qualitative and quantitative data. “Living with someone”
was the only factor associated with a care preference with
high strength evidence. In the qualitative synthesis, con-
cerns about family and concerns of family were strong
enough to cause many people to change their preferences.
The nuances of family relationships are therefore impor-
tant in determining preferences. This supports the concept
in the palliative care literature that the unit of care should
be the person and his or her family, not the person
alone.62 Previous work has demonstrated the importance
of family in decision-making63,64 but has not demonstrated
the influence of family support on a wide range of
preferences.
Our findings highlight the overarching importance of
family and perceived family support when discussing pref-
erences in practice, and it is clear that family should be
part of these conversations. Because concerns about family
may result in people expressing preferences different from
their underlying wishes, clinicians cannot necessarily take
stated preferences at face value. Instead, they should con-
sider how they can best provide support to patients and
their families to allow patients to achieve their preferences,
particularly when there is conflict in views between indi-
viduals and those close to them.
We also identify potential areas clinicians could focus
on to support patient preferences. It may be impossible to
change illness or individual factors, but it is potentially
possible to make positive changes to care and to support
family involvement.65 An individual whose preference for
place of care is home but is concerned about the effect on
his or her family may trade off and change his or her pref-
erence to institutional care. Discussion about how the fam-
ily may be better supported might allow the individual to
stay in their preferred place of care.
The mechanisms we identify in this synthesis extend
existing theory. Economic theories of preference, such as
expectancy value theory, consider preferences as a process
of trading off expected outcome and the value one would
place on that outcome.66 Expectations are highlighted as a
mechanism for “response shift,”16 and cognitive theories of
preference also consider the process of trading off to be
important,67 although these theories do not consider the
importance of individual engagement and the ability to
form and express preferences, which came across strongly
in our synthesis. Older people, especially those with cogni-
tive impairment, may choose to cede control or may not
wish to consider preferences overtly. Others may be cogni-
tively unable to express preferences.44 In this situation, the
importance of the care context and family support grows.8
Our model therefore highlights the importance of broader,
nonrational processes influencing preferences,9,68 as well as
the trade-offs and expectation-based mechanisms proposed
in economic and cognitive models.

 This review has found considerable research into care
preferences in this population, but many studies are small
and not of high quality, with inconsistent reporting of
nonsignificant findings. Some areas that might be expected
to influence preferences—ethnicity, culture, religion—were
not prominent in this synthesis, although there was some
evidence that religiosity is associated with preference for
place of care. This probably represents absence of evi-
dence, rather than evidence that these areas do not influ-
ence preferences, and further study is needed.
Most included quantitative studies are cross-sectional,
which limits the inferences that can be drawn from associ-
ations. The influence of time on preferences is evident in
some of the qualitative data, but it is unclear how the vari-
ous influences on preference interact to affect the stability
of preferences over time. Studies that collect data serially
show that a large minority of participants change their
preferences,69,70 so it is important to know how changes
in illness, individual, family, and environmental factors
over time may affect preference stability. Further prospec-
tive research is needed to describe and explore influences
on the stability of care preferences in this population.
A strength of this review is the systematic methodol-
ogy, resulting in a robust model based on international
qualitative and quantitative data. The three synthesis
approach allowed triangulation between methodologies,
which increased the robustness of our model. Inclusion of
articles investigating a range of care preferences increased
the scope of the model and its applicability. Although the
evidence in this area is spread across fields and is challeng-
ing to identify, our use of a systematic, evidence-based
search strategy without limitations on language or publica-
tion date means that we are confident we have identified
the relevant evidence, although it is possible that some
studies were missed. We found that quantitative studies
inconsistently reported nonsignificant findings. Our synthe-
sis therefore focused primarily on significant findings,
which may have introduced a bias against negative find-
ings, although including the nonsignificant findings that
were reported did not affect our final model. Focusing on
a more specific set of care preferences might have resulted
in a more precise, albeit less broadly applicable synthesis.
Additionally, thematic analysis of published articles inevi-
tably limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the
data because there is no access to the original data set.
In conclusion, this systematic review shows the impor-
tance of family and care context, particularly family support,
as influences on care preferences. These factors combine with
individual and illness-related factors to influence preferences
through mechanisms of trade-offs, expectations, engagement,
and the ability to form and express preferences. Clinicians
must take these factors and mechanisms into account when
considering preferences. Influences on the stability of care
preferences are unclear, and further investigation with
prospective longitudinal research is needed.
