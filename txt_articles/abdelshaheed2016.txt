Efficacy, Tolerability, and Dose-Dependent Effects
of Opioid Analgesics for Low Back Pain
A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Christina Abdel Shaheed, PhD; Chris G. Maher, PhD; Kylie A. Williams, PhD; Richard Day, MD; Andrew J. McLachlan, PhD
IMPORTANCE Opioid analgesics are commonly used for low back pain, however, to our
knowledge there has been no systematic evaluation of the effect of opioid dose and use of
enrichment study design on estimates of treatment effect.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of opioids in the management of back pain;
and investigate the effect of opioid dose and use of an enrichment study design on treatment
effect.
DATA SOURCES Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (inception to
September 2015) with citation tracking from eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
STUDY SELECTION Placebo-controlled RCTs in any language.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently extracted data and assessed
risk of bias. Data were pooled using a random effects model with strength of evidence
assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation
(GRADE).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was pain. Pain and disability
outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale, with effects greater than 20 points
considered clinically important.
RESULTS Of 20 included RCTs of opioid analgesics (with a total of 7925 participants), 13 trials
(3419 participants) evaluated short-term effects on chronic low back pain, and no
placebo-controlled trials enrolled patients with acute low back pain. In half of these 13 trials,
at least 50% of participants withdrew owing to adverse events or lack of efficacy. There was
moderate-quality evidence that opioid analgesics reduce pain in the short term; mean
difference (MD), −10.1 (95% CI, −12.8 to −7.4). Meta-regression revealed a 12.0 point greater
pain relief for every 1 log unit increase in morphine equivalent dose (P = .046). Clinically
important pain relief was not observed within the dose range evaluated (40.0-240.0-mg
morphine equivalents per day). There was no significant effect of enrichment study design.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For people with chronic low back pain who tolerate the
medicine, opioid analgesics provide modest short-term pain relief but the effect is not likely
to be clinically important within guideline recommended doses. Evidence on long-term
efficacy is lacking. The efficacy of opioid analgesics in acute low back pain is unknown.

L
ow back pain is a common health problem and the lead-
ing cause of disability worldwide.1,2 While manage-
mentguidelinesencouragetheprescriptionofsimplean-
algesics for low back pain (eg, paracetamol or nonsteroidal
antiinflammatorydrugs[NSAIDs]),manypeoplewithlowback
pain are prescribed opioid analgesics.3,4 Findings from the
United States show that more than half of the people regu-
larly treated with prescription opioid analgesics have chronic
lowbackpain.4SimilarlyinAustraliathe3mostcommonlypre-
scribed drugs for back pain are opioid analgesics or opioid an-
algesiccombinations:oxycodone(11.7%),tramadol(8.2%),and
paracetamol and codeine combination (12.1%) (percent of all
prescribed medicines for back pain).5,6
Despite the widespread use of opioid analgesics for people
with low back pain, there remains uncertainty about 3 central
issues that would guide rational prescribing of these medi-
cines for the treatment of people with low back pain. Two re-
cent high-quality systematic reviews have shown that, be-
causeofalackoftrials,thereisuncertaintyregardingtheefficacy
of opioid analgesics for people with acute low back pain7 and
also when these medicines are used long term for chronic low
backpain.8Thereisalsouncertaintyregardingtheoptimaldos-
ing of opioid analgesics because, to our knowledge, there has
been no systematic evaluation of how the dose of these medi-
cines may influence the size of any treatment effect for people
with low back pain.9-14 Finally, there has been little consider-
ation of the extent to which an unselected group of opioid-
naïve people with low back pain would tolerate or respond to
an opioid medicine. For example, many opioid trials use an en-
richmentstudydesignandexcludeparticipantswhodonottol-
erateoradequatelyrespondtotheopioidanalgesicintherun-in
phase. Some trials also exclude participants who do not re-
spondtoortoleratetheopioidanalgesicintherandomizedphase
of a trial, and therefore the estimate of treatment efficacy is de-
rived from only a proportion of participants who were en-
rolled in the study to receive opioid analgesics.
The aims of this systematic review were to (1) evaluate the
efficacy of opioid analgesics in the management of low back
pain, (2) investigate the effect of opioid dose and enrichment
study design on treatment effect, and (3) quantify treatment
discontinuation (owing to adverse events and lack of effi-
cacy)andlosstofollow-upintherun-inandrandomizedphases
of trials.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Re-
views, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (inception to end
September 2015) were searched for randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) evaluating opioid analgesic medicines for nonspecific
low back pain (eTable 1 in the Supplement). In addition we
screened reference lists of included RCTs and relevant sys-
tematic reviews to identify additional RCTs (Figure 1). We in-
cluded only RCTs enrolling patients with nonspecific low back
pain15 (ie, low back pain where a cause [eg, fracture, infec-
tion] had not been identified).
After screening titles and abstracts of retrieved studies, 2
reviewers drawn from a pool of 3 reviewers (C.A.S., A.J.M., and
C.G.M.) independently inspected the full articles of poten-
tially eligible RCTs to determine eligibility, with disagree-
ments resolved by consensus.
Study Selection
We included studies in any language evaluating single-
ingredient or combination medicines containing an opioid an-
algesic for nonspecific acute or chronic low back pain. Study
selection was not restricted by pain duration, comorbid con-
dition(s), or concurrent nonopioid or nonanalgesic medica-
tion use (eg, to treat hypertension) provided that participants
were stabilized on these medications and the pattern of use
was unchanged throughout the study. We included the ana-
tomicaltherapeuticchemical(ATC)16codesfordrugclassesrel-
evant to this review in the search.

Key Points
Question What is the efficacy, tolerability, and dose-dependent
effects of opioid analgesics for low back pain?
Findings In this systematic review we found that recommended
doses of opioid analgesics (range 40.0-240.0-mg morphine
equivalents/day) did not provide clinically meaningful pain relief
(> 20 points on a 0-100 point pain scale) in people with chronic
low back pain.
Meaning For people with chronic low back pain who tolerate the
medicine, opioid analgesics provide modest short-term pain relief,
but the effect is not likely to be clinically important within
guideline-recommended doses.

Placebo-controlledRCTsandRCTscomparing2drugsfrom
the same class or different doses of the same drug were eli-
gible for inclusion. Trials were included if they reported pain,
disability, or adverse events outcomes. Trials involving pa-
tients with a range of pain conditions were included if results
for participants with low back pain could be separately
extracted.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers (C.A.S., C.G.M.) independently extracted out-
comes data from published studies. Missing data were ob-
tained by contacting authors or estimated using the methods
described in the Cochrane Handbook.17 Analysis of data from
a crossover trial was performed according to recommenda-
tions in the Cochrane Handbook.17
Risk of bias was assessed using the 11-item PEDro scale
(eTable 2 in the Supplement),18-20 a valid and reliable method
of rating methodological quality of individual RCTs.18-20 Each
item (excluding the item for external validity) was scored as
either present (1) or absent (0) to give a total score out of 10.
Rating of trials was carried out by 2 independent raters (C.A.S.
plus A.J.M. or C.G.M.) with disagreements resolved by an in-
dependent third rater (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Trials scor-
ing less than 7 out of 10 on the PEDro scale were considered
to be at high risk of bias; those scoring 7 or more were consid-
ered to be at low risk of bias.18
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0
to 100 scale (0, no pain or disability, to 100, worst possible pain
or disability). The pain intensity measures used in the re-
trieved trials were visual analog scale (VAS) scores (scale range,
0-100) and numerical rating scale (NRS) scores (range, 0-10).
The NRS was converted to the same 0 to100 scale as in the VAS
because these 2 pain measures have been shown to be highly
correlated and, when transformed, can be used inter-
changeably.21 The disability measures used to calculate pooled
effectswereOswestryDisabilityIndexscores(range,0-100)and
Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores (range,
0-24). The RMDQ scores were converted to the same 0 to 100
scale as in the Oswestry Disability Index because these 2 ques-
tionnaires are highly correlated and share similar psychomet-
ric properties.22
We present results as mean differences (MDs) rather than
standardized mean differences (SMDs) because the bench-
marks for clinically important difference in pain and disabil-
ity are expressed in points on a 0 to 100 scale, not proportions
of a standard deviation.12,13 We considered a 10-point differ-
ence on this 0 to 100 point scale as a ”minimal” difference and
a 20-point difference as “clinically important” difference, con-
sistent with the proposed thresholds for clinically important
changes in the chronic pain12 and low back pain literature.13 To
reflect the way that patients typically rate their pain, we con-
sidered differences of less than 10 points (out of 100) on the
pain or disability scale as unlikely to be noticed by most pa-
tients; some patients would notice a difference in the range of
10 to 20, points and most people are likely to notice a differ-
ence greater than 20 points on the pain or disability scale.
Weconsideredshort-termpainrelief(follow-up < 3months)
as the primary outcome. Outcomes were grouped into 3 time
categories (with respect to follow-up): short-term (<3 months)
intermediate-term(≥3months,<12months),andlong-term(≥12
months).Wheremultipletimepointswereavailableforasingle
category, the time closest to 6 weeks was chosen for short-
term follow-up, 6 months for the intermediate-term, and 12
months for the long-term. We conducted a separate analysis
to calculate treatment effect sizes for placebo-controlled trials
evaluating combination opioid analgesics containing a simple
analgesic (eg, paracetamol).
Where there were multiple comparisons from a single
study, we divided the number of participants in the common
arm by the number of comparisons, according to recommen-
dations in the Cochrane Handbook.17 Meta-analysis was car-
ried out using RevMan review management software (ver-
sion 5.1) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version
3, Biostat).23 Pooled effects were calculated using a random ef-
fects model. Where possible, we explored possible causes of
heterogeneity where I2 values were greater than 40%.
We used the grading of recommendations assessment, de-
velopment, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria24 to evaluate the
overallqualityoftheevidenceforanintervention.Thismethod
is described elsewhere,25,26 but briefly the quality of evi-
dence was downgraded a level for each of 4 factors: poor study
design (≥25% of trials, weighted by sample size, had a low
PEDro score [<7 of 10]), inconsistency of results (≥25% of the
trials, weighted by sample size, had results which were not in
the same direction), imprecision (sample size <300), and pub-
lication bias (assessed using funnel plot analysis/ Egger re-
gression test). Where Egger regression 2-tailed P value was less
than .10, the overall quality of evidence was downgraded by 1
level.27 We did not assess for indirectness (when the trial con-
text is not the same as the review question) because this re-
view encompassed a specific population. The quality of evi-
dence was defined as “high quality,
” “moderate quality,
” “low
quality,” and “very low quality.”24
As our primary analysis, the pooled effect of single-
ingredient opioid analgesics was evaluated at short-term fol-
low-up. To evaluate the effect of opioid dose we converted all
doses of opioid analgesics to morphine equivalent doses28 and
conducted metaregression to determine the effects of the log-
transformedmorphineequivalentdoseontreatmenteffectsize
(for single ingredient opioid analgesic trials). We also con-
ducted a simple stratified analysis exploring pooled effects at
100 mg or more and less than 100 mg morphine equivalents
per day.
For each trial we collated the number of participants re-
ceiving an opioid analgesic who were withdrawn from the trial
because of adverse events, lack of efficacy, or were lost to fol-
low-up, in both the run-in and trial phase of a study. The pro-
portion remaining were those who contributed data to the tri-
al’
s estimate of treatment efficacy. In addition, we explored the
effects of study design (enrichment design [in which patients
who tolerate and respond to the trial medicine in the run-in
phase are allowed to continue to the randomization phase of
the study] vs nonenrichment) on treatment effect using
metaregression. At the same time we investigated the effect

of opioid dose on treatment effect. We entered both items in
the 1 model and report results from this multivariate model.
Results
A total of 20 trials of opioid analgesics (a total of 7295 partici-
pants) were included in this review (see Table). Nineteen opi-
oidanalgesictrialsevaluatedparticipantswithchroniclowback
pain, and 1 head-to-head trial evaluated participants with sub-
acute low back pain. Seventeen RCTs compared an opioid
analgesic with placebo and 3 trials compared 2 opioid anal-
gesics.29-31 None of the trials evaluated long-term use or out-
comes, the maximum treatment period was 12 weeks, and the
maximum follow-up was also 12 weeks. Seventeen of the 20
trials reported industry funding. The medicines used in these
trials were oral hydromorphone,32 oxymorphone,29,33,34
morphine,30,35 tramadol monotherapy31,36-38 or in combina-
tion with paracetamol,31,39-41 tapentadol,42 oxycodone mono-
therapy,42-44 oxycodone in combination with naloxone,45 or
naltrexone,44 transdermal buprenorphine,43,46,47 transder-
mal fentanyl,30 and hydrocodone.48 The trials were typically
of high quality with a mean (SD) PEDro score of 7.8 (1.5). The
PEDro ratings are summarized in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Treatment Efficacy: Pain and Disability Outcomes
Pain Outcomes
There is moderate-quality evidence from 13 studies of chronic
low back pain (3419 participants) of an effect of single-
ingredientopioidanalgesicsonpainintheshortterm;meandif-
ference (MD), −10.1 (95% CI, −12.8 to −7.4) (Figure 2). There is
high-quality evidence from 6 studies (2605 participants) that
single-ingredient opioid analgesics relieve pain in the interme-
diate term; MD, −8.1 (95% CI, −10.2 to −6.0). Combination opi-
oid analgesics containing a simple analgesic showed moderate
evidenceofpainreliefintheintermediateterm;MD,−11.9(95%
CI, −19.3 to −4.4). Results from a single trial of the combination
oftramadol/paracetamolprovidedverylowqualityevidenceof
pain relief for the short term; MD, −8 (95% CI, −16.2 to 0.2).41
The effects of single-ingredient and combination opioids were
minimalandapproximatelyhalfthe20-pointthresholdforclini-
cal importance. A funnel plot of standard error by treatment
effect for the short and intermediate term is shown in eFigures
1and2intheSupplement,respectively.Theevidenceforshort-
term efficacy was downgraded 1 level for publication bias
(Egger P= .007). There were no long-term outcomes data.
Disability Outcomes
There were limited data on disability outcomes. Results from
a single trial showed no significant effect of the combination
oftramadol-paracetamol41ondisabilityfortheshortterm;MD,
−6.2 (95% CI, −8.5 to 20.9), and results from another single
trial40 of the tramadol-paracetamol combination showed no
significant effect for the intermediate term; MD, −3.7 (−11.8 to
4.4). The evidence from these trials is of very low quality.
A single study of morphine35 showed no clinically significant
reduction in disability for the short term; MD, −6.3 (95% CI,
0.5-12.1), with the evidence being of very low quality.
See eTable 4 in the Supplement for overall grading of evi-
dence and eTable 5 in the Supplement for morphine equiva-
lent conversions.
Effect of Opioid Dose and Enrichment Study Design
on Short-Term Treatment Efficacy
In the 13 RCTs evaluating short-term efficacy, the morphine-
equivalent dose ranged from 40.0 mg to 242.7 mg per day.
Sevenofthe13RCTsusedanenrichmentstudydesignwhereby
only the participants who responded favorably to the study
medication,andtoleratedthemedicineinthetrialrun-inphase
(prerandomization) were eligible to continue in the trial proper
and be randomized to the study treatment. Trial results
grouped by log opioid dose and enrichment study design are
shown in Figure 3A and B, respectively. Results from the strati-
fied analysis are shown in Figure 3C. The meta-regression
model, including log opioid dose and enrichment study de-
sign, showed there was a significant effect of opioid dose on
treatment effect, with a 12.0 point greater pain relief for ev-
ery 1 log unit increase in dose (P = .046) (ie, 10 mg of mor-
phine equivalents). The model predicts that clinically impor-
tant effects are not seen within the dose range evaluated
(≤240-mg morphine equivalents per day). The effect of en-
richmentstudydesignwasnotstatisticallysignificant(P = .69).
Together,logmorphine-equivalentdoseandenrichmentstudy
design accounted for 11% of variance in treatment effect.
Results from the multivariate analysis exploring dichoto-
mous dose and enrichment study design showed no statisti-
cally significant effect of dose (P = .52) or enrichment study
design (P = .40).
Treatment Discontinuation and Loss to Follow-up
The proportion of participants given an opioid analgesic who
were withdrawn from a trial owing to adverse events or lack
of efficacy and the proportion lost to follow-up are shown in
Figure 4 with more detailed information in eTable 6 in the
Supplement. In the 8 trials (10 treatment contrasts) using an
enrichment study design, only 20.3% to 48.4% remained in
the trial and contributed data to the efficacy estimate, and in
the nonenrichment study design this was 39.8% to 75.0%. Ir-
respective of study design, the predominant causes for drop-
out were adverse events or lack of efficacy, with half of trials
having 50% of participants drop out owing to these 2 rea-
sons. Even in the enrichment trials, where participants en-
teredthetrialonlyiftheytoleratedandrespondedtothemedi-
cine in the run-in phase, from 31.4% to 61.9% withdrew owing
to adverse events and 3.3% to 29.6% withdrew owing to lack
of efficacy in the randomized phase of the trial.
Eight trials32-34,37,38,40,42,47 provided details on the pro-
portion of participants experiencing at least 1 adverse event
in the run-in and/or RCT phase. Overall, the median rates (in-
terquartilerange[IQR])ofadverseeventsintheRCTphasewere
49.1% (44.0%-55.0%) for placebo and 68.9.% (55.0%-85.0%)
for treatment groups (risk ratio [RR], 1.3; P < .01). Common ad-
verse events reported by participants in opioid analgesic trials
included central nervous system adverse events (headache,
somnolence, dizziness), gastrointestinal tract adverse events
(constipation, nausea, vomiting), and autonomic adverse

Head-to-Head Trials
Treatment effects for head-to-head opioid analgesic trials
are shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. There was a sta-
tistically significant difference in treatment outcome
between different strengths of transdermal buprenorphine
for both the short and intermediate term, with the 20-μg/h
patch providing greater pain relief than the 5-μg/h patch
(MD, 4.8 [95% CI, 0.6-9.0] and MD, 6.7 [95% CI, 2.3-11.2],
respectively). Oxycodone, 40 mg per day, provided greater
pain relief than transdermal buprenorphine, 5-μg/h, for both
the short and intermediate term (MD, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.6-10.2]
and MD, 7.6 [95% CI, 3.0-12.2], respectively). An evaluation
of morphine equivalent conversions (eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment) showed similar mean daily morphine equivalents for
these trials, providing a plausible explanation for the small
difference.
Discussion
This review has found that there is evidence that opioid an-
algesics relieve pain in the short and intermediate term for
people with chronic (but not acute) low back pain, but it is un-
certain if they improve disability. Treatment effects are small,
being half the threshold for clinical importance. The medi-
cines are also commonly associated with adverse events. We
found some evidence of a greater effect of opioid analgesics
with larger doses; however, the effects are not likely to be clini-
cally important even at high doses. A detailed analysis of drop-
outs from trials revealed that under half of participants enter-
ing these trials contributed to treatment effect size estimates.
There is no evidence on long-term use and limited evidence
for acute low back pain.
The strengths of this review include a consideration of opi-
oid dose and study design as well as a comprehensive search
strategycoveringsingle-ingredientandcombinationopioidan-
algesics used to treat low back pain. The PEDro scale was used
to assess risk of bias because it has acceptably high clinomet-
ric properties,18-20 whereas limitations have been reported for
the Cochrane risk of bias scale.49,50 Limitations of this review
include possible publication bias, as only studies published in
peer-reviewedjournalswereincluded.Alimitationofthemeta-
regression is that it does not account for variability in dose re-
sponse as a result of duration of treatment or intrinsic factors
(eg, genetic variability).
Our review challenges the prevailing view that opioid
medicines are powerful analgesics for low back pain. Opioid
analgesics had minimal effects on pain, and even at high
doses the magnitude of the effect is less than the accepted
thresholds for a clinically important treatment effect on pain.

Importantly, the magnitude of the treatment effect we
observed is similar to that reported for NSAIDs vs placebo in
the Cochrane review of NSAIDs.51 This review focuses on the
magnitude and clinical significance of treatment effects12,13
and presents a more detailed evaluation of run-in failure,
treatment discontinuation, and loss to follow-up compared
with existing reviews.7,9,10 Typically, the trials’estimate of
treatment effect was derived from approximately 50% of par-
ticipants who initially entered the trial, with participants
withdrawn mainly because they did not tolerate or respond to
the medicine. Taken together, these issues suggest there
would be much lower treatment effects among unselected
groups of people new to these medicines.52
An unexpected finding of our study was that the use of an
enrichment design was not associated with an exaggerated
treatment effect. This result is in alignment with that of a study
comparing enriched and nonenriched trials of opioid analge-
sics for chronic noncancer pain, in which it was similarly noted
that enriched study designs do not significantly influence the
estimates of treatment efficacy.53
An important feature of this review is that we also con-
ducted a metaregression to explore association between the
opioid analgesic dose and treatment effect and found there is
a 12.0-point increase in pain relief for every 1 log unit
increase in morphine-equivalent dose. Adjusting for use of
an enrichment design, the predicted treatment effect was a

6.7-point increase in pain relief at 40-mg morphine equiva-
lent units and a 16.1-point increase in pain relief at 240-mg
morphine equivalent units. The metaregression findings sug-
gest that while increasing dose was associated with greater
effect, even at the higher doses the effect of opioid was less
than the 20-point criterion we adopted for a clinically impor-
tant effect. However, it is important to note that these are
group mean differences, and some individuals may experi-
ence meaningful pain relief from clinically used doses
whereas others may get very minimal relief or no relief at all.
Concerns over adverse events and misuse continue to rise in
line with the increased use and misuse of these medi-
cines.11,54 However, despite the widespread use of opioid
analgesics there has been uncertainty about their clinical
benefits for low back pain until now. This review dispels the
common public misconception that opioid analgesics are
powerful analgesics, showing this is not the case for chronic
low back pain and that clinically significant pain relief is not
likely to be achieved at higher doses of opioid analgesics,
which can be associated with potentially harmful effects
(240-mg morphine equivalents per day).55 The latest review
of opioid prescribing guidelines55 cautions against exceeding
200 mg of morphine equivalents per day as a way of alleviat-
ing the risk of opioid-related complications, such as life-
threatening respiratory depression. Higher doses of opioid
analgesics have also been associated with misuse, physical
dependence, hyperalgesia, and clinically significant hor-
monal changes.55-63 In 2010, there were 16 65164 opioid-
related deaths reported in the United States. Of concern are
the paradoxical effects of opioid analgesics including opioid-
induced hyperalgesia,65 a vexing issue thought to propagate
the cycle of misuse and dependency on these medications.
There is currently no evidence to support the long-term use
of opioid analgesics in low back pain at any dose. Our review
highlights the need to revise existing guidelines to acknowl-
edge that (1) the effect of opioid analgesics in chronic low
back pain is modest and not likely to be clinically significant
at recommended doses and (2) there is considerable uncer-
tainty about long-term use of these medicines for back pain.
Previous reviews excluded studies that evaluated combi-
nation medicine products containing opioid analgesics and
simple analgesics or opioid antagonists.9,10 The addition of
simple analgesics to opioid analgesics may have synergistic
effects and potentially reduce the need for higher doses of
opioid analgesics.61-63,66 This review has found moderate-
quality evidence that paracetamol combined with the weak
opioid tramadol provides modest, but not clinically signifi-
cant reduction in pain (but not disability). This result is simi-
lar to findings from single-ingredient opioid analgesics.
Another trial of the paracetamol-codeine combination66 not
included in the pooled analysis of this review showed that
there were significantly more people with chronic low back
pain who experienced more than 30% pain relief in the
paracetamol/tramadol group than the placebo group; how-
ever, it was not possible to interpret the clinical significance of
these effects.

μ-opioid receptors, and inhibition of reuptake of noradrena-
line and serotonin.67,68 Based on these known pharmaco-
logical properties, tramadol and tapentadol are widely
regarded as synthetic analgesic with opioid-like effects
(World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemi-
cal code N02AX02 and N02AX06, respectively, within the
N02A class) and, as such, were included in the analysis as
opioid analgesics.
Very few opioid analgesic trials reported on global recov-
ery outcomes, and the effects on disability, where reported in
this review, were small. Even with short-term use, there is no
substantive reduction in disability. It is important to consider
long-term functional outcomes with these medicines be-
cause a reduction in pain alone may not be correlated with im-
proved disability outcomes. It is possible that the combina-
tion with nonpharmacological treatment strategies, such as
physical activity, may have a synergistic effect and future re-
search should focus on evaluating the benefits of such an ap-
proach. While this review suggests that opioid analgesics pro-
vide pain relief which is comparable to the effects reported in
previousreviewsofNSAIDs,head-to-headcomparisonswould
yield valuable insight into effective dose regimens and choice
of medicine.
Conclusions
In people with chronic low back pain, opioid analgesics pro-
vide short and/or intermediate pain relief, though the effect
issmallandnotclinicallyimportantevenathigherdoses.Many
trialpatientsstoppedtakingthemedicinebecausetheydidnot
tolerate or respond to the medicine. There is no evidence on
opioid analgesics for acute low back pain or to guide pro-
longed use of these medicines in the treatment of people with
chronic low back pain.
