IMPORTANCE Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms are a potentially life-threatening
consequence of treatment for autoimmune disease (AID) and an emerging clinical
phenomenon.
OBJECTIVE To query the association of cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating
agents to treat patients with AID with the risk for developing myeloid neoplasm.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective case-control study and medical
record review included 40 011 patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, coded diagnosis of primary AID who were seen at 2 centers from January 1, 2004, to
December 31, 2014; of these, 311 patients had a concomitant coded diagnosis of
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Eighty-six cases met
strict inclusion criteria. A case-control match was performed at a 2:1 ratio.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Odds ratio (OR) assessment for AID-directed therapies.
RESULTS Among the 86 patients who met inclusion criteria (49 men [57%]; 37 women
[43%]; mean [SD] age, 72.3 [15.6] years), 55 (64.0%) had MDS, 21 (24.4%) had de novo AML,
and 10 (11.6%) had AML and a history of MDS. Rheumatoid arthritis (23 [26.7%]), psoriasis (18
[20.9%]), and systemic lupus erythematosus (12 [14.0%]) were the most common
autoimmune profiles. Median time from onset of AID to diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm was 8
(interquartile range, 4-15) years. A total of 57 of 86 cases (66.3%) received a cytotoxic or an
immunomodulating agent. In the comparison group of 172 controls (98 men [57.0%]; 74
women [43.0%]; mean [SD] age, 72.7 [13.8] years), 105 (61.0%) received either agent
(P = .50). Azathioprine sodium use was observed more frequently in cases (odds ratio [OR],
7.05; 95% CI, 2.35- 21.13; P < .001). Notable but insignificant case cohort use among cytotoxic
agents was found for exposure to cyclophosphamide (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 0.91-14.11) followed
by mitoxantrone hydrochloride (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 0.23-33.0). Methotrexate sodium (OR,
0.60; 95% CI, 0.29-1.22), mercaptopurine (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.15-2.53), and mycophenolate
mofetil hydrochloride (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.21-2.03) had favorable ORs that were not
statistically significant. No significant association between a specific length of time of
exposure to an agent and the drug’
s category was observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large population with primary AID, azathioprine exposure
was associated with a 7-fold risk for myeloid neoplasm. The control and case cohorts had
similar systemic exposures by agent category. No association was found for anti–tumor
necrosis factor agents. Finally, no timeline was found for the association of drug exposure
with the incidence in development of myeloid neoplasm.

 T
herapy-related secondary myeloid neoplasms consti-
tute a spectrum of diseases, including myelodysplas-
tic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), which are serious consequences resulting from the
transformation of a myeloid clone induced by cytotoxic
therapy or ionizing radiation exposure.1-3 From 10% to 20%
of patients diagnosed with myeloid neoplasms have a his-
tory of exposure to cytotoxic therapy and/or radiotherapy
for treatment of an unrelated, primary malignant or benign
disease, such as an autoimmune disease (AID).3,4 The basis
of radiotherapy- or chemotherapy-related hematologic
malignant disease is proposed to be a loss of DNA repair
mechanisms and resulting genomic instability.2,5 The most
common therapeutic agents implicated are alkylating com-
pounds, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase inhibitors.1-3,6
Medical literature has highlighted therapy-related myeloid
neoplasms after treatment of several nonmalignant diseases,
especially inflammatory bowel disease1,7-9 and rheumatoid
arthritis.8,10,11 Further confounding this risk for myeloid neo-
plasms is the nature of AID itself, which is characterized by
an incessant, chronically activated inflammatory cascade
that has been associated with an increased risk for myeloid
malignant neoplasms alone.12
A recent epidemiologic study by Wilson et al13 highlights
astatisticallysignificantbutsmallincreasedriskoddsratio(OR)
of 1.5 for MDS occurring with any AID compared with pa-
tients with no AID, especially in those with AID for 10 years or
longer, with an adjusted OR of 2.1 for MDS. Anderson et al12
used the US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medi-
care database and concluded that the existence of an autoim-
mune condition was associated with an increased risk for my-
eloid neoplasms. The addition of therapeutic agents to the
treatment of AID theoretically amplifies the opportunity for a
myeloid malignant neoplasm to develop in genetically sus-
ceptible individuals.12,14
Previous studies identified a possible association
between AID and myeloid neoplasms but have not system-
atically assessed or addressed the potential influence of
therapies used in AID on the incidence and risk for myeloid
neoplasms. Thus, the true influence and effect of treatment
for AID in the development of myeloid neoplasms beyond
the higher risk of AID itself is uncertain. Other questions
arise, such as the risk associated with extended duration of
drug exposure or the type of agents used and the back-
ground of AID. In particular, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
inhibitors used to treat autoimmune conditions have a docu-
mented risk for lymphoma,15-17 but the risk for secondary
myeloid neoplasms is undefined. Autoimmune disease
affects a large group of patients, and disease-modifying
agents are increasingly prescribed for AID, especially the
TNF inhibitors and/or antagonists. Characterization of risk
can guide drug selection, affect safety assessments, and
potentially permit individualized patient drug selection and
monitoring during treatment. To our knowledge, no large
studies have comprehensively evaluated a population with
primary AID who developed myeloid neoplasms in associa-
tion with a detailed therapeutic intervention for the underly-
ing AID.
Methods
Study Aims
This study aimed to characterize the association of immuno-
modulating, cytotoxic, and other systemic agents for the treat-
ment of AID with the risk for therapy-related MDS or AML.
Secondary aims were to characterize the latency period from
onset and treatment of AID to development of myeloid neo-
plasms. This protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of the Mayo Clinic, which did not require informed
consent for this retrospective review. Data were deidentified
according to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act guidelines.
Study Design
All patients with an International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9)–coded diagnosis of AID seen at the
Mayo Clinic campuses in Phoenix, Arizona, and Jacksonville,
Florida, from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014, under-
went assessment for a concurrent ICD-9 code for MDS or
AML. The ICD-9 AID search terms included rheumatoid
arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis,
inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis,
Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sclero-
derma, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, poly-
myalgia rheumatica, Sjögren syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris,
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, granulo-
matosis with polyangiitis, myasthenia gravis, polyarteritis
nodosa, mixed connective tissue disease, CREST (calcinosis,
Raynaud disease, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and
telangiectasia) syndrome, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, mul-
tiple sclerosis, and transverse myelitis. From this population of
patients with concomitant coexisting diagnosis of MDS
and/or AML and any AID, patient medical records were indi-
vidually assessed. We confirmed 86 cases meeting strict
inclusion criteria. Specifically, the case population required
positive documentation of at least 1 of the 27 AID diagnoses
(as above) with subsequent development of MDS or AML
more than 1 month after an established diagnosis of AID. This
criterion was used to ensure that no potential cases were
missed and to reduce potential overlap with a diagnosis of a
paraneoplastic phenomenon occurring in the acute care set-
ting. We collected patient demographics, date of AID diagno-
Key Points
Question What is the risk for developing a therapy-related
myeloid neoplasm after treatment of autoimmune disease?
Findings In this multicenter, case-control study of 40 011 patients
with primary autoimmune disease, 86 had a proven therapy-related
myeloid neoplasm (acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic
syndrome). Detailed medical record review for all systemic
exposures to cytotoxic and immunomodulating agents revealed
only azathioprine sodium use more frequently in these cases.
Meaning Azathioprine was the only agent associated with a
significant risk for myeloid neoplasm.

 sis, drug exposure with a detailed timeline (when available),
and myeloid neoplasm disease characteristics, including
cytogenetics, and outcomes. The classification of the
myeloid neoplasms followed the 2008 World Health Organi-
zation classification of myeloid malignant neoplasms.18
Exclusion Criteria
Patientswithpriormalignantdiseaseormyeloproliferativedis-
eases (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) were ex-
cluded, as were patients who received a chronologic diagno-
sis of myeloid neoplasm preceding the diagnosis of AID. Last,
cases with an inadequate or an incomplete medical record for
review or an inability to validate the above diagnoses were ex-
cluded from this study.
Cytogenetic Analysis
We performed Giemsa-banded karyotyping on bone marrow
samples using conventional methods. When available, at least
20 metaphases were analyzed. Karyotypes of Giemsa-
banded chromosomes were described according to the 2009
International System of Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.19
Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with the individual my-
eloid neoplasms were subclassified following the guidelines
of the 2008 World Health Organization classification of
myeloid malignant neoplasms.
Controls and Matching
Cases were matched to controls (2 controls per case) by age,
sex, and autoimmune-specific diagnosis from the primary
population with AID. We used the Greedy algorithm,20 which
minimized the weighted sum of the absolute differences in the
matching variables between each case and all remaining pos-
sible controls.
Statistical Analysis
Cases were compared with controls using the χ2 test for fre-
quency data. Likewise, exposure outcomes between cases
and controls were compared using χ2 tests for trend. Unad-
justed ORs with 95% CIs were constructed using conditional
logistic regression for each agent and medication categories
overall. A multivariate model was constructed in which
agents with P < .20 were included. Use of a particular agent
or category was considered if a patient had any documented
exposure to the drug of interest. Multiple drug exposures
were considered separate agents even if overlapping in
exposure timeline. Patients with unknown exposure times
were excluded from any analysis involving length of expo-
sure outcomes. The study had 80% power (α = .05, 2-tailed)
to detect a 10% or greater difference in drug agent exposure
between cases and controls. Overall survival for cases was
calculated as the time from AML or MDS diagnosis until the
date of death or last follow-up. Surviving patients were con-
sidered censored at the time of the last follow-up. The dis-
tribution of survival time was estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method21 and compared between disease groups by
log-rank test. We used SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Insti-
tute) for analysis.
Results
Patient Populations and Demographics
We identified a total of 40 011 patients with any of the 27 AID
codes in the 10 years from 2004 to 2014. Of these, 311 pa-
tientscarriedaconcurrentICD-9codeforAIDandMDSorAML.
After detailed medical record validation and application of in-
clusion and exclusion criteria as described, 86 cases (49 men
[57.0%]; 37 women [43.0%]; mean [SD] age, 72.3 [15.6] years)
met strict eligibility criteria (Figure). Detailed medical rec-
ords from the final control population of 172 patients (98 men
[57.0%]; 74 women [43.0%]; mean [SD] age, 72.7 [13.8] years)
matched 2:1 for 86 cases were reviewed.
Case cohort demographics (Table 1) highlight myeloid dis-
ease specifics of the 86 patients, including 55 (64.0%) with
MDS, 21 with (24.4%) AML, and 10 with (11.6%) AML and a his-
tory of MDS. Per the Surveillance Epidemiology and End
Results data,12 during the same 10-year period in a compa-
rable population of 40 000, the anticipated incidence of my-
eloid disease was 60 to 80 cases of MDS and 44 to 60 cases of
AML, which is not significantly different from our case popu-
lation.Rheumatoidarthritis(23[26.7%]),psoriasis(18[20.9%]),
and SLE (12 [14.0%]) were the most common autoimmune pro-
files, followed by the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn dis-
ease (8 [9.3%]) and ulcerative colitis (6 [7.0%]). The median
(interquartile range [IQR]) time of onset, from diagnosis of AID
to diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm, was 8 (4-15) years (Table 1).
With a median follow-up time of 21.6 (IQR, 8.6-61.3) months,
45 deaths occurred in the case cohort. Patients with AML and
a history of MDS had the shortest median survival of 11.2 (95%
CI, 8.2-63.2) months, followed by cases with de novo AML at
14 (95% CI, 1.6 to not reached) months and MDS at 86.8 (95%
CI, 38.2-156.1) months (P = .004).

confirmed diagnosis of MDS or AML; 50 (22.2%) had no validated diagnosis of
autoimmune disease (AID); 43 (19.1%) had an alternate hematologic diagnosis (ie,
acute lymphocytic leukemia, essential thrombocytopenia, multiple primary
neoplasms, non–Hodgkin lymphoma, monoclonal disorder); 15 (6.7%) had
inadequate medical record information for review; 10 (4.4%) had MDS before
development of AID; 7 (3.1%) had a history of solid malignant tumor; and 7 (3.1%)
had paraneoplastic disorder. Paraneoplastic criteria were met if the diagnosis of
MDS presented in the same 30-day period of autoimmune phenomenon. Among
the total of 236 medical records reviewed for potential controls, 64 were
excluded for the following reasons: 48 (75.0%) had no validated diagnosis of AID;
12 (18.8%) had inadequate information in the medical record for review; and 4
(6.3%) had a history of solid malignant tumor. ICD-9 indicates International

 Cytogenetics
Cytogenetic findings of the 86 myeloid neoplasms (55 MDS,
21 de novo AML, and 10 AML with an antecedent MDS) are sub-
classified based on the guidelines of the 2008 World Health
Organization classification of myeloid malignant neoplasms.
Among the MDS group, 23 patients had a normal karyotype;
3, −7/deletion (del)(7q); 4, −5/del(5q); 1, −13/del(13q);
1,del(11q);1,del(12p)/t(12p);3,+8;6,del(20q);2,balancedchro-
mosomal translocations; 4, complex abnormalities defined as
3 or more abnormalities; 5, noncomplex unclassifiable abnor-
malities; and 2, unknown cytogenetic results. Among the AML
group, 10 patients had a normal karyotype; 4, recurrent cyto-
genetic abnormalities associated with AML, including 1 with
t(8;21)(q22;q22), 1 with inversion(16)(p13.1q22), 1 with t(6;9)
(p23;q34), and 1 with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2); 4, −7/del(7q);
1, −5/del(5q); 1, −7/del(7q); 1, −5/del(5q); 1, +8; 1, del(20q);
6, complex abnormalities; 1, noncomplex unclassifiable ab-
normalities; and 1, unknown cytogenetic results.
Systemic Treatment Exposure
Case and control populations who were treated with systemic
therapies had similar exposures by agent category (Table 2), in-
cluding cytotoxic, immunomodulation, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents, anti-inflammatory agents, and cortico-
steroids. Fifty-seven of 86 cases (66.3%) received a cytotoxic
oranimmunomodulatingagent.Incomparison,105of172con-
trols (61.0%) received either agent (P = .50). For most agents,
wefoundasimilarexposureforsystemicagentsinthecaseand
control groups, including the anti-TNF drug class. Azathio-
prine sodium was the only agent for which statistically signifi-
cant exposure differences were observed, and exposure was
morefrequentinthecasecohortthanincontrols(OR,7.05;95%
CI, 2.35- 21.13; P < .001). Cyclophosphamide (OR, 3.58; 95% CI,
0.91-14.11) was the second most common, although not reach-
ingstatisticalsignificance(Table2).Inamultivariatemodel,aza-
thioprine remained significant (OR, 6.92; 95% CI, 2.21-21.66)
when controlling for cyclophosphamide, methotrexate so-
dium, and leflunomide use.
Azathioprine Exposure in Cases and Control
Variableexposuretoazathioprineoccurredin19cases(Table3)
and11controls(Table4).Themostcommondiseasetreatedwith
azathioprine was SLE in 7 of 19 cases. All cases with SLE were
treatedwithazathioprineincombinationwithadditionalagents.
A total of 6 of 19 cases (31.6%) were exposed to azathioprine as
monotherapy, compared with 2 of 11 (18.2%) controls. Median
durationofazathioprineexposurewas23.5(IQR,12-36)months
incasesand36(IQR,24-45)monthsincontrols.Incasesandcon-
trols,severalpatientshadunknowndocumentedexposuretime
to azathioprine. The median latency period (time from AID di-
agnosistomyeloidneoplasmdiagnosis)inazathioprine-exposed
cases was 8 (IQR, 3-25) years. A similar timeline was seen in
nonazathioprine-exposedcases,withamedianof8(IQR,4-14.5)
years. No significant cytogenetic pattern was identified.
Exposure Time and Onset of MDS and AML
WeanalyzedexposuretimeinassociationwithMDSorAMLon-
set (eTable 1 in the Supplement). No significant association for
duration of agent exposure by drug category was found. Expo-
sure time for immunomodulating agents was similar between
the cases and controls treated with systemic agents. Of note, a
large portion of the control cohort was exposed to a systemic
agent for several years without development of myeloid neo-
plasm. When we compared the cumulative exposures of cases
and controls, both groups had similar exposure times to sev-
eral systemic therapies in total (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Autoimmune Therapies and Disease Association
With MDS and AML
We found a slightly higher, but not statistically significant,
incidence of AML vs MDS for azathioprine and hydroxychlo-
roquine exposure. However, the opposite was seen for metho-
trexate, anti-TNF treatment, corticosteroid, and mesalamine
exposures, with a slightly higher incidence of MDS vs AML
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).

 AID vs Hematologic Disease
Notable but not statistically significant trends were as fol-
lows: rheumatoid arthritis accounted for nearly one-third of
the total population with MDS, and psoriasis followed by SLE
represented the highest AID association for de novo AML
(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
The clinical consequence of medications used to treat AID and
their risk for development of secondary malignant neo-
plasms is increasingly recognized. However, little is known re-
garding the risk and incidence of myeloid neoplasms in asso-
ciation with treatments used for AID. The pathogenesis of
myeloid neoplasm in AID may be related to inflammatory cy-
tokines chronically activating the myeloid hematopoetic pro-
genitor compartment. The cytotoxic and immunomodulat-
ing therapies used to treat AID can be perpetual offenders as
well, and in other disease entities these drugs can clearly
contribute to the development of secondary myeloid
neoplasms.1,22 Although studies have examined the risk for
solid tumors and lymphomas,10 until now, to our knowledge,
the risk and influence of drugs used in AID and their associa-
tion with myeloid neoplasms has not been characterized in a
comprehensive study of a population with primary AID that
has validated diagnoses and a detailed therapeutic timeline
of exposures compared with a control cohort. Furthermore,
although several recent studies looked at the concurrent in-
cidence of myeloid neoplasms23,24 or assessed a specific
drug in a specific subtype of AID (ie, TNF antagonists in
spondyloarthritis),25 to our knowledge no large-scale compre-
hensive study of a population with primary AID (ie, 27 dis-
ease entities) and the description of the development of my-
eloidneoplasmshasbeenundertaken.Ourdataalsolinkedtotal
agent exposure with the onset of myeloid neoplasms after the
diagnosis of AID. We chose this time criterion because the AID
diagnosis must exist first and be under treatment to assess the
potential influence of therapeutic interventions on the inci-
dence of myeloid neoplasms. The time frame from the onset
of AID to the development of myeloid neoplasms in our study
(median, 8 years) was similar to that in the study by Kwong,9
which evaluated azathioprine treatment in a cohort with au-
toimmune disease; however, that study also included solid or-
gan transplant recipients. Thus, our study is representative of
a real-life population that first develops AID and subse-
quently myeloid neoplasms.
In our population with primary AID, only azathioprine ex-
posure was associated with a statistically significant 7-fold risk
for myeloid neoplasms (OR, 7.05; 95% CI, 2.35- 21.13; P < .001).
This risk was also observed in multivariate analysis and was
identical to the risk in a prospective cohort of patients under-

 going thiopurine treatment in inflammatory bowel disease.7
Our study demonstrated notable, but not statistically signifi-
cant, risks among the case cohort with exposure to cyclophos-
phamide (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 0.91-14.11), followed by mitoxan-
trone (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 0.23-33.00). Methotrexate,
mercaptopurine, and mycophenolate mofetil had favorable
ORs, but these were not statistically significant, possibly
owing to an underpowered sample size, even in such a large
study overall.
The data presented herein are supported by other studies
in selected populations with AID, such as inflammatory bowel
disease and rheumatoid arthritis only, in which azathioprine
exposure was shown to be a risk factor for development of my-
eloid neoplastic disease.7,10 However, none of the previous
studies examined and compared the variety of medications
used in a large population with AID spectrum at this scale and
with the development of myeloid neoplasms.
Among the proposed mechanisms of leukemic transfor-
mation in patients with AID are the preexisting dysfunctional
immune response, chronic inflammation, and amplification
of this risk by immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapies
used to treat the disease.14 The leukemogenic mechanism of
antimetabolites, including azathioprine, is thought to occur by
nonrepaired, DNA double-strand breaks that form highly mu-
tagenic DNA bases.3,6,26 A genetic predisposition or inflam-
matory-mediated propensity for inefficient repair of drug-
induced genetic damage may explain the exposure time to
onset and susceptibility to the development of myeloid ma-
lignant neoplasms, as suggested in previous studies.1,12,22 In
line with a repair defect, the exposure time from commence-
ment of cytotoxic therapy to development of myeloid neo-
plasms occurred within 5 years for more than half the case co-
hort, much shorter than in the control population, in which
approximately 35% had exposure of 5 years or less (eTable 1

 in the Supplement). Alternatively, preexisting age-related, he-
matopoietic clones with p53 mutation have been identified in
a high frequency among healthy elderly individuals who are
naïve to chemotherapy. Therefore, these preexisting clones
may be selectively promoted after treatment exposure, thus
contributing to the development of therapy-related AML.27
Elucidating and molecularly characterizing these mecha-
nisms may provide clues to secondary myeloid pathogenesis,
serve as potential biomarkers, and influence therapeutic de-
cisions in the future. Theoretically, we speculate these leuke-
mias may respond favorably to DNA and cell cycle check-
point inhibitors, given that these drugs exploit underlying
repair defects in AML cells.28,29 As a consequence, an area of
future research should be exploration of underlying DNA dam-
age repair defects, specifically mutations in such genes, that
might enable transformation under (cytotoxic) drug treat-
ment for AID.
In our study, the most common immunomodulating cat-
egories of exposures in both cohorts permitting OR assess-
ment (Table 2) included hydroxychloroquine sulfate (OR, 1.12;
95% CI, 0.50-2.48), TNF inhibitors (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.33-
1.53), and leflunomide (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11-1.46). Hydroxy-
chloroquine exposure was equal among both cohorts at ap-
proximately 23% and thus carried no association with
development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Leflu-
nomide and TNF inhibitors had nonsignificant favorable OR
exposure to outcome.
This study is, to our knowledge, the first to show that TNF
inhibitors do not seem to have a higher risk of contributing to
myeloid neoplasm formation in patients with AID. In fact, sev-
eral smaller studies30-32 used anti-TNF agents to treat MDS,
which showed a favorable result overall. This observation is
very important because of concerns of TNF inhibitors and sec-
ondary malignant neoplasms16,17; however, our data need fur-
ther confirmation from other data sets.
Limitations
Limitations of our study are associated with its retrospective
nature, possible underrepresentation of certain autoimmune
populations, underpowered comparisons for individual rare
diseases, lack of control for disease severity, and inability to
calculate cumulative drug exposure. Potential cases of my-
eloid neoplasms may have been missed because our institu-
tion is a referral center. In addition, AID drug exposure data
and a detailed timeline were not available in all cases. Small
sample size (particularly for individual drug classification) also
limits our interpretation, because many of these compari-
sons are underpowered, resulting in nonsignificant ORs and
associated wide CIs. Nevertheless, to our knowledge this study
is one of the largest, most comprehensive AID case-control
studies performed among more than 40 000 patients with AID
inasinglecasecohortanalyzingadetaileddrugexposuretime-
line with detailed therapeutic exposure in regards to the inci-
dence of myeloid neoplasm.
Conclusions
Physicians who prescribe cytotoxic and immunomodulating
therapies are mindful of risk-benefit evaluation, but
obstacles to identifying patients at highest risk exist, includ-
ing a variable latency period from the drug exposure to
myeloid disease diagnosis, concomitant multiple-drug expo-
sure, and scarcity of studies in the literature. Future mecha-
nistic and genomic profiling studies may help to identify
patients at risk. Results of the present study are expected to
contribute to knowledge of therapy-related myeloid malig-
nant neoplasms in patients treated for AID, suggesting that
individualized drug selection and monitoring during treat-
ment could become possible, especially for patients requir-
ing treatment with azathioprine and cytotoxic agents.

 Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors did not show an increased
incidence of myeloid neoplasms, which is an important
observation. Although our results are intriguing, they should
at this stage not change or replace the clinical judgments,
monitoring, and current standard treatments or interven-
tions in AID.
