Biosimilars in oncology: current 
and future perspectives
Matti Aapro, MD
The healthcare burden of cancer
Cancer places a signifi
 cant, and growing, 
burden on healthcare systems around 
the world. Improved therapies and 
changing demographics are conspiring to 
increase the already considerable drain on 
resources. On the one hand, population 
growth 
and 
ageing 
will 
increase 
the 
number 
of new cancer cases in the coming years 
[1]; on the other, advances in diagnosis 
and management will extend the length 
of treatment required for each patient [2]. 
Many novel treatments or supportive thera-
pies for patients with cancer are biological 
agents. In fact, cancer is the major indica-
tion for six of the ten best-selling biologi-
cal therapies [3]. The cost of new cancer 
drugs is rising every year [4], due in part 
to the higher research and development 
costs associated with biological rather than 
chemical medicines. In the US, the cost of 
cancer drugs rose four-fold between 1998 
and 2008 [5], with more than 90% of the 
oncology therapies approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) between 
2005 and 2009 costing in excess of 
US$20,000 for three months of treatment 
[6]. This growing cost burden is also being 
felt across Europe. The French budget for 
cancer therapies, for example, more than 
doubled from Euros 474 million to Euros 
975 million between 2004 and 2008 [7]. 
These different factors form a complex 
situation that requires rapid action [8, 9].
Patent expiration on biopharmaceutical 
products provides pharmaceutical com-
panies with an opportunity to develop 
and produce similar biological medicinal 
products, or biosimilars [10]. These agents 
may offer one way of controlling cancer 
drug expenditure while simultaneously 
expanding patient access to important 
treatments [11]. This paper will review 
current and future use of biosimilars in 
oncology, regulatory aspects of biosimilar 
approval, and current and future impact of 
these agents on cancer drug expenditure.
Biosimilars in oncology: regulatory 
considerations
Biological therapies are large, highly 
complex molecules derived from living 
cells or organisms. Traditional chemical 
medicines, by contrast, are usually simple 
molecules of low molecular weight, syn-
thesised by chemical means. These dif-
fering complexities and methods of 
manufacture create an important difference 
between biosimilars and conventional 
generic drugs: while chemical generics 
can be fully characterised as identical 
to the originator product, biosimilars 
cannot. Biological therapies are inherently 
variable, creating unavoidable differences 
between even subsequent batches of the 
same product [12]. An expiring patent 
does not necessarily provide access to the 
precise manufacturing conditions used in 
producing 
the 
originator 
therapy, 
including, 
for example, the relevant cell line clone 
and growth medium. It therefore cannot 
be guaranteed that biosimilar products are 
identical to their reference product on a 
molecular level. In turn, this difference 
has important implications for the regu-
lation and licensing of biosimilars. While 
conventional generic drugs require only a 
limited comparison and demonstration of 
identity to the reference product, biosimi-
lars require far more rigorous testing. In 
general, there must be a thorough com-
parison of structural and functional char-
acteristics of the biosimilar and originator 
therapy. Any identifi
 ed microheterogene-
ities must then be assessed for their impact 
on safety and clinical performance.
In the EU, biosimilars are licensed through 
a thorough comparability exercise with 
the reference product, and clinical stud-
ies to ensure equivalence of effi
 cacy and 
safety profi
 les. Guidelines produced by 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
detail manufacturing process require-
ments, and the range of protein structure, 
isoform, aggregate, receptor binding and 
biological activity assays necessary to 
demonstrate biological equivalence [13]. 
EMA guidelines also outline the required 
clinical and non-clinical pharmacoki-
netic, pharmacodynamic and pharmaco-
toxological 
evaluations 
necessary 
to 
assess safety and effi
 cacy before approval 
[14, 15]. EMA guidelines have served as a 
starting point for development of licens-
ing procedures in the US, where FDA 
released draft guidance for the regulatory 
review of biosimilars in early 2012 [16].
A number of biopharmaceutical agents will 
lose patent protection in Europe from 2014 
onwards, and as a result more biosimilar 
medicines are likely to become available 
for use in oncology [17]. The focus of bio-
similar development will shift from medi-
cines used in the supportive care setting 
to agents that provide life-saving or life-
extending benefi
 ts such as monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs). Following an exten-
sive public consultation period, EMA has 
recently adopted its guideline on biosimi-
lar monoclonal antibodies [18]. It recogn-
Keywords: Biosimilars, cost burden, oncology
Cancer represents a signifi
 cant, and growing, burden on healthcare systems. This is 
driven, at least in part, by escalating cancer drug budgets. Loss of patent protection 
on biopharmaceuticals enables the development and production of similar biological 
medicines, or biosimilars. Biosimilars are currently available for use in oncology in the 
supportive care setting; the focus of biosimilar development is likely to switch to agents 
such as monoclonal antibodies. Available evidence indicates that biosimilars approved 
by regulatory authorities off
 er a safe and eff
 ective alternative to originator biological 
therapies.  They also off
 er potentially signifi
 cant cost savings to healthcare payers. The 
greater aff
 ordability of biosimilars may also result in clinical benefi
 ts, through earlier 
and wider appropriate therapy use and release of funding to be used elsewhere in 
clinical care. Greater adoption of biosimilars represents a key approach to reducing 
healthcare expenditure and improving patient access to important treatments.

PERSPECTIVE
ises the challenges that manufacturers may 
face in establishing similar clinical effi
 cacy 
and safety of a biosimilar and reference 
mAb in the anticancer setting; preferred 
endpoints for confi
 rming effi
 cacy, such as 
progression-free, disease-free and overall 
survival, may not be feasible to establish 
biosimilarity as they may be infl
 uenced by 
factors, e.g. tumour burden, performance 
status, previous therapy, unrelated to 
differences between the biosimilar and 
reference mAb. The guideline therefore 
acknowledges that surrogate endpoints 
such as overall response rate or change in 
tumour mass may be more appropriate.
Biosimilars in oncology
All biosimilar medicines currently approved 
by EMA are versions of recombinant 
human erythropoietin (epoetin), recombi-
nant human granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor (fi
 lgrastim) or recombinant human 
growth hormone. The biosimilar epoetins 
and fi
 lgrastims are used in oncology, for 
the treatment of chemotherapy-induced 
anaemia (biosimilar epoetins) and preven-
tion of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia 
(biosimilar fi
 lgrastims). The availability of 
biosimilars has generated discussion among 
physicians about the possible concerns with 
prescribing these products [19].
The primary safety concern for biosimilars, 
as for all biological medicines, is immuno-
genicity. Most biological therapies elicit 
an immune response, in most cases with 
no clinical consequences. However, there 
are some biologicals for which immune 
responses have been linked to serious 
safety 
issues, 
notably 
the 
pure 
red-cell 
apla-
sia (PRCA) caused by cross-reacting neu-
tralising antibodies against erythropoietin. 
Even small structural alterations may have 
an impact on immunogenicity, and analyt-
ical or animal data cannot always predict 
human immune responses. To mitigate this 
unavoidable risk, extensive non-clinical 
trial data demonstrating no increase in 
immunogenicity 
of 
the 
biosimilar 
compared 
with the reference product are required 
before a biosimilar can be licensed. In 
fact, the risk for detection of new and 
serious adverse effects after licensing is 
considered by some to be much lower for 
a biosimilar than for a biological contain-
ing a new or modifi
 ed active substance 
[20]. Furthermore, the newer technologies 
used in manufacturing biosimilars mean 
that the products are generally of higher 
purity and quality, and more consistent 
potency, than their originator reference 
products [21]. Unfortunately, inadequately 
produced copies exist and can lead to 
major issues, as recently exemplifi
 ed by 
numerous cases of PRCA in Thailand [22].
Ongoing pharmacovigilance is key to 
ensuring the safety of biopharmaceuticals. 
The pharmacovigilance programmes put 
in place by companies who market bio-
similars are comparable in size and scope 
to those of originator companies, including 
a requirement to provide periodic safety 
update reports to the regulatory authori-
ties. EMA requires a risk-management plan 
(RMP) to be implemented as a condition 
of marketing approval for all biopharma-
ceuticals, whether originator or biosimilar 
products. As an example, biosimilar epo-
etins have post-marketing studies as part 
of their RMPs to address potential safety 
issues such as PRCA, thromboembolic 
events and tumour treatment outcomes.
Patient exposure to biosimilars is increas-
ing as adoption of these agents becomes 
more widespread. For example, the cur-
rent (as of April 2013) estimated exposure 
to Binocrit (a biosimilar epoetin alpha) 
is over 216,000 patient-years, with more 
than 5,000 patients studied in clinical trials 
(data from the Sandoz periodic safety 
update report [PSUR] to EMA). As another 
example, the current estimated expo-
sure to Zarzio (a biosimilar fi
 lgrastim) is 
3.5 million patient-days (data from the 
Sandoz PSUR to EMA). It is reassuring 
that the adoption of biosimilars in gen-
eral has so far not been associated with 
any unexpected safety concerns. A recent 
review of information gathered since 
biosimilar epoetins entered the market 
identifi
 ed no difference in safety profi
 les 
between biosimilar and reference prod-
ucts, or between the alternative biosimilar 
formulations [23]. Similarly, a prospective 
randomised clinical study, conducted since 
licensing, has shown equivalence in phar-
macokinetic and pharmacodynamics pro-
fi
 les, safety and clinical effi
 cacy between 
originator and biosimilar epoetins [24].
Cost savings associated with biosimilars: 
current evidence and future possibilities
Available 
evidence 
indicates 
that 
biosimilars offer a safe and effective 
alternative to originator biological thera-
pies. They also offer potentially signifi
 -
cant cost savings to healthcare authorities, 
which are desperately needed to con-
trol the current unsustainable levels of 
expenditure; sales of biopharmaceuticals 
amount to almost US$70 billion in the 
US and Euros 60 billion in Europe 
[3, 25]. The development, manufacture 
and licensing requirements for biosimilars 
are considerably more rigorous than 
those for traditional generic drugs. The 
cost savings are therefore unlikely to be 
as large as sometimes observed for con-
ventional generics, with savings in the 
region of 15–30% rather than 80% [26, 27]. 
A recent quantitative analysis of the Euro-
pean biosimilar market also concluded 
that biosimilars will result in smaller price 
reductions (and smaller market share) 
than conventional generic medicines [28]. 
Nevertheless, the potential cost savings 
are substantial—by some estimates, a 20% 
reduction in the price of six off-patent 
biopharmaceuticals would save Euros 1.6 
billion in Europe each year [29].
There is already evidence of the cost sav-
ings being made through adoption of bio-
similars. For example, it is estimated that 
biosimilar epoetins saved Euros 60 million 
in Germany during their fi
 rst year of avail-
ability—a fi
 gure that is projected to rise to 
Euros 8 billion by 2020 [30, 31]. Another 
analysis across seven European countries 
(France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, 
The Netherlands and UK) calculated 2010 
expenditure on epoetins in oncology to 
be US$1,117 million [17]; assuming a 100% 
switch to a biosimilar epoetin (at 2010 
prices), US$188 million would be saved 
per annum. A recent study has attempted 
to systematically forecast the savings that 
could be made by increasing use of bio-
similar epoetin, fi
 lgrastim and monoclonal 
antibodies in eight European countries—
France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Roma-
nia, Spain, Sweden and UK [31]. Analysis 
was based on prices between 2007 and 
2010, and an estimate of future drug 
consumption through either theoretical 
requirements based on demographic and 
epidemiological estimates, or through esti-
mated growth rates. A range of country-
specifi
 c scenarios were developed for the 
market and price progression of each bio-
similar 
and 
its 
originator 
product. 
Assuming 
no biosimilars entered the market, esti-
mated expenditure on the investigated 
biological therapies was Euros 229 billion 
between 2007 and 2020. By 2020, savings 
from biosimilar use ranged from Euros 
11.8 to Euros 33.4 billion, depending on 
the model used. This represents 5.2% to 
14.6% of total therapy expenditure. The 
bulk of these savings are expected to be 
made in France, Germany and UK—the

PERSPECTIVE
countries that currently spend the most 
on biological drugs. Projections are likely 
to be most accurate for biosimilar epo-
etins, since these have been available in 
Europe for several years and therefore 
have known market trends. Here, sav-
ings of between Euros 9.4 and Euros 
11.1 billion are estimated up to 2020—a 
reduction of 21.5–25.5% from the base-
line originator-only scenario. A model 
specifi
 cally designed to compare the 
comparative cost-effi
 ciency of originator 
and biosimilar epoetins found that, for a 
patient undergoing six cycles of chemo-
therapy, the average cost of treatment was 
reduced from Euros 7,168 to Euros 4,643 
through the use of biosimilar rather than 
originator epoetin alpha therapy [32].
Biosimilars in oncology: how can they 
improve patient care
The potential cost savings through adop-
tion of biosimilar medicines are important 
to society in general, but it is also important 
to consider how adoption of these agents 
might improve patient care. One possibility 
is that improved affordability may increase 
patient access to the most appropriate ther-
apies at an earlier time during their illness. 
In a non-interventional study conducted in 
a community oncology centre, switching 
from originator to biosimilar fi
 lgrastim was 
accompanied by a trend towards increased 
use of fi
 lgrastim as primary prophylaxis 
[33], which may refl
 ect greater willingness 
to use biosimilar fi
 lgrastim earlier given its 
lower cost. Another possibility is that cost 
savings made by using biosimilar medicines 
in the supportive care setting could be re-
invested to expand patient access to cur-
rently available life-extending or life-saving 
treatments. As an example, the saving of 
US$188 million generated by switching to 
biosimilar epoetin (described previously) 
would support rituximab therapy for an 
additional 9,000 patients [17]. Finally, with 
upwards of 500 oncology biologicals cur-
rently in development pipelines, a third 
possibility is that greater uptake of existing 
and future biosimilars will permit funding 
of these new biological cancer treatments.
Conclusion
In the current climate of growing fi
 nan-
cial constraints on healthcare systems 
and impending patent expiry on major 
biological therapies used in oncology, 
biosimilars offer an important opportunity 
to provide high quality and clinically effec-
tive medications at reduced cost. Their 
greater affordability may, in fact, result in 
clinical benefi
 ts through earlier and wider 
therapy use, and release of funding to be 
used elsewhere in clinical care. With the 
appropriate regulation and monitoring in 
place, increasing adoption of biosimilars 
represents a key approach in reducing 
healthcare budgets and improving patient 
access to important therapies.

PERSPECTIVE
Biosimilarity and Interchangeability
to the market has its advantages, some 
medical professionals are still not familiar 
with the defi
 nition of biosimilars. In addi-
tion, it is important to assure total trans-
parency from all the parties involved with 
the regulation and approval processes of 
those treatments [10, 13].
Biosimilar products are gradually being 
introduced into clinical practice. In the 
near future, the agents with increased com-
plexity will be introduced into the global 
markets. These products may potentially 
reduce healthcare costs. Some uncertain-
ties are related to its safety and effi
 cacy, 
particularly when reference biological 
drugs have multiple indications. Therefore, 
assuring the safety and effi
 cacy of biosimi-
lars by means of non-clinical and clinical 
studies is crucially required, as patients’ 
welfare is much more relevant than any 
economic interest involved [17, 18].
