Abstract
Objective
To elaborate the risk of headache among adolescent survivors exposed to terror.
Methods
On July 22, 2011, a lone man opened gunfire, killing 69 people at a summer camp for
adolescents on the Utøya islet in Norway. All 358 adolescent survivors 13 to 20 years of age
were invited to participate in the Utøya interview study. Among the 213 (59%) respondents,
half (49%) were male, the mean age was 17.7 years, and 13 (6%) were severely injured. For each
survivor, 8 matched controls were drawn from the population-based Young-HUNT3 Study,
conducted between 2006 and 2008, with a participation rate of 73%. Recurrent migraine and
tension-type headache (TTH) over the past 3 months served as main outcomes and were
measured 4 to 5 months after the mass shooting with a validated headache interview, in
accordance with the International Classification of Headache Disorders.
Results
After exposure to terror, the odds ratio for migraine was 4.27 (95% confidence interval
2.54–7.17) and for TTH was 3.39 (95% confidence interval 2.22–5.18), as estimated in mul-
tivariable logistic regression models adjusted for injury, sex, age, family structure and economy,
prior exposure to physical or sexual violence, and psychological distress. The observed in-
creased risk of headache in survivors was related largely to an increase in weekly and daily
headaches.
Conclusions
Exposure to terror increases risk of persistent weekly and daily migraine and TTH in adolescent
survivors, above expected levels. The terrors of other violence may similarly increase the risk of
frequent headaches. After severe psychological traumas, interventions may need to address
survivors’ pain to hinder chronification.

Terror attacks and other extreme violence pose major threats
to the health and well-being of survivors worldwide.1–3 Be-
yond the adverse impact of coinciding injuries,1 harmful en-
vironmental exposure,4 psychological distress,5,6 and related
psychosocial adversity,7 the effect of such violent incidents on
the somatic health of survivors is largely unknown. This la-
cuna could impede identification of the onset or exacerbation
of frequent and disabling somatic complaints such as
headaches8,9 during the early phase of chronification, when
interventions may be most fruitful.10
Nonviolent, stressful life events are potential triggers of mi-
graine and tension-type headaches (TTHs).11 There is
a possibility that neuroendoimmunologic responses to se-
verely adverse experiences12 could affect central sensitization
and pain modulation and perception, thereby increasing in-
dividual susceptibility to chronification of migraines and TTH
over time.10,13 If this is the case, we suspect life-threatening
events such as a terror attack to be highly pathogenic in regard
to triggering the onset or exacerbation of frequent headaches.
Adolescents could be particularly vulnerable.14
In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of terror on
recurrent headache by type and frequency in adolescents. We
compared headache among highly exposed adolescent survi-
vors of a mass shooting (the Utøya Study) and matched
controls from a general population study (the Young-
HUNT3 Study). We hypothesized that exposure to terror
would increase survivors’ risk of frequent headaches, above
expected levels, accounting for known risk factors, including
injuries, age, sex, family structure and economy, prior physical
violence, sexual abuse, and current psychological distress.
Methods
Participants and procedure
On July 22, 2011, there were 564 people on the Utøya islet for
the yearly Norwegian Labor Party youth summer camp when
a lone, ethnic Norwegian man, disguised as a policeman,
opened fire, shot 69 people dead, and severely wounded 33
(hospitalized). Everyone present was highly exposed to terror.
A high number of survivors witnessed the atrocities; many
risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape; and the
majority lost friends.3 Apart from 4 children <13 years of age,
all survivors, including 358 adolescents, were invited to par-
ticipate in the Utøya Study (figure). Among the 229 (64%)
adolescent responders still <20 years of age at the time of the
study, one was excluded because of traumatic brain injury and
15 did not respond to the headache interview, leaving us with
213 (59%) respondents, of whom 13 (6%) were severely
injured and 104 (49%) were male. Trained personnel
conducted semistructured interviews with the survivors, in-
cluding a validated headache interview.15 The first round of
interviews (T1) took place 4 to 5 months after the terror attack,
followed by T2 at 1.5 years and T3 at ≈3 years. At the end of
each session, the interviewer assessed the survivors’ current
needs for health services and provided help in contacting the
appropriate resources if required. Matched controls were drawn
from the Young-HUNT3 Study cohort (https://www.ntnu.
edu/hunt) (2006–2008), a population-based general health
study encompassing a self-report questionnaire (http://www.
ntnu.edu/hunt/data/que) and a clinical assessment by trained
staff, including the validated headache interview.15 A total of
7,588 (73%) of the 10,464 invited adolescents, of whom 3,769
(50%) were male, completed both the questionnaire and the
headache interview. Eight Young-HUNT3 controls were
matched to each Utøya case, according to sex and age, on the
basis of a priori reasoning.16 In total, 1,704 controls were in-
cluded in the study, of whom 832 (49%) were male.
Measures
Headache
A validated headache interview was used to assess recurrent
headache by type and frequency in survivors at 4 to 5 months
after the mass shooting (the Utøya Study, T1) and among
matched controls (the Young-HUNT3 Study).15 During the
acute posttrauma phase of about a month,17 survivors’ psy-
chological and physiologic reactions are called acute stress
reactions, which are usually transient, may be considered
normal,18 and could temporarily affect headache prevalence
among survivors. In collaboration with the authors of the
original instrument, the text was therefore slightly modified in
the Utøya Study, in which adolescents were asked to report
headache over the past 3 months to ensure that the reported
headache patterns represented persistent complaints, re-
curring for at least 3 months after the acute posttrauma phase.
Adolescents in the Young-HUNT3 Study reported recurrent
headache complaints during the past year. Both survivors and
controls were asked whether they had experienced headaches
not caused by a cold (infection) or other illness. In accordance
with the International Classification of Headache Disorders,
“yes” responders were read 2 descriptive texts of prototypic
complaints for migraine and TTH19 and asked whether either,
both, or neither description resembled their own complaints.
This recognition-based headache interview differentiating
migraine and TTH in adolescents has previously been vali-
dated against diagnoses based on extensive semistructured
interviews by neurologists. The overall chance-corrected
agreement (Cohen κ) was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.66–0.86), which is considered good.15 Furthermore, the
adolescents were asked to specify the frequency of their head
pain. Adolescents with any recurrent headache with migraine
characteristics within the given time period were classified as

 having migraine. No TTH or less than monthly TTH com-
plaints were coded as no TTH, while reports of TTH on 1 to
≥3 d/mo were classified as TTH. Other headache was coded
in a manner similar to TTH. The grand total of any reported
frequencies of migraine, TTH, and other headaches formed
the basis for the calculation of a headache frequency vari-
able, ranging from none to less than monthly (less than
once a month), monthly (1–3 d/mo), weekly (1–4 d/wk), or
daily/chronic (>4 d/wk) headache complaints.
Terror
All adolescent survivors included in the Utøya Study had been
directly exposed to the mass shooting incident on the Utøya
islet on July 22, 2011,3 and were coded 1 for terror. The
matched controls from the Young-HUNT3 Study were coded
0. Information on gunshot wounds in survivors of the mass
shooting was drawn from hospital records as part of the Utøya
Study. Survivors diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries in the
hospital records were excluded, while other injuries requiring
hospitalization were called severe injury.
Sex and age
For both survivors and matched controls, information on sex
and age at the time of interview was based on data from the
Norwegian National Population Registry.
Socioeconomic factors
Family structure differentiated between living with 1 or both
parents and living without either parent. In both studies,
relative affluence of the family was measured by asking, “What
is the economic status of your family in comparison to most
others?” Answers were dichotomized as family economy be-
low average, including worse or somewhat worse than most
others, and all other categories of family economy, self-
reported as average or better than average.
Interpersonal violence
Among survivors, lifetime exposure to physical violence be-
fore the mass shooting on Utøya islet was measured as “was
subjected to violence (beaten or injured)” (yes or no). Life-
time exposure to sexual abuse before the mass shooting was

 measured by asking whether the participant “was subjected to
unpleasant/disagreeable sexual acts” (yes or no). We avoided
screening of prior interpersonal violence in the early after-
math (T1) on the basis of ethical and clinical considerations
concerning the survivors’ well-being and the appropriate
length and content of the interview. Data were therefore
collected during the following waves (T2 and T3). The
Young-HUNT3 Study included questions on lifetime expo-
sure to physical violence and sexual abuse, similar to the
questions used in the Utøya Study, although sexual abuse was
measured with 2 items differentiating the perpetrator, peer vs
adult. A sum score (0–2) of the 2 Young-HUNT3 items on
sexual abuse formed the basis for dichotomization between no
sexual abuse (0) and sexual abuse (1–2), comparable to the
single, dichotomous item of the Utøya Study.
Psychological distress
The level of posttraumatic psychological distress in survivors
and psychological distress in matched controls was measured
with a validated, 5-item short version20 of the 25-item Hop-
kins Symptom Checklist subscale on anxiety and depression,
assessing fear or anxiety, tension/distress or restlessness,
hopelessness, dejection or sadness, and excessive worry over
the past 14 days. Cronbach α was 0.82 for survivors and 0.83
for matched controls.
Data analyses
Analysis of variance and exact Pearson χ2 tests were used to
assess group differences in continuous and categorical variables
between cases and controls for each sex separately. Logistic
regression models were used to obtain adjusted odds ratios and
95% CIs that estimated the likelihood of experiencing recurrent
headache, migraine, and TTH according to exposure to terror
within complete case samples. No migraine and no monthly or
more frequent TTH/other headache served as the reference
category for all 3 outcomes. Ordinal logistic regression was
used to estimate the likelihood of survivors experiencing more
frequent headaches compared to matched controls. The anal-
yses of headache frequency were based on an a priori as-
sumption of proportional odds. We estimated 3 multivariable
logistic regression models, hierarchically adjusting for in-
creasing numbers of risk factors, based on a priori reasoning.
Risk for headache by type and higher frequency, in relation to
exposure to terror, was estimated in multiple logistic regression
analyses and adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic factors, and
severe injury (model 1).11,16,21 In model 2, childhood exposure
to physical violence and sexual abuse was added.13,22 Model 3
also included a measure of level of current posttraumatic psy-
chological distress in survivors and psychological distress in
matched controls.21,23 All tests were 2 tailed, with a significance
level of p ≤ 0.05. The analyses were performed with IBM SPSS
statistics version 22 in combination with R version 3.1.2 (The R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
Both the Utøya Study and the Young-HUNT3 Study were based
on written informed consent from participants ≥16 years of age
and from the parents of individuals <16 years of age. The current
matched cohort study of adolescents from the Utøya Study and
the Young-HUNT3 Study was approved by the Norwegian
Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in
Norway (document 551224, 2011/1625; 2014/246).
Results
Survivors of terror were found to be comparable to matched
controls in regard to background factors (table 1). Adolescent
girls and boys exposed to terror experienced more recurrent
headaches than their nonexposed peers (table 2). As expected,

 adolescents reported mainly recurrent TTHs and migraines,
and headache prevalence was generally lower among boys.
The survivors consistently reported more frequent headaches
than matched controls regardless of sex. Three times more
survivors reported weekly or daily headache complaints than
matched controls, while headaches recurring less than
monthly seemed to maintain at a stable, low level across ex-
posure and sex. Thus, the elevated prevalence of headache
observed in survivors was largely and significantly related to
an increase in frequent headaches. Level of posttraumatic
psychological distress in survivors was higher than reported
psychological distress among controls.
Test of parallel lines suggested no significant deviation from the
proportional odds assumption (p = 0.199). Logistic regression
revealed strong, consistent, and significant relationships be-
tween exposure to terror and migraine, TTH, and higher fre-
quency of headache complaints, despite adjustment for severe
injury, age, sex, and family structure and economy (model 1,
table 3). Additional adjustment for prior exposure to physical
violence or sexual abuse did not alter risk estimates substantially
(model 2). When posttraumatic psychological distress was
added as a covariate, exposure to terror remained significantly
and consistently associated with all outcomes (model 3). Ad-
justment for psychological distress seemed to bring about an
attenuation of risk estimates, although the 95% CIs remained
overlapping.
Taken together, the estimates of the effect of exposure to
terror on headache in survivors remained robustly high across
the headache types. In particular, all multivariable ordinal
logistic regression models revealed a strong and significant
relationship between exposure to terror and higher headache
frequency (models 1–3).
Prior physical violence and sexual abuse were significantly and
independently linked to headache (model 3). As expected,
higher levels of psychological distress were associated with
increased risk of headache (model 3).
Discussion
Our study shows that exposure to terror increases the risk of
recurrent or chronic headaches in survivors. The findings may

 have implications for emergency preparedness planning,
surveillance, and clinical interventions.
Strengths of this study are the matched cohort design and
high participation rates; other studies after large-scale trau-
matic incidents usually face sampling problems24 and lack
comparison data. The high, relatively homogeneous exposure
among the survivors3 contrasts with most other studies, in
which great variation in severity, duration, and frequency of
individual violence exposure may weaken the validity and
reliability of results.25 Exposure to the mass shooting did not
coincide with exposure to toxicants, irritants, or other harmful
environmental factors, which is often the case in other terror
or disaster studies4 and studies assessing the effect of violence
exposure on health in vulnerable subgroups of populations.7,26
Clinical relevancy of the outcome measure15 may also be
helpful in terms of interpreting the findings and anticipating
potential, meaningful interventions. Because headache and
related risks were measured similarly and independently in
the Utøya Study and the Young-HUNT3 Study, we were able
to account for a comprehensive range of known risk factors
and thereby attenuate the risk of confounding. On the other
hand, the span of 3 to 5 years between the collection of data in
the Young-HUNT3 Study and the Utøya Study could affect
the results; survivors and matched controls could vary in
confounding factors that were not accounted for; and the
retrospective, cross-sectional study design hinders causal in-
ference. Adjustment for concurrent psychological distress,
which may represent a confounder or mediator of the assessed
relationship between exposure to terror and headache, could
have led to an underestimation of the strength of associations.
The lower response rate among survivors with high symptom
levels could have led to an underestimation of associations,24
and the lower response rate among marginalized adolescents
in both studies could have affected results either way.27 Our
measures of prior physical violence and sexual abuse lack
event-specific information on the perpetrator, severity, and
duration. Our measure of psychological distress did not cap-
ture avoidance or re-experience reactions, although general
distress is highly correlated with specific posttraumatic
reactions.3
Prior research indicates that exposure to extreme violence in
the form of combat21 or childhood maltreatment, encom-
passing sexual abuse and other violence from caregivers,13
increases the risk of chronic headache in adults. These asso-
ciations may be largely attributable to related accumulating,
synergetic risk factors, including genetic susceptibility;28 head
injuries;26 exposure to other adverse physical, economic, or
psychosocial conditions; development of posttraumatic psy-
chological distress;29 and co-occurring lifestyle-related health
problems.30 Similarly, posttraumatic stress disorder has been
linked to a range of somatic disorders in young girls in a large,
cross-sectional, case-control study based on existing service-
use data.6 This finding was supported by results from a recent
retrospective, cross-sectional study in which posttraumatic
mental health problems mediated the relationship between
self-reported interpersonal violence and subsequent onset of
frequent headaches and back and neck pain in adolescents.23
Conversely, findings from an early study of adolescent girls
and women admitted to hospital after forcible rape indicate
that headache may be among the first health complaints to
emerge in the acute posttrauma phase.31 To what degree the
reported headaches were related to inflicted head injury or
acute psychological distress and whether complaints persisted
beyond the acute posttrauma phase were not elaborated.
However, the indication of a more direct relationship between
exposure to violent events and headache is not totally un-
precedented because children and adolescents exposed to
disaster32 and transitory displacement during war33 have also
reported headache and pain, co-occurring with psychological
distress, in the early aftermath of exposure.

 Disentangling the pathogenicity of exposure to the terror of
a specific event is a challenging task, given the tendency of
accumulation of risk within individuals, families, and
communities.7,26,30 However, combining recent advances in
headache research and the psychiatric, epigenetic, and
neuroimmunologic fields may lend some support to our
findings. Childhood maltreatment during periods of high
developmental plasticity seems to trigger modifications in
genetic expression, neural circuits, immunologic functioning,
and related physiologic stress responses.12,28,34 It is plausible
that exposure to interpersonal violence could induce func-
tional, neuroendoimmunologic alterations, affecting central
sensitization and pain modulation and perception.10 Central
sensitization, expressed as hypersensitivity to visual, auditory,
olfactory, and somatosensory stimuli, has long been thought
to play a key role in the pathogenesis and chronification of
migraine.11,35,36 There is suggestive evidence that such sensiti-
zation may be related to higher severity and frequency of
headaches rather than specific headache diagnoses.37 One
plausible pathway linking severe adversity to increased excit-
ability could be fear-related elevated amygdalar metabolic ac-
tivity. Such increased amygdalar activity was recently linked to
a higher risk of the development of cardiovascular disease in
humans over time, plausibly mediated through inflammatory
processes, particularly arterial inflammation.38 Migraine is
known to co-occur with cardiovascular and neurovascular dis-
orders,16 and there is an ongoing debate as to whether migraine
is a disease of vascular or neurologic dysfunction.39 If these
adolescents’ frequent headaches relate in part to fear-induced
physiologic adaptations or maladaptations, their head pain
could represent early, modifiable predictors of later severe ill-
ness such as cardiovascular disease.17 Exposure to physical vi-
olence and sexual abuse could play a similar fueling role.13
Despite their limitations, it is likely that the findings of our
study may be applicable to other young survivors affected by
terror. Children and adolescents exposed to other violence
such as armed hostility or gun violence in their communities
or interpersonal violence among close relations may also be at
risk of developing recurrent or chronic headaches. Because
migraines and TTH are among the most common causes of
functional impairment in adolescents and adults alike,9 it is
likely that frequent complaints would add to the burden of
survivors, affecting their ability to function and cope. In
general populations indirectly exposed to terror and other
atrocities, physical proximity, psychological closeness, and
event-specific stigmatization are known to increase the risk of
adverse psychological outcomes.40 Headaches could distrib-
ute across similar patterns, adding to the burden of highly
exposed or vulnerable subgroups within the wider population.
Exposure to terror and other extreme violence increases the
risk of recurrent or chronic headache complaints, over and
above the effect of psychological distress and other known risk
factors. Emergency preparedness planning, surveillance, and
interventions may need to address survivors’ headaches to
hinder chronification and to facilitate recovery.
