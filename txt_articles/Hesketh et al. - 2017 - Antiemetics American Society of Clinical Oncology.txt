Purpose
To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for antiemetics in oncology.
Methods
A systematic review of the medical literature was completed to inform this update. MEDLINE, the
Cochrane Collaboration Library, and meeting materials from ASCO and the Multinational Associ-
ation for Supportive Care in Cancer were all searched. Primary outcomes of interest were
complete response and rates of any vomiting or nausea.
Results
Thirty-seven trials met prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria for this systematic review. Two
systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration were identified; one surveyed the pediatric literature.
The other compared the relative efficacy of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists.
Recommendations
Combined anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimens were reclassified as highly emetic.
Patients who receive this combination or any highly emetic agents should receive a 5-HT3 receptor
antagonist, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. A large trial validated
the equivalency of fosaprepitant, a single-day intravenous formulation, with aprepitant; either
therapy is appropriate. Preferential use of palonosetron is recommended for moderate emetic risk
regimens, combined with dexamethasone. For low-risk agents, patients can be offered dexameth-
asone before the first dose of chemotherapy. Patients undergoing high emetic risk radiation
therapy should receive a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist before each fraction and for 24 hours after
treatment and may receive a 5-day course of dexamethasone during fractions 1 to 5. The Update
Committee noted the importance of continued symptom monitoring throughout therapy. Clini-
cians underestimate the incidence of nausea, which is not as well controlled as emesis.

INTRODUCTION
The first American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) guideline for the use of antiemetics was pub-
lishedin19991andupdatedoncein2006.2Thisguide-
line provides clinicians with recommendations to
prevent vomiting and nausea among patients
undergoing antineoplastic therapy (chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting [CINV]) and/or
radiation therapy (radiation-induced nausea and
vomiting [RINV]) based on evidence from ran-
domized clinical trials.
METHODS
An Update Committee (Appendix Table A1, online only)
met twice to review data published since 2006 and update
recommendations as warranted.
Literature Review
Literature search strategy.
A systematic review on
the effectiveness of newer antiemetics (aprepitant and the
5-hydroxytryptamine-3 [5-HT3] receptor antagonists),
funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity, was initially reviewed for relevant publications. Two
MEDLINE searches (search strategy available in the Data
Supplement,
http://www.asco.org/guidelines/antiemet-
ics) were completed to identify additional randomized
controlled trials; a search of the Cochrane Collabora-
tion Library was also conducted. Meeting materials
from the ASCO and Multinational Association of Sup-
portive Care in Cancer annual meetings available since
the 2006 update were additionally culled. Only full pre-
sentations or posters were eligible; material available
only in abstract form was not considered.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Systematic reviews
and reports from randomized controlled trials eligible
for inclusion met the following criteria: the intervention
was for the treatment of nausea or vomiting secondary

 to cancer therapy; nausea and/or vomiting outcomes were reported; pa-
tients were observed for a minimum of 5 days (120 hours) after the
intervention; and each trial arm included a minimum of 25 randomly
assigned patients. Evidence tables are provided in the Data Supplement.
The guideline was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice
Guidelines Committee and the Board of Directors and underwent review and
approval for publication in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
Guideline Policy
This Executive Summary for physicians is an abridged summary of an
ASCO practice guideline. The practice guideline and this summary are not
intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treat-
ing physician. Practice guidelines do not account for individual variation
among patients and may not reflect the most recent evidence. This summary
does not recommend any particular product or course of medical treatment.
Use of the practice guideline and this summary is voluntary. The full practice
guideline and additional information are available at http://www.asco.org/
guidelines/antiemetics.
Guideline and Conflict of Interest
TheUpdateCommitteewasassembledinaccordancewithASCO’sCon-
flict of Interest Management Procedures for Clinical Practice Guidelines
(“Procedures,” summarized at http://www.asco.org/guidelinescoi). Members
of the Update Committee completed ASCO’s disclosure form, which requires
disclosureoffinancialandotherintereststhatarerelevanttothesubjectmatter
of the guideline, including relationships with commercial entities that are
reasonably likely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impact as the
result of promulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure include
employment relationships, consulting arrangements, stock ownership, hono-
raria, research funding, and expert testimony. In accordance with the Proce-
dures, the majority of the members of the Update Committee did not disclose
any such relationships.
RESULTS
The literature search from 2006 to December 2009 yielded a total of
271 unique citations from MEDLINE and 48 from meetings
(QUOROM Diagram available in Data Supplement). Thirty-six re-
ports met inclusion criteria and were selected for data extraction; 11
(30.6%) were reports from meetings.
GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS
CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING
Updated recommendations are listed in Table 1. Table 2 lists
intravenous agents organized by emetic risk. Dosing schedules for
each risk class are listed in Table 3.
Clinical Question 1
What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vom-
iting from highly emetogenic antineoplastic agents?
Recommendation 1.
The three-drug combination of a neuro-
kinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist (days 1 through 3 for aprepitant;
day 1 only for fosaprepitant), a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (day 1
only), and dexamethasone (days 1 through 3 or 1 through 4) is rec-
ommended for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
The Update Committee also recommended reclassification of the
combined anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen as
highly emetogenic.
Literature update and analysis 1.
Five new trials were identi-
fied.3-7 The study by Hoshi et al5 provided additional data (Data
Supplement) that support use of aprepitant for patients undergoing
high-risk chemotherapy.
An equivalency study compared fosaprepitant, a 1-day intrave-
nousformulationofaprepitant,withoralaprepitant.3,8Findingsdem-
onstrate equivalence between the agents for complete response and
both emesis and nausea control. Fosaprepitant was endorsed by the
Update Committee as an acceptable NK1 receptor antagonist.
THE BOTTOM LINE
American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical
Practice Guideline Update on Antiemetics
Intervention
● Antiemetics for patients receiving cancer therapy.
Target Audience
● Medical Oncologists, Radiation Oncologists,
Oncology Nurses.
Key Recommendations
● Patients who receive highly emetic chemotherapy regimens
should receive the three-drug combination of a neurokinin
1 (NK1) antagonist, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antag-
onist, and dexamethasone.
● The preferred 5-HT3 antagonist for patients who receive
moderate emetic chemotherapy regimens is palonosetron;
antiemetic treatment includes that agent combined with a
corticosteroid.
● Antiemetic treatment for patients who receive combination
chemotherapy should be determined according to the agent
with the greatest degree of emetic risk.
● Both dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist are recom-
mended for patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy.
● Pediatric patients receiving either high or moderate emetic
risk chemotherapy should be treated with a 5-HT3 antago-
nist and corticosteroids; higher weight-based dosing may be
required.
● For those treated with high emetic risk radiation therapy, a
5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction and a 5-day course of
dexamethasone are recommended.
● A 5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction is also recom-
mended before moderate-risk radiation; a 5-day course of
dexamethasone is optional.
● For patients who receive combination chemoradiotherapy,
antiemetic therapy is dictated by the emetogenicity of che-
motherapy, unless the emetic risk of radiation therapy is
higher.
Methods
● A systematic review of the literature published since the last
update of the guideline.

 Table 1. Summary of Recommendations
Clinical Situation
2006 Recommendation
2011 Reccomendation
Chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting
Highly emetogenic agents
The three-drug combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist,
dexamethasone, and aprepitant is recommended before
chemotherapy. In all patients receiving cisplatin and all
other agents of high emetic risk, the two-drug combination
of dexamethasone and aprepitant is recommended. The
Update Committee no longer recommends the
combination of a 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist and
dexamethasone on days 2 and 3.
The three-drug combination of an NK1 receptor antagonist
(days 1-3 for aprepitant; day 1 only for fosaprepitant), a 5-
HT3 receptor antagonist (day 1 only), and dexamethasone
(days 1-3 or 1-4) is recommended for patients receiving
highly emetogenic chemotherapy. This recommendation is
unchanged since the 2006 update, but reworded for
clarification. The Update Committee also recommended
reclassification of the combined AC regimen as highly
emetogenic.
Moderately emetogenic
agents
The three-drug combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist,
dexamethasone, and aprepitant is recommended for
patients receiving AC. For patients receiving chemotherapy
of moderate emetic risk other than AC, we recommend
the two-drug combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
and dexamethasone. In patients receiving AC, aprepitant
as a single agent is recommended on days 2 and 3. For all
other chemotherapies of moderate emetic risk, single-
agent dexamethasone or a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is
suggested for the prevention of emesis on days 2 and 3.
The two-drug combination of palonosetron (day 1 only) and
dexamethasone (days 1-3) is recommended for patients
receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. If
palonosetron is not available, clinicians may substitute a
first-generation 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist,
preferably granisetron or ondansetron. Limited evidence also
supports adding aprepitant to the combination. Should
clinicians opt to add aprepitant in patients receiving
moderate-risk chemotherapy, any one of the 5-HT3
antagonists is appropriate.
Low emetogenic agents
Dexamethasone 8 mg is suggested. No routine preventive
use of antiemetics for delayed emesis is suggested.
A single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before chemotherapy is
suggested. No change since 2006.
Minimally emetogenic
agents
No change from the original guideline. No antiemetic should
be administered routinely before or after chemotherapy.
No antiemetic should be administered routinely before or after
chemotherapy. No change from the original guideline.
Combination chemotherapy
No change from the original guideline. Patients should be
administered antiemetics appropriate for the chemothera-
peutic agent of greatest emetic risk.
Patients should be administered antiemetics appropriate for
the component chemotherapeutic (antineoplastic) agent of
greatest emetic risk. No change from the original guideline.
AC combinations are now classified as highly emetogenic.
Adjunctive drugs
Lorazepam and diphenhydramine are useful adjuncts to
antiemetic drugs but are not recommended as single
agents.
Lorazepam or diphenhydramine are useful adjuncts to
antiemetic drugs but are not recommended as single-agent
antiemetics. No change since 2006.
Complementary therapy
New question for 2011 update.
No published randomized controlled trial data that met
inclusion criteria are currently available to support a
recommendation about such therapies.
Pediatric patients
The combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist plus a corticosteroid is
suggested before chemotherapy in children receiving chem-
otherapy of high or moderate emetic risk. Because of
variation of pharmacokinetic parameters in children, higher
weight-based doses of 5-HT3 antagonists than those used
in adults may be required for antiemetic protection.

adults may be required for antiemetic protection. No change
since 2006.
High-dose chemotherapy with
stem-cell or bone marrow
transplantation
No change from original guideline. A 5-HT3 receptor
antagonist antiemetic combined with dexamethasone is
suggested. Aprepitant should be considered, although
evidence to support its use specifically in these patients is
lacking.
A 5-HT3 receptor antagonist combined with dexamethasone is
suggested. Aprepitant should be considered, although
evidence to support its use is limited.
Multiday chemotherapy
No change from the original guideline. It is suggested that
antiemetics appropriate for the risk class of the chemother-
apy, as outlined earlier, be administered for each day of
the chemotherapy and for 2 days after, if appropriate.
It is suggested that antiemetics appropriate for the emetogenic
risk class of the chemotherapy be administered for each day
of the chemotherapy and for 2 days after, if appropriate. No
change from the original guideline. The Update Committee
suggests, based on limited data, that patients receiving 5-
day cisplatin regimens be treated with a 5-HT3 antagonist in
combination with dexamethasone and aprepitant.
Emesis or nausea despite
optimal prophylaxis
No change from original guideline. The Update Committee
suggests that clinicians conduct a careful re-evaluation of
emetic risk, disease status, concurrent illnesses, and
medications; ascertain that the best regimen is being
administered for the emetic risk; consider adding
lorazepam or alprazolam to the regimen; and consider
substituting a high-dose intravenous metoclopramide for
the 5-HT3 antagonist or adding a dopamine antagonist to
the regimen.
Clinicians should re-evaluate emetic risk, disease status,

consider adding lorazepam or alprazolam to the regimen;
and consider adding olanzapine to the regimen or
substituting high-dose intravenous metoclopramide for the
5-HT3 antagonist or adding a dopamine antagonist to the
regimen.
Anticipatory nausea and
vomiting
No change since the original guideline. Use of the most
active antiemetic regimens appropriate for the chemothera-
py being administered to prevent acute or delayed emesis
is suggested. Such regimens may be used with the initial
chemotherapy, rather than assessing the patient’s emetic
response with less effective treatment. If anticipatory
emesis occurs, behavioral therapy with systematic
desensitization is effective and suggested.

 ThepilotstudybyHerringtonetal4comparedtwodosingsched-
ules of aprepitant (1 day v 3 days). No differences in rates of complete
response and emetic episodes for the overall study period were re-
ported.Studiestovalidatethenoninferiorityofsingle-dayoralaprepi-
tant are necessary to establish equivalence.
A pilot study compared olanzapine with aprepitant.6 Patients ran-
domly assigned to olanzapine experienced similar complete response
rates as patients who received aprepitant. Olanzapine was superior for
nauseacontrolduringtheoverallstudyperiod(P�.01).Additionaltrials
are necessary to define the role of olanzapine in this setting.
The AC combination was reclassified based on the high emetic
potentialofthecombinedagents.Datafromplacebo-controlledstud-
ies indicate that this combination causes vomiting in 85% of patients
not receiving antiemetic prophylaxis.9 This borders on the cutoff
defined for highly emetogenic agents.9
Clinical Question 2
What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting
from moderately emetogenic antineoplastic agents?
Recommendation 2. The two-drug combination of palonosetron
(day1only)anddexamethasone(days1through3)isrecommendedfor
patientsreceivingmoderatelyemetogenicchemotherapy.Ifpalonosetron
isnotavailable,cliniciansmaysubstituteafirst-generation5-HT3receptor
antagonist, preferably granisetron or ondansetron.
Limited evidence also supports adding aprepitant to the
combination. Should clinicians opt to add aprepitant in pa-
tients receiving moderate-risk chemotherapy, any one of the
5-HT3 antagonists is appropriate.
Literatureupdateandanalysis2a:5-HT3receptorantagonistequiv-
alency. The Update Committee evaluated therapeutic equivalence of
the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolas-
etron, palonosetron, ramosetron, and tropisetron). A Cochrane Re-
view of 5-HT3 antagonists used to prevent CINV was identified.10
Mosttrialscomparedondansetronandgranisetron.Fewtrialsinclud-
ing dolasetron and tropisetron were identified, and only one study
with palonosetron was included,11 which is described in this section.
No studies on ramosetron were included. Findings from the review
suggestequivalencybetweenondansetronandgranisetron,supported
by a meta-analysis (Data Supplement). Another meta-analysis from
Jordan et al12 assessed only first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antago-
nists. This study also indicates equivalency of granisetron and ondan-
setron and superiority of granisetron compared with tropisetron.
Astudycomparingramosetronandgranisetronwasidentified.13
Findingsindicatesimilarratesofcompleteresponseduringthefirst24
hours after chemotherapy. Research describing the efficacy of ramo-
setron during the 7-day period after chemotherapy is not available.
Three studies compared palonosetron with first-generation
5-HT3 antagonists.11,14,15 Findings from two larger studies11,16 sug-
gested that palonosetron provides superior protection against both
nausea and vomiting, particularly during the period from 24 to 120
hours after chemotherapy. However, the third study yielded nonsig-
nificant differences, which might be explained by the fact that it was
designed as a noninferiority trial.15
These studies were conducted in combined emetic risk popula-
tions, but not a non-AC moderately emetogenic population, and
comparedpalonosetronwithafirst-generation5-HT3receptorantag-
onist in which dexamethasone has also been included. The preference
for palonosetron is an extrapolation from the Saito et al11 data; when
an NK1 receptor antagonist is not used in the setting of cisplatin and
AC chemotherapy, the combination of palonosetron and dexameth-
asone is superior to granisetron and dexamethasone. By inference,
with non-AC moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, palonosetron
and dexamethasone are also likely to be superior to a first-generation
5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone.
Table 1. Summary of Recommendations (continued)
Clinical Situation
2006 Recommendation
2011 Reccomendation
Radiation-induced nausea
and vomiting
High risk
No change from original guideline. The Update Committee
suggests administration a 5-HT3 antagonist with or without
a corticosteroid before each fraction and for at least 24
hours after. There is no change from the original guideline.
On the basis of extrapolation from indirect evidence, the
Update Committee recommends that all patients should
receive a 5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction and for at
least 24 hours after completion of radiotherapy. Patients
should also receive a 5-day course of dexamethasone
during fractions 1-5.
Moderate risk
The Update Committee recommends a 5-HT3 antagonist
before each fraction.
The Update Committee recommends that patients receive a
5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction for the entire course
of radiotherapy. Patients may be offered a short course of
dexamethasone during fractions 1-5.
Low risk
No change from original guideline. The Update Committee
recommends a 5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction.
The Update Committee recommends a 5-HT3 antagonist alone
as either prophylaxis or rescue. For patients who experience
radiation-induced nausea and vomiting while receiving
rescue therapy only, prophylactic treatment should continue
until radiotherapy is complete.
Minimal risk
No change from original guideline. The Update Committee
suggests that treatment be administered on an as-needed
basis only. Dopamine or serotonin receptor antagonists are
advised. Antiemetics should be continued prophylactically
for each remaining radiation treatment day.
Patients should receive rescue therapy with either a dopamine
receptor antagonist or a 5-HT3 antagonist. Prophylactic
antiemetics should continue throughout radiation treatment
if a patient experiences radiation-induced nausea and
vomiting while receiving rescue therapy.
Combined chemotherapy
and radiation therapy
Patients should receive antiemetic prophylaxis according to
the emetogenicity of chemotherapy, unless the emetic risk
with the planned radiotherapy is higher. No change from
the original guideline.
Patients should receive antiemetic prophylaxis according to the
emetogenicity of chemotherapy, unless the emetic risk with
the planned radiotherapy is higher. No change from the
original guideline.

 Literature update and analysis 2b: NK1 receptor antagonist for
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. One trial evaluated the utility
of aprepitant in patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemo-
therapy.17 Improved CINV protection with aprepitant was noted. An
advantage of using aprepitant with moderate-risk agents is abbrevi-
ated dexamethasone dosing.
Literature update and analysis 2c: Dexamethasone dosing. Two
trials16,18 evaluated dexamethasone dosing, comparing 1- and 3-day
dexamethasone dosing combined with palonosetron. Findings from
these trials suggest similar outcomes with the two regimens. Addi-
tional trials that validate these findings may warrant a change to the
current recommendation.
Clinical Question 3
What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting
from low emetogenic antineoplastic agents?
Recommendation 3. A single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone be-
fore chemotherapy is suggested.

What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting
from minimally emetogenic antineoplastic agents?
Recommendation4. Noantiemeticshouldbeadministeredrou-
tinely before or after chemotherapy.
Literature update and analysis 4. No new evidence was identified.
Clinical Question 5
What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting
from combination chemotherapy?
Recommendation 5. Patients should be administered antiemet-
icsappropriateforthecomponentchemotherapeutic(antineoplastic)
agent of greatest emetic risk. AC combinations are now classified as
highly emetogenic.
Literature update and analysis 5. No new evidence was identified.
Clinical Question 6
What is the role of adjunctive drugs for nausea and vomiting
induced by cancer treatments?
Recommendation 6. Lorazepam and diphenhydramine are use-
ful adjuncts to antiemetic drugs but are not recommended as single-
agent antiemetics.
Literature update and analysis 6. One new trial evaluated the
impact of including olanzapine in antiemetic regimens.19 Benefits of
olanzapine were most evident during the days after chemotherapy.
Clinical Question 7
What is the role of complementary and alternative medi-
cine therapies to prevent or control nausea and vomiting in-
duced by chemotherapy?
Recommendation 7. No published randomized controlled trial
data that met inclusion criteria are currently available to support a
recommendation about such therapies.
Literature update and analysis 7. A phase III trial of ginger was
presented at an ASCO meeting in 2009.20 No significant differences in
the prevalence of vomiting and nausea between patients who received
ginger and placebo were reported.
A Cochrane Systematic Review of acupuncture-point stimula-
tion for CINV was published.21 However, this effort did not meet
prespecifiedinclusionandexclusioncriteriaforthissystematicreview.
SPECIAL POPULATIONS
Clinical Question 8
What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vom-
iting associated with cancer therapy for pediatric patients?
Recommendation8. Thecombinationofa5-HT3antagonistplusa
corticosteroid is suggested before chemotherapy in children receiving
chemotherapyofhighormoderateemeticrisk.Becauseofthevariationof
pharmacokinetic parameters in children, higher weight-based doses of
5-HT3 antagonists than those used in adults may be required for anti-
emeticprotection.Thereisnochangeinthisrecommendationfrom2006.
Literatureupdateandanalysis8. Asystematicreviewofavailable
therapies for CINV in children was published by the Cochrane Col-
laboration.22Fewtrialsidentifiedhadsimilaritiesininterventionchar-
acteristics, so the review was primarily qualitative. A pooled analysis
indicates that the addition of dexamethasone to the newer 5-HT3
antagonists provides benefits in the high emetic risk setting.
Twotrialswerealsoidentified.Oneassessedtheuseofaprepitant
in this population.23 The second evaluated the efficacy and safety of
palonosetron in pediatric patients.24
Clinical Question 9
Whatistheoptimaltreatmenttopreventnauseaandvomitingin
patients who are undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell
or bone marrow transplantation?
Recommendation 9.
A 5-HT3 receptor antagonist combined
with dexamethasone is recommended. Aprepitant should be consid-
ered, although evidence to support its use is limited.
Literature update and analysis 9. Two new studies were identi-
fied.25,26 One report detailed superior emetic control with palonose-
tron.Datasuggestthat2daysofpalonosetrontherapywilldecreasethe
likelihood of CINV. The other trial evaluated use of aprepitant during
chemotherapy conditioning. Patients who received aprepitant experi-
enced markedly improved vomiting control.
Clinical Question 10
What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting
for patients receiving multiday chemotherapy?
Recommendation 10. It is suggested that antiemetics appropri-
ate for the emetogenic risk class of the chemotherapy be administered
for each day of the chemotherapy and for 2 days after, if appropriate.
There is no change from the original guideline.
The Update Committee suggests, based on limited data, that
patients receiving 5-day cisplatin regimens be treated with a 5-HT3
antagonist in combination with dexamethasone and aprepitant.
Literature update and analysis 10. One trial of patients receiving
5-day cisplatin evaluated incorporation of metopimazine with tro-
pisetron.27 Findings suggested improved nausea and vomiting.
Noninferiority of the new granisetron transdermal system com-
paredwiththeoralformulationwasvalidatedinatrialofpatientswho
received multiday chemotherapy.28 The patch is indicated for use in
patients receiving high- or moderate-risk chemotherapy.
Clinical Question 11
What is the optimal antiemetic regimen for patients who experi-
ence nausea and vomiting secondary to cancer therapy despite opti-
mal prophylaxis?
Recommendation11. Languagefromthe2006guidelinewasrefor-
mattedforclarity.Cliniciansshouldre-evaluateemeticrisk,diseasestatus,
concurrent illnesses, and medications; ascertain that the best regimen is
being administered for the emetic risk; consider adding lorazepam or
alprazolam to the regimen; and consider adding olanzapine to the regi-
men or substituting high-dose intravenous metoclopramide for the
5-HT3 antagonist or adding a dopamine antagonist to the regimen.
Literatureupdateandanalysis11. Nonewevidencewasidentified.
Clinical Question 12
Whattreatmentoptionsareavailableforpatientswhoexperience
anticipatory nausea and vomiting?
Recommendation 12.
Use of the most active antiemetic regi-
mens appropriate for the chemotherapy being administered to pre-
vent acute or delayed emesis is suggested. Such regimens should be
used with initial chemotherapy, rather than assessing the patient’s
emetic response with less effective treatment. If anticipatory emesis

RADIATION-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING
An updated risk stratification table according to site of radiation
treatment is provided in Table 4.29 Dosing schedules according to risk
are listed in Table 5.
Clinical Question 13
What is the optimal prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting caused
by high emetic risk radiation therapy?
Recommendation 13. On the basis of extrapolation from indi-
rect evidence, the Update Committee recommends that all patients
should receive a 5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction and for at least
24hoursaftercompletionofradiotherapy.Patientsshouldalsoreceive
a 5-day course of dexamethasone during fractions 1 to 5.
Literature update and analysis 13. No new evidence was identi-
fied; the modification was based on evidence from the moderate-
risk category.30
Clinical Question 14
What is the optimal prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting caused
by moderate emetic risk radiation therapy?
Recommendation14. TheUpdateCommitteerecommendsthat
patients receive a 5-HT3 antagonist before each fraction for the entire
course of radiotherapy. Patients may be offered a short course of
dexamethasone during fractions 1 to 5.
Literature update and analysis 14. A new trial that evaluated the
efficacy of adding 5 days of dexamethasone during radiation to the
upper abdomen was identified.30 The addition of dexamethasone
provided superior vomiting protection and lower average nausea,
both secondary end points.
Clinical Question 15
What is the optimal treatment to manage nausea and vomiting
associated with low emetic risk radiation therapy?
Recommendation 15.
The Update Committee recommends a
5-HT3 antagonist alone as either prophylaxis or rescue. For patients

tic treatment should continue until radiotherapy is complete.
Literature update and analysis 15.
The recommendation was
modified to include rescue therapy.
Clinical Question 16
What is the optimal treatment to manage nausea and vomiting
associated with minimal emetic risk radiation therapy?
Recommendation 16.
Patients should receive rescue therapy
with either a dopamine receptor antagonist or a 5-HT3 antagonist.
Prophylactic antiemetics should continue throughout radiation treat-
ment if a patient experiences RINV while receiving rescue therapy.
Literatureupdateandanalysis16. Nonewevidencewasidentified.
Clinical Question 17
What is the optimal treatment to manage nausea and vomiting
during concurrent radiation and chemotherapy?
Recommendation 17.
Patients should receive antiemetic pro-
phylaxis according to the emetogenicity of chemotherapy, unless the
emetic risk with the planned radiotherapy is higher. There is no
change from the original guideline.
Literatureupdateandanalysis17. Nonewevidencewasidentified.
DRUG FORMULATIONS AND AGENT DOSING
Since the last update, an orally disintegrating ondansetron tablet
became available.31 The orally disintegrating form is equivalent with
respect to both emesis and nausea control. This is an acceptable alter-
native to the standard tablet.
Two other antiemetic agents received regulatory approval. As
discussed, the granisetron transdermal patch is an option for pa-
tients who receive high-risk, multiday chemotherapy. The Update
Committee suggests that this agent can also be considered for high-
or moderate-risk radiation.
Palonosetronisnowavailableorally.32Anoninferioritytrialdoc-
umented similarity between the oral and intravenous formulations
and validated the dose for the agents when taken orally.33
PATIENT AND CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION
The purpose of this section is to address aspects of patient-provider
communication that are relevant to decision making regarding selec-
tion of antiemetic therapy. Clinicians are encouraged to provide pa-
tients with a prescription for a rescue antiemetic therapy before the
patient leaves on the first day of treatment.
Data suggest that physicians frequently underestimate rates of
nausea and vomiting secondary to radiation therapy and chemother-
apy.34 To ensure optimal symptom management, clinicians should
assess symptoms throughout therapy. Patient response to antiemetic
treatment may change over time, requiring ongoing assessments and
modification to antiemetic strategies, as warranted.
Checklists can facilitate collection of direct patient reporting of
symptom presence and severity. For example, the National Cancer Insti-
tute is developing a Patient-Reported Outcomes version of its Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, which includes two items to
assessnausea.35Theseitemsareasfollows:“Inthelast7days,howOFTEN
did you have NAUSEA?” (Never/Rarely/Occasionally/Frequently/Al-
mostconstantly)and“Inthelast7days,whatwastheSEVERITYofyour
NAUSEA at its WORST?” (None/Mild/Moderate/Severe/Very severe).
Clinicians and patients are also encouraged to discuss cost of
treatment (Table 6) to assess whether cost is prohibitive, a hardship to
patients, or may impact treatment compliance.
HEALTH DISPARITIES
ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent evidence-based expert
recommendations on best practices to provide the highest level of
cancer care. However, it is important to note that many patients have
limited access to medical care. Racial and ethnic disparities in health
care contribute significantly to this problem in the United States.
Racial/ethnic minority patients with cancer suffer disproportionately
from comorbidities, experience more substantial obstacles to receiv-
ing care, are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, and are at
greater risk of receiving care of poor quality compared with other
Americans.36-39 Other patients lack access to care because of geogra-
phy and, specifically, distance from appropriate treatment facilities.
Other factors associated with disparities include advanced age, low
educational attainment, and low socioeconomic status. Awareness of
these disparities should be considered. Health care providers should
strivetoconsiderthefactorsfacedbyvulnerablepopulationstoensure
that all patients receive the highest level of cancer care.
