While transplantation represents a key tool for assessing in vivo functionality of neural stem
cells and their suitability for neural repair, little is known about the integration of grafted
neurons into the host brain circuitry. Rabies virus-based retrograde tracing has developed into
a powerful approach for visualizing synaptically connected neurons. Here, we combine this
technique with light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to visualize transplanted cells and
connected host neurons in whole-mouse brain preparations. Combined with co-registration of
high-precision three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) reference data sets,
this approach enables precise anatomical allocation of the host input neurons. Our data show
that the same neural donor cell population grafted into different brain regions receives highly
orthotopic input. These findings indicate that transplant connectivity is largely dictated by the
circuitry of the target region and depict rabies-based transsynaptic tracing and LSFM as
efficient tools for comprehensive assessment of host–donor cell innervation.

 T
ransplantation of cells into the central nervous system
has developed into a major avenue for replacing neurons
lost to neurodegenerative disease1,2. The suitability of
neural transplants for restoring or modulating neuronal function
critically depends on the ability of donor cells to engage in
synaptic interaction with the host brain circuitry, and appropriate
model systems are required to assess this integration process in
a preclinical scenario. Conventional electrophysiological methods
such as patch clamp analysis are limited in that they require
tedious identification of ‘pairs’ of connected cells, which restricts
their applicability to small numbers of neurons per brain3. While
optical methods such as calcium imaging or voltage-sensitive
reporters can extend resolution to entire neuronal ensembles,
they require close proximity between the recording device and the
recorded cells, for example, via prior sectioning of the tissue or
direct
access
to
localized
brain
regions
through
cranial
windows4,5. However, a comprehensive assessment of transplant
integration should ideally enable coverage of all transplanted
cells and host connection partners throughout the recipient brain.
Rabies virus (RABV)-based systems exploit the property of
this
virus
to
undergo
retrograde
transsynaptic
transport6.
Genetically
modified
RABV
variants
carrying
fluorescence
reporter genes have been used successfully to visualize syna-
ptically connected neurons7. Recently, optical tissue clearing
methods in combination with light sheet microscopy have
emerged as highly useful techniques for microscopic analysis of
tissue fragments and even entire organs without the need for
mechanical sectioning8–15.
Here we set out to design an approach combining RABV-based
transsynaptic tracing, tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence
microscopy (LSFM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
co-registration to enable qualitative and quantitative assessment
of human transplant innervation in the context of an entire
mouse brain.
Results
Transsynaptic tracing of graft innervation. To trace synaptic
innervation
of
human
neurons
in
a
mouse
background,
we employed long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem cells
(lt-NES cells) derived from human embryonic stem cells. Lt-NES
cells represent a stable neural stem cell population, which can be
extensively propagated while maintaining a stable neurogenic
potential yielding fully functional neurons both in vitro and
following transplantation into the rodent brain16,17. Due to their
robust proliferation and differentiation potential, lt-NES cells
lend themselves particularly well to genetic modification and
have been successfully used for lineage tracing, disease modelling
and cell-mediated gene transfer18–20. They exhibit a posterior
phenotype with an anterior hindbrain identity, and mostly
give rise to GABAergic interneurons as well as glutamatergic
neurons, a differentiation pattern maintained after transpla-
ntation into neonatal and adult hosts16,21. For the present
study we generated lt-NES cells ubiquitously expressing mRFP1
to label all transplanted cells, and a synapsin promoter-driven
combination of the avian TVA receptor, the B19 rabies
glycoprotein and a H2B.EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent
protein) fusion protein. The latter construct enables infection
of the transfected cells by pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted
RABV, replication of the virus and tracing of infected cells as
well as first order synaptically connected neurons (Fig. 1)22.
Lt-NES cells were stereotaxically delivered to the striatum or the
hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult unlesioned immunodeficient
Rag2 � / � mice. The immunodeficient host background was
chosen in order to enable long-term survival of the transpla-
nted xenogeneic cells23. Ten weeks later the human graft
(Supplementary Fig. 1a) was infected by stereotaxic injection of
recombinant pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted EGFP-expressing
RABV (RABVDG-EGFP(EnvA))6. Mice were killed 10 days
following injection of the virus. This 10-day time span is sufficient
for replication of the virus in the grafted human cells and
its retrograde propagation to afferent neurons24. To enable
whole-mount visualization, fixed entire brains were cleared in a
benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate-based solution (FluoClearBABB)
that enables long-term preservation of fluorescent proteins15
and subsequently subjected to LSFM.
3D imaging of neural grafts and afferent host neurons. Human
grafts labelled with mRFP1 were clearly discernible in the
two target sites (Fig. 2a,b). EGFP fluorescence revealed a large
fraction of double labelled cells reflecting RABVDG-EGFP
(EnvA)-infected donor neurons (Fig. 2c). In addition, numerous
EGFP-only-positive cells were detected in the vicinity of the grafts
as well as in more remote regions of the recipient brains, indi-
cating retrograde labelling of synaptically connected host neurons
projecting onto the transplant-derived neurons (Fig. 2c,d).
Interestingly, analysis of traced neurons revealed localization of
the cells predominantly in orthotopic projection areas. Mice with
hippocampal grafts showed numerous EGFP þ
cells in the
entorhinal cortex and the septum (Fig. 2c), that is, two pre-
dominant input regions of the hippocampus. EGFP-only-positive
neurons were also found inside the hippocampal formation, in
particular within the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region and
the stratum oriens, indicating innervation of the graft by resident
hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2c). In contrast, mice with striatal
grafts contained numerous EGFP-only-positive cells with pro-
jection neuron morphologies in the cortex, a major input area of
the
striatum
(Fig.
2d;
Supplementary
Fig.
1b)25.
Digital
reconstruction of the LSFM data sets enabled a detailed
representation of the transplanted neurons and their entire
afferent
connectome
in a
single
specimen
with sufficient
morphological resolution to detect neurites and archetypical
morphologies of host neurons in the different input regions
(Supplementary Movies 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 1b). The
innervation patterns of hippocampal and striatal grafts were
virtually indistinguishable from native afferents of these regions
as visualized in a parallel experiment by direct stereotaxic delivery
of a tracing virus cocktail (rAAV (mRFP1/TVA receptor), rAAV
(B19
glycoprotein)
and
RABVDG-EGFP(EnvA))
into
the
hippocampus
and
striatum
of
untransplanted
hosts
(Supplementary Fig. 1c,d)22,26. Similar innervation patterns
were obtained upon transplantation of an independent human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural precursor line
generated with a different protocol (small molecule-induced
neural precursor cells, Supplementary Fig. 2)27. Only very
occasional EGFP þ host neurons were detected outside the
neuroanatomically well-documented major input regions of the
two transplant target regions (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Movies 1
and 2; see also Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these
data indicate that lt-NES cell grafts in the dentate gyrus and the
striatum receive afferent innervation highly similar to that of
endogenous hippocampal and striatal neurons.
Anatomical allocation of input neurons via MRI co-registration.
A major disadvantage of tissue clearing techniques is that
anatomical landmarks are no longer visible within the translucent
tissue samples, which severely impedes the precise spatial
allocation of fluorescently labelled cells to distinct host brain
compartments. We have addressed this problem by co-registering
our LSFM data sets with high-precision three-dimensional (3D)
MRI reference data sets (for details see ‘Methods’ section)28,29.

 This approach employs established algorithms to extrapolate
spatial anatomical relationships from averaged reference brain
samples
to
the
individual
specimen.
Co-registration
data
confirmed orthotopic innervation of human lt-NES cell grafts
within the dentate gyrus by host neurons in the adjacent stratum
oriens and CA1 regions as well as from neurons within
the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex and the medial septal complex
(Fig. 3a). For recipient brains with striatal grafts co-registration
enabled a much more precise allocation of afferently connected
host neurons, which were not only detected in cortex and
the adjacent striatal tissue, but also in thalamus and the
globus pallidus. Furthermore, EGFP þ host neurons projecting
onto the graft could be allocated to cortical subregions such as
distinct areas within motor cortex and somatosensory cortex
(Fig. 3b). The depicted innervation patterns correspond to
endogenous trajectories reported in connectivity analyses for
endogenous neurons26,30 and underline the remarkable degree of
orthotopic innervation of grafted lt-NES cells.
We then used the acquired 3D data to explore whether whole-
mount LSFM and co-registration with MRI data sets could, in
principle, permit a quantitative assessment of afferently con-
nected host neurons in a single whole-brain preparation by
allocating EGFP þ
host cells to anatomical compartments.
Employing co-visualization of MRI-derived anatomical informa-
tion and LSFM data we could stratify the number of connected
host neurons across the major input regions. In animals that
received hippocampal grafts, the main afferents originated from
the hippocampal formation itself, the entorhinal cortex and the
septum. For grafts in the striatum, EGFP þ afferent neurons
could be observed in the cortex, the globus pallidus, the thalamus
and the striatum itself (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Table 1). Despite
the observed variations, which might reflect inherent variability in
surgical delivery and distribution of the transplanted cells, these
data indicate that LSFM and co-registration with MRI reference
data can largely facilitate quantitative assessment of connectivity
analyses and other applications such as migration studies.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate that RABV-based transsynaptic tracing
in combination with LSFM of cleared brain samples and
co-registration with MRI reference data enables qualitative
and quantitative assessment of the afferent connectome of
transplanted human neurons in a single whole-mount specimen
with high anatomical and morphological resolution. From
a biological point of view, the high degree of orthotopic
innervation of lt-NES cell grafts in both hippocampus and
striatum is remarkable, in particular since lt-NES cells are known
to exhibit a posterior phenotype corresponding to an anterior
hindbrain location16. Our observations are reminiscent to an
earlier study, which demonstrated that lt-NES cells grafted
into the adult unlesioned hippocampus or cortex develop
region-specific efferent projections onto orthotopic host brain
targets21. Collectively, the results of these studies suggest that
establishment of afferent and efferent connections between host
brain and grafted human neural stem cells is largely dictated
by
the
topology
of
pre-existing,
endogenous
fibre
tracts
and circuitries rather than the regional identity of the donor cells.
We expect the experimental system presented here to serve
as a useful tool for a number of biomedical applications. Striatal
transplantation of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons is
intensely pursued as therapeutic strategy for the treatment
of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, respectively31–33, and
the approach presented here could enable efficient assessment
of different donor cell populations with respect to their ability
to integrate synaptically into the host brain circuitry. We
also anticipate that our system will become useful for studying
the phenotype of patient-derived neurons in vivo. Since their
first description by Shinya Yamanaka34,35, iPS cells have become a
major tool for modelling human diseases in vitro. However, in vitro
studies are limited with respect to follow-up time and questions
relating to cell-tissue interactions. The approach reported here
could tackle some of these challenges and enable the assessment of
synaptic integration of patient-specific iPS cell-derived neurons in
an in vivo setting, thereby facilitating mechanistic studies into the
pathogenesis
of
neurodevelopmental,
neuropsychiatric
and
neurodegenerative disorders. As for the latter, transsynaptic
spread of disease has become a major topic of research36–38, and
visualization of synaptic connections onto grafted patient-derived
neurons may provide a formidable tool to mechanistically dissect
this phenomenon in an experimental in vivo scenario. Finally, our
system might also be helpful for benchmarking the synaptic
integration potential of novel synthetic cell sources such as neural
precursors and neurons generated by direct transcription factor-
based cell fate conversion39–42.
Methods
Neural stem cell culture. Long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial like stem
cells (lt-NES cells; derived from embryonic stem cell line I3) were generated
by manual isolation of rosette-like structures of plated neuralized embryoid
bodies as described previously16 and continuously propagated on
poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated plates in N2 medium supplemented with
B27 (1 ml ml � 1, Invitrogen), 10 ng ml � 1 FGF2 and 10 ng ml � 1 EGF (both from
R&D systems). Neuronal differentiation was induced by removing the growth
factors FGF2 and EGF from the media and culturing the cells in Neurobasal
medium supplemented with B27 (1:50, Invitrogen) and DMEM/F12 supple-
mented with N2 (1:100) mixed at a 1:1 ratio and supplemented with 300 ng ml � 1
cAMP for Z4 weeks. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.

 Vector design and lentiviral transduction. In order to introduce labelling
and tracing constructs into lt-NES cells, we employed two distinct lentiviral vectors.
For permanent labelling of the cells, a construct constitutively expressing mRFP1
was used (pLentiWE-Ef1a-mRFP1; Life Technologies). In order to restrict
expression of the tracing cassette to mature human neurons we used a synapsin
promoter driving the coturnix japonica Rous sarcoma virus receptor (TVA-R)
recognizing the subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A)-pseudo-
typed, glycoprotein-deleted RABV, Histon2B.EGFP nuclear fusion protein as
well as the rabies SAD B19 glycoprotein all linked by a self-cleaving 2 A peptide

 plasmid #3019). To facilitate fast enrichment of lentivirally transduced cells,
the expression cassette was transferred to the pLVXTP backbone which
contains a puromycin resistance gene (Clonetech) by opening it using XhoI and
MluI digestion and ligation with the PCR amplified (forward primer 50-GCA
GCAGTCGACACTGCAGAGGGCCCTGC-30; reverse primer 50-GCAGCA
ACGCGTTTGTCTGAGGTGTGACTGGAAAACC-30) and SalI/MluI digested
tracing cassette. Lentiviral particles were generated and concentrated using the
polyethylene glycol method as described previously20,43. Briefly, 293FT cells
(Life Technologies) were transfected with the lentiviral plasmids pLVX-SynHTB
or pLentiWE-Ef1a-mRFP1 and the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope
plasmid pMD2.G. Supernatant was collected on day 2 and day 3 after transfection,
filtered (0.45 mm) and enriched by centrifugation. Lt-NES cells were transduced
with enriched pLentiWE-Ef1a-mRFP1 supernatant. Two days later they were
subjected to a 3-day selection with 20 mg ml � 1 blasticidin (Life Technologies).
Eleven days later, cells were transduced with concentrated pLVX-SynHTB
supernatant. Two days later they were subjected to a 3-day selection with
1 mg ml � 1 puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Production of pseudotyped rabies virus. BHK cells (B1.5 � 107; ATCC

with 15 mg plasmid DNA (pCAGG/SAD-G) by calcium phosphate transfection.
Twenty-four hours later RABVDG-EGFP was added at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 3. After additional 48 h incubation the RABVDG-EGFP
containing supernatant was equally distributed onto four 15 cm plates containing
pCAGGs/SAD-G (15 mg per plate) transfected BHK cells (B1.5 � 107 cells per
plate)6. Two days later the virus-containing supernatant was applied onto four
15 cm plates containing BHK-EnvARGCD cells (B1.5 � 107 cells per plate)

 at a MOI of 1.5 for pseudotyping. After 12 h cells were trypsinized and replated
onto eight dishes. Pseudotyped RABV (RABVDG-EGFP(EnvA))-containing
supernatant was collected 2 days later. The supernatant was cleared by 10 min
centrifugation at 2,000 r.p.m. at 4 �C and subsequently filtered through a 0.45 mm
filter (Nalgene SFCA Bottletop Filter, ThermoFisher Scientific). The virus was
pelleted by 90 min centrifugation at 25,000 r.p.m. (SW28, 4 �C) in a Beckman
80 K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). After centrifugation the supernatant was
discarded. The virus pellet was aspirated in ice-cold PBS (pH 6.8) and stored at
� 70 �C. Virus titres were determined by serial dilution and overnight infection
of primary cortical neurons that had been infected with rAAV1/2 expressing
TVA IRES mCherry under control of the human synapsin promoter. Three
days later the number of fluorescent SADDG-EGFP containing neurons were
counted. Titres of RABVDG-EGFP(EnvA) used for in vivo injections were
B2.5 � 107 ml � 1.
Transplantation of Rag2 � / � mice. Cell transplantation into the hippocampus
(n ¼ 21) or striatum (n ¼ 17) of adult female mice (8 weeks; Rag2 � / �
(genetic background: B10;B6-Rag2tm1Fwa Il2rgtm1Wjl), Taconic Biosciences Inc.)23
was performed as described previously21. Briefly, lt-NES cells were trypsinized,
treated with DNAse (0.1% at RT for 10 min), filtered through a cell mesh, spun and
re-suspended in Cytocon Buffer II (B60,000 cells ml � 1 or 40,000 cells ml � 1, as
indicated). Analgesia and anaesthesia of mice was initiated using a mixture of
carprofen (5 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.), fentanyl (0.05 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.), midazolam
(5 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.) and medetomidine (0.5 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.). Heads were shaved
and sterilized and positioned in the stereotaxic frame. The scalp was opened
sufficiently to reveal lambda and bregma points. A stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting)
was used to target the desired coordinates (2.4 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral and
1.4 mm ventral for hippocampal grafts and 0.8 mm anterior, 1.8 mm lateral and
2.7 mm ventral for striatal transplants). To penetrate the skull, fascia and
periosteum were removed with forceps, and a burr hole was drilled using a bone
drill while retaining a clean and sterile area. The dura was perforated using a
surgical scalpel, and a glass injection needle containing 1 ml cell suspension was
lowered slowly (within 30 s) down to the target depth. The cell suspension was
injected carefully (over 3–15 min dependent on resistance), the needle was
withdrawn slowly, and the hole in the skull was sealed by application of bone wax.
The skin was closed with wound clips and the anaesthetic was antagonized by
injection of naloxone (0.4 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.), flumazenil (0.5 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.) and
atipamezole (5 mg kg � 1 BW i.p.). Mice were transferred to a warming pad for
standard post-operative care. Ten weeks later, RABVDG-EGFP(EnvA) was used to
infect the grafted cells via the same stereotaxic approach. Mice were killed 10 days
later by perfusion fixation. From the 38 transplant recipients, 32 were used for
conventional assessment of cell survival, cell differentiation and migration and to
determine the optimal time point and follow-up window for RABV infection of the
graft. For each transplantation site 3 randomly selected mouse brains were
subjected to the clearing procedure, subsequently imaged by LSFM and included
into the co-registration process. The studies were conducted in accordance
with the legal requirements of the local authorities (permit number:
AZ84.02.04.2013.A368).
Immunohistochemical analysis. Ten days following injection of RABVDG-
EGFP(EnvA), mice were anaesthetized with ketamine (80 mg kg � 1; Pfizer)/
xylazine (10 mg kg � 1; Bayer), and subjected to perfusion with PBS/Heparin
(1,000 I.E. ml � 1, Ratiopharm) followed by PFA (4%, 4 �C, Sigma). Coronal
sections (30 mm) were generated using a cryostat, dried, reconstituted and washed
in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
The expression of human nuclei marker was analysed by blocking the sections
in 10% normal horse serum (NHS), 1% normal goat serum (NGS) and
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and applying primary antibody (hNuc; Millipore,
MAB4383; 1:500, o/n) and secondary antibody (Alexa 555, A-21422;
Thermofisher; 30 min) in 3% NHS, 1% NGS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Tissue clearing and light sheet fluorescence imaging. For clearing of whole
adult mouse brains, specimens were treated as previously described15. Briefly,
tissue was dehydrated using a tert-butanol-based ascending alcohol series at
30 �C (pH 9.5) and mounted in a triethylamine pH-adjusted benzyl alcohol/benzyl
benzoate mixture (BABB, pH 9.5). A purpose-built light sheet fluorescence
microscope was used to visualize the samples at a voxel size of approximately
1.6 � 1.6 � 3.2 mm3, resulting in B60 GB of stitched 16 bit raw data
sets per channel and hemisphere15.
3D reconstruction of imaged data. For generation of traverse Z-projections,
the maximum intensity projection algorithm of Fiji was used (http://pacific.mpi-
cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Fiji). The representation of the generated data as a 3D
object was performed using the Surpass view in Imaris while virtual sections of
varying thickness were generated using the extended feature of the slice tool
(Bitplane). Data processing was performed on a custom-built power workstation
equipped with two Xeon E5-2667v3 CPUs, 512 GB memory and a Nvidia
Titan-X GPU.
Co-registration. Briefly, mapping anatomical regions to the stack of LSFM images
was done by co-registering downsized microscopy images to a MRI template,
which was connected to dedicated mouse brain atlases. Applying the inverse of the
computed transformation matrices to the atlases aligns them to the individual
microscopy images.
Coronal MRI images (RARE, TE/TEeff ¼ 10.8/32.5 ms TR ¼ 5,500 ms,
RARE-factor ¼ 8, NA ¼ 2) of 9-week-old, healthy C57 Bl6 mice (n ¼ 24) with an
in-plane resolution of 68 and 200 mm slice thickness were acquired on a 9.4T
Bruker Biospec 94/20, using a Bruker Cryoprobe. The individual MR-images were
co-registered and those co-registered images were averaged to form a template
covering the normal anatomical variations of the mouse brain as a reference data
set for further processing.
Two MRI atlases referencing different anatomical structures on MRI images
in the mouse brain were combined, and their labels were merged28,29. The
MRI template was co-registered once to the atlas resulting in a transformation
matrix M1.
LSFM images were cropped to an in-plane resolution of a multiple of
10 (for example, 7,350 � 5,100 pixels) and then downsized in-plane by factor of five
gaining a set of images of medium resolution (for example, 1,470 � 1,020 pixels)
to keep computational time for further processing reasonable. As the clearing
procedure results in tissue shrinkage, the microscopy data were scaled during the
co-registration process to fit the template (scaling factors ranged between 1.28 and
1.40; average 1.37±0.09). The data set was flipped from axial to coronal
orientation to match the orientation of the MRI template and atlas. The green
fluorescence channel of each subject was further sampled down by an additional
factor of 2 in plane and a factor of 4 for the number of slices, gaining a data set with
a resolution more similar to the MRI atlases. The background was masked to zero
intensity before it was co-registered using flirt Ver. 5.5 from FSL Ver. 4.1.9
(refs 44,45), to the MRI template resulting in a transformation matrix M2. The
combination of M1 and M2: M1M2 ¼ M3 or its inverse M3
� 1 was then used to
transform and overlay either the medium sized LSFM images to the atlas or the
atlas to the LSFM data, respectively.
Stereology. Quantitation of the number of transplanted mRFP1-positive human
cells was performed based on 3D light sheet microscope data sets using the Optical
Fractionator approach46,47 with StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience, Inc.,
Williston, VT). The fractionated sampling scheme has the advantage of being
insensitive to the volumetric distortion produced by clearing47. Systematic random
sampling of tissue was performed in virtual horizontal sections set at a defined
section height of 40 mm sampled at 80 mm intervals. This is the equivalent of
sampling a one-in-three series of conventional histological sections cut at 40 mm.
Using virtual tissue, top and bottom guard zones were not utilized as tissue
sectioning artifacts were absent. Imaging through the optical dissector probe height
was continuous as a function of the axial resolution of image collection and
rendering.
Within each sample section, two regions of interest were defined, a graft core
region, which contained the dense distribution of cells and an integration zone,
defined as the region outside the graft core extending as far as any cells could be
detected. Due to the large differences in cell density, appropriate optical dissector
XY dimensions were determined for each region by oversampling/resampling to
lower sampling density while maintaining a low coefficient of error47. The optical
dissector probe was set to 50 mm by 50 mm. Sampling for both regions was
performed using a grid step size of 200 mm by 200 mm. The coefficient of error was
accepted at or below 0.10.
