Abstract
Background
A high proportion of women start pregnancy overweight or obese. According to the develop-
mental overnutrition hypothesis, this could lead offspring to have metabolic disruption
throughout their lives and thus perpetuate the obesity epidemic across generations. Con-
cerns about this hypothesis are influencing antenatal care. However, it is unknown whether
maternal pregnancy adiposity is associated with long-term risk of adverse metabolic profiles
in offspring, and if so, whether this association is causal, via intrauterine mechanisms, or
explained by shared familial (genetic, lifestyle, socioeconomic) characteristics. We aimed to
determine if associations between maternal body mass index (BMI) and offspring systemic
cardio-metabolic profile are causal, via intrauterine mechanisms, or due to shared familial
factors.
Methods and findings
We used 1- and 2-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis, and a negative-con-
trol (paternal BMI) to examine the association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and off-
spring serum metabolome from 3 European birth cohorts (offspring age at blood collection:
16, 17, and 31 years). Circulating metabolic traits were quantified by high-throughput
nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics. Results from 1-stage IPD meta-analysis (N =
5327 to 5377 mother-father-offspring trios) showed that increasing maternal and paternal
BMI was associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic profile in offspring. We observed

 strong positive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-lipoproteins, VLDL-
cholesterol (C), VLDL-triglycerides, VLDL-diameter, branched/aromatic amino acids, glyco-
protein acetyls, and triglycerides, and strong negative associations with high-density lipo-
protein (HDL), HDL-diameter, HDL-C, HDL2-C, and HDL3-C (all P < 0.003). Slightly stronger
magnitudes of associations were present for maternal compared with paternal BMI across
these associations; however, there was no strong statistical evidence for heterogeneity
between them (all bootstrap P > 0.003, equivalent to P > 0.05 after accounting for multiple
testing). Results were similar in each individual cohort, and in the 2-stage analysis. Offspring
BMI showed similar patterns of cross-sectional association with metabolic profile as for
parental pre-pregnancy BMI associations but with greater magnitudes. Adjustment of paren-
tal BMI–offspring metabolic traits associations for offspring BMI suggested the parental
associations were largely due to the association of parental BMI with offspring BMI. Limita-
tions of this study are that inferences cannot be drawn about the role of circulating maternal
fetal fuels (i.e., glucose, lipids, fatty acids, and amino acids) on later offspring metabolic pro-
file. In addition, BMI may not reflect potential effects of maternal pregnancy fat distribution.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that maternal BMI–offspring metabolome associations are likely to be
largely due to shared genetic or familial lifestyle confounding rather than to intrauterine
mechanisms.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• It is unknown whether maternal pregnancy adiposity is associated with long-term risk
of adverse metabolic profiles in offspring, and if so, whether this association is causal via
intrauterine mechanisms or explained by shared familial (genetic, lifestyle, socioeco-
nomic) characteristics.
• Our study was designed to unpick whether maternal pregnancy BMI–offspring meta-
bolic traits associations were due to intrauterine mechanisms (involving overfeeding of
the developing fetus) or shared familial characteristics (or both of these) by using pater-
nal BMI–offspring metabolic traits associations as a negative control.
• If maternal associations represent causal intrauterine effects, as opposed to being due to
shared familial factors, they should be stronger than paternal associations with the same
metabolic traits.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We looked at associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and 153 offspring
serum metabolic traits, in adolescence and adulthood, in 3 independent European birth
cohorts (>10,000) and compared these to paternal BMI–offspring metabolic traits as a
negative control.

 • Paternal BMI was used as a negative control as it will share most of the confounders of
the main exposure (maternal BMI) but could not directly influence offspring’s meta-
bolic traits via an intrauterine effect.
• We found very little evidence of a markedly stronger association of maternal BMI with
offspring outcomes.
What do these findings mean?
• Our findings are more supportive of shared familial factors than intrauterine develop-
mental overnutrition mechanisms for associations of maternal BMI with offspring met-
abolic traits.
• Interventions to reduce BMI in all family members may be more beneficial for cardio-
metabolic health than focusing on reducing maternal pre-conception or pregnancy
BMI.
Introduction
In Western populations, the proportion of women who start pregnancy overweight or obese
(body mass index [BMI] �25 kg/m2) has increased over the last 20–30 years and is now esti-
mated to be between 20%–50% [1,2].
The developmental origin of adult diseases hypothesis proposes that greater maternal adi-
posity in pregnancy can prime changes in fetal metabolism that result in a life-long risk of
greater adiposity and metabolic dysregulation [3]. As more adipose women have higher circu-
lating gestational glucose, lipids, and fatty acids (FAs), the fetus is purportedly overfed, which
may lead to changes in energy metabolism and the fetal endocrine system, potentially resulting
in differences in appetite control, risk of obesity, and adverse metabolism throughout the lives
of offspring. This may perpetuate obesity and adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes across gen-
erations, as the daughters of overweight women would be predisposed to enter pregnancy
overweight and with adverse metabolic profiles themselves. Concerns about this hypothesis
are influencing antenatal care; for example, recommendations related to gestational weight
gain and the new criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes are aimed at reducing future off-
spring obesity and adverse metabolism [4,5]. However, whether the associations of maternal
adiposity and associated traits with offspring outcomes are causal is unknown, and if they are
causal, then the mechanisms are unclear [4,6,7].
A recent study using genetic instrumental variables (Mendelian randomisation) found that
intrauterine exposure to greater maternal adiposity and fasting glucose results in greater birth-
weight and ponderal index [6]; however, Mendelian randomisation studies, within siblings
analyses and negative control studies do not support a causal intrauterine effect of greater
maternal gestational adiposity on later offspring adiposity levels [8,9]. Exposure to greater
maternal adiposity and associated metabolic disruption could, nonetheless, result in more
adverse metabolic profiles in offspring via intrauterine mechanisms even in the absence of an
effect on offspring adiposity, for example, through a direct effect on appetite control of the
development of the liver and pancreas.

 The aim of this study was to examine associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI
and multiple offspring serum lipids, lipoproteins, and metabolites in adolescence and adult-
hood (i.e., when offspring are in their reproductive years), using paternal BMI as a negative
control. Our hypotheses are that 2 key paths could explain the association of maternal pre-
pregnancy BMI with offspring future metabolic traits: (i) intrauterine developmental overnu-
trition and (ii) confounding of this potential effect via shared familial genetics, socioeconomic,
lifestyle, and behavioural characteristics (Fig 1). It is established that to adjust for all such con-
founding is impossible in most datasets, and consequently, conventional multivariable
approaches are likely to be very biased by residual confounding [10]. Paternal BMI assessed at
the same time as maternal BMI is an ideal negative control as it will be influenced by the
shared familial characteristics that we are concerned would confound the maternal BMI asso-
ciation, but it could not plausibly result in intrauterine developmental overnutrition [11].
Thus, if maternal associations represent causal intrauterine effects, as opposed to being due to
shared familial factors, they should be stronger than paternal associations with the same out-
comes [4].

 follow-up at 17 years), Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 and 1986 studies [14,15] (NFBC66
and NFBC86; offspring follow-up at 31 and 16 years, respectively). Full details of the cohorts
are provided in S1 Text and S1 Fig.
Parental exposures and covariables
In ALSPAC, parental pre-pregnancy weight, height, education, occupation, and smoking
behaviour, and maternal parity were obtained during pregnancy via questionnaires. Paternal
weight and height were reported by the mothers (i.e., the recruited pregnant women). Off-
spring sex was obtained from obstetric records, and parental and offspring ages were calcu-
lated from their dates of birth and dates of questionnaires or clinic assessments. Parental
occupation was classified into social class groups from I (managerial) to IV (unskilled manual
workers). Highest educational qualification for both parents was collapsed into 1 of 5 catego-
ries from none/Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE; national school exams at age 16) to
university degree.
In NFBC86, parental height, weight, occupation, and smoking status; offspring sex; and
maternal parity were collected using questionnaires given to all mothers at their first antenatal
clinic visit. As in ALSPAC, paternal weight and height were reported by their partner (the
mother). Level of education was obtained from questionnaires in 2001–2002. Parental and off-
spring ages were derived from their dates of birth and dates of assessments. Parental education
was categorised into 8 categories from no occupational education to university degree, and
occupation was categorised into 6 categories from entrepreneur to no occupation.
In NFBC66, maternal height, weight, occupation, smoking status, parity, and offspring sex
were reported by mothers at the first antenatal clinic visit (16th week of gestation), or in ques-
tionnaires administered between the 24th and 28th week of gestation. Offspring age at serum
collection was derived from their date of birth and date of attendance at the 1997–1998 follow-
up clinic. Maternal age in pregnancy was derived from year of birth and the date of pregnancy
questionnaire completion. Education was categorised into 9 categories from none or circulat-
ing school to beyond matriculation exam, and occupation was categorised into 5 categories
ranging from I (highest social class) to V (no occupation). Information on paternal BMI was
not collected in NFBC66; therefore, this cohort’s data were used to test for replication of the
maternal-offspring association results only.
In all cohorts, head of household social class was defined as the highest occupation of either
parent. For the 1-stage individual participant data (IPD) [16–18] meta-analysis, education and
head of household occupational social class categories were harmonised between cohorts (see
S1 Text and S1 Table). Individual cohort variables were used in the 2-stage IPD meta-analysis.
In ALSPAC, parents-offspring trios where the mother had reported that her partner was not
the biological father of the offspring, and those for whom this information was missing, were
excluded; this information was not available for the Northern Finland Birth Cohort studies
(NFBCs). Differences in fetal growth in multiple pregnancies suggest that intrauterine effects
are different for singletons and multiple births [19]: for the purpose of this study we consid-
ered only singleton pregnancies. For our analyses, we used data from 5,327 to 5,377 mother-
father-offspring trios from ALSPAC and NFBC86, and 4,841 to 4,874 mother-offspring pairs
from NFBC66 who had data on parental BMI, offspring metabolite, and covariables.
Outcomes: Metabolic profiling
A comprehensive profiling of offspring circulating lipids, lipoproteins, and metabolites was
done by a high-throughput NMR metabolomics platform, providing a snapshot of offspring
serum metabolome at follow-up [20,21]. In ALSPAC, offspring metabolic traits were assessed

 on fasting (minimum 6 hours) plasma at 2 ages (mean ages of 15.5 and 17.8), and we used data
from either of these. As we were interested in lasting effects into reproductive years, we priori-
tised measures from the older age follow-up and used the earlier measures only for participants
who did not have measures at mean age 17.8. Mean age at assessment in the whole cohort after
using both time points was 17. Participants of both NFBCs fasted overnight before serum col-
lection on the morning of clinic attendance (8 to 11 AM) at mean age 16 (NFBC86) and 31
(NFBC66) years.
Collectively, the 153 metabolic traits measured by the platform represent a broad molecular
signature of systemic metabolism [20,21]. The platform provided simultaneous quantification
of lipoprotein lipids and subclasses, FAs and FA compositions, ketone bodies, amino acids, as
well as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis-related metabolites in absolute concentration units.
This platform has been applied in various large-scale epidemiological and genetic studies [22–
25]; the detailed protocol, including information on quality control, has been published else-
where [21,26] and more information is given in S1 Text.
Statistical analysis
A draft analysis plan was written by DLSF and DAL in March 2015. This was shared with
other cohort analysts and investigators, and a final analysis plan was agreed upon in September
2015 (see S2 Text), with analyses commencing in early 2016. Two changes were made to the
analysis plan after analyses had begun. In October 2016, in response to one of the coauthors, it
was agreed that we would explore whether parental BMI–offspring metabolic trait associations
were attenuated with additional adjustment for offspring BMI. In our original plan, we had
agreed to explore offspring BMI–offspring metabolic trait associations but had not planned to
adjust parental BMI–offspring metabolic traits for offspring BMI. In May 2017, in response to
one reviewer, we constructed a random intercept and slope multilevel model to further assess
the agreement between maternal and paternal associations. In our original plan, we proposed
to assess this using linear regression only. No further changes to the original plan were made.
Data cleaning and checking were performed separately for each cohort. One-stage and
2-stage IPD [16–18] meta-analyses were performed to assess the associations of maternal pre-
pregnancy BMI with offspring metabolic profiles, using paternal BMI as a negative control.
The term IPD relates to the data recorded for each participant in a study [16]. Linear regres-
sion models were adjusted for parental age, smoking, education, head of household social
class, maternal parity, offspring age at blood collection, and sex. Robust standard errors were
estimated for all associations and probability values, as some metabolic traits concentrations
had skewed distributions.
We conducted 3 sets of IPD meta-analysis that included maternal versus paternal
comparisons:
1. A 1-stage IPD meta-analysis restricted to the 2 cohorts with data on both maternal and
paternal BMI (ALSPAC and NFBC86) which were our main analyses. In these analyses, off-
spring metabolic traits were standardised (z-scored) across both cohorts and then regressed
on maternal and paternal z-scored BMI (again standardised across both cohorts, separately
for mothers and fathers) with adjustment for the harmonised covariables and a binary vari-
able reflecting whether the participant was from ALSPAC or NFBC86. These analyses were
conducted on between 5,327 and 5,377 trios (numbers with complete data varied slightly
for different metabolic traits). This approach has greater statistical efficiency than a 2-stage
IPD meta-analysis, and restricting to the 2 cohorts with both maternal and paternal BMI
ensures that exposure-outcome comparisons are possible within all parental-offspring trio

 data available. It assumes that the 2 cohorts are from the same population to which infer-
ences are being made.
2. A 1-stage IPD meta-analysis, undertaken as described above, but including the maternal
BMI–offspring metabolite associations from NFBC66. This sensitivity analysis assessed
associations of maternal BMI with offspring metabolic traits in up to 4,874 additional
mother-offspring pairs (10,181 to 10,251 in total) from ALSPAC, NFBC86, and NFBC66
and compared these with the same associations of paternal BMI with offspring metabolic
traits in ALSPAC and NFBC86 only (N = 5,327 to 5,277). This has greater statistical power
for the maternal associations and for determining differences between mothers and fathers.
It assumes that all 3 cohorts are from the same population to which inference is being
made. This includes the assumption that paternal BMI would be similarly associated with
offspring metabolic traits in NFBC66 as in the other 2 cohorts if we would have been able to
model data on this unmeasured trait.
3. 2-stage IPD meta-analysis in which the regression outputs of standardised offspring meta-
bolic traits with standardised parental BMI were derived separately for each cohort and for
maternal and paternal BMI (stage 1) was performed, and then pooled results from each
cohort were meta-analysed together using the random effects inverse-variance-weighted
method (stage 2). The standardisation of offspring metabolic traits and parental BMI was
undertaken within each cohort in this method. We used this method to (a) explore whether
our standardisation across cohorts of offspring metabolic traits and parental BMI, and har-
monisation of potential confounders in the 1-stage IPD meta-analyses, had notably influ-
enced results; (b) test for heterogeneity in association results between the 3 cohorts (2 for
paternal BMI–offspring metabolic traits associations) using the I2 statistics [27], which pro-
vides a test of replication of our findings and tests our assumption that the cohorts are likely
to be from the same population to which we want to make inference; and (c) test, by using a
random effects method for pooling results (even if there was little evidence of heterogene-
ity), whether results were similar if we relaxed the assumption of the cohorts all being from
the same underlying population (this approach provides results that are interpreted as the
average across studies, assuming that these might reflect different populations).
Magnitudes of maternal and paternal associations were compared by presenting the results
one on top of the other so that the extent to which point estimates and their respective confi-
dence intervals differ (or not) can be clearly seen. In addition, the magnitudes of maternal and
paternal associations were compared to each other using linear fit and a random intercept and
slope multilevel model. The latter was used to overcome the fact that as metabolic traits are
correlated, the independence assumption of the linear fit analyses are likely to be violated,
which could bias results. We defined clusters according to metabolic trait-classes, which
resulted in 27 classes with between 1 and 9 metabolic traits in each class (see S2 Table). This
model is composed of a fixed effects part, which is the average association of maternal BMI–
offspring metabolic trait point estimates with paternal BMI–offspring metabolic trait point
estimates for each metabolic trait (level 1) and the same associations of maternal and paternal
point estimates, within their trait classes, allowing the intercepts and slopes of these to all vary
from the level 1 averages (associations in these classes are level 2). Conditional (R2
cond) and mar-
ginal (R2
marg) goodness of linear fit [28] were computed. These represent the agreement between
maternal and paternal point estimates when clustering within classes is taken into account
(R2
marg), plus when variance explained by the individual classes is included (R2
cond). One-stage
IPD associations were compared to the corresponding 2-stage IPD for maternal and paternal
BMI separately, also by examining their linear fit. The differences between maternal and

 paternal associations (in all 3 approaches) were calculated from the bootstrap replicate distri-
bution (1,000 replications). To this end, we sampled with replacement parental-offspring trios
so that the correlation structure of the original dataset was maintained. Beta-estimates and
standard errors were empirically calculated from the mean and SD of the bootstrap distribu-
tion, respectively. All P values were calculated using bootstrap means and standard errors and
compared to a z-distribution.
To establish a threshold that takes into account multiple testing and the correlation struc-
ture of the metabolic traits data, principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out on the
z-scored metabolic traits data [29]. The rationale for defining the number of independent tests
via PCA has been discussed previously [25,29,30], and more information is available in S1
Text. The first 17 principal components (PCs) explained 95% of the metabolic traits data vari-
ance across the 3 cohorts; this number is a proxy of the number of independent tests being per-
formed. Therefore, the threshold of P < 0.05 becomes P < 0.003 (i.e., α � 17 where α = 0.05)
when multiple testing is considered for assessing associations with the 153 metabolic traits.
We performed 2 additional analyses, using the 1-stage IPD meta-analysis only, that aimed
to explore whether any maternal (or paternal) pre-pregnancy BMI associations with offspring
metabolic traits were mediated by the relationship of the parental BMI with offspring BMI.
First, we examined the associations of offspring BMI (assessed at the same time as blood collec-
tion) with their metabolic traits. Second, we repeated the meta-analysis described above, in
point 1, with additional adjustment for offspring BMI. Both analyses were undertaken in
N = 5,266 to 5,316 trios from ALSPAC and NFBC86 cohorts.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Com-
puting, Vienna, Austria) and Stata version 14.1 (Stata Inc., TX, USA).
Results
Characteristics of the 3 study populations are shown in S1 Table, and the flowchart is shown in
S1 Fig. The percentage of overweight or obese mothers was 20%, 15%, and 23% in ALSPAC,
NFBC86, and NFBC66, respectively, and for fathers was 47% and 32% in ALSPAC and
NFBC86, respectively. The highest percentage of overweight or obesity in offspring, at follow-
up, in adolescent or adulthood was seen in NFBC66 with 40% (mean age 31 years), followed
by ALSPAC with 21% (mean age 17 years), and NFBC86 with 11% (mean age 16 years).
Figs 2–4 show associations of parental BMI with the 153 offspring metabolic measures,
each expressed as a difference in means in SD units for a 1-SD greater parental BMI, from a
1-stage IPD meta-analysis restricted to the 2 cohorts with complete trio data (N = 5,327 to
5,377 trios). S3 Table shows the same associations expressed as magnitudes in absolute concen-
tration units (e.g., mmol/l per 1-SD difference in parental BMI). Both maternal and paternal
pre-pregnancy BMI were associated with a large proportion of the offspring metabolic traits
(maternal BMI associated with 49% and paternal BMI with 44% of offspring metabolic traits at
P < 0.003). The associations were mostly in the same direction for both parents and were in
the direction of more adverse cardio-metabolic risk in offspring with higher parental BMI in
pre-pregnancy.
Amongst lipoprotein lipids, the most marked positive associations were observed in 5 very-
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subclasses (all VLDL except the very small subclass). There

 total FAs (LA-to-total FA ratio), and omega 6 to total FA ratio were all inversely associated
with parental BMI.
Parental BMI was not clearly associated with any of the glycolysis-related metabolites,
except citrate where there was an inverse association. Parental BMI was strongly positively
associated with offspring glycoprotein acetyls, an inflammatory marker.
Overall, associations across offspring metabolic traits were similar for maternal and pater-
nal BMI, as can be seen in Figs 2–4, and also by the similarity of results when directly model-
ling the 2 sets of point estimates by both linear fit and multi-level models (Fig 5—linear fit: R2
= 0.89 and slope = 0.78 ± 0.02; S2 Fig—multi-level model: R2
cond = 0.94 and R2
marg = 0.87). Fur-
thermore, for all except 1 of the metabolic traits, there was no strong statistical evidence that
associations differed between maternal and paternal BMI (Pboot > 0.003). Docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA)-to-total FA ratio was the only metabolic trait that showed some suggestion of dif-
ference in association between maternal and paternal BMI (mean difference in percentage per
1-SD BMI: βmother = −0.01, 95% CImother = −0.02 to −0.01, Pmother = 0.0002 versus βfather =
0.002, 95% CIfather = −0.01 to 0.01, Pfather = 0.66; Pboot for difference between the 2 associa-
tions = 0.0034; Figs 2–4). However, the difference between maternal and paternal association
appeared to be driven primarily by results in ALSPAC as the difference was not seen in
NFBC86 or the 2-stage IPD meta-analysis (S3 Fig).
When the 1-stage analyses were repeated to compare maternal BMI–offspring metabolic
trait associations in all 3 cohorts (N = 10,181 to 10,251) to paternal BMI–offspring metabolic
trait associations in the 2 cohorts with paternal BMI (N = 5,327 to 5,377), the maternal associa-
tions were essentially the same as those described above; no statistical evidence for stronger
maternal associations emerged (S4 Fig).
In the 2-stage meta-analysis, the associations were highly consistent across the 3 cohorts,
with just 5% and 3% of associations having I2 statistic �75% for maternal and paternal BMI,
respectively, suggesting that the majority of our findings replicate across the 3 independent
cohorts (S3 Fig and S4 Table). A comparison of the results from 1- and 2-stage IPD meta-anal-
yses showed very similar patterns of association for both maternal and paternal BMI (R2 = 0.96
and slope = 0.81 ± 0.01; R2 = 0.99 and slope = 1 ± 0.01, respectively, for maternal and paternal
BMI; S5 Fig). The magnitudes of associations in absolute concentration units for individual
cohorts, as well as for the 2-stage IPD meta-analysis, are shown in S4–S6 Tables.
Cross-sectional associations of offspring BMI with their metabolic traits had very similar
patterns (in terms of direction and which metabolic traits had strongest and weakest associa-
tions) to those seen for parental BMI but were considerably stronger in magnitude (S6 Fig).
When adjusting parental BMI–offspring metabolite associations for offspring BMI, most
attenuated markedly, such that many point estimates were in the opposite directions and the
vast majority were consistent with the null following this adjustment (S7 Fig).
Discussion
We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that investigates the potential influence
of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI on adult offspring serum metabolome to determine whether
intrauterine mechanisms related to developmental overnutrition result in metabolic disrup-
tion in adults when they are in their reproductive years. We found similar associations of both
maternal and paternal BMI with offspring systemic metabolism 16–17 years later and 31 years
later (the latter assessed with maternal BMI only), suggesting that shared familial genetic,
socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics rather than an intrauterine programming effect
explain the associations of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI with offspring metabolic measures
(Figs 2–4).

 Fig 5. Linear fit between paternal and maternal models (green dashed line). Each green dot represents a metabolic trait and the
positions of the dots are determined by difference in mean offspring metabolite (in SD units) for each increase of 1-SD maternal body mass
index (BMI) (x-axis) and difference in mean offspring metabolite (in SD units) for each increase in 1-SD paternal BMI (y-axis). The horizontal
grey lines on each dot denote the confidence intervals (CI) for maternal associations and the vertical grey lines indicate the CI for paternal
estimates. A linear fit of the overall correspondence summarises the similarity in magnitude between maternal and paternal associations
(green dashed line). A slope of 1 with an intercept of 0 (dashed grey line), with all green dots sitting on that line (R2 = 1), would indicate that
maternal and paternal estimates had the same magnitude and direction. R2 indicates goodness of linear fit and as such is a measure of the
consistency between maternal and paternal associations. Results are shown in SD-scaled concentration units of outcome, difference in

 Associations of greater parental BMI with offspring lipids were in the directions of an
adverse cardio-metabolic profile, with positive associations with VLDL-lipoproteins, VLDL-
cholesterol (C), VLDL-triglycerides, VLDL-diameter, branched/aromatic amino acids, glyco-
protein acetyls, and triglycerides, and inverse associations with HDL-lipoprotein, HDL-diame-
ter, HDL-C, HDL2-C and HDL3-C. Associations were also seen with FA ratios and some
amino acids. In further analyses, we demonstrated that in addition to similar associations
between paternal BMI with offspring metabolic traits (to those seen for maternal BMI), the off-
spring BMI was associated in a similar pattern (but with stronger magnitudes) to their meta-
bolic traits, further supporting the notion that shared familial characteristics explain these
associations. Lastly, we found that parental associations with metabolic traits attenuated
markedly with adjustment for offspring BMI, suggesting that shared familial characteristics
drive associations of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and paternal BMI with their offspring BMI,
which in turn results in metabolic disruption (Fig 1).
Previous studies have compared associations of maternal and/or paternal BMI, measured
pre-pregnancy, with offspring adiposity (BMI [3,31–33], overall adiposity [31], central adipos-
ity [31–33]), with fewer also examining association with offspring lipids (HDL-C [31–33],
LDL-C [31,32], total cholesterol [31,32], triglycerides [31]), blood pressure [31–33], glucose
[33], and insulin [31]. Our study is generally larger than these previous studies, examines a
detailed metabolic profile with 153 metabolic traits (lipids, lipoproteins, and metabolites), and
assesses outcomes in offspring at older ages. Where it is possible to make comparisons, our
findings are consistent with the reported lack of association between maternal BMI and off-
spring total cholesterol [31,32], LDL-C [31], and glucose [33], and inverse association with
HDL-C [31,33] (previous studies N = 70 to 4,871; offspring age range: 4–8 years). Our results
also contrast reports from some of the same studies that found no association of maternal BMI
with offspring triglycerides [31,33] or HDL-C [32]. These differences might reflect differences
in the age of offspring outcome and/or that we are able to assess associations with more refined
outcomes (e.g., HDL-C subfractions). The only previous study that we were able to identify
that compared maternal to paternal BMI associations with any outcomes similar to ours and
with a similar size (N = 4,871) to our main analysis approach reported similar associations of
maternal BMI with total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C to those seen for paternal BMI [31],
as in our study, though that study found no association of either parental BMI with offspring
triglycerides. Associations between offspring BMI and their serum metabolomic profile are
similar to the ones reported by Wurtz et al. [34].
Our study has several strengths. It has a large sample size, included replication testing
across 3 different birth cohorts from 2 different countries, and included very detailed offspring
blood metabolome measurements. The consistency of associations across 3 independent stud-
ies using different analytical approaches suggests that our results are unlikely to be due to
chance. Furthermore, we used a negative-control approach (with paternal BMI) to explore
causal inference. Using paternal BMI as a negative control makes it possible to disentangle the
extent to which maternal BMI–offspring metabolite associations are due to casual intrauterine
effects or confounding by familial factors (i.e., genetic and/or shared lifestyle traits within fam-
ilies) [4,35]. As we would expect from previous studies [36–39], maternal and paternal BMI
are weakly correlated in our cohorts (0.17 in ALSPAC and 0.2 in NFBC86). This correlation is
likely to be driven by shared genetic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics [38,39],
which are the very characteristics that we were concerned would confound conventional
(without negative control) multivariable regression analyses of maternal BMI with offspring
metabolic traits. Thus, paternal BMI is an ideal negative control, as it fulfils the criteria of hav-
ing the same, or very similar, confounding structure as the main risk factor of interest (mater-
nal BMI), but it is implausible that paternal BMI would affect offspring future metabolism

 through the intrauterine overfeeding mechanisms that are hypothesised and that we have
investigated [4]. The fact that maternal and paternal associations are very similar highlights
the importance of the negative control approach and the likelihood that had we only presented
maternal multivariable adjusted results, incorrect conclusions about a possible intrauterine
effect may have been made. We performed a 1-stage IPD meta-analysis, which is the gold stan-
dard of meta-analysis [40], for our main analytical approach, but also tested the assumptions
of this approach, and the effect of harmonisation across studies, by comparing the results to a
2-stage IPD, and found high levels of consistency between the 2 approaches.
Limitations of our study include the use of parental BMI as a measure of adiposity; different
body composition characteristics, such as fat distribution or fat-to-lean body mass ratio, may
show differential associations with offspring serum metabolome. Moreover, maternal BMI was
self-reported, and paternal BMI was reported by their partners (i.e., the pregnant mothers),
which might have led to misclassification of parental BMI. Another limitation is that infer-
ences cannot be drawn about the role of circulating maternal fetal fuels (i.e., glucose, lipids,
FAs, and amino acids) on later offspring metabolic profile, as these were not measured during
pregnancy in our cohorts. It is possible that non-paternity for some of the fathers has affected
our results (for the NFBCs we had no information on this possibility). However, any impact of
non-paternity would be likely to selectively reduce paternal BMI associations, since there
would be no shared genetic effects on the association of paternal BMI with offspring metabolic
traits, and family lifestyle and socioeconomic associations may be weaker between non-biolog-
ical parents and offspring. This would thus tend to enhance maternal-paternal differences,
whereas we see similar associations between parents. Despite adjusting for several potential
confounders, residual confounding may still explain the associations that we have observed
between parental BMI and offspring. For example, we were unable to adjust for parental physi-
cal activity or dietary intake. These confounders are likely to be similar for maternal and pater-
nal BMI and so would be unlikely to bias our inference about specific maternal effects on
offspring metabolism (potentially due to intrauterine programming). Whilst we have a large
sample size, we may lack power to detect small differences between maternal and paternal
BMI associations with offspring metabolic traits, especially as the human circulating metabo-
lome is a tightly controlled homeostatic system, and even small differences between some met-
abolic traits might have important clinical impact. However, we think this is unlikely for many
of the traits we have examined. First, Figs 2–4 show that, for the majority, associations are pre-
cisely estimated (they have narrow CIs), and it can be clearly visualised that there is little differ-
ence in magnitude between maternal and paternal associations. Second, we have shown high
levels of consistency of maternal and paternal associations as demonstrated by their linear fit
(Fig 5) and multilevel model (S2 Fig), and by tests of heterogeneity that show for all but 1 of
the metabolic traits there is no strong statistical support for differences. Lastly, at the request of
the academic editor and a reviewer, we have undertaken a post-hoc power calculation. For our
main analyses, we compared associations in 5,327 to 5,377 mother-father-offspring trios; our
power calculation is based on a sample size of 5,300. At our multiple-testing adjusted alpha
level of 0.003 and with 80% power, we would be able to detect a minimum difference between
the maternal BMI–offspring metabolic trait and paternal BMI–offspring metabolic trait of
0.07-SD per 1-SD BMI, and with 90% power of 0.08-SD across all metabolic traits examined.
We have assessed BMI as a continuous variable to explore the hypothesis that each incremen-
tally greater maternal BMI overfeeds the developing infant in utero in a dose-response way,
and our results suggest that if that is the case it has no long-term effect on offspring metabo-
lism. However, we cannot exclude a threshold effect—i.e., maternal obesity (or extreme obe-
sity)—having a long-term effect via intrauterine mechanisms. Furthermore, our results may
not necessarily generalise to other non-European populations.

 In conclusion, the similarity of association between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and
paternal BMI with offspring metabolic profiles suggests that maternal BMI associations are
likely to be largely due to shared genetic or familial lifestyle confounding rather than intrauter-
ine mechanisms. Further replication of these findings in other larger studies, including with
measured fat distribution in mothers and fathers at the time of the mother’s pregnancy, would
be valuable, though we are not aware of any studies with relevant data currently to be able to
do that.
