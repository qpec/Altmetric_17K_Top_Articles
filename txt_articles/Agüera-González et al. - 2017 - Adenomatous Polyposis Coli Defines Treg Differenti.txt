SUMMARY
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a polarity
regulator and tumor suppressor associated with
familial
adenomatous
polyposis
and
colorectal
cancer development. Although extensively studied
in epithelial transformation, the effect of APC on
T lymphocyte activation remains poorly defined.
We found that APC ensures T cell receptor-triggered
activation through Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells
(NFAT), since APC is necessary for NFAT’s nuclear
localization in a microtubule-dependent fashion and
for NFAT-driven transcription leading to cytokine
gene expression. Interestingly, NFAT forms clusters
juxtaposed with microtubules. Ultimately, mouse
Apc deficiency reduces the presence of NFAT in
the nucleus of intestinal regulatory T cells (Tregs)
and impairs Treg differentiation and the acquisition
of a suppressive phenotype, which is characterized
by the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10. These findings suggest a dual role for APC mu-
tations in colorectal cancer development, where mu-
tations drive the initiation of epithelial neoplasms and
also reduce Treg-mediated suppression of the detri-
mental inflammation that enhances cancer growth.
INTRODUCTION
T lymphocytes recognize peptide antigens associated with ma-
jor histocompatibility complex molecules (MHCs) on antigen-
presenting cells. Antigen recognition induces T cell polarization
toward the antigen-presenting cell. This forms an organized
interface, the immunological synapse that regulates T cell activa-
tion leading to T cell growth, differentiation and cytokine produc-
tion. T cell receptor (TCR) and signaling molecules dynamically
concentrate at the immunological synapse to optimally control
T cell activation. This depends on the orchestrated action of
the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, and intracellular vesicle
traffic (Ag€
uera-Gonzalez et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2013).
Cell polarity is regulated by an array of evolutionary conserved
polarity complexes crucial for stably polarized epithelial cells
(Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014) or for induced polariza-
tion in migrating cells (Elric and Etienne-Manneville, 2014).
Scribble, Dlg1, and PKCz polarity regulators were shown to con-
trol lymphocyte migration, immunological synapse formation,
and T cell activation (Bertrand et al., 2010; Lasserre et al.,
2010; Ludford-Menting et al., 2005; Real et al., 2007; Round
et al., 2007; Xavier et al., 2004).
The polarity regulator and tumor suppressor adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) is known for its association with familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP), large numbers of sporadic hu-
man colorectal tumors, and intestinal carcinomas in mice
(McCartney and Na
¨ thke, 2008; Moser et al., 1990; Su et al.,
1992; Zeineldin and Neufeld, 2013). APC contains several pro-
tein-protein interaction domains (Figure 1A), permitting its
involvement in various cellular processes including proliferation,
differentiation, migration, and death. APC-interacting proteins
include b-catenin, the polarity regulators Dlg1 or Scribble, cyto-
skeleton regulators, nuclear pore and nuclear transport proteins,
and apoptosis- or mitosis-related proteins (Etienne-Manneville,
2009; Nelson and Na
¨ thke, 2013).
The effect of APC mutations on intestinal epithelium differenti-
ation and tumor progression has been widely investigated in
colorectal cancer patients and in mouse models (Be
´ roud and
Soussi, 1996; McCartney and Na
¨ thke, 2008; Moser et al.,

 1990; Nelson and Na
¨ thke, 2013; Su et al., 1992; Zeineldin and
Neufeld, 2013). Altered intestinal immune homeostasis was
found in Apc mutant mice, together with the impaired control
of inflammation by regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) (Akeus
et al., 2014; Chae and Bothwell, 2015; Gounaris et al., 2009).
However, whether Apc defects in T cells contribute to this loss
of anti-inflammatory functions remains only vaguely explored
(Tanner et al., 2016). Our data unveil the requirement for
APC in T cell receptor-dependent nuclear factor of activated
T cells (NFAT) activation. APC permits NFAT nuclear localization
in a microtubule-dependent fashion. Moreover, ApcMin/+ mice
display modestly reduced levels of NFAT expression and nuclear
localization in intestinal regulatory T cells (Tregs). Heteroinsuffi-
ciency of Apc leads to induced Treg (iTreg) populations with
impaired capacity to differentiate and produce NFAT-regulated
cytokines, particularly interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is essential
to control intestinal inflammation and adenocarcinoma progres-
sion (Rubtsov et al., 2008).
RESULTS
APC Regulates Microtubule Network Organization at the
Immunological Synapse
We first investigated the expression of APC in human T cells.
Jurkat cells and peripheral blood T cells express apparent full-
length APC (311 kDa), as compared with HCT-116 and DLD-1
colon cancer cell lines that express full-length and truncated
APC forms, respectively (Be
´ roud and Soussi, 1996) (Figure 1B).
We then localized APC in T cells. As we have previously shown
(Lasserre et al., 2010), T cells on stimulatory anti-CD3-coated
coverslips (pseudo synapses) display radially organized microtu-
bules, with the centrosome apposed to the contact site (Figures
1C–1E). Similar to other cell types (Etienne-Manneville et al.,
2005; Na
¨ thke et al., 1996), APC appeared as discrete puncta
apposed to microtubules (Figure 1C; Movie S1), frequently
localized at the synapse periphery, likely corresponding to
microtubule tips, as shown at the leading edge of migrating cells
(Etienne-Manneville et al., 2005) (Figure 1C, right, arrowheads;
Movie S1).
APC regulates microtubule stability and organization in polar-
ized cells (Etienne-Manneville et al., 2005; Kroboth et al., 2007;
Mogensen et al., 2002). We therefore investigated the role of
APC in microtubule network organization at the immunological
synapse. We assessed microtubule patterns at pseudo synap-
ses of control and APC-silenced T cells. Control T cells mostly
displayed radial microtubule patterns, whereas APC-silenced
cells frequently displayed disorganized microtubule patterns in
both Jurkat and primary T cells (Figures 1D and 1E). Moreover,
centrosome polarization to the immunological synapse was
less efficient in APC-silenced cells, as assessed by the centro-
some distance to the contact site (Figure 1F).
Tubulin acetylation correlates with microtubule stability and is
controlled by APC (Kroboth et al., 2007). Consistently, APC-
silenced T cells had lower levels of acetylated tubulin in unstimu-
lated and CD3+CD28-stimulated cells (Figures 1G and 1H).
Lower tubulin acetylation was also observed in DLD-1 epithelial
carcinoma cells expressing truncated APC (Figure 1I) and in
CD4+ and Tregs from ApcMin/+ heterozygous mutant mice (Fig-
ures S2B and S2H).
In sum, APC depletion results in impaired microtubule acetyla-
tion, microtubule network organization, and centrosome polari-
zation at the immunological synapse.
APC Silencing Alters Microcluster Patterns without
Affecting Early TCR Signaling
Immunological synapses direct T cell activation through the
actin- and microtubule-dependent spatial and temporal organi-
zation of TCR signaling complexes (Bunnell et al., 2002; Campi
et al., 2005; Lasserre et al., 2010; Yokosuka et al., 2005). APC
silencing affected the generation and dynamics of signaling
complexes at the immunological synapse, as monitored by the
number, intensity, and trajectories of YFP-SLP76 microclusters
(Figures S1A and S1B, arrowheads, and S1C and S1D). How-
ever, APC-silenced cells did not have altered tyrosine phosphor-
ylation of the proximal TCR signaling molecules ZAP70 and
PLCg1, or calcium flux (Figures S1E–S1H; Movies S6 and S7).
Therefore, APC is necessary for the generation and dynamics
of signaling microcluster at the immunological synapse, without
significantly affecting early signaling.
APC Regulates NFAT-Driven Gene Transcription
The transcription factors NFAT, nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), and
AP1 (Fos and Jun) are crucial for antigen-triggered T cell growth,
differentiation, and cytokine gene regulation. We investigated the
effect of APC silencing on NFAT-, NF-kB-, and AP1-driven tran-
scription using luciferase expression vectors. Despite normal
TCR-induced phosphorylation and Ca2+ flux in APC-silenced
cells (Figures S1E–S1H), NFAT-driven luciferase expression
was significantly lower (Figure 2A). In contrast, NF-kB- or AP1-
driven luciferase was not affected (Figure 2B and 2C). Similar ef-
fects were observed when T cells were stimulated with calcium
ionophore (Iono) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) that acti-
vate calcineurin and protein kinase C (PKC), respectively, by-
passing TCR proximal signal events (Figures 2D–2F). Moreover,
APC silencing decreased IL2 gene expression in Jurkat and pri-
mary T cells, as assessed by qRT-PCR (Figures 2G and 2H).

 Similarly, T cells from mice with heteroinsufficiency for Apc
(ApcMin/+) exhibited reduced proliferative, cytokine production
and Treg lineage commitment responses to TCR stimulation
compared to their wild-type counterparts (Figures S2A and
S2C–S2G). Moreover, the early response gene c-Myc was also
inhibited (Figures S2B and S2H).
NFAT shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in
a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic NFAT is
phosphorylated on several serine residues whose dephosphory-
lation by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin drives
NFAT nuclear translocation and gene transcription (Beals et al.,
1997a; Okamura et al., 2000). Conversely, phosphorylation by
the serine kinases GSK-3b facilitates NFAT nuclear export and
cytoplasmic retention (Beals et al., 1997b; Shibasaki et al., 1996).
We investigated the effect of APC silencing on NFATC2
(NFAT1), an isoform constitutively expressed in T cells, which
concentrates in the nucleus in response to TCR-CD28 stimula-
tion or PMA-Iono. Nuclear NFATC2 in APC-silenced activated
Jurkat or primary T cells was lower compared to controls. (Fig-
ures 2J–2L, S3A, and S3B). Similarly, DLD-1 carcinoma cells
expressing truncated APC were less efficient at translocating
NFATC2 and producing NFAT-driven luciferase in response
to PMA-Iono than HCT-116 controls (Figures S3C and S3D).
Moreover, we observed that NFATC2 was less expressed at
the mRNA and protein level in APC-silenced Jurkat cells (Figures
2I and 2M), whereas NFATC1 (NFAT2) isoform expression was
not significantly affected (Figure 2N).
Since APC and GSK-3 form a complex (Stamos and
Weis, 2013), and GSK-3 phosphorylates NFAT and regulates
its nuclear-to-cytoplasmic cycling (Beals et al., 1997b), we inves-
tigated whether APC silencing affects NFATC2 phosphoryla-
tion. We therefore analyzed NFATC2 phosphorylation status
by comparing its electrophoretic mobility. Bands with slower
mobility represent more phosphorylated protein species. Apc
silencing did not significantly affect the ratio of higher to lower
mobility NFAT electrophoretic bands, suggesting that phosphor-
ylation was not altered by APC depletion (Figures S4A–S4H).
In sum, APC is necessary for NFATC2 expression and nuclear
localization, as well as NFAT-driven gene transcription with func-
tional consequences for proliferation, differentiation, and cyto-
kine expression.
NFAT Nuclear Localization and Activation Requires
Microtubule Integrity
Microtubule disorganization in APC-silenced cells (Figures 1D–
1F) prompted us to hypothesize that APC regulation of microtu-
bules may influence NFAT activation, including nuclear localiza-
tion and transcriptional activity. Therefore, we first analyzed
NFATC2 localization with respect to microtubules. We observed
discrete puncta of endogenous NFATC2 juxtaposed to microtu-
bules (Figure 3A, arrowheads). We then measured the distance
of NFATC2 microclusters to the closest microtubule at different
activation times, using 3D segmentations and quantitative image
analysis (Figures 3B and 3C; Movies S2, S3, S4, and S5).
NFATC2-microtubule distance was z0.2 mm in non-stimulated
cells and significantly increased upon TCR stimulation (Figures
3C and 3D). NFATC2 microclusters approached to the synapse
surface at early activation times and then progressively moved
away to a central, peri-nuclear region of the cell as the cell re-
tracted from the coverslip (Z-position; Figure 3E). The number
of NFAT microclusters was conserved during the course of
T cell activation (Figure 3F). These data are consistent with
NFATC2 forming microclusters associated with microtubules in
resting and early activated T cells and then separating at later
times as NFAT translocates to the nucleus.
It was reported that NFAT and APC form cytoplasmic com-
plexes that share common partners, like the Ser/Thr kinase
GSK-3b, and the cytoskeleton regulator IQGAP (Sharma et al.,
2011; Stamos and Weis, 2013). Moreover, both APC and NFAT
associate with microtubules displaying spotted patterns (Figures
1C and 3A). Therefore, we investigated the relative localization of
APC and NFAT. APC and NFAT microclusters did not fully over-
lap, although they were often found in close proximity (Figure 3G,
arrowheads).
Next, we investigated whether microtubule integrity was
required for NFATC2 localization and transcriptional activity.
Treatment of T cells with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor
colchicine significantly reduced the number of NFAT clusters at
the immunological synapse, providing further evidence of the
close relationship between NFAT and the microtubule network
(Figure
4A).
Furthermore,
colchicine
significantly
inhibited
NFAT-driven luciferase gene expression under both CD3-CD28
and PMA-Iono T cell stimulations (Figures 4B and 4C). Consis-
tently, IL2 mRNA levels were reduced in colchicine-treated cells
(Figure 4D). In addition, NFAT nuclear detection was significantly
reduced in colchicine-treated T cells (Figures 4E–4G), suggest-
ing that the defect of NFAT-dependent transcription could
be related to impaired NFAT nuclear localization. In contrast
with APC-silenced cells, colchicine-treated T cells displayed
comparable amounts of total NFAT protein and mRNA (Figures
4H and 4I), suggesting that NFAT nuclear localization could be
microtubule-dependent.
Finally, overexpression of two APC truncated molecules
containing the C-terminal APC microtubule and EB1 interacting
regions (Etienne-Manneville et al., 2005) significantly inhibited
NFAT-driven luciferase expression in Jurkat cells, although
less efficiently than APC silencing (Figure 4J).
Altogether, our data indicate that APC controls NFAT-driven
gene transcription by regulating NFAT nuclear localization in a
microtubule-dependent manner. APC also affects NFAT mRNA
and protein levels. APC silencing inhibits NFAT, without altering
NF-kB or AP1, leading to reduced IL2 gene expression.

 Apc Controls Cytokine Gene Expression by Lamina
Propria Tregs
Unlike conventional T cells, Tregs constitutively retain some
NFAT in the nucleus, even in the absence of TCR stimulation
(Li et al., 2012; Vaeth et al., 2012). This nuclear NFAT fraction
is required to maintain a suppressive phenotype, as it cooper-
ates with Foxp3 to drive the Treg transcriptional profile and en-
hances Foxp3 expression (Tone et al., 2008; van der Veeken
et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2006). Because we showed that APC
was necessary for optimal accumulation of NFAT in the nucleus
of human T cells activated in vitro, we examined the impact of
Apc mutation on NFAT localization in Tregs isolated from the in-
testinal lamina propria of pre-cancerous (11-week-old) ApcMin/+
mice. Using high-throughput image analysis with imaging flow
cytometry, we assessed the nuclear localization of NFAT in
Tregs from wild-type (WT) and ApcMin/+ mice, finding a small

but significant change in the cellular dis-
tribution of NFAT in mutant Tregs, with a
shift away from the nucleus (Figure 5A).
Moreover, conventional flow cytometric
analysis confirmed a significant reduction
in Foxp3 protein levels within ApcMin/+
Treg (Figure 5B). Further investigation
into Treg phenotypes revealed a dramatic
shift in Treg subtypes populating the in-
testine of ApcMin/+ mice, with a marked
reduction in frequencies of RORgt+ Tregs
that are induced in response to environ-
mental cues and are required for the con-
trol of inflammation at mucosal surfaces
(Ohnmacht et al., 2015; Yang et al.,
2016) (Figure 5C). There was a counter-
vailing
increase
in
the
frequency
of
thymus-derived, Heliosbright Treg (Fig-
ure 5D). These findings suggest that the
ability to either generate or stably main-
tain this induced RORgt+ Treg population is impaired without
full Apc function.
RORgt+ Tregs display potent suppressive activity against in-
testinal inflammation, and have been noted to produce IL-10,
which is critical to this process (Lochner et al., 2008; Ohnmacht
et al., 2015; Rubtsov et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2016). Loss of Treg
suppressive function has been shown to contribute to inflamma-
tory pathology and the growth of intestinal neoplasms in ApcMin/+
mice, and deficient IL-10 production has been implicated (Chae
and Bothwell, 2015; Chung et al., 2014; Dennis et al., 2015; Kim
et al., 2006; Serebrennikova et al., 2012). We therefore examined
the impact of Apc on Treg production of IL-10, assessing cyto-
kine production by flow cytometry. We observed a dramatic
reduction in IL-10 production by Tregs in the intestine of
ApcMin/+ (Figure 5E). Because Tregs are the main source of IL-
10-producing T cells in the intestinal lamina propria, this loss of

 IL-10 was also observed at the level of the entire CD4+ T cell pop-
ulation (Figure S5B). We also observed a reduction in total CD4+
T cell production of IL-2 and IFNg (Figures S5C and S5E), but did
not observe alterations in IL-17 expression at this early time point
(11-week-old mice) (Figure S5D). In this line, Treg production of
IL-17 was unaffected (Figure S5H).
Tregs with Apc mutations have been repeatedly shown to
develop distinct phenotypes with a reduced ability to control
the inflammatory response in the pre-cancerous intestine
(Chae and Bothwell, 2015; Erdman et al., 2005; Gounaris et al.,
2009; Serebrennikova et al., 2012). Evidence for a direct effect
of Apc in Treg development has been limited (Chae and
Bothwell, 2015) since in ApcMin/+ mice the mutation could also
affect thymic selection and will alter the intestinal microenviron-
ment. In order to test whether Apc affects Treg phenotype acqui-
sition in a cell-intrinsic manner, we created bone marrow chi-
meras in which both WT and Apc Min/+ T cells developed in the
same milieu, competing for individual niches. Interestingly, in
these chimeric mice, CD4+ T cells of WT origin were much
more likely to develop into Foxp3+ Tregs in the spleen and lymph
nodes as well as the intestinal lamina propria (Figures 6A and
6B). This finding is consistent with the role of NFAT in stabilizing
Foxp3 expression. As seen in standard mice, heteroinsufficiency
for Apc perturbed the balance between thymic Heliosbright natu-
ral Tregs (nTregs) and induced RORgT+ IL-10-producing iTregs,
with a notable loss of these iTregs among ApcMin/+ cells in the in-
testine (Figures 6C–6E). Despite developing in exactly the same
microenvironment, Tregs arising from ApcMin/+ cells exhibited
reduced acetylated a-tubulin, particularly after TCR stimulation
(Figure 6F), and reduced IL-17 and IL-2 production (Figures
S6G and S6H).
These data indicate that disruption of Apc in murine intestinal
Foxp3+ T cells impairs expression of IL-10 and RORgt, and
in chimeric mice reduces Treg commitment. This is consistent
with impaired NFAT nuclear localization and function, as found
in Apc-silenced human T cells.
DISCUSSION
Here, we report a critical role of the polarity regulator APC in TCR
signal transduction leading to cytokine gene expression. Impor-
tantly, an Apc defect in vivo particularly affects lamina propria
Tregs, which display a diminished capacity to produce the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
We identified APC-regulated microtubule organization as
an essential step of NFAT regulation. Importantly, we could visu-
alize NFATC2 microclusters juxtaposed with microtubules. Upon
T cell activation, the distance between NFATC2 microclusters
and microtubules increased concomitantly with NFATC2 trans-
location to the nucleus. Finally, we observed an inhibition of
NFAT-driven luciferase gene transcription with colchicine treat-
ment upon T cell activation, consistent with findings from neuro-
blast cells (Mackenzie and Oteiza, 2007) supporting the impor-
tance of microtubules for NFATC2 cellular location. Consistent
with a role of microtubules in NFAT translocation to the nucleus,
Ishiguro et al., (2011) had shown that NFAT nuclear transport via
importin�b required tubulin acetylation. In this line, we suggest
that microtubules could facilitate NFAT concentration around
the nuclear envelope and facilitate its interaction with nuclear
pores. This process would depend on APC-dependent microtu-
bule organization. Few studies have imaged endogenous NFAT
in T lymphocytes, and our work reveals a microcluster distribu-
tion of NFATC2 that is not observed when overexpressing the
GFP-tagged truncated form of NFAT containing the nuclear
localization signal and regulatory serine residues. This suggests
that the overexpression of GFP-tagged truncated forms of
NFAT, while informative, may only partially recapitulate the regu-
lation of endogenous NFAT nuclear translocation. Live imaging
of full-length GFP-NFAT appeared particularly challenging since
overexpression of this construct was toxic for T cells (S.A.-G.,
unpublished data).
While APC silencing inhibited NFAT-driven luciferase expres-
sion, NF-kB-driven luciferase remained unaltered and colchicine
treatment inhibited both NFAT- and NF-kB-driven luciferase
expression. This is consistent with reported dynein dependence
of NF-kB nuclear translocation (Shrum et al., 2009). In contrast,
neither APC silencing nor colchicine altered AP1-driven lucif-
erase (Figures 2C and 2F) (E.V.-C., unpublished data). Therefore,
the inhibition of IL2 gene transcription by colchicine is likely
due to NFAT and NF-kB inhibition. Additionally, some effects
of colchicine on early TCR signaling, including TCR synaptic
clustering, tyrosine phosphorylation and Erk activation were
observed before (Das et al., 2004; Lasserre et al., 2010) that
could account for the effect of colchicine on TCR-CD28-induced
NFAT activation, but would not affect PMA-Iono activation.
These data suggest that different microtubule-driven events
control NFAT, NF-kB, and AP1 transcription factor activation.
Furthermore, APC silencing may influence IL2 expression
through mechanisms other than cytoskeleton reorganization,
including reduction of c-Myc and NFAT.
Other proteins use microtubules to translocate from the cyto-
plasm to the nucleus. Some of them interact with the dynein mo-
tor via their nuclear localization signals. Therefore, microtubule-
based active transport could bring proteins to nuclear pores,

 facilitating interactions with importins and promoting nuclear
translocation (Wagstaff and Jans, 2009). Our results here provide
further insight into this general process, indicating that a fine
microtubule organization controlled by APC is crucial for NFAT
transport to the nucleus or NFAT nuclear localization upon
T cell activation.
The Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is key for differentiation
and growth in various cell systems including thymocytes. APC is
part of the b-catenin degradation complex (Stamos and Weis,
2013). APC mutations increase b-catenin cellular levels, deregu-
lating cell differentiation and promoting tumor development in
epithelial cells, as well as altered thymocyte development (Gou-
nari et al., 2005; McCartney and Na
¨ thke, 2008). b-catenin is a
transcription factor that cooperates with T cell factor-1 to coor-
dinate T cell differentiation (Ioannidis et al., 2001). Activation of
the TCR leads to b-catenin nuclear stabilization (Lovatt and Bijl-
makers, 2010), and a transgenic mouse model of stabilized
b-catenin presents reduced LAT and PLCg phosphorylation
and cytokine production (Driessens et al., 2011). In this line,
APC-silenced cells could behave as cells expressing stabilized
b-catenin. However, we observed that APC-silenced displayed
no modification of PLCg1 phosphorylation upon TCR activation.
In addition, silencing b-catenin was by itself inhibitory for IL2
gene expression and in APC-silenced cells only weakly restored
IL2 gene transcription (E.V.-C., unpublished data). This indicates
that the effect of APC silencing in T cell activation is unlikely to be
entirely due to higher levels of b-catenin.
NFAT cooperates with AP1 and NF-kB to regulate T cell func-
tions. NFAT-AP1 interaction regulates the balance between
T cell proliferation, T cell anergy and exhaustion (Macia
´ n et al.,
2002; Martinez et al., 2015). Moreover, NFAT regulates Foxp3
expression (Tone et al., 2008) and interacts with Foxp3 to control
the transcriptional program of regulatory T cells (Wu et al., 2006).
Finally, a fraction of NFAT is constitutively localized in the nu-
cleus of Foxp3+ T cells (Li et al., 2012). We found that ApcMin/+
intestinal T cells displayed lower levels of total Foxp3 and
reduced nuclear NFAT, which together might unbalance cyto-
kine gene transcription. This may explain, at least in part, why
ApcMin/+ Foxp3+ cells produce IL-10 inefficiently. In further
agreement with our findings in ApcMin/+ mice, Gounaris et al. re-
ported a reduced percentage of intestinal CD4+Foxp3+ cells that
produce IL-10 in ApcD468 mice. Instead, they found a higher
proportion of cells producing IL-17, proposing that a transition
toward pro-inflammatory Th17 cells had taken place (Gounaris
et al., 2009). However, neither we nor Chae and Bothwell
(2015) found an increased percentage of lamina propria IL-17-
producing cells in ApcMin/+ mice. These discrepancies in the
two different experimental mouse models could be due to differ-
ences in age, microbiota, or the state of intestinal inflammation in
the animals.
Our data showed a higher proportion of Tregs expressing high
levels of Helios and low levels of RORgt in the lamina propria
from ApcMin/+ mice, indicative of a nTreg phenotype. Therefore,
Apc mutation impairs CD4+ T cell differentiation into, or retention
of, the iTreg gene program, particularly in lamina propria Treg, in
accordance with previous work (Chae and Bothwell, 2015). At
the transcriptional level, iTreg generation could be particularly
sensitive to NFAT nuclear levels, as iTreg induction in gut-asso-
ciated lymphoid tissues is controlled by the non-coding DNA
sequence CNS1 at the Foxp3 locus, and CNS1 contains an
NFAT-binding site (Zheng et al., 2010). Additionally, our in vitro
experiments demonstrate that naive ApcMin/+ T cells fail to
convert into Foxp3+ Tregs under suboptimal TCR stimulation,
despite responding similarly to TGFb. This suggests that Apc
mutations are most likely to affect Treg generation under subop-
timal conditions, such as are likely to occur outside the thymus.
Tregs play a critical role in the control of cancer development
in Apc mutant mouse models, as established by experiments in
which transfer of WT, but not Apc mutant CD4+Foxp3+, cells to
these mice reduced polyp growth. Moreover, cell-intrinsic loss
of a single allele of Apc reduced the ability of Tregs to control
cytokine production, and loss of both alleles resulted in a lym-
phoproliferative wasting phenotype reminiscent of Foxp3 defi-
ciency (Chae and Bothwell, 2015). Therefore, Apc mutant mice
appear unable to control cancer-associated intestinal inflamma-
tion, as assessed by elevated cytokine transcripts, conversion of
T cells to pro-inflammatory phenotypes (IL-17) and increased in-
testinal mastocytosis (Akeus et al., 2014; Chae and Bothwell,
2015; Gounaris et al., 2007, 2009). Our data are consistent
with an intrinsic developmental change in Tregs possibly due
to impaired NFAT-driven transcription, including IL-10 (Wu
et al., 2006). This intrinsic genetic defect likely acts in concert
with other factors in the intestinal microenvironment to result in
Treg impairment, as previously suggested by others (Chae and
Bothwell, 2015; Peuker et al., 2016).
In sum, we show that the polarity regulator APC modifies NFAT
transcriptional activity, and we propose that this phenomenon
could be relevant for Treg anti-inflammatory phenotypes in the
ApcMin/+ mice model of colorectal cancer. We propose that
APC could have a dual role in colorectal cancer progression, pro-
moting both epithelial transformation and T lymphocyte dysfunc-
tion through suboptimal NFAT regulation.
