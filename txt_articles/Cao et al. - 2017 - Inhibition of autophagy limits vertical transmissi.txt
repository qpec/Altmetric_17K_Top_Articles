IntroductIon
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted fla-
vivirus and global public health threat. Hitherto, ZIKV was 
known to cause a self-limiting febrile illness characterized 
by rash, myalgia, conjunctivitis, and headache. However, re-
cent epidemics have linked ZIKV infection to Guillain-Barré 
syndrome in adults (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016) and placen-
tal insufficiency, fetal demise, microcephaly, and other con-
genital malformations in fetuses and newborn infants in the 
setting of maternal infection during pregnancy (Chibueze 
et al., 2017). In the human placenta, ZIKV has a broad cell 
tropism, including villous placental trophoblasts, endothelial 
cells, fibroblasts, and fetal Hofbauer macrophages in the inter-
villous space (El Costa et al., 2016; Jurado et al., 2016; Miner 
et al., 2016; Quicke et al., 2016; Tabata et al., 2016; Aagaard 
et al., 2017). This evidence suggests that ZIKV can dissemi-
nate into the intrauterine space and infect the fetus through 
a transplacental route.
Recent studies have demonstrated that inoculation 
of ZIKV through a subcutaneous or intravaginal route in 
pregnant mice with compromised type I interferon signal-
ing results in severe placental and fetal damage, including in-
trauterine growth restriction and fetal demise (Miner et al., 
2016; Y
ockey et al., 2016), which recapitulates many features 
of congenital ZIKV syndrome in humans (Mysorekar and 
Diamond, 2016; Cao et al., 2017). Furthermore, in situ hy-
bridization (ISH) and viral antigen staining has established the 
presence of ZIKV infection in multiple mouse and human 
trophoblast cells (Miner et al., 2016; Tabata et al., 2016; Cao 
et al., 2017; Vermillion et al., 2017). The preferential replica-
tion of ZIKV in trophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells in the 
placenta suggests that ZIKV enters into the fetal circulation in 
mice in part by compromising the placental barrier. Bayer et 
al. (2016) showed that type III interferon (IFN-λ) secreted by 
primary cultured human trophoblast cells was able to protect 
trophoblasts from ZIKV infection in an autocrine or para-
crine manner. 
TIM1, a member of the 
T cell immunoglobulin 
and mucin domain protein family, has been shown to play a 
critical role in ZIKV infection in primary trophoblasts (Ta-
bata et al., 2016). However, the pathogenesis and underlying 
mechanisms of ZIKV-induced maternal-fetal transmission in 
vivo across the placental trophoblast barrier remain unknown.
The placenta normally uses physical and immunological 
strategies to protect the fetus from maternal-fetal transmission 
of pathogens. One important mechanism the placenta uses in 
its defense is autophagy (Delorme-Axford et al., 2013; Cao 
et al., 2016), which targets intracellular components for lyso-
somal degradation and is important for host defense against 
many pathogens (Levine et al., 2011). Notwithstanding this, 
some pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade, inhibit, or 
even hijack the host autophagy machinery to facilitate infec-
tion and survival (Cemma and Brumell, 2012). Recent studies 
have indicated that autophagy has as an important function in 
placental defense against microbial agents (Delorme-Axford et 
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to devastating fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction and 
microcephaly. Greater understanding of mechanisms underlying ZIKV maternal-fetal transmission is needed to develop new 
therapeutic interventions. Here, we define an important role for the autophagy pathway in ZIKV vertical transmission. ZIKV 
infection induced autophagic activity in human trophoblasts and pharmacological inhibition limited ZIKV infectivity. Further-
more, deficiency in an essential autophagy gene, Atg16l1, in mice limited ZIKV vertical transmission and placental and fetal 
damage and overall improved placental and fetal outcomes. this protection was due to a placental trophoblast cell-autono-
mous effect of autophagic activity, not to alterations in systemic maternal ZIKV infection. Finally, an autophagy inhibitor, 
hydroxychloroquine, approved for use in pregnant women, attenuated placental and fetal ZIKV infection and ameliorated 
adverse placental and fetal outcomes. our study reveals new insights into the mechanism of ZIKV vertical transmission and 
suggests that an autophagy-based therapeutic warrants possible evaluation in humans to diminish the risks of ZIKV maternal- 
fetal transmission.

al., 2013; Cao et al., 2016), as autophagy pathway activity is de-
creased in human placentas with clinically diagnosed infections 
(Cao et al., 2016). Placenta-specific microRNAs, packaged in 
exosomes secreted from human syncytium, can attenuate viral 
replication of vesicular stomatitis virus through induction of 
autophagy (Delorme-Axford et al., 2013). Although autoph-
agy occurs in trophoblasts from term placental villi (Signorelli 
et al., 2011), several pathogens that are transmitted to the fetus 
by a placental route, including Brucella abortus (Khan et al., 
2001) and Listeria monocytogenes (Lamont et al., 2011), can 
evade autophagic cellular machinery to survive or replicate in 
other cell types (Cemma and Brumell, 2012).
At present, the effects of autophagy on ZIKV infection 
in trophoblasts and its impact on vertical transmission remains 
unknown. Here, we performed ZIKV infection studies in 
mice and cultured trophoblasts to address the impact of auto-
phagy on vertical transmission of ZIKV
. We show that ZIKV 
infection activates autophagic activity in human trophoblast 
cells and in the mouse placenta. Inhibition of the autophagy 
pathway in both human trophoblast and autophagy gene– 
deficient mice reduced ZIKV infection in placentas and fe-
tuses and resulted in improved fetal outcomes. Consistent 
with these findings, we demonstrate that inhibiting auto-
phagy by treating pregnant mice with hydroxychloroquine 
(HCQ) reduced ZIKV vertical transmission and limited pla-
cental damage and fetal death. Our findings demonstrate that 
autophagy promotes ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy 
and provide a foundation for developing therapeutics to re-
duce maternal-fetal transmission of ZIKV
.

ZIKV infection induces autophagic 
activity in human trophoblasts
Autophagy is a vital part of the host response to many mi-
crobial infections. Thus, we reasoned that ZIKV may regulate 
autophagic activity in trophoblasts cells to facilitate its repli-
cation in the placenta. We infected a human cytotrophoblast 
(CTB) cell line, JEG-3, with a Brazilian strain of ZIKV (Para-
iba 2015) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and collected 
samples 6, 12, 24, or 48 h later for virus titration as described 
previously (Miner et al., 2016). We examined the level of au-
tophagy markers in CTBs after ZIKV infection by Western 
blot for the microtubule-binding protein light chain 3 (LC3) 
protein, which converts from the soluble form LC3-I to the 
lipidated form LC3-II and serves as an indicator of auto-
phagic activity or flux. 
We found that LC3-II was significantly 
increased at 6 and 12 h postinfection (hpi; Fig. 1 A and Fig. 
S1 A). Because this could indicate either increased autophagy 
or inhibition of autophagosome maturation, we next treated 
cells with bafilomycin (Baf) A1, which inhibits autophagoso-
mal and lysosomal fusion (Klionsky et al., 2016). In this case, 
LC3-II further accumulated in ZIKV-infected cells, indicat-
ing that ZIKV activated autophagy (Fig. 1 A and Fig. S1 A).
ZIKV infection has been associated with LC3-II-positive 
autophagosome formation in skin fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 
2015) and neural stem cells (Liang et al., 2016). T
o identify 
whether LC3+ autophagosome formation was affected in 
trophoblasts infected with ZIKV
, we transfected CTBs with 
a plasmid carrying EGFP-LC3 and subsequently exposed 
them to ZIKV
. Immunofluorescence staining for GFP re-
vealed diffuse LC3 staining in uninfected CTBs and punc-
tate staining in ZIKV-infected CTBs (Fig. 1 B). The number 
of EGFP-LC3+ punctae remained higher in ZIKV-infected 
than in uninfected cells upon Baf A1 treatment (Fig. 1, B and 
C), indicating that the increase in LC3 punctae was due to 
enhanced autophagosomal formation. These results demon-
strate that ZIKV infection induces canonical autophagy re-
sponse in human trophoblasts.
suppression of autophagic activity impairs ZIKV 
infection in human trophoblasts
Manipulation of autophagy pathway activity can alter mi-
crobial infection and pathogenesis in other cells and tissues 
(Levine et al., 2011). We next determined whether increas-
ing or decreasing baseline autophagy in trophoblasts altered 
ZIKV persistence in these placental cells. We infected JEG-3 
CTBs with ZIKV and then treated infected and control cells 
with chemical modulators of autophagy pathways: rapamy-
cin and T
orin 1 induce autophagy, whereas 3-methyladenine 
(3-MA), chloroquine (CQ), and Baf A1 inhibit autophagy at 
initiation (3-MA and CQ) and autophagolysosome forma-
tion (Baf A1) stages. Importantly, these autophagy modulators 
did not induce changes in CTB viability, with the exception 
of T
orin 1 treatment, which was associated with a small re-
duction in cell viability (Fig. S1 B). Treatment of CTBs with 
the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA, CQ, and Baf A1 resulted in a 
significant decrease in ZIKV replication at 48 hpi (Fig. 1 D). 
Reciprocally, administration of the autophagy inducers rapa-
mycin and T
orin 1 resulted in an increase of viral infection in 
CTBs (Fig. 1 D). Immunofluorescence staining in infected 
trophoblasts confirmed fewer ZIKV antigen-positive cells 
(Fig. 1, E and F) after treatment with autophagy inhibitors 
but greater numbers of antigen-positive cells after incubation 
with autophagy inducers (Fig. 1, E and F). Collectively, these 
data show that inhibition of autophagy limits ZIKV infection 
in trophoblasts and suggests that modulation of this pathway 
can be harnessed to combat this infection.
ZIKV infection induces autophagy in vivo, and loss of 
AtG16l1 expression impairs in utero transmission of ZIKV
T
o investigate the physiological role for autophagy in the 
context of an in vivo model of maternal-fetal ZIKV trans-
mission, we assessed whether ZIKV induced autophagy in the 
placenta. Similar to the human trophoblast response to ZIKV 
infection, immunoblotting for LC3-II in ZIKV-infected 
whole placentas (5 d postinfection) showed increased levels 
compared with uninfected placentas (Fig. S2 A). We also de-
tected a concomitant reduction in levels of p62 (also called 
sequestrome-1 [Sqstm1]), a substrate degraded by autophagy 
pathway (Klionsky et al., 2016; Fig. S2 
A). Immunohistochem-

ical staining revealed that the ZIKV infection–associated re-
duction in p62 levels, thereby supporting autophagy pathway 
activation, was localized primarily to the trophoblast-rich re-
gion of the placenta (Fig. S2 B). 
Thus, ZIKV infection in vivo 
can activate autophagic activity in the placenta.
On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that 
genetic manipulation of autophagic activity would alter 
ZIKV pathogenesis in pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we 
used mice hypomorphic (HM) for a key autophagy gene, 
Atg16L1 (Atg16l1HM), because (1) ATG16L1 has a key role 
in autophagosome maturation as part of the protein com-
plex that directs LC3 to autophagosomes en route to fusion 
with lysosomes, (2) Atg16l1HM mice exhibit stalled auto-
phagosome formation and reduced autophagy in multiple 
tissues, and (3) Atg16l1HM mice exhibit normal fertility, 
and their placentas are histologically indistinguishable from 
wild-type (WT) mice in the absence of infection (Cao et al., 
2016). We inoculated pregnant WT and Atg16l1 HM mice 
 
(Atg16l1HM) with 103 focus-forming units (FFU) of ZIKV 
(Paraiba 2015) through a subcutaneous route at day E9.5, 1 d 
after pretreatment with a single dose of anti-Ifnar1 to facili-
tate dissemination (Fig. 2 A), as reported previously (Miner 
et al., 2016). Pregnant dams were followed longitudinally for 
morbidity, levels of maternal viremia, and viral burden in the 
placenta and fetal heads at E14.5. Notably, ZIKV infection 
in Atg16l1-deficient placentas was ∼10-fold lower compared 
with WT controls (Fig. 2 B). ISH revealed that the overall 
abundance of ZIKV RNA–positive placental trophoblasts 
was decreased in Atg16l1HM placentas (Fig. 2 C). The re-
duced viral burden in Atg16l1HM placentas was associated 
with decreased placental damage: pathological phenotypes 
observed in ZIKV-infected WT placentas, such as apoptotic 
trophoblasts and increased number of nucleated fetal eryth-
rocytes, were reduced in Atg16l1HM placentas (Fig. 2 D). 
Further histological analysis showed that ZIKV-infected 
 
Atg16l1HM placentas had larger and thicker placental layers 
than WT placentas (Fig. 2 E), and the labyrinth zone thick-
ness was greater as well (Fig. 2 F).
Finally, ZIKV titer in Atg16l1-deficient fetus was sig-
nificantly lower (∼15-fold) compared with WT controls 
(Fig. 3 A). Moreover, fetuses in the Atg16l1HM group at E14.5 
were larger than WT counterparts, indicating that the fetal 
growth restriction induced by ZIKV infection was limited by 
the HM Atg16l1 allele (Fig. 3 B). These data together indi-
cate that a deficiency in Atg16l1 function results in reduced 
placental and fetal infection of ZIKV
, thus suggesting that

ATG16L1 plays an important role in governing placental sus-
ceptibility to ZIKV infection and maternal-fetal transmission.
Atg16l1 deficiency in trophoblasts limits ZIKV 
infection in the placenta
To assess whether the observed virological phenotype in 
 
Atg16l1HM mice was due in part to changes in maternal infec-
tion, we measured viral burden in maternal serum and spleen 
but observed no significant differences in between the preg-
nant Atg16l1HM and WT mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, 
the HM Atg16l1 allele had no effect on ZIKV RNA local-
ization or abundance within the maternal decidua (Fig. 4 C). 
Consistent with these data, no difference in viral titers were 
noted in nonpregnant Atg16l1HM mice infected with ZIKV 
(Fig. 4, D and E) or in infected male Atg16l1HM mice (not de-
picted). 
These findings indicate that a loss of Atg16l1 function 
has no little or no effect on systemic or maternal decidual in-
fection but preferentially affects infection of the fetal-derived 
placental compartments.
T
o confirm these findings, we assessed whether loss of 
Atg16l1 exclusively in cells of the trophoblast lineage was suf-
ficient to limit ZIKV maternal-fetal transmission. We gener-
ated mice that lack Atg16l1 only in trophoblast lineage cells 
by crossing the Cyp19-promoter-driven Cre− recombinase 
mice (Wenzel and Leone, 2007) with Atg16L1fl/fl mice. Preg-
nant Cyp 19 Cre+ Atg16L1fl/fl mice and Cre− control mice 
were treated with anti-Ifnar1 as described above and subse-
quently inoculated subcutaneously at E.9.5 with 103 FFU 
of ZIKV (Paraiba 2015; Fig. 5 A). Analysis of the placentas 
from Cyp 19 Cre+ Atg16L1fl/fl mice revealed that loss of this 
gene in trophoblasts resulted in reduced ZIKV infection in 
the placenta, similar to that seen with the Atg16l1HM mice 
(Fig. 5, B and C). Unexpectedly, these differences in placental 
infection did not translate into reductions in fetal head titers

(Fig. 5 D) or increases in fetus size (not depicted), suggesting 
that ATG16L1 may be important for viral survival or repli-
cation in other cell types (e.g., fetal brain neurons, Hofbauer 
cells at the maternal-fetal interface).
Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy results in 
decreased ZIKV infection at the maternal-fetal interface
Given that a reduction of autophagic activity in human tro-
phoblasts and genetic loss of function of Atg16l1 in mice 
limited ZIKV infection, we reasoned that an existing drug 
that inhibited autophagy and could be administered in preg-
nancy might have immediate therapeutic utility. HCQ is a 
Food and Drug Administration–approved class C drug that 
is used clinically to treat pregnant patients with malaria or 
autoimmune diseases (Kaplan et al., 2016). As systemic ad-
ministration of HCQ has been successfully used to dampen 
autophagic activity in vivo (Rosenfeldt et al., 2013), we tested 
its efficacy against ZIKV infection during pregnancy. WT 
pregnant mice were administered HCQ (40 mg/kg/d) via 
intraperitoneal injection beginning at day +1 (E10.5) after 
ZIKV infection (Fig. 6 A); this dosage has known in vivo 
inhibitory effects on autophagy (Rosenfeldt et al., 2013) and 
was not associated with any differences in litter size compared 
with PBS-treated mice (Fig. S3 A). HCQ treatment signifi-
cantly increased the levels of p62 (indicative of reduced auto-
phagic activity) in trophoblasts, which validates the inhibitory 
effects of HCQ on autophagy in the placenta (Fig. 6 B). We 
next evaluated the effect of HCQ treatment during ZIKV 
infection in pregnancy. Notably, HCQ-treated mouse placen-
tas sustained lower levels of ZIKV infection compared with 
PBS-treated controls (Fig. 6 C).
Although several groups have observed that treatment 
with HCQ or the related CQ can reduce flavivirus infec-
tion in cell culture, possibly through effects on viral fusion 
or maturation through inhibition of acidification of intracel-
lular vesicles (Farias et al., 2014; Delvecchio et al., 2016), its 
function in vivo is less clear, as a randomized clinical trial of 
CQ treatment of Dengue virus infection showed no benefit 
in adults from Vietnam (Savarino et al., 2003; Tricou et al., 
2010). 
T
o ensure that the reduction in viral burden in the pla-
centa was not due to reduced infection titers in the periph-
eral maternal tissues, we analyzed viral titers in the pregnant 
dams. No differences in viral burden in the serum, spleen, 
or maternal decidua were observed between the HCQ- and 
PBS-treated groups (Fig. 6, D and E; and Fig. S3 B). However, 
ISH staining for ZIKV RNA showed a marked reduction of 
ZIKV RNA in the placentas of HCQ-treated mice com-
pared with controls (Fig. 6 F). Thus, the reduction in ZIKV 
infection by HCQ treatment in the context of pregnancy was 
specific to the placenta.
Histological analysis of HCQ-treated ZIKV-infected 
mice showed improvement in placental areas with reduced 
placental damage, as indicated by decreased numbers of apop-
totic trophoblasts and immature fetal erythrocytes (Fig. 6, 
G and H). Similar to the results noted in Atg16l1HM mice, 
Figure 3. deficiency of AtG16l1 impairs ZIKV infection in fetus and

HCQ treatment reversed the reduction in area of the laby-
rinth (Fig. 6 I). Thus, HCQ treatment rescues the placental 
insufficiency that occurs after ZIKV infection. Consistent 
with a reduction in placental infection and improved tissue 
disease, HCQ treatment reduced ZIKV infection in the fetal 
head, which was associated with larger fetal body size (Fig. 6, 
J and K). Finally, we sought to confirm that this improvement 
in fetal status was due to inhibition of autophagy by treat-
ing ZIKV-infected Atg16l1HM mice with HCQ. As expected, 
there was no difference in placental or fetal ZIKV titers in 
Atg16l1HM mice with or without HCQ treatment (Fig. S3, C 
and D). Thus, our findings indicate that HCQ administration 
in pregnant dams can reverse the ZIKV associated autoph-
agy induction in the placenta and reduce placental insuffi-
ciency, thus limiting vertical transmission of ZIKV infection 
and fetal growth defects.
dIscussIon
The placenta acts as barrier to protect the developing fetus 
from the invading pathogens. In previous studies, we showed 
that autophagy protects against bacterial infection of the pla-
centa (Cao et al., 2016). Here, in the context of ZIKV
, we 
demonstrate the opposite: blocking the autophagy pathway 
in the placenta restricted ZIKV infection in the placenta and 
fetus during pregnancy. Most important, we demonstrated 
that placental trophoblast specific knockout of a key auto-
phagy gene, Atg16l1, was sufficient to limit ZIKV placental 
infectivity. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show a 
placental cell–derived mechanism governing susceptibility to 
maternal-fetal transmission of ZIKV
. These findings enhance 
our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of ZIKV ma-
ternal-fetal transmission and a possible therapy for enhancing 
the placental barrier function and controlling ZIKV infection.
Flaviviruses have been known to modulate autophagy 
in the context of infection (Pirooz et al., 2014). Different 
flaviviruses appear to have evolved distinct abilities to avoid 
or use autophagy to promote survival or infection at differ-
ent stages of the viral life cycle, including viral replication, 
assembly, and release (Chiramel et al., 2013). For example, 
West Nile virus infection does not induce LC3 lipidation, 
and depletion of ATG5, a binding partner of ATG16L1, does 
not affect its replication (Vandergaast and Fredericksen, 2012; 
Martín-Acebes et al., 2015). However, administration of 
Tat-beclin-1, an autophagy-inducing peptide, reduces neu-
ronal infection, cell death, and mortality associated with West 
Nile virus intracranial inoculation (Shoji-Kawata et al., 2013). 
In contrast, a deficiency in ATG5 in mouse neuroblastoma 
cells resulted in higher viral replication of the Japanese en-
cephalitis virus (Sharma et al., 2014), suggesting that auto-
phagy restricts infection. Others have shown that inducers 
of autophagy can lead to increased Dengue virus burden and 
pathogenicity in mice (Mateo et al., 2013), with a require-
ment of autophagy for optimal viral RNA replication and 
virion maturation (Mateo et al., 2013).
In vitro evidence has suggested that the autophagy 
pathway can modulate ZIKV infection: ZIKV was shown to 
induce autophagy in skin fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015) and 
human fetal neural stem cells (Liang et al., 2016), and this 
was associated with enhanced replication. However, in vivo 
evidence for such effects, especially on maternal-fetal trans-
mission of ZIKV
, has been lacking. We show that a genetic or 
pharmacologically induced deficiency in autophagy impairs

ZIKV infection in the placenta and fetus without affecting 
systemic infection of other maternal organs. Thus, inhibition 
of autophagy is beneficial for the host to limit ZIKV mater-
nal-fetal infection, which contrasts with its host defense roles 
in other placental infection models (Delorme-Axford et al., 
2013; Cao et al., 2016). This finding suggests that ZIKV has

 Autophagic regulation of ZIKV vertical transmission | Cao et al.
2310
evolved strategies to usurp autophagy pathway for its own 
replicative advantage, but that this effect is restricted to certain 
cell types. It remains unclear why the impact of autophagy 
on ZIKV infection is more apparent in placental cells com-
pared with other cell types. Our current work provides in 
vivo evidence that decreased autophagic activity is beneficial 
for the host in fighting ZIKV maternal-fetal transmission and 
indicates why ZIKV would induce autophagy. Recent stud-
ies have addressed the mechanisms of how ZIKV may have 
this effect. A study investigating ZIKV pathogenesis in human 
neurospheres showed that two nonstructural proteins of ZIKV
, 
NS4A and NS4B, induced autophagy by suppressing the 
Akt-mTOR pathway (Liang et al., 2016). Moreover, ZIKV 
NS3 protease can cleave FAM134, an ER-localized protein 
required for reticulophagy, a selective form of autophagy that 
leads to ER degradation (Lennemann and Coyne, 2017).
Devastating fetal and neonatal outcomes caused by the 
recent ZIKV epidemic highlight the importance of studying 
mechanisms underlying maternal-fetal transmission of ZIKV
. 
Placental trophoblast barriers contribute to defense responses 
to ZIKV vertical transmission. We showed that HCQ can 
successfully reduce viral burden both in human trophoblast 
cells and in mouse placentas. Whereas HCQ treatment leads 
to an increase in pH in intracellular vesicles, including lyso-
somes, and autophagosomes, and CQ has been shown to have 
antiviral activity in cell culture by inhibiting viruses including 
ZIKV at different stages of the viral life cycle (Savarino et al., 
2003; Delvecchio et al., 2016), our p62 expression data sug-
gest that the anti-ZIKV activity after HCQ treatment in vivo 
is due to modulation of autophagy. Consistent with this idea, 
other autophagy inhibitors, (e.g., 3-MA), which target differ-
ent stages of autophagy, showed anti-ZIKV activity, whereas 
treatment with the autophagy activators rapamycin and T
orin 
1 resulted in increased viral infection in cultured tropho-
blasts. Moreover, HCQ treatment in mice phenocopied the 
reduced viral burden phenotype observed in mice deficient 
in Atg16l1, with decreased infection in the placenta and fetus 
but not in maternal tissues, which might be expected by a 
drug that was affecting a key stage in the viral life cycle. In 
addition, HCQ-induced inhibition of autophagy had no 
discernible impact on ZIKV infection of Atg16l1-deficient 
mice. 
These findings suggest that inhibition of autophagy spe-
cifically impairs ZIKV infection of the placenta, which results 
in reduced infection and disease in the fetuses.
Given the epidemic nature of ZIKV infection and its 
potential for congenital malformations, immediate interven-
tions to prevent or treat ZIKV infection, especially at the 
maternal-fetal interface, are urgently required. Although sev-
eral studies have shown promising anti-ZIKV activity with 
clinically approved drugs (Barrows et al., 2016; Delvecchio 
et al., 2016; Elfiky, 2016; Eyer et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016; 
Zmurko et al., 2016; Sacramento et al., 2017), most of these 
experiments were performed in cell culture, and of the few 
showing in vivo efficacy, none of the studies were performed 
in the setting of pregnancy. Although mouse placentas are 
anatomically different from human and nonhuman primate 
placentas (Rossant and Cross, 2001), the placental trophoblast 
barrier functions analogously. Our experiments on ZIKV in-
fection inhibition in a mouse model of pregnancy are appli-
cable to the understanding of ZIKV infection pathogenesis 
and may provide the foundation for experiments in nonhu-
man primates and clinical trials in humans to further define 
the therapeutic effects of modulating autophagic activity on 
ZIKV congenital disease.
Additionally, a limitation of many of the drugs (e.g., 
PHA-690509, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) is that 
they may not be suitable for administration during pregnancy 
because of their own potential teratogenic effects. HCQ 
is a Food and Drug Administration–approved class C drug 
that has been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases 
during pregnancy without apparent injury to the fetus, al-
though it has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled 
trial. The current recommendation is that the potential ben-
efits may warrant HCQ use in pregnant women despite 
potential risks, depending on the target disease. Our results 
suggest that a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy war-
rants possible evaluation in nonhuman primates and humans 
during pregnancy to diminish the risks of ZIKV infection 
and disease in developing fetuses.

ethics statement
All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Wash-
ington University School of Medicine. Inoculations and 
dissections were performed under anesthesia to minimize 
 
animal suffering.
Viruses and titration
The Brazilian strain of ZIKV (Paraiba 2015) was provided by 
S. Whitehead (Bethesda, MD) and originally obtained from 
P
.F
.C. 
Vasconcelos (Instituto Evandro Chagas, Levilândia, Bra-
zil). Virus stocks were propagated in Vero cells. The titers of 
ZIKV stocks were determined by focus-forming assay (FF on 
Vero cells as described previously; Miner et al., 2016). Studies 
with ZIKV were conducted under biosafety level 2 and ani-
mal biosafety level 3 containment.
cell culture and infection
JEG-3 cells were obtained from ATCC (HB-36) and cul-
tured in F12/DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C with 5% CO2. JEG-3 cells 
were infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 
for 2 h, washed twice with warm PBS, and cultured in fresh 
medium with indicated treatments. At indicated time points, 
supernatants were harvested for virus titration or fixed for 
immunofluorescence staining of ZIKV using a ZIKV-specific 
mAb, ZIKV-2, as previously described (Miner et al., 2016). 
For monitoring autophagic flux, JEG-3 cells were transiently 
transfected with an EGFP-LC3 plasmid (11546; Addgene; 
 2311
JEM Vol. 214, No. 8
deposited by K. Kirkegaard) using the TransIT
-X2 reagent 
(MIR 6000; Mirus) for 24 h. EGFP-LC3+ JEG-3 cells were 
infected and fixed for fluorescence microscopy.
Mouse experiments
Atg16l1HM and Atg16l1flox/flox mice were provided by H. 
Virgin 
(Washington University, St. Louis, MO; Cadwell et al., 2008). 
Cyp19-Cre transgenic mice were a kind gift from Gustavo 
Leone (The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) and were 
generated as previously described (Wenzel and Leone, 2007). 
All mice were on a C57BL6 background and housed under a 
12-h light/12-h dark cycle in a specific pathogen–free mouse 
breeding facility. For mating, 8- to 10-wk-old male and nul-
liparous female mice were cohoused from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., 
and day 0.5 of pregnancy was defined as the first observation 
of a vaginal plug. Pregnant mice were inoculated by subcu-
taneous route in the footpad with 103 FFU of ZIKV in a 
volume of 50 µl. One day before infection, mice were treated 
with a single dose of 2 mg of an Ifnar1-blocking mouse anti-
body (MAR1-5A3, purchased from Leinco, Inc.) by intraper-
itoneal injection. Fetal size were measured by crown-rump 
length and occipital-frontal diameter at 4 d postfixation.
Measurement of viral burden
ZIKV-infected pregnant mice were euthanized on E14.5, and 
fetoplacental units were dissected. Placentas and fetal heads 
were weighed and homogenized in 250 or 500 µl PBS. All 
homogenized tissues from infected animals were stored at 
−80°C until virus titration. RNA from tissue samples was 
extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (QIA 
GEN). Serum from 
ZIKV-infected mice and culture medium from ZIKV-in-
fected JEG-3 cells were extracted with Viral RNA Mini kit 
(QIA 
GEN). ZIKV RNA copy number was determined by 
one-step quantitative RT
-PCR on an ABI 7500 Fast Instru-
ment using standard cycling conditions as described previ-
ously (Miner et al., 2016). The following primers and probe 
targeting ZIKV were used: 5′-CCA 
CAT 
GTC 
TCT 
GCA 
GAC 
ATA 
TG-3′; reverse: 5′-TTC 
GAC 
AGC 
GTG 
TCA 
CAC 
AG-3′; and probes: 5′-56-FAM/AGC 
CTA 
CCT 
TGA 
CAA 
GCA 
GTC/3IABkFQ-3′ (Integrated DNA T
echnologies).
Histology and immunohistochemistry staining
Placentas and fetuses were dissected by cesarean section on 
E14.5. Harvested samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered 
formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature and 
embedded in paraffin. At least five placentas from different 
dams with the indicated genotypes or treatments were sec-
tioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess mor-
phology. Histologic images were captured by use of a Nikon 
Eclipse microscope equipped with an Olympus DP71 color 
camera under 2×, 20×, and 40× objectives. Measurement of 
size and thickness of different placental layers were performed 
using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).
For immunohistochemical staining of mouse placentas, 
deparaffinized tissues were quenched with 3% H2O2, blocked 
for 2 h, and incubated with primary antibodies anti-p62 
(1:500; ab56416; Abcam) overnight. The M.O.M. kit (BMK-
2202; Vector Laboratories) was applied for blocking and sec-
ondary antibody incubation according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The sections were then incubated with the ABC 
reagent from the Vectastain universal kit (PK-7200; Vector 
Laboratories) and developed using the DAB substrate kit 
(SK-4100; Vector Laboratories). Tissues were counterstained 
with hematoxylin. A no–primary antibody staining was in-
cluded as a negative control.
rnA IsH
RNA ISH was performed with an RNAscope 2.5 (Ad-
vanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. In brief, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue 
sections were deparaffinized and incubated at 60°C for 1 h. 
H2O2 was applied to quench endogenous peroxidases for 10 
min at room temperature. Slides were then boiled in RNA-
scope Target Retrieval Reagents for 15 min and incubated 
for 30 min in RNAscope Protease Plus. The ZIKV probe 
(catalog #467871), positive probe (the plr2a probe; cata-
log #312471) and negative probe (targeting bacterial gene 
dapB; catalog #310043) were designed and synthesized by 
Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Tissues were counterstained with 
hematoxylin and mount. Images were captured with standard 
bright-field microscopy under 2× and 20× objectives.
Western blotting
T
otal protein was extracted form frozen mouse placenta sam-
ples and homogenized in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling T
ech-
nology) with protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich). For 
cell cultures, cells were lysed directly in RIPA buffer. Equiv-
alent amounts of total protein, determined by BCA assays 
(Thermo FIsher Scientific), were separated on 4%–20% Mini-
PRO 
TEAN precast gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and trans-
ferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes 
were blocked in 5% milk in PBS with T
ween 20 for 2 h at 
room temperature and incubated with indicated antibodies in 
5% BSA at 4°C overnight. The following primary antibodies 
and dilutions were used: anti-LC3B (1:1,000; NB600-1384; 
Novus Biologicals), anti-p62 (1:1,000; ab56416; Abcam), and 
anti-GAP 
DH (1:2,000; 3700s; Cell Signaling T
echnology). 
ImageJ was used for densitometry of Western blots.
statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used for all analyses. The analyses 
of virologic or histopathological data were conducted using 
a Mann-Whitney test or ANO 
VA with a multiple com-
parison test. P-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate 
statistical significance.
