Abstract: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) contribute to excessive weight gain through added
energy intake. Replacing SSB with water is one strategy that has shown promise in helping lower
excessive energy intake. Using nationally representative data from US adults (n = 19,718) from
NHANES 2007–2012 we examine the impact of replacing SSB with water on Healthy Beverage Index
(HBI) scores and obesity prevalence. Replacing an 8-ounce serving of SSB with water lowered the
percent of energy from beverages from 17% to 11% (among those consuming 1 serving SSB/day).
Reductions in the percent energy from beverages were observed across all SSB consumption groups
(1–2 servings/day and >2 servings/day). Among adults there was a 9% to 21% improvement in HBI
score when one serving of water replaced one serving of SSB. Using previously published randomized
controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses of measured weight loss we also predicted a reduction
in the prevalence of obesity (observed: 35.2%; predicted 33.5%–34.9%, p < 0.05) and increase in the
prevalence of normal weight (observed: 29.7%; high weight loss: 31.3%, p < 0.05). Our findings
provide further epidemiologic evidence that water in the place of SSB can be used as a strategy to
limit energy intake and help individuals meet beverage intake recommendations.

1. Introduction
Beverages are significant contributors to the daily diets of US adults and have been associated
with health through a number of different pathways [1]. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), including
soda and sweetened fruit drinks in particular, have remained at the forefront of obesity-related policy
debates due to their contribution to excess energy intake and the observation that liquid calories (e.g.,
beverages) may [2–4] or may not [5–7] be as satiating as calories in solid form (e.g., food). Regular SSB
consumption has been positively associated with increased body weight and risk of obesity [8–13],
diabetes [9,14–16], cardiovascular disease [10], and adverse dietary intake patterns [10,17]. While there
is increasingly consistent evidence suggesting that total SSB consumption has been declining over
the past 10–15 years [18,19], current consumption levels among many racial/ethnic, age, and income
groups nationally (and internationally [20]) remain higher than recommended [19]. For example,
while the prevalence of soda consumption among US adolescents decreased between 1999 and 2010,
the prevalence of energy drink consumption tripled over that same time period [19].
Maintaining adequate hydration, specifically through water consumption, is associated with
a number of beneficial health outcomes including maintaining peak physical and cognitive

performance [21], weight management [22] and weight gain prevention [23], and improving metabolic
rate [24]. Though there is not a Recommended Daily Allowance for total water intake, the Institute of
Medicine’s Food and Nutrition Board suggested a Daily Recommended Intake for adult males and
non-pregnant, non-lactating females over 19 years of 3.7 L/day and 2.7 L/day, respectively. Although
water intake remains below recommended levels among most segments of the population [24,25],
bottled water is poised to overtake soda as the top selling beverage (by volume) [26,27], and powerful
new marketing campaigns [28] are hoping to change the way Americans think about water, bottled
and tap [29].
Among the top recommendations put forth in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is to shift
to healthier food and beverage choices [30], specifically that Americans should “shift to reduce added
sugar consumption to less than 10 percent of calories per day” [30]. The guidelines additionally state
that when choosing beverages “calorie and nutrient contribution to the diet should be considered” and
that “calorie-free beverages—especially water—should be favored” [30]. Making individual beverage
choice changes can be a challenge because recommendations are not put into the broader context of
overall beverage and dietary intake patterns. The Healthy Beverage Index (HBI) [31] was designed to
overcome that challenge by providing a system for evaluating overall beverage quality and comparing
that intake against standards set forth by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Beverage
Guidance Panel [32]. Furthermore, preliminary studies indicate that higher HBI scores are positively
associated with cardiovascular health [31,33] and may, therefore, prove a useful tool for evaluating the
beneficial impact that changes in beverage consumption patterns might have on health.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential impact of replacing one serving of
SSB with water on HBI score and overweight prevalence.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Population
Nationally representative data from US adults (aged 19 and older, n = 19,718) from the 2007–2012
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and What We Eat in America dietary
intake portion of the NHAHES datasets were used in this study. Individuals with missing dietary data
(n = 3289) were excluded from all analyses leaving a final analytic sample of n = 16,429. Sampling
methods for continuous NHANES datasets are described in detail elsewhere [34].
2.2. Dietary Intake and Beverage Groups
Dietary data were collected using an interviewer administered 24-h recall conducted in-person
by trained interviewers during the medical exam in the Mobile Exam Center (MEC) using the United
State Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Automated Multiple Pass Method. A complete description
of the survey design is available elsewhere [35,36].
Each food or beverage was recorded by using a discrete food code and matched to nutrient
information from the USDA’s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) versions 4.1
(2007–2008), 5.0 (2009–2010), and FNDDS 2011–2012 (2011–2012) [37]. Beverages were initially classified
according to the Global Food Research Program at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Food
Grouping System [38], which categorizes beverages separately based on their differential effects
on satiety and weight gain. These groups were further condensed in accordance with the Healthy
Beverage Index (HBI) guidelines [31] into the following eight groups: Water, Unsweetened Coffee
and Tea, Low-Fat (<1.5% and soy) and Skim Milk (hereafter Low-Fat Milk), Diet beverages (including
non-calorically sweetened coffee and tea), 100% Fruit Juice, Alcohol (including beer, wine and liquor),
Whole Milk (ě1.5% fat), and SSB (including soda, fruit drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, energy drinks
and other beverages (e.g., meal replacement drinks).

2.3. Healthy Beverage Index
Development and scoring of the HBI has been previously described in detail [31]. Briefly,
the ten individual components of the HBI were calculated and scored on a range from 0 to 100
for each participant according to published guidelines. A full description of the final individual
10 components and their scoring criteria can be found in Appendix A. A higher score indicates better
adherence to beverage guidelines and an overall healthier beverage intake pattern.
2.4. Anthropometrics
Anthropometric data were collected during the in-person medical exam in the MEC by trained
health technicians with participants dressed in light clothing using a digital scale and standing
stadiometer. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm, and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared,
and then rounded to one decimal place. Individuals were grouped into the following BMI categories:
Underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), Normal Weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), Overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and
Obese (ě30.0 kg/m2).
2.5. Statistical Analyses
Analyses were conducted using Stata version 13 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Mean
(standard error (SE)) baseline levels of beverage and macronutrient intake for children and adults were
determined across age groups. The number of 8-ounce (oz) servings of SSB was also determined for all
age groups, and individuals were classified as consuming <1 serving, 1–2 servings, or >2 servings over
the previous 24 h period. Total energy from all food and beverages and total energy from beverages
alone were also calculated and used to generate a measure of percent of energy from beverages. Mean
(SE) HBI scores were determined at baseline and recalculated after replacing 1 serving of SSB with
1 serving of water (predicted score). One 8 oz serving was assumed to equal 237 mL of water, and an
average reduction of 100 kcal/8 oz SSB was used to estimate changes in energy intake. The change
in HBI score was then calculated between the observed score and predicted score, and the percent
change in HBI between predicted and observed was then calculated. Student’s t-tests, with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons, were used to determine statistical significance between observed
and predicted HBI scores. Significance level was set at p < 0.05.
To predict the impact of replacing one serving of SSB with one serving of water, we applied
observed changes in weight from previously published, peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials
(RCT) or intervention studies [39], to our population across SSB consumption groups. Specifically, the
observed range of changes in weight was from ´0.40 kg weight loss to ´1.99 kg weight loss [39]. Using
these predicted weights, we recalculated BMI and weight classification (normal weight, overweight,
obese) to determine the potential impact on overweight and obesity prevalence we might expect from
the substitution.
Results were weighted to account for study design and to be nationally representative. The
NHANES was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board.
The present study used de-identified publicly available data from NHANES [40] and is therefore
exempt from Institutional Review Board approval.
3. Results
3.1. Sugar Sweetened Beverage Consumption
Differences in intake (ounces (oz)) of individual beverage groups exist across age groups (Table 1).
Among adults, water consumption is at its highest for adults aged 19–29 then drops in older age
groups. Younger and middle aged adults (aged 19–49) consume the largest absolute number and
the largest proportion of their calories from beverages, at 21% (Table 1). The oldest adults (66+) are
consuming a greater proportion of water compared to SSBs. 19–29 year olds consume roughly 2.5 times
more water than SSB whereas adults 66+ years old consume roughly 6.5 times more water than SSB.

Older adults had the highest proportion of non-consumers and the smallest proportion of high SSB
consumers (>2 SSB servings, Table 2). Those considered the highest consumers of SSB (>2 servings/day)
were predominately younger and middle-aged adults (aged 19–49). The youngest age group had the
largest average SSB consumption among SSB consumers (29.6 oz) and among the age group more
broadly (18.5 oz). SSB consumption in the full sample and among consumers decreased among older
individuals (Table 2).

Replacing one 8 oz SSB serving with one 8 oz serving of water resulted in considerable change in
total energy from beverages and percent of energy from beverages across all age groups (Table 3) with
the largest change observed among those who consumed just one SSB serving in the previous 24 h.
Among adults who consumed one SSB serving, replacing that with one serving of water resulted in a
33% decrease in total energy and a decrease in the percent of energy from beverages. This resulted in a
lowering of their percent of energy from beverages to within the acceptable range [26] of 10%–14%
(Table 3).

The distribution of average HBI score among adults is shown in Table 4. Across all age groups,
SSB non-consumers had the highest HBI score (indicating greatest adherence to beverage guidelines
and recommendations, ranging from 79 to 81 (of 100)). HBI scores were progressively lower with each
additional serving of SSB reported as consumed. Older adults (aged 66+) who consumed >2 servings
of SSB had the lowest HBI score (mean (SD): 54.4 (0.7)), younger adults (aged 19–29) who were SSB
non-consumers had the highest (mean (SD): 81.0 (0.7)).

Replacing one serving of SSB with water was predicted to improve HBI scores regardless of age
groups and across all levels of SSB consumption (Figure 1). At the highest level of SSB consumption
(>2 servings SSB), the impact of replacing one serving of SSB with water was greatest for the oldest age
group (66+ years, 12.3% increase in HBI score). Regardless of age, replacing one serving of SSB with
water had the greatest impact on HBI score among those who consumed between 1 and 2 servings of
SSB (range: 21.9%–24.8% increase in HBI score, Figure 1), and this effect was greater for those in older
(66+ years) compared to younger (19–29 years) age groups.

4. Discussion
This present study confirmed previous reports that a considerable portion of adults are regular
consumers of SSB and that those who frequently consume SSB have higher levels of total energy intake
as well as energy from beverages. Individuals who consumed a higher number of servings of SSB
also had significantly lower HBI scores, indicating that they were further from meeting beverage
recommendations compared to those who were SSB non-consumers. In the present study we also
report that replacing one serving of SSB with one serving of water significantly improved HBI scores,
lowered percent of energy from beverages across intake groups and, in the lowest intake group
(1 serving SSB) allowed them to meet the recommendation of consuming <14% of total energy from
beverages. Lastly, our findings provide further evidence that water replacement may be an effective
strategy for adults concerned about excessive weight. The energy reduction associated with water
replacement we predict would significantly lower the proportion of adults classified as obese from
35% down to 32% of the population.
Similar results have been previously reported.
A recently published study of more than
18,000 adults using US-based nationally representative dietary intake surveys predicted that a
1 percentage point increase in the proportion of daily plain water was associated with a reduction
of roughly 8.5 kcal/day [25]. This finding has been confirmed in experimental and epidemiological
studies, where pre-meal water consumption has been documented to reduce meal energy intake
in various groups of individuals, including those who are overweight and obese and among older
adults [41–43]. Given these previously estimated energy savings (68 kcal savings with an 8 ounce
replacement of water for SSB [25]), and the fact that roughly 30% of US adults drink one or more
servings of SSB/day [44], swapping water for SSB could reduce an estimated 3.9 billion calories from
US adult diets daily. Using the observed prevalence of adults consuming at least one SSB serving/day
in this study (41.4%), this saving could be as high as 5.8 billion calories saved from American adult
diets daily.
Evidence of the impact of SSB reduction on body weight is unequivocal. Using nationally
representative data from the UK, Ma et al. [45] report that an estimated 40% reduction in free sugars
added to SSB over five years would result in an estimated 1.2 kg body weight reduction and a 1% point
decrease in the prevalence of overweight and 2.1% point decrease in the prevalence of obesity among
adults [45]. In the US, each one cup per day increment of water intake was inversely associated with
weight gain over a 4 year period [23] and a 2013 meta-analysis of RCTs provide fairly convincing
evidence that decreasing SSB consumption will decrease the risk of obesity and obesity related diseases
such as Type 2 diabetes [8]. Daniels and Popkin additionally state that findings from clinical trials
and epidemiologic and intervention studies suggest water has a potentially important role to play
in reducing energy intake, and consequently in obesity prevention [46]. These findings have been
replicated in non-US settings as well [16,47,48]. However, Hernandez-Cordero et al. [49] found there
was no effect of the intervention on triglyceride concentration or on any of the studied outcomes
(including weight and waist circumference) in a group of overweight and obese Mexican women [50].
Nonnutritive, or diet, beverages as a replacement for SSB (instead of water) have also been
suggested as a means to promote weight loss or encourage weight maintenance, but the findings from
these studies are also equivocal. Recently published results from a 1-year RCT evaluating the effects of
water compared to low-calorie sweetener (LCS) beverages on body weight in subjects participating in a
commercially available weight loss treatment program reported greater 1-year weight loss maintenance
among those in the LCS compared to water groups (6.21 kg vs. 2.75 kg respectively) [51]. Others
report no difference in weight loss (after 6 months) in the Low-Calorie Beverage compared to Water
intervention group [52]. However, they did find that participants in the Water arm of the intervention
significantly increased their consumption of fruits and vegetables [53] and had greater reductions in
other important markers of health including fasting glucose and improved hydration [53]. Earlier
research has shown that dietary and beverage patterns are associated with one another, suggesting that
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 395

choosing water over diet beverages, as a replacement for SSB, may be associated with other healthy
dietary choices [54–56].
The studies from which our weight-loss estimates were drawn were based on weight loss observed
in randomized controlled trials, which lasted 6 (´0.40 kg weight loss) and 8 months (´1.99 kg weight
loss) in a free-living population. In the context of evaluating potential weight loss, this is a meaningful
distinction because RCTs that use a controlled feeding methodology may have limited generalizability
to a free-living population [57]. Our study did not specifically examine or model the potential
compensatory changes in dietary components (including foods and beverages) or in other behaviors
like changes in physical activity, except to the extent that these compensatory changes were observed
in the free-living population participating in the original weight loss studies themselves [39].
Although trends indicate some decline in intake of sugar sweetened beverages, most Americans
are still consuming too many calories from beverages, and from sugar-sweetened beverages specifically.
There is ample evidence to suggest that this overconsumption is a contributing factor to excessive
weight gain and that options for reducing energy intake, especially the excess energy from beverages,
can help limit this excessive weight gain and might even contribute to weight maintenance or weight
loss. Results from our study provide further evidence that replacing SSB with water is one potential
strategy to achieve these energy reductions and which could benefit adults in the US. Evaluating the
impact of water replacement on diet and weight in children and the development of the HBI for a
pediatric population are important directions for future research on this topic.
