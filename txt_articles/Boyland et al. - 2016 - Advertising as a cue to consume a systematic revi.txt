ABSTRACT
Background: Several studies have assessed the effects of food and
nonalcoholic beverage (hereafter collectively referred to as food)
advertising on food consumption, but the results of these studies
have been mixed. This lack of clarity may be impeding policy
action.
Objective: We examined the evidence for a relation between acute
exposure to experimental unhealthy food advertising and food
consumption.
Design: The study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of
published studies in which advertising exposure (television or
Internet) was experimentally manipulated, and food intake was
measured. Five electronic databases were searched for relevant
publications (SCOPUS, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Emerald Insight,
and JSTOR). An inverse variance meta-analysis was used
whereby the standardized mean difference (SMD) in food intake
was calculated between unhealthy food advertising and control
conditions.
Results: Twenty-two articles were eligible for inclusion. Data were
available for 18 articles to be included in the meta-analysis (which
provided 20 comparisons). With all available data included, the
analysis indicated a small-to-moderate effect size for advertising
on food consumption with participants eating more after exposure
to food advertising than after control conditions (SMD: 0.37; 95%
CI: 0.09; 0.65; I2 = 98%). Subgroup analyses showed that the ex-
periments with adult participants provided no evidence of an effect
of advertising on intake (SMD: 0.00; P = 1.00; 95% CI: 20.08,
0.08; I2 = 8%), but a significant effect of moderate size was shown
for children, whereby food advertising exposure was associated
with greater food intake (SMD: 0.56; P = 0.003; 95% CI: 0.18,
0.94; I2 = 98%).
Conclusions: Evidence to date shows that acute exposure to food
advertising increases food intake in children but not in adults. These
data support public health policy action that seeks to reduce chil-
dren’s exposure to unhealthy food advertising.

INTRODUCTION
Obesogenic food environments are thought to be a key driver
of the obesity epidemic (1). Because of this association, envi-
ronmental factors that promote unhealthy dietary habits and
excess consumption are of public health concern (2, 3). Spe-
cifically, the role of food marketing, particularly to children
[because of concerns about their comprehension of marketing
and its persuasive intent (4, 5)], has been closely scrutinized.
Such marketing is extensive, perhaps most notable on television
and the Internet, and almost entirely promotes high-fat, -sugar,
and -salt foods (6–9). However, despite guidance from the WHO
(10, 11) and numerous policy initiatives (12), few countries have
enforced effective restrictions in this area (7, 13).
A small number of systematic reviews have sought to capture
and evaluate the evidence base that links unhealthy food pro-
motion to diet-related outcomes for the purposes of informing
policy action (14–17). These narrative reviews have been in
broad agreement that unhealthy food marketing has a detrimen-
tal impact on children, although the data relating to adults was
deemed too limited to draw firm conclusions (17).
There is a growing body of research that explores the acute
experimental effects of unhealthy food advertising [the most
prominent form of marketing (4)] on food intake. Such studies are
important because they have indicated the potential impacts of
exposure to longer-term food advertising, which is more difficult
to measure within fully controlled paradigms. Several studies
have shown that, relative to control conditions (nonfood adver-
tisements or no advertisements), ad libitum food intake of par-
ticipants was greater after exposure to unhealthy food advertising
in terms of the amount consumed (18–20) and/or caloric load

 (21–26). However, some studies have either failed to show an
effect (27, 28) or produced mixed findings (29–31). Moreover,
where effects have been shown, in some studies they were
moderated by food neophobia (21) and weight status (26), which
indicated that the potentially harmful effects that food adver-
tising has on food intake may be particularly exhibited in spe-
cific population subgroups.
A synthesis of the available evidence is required to draw
firm conclusions. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review
and meta-analysis of studies that have manipulated the acute
exposure to experimental unhealthy food advertising and
measured food intake. We also investigated subgroup differ-
ences with an examination of whether effects of advertising on
food intake were moderated by the primary medium of ad-
vertising (television and the Internet) and age (children and
adults).
METHODS
Data sources and search strategy
The current systematic review is reported in accordance with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses statement (32). An a priori protocol for this study was not
published. No substantive changes were made to the study design
after inception. The following 5 electronic databases were
searched during September 2014: SCOPUS (http://www.scopus.
com/), PsycINFO (http://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/psycinfo/
index.aspx), MEDLINE (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/),
Emerald Insight (http://www.emeraldinsight.com/), and JSTOR
(http://www.jstor.org). Searches included a combination of rele-
vant key words (Supplemental Material). Two authors (EJB and
BK) performed the searches independently. The formal electronic
searches were supplemented by a manual search of reference sec-
tions in eligible articles. Corresponding authors of eligible ar-
ticles were contacted to inquire if they had conducted any additional
relevant work, published or unpublished, to reduce risk of pub-
lication bias. One author provided an additional study (24). Sup-
plementary searches of these databases (March 2015) before
submission identified one additional article (33).
Study selection
For inclusion, studies were required to have manipulated acute
advertising exposure (including at least one condition in which
participants were exposed to unhealthy food or nonalcoholic
beverage advertising on television or the Internet and another
condition with a nonfood advertisement or a no-advertisement
control) and formally measured food or nonalcoholic beverage
intake, which was assessed as either energy intake or the quantity
of item consumed. We did not include studies of product-
placement exposure (because this content is not controlled en-
tirely by the food or beverage manufacturer) but did include
studies with participants of any age or weight status. Only studies
with experimental designs were included, and both within-subjects/
repeated-measures and between-subjects/independent-groups de-
signs were suitable. Two authors (EJB and BK) were responsible
for the evaluation of articles for inclusion by independently
screening the titles, abstracts, and full texts of articles that appeared
to meet the criteria. There were no disagreements.
Data extraction
A single author (EJB) extracted data from the included studies,
and these data were checked independently by a different author
(AJ). Corresponding authors were contacted to request the data
required for the meta-analysis when these had not been reported
in the publication. Information about the data extracted from each
article is shown in Table 1.
Quality assessment
To be eligible for inclusion, a control group or condition had to
have been used, and because the studies reviewed were either
laboratory or school-based experiments, the usual quality filters
for randomized trials or observational epidemiologic studies did
not apply. However, we examined whether studies used designs in
which participants were randomly allocated to groups or order of
conditions (i.e., control first or experimental first in a within-
subjects design) because this selection may have influenced
consumptive behaviors.
Quantitative synthesis
From the extracted data, we calculated the standardized
mean difference (SMD) and the SE of the SMD between food
intakes of the experimental (food advertising) and control
conditions in each study (34). We formally assessed the effect
of advertising exposure with the use of a generic inverse-
variance meta-analysis that was conducted in Review Manager
software [RevMan version 5.3.5 (35)]. The use of the SMD,
which is a measure of the effect size, was necessary because
there was variability in the type of measurement scales used
for our main outcome of interest (e.g., food intake could be
measured in ounces, grams, kilocalories, kilojoules, or number

 of items eaten). The interpretation of the SMD was as follows:
0.2 was indicative of a small effect, 0.5 was indicative of a
moderate effect, and 0.8 was indicative of a large effect (36). In
the current analysis, a positive SMD was indicative of greater
consumption after exposure to unhealthy food advertising
relative to a control condition.
For within-subjects/repeated-measures designs, the corre-
lation between experimental and control condition intake
values was taken into account in the calculation of the SE of the
SMD (37). Authors of 5 of these experiments (18, 21, 25, 26,
28) provided us with the correlation. We were unable to retrieve
this information for one of the studies (38), and thus, we es-
timated the correlation to be the same as that of the only other
included within-subjects study with adult participants (28). We
also carried out a sensitivity analysis over a range of correla-
tions, and the conclusions were not changed. We were also
unable to extract mean and SD scores for the total food con-
sumed for 3 studies (19, 20, 38); scores were presented sepa-
rately by food type. Therefore, the total mean and SD scores
were calculated from the scores presented. Seven studies of-
fered one or 2 healthy test foods within a selection of mainly
unhealthy items (19–21, 25, 26, 28, 38). Because these healthy
options were minimal, we did not separate out intakes of
healthy foods. Total mean intakes across all items were used.
One study (39) had 2 conditions of exposure to unhealthy food
advertising (i.e., commercials for a branded potato chip and
another snack food), and thus, we adjusted the sample size of
each comparison in the meta-analysis accordingly. One other
study provided more than one unique comparison (19),
whereby similar trials were carried out with adult and child
participants separately, and thus, each eligible comparison was
entered.
The statistical heterogeneity between studies was assessed
with the use of the I2 statistic. Because of the variability in
study designs and measures, we used random-effects models
for all meta-analyses. Random-effects models are more con-
servative than fixed-effects models are and generate wider CIs
(40). Subgroup analyses (with the use of chi-square tests for
subgroup differences) were conducted to examine whether the
type of media (television or Internet) or age of participants
(children or adults) influenced ad libitum intake after food
advertising exposure. Because there was evidence of con-
siderable heterogeneity in the main analysis, we also con-
ducted exploratory subgroup analyses on specific participant
and study characteristics that may have contributed to the
heterogeneity. We examined publication bias with the use of
Egger’s regression method (41) and a trim-and-fill analysis
(42).

 RESULTS
The study-selection process is depicted in Figure 1. From this
process, 22 articles were deemed to meet the eligibility criteria
for a systematic review; however, 4 of these articles (33, 43–45)
had to be excluded from the meta-analysis because we were
unable to retrieve the required information from the authors (i.e.,
intake means and SDs). Therefore, 18 articles were included in
the meta-analysis from which there were 19 experiments and 20
relevant comparisons [one article (19) incorporated 2 separate
experiments and another article (39) provided 2 comparisons
within the same experiment]. Only one study (45) measured
beverage intake; all other studies measured food intake. Of the 4
articles included in the review but not in the meta-analysis, 2
articles reported that food advertising exposure increased food
intake [one article on adults and one article on children (43,
45)]; one article reported that advertising exposure did not have
an effect on consumption in children (44), and one article
reported mixed findings whereby food advertising exposure
increased intakes in overweight and obese girls but not in
normal-weight girls or in boys (33). Table 2 presents detailed
characteristics and the main outcomes of the research described in
all 22 articles that met the stated eligibility criteria for review.
Participants and designs
Of the 22 eligible publications, 7 articles reported on exper-
iments with adult participants (aged $18 y) only (27, 28, 31, 38,
45–47), and 13 articles described studies of child participants
only (18, 20–26, 29, 30, 33, 39, 44). One article tested both
adults and adolescents in a single experiment (43), and another
article reported on 2 separate experiments, one with adults and
one with children (19). Seven studies used a within-subjects
design (18, 21, 25, 26, 28, 33, 38), and the remaining 15 articles
report on between-subjects experiments (19, 20, 22–24, 27–31,
39, 43–47). Eighteen studies measured the impact of television
advertising on consumption (18, 19, 21, 25–31, 33, 38, 39, 43–
47), and the remaining 4 articles examined exposure to Internet
advergaming (20, 22–24) whereby food branding is incorporated
into an online game. The vast majority of studies measured
participant intakes of snack foods; the exceptions were 3 studies
that used meal items (28, 33, 38), one study that offered a des-
sert item [ice cream (44)] and another study that measured
consumption of a soda beverage (45).
Other study information
Studies with child participants were almost exclusively con-
ducted within the school environment except for when attendees
at a summer camp (19) or scout group (44) were sampled or when
children visited the research laboratory (20, 33). All studies of
adult participants (aged $18 y) were conducted in laboratories.
A random assignment to the condition was carried out in all
between-subject design experiments, and all articles that were
based on within-subjects designs reported the randomization of
the condition order. The blinding of researchers to experimental
condition is problematic in studies of this type (if a single re-
searcher is used, this person must facilitate the advertising ex-
posure and assess consumption), and thus, there is risk of
experimenter bias. Insufficient information was provided in the
published articles for this to be assessed; however, risk was
relatively low because the outcome measures were objectively
measured (i.e., the weight or count of food items).
Meta-analyses
With all 20 possible comparisons included, an SMD of 0.37
(P = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.65; I2 = 98%) was observed, which
constituted a small-to-moderate effect size that showed that
participants ate more after food advertising than after the control
conditions. The removal of the one study that examined bever-
age consumption did not change the results.
Planned subgroup analysis: age of participants
A subgroup analysis that was based on the age of participants
(adults compared with children) showed a significant subgroup
difference (x2 = 8.14, P = 0.004, I2 = 87.7%). For the 7 ex-
periments that included adult participants only, there was no
evidence of an effect of food advertisement exposure on food
intake (SMD: 0.00; P = 1.00; 95% CI: 20.08, 0.08; I2 = 8%).
From the remaining 13 comparisons from 12 experiments in-
volving child participants, advertising exposure had a significant
effect on food intake with participants consuming a greater
amount of food after food advertisements than after the control
condition (SMD: 0.56; P = 0.003; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.94; I2 = 98%)
(Figure 2).
Planned subgroup analysis: type of media
The subgroup analysis that was based on the advertising media
types (television compared with Internet advergaming) was NS
(x2 = 0.32, P = 0.57, I2 = 0%). Both media types had an effect on
intake; the 16 comparisons in which participants were exposed
to television food advertising produced a small-medium effect
(SMD: 0.40; P = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.75; I2 = 98%) as did the
4 studies (20, 22–24) that involved Internet advergaming ex-
posure (SMD: 0.27, P = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.53; I2 = 87%).
When only studies of child participants were analyzed by media
type, the difference between subgroup effects remained non-
significant (x2 = 2.07, P = 0.15, I2 = 51.6%) although studies
that exposed participants to television food advertising appeared
to produce a larger effect (SMD: 0.69; P = 0.009; 95% CI: 0.18,
1.21; I2 = 98%) than did studies in which children had played
Internet advergames (SMD: 0.27; P = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.53;
I2 = 87%). A similar analysis for studies of adult participants
was not possible because all such studies used television-
advertising exposure.
Exploratory subgroup analyses
Because there was considerable heterogeneity across studies of
child participants, we investigated differences in study designs
that may have contributed to this variability. Effect sizes were
larger when studies 1) used within-subjects designs [the sub-
group difference was significant at P = 0.003; there was a sig-
nificant SMD of 1.35 for within-subjects designs (4 studies
contributed 4 comparisons; I2 = 99%) compared with a signifi-
cant SMD of 0.21 for between-subjects designs (8 studies con-
tributed 9 comparisons; I2 = 84%)], 2) offered a selection of
foods [the subgroup difference was significant at P = 0.03; there
was a significant SMD of 0.81 for multi-item food intake (8
studies contributed 8 comparisons; I2 = 99%) compared with

 a nonsignificant SMD of 0.14 for single-item food intake (4
studies contributed 5 comparisons; I2 = 82%)], and 3) offered the
food after advertising exposure only [the subgroup difference
reached significance at P = 0.05; there was a significant SMD of
0.73 for intake after advertising exposure (8 studies contributed
9 comparisons; I2 = 98%) compared with a nonsignificant SMD
of 0.18 when intake included that which occurred during ad-
vertising exposure (4 studies contributed 4 comparisons; I2 =
85%)] (additional details of these analyses are shown in Sup-
plemental Material). In addition, because 5 (18, 21, 25, 26, 39) of
the 12 studies that featuring child participants were from the
same research group, we performed a subgroup analysis that was
based on this categorization of study origin (studies that origi-
nated from the same research group compared with other stud-
ies). The subgroup analysis indicated a significant effect (x2 =
5.30, P = 0.02, I2 = 81%). For the 6 comparisons from the same
research group, there was evidence of a large significant effect
(SMD: 0.98; P = 0.002; 95% CI: 0.35, 1.61; I2 = 98%), and for
the remaining 7 comparisons, there was evidence of a small
significant effect (SMD: 0.20; P = 0.003; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39; I2 =
86%).
The relatively small number of comparisons in many sub-
groups and the large amount of heterogeneity indicated that
caution is required when interpreting the results of these ex-
ploratory subgroup analyses. Meaningful subgroup analyses that
were based on pertinent participant characteristics were not
possible in the current article because of the lack of availability of
clearly demarked participant data across weight status, age, or sex
in the published studies.
Publication bias
A visual inspection of funnel plots showed evidence of
asymmetry. We formally examined publication bias with the use
of Egger’s test (41) in which the standard normal deviate (SMD/
SE SMD) is regressed against the estimate’s precision (inverse
of the SE). The Egger’s test P value was 0.06, which suggested
evidence of asymmetry that could have been attributable to
publication bias. Although these results should be interpreted
with caution because of the substantial heterogeneity between
studies that may have contributed to this result (48), we also
performed a trim-and-fill analysis (42) to further explore the
potential bias. This method showed no evidence of missing
studies.
DISCUSSION
We conducted a systematic review (22 articles) and meta-
analysis (18 articles, which contributed 20 effect sizes) of studies
that experimentally manipulated advertising exposure (unhealthy
food compared with a control) and measured concurrent or
subsequent food intake. The meta-analysis, which was based on
FIGURE 2
Forest plot of subgroup analysis by age of participant (adult and children). An IV meta-analysis with the use of an SMD was used. I2 is an
indicator of between-comparison heterogeneity. IV, inverse variance; SMD, standardized mean difference.

 all available study data, showed that the difference in food
consumption was significant with a small-to-moderate magnitude
of effect in the direction of increased intake after exposure to
unhealthy food advertising than to the control. Subgroup analyses
suggested that, although acute experimental exposure to food
advertising did not increase food intake in adults, in children,
there was a significant effect of a moderate magnitude.
There are 3 important considerations for interpreting this
information. First, small effects at an individual level can have
huge impacts across populations (49) because almost all children
in Westernized societies are exposed to large amounts of un-
healthy food advertising. Second, the current global escalation in
obesity prevalence is the result of only relatively small but cu-
mulative increases in absolute energy intake at the individual
level (50). Third, the assessed studies examined responses to
acute advertising exposure only. The collective effects of con-
tinued exposure to food marketing that occurs in real life and over
a lifetime may lead to an amplification of these effects, partic-
ularly when the marketing is repetitious and delivered over
multiple platforms and in many settings. Because of these
findings, we argue that recommendations for enacting environ-
mental strategies (4) and policy options (10) to reduce children’s
exposure to food advertising are evidence based and warranted.
The effect that food advertising exposure has on food con-
sumption in children appears highly variable. The meta-analysis
showed high heterogeneity across studies. Exploratory subgroup
analyses indicated that differences in study designs may have
contributed to this variability. For example, we showed larger
effect sizes for studies that used within-subjects than between-
subjects designs. It is plausible that this difference was related to
demand characteristics (the notion of participants being aware of
what the researcher is trying to investigate or anticipates finding
and what this awareness implies for how participants may be
expected to behave) that influenced the results of within-subjects
studies. However, all such studies with children enforced either
a 2-wk or 1-mo washout period between conditions to minimize
the likelihood of participants being able to accurately recall their
eating behaviors at the previous test session. It was not possible to
explore other methodologic factors in separate analyses (e.g., the
duration of advertising exposure and eating opportunity), but
these factors were also likely to be important considerations that
could have affected the findings. Participant characteristics (e.g.,
weight status, age, and sex) may also explain some of the var-
iability. For example, there was notable variability in children’s
ages in the included studies (ranging from 5 to 12 y old) which
could have affected both the children’s susceptibility to adver-
tising and their likelihood of conforming to socially desirable
responses. However, we were unable to explore this aspect with
the use of the subgroup analysis because of insufficiently de-
marked participant data across these factors. There is a need for
greater methodologic and reporting consistency across research
studies with consideration given to defining individual groups
who may show particular vulnerability [e.g., individuals who are
already overweight or obese, which was shown to substantially
affect the food intake response in Halford et al. (26)]. Increased
consistency of the experimental design and approach would
ensure that the resulting evidence base would show a clear,
replicable, and reliable effect for the purposes of informing
appropriate policy action. However, it may also be useful and
policy relevant to systematically explore the impact of these
methodologic variations on outcomes (e.g., to establish whether
a dose-response relation exists, or whether varying the food
offered and its presentation may affect findings).
The findings of the current article are consistent with previous
narrative reviews that have concluded that food advertising ex-
posure has an effect on children’s eating. A narrative review of
studies of adult participants showed insufficient evidence to
draw conclusions (17); our findings concur with this result. To
our knowledge, only 7 published studies have focused on adult
intake responses to acute advertising exposure, and thus, it is
clear that more research is needed. In addition, it is reasonable to
speculate that the lack of an effect shown in the few existing
studies may have been due to several factors. One such factor
may have been the greater cognitive ability of adults to be
critical viewers of advertising. It has long been suggested that
young children may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of
marketing because they are unable to understand its selling or
persuasive intent (4). Although older children may develop these
skills, they do not necessarily use them (4). Similarly, although
adults are likely to possess these skills, whether they are rou-
tinely activated during advertising exposure remains to be elu-
cidated. Future studies should address this issue.
In addition, studies with children tended to be conducted in
more-naturalistic settings (e.g., school environments), whereas
adults participated in the laboratory. It may be that the adult
participants were more aware of their eating behaviors in such
a scenario than they would have been otherwise (51, 52); this
possibility is important because it has previously been shown
that, although the effect of a portion size on intake is widespread
and robust, it is weaker in contexts in which more attention is
given to the food being eaten (53). It may also be that the ex-
perimental aims were insufficiently disguised; evidence of at-
tempts to mask the true purpose of the experiment was given in
some studies (e.g., reference 27) but not in other studies. It would
be useful to directly examine whether demand characteristic
contribute to the lack of effects seen in adult studies that explored
the impact of acute experimental advertising exposure on food
intake.
Although studies of adult participants showed substantially
less heterogeneity of an effect size than did studies with children,
a notable methodologic variation was still apparent. For example,
articles reported the extent of advertising exposure as either the
number of television advertisements (advertisements may have
been of varying length), the duration of exposure, or simply that
a series of advertisements were presented, and thus, direct
comparisons are difficult. Although the majority of studies
reported having exposed participants to 5–10 food advertise-
ments in the experimental condition or group (e.g., references
27, 28, 31), others studies used as few as 2 advertisements (43)
or 4 advertisements (45). In addition, although some studies
offered participants a single snack-food item (47), other studies
offered a 16-item buffet meal (28). Greater consistency in such
methodologic considerations is required to aid the interpretation
of findings.
To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis of the
effect of food advertising exposure on food intake. The current
article shows that, with the use of all available data to date, acute
exposure to experimental food advertising significantly increases
subsequent food intake in children. This finding provides strong
evidence to support immediate policy action in this area. There

 remains a need for future research to particularly show the effects
of sustained or longer-term exposures to food advertising and to
test whether the observed increases in intake after acute expo-
sures are not later compensated for and, therefore, could lead to
weight gain over time (54).
The current meta-analysis had limitations. Four articles were
not included in our quantitative synthesis because they lacked the
required data. However, because of the moderate effect sizes
shown, it was unlikely that the addition of the 4 studies (of which
2 studies showed a significant effect of food advertising pro-
moting greater intake overall, and an additional study showed this
effect in overweight and obese girls) would have changed the
overall conclusions.
In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis pro-
vide evidence that acute exposure to unhealthy food advertise-
ments increases food intake in children. Policymakers should
take these findings into account and target policy action to reduce
children’s exposure to advertising of unhealthy foods.

from Bristol-Myers Squibb for pharmacotherapy research. JCGH receives
funding into research on appetite regulation from the food and pharmaceu-
tical sectors. Current projects include a study on nonnutritive sweeteners
from the American Beverage Association (details of the trial will be sub-
mitted shortly to clinicaltrials.gov) and a drug-treatment trial funded by
Bristol-Myers Squibb. JCGH has no industry links to policy work, and al
consultancy money is paid to the University of Liverpool to support research.
ER’s research has been supported by the Wellcome Trust, and he is part of
a research team that has received research funding from the American Bev-
erage Association for a study to examine the effect of nonnutritive sweetened
beverages on weight management. None of these funding sources contrib-
uted to the current research or the views expressed in this article. SN, BK,
CT-S, and AJ reported no conflicts of interest related to the study.
