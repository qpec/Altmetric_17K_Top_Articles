Background. White matter damage (WMD) is a prime risk factor for cerebral palsy, in part occurring unexplained. Tough
primarily a problem of preterm infants, there is growing evidence that in large newborns cephalopelvic disproportion and
prolonged labor are involved. Objective. To explore both incidence of and morphometric risk factors for WMD in term-born
infants. Study Design. We related growth variables and risk factors of term-born infants to WMD (61/4,725) using odds ratios of
z-score bands. Results. Te key result is the novel observation that head circumference is a prime and unique index for WMD in term-
born neonates over the whole range of centiles (U-shaped; WMD (%) � 3.1168–0.12797∗HC (centile) + 0.0014741∗HC2;
p < 0.0001). Tis suggests diferent mechanisms for WMD in the lowest and highest z-score band. In the latter, cephalic pressure
gradients and prolonged labor with preserved neonatal vitality prevail, whereas in the previous one, acute and chronic oxygen
deprivation with reduced vitality predominate. Conclusions. Te fact that seemingly healthy term-born neonates are not screened
by head imaging, in spite of both large head circumference and prolonged labor, is considered to be the missing link between the
insult that escapes diagnosis and the development of unexplained developmental delay and cerebral palsy in childhood.

1. Introduction
White matter damage (WMD) is a prime risk factor for
cerebral palsy, the most common disability in childhood for
which there is no cure at present beyond supportive and
occupational care [1, 2]. It is believed that white matter
damage is primarily a problem of preterm infants if, for
example, periventricular leukomalacia occurs [3]. However,
a large cranial ultrasound screening study revealed that
a substantial fraction of cases presenting white matter
damage (34%–39%) is to be expected in infants born near
term [4]. While the etiology of white matter damage in
preterm infants is largely related to circulatory changes, for
example, systemic hypotension during and/or after as-
phyxia, and infection, the etiology in term-born infants is
less well understood [1, 2]. Tough similar mechanisms
may apply for preterm and term infants, there is growing
evidence that, in large newborns, mechanical problems
during delivery resulting in excessive molding and de-
pression of the skull may be involved and perhaps account
for unexplained cases of developmental delay or cerebral
palsy, despite preserved vitality at birth, as recently observed
[5–7]. Tis led us to evaluate the data from our prospective
cranial ultrasound screening study to relate growth variables
of term-born infants at birth to white matter damage ob-
served [4]. In this neonatal ultrasound screening study that is
the only available trial in which cranial abnormalities were
assessed across the whole range of gestational ages (24–43
weeks gestation), the overall incidence of WMD was 0.02%,
0.02%, and 2.6% for periventricular leukomalacia, por-
encephaly (cystic periventricular leukomalacia), and en-
larged lateral ventricles, respectively [4]; however, only cerebral
hemorrhage but not WMD was evaluated. We considered
a reevaluation of this prospective database mandatory to

 improve current clinical management of large term-born in-
fants by proposing generous use of cranial imaging after birth
because, recently, curative treatments of WMD and cerebral
palsy by autologous cord blood stem cells have become
available that are most efective when given early after the
insult [6, 8]. Furthermore, we wished to discuss the possibility
if WMD escaping diagnosis in large term-born infants may
perhaps explain in part hitherto unexplained cases of de-
velopmental delay and cerebral palsy in childhood. Tis is of
growing importance because neither the general problem of
large newborns, prolonged labor, and cephalopelvic dispro-
portion nor the principles of clinical management have
changed signifcantly over the years, but the prevalence has
increased dramatically and, unlike previously, a therapeutic
option for neonatal WMD has become available [6].
2. Materials and Methods
From January 1, 1984, to December 31, 1988, a prospective
cranial ultrasound screening study was carried out on all live-
born infants on the day of discharge of the mother (5–8 days
postpartum) from the Department of Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology at the University of Giessen [4]. Since the time of
collection of the data, the technical procedure of cranial ul-
trasound in newborns and the interpretation of abnormalities
have not changed signifcantly. Infants who had to be
transferred to the children’s hospital directly postpartum were
screened on the neonatal ward. Te screening examinations
were performed in a single- (investigator-) blinded manner
with no access to clinical data by two experienced pediatric
radiologists (consultants) only. In case of abnormalities,
cranial ultrasound was repeated on a daily basis if required to
establish the diagnosis. Te protocol was approved by the
relevant institutional review board, and neonatal cranial ul-
trasound was introduced as standard of care. After consent of
the mothers, a total of 4,725 term-born neonates (37–43
weeks gestation) were prospectively included in the cranial
ultrasound screening, that is, >91% of all term-born infants in
that period. All relevant obstetrical data including growth
variables and risk factors derived from the birth records were
encoded and entered into a database for evaluation.
2.1. Cranial Ultrasound. Sonographic examination of the
brain was performed on postnatal day 1–30 (median 8 days)
through the anterior fontanel in coronal and sagittal sections
as previously described [4, 9]. Briefy, high-resolution sector
transducers (Siemens Sonoline SL (1984), 5 MHz, Siemens
Model RA1 (1980), 7.5 MHz) were used. Te coronal section
plane ran along the level of the interventricular foramina
(Monro) through the lateral ventricle and the third ventricle
so that asymmetrical fndings such as one-sided lateral
ventricle enlargement with or without displacement of the
interhemispheric fssure could be diagnosed easily. Sono-
graphically, white matter damage presents as focal or difuse
echodensities, echolucent cysts (porencephaly) in the brain
parenchyma, and/or enlarged lateral ventricles [2]. Specifc
criteria for physiologic and pathologic enlargement of the
lateral ventricles, as assessed by diameter, cross-sectional
area, and shape, have been developed for this trial in a pilot
on 205 clinically unremarkable newborns as described
earlier [9]. Pathologic ventricular enlargements were di-
agnosed threefold, frstly, at and beyond the threshold width
of 10 mm in diameter of the lateral ventricle and, secondly,
beyond a threshold cross-sectional area of 0.28 cm2. Tirdly,
to distinguish between physiologic variants (1 � sharp lateral
angle, 2 � concave bottom, and 3 � smooth inner lining,
i.e., coding “0” in Table 1) and pathologic variants
(1 � blunt/obtuse lateral angle, 2 � convexly shaped bottom,
and 3� irregular inner lining, i.e., coding “1” in Table 1) of mild
ventricular enlargements, for example, caused by asphyxic
and/or hemorrhagic events, the shape of the ventricles was
evaluated following the criteria (1–3) depicted in Figure 1. No
attempt was made to assess grey matter. Te various forms of
white matter damage, including “lateral ventricle asymmetry,”
“lateral ventricle enlargement,” “lateral ventricle bilateral en-
largement” (defned as an enlargement of the lateral ventricle
without ventricular asymmetry), “posthemorrhagic hydro-
cephalus,” “difuse periventricular leukomalacia,” and “cystic
periventricular leukomalacia (porencephaly)” as observed in
individual patients (n� 61) are listed in Table 1.
2.2. Growth Variables and Morphometric Index (MMI). Growth
variables of term-born infants at birth were related to WMD
in that z-scores of weight (W), length (L), head circumference
(HC), and weight-length ratio (W/L) were calculated, and
signifcant relations were demonstrated between z-score bands
as compared with the reference, being particularly close for
HC (Table 2). In an efort to improve the risk assessment as
part of the clinical management and risk-adapted use of brain
imaging techniques, we propose a morphometric index (MMI)
that refects best the white matter damage risk patterns of
growth variables (centile), including W, L, HC, W/L, and the
HC parabola. We averaged the z-scores to calculate the MMI
as follows: MMI � (z-scoreW (centile) + z-scoreL (centile)
+ z-scoreHC (centile) + z-scoreWeight/Length-ratio (centile)
+ z-score (3.1168–0.12797∗HC (centile) + 0.0014741∗HC2
(centile)))/5. Te reference for z-score evaluation for lower
(centiles <10% and 10 to <25%) and higher (centiles 75 to
<90% and ≥90%) bands in each of the growth variables and
the MMI was the reference z-score value established for the
25 to <75% centile.
2.3. Statistical Analysis. Results are presented as means +/−
standard deviation (SD). Quantitative and qualitative vari-
ables were compared using the chi-square test for contin-
gency tables and ANOVA (using Games–Howell posthoc
test to account for multiple comparisons and Welch test for
unequal variances) to assess diferences in proportions be-
tween groups. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated as quan-
titative measures of the association of white matter damage
with given anthropomorphic z-score bands, using z-scores
between −0.67 SD and <0.67 SD (25% to <75%) centile as
reference (statistical program: SPSS-24, IBM Corporation,
NY, USA). Tis level was chosen based upon exploratory
analysis

 showing that this z-score band on average had the lowest risk
for white matter damage. Te analyses were performed in the
total term-born population (n � 4,725). Te relation between
head circumference (centile) and the risk for white matter
damage (%) was expressed by a 2nd degree polynomial
(parabola) curve ft.
3. Results
Of 5,799 live-born babies delivered between 1984 and 1988,
5,286 (91.1%) neonates (51.1% male and 48.9% female) un-
derwent cranial ultrasound screening. Of these, 4,725 term-
born neonates (including twins) were evaluated (50.8% male
and 49.2% female), in 61 (100%) of which white matter
damage (WMD) was detected (lateral ventricle enlargement
(n � 57/61; 93%), lateral ventricle asymmetry (n � 29/61; 48%),
bilateral enlargement of the lateral ventricle (n � 29/61; 48%),
posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (n � 3/61; 5%), difuse
periventricular leukomalacia (n � 2/61; 3%), cystic periven-
tricular leukomalacia (porencephaly) (n � 0/61; 0%)) (Table 1)
with no gender-related diferences in the overall rate of white
matter damage (male 1.4% versus female 1.2%, n.s.).
Te odds ratios (OR) for the quantifcation of the as-
sociation between growth variables, weight-length ratio,
ponderal index, and morphometric index (MMI) of the
neonates and white matter damage, according to the centiles
of the z-score bands, are given in Table 2. Among all term-
born neonates, those with the lowest birth weight, length,
and head circumference z-scores were at increased risk of
white matter damage compared with the reference group.
Interestingly, only head circumference showed a close re-
lation to the risk of white matter damage over all z-score
bands in that the odds ratios were signifcantly diferent in
the <10%, 10 to <25%, 75 to <90%, and ≥90% z-score bands
as compared with the reference (25 to <75%). Tis tight
U-shaped
correlation
(parabola,
r � 0.957,
p < 0.0001)
(Figure 2) between risk for white matter damage (%) and the
centiles of head circumference (HC), presenting 2.5, 1.3, 0.4,
2.6, and 4.3% WMD at <10%, 10 to <25%, 25 to <75%, 75 to
<90%, and ≥90%, respectively, is of major clinical signif-
cance. Tis unique relation follows the equation (HC-WMD
risk formula): WMD (%) � 3.1168–0.12797∗HC (centile) +
0.0014741∗HC2 (centile) and suggests diferent mechanisms
for white matter damage in the lowest and highest z-score
band, respectively (Figure 2), because in the latter, me-
chanical pressure gradients along with cephalopelvic dis-
proportion may be involved (Tables 3 and 4). Since, unlike
<10% centile, male neonates (347/472 (74%)) signifcantly
outnumber females (124/472 (26%)) in the head circumfer-
ence z-score band ≥90%, in which the risk of white matter
damage is high (Table 3), this gender change in proportion
might unravel in part as to why cerebral palsy is more
prevalent in male than in female children, an unexplained
phenomenon hitherto.
From all anthropomorphic indices combining vari-
ous growth variables at birth, our morphometric index
(including growth variables, weight/length ratio, and
HC-WMD risk formula) proved to refect best the risk for
white matter damage (%) in both lowest and highest z-score
bands as compared with head circumference (Table 2).

 Furthermore, the MMI, which is closely correlated to HC
(MMI � 0.692∗HC (z-score), r � 0.851, p < 0.001, n � 4,724),
clearly identifed the principal risk factor of WMD in large
newborns, that is, unlike in lower z-score bands, pro-
longed or obstructed labor indicating potential cephalopelvic
disproportion was signifcantly increased in the higher
MMI z-score bands (p < 0.001) (Table 3). It is of note that,
in the present study, the ponderal index (100∗W/L3), unlike
the weight-length ratio (W/L), does not bear any relation to
the risk of white matter damage in term-born neonates.
Te obstetrical variables and potential risk factors as-
sociated with signifcant changes in z-score bands of the
morphometric index as compared with the reference (25 to
<75%) are displayed in Tables 3–5. Interestingly, gender
proportion changed towards male newborns in higher
z-score bands >75% in which, conceivingly, the rate of
prolonged or obstructed labor, stained amniotic fuid, and
pCO2 in umbilical arterial blood were also increased.
However, variables associated with chronic lack of oxygen and
acute asphyxia, for example, growth retardation, pathologic
cardiotocography, reduced Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 min-
utes, reduced umbilical arterial blood pH, and increased base
excess were signifcantly more frequent in the <10% z-score
band along with the number of multiples (largely twins) and
presentations other than vertex lies (Table 4). Te number of
patients and means (SD) of weeks gestation along with growth
variables within the MMI <10%, 10 to <25%, 75 to <90%, and
≥90% z-score bands (centile) as compared with the ref-
erence (25 to <75%) are given in Table 5.
Unlike the risk for white matter damage that was sig-
nifcantly increased in the z-score bands <10% and >90%,
as was gestosis (Table 3), there were no relations between
z-score bands of the morphometric index and intra/
periventricular hemorrhages, neither overall (IVH/PIVH
grade I/II–grade IV) nor individually as grade I/II, grade
III, or grade IV. Te same holds true for premature rupture
of membranes (PROM), bleeding during pregnancy,
chorioamnionitis, hypertension or hypotension, and the

the increased risk of white matter damage <10% and ≥90% centiles and is calculated as follows: MMI � (z-scoreWeight (centile) + z-scoreLength (centile) + z-scoreHC (centile)

 number of miscarriages (data not shown). Interestingly,
maternal fever >38°C during delivery (35/4,725), a prime
risk factor for brain damage in preterms [1, 4], did not
increase the risk for white matter damage in term-born
neonates (data not shown), suggesting a distinct suscep-
tibility of the white matter to infammation in term as
compared with preterm neonates.
From all term-born infants presenting WMD, 38%
(23/61) had to be transferred to the neonatal intensive care
unit due to perinatal asphyxia as evidenced by lower Apgar
scores at one (6.6 (2.5) versus 8.7 (1.1), p < 0.001), fve
(8.2 (2.0) versus 9.8 (0.6), p < 0.002), and 10 minutes
(8.9 (1.8) versus 9.9 (0.4), p < 0.02) as compared with infants
not
transferred
(38/61).
Interestingly,
the
transferred
symptomatic infants had a lower weight (3,002 (773) grams
versus 3,380 (566) grams, p < 0.05) and length (49.3 (4.2) cm
versus 51.3 (2.5) cm, p < 0.05) at birth as well as evidence for
growth retardation as the weight/length ratio was signif-
cantly reduced (60.0 (11.6) versus 65.6 (8.9), p < 0.05). Tis
favours the view that almost two-thirds (62%) of the term-
born infants presenting WMD are large and clinically un-
remarkable and hence escape routine diagnosis because they
are seemingly healthy with normal Apgar scores, thus
lacking reasons for transferral. Tere were no diferences
between groups as far as mode of delivery is concerned.
4. Discussion
Tis is the frst cranial ultrasound screening study for WMD in
term-born infants and though the data were collected in the
years 1984–1988, the fact that seemingly healthy large newborns
escape diagnosis of WMD is of utmost actuality given the rising
prevalence of maternal obesity and fetal macrosomia [10]. Te
new fnding that, in an unselected cohort, 1.3% term neonates
present WMD was only possible by screening all term-born
infants at postnatal day 1–30 because most of the afected
infants (62%) are asymptomatic. Importantly, early diagnosis of
WMD in these asymptomatic large newborns would improve
outcome by maximising the beneft of early intervention, either
by timely active (neuro)rehabilitation or by future curative
treatment options for WMD using autologous cord blood stem
cells that presently are being developed [6, 8, 11].
Te cranial ultrasound observation period of 1–30
postnatal days, including follow-up examinations until di-
agnosis was established, is sufcient to identify WMD with
reasonable certainty as demonstrated by brain MRI at
a median of 14 days after birth (range 1–60) in a cohort of
symptomatic term-born infants in which abnormal T2WI
appearance in the white matter (detected in 14% of the cases)
was correlated to low Apgar scores at birth, suggesting near
birth insults, and severe neurodevelopmental disabilities at
12 months of age [12].
Te key result of our study is the novel observation that
head circumference at birth is a prime and unique index for
increased risk of white matter damage in term-born neo-
nates over the whole range of growth centiles in a U-shaped
manner (Table 2, Figure 2). Tis is an important fnding
because unlike babies born sick below the 10% centile of
growth variables, clinically unremarkable neonates beyond
the 75% centile presenting full vitality are usually not ex-
amined by imaging of the head and hence escape diagnosis
of brain damage with potentially severe consequences for the
patients and their families. In particular, since curative
treatment options are actually being tested and in part
proved to be promising, it is important to establish diagnosis
of tentative neonatal brain damage as early as possible to take
either full advantage of these treatments or at least start
physiotherapy and occupational therapy early [11, 13, 14].
Interestingly, Dahlseng and coworkers investigating
growth variables in relation to cerebral palsy in a large
epidemiologic study also observed a U-shaped relation for
head circumference in the lowest (p < 0.001) and highest
z-score bands (p < 0.003) and “total cerebral palsy” (n � 398),
the group encompassing all subtypes, thus lending strong
support to our fnding regarding the relation between head
circumference and white matter damage in term-born neo-
nates [15]. Tese authors interpret their epidemiologic fnd-
ings (in the absence of vitality data, e.g., Apgar scores) by
proposing a role for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in
large newborns (≥37 weeks’ gestation) as a potential cause for
cerebral palsy in childhood, particularly in the subtypes of
quadriplegic and dyskinetic cerebral palsy. However, we
present evidence based on complete clinical data that this
pathomechanism causing white matter damage is much more
likely to occur in the lowest growth curve centiles (<10%) in
which growth retardation and asphyxia prevail (Tables 2,
3–5), whereas white matter damage in large newborns with
a head circumference >75% centile occurred in the absence of
signs of asphyxia. Our follow-up study in a matched pair
design showed that white matter damage is the major

0.12797∗HC (centile)+0.0014741∗HC2 (centile) (r � 0.957, p < 0.0001).
Interestingly, from all growth variables at birth, only head circum-
ference showed a close relation to the risk of white matter damage over
the whole range of centiles (Table 2).

Terefore, our fndings may elucidate the phenomenon of
unexplained cases of developmental delay and cerebral palsy in
the pediatric population on the basis of mechanical constraints
and pressure gradients squeezing the skull and brain during
parturition when a cephalopelvic disproportion is present
[6, 7]. Tus, white matter damage in a seemingly healthy
population of largely male term-born neonates based on large
head circumference appears to be the missing link between the
insult that escapes diagnosis and the development of un-
explained developmental delay and cerebral palsy in childhood
[7, 17]. It is to be hoped that this fnding will contribute to
prevent in part white matter damage in the future by
appropriate obstetrical management of babies presenting large
head circumference or, if this is not possible, by early imaging
diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.
Te vast majority of white matter damage detected in
this trial was related to enlarged lateral ventricles (93%),
either unilateral or bilateral, refecting subependymal loss of
white matter in the periventricular region close to the in-
ternal capsule where corticospinal tracts pass (Table 1). We
have ascertained that physiologic mild enlargements are
identifed and distinguished from pathologic mild en-
largements of the lateral ventricles in three ways during
a pilot on 205 unremarkable newborns using specifc criteria
for pathology (Figure 1). We determined the ventricular
width, the cross-sectional area, and the shape of the ventricle
in
coronal
section
planes
running
through
the
in-
terventricular foramina to avoid detection of “focal” and/or
physiologic enlargements that have been observed in up to
21% of appropriate for gestational age control newborns at

 the age of 15 years using MRI [18]. However, these authors
used control newborns who were large for gestational age
(many of them >90% centile), weighing 3,707 (SD 495)
grams which is on average 327 grams more than in those
seemingly healthy newborns with large head circumferences
(>75% centile) that contracted white matter damage in
the present study. Interestingly, Skranes and coworkers
[18] were unable to detect signifcant MRI diferences in
mild ventricular dilatation between small for gestational
age term-born infants (n � 5/10) and the control group
(n � 8/14). According to our observations, the likelihood is
that the 21% mild ventricular dilatations observed in the
“control group” do not constitute a common (“normal”)
fnding. Rather, they might in part be due to white matter
damage in the “control group” based on problems arising
from both high birth weights and large head circum-
ference > 90% centile of the newborns that were seemingly
healthy and chosen as controls [18].
We present evidence that the mechanisms involved in
the development of white matter damage in the lowest and
highest head circumference centiles may be fundamentally
diferent in that chronic and acute oxygen deprivation,
reduced Apgar scores, umbilical arterial pH, and pathologic
heart rate pattern play a major part below the 10% centile,
whereas prolonged or obstructed labor and mechanical
constraints may be the major determinants of white matter
damage beyond the 90% centile (Tables 3–5). Te fact that
these infants present full vitality as assessed by normal Apgar
scores, acid-base balance, and heart rate pattern obscures the
excessive risk for white matter damage in these newborns.
Tough cephalic molding has not been evaluated in this
study, the likelihood is that molding was present in these
babies with large head circumference because the functional
capacity of the pelvis inlet may have been inadequate to
allow the fetus to negotiate the birth canal due to cepha-
lopelvic

 increased odds ratios for prolonged or obstructed labor
(p < 0.001) beyond 75% centile z-score bands of the
morphometric index (Table 3). Terefore, after prolonged
labor, a general screening for brain damage in newborns
presenting excessive molding of the skull has recently been
advocated [6]. Furthermore, we propose that prospective
risk management should routinely include sonographic
monitoring of head circumference rather than biparietal
diameter during late pregnancy, though perhaps technically
difcult, to prevent prolonged labor and hence increased risk
for white matter damage in babies beyond 75% centile. Tis
seems important because prediction of term infants born
large for gestational age, that is, >90% centile, at an earlier
stage of gestation using ultrasound and biomarkers have
proved to be inefective [19].
To propose a clinically useful morphometric index
(MMI) to easily calculate the risk for white matter damage at
given centiles of growth variables, we entered the z-scores of
W, L, HC, and the 2nd degree polynomial for HC as well as
that of the weight-length ratio into the equation. Tis
combines the advantage of a close relationship between
growth variables, particularly head circumference, and odds
ratios for white matter damage and the efects of growth
retardation on the risk for white matter damage. As shown in
Table 2, the provided MMI refects the signifcantly in-
creased risk for white matter damage in the lowest as well as
in the highest centiles. Tus, by using MMI for white matter
damage assessment, unremarkable term-born infants pre-
senting a MMI >90% and <10% centile now can be selected
for head imaging as a standard of care to provide a cost-
efective basis for potentially curative treatments such as
autologous cord blood mononuclear cells that recently have
been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of
white matter damage in newborns from the European
Medicinal Agency (EMA) [8, 20].
Growth variables like ponderal index and weight-length
ratio are commonly used in clinical practice to assess
neonatal risk. However, these indices spare the head cir-
cumference. Unlike the weight-length ratio, the ponderal
index in term-born infants is the only index of all calculated
growth variables in the present study that lacked any relation
to white matter damage. Tis is in part at variance to
a recent publication on the efects of suboptimal in-
trauterine environment on late-life cognitive function, in
which a lower ponderal index at birth was signifcantly
associated with smaller volumes of total brain and white
matter determined by MRI at 75 years of age [21]. Fur-
thermore, in a study on growth variables in relation to
cerebral palsy, ponderal index bore some relation to the
increased risk of cerebral palsy that was confrmed when
the children were 4 years of age [15].
Finally, from an evolutionary point of view, it is evident
that the upright gait and hence the prominent promontory
along with growing brain volume and general growth ac-
celeration will aggravate the problem of cephalopelvic dis-
proportion and will lead to increased caesarean section rates
in the highest z-score bands of head circumference in the
future to prevent white matter damage. Tis counter-
evolutionary process is self-serving because serendipitously
the natural selection pressure is being omitted by modern
perinatal medicine.
