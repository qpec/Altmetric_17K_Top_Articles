Diagnosis marks the beginning of any successful therapy. Because many medical conditions progress asymptom-
atically over extended periods of time, their timely diagnosis remains difficult, and this adversely affects patient 
prognosis. Focusing on hypercalcemia associated with cancer, we aimed to develop a synthetic biology-inspired 
biomedical tattoo using engineered cells that would (i) monitor long-term blood calcium concentration, (ii) detect 
onset of mild hypercalcemia, and (iii) respond via subcutaneous accumulation of the black pigment melanin to 
form a visible tattoo. For this purpose, we designed cells containing an ectopically expressed calcium-sensing 
receptor rewired to a synthetic signaling cascade that activates expression of transgenic tyrosinase, which pro-
duces melanin in response to persistently increased blood Ca2+. We confirmed that the melanin-generated color 
change produced by this biomedical tattoo could be detected with the naked eye and optically quantified. The 
system was validated in wild-type mice bearing subcutaneously implanted encapsulated engineered cells. All 
animals inoculated with hypercalcemic breast and colon adenocarcinoma cells developed tattoos, whereas no 
tattoos were seen in animals inoculated with normocalcemic tumor cells. All tumor-bearing animals remained 
asymptomatic throughout the 38-day experimental period. Although hypercalcemia is also associated with other 
pathologies, our findings demonstrate that it is possible to detect hypercalcemia associated with cancer in mu-
rine models using this cell-based diagnostic strategy.
INTRODUCTION
Classically, medical treatment begins with diagnosis after the devel-
opment of subjective symptoms, but this may be too late for the most 
effective therapy. There is increasing interest in proactive measures 
to prevent disease, such as raising awareness, encouraging regular 
medical checkups, screening and monitoring individuals based on 
family history, risk, or environmental factors, and changing lifestyle 
(1). Personalized, next-generation medicine requires smart diagnostic 
devices suitable for long-term monitoring of disease-related metab-
olites and biomarkers to detect the onset or recurrence of pathological 
conditions at the earliest possible stage and thereby optimize prognosis 
and treatment success (2).
Among potential targets for such devices, cancer is considered a 
global health priority, with more than 14 million new cases per year, 
and accounting for about 15% of all deaths (3). It is well established 
that detection of asymptomatic cancer can markedly improve the prog-
nosis (4). Many cancers such as breast cancer (5), colon cancer, prostate 
cancer (6), lung cancer (7), and gastrointestinal (8) and hematological 
malignancies (9) are associated with hypercalcemia. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that monitoring blood calcium concentration could be a 
suitable strategy to detect these types of cancer at an asymptomatic stage.
Calcium is required by all living cells to maintain normal structure 
and function (10). Its role as a second messenger in signal transduc-
tion, managing physiological functions associated with cell prolifera-
tion and apoptosis as well as differentiation, cell adhesion, and motility, 
has been extensively studied (11), but its role as a first messenger in 
the development of cancer has only recently been uncovered (12). In 
humans, calcium is stored in bone as mineralized hydroxyapatite and 
is present in blood, either as free Ca2+ or bound to various carriers 
such as albumin (13). Calcium homeostasis is precisely regulated and 
restored within minutes after fluctuations by several hormonal systems 
(14). For example, a decrease in blood calcium concentration stimu-
lates parathyroid glands to release parathyroid hormone (PTH), which 
promotes calcium reabsorption and mobilization from bone. On the 
other hand, increasing blood Ca2+ concentrations activate the calcium- 
sensing receptor (CaSR), which acutely inhibits the secretion of PTH 
(15). Cancer is among the causes of hypercalcemia (16), and humoral 
hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with a variety of cancers, 
including breast (5, 16), colon (16), prostate (7), lung (17), and kidney 
cancers (18). It arises because the primary tumor, its metastases, or im-
mune cells targeting the tumor secrete humoral factors (16) that act 
on bone, kidney, and intestine, thereby disrupting calcium homeostasis 
and resulting in increased blood-calcium concentration (19).
CaSR is a natural hypercalcemia sensor that is sufficiently sensi-
tive to detect mild to moderate hypercalcemia (5.6 to 10 mg Ca2+/dl 
blood), which often remains unnoticed when a patient is asymptomatic 
(13, 16) or shows only nonspecific symptoms such as anorexia, anxiety, 
and weakness (18, 20). Therefore, we considered that CaSR might be 
suitable for detection of cancer at an early (asymptomatic) stage. Here, 
we engineered cells to ectopically express CaSR rewired to a synthetic 
signaling cascade, leading to expression of tyrosinase, which synthesizes 
the black pigment melanin. We anticipated that the resulting accu-
mulation of melanin by the subcutaneously implanted engineered cells 
would produce a visible tattoo, thus enabling detection of hypercalce-
mia associated with asymptomatic cancer. Here, we describe the design 
and construction of the engineered cells and validate the biomedical 
tattoo system in wild-type mice bearing subcutaneously implanted en-
capsulated engineered cells and inoculated with carcinoma cells.

biosensor monitoring blood-calcium concentrations and a chimeric 
hypercalcemia-sensitive biosensor-dependent promoter driving ex-
pression of a pigment-producing enzyme that generates a visible skin 
tattoo (Fig. 1A). The human CaSR, a class C group G protein–coupled 
receptor (GPCR) managing calcium ho 
 
meostasis in humans (21), 
serves as the hypercalcemia biosensor (Fig. 1A). Hypercalcemia- 
mediated activation of CaSR triggers the cell’s endogenous calcium- 
calmodulin-calcineurin-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) 
and Raf–ERK1/2 (extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 and 2)–
SRE (serum response element) signaling cascades, which induce a 
synthetic calcium-sensitive promoter (PCa) driving expression of 
copper- 
containing human tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in 
the synthesis of the black pigment melanin (Fig. 1A) (22). Thus, per-
sistent hypercalcemia is recorded as an accumulation of melanin in 
subcutaneously implanted engineered cells and visualized as a black 
skin tattoo.
To test the sensitivity of CaSR to hypercalcemia, we cotransfected 
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with the constitutive CaSR 
expression vector pAT12 (PhCMV-CaSR-pA) as well as pAT16 (PCa4-
SEAP-pA) encoding the human model glycoprotein SEAP (human 
placental secreted alkaline phosphatase) under control of a synthetic 
CaSR-dependent Ca2+-sensitive promoter (PCa4) containing three 
SRE and six NFAT operator modules 5ʹ of a minimal version of the hu-
man cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (PhCMVmin) (table S1). 
Exposing the cultures to increasing Ca2+ concentrations showed that 
these engineered human cells expressed more SEAP under mild hy-
percalcemia (>1.5 mM Ca2+) compared to control populations that were 
only transfected with the reporter construct pAT16 (PCa4-SEAP-pA) 
(Fig. 1B).
To improve the sensitivity and dynamics of the synthetic hypercal-
cemia sensor, we constructed an optimized synthetic Ca2+-sensitive 
promoter (PCa6) by linking 3 SRE and 15 NFAT operator modules 
5ʹ of a minimal version of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter 
(PMHCmin) (pAT50, PCa6-SEAP-pA). HEK-293 cells cotransfected 
with pAT12 and pAT50 showed substantially improved Ca2+ respon-
siveness compared to the original pAT12/pAT16 vector combination 
(Fig. 1C). Ca2+-responsive SEAP expression seemed to be specific 
for HEK-293 cells because other cell lines such as Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) K1 cells, cultured human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), and 
NIH/3T3 were insensitive to changes in Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1D).
Evaluation of the melanin-producing tattoo component
To find a suitable parental cell background for efficient expression 
of tyrosinase and optimal production of melanin, we transfected the 
constitutive mammalian tyrosinase expression vector pAT10 (PhCMV- 
Tyr-pA) into a variety of cell lines (HEK-293, CHO-K1, NIH/3T3, 
and HaCaT). We profiled the tyrosinase activity after cultivation for 
72 hours and compared it to native tyrosinase-expressing Melan-A cells 
used as positive control. Among the cell lines, the tyrosinase activity 
in HEK-293 substantially exceeded those in all other cells, including 
that achieved in the melanin-producing melanocyte cell line Melan-A 
(Fig. 1E). HEK-293 was therefore selected for subsequent use.
Design and characterization of the stably transgenic 
HEKTattoo cell line
Because the engineered cell–based biomedical tattoo is required to 
profile and record persistent hypercalcemia over long periods of time, 
we designed a stably transgenic HEKTattoo cell line containing the hu-
man hypercalcemia sensor CaSR (pAT12, PhCMV-CaSR-pA) and the 
human melanin-producing tyrosinase driven by a CaSR-dependent 
Ca2+-sensitive promoter (pAT53, PCa6-Tyr-pA). Among 57 different 
stable tattoo clones, the HEKTattoo cell line showed excellent Ca2+- 
responsive tyrosinase expression with submillimolar sensitivity (Fig. 2A), 
which resulted in substantially increased production of melanin in the 
target range of ≥1.6 mM Ca2+ corresponding to mild hypercalcemia 
(Fig. 2B).
To examine the melanin-production dynamics, we seeded HEKTattoo 
cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing increasing Ca2+ 
concentrations and recorded melanin production by time-lapse mi-
croscopy. Pigment production by HEKTattoo was compared with that 
of the positive control, HEKTyr cells transfected with a constitutive 
tyrosinase expression vector pAT10 (PhCMV-Tyr-pA) (movies S1 to 
S5). HEKTattoo cultured under mild and moderate hypercalcemia (1.6 
and 1.8 mM Ca2+, respectively; movies S4 and S5) showed melanin 
production comparable to that of the positive control (movie S1), 
whereas no pigment production was observed in HEKTattoo exposed 
to low (0.5 mM) or normal (1.3 mM) Ca2+ concentrations (movies S2 
and S3). Quantitative analysis of melanin production dynamics by 
HEKTattoo exposed to mild (1.6 mM Ca2+) and moderate (1.8 mM 
Ca2+) hypercalcemia confirmed that only persistent hypercalcemia of 
at least 12 hours (moderate hypercalcemia) and 24 hours (mild hyper-
calcemia) triggered visible melanin production (Fig. 2C). Because the 
interplay between calcitonin and the PTH typically restores blood 
Ca2+ homeostasis within minutes (14, 23), the biomedical tattoo is ex-
pected to be insensitive to natural Ca2+ fluctuations and should only 
detect persistent hypercalcemia (movies S4 and S5 and Fig. 2C).
Melanin is insoluble and has a half-life of several weeks in the 
melanocytes of human skin (24). To validate whether a biomedical 
tattoo would remain visible for extended periods of time, we stored 
hypercalcemia-induced melanin-containing HEKTattoo pellets for 
up to 6 months at room temperature. Because the melanin content was 
almost unchanged over the entire storage period, HEKTattoo-based 
melanin production is expected to provide reliable detection of hyper-
calcemia (Fig. 2D).
To use HEKTattoo in an in vivo experimental cancer setting with 
wild-type mice, we microencapsulated the cells in clinically licensed 
alginate–PLL [poly-(l-lysine)]–alginate beads (25). Before implant-
ing the microencapsulated HEKTattoo cells, we conducted control 
experiments to confirm that the encapsulated cells still responded effi-
ciently to persistent mild hypercalcemia with visible melanin production 
and that there was no interference with hypercalcemia detection, re-
cording, or pigmentation due to either transient exposure to Ca2+ during 
alginate polymerization or leaching of Ca2+ from the alginate polymer 
(Fig. 2, E and F). The results indicated that the encapsulated cells 
retained the desired characteristics. To test the biomedical tattoo in 
a thick-skin model that is comparable to human skin, we subcuta-
neously injected microencapsulated HEKTattoo cells cultivated in normo- 
and hypercalcemic conditions into porcine skin ex vivo, recorded the 
resulting visible tattoo (Fig. 2G), and quantified pixel intensities from 
the corresponding grayscale photographs (Fig. 2H). The visible dark 
spot produced by hypercalcemic HEKTattoo implants confirmed that 
the biomedical tattoo remained visible when injected under thick skin 
(Fig. 2, G and H).

the biomedical tattoo system (I) is

in melanocytes, where it catalyzes 
oxidation of phenols such as tyro-

with normocalcemic tumors did not develop any skin tattoos, indi-
cating that our system is specific for hypercalcemia-associated can-
cer types (Fig. 3, C and D). The hypercalcemia-triggered tyrosinase 
expression in HEKTattoo resulted in the accumulation of sufficient mel-
anin to produce a visible diagnostic black spot on the skin of ani-

hypercalcemia was successfully recorded for over 3 weeks (Fig. 3E). 
The intensity of the skin tattoo was comparable to the treatment group 
injected with positive control cells constitutively expressing tyrosinase 
(Fig. 3B). In addition, profiling of blood Ca2+ over the entire 24-day 
study duration confirmed that skin-tattoo development was associated 
with the onset of mild hypercalcemia produced by hypercalcemic tu-
mors (Fig. 3E). To profile pigment production by the subcutaneous 
implants, we quantified pixel intensities in micrographs of the implant 
sites of all treatment groups. Mice from hypercalcemic groups showed 
substantially lower normalized pixel intensities (Fig. 3F) due to mela-
nin at the implant site (Fig. 3G) compared to those in normocalcemic 
animals (Fig. 3, F and G).
Validation of the biomedical tattoo in wild-type mice
Next, we implanted microencapsulated HEKTattoo subcutaneously 
into the flank of wild-type mice with asymptomatic hypercalcemic 
carcinomas (produced by inoculation of 410.4 or Colon-26 cells) or 
normocalcemic adenocarcinoma (produced by inoculation of 168 cell 
line; negative control) (Fig. 4A). Healthy mice injected with HEK- 
 
293 
cells engineered for constitutive tyrosinase expression (pAT10, PhCMV- 
Tyr-pA) served as positive controls (Fig. 4B). Animals with normo-
calcemic tumors (negative control) did not produce any skin tattoo, 
as expected (Fig. 4, C and D). The biomedical tattoo successfully re-
corded the persistent cancer-associated hypercalcemia in the groups 
inoculated with 410.4 or Colon-26 cells throughout the experimental 
period of 38 days (Fig. 4, D and E). Tattoos were quantified by shaving 
the implantation site and then taking a micrograph of the pinched 
skin transilluminated with red light. Comparison of the experimental 
groups showed that a black skin tattoo (Fig. 4D) similar to the tattoo 
in positive control animals implanted with cells constitutively express-
ing tyrosinase (Fig. 4B) was visible only in animals with hypercalcemic 
cancers (Fig. 4D). Profiling of blood Ca2+ over the 38-day experimental 
period confirmed that tattoo formation was associated with the onset of 
mild hypercalcemia in the groups inoculated with 410.4 and Colon-26 
cells (Fig. 4E). All tumor-bearing animals remained asymptomatic 
throughout the 38-day period. We also quantified pigment produc-
tion by the subcutaneous implants in all treatment groups. Mice from 
hypercalcemic groups showed decreased normalized pixel intensities 
(P < 0.01; Fig. 4F) due to increased melanin at the implantation site 
(Fig. 4G), compared to normocalcemic animals (Fig. 4, F and G). 
These results support the view that the cell-based biomedical tattoo 
could detect, record, and visualize the onset of mild hypercalcemia 
associated with cancer development during the asymptomatic stage.

5000-year-old body of iceman Ötzi found in the Tyrolian alps origi-
nated from acupuncture-like stimulatory treatment (26). In the mid- 
1850s, medical tattoos were used for the treatment of congenital vascular 
nevi (27). Today, tattooing is considered more effective than intra-
muscular injection for delivery of certain drugs, as well as DNA and 
peptide vaccines (28), and functionalized subcutaneous nanoparticle 
tattoos have been successfully applied to optically quantify compounds 
such as nitric oxide and glucose in the bloodstream using skin-based 
electronics (29–31). Work is also proceeding on other applications, 
such as skin-interfacing wearable electronic devices for the detection 
of movement disorders (Parkinson’s disease) (32), heart, brain, and 
skeletal muscle dysfunctions (based on epidermal electrophysiology) 
(33), infections (based on increased body temperature) (32), and glu-
cose, lactate, and electrolyte concentrations in perspiration (34).
Melanin is a natural tanning pigment produced from the ubiquitous 
nonessential amino acid tyrosine by specialized epidermal melanocytes 
in response to sunlight exposure and serves to protect the skin from 
ultraviolet radiation–induced damage (35). Because of their color, 
melanin-based biomedical tattoos can easily be qualitatively assessed 
with the naked eye or quantified using wearable electronics (36). Thus, 
we decided to adopt a melanin-based system in the present work to 
detect hypercalcemia that is associated with the asymptomatic develop-
ment of many types of cancer (5). We expected that such a system would 
have practical benefits, because diagnosis of asymptomatic cancer, 
although difficult, could increase treatment options and improve sur-
vival rates (37), particularly for individuals with known risk factors 
(38–40) and patients who have undergone primary tumor treatment 
and require continuous monitoring to diagnose cancer recurrence 
(41, 42) or development of metastases (43, 44).
To engineer the required implantable cells for detection of mild 
hypercalcemia as a biomedical tattoo, we used synthetic biology prin-
 
ciples (45–47) to rewire the calcium sensor CaSR to expression of mel-
anin. The challenges included (i) achieving suitable sensitivity to detect 
the onset of persistent mild hypercalcemia, (ii) providing high spec-
ificity for hypercalcemia, and (iii) ensuring low basal expression of 
melanin. The engineered HEKTattoo cells met these criteria; in particu-
lar, we observed no false-positive tattoo formation in negative-control 
treatment groups throughout the 38-day experimental period.

The systemic and intracellular calcium signaling is tightly con-
trolled and essential for normal physiological functioning of cellular 
processes. Tight control within the cell, where Ca2+ serves as a second 
messenger, is maintained through various calcium pumps, channels, 
and calcium-binding proteins (48). The dysregulation in intracellular 
Ca2+ homeostasis may result in cancer initiation, progression, and 
angiogenesis. Therefore, many cancer therapies target intracellular 
calcium by affecting Ca2+ channels and pumps (49). Because the bio-
medical tattoo specifically senses only the systemic Ca2+ concentra-
tions that are 20,000-fold higher than those promoting intracellular 
Ca2+ signaling, the sensitivity and performance of the biomedical 
tattoo are not expected to be compromised by Ca2+-specific metabolic 
activities.
As a natural skin pigment, melanin is particularly well suited for 
a biomedical tattoo. We confirmed that the tattoo was insensitive to 
short-term Ca2+ fluctuations as well as leaky accumulation and was 
stable for at least 6 months. In addition, melanin absorbs light over 
a wide spectrum. Possible interference with darker skin tones may 
be alleviated by depigmentation of the biomedical tattoo area using 
a number of available medical procedures such as laser and lighten-
ing agents (50). Although the melanin-based biomedical tattoo has 
been developed and validated for the detection and diagnosis of hy-
percalcemia associated with cancer, it may in principle be linked to 
other biosensors and serve as a diagnostic device for the detection of 
a wider range of medical conditions.
The aim of the biomedical tattoo is to detect asymptomatic mild 
hypercalcemia associated with cancer. Hypercalcemia develops from 
mild via moderate to high hypercalcemia. During this trajectory, the 
biomedical tattoo detects persistent mild hypercalcemia, which may 
indicate an emerging health issue that requires further attention. In 
mouse models inoculated with colon and breast cancer cell lines known 
to be associated with hypercalcemia, the biomedical tattoo reliably 
detected the development of cancer that was still at an asymptomatic 
stage. Hypercalcemia is not exclusively linked to cancer development 
but is also associated with other pathologies, including hyperpara-
thyroidism (5), granulomatous disease (5), cognitive dysfunction (51), 
renal failure (52), and cardiac arrhythmia (53). Although these med-
ical conditions are usually symptomatic and typically only emerge 
during hypercalcemia, which may discriminate them from asymptom-
atic cancer, the biomedical tattoo could also produce false-positive 
events and detect medical conditions unrelated to cancer (20, 54). 
Therefore, the use of a biomedical tattoo for the diagnosis of hyper-
calcemia associated with cancer would be best indicated for individ-
uals with known risk factors for colon cancer [loss of CaSR expression 
(55), ectopic PTH secretion (56, 57), and ulcerative colitis (58, 59)] and 
breast cancer [human epidermal growth factor receptor-2–positive status 
(38), parathyroid hormone-related protein overexpression (40), and 
ectopic expression of PTH (60)] and for patients who have undergone 
primary tumor treatment and require continuous monitoring to diag-
nose cancer recurrence (41, 42), as well as the development of metas-
tases (43, 44).
Like any cell-based therapy, the biomedical tattoo requires a min-
imally invasive procedure that places microencapsulated engineered 
cells under the skin. However, considering the severity of the disease 
and the focus on patients with known risk factors and primary ther-
apy, acceptance of the potential risks related to surgical intervention 
(61) and leakage of the encapsulation device (62) seems justifiable. 
Alginate-based encapsulation of cells, as used in our proof-of-concept 
study, has been clinically licensed (25), and other laminated membrane– 
based implant devices are currently being tested in human clinical 
trials (63). Once the biomedical tattoo has diagnosed hypercalcemia, 
it has served its purpose and can either be removed or replaced. Only 
heterologous engineered cells will need encapsulation to protect the 
biomedical tattoo from the host immune system. Because the entire 
tattoo, including CaSR, tyrosinase, and melanin as well as the signal-
ing cascade and the promoter, consists of nonmodified endogenous 
components, their introduction into autologous cells would create a 
biomedical tattoo device that could be directly injected subcutane-
ously. After an autologous biomedical tattoo has served its purpose, 
it may simply be left in place, and a new biomedical tattoo could be 
injected at another site to monitor cancer recurrence or development 
of metastases.
Early enough diagnosis during the asymptomatic phase of a de-
veloping medical condition represents the key to prevention and suc-
cessful therapy. In conclusion, the present work provides an important 
proof of concept of this new diagnostic strategy, demonstrating the 
feasibility of using engineered cell–based biomedical tattoos for 
surveillance and potential detection of asymptomatic cancers based 
on mild hypercalcemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The goal of this study was to design a cell-based biomedical tattoo that, 
upon subcutaneous implantation, constantly monitored blood cal-
cium and produced a visible melanin-based black mark on the skin in 
response to persistent mild hypercalcemia. The biomedical tattoo is 
expected to provide visual diagnosis of a hypercalcemia-associated 
emerging medical condition that requires further medical attention. 
As a proof-of-concept hypercalcemia-associated medical condition, we 
chose asymptomatic colon and breast cancer to validate the biomedical 
tattoo in mouse models in vivo. The tattoo was designed by rewiring 
Ca2+-mediated activation of the ectopically expressed CaSR to the chi-
meric promoter PCa6 via a synthetic signaling cascade, which triggers 
Ca2+-responsive expression of tyrosinase, eventually producing the black 
skin pigment melanin. After assembling, optimizing, and validating 
the individual components in HEK-293 cells, we generated a stably 
transgenic HEKTattoo cell line that produced the expected hypercalcemia- 
associated melanin-based black skin tattoo in porcine skin mimicking 
human skin. Next, we validated the biomedical tattoo for diagnosis 
of asymptomatic breast and colon cancer in nude and wild-type mice 
using subcutaneous implantation of native or microencapsulated 
HEKTattoo cells, respectively. For precise quantifications of skin tattoos, 
we developed a tailored MATLAB code (see MATLAB code in the 
Supplementary Materials) for comparative analysis of pixel intensi-
ties across different skin samples. Animals were randomly assigned to 
experimental groups. Investigators were not blinded to tumor inoc-
ulation groups. Animals in all treatment groups were implanted with 
the same number of HEKTattoo cells. In vitro experiments were per-
formed in triplicate each containing four samples. In vivo studies in-
cluded up to eight mice per treatment group as specified in the figure 
legends. Blood samples were collected and frozen after each experi-
ment and simultaneously analyzed after termination of the study.

Cell culture and transfection
HEK cells [HEK-293; CRL-11268, American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC)], human keratinocytes (HaCaT; Cell Lines Service), mouse 
fibroblasts (NIH/3T3; CRL-1658, ATCC), and the murine mammary 
adenocarcinoma cell lines 410.4 and 168 (catalog no. 412005, Barbara 
Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute) were cultivated in calcium-free 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (E15-078, PAA Laboratories) 
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; catalog no. F7524 and 
lot no. 022M3395, Sigma-Aldrich), 6 mM l-glutamine (200 mM; cata-
log no. 25030-024, Invitrogen), and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin 
solution (catalog no. L0022-100, Biowest). The colon carcinoma cell 
line Colon-26 (National Cancer Institute, The Division of Cancer Treat-
ment and Diagnosis Tumor Repository) was cultivated in RPMI 1640 
medium (catalog no. E15-885, GE Healthcare) supplemented with 
10% FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution. CHO cells 
(CHO- 
K1; CCL-61, ATCC) were cultivated in ChoMaster HTS me-
dium (catalog no. CHTS-0.5, Cell Culture Technologies GmbH) sup-
plemented with 5% FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution. 
These cell lines were cultivated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere 
containing 5% CO2. Human melanoma cells (WM-1650) and mouse 
melanocytes (Melan-A) (all from Wellcome Trust Functional Genomics 
Cell Bank) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 
10% FCS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution, and 200 nM 
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (catalog no. P8139, Sigma- 
Aldrich). 
All melanocytic cell lines were cultivated at 37°C in a humidified at-
mosphere containing 10% CO2. All cell lines were transfected using 
an optimized polyethyleneimine (PEI)–based protocol. Briefly, 1.5 × 
105 cells/ml were seeded per well of a multiwell plate or per cell- 
culture 
dish (500 l per well of a 24-well plate, 1 ml per well of a 12-well plate, 
2 ml of a 6-well plate, 10 ml for a 10-cm cell-culture dish) and culti-
vated for 16 hours before they were transfected by dropwise addition of 
a transfection solution containing 1 g of total plasmid DNA, 100 l of 
the corresponding FCS-free culture medium, and 3 l of PEI [PEI 
“Max”; molecular weight, 40,000; 1 mg/ml in double-distilled water 
(ddH2O); catalog no. 24765-2, Polysciences). After 6 hours, the cell 
culture medium was replaced, and the transfected cells were culti-
vated for another 12 hours before they were used for a dedicated ex-
periment. The cell number and cell viability were profiled using a CASY 
Cell Counter and Analyser System Model TT (Roche Diagnostics 
GmbH).
Design of the transgenic HEKTattoo cell line
HEKTattoo was designed by a sequential two-step procedure that ini-
tially generated stably CaSR-transgenic HEKCaSR-1 cell clones, which 
were subsequently engineered for CaSR-dependent Ca2+-inducible hu-
man tyrosinase expression. Therefore, 3.5 × 105 HEK-293 cells were 
seeded per well of a six-well plate, cultivated for 24 hours, and co-
transfected with a transfection solution containing 10.5 l of PEI (1 mg/ml 
in ddH2O) as well as 3.5 g of the constitutive CaSR expression vector 
pAT12 (PhCMV-CaSR-pA) and 0.35 g of pcDNA6/V5-HisB (PSV40-
bla-pA) conferring blasticidin resistance. After 6 hours, the culture 
medium was replaced, and the cells were cultivated for 24 hours. A stable 
mixed population was selected for 7 days in blasticidin-containing me-
dium [blasticidin (1.5 l/ml) and stock solution (10 mg/ml); catalog no. 
ant-bl-1 and lot. no. BLL-35-13B, InvivoGen]. After limiting dilution 
and clonal expansion for 14 days in blasticidin-containing cell culture 
medium, individual clonal populations were transfected with pAT50 
(PCa6-SEAP-pA) and exposed to increasing Ca2+ concentrations for 
48 hours, and then the SEAP expression in the culture supernatant were 
profiled. HEKCaSR-1 showed the best Ca2+-inducible SEAP expression 
dynamics among 36 tested cell clones and was therefore used as the paren-
tal cell line for the production of HEKTattoo. Then, 3.5 × 105 HEKCaSR-1 cells 
were seeded per well of a six-well plate, cultivated for 24 hours, and 
cotransfected with a transfection solution containing 10.5 l of PEI 
(1 mg/ml in ddH2O) as well as 3.5 g of the Ca2+-inducible human tyrosin-
ase expression vector pAT53 (PCa6-Tyr-pA) and 0.35 g of pZeoSV2(+) 
(PhCMV-zeo-pA) conferring Zeocin resistance. After 6 hours, the culture 
medium was exchanged, and the cells were cultivated for 24 hours; a 
stable mixed population was selected for 7 days in blasticidin- and Zeocin- 
containing medium [Zeocin (1 l/ml) and stock solution (1 mg/ml); 
catalog no. ant-zn-1 and lot. no. ZEL-31-313, InvivoGen]. After limiting 
dilution and clonal expansion for 14 days in blasticidin- and Zeocin- 
containing cell culture medium, individual clonal populations were ex-
posed to 1.8 mM Ca2+ and profiled for tyrosinase activity and production 
of melanin. HEKTattoo showed the best Ca2+-inducible melanin expres-
sion dynamics among 56 tested cell clones and was therefore used to 
generate the cancer-specific biomedical tattoo.
Analytical assays
SEAP expression
SEAP production was quantified in cell-culture supernatants by mon-
itoring p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP)–based light absorbance. 
Briefly, 200 l of cell culture supernatant was heat-inactivated for 
30 min at 65°C. Subsequently, 80 l of the supernatant was transferred 
to a well of a 96-well plate containing 100 l of 2× SEAP assay buffer 
[20 mM homoarginine, 1 mM MgCl2, and 21% (v/v) diethanolamine 
(pH 9.8); all from Sigma-Aldrich). After the addition of 20 l of 120 mM 
pNPP (disodium salt, hexahydrate, Acros Organics BVBA) and dilu-
tion in 1× SEAP assay buffer, the time-dependent increase in light ab-
sorbance was determined at 405 nm and 37°C for 30 min using a 2104 
EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer).
Melanin production
A total of 1 × 105 cells cultivated in monolayer cultures, 200 g of ex-
planted tissue, or 200 g of explanted alginate-encapsulated cells whose 
alginate capsules had been degraded by alginate lyase (catalog no. 
A1603, Sigma-Aldrich) were trypsinized (catalog no. 59430C, Sigma- 
Aldrich), resuspended in 1 N NaOH (catalog no. S8526, Sigma- 
Aldrich) 
and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (cat. no. 276855, Sigma Aldrich), and in-
cubated for 2 hours at 80°C. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 
12,000g and 22°C, and the supernatants were transferred to the wells 
of a 96-well plate for measurement of the absorbance at 470 nm using 
a 2104 EnVision multilabel plate reader. Melanin concentration was 
calculated on the basis of a standard curve prepared with synthetic 
melanin (catalog no. M8631-100MG, Sigma-Aldrich) covering a pig-
ment concentration range of 0 to 20 g/ml.
Tyrosinase activity
Monolayer cultures were trypsinized, or the alginate capsules of mi-
croencapsulated cells were degraded by alginate lyase, and the cell 
suspension was pelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 l of 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 6.8) (catalog no. D8537, Sigma- 
Aldrich) containing 1% Triton-100 (catalog no. 3051.4, Carl Roth)

catalog no. 11873580001, Roche Diagnostics) and then sonicated for 
30 s using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). The lysate was centrifuged for 
10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4°C to remove cell debris. Ninety microliters of 
the lysate was transferred to each well of a 96-well plate, and 10 l of fresh-
ly prepared l-dopa (1 mg/ml in PBS; 3,4-dihydroxy-l- 
phenylalanine, 
catalog no. D9628 and lot. no. SLBF6724V, Sigma-Aldrich) was added 
immediately before starting the assay. Tyrosinase activity was quanti-
fied in terms of l-dopa oxidation by measuring dopachrome production 
for 4 hours at 475 nm using a 2104 EnVision multilabel plate reader.
Calcium concentration
Ca2+ concentrations in culture media and blood samples were quan-
tified using a Calcium Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision). Briefly, 10 l 
of the sample was diluted in 50 l of ddH2O and mixed with 90 l of 
the chromogenic reagent before adding 60 l of the calcium assay 
buffer. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 22°C and quantified 
at 575 nm compared to standardized Ca2+ samples, using a 2104 
EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer).
HEKTattoo implants
Implants were produced by microencapsulating HEKTattoo cells in 
coherent alginate-PLL-alginate beads (400 m; 200 cells per cap-
sule) using an Inotech Encapsulator Research Unit IE-50R (Buechi 
Labortechnik AG) set to the following parameters: 0.2-mm nozzle with 
a vibration frequency of 1025 Hz, 25-ml syringe operated at a flow rate 
of 410 units, and 1.12 kV for bead dispersion. For ex vivo implanta-
tion, 7 × 106 microencapsulated HEKTattoo cells were treated with 
normo- and hypercalcemic conditions and injected subcutaneously 
into fresh porcine skin (Kuhn butcher shop), and the samples were 
analyzed as described in the “Imaging and image analysis” section.
Animal study
All experiments involving animals were performed in accordance 
with the Swiss animal welfare act and ordinance provided by the vet-
erinary office of the Canton of Basel-Stadt (approval no. 2629/27063). 
For tumor inoculation, 150 l of PBS containing 0.5 × 106 (Balb/c-nude 
mice) or 2 × 106 (wild-type Balb/c mice) cells of the 410.4 (hypercalcemic), 
Colon-26 (hypercalcemic), or 168 (normocalcemic; negative control) cell 
lines was subcutaneously injected into the right flank of wild-type Balb/c 
(BALB/cJRj, Janvier Labs) or Balb/c-nude (BALB/cAnNRj-Foxn1nu, 
Janvier Labs) mice, and tumors were allowed to form and grow for 2 weeks 
(tumor diameter, <10 mm). Then, the animals received implants of non-
encapsulated (Balb/c-nude mice, 4 × 106 HEKTattoo cells, subcutaneous, 
left shoulder) or microencapsulated (wild-type Balb/c mice, 7 × 106 
HEKTattoo cells, subcutaneous, left flank) HEKTattoo cells. Upon detection of 
tumor-associated hypercalcemia, HEKTattoo cells triggered tyrosinase expres-
sion, which resulted in the production of melanin, a black pigment that 
can be directly seen and measured as a dark spot on the skin (Balb/c-nude 
mice) or determined by transilluminating the pinched skin with red light 
(wild-type Balb/c mice). For the monitoring of animals, general well- 
being of the animals was routinely monitored by animal facility caretakers 
by means of daily visual inspections. Project-specific monitoring was car-
ried out at least three times per week by a veterinarian, and animals were 
euthanized if symptoms of pain and/or distress were observed. The fol-
lowing humane endpoints were applied: tumor diameter > 10 mm, ul-
cerations or bleeding, body condition scoring < 2, abnormal breathing 
pattern, apathy or immobility, closed eyes or self-mutilation, detachment 
from the group or disinterest in the environment, unkempt appearance 
such as tangled fur, and discoloration due to secretions. The absence 
of all those criteria was defined as an asymptomatic disease state in the 
tumor-inoculated mice.
Imaging and image analysis
All images of the HEKTattoo implantation sites (left shoulder/flank) 
were recorded using a Nikon SMZ25 stereo-zoom microscope (0.5× 
objective and 0.63 zoom; Nikon Instruments GmbH) equipped with 
a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) 
set to a binning of 2 and an exposure time of 100 ms. To compare 
the amount of melanin in the tattoos of different mice, we measured 
and compared their pixel intensities in the corresponding images. 
Darker areas in the image correspond to lower pixel intensities (black 
corresponds to a pixel intensity of 0), and lighter areas correspond 
to higher pixel intensities [white corresponds to a pixel intensity of 
65,535 (16 bit)]. For our analysis, the images are normalized to the 0 
to 1 range (where 1 corresponds to the maximum value of the detec-
tor). Because the skin within the positive melanin-containing tattoo 
is darker than the surrounding skin, the pixel intensities within the 
tattoo are lower.
For Balb/c-nude mice, images of the implant site (left shoulder/
flank) were taken with incident white light illumination. A black sheet 
serving as black-level reference standard was placed adjacent to the 
implantation site, and the pixel intensities of the implantation site were 
normalized to the mean intensity of the reference standard. In wild-
type Balb/c mice, the implantation site (left shoulder/flank area) was 
shaved, pinched, and transilluminated with red light using a Lumencor 
SpectraX light engine [645 nm, 50% red-light intensity set with SPECTRA 
GUI software (Lumencor)] connected via a liquid light guide to a Nikon 
C-HGFIB collimator (Nikon Instruments GmbH). To transilluminate 
the skin, we placed the collimator 5 cm below the pinched implan-
tation site. Photographic step tablets (21 steps; catalog no. 1523422, 
Kodak) were used as gray-level reference standards to normalize the 
pixel intensity at the implantation site. Image-based quantification of 
melanin concentration at the implantation site of Balb/c-nude and wild-
type Balb/c mice was performed using custom-programmed MATLAB 
software (MathWorks; see MATLAB code in the Supplementary Ma-
terials). Differences in skin color among animals were compensated 
by subtracting the median intensity of the skin around each implanta-
tion site from the intensity at the implantation site itself. The amount 
of melanin at the implantation site was quantified in terms of mean 
pixel intensity.
Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software 
(GraphPad Software Inc.). Fold changes between log10-transformed 
SEAP values derived from in vitro experiments were compared using 
independent t test (Fig. 1C). All experimental data are presented as 
means ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments. Melanin concentrations 
of treated HEKTattoo were analyzed using one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (Fig. 2C). 
Differences in normalized pixel intensities recorded from images of 
porcine skin injected with induced and uninduced microencapsu-
lated HEKTattoo were compared using independent t test (Fig. 2H). 
Melanin concentrations, normalized pixel intensities, and Ca2+ con-
centrations in treated animals implanted with hypercalcemic 410.4 
or Colon-26 cells were compared to those of the control mice implanted 
with the normocalcemic 168 cell line using GraphPad Prism software 
(GraphPad Software Inc.) and one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s mul-
tiple comparison test. All treatment groups consisted of at least eight
