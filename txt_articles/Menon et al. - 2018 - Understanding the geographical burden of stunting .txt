Abstract
India accounts for approximately one third of the world's total population of stunted
preschoolers. Addressing global undernutrition, therefore, requires an understanding
of the determinants of stunting across India's diverse states and districts. We created
a district‐level aggregate data set from the recently released 2015–2016 National
and Family Health Survey, which covered 601,509 households in 640 districts. We
used mapping and descriptive analyses to understand spatial differences in distribution
of stunting. We then used population‐weighted regressions to identify stunting deter-
minants and regression‐based decompositions to explain differences between high‐
and low‐stunting districts across India. Stunting prevalence is high (38.4%) and varies
considerably across districts (range: 12.4% to 65.1%), with 239 of the 640 districts have
stunting levels above 40% and 202 have prevalence of 30–40%. High‐stunting districts
are heavily clustered in the north and centre of the country. Differences in stunting
prevalence between low and high burden districts were explained by differences in
women's low body mass index (19% of the difference), education (12%), children's
adequate diet (9%), assets (7%), open defecation (7%), age at marriage (7%), antenatal
care (6%), and household size (5%). The decomposition models explained 71% of the
observed difference in stunting prevalence. Our findings emphasize the variability in
stunting across India, reinforce the multifactorial determinants of stunting, and high-
light that interdistrict differences in stunting are strongly explained by a multitude of
economic, health, hygiene, and demographic factors. A nationwide focus for stunting
prevention is required, while addressing critical determinants district‐by‐district to
reduce inequalities and prevalence of childhood stunting.

INTRODUCTION
As a marker of poor nutrition, stunting in early childhood is strongly
associated with numerous short‐term and long‐term consequences,
including increased childhood morbidity and mortality (Black et al.,
2013), delayed growth and motor development (Grantham‐McGregor
et al., 2007), and long‐term educational and economic consequences
(Dewey & Begum, 2011). In recognition of the high social and

 economic costs of stunting, the Sustainable Development Goals
explicitly include reductions in global stunting, and many countries
have adopted the World Health Assembly target of achieving a 40%
reduction in stunting by 2025.
Achieving this reduction on a global scale, however, requires rapid
progress against stunting in India, which accounts for approximately
one third of the world's total population of stunted preschoolers
(De Onis, Blössner, & Borghi, 2011). Understanding the underlying
determinants of stunting in India—which has long been characterized
as having unusually high stunting rates relative to its economic devel-
opment (Ramalingaswami, Jonson, & Rohde, 1997)—has therefore
been the subject of considerable investigation. An array of studies from
many disciplines has drawn attention to the multifactorial nature of the
problem of stunting in India. Explanations have addressed issues such
as economic growth and agricultural production (Fenske, Burns,
Hothorn, & Rehfuess, 2013; Headey, Chiu, & Kadiyala, 2012;
Subramanyam, Kawachi, Berkman, & Subramanian, 2011), poor sanita-
tion and open defecation (Fenske et al., 2013; Spears, Ghosh, &
Cumming, 2013), discrimination against women and girls (Jayachandran
& Pande, 2015), poor maternal undernutrition before and during preg-
nancy (Coffey, 2015), exceptionally poor infant and young child feeding
practices (Menon, Bamezai, Subandoro, Ayoya, & Aguayo, 2015), and
broader dietary deficiencies (Deaton & Dreze, 2008).
Some previous studies have shown that child undernutrition clus-
ters in specific regions in developing countries (Fenn, Morris, & Frost,
2004; Gebreyesus, Mariam, Woldehanna, & Lindtjorn, 2016) and dif-
ferent types of spatial analysis studies have been conducted to iden-
tify geographical inequalities in child stunting (Fenn et al., 2004,
Gebreyesus et al., 2016, Adekanmbi, Uthman, & Mudasiru, 2013,
Alemu, Ahmed, Yalew, & Birhanu, 2016). However, much less has
been done on explaining the factors that contribute to spatial variabil-
ity in stunting (Di Cesare et al., 2015; Haile, Azage, Mola, & Rainey,
2016; Sharaf & Rashad, 2016; Srinivasan, Zanello, & Shankar, 2013),
particularly in India. Although India is a highly populated country with
a high burden of stunting, limited evidence exists on spatial analysis to
examine the patterns of stunting across the country. To our knowl-
edge, two previous assessments have been done; one at the state
level (Cavatorta, Shankar, & Flores‐Martinez, 2015) and another that
utilized data from a subset of Indian districts (112 of 640) from a pri-
vately conducted survey to examine the role of sanitation (Spears
et al., 2013). The paucity of analysis on the geography of stunting in
India is problematic for two reasons. First, there are significant eco-
nomic, social, and cultural differences both across and within states
that might well explain the stark geographical disparities in nutrition
previously observed in India (Cavatorta et al., 2015). Second, although
Indian governance has traditionally been dominated by federal and
state governments, the past 20 years has seen a major push to decen-
tralize decision making to the district and subdistrict levels. Hence, a
more granular assessment of the differences in stunting across India's
640 districts is essential for targeting and planning purposes.
In this study, we address this knowledge gap with an analysis of a
new district‐level data set created to address three research ques-
tions: (a) How do stunting prevalence and absolute numbers of
stunted children vary across Indian states and districts? (b) Which
determinants
of
stunting
are
associated
with
district
stunting
prevalence? and (c) Which determinants account for the variation in
stunting observed across high‐ and low‐stunting districts?

Data
This paper utilizes a district‐level data set generated from National
Family Health Survey (NFHS)‐4 Fact Sheets (International Institute
for Population Sciences, 2017) and the 2011 Census of India (Ministry
of Home Affairs, 2012). The NFHS‐4 survey is unique in being the first
national survey to provide data on stunting that is representative at
the district level for all 640 districts spread across 36 states. NFHS‐4
was conducted from January 20, 2015 to December 4, 2016, gather-
ing data from 601,509 households. The survey covered topics such
as child anthropometrics, parental education levels, household demo-
graphics, and access to health and sanitation services. The fact sheets
from all 640 districts were released on April 2017, but unit level data
have not been released (as of November 2017). These district fact
sheets provide summary data on 114 indicators including stunting
and its key determinants. We supplemented these indicators with data
from the Census of India (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2012), including
estimates of the population aged 0–5 years, open defecation density,
ownership of household durables, and housing characteristics.

Measures
Our outcome indicator of interest is the district level stunting preva-
lence, which is the proportion of children 0–59 months of age who
have their height‐for‐age two standard deviations below the World
Health Organization (WHO, 2006) growth reference (HAZ < −2).
The key determinants of stunting in India were selected based on
conceptual frameworks from the previous literature, particularly
UNICEF (1990) and the Lancet Nutrition Series (Bhutta et al., 2013).

Key messages
• India carries a high burden of child stunting, but lack of
disaggregated stunting data at the district level has
been a challenge for policy and program strategies in a
decentralized governance system.
• This is the first study to use district‐level data from a
recently released national survey to highlight spatial
differences in stunting across 640 districts in India.
• Our findings highlight the range of factors that explain
differences between high and lower stunting burden
districts.
• These results emphasize the importance of focused

 determinants (diets and disease burdens) and underlying determi-
nants. The Lancet framework links these determinants to interven-
tions, noting that nutrition‐specific interventions address immediate
determinants,
whereas
interventions
and
policies
in
nutrition‐
sensitive sectors address underlying determinants. In this paper, we
distinguish
between
immediate
determinants,
nutrition‐specific
interventions, and underlying determinants.
The immediate determinants included indicators related to mater-
nal undernutrition and child feeding practices. We used women's low
body mass index (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) as a proxy for maternal undernu-
trition. Indicators for infant and young child feeding included early initi-
ation of breastfeeding (proportion of infants 0–23 months who were
breastfed within 1 hr of birth), exclusive breastfeeding (the proportion
of infants 0–5.9 months of age who fed only breast milk), timely intro-
duction of complementary foods (proportion of children 6–8.9 months
of age who were introduced solid and semi‐solid foods), and adequate
diet (proportion of children 6–23 months old who received four or
more food groups and a minimum meal frequency). Some of these var-
iables are only available for subsets of districts.
The nutrition‐specific interventions included antenatal care
(ANC) during the first trimester, adequate ANC (at least four ANC
visits), and iron and folic acid (IFA) consumption (at least 100 IFA dur-
ing the last pregnancy). Indicators related to infant's postnatal care
included full immunization, vitamin A supplementation, and oral rehy-
dration solution during diarrhoea. Although some of these are health
care interventions, they are considered nutrition‐specific interventions
because they act as important platforms for delivery of nutrition‐
specific interventions such as micronutrient supplements and nutrition
counselling and reach households in the first 1,000 days of life.
The underlying determinants examined included mother's educa-
tion (≥10 years of schooling), age at marriage (at 18 years or older),
sanitation, an asset index, and household size. For sanitation, we used
water within premises (with the assumption that more access to water
may facilitate more hygienic practices) and open defecation density
(the number of people estimated to engage in open defecation per
square kilometre). An asset index was constructed from district‐level
data, using the first principal component extracted from 19 different
variables, including housing structure, house ownership, presence of
a kitchen, access to electricity, clean cooking fuel, assets, and access
to a bank account. We also included the proportion of scheduled
caste/tribes (designated groups of historically disadvantaged people
in India) in the district because it is an important dimension of inequal-
ity in India.

Statistical analyses
Several complementary methods of analysis were applied to these
data. We first estimate the absolute numbers of stunted children by
multiplying the stunting prevalence with the estimated number of chil-
dren 0–5 years of age from the Census of India. We mapped stunting
prevalence by district to graphically analyse patterns of stunting
across India. We tabulated stunting prevalence and absolute numbers
of stunted children by states and by three major state groupings
(northern states, southern states, and north‐eastern and island states).
District stunting prevalence was then categorized into four bins based
on current WHO cut‐off values for public health significance (WHO,
2010): low prevalence (<20%), moderate prevalence (20–29.9%), high
prevalence (30–39.9%), and very high prevalence (≥40%). The differ-
ences in determinants were tested for statistical significance across
these different stunting burden categories, using analysis of variance
and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons.
Second, to identify the determinants of stunting prevalence at the
district level, we examined the bivariate associations between stunting
and various determinants using scatter plots and tested for normality
of the distributions using the Kolmogorow–Smirnov test. Three vari-
ables (4+ antenatal visits, open defecation density, and asset scores)
were not normally distributed and showed non‐linear bivariate rela-
tionships with stunting; hence, they were log‐transformed. Multivari-
ate linear regression was then used to examine the different factors
associated with stunting. For this regression analysis, we dropped a
few variables that were either highly correlated with another variable
(e.g., ANC in the first trimester was highly correlated with 4+ ANC
visits) or were only available for a subset of the districts (exclusive
breastfeeding, timely introduction of foods, and oral rehydration solu-
tion during diarrhoea were only available for 425, 186, and 328 dis-
tricts, respectively). Because we are primarily interested in explaining
differences across districts rather than differences across states, all
models included state‐fixed effects, meaning that we are analysing
within‐state variation in stunting prevalence. We therefore report
both total R2, but also the within‐ and between‐state coefficients of
determination. All regression models were weighted by the population
of children under 5 years because the district population sizes vary
substantially. In terms of specifications, we first estimated bivariate
models for each variable. We then estimated a multivariable model
including only immediate determinants and nutrition‐specific interven-
tions and then estimated a full multivariable model that included
underlying determinants. In addition to gauging whether the coeffi-
cients on immediate determinants are robust to potential confounding
factors, this approach allows us to investigate potential causal path-
ways by examining how coefficients on immediate determinants
change
as
underlying
determinants
are
added
to
the
model
(MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000).
In the last step of our analysis, we applied a regression‐decompo-
sition to assess the ability of the various determinants described
above to predict spatial patterns in stunting and differences between
very high‐burden and low‐burden districts. This approach has been
used widely in literature to study mean outcome differences between
groups (Jann, 2008), including differences in child malnutrition
between geographical areas (Sharaf & Rashad, 2016; Spears et al.,
2013; Srinivasan et al., 2013) and between populations measured at
different points of time (Headey, Hoddinott, Ali, Tesfaye, & Dereje,
2015). This analysis effectively combines the analysis of differences
in means of the explanatory variables (X) and regression estimates of
the coefficients associated with these variables (βX). Specifically, the
“explained” difference between one spatial unit (District A) and
another unit (District B) is the product of the difference in the mean
of X across the two samples (XA − XB) and the coefficient of X from
a pooled regression model (βX). Intuitively, if a particular X variable
has a large regression coefficient (“marginal effect”) and a large differ-
ence in means over two districts, then this variable will play a large

 role in explaining the interdistrict difference in stunting. An attractive
feature of the decomposition approach is that it gauges the ability of
all the variables in the model to predict interdistrict differences, as well
as the ability of the model as a whole to account for these differences.
In this analysis, we implemented a decomposition at means of the
stunting differences between very high‐burden (stunting > 40%) and
low‐burden districts (stunting < 20%) with the objective of under-
standing how high‐burden districts can move towards much lower
rates of stunting. We report the share of actual stunting accounted
for by this decomposition, as well as the share unexplained by the
model as a whole.

RESULTS
India achieved a sizeable improvement in stunting between 2006 and
2016, with a decline from 48.0% to 38.4% among children below
5 years (International Institute for Population Sciences, 2017). Despite
this, stunting in India remains high and variable across districts, ranging
between 12.4% and 65.1% (Figure 1). In total, there are more than 63
million children stunted in the country, which is more than one third of
the global estimate for 2013 (De Onis & Branca, 2016). Stunting varies
substantially across major regions and states, both in terms of preva-
lence and absolute numbers of stunted children (Table 1). The popu-
lous northern states of India contain approximately 52.6 million
stunted children, accounting for more than 80% of stunted children
in the country. Average district stunting prevalence for these states
varies from 25.2% in Himachal Pradesh to 48.2% in Bihar and 46.3%
in Uttar Pradesh. These latter two states are very large, containing
9.2 million and 14.3 million stunted children, respectively. In compari-
son, all of the Southern states collectively contain 8.1 million stunted
children and the north‐eastern and island states some 2.4 million. Even
so, stunting prevalence in these other regions is relatively high in many
instances, with one third of children in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
estimated to be stunted, for example. Among reasonably populous
states, only Kerala had an average district stunting prevalence below
the 20% threshold.
Across all 640 districts in India, 239 districts have stunting preva-
lence in excess of 40% (very high), and 441 districts have stunting
prevalence between 30% and 40% (high; Table 2). Only 29 districts
have stunting levels between 10% and 20%, and most of these are
in South India. Although there is considerable clustering of stunting
within states, intrastate variance in district stunting prevalence is still
reasonably high. Specifically, inter‐state variation explains 56% of
the variation in district stunting prevalence (see Table 4 below); hence,
44% of variation in interdistrict stunting prevalence is accounted for
by intrastate variation.
National averages and district variability for various determinants
across stunting burden categories of stunting are presented in Table 3.
On average, nearly a quarter of women have low BMI. More than 40%
of children were breastfed within an hour of birth, and only 55% were
exclusively breastfed. Moreover, complementary feeding is of great
concern with less than 10% of children receiving an adequately
diverse diet. In case of underlying determinants, more than a third of

 women had at least 10 years of education, and two thirds of girls mar-
ried after the age of 18. Open defecation is still prevalent in more than
half of the population. Coverage is above 50% for several nutrition‐
specific interventions. More than half of the women received ANC
in the first trimester or had at least four ANC visits, but only 30% of
the women consumed at least 100 IFA during pregnancy. Coverage
of full immunization and vitamin A supplementation was nearly 60%.
There was high interdistrict variability for most determinants across
stunting burden category districts (Table 3). The most inequity among
districts is observed for women's low BMI, women's education
(≥10 years), asset score, ANC, and IFA consumption where the high‐
burden stunting districts have levels that are 2–3 times lower than
the low‐burden districts, and gaps range from 16% to 40%.
Bivariate analysis indicates that stunting is associated with a wide
range of immediate and underlying determinants (Table 4). The stron-
gest associations were observed for asset scores (β = −10.6 and −16.6
for Quintile 4 and 5, respectively) and low BMI in women (β = −0.73,
95% CI [0.66, 0.79]). The districts with higher coverage of nutrition
specific‐interventions had lower prevalence of stunting (β ranged from
−0.27 to −0.17).
In the partial multivariable regression analyses (Table 4), which
only includes immediate determinants and nutrition‐specific interven-
tions, we found significant relationships between women's BMI and
adequate diet among children with stunting. For every 1‐percentage
point increase in women with low BMI, there is an associated 0.54
percentage point increase in stunting. Districts with higher proportion
of children with adequate diet had lower stunting prevalence
(β = −0.21, 95% CI [−0.31, −0.11]). In terms of nutrition‐specific inter-
ventions, higher coverage of ANC (4 + ANC visits) had a large and sta-
tistically significant negative association with stunting (β = −0.36, 95%
CI [−0.53, −0.18]), and IFA consumption had a much smaller associa-
tion (β = −0.06, 95% CI [−0.11, −0.01]).
In the full model, where all the determinants were included
together, all of the above associations (except for IFA consumption)
remained significant; however, the magnitude of the coefficients
decreased, suggesting that various underlying determinants explain
variation in factors such as ANC and maternal BMI. For example, the
coefficient on maternal BMI declines from 0.53 in the partial model
to 0.30 in the full model, and the coefficient on ANC declines from
−0.36 to −0.22. Interestingly, the coefficient on adequate diet is
essentially unchanged. For both models, the total R2 coefficients are
high (0.70 and 0.74), although this is partly because state‐fixed effects
explain 56% of the national variation in district stunting prevalence. In
terms of the explanatory power of the various determinants, the more
relevant statistic is the within‐state R2 which shows that the explana-
tory variables in the partial and full models explain 31% and 42%,

 The variables selected in the full regression model were used in
the decomposition analysis to estimate the extent to which differ-
ences in these factors explained differences in stunting prevalence
across very high‐ and low‐burden districts. Overall, the decomposition
models performed well, explaining 71% of the observed differences in
stunting prevalence between high‐ and low‐burden districts (Figure 2).
This explained share is accounted for by the differences in women's
low BMI (19%), women's education (12%), adequate diet among chil-
dren (9%), asset scores (7%), open defecation (7%), age at marriage
(7%), ANC (6%), and household size (5%). Decomposition analyses
comparing low‐ and medium‐burden districts found similar results
(results not shown).

DISCUSSION
In parallel with global attention and political commitment to reducing
undernutrition, India has made considerable progress in reducing child
malnutrition in the last decade. However, stunting prevalence remains
high and extremely variable across districts and particularly high in pop-
ulous northern states. High‐stunting districts are characterized by lower
levels of immediate and underlying determinants and low levels of nutri-
tion‐specific intervention coverage. The key factors associated with
stunting were women's BMI, women's education, women's age at mar-
riage, coverage of ANC, adequacy of child diets, household assets, and
open defecation. These results suggest that if very high‐stunting dis-
trictscouldcatalyseimprovements inthesesocial,economic,anddietary
factors, they would eliminate 71% of the gap with low stunting districts.
Our analysis has several unique strengths. Previous studies have
applied decomposition techniques to understand stunting differences
between poor‐performing states and a single high‐performing state
(Tamil Nadu) using child level data from NHFS‐III (Cavatorta et al.,
2015) and to understand changes in India's national stunting preva-
lence between NHFS‐I (1992/1993) and NHFS‐III (2005–2006;
Headey, Hoddinott, & Park, 2016). Our study uses the most recent
data, is comprehensive in examining spatial variation across the entire
country, and geographically granular in that it focuses on interdistrict
variation in stunting in a country with tremendous spatial variation in
nutrition and its proximate and underlying determinants. Geographical
clustering of stunting in India is pronounced, as is the clustering of var-
ious immediate and underlying determinants and intervention cover-
age. These determinants account for around three quarters of the
differences in stunting prevalence between the very high and low
prevalence districts. A geographical lens, therefore, highlights spatial
dimensions of undernutrition that might be overlooked in child‐level
analyses. These findings also offer insights on the kinds of gaps that
must be closed with equity‐enhancing, geographically targeted policy
instruments and high‐quality implementation of these instruments.
Our analysis, therefore, provides timely evidence for policymakers to
tackle stunting in India, in a context of India's commitments to the
global nutrition targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.
We acknowledge some of the limitations of this analysis. The
cross‐sectional and geographically aggregated nature of our data
means that our analysis is ecological in nature and could still be ham-
pered by confounding factors. The richer unit level data from the
NHFS‐4, which at the time of writing had still not been released, will
permit a more extensive analysis. We were unable to examine changes
in linear growth outcomes by different age categories, which can pro-
vide important clues about the aetiology of stunting. From a policy per-
spective, however, there is significant merit in understanding district‐
level variation, because the district is an increasingly important unit in
India's ongoing decentralization process and a district‐level focus is
central to India's newly launched National Nutrition Strategy (NITI
Aayog, 2017). Moreover, despite the more ecological nature of our
analysis, our findings are well‐aligned with those from many other stud-
ies that have examined the determinants of stunting in India, using both
unit‐level and district‐level data sets. For instance, almost all previous
analyses of stunting determinants find strong associations with
mother's education (Alderman & Headey, 2016). Several studies also
link stunting in India to monotonous diets (Menon et al., 2015) and
poor sanitation (Spears et al., 2013), even after controlling for wealth
and parental education. Other studies have also found ANC visits in
their last birth to be strongly associated with stunting in South Asia
(Headey et al., 2016). A final limitation of note is that we were not able
to examine relationships between all aspects of infant and young child
feeding practices and child stunting because they are age‐specific indi-
cators (exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for children 0–5 months and
timely introduction of foods for children 6–8 months), and data were
only available for a subset districts.
A focus on addressing women's nutrition emerges as a key priority
area in our analyses, similar to other studies of malnutrition in South
Asia (Coffey, 2015). We find, for instance, that low women's BMI
explained almost a fifth of the difference between high‐ and low‐bur-
den stunting districts, corroborating results from previous studies that
maternal undernutrition before and during pregnancy is a major deter-
minant of poor fetal growth and child stunting (Black et al., 2013).
Accounting for one fifth of the global population with 42% of low
BMI prepregnant women (Coffey, 2015), India faces a critical chal-
lenge because preconception undernutrition among women can influ-
ence birth outcomes and child growth through influencing early
placental and embryonic development, epigenetic effects, and compe-
tition for nutrients between mother and baby (King, 2016).
Including maternal BMI, variables reflecting women's well‐being—
BMI, education, early marriage, and access to ANC—explain close to
half the difference between high and low stunting districts. Discrimi-
nation against women is a widely suspected cause of India's unusually
high rate of stunting, including small size at birth and low birth weight
(Coffey, 2015). Although the variables in our analysis do not capture
gender discrimination in terms of man–woman or boy–girl differences,
the indicators used reflect several investments in girls and women—
education levels, age at marriage, maternal nutrition, and use/access
to ANC services. These indicators of investments in girls and women
are likely to have both biological and social pathways to better nutri-
tion for children. For example, early marriage, and consequently early
child bearing, is more likely to lead to preterm births or small for ges-
tational age births and perhaps also higher fertility prevalence over the
life course (Branca, Piwoz, Schultink, & Sullivan, 2015; Temmerman,
Khosla, Bhutta, & Bustreo, 2015).
Our study has significant policy implications. The high burden of
stunting across most districts in India implies that strategies to address
stunting must be rolled out across most of India, and a narrow spatial
targeting is unlikely to deliver radical reductions in stunting. Moreover,
the fact that 44% of interdistrict variation in stunting prevalence is
explained by intrastate variation suggests that decentralization of the
district level is critical. In addition to the intrastate variation, inter‐
state differences were also prominent (56% of the variation in district
stunting was explained by state‐fixed effects). This is likely due to
vast differences across states in administrative and governance
approaches, implementation capabilities, and economic and sociocul-
tural differences.
The regression model used in this study has significant predictive
power, suggesting that the variables used in this analysis could be
used for monitoring multisectoral initiatives to reduce stunting. These
initiatives should prioritize improving the socioeconomic, nutritional,

 and health status of girls and women—their nutrition, education, early
marriage, and access to care during and after pregnancy—and
improvements in sanitation and overall socioeconomic status of the
household. We note, however, that many of these factors are rooted
in social and cultural contexts that will require more holistic societal
changes than policy instruments alone can deliver.
In conclusion, our findings reiterate the complex and multifaceted
nature of the burden of stunting in India. The granular district‐focused
analysis in this study, a first for India, highlights the concentration of
this burden in the northern and eastern regions and the close associa-
tions between stunting and a wide range of nutrition‐specific and
nutrition‐sensitive factors. The most important policy implications of
our analysis are the need for a stunting prevention focus that is
nationwide but focused on addressing critical determinants district‐
by‐district to reduce inequalities and the prevalence of childhood
stunting.
