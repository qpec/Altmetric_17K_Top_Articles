Neuronal noise as an origin of sleep arousals and its
role in sudden infant death syndrome

In addition to regular sleep/wake cycles, humans and animals exhibit brief arousals from sleep. Although much
is known about consolidated sleep and wakefulness, the mechanism that triggers arousals remains enigmatic.
Here, we argue that arousals are caused by the intrinsic neuronal noise of wake-promoting neurons. We pro-
pose a model that simulates the superposition of the noise from a group of neurons, and show that, occasion-
ally, the superposed noise exceeds the excitability threshold and provokes an arousal. Because neuronal noise
decreases with increasing temperature, our model predicts arousal frequency to decrease as well. To test this
prediction, we perform experiments on the sleep/wake behavior of zebrafish larvae and find that increasing
water temperatures lead to fewer and shorter arousals, as predicted by our analytic derivations and model
simulations. Our findings indicate a previously unrecognized neurophysiological mechanism that links sleep
arousals with temperature regulation, and may explain the origin of the clinically observed higher risk for sudden
infant death syndrome with increased ambient temperature.
INTRODUCTION
Brief arousals from sleep that appear random in time and occur fre-
quently throughout the entire sleep period are a riddle wrapped up in
an enigma. The dynamical aspects of arousals and their neuronal origin
are still not understood, and the debate on theirphysiologicalfunction is
controversial. Traditionally, arousals have been predominately asso-
ciated with disease in general and with sleep disorders in particular
(1–3). Too many or too few arousals are indicative of adverse clinical
conditions such as sleep apnea (4) or sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) (5, 6), respectively. More recently, it has been suggested that
spontaneous arousals are part of healthy sleep regulation and may play
a functional role to ensure the reversibility of sleep—that is, without
arousals, sleep would be similar to coma (7). In addition, arousals might
serve as a means of remote connection between the sleeper and the envi-
ronment to maintain some level of alertness to external hazards (7).
Arousals and normal wakefulness require the coordinated activity of
several wake-promoting cell groups located in the rostral brainstem and
posterior hypothalamus (8). These cell groups form the ascending
arousal system, which consists of two major pathways. One pathway
includes cholinergic neurons that generate cortical activation via inner-
vation of the thalamus and the basal forebrain. Through the second
pathway, monoaminergic neurons activate neuronal populations in
the lateral hypothalamic area, the basal forebrain, and the cerebral cor-
tex, bypassing the thalamus (9). However, the mechanisms that activate
the wake-promoting neurons (WPN) and trigger spontaneous brief
arousals, instead of consolidated wakefulness, remain unknown. Here,
we hypothesize that spontaneous arousals are caused by inherent
stochastic fluctuations in the neuronal membrane potential. These neu-
ronal fluctuations are an intrinsic phenomenon that is observed in the
absence of any external stimulation and is termed subthreshold voltage
fluctuations (10). Specifically, we hypothesize that the superposition of
uncorrelated neuronal noise currents from a group of neurons (each
below the firing threshold) in the brainstem wake-promoting system
occasionally exceeds the excitability threshold of cortical neurons, thus
provoking brief arousals (Fig. 1).
There are two main sources of neuronal subthreshold voltage fluc-
tuations (11): one is due to stochastic openings and closings of voltage-
gated membrane channels (mainly potassium channels); the other
source is random background synaptic activity. Several studies have de-
monstrated the neurophysiological significance of subthreshold voltage
fluctuations, for example, as a contributor to the stochastic resonance
phenomenon that improves the sensory detection of weak signals
(12, 13). Other studies relate subthreshold voltage fluctuations in car-
diac myocyte ion channels to the intrinsic heart rate fluctuations (14).
Here, we show through empirical analyses, analytic derivation, and
modeling simulations that neuronal subthreshold voltage fluctuations
in WPN are likely the origin of spontaneous brief arousals during sleep.
Subthresholdvoltagefluctuationsareknowntobestronglytemperature-
dependent and decrease with increasing temperature (10). Therefore, to
test our hypothesis that spontaneous arousals originate from sub-
threshold voltage fluctuations, we investigate sleep under different tem-
peratures. Specifically, we probe whether the arousal frequency and the
dynamical characteristics of sleep and wake episodes are correlated with
brain temperature. Although our main hypothesis focuses on the origin
of spontaneous arousals during sleep in general, the specific tempera-
ture effect is expected to be more pronounced in ectothermic organisms
that adapt their body temperature to ambient temperatures. Although
humans are endotherms with intrinsic temperature regulation, young
infants and, in particular, prematurely born babies show ectothermic
traits (5, 15): Young infants have still underdeveloped thermal regula-
tion during the first months after birth (5, 16), and premature babies
cannot regulate their body temperature at all and therefore need in-
cubator care (15). Moreover, under high room temperature, both
young and premature infants show frequent epochs of sleep apnea
(5, 17, 18) due to low arousability (5, 18), which may lead to SIDS. How-
ever, the mechanism that connects high room temperature with low
arousability and the resulting increase in sleep apnea and SIDS events
are unknown. Here, we show that neuronal noise due to subthreshold

 voltage fluctuations is likely to be the missing link between brain/body
temperature and arousability fromsleep. This study providesa mechanis-
tic picture of the origin of intrinsic arousals during sleep and explains
empirically based recommendations that lowering room temperature re-
duces the risk for SIDS (19) and apnea of prematurity events (17).
During sleep, WPN are inhibited mainly by g-aminobutyric acid
and galanin (8). Nevertheless, WPN maintain a low level of activity be-
cause of subthreshold voltage fluctuations, which integrated over many
WPN can occasionally exceed the excitability threshold of individual
neurons or a group of neurons (Fig. 1A). The resulting arousal is kept
brief because of the activity of the still dominant SPNs. The likelihood of
crossing the excitability threshold and triggering an arousal is smaller if
the SD of the integrated WPN current is smaller—this is the case at
higher temperatures where subthreshold voltage fluctuations are re-
duced. The mechanism we propose is illustrated in Fig. 1B, where
two model simulations of a biased random walk (see Materials and
Methods) with low and high SD (corresponding to high and low tem-
perature, respectively) yield different lengths and frequencies of arousals,
as well as different temporal organization.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of our hypothesis that neuronal noise originating from subthreshold voltage fluctuations in WPN triggers spontaneous arousals
during sleep. (A) The superposition of the uncorrelated currents from n WPN (connected in parallel) results in a neuronal current that has Gaussian distribution with SD s (due to
centrallimit theorem; see MaterialsandMethods). If thissuperposed neuronalcurrentand itsassociatedvoltage exceedan excitability thresholdD, then it triggersan arousal in the
cortex and simultaneously stimulates sleep-promoting neurons (SPNs) in the brainstem. As a consequence, the excited SPNs inhibit the WPN (negative feedback) through an
inhibitory current, which ensures sleep inertia and restoring force back to sleep, and thus keeps the arousal brief. (B) Top: Two biased random walk model simulations of the
superposed neuronal voltage (that is, the integrated neuronal current) with different values of s corresponding to low temperature (high s) and high temperature (low s). Note
that the SD s is temperature-dependent because high temperatures reduce subthreshold voltage fluctuations leading to lower values of s, as shown by empirical studies (10, 31).
Although the random walk freely moves within the interval [VK,VTh] (corresponding to “sleep state”), there is an inhibitory current once the random walk is above VTh (“wake state”).
Bottom: Shown are arousals/wake and sleep bouts corresponding to whether the random walk is above or below the threshold voltage VTh, respectively. Note that at low tem-
perature, wake bouts occur more frequently and have longer durations as compared to high temperature. In our model simulations, the threshold VTh and the potassium Nernst
potential VK are approximately constant for different temperatures in agreement with experiments (50); the voltage difference (excitability threshold) is defined as D = VTh − VK.

 voltage fluctuations in sleep regulation, we perform sleep experiments
under different ambient temperatures. For our experiments, we chose
zebrafish larvae because zebrafish exhibit similar diurnal sleep/wake
(that is, dark/light) cycles as humans (20, 21) and because the zebrafish
is an ectothermic animal (22) and, thus, allows testing of the effects of
temperature variations on arousal dynamics and sleep/wake charac-
teristics. Because ectotherms cannot regulate their body temperature,
the ambient temperature directly translates to body temperature. The
optimal water temperature for zebrafish larvae is ~28°C (22, 23). In
our experiments, we recorded the sleep/wake behavior of 48 larvae
during 48 hours, with two 14-hour light/10-hour darkcycles, at a con-
stant water temperature of 28°C. We also subsequently repeated the
measurements at 25°, 31°, and 34°C using a new set of 48 larvae for
each temperature recording (in each experiment, the set of larvae is
from the same fish line, wild-type AB; see Materials and Methods).
Because we are interested in arousals from sleep, we analyzed only
the two 10-hour long dark periods (when zebrafish are predominantly
sleeping), and we calculated for each temperature the total sleep du-
ration, mean sleep bout duration, number of arousals during sleep,
and mean wake bout duration. In accordance with our hypothesis,
ouranalyses show that an increase in temperature decreases the number
of arousals as well as the mean arousal/wake bout durations while sim-
ultaneously increases total sleep duration and mean sleep bout duration
(Fig. 2, A to D; red circles).
These experimental results are in excellent agreement with the
output of our physiologically motivated biased diffusion model that
simulates arousals and sleep/wake transitions based on neuronal sub-
threshold voltage fluctuations (Fig. 1), and where higher temperatures
result in lower neuronal noise levels as reflected by lower SD s. In Fig. 2
(A to D) (blue squares), we show the model simulation data for total
sleep duration, mean sleep bout duration, number of arousals, and

Fig. 2. Sleep and wake characteristics of zebrafish larvae (red circles) compared
to model simulations (blue squares). (A) The percent sleep time for zebrafish larvae
(blue squares) increases with increasing water temperature—from 20% at 25°C to 50%
at 34°C.The same temperature dependence is also obtained for our model simulations,
where increasing temperatures are modeled by decreasing neuronal noise levels (as
measured by the noise SD s; for more details, see Materials and Method). (C) The mean
sleep bout duration shows similar behavior for increasing temperatures, whereas the
number of arousals during sleep [shown in (B)] is decreasing with increasing tempera-
ture, with most arousals at low temperatures. Thus, the monotonous increase of total
sleep time with increasing temperatures in zebrafish larvae is associated with longer
sleep bouts. (D) The mean wake bout duration of zebrafish larvae decreases with
increasing temperature, and this trend is also reproduced by our model. The great
similarity in (A) to (D) between the experimental measurements obtained for zebrafish
larvae under different water temperatures and the model results for different noise
levels strongly supports our hypothesis that arousals/brief awakenings from sleep orig-
inate from neuronal noise. We examine for each larva the temperature dependence of
the sleep/wake parameters in (A) to (D), applying to all 48 larvae in the database a one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (comparisons between all
temperatures), and we obtain a P < 10−9 (all pairwise multiple comparisons by Tukey’s
test yield P < 0.05, except at 25°C versus 28°C for the mean sleep bout duration and at
25°C versus 28°C for number of arousals per sleep hour). In all panels, for each tem-
perature, we present the group average and SE of the 48 larvae during two dark
periods (when zebrafish predominantly sleep) with 10-hour duration each, and the
model results for each s areobtained from 48 20-hour independent model simulations
matching the duration of the 20-hour dark period. All model parameters are the same

Fig. 3. Cumulative probability distributions of sleep and wake bout durations
for zebrafish larvae at different water temperatures compared to model sim-
ulations with different neuronal noise levels. Consistent with previous findings
(20, 24), sleep bout durations are exponentially distributed with characteristic time scale t,
whereas wake bout durations show a power-law distribution characterized by the scaling
exponent a. However, the characteristics of these distributions, t and a, change with
temperature. (A) The characteristic sleep time monotonically increases from t = 1.06 min
at 25°C to t = 2.21 min at 34°C. (B) The power-law scaling exponent of the wake dis-
tributions increases with increasing temperatures from a = 0.82 at 25°C to a = 1.35 at
34°C. These empirically obtained sleep and wake distributions for zebrafish larvae are
well reproduced by our model simulations with different temperatures (that is, dif-

) that yield
the same type of distributions and temperature dependence as the experimental
data. Moreover, we obtain practically matching values for t and a between zebrafish
measurements and the model simulations for each temperature and the corresponding
noise level s, consistent with our conclusions from Fig. 2. For all simulations in (C) and
(D), we choose the same parameters for the inhibitory current (sleep inertia) co-
efficient b = 20 mV2/Dt and the excitability threshold (sleep depth) parameter D =
10 mV to best match our empirical observations in (A) and (B). Both a and t values
and their SDs (which are of the order 10−2 or lower) were calculated using the max-
imum likelihood estimation (MLE) method (see Materials and Methods) (41) on the
pooled data of all larvae at a given temperature, and these estimates for a and t are
not affected by particular bin selection for the distribution.

 mean wake bout duration for different values of s. A monotonous
decrease in s yields the same behavior as the experimental data when
temperature monotonically increases, indicating a strong influence of
neuronal subthreshold voltage fluctuations on arousability and sleep
regulation.
Distributions of sleep and wake bout durations for
different temperatures
To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the role of neuronal noise
in sleep regulation, we also need information on how different tem-
peratures affect the probability distributions of sleep and arousal dura-
tions. As was found earlier for mammals (24), as well as for zebrafish
(20), arousal durations exhibit a power-law probability distribution
characterized by a scaling exponent a, whereas sleep durations follow
an exponential distribution with characteristic time scale t. In Fig. 3
(A and B), we show the sleep and wake distributions measured for a
group of 48 zebrafish larvae at different water temperatures, 25°, 28°,
31°, and 34°C. The scaling exponent a for the wake durations and the
exponent t for the sleep durations consistently increase from low to
high water temperatures.
Next, we compare zebrafish sleep/arousal distributions under differ-
ent water temperatures to predicted values of our model of arousal and
sleep regulation under different noise levels. In Fig. 3 (C and D), we show
the model results for decreasing neuronal noise levels that simulate the
activity of WPN for increasing temperatures. Remarkably, we not only
observe the same trend in the probability distributions (increasing ex-
ponents a and t with increasing temperature/noise level) but we also
obtain very similar values for the exponents a and t matching model
simulations with the experiments. The fact that the experimental results
and the model outputs for sleep/wake characteristics are in good agree-
ment not only in their statistical means (Fig. 2) but also in their respec-
tive probability distributions (Fig. 3), strongly supports our hypothesis
that arousals are a direct consequence of neuronal noise.
DISCUSSION
Our findings may lead to new insights into the origin and functional
role of arousals in general and on the effect of temperature on sleep
architecture in particular. We introduce a mechanistic picture on the
origin of brief arousals during sleep based on the empirically observed
phenomenon of neuronal subthreshold voltage fluctuations. Currently,
there is no test to directly and noninvasively measure subthreshold neu-
ronal voltage fluctuations in humans, and our work offers an approach to
determine neuronal fluctuations by measuring key parameters that char-
acterize sleep and arousal probability distributions (Fig. 3). This would
provide a new diagnostic tool to monitor and better understand neuro-
logical diseases related to changes in subthreshold voltage fluctuations.
Fig. 4. The possible effect of ambient temperatures on apnea of prematurity
and SIDS. Asphyxia and brain hypoperfusion that can occur in infants during sleep
may result in a life-threatening event (5). Depending on the level of arousability, this
event may lead to either arousal and rebreathing or to failure of arousal and hypoxic
coma. High neuronal noise generated at low ambient temperature yields higher arou-
sability that in turn increases the probability for arousal and rebreathing. In contrast,
low neuronal noise at high ambient temperature yields lower probability of arousal
and can therefore result in hypoxic coma for the vulnerable infant. Note that very
young infants show certain ectothermic traits (similar to fish) because their thermore-
gulation is not fully developed until the age of 6 months (52), and thus, they are more
susceptible to higher ambient temperature and in higher risk for SIDS. Notably, after
age of 6 months, the percent of SIDS occurrence drastically decreases (19). The pro-
posed mechanism here indicates that the clinically observed correlation between high
ambient temperature and high risk for SIDS is associated with decline in the arousa-
bility of sleep-regulatory neuronal circuits that is due to reduction in neuronal noise at
high temperature.

Fig. 5. Schematic presentation of the physiological importance of the degree of
arousability for a group of healthy infants and infants with low neuronal noise
levels. (A and B) Circadian temperature variations play a role for increased risk of SIDS
events. Circadian rhythms in infants lead to increasing body temperature in the early
morning hours (29, 30). These independent empirical observations combined with the
mechanism we propose indicate that the circadian phase associated with the early
morning hours is characterized by reduced arousability in infants. For vulnerable in-
fants that are characterized by low level of neuronal noise, identical circadian tempera-
ture influences as observed in the healthy infants could further suppress neuronal
noise and thus shift the arousability toward a “critical low point,” contributing to
increased risk for SIDS events in the morning hours. We note that the superposition
of the circadian temperature peak combined with elevated ambient temperature can
lead to an even higher risk for SIDS (Fig. 4). Taking into account the intrinsic risk factors
for SIDS (5), low levels of neuronal noise in the vulnerable infant [as in (B)] may be due
to genetic or developmental factors. Elevated room temperature, extensive crib
bedding, bed sharing, infections, and prone sleeping position, all factors that can con-
tribute to higher body temperature (and hence to lower levels of neuronal noise and
arousability), are known to be extrinsic risk factors for SIDS (5). Our empirical analyses
(fig. S2) show a similar strong dependence of arousability on core body temperature
also in adults with higher arousability between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., when core body
temperature reaches a minimum (53, 54).

 Specifically, the thermosensitivity of neuronal subthreshold voltage
fluctuations explains the lower level of arousability at higher tempera-
tures that for premature babies and young infants may lead to an
increased risk of apnea of prematurity and SIDS events (Fig. 4). Reduc-
ing the incubator/room temperature increases neuronal noise and
therefore increases the frequency and duration of arousals from sleep,
thus avoiding potentially fatal epochs of hypoxia in young infants where
core body temperature regulation is not fully developed (Fig. 4). In this
respect, it is interesting to note that several epidemiological studies have
demonstrated a peak occurrence of SIDS during the early morning
hours (25–28) and that other investigations, not related to SIDS, found
that during sleep, core body temperature in infants significantly in-
creases in the morning hours (29, 30). Furthermore, other epidemiolog-
ical studies show that the vast majority of SIDS occur during the first
6 months of life, with a peak occurrence at 2 to 3 months of age (19).
Intriguingly, this peak in SIDS occurrence coincides with the time

leads to longer sleep bouts as reflected by higher values of t. In contrast, wake bout durations remain unaffected and show similar distributions for different values of D
as shown in (B). (C) Increasing b leads to longer sleep bouts (that is, larger values of t) and (D) to larger values of the power-law exponent a for wake bout durations.
Changing the noise level s affects both the sleep bout durations (E) and the wake bout durations (F), however in different ways. Although higher values of s (for
example, due to lower temperatures) decrease the mean sleep bout duration and the exponent t, wake bout durations increase and a decreases. For all simulations, we
use b = 1.1 and D = 4.0, and the results are consistent with Eqs. 14 and 16.

neuronal noise decrease (10, 31). Although these original experiments
were not done in the context of sleep or SIDS, our modeling approach
indicates that integrated neuronal noise as a function of temperature
plays a key role in the arousability from sleep. Therefore, the tempera-
ture dependence of neuronal noise is the likely mechanism that links all
empirical findings listed above into a unified picture that explains the
occurrence of SIDS at a particular time of the day and for the particular
age of the infants. Elevated circadian temperature in the morning hours
combined with higher ambient temperature and high susceptibility of
infants to ambient temperature can dramatically reduce arousability
(Fig. 5 and fig. S3), and thus is the plausible reason for SIDS, as also dem-
onstratedbyourmodel.Ourproposedmechanismisfurthersupportedby
empirical studies showing that infants who later succumbed to SIDS have
exhibited less waking (that is, arousability) and more sleep during the
early morning hours compared to age-matched control subjects (6, 32).
Although the above-mentioned empirical facts provide indirect ev-
idence of the link between temperature, arousability, and SIDS, our
model offers a first unified theoretical framework to link these findings.
We start from neuronal considerations (temperature dependence of
neuronal noise) and predict system-level empirical observables that
match our model predictions with experimental results on the arousa-
bility of zebrafish larvae (Fig. 2) and human subjects (fig. S2). The neu-
rophysiological mechanism that allows manipulation of arousability
through ambient temperature (as shown in the zebrafish experiment)
is likely to be effective in young infants and is currently the only plau-
sible reason for SIDS.
Previous studies show that adult rats and adult humans have more
frequent and longer wake epochs at lower ambient temperatures (33, 34).
Because adult rats and adult humans are endotherms (and therefore their
body temperature is not much affected by reasonable changes in ambient
temperatures), the temperature-dependent change in arousability could
be attributed to metabolic changes that are responsible for keeping the
body temperature constant. To exclude the metabolic influence on
arousability, we studied zebrafish larvae (an ectothermic animal), and
we propose that our results may also be tested on infant mammals,
which have ectothermic traits after birth (15, 35). Moreover, earlier
work (36) has shown that during the first few weeks, newborn rats do
not exhibit the scale-invariant temporal organization and power-law
characteristics in arousal dynamics that we report in our study. There-
fore, future work could investigate the temperature dependence of arou-
sability in, for example, newborn rats during the first 2 weeks of life.
In the context of the reported findings here, it is interesting to note
that ambient temperature has been related to workplace productivity,
performance, ability to concentrate, and the overall well-being (37, 38),
with highest productivity at around 22° to 23°C, and that office tem-
peratures below and above this optimal range have a negative effect
on concentration. On the basisof the presented data analyses and model
simulations here, one could speculate that the negative impact on con-
centration at lower than optimal temperatures is due to a “hyper-
activity” state triggered by higher neuronal noise levels. On the
contrary, higher than optimal temperatures might negatively affect con-
centration because of increased sleepiness.
We anticipate that our findings will initiate further experiments on
the correlation between arousals and the level of subthreshold neuronal
noise. For example, arousal events could be matched with the activity of
WPN in the brain that is measured directly by neuroluminescence in
transgenic zebrafish larvae or by membrane potential fluctuations in
sleeping mammalian animals. Understanding the role of neuronal noise
for the static characteristics and temporal dynamics of arousals can help
design a new generation of sleeping aids that directly target the intrinsic
neuronal noise to improve sleep quality in adults (that is, by reducing
neuronal noise) or to increase arousability in young and premature in-
fants through increased neuronal noise. Such medications might help in
particular patients with chronic insomnia who suffer from hyperarou-
sals during nocturnal sleep (2). For young and premature infants prone
to SIDS and apnea-of-prematurity events (for example, because of
family history of SIDS or because of very low birth weight), new med-
ications that elevate neuronal noise levels should be considered not only
to lower the risk of potentially life-threatening events but also to reduce
the negative effects of these conditions on the development of infants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this section, we present the setup of our animal experiments as well as
the analytic framework and details of our model simulations. Our
analytic derivations of the effect of neuronal noise on sleep are based
on statistical physics tools. In particular, we used a Fokker-Planck for-
malism and properties of the Wiener process to calculate the tempera-
ture dependence of arousability and the probability distribution of
arousals and sleep durations as found in our experiments. For our biased
diffusion model, we used the biophysical characteristic that the neuro-
nal current is proportional to the derivative of the neuronal voltage.
Zebrafish experimental protocol
Zebrafish were raised and maintained under 14-hour light (wake)
followed by 10-hour dark (sleep) cycles (39). Embryos were generated
by natural spawning and raised in egg water (0.2 mg/liter of Instant
Ocean, 3 g/liter mM CHNaO3, and 0.15% methylene blue dissolved in
reverse osmosis purified water) (39). The fish line included in this study
was wild-type AB. Zebrafish larvae were maintained at 28 ± 0. 5°C under
a 14-hour/10-hour light/dark regime until 5 days postfertilization (dpf).
After 5 dpf, 48 larvae were individually placed into separate wells of a
48-well plate filled with 1 ml of fish water, for acclimation and
habituation. Data recording of activity and sleep/wake architecture
characterization of zebrafish larvae started at 6 dpf, and larvae were kept
on 14-hour light/10-hour dark cycles for a total of 48 hours. Larvae
activity was recorded automatically in 1-min time intervals using the
DanioVision tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). Water
temperature was kept constant throughout the entire 48-hour experi-
ment by using a thermostat and a water circulation pump. The exper-
iment was repeated for different water temperatures using a new set of
48 larvae for each temperature, that is, 25°, 28° (the optimal tempera-
ture for zebrafish), 31°, and 34°C. For each 1-min time interval, each
larva was assigned either a wake or a sleep state depending on the level
of activity (39, 40). An overview of the group average (all 48 larvae) of
total sleep duration in 1-hour intervals across 48 hours shows a diur-
nal rhythm pattern (fig. S1). All animal protocols were reviewed and
approved by the Bar-Ilan University Bioethics Committee.
Sleep and wake bout distributions
For each individual larva, mean durations of sleep and wake bouts were
calculated. The number of arousals is equal to the number of wake bouts
within the two 10-hour dark periods during the 48-hour recording,
and the percent sleep time was calculated as the total sum of sleep

 bout durations divided by 20 hours. Comparison between all tempera-
tures in Fig. 2 was obtained from the P values for multiple comparisons
one-way ANOVA. In addition, Tukey’s test was used to compare be-
tween the group averages at different temperatures.
Statistical analysis and maximum likelihood estimation
The power-law exponent a of the wake distributions and the charac-
teristic time t of the exponential sleep distributions were determined
by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) (41, 42) on the pooled data
of all zebrafish larvae measured at a given temperature. MLE analysis is
unbiased by particular bin selections of the probability distribution.
The exponent t of the sleep distribution was calculated from the ex-
ponential probability f ðxÞ ¼ 1

iable (that is, sleep bout duration) and M is the minimum sleep bout

Biased diffusion model to simulate sleep/wake transitions at
different temperatures
Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to investigate the effects of
different subthreshold neuronal noise levelsonsleep and arousal/wake
behavior. To this end, we investigated a random walker with different
noise levels (SD of the steps) s. The random walker represents the su-
perposition of the subthreshold neuronal noise from a group of neu-
rons in the wake-promoting system during sleep. Neuronal noise
results from random openings and closings of ion channels in the
membrane as well as from synaptic noise and leads to fluctuations
in the current and voltage of the neurons. Those fluctuations in a
single neuron are below the excitability threshold to provoke neuronal
firing (hence, they are called subthreshold voltage fluctuations) (10);
however, they may facilitate the synchronous activity and bursting of
neighboring neurons. Although the current fluctuations of a single
neuron Ii cannot be considered Gaussian noise (11), the superposition
of the currents from a large enough ensemble of neurons (n > 30),
which can be modeled as parallel components (43, 44) with I = ∑iIi,
follows a Gaussian distribution, as dictated by the central limit
theorem (45). The relationship between the current I and voltage V
is given by the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which relates to the axon’s
membrane lipid bilayer as a capacitance C and to the ion channels
as electrical conductances (resistor-capacitor circuit) (46), and where
C ⋅ dV/dt is equal to the current. If the current I is Gaussian white noise,
then the voltage V can be described as a Wiener process (Brownian noise).
Therefore, during sleep, the resulting voltage of the WPN is given by
dV ¼ s ⋅ dw
ð5Þ
where w is a standard Wiener process and s is the SD of the voltage fluc-
tuations. Note that because subthreshold voltage fluctuationschange with
temperature (for example, higher temperature decreases neuronal sub-
threshold voltage fluctuations) (10), different values of the parameter s
reflect different temperatures in our model.
The absolute minimum of V is due to the Nernst potential of po-
tassium ions, and thus, in our simulations, if the Wiener process for

enologically, D is the lower boundary for “sleep depth”)
dV ¼ s ⋅ dw for � D ≤ V < 0
V ¼ �D
for V < �D
ð6Þ
A value of V < 0 relates to sleep, whereas V ≥ 0 relates to arousal.
Note that for simplification, D and 0 represent relative values of the
Nernst potential of potassium ions and the excitability voltage, respec-
tively. When an arousal occurs, we assume that the sleep-promoting
neuronal centers in the brain increase their inhibition of the wake-
promoting centers to restore sleep. During arousals, the dynamics of
the random walker can be written as
dV ¼ �
b
V þ 1 ⋅ dt þ s ⋅ dw; forV ≥0
ð7Þ
The electrical current I = −b ⋅ C/(V + 1) originates from the SPNs
during an arousal to restore sleep by lowering the voltage back to V < 0
(that is, the sleep state). Phenomenologically, this “sleep-restoring” cur-
rent may lead to the physiological state of sleep inertia that is the ten-
dency to return to sleep. Because I º 1/(V + 1), the sleep-restoring
current is negligible in consolidated wakefulness when V ≫ 0. The co-
efficient of proportionality b ⋅ C is in units of electrical power.
Effect of neuronal noise on the characteristic time of
sleep durations
During sleep, −D ≤ V ≤ 0, we integrate Eq. 6 and obtain
∫ dV ¼ ∫ s⋅dw
ð8Þ

Averaging yields

ð11Þ
D2 ¼ s2⋅∫ dt
ð12Þ
D2 ¼ s2⋅t
ð13Þ
In Eq. 8, the maximum voltage during sleep is V = 0, whereas
the minimum voltage is −D. The variance of the standard Wiener
process differential dw is its time interval dt (47), yielding Eq. 12.
Finally, because the probability distribution of sleep bout durations
decays exponentially with the characteristic time constant t, we ob-
tain from Eq. 13
t ¼ D2
s2
ð14Þ
Effect of neuronal noise on the power-law exponent of
wake durations
As has been shown previously from experimental data (24, 48, 49),
wake bout durations follow a power-law distribution with power-
law exponent a. Moreover, it has been shown that a ≈ b, where b is
the bias of the random walker (24). Here, we determine the rela-
tionship between s (the SD of the subthreshold neuronal noise)
and a.
For V > 0, dividing both sides of Eq. 5 by s yields
dV
s ¼ �b=s
V þ 1 ⋅ dt þ dw ¼
�b=s2
ðV þ 1Þ=s ⋅ dt þ dw
After defining a normalized voltage variable s = V/s, we obtain
ds ¼ �b=s2
s þ 1=s ⋅ dt þ dw
ð15Þ
Comparing Eqs. 15 and 5 leads to a new rescaled bias coefficient
bnew = b/s2 and to
a≈ b
s2
ð16Þ
Note that because of the change in the denominator from V + 1 to
s + 1/s in Eq. 15, the relationship in Eq. 16 is only an approximation.

where c is an integration constant. Equation 19 shows that the voltage
during arousal follows a power-law distribution similar to the arousal
durations. Another conclusion from Eq. 19 is that increasing s2 is
equivalent to decreasing b (see also Eq. 16 and Fig. 6, C to F).

 Simulations for different model parameters
Our model has three parameters: sleep depth D (that is related to the
neuronal excitability threshold), the subthreshold neuronal noise level
s, and a parameter b that is related to sleep inertia (and to an inhib-
itory current originating from clusters of SPNs). In Fig. 6, we show
how changing those three parameters affects the probability distribu-
tions of sleep and wake bout durations.
Figure 6 (A and B) demonstrates how changing D affects sleep and
wake probabilities in the model. It shows that as D increases, the
characteristic time constant of sleep bout durations t increases as well
(Fig. 6A). In contrast, changing D does not affect the probability
distribution of wake bout durations (Fig. 6B). This is expected from
the formulation of the model equations, where D is a parameter only
for sleep (Eq. 6) and not for wake (Eq. 7).
In Fig. 6 (C and D), we probed the effect of changing the parameter b.
Figure 6 (C and D) shows that the characteristic time constant of sleep
bout durations t and the power-law exponent for wake bout durations a
both increase when b increases—increasing t relates to increased sleep
bout duration, whereas, in contrast, increasing a leads to decreasing
arousal/wake bout durations. Although b directly enters into Eq. 7 and
therefore the effect on the wake bout durations is obvious (see also
Eq. 16), its effect on sleep is indirect through a weaker versus stronger
drive back to sleep, that is, dV < 0 versus dV ≪ 0 that leads to an initial
voltage after the transition from wake to sleep of V < 0 versus V ≪ 0,
respectively.
Changing the noise level s, which corresponds to the subthreshold
neuronal voltage fluctuations, has major effects on both sleep and wake
bout distributions (even for small changes in s). This is depicted in Fig. 6
(E and F). Increasing s decreases the time constant t (shorter sleep
bouts) and decreases the exponent a (longer arousals and wake bouts).
This can also be seen from Eqs. 14 and 16. Note that determining t in the
model simulations via Eq. 14 is more precise than estimating a, because
Eq. 16 is only an approximation. As we discuss in the main text of the
paper, the neuronal noise level s is strongly related to the body tempera-
ture, that is, with increasing temperature, arousal/wake frequency and
duration decrease as result of decreasing neuronal noise level.
Note that we relate the differences in sleep and wake characteristics
at different temperatures (Figs. 2 and 3, main text) to changes in the
neuronal noise level s alone and that we do not consider temperature
effects on the excitability threshold (sleep depth) D or on the inhibitory
current coefficient b (sleep inertia). This is justified because (i) D does
not change much within a physiologically relevant range of tempera-
tures (50) and changing D does not affect arousal characteristics (Fig. 6,
A and B), and (ii) the energy efficiency for single action potentials that
we can relate to our parameter b only increases significantly for extreme
hypothermia (51).

of the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 992/14 to L.A.), the German Israeli Foundation
(grant no. I-1372-303.7/2016 to R.P.B.), NIH (grant no. 1R01-HL098437 to P.C.I.), the W. M. Keck
Foundation (grant to P.C.I.), and a Marie Curie Fellowship (grant no. IIF 628159 to R.P.B.).
Author contributions: H.D. and R.P.B. conceived the project, designed the simulations, and
proposed the experiments. I.E. and L.A. designed and performed the zebrafish experiments
and wrote the corresponding text in Materials and Methods. H.D. and R.P.B. designed the
neuronal-based sleep model (with input from P.C.I. and S.H.). H.D. and R.P.B. proposed the
relevance of this work to SIDS appearance. H.D. proposed the concept of neuronal noise
(subthreshold voltage fluctuations) as the source of short sleep arousals, performed the
simulations, and developed the analytical framework using Fokker-Planck equations and
properties of the Wiener process. H.D., P.C.I., and R.P.B designed the figures and wrote the
manuscript with contributions from S.H. Competing interests: The authors declare that
they have no competing interests. Data and materials availability: All data needed to
