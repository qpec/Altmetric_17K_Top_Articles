ABSTRACT
Aging produces cellular, molecular, and behavioral changes affecting many 
areas of the brain. The dopamine (DA) system is known to be vulnerable to the 
effects of aging, which regulate behavioral functions such as locomotor activity, 
body weight, and reward and cognition. In particular, age-related DA D2 receptor 
(D2R) changes have been of particular interest given its relationship with addiction 
and other rewarding behavioral properties. Male and female wild-type (Drd2 +/+), 
heterozygous (Drd2 +/-) and knockout (Drd2 -/-) mice were reared post-weaning 
in either an enriched environment (EE) or a deprived environment (DE). Over the 
course of their lifespan, body weight and locomotor activity was assessed. While an 
EE was generally found to be correlated with longer lifespan, these increases were 
only found in mice with normal or decreased expression of the D2 gene. Drd2 +/+ EE 
mice lived nearly 16% longer than their DE counterparts. Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 +/- EE 
mice lived 22% and 21% longer than Drd2 -/- EE mice, respectively. Moreover, both 
body weight and locomotor activity were moderated by environmental factors. In 
addition, EE mice show greater behavioral variability between genotypes compared 
to DE mice with respect to body weight and locomotor activity.
INTRODUCTION
Dopamine (DA) is known to be implicated in a 
variety of functions including reward [1, 2] and physical 
mobility [3, 4]. The DA system has been known to be 
vulnerable to the effects of aging [5]. Human imaging 
studies have shown that the rate of D2R loss during aging 
occurs at approximately 10% per decade [6]. While it is 
apparent that D2R decreases in both human and rodent 
brains as a result of physiological deterioration following 
senescence, the functional consequences of this decline on 
behavior and lifespan are not fully understood [7-9].
The integrity of the DA system diminishes with age 
and contributes heavily to neurodegenerative diseases 
affecting motor output [10]. In particular, alterations in 
D2R have been associated as a primary mechanism for 
motor deficits [7, 11]. Several key areas of the brain 
are particularly vulnerable to the effects of aging: the 
substantia nigra (SNc), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), 
and the striatum. The SNc and VTA are the primary 
source for projecting DA neurons. DA neurons in the SNc 
project mainly to the dorsolateral striatum, forming the 
nigrostriatal pathway while DA neurons in the VTA project 
to the ventromedial striatum and the cortex, forming the 
mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, respectively [12]. 
Decline in DA neuron populations within these areas, 
especially within the nigrostriatal pathway, has been shown 
to contribute to motor impairment and the progression of 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) [13-16]. Additionally, decreases 
in SNc connectivity within the basal ganglia circuitry [17] 
as well as a decline in midbrain DA synthesis [16] have 
also been associated with PD. Moreover, a D2R deficiency 
has been known to lead to reduced spontaneous mobility 
and produce PD-like symptoms [18]. However, it should

be noted that alterations in other DA receptor may also 
play an integral role in motor output. While traditional 
models understand DA-related locomotion through the 
cAMP pathway, modulated by the opposite functions 
of D1 and D2 receptors, it has been demonstrated that 
the PLC/IP3 pathway also contributes to locomotion 
exclusively through the activation of the D1 receptor; thus 
establishing the involvement of D1 receptor function in 
the discussion of PD [19].
D2R ability to modulate reward seeking behavior, 
motivation, and expectation of a reward, influences 
feeding behavior [20]. Alterations in the DA reward 
system can lead to abnormal eating behavior; the down 
regulation of D2R receptor signaling is thought to reduce 
sensitivity to reward, providing an incentive to overeat [21, 
22]. This has been shown in human and rodent imaging 
studies, where obese subjects showed lower striatal D2R 
expression, which may pose as a risk factor for overeating 
[23-25]. Obese subjects showed a negative correlation 
between striatal D2R expression and body mass index 
[23]. Similar findings of reduced striatal D2R expression 
were also seen in rodent studies [25]. Reductions in D2R 
gene expression have also been associated with lower 
metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which plays 
an important role in inhibitory control. The combination 
of reduced D2R signaling and reductions in prefrontal 
metabolism are thought to be powerful mediators with 
respect to the role of food intake and may contribute to 
obesity [24]. 
An EE is characterized by sensory, motor and social 
stimulation relative to standard housing conditions [26]. 
The incorporation of exercise is an important component 
of an EE and its benefits have been shown to be a powerful 
mediator of brain function and behaviour [27-29]. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that the benefits of an EE 
promote neurogenesis within the hippocampus [30, 31]. 
An EE also has the ability to modulate DA activity within 
certain areas of the brain; specifically, mice living in an EE 
show reduced DA release within the PFC [32, 33]. 
 While it can be difficult to analyze which 
environmental components have influence over various 
domains of cognition, it is thought that the aerobic 
exercise component is a critical factor involved in the 
formation of memory [34]. Mustroph and colleagues has 
demonstrated in C57BL/6J mice that an EE, without the 
exercise component, failed to increase neurogenesis within 
the hippocampus and consequently improve cognition 
[34]. It is suggested that exercise may counteract some of 
the age-related deficits in metabolic support and neuronal 
dysfunction [35]. Moreover, research on the role of D2R 
in the aging process have revealed important polymorphic 
associations of the dopamine D2R gene and magnification 
of the aging process especially as it relates to memory and 
cognition [36, 37]. There is also research showing that 
polymorphisms of the D2 gene may influence the ability to 
be able to change ones goals as a function of environment. 
This flexible cognitive switching is an endophenotype of 
executive functioning and is highly heritable. Specifically, 
Markett and colleagues showed that carriers of the D2 
A1+ variant who have a 30% decrease in lower striatal 
dopamine D2 receptor density compared to A1- carriers 
show a larger backward inhibition effect [38]. In line 
with previous results demonstrating increased behavioral 
flexibility in carriers of this genetic variant which favors 
cognitive flexibility may be important for cognitive 
manipulation, survival and lifespan. 
To determine whether the D2R gene is involved in 
the mechanism of environmental enrichment, different 
housing conditions were examined in mice. This study 
hypothesized that the D2 gene, in the presence of an 
EE, significantly influenced lifespan, body weight, and 
locomotor activity. 
RESULTS
Lifespan
Lifespan was measured in weeks and analyzed 
with a 2x3 Factorial ANOVA using sex, genotype and 
environment as the variable factors. Average lifespan for 
the entire population was 96.4 ± 1.43SE weeks, with the 
main effect of sex not being significant (F(1, 230) = .56; p 
> 0.05, ηp
2 = .002).
The main effect of genotype was significant (F(2, 
230) = 12.3; p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.10; Figure 1), such that Drd2 
-/- had a 15.2% shorter lifespan than Drd2 +/+ and 14.5% 
shorter lifespan than Drd2 +/- (p < .05). Similarly, lifespan 
means for Drd2 +/+ were significantly greater than Drd2 
+/- (p > .05). Environment also had a significant effect 
(F(1, 230) = 6.64; p > .05, ηp
2 = .03), such that EE mice 
lived 8.2% longer than DE mice. 
The interaction of genotype x environment was also 
significant (F(2,230) = 7.00; p < .001, ηp
2 = .05). Between 
environments, Drd2 +/+ mice significantly benefited 
from an EE, living more than 18% longer than their DE 
counterparts. The 13% increase in lifespan for Drd2 +/- 
EE mice over their DE counterparts was found to also be 
significant (p = .05), whereas Drd2 -/- lifespan was not 
significant between environments (p > .05) (see Figure 
1). While the effects of genotype within a DE were not 
significant (F(2, 128) = .52 p > 0.05; η2 = 0.01), the effects 
of genotype in a EE were (F(2, 111) = 15.2; p < .001, η2 = 
.22), such that average lifespan for Drd2 -/- EE mice was 
25% shorter than Drd2 +/+ EE and nearly 23% shorter than 
Drd2 +/- EE mice (p < .0001 for both). Lifespans between 
Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 +/- EE mice were not significant (p > 
.05) (see Figure 1 and Supplement Table 1).

Body weight
A 2 (sex) x 6 (time) mixed factorial ANOVA which 
weight was the dependent variable produced a significant 
main effect for sex (F(1, 273) = 216.42; p < 0.001, ηp
2 = 
0.44). Overall, male mice weighed more than female mice, 
and interaction of sex and time revealed that males were 
heavier than females during every time point.
Subsequent analysis was employed with a repeated 
measure ANCOVA using sex as a covariate, and genotype, 
environment and time as variable factors. There was a 
significant main effect for time (F(5, 1365) = 158.2; p < 
.001, ηp
2 = 0.37) which was best explained by a quadratic 
effect (FQuadratic (1,273) = 274.95, p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.50). For 
all groups, body weights rose during months 4 through 16, 
and then declined in months 20 and 24.
The main effect of genotype was significant (F(2, 
273) = 4.62; p < .05, ηp
2 = .03). Drd2 +/- mice weighed an 
overall 3% more than Drd2 +/+ (p < 0.05) and 5% heavier 
than Drd2 -/- (p < .01) (see Figure 2A).
The interaction of genotype and time was significant 
(F(10, 1365) = 12.90; p = .001, ηp
2 = 0.09; Figure 2A). 
At 4 and 8 months of age, Drd2 +/+ mice weighed less 
than Drd2 +/- (p < .05) and Drd2 -/- (p < 0.001). At 12 
months of age, Drd2 +/- had a greater body weight than 
Drd2 +/+ (p < .01). Drd2 +/- body weights peaked at 16 
months of age and was more than 14% greater than both 
Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 -/- (p > 0.001 for both). At 20 and 24 
months of age, Drd2 -/- body weight dropped by 8% to 
11% compared to Drd2 +/+, and 6% to 7% compared to 
Drd2 +/- (see Figure 2A).
The interaction of genotype x environment x time 
was significant (F(10, 1365) = 10.70; p < .001, ηp
2 = 
0.07). However, the genotype x time interaction is greater 
(meaning more variation across genotypes) among the EE 
mice than the DE mice.

over Drd2 +/- DE was found to be significanT; p = 0.05.

their EE counterparts. A 3% difference in body weight between DE and EE Drd2 +/+ were found to be approaching significance; p = 0.05.

Within the DE, there was a significant effect for 
genotype for mice at 4 months of age, such that Drd2 -/- 
weighed significantly more than Drd2 +/+ (p < .01). All 
genotypes within the DE had equivalent body weights 
at 8 months of age, however, at 12 months, Drd2 +/- had 
greater a greater body weight than Drd2 +/+ (p < 05). At 16 
months of age, Drd2 +/- weighed significantly more than 
Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 -/- mice (p < 0.001 for both). However, 
at 20 and 24 months of age, Drd2 +/- body weight dropped 
and all genotypes had equivalent weights (p > .05 for 
both time points)(see Figure 2B and Supplement Table 
2). Within the EE, Drd2 +/+ had lower body weights at 
4 months and 8 months of age compared to Drd2 +/- and 
Drd2 -/- (p < 05). Drd2 +/- body weight at 12 months of 
age was greater than Drd2 +/+ (p < .05). At 16 months of 
age Drd2 -/- body weight was less than both Drd2 +/+ and 
Drd2 +/- (p < .05). During 20 and 24 months of age, Drd2 
+/+ were heavier than Drd2 +/- (p < .05), who were heavier 
than Drd2 -/- (p < .01) (see Figure 2B and Supplement 
Table 2).
Locomotor
A mixed design ANOVA using sex and time as 
variable factors showed both the main effect of sex (F(1, 
278) = 0.024; p > .05, η2 < .0001), and the interaction of 
sex over time (F(5, 1390) = 0.501; p > .05, η2 < .002) 
was not significant. Therefore, the variable sex has been 
dropped, and the remaining ANOVAs used genotype, 
environmental enrichment and time as factors.
The main effect for time was significant (F(5, 1370) 
= 17.3; p < .001, η2 = .06), which was best explained by 
a quadratic effect (FQuadratic (1, 274) = 38.3; p < .0001, η2 
= .12). Activity was highest during 8 and 12 months of 
age, then declining through 16 to 24 months of age (see 
Supplement Table 3A).
The main effect for genotype (F(2, 274) = 89.8; p 
< .001, η2 = .40), and the interaction of genotype x time 
(F(10, 1370) = 6.01; p < 0.001, η2 = .04) were significant. 
Overall, Drd2 +/+ had the highest activity levels, and Drd2 
-/- had the lowest (p < .0001 between all genotypes) (see 
Figure 3A). From 4 to 20 months of age, activity levels for 
Drd2 -/- were below Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 +/- (p < .05). From 
12 to 24 months of age, Drd2 +/+ were more active than 
Drd2 +/-, (p < .05). At 24 months of age Drd2 -/- activity 
was equivalent to both Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 +/- mice (p > 
.05) (see Figure 3A). The main effect of environment (F(1, 
274) = 35.3; p < .001, η2 = 0.11) and the interaction of 
environment x time (F(5, 1370) = 5.73; p < .001, η2 = .02) 
were significant and assessed using independent sample 
t-tests. It was found that DE mice were significantly more 
active than EE mice for every month, except at 24 months 
of age (p > .05).
The interaction of genotype and environment was 
significant (F(2, 274) = 8.82; p < .001, η2 = 0.06). Between 
environments, Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 -/- DE mice were 3% 
and 16% more active than their EE counterparts. Drd2 +/- 
activity was similar between environments (p > .05). A 
trend was seen where Drd2 +/+ were more active than Drd2 
+/- (p < .05) and Drd2 +/- were more active than Drd2 -/- 
(p < .01) was seen within both environments (see Figure 
3B). The interaction of genotype x environment x time 
was significant (F(10, 1370) = 3.50; p < .001, η2 = 0.03). 
Greater variation between genotypes existed in the EE 
(8.5%) compared to the DE (4.4%). Within the DE, Drd2 
+/+ had greater activity levels compared to Drd2 +/- at 4 
and 24 months of age (p < .05), while this was seen from 
12 to 20 months of age within the EE (p < .01). Drd2 -/- 
activity levels were lower than Drd2 +/+ at every month, 
regardless of environment, except at 24 months of age 
where DE Drd2 -/- had similar locomotor activity as DE 
Drd2 +/+. Drd2 +/- activity was greater than Drd2 -/- in 
both environments at 4 and 8 months of age (p < .01). This 
continued within the EE for 12 and 16 months of age (p < 
.0001). (See Figure 3B and Supplement Table 3B).
Between environments and within genotype over 
time, Drd2 +/+ DE activity levels were only greater than 
Drd2 +/+ EE at 4 and 8 months of age (p < 0.01). Activity 
levels between Drd2 +/- DE and EE were similar for all 
months, except at 12 and 20 months of age, where DE 
activity was greater than EE activity (p < .05). In contrast, 
Drd2 -/- DE activity levels were greater than Drd2 -/- 
EE after 4 months of age (p < .05) (see Figure 3B and 
Supplement Table 3B).
DISCUSSION
Lifespan/aging
Results supported the hypothesis and showed 
that the D2 gene along with environmental conditions 
combined to significantly influence lifespan, body weight, 
and locomotor activity. These data provide the first 
evidence of the role of D2R gene on lifespan in mammals 
(along with the mediating effects of environment) and are 
in agreement with very recent results by Landis et al in 
drosophila[39]. 
Mice with normal or reduced expression of the D2 
gene and housed in an EE showed significant increases in 
lifespan. However, mice deficient in D2 failed to benefit 
from an EE. Similar increases in lifespan were also 
recently observed in D4 mice raised in an EE [40] . The 
D2 gene function appears to be a critical mediator linked 
to the behavior and lifespan effects associated with an EE. 
D2’s mediating role, however is environment-dependent 
and was not observed in mice raised in DE conditions.
Mice exposed to EE, experienced social interaction, 
cognitive stimulation (enrichment toys in the cage), and 
exercise (access to a running wheel). Earlier studies have 
demonstrated the mediating effects of exercise on lifespan.

For example, it has been shown that rats who exercised 
starting from 1.5 months of age displayed significant 
increases in lifespan compared to sedentary rats; male rats 
allowed to exercise lived 19.3% longer than male controls 
and female rats allowed to exercise lived 11.5% longer 
than female controls [41]. Interestingly, Samorajski and 
colleagues showed that mice who began exercise treatment 
at a later stage of development - both continuously or 
intermittently until death - did not show these increases in 
lifespan [42]. Lifespan benefits associated with exercise 
appeared to be dependent upon the age at which the 
exercise treatment was introduced. Locomotor activity 
within the first 8 months of age can be seen as a predictive 
factor in lifespan (See Figure 4). It is therefore possible 
that the lifespan differences between environment groups 
observed here could be attributed to the effects of early 
and continuous exercise.
More recent studies on exercise have displayed 
it’s powerful health benefits, especially in relation to 
mitochondrial function which plays a critical role in many 
age-related neurodegenerative diseases [27, 43, 44]. The 
anti-aging and neuroprotective factors associated with 
exercise may be the key factor as to why Drd2 +/+ and 
Drd2 +/- EE mice showed increased lifespan in comparison 
to their DE cohorts. Interestingly, there is evidence for a 
powerful link between DA striatal function and longevity. 
This was made clear in an experiment showing the use 
of (-) deprenyl to counteract the age-related decline 
of nigrostriatal neurons [45]. Administration of either 
0.25mg/kg of (-) deprenyl or saline solution was given 
three times a week to 2 year old rats; it was observed that 
(-) deprenyl-treated rats had an increased average lifespan 
of 197.98 ± 2.36 weeks compared to saline-treated rats 
with an average lifespan of 147.05 ± 0.56 weeks [45]. 
This is consistent with recent data in Drosophila showing 
that dopamine pathway genes including the D2 gene are 
candidate positive regulators of life span[39]. 
 Body weight
D2R Deficiency has been highlighted as one of 
the many components involved in Reward Deficiency 
Syndrome (RDS) which is characterized by polymorphic 
variations of certain genes which precede RDS, causing 
aberrant DA transmission in the mesocroticolimbic 
pathway, producing a dysfunction in brain reward [46-
50]. It’s possible that, given the strong connection 
between reward-seeking behavior and obesity [50, 51],

an RDS-associated condition may underlie what is known 
as food addiction. Food addiction can be thought of as 
a manifestation of RDS, resulting in a self-compensatory 
mechanism for an imbalance of D2R expression within 
the striatum. The inability to adequately acquire the 
appropriate amount of reward from natural reinforcers may 
predispose an individual to obtain more than is necessary 
to reach satisfaction. This represents a non-homeostatic 
feeding mechanism where hedonic feeding acts as an 
overwhelming influence in achieving a sense of well-being 
and satisfaction (natural characteristics resulting from DA 
release). This is illustrative in the fact that Drd2 +/- DE 
mice have significantly higher body weights than Drd2 +/+ 
counterparts. The fact that this is not the case within an 
EE may indicate that there is an EE-associated protective 
factor which is attenuating the RDS impact on hedonic 
feeding in Drd2 +/- mice. 
Hormones are known to act on the CNS and regulate 
energy balance and eating behavior. These data include, 
among others, the effects of leptin and insulin receptor 
expression within midbrain DA neurons of the SNc and 
VTA [52]. These areas represent potential targets for 
insulin and leptin to influence the DA-related motivational 
circuitry associated with feeding. Kim and colleagues have 
shown that Drd2 -/- mice have an increased sensitivity to 
leptin signaling, thus promoting reduced body weight 
and food intake [53]. This observation is seen in our 
data showing reduced weight in Drd2 -/- compared 
to Drd2 +/- and Drd2 +/+ mice, but only within an EE. 
Additional evidence shows that leptin is able to modulate 
D2R expression [54]. There appears to be an inverted-U 
shaped curve between D2R expression and body weight 
within the DE. Since the D2 receptor is involved in 
motivational and goal-oriented behaviors, it is possible 
that lacking the D2R entirely may not provide mice with 
the incentive to overeat and become at risk for obesity. 
Also, leptin signaling in midbrain DA regions may reduce 
the nonhomeostatic properties of food which could result 
in a diminished motivation to eat [55]. Even more, acute 
infusion of leptin into the lateral ventricle of male wistar 
rats has been shown to reduce extracellular DA release in 
the NAc following food intake [56]. It’s clear that there 
exists an intimate relationship between the D2R and leptin 
signaling; however this relationship remains far from 
completely understood especially with consideration to 
and interaction with environmental factors.
Opposite to the effects of leptin, the gastric 
hormone, ghrelin, alters homeostatic feeding behavior by 
stimulating hunger and food intake [57]. Ghrelin acts on 
the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), which 
is known to be expressed in various locations including 
the hypothalamus, SNc, and VTA, and is implicated 
in the induction of feeding in both humans and rodents 
[58-60]. Recently, ghrelin has been shown to involve the 
DA system in the regulation of food intake and operant 
behavior. Evidence showing antagonism of D1, D2, and D3 
receptors by pharmacological administration in Sprague-
Dawley rats resulting in the prevention of hyperphagia 
from ghrelin illustrates how DA signaling is implication 
in food intake [61]. Also, administration of ghrelin into 
the VTA increased DA release in the NAc as well as 
locomotor activity [62]. Furthermore, it has been shown 
that ghrelin’s influence in the mesolimbic pathway may be 
a required component for the integration of environmental 
cues and responding to reward expectation, thus promoting 
an orexigenic drive [63]. The regulation of sensing and 
responding to environmental food cues through the 
function of the VTA could therefore be influenced directly 
by metabolic hormones. Ghrelin appears to exert some of 
its appetite-stimulating influences by directly modulating 
the mesolimbic pathway, thus promoting increased 
motivation to eat [64]. While the interaction between 
ghrelin and the DA system is still not fully understood it is 
possible that lifelong differences in D2R expression may 
play a key role in regulating ghrelin’s actions on feeding 
behavior. 
Therefore these data suggest that environment can 
interact with D2R levels in producing effects on body 
weight; particularly within the EE. While Drd2 +/- mice 
had overall a greater body weight than Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 
-/- mice, this was primarily seen within an EE. Diminished 
D2R expression and it’s correlation with higher body 
weight is consistent with obese humans data reporting a 
negative correlation with D2R expression [23]. A negative 
correlation has also been found between D2R expression 
and body weight in obese rats [65]. Since significant body 
weight differences among genotypes do not typically 
become apparent until the middle and late stages of 
lifespan, we could imply that alterations in metabolic 
signaling is associated with differences in D2R signaling 
and aging. The interaction between altered expression of 
the D2R and neuropeptides provides an explanation for 
lower body weight in Drd2 -/- mice within an EE, but not 
for the Drd2 -/- mice in a DE. 
Locomotor activity
In support of previous studies, D2R expression 
played a critical role on locomotor activity [18, 66-68]. 
However, the interaction between D2R and locomotor 
activity and environmental influence is poorly understood. 
Here EE mice showed 8.5 % variability between the 
genotypes across time while DE mice showed 4.4% 
variability between genotypes across time in terms of 
activity. Environment-related changes in locomotor 
activity seen in the current study are supported by 
previous studies which also show hyperactivity within 
DE mice [69-71]. Developmental adaptations to 
the environment are thought to involve exploratory 
mechanisms. D1 receptor activation and the subsequent 
release of acetylcholine in the PFC has been shown to 
play an important role in spontaneous motor output and

exploratory behavior [72, 73]. There is evidence that the 
effects of prefrontal D1 stimulation and acetylcholine 
release are modified in rats reared in an EE [72]. An EE 
appears to reduce D1 function within the PFC and reduce 
acetylcholine release in response to stress, contributing 
to reductions in spontaneous motor activity, and that that 
rodents reared in enriched settings were more efficient 
explorers and habituated to novel environments faster 
[74]. The hyperactivity seen in the DE mice may be due 
to inefficient exploration of the testing field. Interestingly, 
Drd2 -/- EE mice show a major reduction in locomotor 
activity compared to the Drd2 -/- DE mice. This finding 
suggests that the proposed model for EE-induced 
hypoactivity appears to hold true for mice deficient in 
D2R. Thus, it is plausible to assume that alterations in D1 
function within the PFC occur in the absence of D2R.
Environment
Environmental conditions modify brain plasticity 
and induce changes on a cellular, molecular and behavioral 
level [75]. In order to understand the behavioral changes 
produced by an environment, it is necessary to look at 
the underlying neural mechanisms. Most interesting is 
the effect an environment has on the DA system. It has 
been established that novel and stressful stimuli within 
the environment can induce DA release within the PFC 
(possibly acting as a coping mechanism) via activation of 
VTA neurons [76-78]. It was further shown that stress-
induced DA release in the PFC decreases with age [79, 
80]. Additionally, it has been shown that the function of 
VTA DA neurons that project to the PFC are altered in 
rodents exposed to an EE; namely, stress-induced release 
of DA in the PFC was reduced in rats raised in an EE 
[81]. This is probably the result of a reduced perception 
of stress from the anxiolytic effects of an EE; in other 
words, an EE protects rodents so that they deal with 
future stressors more positively. Interestingly, previous 
reports have shown longevity to be correlated with stress 
reactivity to environmental factors between different 
strains of rats; namely, rats who were more behaviorally 
reactive to stress had a shorter lifespan. Since stressed rats 
showed earlier degeneration in dopaminergic pathways, 
it’s thought that the shortened lifespan might be the result 
of a failure to adapt to environmental challenges leading 
to reduced compensatory adjustments in surviving 
neurons [82]. Although the current study did not directly 
compare reactivity to stress between environments, it is 
hypothesized that this model of environment-dependent 
behavioral stress reactivity may play a role in the longer 
lifespans of Drd2 +/+ and Drd2 +/- mice in an EE.
Lastly, it has been postulated that an EE may have 
protective effects against mitochondrial dysfunction. 
Exercise in particular has received much attention given 
its widespread health benefits and neuroprotective 
role in modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS). In 
accompaniment of aging, mitochondrial dysfunction is 
a critical mechanism known to occur which can leave 
an organism vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases 
[83]. Exercise appears to be an ROS modulator via 
neurotrophins such as BDNF. Since BDNF is critical to 
the support and maintenance of neuronal populations, 
thus promoting healthy cognitive abilities, it is suggested 
that exercise can be protective in attenuating age-
related cellular damage in diseases like Alzheimer’s and 
Parkinson’s disease [84]. The ability of sustained exercise 
to promote neuroplasticity combined with the anxiolytic 
effects of social interaction and environment enrichment 
setting, do promote the survival and healthy function of 
mice. The current findings support that D2R plays an 
important role and interacts with an enriched environment 
(that includes exercise) to promote lifespan.
Limitations
The study of environmental enrichment is a complex 
phenomenon that can include multiple components such 
as type of enrichment stimuli (number of stimuli, novelty 
of stimuli), type of social interaction (play behavior, 
aggression, sexual behavior, social hierarchy), and 
exercise (forced versus voluntary). While many studies 
have characterized the individual contributions of each 
enrichment form, few, if any, have done so under the 
expressive differences of the D2R gene in rodents. Due 
to the fact that we are unable to distinguish between 
the individual component contributions of our designed 
enriched environment, we cannot determine which 
component is having a particular effect on the mice. It 
has yet to be established how these components operate in 
relation to D2R expression, thus further experimentation 
would be necessary in evaluating our enrichment 
components separately. Additionally, deleting a gene 
(as with our Drd2 -/- mice) may result in compensatory 
changes in other neurochemical signaling pathways. 
These developmental adaptations may produce alternative 
behavioral characteristics which might be unaccounted for 
[66]. 
CONCLUSIONS
The dichotomy over genes versus environment 
has provided a rigorous and long debate in deciphering 
individual differences in longevity. In truth, there exists 
a complex interaction among the two which contribute 
to such individual differences observed. In describing 
the significant contributions on longevity, a recent paper 
has demonstrated that the Drd4 gene plays a critical role 
in modulating longevity within an EE [40]. The D4R, 
which is part of the same family of receptors as the D2R, 
appears to mediate lifespan similarly to D2R. While 
further research is needed into the specific environmental

conditions, families of genetic polymorphisms and 
epigenetic mechanisms; these results provide the first 
evidence of D2R gene-environment interaction playing an 
important role in longevity and aging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male and female D2 transgenic mice (breeding pairs 
were obtained from David Grandy of Oregon Health 
Sciences University, and bred as previously described 
[85, 86]), were split into 3 groups: mice that had either 
normal expression of the D2 receptor (Drd2 +/+), half of 
the levels of expression of the D2 receptor (Drd2 +/-), 
and mice that were deficient of the D2 receptor (Drd2-/-
). These mice were placed in either an EE or a DE. The 
EE mice were group housed in a large cage (27 x 48 x 
15 cm) with access to an igloo-shaped plastic container 
with a running wheel attachment and exploratory tunnels 
(Bio-Serv; Frenchtown, New Jersey, USA). The DE mice 
were single housed in a standard plastic cage (19 x 29 x 12 
cm) without access to these enrichment objects. Mice from 
both environments were given bedding squares (Ancare; 
Bellmore, New York, USA). All mice were placed on 
an inverse 12 hour light cycle beginning at 0600 hours, 
with food and water given ad libitum. All experiments 
were approved by and conducted in compliance with 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Lifespan
Daily health inspections were made to assess the 
health of the mice based on the use of a Body Condition 
Scoring (BCS) approach [87], where mice weights, 
spontaneous mobility, and the presence and treatments for 
any skin lesions associated with aging were present. Mice 
that were determined to be reaching their endpoint or in 
poor health were deeply anesthetized with 3% isofluorane 
followed by cervical dislocation and head decapitation; 
their brains were collected for future analysis.
Body weight
Body weight measurements were taken in the middle 
of their dark cycle and conducted on a weekly basis. Body 
weight was binned into bi-monthly intervals starting at 16 
weeks of age, and analyzed at 4 month intervals beginning 
at month 4 and ending on month 24. 
Locomotor activity
Locomotor activity was measured bi-monthly 
by placing the mice in an optical sensor acrylic arena 
(measuring 26.67 x 48.26 x 15.24 cm) for one hour. 
Data was collected for analysis by VitalView software 
(Minimitter Corporation, Oregon, USA) and was binned 
into 4-month intervals beginning at month 4 and ending 
on month 24.
Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using multiple 
repeated measures ANOVAs and ANCOVAs with SPSS 
software. Post hoc analyses were done using Fisher’s LSD 
with significance level of 5% [α = 0.05].
