IMPORTANCE Traumatic intracranial bleeding, which is most commonly attributable to falls, is
a common concern among health care professionals, who are hesitant to prescribe oral
anticoagulants to older adults with atrial fibrillation.
OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of and risk factors for traumatic intracranial bleeding in
a large cohort of older adults who were newly prescribed warfarin sodium.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study at the US Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). Participants included 31 951 veterans with atrial fibrillation 75 years or
older who were new referrals to VA anticoagulation clinics (for warfarin therapy) between
January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2012. The dates of the core analysis were March 2014
through May 2015, and subsequent ad hoc analyses were performed through December
2015. Patients with comorbid conditions requiring warfarin were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was hospitalization for traumatic
intracranial bleeding. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for any intracranial
bleeding or ischemic stroke. We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification codes to identify the incidence rates of these outcomes after warfarin
initiation using VA administrative data (in-system hospitalizations) and Medicare
fee-for-service claims data (out-of-system hospitalizations). Clinical characteristics,
laboratory results, and pharmacy data were extracted from the VA electronic medical record.
For traumatic intracranial bleeding, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
determine predictors of interest selected a priori based on prior known associations.
RESULTS The study population comprised 31 951 participants. The mean (SD) patient age was
81.1 (4.1) years, and 98.1% were male. Comorbidities were common, including hypertension
(82.5%), coronary artery disease (42.6%), and diabetes mellitus (33.8%). During the study
period, the incidence rate of hospitalization for traumatic intracranial bleeding was 4.80 per
1000 person-years. In unadjusted models, significant predictors of traumatic intracranial
bleeding included dementia, fall within the past year, anemia, depression, abnormal renal or
liver function, anticonvulsant use, labile international normalized ratio, and antihypertensive
use. After adjusting for potential confounders, the remaining significant predictors for
traumatic intracranial bleeding were dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26-2.46),
anemia (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00-1.52), depression (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61), anticonvulsant
use (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-1.75), and labile international normalized ratio (HR, 1.33; 95% CI,
1.04-1.72). The incidence rates of hospitalization for any intracranial bleeding and ischemic
stroke were 14.58 and 13.44, respectively, per 1000 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients 75 years or older with atrial fibrillation initiating
warfarin therapy, the risk factors for traumatic intracranial bleeding are unique from those for
ischemic stroke. The high overall rate of intracranial bleeding in our sample supports the need to
more systematically evaluate the benefits and harms of warfarin therapy in older adults.

A
dvanced age is a powerful risk factor for thromboem-
bolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and
oral anticoagulation reduces this risk by almost two-
thirds in patients at risk.1,2 However, up to half of the eligible
olderadultswithAFarenottreatedwithanticoagulanttherapy
duetohealthcareprofessionals’concernsaboutpotentialtreat-
ment-related harms.3-5 Multiple studies4-9 have shown that a
primary concern among health care professionals is per-
ceivedfallriskandthesequelaeoftraumaticintracranialbleed-
ing, which can have devastating consequences. However, de-
spite such concerns, the incidence and determinants of this
outcome among older adults with AF who are prescribed oral
anticoagulants remain largely unknown. Most prior investi-
gations are small and report that the outcome is rare.10,11
Accordingly, we sought to investigate the long-term inci-
dence of and risk factors for traumatic intracranial bleeding
among a large cohort of older adults with AF after the initia-
tion of oral anticoagulation with warfarin sodium. To accom-
plish this end, we assembled a retrospective sample of
patients from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
health system, which contains key clinical variables not
available in many other large data sets, and then used
Medicare fee-for-service claims data to capture subsequent
out-of-system hospitalizations. We hypothesized that the
incidence rate of traumatic intracranial bleeding would be
higher than previously reported in clinical trials and that
selected known risk factors for falls and bleeding would
independently predict this event. As secondary outcomes,
we analyzed the incidence of any intracranial bleeding
(traumatic and nontraumatic) and ischemic stroke.
Methods
Data Sources
The VA is the largest integrated health system in the United
States and has a well-developed clinical information system
that has been used extensively for large-scale epidemiologic
investigations.12-16 For our study, we obtained VA medical and
administrativedatathroughtheVACorporateDataWarehouse,
includingoutpatientencountersandinpatienthospitalizations
(dates and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion,ClinicalModification[ICD-9-CM]codes),laboratoryresults,
and pharmacy dispensing. Because we anticipated that almost
our entire cohort would also be covered by Medicare17 and hos-
pitalized at non-VA institutions, we obtained Medicare enroll-
ment information and claims data (fee for service) for inpatient
hospital stays from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices through the VA Information Resource Center (Hines,
Illinois). Veterans’data were linked to Medicare claims data
using unique scrambled Social Security numbers.
Data were stored on VA Informatics and Computing Infra-
structureserversandanalyzedthroughasecurenetworkatthe
Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Informa-
tion Center (Boston, Massachusetts). Study approval and a
waiverofinformedconsentwereobtainedfrominstitutionalre-
view boards at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System
and the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System.
Study Sample
Because the risk of warfarin-related bleeding is highest im-
mediately after the initiation of therapy,18 we created an in-
ception cohort of veterans 75 years or older who were started
on warfarin therapy between January 1, 2002, and December
31, 2012. The dates of the core analysis were March 2014
through May 2015, and subsequent ad hoc analyses were per-
formed through December 2015. Ambulatory patients within
the VA system who are prescribed warfarin are followed up in
dedicated anticoagulation clinics, which can be identified by
an administrative “stop code” (code 317). These codes are used
to characterize the distinct types of services a patient re-
ceives during each VA encounter. We identified all patients for
whom this code was entered at least once within our study pe-
riod. Our index date was defined as the date of first warfarin
dispensing. Among this population, we then identified pa-
tients who had a diagnosis of AF (ICD-9-CM code 427.3) within
1 year before the index date (one inpatient or 2 outpatient en-
counters). To reduce the potential for out-of-system antico-
agulation clinic use, we also required that patients had to have
an international normalized ratio (INR) available at least ev-
ery 3 months between the time of their first and last warfarin
prescriptions. We also excluded patents with no INRs exceed-
ing 1.2 because it was unlikely that they actually took warfa-
rin. To ensure that patients were existing users of VA ser-
vices, we required at least 1 outpatient visit or outpatient
pharmacydispensingbetween6monthsand2yearsbeforefirst
warfarin dispensing.
Because risk-benefit considerations with anticoagulation
vary by condition, we excluded patients if the following con-
comitant diagnoses (ICD-9-CM codes) were also present: pul-
monary embolus (code 415.1), deep venous thrombosis (code
453.4), mechanical mitral valve (code 35.24 or V43.3), or
mechanical aortic valve (code 35.22 or V43.3) within 1 year
before first warfarin dispensing. Patients who were pre-
scribed direct oral anticoagulants available during the study
period (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) were also
excluded.
Derivation of the study cohort using the above criteria is
shown in Figure 1. Of 99 552 unique patients 75 years or older
with at least 1 warfarin prescription within the VA between
January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2012, a total of 42 838 had
AF, and 41 022 had AF without another diagnosis that would
require long-term anticoagulation. After applying the remain-
der of our exclusion criteria, our final sample included 31 951
patients.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was hospitalization for traumatic intra-
cranial bleeding, which was determined by the use of ICD-
9-CM codes entered for hospitalizations either within VA hos-
pitals(VAadministrativedata)oratoutsidehospitals(Medicare
fee-for-service claims data). The use of ICD-9-CM coding is a
previously accepted method of identifying hospitalizations
from large data sets.19,20 In claims data, ICD-9-CM codes for
intracranial bleeding are explicitly specified as traumatic or
nontraumatic. We selected our ICD-9-CM codes based on prior
studies10,21andconsensusamonganexpertpanelofhealthcare

professionals(J.A.D.,D.R.G.,M.E.T.,H.M.K.,andJ.M.G.)(eTable
1 in the Supplement). To increase the likelihood that these
events were attributable to falls, we excluded all patients with
a concomitant motor vehicle crash code (ICD-9 CM codes
E810.0-E819.9).22
Secondary outcomes included (1) hospitalization for any
intracranial bleeding (traumatic or nontraumatic) and (2) hos-
pitalization for ischemic stroke. To identify secondary out-
comes, we followed an algorithm using ICD-9-CM codes
entered at discharge (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Predictors and Covariates
Our predictors of interest were prespecified and based on prior
studiesshowinganassociationwitheitherfallsorbleeding.For
falls, we required that risk factors had to be reported in at least
2 independent studies22-28 and be available through adminis-
trative data. Our risk factors included dementia, arthritis, fall
withinthepastyear,visualimpairment,anemia,dizziness,dia-
betesmellitus,depression,lowbodymassindex,anxiolyticuse,
antipsychoticuse,anticonvulsantuse,antihypertensiveuse,and
polypharmacy (≥4 chronic medications). Our bleeding risk fac-
torswerebasedonthepreviouslyvalidatedHAS-BLEDmodel29
(hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, stroke, prior
bleeding, drug or alcohol use, labile INR, and age).
For medical conditions in our model, we used previously
validated ICD-9-CM coding algorithms12-14,30-32 when avail-
able (eTable 2 in the Supplement). For pharmacy variables, we
used categories within the VA pharmacy system.33 Patients
were classified as receiving a medication regimen if they had
a prescription within 6 months before cohort entry. Medica-
tion status was updated each month thereafter, with individu-
als counted as discontinuing medication if there was no refill
for 6 months after the supply of their prior fill ran out. For the
laboratory variable of abnormal renal or liver function (includ-
ing aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bil-
irubin, and creatinine), values were based on the most recent
available result within 6 months before cohort entry. For the
INR variable, we used the linear interpolation method by
Rosendaal et al,34 which assumes a linear relationship be-
tween 2 INRs and assigns a specific daily INR for each patient.
The mean time in therapeutic range (INR, 2.0-3.0) is then de-
termined. We initially divided time in therapeutic range into
the following 3 categories based on the classification scheme
by White et al35: poor control (<60%), moderate control (60%-
75%), and good control (>75%). We considered patients with
poor control as having labile INR.36
Statistical Analysis
We reported the incidence rate of our primary outcome (hos-
pitalization for traumatic intracranial bleeding) as the num-
ber of events per 1000 person-years. Patients were censored
at the time of hospitalization for a first event, or if they did not
experience an event, they were censored at death or at the end
of the study period (December 31, 2012). We then examined
bivariate associations between our predictors of interest and
covariates (described above) with the outcome. Subse-
quently,weusedCoxproportionalhazardsregressiontoevalu-
ate the independent association of our predictors of interest
with the outcome. In addition to adjusting for all prespeci-
fied predictors in this model, we adjusted for age, sex, self-
identified race/ethnicity, and common comorbidities (periph-
eral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure),
which were identified from ICD-9-CM codes entered within 1
year before patients’entry into the cohort (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Within our Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion model, medications were updated monthly, and time in
therapeutic range was updated every 3 months. These fac-
tors were treated as time-varying covariates. Otherwise, base-
line variables were used. We reported the strength of associa-
tions using hazard ratios (HRs) for point estimates with 95%
CIs. The proportional hazards assumption was tested for each
predictorinourmultivariablemodelandwasfoundtobevalid.
For purposes of clinical applicability, we then ran 2 separate
logisticregressionmodelsfortheoutcomesof1-yearand3-year
traumatic intracranial bleeding, including any variable with
P < .20 in unadjusted analyses. We reported C statistics for
these outcomes to evaluate model discrimination for the pre-
diction of traumatic intracranial bleeding at 1 year and 3 years.
For descriptive purposes, we also reported our primary
outcome without truncating patient follow-up at the time of
first event to account for repeated events in a single patient.
For our secondary outcomes (any intracranial bleeding and
ischemic stroke), to capture multiple events, we reported
the incidence rates without censoring patients after their
first event. For stroke, we also classified the observed rates
of stroke and traumatic intracranial bleeding based on pre-
dicted stroke risk using the CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart
failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus,
stroke/transient ischemic attack–vascular disease, age 65-74
years, female sex) score.37

Results
Study Cohort
Of the 31 951 patients in our final cohort, the mean (SD) age was
81.1 (4.1) years, 98.1% were male, and 8.4% were of nonwhite
race/ethnicity. Frequent comorbidities included hyperten-
sion (82.5%), coronary artery disease (42.6%), and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (25.5%). Polypharmacy was
common, with 87.0% of patients using at least 4 chronic medi-
cations. The mean (SD) time in therapeutic range for the en-
tire study sample was 55.5% (22.7%). Most patients (55.9%)
were classified as having labile INR. On average, among pa-
tients with labile INR, 42.7% of INRs were less than 2.0, 39.4%
were 2.0 to 3.0, and 17.9% were greater than 3.0. Other study
sample characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Primary Outcome
Over a median follow-up period of 2.97 years, the incidence
rate of traumatic intracranial bleeding was 4.80 per 1000 per-
son-years. More than three-quarters of events (76.0%) were
identified from Medicare claims data, and the remainder oc-
curred within the VA system. A Kaplan-Meier curve illustrat-
ing traumatic intracranial bleeding events over time is shown
in Figure 2. Based on the Weibull distribution (Weibull shape,
1.28,95%CI,1.27-1.29),therewasamodestincreaseinthehaz-
ardofthisoutcomeovertime.Theabsoluteeventratesfortrau-
matic intracranial bleeding were 0.54% at 1 year and 2.10% at
3 years. When we included multiple events per patient (with-
out censoring), the incidence rate of traumatic intracranial
bleeding was 6.16 per 1000 person-years.
In our unadjusted model, antihypertensive use was the
strongest risk factor for traumatic intracranial bleeding (HR,
2.63; 95% CI, 2.06-3.35), although this effect was no longer sig-
nificant after multivariable adjustment (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89-
1.49) (Table 2). Other significant risk factors included demen-
tia (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.53-2.92), fall within the past year (HR,
1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.44), anemia (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.65),
depression(HR,1.49;95%CI,1.22-1.82),abnormalrenalorliver
function (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.00-2.01), anticonvulsant use (HR,
1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.69), and labile INR (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10-
1.80).Afteradjustingforpotentialconfounders,dementia,ane-
mia, depression, anticonvulsant use, and labile INR re-
mained significant predictors, with the strongest association
seen with dementia (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26-2.46). The inci-
dence rates for traumatic intracranial bleeding were 3.36 per
1000 person-years in patients with none of these risk factors
(n = 9422)and6.38per1000person-yearsinthosewithatleast
2 risk factors (n = 9271). Using logistic regression models to
evaluate traumatic intracranial bleeding at 1 year and 3 years
and retaining risk factors with P < .20 in adjusted analyses, we
found that model discrimination was poor (C statistic, 0.55 at
both 1 year and 3 years).
Secondary Outcomes
The incidence rate of any intracranial bleeding (traumatic or
nontraumatic)was14.58per1000person-years.Morethanhalf
(57.2%) of the intracranial bleeding events were nontrau-
matic. Among the 1317 patients who experienced any intra-
cranial bleeding event, 407 (30.9%) had more than 1 episode.
Over the same period of observation, the incidence rate of is-
chemic stroke was 13.44 per 1000 person-years.

on CHA2DS2-VASc scores (2, 3-4, or ≥5), more than one-third

of patients (40.3%) fell into the category of very high stroke
risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score, ≥5). The observed rate of ische-
mic stroke per 1000 person-years increased as the CHA2DS2-
VASc score increased (rate of 4.59 for a score of 2, rate of 7.63
for a score of 3-4, and rate of 14.90 for a score of ≥5) (Figure 3).
Conversely, across CHA2DS2-VASc scores, the observed rate
of traumatic intracranial bleeding per 1000 person-years was
constant (rate of 3.85 for a score of 2, rate of 4.81 for a score of
3-4, and rate of 5.00 for a score of ≥5).
Discussion
To our knowledge, our study represents the largest investiga-
tion to date focused on traumatic intracranial bleeding among
older adults (≥75 years) initiating warfarin therapy for AF.
Amongthe31 951patientsinoursample,wefoundthattherate
of traumatic intracranial bleeding was 4.80 per 1000 person-
years. As expected, this rate was considerably higher than that
in previous clinical trials,38,39 but it was in line with a smaller
population estimate from Medicare beneficiaries previously
described by Gage et al.10 While we found that traumatic in-
tracranial bleeding was a less common event than ischemic
stroke,whenweanalyzedallintracranialbleedingevents(trau-
maticandnontraumatic),theratesweresimilar(13.44per1000
person-years for ischemic stroke and 14.58 per 1000 person-
years for any intracranial bleeding).
Identified Risk Factors for Traumatic Intracranial Bleeding
Several variables among those we analyzed placed patients at
increased risk of traumatic intracranial bleeding. Most nota-
bly, the presence of dementia was associated with a doubling
of risk, which was only mildly attenuated after adjusting for
other factors. Prior studies40,41 have shown that patients with
dementia are prescribed oral anticoagulants less frequently
than patients without dementia, presumably due to concerns
over harm or futility. Dementia is known from prior studies to
increase fall risk considerably. In a cohort of 2015 older adult
nursing home residents, the relative risk for dementia and falls
was 1.93 after adjusting for other characteristics.28 While not
all falls lead to traumatic intracranial bleeding, the presence
of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in dementia subtypes (eg,
Alzheimer disease) is known to increase bleeding risk,42 which
mayactsynergisticallywithfallstopredisposepatientstotrau-
maticintracranialbleeding.Otherfactors,suchasdifficultyfol-
lowingmedicationinstructionsordietarynoncompliance,may
also have a role through excessive anticoagulation or in-
creasedINRvariability.Inthiscontext,webelievethatourfind-
ings further support the perceived increased risk of warfarin
therapy in patients with dementia and can potentially be used
inindividualizeddiscussionswithpatientsandcaregiverswhen
considering the risk-benefit trade-off.
After multivariable adjustment, patients with labile INR
in our cohort were also more likely to experience traumatic in-
tracranial bleeding. This finding mirrors prior investigations
linking labile INR with all-cause bleeding.29,35 For example, a
study35 of patients enrolled in the SPORTIF (Stroke Preven-
tion Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation) III
and V trials found that patients with labile INR were more than
twice as likely to experience major bleeding as patients with
more than 75% of values within therapeutic range. The high
prevalence of labile INR among our population (55.9%) may
be in part due to advanced age. Studies have shown that older
patients have a greater anticoagulant response to warfarin de-
spite administration of a lower weight-related dose43 and re-
quire a longer period to return to therapeutic range when their
INR is supratherapeutic.44 In practice, there is considerable
variability in the effectiveness of warfarin management be-
tween health systems, and labile INR therefore represents a
potentially modifiable risk factor. The degree of therapeutic
warfarin values in our sample was similar to that in an inves-
tigation by Rose et al,45 who studied 124 551 veterans receiv-
ing warfarin over a 2-year period and found a mean time in
therapeuticrangeof58%,withvaluesrangingfrom38%to69%
at different sites. Other reports have shown considerably bet-
ter control of INR. For example, in the Swedish AuriculA reg-
istry, the mean time in therapeutic range among 18 391
patients was 76%.46

Based on the Weibull distribution
(Weibull shape, 1.28; 95% CI,

While the strength of association was lower for other in-
dependent risk factors, all have been shown in prior studies
to be associated with either falls or bleeding. For example, de-
pression may predispose patients to falling through daytime
sleepiness,impairedattention,orpsychomotorslowing.47Fur-
thermore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the most
commonly used antidepressants, have been shown to in-
crease bleeding risk.48 Anemia in older adults has been asso-
ciated with a doubling of fall risk,26 which may be due to its
associationwithfatigueandpoormusclestrength,andhasalso
been implicated as an independent risk factor for bleeding.49
The use of anticonvulsant medications has been associated
with fall-related fractures, possibly due to adverse effects of
dizziness or unsteady gait,50 as well as resistance to warfarin,
which may make it challenging to maintain INRs in therapeu-
tic range and place patients at risk for a rapid increase in INR
if the anticonvulsant is discontinued for any reason.51
Comparative Risk of Ischemic Stroke
Despite anticoagulation with warfarin, the rate of ischemic
stroke in our population (13.44 per 1000 person-years), was
more than twice as high as the rate of traumatic intracranial
bleeding. While this finding underscores the burden of
stroke in patients 75 years or older with AF, the difference
between our observed rates of ischemic stroke and trau-
matic intracranial bleeding was considerably less than that
reported in prior studies.10,11,52 For example, in the previ-
ously noted study of Medicare beneficiaries by Gage et al,10
the incidence of ischemic stroke was almost 7 times as com-
mon as traumatic intracranial bleeding. As expected, we
also found that the rate of ischemic stroke increased with
higher CHA2DS2-VASc score. However, there was no con-
comitant increase in the rate of traumatic intracranial bleed-
ing, which underscores that the risk factors for this outcome
are unique. In addition, as previously noted, the rate of any
intracranial bleeding (traumatic or nontraumatic) was simi-
lar to the rate of ischemic stroke. This observation high-
lights the difficult risk-benefit trade-off that health care pro-
fessionals and older patients face when considering
warfarin therapy.
Strength and Limitations
There are several strengths of our study, including our link-
age of VA data with Medicare claims data to capture out-of-
system hospitalizations as well as our ability to analyze vari-
ables that are unavailable in many other administrative data
sets. However, our findings must also be interpreted within
the limitations of our study design. First, we were unable to
analyze fall risk factors, such as slow gait or balance impair-
ment, which are generally not coded during routine clinic
visits.24,25 In addition, we could not precisely characterize
the severity of each risk factor, and certain risk factors of
interest (eg, problem drug or alcohol use) may have been
underidentified given our requirement that they were
explicitly coded during inpatient or outpatient visits. Sec-
ond, our study represents a single health care system with
an almost entirely male population; therefore, our findings
will need to be evaluated in other groups, including samples

with a larger proportion of women (in whom risk factors
may differ). Third, because we excluded patients who had
infrequent INRs due to the potential for incomplete data,
we may have excluded noncompliant patients with higher
bleeding risk. Similarly, we excluded patients with AF who
never received warfarin, and we cannot comment on bleed-
ing rates within this subset. Fourth, we were unable to cap-
ture information on hospitalizations for patients enrolled in
Medicare managed care. While only 23.1% of patients were
enrolled in one of these plans for more than 1 year during
the study period, we may still have underestimated the inci-
dence rates of our outcomes. Fifth, our study period pre-
dated the common use of direct oral anticoagulants. These
medications are increasingly used for stroke prevention in
AF and may have a different risk-benefit profile from that of
warfarin in older adults. For example, the reliable effect of
these medications, taken regularly, would obviate the labile
INR variable, which we found to be significantly associated
with bleeding risk. Therefore, we believe that the compara-
tive risk of direct oral anticoagulants vs warfarin, in the
context of traumatic intracranial bleeding among older
adults in clinical practice, warrants further investigation in
future observational studies.
Conclusions
In summary, we found that the rate of traumatic intracranial
bleedingamongolderadultswithAFinitiatingwarfarintherapy
washigherthanpreviouslyreportedinclinicaltrials.Aftermul-
tivariable adjustment, several factors placed patients at in-
creased risk of traumatic intracranial bleeding, including de-
mentia,anemia,depression,anticonvulsantuse,andlabileINR.
While we were unable to generate a clinical prediction tool to
evaluate risk given poor model discrimination, we still be-
lieve that the individual factors we identified may potentially
be used in patient-centered discussions about the benefits and
harms of warfarin therapy in older adults. Our findings should
be validated in other data sets, particularly given the under-
representation of women in our sample.
