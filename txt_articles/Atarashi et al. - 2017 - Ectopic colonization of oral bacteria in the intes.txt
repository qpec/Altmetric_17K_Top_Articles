Abstract
Intestinal colonization by bacteria of oral origin has been correlated with several negative health 
outcomes, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, a causal role of oral bacteria 
ectopically colonizing the intestine remains unclear. Using gnotobiotic techniques, we show that 
strains of Klebsiella spp. isolated from the salivary microbiota are strong inducers of T helper 1 
(TH1) cells when they colonize in the gut. These Klebsiella strains are resistant to multiple 
antibiotics, tend to colonize when the intestinal microbiota is dysbiotic, and elicit a severe gut 
inflammation in the context of a genetically susceptible host. Our findings suggest that the oral 
cavity may serve as a reservoir for potential intestinal pathobionts that can exacerbate intestinal 
disease.
The average person generates and ingests ∼1.5 liters of saliva per day, containing an 
enormous number of oral resident bacteria (1, 2). Ingested oral bacteria poorly colonize the 
healthy intestine (3); however, increased levels of microbes of oral origin have been reported 
in the gut microbiota of patients with several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) (4), HIV infection (5, 6), liver cirrhosis (7, 8), and colon cancer (9). For instance, oral 
bacteria, such as Veillonellaceae and Fusobacteriaceae, in the intestinal mucosal microbiota 
strongly correlates with disease status in Crohn's disease (CD) (4). Mining of our in-house 
datasets of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences revealed that several bacterial taxa
—including species belonging to Rothia, Streptococcus, Neisseria, Prevotella, and Gemella 
(Table S1A), all of which are aerotolerant and typically members of the oral microbiota—
were significantly more abundant in the fecal microbiota of patients with ulcerative colitis 
(UC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) being 
treated by long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy, and alcoholism, compared with that of 
healthy controls (Fig. 1A and table S1B). Thus, we hypothesized that a subset of oral 
microbiota may ectopically colonize and persist in the intestine under certain circumstances 
to aberrantly activate the intestinal immune system resulting in chronic inflammatory 
diseases.
To search the human oral microbiota for bacterial strains showing strong immune-
stimulatory activities upon intestinal colonization, we transplanted saliva samples from two 
patients with CD into C57BL/6 (B6) germ-free (GF) mice by gavage. Each group of mice 
was housed in separate gnotobiotic isolators for 6 weeks, at which time small intestinal and 
colonic lamina propria (LP) immune cells were examined. In mice receiving a saliva sample 
from CD patient #1 (GF+CD#1 mice), there were no significant changes in the intestinal T 
cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in the group that received a saliva sample from CD patient #2 
(GF+CD#2 mice), we noticed a marked accumulation of interferon-γ+ (IFN-γ+) CD4+ T 
cells [T helper 1 (TH1) cells] in the intestinal LP (Fig. 1B). Using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing, we compared the community composition of the saliva microbiota before 
administration into GF mice and the fecal microbiota of the colonized animals (Fig. 1C). 
Although the saliva samples of both patients contained similar microbial communities, the 
fecal microbiota compositions differed markedly between GF+CD#2 mice and GF+CD#1 
mice (Fig. 1C). Importantly, most of the bacterial species observed in the fecal microbiota of

 the mice had been minor components of the salivary microbiota (Fig. 1C). These results 
indicate that bacterial species that constitute a small fraction of the oral microbiota can 
expand and colonize the gut, and a subset of these oral species can induce the accumulation 
of intestinal TH1 cells.
To isolate TH1-cell-inducing bacteria, we anaerobically cultured cecal contents from GF
+CD#2 mice using several culture media and picked 224 colonies with different colony 
appearances. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes revealed that these colonies contained 
eight strains from diverse genera, including Gemella, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, 
Escherichia, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Anaerococcus, and Klebsiella, and broadly 
represented the major members of the gut microbiota colonizing GF+CD#2 mice (Fig. 1C). 
To examine whether these isolated strains had TH1 cell-inducing capability, we cultured all 
eight of them and introduced them as a mixture (8-mix) into GF mice. We observed efficient 
induction of TH1 cells in the colonic LP of these mice, with a magnitude comparable to that 
observed in GF+CD#2 mice (compare Fig. 1B and D). Because Fusobacterium and 
Veillonella have been implicated in IBD pathogenesis (4), we colonized mice with these two 
strains (strain IDs Fu-21f and Ve-2E1, respectively); however, this resulted in only marginal 
elevation of TH1 cell frequency (Fig. 1D). We tested Klebsiella pneumoniae 2H7 (Kp-2H7) 
because it was the most prominent component of the GF+CD#2 microbiota (Fig. 1C). Oral 
administration of Kp-2H7 alone significantly induced TH1 cells, whereas a mixture of the 
remaining seven strains (7-mix) failed to do so (Fig. 1D), indicating that the Kp-2H7 strain 
was the major contributor to the accumulation of TH1 cells observed in GF+CD#2 mice. 
The effect of Kp-2H7 was relatively specific for TH1 cells (fig. S1A), which were negative 
for interleukin-17 (IL-17), RORγt, and Foxp3 but positive for T-bet and CD44 (fig. S1B). 
Kp-2H7 mainly colonized the colon and cecum (fig. S1C), reflecting greater TH1 cell 
induction in the colon than in the small intestine (fig. S1D). There was no increase in the 
percentage of TH1 cells in the oral tissues (palate and tongue) of B6 GF+Kp-2H7 mice (fig. 
S1E). The increase in TH1 cells was observed in IQI/Jic mice and B6 mice, but not in 
BALB/c mice (fig. S1F), implying interplay between host genotype and Kp-2H7 for colonic 
TH1 cell induction.
Klebsiella spp. often acquire resistance to multiple antibiotics and can be a cause of 
healthcare–associated infection (10-12). Our isolate Kp-2H7 was resistant to multiple 
antibiotics, including ampicillin (Amp), tylosin (Tyl), spectinomycin (Spc), and 
metronidazole (MNZ) (fig. S2). Specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice were untreated or 
continuously treated with Amp, Tyl, Spc, or MNZ in drinking water starting 4 days before 
oral gavage with Kp-2H7. Antibiotic-naïve mice were resistant to colonization by Kp-2H7, 
but Amp or Tyl treatment allowed Kp-2H7 to persist in the intestine (Fig. 1E). Persistent 
colonization with Kp-2H7 was accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of 
colonic TH1 cells (Fig. 1F). In contrast to Amp and Tyl treatments, MNZ and Spc treatments 
did not allow Kp-2H7 colonization, although the Kp-2H7 strain is resistant to both of these 
antibiotics (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that antibiotic exposure potentiates orally derived 
Kp-2H7 colonization by disrupting the colonization resistance provided by specific members 
of the gut microbiota that are Amp- and Tyl-sensitive but MNZ- and Spc-resistant.

 Despite induction of TH1 cells, Kp-2H7 colonization did not induce any inflammatory 
changes in the intestine of wild-type (WT) hosts—either GF mice or Amp-treated SPF mice 
(Fig. 1G to I, and fig. S3, A and B). Because microbial and host genetic factors both 
contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD (13), we tested the influence of Kp-2H7 colonization 
in colitis-prone Il10-/- mice. GF WT and GF Il10-/- mice were orally administered Kp-2H7, 
Escherichia coli 2B1 (Ec-2B1), or a mixture of the six other strains (6-mix). K. pneumoniae 
and E. coli are both in the family Enterobacteriaceae, which has been implicated in IBD 
pathogenesis (4, 14). One week after colonization, more potent induction of colonic TH1 
cells was observed in Il10-/-+Kp-2H7 mice than in the other groups of mice (fig. S3C). In 
addition, there was a greater induction of colonic LP IL-17+IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells (fig. S3C) 
and epithelial tumor necrosis factor–α mRNA expression (fig. S3D) in the Il10-/-+Kp-2H7 
mice. Histological analysis revealed that Kp-2H7 induced more severe inflammation than 
Ec-2B1 or the 6-mix in the proximal colon of Il10-/- mice (Fig. 1, G to I, and fig. S3E). 
Colitis exacerbation was similarly observed in Amp-treated SPF Il10-/- mice colonized with 
Kp-2H7 (fig. S3, A and B). These results suggest that Kp-2H7 acts as a gut pathobiont in the 
context of a genetically susceptible host. When Kp-2H7 was intratracheally injected into the 
lung, a TH17 response predominated over a TH1 response in lung T cells, consistent with 
previous reports (15, 16), and this response was accompanied by severe lung pathology, even 
in genetically normal mice (fig. S4). Therfore, the effect of Kp-2H7 on TH1 induction thus 
appears to be a gut-specific response.
To investigate the mechanism of Kp-2H7–mediated TH1 cell induction, we orally 
administered heat-killed Kp-2H7 to GF WT B6 mice in drinking water for 3 weeks. Heat-
killed bacteria had no effect on the frequency of TH1 cells (Fig. 2A). Fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) of the colon of mice colonized with Kp-2H7 revealed the presence of 
Kp-2H7 on the mucus layer, with no evidence of adhesion or invasion of bacteria on or into 
the epithelial layer (Fig. 2B). Phylogenetically distinct human, mouse, and environmental K. 
pneumoniae strains (fig. S5A and Table S2) showed considerable variability in the ability to 
elicit colonic TH1 cell induction when monocolonized in B6 WT mice (Fig. 2C). In 
particular, KCTC2242 and BAA2552 did not affect, or only weakly affected, TH1 cell 
frequency. The intensity of induction was independent of bacterial load and was not 
accompanied by inflammation (fig. S5B). There was no correlation between TH1 cell 
induction and multilocus sequence typing, K-typing, orphylogeny (fig. S5A and Table S2). 
Comparative analysis of the whole genomes revealed that 61 orthologous groups of genes 
were positively correlated with the TH1 induction ability, including genes predicted to 
encode hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) and enzymes involved in fructose-, galactitol-, 
mannose-, and long-chain fatty acid–related uptake and metabolic pathways (Fig. 2D and 
Table S3). These genes have been reported to be enriched in the fecal microbiome of 
patients with inflammatory diseases and have been suggested to have immunomodulatory 
effects, and they thereby may contribute to the induction of TH1 cells (8, 14, 17-19).
Mice deficient in basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 3 (Batf3-/-), which lack 
the intestinal CD11b-CD103+ dendritic cell (DC) subset, failed to mount a colonic TH1 cell 
response (Fig. 2E). Assessment of the antigen specificity of colonic TH1 cells induced by 
Kp-2H7 revealed that a substantial fraction recognized Klebsiella antigens (fig. S6), 
including OmpX (outer membrane protein X) (20). Colonic TH1 induction by Kp-2H7

 monocolonization was significantly suppressed in Myd88-/- and Myd88-/-Trif-/- mice and 
partially attenuated in Tlr4-/- mice and Il18-/- mice, but occurred normally in Il1r1-/- mice 
(Fig. 2, F and G). Increased production of IL-18 by colonic epithelial cells (ECs) was 
detected after monocolonization with Kp-2H7 (fig. S6B). Together these results suggest 
contributions from Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IL-18 signaling to the DC-mediated 
Klebsiella antigen-specific TH1 cell induction.
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data for colonic ECs and CD11c+ DCs isolated from WT mice 
monocolonized with Kp-2H7 or BAA2552 for 1 week, and from WT, Myd88-/-, 
Myd88-/-Trif-/-, and Tlr4-/- mice monocolonized with Kp-2H7 for 3 weeks, were compared 
with data for GF mice (Fig. 2H and fig. S7 and S8). IFN-inducible (IFI) genes—such as 
those encoding guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 
(Cxcl9), major histocompatibility complex–related molecules (MHCs; e.g., H2-DMb1, H2-
Ab1 and Tap1), and dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) were significantly upregulated in colonic ECs 
and DCs from GF WT+Kp-2H7 mice. Expression differences were confirmed by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis (fig. S9A). The upregulation of IFI 
genes in colonic ECs of GF+Kp-2H7 mice began within 3 days of colonization (fig. S9B), 
when TH1 induction was limited (fig. S9C). Bacteria-free cecal suspensions from GF
+Kp-2H7 mice upregulated IFI genes in a colonic EC line in vitro (fig. S10), suggesting 
direct effects of bacterial products on the induction of IFI genes. In the later phase of 
Kp-2H7 colonization, IFI genes were further upregulated, coinciding with the increase of 
TH1 cells (fig. S9, A to C). GBPs are known to function as microbial receptors (21). MHCs 
and Cxcl9 mediate development and recruitment of TH1 cells. Duox2 mediates production 
of hydrogen peroxide, which may facilitate further colonization of reactive oxygen–tolerant 
Klebsiella spp (22, 23). IFN-γ receptor 1-deficient (IFNγR1-/-) mice mounted a defective 
TH1 cell response upon colonization with Kp-2H7 (Fig. 2I). These results suggest that a 
feed forward loop involving IFN-γ and IFIs was created among ECs, DCs and T cells for 
sustained accumulation of TH1 cells.
To confirm the link between oral-derived bacteria and TH1 cell induction, we obtained 
additional saliva samples from two healthy donors (He#1 and He#2) and two patients with 
active UC (UC#1 and UC#2) and orally administered these samples to GF WT B6 mice. 
TH1 cells accumulated in the colonic LP of mice inoculated with a saliva sample from UC 
patient #2 (GF+UC#2 mice), comparably to the accumulation observed in GF+CD#2 mice 
(Fig. 3A). We cultured cecal contents from GF+UC#2 mice and isolated 13 strains, which 
resembled the microbiota composition of GF+UC#2 mice (Fig. 3B). Oral administration of 
the 13 strains (13-mix) into GF mice fully replicated the phenotype observed in GF+UC#2 
mice in terms of colonic TH1-cell induction (Fig. 3C). Among the 13 strains, Enterococcus 
faecium 11A1 (Ef-11A1) and Klebsiella aeromobilis 11E12 (Ka-11E12) drew our attention, 
because both species have been implicated in IBD pathogenesis and reported to be important 
multidrug-resistant pathobionts (24-27). GF mice were gavaged either with Ef-11A1, 
Ka-11E12, or a mixture of the 11 other strains (11-mix). Ka-11E12 induced TH1 cells in the 
colon comparably to the 13-mix, whereas Ef-11A1 and the 11-mix failed to do so (Fig. 3C). 
Therefore, Ka-11E12 was most likely the major driver for the induction of TH1 cells 
observed in GF+UC#2 mice, even as a minor member of the gut microbiota (Fig. 3B). 
Ka-11E12 was also resistant to multiple antibiotics (fig. S11, A and B) and persisted in the

 intestine of vancomycin- or Tyl-treated SPF mice (Fig. 3D). Ka-11E12 colonization resulted 
in severe inflammation in Il10-/- mice (fig. S11, C and D, and Fig. 3E), suggesting that the 
orally derived K. aeromobilis strain may act similarly to Kp-2H7. Likewise, Ka-11E12 did 
not attach to the EC surface as shown by FISH (Fig. 3F). However, genome sequence 
analysis and electron microscopy (EM) revealed that, in contrast to Kp-2H7, Ka-11E12 had 
a flagellar assembly system (Table S4 and fig. S12A) and was highly motile and stimulatory 
for TLR5 (fig. S12, B and C). Therefore, distinct mechanisms may drive TH1 cell induction 
by different Klebsiella strains.
Somewhat unexpectedlly, the microbiota sample from one healthy donor (He#1) also 
induced a substantial increase in TH1 cells (Fig. 3A). In this case, the fecal microbiome 
contained a K. pneumoniae sequence. We isolated a K. pneumoniae strain, Kp-40B3 (Fig. 
3B). This strain, Kp-40B3, induced marked TH1 cell accumulation in the colon of 
monocolonized mice (Fig. 3G). Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that Kp-40B3 
possessed several genes that correlated with Kp-2H7-mediated TH1 cell induction (Fig. 2D). 
These results suggest that Klebsiella spp. with TH1 cell induction capability may exist in the 
oral cavity of not only IBD patients but also healthy humans.
We mined the 16S rRNA gene sequencing datasets used in the analysis in Fig. 1A and found 
that the relative abundance of members of Klebsiella was significantly higher in patients 
with CD (P=0.0157), PSC (P=0.0309), and alcoholism (P<0.0001) compared with that in 
healthy controls (Fig. 4A). We extended our analysis to the metagenome databases of 
intestinal microbiota of IBD patients and non-IBD controls from the Prospective Registry in 
IBD Study at Massachusetts General Hospital (PRISM) (14), and the CD cohort from the 
University of Pennsylvania (UPenn cohort) (28). The aggregated relative abundance of 
Klebsiella species was significantly higher in patients with IBD (P<0.01) (Fig. 4B). The 
genes that were correlated with Kp-2H7–mediated TH1 induction (Fig. 2D) were enriched in 
the fecal microbiome of IBD patients who carried Klebsiella species, but not in non-IBD 
individuals (Fig. 4, C and D; P=0.00988, Mann-Whitney U test).
Ectopic colonization of the colon by orally derived Klebsiella spp. is associated with 
aberrant activation of the immune system. The lower gastrointestinal tract is the expected 
niche for Klebsiella spp., where they constitute a minor population that can proliferate after 
antibiotic treatment and other conditions (24). Our data suggest that the oral cavity may 
serve as another reservoir for Klebsiella pathobionts. Indeed, the oral microbiota contains 
the highest relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae compared with other mucosal sites 
(29). The inflammatory state in IBD may render the intestine more permissive to 
aerotolerant oral-derived bacteria than the steady-state intestine, and ongoing colonization 
by oral bacteria may help perpetuate gut microbiota dysbiosis and chronic inflammation. 
Overrepresentation of Klebsiella spp. in the gut microbiota, coupled with elevated levels of 
serum antibodies against Klebsiella antigens, has been reported in patients with IBD (30, 
31). In mouse models of IBD, such as T-bet-/-Rag2-/- mice, K. pneumoniae is known to 
proliferate and play an important role in triggering disease (32). Furthermore, persistence of 
Klebsiella spp. is also observed in several other diseases (Fig. 4A) (33). Thus, our findings 
indicate that targeting oral-derived bacteria, particularly Klebsiella, could provide a 
therapeutic strategy to correct IBD and many other disease conditions.

 Our results highlight the disease potential of antibiotic resistant, pro-inflammatory 
Klebsiella in chronic human disease. K. pneumoniae and K. aeromobilis commonly cause 
hospital infections (10-12, 24, 25). Our isolates were resistant to several antibiotics, and 
treatment with antibiotics allowed their colonization in the intestine of SPF mice. The 
colonization efficiency of Kp-2H7 and Ka-11E12 varied, depending on the spectrum of 
antibiotics used as treatment. Therefore, identifying members of the normal gut microbiota 
that can provide colonization resistance against orally derived bacteria could foster future 
avenues for the development of effective treatments for multidrug-resistant bacteria and 
chronic inflammation.

sequence similarity (96% identity), and the relative abundance of OTUs and closest known 
species for each OTU are shown. OTUs corresponding to the eight isolated strains are 
marked in green. (D) The percentage of TH1 cells in the colonic LP of exGF B6 mice 
colonized with 8-mix, Fu-21f+Ve-2E1, Kp-2H7, 7-mix, or Ec-2B1. (E and F) SPF B6 mice 
were untreated (Cont) or continuously treated with antibiotics in drinking water, starting 4 
days before oral administration of 2 × 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of Kp-2H7. The 
relative abundance of Kp-2H7 DNA over time in fecal samples was determined by qPCR 
(E). The percentage of TH1 cells among colonic LP CD4+ cells was analyzed by flow 
cytometry on day 21 after Kp-2H7 administration (F). Amp, ampicillin; Tyl, tylosin; Spc, 
spectinomycin; MNZ, metronidazole. (G to I) Representative hematoxylin and eosin
