Levels of maternal care in dogs 
affect adult offspring temperament
Pernilla Foyer1,2, Erik Wilsson3 & Per Jensen1
Dog puppies are born in a state of large neural immaturity; therefore, the nervous system is sensitive 
to environmental influences early in life. In primates and rodents, early experiences, such as maternal 
care, have been shown to have profound and lasting effects on the later behaviour and physiology of 
offspring. We hypothesised that this would also be the case for dogs with important implications for 
the breeding of working dogs. In the present study, variation in the mother-offspring interactions of 
German Shepherd dogs within the Swedish breeding program for military working dogs was studied 
by video recording 22 mothers with their litters during the first three weeks postpartum. The aim was 
to classify mothers with respect to their level of maternal care and to investigate the effect of this care 
on pup behaviour in a standardised temperament test carried out at approximately 18 months of age. 
The results show that females differed consistently in their level of maternal care, which significantly 
affected the adult behaviour of the offspring, mainly with respect to behaviours classified as Physical 
and Social Engagement, as well as Aggression. Taking maternal quality into account in breeding 
programs may therefore improve the process of selecting working dogs.
Early experiences affect the phenotypic, genomic and behavioural traits of the adult animals, as has been shown 
by a range of studies in different species. For example, Levine et al.1, showed that previously maternally separated 
adult rats were less reactive, more explorative and more emotionally stable compared with controls and also 
exhibited lower plasma corticosterone levels over time. In altricial species, offspring are born in a state of high 
neural immaturity, and the nervous system rapidly develops via an intense synaptogenesis2, during which envi-
ronmental influences can have a profound and lasting effect on an animal’s behaviour3. In mammals, the neonatal 
period is also a time of significant social interaction, so it is an important time for the development of social 
behaviour4, as well as the stress response5.
Early postnatal handling by humans has important long-term consequences in rodents, which have inspired 
numerous experiments. It is clear that the most important effects of neonatal handling are primarily due to the 
fact that human handling induces increased maternal care5,6. For example, Caldji et al.7, showed that responses 
to novelty and restraint differed among rat offspring according to the amount of maternal care received, which is 
measured as low and high levels of licking/grooming and arched-back nursing (LG-ABN). In this study, the adult 
offspring of low LG-ABN mothers showed an increased startle response, decreased open-field exploratory behav-
iour and a longer latency for eating food in a novel arena. Cross-fostering studies have also shown that individual 
differences in fearfulness and maternal care of the offspring can be a function of the behaviour of the rearing 
mother rather than the biological mother8,9. It has been proposed that the mother provides primary environmen-
tal cues to her young during the early postnatal period, thereby adaptively modifying their behaviour with respect 
to their predicted future environment10. Hence, postpartum experiences can alter neurological development11 
and be important in the shaping of the physiological and behavioural stress response in rodents9.
In other mammalian species such as prairie voles12, monkeys13,14, and sheep15, early mother-offspring interac-
tions affect offspring behaviour. If similar effects exist in dogs, they may have considerable consequences for dog 
breeding. Dogs are bred for various types of work purposes, and the selection programs are mostly based on the 
evaluation of behaviour post puberty, which is based on the assumption that genetic factors explain most of the 
variance in adult behaviour16. However, heritability studies have revealed only a small contribution of genetics 
to the phenotypic variation17–19, and aspects of the rearing environment have been found to exert clear effects on 
adult behaviour20. Therefore, it is possible that early experiences and variation in maternal care may be at least as 
important as genetics.

In this study, records and observations of 22 litters of German Shepherd dogs bred to work in the Swedish 
Armed Forces (SAF) were analysed to evaluate variations in maternal care and their effects on behaviour and tem-
perament in puppies at approximately one and a half years of age. We carried out detailed behaviour recordings 
during the suckling periods and obtained the adult behavioural traits from a standardised temperament evalua-
tion test (SAF T-test) used by the SAF as an instrument for selecting suitable military working dogs (MWD). The 
SAF has conducted their German Shepherd breeding program since 2005. To date, approximately 30% have been 
approved to work as MWDs or within the police force. Most dogs are rejected because their temperament profiles 
do not fit the needs of the Armed Forces, but some are also rejected for medical reasons. Because of the relative 
large number of rejected dogs due to temperamental mismatch and a possible link between early experiences and 
later temperament, we investigated the effects of early maternal care on the behaviour of adult dogs.
The aim of this study was to assess individual differences in maternal care and examine their impact on the 
behaviour and temperament of the young. We hypothesised that the degree and quality of maternal care would 
vary between dogs in a consistent manner during the suckling period and that more maternal care would lead to 
more confident, less reactive and more explorative puppies.
Methods
Observations of mother-pup interactions were conducted on 22 different litters (a total of 94 pups: 42 males and 
52 females) through continuous video recordings for three weeks postpartum. The results from the later evalu-
ation of the offspring using the standardised temperament test (SAF T-test) were retrieved from the SAF Dog 
Training database.
Ethical note. 
All of the experiments performed by us in this study were conducted in accordance with the 
approved guidelines of the Regional ethical committee for animal experiments in Linköping, Sweden (Permit 
number: 51–13).
Subjects. 
All of the dogs in this study, 22 females and their litters, were from a population of outbred German 
Shepherds, bred as part of the Swedish Armed Forces selective dog-breeding program between 2011 and 2013. 
The females were between 2 and 8 years old (parity/number of previous litters; 1–4), and the litter sizes var-
ied from 1 to 10 (average 5 ± 
 2,3 s.e.m). None of the dogs lived permanently at the kennel situated in Sollefteå, 
Sweden; the females lived in private foster homes across Sweden and arrived at the kennel approximately three 
weeks before the estimated whelping day.
For the first week at the kennel, the females were housed separately in 4.5-m2 quarantine rooms connected to a 
13.5-m2 outdoor enclosure. They were then transferred to the 9-m2 whelping room, where they were individually 
housed until the pups were born. All of the whelping rooms had a window that admitted natural light, and direct 
access to a 9-m2 outdoor enclosure. During housing at the kennel facility, the females received food four times a 
day (07.30, 11.00, 14.00 and 19.20). Water was offered ad libitum, and light was automatically turned on at approx-
imately 07.00 in the morning and switched off at approximately 20.00 at night. Walks on leash with a handler 
were undertaken three times a day, and the rooms were cleaned once a day during the morning walks. Females 
stayed with their pups until they were weaned at the age of eight weeks. At that time, both females and pups were 
allocated to separate foster homes. Pups were later brought back at 15–20 months of age for evaluation. Approved 
dogs were kept for further training, whereas non-approved dogs were sold as companion dogs.
Whelping was monitored via a video link in a nearby room. In the whelping room, there was a 1.0*1.0*0.3-m 
puppy box equipped with a bar and a detachable front. The flooring in the box was a soft bed (Vetbed) and a lino-
leum carpet covered the floor of the room. The temperature was kept at 21 degrees Celsius. The front of the whelp-
ing box was detached at the end of the third week, and the pups were allowed access to the entire room. At the 
same time, females received access to twice the space via an elevated interconnection to an identical room next 
door, and they had access to a wall-mounted elevated shelf. Pups were weighed every week and were vaccinated 
in accordance with current recommendations. Beginning in the third week, pups were allowed access to solid 
food, and from six weeks of age, they were allowed daily visits to an enriched area, either indoors or outdoors 
depending on the season and weather. Pups were also taken for car rides and walks in the woods during their stay 
at the kennel as a part of their socialisation.
Recording Procedure of Mother-Pup Interaction. 
Behaviour was recorded continuously for all litters 
from birth until three weeks of age with a surveillance camera (Sony SNCRZ25N PTZ with IR-led for night 
vision), and video files were stored for later scoring and analysis offline. Behavioural recordings were done con-
tinuously for every second hour over a 24-h period once per week while the pups were mainly confined to the pup 
box (before they became mature enough to move around and the front wall of the puppy box was detached), i.e., 
the first, seventh, 14th and 21st day postpartum. This observation schedule provided 12 h of continuous recordings 
per observation day for each female and her litter. For technical reasons, the last recording (three-weeks old pups) 
was performed on day 18 in one case, on day 19 in two cases, and on day 20 in three cases.
The variables recorded were:
* Mother in Box: the time in seconds during which the mother had both of her front legs in the pup box.
*  
Lying in contact: the time in seconds during which the mother was lying in the pup box with elbows on the 
ground and in physical contact (tail and limbs excluded) with at least one pup.
* Nursing: Duration in seconds of nursing bouts with at least one pup lined up at the udder.
* Licking: Duration in seconds spent licking pups.
* Sniff/Poke: Frequency of sniffing, poking or moving a pup around with her nose.

All variables except for Mother in Box were divided by litter size, so the actual measurements analysed were 
the durations and frequencies per pup in each litter.
Videos were decoded by four different people with the largest proportion (16/22) of videos decoded by one 
person (first author). Inter-observer reliability was determined by 3 × 
 20-min of video samples for each observer 
(i.e., all observers re-coded the same samples). Inter-observer reliability between the main observer and the others 
was 89% on average, ranging from 100% (max) for Mother in box and Lying in contact, to 65% (min) for Licking.
Because it was not possible to reliably distinguish each individual pup in the videos, the litter was treated as 
the observation unit. In later analyses, every member of a litter was therefore assigned the same scores for the 
maternal care received.
Temperament Test. 
At 15–18 months of age, all dogs reared by the mothers included in the study were 
called in from their foster homes and subjected to the standardised temperament test used by the Swedish Armed 
Forces (SAF T-test) in the selection process for prospective MWDs. The tests were carried out at five different 
sites: Ronneby, Säve, Märsta, Solleftå and Luleå, and the dogs were brought to the test site by their foster families 
in private cars a few hours before the start of the test.
Details of the test methods are described in Wilsson and Sinn21. Briefly, the SAF T-test consists of 12 different 
sub-tests, which evaluate the dogs’ reactions to a range of situations, from social interactions and co-operation 
with humans to potentially frightening stimuli such as loud noises or suddenly appearing dummies. The dogs 
were assessed using a Behavioural Rating (BR) protocol including 25 behavioural variables. Each variable was 
scored by the same experienced test leader for all dogs on a scale ranging from 1–5 (see Wilsson and Sinn (2012) 
for details about scoring). During the test, a handler, usually a member of the foster family accompanied the dogs 
and was guided by a test leader.
Statistical analysis. 
Differences in Maternal Care. For the behavioural recordings of the mother-pup inter-
actions (MPI), a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the five variables from the ethogram. 
We first performed a PCA for the aggregated values for each mother, i.e., the sum of each variable during the four 
observation days (referred to as Total MPI). Secondly, separate PCAs were done for each of the four sampling days 
(termed MPI1-MPI4), and sampling adequacy was tested. The correlation matrix for the behavioural recordings 
was considered appropriate for PCA in all cases (Total MPI; Bartlett´s sphericity χ 
2 (10) = 
 133.1, P < 
 0.001; 
KMO = 
 0.760, MPI1; Bartlett´s sphericity χ 
2 (10) = 
 109.7, P < 
 0.001; KMO = 
 0.771, MPI2; Bartlett´s sphericity 
χ 
2 (10) = 
 102.5, P < 
 0.001; KMO = 
 0.578, MPI3; Bartlett´s sphericity χ 
2 (10) = 
 103.1, P < 
 0.001; KMO = 
 0.685, 
and MPI4; Bartlett´s sphericity χ 
2 (10) = 
 97.9, P < 
 0.001; KMO = 
 0.780). Based on the PCAs, PC-scores, which 
are referred to as MPI-scores, were assigned to each mother.
To examine the individual consistency in MPI-scores between the four different measurement days, Pearson 
correlation coefficients were calculated for MPI1-MPI4. To examine the individual differences in maternal care, 
the mothers were divided into two equally sized groups according to their Total MPI score (high and low Total 
MPI scores), and the means and standard deviations of the five different behavioural variables described above 
were calculated separately for each group and observation day. Independent samples t-tests were used to calculate 
the differences in the maternal behaviour variables between the groups.
To investigate which factors that may have affected the Total MPI score, generalized linear models were 
used. The Total MPI score was used as the response variable, and Parity, Sex-ratio, Litter Size and Trimester of 
Birth (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December) were used as predictors. Significant 
effects were only observed for Litter size, so the other variables were dropped from the model in subsequent 
analyses. The probability distribution used was “Normal”
, and the link function was “Identity”; significance levels 
were determined with a Wald chi-squared test with adequate degrees of freedom. An omnibus (likelihood ratio 
chi-square) test was used to determine the performance of the model versus the intercept, and this was deemed 
acceptable when the significance level was below 0.05.
Effects of Maternal Care on Offspring Temperament. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce 
25 behaviour variables in the standardised temperament test, and the primary factor solution was rotated using 
the Oblimin with Kaiser normalisation method. Sampling adequacy was tested, and the correlation matrix for 
the behaviour recordings was considered appropriate for PCA (Bartlett´s sphericity χ 
2
(300) = 
 920.9, P < 
 0.001; 
KMO = 
 0.697).
For the statistical analysis of the relationship between Total MPI score and the behavioural responses in the 
SAF T-test, we used generalized linear models and the average factor scores of the members in a litter from each 
of the extracted factors from the SAF T-test as response variables. Hence, the litter was considered to be the 
statistical unit. As predictors, we used Parity, Sex-ratio, Litter Size, Trimester of Birth and the Total MPI score. 
Starting with the least significant values, predictors were removed one by one until only significant predictors 
were left in the model. Because there was only a significant effect of parity for PC2, this predictor was only kept 
for PC2. The probability distribution used was “Normal”
, and the link function was “Identity”
. Significance levels 
were determined with the Wald chi-squared test with adequate degrees of freedom, and an omnibus (likelihood 
ratio chi-squared) test was used to compare the performance of the model versus the intercept. Performance was 
deemed acceptable when the significance level was below 0.05, which was the case for all of the results reported 
here. Results are reported as estimated marginal means with their standard errors. All data were analysed using 
SPSS 22.0.

Results
Differences in Maternal Care. 
The principal component analysis of the behavioural maternal care data 
revealed just one factor with eigenvalues greater than one, which explained 80.0% of the variance (N = 
 22) 
(Table 1). The factor score was termed Total Mother-Pup Interaction (Total MPI).
The individual females were highly individually consistent in their maternal behaviour over time, and the 
Pearson correlation for the MPI1-MPI4 scores for the different sampling days ranged from 0.841–0.965 (N = 
 22, 
P < 
 0.001). Furthermore, as measured by their Total MPI score, the females clearly differed from each other in 
the amount of maternal behaviour they performed. When dividing the mothers into two groups based on their 
Total MPI score, there was a clear difference between the high and low MPI groups with regard to all five different 
variables, and all maternal behaviours declined steadily over the four days of recording (Fig. 1). However, the 
differences on day one were not significant for any variable, and all of the females spent most of their time with 
their litters on the first day post partum.
Mothers in the high MPI score group showed significantly more maternal behaviour than the low score 
group for Mother in Box (37.0 ± 
 2.4 vs. 27.6 ± 
 4.3, t(20) = 
 6.26, P < 
 0.000), Lying in Contact (9.5 ± 
 5.3 vs. 3.7 ± 
 1.2, 
t(20) = 
 3.53, P = 
 0.005) and Nursing (6.9 ± 
 2.2 vs. 3.4 ± 
 1.1, t(20) = 
 4.80, P < 
 0.000). Licking and Sniff/Poke did 
not differ significantly between the high and low MPI litters (1.0 ± 
 1.2 vs. 0.3 ± 
 0.1, t(20) = 
 1.89, P = 
 0.073, and 
451.0 ± 
 431 vs. 217 ± 
 93, t(20) = 
 1.76, P = 
 0.094, respectively).
Total MPI score was significantly affected by Litter size (Wald’s X2(1) = 
 10.7; P = 
 0.001). Females with small 
litters (N = 
 1–5 pups/litter) had higher Total MPI scores than large litters (N = 
 6–10 pups/litter): 0.51 ± 
 0.23 vs. 
− 
0.61 ± 
 0.25, respectively.
Effects of Maternal Care on Offspring Temperament. 
The principal component analysis of the behav-
ioural data from the SAF T-test revealed eight factors with eigenvalues greater than one, which together explained 
73.6% of the variance (N = 
 76). Based on the coherence with the results from earlier studies of similar data-
sets20–22, and a PC loading of 0.5 or higher as an arbitrary criterion for a variable to be considered relevant to the 
interpretation of a specific PC, we decided to consider the first four factors and name them according to previous 
studies; Confidence, Physical Engagement, Social Engagement and Aggression (Table 2). Together, the four fac-
tors explained 53.1% of the variance.
There was a significant relationship between Total MPI score and Physical Engagement, Social Engagement 
and Aggression, but no significant association was found between Total MPI score and Confidence in the off-
spring (Physical Engagement: Wald’s X2(1) = 
 11.5; P = 
 0.001; Social Engagement: Wald’s X2(1) = 
 10.7; P = 
 0.001; 
Aggression: Wald’s X2(1) = 
 21.8; P < 
 0.001; Confidence: Wald’s X2(1) = 
 1.4; P = 
 0.229) (Fig. 2).
Apart from the effect of Total MPI score, Social Engagement was also significantly affected by Litter size 
and Trimester of Birth (Litter size: Wald’s X2(1) = 
 6.0, P = 
 0.014; Trimester of Birth: Wald’s X2(3) = 
 11.3, 
P = 
 0.010). Small litters (Number of pups = 
 1–5; N = 
 12) scored higher on average than large litters (Number 
of pups = 
 6–10; N = 
 9) (0.47 ± 
 0.15 vs. − 
0.16 ± 
 0.21, respectively), and litters born during the summer scored 
higher than litters born during the winter: Apr-Jun (N = 
 3): 0.29 ± 
 0.31; Jul-Sep (N = 
 3): 0.84 ± 
 0.33; Oct-Dec 
(N = 
 6): − 
0.43 ± 
 0.21; and Jan-Mar (N = 
 9): − 
0.08 ± 
 0.18. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship 
between Physical Engagement and Trimester of Birth (Wald’s X2(3) = 
 10.1, P = 
 0.018), and litters born during 
the summer months scored higher than litters born during the winter: Apr-Jun (N = 
 3): 0.30 ± 
 0.37; Jul-Sep 
(N = 
 3): 0.99 ± 
 0.37; Oct-Dec (N = 
 6): − 
0.41 ± 
 0.26; and Jan-Mar (N = 
 9): − 
0.04 ± 
 0.21. Aggression was also 
significantly affected by Trimester of Birth (Wald’s X2(3) = 
 15.0, P = 
 0.002), and again, litters born during the 
summer months scored higher than litters born during the winter: Apr-Jun (N = 
 3): 0.19 ± 
 0.30; Jul-Sep (N = 
 3): 
1.03 ± 
 0.30; Oct-Dec (N = 
 6): − 
0.37 ± 
 0.21; and Jan-Mar (N = 
 9): − 
0.05 ± 
 0.17.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that female German Shepherds varied in a consistent manner in the amount of mater-
nal behaviour provided during the first three weeks postpartum, and this affected both Social and Physical 
Engagements, as well as Aggression, in the offspring when they became adults. These results clearly demonstrate 
that maternal care early in the life of dogs affects the behaviour and temperament of the offspring for an extended 
period in life. This may be of profound importance to the understanding of individual variation in behaviour in 
dogs and may help to improve breeding schemes for working dogs.

Similar to other altricial mammalian species, maternal behaviour in dogs during the neonatal period primar-
ily consists of feeding the pups and keeping them warm, clean and protected4,23,24. Unfortunately, it was not pos-
sible to consistently distinguish between individual pups on our video recordings, so we assigned the same value 
of maternal care received to all of the individuals in a particular litter. Champagne et al.10, reported no differences 
in the amount of licking/grooming received between individual pups within a litter, and studies of dogs have only 
reported small intra-litter variation in maternal behaviour25. Hence, we assume that within-litter variation in 
maternal care was sufficiently low to allow us to use the litter means.
All five of the maternal behaviours recorded loaded strongly on one single principal component, and there 
was a high correlation between the MPI values scored separately on the four different observation days. Hence, 
there is strong justification for assigning a single mother-pup interaction score (MPI) to each female and litter.
Maternal behaviour was highly consistent, and although it steadily declined over time, individual differences 
remained stable. These results are consistent with previous studies of rats10,26 and dogs27, which indicates that 
different females in our study may have adopted different mothering styles, which is similar to what is known in 
rodents5,8,9,28,29. The Total MPI score should therefore reliably reflect the mothering style of a particular female.

Similar to what was previously reported by Priestnall30 for mice, the MPI score was significantly affected by 
litter size. In a small litter, the possibility of physical contact between the mother and any sibling is greater, which 
may explain our results. However, it could also be that the larger litters offer each sibling greater opportunities 
for physical comfort from other pups, which could therefore provide some comfort and decrease the need for 
maternal care. In this study, we are not able to distinguish between those possibilities, since that would require 
individual recordings from all pups.
We found no effect of Parity, Sex-ratio or Trimester of Birth on MPI score in this study, although all three have 
previously been found to affect behaviour20. However, the number of animals included here was considerably 
smaller than that included in previous studies, which could have made it more difficult to detect the effects.
In line with earlier behavioural studies of rodents7,9,29,31, variation in maternal care had a clear effect on the 
behaviour of adult dog offspring. The High Total MPI score significantly affected Physical Engagement, which 
is similar to results observed in mice7. There was also a significant relationship between MPI score and Social 
Engagement, in which more maternal care was related to more engagement in social activities with humans, again 
mirroring results in mice Branchi et al.32. Finally, there was also a significant relationship between Aggression and 
the MPI score.
Furthermore, the temperament was affected by litter size and season of birth. One possible interpretation of 
this would be that it could be possible to affect adult behaviour of dogs by adjusting litter sizes and birth times, 
but the present data do not allow this conclusion. The main reason is that we cannot rule out the possibility that 
the effects demonstrated are confounded by genetic factors: possibly, dog mothers with a genetic predisposition 
for high maternal care could at the same time be more prone to have small litters and also to have offspring with a 
certain temperament profile. Hence, more research is needed on the genetic aspects of maternal behaviour before 
we can draw any practical conclusions with respect to dog breeding.
These results clearly show that the level of maternal care has a profound effect on behavioural development in 
dogs. Hence, behavioural variation in dogs can be explained to some extent by variations in the maternal styles of 
the females. Therefore, when breeding working dogs, it could be important to include evaluations of the mothers 
used in the selection programs. Our results demonstrate that some of the variation in maternal behaviour can 
be explained by environmental factors (litter size, time of year), but it is very likely that a large portion is due to 
genetic differences between females.

Conclusions
The maternal style of female German Shepherd varied consistently during the first three weeks postpartum. This 
difference in maternal care affected the behaviour and temperament of the offspring later in life; pups from litters 
raised by mothers that provided more maternal care scored higher for social engagement, physical engagement 
and aggression than those brought up by less attentive mothers. The pups’ adult score for confidence was unaf-
fected by maternal style.
