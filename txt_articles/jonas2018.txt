IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on screening asymptomatic adults for CVD risk using
electrocardiography (ECG) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2017; references;
experts; literature surveillance through April 4, 2018.
STUDY SELECTION English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs); prospective cohort studies
reporting reclassification, calibration, or discrimination that compared risk assessment using ECG
plus traditional risk factors vs traditional risk factors alone. For harms, additional study designs
were eligible. Studies of persons with symptoms or a CVD diagnosis were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study
quality; qualitative synthesis of findings.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality, cardiovascular events, reclassification,
calibration, discrimination, and harms.
RESULTS Sixteen studies were included (N = 77 140). Two RCTs (n = 1151) found no significant
improvement for screening with exercise ECG (vs no screening) in adults aged 50 to 75 years
with diabetes for the primary cardiovascular composite outcomes (hazard ratios, 1.00 [95% CI,
0.59-1.71] and 0.85 [95% CI, 0.39-1.84] for each study). No RCTs evaluated screening with
resting ECG. Evidence from 5 cohort studies (n = 9582) showed that adding exercise ECG to
traditional risk factors such as age, sex, current smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol level, and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level produced small improvements in discrimination
(absolute improvements in area under the curve [AUC] or C statistics, 0.02-0.03, reported by 3
studies); whether calibration or appropriate risk classification improves is uncertain. Evidence
from 9 cohort studies (n = 66 407) showed that adding resting ECG to traditional risk factors
produced small improvements in discrimination (absolute improvement in AUC or C statistics,
0.001-0.05) and appropriate risk classification for prediction of multiple cardiovascular
outcomes, although evidence was limited by imprecision, quality, considerable heterogeneity,
and inconsistent use of risk thresholds used for clinical decision making. Total net reclassification
improvements ranged from 3.6% (2.7% event; 0.6% nonevent) to 30% (17% event; 19%
nonevent) for studies using the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations base models.
Evidence on potential harms (eg, from subsequent angiography or revascularization) in
asymptomatic persons was limited.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE RCTs of screening with exercise ECG found no improvement
in health outcomes, despite focusing on higher-risk populations with diabetes. The addition
of resting ECG to traditional risk factors accurately reclassified persons, but evidence for this
finding had many limitations. The frequency of harms from screening is uncertain.

Study Selection
Twoinvestigatorsindependentlyreviewedtitles,abstracts,andfull-
textarticlestodetermineeligibilityusingprespecifiedcriteriaforeach
KQ (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Disagreements were resolved by
discussion. The review included English-language studies of adults
conductedincountriescategorizedas“veryhigh”ontheUnitedNa-
tionsHumanDevelopmentIndex.Onlystudiesratedasgoodorfair
qualitywereincluded.Studiesthatfocusedonadultswithahistory
of CVD or symptoms suggesting CVD were excluded.
For all KQs, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandom-
ized controlled intervention studies comparing groups that were
screened using ECG with groups that were not screened (ie, com-
paringriskstratificationusingECGplustraditionalriskfactorsvsrisk
stratification using traditional risk factors alone) were eligible. For
KQ1(directevidencethatscreeningimproveshealthoutcomes),eli-
gibleoutcomesincludedall-causemortality,cardiovascularmortal-
ity, and cardiovascular events (MI, angina, stroke, congestive heart
failure, composite cardiovascular outcomes).
For KQ2 (calibration, discrimination, and reclassification), pro-
spectivecohortstudiescomparingCVDriskassessmentmodelsthat
included ECG findings with those that did not include ECG findings
were also eligible. Studies were not required to specifically use the
PCEorFRStobeeligible,althoughsuchstudieshavegreatestappli-
cability to current practice. Studies were required to report reclas-
sification (ability to correctly reassign persons into clinically mean-
ingfulriskcategories),calibration(agreementbetweenobservedand
predictedoutcomes),ordiscrimination(abilitytodistinguishbetween
personswhowillandwillnothaveanevent)(eTable2intheSupple-
ment).StudiesthatonlyassessedtheassociationbetweenECGfind-
ingsandoutcomes(eg,withadjustedhazardratios)wereexcluded.
For KQ3 (harms), prospective cohort studies, large retrospec-
tivecohortstudies,andwell-designedcase-controlstudies(onlyfor
rareevents)werealsoeligible.Eligibleharmsincludedmortality,ar-
rhythmia,cardiovascularevents,orinjuriesfromexerciseECG;anxi-
ety; labeling; and harms of subsequent interventions initiated as a
result of screening. For studies reporting rates of harms from exer-
cise ECG or subsequent interventions, large registries or multi-
centerstudieswithoutacontrolgroupthatreportratesofharmsfor
asymptomatic persons were eligible.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

tion about the populations, tests or treatments, comparators, out-

this information for completeness and accuracy. Two independent
investigators assessed the quality of studies as good, fair, or poor,
usingpredefinedcriteriadevelopedbytheUSPSTFandadaptedfor
this topic (eMethods in the Supplement).8 Disagreements were re-
solved by discussion. Individual study quality ratings are reported
in the eResults and eTables 3-8 in the Supplement.

tive format. To determine whether meta-analyses were appropri-

 assessed following established guidance.9 For KQ1, pooled effects
werenotestimatedbecausefewerthan3similarstudieswerefound,
but risk ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for binary outcomes re-
ported by the included RCTs. Statistical significance was assumed
when 95% CIs did not cross the null. All testing was 2-sided.
For KQ2, considerable heterogeneity was found for ECG find-
ings assessed, base prediction models, outcomes, and duration of
follow-up; therefore, the results are presented in tabular format
and in figures. Results are presented separately for exercise and
resting ECG. Within the studies of resting ECG, results were strati-
fied by whether studies evaluated the addition of a constellation of
ECG abnormalities vs single or specific ECG changes. Results were
categorized by the base models used as “published coefficient
models,”meaning the model preserved the coefficients of original
published models that have been externally validated (eg, FRS or
PCE), or as “model development.”For KQ2, the C statistic (Harrell
C) and area under the curve (AUC) were used as the primary mea-
sures of discrimination and were summarized together. Measures
of overall performance were summarized with those of calibration.
Net reclassification improvement (NRI) was the primary measure of
reclassification, with event and nonevent NRIs reported separately
when possible. Analyses were conducted and figures were pro-
duced using Stata version 14 (StataCorp) and Microsoft Excel.
The overall strength of the body of evidence was assessed for
each KQ as high, moderate, low, or insufficient using methods
developed for the USPSTF (and the Evidence-based Practice Cen-
ter program), based on the overall quality of studies, consistency
of results between studies, precision of findings, and risk of
reporting bias.8
Results
A total of 16 studies (17 articles) with 77 140 participants were in-
cluded (Figure 2).

Does the addition of screening with resting or exercise ECG to traditional CVD risk factor assessment accurately reclassify persons into
different risk groups (eg, high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups) or improve measures of calibration and discrimination?
Evidence reviews for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) use an
analytic framework to visually display the key questions (KQs) that the review will
address to allow the USPSTF to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a
preventive service. The questions are depicted by linkages that relate to
interventions and outcomes. Outcomes of interest are depicted using a rectangle;
intermediate outcomes are in rounded rectangles and health outcomes have
squared corners. Further details are available from the USPSTF procedure
manual.8 CVD indicates cardiovascular disease; ECG, electrocardiography.
a Includes adults regardless of their CVD risk (those with low, intermediate,
or high risk are eligible) as assessed by traditional risk factors (those included
in Framingham risk models): male sex, older age, cigarette smoking,
hypertension, dyslipidemia (high total cholesterol level, high low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level, or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level),
and diabetes.
bThis systematic review does not include KQs about the benefits and harms
of preventive medications to reduce cardiovascular risk (ie, aspirin and
lipid-lowering therapy) or the benefits and harms of lifestyle counseling, because
those have been addressed by other systematic reviews for the USPSTF.

Size of data markers indicates relative number of events in the study compared
with other studies reporting the same outcome. For the DYNAMIT (Do You Need
to Assess Myocardial Ischemia in Type-2 Diabetes) trial, the primary composite
outcome was defined as death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization or emergency service
intervention. DYNAMIT did not report data for cardiovascular-related deaths. For
other cardiovascular events, DYNAMIT reported no significant differences
between groups for revascularization (18 vs 21, P = .61). For the DADDY-D (Does
Coronary Atherosclerosis Deserve to Be Diagnosed Early in Diabetic Patients) trial,
the primary composite outcome was defined as first cardiac event, specifically
nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death. DADDY-D reported 19 total deaths
(6 cardiac and 13 noncardiac) and 7 total strokes but did not report in which group
those occurred. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs calculated using the numbers of
events reported by the trials. The trials also reported hazard ratios (HRs) for the
primary outcomes (HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.59-1.71] in DYNAMIT; HR, 0.85 [95% CI,
0.39-1.84] in DADDY-D). KQ indicates key question.

bCalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
c SPECT was used in patients unable to perform the exercise test, with a
submaximal negative exercise test finding, or with ECG abnormalities
impairing interpretation of the exercise test. Those with positive findings were
referred to cardiologists, and all subsequent investigations and treatments
were at the cardiologist’
s discretion (ie, no protocol for that part of the process
related to angiography vs no angiography; pragmatic approach).
dTobacco consumption (not specified in the article if limited to smoking).
e Maximal symptom-limited exercise treadmill test performed following
American Heart Association guidelines. Submaximal test findings were
considered not diagnostic and did not lead to any further investigations.
Coronary angiography was proposed to all patients with positive exercise
treadmill test findings; choices to perform stenting or surgery were
determined according to the European Guidelines by 2 interventional
cardiologists and a cardiac surgeon after reviewing coronary anatomy.

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared);
DTS, Duke treadmill score; ECG, electrocardiogram; FRS, Framingham Risk Score; METS, metabolic equivalents;
KQ, key question; NR, not reported; SCORE, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation.
a All studies in table were of fair quality.
bModel types were categorized as published coefficient models when they preserved the coefficients of
published models that have been externally validated (eg, FRS or Pooled Cohort Equations) or as model
development when they did not.
c An ischemic ST-segment abnormality, which was assessed visually by 2 independent readers, was defined as a
1-mm horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression occurring 80 ms after the J point; ST-segment
depression had to be noted in �3 consecutive beats in �2 contiguous leads.
dSCORE provides 10-year risk for cardiovascular mortality and includes age, sex, total cholesterol level, systolic
blood pressure, and smoking status (this study used the high-risk coefficients from it).
e Ischemia was defined as �1-mm ST-segment depression occurring >80 ms after the J point. High and low risk
were defined as the presence and absence of ischemia, respectively.
f Authors attempted to calculate FRS as published, but continuous blood pressure and cholesterol measurements
were not available, so these predictors were dichotomized (hyperlipidemia = total cholesterol 200-239 mg/dL
and hypertension = systolic blood pressure 140-159 mm Hg).
g Positive exercise test finding was defined as a horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression �1.0 mm at 80
ms after the J point, in �2 contiguous leads, occurring at any time of exercise or recovery period.
h Used Anderson 1991: 10-year FRS function that includes age, sex, current smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol
level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.
i Positive exercise test finding was defined as a horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression �1.0 mm at 80
ms after the J point, in �2 contiguous leads, occurring at any time during exercise or the recovery period.
j Exercise predictors were physical fitness (cumulative work during exercise divided by body weight), maximal
heart rate, systolic blood pressure at the end of the first exercise load, and exercise ECG interpretation
(ST-segment depression �1.0 mm at 80 ms after the J point, regardless of ST-segment morphology).
k Model included age, total cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and smoking status. The study included men
only. The study also excluded persons with prevalent diabetes and persons receiving blood pressure–lowering
therapy at baseline. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was not accounted for in the model.

Total net reclassification improvement (NRI; black data markers) indicates the sum
of the event NRI (net upward reclassification among persons who had an event;
orange data markers) and the nonevent NRI (net downward reclassification among
persons who did not have an event; blue data markers). For some studies, only the
total NRI is provided because the data for event and nonevent NRI were not
reported.NoneventNRIiscalculatedastheproportionofpersonswithoutanevent
who were appropriately reclassified into a lower risk group minus the proportion of
those without an event who were inappropriately reclassified into a higher risk
group. Event NRI is calculated as the proportion of persons with an event who were
appropriately reclassified into a higher risk group minus the proportion of those
with an event who were inappropriately reclassified into a lower risk group.
Although an overall positive value of NRI indicates net appropriate reclassification,
the clinical implications can be very different if the majority of patients are those
with events being shifted into higher-risk categories (event NRI), vs those without
events being shifted into lower-risk categories (nonevent NRI). The addition of
electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities to conventional risk factors improves
total NRI in both cases, but one might lead to an increase in preventive
medications, while the other suggests a possible reduction in the use of preventive
medications. CHD indicates coronary heart disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease;
FRS, Framingham Risk Score; NR, not reported; PCE, Pooled Cohort Equations.

a All studies were of fair quality except for Auer et al, which was good quality. When this table includes a range,
the data were not reported for the full sample but were reported separately for different groups.
bModel types categorized as published coefficient models when they preserved the coefficients of published
models that have been externally validated (eg, FRS or PCE) or as model development when they did not.
c Calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
dCriteria for major prevalent ECG abnormalities were any of the following, using the Minnesota Coding (MC)
System: Q-QS wave abnormalities (MC 1-1 to 1-2-8), left ventricular hypertrophy (MC 3-1), Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome (MC 6-4-1 or 6-4-2), complete bundle-branch block or intraventricular block (MC 7-1-1, 7-2-1, 7-4, or
7-8), atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (MC 8-3), or major ST-T changes (MC 4-1, 4-2, 5-1, and 5-2). Criteria for minor
prevalent ECG abnormalities were minor ST-T changes (MC 4-3, 4-4, 5-3, and 5-4). Participants with both were
classified as having major abnormalities. Participants without minor or major ECG abnormalities were classified
as having marginal or no abnormalities and their ECG findings were considered normal.
e Model development comprised 2 models: (1) FRS variables and diabetes and (2) FRS variables only. FRS variables
were age, sex, total and HDL cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, and smoking.
f Individuals with any of the following at baseline, classified using the MC System, were considered to have ECG
abnormalities: possible or probably myocardial infarction, cardiac infarction or injury score �10, possible or
probable left ventricular hypertrophy, any axis deviation, and any rhythm abnormalities other than sinus.
g Participant characteristics were reported for the larger sample of 14 749 postmenopausal women in the WHI
estrogen + progestin trial but not for the subset of 1264 in the WHI blood subsample corresponding to the
results relevant for this review.
h Criteria for major prevalent ECG abnormalities were any of the following, using the Novacode criteria: (1) atrial
fibrillation or atrial flutter, (2) high-degree atrioventricular dissociation, (3) left bundle-branch block, (4) right
bundle-branch block, (5) indeterminate conduction delay, (6) Q-wave myocardial infarction, (7) isolated
ischemic abnormalities, (8) left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities, and (9) miscellaneous
arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular preexcitation, ventricular tachycardia) with <5
participants being included in the analysis and not listed individually. Women with both major and minor
abnormalities were classified as having major abnormalities. Criteria for minor prevalent ECG abnormalities were
any of the following, using the Novacode criteria: (1) first- and second-degree atrioventricular block,
(2) borderline prolonged ventricular excitation, (3) prolonged ventricular repolarization, (4) isolated minor
Q-wave and ST-T abnormalities, (5) left ventricular hypertrophy without ST-T abnormalities, (6) left atrial
enlargement, (7) frequent atrial or ventricular premature beats, and (8) fascicular blocks. Criteria for incident
ECG abnormalities were any of the following, using the Novacode criteria: (1) new atrial fibrillation or flutter,
(2) new prolonged ventricular excitation, (3) new prolonged ventricular repolarization, (4) new left ventricular
hypertrophy, (5) new Q-wave myocardial infarction, and (6) new ischemic ST-T evolution.
i Model included age, race, total and HDL cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive
medication, and smoking status.
j QTc determined by Bazett QTc intervals of �440 ms in men and �460 ms in women on a 12-lead ECG.
LVH diagnosed with Cornell product of �244 mVxms.
k Model included age, sex, BMI, current smoking, alcohol intake >20 g/d, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive
medication use, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and heart rate.
l Reported outcomes for major or minor ECG changes, T-wave changes, ventricular conduction delay,
LVH, Q waves, ST depressions, resting heart rate; classified using MC.
mModel included age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, sex, current smoking, and diabetes.
n Selected from major and minor abnormalities. Major ECG abnormalities were defined as follows: major
Q/QS-waves (MC 1.1, 1.2), ST-segment depression (MC 4.1, 4.2), negative T waves (MC 5.1, 5.2), ventricular
conduction defect (MC 7.1, 7.2, or 7.4), atrial fibrillation/flutter (MC 8.3), or ST-segment elevation (MC9.2).
Minor ECG abnormalities were defined as having minor Q waves (MC 1.2.8 or 1.3), high R waves (MC 3.1 or 3.3),
minor ST-segment changes (MC 4.3 or 4.4), minor T-wave changes (MC 5.3 or 5.4), prolonged PR interval
(MC 6.3), RR′ in V1 or V2 (MC 7.3 or 7.5), or left anterior fascicular block (MC 7.7).
o FRS model includes age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco use, total and HDL
cholesterol levels, and use of antihypertensives.

Harms of Screening
Key Question 3a. What are the harms of screening with resting or
exercise ECG, including harms of subsequent procedures or inter-
ventions initiated as a result of screening?
KeyQuestion3b.Dotheharmsofscreeningvaryforsubgroupsde-
fined by baseline CVD risk (eg, low, intermediate, or high risk), age,
sex, or race/ethnicity?
One RCT described in KQ1, the DADDY-D trial, was included for
this KQ. It reported on harms from subsequent interventions initi-
ated as a result of screening.11 Twenty of 262 participants (7.6%) in
the screened group had positive exercise treadmill test findings.
Ofthose20participants,17underwentcoronaryangiography(6.5%
of the 262 in the screened group). Angiography revealed critical ste-
nosis (not defined) in 12 of those 17 (71%), and all patients with criti-
cal stenosis underwent revascularization procedures (7 percutane-
ous and 5 surgical). One patient undergoing percutaneous
revascularization had a nonfatal acute MI 3 days after the procedure
andunderwentasecondpercutaneousangioplasty.Hisejectionfrac-
tion was reported to be normal 6 months later.
The other trial described in KQ1 (DYNAMIT) reported the num-
berofsomesubsequenttestsbutdidnotreportwhetheranyofthe
tests or interventions resulted in harms.10

(No. of Participants)
Summary of Main Findings
(Including Consistency and Precision)
Strength of Evidence
Limitations
(Including Reporting Bias)
Applicability
KQ1: Benefits of Screening With ECG
2 RCTs (fair quality)
(n = 1151)
Neither study found a statistically significant
reduction in events, including their primary
outcomes,a all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-
related mortality, MI, heart failure, or stroke.
Findings were consistent and imprecise.
Low for no benefit of
screening with
exercise ECG;
insufficient for
resting ECG; no
studies
Neither trial reached sample size
targets; stopped early because of
trouble recruiting. Not clear that 3.5
y of follow-up is sufficient. Masking
of outcome assessors and amount of
missing data NR in 1 trial.11
Reporting bias not detected.
Asymptomatic adults
aged 50-75 y with
diabetes undergoing
exercise ECG; both
trials enrolled
high-risk populations
KQ2: Reclassification, Calibration, and Discrimination for Exercise ECG
5 Cohort studies (fair quality) (n = 9582)
Discrimination
3 studies: small absolute improvement in AUC or C
statistics (0.02-0.03); none reported 95% CIs; 1
reported P = .3 (no significant difference between
models). Consistent; imprecise.
Low for small
improvement
CIs for calibration or discrimination
NR (5 studies); mean duration of
follow-up <10 yd (4 studies),
reclassification NR (4 studies);
unknown masking of outcome
assessors (4 studies); not reporting
both discrimination and calibration
(3 studies); model development
studies (2 studies); unclear handling
and amount of missing data (2
studies). The 1 study reporting NRI
was a model development study, used
risk categories of <6% vs 6%-20% vs
>20%, and may have included many
symptomatic participants.e Reporting
bias not detected.
Adults without a
history of CVD; mean
age of participants
50-58 y; range of
females was 0%-38%;
race/ethnicity NR in
most (4 studies).
Mean baseline FRS
score was 10.8-12.3
in studies reporting it
(3 studies);
intermediate risk, on
average
Calibration or
performance
4 studies; 2 studies FRS base model; all 4 used
different metrics;b none reported figures such as
calibration plots;c 3 studies reported improvement
with addition of exercise ECG variables; mixed results
for the 2 with FRS base models. Inconsistent;
imprecise.
Insufficient
Reclassification
1 model development study, n = 988: total NRI, 9.6%
(P = .007); intermediate-risk NRI, 18.9% (P = .01).
Consistency unknown; imprecise.
Insufficient
KQ2: Reclassification, Calibration, and Discrimination for Resting ECG
9 Cohort studies (8 fair, 1 good quality) (n = 66 407)
Discrimination
7 studies; 4 studies FRS or PCE base model; 4 studies
multiple ECG changes: very small to small absolute
improvement in AUC or C statistics (0.001-0.05); few
(3 studies) reported whether differences were
statistically significant. Consistent; imprecise.
Low for very small to
small improvement
Limited reporting on assessment of
symptoms; unclear what proportion
of participants were truly
asymptomatic; masking of outcome
assessors NR (8 studies), confidence
intervals for calibration or
discrimination NR (5 studies), not
reporting calibration (5 studies),
model development studies (4
studies), amount of missing data NR
(2 studies), and mean duration of
follow-up less than 10 y (2 studies).
For reclassification, few (3 studies)
included a threshold between risk
categories corresponding to the
recommendations for preventive
medications (ie, 7.5% or 10%
10-y risk).
Adults without a
history of CVD; mean
age of participants,
54-73 y; majority
were women in all
studies; range of
nonwhite participants
in those who reported
race/ethnicity (6
studies) was 9%-41%.
Mean baseline risk
ranging from low to
high across studies.
Calibration or
performance
4 studies; 2 studies FRS + major/minor ECG changes;
1 study FRS + specific T-wave change: no studies
reported calibration plots; variety of metrics used;
good calibration with addition of major or minor
changes (2 studies) or T-wave amplitude in lead aVR
(1 study) to FRS. Poor calibration with addition of
major or minor changes to FRS variables (1 model
development study of adults aged 70-79 y).
Consistent among 3 studies using published
coefficients; imprecise.
Low for improvement
Reclassification
7 studies, 59 123 participants; 3 studies FRS or
PCE + multiple ECG changes; 1 study FRS + specific
T-wave change. Overall, total NRIs range from 3.6%
(2.7% event; 0.6% nonevent) to 30% (17% event;
19% nonevent) for studies using FRS or PCE base
models (95% CIs rarely reported).f
Consistent in all showing improved NRI, but
inconsistent for estimates of NRI and outcomes
assessed; consistency unknown for specific risk
categories because all studies used different risk
categories; imprecise.
Low for improvement
KQ3: Harms of Screening With ECG
1 RCT (fair quality)
(n = 520)
1 patient of 12 (8.3%) undergoing revascularization
procedures after positive exercise treadmill test in
the DADDY-D trial had a nonfatal acute MI 3 d after
percutaneous revascularization and underwent a
second percutaneous angioplasty.g Consistency
unknown (single study); imprecise.
Insufficient
Trial focused on assessing benefits;
did not reach sample size target; not
clear that mean of 3.6 y of follow-up
is sufficient; masking of outcome
assessors NR and amount of missing
data NR. Reporting bias not detected.
Asymptomatic adults
aged 55- 75 y with
diabetes undergoing
screening with
exercise ECG
a For the primary composite outcomes, hazard ratios were 1.00 (0.59 to 1.71) for
a composite of death from all causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or heart
failure requiring hospitalization or emergency service intervention and 0.85
(0.39 to 1.84) for a composite of nonfatal MI or cardiac death.
bMetrics included likelihood ratio test; Akaike information criteria, Brier score,
and Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2; global χ2; and predicted and observed events.
c One model development study provided a table of predicted and observed
events for quintiles of risk.16
dThe only study reporting longer follow-up covered 26 years, but it did not
account for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in analyses.16
e Of these, 16.5% had atypical chest pain, and participants were a subset of
those having coronary artery calcium score and single-photon emission
computed tomography for “
clinically indicated reasons.”
13
f For multiple ECG changes (on resting 12-lead ECG), total NRIs for studies using
any base model ranged from 1.9% (−0.2% event NRIs; 0.6% nonevent NRIs)
to 30% (17% event NRIs; 19% nonevent NRIs).
g The DADDY-D trial reported that 20/262 participants (7.6%) in the screened
group had positive exercise treadmill test findings. Of those 20, 17 underwent
coronary angiography (6.5% of 262). Angiography revealed critical stenosis (not
defined) in 71% (12/17), and all patients with critical stenosis underwent
revascularization (7 percutaneous, 5 surgical). The DYNAMIT trial (included in
KQ1) reported the number of some subsequent tests but did not report whether
any tests or interventions resulted in harms; adverse events during follow-up
were not recorded.10 Of 316 participants in the screened group, 68 (21.5%) had a
definitely abnormal or uncertain result (exercise test or SPECT). Of those, 38
underwent coronary angiography (12% of 316) and 9 subsequently underwent
coronary angioplasty (7/9 received stents) and 3 had CABG surgery.

by the USPSTF and American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association to inform decisions about preventive medications. Only
1 included study used the PCE as the base model. Studies of a con-
stellation of resting ECG changes show greater potential than those
of single ECG changes and could be the focus of future research. Fu-
ture studies should use clinically meaningful risk categories that cor-

tions.WhenconsideringtheUSPSTFrecommendationsforstatinsand

great interest. Future studies should evaluate asymptomatic popu-
lations and should exclude those with a history of CVD. Measures of
discrimination,calibration,andreclassification(includingtotal,event,
and nonevent NRI) and their corresponding CIs should be reported.
Future studies detailing harms of screening are also needed.
Conclusions
RCTsofscreeningwithexerciseECGfoundnoimprovementinhealth
outcomes, despite focusing on higher-risk populations with diabe-
tes. The addition of resting ECG to traditional risk factors accu-
rately reclassified persons, but evidence for this finding had many
limitations. The frequency of harms from screening is uncertain.
