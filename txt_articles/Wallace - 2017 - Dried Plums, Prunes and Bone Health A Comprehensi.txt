Abstract: The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advocate for increasing fruit intake and
replacing energy-dense foods with those that are nutrient-dense. Nutrition across the lifespan is
pivotal for the healthy development and maintenance of bone. The National Osteoporosis Foundation
estimates that over half of Americans age 50+ have either osteoporosis or low bone mass. Dried plums,
also commonly referred to as prunes, have a unique nutrient and dietary bioactive profile and are
suggested to exert beneficial effects on bone. To further elucidate and summarize the potential
mechanisms and effects of dried plums on bone health, a comprehensive review of the scientific
literature was conducted. The PubMed database was searched through 24 January 2017 for all cell,
animal, population and clinical studies that examined the effects of dried plums and/or extracts
of the former on markers of bone health. Twenty-four studies were included in the review and
summarized in table form. The beneficial effects of dried plums on bone health may be in part due
to the variety of phenolics present in the fruit. Animal and cell studies suggest that dried plums
and/or their extracts enhance bone formation and inhibit bone resorption through their actions
on cell signaling pathways that influence osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. These studies
are consistent with clinical studies that show that dried plums may exert beneficial effects on bone
mineral density (BMD). Long-term prospective cohort studies using fractures and BMD as primary
endpoints are needed to confirm the effects of smaller clinical, animal and mechanistic studies.
Clinical and prospective cohort studies in men are also needed, since they represent roughly 29% of
fractures, and likewise, diverse race and ethnic groups. No adverse effects were noted among any
of the studies included in this comprehensive review. While the data are not completely consistent,
this review suggests that postmenopausal women may safely consume dried plums as part of their
fruit intake recommendations given their potential to have protective effects on bone loss.

1. Introduction
The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) advocate for healthy eating patterns that
include a variety of fruits. This includes all fresh, frozen, canned and dried fruits and fruit juices [1].
The recommended intake of fruit in the Healthy US-Style Eating Pattern at the 2000-kcal level is two
cup-equivalents of fruit per day. Increasing the amount and variety of fruits Americans consume
is a strategy that helps individuals meet a wide range of nutrient requirements. However, per the
2015–2020 DGA, average intake of fruit is well below recommendations for almost all age-sex groups,
except in children ages 1–8 years [1]. Average intake of fruit is lowest among girls ages 14–18 years
and in women age 51+ years [1], two critical time points in bone development and maintenance.
Osteoporosis is a rising public health concern, given the aging population and suboptimal
dietary intakes of dairy, fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which provide a variety of essential

nutrients that influence bone accretion and maintenance across the lifespan. The National Osteoporosis
Foundation estimates that 10.3% of Americans over the age of 50 years have osteoporosis (t-score ≤ 2.5),
and 43.9% have low bone mass (also commonly referred to as osteopenia; t-score ≤ 1.0), a risk factor
for osteoporosis [2]. The risk of fractures increases with age among individuals age 50+, and differs
by sex, race and ethnicity [2,3]. Although many factors contribute to this debilitating event, the most
significant causes are reduction in bone mass, structural deterioration and increased frequency of falls.
It 2005, it was estimated that the over two million incident osteoporotic fractures occurring annually in
the U.S. had an economic burden of $16.9 billion, which is anticipated grow to three million fractures at
a cost of $25.3 billion by 2025 [4]. Men account for 29% of these fractures and 25% of the cost burden [4].
Optimization of lifestyle factors known to influence bone mass and strength is an important strategy
aimed at reducing the risk of fractures later in life.
Plums are a type of drupe fruit that belong to the subgenus Prunus (family Rosaceae). They differ
from other subgenera of drupe fruits (cherries, peaches, etc.) since the shoots have a terminal
bud and unclustered single side buds, flowers combine in groups of one to five on short stems,
the fruit has a crease running down one side and a smooth seed. There are over 40 species of plums
currently documented, although two species, the European plum (Prunus domestica) and Japanese plum
(Prunus salicina and hybrids) are of commercial significance globally [5]. The origin of European plum
is thought to have been near the Caspian Sea, while Japanese plums originated in China, but derived
their name from the country where they were cultivated. European plums were introduced in the
U.S. by pilgrims in the 17th century, while Japanese plums were introduced to the U.S. in the late
19th century. China, Serbia and Romania are the world’s leading producers of plums. Worldwide,
greater than 11.2 million metric tons of plums were harvested in 2014 per the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations [6]. While all prunes originate from fresh plums, not all
plum varieties are considered prunes. Commercialized prunes, also commonly known as dried plums,
are the dehydrated version of the cultivar Prunus domestica L. cv d’Agen. This specific variety has a
naturally-occurring sugar content that enables it to be dried while still containing the pit, without
being fermented. The State of California produces ~99% of the plums in the U.S. and ~40% of the
world’s dried plums [7].
Dried plums are widely known for their laxative effect, which is commonly attributed to
their dietary fiber content [8], but is also likely influenced by the significant amounts of phenolics
(e.g., chlorogenic acid) and sorbitol present in the fruit.
Dried plums are not only a source of
dietary fiber, but also a good source of potassium and vitamin K (Table 1). One serving or ~4 dried
plums is 92 kilocalories and provides 2.4 g of dietary fiber, 280 mg of potassium and 22.8 µg of
vitamin K. Dried plums also contain several dietary bioactives, including phenolic compounds,
such as 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3-p-coumarolylquinic acid,
caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside [9], whose benefits may extend beyond the
basic nutrition requirements of humans. There is an emerging body of evidence from laboratory, animal
and human studies that suggests that dried plums may exert an effect on bone health. Hooshmand and
others found that two servings (100 g) of dried plums per day slowed the rate of bone turnover and
helped to improve bone mineral density (BMD) in a clinical study of 160 randomized postmenopausal
women (100 completed the study) not receiving hormone replacement therapy [10]. A more recent
clinical study by the same group confirmed the bone protective effects in postmenopausal women
receiving one serving of dried plums per day [11]. However, a comprehensive review of dried plums
and bone health is not currently present in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.

2. Methods
2.1. Literature Search
A comprehensive literature search was conducted as of 24 January 2017 using the PubMed
database. The search methodology is outlined in Table 2. A systematic literature search was not
conducted for lack of clinical and observational evidence and since the focus was to evaluate potential
mechanisms from various types of data.
Included in the review were cell, animal, population and clinical studies in the English language
that assessed the effects of dried plums or extracts of the former on markers of bone health. All articles
were screened by title/abstract and, in some cases, full-text. A complete manual search of reference
lists of original studies was also conducted. Excluded studies (n = 26) were those of any kind that
did not assess dried plum (prune) or plum intake on one or more markers or clinical endpoints of
bone health.

3. Results
The literature search of the PubMed database yielded 50 articles [10–61]. After title/abstract
review, 22 articles were screened in full-text and included in this comprehensive review [10–29,31,32].
Two additional studies [30,33] were included after examination of the reference lists of the 22 studies
identified in the literature search. Data and results from each of the 24 included studies are listed in
Tables 3–5.
Four clinical trials were identified in this comprehensive review [10–14]. Most the studies retrieved
for full-text review were animal studies involving either rats or mice (16 total) [15–30], although three
(cell) studies were also identified [31–33]. No observational studies were identified in the PubMed
literature search or after examination of the reference lists of included studies.
4. Discussion
Dried plums are being increasingly recognized for their role in bone health. This comprehensive
review supports that consumption of dried plums is safe and may be a bone healthy option
for postmenopausal women wishing to satisfy daily requirement for fruit as outlined by the
2015–2020 DGA. It is important to note that dried plums contain a higher amount of vitamin K
as compared to other commonly-consumed fruits, which may influence bone health by helping to
improve calcium balance.
The quality of clinical studies included in this comprehensive review was acceptable, noting that
none utilized a sample size based on a priori power calculation, nor were the treatment allocations
able to be concealed from the participants and/or investigators. All four clinical studies identified
were derived from the same laboratory group [10–14], meriting the need for replication by additional
investigators. Clinical studies included in this review had several limitations, such as a short duration
of 3–12 months, which is a narrow window to see significant changes in BMD. All four clinical
studies were un-blinded, and only the Hooshmand et al. 2016 [11] had an inactive placebo group.
The Hooshmand et al. 2011 [10] and Hooshmand et al. 2014 [13] manuscripts used dried apples as the
control group and represent the same study population with additional biomarkers being measured for
the latter publication post hoc (BMD data are presented twice). Participants in this study also received
500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D during the intervention [10,13], even though administration
of these supplements was equal across both arms. Simonavice et al., 2014 [14], assessed the effects
of dried plums and resistance training vs. resistance training alone on blood markers of bone and
inflammation in female breast cancer survivors. While this study found null effects, these results are
likely not generalizable to healthy postmenopausal women experiencing normal hormone-related bone
loss. Resistance training has been shown to have a larger effect on preventing bone loss as compared to
most dietary interventions and could have masked the much smaller the effects, if present, exerted by
dried plums. The Hooshmand et al., 2016 [11], found that dried plum consumption at 50–100 g/day for
a period of six months prevented loss of total body BMD, but not spine, hip or ulna BMD, likely due to
its shorter duration.
Consistent improvements in BMD at several sites were noted in animal studies designed to
model conditions at or before peak bone mass, pregnancy, post-menopause, osteopenia and/or
osteoporosis. Rat models of ovarian hormone deficiency have been used for over 25 years to simulate
postmenopausal bone loss in humans. Ovarian hormone deficient rats and postmenopausal women
have many similar characteristics when it comes to bone loss. These characteristics include increased
rates of bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation, an initial rapid phase of bone loss
followed by a slower phase due to the ovariectomy, greater loss of trabecular vs. cortical bone,
decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and a similar response to drug (e.g., bisphosphonate
therapy) and lifestyle interventions (e.g., physical activity) [41]. Indeed, animal studies show that dried
plums and/or their polyphenol-rich extracts can beneficially affect both BMD and bone biomarkers.
The animal and cell studies presented in this comprehensive review are consistent with and supportive
of the theory that a diet high in phenolics and/or flavonoids may enhance bone formation and
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 401
17 of 21
inhibit bone resorption through their actions on cell signaling pathways that influence osteoblast and
osteoclast differentiation [62]. Total body BMD and BMD at specific sites, as well as several blood
biomarkers, including AP, BAP, BSAP, OPG, RANKL and TRAP-5b, have been shown to be consistently
and beneficially impacted across both clinical and animal studies. Animal studies also collectively
support that dried plums may beneficially influence bone area and micro-architecture.
Several bone turnover markers seemed to be improved among clinical studies; however, there
was a lack of consistency among many of the markers across and between both clinical and
animal studies. For instance, Arjmandi et al., 2002 [12], found significant increases in bone alkaline
phosphatase (BAP), but the latter larger study Hooshmand et al., 2011 [10], reported a decrease in
BAP. Noting the abundance of bone turnover markers measured in both research and the clinical
setting, the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Bone Markers Working group recently reviewed the
scientific literature to determine the clinical potential of bone turnover markers, which includes the
prediction of fracture risk and monitoring treatments for osteoporosis [63]. The IOF/IFCC working
group identified one bone resorption marker (s-CTX, serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen)
and one bone formation marker (s-PINP, serum procollagen type 1 N propeptide) to be used as
reference markers and measured by standardized assays in observational and intervention studies [63].
While only one animal study assessed the effects of dried plums on CTX [27] and two on PINP [27,28],
collectively, the animal studies included in this review showed beneficial effects of dried plums
and/or their polyphenol-rich extracts on most, but not all, markers of bone turnover. Nevertheless,
bone turnover markers are likely too premature in their standardization and clinical utility to accurately
predict small changes in bone, as expected in dietary interventions. Differences in study design,
dose and duration may also contribute to the inconsistencies in the bone turnover markers measured
across and between rodent and cell studies.
Future Research
Identification of the active components, particularly individual phenolics, and their potential
modes of action are necessary to fully understand the overall effect of dried plums on bone health
across the lifespan. While existing data indicate that consumption of dried plums may be beneficial
in postmenopausal women with ongoing bone loss, future clinical and prospective cohort studies in
premenopausal women, men and adolescents prior to peak bone mass accrual are necessary to confirm
their effects across the population and to make generalizable dietary guidance statements.
Recent epidemiological studies show that phenolic compounds may have a stronger association
with bone than general fruit and vegetable consumption [62]. Even though BMD is a validated
biomarker of bone health, fractures represent the most significant clinical endpoint of bone health
across the lifespan. Prospective cohort studies designed to assess potential associations of dried plum
intake on both fracture risk and changes in BMD across the population and various subpopulations
are greatly needed to confirm the findings of studies included in this comprehensive review.
5. Conclusions
Dried plums are an easy means to help individuals meet their daily recommendations for fruit
intake. The beneficial effects of dried plums on bone health may be in part due to the unique variety of
phenolics and nutrients present in the fruit. Animal and cell studies suggest that dried plums and/or
their extracts enhance bone formation and inhibit bone resorption through their actions on cell signaling
pathways that influence osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation; however, results on specific markers
are not consistent across and between studies. Animal studies are somewhat consistent with small
clinical interventions that show dried plums may exert beneficial effects on total body and site-specific
BMD. Long-term prospective cohort studies using fractures and BMD as primary endpoints are needed
to confirm the effects of smaller clinical, animal and mechanistic studies. No adverse effects were noted
among any of the studies included in this comprehensive review. While the data are not completely
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 401

consistent, this review suggests that postmenopausal women may safely consume dried plums as part
of their fruit intake recommendations given their potential to have protective effects on bone loss.
