Abstract
Backround: Meta-analysis of the impact of public smoking bans on children’s exposure to secondhand smoke
(SHS) exposure at home.
Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFo, ASSIA, CINAHL were searched. German
public health journals not captured by these databases and grey literature were considered in addition.
Studies were included when they reported children’s SHS exposure at home in relation to smoke-free legislation by
measuring exposure before and after the introduction of a public smoking ban. Studies had to provide results on
exposure prevalences of children aged below 18 years. Language of publications was restricted to German and
English.
Details of the included studies (n = 15) were extracted by one author and checked for accuracy by a second author.
Given the exposure prevalences before and after the introduction of a smoke-free legislation, a random-effects
meta-analysis of relative risks (RR) was conducted. Results were presented in a forest plot.
Results: Meta-analysis showed that the overall effect was a decreased exposure to SHS in the children’s homes
after introduction of a public smoking ban (RR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.62–0.83). Only two of the 15 studies indicated an
increased exposure. Sensitivity analyses considering the type of smoke-free legislation, children’s age group and
study quality did not substantially alter the result.
Conclusion: The assumption of a displacement of smoking into homes with children due to smoke-free legislation
in public places could not be confirmed. Additional research is needed to analyse long-term trends.

Background
Secondhand smoke (SHS) is known to consist of several
harmful substances relevant for health [1]. Several ad-
verse health effects for non-smokers are associated with
SHS, including multiple types of cancer, cardiovascular
disease and/or acute respiratory illness [2, 3]. World-
wide, SHS is regarded as the third leading cause of
preventable disease, disability and death [2] and approxi-
mately 600,000 non-smokers die per year due to SHS
exposure [4]. Because especially young children are un-
able to protect themselves from the risks of SHS expos-
ure, they are the most tragically affected group. An
estimated 40–50% of children with smoking parents
and/or other smoking household members are regularly
exposed to SHS [5].
Since the 1980′ smoke-free legislations and restricted
places where people are allowed to smoke increased [6, 7].

Control (FCTC) from 2005 the first global public health

comprises
smoke-free legislation in terms of smoking bans at public
places aiming to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke
among non-smokers [8].
With the introduction of public smoking bans in
enclosed spaces of hospitality venues and further work-
places, the so-called displacement hypothesis has been
put forward. This proposes that smoke-free laws may
result in a displacement from smoking in public to
smoking at home [9, 10]. If proven, this would contra-
dict one of the main aims of public smoking bans, as it
would have a deleterious effect on health especially for
children with smoking parents and/or family members.
The negative effects of smoking within the home go be-
yond the immediate health risks of exposure to SHS.
Children living with an adult smoker are up to twice as
likely to take up smoking themselves [11, 12].
However, there is a growing body of evidence that sup-
ports the rejection of the displacement hypothesis, and in-
stead supports the alternative social diffusion hypothesis
which suggests that changes in social norms due to public
smoking bans may result in an increase in voluntary home
smoking bans [6, 7, 13–15]. Previous studies [6, 7, 16]
demonstrated an effect of public smoking bans by show-
ing a decrease in smoking in bars and restaurants after the
introduction of public smoking bans, but found no
changes in smoking behaviour at home. Edwards et al.
[17] even came to the conclusion that there was a signifi-
cant reduction in SHS exposure in houses or flats.
Apparently previous research indicates a general rejec-
tion of the displacement hypothesis, but the focus was not
specifically on SHS exposure of children at home before
and after the introduction of smoke-free legislation. There-
fore, this review aims to determine the overall impact of
public smoking bans on children’s SHS exposure at home.
Methods
This systematic review follows the PRISMA statement for
systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Additional file 1)
[18]. The study was registered with the PROSPERO
international prospective register of systematic reviews
(Registration no. CRD42017059522).
Literature search
The search syntax was applied in June 2016 to the
following electronic databases: Web of Science, PsycINFO
(via Ovid), PubMed, Applied Social Sciences Index and
Abstracts (ASSIA) (via ProQuest), and the Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)
(via EBSCO Host). It was developed using keywords from
other systematic reviews that were previously performed.
The keywords included in the final search syntax were re-
lated to: (1) tobacco smoke, (2) smoking ban, (3) second-
hand smoke and (4) children. An example of the search
syntax applied to title and abstract is shown in Additional
file 2. The search was restricted to German and English
language articles only, with no further restrictions on e.g.
publication year. An abbreviated version of the search
strategy was entered into the database OAlster for grey lit-
erature. Furthermore a manual search for additional arti-
cles was conducted in the two German public health
journals Prävention – Zeitschrift für Gesundheitsförderung
(Prevention - Journal for Health Promotion [own transla-
tion]) and Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung (Preven-
tion and Health Promotion [own translation]), which are
not captured by the aforementioned databases. The rea-
sons for including German language publications were
that smoke-free legislations of varying degrees of compre-
hensiveness
have
been
implemented
in
Germany.
Smoke-free legislation in Germany is governed at the
federal state level resulting in marked differences in extent
of protection against tobacco smoke. As international
journals were less likely to publish studies in effects of a
federal state legislation German language publications
were included in addition.
Since 2003, an annual conference on tobacco control
has been organized by the WHO collaborating center for
tobacco control at the German Cancer Research Center
(Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum; DKFZ). Presentations
and programs of these conferences were examined for
additional international or national relevant studies [19].
Finally, references of all articles fulfilling the eligibility cri-
teria were checked for further relevant studies. EndNote
X7.5 was used to organize the included studies.
Selection process
After removing duplicates, two reviewers independently
screened title and abstracts for the eligibility criteria..
When there was clear evidence for irrelevance, studies
were excluded. Full texts of all potentially relevant articles
were checked for eligibility by one author (SN) and finally
included after discussion with another author (GB).
Eligibility criteria
Studies were defined as eligible when they were based
on smoke-free legislations in terms of smoking bans in
public places (e.g. hospitality venues, further workplaces).
Internal regulations like school policies were not consid-
ered. Moreover, there had to be a before-after-design in
terms of at least two successive cross-sectional studies or
a cohort study to compare the SHS exposure of children
at home before and after the smoke-free legislation came
into effect. Studies reporting private smoking restrictions
in the home and studies with comparisons of countries
with
and
without
smoke-free
legislation
with
no
before-after data were not included. All types of quantita-
tive studies were included as long as they reported on SHS
exposure prevalence for children aged under 18 years. Data
Nanninga et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:749 
Page 2 of 12
 could be collected via self-report of exposure (by children
themselves or their parents), by analysis of biomarkers,
such as nicotine or cotinine, by indoor air pollution meas-
urement or by counting cigarette butts or ash trays. Stud-
ies comparing households with and without children were
excluded. Finally, only primary articles were included.
Evaluation of included studies
The data extraction was performed by the first author
(SN) and checked for accuracy for all studies by the last
author (GB). A pre-defined table was used for the evalu-
ation of the included studies. It contained information
about study design, type of SHS exposure, measurement
of exposure prevalence and main results. Studies were
classified as evaluating comprehensive smoke-free law or
mixed smoke-free law, according to the form of legisla-
tion that was introduced in the different countries the
studies
reported
on.
The
category
comprehensive
smoke-free law stands for a public smoking ban that af-
fects the whole country and offers no opportunity of
smoking in any hospitality venue, whereas the category
mixed smoke-free law comprises countries with regional
differences in the type or extent of public smoking bans
within a country or with an exceptional rule for certain
types of hospitality venues such as small bars.
A modified version of the quality checklist proposed
by Ogilvie et al. [20] was used for quality assessment.
The tool consisted of a five-item checklist to assess sev-
eral risks of bias and methodological quality criteria of
each study and a three-level scale to evaluate the suit-
ability of study design (Additional file 3). The quality of
the included studies was checked by two authors (SN,
GB) independently. A study was rated high quality when
at least 4 out of 5 points of the methodological quality
criteria were applied. Any disagreements were discussed
to achieve consensus and a final result.
Statistical methods for meta-analysis
All included studies presented proportions of children
exposed to SHS at home before and after introduction
of smoke-free legislation. When sample sizes of all
examined children were reported for both before and
after groups, sample sizes of exposed children were
calculated using these proportions. Given these values,
the relative risk (RR) of being exposed to SHS after the
introduction of smoke-free legislation compared to be-
fore legislation was calculated. A meta-analysis was con-
ducted to synthesize the results. A pooled RR with 95%
confidence interval (CI) was calculated to see how the
risk of being exposed to SHS changed after the introduc-
tion of a public smoking ban. The I2 statistic for hetero-
geneity was calculated to determine the proportion of
between-study variation [21]. A random effects model
using DerSimonian-Laird estimator for τ2 was used for
the pooled RR because the I2 test of heterogeneity was
highly significant (p < 0.001) [22]. Sensitivity analyses were
performed to explore possible causes of heterogeneity.
A funnel plot [23] was used to check whether there
could have been publication bias. The analysis was done
with R version 3.3.1 using the metafor package [24].
Results
After removing duplicates, 3037 potentially eligible arti-
cles were identified in the systematic search. Finally, 15
studies [10, 25–38] were included in this systematic
review with regard to the eligibility criteria. If several ar-
ticles had been published based on the same data of a
single study, these articles were considered as one study.
This was the case for two studies [29, 39]. The only ex-
ceptions to this were articles reporting on different (in-
dependent) regions within the same country, having
different smoke-free policies. As long as the data were
available, these articles were included in the analysis as
separate studies. This was the case for two studies
reporting on the CHETS survey for Scotland and Wales
[32, 34]. Articles reporting on the same data source but
with different data collection periods, lengths of follow-up
or different age groups, were also included in the analysis
as separate studies. This was the case for three studies
reporting on the Health Survey for England [26, 30, 33].
The entire search strategy can be reconstructed from
the PRISMA Flow diagram (Fig. 1).
Study characteristics
Of the 15 studies, 14 were repeated cross-sectional stud-
ies [10, 25–27, 29–38] and one was a prospective cohort
study [28]. Five Studies were conducted in Great Britain
[26, 30, 32–34]. Only two studies had a follow-up period
longer than one year [25, 38]. The sample size was very
large in most of the studies, ranging from 118 [28] to
68,000 [35] participants. Most of the children were aged
between five and 15 years. Eight studies reported on co-
tinine levels [10, 26, 28–30, 32–34]. All studies were
published between 2007 and 2016. Characteristics of the
included studies are summarized in Table 1.
Quality of the included studies
Detailed results of the quality assessment are presented
in Additional file 4. Almost every study only reached
the lowest category C for suitability of study design,
due to the lack of comparison groups. In contrast,
the methodological quality criteria were well covered
with the exception of the data collection instruments
criterion which was acceptable in only six studies
[26, 28, 30, 32–34]. This resulted from the fact that
data collection instruments were only seen as reasonable
when the studies used biomarkers to assess children’s SHS
exposure at home.

 Meta-analysis
The meta-analysis was summarized in a forest plot
(Fig. 2). Of the calculated RRs, 14 were based on expos-
ure measurements from parental report [25–38], and
one was based on exposure measurement verified by
hair
nicotine
concentration
(HNC)
[10].
Overall,
children had a lower risk of being exposed to SHS at
home after the introduction of a public smoking ban
(RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62–0.83, p < 0.0001). Only 2 stud-
ies had a RR above 1 [10, 28] indicating an increased RR
after the smoke-free legislation, but only one of these
two studies presented significant results [10]. The level
of heterogeneity was very high with I2 = 98.82%.
Almost all studies gave the same results by measuring
SHS exposure before and after smoke-free legislation via
self-report or biomarker. Only one study [34] stated that
self-reported
SHS
exposure
at
home
remained
unchanged, but the mean cotinine concentration fell by
39%. However, the proportion of children with higher
cotinine levels remained unchanged as well.
Sensitivity analyses
To investigate the sources of heterogeneity and to test
the robustness of the results of the meta-analysis, sev-
eral sensitivity analyses were performed (Additional
files 5, 6 and 7). The first sensitivity analysis included
only those nine studies with high quality [10, 26, 27,
30, 32–34, 36, 38]. The level of heterogeneity was
high (I2 = 98.5%) and the effect size was very similar
to the overall model (RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63–0.91,
p = 0.0037). The second sensitivity analysis considered
studies with children in special age groups. The first
group consisted of three studies [25, 32, 34] including
children aged 10–15 years. One study with children

Heterogeneity
disappeared
completely
(I2
= 0,
p =
0.7099) and the effect size decreased (RR = 0.96, 95%
CI = 0.91–1.00, p = 0.0497) in comparison to the over-
all model. The second group consisted out of four
studies considering children aged 0–6 years [28, 29,
31, 38]. In this case the level of heterogeneity was almost
100% (I2 = 99.0%) and the effect size was not significant
(RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.27–1.22, p = 0.1439). The third sen-
sitivity analysis compared studies with comprehensive
smoke-free law and with mixed smoke-free law. 11 studies
with comprehensive law were included [10, 25–34]. Het-
erogeneity was high (I2 = 96.4%) whereas the effect size
decreased
slightly
(RR = 0.83,
95%CI = 0.72–0.96,
p =
0.0155, p < 0.001). In contrast, the four studies [35–38]
with mixed smoke-free laws produced a more pronounced
effect size compared to the overall model (RR = 0.49, CI =
0.35–0.69); however, heterogeneity was high (I2 = 99.7%).
As mentioned before, three studies [26, 30, 33] reported
on results of the Health Survey of England and overlapped
in baseline and follow-up periods. Therefore, an additional
meta-analysis including only the one study with the high-
est quality [33] was conducted. However, the overall result
(RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.62–0.85, p < 0.0001) did not greatly
differ from the above-mentioned effect size.
Discussion
This meta-analysis shows that children’s SHS exposure at
home did not increase after the introduction of public
smoking bans. Therefore, the displacement hypothesis
was not confirmed. Of the 15 studies, only 2 reported in-
creased values for SHS exposure at home, however, 1 of
these 2 studies had only 118 participants [10, 28]. Never-
theless, the results must be interpreted with caution due
to high heterogeneity between the studies. Sensitivity ana-
lyses showed that heterogeneity still remained in the dif-
ferent age groups, in mixed or comprehensive law groups
and in quality-specific groups. The comprehensive and
mixed smoke-free law yielded reductions of SHS exposure
at home, whereby the effect was much greater in the
group with mixed smoke-free laws. However, the four
studies [35–38] in this group had a wide range of RRs
(Fig. 2). As mixed smoke-free laws included laws with ex-
emptions and laws that varied across regions, there might
also be a difference of the impact on SHS exposure within
this category. The number of four studies was too small to
further explore potential differences, more studies are
needed to prove an actual effect of these different ways of
implementation of tobacco control measures.
Another possible cause of heterogeneity in the findings
between the studies were differences in the way how
children’s SHS exposure at home was assessed. The
main reasons for heterogeneity are the various ways to
assess SHS exposure and to report on exposure propor-
tions. First, each study used a different framework to de-
fine the household smoking status. Some studies only
distinguished between “Yes, someone smokes regularly”
and “No, no-one smokes” [26]. Others built two or more

 categories, such as 1–3, 4–7 or any days exposed [27] or
1, 2–4, 5–7, and 8–10 h a day [29]. Second, not all in-
cluded studies considered the smoking behaviour of all
household members in their analysis. In some studies,
only the parents were considered for SHS exposure at
home (e.g. Kabir et al. [25], Fernandez et al. [28]), whereas
other studies also included smoking visitors (e.g. Jarvis et
al. [33], Holliday et al. [32]). One study [29] only used
mother-reported values of smoking fathers. In addition,
smoking within a family’s home was defined differently
concerning the relevant parts of a flat. One study [31] in-
cluded smoking on a balcony independently from smok-
ing inside the flat into the definition of SHS exposure,
because children are exposed to all SHS ingredients which
transiently adhere to clothes [40]. Other studies only con-
sidered smoking inside the flat or house.
Besides sensitivity analysis, meta-regression might have
been another reasonable way of exploring heterogeneity.
This
meta-analysis
rests
upon
published
data
of
statistical analyses. Due to the lack of data from the
primary studies such as the estimated treatment effect,
its variance, and covariate values for each study a
meta-regression was not possible.
The funnel plot (Additional file 8) shows that most of
the studies had a substantial sample size. The effects of two
studies with the smallest sample size [28, 29] are wide-
spread around the overall effect of the analyses, which is an
indicator against publication bias. Nevertheless, the studies
on the top of the funnel plot are mostly located asymmet-
rically on the right side of the overall effect [41]. The search
strategy of the present review contained grey literature in
order to reduce potential publication bias when consider-
ing only publications in peer-reviewed journals.
Other research
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to
focus on children’s SHS exposure at home before and
after the introduction of smoke-free legislations, based
on conducting a meta-analysis of pooled relative risks.
Borland et al. [42] searched for determinants of
smoke-free
homes
in
Canada,
the
UK,
USA
and
Australia within the International Tobacco Control
(ITC) Four Country Survey (ITC-4). Main predictors for
a reported smoke-free home or introduced home smok-
ing bans were having a child, especially a young child,
and having another non-smoking adult in the household.
Mons et al. used similar data from the International To-
bacco Control Policy Evaluation Project Europe surveys
and tried to find changes in predictors or changes of
home smoking bans after the introduction of smoke-free
laws in Ireland, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
The authors confirm having young children as a main
predictor of having a pre-legislation home smoking ban.
In addition, people who supported smoking bans in bars
were more likely to introduce home smoking bans [43].
These results support the findings of the present review
which came to the result that more than half of the
studies reported a reduction of children’s SHS exposure
at home. A study from New Zealand also evaluated the
impact of a national smoke-free law and concluded that
the reported SHS exposure at home was significantly re-
duced [17]. Callinan et al. conducted a review with 50
included studies and found no change of reported SHS
exposure at home [6]. However, neither of these latter
studies focused on children [6, 17].
Strengths and limitations
The present review as well as the included studies have
some limitations that need to be addressed. Only a small
number
of
15
studies
were
included
in
the
meta-analysis. Especially the category of studies present-
ing mixed smoke-free laws comprised only four studies
[35–38]. In addition to the small number of studies,
5 of the 15 studies were conducted in Great Britain
[26, 30, 32–34]. It would be interesting to have a
greater variation of included countries to see if the
results of the meta-analysis remained stable.
14 of the 15 included studies were cross-sectional
studies. Measuring exposure prevalences before and
after the introduction of public smoking bans using a
cohort study design would be preferable as varying sam-
ples of children included in a repeated cross-sectional
design might bias the results.
For most of the included studies the suitability of
study design was the lowest category (i.e. C), with excep-
tion of the study of Jarvis et al. [33] who reached
category B. Nevertheless, nine studies fulfilled four
or more out of five of the methodological quality
criteria [10, 26, 27, 30, 32–34, 36, 38].
Another limitation might be the use of self-reports for
collecting data on children’s SHS exposure at home. In
14 out of 15 studies children’s exposure to SHS was
measured based on parents self-reports. This measure
may be particularly prone to social desirability bias and
hence exaggerate the reduction in children’s SHS expos-
ure - particularly if the diffusion hypothesis is correct
and smoke-free legislation results in changed social
norms about smoking in the present of children [15].
Therefore, as methodological quality criterion of cred-
ibility of data collection instruments within the applied
quality checklist, any biochemical measurement of SHS
exposure (such as the validated specific and sensitive
biomarker cotinine [44]) was assumed to be of higher
quality than parental reports. Nevertheless, cotinine
gives information about total SHS exposure which may
not only occur within the child’s home. In addition, par-
ental reports about SHS exposure answered by parents
are essentially valid [45, 46]. Thus, it is assumed that
Nanninga et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:749 
Page 9 of 12
 data collection by parental report did not substantially
bias the results on children’s SHS exposure at home.
Our assumption is in line with the observation that the
impact of the smoke-free legislation on children’s SHS
exposure was irrespective of method of exposure assess-
ment (self-report vs. biomarker).
The short period of follow-up after the introduction of
smoke-free legislation is another limitation. Repeated
measurements over a longer follow-up period might re-
veal more information about when and how tobacco con-
trol policies influenced the parental smoking behaviour in
a child’s home [15]. Long-term effects could not be con-
sidered because only two studies [25, 33] had a follow-up
period longer than one year after the introduction of a
smoke-free legislation. Nevertheless, even these two stud-
ies concluded that there is no impact at all [25] or a posi-
tive impact [33] of smoke-free legislation on children’s
SHS exposure at home. Just recently, a further follow-up
period of four years on the effects of the comprehensive
smoking ban in Bavaria, Germany, on children’s SHS ex-
posure at home first examined by Bolte et al. has been
published [47]. This further follow-up demonstrated a
positive impact on children’s SHS exposure at home.
Only two studies [35, 36] took other tobacco control
policies such as increasing prices and advertising into ac-
count in their analysis which has been introduced at the
same time as the smoke-free legislation. The effects of
public smoking bans might be moderated by other policies
actually contributing to changes of SHS exposure at home.
Moreover, not only the combination of several tobacco
control measures but even the societal debate might have
had an impact. For example, Jarvis et al. [33] stated that
the actual starting point of decreasing SHS exposure in
England was not the introduction of a smoke-free legisla-
tion, but the intense national debate on the implementa-
tion of a smoke-free law. For the studies included in the
present meta-analysis, it would be interesting to know
whether the cross-sectional studies performed before
smoke-free legislation came into force took place during
times of societal disputes about tobacco control and the
protection of non-smokers.
The present review also has some strengths. First, the
meta-analysis had considerable sensitivity. By converting
proportions into relative risks, every effect from each
study can be compared on the same level. The broad
range of literature search is also a strength of this review.
Including a manual search in journals not covered by the
electronic databases and also the grey literature, helped to
identify as many eligible studies as possible. A strength of
most of the included studies was the large sample size.
Conclusion
The present meta-analysis shows that up to now there is
no indication of displacement of smoking into homes
after the introduction of smoke-free legislations. How-
ever, since only 15 studies were included in the analyses,
additional studies are required to assess the impact of
public smoking bans on children’s SHS exposure at
home. More detailed results might be achieved if other
tobacco control measures and their effects on SHS ex-
posure at home are also taken into account. Finally, as
most of the studies had a short follow-up period,
long-term studies on this topic are also required.
