IMPORTANCE Substance use is a major driver of the HIV epidemic and is associated with poor
HIV care outcomes. Patient navigation (care coordination with case management) and the
use of financial incentives for achieving predetermined outcomes are interventions
increasingly promoted to engage patients in substance use disorders treatment and HIV care,
but there is little evidence for their efficacy in improving HIV-1 viral suppression rates.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of a structured patient navigation intervention with or
without financial incentives to improve HIV-1 viral suppression rates among patients with
elevated HIV-1 viral loads and substance use recruited as hospital inpatients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From July 2012 through January 2014, 801 patients
with HIV infection and substance use from 11 hospitals across the United States were
randomly assigned to receive patient navigation alone (n = 266), patient navigation plus
financial incentives (n = 271), or treatment as usual (n = 264). HIV-1 plasma viral load was
measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
INTERVENTIONS Patient navigation included up to 11 sessions of care coordination with case
management and motivational interviewing techniques over 6 months. Financial incentives
(up to $1160) were provided for achieving targeted behaviors aimed at reducing substance
use, increasing engagement in HIV care, and improving HIV outcomes. Treatment as usual
was the standard practice at each hospital for linking hospitalized patients to outpatient HIV
care and substance use disorders treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was HIV viral suppression (�200
copies/mL) relative to viral nonsuppression or death at the 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS Of 801 patients randomized, 261 (32.6%) were women (mean [SD] age, 44.6 years
[10.0 years]). There were no differences in rates of HIV viral suppression versus
nonsuppression or death among the 3 groups at 12 months. Eighty-five of 249 patients
(34.1%) in the usual-treatment group experienced treatment success compared with 89 of
249 patients (35.7%) in the navigation-only group for a treatment difference of 1.6% (95% CI,
−6.8% to 10.0%; P = .80) and compared with 98 of 254 patients (38.6%) in the
navigation-plus-incentives group for a treatment difference of 4.5% (95% CI −4.0% to 12.8%;
P = .68). The treatment difference between the navigation-only and the navigation-plus-
incentives group was −2.8% (95% CI, −11.3% to 5.6%; P = .68).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with HIV infection and
substance use, patient navigation with or without financial incentives did not have a
beneficial effect on HIV viral suppression relative to nonsuppression or death at 12 months vs
treatment as usual. These findings do not support these interventions in this setting.

T
he US National HIV/AIDS Strategy calls for improved en-
gagement in care and increased viral suppression for
people living with HIV.1 Yet it has been estimated that
only 30% of the 1.2 million persons with HIV infection in the
United States in 2011 were virally suppressed,2 and according
to data collected during 1999-2007 from an observational HIV
natural history study,3 many were hospitalized with condi-
tions preventable through HIV treatment. Substance use is
likely a major factor in poor HIV clinical outcomes.4,5 To im-
prove their health, persons with HIV infection and substance
use may require treatment for substance use disorders in con-
cert with HIV treatment.6,7 Few randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) have evaluated such approaches.
Two potential approaches to support individuals with sub-
stance use in achieving viral suppression are (1) patient naviga-
tion(carecoordinationwithcasemanagement)and(2)financial
incentivesforachievingpredeterminedoutcomes.Previousre-
searchsuggestspotentialforthecombinationoftheseinterven-
tions in improving engagement with substance use disorders

of a navigation intervention to improve linkage to care, but vi-
ralsuppressionwasnotanoutcome.10Randomizedclinicaltrials
demonstrate a positive effect of financial incentives on adher-
ence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)11,12; however, effects of fi-
nancialincentivesonengagementincareandviralsuppression
have been mixed.13-15
Given these results, Hospital Visit as Opportunity for Pre-
vention and Engagement for HIV-infected Drug Users (Project
HOPE) was designed as an RCT of patient navigation with or
without financial incentives among patients with HIV infec-
tion and substance use recruited as inpatients. The study hy-
pothesized the proportion of patients with viral suppression
(plasmaHIVviralload≤200copies/mL)relativetononsuppres-
sion or death would be greatest in the patient navigation plus
financial incentives followed by the patient navigation group,
and both groups would have higher rates of suppression than
patients receiving treatment as usual.
Methods
The trial had a 3 parallel-group, repeated-measures design in
whichinpatientswithHIVinfectionwererecruitedfrom11hos-
pitals across the United States from July 2012 through January
2014. The full protocol is available online (eProtocol in
Supplement1).Theprotocolwasapprovedbyinstitutionalreview
boards at all participating institutions. After providing written
informed consent, individuals were screened to determine eli-
gibility.Aftereligibleindividualswereenrolled,theyunderwent

were then randomly assigned in equal proportions to receive

navigationplusfinancialincentives,or(3)treatmentasusual.Pa-
tientnavigationwasconductedbystudystaffmemberswhohad
previousexperienceinsocialwork,casemanagement,discharge
planning, or delivery of health or prevention services. At 6 and
12 months after randomization, participants had viral load and
CD4 cell counts measured and completed follow-up computer-
assisted personal interviews along with urine drug and alcohol
breathalyzer screens. Participants were reimbursed up to $210
for completing nonintervention-related activities. Medical rec-
ords were reviewed to document use of HIV care and hospital-
izations during the study period. Follow-up was completed in
April 2015 and data were locked (ie, closed to further data
entry) in June 2015. To facilitate screening efforts, a prescreen-
ing procedure was implemented at 9 of the 11 sites whereby pa-
tients who were ineligible according to CD4 count or viral load
in medical records were not approached for screening.
Participantswereeligibleifthey(1)wereinpatientswithHIV

HIV infection located in the following cities: Atlanta, Georgia;
Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Birmingham,
Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, Califor-
nia; Miami, Florida; New York, New York; and Philadelphia and

Key Points
Question Compared with current level of care, what is the effect
of patient navigation (care coordination with case management)
with or without financial incentives (to achieve predetermined
outcomes) on viral suppression among hospitalized patients with
HIV infection and substance use?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 801 patients
from 11 hospitals in the United States, there was no significant
difference in rates of HIV viral suppression among the study groups
at 12 months (6 months after the intervention ended).
Meaning This trial shows that compared to current level of care,
patient navigation with or without financial incentives did not
increase viral suppression among hospitalized patients with HIV
infection and substance use.

Patient Navigation
Participants in this group had up to 11 sessions with a patient
navigator during the 6-month intervention. Patient naviga-
tors received 24 hours of initial training, were monitored for
fidelity, and received performance feedback from the study in-
tervention team weekly. The first session most frequently oc-
curred at the hospital bedside with the patient navigator work-
ing to motivate and assist participants to engage in HIV care
and initiate or continue ART. Subsequent sessions were held
in multiple locations (eg, patient navigator’s office, in partici-
pants’livingenvironment).Patientnavigatorsusedastrengths-
based case management approach—which involves assisting
patients to capitalize on their abilities, inner resources, knowl-
edge, and motivation allowing them to better cope with on-
going life challenges,10,17,18 and they incorporated techniques
from motivational interviewing, a collaborative, goal-
oriented style of communication designed to strengthen per-
sonal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by elic-
iting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within
an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.19 They worked
with participants to (1) coordinate care with clinicians; (2) re-
view health information; (3) overcome personal or logistical
challenges(eg,accesstotransportation,childcare);and(4)pro-
videpsychosocialsupportdirectly,byencouragingparticipant-
identified sources of support and making appropriate refer-
rals. Patient navigators accompanied participants to the first
substance use disorders treatment and HIV care appoint-
ments. Patients in this group received no financial incentives
for attending intervention sessions.
Patient Navigation Plus Financial Incentives
Participants in this group received the structured 6-month pa-
tientnavigation-plus-financial-incentivesintervention.Thefi-
nancial incentives plan was designed to enhance motivation
and engagement in health-related behaviors essential to
achieve the primary outcome.
Incentive amounts were designed to provide frequent
positive reinforcement on an escalating scale, in amounts suf-
ficient to motivate throughout the 6-month intervention
period, for multiple targeted behaviors that mediate (eg, doc-
tor visits, receipt of HIV medications) or interfere (eg, sub-
stance use) with achieving viral suppression. Patient naviga-
tors provided incentives for 7 target behaviors: (1) attending
up to 11 patient navigation sessions (up to $220); (2) comple-
tion of required identification, insurance and other paper-
work($80);(3)4visitstoanHIVclinic($180);(4)attendingsub-
stance use disorders treatment ($90); (5) submitting drug and
alcohol-negative specimens to the patient navigator ($220);
(6) having blood drawn at 2 laboratory visits ($50); and (7) hav-
ing an active prescription for ART ($170). A $50 incentive was
earnedbyparticipantswhoachievedatleasta2log10dropfrom
baseline viral load within 4 months after randomization and
$100 for a suppressed viral load at the 6-month study follow-
up.Aparticipantinthenavigation-plus-incentivesgroupcould
earn up to $1160 during the 6-month intervention.
Treatment as Usual
Participants in this group received the standard treatment pro-
vided at each hospital for linking hospitalized patients to out-
patient HIV care and substance use disorders treatment. Des-
ignatedhospitalstaffmembers,socialworkers,casemanagers,
attendingphysicians,andinfectiousdiseasesconsultantswere
responsible for scheduling an outpatient HIV care appoint-
ment. Standard practice for linking patients to substance use
disorders treatment at most hospitals was written referral. Pa-
tient navigators did not interact with participants assigned to
the treatment as usual group.
Intervention Fidelity
All patient navigation intervention sessions were audio re-
corded with participant consent, and 7.5% of the recordings
were reviewed randomly during the trial to provide feedback
to patient navigators and ensure high-quality delivery. Re-
quired activities such as assessing the patient’s readiness to
access substance use disorders treatment were rated using a
4-point scale: 0, not at all; 1, somewhat; 2, mostly; and 3, com-
pletely. Median ratings between 1.5 and 2.5 were classified as
good, and those higher than 2.5 were classified as excellent.
Measures
HIV-1viralloadandCD4cellcountweremeasuredbylocallabo-
ratories.Urinedrugscreensweretakenat6and12months.HIV
medication adherence was measured by self-report as the per-
centage of pills taken in the last 30 days.20 HIV care and sub-
stance use disorders treatment use were assessed.21,22 Specific
substancesusedoutsideofmedicalpurposesinthelastyearand
over the last 30 days were assessed using the substance mod-
ule of the Addiction Severity Index.23,24 Substance use sever-
ity was measured by a combination of the Drug Abuse Screen-
ingTest(DAST)-1025andtheAUDIT.26Participantswerecounted
as having a severe substance use problem if they had a 6 or
higher on the DAST-10 or 6 (for women) or 7 (for men) or higher
on the AUDIT. Injection drug use (IDU) was measured using an
adaptation of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)
risk behaviors module.27,28 Additional baseline measures, in-
cluding housing stability and psychological distress, were de-
termined using validated instruments.29-31

Outcomes
TheprimaryoutcomewasHIVviralsuppression(definedashav-
ing a viral load of ≤200 copies/mL) versus HIV viral nonsup-
pression or death at 12 months. The protocol specified 9 HIV-
related secondary outcomes with 6 reported herein. The
protocol specified 4 substance use-related outcomes with 3 re-
ported herein. The protocol also listed 5 analyses of mediators
and moderators that are not reported herein. Reported second-
ary HIV-related outcomes included HIV viral suppression at 6
months,outpatientcarewithanHIVspecialist,havingbeenpre-
scribed HIV medications, HIV medication adherence as mea-
suredbythepercentageofpillstakenoverthelastmonthatboth
6 and 12 months. Substance use–related outcomes were as-
sessed at 6 and 12 months and included attending professional
substance use disorders treatment, level of substance use mea-
suredbyurineandbreathalyzeranalysis,andself-reportofsub-
stance use severity. For completeness, in planned analyses the
primary outcome was disaggregated into viral suppression and
death and in post hoc analyses professional substance use dis-
orders treatment was disaggregated into residential outpa-
tient treatment and into an indicator for whether medication–
assisted substance use disorders treatment was used.
Analyses
Thefullstatisticalanalysisplanisavailable(eSAPinSupplement
3). Hypotheses were tested using generalized estimating equa-
tions including both 6- and 12-month data and controlled for
the baseline level of the particular outcome measure. Specific
tests for the 2 follow-up assessments were done by structured
contrastsbasedonthissinglerepeated-measuresmodelforeach
outcome.AtypeIerrorrateof0.05wasusedwith2-sidedtests;
a simple closed-testing procedure32 controlled the type-I error
to 0.05 per outcome. This procedure assigns the P value for a
comparison of any 2 groups, the larger of the simple 2-group
comparisons’ P value and the 2-degree of freedom P value as-
sociated with the overall test of difference among all 3 groups.
In the primary analysis, control variables included site of re-
cruitment, baseline viral suppression, and an indicator for
whether CD4 cell count was more than 350 cells/μL. All ran-
domized participants were included; however, those who had
notdiedbuthadmissingviralloaddatawereexcludedfromthe
primary analyses. Participants who were otherwise lost to
follow-up but had viral load data available in medical records
wereincluded.Potentialheterogeneityintreatmenteffectswas
examinedinsecondaryanalysesevaluatinginteractionsoftreat-
ment with site, baseline viral suppression, stimulant use
(cocaine, ecstasy, or amphetamines), and patient-reported so-
ciodemographiccharacteristics:ethnicity(Hispanicornot),race
(black, white, and other), and sex. Race/ethnicity and sex were
included due to the documented difference in HIV care out-
comes by these factors33-36; patients endorsed all racial catego-
ries that applied. All secondary analyses included the control
variables used in the primary analysis as well as the baseline
value of the particular secondary outcome.
Statistical Power
Preplanned power estimated using simulations in SAS 9.3 as-
sumed a 12% to 15% death rate and up to 15% additional attri-
tion at 12 months. Simulations assumed at least 12% absolute
differences between treatment as usual and patient naviga-
tion groups with or without financial incentives and that sup-
pression in the treatment-as-usual group ranged from 10% to
15%. These simulations estimated that 266 participants per
group or a total of 798 participants would result in 87% power
or greater for all comparisons.
Results
There were 12 118 hospital admissions among 7769 undupli-
cated patients with HIV infection at the participating hospi-
tals during the recruitment period. Prior to establishment of
prescreening procedures, 1376 patients were entered into for-
mal screening. After prescreening, 3025 patients were ineli-
gible and 1848, eligible based on CD4 cell count or HIV viral
load. A total of 915 of the 1848 eligible participants were for-
mally screened. This resulted in 2291 patients assessed for eli-
gibility and 801 randomized. Reasons for exclusion, random-
ization,andfollow-upareshownintheFigure.The64.5%were
ineligible because of substance use criteria. The randomized
sample was more likely than the nonrandomized sample to be
unstably housed, incarcerated, or unemployed; lack health in-
surance; and have lower income and less education (Table 1).
Approximately one-third (32.5%) of the randomized sample
(Table 2) had a history of IDU with 18.4% injecting during the
prior 12 months.
Primary Outcome
The analysis of viral suppression vs nonsuppression or death
included 774 of 801 patients (96.6%) of the randomized par-
ticipants with 752 (93.9%) providing data at the primary out-
come assessment at 12 months. There were no differences in
HIV viral suppression rates among the 3 groups at 12 months
(Table 3; treatment success: navigation only, 35.7%; naviga-
tion plus incentives, 38.6%; and usual treatment, 34.1% of pa-
tients).Comparedwithusualtreatment,theriskdifference(RD)
for the navigation-only group was 1.6% (95% CI, −6.8% to
10.0%) and for the navigation-plus-incentives group was 4.5%
(95% CI, −4.0% to 12.8%). When comparing the 2 navigation
groups, the RD (navigation only −[navigation plus incen-
tives]) was −2.8% (95% CI, −11.3% to 5.6%). There was no evi-
dence of treatment heterogeneity; the treatment interactions
with site (P = . 83), black race (P = .28), Hispanic ethnicity
(P = .84), sex (P = .61), or use of stimulants (P = .84) were not
statistically significant (Table 4). There were however, signifi-
cantmaineffectsforthesefactors.Acrossalltreatmentgroups,
black race (33.2%) vs nonblack race (46.3%; RD, −13.1%; 95%
CI, −21.7% to −4.5%), use of stimulants (32.2%) vs no use of
stimulants (45.5%; RD, −13.3%; 95% CI, −21.0% to −5.7%), and
enrollinginasiteinthesouthernUnitedStates(29.0%)vsother
regions (46.5%, RD, −17.5%; 95% CI, −24.5% to −10.5%) were
associated with lower proportions of patients with

no difference in rates of substance use disorders treatment en-
gagement at 12 months (Table 3).
Intervention Duration and Fidelity
The median number of sessions completed in the navigation-
only group was 7 sessions (interquartile range [IQR], 5-10),
whereas the median in the patient navigation-plus-incentives
group was all 11 sessions (IQR, 8-11, P < .001). A total of 326 of
the 4535 sessions (7.5%) delivered were rated for fidelity on a
scale with a maximum score of 3. The median score on this rat-
ing varied between 2.2 and 2.75. There were no differences be-
tween the navigation groups in fidelity. A total of 267 of 271 pa-
tients(98.5%)inthenavigation-plus-incentivesgroupreceived
a median payment of $716 (IQR, $495-$890).

Discussion
InthisstudyofhospitalizedpatientswithpoorlycontrolledHIV
infection and substance use, 2 intensive but relatively short-
term interventions did not result in higher rates of viral sup-
pression relative to viral nonsuppression or death at the
12-month follow-up, which was 6 months after completion of
theinterventions.Acrossallstudygroups,alittlemorethanone-
third of participants achieved viral suppression at 12 months.
Theinterventionapproachinthemostenhancedgroup(pa-
tientnavigationplusfinancialincentives)soughttosupportmul-
tiplehealthbehaviorsandlinkagetobothHIVcareandsubstance
use disorders treatment. It was conceptualized that once the
6-monthinterventionphasewasconcluded,thepositiveaspects
of being engaged in HIV care and substance use disorders treat-
ment would help overcome potential barriers to care and treat-
mentandwouldtranslatetosustainedviralsuppression.6,7This
was not the case. The observed intervention effect of viral sup-
pressionat6monthsmaybeexplainedbyparticipants’engage-
ment in HIV care and substance use disorders treatment, con-
sistent with the interventions’ conceptual model. It should be
noted,however,thatthissecondaryoutcomeisoneofmanysec-
ondary outcomes and even at 6 months, fewer than half of par-
ticipants in the intervention group achieved viral suppression.
It is possible that the lack of substance use disorders treat-
ment options affected study results. Participation in sub-
stance use disorders treatment was low across groups with no
decrease in overall substance use and severity of use. In the
study interventions, patient navigators sought to engage par-
ticipants using substances with available treatment services.
Several study sites did not reside in jurisdictions that offered
harm reduction services. Also, the majority of the study par-
ticipants used stimulants, a group that was less likely to be-
come virally suppressed compared with those who only used
opiates,alcohol,orboth.Althoughtheavailabilityofsubstance

a Unadjusted counts, proportions and risk differences with associated 95% confidence intervals are presented.
P-values are from adjusted model which included control variables. Control variables include site of recruitment,
and indicator for HIV viral suppression at baseline, an indicator for CD4 cell count >350 cells/μL, and the baseline
realization of the dependent measure.
bViral load was determined at the 12-month assessment. Other outcomes are assessed at 12 months and refer to
behaviors that occurred between 6 and 12 months.
c Viral suppression is �200 copies/mL. Analysis excludes deaths.
dParticipants who died by 6-mo are also counted in deaths at 12 months.
e Due to classification error the model replaces the control for Site with an indicator for site being in the South.
f Model is estimated using the negative binomial link.
g Medications were about 75% methadone and 25% buprenorphine.
h Urine drug screens were done on the full sample at 6 and 12 months only. Patients in the
navigation-plus-incentives group underwent additional urine drug screens as part of the intervention.
i Severe substance use was indicated if a patient had a Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)-10 score of 6 or higher
or an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 6 or higher for women (men, 7 or higher).
j Viral load was determined at the 6-mo assessment. Other outcomes are assessed at 6 mo and refer to behaviors
that occurred between baseline and 6 mo.
k The adjusted P value is significant, but the unadjusted difference is not and therefore the unadjusted 95% CI
in the Table includes zero.

sured, this suggests the need for more acceptable or acces-
sible interventions for substance use disorders treatment, par-
ticularlyamongstimulantusers.Inaddition,itshouldbenoted
that this trial cannot rule out the possibility that financial in-
centives, patient navigation, or both may be effective inter-
ventions to improve outcomes for individuals already en-
gaged in substance use disorders treatment.
StudyparticipantsrepresentpatientswithHIVinfectionand
complexissues;manypresentwithmultiplecomorbiditiesthat
exceedsubstanceusedisorders,includingconsiderablesocialdis-
advantage. The study results raise the question of whether in-
tensive,individual-levelinterventionsaresufficientlybroadand
robustenoughtoimproveHIVoutcomesamongpopulationscur-
rently not benefitting from treatment. Most participants were
low-income persons of color who may experience negative so-
cioculturalfactorssuchaspoverty,racism,unstablehousing,HIV-
related stigma, and high rates of incarceration. Systemic and
structural barriers to care may be difficult to overcome with an
individual-levelbehavioralintervention,evenanintensiveone;
forexample,thisstudyfoundthatblackparticipants(compared
with white participants) and participants from southern sites
were less likely to be virally suppressed. This is consistent with
studiesthathaveshowndemographicandgeographicvariation
in HIV clinical outcomes.33,37,38
Even though the study had high retention and interven-
tionfidelityrates,severallimitationsshouldbenoted.Themean
numberofsessionscompletedbyparticipantsinthenavigation-
plus-incentives group was significantly higher than it was for
the navigation-only group. This may result from the offer of fi-
nancial incentives, which increased overall attendance in the
intervention. In any case, the larger number of patient naviga-
tion sessions combined with financial incentives would have
beenexpectedtoincreasethelikelihoodofefficacyinthisstudy
group compared with treatment as usual; this was not the case.
The absence of a financial incentives–only condition pre-
vented the ability to examine the independent effect of finan-
cial incentives. Also, the secondary outcomes, use of HIV care,
substance use disorders treatment, and use of ART were based
onself-report,yetmedicalrecordreviewdidconfirmresultsfor
HIVcareandprescriptionforART.Inaddition,thescreeningpro-
cess relied on historical medical records to document viral load
and thus a small number of participants entered the study with
viralsuppressionatbaseline.Noneoftheselimitationsarelikely
to have influenced the study outcome.
Conclusions
Among hospitalized patients with HIV infection and substance
use, patient navigation with or without financial incentives did
not have a beneficial effect on HIV viral suppression relative to
nonsuppressionordeathat12monthscomparedwithtreatment
as usual. These findings do not support these interventions in
