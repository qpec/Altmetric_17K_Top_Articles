Background-—Although current guidelines emphasize the importance of social support to the success of left ventricular assist
device (LVAD) therapy, few studies examine the influence of the caregiver on patient outcomes or quantify the impact of LVAD
caregiving on caregiver outcomes. The purpose of this analysis was to identify patient and caregiver determinants of patient quality
of life (QOL) and caregiver strain in response to LVAD therapy.
Methods and Results-—Data on patients receiving LVAD therapy and their caregivers (n=50 dyads) were prospectively collected
pre-implantation and 1, 3, and 6 months post-implantation. Growth curve modeling was used to describe change in patient QOL
(Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) and caregiver strain (Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index). Patient QOL improved
most in the first month (b=23.22�3.76, P<0.001), followed by gradual gains over 6 months (b=1.90�0.64, P<0.01). Caregivers
experienced worsening of strain in the first month (b=4.30�1.42, P<0.01), followed by gradual resolution to pre-implantation
levels by 6 months (b=�0.71�0.23, P<0.01). Worse pre-implantation patient symptoms were associated with greater
improvement in patient QOL (b=0.53�0.19, P<0.01) but worsening caregiver strain (b=0.15�0.07, P=0.04). Better relationship
quality was associated with greater improvement in patient QOL (b=14.39�5.85, P=0.01) and less pre-implantation caregiver
strain (b=�9.31�2.28, P<0.001). Nonspousal caregivers experienced less pre-implantation strain (b=�8.60�3.10, P=0.01), and
patients with nonspousal caregivers had less improvement in QOL (b=�3.70�1.62, P=0.02).
Conclusions-—A combination of patient and caregiver characteristics predicts patient and caregiver response to LVAD therapy.
Including caregiver factors in future studies may be helpful in developing interventions that improve patient and caregiver
outcomes, together. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008080. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.008080.)
Key Words: caregivers • heart failure • quality of life • ventricular assist device
P
eople with advanced heart failure (HF) have limited
treatment options: many patients with advanced HF are
not eligible for transplantation or will die on the wait list
without intervention.1 Thus, mechanical circulatory support
with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has become a
primary therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for
transplantation but would benefit from permanent support
(destination therapy [DT]) or who require a bridge to
transplantation.1 For LVAD therapy to be successful, guide-
lines recommend strong social support, and many centers
require patients to have a designated primary caregiver (ie,
unpaid family member or friend) to assist with post-LVAD
management.2,3 Despite recent evidence that caregiver
characteristics may directly affect LVAD patient mortality,4
few quantitative studies have examined the influence of
caregivers on LVAD patient outcomes or have quantified the
impact of LVAD caregiving on the caregiver.
Quality of life (QOL) is a major outcome of interest in LVAD
therapy,5 and although LVAD is typically associated with QOL
improvement, there is substantial variability in QOL outcomes
post-implantation, with some patients doing well and others
not doing well.6,7 As such, there is a current need for research
that better predicts QOL outcomes post-LVAD and identifies
potential intervention targets, particularly for DT patients who
will permanently live with the device.8 Similarly, there is a call

 for more research on LVAD therapy caregivers, about whom
little is known quantitatively but who likely experience
considerable caregiver strain (often called “caregiver bur-
den”), a subjective measure of stress related to caregiving
that is a known predictor of increased morbidity and
mortality.8–11 More important, caregiver characteristics are
known to influence patient outcomes and vice versa, in
chronic illness in general and HF in particular,12,13 supporting
quantitative approaches in LVAD therapy that consider both
patient and caregiver factors as predictors of patient and
caregiver outcomes. Thus, the purpose of this analysis is to
identify patient and caregiver determinants of patient QOL
and caregiver strain in response to LVAD therapy.
Methods
Because of the sensitive nature of the data collected for this
study, requests to access the data set from qualified
researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols
may be sent to the corresponding author.
Study Design and Population
This was a prospective longitudinal study of patients receiving
an LVAD and their caregivers (n=50 dyads, where each dyad
consists of a patient and associated caregiver).14,15 Because
little research has been done to examine patient-caregiver
dyads in LVAD therapy, no formal sample size calculation
based on expected effect sizes was conducted; rather, sample
size was primarily determined by the number of patients and
caregivers it was feasible to enroll during the funding period
on the basis of center implantation rates. In short, patients
were eligible for enrollment if they were ≥21 years of age,
eligible to receive an LVAD, and without previous heart
transplantation. Adult (≥21 years of age) caregivers were
eligible if they were the primary caregiver of the patient, as
agreed on by the patient, caregiver, and clinical team. Data
were collected at 4 time points: immediately prior (median,
5 days) to implantation and 1, 3, and 6 months post-
implantation. Patient and caregiver demographic, psychoso-
cial, and person-oriented outcomes data were collected via
survey. Patient clinical information was abstracted from the
medical record. Study procedures were approved by the
Oregon Health and Science University Institutional Review
Board, and all participants provided written informed consent.
Convenience sampling was used to screen and offer
enrollment to all patient-caregiver dyads receiving LVAD
therapy at the center from July 1, 2013 through December 1,
2015. During this time period, 9 patients undergoing LVAD
therapy were implanted at the center and were not enrolled in
the study: 2 refusals (“overwhelmed” and felt “too sick”), 2
ineligible (<21 years of age and biventricular assist device
use), 3 emergent implantations who were too sick to
approach, and 2 LVAD exchanges. There were no differences
in sociodemographic characteristics between those enrolled
and those not enrolled, but the patients not enrolled because
of refusal or emergent implantation were likely sicker.
Furthermore, there were 8 patients undergoing LVAD therapy
who were enrolled but not included in this dyadic study
because of the following reasons: 5 had not identified a
primary informal caregiver at the time of implantation, 2 did
not have an English-speaking caregiver, and 1 caregiver
refused (did not have time). The caregiver who refused was
not significantly different sociodemographically from the
enrolled caregivers in the study, but the 2 non–English-
speaking caregivers were both Hispanic, compared with our
enrolled caregivers, who were mostly non-Hispanic. It is not
known how this center’s LVAD therapy population sociode-
mographically compares with other LVAD therapy centers in
the state of Oregon; however, at the time of enrollment, this
center was responsible for implanting the overwhelming
majority of patients undergoing LVAD therapy and residing in
Oregon (as well as many in southwest Washington).
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is one of the first quantitative studies of caregiver strain
(ie, burden) in modern left ventricular assist device therapy,
and it is one of the first to examine how the patient-
caregiver relationship may influence both patient and
caregiver outcomes.
• Caregiver strain worsens immediately after implantation and
then returns to pre-implantation levels over 6 months, but it
does not further improve.
• The severity of heart failure symptoms was associated with
both patient and caregiver outcomes.
• The quality of the patient-caregiver relationship was asso-
ciated with better outcomes for both, and may be a
protective target for future interventions.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Given
that
a
combination
of
patient,
caregiver,
and
relationship factors likely affect both patient and caregiver
outcomes in left ventricular assist device therapy, interdis-
ciplinary clinical approaches that consider both the patient
and the caregiver as individuals, as well as the character-
istics and health of their relationship to one another, may be
more effective than solely patient-focused approaches.
• Unlike patient quality of life after left ventricular assist
device therapy, which improves on average, caregiver strain
does not improve from baseline levels; caregivers likely
need support before and after left ventricular assist device
therapy to manage caregiver strain and reduce associated
morbidity.

QOL and Strain in LVAD Patient-Caregiver Dyads

 Measurement
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Patients and caregivers reported demographic information
(age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and
employment), and caregivers reported patient-caregiver rela-
tionship type and duration. Patients’ pre-implantation clinical
characteristics were abstracted from the medical record (cause
and duration of HF, New York Heart Association class, ejection
fraction, LVAD therapy type, and comorbidities16). Caregivers
reported their comorbidities using a validated measure.17
Patient HF-specific QOL
The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire was used to
measure patient QOL.18 The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
Questionnaire is a multidimensional HF-specific QOL measure
that has been recommended for use in LVAD therapy.5 The 3-
item QOL subscale, which asks patients about the overall
impact of HF on life enjoyment, rather than about the
presence or absence of particular HF symptoms, was used for
this analysis. Patients respond on a 5-point Likert scale, and
scores are normed to a potential range of 0 to 100, with
higher scores indicating better QOL.18
Caregiver strain
The Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index was used to
measure subjective perceptions of stress related to the
caregiving role (ie, subjective caregiver strain or burden, as
opposed to objective quantification of time spent caregiving or
number of caregiving activities).19 The Multidimensional Care-
giver Strain Index is a multidimensional measure of strain with
an 18-item Total Strain score. Caregivers respond on a 5-point
Likert scale, and Total Strain scores are summed for a potential
range of 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater (worse)
strain. Subscale scores can also be calculated for each of the
dimensions of caregiving strain the Multidimensional Caregiver
Strain Index measures: (1) Physical Strain (ie, declining physical
health or fatigue), (2) Social Constraints (ie, compromised
social life or unable to leave the home), (3) Financial Strain (ie,
financial costs cause strain or resentment), (4) Time Con-
straints (ie, no time for self-care or to fulfill other obligations),
(5) Interpersonal Strain (ie, feeling resentful or strained
relationship with the care recipient), and (6) Demanding Patient
(ie, patient is overly demanding or manipulative). Subscale
ranges vary depending on the number of items; thus, to
facilitate comparisons between sources of strain, subscale
scores were standardized to range from 0 to 100.
Physical symptoms
Patient physical symptoms of HF (eg, fatigue, weight gain,
orthopnea, and dyspnea) pre-implantation were measured
using the Heart Failure Somatic Perception Scale (HFSPS).20
The 18-item HFSPS asks patients about how bothersome
symptoms are on a 6-point (0–5) Likert scale, with 0 indicating
the patient did not have the symptom, and 1 to 5 indicating
symptom severity. Scores are summed for a potential range of
0 to 90, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.
Relationship quality
Caregiver-perceived relationship quality pre-implantation was
measured using the 15-item Mutuality Scale,21 which mea-
sures positive dimensions of relationship quality. Caregivers
respond on a 5-point Likert scale, and scores are averaged to
derive a summary score ranging from 0 to 4, with higher
scores indicating better relationship quality.
Statistical Analysis
Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe patients
and caregivers at baseline. Paired t tests were used to compare
reports of patient QOL and caregiver strain between pre-
implantation and 6 months post-implantation, respectively;
effect sizes were quantified in the metric of Cohen’s d. Given
that previously reported post-LVAD changes in person-oriented
outcomes are not typically linear,22,23 piecewise growth curve
models (in which multiple phases of change can be estimated to
best reflect differing rates of growth over time) were used to
characterize change.24 We modeled 2 separate phases of
change: one for the period from pre-implantation through
1 month post-implantation (during which patients and care-
givers experienced the greatest magnitude in change) and
another for the period from 1 to 6 months post-implantation
(during which patients and caregivers experienced gradual
change). Specifically, this was the 2-piece piecewise growth
curve model, 1a2b parameterization, as described by Chou and
colleagues.24 In this model, random intercept and slope are
modeled for the first phase of change, but the intercept of the
second phase of change is assumed to be a function of the
intercept and slope of the first phase and is, therefore, not
specified in the model. The outcome in the patient model was
HF-specific QOL, using the scores for baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-
month time points (no difference scores were used). The
outcome in the caregiver model was caregiver strain, also using
the scores for all time points (no difference scores). Within each
phase, change was modeled as a linear trajectory. Baseline
values were not included as model covariates.
To facilitate early identification of at-risk patients/care-
givers, only baseline variables were considered in model
selection. Model covariates were selected using the Berg and
Upchurch Developmental-Contextual Model as a guiding
framework.12 Therapy type (DT versus bridge to transplanta-
tion, which also served as a proxy for age in our sample,
because age and therapy type were highly correlated) and

 caregiving relationship type, dichotomized into spousal/
nonspousal, were retained as theoretically important controls.
Although there were multiple types of nonspousal caregiving
dyads in the study (ie, parents, adult children, and neighbors/
friends), we were unable to examine differences across all
relationship types because of sample size considerations.
Additional variables matching the theoretical framework and
with significant individual or global effect on the model were
retained, with a limit of 5 variables (n=50 dyads). We were
particularly interested in patient symptom severity, because
symptoms are known to be correlated with patient QOL25 and
caregiver strain13 in the general HF population. We were also
interested in the effects of relationship quality on these
outcomes, because relationship quality is potentially modifi-
able and has known protective benefits.26 Because both
symptom severity and relationship quality had significant
effects in both models, they were both retained. Sex was also
an important consideration in our selection (either patient or
caregiver sex but not both in the same model, given the high
proportion of heterosexual couples in the sample and the
inclusion of caregiver relationship type as a covariate), but sex
only had a significant individual or global effect in the
caregiver strain model, which was then full (5 variables). To
complete the patient model, we considered readily identifiable
pre-implantation clinical characteristics because of their
potential utility in risk prediction, of which ischemic cause
had a significant effect.
Although patient and caregiver retention was excellent,
with only 1 dyad unavailable for follow-up over 6 months,
8 dyads were removed from the study for death or dissolu-
tion of the caregiving relationship. Specifically, 4 dyads
exited the study because of patient death post-implantation,
and 4 dyads exited the study because the caregiver stepped
away from the caregiver role (1 because of family conflict
over who should be caregiver, 1 because of patient indepen-
dence and preference, and 2 because of self-described
caregiver burnout). Full information maximum likelihood
estimation was used to handle missing data across this
longitudinal study, with all available data used in analyses (all
available data from the 9 dyads who did not complete the
study, plus data [95.7% complete] from the 41 dyads who did
complete the study). Analyses were conducted in Stata14
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) and MPlus7 (Muth�

Muth�
en Los Angeles, CA); the primary author of this article
(J.T.B.) had full access to all the data in the study and takes
responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis.
Results
Characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1.
Patients and caregivers were in their mid-50s on average.
Patients were largely men, caregivers were largely women,
and most identified as white/non-Hispanic. Approximately
three quarters of patients were in the bridge to transplanta-
tion group, and patients were primarily Interagency Registry
for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile ≥3. The
most common caregiving relationship was spousal, followed
by parental; the remaining dyads were adult children (n=2),
neighbors/friends (n=2), or other/did not specify (n=1).
Before implantation, most spousal dyads lived in the same
household, whereas nonspousal dyads were less likely to
cohabitate (v2[1, n=50]=13.2, P<0.001); after implantation,
almost all dyads cohabitated, and there were no differences
by relationship.
Patient HF-Specific QOL
The growth curve for patient HF-specific QOL is presented in
Figure 1. Overall, there was a significant and large improve-
ment in QOL in response to LVAD therapy; the greatest
improvement was between pre-implantation and 1 month
post-implantation (“initial change”), followed by a significant,

 but more gradual, improvement between 1 and 6 months
post-implantation (“subsequent change”). Initial QOL change
was significantly associated with pre-implantation QOL, such
that better pre-implantation QOL predicted less dramatic
improvement in QOL in the first month after implantation
(P<0.001). The model predicting patient QOL is presented in
Table 2. Patients with greater pre-implantation symptoms had
significantly worse pre-implantation QOL but also significantly
greater initial improvements in QOL post-LVAD therapy.
Patients with a nonischemic cause of HF had significantly
greater improvement in QOL from 1 to 6 months post-
implantation. Patients with caregivers who reported better
relationship quality before implantation also had significantly
greater QOL improvement in the first month. Patients with
nonspousal caregivers had significant worsening of QOL from
1 to 6 months post-implantation.
Caregiver Strain
The growth curve for caregiver strain is presented in Figure 2.
Caregivers experienced significant worsening of strain initially
from pre-implantation through 1 month post-implantation,
followed by gradual reduction back to baseline levels between
1 and 6 months post-implantation. However, there was no
significant change in strain when comparing baseline with
6 months post-implantation. There were no significant asso-
ciations between pre-implantation strain and either initial or
subsequent change (P=0.80 and P=0.70, respectively). The
model predicting caregiver strain is presented in Table 3.
Caregivers who reported better pre-implantation relationship
quality, and caregivers who were not the patient’s spouse, had
significantly

strain.

patients with more severe pre-implantation HF symptoms

caregivers

greater reduction in strain from 1 to 6 months post-implan-
tation. Specific sources of strain (ie, average scores for each
subscale at each time point) are presented in Figure 3. The
greatest sources of strain for LVAD caregivers in this sample
were time and social constraints, followed by physical strain.
Discussion
Our study revealed a significant change in patient HF-specific
QOL and caregiver strain in response to LVAD therapy.
Particularly notable aspects of our findings include the nature
of change in patient QOL and caregiver strain and the
significant predictors thereof. We will discuss the impact of
HF symptoms and relationship characteristics (type and
quality) on patient QOL and caregiver strain over time,
because these are the most novel aspects of our findings and
thus expand the current literature.
Change in Patient QOL and Caregiver Strain
In addition to significant overall improvement in patient QOL
over time, we observed large initial improvement (from pre-
implantation to 1 month post-implantation) in patient QOL in
response to LVAD therapy, followed by more gradual
improvement. This finding is consistent with previous LVAD
studies, which have also demonstrated early and sustained
improvement in QOL and functional status.22,23 Thus, factors
predicting robust positive responses to LVAD therapy early
after implantation may be the most promising targets for
intervention and risk prognostication.
In terms of caregiver strain, to our knowledge, this is the
first study to quantify strain in LVAD therapy caregivers from
pre-implantation to post-implantation. Although qualitative
studies have provided evidence that caregiving is emotionally

 distressing at all stages of LVAD therapy support,27,28 it is not
possible to gain insight into how and when caregiver strain
changes in response to LVAD implantation from these studies
or identify when the caregiver is at highest risk. However, in
other contexts involving major clinical intervention (eg, bone
marrow transplantation and heart transplantation), strain is
highest immediately preintervention, followed by reduction
postintervention.29,30 In contrast, we observed no overall
change in strain between preintervention and postintervention
(LVAD). However, when examining trajectory characteristics,
we found significant worsening of strain in the first month
post-implantation, followed by return to baseline. It is possible
that immediate worsening of strain, followed by slow reduc-
tion without net improvement, may be unique to LVAD
caregiving, given that day-to-day life with the device often
brings new physical, psychosocial, and financial challenges for
families.27 The initial increase in strain, although statistically
significant, was not particularly large (ie, moderate effect
size). Thus, characteristics associated with pre-implantation
levels of strain may have particular value in identifying those
at risk for prolonged exposure to elevated strain and its
associated impact on morbidity and mortality.9–11
Influence of HF Symptoms
HF symptoms predicted both patient QOL and caregiver
strain,
demonstrating
that
the
symptom
experience
(a
hallmark of the HF syndrome) affects patients and caregivers
alike. In patients, we observed that greater physical symptom
burden was associated with worse pre-implantation QOL, a
finding consistent with the existing literature.31 Greater
symptoms pre-implantation also predicted greater initial
QOL improvement, potentially because more symptomatic
patients have more to gain from LVAD therapy. In caregivers,
greater

 patients’ symptom burden to be greater than the patients
themselves report,32 and greater severity of HF has been
associated with greater caregiver strain,13 it is possible that
elevated symptom severity pre-implantation has a lagged
effect on caregivers’ ability to cope with caregiving post-
implantation, potentially as a function of sustained hyper-
vigilance.33 In short, the influence of pre-implantation HF
symptoms on both dyad members underlines the importance
of symptoms for patient and caregiver outcomes and
suggests that the experience of HF symptoms is a shared one.
Influence of Caregiver Characteristics
Relationship quality
Relationship quality was protective for both patient QOL and
caregiver strain, with better relationship quality predicting
greater initial improvement in patient QOL and less pre-
implantation caregiver strain. Notably, these were the most
clinically meaningful points in both patient and caregiver
trajectories: (1) any QOL gains the patient made in the first
month were sustained on average, and (2) caregiver strain
increased slightly from baseline, but eventually returned to
pre-implantation levels. More important, relationship quality is
a measurable modifiable factor with established benefit. In
chronic illness in general, relationship quality is associated
with better caregiver emotional health outcomes.26 In HF
dyads, relationship quality is a determinant of better HF
management behaviors34 and is protective against patient
and caregiver psychological distress.35 This is the first study,
to our knowledge, to demonstrate the positive impact of
relationship quality in LVAD therapy. Its known benefits in
similar populations make it a promising factor for future LVAD
research.
Relationship type
Relationship type (spousal/nonspousal) was a determinant of
QOL change for patients and pre-implantation strain for
caregivers. Patients with nonspousal caregivers had signifi-
cant worsening in QOL from 1 to 6 months post-LVAD
therapy, whereas spousal caregivers had greater baseline
strain. It is not surprising that spousal caregivers (many of

QOL and Strain in LVAD Patient-Caregiver Dyads

 whom were working) had significantly higher strain pre-
implantation, because similar results have been demonstrated
in caregivers in other patient populations.36 The finding of
worsening patient QOL in nonspousal dyads, however, is
novel. It may be that physical/emotional proximity of spousal
caregiving holds benefits and drawbacks. For caregivers,
strain pre-implantation may be heightened by the threat of
losing a partner and/or the added burden of caring for
someone who was previously able to contribute to household
responsibilities. For patients, long-term QOL may suffer
because nonspousal caregivers, who were less likely to live
with the patient before implantation but almost exclusively
lived with the patient up through 6 months post-implantation,
may be stretched by the unexpected demands of an extended
caregiving role; thus, they may possibly reduce caregiving
contributions for practical or emotional reasons. In short, our
study demonstrates that the caregiving relationship type
influences LVAD patient and caregiver outcomes. In future
studies, relationship type should be further examined or, at
minimum, controlled.
Implications for Research and Practice
Overall, this study demonstrates the transactional nature (ie,
bidirectional influence) of the LVAD patient-caregiver dyad,
with a combination of individual and caregiver characteristics
predicting key patient and caregiver outcomes. To understand
and leverage the dynamic relationship context in which patients
and caregivers manage LVAD care together, we recommend
research and clinical approaches that examine and treat
patients and caregivers as a dyad. Second, the HF symptom
experience is important for both patient and caregiver
outcomes. Continued symptom research from a dyadic
perspective is needed, particularly given that joint patient-
caregiver symptom management is a critical component of
successful HF self-care.37,38 Third, relationship type (spousal
versus nonspousal) was an important factor in our analysis, and
we recommend that it be examined further in future research,
because different types of dyads may require different types of
support at different points in the pre-implantation/post-
implantation course. Fourth, the greatest sources of strain for
caregivers in this study were time and social constraints,
followed by physical strain. This suggests that strain in LVAD
caregivers may be partly ameliorated by advocating for respite,
home care, or other services that might provide caregivers with
time and support to attend to other obligations, maintain a
healthy social life, practice better self-care, and protect their
own physical health. More important, the trajectory of strain in
this study demonstrates that these services may be necessary
and appropriate not only in the early postoperative period, but
for at least 6 months postoperatively and likely beyond. Finally,
relationship quality was a significant protective factor, and,
given its modifiability, research examining relationship quality
may hold promise for improving the health and well-being of
patients undergoing LVAD therapy and caregivers alike. We
recommend that relationship quality be measured in both
members and studied at the dyadic level. In addition, we
recommend that information across disciplines and illness
contexts be integrated to better understand how to support
healthy relationships throughout the course of HF and LVAD
therapy.
Study Limitations
This study has limitations. First, as one of the earliest forays
into quantitative patient-caregiver research in modern LVAD
therapy, this study was largely exploratory, with no formal
sample size calculations. Although, to our knowledge, this is
the largest quantitative sample of patient-caregiver dyads
receiving continuous-flow devices, it remains relatively small,
precluding us from controlling for all known predictors of
strain or HF-specific QOL and reducing statistical power.
However, we hope that one of the contributions of this study
is that anticipated effect sizes can be calculated from the
models published herein, to assist future researchers in
adequately powering future studies. Second, our choice of
instrument for HF symptoms may be considered a limitation,
because the HFSPS has not previously been used in patients
undergoing LVAD therapy. Although we chose the HFSPS over
the more well-established Minnesota Living With Heart Failure
Questionnaire in an effort to reduce potential conceptual
overlap with the outcome of HF-specific QOL, some degree of
overlap likely still exists; validity work with the HFSPS in this
population may be warranted. Third, although our models
included patient health variables, the physical health of the
caregiver (ie, comorbidities) was not included, largely because
it was not significantly correlated with either outcome.
However, this may be a function of the overall sample
characteristics, in which caregivers were fairly young on
average and comorbid burden was relatively low. On a related
note, this is a single-center study of mostly male patients and
female spousal caregivers who are white. Multisite studies
with diverse samples are needed, in terms of both sociode-
mographic and health characteristics and particularly care-
givers. Although single-center studies are typical for this type
of LVAD research, work like this is increasingly multi-
institutional. Having a single center is a significant limitation
because there are significant programmatic differences in the
patients who are considered for LVAD therapy, the process of
consent, and even the requirements of caregivers. The fact
that three quarters of patients were in the bridge to
transplantation group and 52% were receiving inotropes are
examples: such differences affect generalizability of the
results, given that approximately half of patients undergoing

proportion are likely receiving inotropes at the time of

6-month period after implantation. Because mechanical
circulatory support is typically a long-term therapeutic
strategy, particularly for DT patients, longer-term research
of LVAD dyads is warranted.
Conclusions
We observed significant changes in patient HF-specific QOL
and caregiver strain in response to LVAD implantation, with
the most substantial change occurring in the first month post-
implantation. Patient QOL improved dramatically in the first
month, followed by gradual improvement over the remaining
6 months. For caregivers, strain increased significantly in the
first month post-implantation, followed by gradual reduction
to pre-implantation levels. More important, a combination of
individual and caregiver characteristics predicted patient QOL
and caregiver strain. Worse HF symptoms adversely affected
patients and caregivers alike, whereas better relationship
quality was protective. There were also significant differences
in patient QOL and caregiver strain by relationship type.
Overall, this study demonstrates that the patient-caregiver
relationship has a measurable impact on key patient and
caregiver outcomes after LVAD implantation and that future
dyadic research in this population is warranted.
