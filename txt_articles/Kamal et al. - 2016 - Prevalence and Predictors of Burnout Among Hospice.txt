Abstract
Context—Many clinical disciplines report high rates of burnout, which lead to low quality of 
care. Palliative care clinicians routinely manage patients with significant suffering, aiming to 
improve quality of life. As a major role of palliative care clinicians involves educating patients and 
caregivers regarding identifying priorities and balancing stress, we wondered how clinician self-
management of burnout matches against the emotionally exhaustive nature of the work.
Objectives—We sought to understand the prevalence and predictors of burnout using a 
discipline-wide survey.
Methods—We asked American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine clinician members 
to complete an electronic survey querying demographic factors, job responsibilities, and the 
Maslach Burnout Inventory. We performed univariate and multivariate regression analyses to 
identify predictors of high rates of burnout.
Results—We received 1357 responses (response rate 30%). Overall, we observed a burnout rate 
of 62%, with higher rates reported by nonphysician clinicians. Most burnout stemmed from 
emotional exhaustion, with depersonalization comprising a minor portion. Factors associated with 
higher rates of burnout include working in smaller organizations, working longer hours, being 
younger than 50 years, and working weekends. We did not observe different rates between 
palliative care clinicians and hospice clinicians. Higher rated self-management activities to 
mitigate burnout include participating in interpersonal relationships and taking vacations.

Introduction
Many clinicians practice palliative care to create a meaningful difference in the lives of 
persons with serious illness and their caregivers. Along with the sense of fulfillment 
garnered by improving the quality of life of those with need is a simultaneous awareness that 
clinical hospice and palliative care practice may be more inherently stressful and challenging 
than previously appreciated. Challenges, such as managing a clinical program that is in high 
demand but under-staffed,1,2 addressing the multiple and complex needs of patients and 
caregivers often in crisis, and facilitating resolution of conflicts between any combination of 
patients, caregivers, and the health system, may lead to significant stress.
Contrastingly, a high degree of meaning and personal satisfaction felt by palliative care 
clinicians may obviate this job-related stress, not allowing it to evolve into a more 
distressing state such as feelings of burnout. Potentially, the naturally rewarding work of 
palliative care clinicians, alongside the natural selection of those who comprise the field 
(i.e., those who stay in the field must inherently know how to resolve the emotional 
challenges), may prevent escalation of normal stress to something more. We do know that in 
other medical fields, job stress does frequently evolve into overt burnout, which is described 
as loss of enthusiasm for work (emotional exhaustion [EE]), feelings of cynicism 
(depersonalization [DP]), and a low sense of personal accomplishment.3 This phenomenon 
is increasingly studied in health care, both to describe the penetration of this issue across all 
fields of medicine, while also informing interventions to allay the downstream, negative 
consequences of unmanaged burnout.4
Shanafelt et al. recently described the comparative results of burnout in various physician 
populations.5 In addition to reporting an overall rate of 46% of all physicians, they noted the 
highest rates in physicians who must address multiple areas of medical need simultaneously 
(e.g., family medicine, internal medicine) or those that are asked to focus on a specific 
condition but often in high-acuity situations (e.g., emergency medicine, obstetrics). 
Furthermore, others have described higher rates of burnout among critical care physicians,6 
where high-acuity situations are the norm, and outcomes not always successful.
Palliative care shares many characteristics with these other medical disciplines that 
experience high rates of burnout, including balancing distress across multiple diseases or 
domains, while frequently being called to high-acuity or rapidly evolving situations. 
Previous evaluations of burnout in palliative care have either described burnout in qualitative 
ways or using small samples sizes7,8 or were conducted in a different era of clinical 
palliative care.9,10 To complement these efforts, we planned a large, nationwide survey to

 evaluate the prevalence, severity, and predictors of burnout in clinical palliative care 
professionals.
In partnership with the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM), 
one of the largest palliative care membership organizations in the U.S., we conducted a 
membership-wide survey to understand the prevalence and correlates of burnout among 
clinicians. The purpose of this research was to ultimately inform the development of future 
interventions to reduce the burnout experienced by the dedicated palliative care 
professionals who care for at least six million persons and their caregivers every year.11
Methods
We conducted an electronic survey of demographics and burnout among specialty hospice 
and palliative care clinicians in the U.S. Participation was voluntary, and no remuneration 
was offered. The study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Duke University 
institutional review board (Pro00045381). The survey concept was approved by the AAHPM 
Board of Directors, but members did not have influence over the content of the survey itself.
Participants
We invited all members of the AAHPM with available electronic mail addresses to 
participate in the survey (N = 4456). Nonclinician respondents were excluded from the 
analysis. AAHPM provided a roster of member e-mail addresses who were active members 
as of June 1, 2013.
Survey Procedures
The electronic survey was conducted over six months using an initial electronic invitation 
letter and two follow-up letters. Additionally, invitations via Facebook posts, Twitter 
messages, blog posts, and electronic newsletters were sent throughout the survey period. 
Other participating social media outlets used to disseminate invitations to the study included 
the Palliative Care Network, National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, PalliMed, 
GeriPal, and the Society of General Internal Medicine End-of-Life Interest Group.
Survey Development and Validation
Our palliative care–focused burnout survey was modeled after similar surveys conducted by 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American College of Surgeons.12,13 The 
survey included 52 questions. Eight questions involved clinician demographics or practice 
setting, four involved career choice and work/life balance, three questions from the SF-1214 
queried quality of life, nine addressed clinical experience and credentials, five involved job 
characteristics, and one queried self-care. To measure burnout, we used the Maslach Burnout 
Inventory Human Services Survey3 (license/permission was obtained from Mind Garden, 
Inc., Menlo Park, CA). This 22-question survey (MBI-22) has been used frequently in other 
studies examining burnout in health care workers, including physicians and nurses.
The MBI-22 uses a seven-point Likert scale to score the frequency of feeling each of 22 
components used to measure burnout. Thus, for each of the 22 questions, a score of 0

 through 7 is recorded. For example, one question within the MBI-22 Human Services 
Survey is, “I feel emotionally drained from my work.” Respondents can answer a frequency 
of feeling this way, from “never” (scored as 0) to “every day” (scored as 7). Thus, the 
minimum score possible is 0 and the maximum is 154. Our survey did not explain the 
scoring system within the text of the questions.
To assess for each subdomain of burnout (e.g., depersonalization and emotional exhaustion), 
we used the scoring and cutoff criteria of the MBI-22. To calculate a score, each domain had 
a selected set of questions on which to focus; additive scores from these questions 
represented a total subdomain score. Depersonalization was scored as “high” for a total 
score of 13 or higher across five questions; seven or higher constituted “moderate.” 
Emotional exhaustion was scores as “high” for a total score of 27 or higher across nine 
questions; 17 or higher constituted “moderate.”
The electronic survey was twice reviewed for face and content validity by six palliative care 
physicians, one expert in health care–associated burnout, and one data analyst. After the first 
review, iterative updates were made to reflect suggested changes and improvements.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to investigate the demographics, job characteristics, and 
burnout symptoms of palliative care clinicians. We investigated the pattern of data 
missingness and found that it was random and not informative. We imputed missing 
responses from the MBI-22 questionnaire for those who left more than 33% of the MBI-22 
questionnaire blank, or participants who had less than 10 answered responses (note that the 
EE and DP subscales used 14 of the 22 MBI-22 questions) were removed from the analyses.
We modeled burnout by dichotomizing our outcome variable to high EE or DP. We used 
Spearman correlation to check for correlation between high EE or DP, EE, DP, and the 
MBI-22 scales.
We implemented a multivariable logistic regression model to predict risk of burnout (high 
DP or EE). We used variables from the literature and those hypothesized to ameliorate 
burnout including marital status, children living at home, numbers of colleagues in practice 
(three or less vs. four or more), physicians versus nonphysicians, and hours per week worked 
(>50 hours vs. <50 hours), age (<50 vs. >50 years). For the purposes of this analysis, we use 
the term “non-physician clinicians” to designate non-MD/DO clinicians such as registered 
nurses, advanced practice professionals, social workers, chaplains, and the like.
To identify a concise set of variables for modeling variables associated with burnout, we 
used a bootstrap multivariable stepwise logistic regression technique to select and validate 
the significant variables. We accounted for random sampling and multiple testing by creating 
1000 new random samples (based on our original data set), then selected the variables that 
most frequently were selected to be significant across the 1000 bootstrapped samples. All 
analyses were performed using either R version 2.15.1 (graphics) or SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

 Results
We received surveys from 1357 specialty hospice and palliative care clinicians, yielding a 
response rate of 30%. After imputation, we had 1056 complete MBI questionnaires.
Demographics
Demographic characteristics of responding clinicians are summarized in Table 1. A majority 
of the respondents were over age 50 (57%), female (65%), married or partnered (82%), did 
not have children at home (55%), and were physicians (68%). We found that most clinicians 
worked in palliative care for less than 10 years (67%), planned to stay for at least 10 or more 
years (53%), dedicated more than 75% of their weekly effort toward clinical responsibilities 
(42%), and worked exclusively in clinical palliative care (31%). We investigated job 
characteristics for clinicians and found that a majority worked over 40 hours per week (59%) 
and had at least four colleagues (57%).
Burnout Prevalence and Severity
The characteristics of responding clinicians’ burnout prevalence, career satisfaction, and 
feelings about work environment are summarized in Table 2. We found that 60% of 
palliative care clinicians had high EE, and 24% had high DP. We found that 62% of 
clinicians experienced at least one symptom of burnout based on reporting high EE or high 
DP. When comparing among clinician types, we found that the burnout rate (either having 
high EE or high DP) was significantly higher in nonphysician clinicians (66% vs. 60%; P < 
0.001).
Regarding work-life balance, less than half of the clinicians reported that their work 
schedule left them enough time for personal and family life (42%). At work, 33% of the 
clinicians reported being calm and peaceful most of the time, 30% reported they had a lot of 
energy most of the time, and 4% experienced being downhearted and blue most of the time.
Finally, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to see the relationship 
between burnout and the associated variables found during the bootstrap stepwise variable 
selection method (Table 3). We found that younger nonphysicians who worked more than 50 
hours per week, worked with fewer colleagues, and worked weekends often were at the 
greatest risk for burnout.
Personal Management of Burnout
We queried the types of management strategies reported by clinicians and the importance of 
each. Strategies rated the most important were as follows: “talking with family, friends, or 
significant others for support,” “participating in recreation/hobbies/exercise,” and “taking 
vacations.” All three were considered “essential” by at least 50% of all respondents. Reading 
and “nurturing spiritual/religious aspects of myself” also were rated highly. Journaling and 
reflective writing alongside regular meetings with counselors or therapists were reported as 
the least used and least important among the options provided.

 Comparative Analysis
We compared the respondents of our survey to the AAHPM member roster from October 
2013. We compared two overlapping demographic variables between the two years in 
palliative care practice and age. AAHPM data on years in practice were incomplete, with 
data only available on 1821 of 4608 members (40%). Regarding years in practice, data were 
28% complete (1306/4608). Compared to the available AAHPM data, the survey population 
was significantly different, with more survey respondents having practiced 0–5 or 6–10 
years versus the AAHPM roster (P < 0.01). Furthermore, we observed significant differences 
in ages, with more survey respondents being over the age of 51 years than would be 
expected by the AAHPM roster (P < 0.01).
Discussion
Palliative care clinicians report a burnout rate of 62%. This is one of the highest published 
rates reported when compared to national samples of physicians from other specialties.5 
Burnout is more likely reported by clinicians who are younger, not physicians, those who 
work with fewer colleagues, work longer hours, and work on weekends.
These results highlight some important conclusions for the field. First, we observe a clear 
relationship between clinician age (and not experience) and risk for experiencing burnout. 
This may be caused by several reasons, including selection bias of those who remain in 
clinical medicine past their junior years (those who experience significant burnout have 
already left) or a commonly reported phenomenon of higher stress and lower job satisfaction 
among clinicians15 and professionals in the early stages of a career.16 Second, our results 
demonstrate different rates of burnout among clinician types. The combined group of 
advanced practice professionals, nurses, social workers, and chaplains reported higher rates 
of burnout than their physician colleagues, even when accounting for differences in age and 
gender among the groups. Third, of the factors associated with higher rates of burnout, some 
are clinician-related and thus not modifiable by the organizations in which they work, but 
some potentially are under the control of palliative care organizations. For example, local 
palliative care organization management can carefully and strategically manage the number 
of hours worked per week and after-hours responsibilities of each of its clinicians. This is 
balanced with the progressively increasing workload of clinical groups, who have to balance 
asking for clinical business from referring colleagues with providing available services when 
those requests are made.
Our results also emphasize the need for local and discipline-wide strategies to manage 
clinician burnout. Interventions developed, piloted, and implemented within our discipline 
are few but evolving. Recent data from semistructured interviews of palliative care clinicians 
reported system, patient, and personal factors and challenges related to work stressors. 
Furthermore, this study demonstrated that palliative care clinicians are interested in further 
training to manage burnout, including mind-body skills, education, and cognitive strategies.8 
Colleagues also have reported self-management strategies important to palliative care 
clinicians to address burnout, including focusing on physical well-being, personal 
boundaries, taking time away, focusing on professional relationships, and taking a 
transcendental perspective.7 Additionally, we must explore resilience strategies that have

 worked in other disciplines, paying particular attention to factors unique to our field such as 
size and training background, including career fit/meaning, personal strategies, physician 
engagement groups, structural changes in practice, and others.17–19
Ultimately, prevention and management of clinician burnout will help our discipline provide 
sustainable, responsive, and available palliative care for all patients across the serious illness 
continuum, and in all geographic locations of care. Fulfilling this promise is critical, as the 
number of patients eligible for services is growing at a historic pace. Current projections 
estimate the number of persons diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. growing by 45% during 
the next 20 years.20 For those with chronic illness, estimates put growth at an additional 20 
million persons between 2015 and 2030, totaling the prevalence of those living with chronic 
illness to around 170 million Americans.21 When matching these findings with the sobering 
data from the current palliative care clinician workforce shortage,1 we are faced with a 
looming crisis. Solutions to address this crisis must simultaneously focus on supporting the 
current clinicians in the field through management of burnout and job stress, building the 
skills of our primary palliative care partners,22 and exploring alternate strategies to introduce 
new clinicians to the specialty.
Regarding future directions, there are several follow-up investigations related to the 
relationship between job responsibilities, job stress, and mismatched regulatory and 
reimbursement policies that are needed. No doubt, the landscape of health care delivery has 
changed significantly, with increasing demands placed on clinicians related to medical 
documentation, reporting data on quality, and omnipresent threats to clinician 
reimbursement. Whether these challenges faced by our colleagues in other fields is similar to 
our own, and thus shared drivers of burnout, is unknown. In many ways, palliative care is 
similar to other fields. We draw from the same clinician workforce pool, are subject to the 
changes inherent to reimbursement reform, and are increasingly in demand as the population 
with chronic and serious illness grows. But from a policy perspective, we are also unique. 
For example, we are champions of multidisciplinary care, yet often have several team 
members who provide care “in kind,” mismatching care provided with the necessary 
reimbursement to support validation and sustainability of those services. We also focus on 
the needs of caregivers, yet suffer from a lack of policies and reimbursement that explicitly 
support this mission. Burnout is a global challenge across all of health care, which highlights 
likely systems issues that require policy-level changes. Which of these issues should be the 
focus of our advocacy efforts needs to be defined.
This study has several limitations. First is the low response rate. We used a crowdsourcing 
technique to maximize the number of palliative care clinicians who had access to the survey, 
as has been described by others.23 Implications of the low response rate on the findings 
relate to the nonresponse bias. We could imagine that the 70% of the field who were 
nonresponders may not experience burnout and thus had little motivation to participate. If 
true, the true burnout prevalence rate for the entire field may be lower than our findings. 
Additionally, we are limited by our inability to determine causality or direction of effect for 
the associations observed. Furthermore, we did find that our respondents differed 
significantly from the AAHPM membership roster, limiting the generalizability of the 
findings to the entire membership. Furthermore, our nonphysician sample size was small, 
Kamal et al.

 limiting our ability to definitely characterize this population. Despite these challenges, our 
study stands as one of the largest U.S.-based research surveys of palliative care clinicians. 
The survey respondents and the conclusions drawn from the data largely focus on the 
experience and characteristics of physician clinicians in palliative care. Despite the 
discrepancy in the sample sizes of respondents, we were able to identify important 
differences in burnout rates between the clinical groups.
Conclusions
Burnout is a common and pervasive phenomenon. The high prevalence highlights an urgent 
need for strategies to mitigate its effects and sustain the work-force. Such solutions would 
address modifiable organization-level characteristics associated with higher burnout, such as 
team size and hours worked. Furthermore, they would build and practice resilience skills, 
instead of focusing on “being tougher.” We must reach a delicate balance between calls for 
expanding the role of palliative care within serious illness care and ensuring a workforce that 
does not overpromise and underdeliver responsive palliative care.

EE = emotional exhaustion; DP = depersonalization.
aAs assessed using the full Maslach Burnout Inventory. Per standard scoring of the Maslach Burnout Inventory for health care workers, clinicians 
with scores on the emotional exhaustion subscale of at least 27, scores on the depersonalization subscale of at least 13 are considered to have a high 
degree of burnout in that dimension.
bHigh EE or High DP is related to having a high risk of burnout (see Methods).
