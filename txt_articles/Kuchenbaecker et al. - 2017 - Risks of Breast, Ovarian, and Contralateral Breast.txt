Key Points 
141 
Question: What are the breast and ovarian cancer risks for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
142 
carriers and are they related to family history of cancer and mutation position? 
143 
Findings: In a prospective cohort of 9,856 mutation carriers, mainly ascertained through 
144 
cancer genetic clinics, the cumulative breast cancer risk to age 80 years was 72% for 
145 
BRCA1 and 69% for BRCA2 carriers. The cumulative ovarian cancer risk to age 80 was 44% 
146 
for BRCA1 and 17% for BRCA2 carriers. Cancer risks differed by cancer family history and 
147 
mutation position.  
148 
Meaning: These findings provide cancer risk patterns based on BRCA status using 
149 
prospective data. Family history and mutation position are important additional variables in 
150 
risk assessment.

Abstract 
152 
Importance: The clinical management of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers requires 
153 
accurate, prospective cancer risk estimates.  
154 
Objectives: To estimate age-specific risks of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and 
155 
contralateral breast cancer for mutation carriers and to evaluate risk modification by family 
156 
cancer history and mutation location. 
157 
Design and setting: Prospective cohort study of BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers 
158 
recruited from 1997-2011 through the International BRCA1/2 Carrier Cohort Study, the 
159 
Breast Cancer Family Registry and the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for 
160 
Research into Familial Breast Cancer, with ascertainment through family clinics (94%) and 
161 
population-based studies (6%).  The majority were from large national studies in the UK 
162 
(EMBRACE), the Netherlands (HEBON) and France (GENEPSO). The follow-up ended 
163 
December 2013. 
164 
Participants: 6,036 BRCA1 and 3,820 BRCA2 mutation carriers at baseline (5,046 
165 
unaffected, 4,810 with breast or ovarian cancer  or both at baseline; median follow-up: 5 
166 
years). 
167 
Exposures: BRCA1/2 mutations, family cancer history, mutation location.  
168 
Main Outcomes and Measures: Annual incidences, standardized incidence ratios, and 
169 
cumulative risks of breast, ovarian and contralateral breast cancer.  
170 
Results: Among 3,886 women (median age 38, IQR 30-46) eligible for the breast cancer 
171 
analysis, 5,066 women (median age 38, IQR 31-47) eligible for the ovarian cancer analysis, 
172 
and 2,213 women (median age 47, IQR 40-55) eligible for the contralateral breast cancer 
173 
analysis, 426 were diagnosed with breast cancer, 109 with ovarian cancer, and 245 with 
174 
contralateral breast cancer, respectively, during follow-up. The cumulative breast cancer risk 
175 
to age 80 years was 72% (95%CI:65-79%) for BRCA1 and 69% (95%CI:61-77%) for BRCA2 
176 
  
9 
carriers. The breast cancer incidences increased rapidly in early adulthood, until ages 30-40 
177 
for BRCA1 and until ages 40-50 for BRCA2 carriers, then remained at a similar, constant 
178 
incidence (20-30 per 1,000 person-years) until age 80.  The cumulative ovarian cancer risk 
179 
to age 80 years was 44% (95%CI:36-53%) for BRCA1 and 17% (95%CI:11-25%) for BRCA2 
180 
carriers. For contralateral breast cancer, the cumulative risk 20 years after breast cancer 
181 
diagnosis was 40% (95%CI:35-45%) for BRCA1 and 26% (95%CI:20-33%) for BRCA2 
182 
carriers (Hazard Ratio (HR) for comparing BRCA2 vs BRCA1 0.62, 95%CI:0.47-0.82, P-
183 
diff=0.001). Breast cancer risk increased with increasing number of first- and second-degree 
184 
relatives diagnosed with breast cancer for both BRCA1 (P-trend<0.001, HR for ≥2 vs no 
185 
affected relatives 1.99(95%CI:1.41-2.82)) and BRCA2 carriers (P-trend=0.02, HR=1.91 
186 
(95%CI:1.08-3.37)).  Breast cancer risk was higher if mutations were located outside vs 
187 
within the regions bounded by positions c.2282-c.4071 in BRCA1 (HR=1.46 (95%CI:1.11-
188 
1.93), p=0.007) and c.2831-c.6401 in BRCA2 (HR=1.93 (95%CI:1.36-2.74), p<0.001). 
189 
Conclusions and Relevance: These findings provide patterns of cancer risk based on 
190 
BRCA status using prospective data collection, and demonstrate the potential importance of 
191 
family history and mutation location in risk assessment.

Introduction 
196 
The optimal clinical management of women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations depends on 
197 
accurate age-specific cancer risk estimates. These can be used to estimate the absolute 
198 
risk-reduction from preventive strategies and to inform decisions about the age to commence 
199 
cancer screening1.  
200 
 
201 
Based on retrospective studies2-11 the cumulative breast cancer risk estimates to age 70 
202 
years range from 40 to 87% for BRCA1 and 27 to 84% for BRCA2 carriers. The 
203 
corresponding ovarian cancer risks vary from 16 to 68% for BRCA1 and 11 to 30% for 
204 
BRCA2 carriers. In these studies, risk estimates have wide confidence intervals. Differences 
205 
in sampling (population-based/high-risk families), population- and mutation-characteristics, 
206 
analytic methods, and other genetic- and lifestyle/hormonal-factors, are possible 
207 
explanations for the variation in risk estimates12. 
208 
 
209 
Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are rare in the population, most retrospective 
210 
penetrance estimates have been derived from family-based studies. Typically, mutation 
211 
screening has been of affected women, selected on the basis of young age at diagnosis, or 
212 
cancer family history. Cancer risks are then estimated using the known or inferred genotypes 
213 
of the relatives. Estimates from such retrospective, family-based studies are prone to bias if 
214 
analyses are not correctly adjusted for the ascertainment process, or if there are 
215 
inaccuracies in family history.  
216 
 
217 
Prospective cohort studies, in which mutation carriers are recruited on the basis of their 
218 
mutation status and followed over time, may avoid these issues. Since the precision of risk 
219 
estimates depends on the number of prospective-incident cancers, a very large sample with 
220 
  
11 
long follow-up is required. Prospective penetrance estimates have been based on small 
221 
samples (<64 breast, 31 ovarian cancers) and are imprecise13-15. The purpose of this study 
222 
was to estimate age-specific risks of breast, ovarian, and contralateral breast cancer using 
223 
data from a large prospective cohort.  
224 
 
225 
Methods 
226 
 
227 
Participants 
228 
We used prospective cohort data on carriers of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
229 
carriers recruited through three consortia, the International BRCA1/2 Carrier Cohort Study 
230 
(IBCCS), the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR), and the Kathleen Cuningham 
231 
Foundation Consortium for Research Into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab, details in 
232 
Supplementary Material).  All centres in these consortia obtained written informed consent 
233 
from study participants and local ethical review committees approved protocols.  
234 
 
235 
Briefly, for IBCCS, data were available from 7666 female carriers recruited between 1997 
236 
and 2011 from 18 European cancer genetics centres and Quebec province, Canada. The 
237 
majority were from large national studies in the UK, the Netherlands and France. All centres 
238 
conducted active follow-up through follow-up questionnaires. In addition to the active follow-
239 
up in all studies, passive follow-up through linkage with cancer, pathology and death 
240 
registries was obtained in countries where this is available (cancer/death registries in 
241 
Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK; pathology registries to collect information 
242 
on preventive surgeries in Denmark and The Netherlands) together with medical record 
243 
validation of self-reported cancer diagnoses and preventive surgeries.  
244 
  
12 
BCFR is a family cohort that includes data on 1,570 mutation carriers recruited from six sites 
245 
in Australia, Canada, and the U.S.A.. Families were followed up regularly, through annual 
246 
approaches to probands and 5-year systematic follow-up of families collecting 
247 
epidemiological and demographic data from all participants.  
248 
kConFab included 620 mutation carriers from multiple-case families ascertained through 
249 
family cancer clinics in Australia and New Zealand since 1997. Participants were 
250 
systematically followed-up using a mailed follow-up questionnaire administered every 3 
251 
years.  
252 
 
253 
The end of follow-up was December 2013. 
254 
 
255 
Eligibility and censoring 
256 
For each of the three analyses (breast cancer risk, contralateral breast cancer risk and 
257 
ovarian cancer risk) we defined a different group eligible at baseline (Figure 1). Baseline was 
258 
defined to be the age at study recruitment or age at the genetic test, whichever was last.  
259 
 
260 
Breast cancer risk 
261 
Women were included in the estimation of first breast cancer risk if, at completion of the 
262 
baseline questionnaire, they had not been diagnosed with any cancer (excluding non-
263 
melanoma skin cancer) nor undergone risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (with mastectomy: 
264 
n=304 BRCA1; n=148 BRCA2, Supplementary Methods). Women were followed from 
265 
baseline until the first of: attained age 80 years; death; completion of last follow-up 
266 
questionnaire, or last record linkage (if conducted), whichever came last; risk reducing 
267 
bilateral mastectomy; or diagnosis of any first cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). 
268 
Women diagnosed with breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive (DCIS)) during follow-up 
269 
were considered as affected.  Since information on cancers was partly self-reported, tumor 
270 
phenotype specific data were not available other than invasiveness. Therefore, all types of 
271 
  
13 
breast cancer were included in the analysis. Additional analyses were performed in which: (i) 
272 
affected women were considered to be only those diagnosed with invasive disease; and (ii) 
273 
women were censored at the age of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (Supplementary 
274 
Methods).  
275 
 
276 
Ovarian cancer risk 
277 
Women were included in the ovarian cancer analysis if at baseline they had not been 
278 
diagnosed with ovarian cancer nor undergone risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (with 
279 
oophorectomy: n=1,808 BRCA1; and n=969 BRCA2). Women with a history of breast or 
280 
non-melanoma skin cancer were included in the analysis but women with other cancers 
281 
were not. Women were followed from baseline until the first of: attained age 80 years; death; 
282 
completion of last follow-up questionnaire or last record linkage (whichever came last); risk-
283 
reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (or salpingectomy or removal of ovaries for other reasons); 
284 
any cancer diagnosis (excluding breast and non-melanoma skin cancer). Only women 
285 
diagnosed with invasive ovarian (or fallopian tube or peritoneal) cancer during follow-up 
286 
were considered affected. 
287 
 
288 
Contralateral breast cancer risk 
289 
Women were included in the contralateral breast cancer analysis if they were diagnosed with 
290 
a first breast cancer before the date of their last follow-up questionnaire (or record linkage) 
291 
and had not been diagnosed with any other cancer (including contralateral breast cancer) 
292 
nor undergone risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy before study entry.  Only asynchronous 
293 
contralateral breast cancer was considered, for which there had to be an interval of at least 
294 
one year between first and second breast cancers. Eligible women entered follow-up at their 
295 
baseline questionnaire date or one year after their first breast cancer diagnosis date 
296 
(whichever later) and were followed until the first of: age 80 years; death; date at last follow-
297 
up; risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy or any cancer.  Women diagnosed with asynchronous 
298 
contralateral breast cancer during follow-up were assumed to be affected.  
299

300 
Statistical Analysis 
301 
Annual incidences of breast, ovarian and contralateral breast cancer per 1,000 person-years 
302 
(PY) were estimated for 10-year age intervals using standard cohort analysis.  Kaplan-Meier 
303 
(KM) analysis was used to estimate cumulative risks. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) 
304 
for breast and ovarian cancer, relative to population specific incidences, were also estimated 
305 
(Supplementary Material).  
306 
 
307 
We used Cox-regression to compare cancer risks for BRCA1 mutation carriers with risks for 
308 
BRCA2 carriers over all age groups and by attained age. To test for heterogeneity by 
309 
country, we carried out Cox-regression based on a chi-square (n-1) degree of freedom test, 
310 
where n=6, is the number of countries, on the estimated hazard ratios for each country 
311 
compared to the baseline country (UK). The contralateral breast cancer analysis was 
312 
stratified by age at first breast cancer (before 40, between 40 and 49, 50 or older) and Cox-
313 
regression was used to compare risks between age-groups. We evaluated cancer risks by 
314 
extent of self-reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer separately (Supplementary 
315 
Methods). Women were classified by the number of cancers in first- or second-degree 
316 
relatives (none, one, two or more). Separate categories for women with cancers of unknown 
317 
type among relatives, and for those with unknown family history (“missing”) were defined and 
318 
separate hazard ratios were estimated for these categories. A test for trend was performed 
319 
using Cox-regression by including a continuous variable in the model representing the 
320 
number of breast or ovarian cancers in female first- or second- degree relatives (taking 
321 
values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc). Separate variables were derived for the number of breast and number 
322 
of ovarian cancers in relatives. We also evaluated differences in breast and ovarian cancer 
323 
by mutation position (based on base-pair location) using Cox regression. Mutations were 
324 
grouped into regions based on differences in breast and ovarian cancer risks previously 
325 
reported in retrospective studies16-18. Mutations in BRCA1 were grouped into 3 regions (5’ to 
326 
  
15 
c.2281; c.2282 to c.4071; c.4072 to 3’). For BRCA2, mutations were grouped in 3 regions 
327 
using both the narrow and wide definitions of the “Ovarian Cancer Cluster Region” 16 (wide: 
328 
5’ to c.2830, c.2831 to c.6401, c.6402 to 3’; narrow: 5’ to c.3846, c.3847 to c.6275, c.6276 to 
329 
3’, Supplementary Methods). For all analyses a robust variance approach, which clustered 
330 
observations on family membership was used to adjust standard errors for the fact that the 
331 
cohort included multiple women from the same family19. Analyses were stratified by country 
332 
(categories: UK, France, Netherlands, Australia, USA, other) and birth cohort (groups: before 
333 
1940, 1940-1949, 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979, 1980 or later). Proportionality was 
334 
evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals which was met for all analyses. Analyses were carried 
335 
out in Stata(v.13). Statistical tests were considered significant based on 2-sided hypothesis 
336 
tests with P < .05.

Results 
340 
A total of 9,856 patients, including 6,036 BRCA1 and 3,820 BRCA2 mutation carriers were 
341 
available at baseline. The majority of women were ascertained through family clinics (94%) 
342 
and the remainder (6%) were recruited from studies that used population-based 
343 
ascertainment.  Figure 1 and eTable1 summarize the baseline cohort study sample 
344 
(N=9,856) and the assembly of the eligible prospective cohorts for each analysis. Table 1 
345 
summarizes the characteristics of the eligible women included in the prospective analyses. 
346 
Information on follow-up completeness is summarized in eTable2. All studies conducted 
347 
active follow-up with follow-up questionnaires, but the mean interval between questionnaires 
348 
varied across studies (1.6 to 8.7 years, eTable2). In addition, in countries with registry 
349 
information, active follow-up was complemented with passive follow-up through record 
350 
linkage. On average, 7% of women in the cohort were lost to follow-up but this varied among 
351 
studies (0 to 13%, eTable 2).  
352 
 
353 
  
16 
The breast cancer analysis was based on 3,886 eligible BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
354 
carriers (median age at study entry: 38 (interquartile range (IQR):30-46))  The ovarian 
355 
cancer analysis was based on data from 5,066 women (median age at study entry: 38 
356 
(IQR=31-47)) and the contralateral breast cancer analysis was based on 2213 women 
357 
(median age at start of follow-up: 47 (IQR=40-55)). During follow-up, among the eligible 
358 
women, 426 were diagnosed with breast cancer (483 censored for risk-reducing bilateral 
359 
mastectomy), 109 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer (1508 censored for risk-reducing 
360 
salpingo-oophorectomy) and 245 were diagnosed with asynchronous contralateral breast 
361 
cancer. The age-specific cancer incidences, SIRs and cumulative risks are shown in Table 
362 
2.  
363 
 
364 
Breast cancer risks 
365 
For BRCA1 carriers, the breast cancer incidences per decade of age increased from 21-30 
366 
to 31-40 years of age, but then remained at 23.5-28.3 per 1000 person-years for ages 31-70 
367 
(P-trend=0.97). The peak incidence occurred in the 41-50 age group (28.3 per 1000 person-
368 
years, 95% confidence interval (CI):23.1-34.7). A similar pattern was seen for BRCA2 
369 
carriers, with  peak incidence  in the 51-60 age-group (30.6 per 1000 person-years, 
370 
95%CI:22.8-41.1) and incidence of 21.9-30.6 per 1000 person-years across ages 41-80 (P-
371 
trend=0.57). The estimated SIRs decreased with increasing age in both BRCA1 (P-
372 
trend<.001) and BRCA2 carriers (P-trend<.001). The cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 
373 
80 was 72% (95%CI:65-79%) for BRCA1 and 69% (95%CI:61-77%) for BRCA2 carriers 
374 
(Figure 2). While the cumulative risks for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers to age 80 years were 
375 
similar, the cumulative risks to age 50 were higher for BRCA1 carriers (P=0.03). 
376 
The cumulative risk estimates for breast cancer by age 80 years when censoring at risk-
377 
reducing salpingo-oophorectomy were 70% (95%CI:60-80%) for BRCA1 and 75% 
378 
(95%CI:67-83%) for BRCA2 carriers (Supplement, eTable 3, eFigure 1). From an analysis 
379 
that excluded the known in-situ breast cancers, the corresponding risk-estimates were 68% 
380 
  
17 
(95%CI:60-76%) for BRCA1 and 63% (95%CI:54-72%) for BRCA2 carriers (Supplement, 
381 
eTable 4). 
382 
There were  no significant differences in the estimated breast cancer incidences by country 
383 
for either BRCA1 (P-heterogeneity=0.32) or BRCA2 carriers (P-heterogeneity=0.43, 
384 
Supplement, eTable 5, eFigure 2). The estimated breast cancer risks were similar when 
385 
analyses were carried out separately for women identified through family clinics and women 
386 
who were relatives of mutation carriers identified through population-wide screening of 
387 
breast cancer cases (eTable6).  
388 
 
389 
Ovarian cancer risks 
390 
There was an increase in ovarian cancer incidence with age up to 61-70 years for both 
391 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. The incidences were higher for BRCA1 carriers (HR comparing 
392 
BRCA1 versus BRCA2 = 3.6, 95%CI:2.2-5.9 P<.001). The SIRs did not vary with age for 
393 
either gene (overall SIR 49.6 (95%CI:40.0-61.5), P-trend=0.86 for BRCA1; 13.7 (95%CI:9.1-
394 
20.7) P-trend=0.23 for BRCA2). The ovarian cancer cumulative risk to age 80 years was 
395 
44% (95%CI: 36-53%) for BRCA1 and 17% for BRCA2 carriers (95%CI:11-25%) (Table 2, 
396 
Figure 2). 
397 
 
398 
Contralateral breast cancer risks 
399 
The estimated incidence of contralateral breast cancer for BRCA1 carriers varied between 
400 
23 to 28 per 1000 person-years for the period up to 20 years after the first breast cancer 
401 
diagnosis (Table 3; Supplement eTable 7). The cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer 
402 
at 20 years after the first breast cancer diagnosis was 40% (95%CI:35-45%). The HR for 
403 
contralateral breast cancer declined with increasing age of the first breast (HR for women 
404 
  
18 
diagnosed with the first breast cancer in ages 40-50 and >50 years was 0.81 (95%CI:0.58-
405 
1.12) and 0.71 (95%CI:0.45-1.11) respectively, relative to women diagnosed under age 40).  
406 
 
407 
For BRCA2 carriers, the estimated contralateral breast cancer incidence varied between 13 
408 
to 18 per 1000 person years during the years after the first breast cancer diagnosis. The 
409 
cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer at 20 years after the first breast cancer 
410 
diagnosis was 26% (95%CI:20-33%), and was lower than for BRCA1 carriers (HR 
411 
comparing BRCA2 vs BRCA1 = 0.62, 95%CI: 0.47-0.82, P=0.001). The HR for contralateral 
412 
breast cancer when first breast cancer diagnosis was when aged 40-50 was 0.73 (95%CI: 
413 
0.41-1.26) and 0.76 (95%CI:0.43-1.36) when the first breast cancer diagnosis was >50 
414 
years, compared to a first breast cancer under age 40.  
415 
 
416 
When women were censored at the age of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, the 
417 
contralateral breast cancer risks at 20 years after the first breast cancer were 38% 
418 
(95%CI:31-45%) for BRCA1 and 34% (95%CI:25-45%) for BRCA2 carriers (Supplement, 
419 
eTable 8).  
420 
 
421 
To investigate potential survival bias, the analysis was repeated after excluding women 
422 
whose first breast cancer diagnosis occurred >5 years prior to study recruitment.  The 
423 
estimated cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer at 20 years after the first breast 
424 
cancer diagnosis was 41% (95%CI:32-53%) for BRCA1 and 21% (95%CI:15-50%) for 
425 
BRCA2 carriers.   
426 
 
427 
Breast and ovarian cancer risks by family history 
428 
The estimated cumulative breast and ovarian cancer risks by family history are shown in 
429 
Table 4 and eFigure 3. Breast cancer risk estimates for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers 
430 
increased with the number of first- and second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast 
431 
cancer (p-trend:<.001 for BRCA1; 0.02 for BRCA2, Table 4). The breast cancer HR estimate 
432 
  
19 
for women with two or more first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer 
433 
compared with those with no family history of breast cancer was 1.99 (95%CI:1.41-2.82) for 
434 
BRCA1 (cumulative risk estimates to age 70 : 73% (95%CI: 65-80%) vs 53% (95%CI:39-
435 
69%)) and 1.91 (95%CI:1.08-3.37) for BRCA2 carriers (cumulative risks to age 70: 65% 
436 
(95%CI: 56-74%) vs 39% (95%CI: 25-56%), Table 4).  
437 
 
438 
There was no significant difference in ovarian cancer risk for BRCA1 carriers with family 
439 
history of ovarian cancer compared with those without, (HR=1.37, 95%CI:0.89-2.11, Table 4; 
440 
Supplement eFigure 3). A similar pattern was observed for BRCA2 carriers but the number 
441 
of events for women with ovarian cancer family history was small (N=5). Results were similar 
442 
when we restricted family history of cancer to first-degree relatives (Supplement eTable 9), 
443 
or when analyses were stratified by the presence of family history of the second cancer  
444 
(Supplement eTables 10, 11, 12 and 13 results in Supplementary Material). For BRCA1 
445 
mutation carriers, the risk of breast cancer was lower for women with a family history of 
446 
ovarian cancer compared with those with no family history of ovarian cancer (HR=0.71, 
447 
95%CI:0.51-0.99 and HR=0.38, 95%CI:0.21-0.70 from analysis of women with a family 
448 
history of breast cancer and from analysis of those without, respectively, Supplement  
449 
eTable 12). 
450 
 
451 
Breast and ovarian cancer risks by mutation position 
452 
BRCA1 mutations located outside the region bounded by positions c.2282 to c.4071 were 
453 
associated with a significantly higher breast cancer risk compared to mutations within the 
454 
region (HR=1.46 (95%CI:1.11-1.93), p=0.007, Table 4, eFigure 4) but there was no 
455 
significant difference in ovarian cancer risk. There was no significant difference in the breast 
456 
or ovarian cancer risks for either the BRCA1 c.68_69delAG or c.5266dupC mutations when 
457 
compared to BRCA1 mutations in the same region (Table 4). BRCA2 mutations outside the 
458 
OCCR region were associated with a significantly higher breast cancer risk compared to 
459 
mutations within OCCR (based on the narrow OCCR definition: HR=1.70 (95%CI:1.18-2.46), 
460 
  
20 
p=.005; based on the broad OCCR definition: HR=1.93 (95%CI:1.36-2.74), p<.001 Table 4) 
461 
but there was no significant difference in ovarian cancer risk. There was no significant 
462 
difference in breast cancer risk for BRCA2 c.5946delT mutation carriers compared to other 
463 
OCCR BRCA2 mutations (HR=0.73 95%CI:0.35-1.54,  p=.41). The associations by mutation 
464 
position remained significant after adjusting for family history of breast cancer and after 
465 
excluding carriers of BRCA2: c.5946delT from the OCCR region (eTable14).  
466 
 
467 
Discussion 
468 
This study estimated age-specific risks of breast, ovarian, and contralateral breast cancer for 
469 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers using data from a prospective cohort. Because the 
470 
study mainly included unaffected women identified by mutation screening based on cancer 
471 
family history, early age at onset of a family member, or both, the overall estimates are 
472 
relevant to mutation carriers identified through clinical testing. However, the wide range of 
473 
family histories represented allowed an examination of the relationship between family 
474 
history and cancer risk. The results indicate that family history is a strong risk factor for 
475 
mutation carriers and that cancer risks vary by mutation location, suggesting that 
476 
individualized counseling should incorporate both family history profiles and mutation 
477 
location. 
478 
 
479 
The cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 was 72% for BRCA1 and 69% for 
480 
BRCA2 mutation carriers respectively. For ovarian cancer the cumulative risks by age 80 
481 
were 44% for BRCA1 and 17% for BRCA2 carriers. Breast cancer incidence for carriers 
482 
increased rapidly with age in early adulthood then plateaued to remain relatively constant 
483 
throughout the remaining lifetime. The age at which this plateau was  reached was  31-40 
484 
years for BRCA1 carriers and 5-10 years later for BRCA2 carriers. The incidence during the 
485 
plateau was  similar for both groups of mutation carriers. This is consistent with the model for 
486 
genetic risk of breast cancer based on twin data20, in which the age-specific incidence for 
487 
  
21 
genetically susceptible women increases  to a high constant level by a predetermined age 
488 
that varies between families.  
489 
 
490 
The estimated breast and ovarian cancer risks were consistent with findings from 
491 
retrospective family-based studies2,3,6,10. The breast cancer SIRs decreased with increasing 
492 
age for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, but the estimates were higher than those 
493 
previously reported for younger age groups21,22. From this prospective study, the estimated 
494 
cumulative risks of ovarian cancer were low to age 40 for BRCA1 mutation carriers, and to 
495 
age 50 for BRCA2 mutation carriers. 
496 
 
497 
This study was limited in the extent to which differences by birth cohort could be assessed 
498 
because birth cohort was strongly associated with age. For age intervals with sufficient 
499 
observations, there was no evidence of risk differences (Supplement,  eFigure 5). 
500 
 
501 
In line with retrospective studies of contralateral breast cancer risks23,24, the present 
502 
prospective analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers combined demonstrated a higher risk 
503 
when the first breast cancer was diagnosed before age 40 years versus after age 50 years 
504 
(p=0.03).  
505 
 
506 
The contralateral breast cancer analysis also included women diagnosed with breast cancer 
507 
prior to study recruitment. The median interval between first breast cancer diagnosis and 
508 
study recruitment was 4 years and this did not vary by the age at first breast cancer 
509 
diagnosis or by gene. The inclusion of survivors could potentially bias the estimation of 
510 
contralateral breast cancer risks, if such risks were related to the outcome of the first cancer; 
511 
however, there is no strong evidence of such a relationship in the general population. 
512 
Furthermore, the results were similar after excluding women whose first breast cancer 
513 
diagnosis occurred >5 years prior to study recruitment, suggesting that any bias is likely to 
514 
  
22 
be small. Contralateral breast cancer risks have been shown to be reduced by adjuvant 
515 
treatment of the first cancer25,26. BRCA2 carriers are more likely to develop estrogen-
516 
receptor positive cancers, so their lower contralateral breast cancer risk estimates may in 
517 
part be due to greater use of endocrine therapy. Hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatments 
518 
were not considered so the present estimates represent risks averaged over different 
519 
treatments.  
520 
 
521 
There was increasing breast cancer risk for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers with increasing 
522 
number of relatives who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Similar patterns were 
523 
observed for the risk of ovarian cancer but the number of events for women with family 
524 
history of ovarian cancer was small. The overall breast cancer risk estimates were 
525 
somewhat higher than those estimated by kin-cohort analyses, in which the risks are derived 
526 
from cohorts of relatives of carriers identified among unselected cases3,22. The present 
527 
cohort of mutation carriers was primarily identified through clinical genetics centers and 
528 
included women who, on average, are likely to have stronger family history of cancer 
529 
compared with mutation carriers identified through population-based sampling of cases. 
530 
Therefore, a likely explanation for the higher estimated risks in the present study is that 
531 
cancer risks for mutation carriers are modified by genetic and non-genetic risk factors which 
532 
aggregate in families, in line with evidence that other genetic factors modify cancer risks for 
533 
mutation carriers18,27-30. These results confirm that family history should be taken into 
534 
account in determining cancer risks for carriers, as modelled explicitly in BOADICEA3. 
535 
 
536 
This prospective analysis validates retrospective analyses demonstrating that cancer risk 
537 
varies by mutation location within the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.16-18. Consistent with those 
538 
findings, mutations that lie in exon 11 of either gene were associated with a lower breast 
539 
cancer risk and possibly higher ovarian cancer risk. The number of women in this 
540 
prospective cohort was too small to estimate risks for additional, recently identified, breast or 
541 
ovarian cancer cluster regions18. 
542 
  
23 
 
543 
This study has several limitations. Data on tumor-phenotypes of cancers were not available. 
544 
Therefore, the results represent average estimates over all phenotypes of breast and 
545 
ovarian cancer. Although there was variation in the cancer risks for mutation carriers by 
546 
cancer family history, the study sample was not identified through population screening of 
547 
unaffected women. Therefore, the overall estimates may not be directly applicable to such 
548 
women. The present results suggest that cancer risks for women with no family history are 
549 
likely to be lower than those estimated here. The cancer risk estimates may be subject to 
550 
some selection bias if the decision to participate in the study or opt for testing was related to 
551 
factors that are associated with disease risk. It was not possible to contrast the unaffected 
552 
study participants to all other unaffected family members who tested negative or who did not 
553 
opt for a genetic test or for study participation, as those data could be not be collected. 
554 
However, the analysis by family history addresses possible selection bias with respect to 
555 
family history of cancer and the family history-specific estimates are expected to be 
556 
unbiased. The number of events in some of the subgroups considered was small and 
557 
therefore the estimates have wide confidence intervals. Family size was not taken into 
558 
consideration because data on unaffected family members were not collected systematically. 
559 
In addition, risk estimates are limited by the lack of information about the use of hormonal 
560 
therapies to prevent either first primary or contralateral breast cancers.  
561 
 
562 
Conclusions 
563 
These findings provide information on cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers 
564 
using prospective data, and  demonstrate the potential importance of family history and 
565 
mutation location in risk assessment.
