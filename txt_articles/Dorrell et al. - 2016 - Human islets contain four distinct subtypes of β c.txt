Human pancreatic islets of Langerhans contain five distinct endocrine cell types, each
producing a characteristic hormone. The dysfunction or loss of the insulin-producing b cells
causes diabetes mellitus, a disease that harms millions. Until now, b cells were generally
regarded as a single, homogenous cell population. Here we identify four antigenically
distinct subtypes of human b cells, which we refer to as b1–4, and which are distinguished
by differential expression of ST8SIA1 and CD9. These subpopulations are always present
in normal adult islets and have diverse gene expression profiles and distinct basal and
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Importantly, the b cell subtype distribution is profoundly
altered in type 2 diabetes. These data suggest that this antigenically defined b cell
heterogeneity is functionally and likely medically relevant.

 P
ancreatic b cells are the glucose-responsive, insulin-
secreting metabolic sensor population of the Islets of
Langerhans1. Although the cellular composition of islets
is heterogeneous, including a, b, d, g/PP and e endocrine
cells and supporting vasculature, b cells have been thought to
be a homogeneous cell type. Despite this prevailing paradigm,
there have long been hints of functional heterogeneity2,3. In vitro
studies of individual rat b cells have revealed variable glucose
responsiveness and insulin secretion upon challenge4. Rat studies
also provided evidence of marker heterogeneity; both a poly-
sialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)5
and CDH16 were shown to be overrepresented on b cells with
high insulin secretion capacity. In human islets, SLC18A2/
VMAT2 (ref. 7) and DKK3 (ref. 8) were found in b cell subsets
and heterogeneity in insulin secretion has also been suggested9. In
this report, we explore human b cell heterogeneity with new
markers
and
identify
subpopulations
present
at
different
frequencies in
healthy and
type 2
diabetes (T2D) islets.
Dissimilar basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)
characteristics indicate that these subtypes are functionally
distinct, and suggest possible clinical relevance.
Results
Development of antibodies to assess cellular heterogeneity. To
study cell type heterogeneity in the human pancreas, we
developed cell surface marking antibodies by immunizing mice
with human islets. These monoclonal antibodies permit the
labelling, isolation and study of ducts, acinar cells and endocrine
cells10,11. Live human pancreatic b cells were purified with
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the combination
of positive selection with the pan-endocrine marker HPi2
(HIC1-2B4) and negative selection for HPa3 (HIC3-2D12), an
antibody
that
labels
all
non-b
endocrine
cell
types
(Supplementary Fig. 1)11. To determine whether this ‘pure’
HPi2 þ/HPa3 � b cell population was actually heterogeneous, we
examined numerous cell surface antigens known to be expressed
on b cells from transcriptome analysis10 and systematically
analysed our novel monoclonal antibody collection12 for subset
binding. Two antibodies exhibited clear antigenic heterogeneity
within the b cell compartment: HIC0-3C5, a novel monoclonal
antibody developed in our anti-islet screens and monoclonal
antibodies recognizing CD9, a tetraspanin identified as a b cell
marker in our transcriptome analyses. To identify the antigen for
HIC0-3C5, rat C6 cells carrying a human cDNA library were
screened by FACS isolation and the re-growth of positively
labelled cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). The HIC0-3C5 antigen was
revealed by cDNA insert sequencing to be ST8SIA1, an alpha-N-
acetylneuraminide
alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase
of
unknown
function in endocrine cells13. Neither of these b cell-subset
markers were expressed exclusively in this cell type; in the
pancreas, ST8SIA1 is found on about half of a cells and CD9 is
present on most d cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b).
b cells can be subdivided into antigenic subtypes. Live
pancreatic b cells were isolated from human islet samples by FACS
and co-labelled with antibodies recognizing ST8SIA1 and CD9,
revealing four antigenically distinct subpopulations (Fig. 1). We
labelled these b1–4, with b1 being most abundant and b4 most rare.
Transmission electron microscopic imaging of evaluable popula-
tions revealed comparable structures and confirmed the presence of
insulin granules in each subtype (Supplementary Fig. 4). The sub-
type frequencies were similar in 17 healthy individuals (Fig. 1k), and
all four subpopulations were present in each case. b1 was the largest
subpopulation, followed by b2 and the minor b3 and b4 popula-
tions. Subset frequencies were compared with available clinical
parameters including gender, age, body mass index and time of cold
ischaemia for the donor and specimen, but no significant correla-
tions were observed. Importantly, the subtype percentages of heal-
thy obese individuals (body mass index430) did not differ from
healthy, lean people (Fig. 2).
Assessment of b cell-subset markers in intact tissue. Human
islet preparations from cadaveric donors are typically cultured
for days before becoming available for analysis14,15. Therefore, it
was possible that the observed antigenic b cell heterogeneity
was
the
product
of
in
vitro
de-differentiation
and
not
representative of true in vivo heterogeneity. To address this
possibility, we assessed the expression of ST8SIA1 and CD9 in
sections of human pancreata. Figure 3a illustrates co-labelling
of
CD9
and
proinsulin,
the
non-secreted
precursor
of
(b cell-specific) insulin. Most proinsulin þ b cells were CD9 �,
but a large subpopulation of proinsulin þCD9 þ
cells was
present, as predicted by FACS analysis. Similar heterogeneity,
with a smaller proportion of positively marked b cells, was
observed for ST8SIA1 (Fig. 3b). Quantification of the subtype
frequencies in 100 tissue-resident islets fell within the range
expected
from
the
FACS
data
(Supplementary
Fig.
5).
Combination labelling with both b cell subset markers directly
illustrates the antigenic heterogeneity of human b cells (Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Fig. 3c). These results demonstrate b cell
heterogeneity in situ, indicating that it is not an artefact of islet
isolation or culture. Protein-level evidence of heterogeneity was
also observed for HCN1 (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-
activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1; Fig. 3d), which had
been identified as a potential b cell-subset marker by RNA
expression analysis (Table 1).
b cell subsets have differences in gene expression. We next
determined whether antigenic heterogeneity correlated with
functional differences between the b cell subsets. Transcriptome
analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on the
b cell subsets of five healthy donors. Importantly, all four
populations clearly displayed the gene expression profile of classic
b cells with very high levels of insulin mRNA and other typical
marker genes, such as PDX1, MAFA and NKX6.1. Indeed, the
four populations are overall very similar in their RNA expression
profile (Fig. 4a). A heat map showing the expression of a selected
list of genes known to be important for b cell function is shown in
Fig. 4b. Nonetheless, a subset of genes was consistently expressed
at different levels in the b cell subtypes (Fig. 4c,d, Table 1 and
Supplementary Figs 6–9). Using stringent statistical cutoffs, a
sizeable list of genes (125 with false discovery rater0.1, 72r0.05
and 49r0.01) was found to be differentially expressed between
the ST8SIA1-positive (b3/4) and -negative (b1/2) populations
(Fig. 4c, Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7) as well as the
CD9 þ
and
CD9 �
populations
(107

discovery
rater0.1,
86r0.05
and
45r0.01,
Fig.
4d
and
Supplementary
Figs

and
9).
Given
the
inter-individual
heterogeneity inherent to human clinical specimens, these
differences are highly significant and likely represent only a
minimal estimate of the true transcriptome heterogeneity.
Contamination with other endocrine cell types was negligible
(Supplementary Fig. 10), but nonetheless all genes known to be
robustly expressed in non-b pancreatic cells were removed from
analysis. As expected, the genes encoding the antigens used for
cell isolation, CD9 and ST8SIA1, were expressed at significantly
higher levels in the b2/4 and b3/4 populations, respectively
(Fig. 4c,d, Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 6 and 8). Most of the
differentially expressed genes are of unknown function in b cells,
but some have been clearly associated with insulin secretion

 (for examples, GLUT2 (ref. 16), PPP1R1A17 and ABCC9/SUR2
(ref. 18)) or are known to be dysregulated in T2D (for examples,
G6PC2 (ref. 19, RPB4 (ref. 20) and MAFB21). Interestingly, the
ST8SIA1 � population is significantly enriched for GO biological
processes related to protein secretion including ‘Regulation
of Insulin Secretion’ (n ¼ 9, P ¼ 0.012), whereas ST8SIA1 þ is
enriched for ‘Neurogenesis’ (n ¼ 16, P ¼ 0.012). Thus, by gene
expression, it might be expected that the ST8SIA1 � b cells are
more capable of secreting insulin. Among the other genes
expressed heterogeneously in b cells, one example with possible
relevance to insulin secretion is the f-channel HCN1, which was
increased
threefold
in
the
ST8SIA1 þ
(b3/4)
populations.
Co-labelling of HCN1 with proinsulin confirmed that b cells
exhibit a range of HCN1 expression at the protein level (Fig. 3d).
Several transcription factors were also differentially expressed,
including SIX3, RFX6, MAFB and NEUROD1. Notably, SIX3 was
recently shown to be important for b cell maturation during
ageing and higher expression levels were found to enhance insulin
secretion22. Other previously reported human heterogeneity
markers, that is, VMAT2 (ref. 7) or DKK3 (ref. 8) were not
significantly differentially expressed in our subsets.
Functional assessment of insulin secretion. However, most of
the genes identified here as differentially expressed in human
b cell subsets currently lack a known role in this cell type.
We therefore also wanted to ascertain whether functional
differences between the subsets could be identified, particularly in
regard to insulin secretion. Although FACS sorted single-cell
suspensions
of
individual
b
cell
subtypes
lacked
glucose
responsiveness, GSIS was re-established by forming subtype
aggregates in overnight co-culture (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Post-assay viability was comparable (92–96%) in the different
subtypes. Despite having equivalent insulin mRNA (Fig. 5a) and
protein (Fig. 5b) content, differences in basal and GSIS were
found. Basal insulin secretion in islet subtype aggregates was
lowest for b1 (0.12±0.01 pmol per cell per h) and highest for b4
(0.25±0.23 pmol per cell per h; Fig. 5c), and the difference
between
these
subtypes
was
significant
(P ¼ 0.04).
More
importantly, there were clear differences in GSIS (Fig. 5c,d).
Analyses of reaggregated subtypes from five normal islet samples
revealed that the stimulation index of b1 aggregates (3.2±0.9 � )
was significantly higher than that of b2 (2.0±0.4 � ), b3
(1.9±0.6 � ) or b4 (1.4±0.2 � ). Given the clear differences in

 insulin secretion and the observation of differential expression of
some genes involved in insulin secretion, we wondered whether
differentially regulated genes of unknown function in human
b cells may also be involved in this process. The HCN channel
genes HCN1 and HCN4 were chosen for functional evaluation,
because HCN2 was previously shown to be involved in insulin
secretion in rats23,24. Ivabradine, a specific inhibitor of HCN
channels25, was tested on whole human islets. Basal insulin
secretion was significantly increased in the presence of the
inhibitor (Fig. 5e), whereas GSIS was significantly suppressed
(Fig. 5e,f). To prove that inhibition of HCN channels affected
b cells directly and not via paracrine effects, ivabradine was tested
on b-like cells generated from pluripotent precursors in vitro26.
No other HCN-expressing cell
types are
present in this
model. HCN inhibition significantly increased basal insulin
secretion (Fig. 5g) as it had in intact islets. GSIS was not
significantly altered (Fig. 5h). Together, these functional data
show that the HCN genes differentially expressed in b cell
subtypes play a role in modulating human insulin secretion,
consistent with observations in rodents27. This ‘spot-test’ of the
differentially
expressed
gene
list
further
strengthens
our
conclusion that human b cell subtypes differ in their insulin
release kinetics.
Diabetic islets have an abnormal b cell subtype distribution.
Given that both gene expression analysis and insulin secretion
analysis
indicated
functional
heterogeneity
among
the
b cell subtypes, we wondered whether disease states could affect
the subset composition of human islets. To determine whether
the alterations of islet structure and function associated with
T2D28 affected subset distribution, islet samples from eight
patients were examined. The total recoverable (live, non-doublet)
b cell frequencies in these specimens fell within the range for
normal
specimens
(15–45%
of
all
endocrine
cells),
but
the
distribution
of
subtypes
was
highly
variable

clearly
different
from
that

 (Fig. 1c–j), the frequencies of the ST8SIA1 þ

populations
(normally
B18%)
was
unusually
high.
The
differences
in
subtype
percentages
were
highly
significant
between islets from normal individuals (both lean and obese)
and those from T2D patients (Fig. 1l). In two additional
patients, the b cell subset pattern was also very abnormal, but
either the ST8SIA1 þ population had disappeared (Fig. 1e)
or the primary abnormality was a very high percentage of CD9 þ
cells (Fig. 1i). These data indicate that the frequencies of
b cell subtypes are altered in the majority of individuals with
T2D diabetes.
Discussion
Most of the 200 þ human cell types thought to exist were
originally identified by nineteenth century histology methods.
However, the advent of monoclonal antibody surface markers
has led to the identification of important cellular subtypes among
morphologically homogenous cell populations, most notably in
the haematopoietic system29. Functional heterogeneity among
b cells had long been suspected based on functional assays
suggesting cells with different insulin release kinetics2,9, but until
now it was impossible to prospectively isolate the subtypes.
Here we demonstrate the existence of at least four distinct

 human b cell subtypes that can be separated based on cell
surface marker expression. Clear differences in both basal and
stimulated insulin secretion behaviour were observed between
the subtypes, suggesting that the b subpopulations differ in
their insulin release kinetics. These dissimilarities may serve to
create smooth rather than sharp changes in insulin secretion in
response to various stimuli and ensure that rapid shifts in blood
glucose levels do not occur. Differentially expressed genes found
here are good candidates to be modifiers of insulin release.
We were able to demonstrate this directly for the HCN
channels, which, until now, have not been known to play
functional role in human b cells30. It seems unlikely that a
single differentially expressed gene regulates the subtype insulin
release kinetics. Instead, they probably act in concert. Future
functional
genomic
studies
should
unravel
the
relative
contributions of each factor. Recent work by Bader et al.31
shows that distinct b cell subtypes can also be found in the
mouse. Using the Wnt pathway target gene Fltp as a marker, they
demonstrated that these subtypes have distinct developmental
origins, suggesting that this may also be the case with the human
b cell subtypes described here. The genes differentially expressed
in the murine subtypes only partially overlap with our human
gene list, but like the human b cell subtypes, the murine subtypes
differ in their insulin release kinetics. The clearly abnormal
distribution of b cell subsets in the majority of our small T2D
sample set raises the possibility that the subtypes differ in their
susceptibility to metabolic stress28,32, proliferative capacity33 or
differentiation state34. In normal islets, the ST8SIA1 þ b3 and b4
populations, that is, those increased in most T2D patients, are less
responsive to glucose. It is unclear at this time whether the four
b
cell
subtypes
are
indicative
of
different
developmental
origins or whether they represent different functional and
inter-convertible states of a single b cell type. However, given
the remarkable reproducibility of their distribution percentages in
normal islets obtained from many independent donors, it is
unlikely that the subtypes could be the result of circadian,
acute
metabolic
or
ageing
processes.
Regardless
of
their
ontogeny, the different properties of human b cell subtypes
likely have an important impact on metabolic regulation and
human disease processes.
Methods
Tissue sources and pancreatic cell isolation. Human pancreatic islets from
normal and diabetic donors were obtained from the NIDDK-funded Integrated
Islet Distribution Program at City of Hope15. These were collected from approved,
consented cadaveric organ donors from which at least one other organ has been
approved for transplantation and are exempt from human studies approval.
Specimens were dispersed to single-cell suspensions by a 8–12 min digestion in
0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher) at 37 �C with dispersal by a p1000
micropipetter every 3 min. Undispersed tissue was removed with a 40-mm cell
strainer and dissociated cells were stored on ice in CMRL1066 þ 2% FBS before
antibody labelling. The number of samples analysed was determined primarily by
material availability (especially in the case of T2D specimens) but was chosen to be
sufficient for statistical analysis.
Immunofluorescence imaging. Pancreatic cryosections (5 mm) from multiple
donors were prepared from unfixed tissue in OCT blocks using a Reichert 2800
Frigocut (Reichert Scientific Instruments), treated with acetone for 10 min at � 20 �C,
and stored for up to 2 months at � 80 �C. Non-specific labelling was blocked by pre-
incubation in 2% goat serum (Hyclone) for 10 min. Initial labelling was performed
with anti-human proinsulin (GS-9A8, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and
detected/blocked with Cy3-conjugated monovalent Fab fragment goat anti-mouse IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-167-003) at high concentration (1:40 dilution) to
permit detection of multiple primary antibodies of the same species. Subsequent
labelling employed hybridoma supernatants diluted 1:20 (HPi2 or HPa3) and/or
purified antibodies (anti-HCN1, ab84816, Abcam; biotinylated anti-CD9, 558749, BD
Biosciences) diluted 1:200 in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) for 30 min
and secondary labelling with 1:200 dilutions of Alexa488- or Alexa649-conjugated

visualized with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). A Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus micro-
scope (Carl Zeiss) was used for imaging.
Flow cytometry and FACS. Dissociated cells were resuspended at 1 � 106 cells per

supernatants (at a 1:20 dilution) and biotinylated anti-CD9 (eBioscience,
13-0098-80; 1:200 dilution) and incubation at 4 �C (for 30 min). After a wash with
cold CMRL1066, cells were resuspended in CMRL1066 þ 2% FBS containing a
1:200 dilution of PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch)
and a 1:100 dilution of PE-Cy7-conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences, 557598).
After another wash, cells were resuspended in CMRL1066 (Corning) þ 5% mouse

of several of these antibodies have been previously described12. Cell doublets were
excluded by pulse width measurement and propidium iodide staining was used to
label dead cells for exclusion. Cells were analysed and sorted with a Cytopeia

b cell aggregation culture. A modified version of a co-aggregation culture
developed for rat b cells35 was employed to permit functional assessment of
FACS-sorted human b cells. On the day before the b cell isolation by FACS,
a culture of mouse MS1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
CRL-2279) was obtained from ATCC and established under standard adherent
culture conditions. Following the isolation and brief storage of human b cells
(at low glucose concentration), MS1 cells were recovered by trypsinization and
combined with b cells at a 10:1 (MS1/b) ratio. This cell mixture was cultured
in CMRL1066 þ 5% human serum albumin þ 10 mM HEPES þ antibiotic/
antimycotic in a suspension (untreated) 24 w plate (Genesee Scientific)
at 37 �C for 16 h. These cultures produced a mixture of single cells and small-to-
medium sized aggregates (50–200 mm diameter), as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 11. For basal and stimulated c-peptide measurement, cells and clusters were
recovered, washed with Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) þ 2.8 mM glucose and
assayed as described below.

 b-like cell differentiation and characterization. Human embryonic stem cell
(hESC)-derived b-like cells were generated using our recently published differ-
entiation approach with improvements at the last two stages26. For basal secretion
and GSIS analysis, these hESC-derived spheres were transferred into tubes and
washed twice with KRB þ 2.8 mM glucose, and assayed as described below.
GSIS analysis. Samples (aggregated FACS-sorted b cells or hESC-derived spheres)
were removed from media and equilibrated by incubation for 30 min at 37 �C in
KRB þ 2.8 mM glucose with or without 30 mM ivabradine (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were then transferred to fresh assay media (KRB þ 2.8 mM (basal) or
22.2 mM (stimulated) glucose with or without ivabradine for 1.5 h at 37 �C).
After incubation, buffers were collected and frozen for subsequent human
c-peptide-specific ELISA analysis (Mercodia). For hESC-derived spheres, total
human c-peptide content analysis was performed by measurement of an aliquot of
acidic ethanol lysed clusters by human c-peptide ELISA (Alpco). Statistical analyses
of the results were performed using Graphpad Prism 4.0 (for analysis of variance
tests) and Microsoft Excel (for mean, standard deviation and t-tests).
RNA-seq library construction, sequencing and data analyses. Cell populations
were sorted directly into Trizol LS (Invitrogen) and stored at � 80�C. For RNA
recovery, samples were phenol/chloroform extracted before purification with RNeasy
mini columns (Qiagen). Illumina RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from total RNA
using the NuGen Ovation Pico kit to produce cDNA for 12 samples (four cell types
from three donors). Fragmentation, blunt-ending, A-tailing and adapter ligation
were then performed with the Illumina non-stranded RNA-Seq library prep kit to
produced indexed libraries. The libraries were pooled and sequenced across two
lanes of a hiSeq2000 to 100 bp single-read to an average depth of 19.7 million reads
per sample. Gene expression values where generated for human genome release hg19
using RUM36. Differential expression was assessed using EdgeR37 using a two-factor
analysis (donor id and b cell type). False discovery rates were calculated from
P-values using the R function p.adjust in BH mode. For heat maps, reads per kb were
normalized to the sample with the most reads. Normalization was done by a scaling
the reads per kb values by the mean ratio for expressed genes, after removing the
highly expressed genes. The median log2 expression for each gene was calculated
for each donor then cell type-specific changes compared with this value. To reduce
noise associated with differential contamination of the b cell subsets, genes known to
be differentially expressed in non-b populations were excluded from the list of
differentially expressed genes shown in Table 1, Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs 6–9).
Visualizations presented in Supplementary Figs 6–9 were generated using STRING
(http://string-db.org/) (ref. 38).
Antigen identification by cDNA expression library analysis. Rat C6 glioma cells
(ATCC, CCL-107) were obtained from ATCC and transduced with a lentiviral
library encoding version 5.1 of the human ORFeome library39 and screened by
FACS for reactivity against HIC0-3C5. Two cycles of sorting HIC0-3C5 þ C6 cells,
amplification in culture and re-sorting yielded sufficient material for DNA and
RNA recovery. PCR amplification of the cDNA insert from HIC0-3C5 þ C6
cells was unsuccessful, so an RNAseq library was constructed and sequenced. The
resulting sequences were searched for reads corresponding to ORFeome
integrations and then compared with human cDNA sequences present in
ORFeome 5.1 by BLAST27. Of the 17 mappable reads, 14 matched the 50 region
of ST8SIA1. In addition, the expression of ST8SIA1 was found to be consistently
enriched in the RNA of FACS-sorted HIC0-3C5 þ versus HIC0-3C5 � specimens
by qRT–PCR and RNA-seq.

Expression Omnibus) under accession code GSE80780. The authors declare that all
