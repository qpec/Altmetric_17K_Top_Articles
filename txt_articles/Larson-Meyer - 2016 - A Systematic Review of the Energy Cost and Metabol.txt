ABSTRACT 
 
Purpose: With the increasing popularity of Hatha yoga, it is important to understand the energy 
cost and metabolic equivalents (METs) of yoga practice within the context of the American 
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association (AHA) physical 
activity guidelines. Methods: This systematic review evaluated the energy cost and metabolic 
intensity of yoga practice including yoga asanas (poses/postures) and pranayamas (breath 
exercises) measured by indirect calorimetry.  The English Speaking Literature was surveyed via 
Pubmed using the general terms “yoga” and “energy expenditure” with no date limitations. 
Results: Thirteen manuscripts were initially identified with an additional four located from 
review of manuscript references. Of the 17 studies, ten evaluated the energy cost and metabolic 
equivalents (METs) of full yoga sessions or flow through Surya Namaskar (sun salutations), 
eight of individual asanas and five of pranayamas. METs for yoga practice averaged 3.3±1.6 
(range=1.83 to 7.4 METs) and 2.9±0.8 METS when one outlier (i.e., 7.4 METS for Surya 
Namaskar) was omitted. METs for individual asanas averaged 2.2±0.7 (range=1.4 to 4.0 METs) 
whereas that of pranayamas was 1.3±0.3.  Based on ACSM/AHA classification, the intensity of 
most asanas and of full yoga sessions ranged from light-, less than 3 METS, to moderate-aerobic 
intensity, 3 to 6 METS, with the majority classified as light-intensity. Conclusion: This review 
suggests that yoga is typically classified as a light-intensity physical activity. However, a few 
sequences/poses including Surya Namaskar meet the criteria for moderate-to vigorous-intensity 
activity. In accordance with the ACSM/AHA guidelines the practice of asana sequences with 
MET intensities above 3 (i.e., >10 min), can be accumulated throughout the day and count 
towards daily recommendations for moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity. Key

INTRODUCTION 
Hatha yoga is an increasingly popular form of physical activity in the United States (4, 
18, 21, 40) and may be one of the world’s fastest growing health and fitness activities (4). Yoga 
originated in ancient India where its practice was intended to help “redirect a person’s search for 
happiness from external sources to internal ones” and eventually result in life fulfilment, 
wholeness and enlightenment (8, 29). Hatha yoga is one path that traditionally integrates the 
physical practice of asanas (holding poses or postures), pranayama (breathing control/exercise), 
bandhas (muscular contractions), mudras (seals and gestures), kriyas (internal cleansing 
techniques) and meditation (contemplative thought) along with a spiritually-based philosophical 
framework (e.g., which includes the nonviolence, truthfulness, non-stealing, etc. Since the 
1960’s and 70’s, Hatha yoga has undergone various adaptations in the US and has become a 
practice believed to promote physical fitness, stress reduction and relaxation (4, 8, 29). Yoga is 
offered in a majority of US health clubs (8) as well as a growing number of yoga studios and 
private homes. Classes are typically 60 to 90 minutes in duration and involve flowing through a 
series of asanas and pranayama.  Depending on the style, studio and/or teacher, asanas are held 
standing, seated or supine for various amounts of time and may involve balance and inversion 
poses with focus on proper form, alignment and breathing. The rhythmic flow through a specific 
sequence of 12 asanas with controlled breath, termed Surya Namaskar (sun salutations), are often 
incorporated into many styles/classes and are thought to promote cardiorespiratory fitness (23). 
Classes typically end in a supine posture called Savasana (corpse pose) and many incorporate 
meditation. Specific styles of yoga such as Bikram (4, 7) and hot power yoga (4) have also 
separated from traditional Hatha practice. Both styles—although distinctly different-- incorporate 
set sequences of basic Hatha poses but are conducted in a hot and humidified room. Practice in

this environment is believed to loosen joints, muscles and tendons and help students push 
themselves, providing a gratifying sense of progress (4). Yoga has even emerged as a component 
of the new-generation active computer games (13, 22) with WII Fit plus software containing at 
least 18 modes of yoga (22).  
  
Recent data suggests that as many as 20.4 million Americans (8.4% of the US 
population) practiced yoga in 2012, up from 15.8 million in the previous 2008 survey, with an 
additional 44.4% expressing interest in trying yoga (40). With the increasing popularity of Hatha 
yoga, it is important to understand the energy cost and intensity of yoga and its various asanas 
and pranayamas within the context of the public health and exercise prescription guidelines 
recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (2, 10, 12, 16) and the 
American Heart Association (AHA) (16). To promote and maintain health and reduce disease 
risk, the ACSM/AHA guidelines encourage 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical 
activity five days per week or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 20 minutes 
three days per week. The public health guidelines define absolute intensity in terms of metabolic 
equivalents (METs) (16) rather than estimates of relative intensity that are more commonly used 
for individual exercise prescriptions. These typically include percentages of maximal heart rate 
(%HRmax), heart rate reserve (%HRR), maximal oxygen uptake (%VO2max) or maximal oxygen 
uptake reserve (%VO2R) (see Table 1)(12). METs are useful for expressing the energy cost and 
intensity of physical activity as a ratio to metabolic rate at rest, standardized as 3.5 ml/kg/min. in 
a manor comparable among persons of different weights and physical fitness. Moderate- and 
vigorous-physical activity are defined as an intensity between 3 to 6 METs and greater than 6 
METs, respectively (16).  Current physical activity guidelines also emphasize that combinations 
of moderate and vigorous-intensity activity are likely to have similar health benefits as

continuous activity and can be combined in shorter bouts of at least 10 minutes throughout the 
day to meet guidelines. The goal is to achieve 450 to 750 MET minutes per week (i.e., METs X 
daily min accumulated X number of times per week) (16).   
The purpose of this paper is to twofold: 1) provide a systematic review and evaluation of 
the literature concerning energy cost and intensity of yoga asanas and yoga practice according to 
the current ACSM and AHA guidelines (12, 16); and 2) evaluate the quality of published studies 
measuring the energy cost of yoga asanas, pranayama and complete practice via indirect 
calorimetery.  Although a small handful of studies have measured the metabolic cost of 
individual yoga asanas and full yoga sessions, a summary of the energy cost and intensity of 
yoga is not currently available for yoga as it is for other sports (1). This information may prove 
useful to the exercise, nutrition and medical professional prescribing yoga as a fitness activity or 
recommending yoga practice for weight loss and/or weight maintenance (10).  It may also be 
useful for yoga teachers and practitioners. 
  
METHODS 
The English Speaking literature was surveyed via Pubmed and cross checked with Web 
of Science using the general terms “yoga” and “energy expenditure” with no date limitations. To 
be included, articles had to use indirect calorimetry to calculate energy expenditure from 
measures of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production. Key variables of interest, including 
absolute and relative oxygen uptake, energy expenditure, MET values, heart rate, respiratory rate 
and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were evaluated and summarized from each identified article 
and the references scanned for additional manuscripts not identified in the initial literature 
search. Energy expenditure, METs and relative heart rate (i.e., as a percentage of actual or

estimated max) were calculated from available data if values were not reported by the authors 
using an assumed 5 kcal/liter of O2 consumed, a MET value of 3.5 ml/kg/min and an estimated 
maximal heart rate of 220 minus average age. Attention was also placed on indirect calorimetry 
protocol and methodology which could restrict or interfere with the practice of holding yoga 
asanas and on data reliability (i.e., calibration procedure, measurement performed after fasting or 
a standardized meal, 24 hours after the last bout of strenuous exercise). The names of poses are 
listed in Sanskrit with the common English translation listed in parentheses or defined in figure 
legends.  
The quality of metabolic data collected by indirect calorimetry was evaluated by 
comparing methodology with commonly accepted standard procedures which included: a) the 
collection of expired air into a Douglas bag, meteorological balloon, gasometer or metabolic cart 
and analysis of gas content and volume using gas analyzers, calibrated against standard gases, 
and a gasometer or pneumotach, calibrated with a known volume of air; b) documentation of 
ambient environment including temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure for 
adjustment of gas volume; c) control of time of day of measurement; d) control of subjects recent 
food and fluid intake, vigorous exercise and other factors such as sleep, medications, alcohol and 
tobacco that could alter energy expenditure. Because the various apparatuses may restrict or 
interfere with the practice of holding yoga asanas, attention was also placed on the apparatus 
used to collect expired air (e.g. mouthpiece and nose clips, face mask, and canopy hood), unless 
gases were collected within a room indirect calorimeter. Finally, documentation was made as to 
whether the yoga asanas were held to assure steady state of O2 uptake or whether the asanas were 
performed as a continuous flow.  The commonly used standard during testing of moderate to

more vigorous exercise is to have a participant exercise at a given intensity for at least four 
minutes to ensure steady state and analyze only the last one to two minutes of data.  
 
RESULTS 
Seventeen articles were initially identified using “yoga” and “energy expenditure”; 
thirteen used indirect calorimetry to evaluate the energy cost of various yoga asanas or yoga 
practice and four were not relevant.  An additional five were identified from the reference list of 
the 13 relevant articles, however, one was published only in abstract form with  insufficient data 
for evaluation (5). The publication dates ranged from 1962 to 2015.  Articles included yoga 
asanas practiced in traditional Indian centers (3, 23, 30, 31, 33, 34),  U.S. and European health 
clubs (6, 7, 14), Bikram-style centers (26) and as part of active video games (Wii Fit Plus) (13, 
22).  
Indirect Calorimetry Methodology. Table 2 summarizes the indirect calorimetry 
equipment, procedures and subject control employed and/or reported compared to standard 
methodology. As noted in the table, less than half of the studies reported calibrating the 
metabolic cart (i.e. gas analyzers and pneumotach) prior to testing.  Most did not report time of 
day of measurement or whether participants were asked to fast and/or follow a controlled run in 
diet before testing. Even fewer controlled for fluid intake, sleep or menstrual cycle phase in 
females, all of which could impact energy expenditure and/or heart rate response during yoga. 
Most used commercially available metabolic carts with gases collected using either a mouthpiece 
and nose clips (26, 32) or a face mask (13, 23, 30, 31, 33). Several studies, however, failed to 
report such detail. Two studies (14, 22) measured energy expenditure in a full-room metabolic 
(respiratory) chamber, which allowed for free movement during yoga practice, and one used a

canopy system (ventilated hood) during pranayama (supine breathing) only (38).  The test-retest 
reliability of the energy cost and METs of yoga practice was reported only using the full room 
calorimeter (14) and was found to be sufficiently consistent (ICC .0.97) (14). 
Energy Cost and METs of Yoga Practice. As summarized in Table 3 and Figure 1, the 
MET value of yoga practice, including exclusive movement through Surya Namaskar (Sun 
Salutations Flow), ranged from 2.0 METs during a Wii Yoga session (13) to over 6 METs with 
the exclusive practice of Surya Namaskar in experienced practitioners (23). Of the studies 
included in Figure 1, five evaluated the energy cost of movement through various asanas (some 
including Surya Namaskar) that may be typical of a yoga practice or yoga class (7, 9, 14, 26, 33). 
In three of these studies, yoga participants followed a sequence set by video- or audiotaped 
recordings which included a 56-minute commercially-available beginner Ashtanga yoga DVD 
(14), a 30-minute videotaped, instructor choreographed Hatha yoga routine (7), or a 90-minute 
audio recorded Bikram session (26) which systematically transitioned through Bikrams 26 static 
asanas. In the other two studies, yoga participants flowed through a set sequence of static 
postures at a dictated pace.  For example, Ray and colleagues (33) had participants hold seated 
Hatha postures for one to three minutes for a total of 24-min with rest in the form of Savasana 
(corpse pose) between postures.  The other of Dicarlo and colleagues (9) had participants move 
through 12 Hatha standing poses performed twice per side for 40 seconds with 10-second jump 
transitions into and out of tadasana (mountain pose) between poses.   As shown in Figure 1, a 
MET value of greater than 3 was achieved by the standing Hatha flow with jump transitions (9)  
and flow through Surya Namaskar (sun salutations) in three out of the four studies (7,23,34). 
Flow through Surya Namaskar in experienced practitioners achieved METs in the aerobically 
intense range (23). The Bikram yoga sequence (26) did not result in a greater energy cost or

MET intensity compared to traditional yoga in a thermal-neutral environment. MET values for 
yoga practice averaged 3.3±1.6 METS for all 10 studies and 2.9±0.8 METS when the study of 
Mody (23), which appeared to be a high outlier, was omitted.  
Energy Cost and METs of Individual Yoga Asanas. Eight studies (3, 6, 26, 30-33, 38) 
evaluated the metabolic cost of various yoga asanas held in traditional Hatha or Bikram yoga 
(which is based off of Hatha asanas). The energy cost and METs of all asanas are summarized in 
Table 2 and Figure 2. As previously noted, very few asanas were of the intensity to produce a 
MET value greater than 3 with the exception of Dandayamana-Janushirasana (standing head to 
knee) (26), Dandayamana-Dhanurasana (standing bow), Trikanasana (triangle) (26) and 
Tuladandasana (balancing stick) (26) during Bikram yoga. Standing asanas (9, 26), for the most 
part, produced slightly higher average MET values than seated poses (33), as did backward 
bending poses compared to forward bending postures (i.e., Dhanurasana vs. Paschimottanasana 
or seated wheel compared to forward bend) (3, 33), The average METs of supine poses (i.e., 
Savasana or corpse pose) was comparable to rest (MET value=1.0 (3, 30, 31). 
Inversion poses including Sirsasana (head stand) did not drastically increase metabolic 
rate above the range of 1.7 to 2.5 METs  (6, 32). No published studies, however, measured the 
metabolic cost of some of the more difficult inversions/arm balancing poses including Bakasana 
(crow/crane), Eka Pāda Gālavāsana (flying pigeon) and Adho Mukha Vṛkṣāsana (hand stand) 
which in the author’s lab produced MET values >3 (Larson-Meyer, unpublished data).  
 
Cardiorespiratory Intensity of Yoga.  The percentage of actual or estimated HRmax and 
VO2max elicited by yoga practice and/or individual asanas is shown  in Table 3 for all studies that 
provided heart rate data (6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 23, 26, 33, 34) and/or measured VO2max (7, 9, 33). The 
intensity of typical yoga practice was highly variable among studies ranging from 49% (14) to 
ACCEPTED

71% (9) of actual or estimated heart rate max and from 12 to 40% VO2max. More extreme ranges 
in heart rate were found between Wii yoga (40% HRmax) (13) and both Surya Namaskar (80% 
HRmax) (23) and Bikram yoga (51-90% HRmax) (26).  Interpretation of HRmax appears to vary 
according to asanas and room temperature. VO2max estimates are complicated by the aerobic 
fitness and sex of yoga participants, which ranged from an average of 33 to 35 ml/kg/min (7, 9) 
to 42 ml/kg/min (6) in female practitioners and 47 m/kg/min in male participants (9). 
Metabolic Cost of Yoga Relative to Walking. In addition to evaluating the energy cost 
and intensity of yoga, four studies simultaneously compared metabolic cost of yoga practice to 
that of walking at 2.0 (14), 2.9 (26), 3.0 (14), 3.5 (7) and 4.0 mph (9). As stated in the ACSM 
guidelines, an adult walking at 3 mph on a flat, hard surface is expected to expend about 3.3 
METs (16). The METs and intensity as percentage of HRmax or VO2max if available are 
summarized in Table 3. In general, walking at 3 mph produced a similar MET response 
compared to yoga (14), whereas walking at a faster velocity had a higher metabolic cost (7, 9).  
Rate of Perceived Exertion. Only one study (9) reported the rate of perceived exertion 
(RPE) or effort during yoga practice. The RPE according to the Borg scale, which ranges from a 
value of 6 at rest to 20 at maximal effort, was 14.8±1.8 METS for the aforementioned practice of 
standing Hatha asanas. This was significantly higher than the average RPE of 12.5±1.5 for 
treadmill walking at 4 MPH for the same subjects, despite the higher MET values elicited for 
walking (5.4 METs) vs. yoga practice (4.1 METs). 
Energy Cost of Pranayama. Five studies (22, 26, 33, 36, 38) evaluated the metabolic 
cost of pranayamas or the controlled and specific breathing patterns/movements commonly 
practiced in yoga using a ventilated hood (38) , cart with face mask or mouthpiece (26, 33, 36) or 
full-room calorimeter (22). The metabolic cost of pranayamas is summarized in Figure 3. The

MET values of the majority of pranayamas was slightly above rest (MET =1.0) averaging 
1.3±0.3 with the exception of Yoga Mudra, Kaki Mudra, high frequency breathing and standing 
deep breathing which had METs just above 1.5. The metabolic cost of Kapalbhati breathing was 
also slightly higher but the MET value varied between studies (33, 38). Pranayama did not elicit 
a significant change in heart rate response in the one study that simultaneously evaluated heart 
rate (26) but some such as kapalbhati did elevate ventilation above restful breath (33). High 
frequency yogic breathing was found to increase energy expenditure from carbohydrate whereas 
breath awareness decreased energy expenditure from fat compared to rest, but the respiratory 
exchange ratio unfortunately was not reported.  
 
DISCUSSION 
This work is the first to comprehensively review the published literature evaluating the 
energy cost and intensity of yoga practice, including individual asanas (poses/postures) and 
pranayamas (breathing exercises). Based on the ACSM and AHA classification system (2, 10, 
12, 16), the intensity of yoga asanas and of full yoga practice ranged from light-aerobic (less than 
3 METS) to moderate- (3 to 6 METS) to vigorous-aerobic (>6 METS) with the majority 
classified as light-intensity. The asanas and sequences of asanas that elicited MET intensities in 
the moderate-intensity aerobic range included Surya Namaskar (sun salutations) and specific 
standing and balancing postures including Tuladandasana (balancing stick) and Dandayamana 
Dhanurasana (standing bow).  This highlights that yoga is not typically practiced at an intensity 
that meets the ACSM/AHA recommendations for moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (12, 16), 
and is on average less aerobically intense than brisk walking.  In accordance with the guidelines, 
however, it further highlights that the practice of sequences of asanas with MET intensities

above 3 METs (i.e., for ~10 min or longer) can be accumulated throughout the day and count 
towards daily (or weekly) recommendations for moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic activity 
(16).  
Energy Cost and Intensity of Yoga Practice. Despite a general classification as a light-
intensity exercise modality, the findings from this systematic review suggest that the energy cost 
and MET intensity of a yoga session can be altered according to the asanas practiced, and the 
velocity of flow between asanas (i.e., jump vs. slow controlled transitions). Devotion of 
significant time to Surya Namaskar (7, 23, 34) and the inclusion of standing and balancing poses 
that involve isometric contractions with jump transitions between asanas (9) would be expected 
to increase overall energy cost and intensity of a yoga session (23). Alternatively, the inclusion 
of more seated versus standing poses with a slower flow through asanas would be expected to 
decrease energy cost and intensity. Quite surprisingly, this review did not find that 
environmental (or room) temperature had much effect on energy cost.  Despite purported claims 
that a Bikram yoga session expends up to 1000 kcal in 90-minutes, the MET values of Bikram 
yoga (26), performed in hot room  with 40% relative humidity, were within the same range as 
yoga practiced at room temperature.  It could be argued, however, that differences might be 
found if the same practitioners had performed the same set of asanas in both a hot and more 
ambient environment.  Bikram for example does not incorporate Surya Namaskar or flow 
transitions but instead transitions from static asana to static asana, which may require less energy 
than other styles with continuous flow through Surya Namaskar and other asanas.   
The variability of MET intensities for Surya Namaskar (sun salutations), which ranged 
from 2.9 METs (light-intensity) (14) to 7.4 METs (vigorous-intensity), is intriguing. Flow

breath involves the majority of joints and muscles and both static stretching and dynamic 
muscular exercise components (34). The sequence is said to be taught to Indian children at young 
age and is believed to promote cardiorespiratory fitness (23). Interestingly, higher MET 
intensities (7.4 METs) were observed by Mody (23) who studied five Indian men and women 
who had trained in Surya Namaskar for at least two years (23).  Four rounds of Surya Namaskar 
were performed at a pace of three minutes per round. Although sufficient detail on sequence 
execution was not described, to achieve such high MET intensities the experienced practitioners 
most likely incorporated rapid stepping (or jumping) between asanas and an upward and/or 
downward push-up in Uttihita Chaturanga Dandasana, i.e., flow from plank pose to Bujangasana 
(cobra pose) and back to plank before moving into Adho Mukha Svasana (down-dog).  In 
agreement, a MET intensity of 6.4 was achieved in the author’s laboratory using Mody’s 
description of Surya Namaskar, transition jumps and full pushups (Larson-Meyer, unpublished 
data).  In contrast, MET intensities in the moderate-intensity range were observed by both Sinha 
et al (34) and Clay et al (7) in 21 newly-trained male practitioners (recently completing three-
months of intense training) and 26 semi-experienced female practitioners  (minimum of one 
month of yoga attendance), respectively. The lower MET intensities of Higgins and colleagues 
(14) were  observed in 18 woman and 2 men who performed 28 minutes of Surya Namaskar as 
part of a 56-min beginning-level Ashtanga session. Unfortunately, sufficient information on the 
Surya Namaskar flow was also not provided (7, 14, 34) but illustrations in the manuscripts of 
Sinha (34) matched that of  Mody (23) suggesting that the most common variation (Sun 
salutations A) was employed in both studies. Taken together these findings highlight that Surya 
Namaskar can be practiced in such a way to achieve an aerobically intense effort but also slowed 
to result in a light- to moderate-intensity effort.

 Influence of Practitioner Experience. It is not yet established whether practitioner 
experience impacts the metabolic cost of yoga practice, as it does with other types of exercise 
(1). One could argue on one hand that with consistent practice yoga participants would learn to 
more fully express a pose which would in turn result in engagement of more muscle fibers/ 
muscle groups, more forceful contractions of engaged muscles and deeper movement into each 
pose.  Full expression of many asanas, for example, requires near-maximal contraction of several 
muscle groups, including the abdominals and back, and an increased range of motion to lift 
higher or sink deeper into each asana. One could also argue on the other hand that experienced 
practitioners may have increased flexibility which could result in reduced passive torque in 
muscle tissue, reduced resistance to joint movement, and in turn both increased energy efficiency 
and lowered energy cost (7).  Unfortunately, this  review found only two studies that directly 
compared the energy cost of yoga practiced by experienced versus novice practitioners (26, 38), 
one evaluating Bikram practice (26) and the other focused on pranayamas. In the former, the 
energy cost of a 90-minute Bikram yoga session was 27% higher in experienced compared to 
novice practitioners (4.7±0.8 vs. 3.7±0.5 kcal/kg). Experienced practitioners also had a 67% 
greater elevation in core temperature than novice practitioners despite an 83% higher sweat 
losses alluding to increased work output in experienced practitioners. The pranayama study was 
in agreement (38). Experienced practitioners were able to substantially increased oxygen cost 
during breathing exercises compared to novice practitioners despite a lower oxygen cost at rest. 
Additional research in this area is certainly needed to help establish how experience influences 
the energy cost of yoga practice.  
Cardiorespiratory Indicators of Yoga Intensity. This review further supports that 
evaluation of exercise intensity using %HRmax, %VO2max and %HRR—more commonly used for

individual exercise prescription (12) —yields results similar to MET intensity. Using these 
criteria, the majority of studies also found that yoga does not meet the ACSM criteria for 
moderate-intensity aerobic activity defined as eliciting a heart rate in the range 64 to 76 %HRmax 
or an oxygen cost between 46 and 63 %VO2max. The exceptions include Surya Namaskar (7, 23, 
34), standing Iyengar asana practice with jumps between poses (9) and Bikram practice (26). 
These practices, except the Bikram session, increased MET values to within the moderate-
intensity range.  Use of absolute or relative (%HRmax) heart rate, however, may not be an overall 
valid indicator of exercise intensity during yoga. Several studies found that heart rate was 
disproportionally higher than the corresponding oxygen (energy) cost or MET intensity during 
both Hatha (7, 9) and Bikram (26) yoga. For instance, Clay et al (7) found that a 30-min session 
at 2.17 METs (15% of VO2R) elicited an average heart rate response of 67% %HRmax which is 
considerably higher than expected (see Table 1)(12). Heart rate was also 28 bpm higher during 
yoga compared to treadmill walking (133 vs. 105 bpm) at a higher MET value (3.5 mph, 4.6 
METs). Di Carlo et al (9) observed that standing Hatha yoga induced higher heart rate and blood 
pressure responses (71% HRmax), than brisk walking at 4.0 MPH at a higher MET intensity of 5.4 
METs (62% HRmax). Disproportionally higher heart rates during yoga which integrates arm 
movements and forceful isometric contractions, however, are expected. These  exercise activities 
alter the hemodynamic and neural responses and elicit a greater heart rate response than 
exercises involving leg muscles and dynamic contractions at similar oxygen cost (20). Higher 
heart rates are also expected during yoga practiced in a hot and/or humid environment due to the 
reactionary shift in blood flow towards the skin, in attempt to maintain thermal homeostasis, 
which reduces stroke volume and increases heart rate to maintain cardiac output (20). Similarly, 
RPE using the Borg scale may also not be a valid indicator of intensity during yoga. The one

study that evaluated RPE found that standing Hatha yoga  at 4.1 METs elicited an 18% higher 
RPE than treadmill walking at 5.4 METs (RPE=14.8 ±1.8 verses 12.5 ±1.5) (9). 
Quality of Measurement of Energy Expenditure.  All studies included in this review 
used indirect calorimetry to measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production to 
thereby calculate the energy cost of yoga. Gases were collected using a variety of apparatuses 
that included a ventilated hood (during pranayamas) (38), mouthpiece and nose clips (26, 32), or 
face mask (13, 23, 30, 31, 33), or employed a full-room respiratory chamber (14, 22).  In the one 
study that evaluated testing reproducibility, the test-retest reliability of the energy cost of yoga 
measured in the respiratory chamber was sufficiently consistent with an interclass coefficient of 
0.97 (14). Although it is tempting to speculate that use of the mouthpiece or mask might induce 
restraints on a yoga practice this review found no indication that the gas collection apparatus 
impacted energy cost.  Respiratory chambers have the advantage of allowing freedom of 
movement without restraints of headgear, however they are expensive and metabolic carts have 
been used most commonly to measure the energy cost and MET intensity of most physical 
activities (1). For example, the energy costs of videotaped yoga sessions averaged 0.63 
kcal/kg/min using a metabolic cart (7) and 0.58 kcal/kg/min when measured inside a respiratory 
chamber (14). The quality of data collected, however, was difficult to systematically critique due 
to lack of reported methodological detail. Therefore this review had to assume that included 
studies followed standardized procedures including calibration of gas and volume analyzers, 
enforced sufficient control of participant’s intake and exercise before testing, and ensured a 
steady state in oxygen consumption even during the continuous flow through various asanas (7, 
14, 23, 27). If oxygen steady state was not achieved, which typically takes at least a minute with 
continuous exercise, energy cost would be underestimated. To ensure collection of reliable and

accurate metabolic data, future studies should control diet, caffeine, fluid consumption, exercise, 
sleep and medications of study participants at least 24-hours before measurement.  
The Benefits of Yoga. Placing the findings of the current review into a larger discussion 
of yoga’s potential benefits requires consideration of both the benefits gained from physical 
activity of lower cardiovascular intensity and yoga’s potential to improve strength and balance, 
impact the nervous system and help control stress (4). The ACSM acknowledges that exercise at 
a lower intensity reduces sedentary behavior and may provide health benefits for older and 
unconditioned individuals (2, 12, 16). Exercise below the moderate-intensity threshold (12), 
including the practice of yoga and pranayama (19, 25, 39), have also been shown to improve 
metabolic markers of chronic disease (i.e.,  insulin resistance, blood pressure and lipid profiles) 
without the corresponding improvements in VO2max. Additionally, yoga offers an alternative for 
individuals who cannot engage in traditional forms of physical activity or who prefer light- over 
more intense aerobic exercise. Yoga is perceived to be a gentler form of exercise and may be a 
more sustainable means of daily practice for individuals with joint problems, rheumatoid arthritis 
(17) or back pain (24).  A recent review found that yoga was superior to other forms of exercise 
for improving self-reported health status, aerobic fitness and muscular strength in older adults 
(28). For instance, eight weeks of yoga participation improved treadmill walking time to fatigue, 
by three minutes (37). Yoga has also been found to benefit those who are more aerobically fit. A 
study of distance runners found a small but significant improvement in running performance 
after a single yoga session (11). Similarly, 24 sessions of yoga performed over 8 weeks led to 
improved balance, leg strength and leg muscle control in young athletes (15). Many of these 
benefits may be linked to yoga’s ability to increase strength, balance and flexibility, calm the 
mind and reduce stress (4). The ACSM position statement for exercise prescription emphasizes

that multifaceted physical activities that involve combinations of neuromotor exercise, resistance 
exercise, and flexibility exercise, which includes yoga,  have numerous benefits beyond 
cardiovascular fitness (12). Results of this study suggest that certain aspects of yoga practice, 
particularly the more intense asanas, can count towards the weekly amount of physical activity 
suggested by the ACSM guidelines (16).  
Study Limitations. Currently published studies are somewhat limited in that they were 
conducted mostly in fairly experienced Indian men (23, 30-33, 35, 36) or women practicing in 
U.S. metropolitan cities (7, 14, 27) who were relatively young, apparently healthy and of normal 
weight. The exception was for the Wii yoga studies that included Japanese and English 
adolescents and older individuals (13, 22).  Results are therefore not generalizable to individuals 
with obesity or adverse health conditions, the elderly or young children. The MET intensities 
included in this review are also only average summaries from included studies which rarely 
reported the full range of oxygen and MET intensities. Consequently, the range of energy cost 
and MET intensities for yoga asanas, pranayama or full yoga sessions are not available. 
Regardless, the review provides information for exercise professionals, yoga instructors, health 
care providers and yoga practitioners considering practicing yoga as part of physical activity-
related goals. It also provides a summary of MET values that may be useful for future MET 
tables (1) and exercise guidelines. Future studies are needed to better understand how experience 
and individual variability influence the energy cost and intensity of yoga.
