Activation of brown adipose tissue-mediated thermogenesis is a strategy for tackling obesity
and promoting metabolic health. BMP8b is secreted by brown/beige adipocytes and
enhances energy dissipation. Here we show that adipocyte-secreted BMP8b contributes to
adrenergic-induced remodeling of the neuro-vascular network in adipose tissue (AT).
Overexpression of bmp8b in AT enhances browning of the subcutaneous depot and maximal
thermogenic capacity. Moreover, BMP8b-induced browning, increased sympathetic inner-
vation and vascularization of AT were maintained at 28 °C, a condition of low adrenergic
output. This reinforces the local trophic effect of BMP8b. Innervation and vascular remodeling
effects required BMP8b signaling through the adipocytes to 1) secrete neuregulin-4 (NRG4),
which promotes sympathetic axon growth and branching in vitro, and 2) induce a pro-
angiogenic transcriptional and secretory profile that promotes vascular sprouting. Thus,
BMP8b and NRG4 can be considered as interconnected regulators of neuro-vascular
remodeling in AT and are potential therapeutic targets in obesity.

old-induced activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT)
enables energy dissipation in the form of heat through
uncoupling of fatty acid oxidation from adenosine tri-
phosphate production1. In humans, thermogenically active BAT
(e.g., para-aortic and cervical2,3) is detectable in lean individuals,
indicating that promoting BAT-induced thermogenesis in obese
humans may represent a safe therapeutic strategy to improve
their metabolic health. Beige cells, another specialized cell type
present in white adipose tissue (WAT), fundamentally share
similar thermogenic mechanisms but are developmentally and
functionally distinct from classical BAT cells4. These differences
between classic brown and beige cells open the opportunity for
alternative therapeutic opportunities to increase their thermo-
genic capacity by specific activators.
BAT activity/expansion and beige cell recruitment are regu-
lated by cold-mediated activation of the sympathetic nervous
system (SNS) and its chemical messenger norepinephrine (NE)
5. In addition, optimal activation and maintenance of BAT and
beige adipocytes require the coordinated expansion of ancillary
sympathetic nervous and vascular networks. Synchronization
between sympathetic tone input, thermogenic demands and
adipose tissue (AT) remodeling is likely to involve the fine-
tuned interplay of other AT cellular components (i.e., immune,
endothelial and adipocyte cells), whose interaction and activity
should not be assumed to be directly dependent on the SNS
activity6,7. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that BAT
also fulfils a secretory role releasing factors such as fibroblast
growth factor 21 (FGF21), neuregulin-4 (NRG4), bone mor-
phogenetic proteins (BMPs) and angiogenic factors8 that con-
tribute to autocrine, paracrine and endocrine functions and
may be required for intercellular coordination and tissue
remodeling.
Several studies have highlighted the importance of vascular
remodeling in activation/maintenance of browning and BAT
thermogenic
response.
Beige
cell
recruitment
in
WAT is
associated with increased vascularization6,9 and, indeed, beige
and
brown
adipocytes
might
be
derived
from
vascular
precursors10,11.
Additionally,
pro-angiogenic
factor
over-
expression, e.g., vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF),
increases vascular density and expression of thermogenic genes in
both BAT and WAT. Conversely, neutralization of VEGF reduces
BAT activity coupled to decreased vascular density, highlighting
the interdependence of matched thermogenesis and angiogen-
esis12–14. The mechanisms driving cold-induced remodeling of
the neural network are not fully understood. NRG4 is a novel
“batokine” that may contribute to the adipocyte-neuronal cross-
talk by promoting neurite outgrowth15. This may complement
the suggested effects of NRG4 controlling de novo liver lipid
synthesis in liver and preventing diet-induced insulin resistance
and hepatic steatosis16. Taken together, this supports the
importance of the neuro-vascular network regulating thermo-
genesis, and also the requirement that sophisticated mechanisms
exist to spatially and temporally titrate both the expansion of the
vascular network and sympathetic innervation to adjust SNS
input to meet thermogenic demands10,11.
BMP8b is the only BMP predominantly expressed in mature
brown adipocytes and uniquely sensitizes brown adipocytes to
adrenergic input, amplifying their thermogenic response17,18. Its
physiological relevance is attested by the reduced thermogenic
response and impairment in diet- and cold-induced thermogen-
esis observed in Bmp8b–/– mice17.
In our study, we focus on the BMP8b peripheral effects to
understand how BMP8b potentiates the adrenergically mediated
thermogenic response. We used transgenic mice in which bmp8b
is overexpressed in AT in combination with cellular models to
identify a cell-autonomous peripheral role of BMP8b that
optimizes the thermogenic response by promoting remodeling of
the neuro-vascular networks in BAT and WAT.
Results
Bmp8b overexpression enhances AT browning and thermo-
genesis. We generated a transgenic mouse in which expression of
the murine Bmp8b gene is under control of the adipocyte-specific
apolipoprotein 2 (Fabp4) promoter19,20 (Bmp8b transgenic (TG)
mice). Bmp8b gene expression in Bmp8b TG mice was enhanced
in BAT, subcutaneous (ScW) and gonadal WAT (GnW) with no
induced or negligible expression in the liver and hypothalamus
(Supplementary figure 1a, b). No major compensatory change of
other AT-related members of the BMP family were observed
(Supplementary Figure 1c). Bmp8b overexpression in AT was
expected to inform about the role of increased bmp8b levels in
response to cold exposure (1 week, 5 °C) in ScW (Supplementary
figure 1d).
Adult Bmp8b TG mice exhibited increased energy expenditure
(EE) in response to NE injection compared to wild-type (WT)
littermates, consistent with greater thermogenic capacity (Fig. 1a).
This was a cell-autonomous effect as ScW adipocytes from adult
TG mice also displayed an increased β-adrenergic-stimulated
lipolysis response compared to WTs (Supplementary figure 2a).
WT and Bmp8b TG mice fed chow diet and housed at 21 °C did
not show body weight and food intake differences (Supplemen-
tary figure 2b, c). However, after 5 months of high-fat diet (HFD),
the Bmp8b TG mice tended to be leaner than the WTs (Fig. 1b, c).
At that stage, we did not observe a significant decrease in basal
glycemia or improved insulin sensitivity and basal EE remained
similar (Supplementary figure 2d-f).
Characterization of ScW thermogenic gene expression from
20-week-old chow-fed Bmp8b TG mice only showed increased
Pgc1α gene expression (Supplementary figure 2g) compared to
WTs. However, gene expression analysis in post-weaning 5-week-
old Bmp8b TG mice revealed a broad up-regulation in ScW of
thermogenic genes (Ucp-1 and Pdrm16) and genes related to fatty
acid oxidation (Cpt1b) (Fig. 1d). This pro-thermogenic molecular
phenotype in ScW contrasted with unaltered expression of
thermogenic genes in BAT and GnW from both post-weaning
and adult Bmp8b TG mice (Supplementary figure 2h-j). UCP1
protein levels were detectable in ScW of most Bmp8b TG mice in
basal conditions compared to WT 5-week-old animals (Supple-
mentary figure 2k), whereas UCP1 protein levels in BAT from
Bmp8b TG BAT were similar to WT mice. Accordingly, ScW
from Bmp8b TG showed decreased adipocyte area (Supplemen-
tary figure 2l) and greater percentage of multilocular adipocytes
compared to WTs (Fig. 1e, f). As in adult mice, post-weaning
Bmp8b TG mice were similar in body weight, body composition
and basal EE to WTs (Supplementary Fig. 2m-o). However, when
adrenergically stimulated, mice had increased maximal thermo-
genic capacity compared to WTs, as indicated by the greater EE
of Bmp8b TG mice following NE injection (Fig. 1g).
Central injection of BMP8b has been shown to induce
browning in the ScW through activation of the hypothalamic
ventromedial nucleus. Consequently, we investigated if over-
activated SNS in bmp8b TG mice was responsible for the
browning and thermogenic phenotype. Baseline serum free fatty
acid levels were similar in WTs and Bmp8b TGs (Supplementary
Figure 3a). Despite a slight increase in the GnW, no differences in
noradrenaline levels between 12-week-old bmp8b WT and TG
mice were observed neither in the serum nor skeletal muscle and
other fat depots, in particular the ScW, in which the thermogenic
activation and neuro-vascular remodeling was the most potent
(Fig. 1h). Finally, no significant differences were observed in basal
sympathetic tone to epididymal WAT or BAT, or in BAT

 sympathetic nerve activation evoked by cooling (Supplementary
Figure 3b, c). However, to assess the effects of BMP8b in a state
where sympathetic tone is minimized, adult Bmp8b TG mice were
switched to 28 °C prior being given HFD. Under these conditions,
Bmp8b TG mice lost the leaner phenotype (decreased fat mass)
observed when given a HFD at ambient temperature, suggesting
that these effects might be NE mediated (Supplementary
Figure 3d, e). However, despite the low adrenergic output, bmp8b
overexpression was sufficient to maintain the beige cell recruit-
ment and up-regulation of thermogenic genes ucp1, prdm16, dio2,
pparα and pgc1α in the ScW compared to WT mice. No
differences
were
observed
in
BAT
and
GnW
(Fig.
1i,
Supplementary Figure 3f-i). Likewise, despite being raised at 28
°C and lacking adrenergic priming, both basal and NE-stimulated
EE were still significantly higher in post-weaning and adult
Bmp8b TG mice compared to the WTs (Fig. 1j, Supplementary
Figure 3j). Overall, our results indicate that the effects of BMP8b
might not simply reflect increased SNS tone, but an enhanced
thermogenesis resulting from a greater functionality of beige fat
(i.e., beige cells and supportive networks).
BMP8b modulates BAT and ScW sympathetic innervation
in vivo. As well as increasing sympathetic tone to BAT and ScW,
chronic cold exposure also triggers sympathetic innervation7.

 Interestingly, some BMPs (e.g., 4 and 7) regulate nervous system
development and promote in vitro dendritogenesis21,22. To
determine whether BMP8b affected the level of AT sympathetic
innervation in vivo, we stained for sympathetic fibers sections of
BAT and ScW in Bmp8b TG, Bmp8b–/– and WT littermates
(Fig. 2a, c). Quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive
staining23,24 in sections of 5-week-old mice revealed significantly
increased nerve density in both BAT and ScW of Bmp8b TG mice
compared with WT mice and significantly decreased nerve den-
sity in both BAT and ScW of Bmp8b–/– mice compared with
Bmp8b+/+ mice (Fig. 2b, d). Increased TH staining was observed
in areas of white and beige adipocytes of Bmp8b TG mice while
significant decreases were observed in both these areas of
Bmp8b–/– mice compared to WTs (Supplementary Figure 4a, b).
Of relevance, BMP8b overexpression in mice born and housed at
28 °C still exhibited an increased innervation compared to WTs,
supporting a plausible local neurotrophic role for BMP8b in the
ScW (Fig. 2e, f).
Cold-induced
increased
sympathetic
innervation
involves
nerve fiber branching and extension of preexisting neurons in
BAT and ScW7. To determine if BMP8b influenced growth and
branching of sympathetic axons we cultured primary sympathetic
neurons (superior cervical ganglion (SCG)) with either BMP8b or
nerve growth factor (NGF). Our finding that BMP8b did not
enhance sympathetic axon growth in vitro, either in the presence
or absence of NGF (Fig. 2g, h), raised the possibility that the effect
of BMP8b on innervation was mediated by another factor.
Bmp8b overexpression increased AT sympathetic innervation.
We then measured BAT and ScW from Bmp8b TG, Bmp8b–/–
and WT mice gene expression of sympathetic neurons growth
regulators16,21,25,26. Among them, only Nrg4 was significantly up-
regulated in both BAT and ScW of Bmp8b TG mice (Fig. 3a, b)
and down-regulated in the BAT of Bmp8b–/– mice, compared to
WT littermates. However, Nrg4 remained unchanged in the GnW
from Bmp8b TG mice (Supplementary Figure 4c-e). Since NRG4
levels in serum remained unchanged in Bmp8b TG and Bmp8b–/–
mice compared to their respective WTs, we posited a potential
local action within AT (Supplementary Figure 4f, g). Of relevance,
increased Nrg4 expression in Bmp8b TG mice was maintained in
the ScW of mice born and housed at 28 °C (Fig. 3c).
As previously described15,16, we verified that Nrg4 was mainly
expressed by the adipocyte fraction of BAT and ScW (Supple-
mentary Figure 4h) and significantly induced in differentiated
brown adipocytes following BMP8 treatment (Fig. 3d). This was a
cell-autonomous effect since NRG4 was still over-produced by
mature brown and white adipocytes isolated from AT of adult
Bmp8b TG mice compared to adipocytes of WTs (Fig. 3e).
Conversely, NRG4 secretion from mature brown adipocytes was
decreased in adult Bmp8b–/– mice (Fig. 3f).
The two murine protein-coding NRG4 isoforms require
extracellular proteolytic cleavage to release the mature secreted
form. Given that BACE1, AdAM10/17/19 have been shown to
cleave NRG127,28, we initially considered these matrix metallo-
proteinases as candidate proteases for NRG4 cleavage. We found
that only Adam10 messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased in
both BMP8-treated and Bmp8b TG brown adipocytes compared
to WTs (Supplementary Figure 4i, j). Pre-treatment of primary
brown and white adipocytes with Galardin, a protease inhibitor,
reduced
NRG4
secretion
into
the
media
(Supplementary
Figure 4k). These results support that BMP8b regulates NRG4
function at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
We then determined whether NRG4 influenced the growth and
branching of sympathetic SCG neurons by treating them with
either NRG4 or NGF. Like NGF, NRG4 promoted axon growth
and branching (Fig. 4a, b). At the highest concentration used,
NRG4 promoted branching as effectively as the maximally
effective concentration of NGF and acted over a similar
developmental time course as NGF. NRG4 was not as potent in
promoting axon growth as NGF, and exerted its greatest effect at
P0, whereas the axon growth-promoting effect of NGF plateaued
at E16 (Fig. 4b). The concentration of NRG4 required to exert
these effects was two orders of magnitude higher than the
maximally effective concentration of NGF (Fig. 4c). There was
no additive effect of NRG4 and NGF in combination (Fig. 4d),
suggesting that these factors affect overlapping populations
of SGC neurons. These results suggest that NRG4 promotes
the growth and branching of sympathetic axons during the
period when axons are growing and ramifying in their target
tissues.
AT BMP8b overexpression induced vascular remodeling. Cold-
induced recruitment of BAT requires a parallel expansion of the
vascular network to perfuse the new brown adipocytes. BAT and
ScW sections labeled revealed a significant increase in the vas-
cular network (isolectin B4) associated with a higher number of
vessels per adipocyte (ratio Isolectin B4/caveolin-1) in post-
weaning Bmp8b TG mice, compared to WTs (Fig. 5a–c, Supple-
mentary Figure 5a). Moreover, pericyte coverage (ratio NG2
+/CD31+) was enhanced in Bmp8b TG mice indicating the
enhanced functionality and stabilization of vascular networks in
young Bmp8b TG mice29. No differences in vascularization net-
work were observed in GnW (Supplementary Figure 5b-d). At the
transcriptional level, angiogenesis-related factors were differen-
tially up-regulated depending on the fat depot. Accordingly,

In support of a local regulatory effect, the ScW and BAT hyper-
vascularization in Bmp8b TG mice was preserved when mice were

 CD45−, CD31−, CD34+, PDGFRα+32) in Bmp8b TG mice were
similar to WTs (Supplementary Figure 6). These results indicate
that the beige adipocyte recruitment in the ScW from Bmp8b TG
mice likely resulted from increased brown adipogenesis or
adipocyte transdifferentiation rather than increased recruitment
of progenitors. Chronic treatment with BMP8 during adipogen-
esis directly increased thermogenic and brown marker expression
in brown (C57 brown cells) and to a lesser extent in white
adipocytes (3T3-L1 cells). Some of these thermogenic genes were
also
induced
following
acute
(24 h)

treatment
on
differentiated
brown
and
white

(Supplementary
Figure 7a-d).
BMP8b pro-angiogenic effect requires adipocyte activation. To
ascertain whether BMP8b promoted angiogenesis directly, we
used the in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay33 and tested on a
mouse cardiac endothelial cell whether recombinant BMP8b
increased vascular tube formation. However, after 6 h of treat-
ment with BMP8b, angiogenesis was suppressed (Fig. 6a), an
effect unrelated to toxicity (Supplementary Figure 8a). This raised
the possibility that, as for innervation, BMP8b might exert its
pro-angiogenic effect indirectly by simulating the production of a
pro-angiogenic factor(s). Consistently, we found that isolated
mature ScW adipocytes of Bmp8b TG mice produced significantly
higher VEGF level compared to those from WT mice (Fig. 6b).
The pro-angiogenic role of mature white adipocytes was also
validated in vitro by showing that BMP8 induced Vegf expression
in differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 6c) and that conditioned media
from adipocytes pre-treated with BMP8 enhanced tube formation
in Matrigel (Supplementary Figure 8b). Importantly, circulating
VEGF levels were not altered in Bmp8b TG mice (Fig. 6d),
indicating a predominantly local effect of BMP8-induced VEGF
production in the vascular remodeling of the ScW. Accordingly,
VEGF release from ScW explants was increased by BMP8 treat-
ment (Supplementary Figure 8c). Using an angiogenesis array
approach to characterize the pro-angiogenic effect of BMP8b, we
found that in addition to VEGF and PlGF2, BMP8 also increased
(>1.3) the release of pro-angiogenic molecules such as CCN3,
Proliferin, HGF and IGFBP3 from brown adipocytes (Supple-
mentary Figure 8d, e).
Pro-angiogenic capacity of ScW explants from Bmp8b TG mice
was validated using a similar angiogenesis array that showed
higher levels of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF, PlGF2) and
decreased levels of anti-angiogenic factors (e.g., IP10, endostatin)
compared to WTs (Fig. 6e, f, Supplementary Figure 8f). These
results indicate that BMP8b might increase the balance between
pro- and anti-angiogenic processes. We next evaluated the
capacity of ScW explants for vascular sprouting on Matrigel,
assessing angiogenesis in an environment composed of multiple
cell types, maintaining the endothelial cell (EC)/adipocyte cross-
talk34. Vascular sprouting was increased in ScW explants from
Bmp8b TG mice compared to WT independently of the presence
of NE (Fig. 6g). The dependency on BMP signaling was
confirmed as treatment of Bmp8b TG ScW explants with the
BMP8b receptor Alk7 antagonist SB43154217 completely blocked
vascular sprouting (Fig. 6h). Furthermore, chronic treatment of
ScW explants in Matrigel with recombinant BMP8 increased
sprouting capacity in a similar way than in response to NE,
whereas sprouting was reversed in the presence of SB431542
(Fig. 6i). Taken together, these results support an autocrine role
for BMP8b regulating vascular remodeling in ScW by increasing
the pro-angiogenic activity of the adipocytes.
Integration of angiogenic and innervation in BMP8b TG mice.
To identify BMP8b downstream effectors and points of cross-talk
between signaling pathways regulating neuro-vascular remodel-
ing, we performed a phosphoproteomics-based study using a
phospho-antibody microarray on brown differentiated adipocytes
stimulated with BMP8 and/or NE. We used a (i) candidate-based
approach (i.e., biological process terms determined in Gene
Ontology (GO)35 relevant for tissue remodeling: angiogenesis; cell
cycle and survival, inflammation, lipid metabolism and thermo-
genic activity and neurogenesis), (ii) pathway enrichment analysis
using the ”piano” R package36 (Supplementary Figure 9a, b,
Supplementary Data 1-4, Supplementary Software). We found 31
and 25 proteins that were respectively significantly up- or down-
regulated by the different treatments (Fig. 7a, b). Venn diagrams
confirmed the expected role of SMADs in BMP8b signaling;
SMAD 1 and 3 being activated only by BMP8 stimulation.
Notably, activation of AKT1-, MAP2K1- and TP53-dependent
pathways, involved in regulation of neurogenesis and cell cycle/
survival, appeared to be NE dependent. We also observed that
phosphosites up-regulated by BMP8 were mainly stimulatory.
Surprisingly, combined treatment of NE+BMP8 led to down-
regulation of 7 proteins, among them HDAC5 and EEF2 (neu-
rogenesis) and IRS1, PPARG (lipid metabolism and thermogen-
esis), suggesting a potential feedback regulation preventing
excessive stimulation. BMP8 and NE conditions independently
phosphorylated and activated 10 protein candidates and only
shared one, showing that the role of BMP8b amplifying NE
response might not be cumulative to NE but independent, acti-
vating additional pathways. Interestingly, BMP8 specifically up-
regulated proteins directly associated (named as “self”) with
thermogenesis
(ATF2,
BRAAF,
MAPK14),
neurogenesis
(BRAAF, MEF2A), angiogenesis (MAPK14) and cell survival
(ATF2, ESR1, PDPK1) (Fig. 7c). Among the 10 proteins up-
regulated by BMP8, some were related to other pathways. For
instance, ATF2 and MEF2A were also associated with angio-
genesis and thermogenesis because their upstream kinases were
described to regulate or be regulated by these pathways. Similarly,
ESR1 was also related to thermogenesis and neurogenesis because
the functions assigned to its downstream proteins were regulated
by the phosphorylation events.
We then integrated these phosphoproteomics data with the
gene expression profile of the BAT from Bmp8b TG mice, to
investigate by which signaling pathways BMP8b could regulate
neuro-angiogenic factors, notably vegf and nrg4 expression. We
performed a network analysis in which we collected the

 transcription factors (TFs) regulating the expression of all the
genes we analyzed in the BAT from 5 weeks-old Bmp8b TG mice
and calculated the distances in this network from each of the
proteins measured on the phosphoassay to all TFs. We identified
a top list of signaling proteins with phosphorylation state affected
by BMP8 showing close network distance to the TFs regulating
vegf and nrg4 (Fig. 8a, b). At vegfa, we also identified 4 TFs,
SMAD2, SMAD1, ESR1 and SMAD3, showing larger than 1.5-
fold increase in their phosphorylation upon BMP8 treatment and
directly regulating vegfa transcription (Fig. 8c). Regarding nrg4
signaling, SMAD2 and STAT1 showed increased phosphorylation
upon BMP8 treatment constituting as a potential transcriptional
regulator of nrg4 expression. Taken together, these results
validated the role for BMP8b, independent of NE, in brown
adipocytes mediating the remodeling of the neuro-vascular
networks in BAT and beige tissues. Moreover, these data also
highlighted new molecular candidates and signaling pathways
driving brown thermogenesis and tissue remodeling.
We next investigated whether neurogenic, thermogenic and
angiogenic

 between two close time point, 4-week-old and 5-week-old mice
(Supplementary Figure 10). Our results did not show clear
temporal differences in the differential regulation of thermogenic,
angiogenic and neurogenic factors, which were all mostly up-
regulated at 4-week-old in BAT and ScW. These results support
the tight co-expression
and co-regulation of thermogenic,
angiogenic and neurogenic genes.
Regarding the influence of the thermogenic state, we observed
that ucp-1 was massively up-regulated in ScW from 4- and 5-
week-old bmp8b TG mice compared to WT. This raised the
possibility that neuro-vascularization observed in TG required
UCP1-dependent thermogenic metabolism in adipose tissues,
which subsequently could promote innervation and angiogenesis.
Therefore, we exploited a dataset performed in UCP1-deficient

Keipert
et
al.37
(GSE99412) (Supplementary Figure 11 a-c) and investigated the
UCP1 dependence of the regulation of bmp8b and neurogenic/
angiogenic factors. In this study, Keipert et al.37 demonstrated
that cold-induced browning of the ScW was still functional in
ucp-1–/– mice37. We observed that in addition to thermogenic
factors, both bmp8b and nrg4 were up-regulated (Supplementary
Figure 11d). Moreover, despite vegf not being significantly
affected, we observed a large enrichment of pro-angiogenic
molecules in the top 30 significantly up- and down-regulated
genes (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p < 0.05) (Supplemen-
tary Figure 11e). These results are compatible with cold-induced
BMP8b triggering adipose neurogenesis and angiogenesis inde-
pendently from UCP-dependent mechanisms.
Unlike WAT innervation, vascularization in Bmp8b–/– and
Bmp8b TG mice did not mirror each other. While ScW explants
from adult Bmp8b–/– mice displayed a tendency to decreased
vascular sprouting (Supplementary Figure 12a), 5-week-old
Bmp8b–/– mice did not show a significant decrease in vascular
density (Supplementary Figure 12b). This led us to hypothesize
that the WAT vascularization phenotype in Bmp8b TG mice may
be part of a homeostatic response triggered by augmented
functional requirements and might require a primary increase in
innervation in response to cold. Thus, if true, the need for
increased vascular remodeling at room temperature might not be
required if the innervation was decreased. To test this hypothesis,
Bmp8b–/– mice were acclimated to 4 °C for 1 week and the neuro-
vascular gene expression profile was screened in BAT and ScW
(Supplementary Figure 12c, d). As anticipated, ucp-1 and
neurogenesis-related genes were down-regulated in Bmp8b–/–
mice compared to WT mice. This was followed by the down-
regulation of vegf, the vascularization marker cd34 and pericyte
markers (rgs5 and pdgfβ). These results confirm the relevance of
BMP8b mediating adipose tissue angiogenesis remodeling under
condition of increased thermogenic demand, since in the absence
of BMP8b the cold exposure-induced pro-angiogenic response
was prevented.
Discussion
We provide evidence that BMP8b enhances the thermogenic
capacity of BAT and beige tissues by increasing adipocyte pro-
duction of NRG4 and angiogenic factors that coordinately
remodel thermogenic ancillary networks (vascular and nervous
networks) (Fig. 9). This is the first study identifying adipocyte-
secreted BMP8b as a potential regulator of neuro-vascular pro-
cesses, essential to couple adrenergic responsiveness, adipose
tissue remodeling and efficient thermogenesis.
From the initial insight that the thermogenic markers of
canonical BAT were not different between the two genotypes, we
rationalized that the increased thermogenic capacity observed in
the Bmp8b TG mice may depend, at least in part, on the BAT-like
phenotype observed in their ScW. Also the fact that the increased
expression of thermogenic and browning genes in Bmp8b TG
mice occurred early in the post-weaning phase, when mice are
more vulnerable to low temperatures, suggested the physiological
relevance of BMP8b mediating the adaptation to cold demands.
Another important insight about the BMP8b-mediated increase
in NE response came from the histology of the BAT and ScW of
the Bmp8b TG mice. We observed increased Scw/BAT sympa-
thetic innervation density. Further analysis may require sophis-
ticated
techniques
(e.g.,
two-photon
microscopy)
allowing
powerful imaging of sympathetic projection density38,39 avoiding
the occasional spot-like appearance of TH fibers resulting from
lateral sections in immunohistochemistry analysis.
BMP8b itself did not promote axonal growth directly but
required the positive regulation of Nrg4 expression and its
secretion by adipocytes. These data indicated that adipocyte-
derived NRG4 may have an essential role in regulating BAT
innervation in addition to its “batokine” peripheral metabolic
effect, previously reported to act on liver16. The importance of
NRG4 is also highlighted by the fact that NRG4 is the only
neuregulin family member reportedly expressed in WAT and
BAT, and by white and brown mature adipocytes16. The fact that
Nrg4 gene expression is physiologically up-regulated by cold
exposure in BAT and ScW in parallel with BMP8b further
emphasizes its physiological relevance in cold-induced nervous
network remodeling15.
While investigating how BMP8b overxpression lead to ScW
browning, we found that BMP8b increased ScW vascularization
in vivo and ex vivo. As for innervation, this effect was due to
BMP8b promoting a pro-angiogenic transcriptional and secretory
profile in adipocytes rather than through a direct effect on
endothelial cells. Despite VEGF being an important factor, it was
not the only angiogenic molecules regulated by BMP8b. We
showed a switch in the balance of angiogenic/anti-angiogenic
molecules toward a pro-angiogenic activity in the adipocytes
overexpressing/treated with BMP8b. Given that inhibition of
VEGF pathway has been described to prevent BAT/browning
activation12–14, selective ablation (pharmacologically or geneti-
cally) of VEGF in Bmp8b TG mice may provide further support
to this conclusions.
Taken together, these data indicate that whereas BMP8b is not
essential for the development and maintenance of the basal vas-
cular network in AT, the induction of BMP8b, typically observed
during cold-induced adrenergic stimulation, can be considered as
a regulator of the vascular remodeling in BAT and ScW required
to match increased thermogenic demands.
Our data strongly support the local remodeling effect of
BMP8b in WAT given that active remodeling is maintained in
mice born and housed at 28 °C. This is an important experi-
mental detail, given that 28 °C corresponds to the environmental
temperature at which the SNS input is at minimal level. At 28 °C,
the adipose tissue of the BMP8b transgenic mouse still displays a
robust increase in neuro-vascularization, scW browning and

 thermogenic capacity, which is unlikely to result from the
enhancement of the remaining small adrenergic signal provided
by the SNS. Our data demonstrate this is a cell- and tissue-
autonomous effect since ScW explants from Bmp8b TG or from
WT mice treated with BMP8b displayed increased vascular
sprouting and differential secretion of angiogenesis-related factors
compared to WT mice. Once again, these effects cannot be
ascribed to central effect (since these cells were cultured ex vivo)
and are not influenced by exposure to adrenergic agonist (NE). Its
independence from central nervous system input is further sup-
ported by the lack of changes in efferent SNS activity in Bmp8b
TG mice.

depend on the activation of the SNS but on its direct trophic
action to supporting structural networks. This model of regula-
tion has the advantage of being regulated at local level by the
target organ response and not exclusively and/or primarily by the
sympathetic inflow. This biological strategy should efficiently
titrate the local adaptation required to fulfill the functional
thermogenic demands more accurately.
We used an in vivo transgenic approach to model the effects of
the induction of BMP8b in WAT/BAT typically observed during
cold exposure and identify potential triggers controlling adipose
tissue remodeling in response to cold. The relevance and auton-
omy of these mechanisms has been subsequently validated using
purposely designed experiments. We rationalized that instead of
using adiponectin or UCP-1 to drive transgene expression, the
aP2 promoter offered the advantage of driving expression not
only in mature adipocytes but also in progenitors, a feature that is
important considering its relevance in the process of beige cell
recruitment40. However, we were aware that this transgenic
approach has intrinsic limitations related to persistent over-
expression from embryogenesis, the achieved level of transgene
expression and/or the possibility of ectopic confounding non-
adipose effects. Our observations could be refined with inducible
models to control the expression of Bmp8b either at 5 weeks or
12 weeks of age which would further confirm the role of BMP8b
as a potential regulator of AT neuro-vascular remodeling.
Our results have shown that beige cells, despite their early
development and apparent disappearance during adulthood,
retain their hyper-responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation in
adult mice, behaving as “dormant” beige cells. This time profile is
potentially of interest as it may define a critical time interval, early
in life, where the contribution of BMP8b to the development and
recruitment of the beige cell pool is important. This time window
was also suggested by Contreras et al.41 who showed that beige
cell recruitment is particularly active in ScW of mice between 10
and 30 days postnatal. After this early time window, developed
beige cells remain functionally “dormant”, but ready to be awo-
ken later on in response to cold stress or to β3-adrenergic ago-
nists. Our results indicate that maintenance of these latent beige
adipocytes in white depots is dependent on BMP8b and that these
latent cells are functionally important by enabling a quick and
efficient thermogenic response under challenging environmental
or nutritional conditions41.
In summary, we have shown that the increase in BMP8b
secretion by adipocytes under conditions of increased thermo-
genic demand, such as cold exposure or HFD, might contribute
for the efficient remodeling required for BAT/beige recruitment
and function. Most browning models described in the literature
are based on targeting late effectors of thermogenic, angiogenic
factors or the SNS14,42,43. BMP8b is an upstream adipocyte-
derived regulator that optimizes neuro-vascular remodeling
coupled to tissue thermogenic demands. Thus, by targeting
Bmp8b, and acting upstream of these three important pathways,
it should be feasible to control the efficient coordination of adi-
pocyte thermogenesis, angiogenesis and innervation. The evi-
dence that BMP8b-mediated signaling may couple browning and
optimization of the supporting neuro-vascular network provides
the rationale for a new and safe approach to the treatment of the
obese patient, addressing the problem of previous anti-obesity
therapy-based adrenergic stimulation, discontinued because of
associated hypertension and/or tachycardia. This is not only
based on optimizing the efficacy of BAT-specific adrenergic
agonists in terms of activating and recruiting BAT or beige fat,
but also in optimizing the ancillary systems of angiogenesis and
neurogenesis, which may decrease the side effects inherent to
thermogenic strategies exclusively based on promoting adrenergic
stimulation.
Methods
The key resources including genetically modified mice models, cell lines, reagents,
antibodies and software used in the present study are indicated in the Supple-
mentary Table 1.
Animals. Unless otherwise stated, all data are from work on females. C57Bl6/J
mice were purchased from Charles River. Bmp8b –/– mice were generated as pre-
viously described44 on a C57Bl6/J background and were compared to wild-type
littermates. Unless stated, mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (21
°C) with a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to diet and water. Regarding Bmp8b
TG mice, WT SV129*C57Bl/6J mixed strain mice were engineered to express the
murine Bmp8b gene from the apolipoprotein 2 (Fabp4) promoter. Mice were
backcrossed until whole genome analysis confirmed that they were >98% C57Bl/6J
genotype. For each experiment, the age of the mice is stated in the figure legends.
This research has been regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the University of
Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) and all ethical
regulations were complied with. The UK Home Office, USC Bioethics Committee
and the University of Iowa Animal Research Committee approved all animal
procedures.
Diet and temperature studies. Diets for animal studies included standard chow
(sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% calories from lipid) and an HFD (D12451,
Research Diets, 45% calories from lipid). Standard chow or HFD was administered
ad libitum to animals from weaning until indicated. Studies in conditions
approaching thermoneutrality involved (1) mice born and housed at 28 °C or (2)
mice housed at 28 °C for 3 weeks. Fasting consisted of removing food for 24 h, and
refeeding involved fasting followed by replacement of food for 24 h. Fat and lean
masses were calculated by time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance using a
minispec Live Mice Analyzer LF50 (Bruker).
Energy expenditure and maximum thermogenic capacity. Energy expenditure
(EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were calculated from data gathered from
single-housed mice fed ad libitum by a monitoring system based on home cages
(Ideas Studio) designed by Dr. Peter Murgatroyd. The monitoring system calculates
oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations at 18-min intervals. EE was calculated
from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production measured over a 48 h
period using indirect calorimetry with the Elia and Livesey constants for TQ.
Maximum thermogenic capacity of mice was assessed by indirect calorimetry,
performed in an Oxymax calorimetry chamber which had a 2.7-liter capacity.

 Temperature within calorimetric chambers was continuously monitored and fixed
at 30 °C. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured
using a custom built oxygen and carbon dioxide monitoring system built by P.
Murgatroyd. Airflow rates were set at 400 ml/min. Measurements of oxygen con-
centration and carbon dioxide concentration in room air and air leaving each cage
were measured every 4 min. Mice were placed in the calorimetric chamber fol-
lowing anesthesia by intra-peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg).
Baseline gas exchange was recorded once steady state was achieved (at least 3
consecutive stable measurements). Mice were then injected with 1 mg/kg nora-
drenaline bitartrate (Sigma, UK) subcutaneously and returned to the calorimetry
chamber. Maximal oxygen consumption rates were typically achieved within
12–16 min post injection and were defined either as 3 stable consecutive readings
or when oxygen consumption rates began to fall. Energy expenditure was calcu-
lated from VO2 and VCO2 using the modified Weir equation.

 Cell culture and differentiation. The immortalized brown adipocyte (C57BAT)
cell line was a gift from the laboratory of Johannes Klein and was generated as
previously described17. By day 8 post induction, cells were defined as differentiated
if they appeared healthy and lipid replete. T3 and insulin were removed from the
media 24 h prior to any treatment with these molecules. 3T3-L1 Cells were dif-
ferentiated into adipocytes (day 9) accordingly to the protocol described by Roberts
et al.45.
Catecholamine measurement. Adipose tissues (BAT, ScW, GnW), skeletal muscle
and serum were collected from 12-week-old bmp8b WT and TG mice kept at 21 °C
or from 5-week-old bmp8b WT and TG mice born and housed at 28 °C. Tissue
extract and serum were prepared in 2% perchloric acid (PCA) (20 mg of tissue/20
μl serum per 200 μl 2% PCA) and analyzed for NE content using reversed-phase
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mobile phase was prepared
using HPLC grade reagents and consisted of citric acid (31.9 g/l), sodium acetate
(3.3 g/l), sodium octane sulphonic acid (460 mg/l), methanol (10%), adjusted to pH
3.7. Separation was achieved using a Hyperclone® 5μ BOS C18 analytical column
(Phenomenex, UK) and a flow rate of 0. 75 ml/min. Analytes were detected elec-
trochemically (Coulochem II, ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA, USA) with E1 –200 mV
and E2 +250 mV. Chromatograms were acquired and integrated using the
Chromelean Chromatography Data System (V6.2, Dionex, UK).
Lipolysis assays. Brown and white mature adipocytes were isolated from ScW of
10–12-week-old Bmp8b WT and TG mice and embedded in a hydrogel (Pur-
aMatrix®, Corning) for 24 h prior to adrenergic antagonist stimulation as described
in ref. 46. Adipocytes/hydrogel were then incubated in Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate
buffer with or without NE (75 nM) for 4 h at 37 °C. Glycerol was measured as an
index of lipolysis by using free glycerol reagent (Sigma) against a glycerol standard
curve.
Immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells. Mouse cardiac endothelial cells
(MCECs) were maintained in 5% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium without
sodium pyruvate with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 mM
HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 20 mM L-glutamine
(“MCEC growth media”) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in flasks pre-coated with 0.02%
gelatin.
Matrigel assays. Pro-angiogenic capacity of BMP8 recombinant protein was
assessed using the in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay33. MCECs were seeded at a
density of 15,000 cells per well (96-well plate) pre-coated with 75 μl of Matrigel™-
GF reduced (BD Biosciences) and cultured in MCEC growth media without FBS in
the presence or not of BMP8 recombinant protein directly or conditioned medium
from BMP8-treated adipocytes. After 8 h of incubation, phase-contrast images of
the totality of the wells were taken with an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope
coupled to a DP20 digital camera. The total branching points of the network
structures were quantified blind by two independent experimenters.
Primary sympathetic neurons. NGF-dependent sympathetic neurons of the SCG
of neonatal mice, at stages from E14 to P5, were removed and digested in 0.05%
trypsin (Worthington) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for 30 min. SCGs
were washed twice with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Gibco) in F-12 medium
(Gibco), and then dissociated mechanically. Cells were plated on 35 mm dishes
with 4 mini-wells at a density of approximately 100 cells per well; wells were pre-
coated with poly-ornithine (Sigma) overnight and laminin (20 μg/ml; Sigma). Cells
were maintained overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 18 h in growth medium sup-
plemented as stated in the figure legends. Growth medium was F-14 media (JRH
Biosciences) with 1.176 mg/ml sodium hydrogen bicarbonate, 200 units/ml peni-
cillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 2% Albumax—a bovine
serum albumin (BSA) solution supplemented with progesterone (60 μg/ml),
putrecine (16 μg/ml), L-thyroxine (400 ng/ml), sodium selenite (38 ng/ml) and
triiodothyronine (340 ng/ml) (all from Sigma). Cultures were treated with either
BMP8 or NGF.Controls received neither factor. Apoptosis was prevented in cul-
tures without NGF by the pancaspase inhibitor Boc_D_FMK. Individual SCG
neurons were visualized by Calcein-AM (Invitrogen) staining and imaged blind by
fluorescent microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200) after 24 h, and total neurite length and
number of branches in the neurite arbors were quantified. All neurites in these
short-term SCG cultures have the characteristics of axons47. Growth was assessed
by Sholl analysis as described previously48.
Explants for conditioned medium. Approximately 100 mg of freshly dissected
ScW from 10-week-old WT or Bmp8b TG mice was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in
5% CO2 in MCEC growth media without FBS supplemented (1 ml media per 100
mg of ScW). Subsequently, ScW was cut into fine pieces and incubated for 24 h at
37 °C in 5% CO2 in MCEC growth media (1 ml media per 100 mg of AT).
Explants for assaying angiogenic growth. Wells of a 96-well plate were pre-
coated with 40 μl of Matrigel, into which freshly dissected ScW fragments from
10–12-week-old WT or Bmp8b TG mice were embedded, and another 40 μl of
Matrigel was added over the ScW fragment. Then, 100 μl of MCEC growth media
was added, supplemented as indicated in the figure legend. Explants were main-
tained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 10 days, after which phase-contrast images were
taken with an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope coupled to a DP20 digital
camera. Angiogenic outgrowth was quantified.
Array-based detection of angiogenic factors. The Proteome ProfilerTM Mouse
Angiogenesis Array Kit (R&D Systems, USA, Catalog Number: ARRY 015) was
employed to screen for the presence of 53 soluble angiogenesis-related factors in
the conditioned media from C57 brown adipocytes and BAT/ScW explants from
bmp8b mice, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the angiogenesis
antibody membrane was incubated for 1 h with an array blocking buffer prior
incubation overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker with 1.5 ml of conditioned media.
The membrane was then washed and incubated fpr 30 min with streptavidin-
horseradish peroxidase solution. Membranes were exposed digitally using the
ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad), and spots were quantified using the ImageJ
software. One condition corresponds to a pool of conditioned medium from four
independent experiments. All the arrays were measured three times; each spots
were normalized to the positives controls. The results are presented in a heat map
and considered relevant when the fold variation was >1.3 or <0.6.
ELISA assays. NRG4 protein concentration was measured using an ELISA kit for
murine NRG4 (Catlag Medsystems, SEC174Mu) in conditioned media (from
which debris was removed by centrifugation), serum and tissue (homogenized in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A
standard curve was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the
value associated with an unconditioned media blank was subtracted from that of
conditioned media. VEGF-A protein concentration was measured using an ELISA
kit for murine VEGF-A (R&D Systems) in cell conditioned media (from which
debris was removed by centrifugation) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. A standard curve was prepared in unconditioned media.
Whole-tissue immunofluorescence. AT samples were fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then transferred to PBS, in which
they were stored at 4 °C until immunofluorescence analysis. Tissues were blocked
in 1 M glycine and then PBS with 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were
then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody or with fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated Isolectin B4 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Bound primary
antibody was detected if necessary after a further blocking step in PBS with 3% BSA
using secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® dyes (488 and 568). Sam-
ples were mounted using VECTASHIELD® mounting medium with DAPI (4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole) and imaged blind using Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal

 microscope with LSM 3D software (Carl Zeiss). At least three images per AT
sample per stain were used for quantification, which was also performed blind.
Cd31+, Ng2+ and isolectin+ areas were calculated using ImageJ software. The
number of vessels per adipocyte was calculated from tissue stained for Isolectin
(vessels) and caveolin (vessels and adipocytes). The number of pericytes per EC
(pericytes coverage) was calculated by manually counting the number of Cd31+
and Ng2+ cells in a field of view, and then counting how many were in contact with
Cd31+ cells.
Tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining. Fixed AT samples were dehydrated,
cleared and paraffin embedded. TH immunoreactivity was determined by DAB
immunohistochemistry using 3 μm sections from 3 different levels (100 μm apart)
per sample. Briefly, sections were dewaxed and endogenous peroxidase blocked by
incubating in 3% HO2 in methanol. Sections were then blocked in 3% rabbit serum
and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-TH antibody (1/200) diluted in PBS.
Bound primary antibody was detected using a biotinylated anti-sheep IgG sec-
ondary antibody, ABC reagent (Vector) and DAB Substrate kit (Sigma-Aldrich)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Finally, sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin. Parenchymal TH-positive fibers were analyzed by live count
command in Lucia Imaging for image analysis (version 4.82, Nikon Instruments,
Florence, Italy). The area of TH-positive nerve fibers was measured using images
randomly captured with a Nikon E600 Eclipse microscope with camera. Ten areas
from interscapular BAT were analyzed in each section. In inguinal ScW, 10 ran-
dom areas were analyzed in each section. Areas of pure white adipocytes (larger,
unilocular) and of pure beige adipocytes (smaller, multilocular) were analyzed
separately.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR. RNA from cells and from SCGs was har-
vested and purified using QiaShredder and RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was harvested from frozen
tissue using RNA-STAT-60TM (AMS Bio), and purified by chloroform extraction
and isopropanol precipitation.
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated in a 20 μl reaction as follows: 500
ng RNA was added to 4 μl 5x M-MLV reverse transcriptase master mix (Promega)
with 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM dNTPs, and 5 μg/ml random hexamers, and
incubated for 5 min at 65 oC before being transferred directly to ice. After the
addition of 1 μl M-MLV reverse transcriptase, the reaction was incubated at 37 °C
for 1 h and 95 °C for 5 min. cDNA was diluted 75-fold.
Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was
performed in a 12.2 μl reaction with 5 μl of diluted cDNA using TaqMan (Applied
Biosystems) primers and probes or SYBR green reagent (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer sequences are described in
Supplementary Table 2. Reactions were run in duplicate for each sample and
quantified using the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems). Duplicates were checked for reproducibility, and then averaged.
Product specificity was determined using a dissociation curve for SYBR green
reactions. A standard curve generated from a pool of all cDNA samples was used
for quantification. The expression of genes of interest was normalized using
BestKeeper©7 to the geometric average four housekeeping genes (18s, 36b4, β-actin
and B2m).
Western blotting. Proteins were extracted from tissue in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-
HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) with
added protease inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche) cocktails.
Debris and fat were cleared from lysates by centrifugation. Protein concentration
was determined by Dc Protein assay (Bio- Rad). After dilution in Laemmli buffer
with 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 μg protein was separated by electrophoresis in a
NuPAGETM SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitro-
cellulose membrane using the iBlot® Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). Membranes
were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk protein or 5% BSA in tris-buffered saline with
0.05% Tween at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the
appropriate primary antibody (Supplementary Table 1). Bound primary antibodies
were detected using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced che-
miluminescence (Millipore). Blots were exposed digitally using the ChemiDoc MP
System (Bio-Rad), and bands were quantified using Image Lab™ software (Bio-
Rad). The expression of proteins was normalized to protein levels of a house-
keeping protein (β-actin or Gapdh), and data are expressed as arbitrary units.
Cytotoxicity assays. To determine the cytotoxic effect of compounds on MCECs,
MCECs were seeded in MCEC growth medium without FBS supplemented at a
density of 15,000 cells per well in wells of a 96-well plate that were pre-coated with
0.02% gelatin. Cells were treated with the given compounds at the given con-
centrations for 24 h, and cytotoxicity was measured using an LDH-Cytotoxicity
Calorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Adipocyte area and multilocularity. AT samples were fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and then transferred to PBS in which they were
stored at 4 °C until immunohistochemical analysis. Fixed AT was embedded in
paraffin and sectioned into 5 μm sections. Adipocyte area and proportion of adi-
pocyte population showing multilocularity were determined using Cell P (Olym-
pus) and ImageJ software from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections
imaged using an Olympus BX41 light microscope coupled to a ColorView digital
color camera. At least three sections per tissue per animal were quantified blind.
Flow cytometry staining and analysis. ScW from 12-week-old Bmp8b WT and
TG mice was dissociated by collagenase treatment isolating unilocular adipocytes
from the stromavascular fraction (SVF). The SVF was then kept in FACS buffer
(PBS, 1 mM EDTA, 3% HI-FBS) on ice. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD
(Invitrogen) and non-specific binding was blocked with 5 μg/ml anti-CD16/32
(Clone 93, Biolegend). Cell surfaces were then stained with anti-CD45 (30-F11, BD
Biosciences), anti-CD31 (MEC 13.3, BD Biosciences), anti-CD34 (RAM 34, BD
Biosciences) and anti-PDGFRα/CD140a (APA5, BD Biosciences). Cells were gated
within the live cell population as CD45–, CD31–, CD34+ and PDGFRa+. Data were
acquired on a Fortessa LSRII (BD Biosciences) using FACS Diva software and
analyzed with TreeStar FlowJo.
Magnetic-activated cell sorting. ScW from 12-week-old Bmp8b WT and TG
mice was dissociated by collagenase treatment isolating unilocular adipocytes from
the SVF. SVF was resuspended in MACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA (sterile), 0.5%
bovine serum albumin) and sequentially incubated with Microbeads conjugated to
monoclonal anti-mouse CD45 antibodies (Ly-5; isotype: rat IgG2b; clone:30-F11.1,
Miltenyi Biotech), monoclonal antihuman/mouse CD11b (Mac-1α) antibodies
(isotype: rat IgG2b, Miltenyi Biotech) and anti-CD31 antibody (isotype: ratIgG2a,
Miltenyi Biotech) or 15 min at 4 °C. Finally, the CD45+, CD11b+ and CD31+
fractions were isolated using MACS LS columns according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Miltenyi Biotech).
Sympathetic nerve recordings. Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) was measured
directly from nerves supplying interscapular BAT and WAT as previously
described17. Baseline SNA and hemodynamic variables were recorded for 10 min
with rectal temperature maintained at 37.5 °C. An average of three separate mea-
surements during the control period was considered to be the baseline value. After
baseline BAT SNA was taken, using ice packs the rectal temperature of each mouse
was lowered at constant and controlled rate, which was the same for each animal
(0.25 °C/min). SNA to BAT was measured every 2 min. Background noise was

in adipocytes and subsequent hyper-activation of the sympathetic tone
induce the recruitment of thermogenic beige adipocytes in ScW which are
accompanied by the expansion of the sympathetic nervous and vascular
networks. BMP8b notably promotes outgrowth and branching of
sympathetic nerve axons, through NRG4 production, and the production of
new capillaries by regulating the function of vascular cells and production of
angiogenic factors

Phospho-antibody array. Brown differentiated adipocytes were treated with
human recombinant BMP8 (100 pM) or NE (75 nM) or the combination of both
prior to phosphoproteome assay. Cell lysates were applied to the Phospho Explorer
Antibody Array (PEX100), which has been designed and manufactured by Full
Moon Biosystems Inc. as previously published49,50. We verified the sequence
position of phosphosites in UniProt sequences using data from PhosphoSitePlus51
(see Supplementary information). We looked up the potential kinases for the
phosphosites in dbPTM51, HPRD52, Li 201253, MIMP54, phospho.ELM55, Phos-
phoNetworks56, PhosphoSitePlus and Signor57 databases. We also considered the
regulatory effects of the phosphosites, i.e., whether the phosphorylation is known to
induce or disrupt the substrate’s interaction with other proteins, using the reg-
ulatory sites dataset from PhosphoSitePlus51. For the processing of the above-
mentioned databases we used the pypath Python module that accompanies
Omnipath58. We selected GO Biological Process terms59 to define five functions we
were particularly interested in (angiogenesis; cell cycle and survival; inflammation;
lipid metabolism and thermogenic activity; and neurogenesis) and we determined if
the proteins showing high fold change on the phosphoassay, or their kinases or the
downstream proteins regulated by the phosphorylation events, are annotated with
any of these GO terms. To have a more unbiased insight into the biological
functions of the observed patterns, we selected the phosphosite with the highest
absolute fold change for each protein, a pathway enrichment analysis using the
“piano“ R package was also performed36.
Network analysis. We built a directed signaling network comprising 4557 nodes
and 17,297 edges using the pathway dataset of OmniPath (https://doi.org/10.1038/
nmeth.4077). For all proteins with expression measured by qPCR in BAT of Bmp8b
TG mice we collected the TFs regulating their expression using data up to con-
fidence level D from the TF Regulons database60. We calculated the distances in
this network from each of the proteins measured on the phosphoassay to all TFs
using random walks with return, performing 15 iterations with 0.5 return prob-
ability according to equation 1 in ref. 61. We estimated the TF activities based on
the qPCR measured expression data from bmp8b TG vs. WT mice using the
”msviper” method from the ”viper” R package (https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3593).
We tested whether the proteins with phosphosites altered upon BMP8 treatment
(phosphorylation fold change greater than 1.5) are closer in the network to the TFs
of the proteins differentially expressed in BAT of Bmp8b TG mice. We found that
although their distance is significantly lower by Mann–Whitney test, the difference
is very small (not shown). We selected the 30 signaling proteins from the phos-
phoassay with lowest distances to nrg4 and vegfa, the neurogenic and angiogenic
factors with the most altered expression, and we show the phosphorylation fold
change of these in Fig. 8a, b. We selected the TFs of vegfa with the most altered
activities in bmp8b TG vs WT mice (p value < 0.2), and we show the normalized
enrichment scores of these in Fig. 8c. All scripts used for the analysis can be found
in https://github.com/saezlab/bmp8b.
Statistics. The number of animals or independent experiments were determined
based on pilot data and are all indicated in the figure legends. No statistical
methods were used to predetermine the total number of animals needed for this
study. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators, while blinded
during the experiments and assessment of the outcome, were not blinded to the
animals’ allocation. Mice were divided in groups with the same average body
weight per group. All data from experiments is represented as a mean, with error
bars showing standard error of the mean and the number of replicates stated in the
figure legends. Some data are represented as a fold change, and it is stated in the
figure legends to what value the data represented was normalized to generate the
fold change. Statistical analyses and Grubbs’ tests to exclude outliers were per-
formed using Prism6 software (GraphPad). The tests used are also stated in the
figure legends. A t-test with equal variances was applied to compare two groups;
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated measures ANOVA were used
to compare more than two groups, followed by Bonferroni’s or Sidak post-hoc test.
When more than one factor influenced the variable being measured, two-way
ANOVA was used to test for a significant effect of each factor as well as an
interaction between factors followed by Sidak post-hoc test. Gene panels were
analyzed using multiple t-tests with a FDR determined using the two-stage linear
step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli, with Q = 1%.
