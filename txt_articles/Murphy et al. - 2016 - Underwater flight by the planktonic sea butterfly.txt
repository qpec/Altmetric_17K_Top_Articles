Underwater flight by the planktonic sea butterfly

ABSTRACT
In a remarkable example of convergent evolution, we show that the
zooplanktonic sea butterfly Limacina helicina ‘flies’ underwater in the
same way that very small insects fly in the air. Both sea butterflies and
flying insects stroke their wings in a characteristic figure-of-eight
pattern to produce lift, and both generate extra lift by peeling their
wings apart at the beginning of the power stroke (the well-known
Weis-Fogh ‘clap-and-fling’ mechanism). It is highly surprising to find a
zooplankter ‘mimicking’ insect flight as almost all zooplankton swim in
this intermediate Reynolds number range (Re=10–100) by using their
appendages as paddles rather than wings. The sea butterfly is also
unique in that it accomplishes its insect-like figure-of-eight wing stroke
by extreme rotation of its body (what we call ‘hyper-pitching’), a
paradigm that has implications for micro aerial vehicle (MAV) design.
No other animal, to our knowledge, pitches to this extent under normal
locomotion.

INTRODUCTION
Zooplankton swim to find food and mates and to escape from and
avoid predators. Indeed, in what is likely the largest animal migration
on Earth in terms of biomass, many zooplankton species swim
hundreds of meters to the water surface every night to graze and
avoid predation (Hays, 2003). How these millimeter-to-centimeter
scale organisms efficiently propel themselves at intermediate
Reynolds numbers is thus of great interest. Zooplankton and small
insects swim and fly, respectively, in an intermediate Reynolds
number regime (Re=ul/ν =10–1000, where u is the characteristic
velocity scale, l is the characteristic length scale and ν is kinematic
viscosity) in which both viscous and inertial forces are important.
However, they generally use different locomotion techniques. Most
zooplankton species (e.g. copepods and euphausiids) in this Re
regime paddle through the water with drag-based propulsion in
which viscous drag on a hairy, jointed appendage is maximized
during the power stroke and minimized on the recovery stroke
(Strickler, 1975; Yen, 2000; Kiørboe et al., 2014). In contrast, insects
such as fruit flies use their wings as airfoils to generate aerodynamic
lift (and drag) on both power and recovery strokes (Dickinson et al.,
1999). Insects may generate additional lift via unsteady aerodynamic
interactions between the wings such as the well-known Weis-Fogh
‘clap-and-fling’ mechanism (Weis-Fogh, 1973; Lighthill, 1973;
Ellington, 1984a,b; Dickinson et al., 1999).
The Weis-Fogh mechanism, including variants such as the
‘partial clap-and-fling’, ‘near clap-and-fling’ and ‘clap-and-peel’, is
used by a wide variety of flying insect species (Ellington, 1984a).
The technique was first noted in the tiny wasp Encarsia formosa
(Weis-Fogh, 1973), which hovers by beating its sub-millimeter-
length wings at a frequency of approximately 400 Hz. Use of the
Weis-Fogh mechanism appears to be an obligate behavior for small
insects flying at less than about Re=100, including thrips (Ellington,
1984a; Santhanakrishnan et al., 2014), the greenhouse white-fly
Trialeurodes vaoparium (Weis-Fogh, 1975) and the parasitoid wasp
species Muscidifurax raptor and Nasonia vitripennis (Miller and
Peskin, 2009). For the slightly larger Drosophila species, flying at
Re>100, the Weis-Fogh mechanism is rarely used in free flight but is
seen when the animal is tethered (Vogel, 1967; Lehmann et al.,
2005). Larger flying insects, such as moths and butterflies
(Ellington, 1984a) and locusts in climbing flight (Cooter and
Baker, 1977), have also been observed using the Weis-Fogh
mechanism. Experimental measurements of the flow generated by
the Weis-Fogh mechanism in freely flying insects have proven
prohibitive because of the small time and length scales involved,
though studies of tethered insects (Dickinson and Götz, 1996;
Fuchiwaki et al., 2013) and dynamically scaled models (Dickinson
et al., 1999; Lehmann et al., 2005; Lehmann and Pick, 2007) have
offered valuable insight. Computational modeling has also proven
helpful for understanding the fluid dynamics of flight by tiny flying
insects (Miller and Peskin, 2005, 2009; Santhanakrishnan et al.,
2014; Jones et al., 2015).
It has been suggested, based on kinematics measurements, that
marine mollusks such as Clione limacina (Satterlie et al., 1985;
Szymik and Satterlie, 2011), Clione antarctica (Borrell et al., 2005)
and Limacina helicina (Chang and Yen, 2012) also perform
a version of the clap-and-fling at a similar intermediate Re.
These marine organisms potentially offer the opportunity to
experimentally measure flows induced by a freely ‘flying’ animal
using the Weis-Fogh mechanism because of the larger sizes of these
mollusks and their lower appendage beat frequencies (compared
with tiny flying insects). Furthermore, the appendage kinematics
and body pitching of these larger organisms beating at lower
frequencies could be resolved with much greater detail. Limacina
helicina locomotion was investigated in the current study.
The zooplankter L. helicina is a pelagic thecosomatous sea snail
known as the sea butterfly. Limacina helicina is ecologically
important for the large biomass it maintains in polar pelagic
ecosystems. Furthermore, because its shell sinks when the animal
dies, L. helicina is geochemically important as a major conduit of
carbon to the deep ocean (Bednaršek et al., 2012). In temperate
regions, L. helicina reaches shell diameters of 1–4 mm and swims at
speeds of 10–50 mm s−1, whereas in the sub-Arctic, their shells may
grow to 14 mm, with swimming speeds reaching 120 mm s−1
(Chang and Yen, 2012). In contrast to many other zooplankton,
pelagic pteropods such as L. helicina (see Figs 1 and 2; Movies 1
and
2)
possess
smooth,
wing-like
swimming
appendages
(parapodia) that flap in a complex three-dimensional stroke

 pattern resembling the wingbeat kinematics of flying insects (Chang
and Yen, 2012). Indeed, the chordwise Reynolds number (Rec) of
L. helicina swimming (Rec=40–90) lies between the Rec of flight by
thrips (Rec=5–35) (Weis-Fogh, 1973; Santhanakrishnan et al.,
2014) and fruit flies (Rec=100–300) (Dickinson et al., 1999). These
similarities suggest that, like insect flight, pteropod swimming also
may be lift based and raise the possibility that pteropods may have
converged to the same lift generation mechanisms used by many
insects (e.g. the Weis-Fogh clap-and-fling). This convergence
would have occurred along a completely different evolutionary
lineage as Insecta and Gastropoda are thought to have diverged 550
million years ago (Valentine, 1997; McGhee, 2011). Lift-based
flapping locomotion is well known among larger aquatic animals,
such as sea turtles, but would be highly unusual for aquatic animals
on the scale of zooplankton (at low Re), where the ratio of lift-to-
drag on a flapping appendage decreases dramatically. The potential
benefit to pteropods, however, is that flapping appendages are more
mechanically efficient than rowing appendages at all swimming
speeds (Walker and Westneat, 2000). In addition, flapping strokes
generate
greater
vertical
force
at
the
Reynolds
numbers
characteristic of pteropod swimming (Jones et al., 2015). Efficient
generation of lift is particularly important to L. helicina as it
possesses a dense aragonite shell which causes it to rapidly sink
when not swimming or suspended from its parachute-like mucus
feeding web (Gilmer and Harbison, 1986; Bednaršek et al., 2012;
Chang and Yen, 2012).
Our hypothesis is that, despite living in a low Re aquatic
environment,
this
pteropod
employs
lift-based
locomotion
techniques similar to those used by many small, flying insects. In
order to determine whether pteropod swimming is employing lift- or
drag-based propulsion, we filmed free-swimming individuals of
L. helicina in the laboratory to obtain highly resolved three-
dimensional flow fields surrounding the pteropod. We measured
three-dimensional kinematics of the pteropod body and wingtips
from the same recordings. This is the first study to measure detailed
kinematics and the flow fields created by a freely ‘flying’ organism
using the Weis-Fogh mechanism and provides the most complete
picture to date of how the clap-and-fling is used in free ‘flight’.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Limacina helicina (Phipps 1774) were collected off the coast near
the Hadfield Marine Station in Newport, OR, USA, in June 2011
and were shipped overnight to Atlanta, GA, USA, where they were
kept in buckets of artificial seawater at 32 ppt in an environmental
chamber set at 12°C. Tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV)
measurements of freely swimming animals were collected at
500 frames s−1 within 1 week using the four-camera system
described by Murphy et al. (2012, 2013). The flow was seeded with
11.7 µm mean diameter hollow glass spheres and illumination was
provided by near-infrared lasers (808 nm). The pteropods generally
swam vertically upwards until they reached the water surface, at
which point they sank to the bottom and began swimming upwards
again. Three recordings in which an animal entered the illuminated
16×10.5×8.5 mm measurement volume were suitable for processing
and further analysis (designated as pteropods 1, 2 and 3).

 LaVision’s DaVis 8.2 software was used for processing. A
preliminary mapping function for all four cameras was determined
from images of a calibration plate. A self-calibration procedure
reduced disparity errors and hence corrected the calibration
mapping function for all cameras. Particle intensity volumes were
then reconstructed in the volume using the MLOS-SMART
algorithm. A visual hull method was applied on the reconstructed
volume to remove reconstruction artifacts caused by the presence of
the organism and consequently avoid contaminating local fluid
velocity vectors during cross-correlation (Adhikari and Longmire,
2012). Cross-correlating masked volume pairs separated by 2 ms
yielded fluid velocity fields. The interrogation volume was
64×64×64 voxels. Using a 75% overlap resulted in fields of
64×42×34 vectors with a vector spacing of 0.25 mm.
Table 1 shows morphological and kinematic characteristics of the
three pteropods, as well as the Rec for each individual. The four
videos synchronously collected for tomographic PIV analysis were
also used to extract kinematics of the pteropods in three dimensions.
For each animal, three locations on the shell (labeled A, B and C in
Fig. 1) and the two wingtips (labeled D and E) were manually
tracked in DLTdv5 software (Hedrick, 2008). The sagittal planes of
pteropods 1 and 2 were closely aligned with the imaging planes of
the cameras. This alignment allowed calculation of each pteropod’s
body angle θ (Fig. 1). In addition, points A, B and C were used to
calculate each pteropod’s geometric center assuming a circular
shell, thereby allowing calculation of the trajectories in the x–z plane
for pteropods 1 and 2. Wingtips (points D and E) were tracked for
pteropod 1, but could not be tracked for pteropod 2 because of its
smaller size and highly transparent parapodia. For pteropod 1,
wingtip coordinates in the body-centered coordinate system were
calculated by translating and rotating the coordinates relative to the
origin located at point A (Fig. 1). The sagittal plane of pteropod 3
was aligned perpendicular to the imaging planes of the cameras; the
body angle and geometric center trajectory could not be extracted in
this case. However, the alignment of pteropod 3 allowed
hydrodynamic analysis of the flow around and between the
parapodia. The wing opening angle α, formed by points D, A and
E in Fig. 1, was also calculated for pteropod 3.

 their chord throughout the complex stroke (Chang and Yen, 2012).
The pteropod begins its power stroke with its wings raised together
above its shell. The tips of the arching wings touch but are separated
at the wing base, forming a canopy. The wingtips roll along each
other and separate from the leading edge to the trailing edge,
twisting along their span as they begin the power stroke. The wings
stroke diagonally downwards, ending the power stroke by lying
across the shell. The wingtips extend beyond the shell and bend in
the spanwise direction to approach or touch each other. Much of this
spanwise bending, which occurs at the extreme positions (i.e. the
beginning and end of the power stroke), appears to occur in the
narrow, proximal half of the wing; the broad, distal wingtips appear
relatively flat throughout the stroke. The power stroke induces a 50–
60 deg rotation of the pteropod about its transverse axis and a rapid
increase in its speed to approximately 40 mm s−1. In preparation for
the recovery stroke, the pteropod then slides its wings upwards
along its body as its speed decreases to about 10 mm s−1. In the
recovery stroke, the pteropod strokes
its wings diagonally
downwards in the opposite direction, again increasing the
animal’s speed (to about 35 mm s−1) and pitching the pteropod in
the opposite direction. Finally, the pteropod recovers its wings to
their original position above the shell. The pteropod gains elevation
during both power and recovery strokes, resulting in an upward
sawtooth trajectory (see Fig. 4) as it beats it wings at a frequency of
5–9 Hz (Chang and Yen, 2012).
After accounting for the extreme rotation of L. helicina, its wing
kinematics show striking similarity to those of insects flying in the
same Re regime. In a body-centered coordinate system, the wingtip
traces a complex trajectory (Fig. 5) in which it is not clear how
useful lift could be generated. In a ‘global’ coordinate system (i.e.
one that translates with the animal but does not rotate) that thereby
includes the effect of body pitching, the pteropod effectively strokes
its parapodia in a figure-of-eight pattern (Fig. 5). Figure-of-eight
wingtip trajectories are common in flying insects (Ellington, 1984a)

 recovery strokes, have been shown to produce the most lift when
compared with other, insect-inspired wingtip trajectories (Lehmann
and Pick, 2007). Limacina helicina uses a large angle of attack
(46 deg in the power stroke and 49 deg in the recovery stroke), a
technique that allows it to maximize lift. Furthermore, its stroke
planes for both power and recovery strokes lie approximately 29 deg
above the horizontal plane. Drag on its appendages, acting parallel
to the stroke plane, therefore provides additional upward vertical
force during both power and recovery strokes; this technique is also
used by many insects (Wang, 2004).
Power stroke
Separation of the parapodia at the beginning of the power stroke
draws fluid downward into the growing, V-shaped gap between the
wings (t′=0.18–0.22 in Fig. 6). The time variation of the angle α
between the wings during the fling is shown in Fig. 7. As the
parapodia separate anteriorly to posteriorly, the downward flow also
has an out-of-plane component. By t′=0.24, the flow has separated
from both wingtips to form elongated leading edge vortices, a
process that continues at t′=0.27. By t′=0.32 (Fig. 8), these vortices
have strengthened and are in the process of being shed from the
wingtips. Shear layers at the base of each wing also begin to develop
as the pteropod rises through the leading edge vortices, pushing a
bow wave upward in front of the pteropod’s shell. This upwards
flow is pushed down along the pteropod’s wings by the now-shed
leading edge vortices, creating an elongated region of high vorticity
along each wing (t′=0.35–0.37). At t′=0.37, the parapodia are
approaching the sides of the shell, and flow on the wing upper
surface continues to follow the wing down, at speeds up to
approximately 13 mm s−1. Maximum flow speeds reach 20 mm s−1
at t′=0.42 as the parapodia close along the sides of the shell, and this
flow continues to feed the leading edge vortex rings. The downward
impulse of flow created by the power stroke is evident at t′=0.48 (on
both sides of the pteropod). A new pair of oppositely signed vortices
beneath the pteropod is created by the interaction of these downward
pulses and the flow pulled upward beneath the pteropod shell. By
t′=0.52, the vortices, moving downward and away from the
pteropod at an angle of approximately 45 deg relative to vertical,
have separated from the shell and begun to decay.

 Recovery stroke
Flow fields detailing the recovery stroke are shown in Fig. 9. The
t′=0.52 time point is shown in both Figs 8 and 9 in order to illustrate
the three-dimensional nature of the flow. In the posterior plane
(Fig. 8), the downward flow pulse created at the end of the power
stroke moves outward away from the pteropod. In Fig. 9, the
downward flow pulse moves more vertically downward and curves
back up underneath the pteropod, likely because the parapodia
complete the power stroke by curling upward along the shell. The
shed leading edge vortices also are weaker and lower in the more
anterior plane. In addition, the vorticity patches bound to the pteropod
body in the anterior plane (Fig. 9) are not present in the posterior plane
(Fig. 8). At t′=0.74, the downward flow along the sides of the
pteropod resulting from the power stroke remains (and persists
throughout the recovery stroke). The parapodia are well into the
recovery stroke, and vorticity has formed on the parapodia’s upper
leading edges. These vortices grow slightly but remain attached to the
wings at t′=0.78. By t′=0.85, these leading edge vortices have
strengthened and separated from the parapodia. Downward flow from
the wingtips joins with the downward flow created by the power
stroke to strengthen the pre-existing vortices underneath the
parapodia. Similar to the power stroke, the rising pteropod pushes a
bow wave ahead, which curves around and downward to create an
elongated high vorticity region along the parapodia, a trend that
continues at t′=0.91. Also at t′=0.91, the shed leading edge vortex is
strengthened by the downward impulse from the recovery stroke.
These vortices subsequently decay and translate away from the
pteropod, as seen at t′=0.97, until, at the beginning of the next power
stroke, they resemble those vortices seen at t′=0.06 in Fig. 6.
DISCUSSION
Hyper-pitching
Limacina helicina generates its figure-of-eight wingtip trajectory in a
unique manner that has implications for micro aerial vehicle (MAV)
design. Figure-of-eight wingtip trajectories seen in flying insects
(Weis-Fogh,
1973)
and
shell-less
gymnosomatous
pteropods
(Satterlie et al., 1985; Borrell et al., 2005; Szymik and Satterlie,
2011) are accomplished by active elevation of the wingtip in
preparation for the next half-stroke. In L. helicina, the figure-of-eight
pattern is enabled by extreme rotation of the shell. This hyper-
pitching of 50–60 deg elevates the wingtips at the end of each
half-stroke in preparation for the next half-stroke and accounts for
25% and 51% of wing elevation at the beginning of the recovery and
power strokes, respectively. Limacina helicina’s round shell, with a
low moment of inertia and low rotational drag, naturally facilitatesthis
hyper-pitching whereas the elongated bodies of the gymnosomatous
pteropods have a greater moment of inertia and greater rotational drag
and thus experience correspondingly less body rotation (11 deg in
Clione antarctica) (Borrell et al., 2005). Such extreme pitching
during regular swimming or flying is rare, although Kiørboe et al.
(2010) found body pitching up to 55 deg in a jumping Acartia tonsa
copepod. Many insects fly with body angle oscillations of 3 deg or
less (Ellington, 1984a). Body kinematics are difficult to measure in
the tiny insects flying in the same Re range as L. helicina, but high-
speed videos show little variation in body angle with individual
wingbeats for thrips (Santhanakrishnan et al., 2014). In contrast,
Dudley (1990) found a much larger range for butterflies, with some
species attaining body angle oscillations of 49 deg. Indeed, Chang
and Yen (2012) compared the erratic flight of butterflies with the
swimming of L. helicina and suggested that, like butterflies,
pteropods may evade predators with their irregular trajectories
brought on by hyper-pitching. While pitching is typically avoided in
flapping MAV design and typical insect flight because of the
problems it poses for vehicle or animal stability and control, L.
helicina ‘flight’ suggests the opposite paradigm and that hyper-
pitching could be incorporated into future MAV designs to passively
provide aerodynamic benefits. However, difficulties in maintaining
control and stability and in gathering and integrating sensory
information while hyper-pitching need to be investigated further.
Flexible clap-and-fling: lift augmentation by the Weis-Fogh
mechanism
Similar to many small insect species, L. helicina uses a version of
the Weis-Fogh clap-and-fling mechanism to generate lift during its
power stroke (Fig. 6). The flow generated by the Weis-Fogh
mechanism has not previously been measured in a freely flying or
swimming animal despite being extensively studied for 40 years
(Weis-Fogh, 1973; Lighthill, 1973; Maxworthy, 1979; Ellington,
1984a,b; Spedding and Maxworthy, 1986; Dickinson et al., 1999;
Miller and Peskin, 2005; Lehmann et al., 2005; Kolomenskiy et al.,
2011). In the classic Weis-Fogh mechanism, the wings clap together
at the end of the recovery stroke and subsequently rotate apart in the
power stroke, with the trailing edge serving as a ‘hinge’. The
growing, V-shaped gap draws in fluid, initiating leading edge
vortices around each wing, thereby increasing circulation around
both wings and increasing lift (Weis-Fogh, 1973; Lighthill, 1973;
Maxworthy, 1979; Ellington, 1984a,b; Spedding and Maxworthy,
1986; Dickinson et al., 1999). As the pteropod’s wings only touch at
their tips and do not fully clap together at the end of the recovery
stroke,
however,
the
pteropod’s
wing
motions
are
better
characterized as a ‘near-fling’ or ‘touch-and-fling’ rather than a
clap-and-fling.
The flow fields captured here, with elongated leading edge
vortices forming and eventually shedding, show qualitative
agreement with dynamically scaled laboratory experiments and
with simulations of insect flight at similar Re (Maxworthy, 1979;
Spedding and Maxworthy, 1986; Miller and Peskin, 2005;
Lehmann et al., 2005; Kolomenskiy et al., 2011). However, the
spatial extent of the leading edge vortices relative to the wing size
appears larger in the dynamically scaled experiments than in
the current study (see Maxworthy, 1979). This observation may
have
important
ecological
consequences,
as
minimizing
a
‘hydrodynamic
footprint’
while
swimming
is
an
important
strategy for zooplankton to avoid predators, which often detect
their prey through flow disturbances (Yen, 2000; Kiørboe et al.,
2014). The distance between the wings at the beginning of the
power stroke may affect the scale of these vortices and the lift
augmentation from the Weis-Fogh mechanism.
A mid-span gap between the parapodia at the beginning of the
power stroke likely decreases lift augmentation from the Weis-Fogh
mechanism. This mid-span gap of approximately the shell width
(∼1 mm) results from lateral separation of the thick, fleshy wing
bases and from wing curvature during the stroke. The center-to-
center gap between the parapodia at their insertion point is
approximately 0.3 mm, and the wing thickness at the insertion
point is approximately 0.2 mm. The gap width decreases towards
the wingtips as the highly flexible parapodia curve inwards to meet
at their tips. Thus, in contrast to many insect species, the wings of
L. helicina do not lie parallel along their span at the beginning of the
fling (Chang and Yen, 2012). Lehmann et al. (2005) investigated the
importance of this gap between the wings in a dynamically scaled
model of a fruit fly by varying the lateral separation between the wing
hinges and the angular distance between the wings at the beginning
of the fling phase (α in this study). These authors found that
540

Journal of Experimental Biology
 increasing both of these parameters decreased the lift augmentation
due to clap-and-fling. Specifically, for minimum lateral separation
and initially parallel wings (α=0 deg), lift was enhanced 13.3%
compared with a case with only one wing (i.e. no interaction between
wings), whereas it was enhanced only about 4% for a greater lateral
separation for the same initial α. In the case of L. helicina, wing
separation likely also decreases the lift generated by clap-and-fling
by allowing inward flow from the wing edges, thereby decreasing the
strength and size of the leading edge vortices at the wingtips.
However, the lateral wing separation of L. helicina allows the
touching wings to angle inward and form a ‘canopy’ over its body. In
Lehmann et al. (2005), this canopy effect (called a ‘negative angular
distance’) is modeled for the greater lateral separation and led to a
further increase in clap-and-fling lift augmentation to 9% (again
compared with a one-wing case). Thus, though the gap between the
wings of L. helicina seems to decrease the hydrodynamic benefit of
the Weis-Fogh mechanism, this may be somewhat offset because of
the canopy effect. It should be noted that the canopy effect is not
represented in Fig. 7 (i.e. the minimum value of α is 0 deg) as only
one point between the parapodia bases (point A) was tracked.
The act of flinging apart closely apposed wings generates both
high lift and high drag forces. Using a 2D computational model,
Miller and Peskin (2005) found substantial drag forces involved in
rotating closely apposed wings apart during the fling. In addition,
Santhanakrishnan et al. (2014) varied the initial gap between
porous wings and found large increases in drag and only modest
increases in lift with more closely spaced wings. Thus, while the
mid-span gap between the wings of L. helicina at the beginning of
the fling likely decreases lift, this gap also likely reduces drag on
the wings during the fling, thus lowering the force requirements
on the animal. Furthermore, Miller and Peskin (2009) found that
adding flexibility to the wing reduced the drag forces while
maintaining lift forces during the fling. Jones et al. (2015)
similarly found that wing flexibility increased vertical force
production in a simulated, tilted wing stroke similar to that used by
L. helicina. Thus, the highly flexible parapodia of L. helicina also
may reduce drag while sustaining lift during the fling and
throughout the stroke.
It is difficult to estimate the relative importance of the Weis-
Fogh mechanism in enhancing lift for L. helicina. Lehmann et al.
(2005) measured lift enhancements of up to 17% for their
dynamically scaled Drosophila model, but this augmentation
depended greatly on lateral and angular wing separation and other
kinematic
parameters
(Lehmann
and
Pick,
2007).
Lift
augmentation by the Weis-Fogh mechanism is also dependent
on Reynolds number. The computational model of Miller and
Peskin (2005) shows increased lift enhancement with decreasing
Re, whereas the experimental results of Lehmann et al. (2005) do
not show a clear trend. Limacina helicina operates at a lower Re
than Drosophila, but L. helicina may also use other unsteady flow
techniques to increase lift production. For example, Chang and
Yen (2012) suggested that the clap of the parapodia against the
shell at the end of the power stroke could create thrust by
squeezing fluid downwards. Another possibility is that the
parapodia peeling away from the shell at the beginning of the
recovery stroke may generate lift. Occlusion by the shell and
parapodia
make
it
difficult
to
determine
whether
these
mechanisms are present in the current case.
Comparison with other planktonic gastropods
It is interesting to compare L. helicina swimming with that of the
shell-less pteropods Clione limacina and C. antarctica. As seen in
Table 2, the shell sizes of L. helicina in the current study are
substantially smaller than the body lengths of the gymnosomatous
pteropods. The swimming speeds of L. helicina are slower than
those of its predator C. limacina but faster than those of
C. antarctica. Accounting for body size, however, shows that
L. helicina, C. limacina and C. antarctica swim at maximum
normalized swimming speeds of approximately 13, 5 and 0.3 body
lengths s−1, respectively. The slower swimming speeds of
C. antarctica perhaps may be partially explained by the higher
viscosity of the cold, polar seawater. The wingbeat frequency of
L. helicina is also higher than those of the shell-less pteropods. The
faster normalized swimming speed and greater beat frequency of
L. helicina indicate that it is a more agile swimmer than its predator,
the shell-less C. limacina. The high beat frequency of L. helicina,
coupled with its extreme pitching angle, should enable it to
frequently change swimming direction. The resulting tortuous
swimming pathway may enable it to evade the larger, more slowly
stroking C. limacina that depends on tail bending to change
swimming direction (Satterlie et al., 1985).
The shell of L. helicina also plays a large role in its swimming
behavior. In addition to facilitating the hyper-pitching discussed
above, the shell’s weight obviously leads to a greater sinking speed
for L. helicina and a greater need for it to generate lift than for the
shell-less pteropods. The shell also ensures that the swimming

 appendages of L. helicina have closely spaced insertion points, a
morphological arrangement that allows this pteropod’s parapodia to
closely approach each other and perform the lift-enhancing Weis-
Fogh maneuver. The appendages of the shell-less pteropods, in
contrast, are located on opposite sides of its torpedo-shaped body and
cannot approach each other along their length. Satterlie et al. (1985)
posited that C. limacina peels its appendages away from its body in a
way that could create lift, but no flow measurements have been
performed on Clione to investigate its lift generation mechanisms.
Whereas we have shown that L. helicina mimics the lift-producing
kinematics and fluid dynamics of insects, the fluid dynamics of the
flow around the wings of the Clione species are essentially unknown.
The outcomes among studies of Clione swimming are contradictory,
with Satterlie et al. (1985) concluding that the wing movement of C.
limacina produces lift in both upstroke and downstroke, Borrell et al.
(2005) concluding that pteropods are poorly equipped to propel via
lift forces, and Szymik and Satterlie (2011) concluding that C.
limacina propulsion is provided by a combination of lift-based and
drag-based mechanisms. Flow measurements would be valuable in
resolving this uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS
Our measurements strongly indicate that L. helicina uniquely
employs lift-based swimming instead of drag-based swimming
used by nearly all zooplankton. This pteropod ‘flies’ underwater
by stroking its parapodia in a figure-of-eight trajectory at a high
angle of attack with an inclined stroke plane in much the same way
that tiny insects such as thrips and fruit flies fly in air. The wing
kinematic pattern is uniquely facilitated by L. helicina’s hyper-
pitching, which also may aid in evasion of predators. Moreover,
hyper-pitching offers an alternative vision for flapping MAV
design. In accordance with most flying animals, pitching
traditionally has been eschewed in favor of body stability, but
L. helicina demonstrates that extreme pitching, when integrated
with wing kinematics, may offer passive aerodynamic benefits.
Limacina helicina further earns its common name of ‘sea
butterfly’ by borrowing the Weis-Fogh mechanism from the
insect world as it performs a ‘near-fling’ maneuver to augment lift
generation during its power stroke. Though Gastropoda and
Insecta diverged 550 million years ago, L. helicina and flying
insects
swim
and
fly,
respectively,
in
similar
physical
environments (at least in terms of the balance of inertial and
viscous forces as quantified by Re) and employ similar wing
kinematics and fluid dynamic lift generation mechanisms.
Limacina helicina and tiny insects thus represent a remarkable
evolutionary convergence of locomotion techniques employed by
dissimilar animals that operate in a similar Re regime. Clione
species and other planktonic gastropods, which, like L. helicina,
are also fragile and difficult to study, may also use lift-based
locomotion and ought to be further investigated.
