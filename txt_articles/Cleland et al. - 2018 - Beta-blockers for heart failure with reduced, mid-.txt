Aims
Recent guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40–49%
should be managed similar to LVEF >
_ 50%. We investigated the effect of beta-blockers according to LVEF in
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

Methods
and results
Individual patient data meta-analysis of 11 trials, stratified by baseline LVEF and heart rhythm (Clinicaltrials.gov:
NCT0083244; PROSPERO: CRD42014010012). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death
over 1.3years median follow-up, with an intention-to-treat analysis. For 14 262 patients in sinus rhythm, median LVEF
was 27% (interquartile range 21–33%), including 575 patients with LVEF 40–49% and 244>
_ 50%. Beta-blockers reduced
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo in sinus rhythm, an effect that was consistent across LVEF
strata, except for those in the small subgroup with LVEF >
_ 50%. For LVEF 40–49%, death occurred in 21/292 [7.2%]
randomized to beta-blockers compared to 35/283 [12.4%] with placebo; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 0.34–1.03]. Cardiovascular death occurred in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-blockers and 26/283 [9.2%]
with placebo; adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24–0.97). Over a median of 1.0years following randomization (n = 4601),
LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups in sinus rhythm except LVEF>
_50%. For patients in atrial fibrillation at
baseline (n= 3050), beta-blockers increased LVEF when< 50% at baseline, but did not improve prognosis.

Conclusion
Beta-blockers improve LVEF and prognosis for patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm with a reduced LVEF.
The data are most robust for LVEF < 40%, but similar benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with LVEF
40–49%.

Introduction
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) show
that beta-blockers increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
and reduce morbidity and mortality for a broad range of patients with
a reduced LVEF in sinus rhythm.1,2 Until recently, international guide-
lines on heart failure have recognized two left ventricular phenotypes;
heart failure with reduced LVEF (HFrEF) or preserved LVEF
(HFpEF).3,4 Values for LVEF are continuously distributed but measure-
ment precision is imperfect; differences of up to 10% for an individual
patient may be attributed to measurement error5 and therefore pre-
cise cut-points of LVEF cannot reliably differentiate between pheno-
types. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) suggested
there should be a third intermediate phenotype, called mid-range
ejection fraction (HFmrEF; 40–49%), thereby creating a clear separa-
tion between HFrEF (<40%) and HFpEF (>
_50%).4 These guidelines
suggest that until more information becomes available, patients with
HFmrEF should be managed similarly to those with HFpEF, for which
no therapy has been shown to improve mortality.4
The Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group (BB-
meta-HF) was created to pool individual patient data (IPD) from the
major heart failure RCTs comparing beta-blockers and placebo to
address key issues in relevant patient subgroups.6 Most, but not all of
these trials recruited patients with an LVEF <
_35% predominantly in
sinus rhythm; IPD provides an opportunity to collate high-quality
data from double-blind trials on the smaller number of patients with
higher LVEF where the efficacy of beta-blockers is uncertain. Why
beta-blockers appear ineffective in patients with heart failure and
concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF),2,7,8 and whether this holds true
regardless of LVEF is also unclear. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of beta-blockers on LVEF and prognosis, stratified according to
the baseline LVEF and heart rhythm.
Methods
The Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group (BB-meta-HF)
includes the lead investigators from the relevant trials, with the support
of
the
four
pharmaceutical
companies
that
conducted
them
(AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Serono and Menarini). This
report was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) IPD guidance,9 and pro-
spectively registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0083244) and the
PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42014010012).10
Eligibility and search strategy
Detailed rationale and methods have previously been published.1,6,7 Only
unconfounded placebo-controlled trials were eligible that recruited >300
patients, with a planned follow-up of>6 months and explicit reporting of
mortality. All trials had appropriate ethical approval.
Eleven studies were included that account for 95.7% of eligible partici-
pants recruited in RCTs based on a systematic literature review: the
Australia/New Zealand Heart Failure Study (ANZ),11 the Beta-Blocker
Evaluation Survival Trial (BEST),12 the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival
Control in LV Dysfunction Study (CAPRICORN),13 the Carvedilol
Hibernating Reversible Ischaemia Trial: Marker of Success Study
(CHRISTMAS),14 the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS I),15 the
Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II),16 the Carvedilol
Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Study (COPERNICUS),17
the Metoprolol in Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy Study (MDC),18 the
Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart
Failure (MERIT-HF),19 the Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention
on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure
(SENIORS),20 and the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Program (US-HF).21
All included studies had low risk of bias, as determined using the
Cochrane Collaborations Risk of Bias Tool.22
Data collection and individual patient data
integrity
A standardized data request form to obtain IPD from each trial has been
published, along with search results and individual study demographics.6
IPD were obtained for all 11 trials identified in the systematic review, and
data were extracted from original source files provided by the pharma-
ceutical companies and lead investigators. All data were cross-checked
across different trial databases and compared with published reports.
Discrepancies, inconsistencies, and incomplete data were checked against
original case report forms and trial documentation to ensure IPD integ-
rity. All 11 trial databases were then harmonized according to the stand-
ardized data request form to match patient characteristics and outcomes
across all trials. Due to the small amount of missing data for relevant
covariates, imputation was not performed.
Participants
We included all patients with baseline LVEF and an electrocardiogram
(ECG) that showed either sinus rhythm or AF/atrial flutter (for the
purposes of this report, reference to AF therefore includes atrial flutter).
As we have already demonstrated an interaction of treatment effect with
heart rhythm,7 patients with sinus rhythm and AF were analysed separately.
Patients with heart block, or a paced rhythm at baseline were excluded.
Outcomes and effect measures
The primary outcomes for this analysis were all-cause mortality and car-
diovascular death, which included additional deaths reported after the
censor date for seven studies.19–21,23–26 Secondary outcomes were the
first cardiovascular hospitalization and the composite of cardiovascular
death and cardiovascular hospitalization (time to first event). All secon-
dary outcomes were based on events from the study period only and do
not include the MDC trial which did not collect this information. Three
patients (one with sinus rhythm and two with AF) had missing event dates
and were excluded from outcome analyses.

Most of the trials had limits for LVEF as inclusion or exclusion criteria,
however these were typically defined preceding randomization (<25%,17
<
_35%,12,16,21
<
_40%,13,15,18,19
and<45%;11
Supplementary
material
online, Figure S1). In this analysis, we used the baseline value of LVEF
recorded in individual patient case report forms or core laboratory
assessment, which in some patients was above the entry criterion accord-
ing to that particular study. LVEF was analysed as a continuous variable to
model interactions with outcomes, and classified as <20%, 20–25%, 26–
34%, 35–39%, 40–49%, and>
_50%, as well as <40%, 40–49%, >
_50% to
align with guideline phenotypes.
Statistical analysis
A statistical analysis plan was generated and finalized by the Collaborative
Group in advance of data analysis. Summary results are presented as per-
centages, or median and interquartile range (IQR; displayed as 25th–75th
quartiles).
All analyses followed the principle of intention-to-treat. Patients were
classified by heart rhythm and LVEF. Outcomes were analysed using a Cox
proportional hazards regression model,27 stratified by study. This is a one-
stage fixed effects approach and assumes that all trials are estimating a com-
mon treatment effect with baseline hazards that vary across studies.
Fractional polynomials were used to find the best transformation,28
although a linear relationship with mortality was the best fit. Hazard ratios
(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented, along with corre-
sponding P-values. We pre-specified adjustment in Cox models for age,
sex, systolic blood pressure, prior myocardial infarction, and baseline use of
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers,
and diuretic therapy. Adjustments for treatment allocation and LVEF were
also made where appropriate. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to graph the
pooled, unadjusted trial data, with log-rank tests for comparison stratified
by study. Only a minority of patients were followed for more than three
years and therefore data were censored at 1200days (3.3years) from ran-
domization. Pre-defined sensitivity analyses included additional multivari-
able adjustment [including diabetes, New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class (I/II vs. III/IV), estimated glomerular filtration rate and digoxin]; data are
not shown as these results did not differ with our main model. We per-
formed a post hoc sensitivity analysis which excluded patients with an LVEF
reported at exactly 40% from the 40–49% (mid-range) group. A post hoc
analysis of cardiovascular hospitalization accounting for the competing risk
of death was performed using the method of Fine and Gray23; results were
similar to the results of the stratified Cox regression model.
We show the association between baseline LVEF and all cause-
mortality by plotting the hazard of baseline LVEF relative to a baseline
LVEF of 35%, fitted using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model
stratified by study. Follow-up LVEF was available in six trials.11,12,14,18,20,21
We used the last available result to calculate change in LVEF from base-
line. As availability of follow-up LVEF is determined by survival, we chose
not to perform any statistical hypothesis testing.
There was no evidence of violation of the proportional hazards assump-
tion in any multivariable model as determined by Schoenfeld residuals.24
Effect modification was assessed using P-values from interaction terms fitted
in the multivariable models.28,29 A two-tailed P-value of 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. Analyses were performed on Stata Version 14.1
(StataCorp LP, TX, USA) and R Version 3.2.1 (R Core Team, Vienna).
Results
Individual patient data were obtained for 18637 patients. Patients were
excluded if they had a missing baseline ECG (n= 118), heart block
(n= 510), paced rhythm (n= 616) or were missing their baseline LVEF
(n= 91). The cohort included 14262 patients in sinus rhythm and 3050
patients in AF (Supplementary material online, Figure S1), with a mean
follow-up of 1.5years (standard deviation 1.1) and median follow-up of
1.3years (IQR 0.8–1.9). Median age was 65 (IQR 55–72)years, 24%
were women and 66% had ischaemic heart disease (IHD) as the cause
for heart failure. Median LVEF at baseline was 27% (21–33%) and was
similar for patients in sinus rhythm (Table 1) and AF (Supplementary
material online, Table S1). Combining both heart rhythms, 721 patients
had an LVEF 40–49% and 317 had an LVEF>
_50%. Patients with a
higher baseline LVEF were older, more likely to be women, have
milder NYHA class, higher blood pressure, and were less likely to have
heart failure due to IHD. There were no differences in patient charac-
teristics between those assigned to beta-blockers or placebo
(Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Association of LVEF with mortality
Left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was inversely associated
with all-cause mortality, with an adjusted HR of 1.16 for each 5%
lower LVEF (95% CI 1.26–1.19; P < 0.0001). Figure 1 displays the haz-
ard of all-cause mortality with LVEF 35% as the reference. The associ-
ation between LVEF and prognosis was stronger for patients in sinus
rhythm than AF (Supplementary material online, Table S3). Patients
with LVEF >
_50% had the lowest mortality despite their older age
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2); all-cause and cardiovascu-
lar mortality were 10.4% and 6.3% respectively for those with
LVEF >
_50%, compared to 26.7% and 21.7% for those with LVEF
<20%. Mortality was predominantly cardiovascular regardless of aeti-
ology, both for patients in sinus rhythm (Supplementary material
online, Table S4) and AF (Supplementary material online, Table S5),
and mostly attributed to sudden death or worsening heart failure.
Efficacy of beta-blockers
Beta-blockers were associated with reductions in all-cause and cardi-
ovascular mortality compared to placebo for patients in sinus rhythm

(interaction P > 0.5 for LVEF as a continuous measure). Beta-blockers
were effective in all LVEF categories, except in the small subgroup
where LVEF was >
_50% (Table 2, Figure 2). There was no evidence for
a difference in benefit when LVEF was 40–49%; all-cause mortality
occurred in 21/292 [7.2%] randomized to a beta-blockers compared
to 35/283 [12.4%] assigned to placebo (adjusted HR 0.59, 95% CI
0.34–1.03), and cardiovascular death in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-
blockers and 26/283 [9.2%] with placebo; (adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI
0.24–0.97) (Figure 3). Beta-blockers reduced both sudden death and
deaths ascribed to heart failure for patients in sinus rhythm, but had
no effect on non-cardiovascular mortality (Supplementary material
online, Table S4). Secondary outcomes (cardiovascular hospitalization
and the composite of cardiovascular death and cardiovascular hospi-
talization) were lower with beta-blockers in all LVEF categories for
patients in sinus rhythm, but confidence intervals were wide when
LVEF exceeded 40% (Table 2, Figure 2).
Patients with AF at baseline demonstrated no consistent benefit on
clinical outcomes with beta-blockers, regardless of LVEF (Figure 4).
Fewer patients and events reduced the power to identify or refute
modest differences in outcome.
Change in LVEF
Change in LVEF was measured in 4601 patients in sinus rhythm and
996 patients in AF who survived to a follow-up assessment (median
1.0 years after baseline; IQR 0.3–2.0) (Supplementary material online,
Figure S3). In sinus rhythm, LVEF increased more in patients random-
ized to beta-blockers than placebo, unless LVEF was>
_50% at baseline
(Table 3, Figure 5). Increases in LVEF with beta-blockers were smaller
for patients with IHD as the cause for heart failure compared to non-
ischaemic cardiomyopathy (Supplementary material online, Table S6).
Beta-blockers also increased LVEF for patients in AF in most LVEF cat-
egories except >
_50% (Table 3, Figure 5).
Discussion
This analysis suggests that for patients with heart failure in sinus
rhythm, the effect of beta-blockers on mortality in patients with LVEF
40–49% is similar to that observed with LVEF < 40%. Consistent with
the outcome data, LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups,
except those with LVEF >
_50%. Only the SENIORS trial20 intention-
ally enrolled patients with any LVEF, but despite showing efficacy for
beta-blockers in those with LVEF> 35%,25 there were too few
patients and events to draw any conclusions in patients with more
preserved LVEF. The lower the LVEF, the higher the rate of adverse
outcomes and therefore the benefit of beta-blockers might be
expected to be greatest in those with lower LVEF, as seen in a sub-
group analysis of the MERIT-HF trial.26 However, we demonstrate a
substantial 4.7% absolute reduction in cardiovascular mortality in
patients with LVEF 40–49% and sinus rhythm (number needed to

treat to prevent one cardiovascular death = 21 during a median
follow-up of 1.3 years). This finding was statistically significant despite
the relatively low number of trial patients studied in this LVEF cate-
gory. Our preference in statistical analysis is always to report the
interaction of treatment effect across continuous variables such as
LVEF, instead of relying on efficacy in subgroups. However in this
case, the data are dominated by patients with LVEF< 40% and inter-
action tests are known to have low power.30 Similar improvements
in LVEF were seen for those in AF, but this did not translate into bet-
ter outcomes with beta-blockers for patients in AF.
The mechanisms by which beta-blockers exert benefit are uncer-
tain.2 Blocking adrenergic receptors has direct effects on cardiomyo-
cytes, reduces heart rate, alters vascular function, and modifies the
neuro-endocrine response to heart failure.31 The importance of
these mechanisms may vary by aetiology, left ventricular phenotype,
heart rhythm and clinical indication. For example, beta-blockers are
recommended for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and pre-
vention of ventricular fibrillation in the context of an acute coronary
syndrome,32 but may have deleterious effects compared to other
therapy in hypertension or non-cardiac surgery.33 An improvement
in LVEF is usually considered evidence of therapeutic benefit, but this
analysis suggests we should be cautious about making such assump-
tions. The increase in LVEF with beta-blockers was smaller for
patients with IHD, but the benefit on mortality was similar to those
with a non-ischaemic cause for heart failure. The increase in LVEF
with beta-blockers was similar for patients in sinus rhythm and AF,
yet those with AF obtained no benefit on morbidity or mortality. The
underlying reasons for this discrepancy remains a subject of discus-
sion,4,8 and the increase in both incidence and prevalence of AF34
highlights a growing unmet clinical and research need.
Recent guidelines from the ESC suggest that left ventricular dys-
function should be classified as HFrEF when LVEF is <40%, HFmrEF
when 40–49% and HFpEF only when LVEF is 50% or greater.4 The
guideline points out that trials have, until recently, mostly used an
LVEF of 40% or 45% to define HFpEF and none have identified an
intervention that reduced morbidity or mortality for such patients.4
Accordingly, the guideline recommends that patients with HFmrEF
be managed in the same way as HFpEF until new evidence becomes
available. Interestingly, a post hoc analysis of the Treatment of
Preserved cardiac function heart failure with an Aldosterone antago-
nist Trial (TOPCAT) also suggested a reduction in cardiovascular
mortality with spironolactone in patients with an investigator-
recorded LVEF 45–49%, but not when LVEF was greater than this.35
Initial data from the Candesartan in Heart failure—Assessment of
moRtality and Morbidity (CHARM) program of trials suggests that
angiotensin inhibition has a similar benefit in patients with LVEF 40–
49% as with< 40%.36 In line with our data, it is possible that future
guideline recommendations for patients with this intermediate phe-
notype should be more similar to those for HFrEF than HFpEF, and
that the threshold for differences in heart failure therapy should be
at, or around, an LVEF of 50%.
This analysis has limitations, with varied design and objectives of
the component trials and relatively sparse outcome data for patients
with LVEF >40%. The distribution of LVEF was not normal due to the
inclusion criteria of the component RCTs; although the 40–49%
group was weighted towards the lower end of mid-range LVEF, we
found that primary outcomes were reduced in this group in sinus

rhythm even when excluding those with an LVEF of 40%. In any trial,
there is concern about whether the patients enrolled reflect the pop-
ulation encountered in clinical practice due to selection criteria, and
this analysis is no different. However, our data represent the vast
majority of patients enrolled in double-blind RCTs of beta-blockers.
Our use of individual-patient baseline LVEF, rather than the
screening LVEF that qualified for inclusion, meant that most trials
contributed some data to the LVEF 40–49% group. Although the
SENIORS trial, with a distinct type of beta-blocker, was the only RCT
to specifically recruit patients with higher LVEF, it only accounted for
44% of patients in this category. In trials of HFrEF, LVEF measured in
a core echocardiography laboratory will exceed the LVEF inclusion
criterion in 20–40% of patients.37–40 Some of the differences
between the core laboratory and investigators may be explained by
measurement error, but there also appears to be a bias on the part
of investigators, conscious or unconscious, towards measuring an
LVEF that allows for patient inclusion. Regression towards the mean
will also result in repeat measures being less extreme; thus our
approach of using double-blind data will have reduced, but not elimi-
nated measurement bias and inadvertent misclassification. Both in
research trials and clinical practice, measurements such as LVEF have
inherent variability that requires clinical review and oversight.
Reported measurements such as blood pressure and LVEF are
prone to digit preference (e.g. 40% rather than 39%) and variability in
timing, technique, and quantification. The impact of this can be lessened
by including a large amount of raw data (see Supplementary material
online, Figure S3) or by using, where available, software generated LVEF
(e.g. by Teichholz or Simpson’s biplane method) rather than an ‘eyeball’
assessment. Patients who died had no follow-up LVEF and therefore
this could have introduced bias in measured changes in LVEF.
Determination of LVEF may be less accurate for patients in AF due
to variability in cardiac cycle length.41 The smaller number of patients
with AF, although large in comparison to many published interven-
tional trials,42 limits our ability to make detailed comparisons to
patients in sinus rhythm. Finally, data on natriuretic peptides, diastolic
ventricular filling dynamics and atrial structure and function were
lacking, which often help to describe different heart failure
phenotypes.

Conclusion
For patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm and LVEF <40%, beta-
blockers improve left ventricular systolic function and reduce cardio-
vascular morbidity and mortality. These benefits also apply to
patients with LVEF 40–49%, a group in which beta-blocker therapy
seems more likely to help than to harm. No benefit was seen in
patients with LVEF>
_50%, but too few patients have been studied in
double-blind RCTs to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy or safety

benefit was observed for patients with heart failure and concomitant

Acknowledgements
We are indebted to the other members of the Beta-blockers in
Heart Failure Collaborative Group for database access and extraction
support (for full list, please see design paper6), the steering commit-
tees of the included trials (in particular representatives of the MERIT-
HF trial), as well as the late Philip Poole-Wilson (1943–2009; Imperial
College, London, UK). This work is dedicated to the memory of
Henry Krum (1958–2015; Monash University Melbourne, Australia),
one of the founding members of the Collaborative Group. This proj-
ect was only possible with the support of the pharmaceutical compa-
nies that have marketed beta-blockers in heart failure, and the group
wishes to extend their gratitude to AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline,
Menarini Farmaceutica and Merck Serono for full access to trial data.
We gratefully acknowledge incorporation of data from the BEST trial
through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute BioLINCC
programme.

Figure 5 Observed change in LVEF in survivors. Change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline in patients who survived to fol-
low-up, with median time between measurements of 1.0 years (interquartile range 0.3–2.0 years). Those with follow-up LVEF were older in age com-
pared to those without follow-up LVEF [67 (IQR 56–74) vs. 64 (55–71) years, respectively], but with similar baseline LVEF [27% (20–33) vs. 27%
(21–33)] and frequency of ischaemic cardiomyopathy (65% vs. 67%). The variance for each category of change in LVEF (beta-blockers vs. placebo) is
presented in Table 3. (A) Sinus rhythm; n ¼ 4, 601 patients. (B) Atrial fibrillation; n ¼ 996.
