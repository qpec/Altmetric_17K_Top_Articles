IMPORTANCE Preclinical studies show that arginine deprivation is synthetically lethal in
argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1)-negative cancers, including mesothelioma. The role of
the arginine-lowering agent pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) has not been
evaluated in a randomized and biomarker-driven study among patients with cancer.
OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical impact of arginine depletion in patients with ASS1-deficient
malignant pleural mesothelioma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Amulticenterphase2randomizedclinicaltrial,theArgi-
nineDeiminaseandMesothelioma(ADAM)study,wasconductedbetweenMarch2,2011,and
May21,2013,at8academiccancercenters.Immunohistochemicalscreeningof201patients
(2011-2013)identified68withadvancedASS1-deficientmalignantpleuralmesothelioma.
INTERVENTIONS Randomization 2:1 to arginine deprivation (ADI-PEG20, 36.8 mg/m2, weekly
intramuscular) plus best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS)
assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (target hazard
ratio, 0.60). Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), tumor response rate, safety,
and quality of life, analyzed by intention to treat. We measured plasma arginine and citrulline
levels, anti–ADI-PEG20 antibody titer, ASS1 methylation status, and metabolic response by
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography.
RESULTS Median(range)follow-upin68adults(median[range]age,66[48-83]years;19%
female)was38(2.5-39)months.ThePFShazardratiowas0.56(95%CI,0.33-0.96),witha

T
he incidence of malignant pleural mesothelioma is in-
creasing in many parts of the world, with a median sur-
vival from diagnosis of less than 12 months.1 The US and
Europeanmesotheliomaincidenceof3000and5000casesper
year, respectively, reflects a continuing population at risk.
Developing countries will be affected similarly as a result of
widespread use of asbestos.2 Systemic treatment is by means
of platinum and antifolate chemotherapy.3,4 Therapeutic
advances have stalled for more than a decade.5
To our knowledge, we were the first to show that an ex-
ogenous supply of the amino acid arginine is critical for the
survival of mesothelioma cell lines displaying loss of the urea
cycleandargininebiosyntheticenzymeargininosuccinatesyn-
thetase 1 (ASS1).6 Arginine is essential for biosynthesis of pro-
teins, nitric oxide, and polyamines and contributes to proline
and glutamate production.7 A wide therapeutic window ex-
ists because exogenous arginine is dispensable for normal cells
duetoASS1expression,whereasitssupplyisessentialforASS1-
negative cancers.8 Tumors deficient in ASS1 display in-
creased tumorigenesis due to diversion of the precursor as-
partate for enhanced pyrimidine synthesis.9,10 Loss of the
tumor suppressor ASS1 in mesothelioma cell lines, due partly
to epigenetic silencing, was observed in 63% of archival me-
sotheliomas by immunohistochemical analysis, warranting
therapeutic stratification of an arginine–depleting agent.6
Various ASS1-negative tumors have been shown to be sen-
sitive to the arginine depleters, mycoplasmal-derived peg-
ylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) and recombinant hu-
man arginases, in preclinical studies.11,12 This led to several
argininedeprivationstudiesinpatientswithhepatocellularcar-
cinoma and melanoma with single-agent ADI-PEG20, show-
ing low toxicity and evidence of efficacy.13-16 A phase 3 regis-
trationtrialinpatientswithhepatocellularcancer,atumorwith
frequent ASS1 deficiency, is ongoing.17
We report the first prospectively biomarker-driven, ran-
domized trial of ADI-PEG20 in patients with cancer (mesothe-
lioma), the Arginine Deiminase and Mesothelioma (ADAM)
study. We hypothesized that exogenous arginine is a critical
amino acid for ASS1-deficient mesothelioma and that arginine
deprivation would improve progression-free survival (PFS).
Methods
Patients
From March 2, 2011, to May 21, 2013, we screened 201 pa-
tients. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old with histo-
logical evidence of advanced ASS1-deficient malignant pleu-
ral mesothelioma (defined by >50% low expressor cells; BD
Biosciences ASS1 antibody, 1:500 dilution with the BioGenex
Super Sensitive Polymer-IHC Detection System and human
liver controls); measurable disease by modified Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria18; East-
ern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0 or 1, and life expectancy of at least 3 months; adequate
bone marrow, hematologic, hepatic, and renal function; and
gave written, informed consent. Patients who had received
prior platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible after pro-
gression. A rebiopsy was permitted for ASS1 reassessment if a
prechemotherapy baseline biopsy was ASS1 positive (n = 13).
Study Design
Randomized phase 2 nonblinded trial conducted across 8 can-
cer centers in the UK Clinical Research Network, after multi-
center ethics approval (see trial protocol in Supplement 1).
Randomization
Patientswereenrolledbyresearchnurses.Randomization(2:1)
and allocation concealment was performed by telephoning the
Trials Center, where a computer program (generated by a pro-
grammer without further involvement in the trial) allocated
patients to a treatment arm using minimization, stratified ac-
cording to sex, sarcomatoid or nonsarcomatoid subtype, che-
monaive or prior chemotherapy, and hospital.
Treatment and Procedures
Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive a weekly in-
tramuscular injection of ADI-PEG20 (36.8 mg/m2) for up to 6
months(cycles)intothebuttockplusbestsupportivecare(BSC),
orBSCalone.Patientscontinuedtoreceivestudytreatment,with
regular blood sampling, until disease progression, withdrawal
of consent, or unacceptable toxic effects. ADI-PEG20–treated
patients with disease control were allowed to exceed 6 cycles.
Chemotherapy-naive patients were offered chemotherapy on
progression. Patients receiving BSC alone were not allowed to
cross over to ADI-PEG20. Computed tomographic scans were
scheduled at the end of month 2, 4, 6, end of treatment, and 6
months after finishing treatment. Quality-of-life question-
naires were scheduled at baseline, then at the end of 2 and 4
months, and end of treatment. We also collected survival data
on patients with low ASS1 expression who were not random-
ized, and from ASS1-positive patients (“high expressor”; ≤50%
low expressor cells) who were not eligible for randomization.
Outcomes
The primary end point was PFS, measured from the random-
ization date to first progression or death from any cause. Pro-
gression was assessed by means of imaging (modified RECIST)
and examined by blinded central review (which matched the
local review in 65 patients; in the other 3, the progression date
was judged to be earlier than the local review). Secondary end
points were overall survival (OS), response rate, toxicity, and
Key Points
Question What is the effect of arginine deprivation in patients
with argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1)-deficient malignant
pleural mesothelioma?
Findings In this phase 2 randomized clinical trial of 68 patients
with ASS1-deficient mesotheliomas, arginine deprivation with
pegylated arginine deiminase led to improved progression-free
survival compared with patients receiving best supportive care.
Meaning Arginine deprivation with pegylated arginine deiminase
warrants further clinical investigation in patients with
ASS1-deficient malignant mesothelioma.

quality of life using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale.19 Explor-
atory additional end points included plasma concentrations of
arginine (and duration of arginine deprivation), citrulline, and
anti–ADI-PEG20 antibodies, the methylation status of the ASS1
gene using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip array, and metabolic response as assessed by
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography
(FDG-PET)inpatientsreceivingADI-PEG20.20-23Plasmasamples
were planned weekly during treatment for ADI-PEG20
patients and at weeks 9, 17, 25 for BSC-alone patients.
Statistical Analysis
The target sample size was 66 patients (2:1 allocation), based
ondetectingahazardratio(HR)of0.60,assumingamedianPFS
of 4.5 months with BSC alone, 80% power, and 15% 1-sided sta-
tistical significance (phase 2 studies typically use 10%-20%).
Time-to-event end points were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier
curves,thelog-ranktest,andCoxregression,allmeasuredfrom
the date of randomization, and by intention to treat (SAS, ver-
sion 9.3). P values for OS and PFS were either 1 sided (consis-
tentwiththedesign;significancelevel,.15),or2sided(tobecon-
servative)andareindicatedthroughout;allotherPvalueswere
2 sided. For PFS, an event was modified RECIST progression
(using the central review) or death from any cause, and those
without an event were censored when last seen alive (ie, seen
in clinic). Overall survival, but not PFS, violated the propor-
tional hazards assumption, so we also estimated the restricted
mean survival time, a measure of life expectancy or mean sur-
vival (calculated as the area under each Kaplan-Meier curve).24
Overall survival was also compared (Kaplan-Meier curves, log-
rank test, and restricted mean survival times) between all reg-
istered patients who had BSC only and either low or high ASS1
expression,andthecontrolgroupintherandomizedtrial,where
OS was measured from the date of study registration. The pur-
poseherewastoexaminetheassociationbetweenASS1expres-
sionasaprognosticmarkerforsurvivalinpatientsreceivingthe
same care. Toxic effects were based on the maximum National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events toxicity grade for each patient and event. Quality of life
was examined as the difference in scores between baseline and
each of 2 and 3 months after randomization (Wilcoxon test). To
examine how within-patient arginine levels change over time
and how this correlates with PFS, a time-varying Cox regres-
sion was used (model containing only PFS and the individual
plasma levels for each patient where available). The Spearman
correlation was used to examine the relationship between the
duration of arginine depletion and PFS.
Results
A total of 201 patients were registered, with 97 (48%) identi-
fied as being ASS1 deficient; 70 were randomized, but 2 were
found to be ineligible (ECOG 2 and nonevaluable disease by
modified RECIST) (Figure 1). The main analyses were on 24 pa-
tients who received BSC alone and 44 who received ADI-
PEG20 + BSC; median follow-up was 38 months (range, 2.5-39
months). Overall, 4 of 9 (44%) patients with prior exposure to
platinum-antifolate chemotherapy were rescreened and dis-
played ASS1 deficiency on tumor rebiopsy compared with the
baseline tumor. Baseline patient characteristics were bal-
anced (Table 1).

Adherence to ADI-PEG20 Treatment
Nineteen of 44 (43%) patients completed 2 4-week cycles of
ADI-PEG20, and 10 (23%) had at least 6 cycles (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2). Twenty-two (50%) patients had at least 9 in-
jections in total. Only 2 patients missed 1 week’
s dose during
the treatment period; and 2 patients had a lower than target
dose based on their body surface area (1 patient had 51% of the
full dose for 1 injection out of 7 received in total; 1 patient had
49% of the full dose for 4 injections out of 8 in total. Eight pa-
tients stopped ADI-PEG20 treatment early: 4 due to toxic ef-
fects, 3 because of a clinical decision, and 1, a patient deci-
sion (unrelated to toxic effects).
Efficacy
No partial or complete radiological responses were observed.
Among patients who had evaluable disease at 4 months (using
modifiedRECIST),thebestresponsewasstablediseaseassessed
by central review: 12 of 23 (52%) in the ADI-PEG20 + BSC group
vs 2 of 9 (22%) in the BSC group (Fisher exact 2-tailed P = .23).

Sixty-six of 68 (97%) patients had a PFS event. Two
patients allocated to BSC alone withdrew soon after random-
ization because they wanted chemotherapy and so were cen-
sored at the date of withdrawal. The median PFS in the ADI-
PEG20 group was 3.2 (interquartile range, 1.8-5.5) months vs
2.0(interquartilerange,1.8-3.6)monthsintheBSC-alonegroup,
with HR of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.33-0.96; P = .03 [1-sided P = .02]),
which was close to our target of 0.60 (Figure 2). The 6-month
PFS rate was 18% vs 0%, acknowledging the small number of
patients (10 patients at risk at this time point).
Sixty-fourof68(94%)patientshaddiedatthetimeofdata-

years, before dying between 27 and 29 months, compared with
10 ADI-PEG20 patients, of whom 4 were still alive as of
August 2015 (survived 32-38 months). The median OS in the
ADI-PEG20 group was 11.5 (IQR, 4.2-22.9) months vs 11.1 (IQR,

only 2 patients had sarcomatoid) was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.25-0.86). A test for
proportional hazards produced P = .30 for PFS and P = .02 for OS. The
restricted mean survival times (life expectancy) for PFS were 4.1 months for the
pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) group vs 2.7 months for the best

6.9-14.2) months in the BSC-alone group, with HR of 0.68 (95%
CI, 0.39-1.16; P = .15 [1-sided P = .08]) (Figure 2). However, the
proportionalhazardsassumptionfailed(P = .02),andananaly-
sis of restricted mean survival times produced a measure of
lifeexpectancyof15.7monthsintheADI-PEG20groupand12.1
months in the BSC group, that is, an increase of 3.6 months
(95% CI, −1.0 to 8.1 months; P = .13 [1-sided P = .06]). We could
not explain why the curves crossed; it could be a spurious fea-
ture within a phase 2 trial of limited size.
Prespecified subgroup analyses for sex and prior chemo-
therapy did not show a differential treatment effect for either
PFS or OS (eFigures 2 and 3 in Supplement 2). Among patients
who had prior chemotherapy, the PFS HR for ADI-PEG20 treat-
ment was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.26-1.14), compared with 0.60 (95%
CI, 0.27-1.37) for chemotherapy-naive patients, with corre-
sponding OS HRs of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.33-1.43) vs 0.60 (95% CI,
0.26-1.40) (interaction P = .95 for PFS and .56 for OS).
The beneficial effect of ADI-PEG20 treatment seemed
greatest for patients with an ASS1 loss of greater than 75%, vs
50% to 75% (PFS HRs of 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.70] vs 0.72 [95%
CI, 0.34-1.49], interaction P = .21; and OS HRs of 0.25 [95% CI,
0.08-0.82] vs 0.64 [95% CI, 0.30-1.37], interaction P = .16)
(Figure 3); statistical significance of the interaction was not
reached because of insufficient power for this particular analy-
sis. Moreover, ASS1 loss of expression was associated with sig-
nificanthypomethylation(P = .02;regularizedttest)atasingle
CpG site of the ASS1 gene in intron 1, whereas methylation
changes were not detected at the ASS1 promoter in the clini-
cal samples (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2).
We compared OS from the BSC-alone patients (ASS1 nega-
tive/“low expressors”) in the randomized trial with nonran-
domized ASS1-positive (“high expressors”) or ASS1-negative
patients(eFigure5inSupplement2).ThenonrandomizedASS1-
negative patients had worse OS, whereas the OS curves for the

There were 46 patients with 50% to 75% loss and 20 with 76% to 100% loss;
data were unavailable for 2 patients. Interaction test between ASS1 loss group
and treatment group resulted in P = .21 for PFS and 0.16 for OS. Restricted mean
survival times (OS) for ASS1 loss of 75% or less were 12.8 months in the
pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) group and 10.5 months in the best
supportive care (BSC) group. The P values in the figure are all 2 sided (1-sided P

BSC-alone group vs ASS1-positive patients separated after 12
months, in favor of the latter group. The restricted mean sur-
vival times were 8.8, 17.0, and 12.7 months for the ASS1-
negative (nonrandomized), ASS1-positive, and ASS1-negative
(randomized) groups, respectively. These data support the ob-
servation that ASS1 status is prognostic, that is, ASS1-positive
patients tend to have better survival compared with ASS1-
negative patients. The lower survival among nonrandomized
ASS1-negative patients is likely due to having poor prognosis
at baseline, which would have been why they were consid-
ered inappropriate for the trial.
Safety and Quality of Life
Forty of 44 (91%) in the ADI-PEG20 group vs 14 of 24 (58%) in
the BSC-alone group had any reported grade 1 to 4 adverse
event (P = .001), but mostly grade 1 or 2 (Table 2). There was
no statistically significant difference in grade 3 or 4 events (13
of 44 [30%] vs 4 of 24 [17%]; P = .24); neither was there any
difference in the incidence of physical and/or symptomatic
grade 3 or 4 events (ie, excluding abnormal biochemical and
hematological test results) (11 [25%] vs 4 [17%]; P = .43) for the
ADI-PEG20 vs BSC alone group, respectively. Specific events
more common in the ADI-PEG20 group were neutropenia, gas-
trointestinal problems (eTable in Supplement 2), fatigue/
lethargy, injection site reactions, and grade 3 events for 4 pa-
tientswithanaphylaxis,and2withserumsickness.Thesehave
been associated previously with ADI-PEG20 treatment, ex-
cept serum sickness, which responded readily to steroid
therapy. Fewer events were considered to be causally related
to ADI-PEG20 by the treating clinician (Table 2), leading to a
determination of 57% (25 of 44) in the ADI-PEG20 group vs 4%
(1 of 24) in the BSC-alone group with any reported grade 1 to 4
event, and 16% (7 of 44) vs 0 with any physical grade 3 or 4
event. Quality of life (patient self-assessment and observer as-
sessment) was generally similar between treatment groups at
2 and 3 months after randomization; importantly, ADI-PEG20–
treated patients did not have noticeably worse quality of life
for any domain (eFigures 6-7 in Supplement 2).
Pharmacodynamics
To validate the pharmacodynamic effects of ADI-PEG20, we
compared plasma arginine and citrulline levels in the 2 arms
of the study. As expected, ADI-PEG20 treatment (42 of 44 with
samples) led to a rapid decrease in arginine level following the
first dose (levels were <0.12 mg/dL by week 2 in almost all pa-
tients [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 57.05]),
with a reciprocal increase in plasma citrulline level, whereas
little change was seen in BSC-alone patients (21 of 24 with
samples) (eFigure 8 in Supplement 2). In 27 ADI-PEG20 pa-
tients, arginine levels increased by the third cycle due to the
emergence of neutralizing anti–ADI-PEG20 antibodies (eFig-
ure 8 in Supplement 2), while levels remained low in 15 pa-
tients. From a time-varying Cox regression analysis, for every
increase in arginine level of 0.35 mg/dL, the risk of progress-
ing or dying also increased: PFS HR in the BSC-alone group was
1.66 (95% CI, 1.06-2.60; P = .02), in the ADI-PEG20 group was

1.11 (95% CI, 0.97-1.27; P = .13), and for all patients (adjusted
for treatment group) was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.99-1.28; P = .06). The
effect was strongest in the BSC-alone group, whose arginine
levels were not depleted.
We found a positive moderate correlation between
duration of arginine deprivation and PFS among 27 patients
in whom the arginine concentration became low after treat-
ment with ADI-PEG20 but later increased (to ≥40% of the
patient’
s baseline value; Spearman correlation of 0.38;
P = .05) (eFigure 9 in Supplement 2). The association was
strongest among 15 patients in whom arginine levels
remained low (<0.11 mg/dL; correlation, 0.93; P < .001).
Among 21 BSC-alone patients, there was an expected nega-
tive correlation between baseline arginine level and PFS
(−0.27), although not statistically significant (P = .24) (eFig-
ure 9 in Supplement 2). On disease progression with ADI-
PEG20 treatment at 8 months, 1 patient underwent a
repeated biopsy, which revealed a continuing absence of
ASS1 expression (eFigure 10 in Supplement 2).
Poststudy Treatments
Fourteen (32%) ADI-PEG20 patients received further treat-
ments other than ADI-PEG20: 8 received platinum/
pemetrexed disodium; 2, vinorelbine tartrate; 1, gemcitabine
hydrochloride/platinum;1,irinotecanhydrochloride/cisplatin/
mitomycin; and 2, unknown treatment. These were known to
be after progression in all 12 patients for whom treatment dates
were recorded. Four patients who had stable disease contin-
ued ADI-PEG20 treatment beyond the 6-month study treat-
ment period.
Eleven (46%) BSC-alone patients received systemic
therapy: 3 received platinum/pemetrexed; 3, carboplatin
plus either gemcitabine or vinorelbine; and 5, unknown
treatment. These were known to be after progression in 8
patients and before progression in 1 patient with treatment
dates available.
Discussion
Our phase 2 trial shows that depletion of the nonessential
amino acid arginine in ASS1-deficient mesothelioma
reduced progression times in patients with advanced dis-
ease, warranting further investigation. The PFS HR (0.56)
represents a 44% reduction in the risk of progressing and/or
dying, a clinically important effect for patients with
advanced cancers with a poor prognosis. Also, it was close
to that expected (HR, 0.60), with a 1-sided P = .02), which
was well within that specified in the design (P = .15). The
improvement in median PFS from 2.0 to 3.2 months scores
33 (out of a maximum of 55) using the American Society of
Clinical Oncology assessment framework.25
Early-phase clinical studies of ADI-PEG20 treatment in
melanoma and liver cancer have completed, but without
biomarker selection on the premise that these tumors dis-
play a high degree of ASS1 loss. In contrast, our analysis
showed that ASS1 loss is lower than the 63% frequency
derived from tissue microarray studies and, at 48% loss in
ADAM, reflects sampling and heterogeneity of expression.6
The PFS HR of 0.56 in favor of ADI-PEG20 supports the pre-
selected 50% threshold for ASS1 loss, although determining
the treatment benefit from ADI-PEG20 with different levels
of enzyme expression will require larger studies. We
observed a greater advantage among patients with tumors
with at least 75% ASS1 deficiency, with an HR of 0.25, indi-
cating that biomarkers may enable targeting arginine depri-
vation for cancer therapy. Moreover, hypomethylation
within the ASS1 gene body, rather than methylation at the
ASS1 transcription start site, was linked to the loss of ASS1
protein in mesothelioma (P = .02). Whereas several cell line
studies show good correlation between methylation at the
ASS1 promoter and inactivation of ASS1 expression, our
findings indicate that gene-body hypomethylation appears
to be a more robust biomarker in clinical mesothelioma
samples, consistent with other work.26
Intriguingly, in 4 of 9 (44%) rebiopsied patients, we
noted a subsequent decrease in ASS1 expression, illustrating
a potential role for arginine deprivation with disease
progression in those treated previously with chemotherapy.
As mesothelioma enters a more accelerated phase, ASS1
loss may increase tumor cell proliferation and invasion as
seen in several translational studies of ASS1-deficient
tumors.9,10,27,28 Further prospective studies could validate
this hypothesis.
Our study also highlights that despite ASS1 biomarker se-
lection, 48% of ADI-PEG20–treated patients experienced dis-
ease progression by the first 8-week scan, indicating early re-
sistance. This group included 8 patients who had an initial
metabolic partial response within the first month of treat-
ment. Moreover, the overall partial metabolic response rate of
46% is almost double the rate recorded in a recent melanoma
trial, indicating that mesothelioma is particularly sensitive to
ADI-PEG20.29 We found that PFS increased with the duration
of arginine deprivation, as reported in a study of liver cancer
patients.16 Apart from neutralizing antibodies mediating re-
sistance to ADI-PEG20, alternative explanations include re-
expression of ASS1, which has been observed in cell line stud-
iesandinpatientswithmelanomatreatedwithADI-PEG20.30,31
However, on rebiopsy of a progressing patient after 8 months
of ADI-PEG20 treatment, there was no evidence of ASS1 reex-
pression (eFigure 10 in Supplement 2). Alternative resistance
mechanisms may be operational, including autophagy and ac-
tivation of alternate metabolic pathways, which are under
investigation.32,33
Notably, ADI-PEG20 potentiates antifolate cytotoxicity
specifically in ASS1-negative tumor cell lines.28 Following
ADAM, we have initiated the first triplet phase 1 study com-
bining ADI-PEG20 with pemetrexed/cisplatin in patients
with mesothelioma and nonsquamous non–small-cell lung
cancer deficient for ASS1 (NCT02029690). Preliminary data
from this antimetabolite combination are encouraging.34
We did not use placebo for the controls (approved by the
ethics committee) because it was unfeasible for phase 2,
requiring patients to attend clinic every week for sham (in-
vasive) injections. Also, our results (including the subgroup
analyses) require confirmation in larger studies.

Conclusions
ADAM is the first biomarker-driven trial showing that argi-
nine deprivation using ADI-PEG20 significantly improves PFS,
and possibly OS, in patients with mesothelioma who are de-
ficient in the enzyme ASS1. Further cancer studies using tis-
sue, fluid, and imaging biomarkers are warranted in tumors
auxotrophic for arginine to optimize arginine deprivation as
a novel antimetabolic strategy.

Untilrecently,cisplatinandpemetrexeddisodiumdoubletche-
motherapy was the only anticancer treatment with a median
overallsurvivalbenefitinmalignantmesothelioma.1TheMAPS
study published in 2016 con-
firmed a modest improve-
ment in median survival with
the addition of bevacizumab
to this regimen.2 Recent sequencing studies point to most me-
sotheliomas having a low mutational burden and few “drug-
gable” oncogenes.3 However, with the rapidly expanding field
of immuno-oncology, most of the recent excitement in meso-
theliomaresearchinvolvesimmunecheckpointinhibitors,with
some encouraging results but also some disappointment. De-
spite the lack of oncogenic driver mutations, other mecha-
nisms of “personalized medicine” are under investigation in-
cludingantimesothelinantibodydrugconjugates,4vaccines,and
small-molecule inhibition of growth factor receptors.5
Arginine has long been postulated to be implicated in tu-
morigenesis;hence,exploitingthisasapotentialtargethasbeen
asubjectofinterest.6Argininosuccinatesynthase1(ASS1),which
represents the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of argi-
nine, is deficient in multiple tumor cell lines including
mesothelioma.6,7 DeficiencyofASS1througheitherdownregu-
lation or epigenetic silencing enables cells to increase prolif-
eration by facilitating pyrimidine biosynthesis and activating
phosphorylationofS6K1throughthemammaliantargetofrap-
amycin (mTOR) pathway.7 Depriving ASS1-deficient cells of ar-
ginine by using the enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) results in
cell apoptosis in vitro.6 Early phase 1/2 trials using ADI-PEG20,
a human recombinant arginine depleter, in melanoma and he-
patocellular carcinomas showed minimal responses, with the
highest response rate of 25% (6 of 24) in an Italian melanoma
cohort.8 In the hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts, the majority
of responses were that of disease stability.9 Larger studies in
melanoma were not undertaken due to the emergence of im-
munecheckpointinhibitorswithmoreimpressiveefficacydata.
In this issue of JAMA Oncology, Szlosarek and colleagues10
present their findings from the ADAM study, a phase 2 multi-
center study of ADI-PEG20 and best supportive care (BSC) vs
BSCaloneinpatientswithASS1-deficientmalignantpleuralme-
sothelioma.Of201patients,97(48%)werefoundtobeASS1de-
ficient, in keeping with previous studies. It is noteworthy that
the investigators screened a large group of patients with a rela-
tively uncommon tumor. Of 97 ASS1-negative patients, 68 with
ASS1 deficiency were randomized 2:1 to ADI-PEG20 vs BSC.
Disappointingly, there were no objective responses with
ADI-PEG20 treatment in a carefully selected biomarker-
based subgroup of patients, although this was a secondary end
