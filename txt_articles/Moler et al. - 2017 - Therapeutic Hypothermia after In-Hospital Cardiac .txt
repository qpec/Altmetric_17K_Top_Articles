BACKGROUND
Targeted temperature management is recommended for comatose adults and children 
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; however, data on temperature management after in-
hospital cardiac arrest are limited.
METHODS
In a trial conducted at 37 children’s hospitals, we compared two temperature interven-
tions in children who had had in-hospital cardiac arrest. Within 6 hours after the return 
of circulation, comatose children older than 48 hours and younger than 18 years of age 
were randomly assigned to therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature, 33.0°C) or 
therapeutic normothermia (target temperature, 36.8°C). The primary efficacy outcome, 
survival at 12 months after cardiac arrest with a score of 70 or higher on the Vineland 
Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II, on which scores range from 20 to 160, 
with higher scores indicating better function), was evaluated among patients who had 
had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before the cardiac arrest.
RESULTS
The trial was terminated because of futility after 329 patients had undergone randomiza-
tion. Among the 257 patients who had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest 
and who could be evaluated, the rate of the primary efficacy outcome did not differ 
significantly between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group (36% [48 of 
133 patients] and 39% [48 of 124 patients], respectively; relative risk, 0.92; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.67 to 1.27; P 
= 
0.63). Among 317 patients who could be evaluated for 
change in neurobehavioral function, the change in VABS-II score from baseline to 12 months 
did not differ significantly between the groups (P 
= 
0.70). Among 327 patients who could 
be evaluated for 1-year survival, the rate of 1-year survival did not differ significantly 
between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group (49% [81 of 166 patients] 
and 46% [74 of 161 patients], respectively; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.34; 
P 
= 
0.56). The incidences of blood-product use, infection, and serious adverse events, as 
well as 28-day mortality, did not differ significantly between groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among comatose children who survived in-hospital cardiac arrest, therapeutic hypother-
mia, as compared with therapeutic normothermia, did not confer a significant benefit in 
survival with a favorable functional outcome at 1 year. (Funded by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute; THAPCA-IH ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00880087.)

Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest
T
herapeutic hypothermia for coma-
tose adults who have had an out-of-hospi-
tal cardiac arrest was recommended on 
the basis of results of clinical trials reported in 
2002.1-3 More recent trials have shown that fever 
prevention with therapeutic normothermia is 
equally efficacious as therapeutic hypothermia 
in adult and pediatric populations.4,5 Current 
guidelines recommend either hypothermia or 
normothermia for temperature management af-
ter out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and 
children.6,7
In-hospital cardiac arrest in children common-
ly results in death or in a poor long-term func-
tional outcome in survivors; however, outcomes 
in the in-hospital setting are significantly better 
than those in the out-of-hospital setting.8,9 Fur-
thermore, in-hospital outcomes are improving.10,11 
Published results of clinical trials of therapeutic 
hypothermia versus therapeutic normothermia in 
adults and children who have had an in-hospital 
cardiac arrest are lacking. Two retrospective stud-
ies involving cohorts of children who had in-hos-
pital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed 
that therapeutic hypothermia was not associated 
with improved outcomes.12,13
Cardiac arrests in children and adolescents in 
the in-hospital setting can be distinguished from 
those in the out-of-hospital setting on the basis 
of multiple factors, including preexisting condi-
tions, the initial cardiac rhythm in the patients, 
the cause of the cardiac arrest, response times 
and resuscitation skills of the initial responders, 
and causes of death in nonsurvivors.8 Thus, pa-
tients who have in-hospital cardiac arrests repre-
sent a pathophysiologically distinct population 
from those who have out-of-hospital cardiac ar-
rests, and the potential efficacy of an interven-
tion such as therapeutic hypothermia may differ 
in the two populations. Therefore, we conducted 
independent, parallel Therapeutic Hypothermia 
after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (THAPCA) trials, 
one in the out-of-hospital setting (THAPCA-OH) 
and one in the in-hospital setting (THAPCA-IH).
14,15 
The results of the THAPCA-OH trial were recently 
reported in the Journal.5 We now report the re-
sults of the THAPCA-IH trial, in which we com-
pared the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia 
(target temperature, 33.0°C) with that of thera-
peutic normothermia (target temperature, 36.8°C) 
in comatose children and adolescents who were 
resuscitated after in-hospital cardiac arrest.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
This randomized trial was conducted in pediatric 
intensive care units at 37 children’s hospitals in 
the United States, Canada, and the United King-
dom. The rationale, trial design, outcome selec-
tion process, protocol summary, and 12-month 
pilot vanguard phase have been described previ-
ously.5,14-16
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute (NHLBI) funded the trial. The protocol was 
designed by the first, third, and last authors. 
The institutional review board at each participat-
ing site and the data coordinating center at the 
University of Utah (see the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org) approved the protocol and informed-
consent documents.
The site research coordinators listed in the 
Supplementary Appendix collected all the data, 
and statisticians at the data coordinating center 
performed all the analyses. Details of site train-
ing, data management, and site monitoring are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. An 
independent data and safety monitoring board 
that was appointed by the NHLBI conducted in-
terim safety and efficacy analyses.17 All the authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
submitted data, the third and last authors vouch 
for the data management and statistical analy-
ses, and all the authors vouch for fidelity of the 
study to the trial protocol (available at NEJM.org).
Patient Population
Children older than 48 hours and younger than 
18 years of age were eligible for inclusion if they 
had a cardiac arrest that began within the walls 
of a hospital, received chest compressions for at 
least 2 minutes, and remained dependent on 
mechanical ventilation after the return of circu-
lation. Major exclusion criteria were a score of 
5 or 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale motor-response 
subscale (on which scores range from 1 to 6, 
with lower scores indicating worse function), 
the inability to undergo randomization within 
6 hours after the return of circulation, active and 
refractory severe bleeding, a preexisting illness 
associated with a life expectancy of less than 12 
months, and a decision by the clinical team to 
withhold aggressive treatment. A full list of ex-
clusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary

Appendix. Written informed consent from a par-
ent or legal guardian was obtained for each 
participant.
Randomization and Intervention
Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 
1:1 ratio, to therapeutic hypothermia or ther-
apeutic normothermia. Randomization was per-
formed with the use of permuted blocks stratified 
according to clinical center and age category 
(<2 years, 2 to <12 years, or ≥12 years).
Targeted temperature management was active-
ly maintained for 120 hours in each group. Pa-
tients who were assigned to therapeutic hypo-
thermia were pharmacologically paralyzed and 
sedated, and a Blanketrol III temperature-man-
agement unit (Cincinnati Sub-Zero) was used, 
with blankets applied anteriorly and posteriorly, 
to achieve and maintain a core temperature of 
33.0°C (range, 32.0 to 34.0) for 48 hours. The 
patients were then rewarmed over a period of 16 
hours or longer to a target temperature of 36.8°C 
(range, 36.0 to 37.5); this temperature was actively 
maintained throughout the remainder of the 120-
hour intervention period. Patients who were as-
signed to therapeutic normothermia received 
identical care except that the core temperature 
was actively maintained with the temperature-
management unit at 36.8°C (range, 36.0 to 37.5) 
for 120 hours. Dual monitoring of the central 
temperature (esophageal, rectal, or bladder tem-
perature) and an automatic mode on the temper-
ature-management unit were used. In the pa-
tients who received extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of randomiza-
tion or later, ECMO with a single monitor of 
central temperature was used for temperature 
control. All other aspects of care were determined 
by the clinical teams.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was survival with a favor-
able neurobehavioral outcome at 12 months of 
follow-up. A favorable neurobehavioral outcome 
was defined as an age-corrected standard score 
of 70 or higher (on a scale of 20 to 160) on the 
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition 
(VABS-II).18 The VABS-II has an age-corrected 
mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 
15; higher scores indicate better function. The 
VABS-II data were collected centrally at the Ken-
nedy Krieger Institute by means of telephone 
interviews conducted by a trained interviewer 
who was unaware of the treatment assignments. 
As prespecified in the protocol, enrolled children 
with a VABS-II score of less than 70 before car-
diac arrest (on the basis of data from a caregiver 
questionnaire completed at each site within 24 
hours after randomization) were excluded from 
the primary efficacy analysis. Patients with no 
baseline VABS-II score were considered to be 
eligible for inclusion in the primary analysis if 
their baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Cat-
egory (POPC) and Pediatric Cerebral Performance 
Category (PCPC) scores were in the normal or 
mild disability category.19,20 On both these scales, 
scores range from 1 to 6, with lower scores in-
dicating less disability; patients with a score of 
1 or 2 on both scales were eligible for inclusion 
in the primary analysis.
Secondary outcomes were survival at 12 months 
after cardiac arrest and change in neurobehavioral 
function, which was measured as the difference 
between the baseline measurement (before car-
diac arrest) and the 12-month measurement on 
the VABS-II. Patients who had died and patients 
with the lowest possible VABS-II score were as-
signed the worst possible outcomes, regardless 
of baseline function. A tertiary outcome was a 
global cognitive score that was based on the re-
sults of neuropsychological testing (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Safety outcomes included 
the incidences of blood-product use, infection, 
and serious arrhythmias within 7 days after ran-
domization, as well as 28-day mortality. Details 
of the methods used for outcome assessment are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the target sample size assuming 
an estimated favorable primary outcome rate of 
35 to 55% in the normothermia group. Assum-
ing that 5% of the patients would be excluded 
owing to baseline neurologic deficit and that 5% 
of the patients would be lost to follow-up, we es-
timated that 558 patients would need to be enrolled 
to provide the trial with 90% power to detect a 
15-percentage-point absolute treatment effect.
We performed the analysis for the primary 
efficacy outcome using a prespecified modified 
intention-to-treat approach, excluding children 
who had poor neurobehavioral function before 
cardiac arrest. Secondary efficacy outcomes were 
analyzed among all children who could be evalu-

ated. Safety analyses were performed in treated 
patients only, according to the treatment received. 
The primary outcome and 12-month survival 
were compared between the treatment groups 
with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test 
stratified according to age category. The change 
in the VABS-II score was analyzed with the use of 
van Elteren’s modification of the Mann–Whitney 
test,21 with stratification according to age cate-
gory, treatment of death as the worst outcome, 
and treatment of the lowest possible VABS-II 
score at 12 months as the second worst out-
come. An alpha level of 0.05 was set for the 
primary analysis, and an alpha level of 0.025 was 
set for each of the two formal secondary analy-
ses, with two-sided tests used in all instances. 
The probability of survival from 0 to 365 days 
was evaluated by comparison of survival curves 
between treatment groups with the use of a log-
rank test stratified according to age category. 
Analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
When reviewing interim efficacy analyses, the 
data and safety monitoring board used an infor-
mal threshold for conditional power (i.e., the 
chance of detecting a significant treatment ef-
fect if the trial were to be continued) of 20%. 
Conditional power below this threshold would 
lead the board to consider stopping further en-
rollment because of futility.
Results
Patients
The trial was stopped on February 27, 2015, be-
cause of futility after a review of interim efficacy 
analyses by the data and safety monitoring board. 
Between September 1, 2009, and February 27, 
2015, a total of 2791 patients were screened for 
eligibility and met the trial inclusion criteria 
(Fig. 1). Of these patients, 746 were eligible for 
enrollment. The families of 334 of these patients 
provided consent, and 329 patients underwent 
randomization at 37 sites in the United States, 
Canada, and the United Kingdom (9 sites did not 
enroll any patients); 166 were assigned to thera-
peutic hypothermia, and 163 to therapeutic nor-
mothermia. A total of 5 patients who were as-
signed to hypothermia and 3 who were assigned 
to normothermia did not receive an intervention.
Of the 329 patients who underwent random-
ization, 31 in the hypothermia group and 29 in 
the normothermia group were ineligible for in-
clusion in the primary analysis because they had 
a baseline VABS-II score of less than 70 or a POPC 
or PCPC score of 3 or higher. At 12 months, vital 
status was unknown in 2 patients in the normo-
thermia group, and VABS-II scores were not ob-
tained for 2 surviving children in the hypothermia 
group and 8 in the normothermia group (Fig. 1). 
Thus, 257 patients could be evaluated for the 
primary outcome, 317 could be evaluated for the 
secondary outcome of change in neurobehavioral 
function, and 327 could be evaluated for the 
secondary outcome of 1-year survival.
Baseline Characteristics and Temperature 
Intervention
The baseline characteristics of the patients were 
similar in the two treatment groups (Table 1, 
and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). There were statistically significant dif-
ferences between the two groups at baseline in 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotrans-
ferase, and hemoglobin levels, but these differ-
ences were not clinically significant (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The median age 
of the patients was 1 year, 196 patients (60%) 
were male, and 299 patients (91%) had a preexist-
ing medical condition. The initial rhythm was 
bradycardia in 189 patients (57%) and ventricular 
fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in 34 (10%). 
The median time from cardiac arrest to cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was 0 minutes, 
and the median duration of CPR was 22.0 min-
utes (interquartile range, 7.0 to 47.0). Cardiac 
arrest occurred at a trial hospital in 307 patients 
(93%). Baseline functional status based on the 
VABS-II, PCPC, and POPC scores is shown in 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The median time from the return of circula-
tion to the initiation of treatment was 4.9 hours 
(interquartile range, 3.9 to 5.8) in the hypother-
mia group and 4.7 hours (interquartile range, 
4.0 to 5.7) in the normothermia group. Figure S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix shows the pri-
mary central (core) temperatures recorded for 
the two groups. Additional information regard-
ing temperature control is provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.

The percentage of children with a VABS-II score 
of 70 or higher at 12 months did not differ sig-

thermia group and the normothermia group 
(49% [81 of 166 patients] and 46% [74 of 161 
patients], respectively; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 
0.85 to 1.34; P 
= 
0.56) (Table 2). Estimates of sur-
vival from 0 to 365 days also did not differ sig-
nificantly between the groups (P 
= 
0.45) (Fig. 2). 
The primary cause of death was brain death or 
withdrawal of life support owing to a poor neu-
rologic prognosis (in 39% [33 of 85 patients] in 
the hypothermia group and 33% [29 of 88 pa-
tients] in the normothermia group) or cardiovas-
cular failure (in 31% [26 of 85 patients] in the 
hypothermia group and 38% [33 of 88 patients] 
in the normothermia group), with no significant 
differences between the groups (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Data on global cognitive functioning in sur-
vivors are shown in Table S6 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. The Early Learning Composite 
scores on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning22 
did not differ significantly between the groups; 
there were also no significant differences be-
tween the groups in the IQ score distributions on 
the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence23 
or in the combined categories from both the 
Mullen and Wechsler tests.
Safety
The incidences of infection, blood-product use, 
and serious arrhythmias within 7 days after ran-
domization were similar in the 161 patients who 
received therapeutic hypothermia and the 160 who 
received therapeutic normothermia (Table 3). 
Mortality at 28 days did not differ significantly 
between the hypothermia group and the normo-
thermia group (37% [59 of 161 patients] and 
41% [66 of 160 patients], respectively; P 
= 
0.40). 
Data regarding other adverse events are provided 
in Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix; there were no significant differences between 
the groups in any of the other adverse events.
Discussion
The THAPCA-IH trial evaluated the efficacy of 
therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature, 
33.0°C) and therapeutic normothermia (target 
temperature, 36.8°C) in improving outcomes af-
ter in-hospital cardiac arrest in children. There 
was no significant difference between the groups 
in the primary outcome of survival with a favor-
able neurobehavioral outcome (VABS-II score 
of ≥70) at 12 months. The secondary outcome 
of change in the VABS-II score from baseline to 
1 year did not differ significantly between the 
groups; the proportion of patients with 12-month 
VABS-II scores that did not decrease by more 
than 15 points (1 SD) from their baseline scores 
was similar in the two groups. Survival at 1 year 
and Kaplan–Meier estimates of survival from 0 to 
365 days did not differ significantly between the 
groups.
An important limitation in the interpretation 
of our findings is that the trial was stopped at 
the recommendation of the data and safety 
monitoring board because of an assessment of 
futility before attainment of the target trial en-
rollment. Although slower-than-expected patient 
recruitment was a factor, termination of enroll-
ment was based primarily on the low condi-
tional power of the trial to show a significant 
treatment effect if continued, since no trend was 
observed with respect to the primary or second-
ary outcomes. Given the number of patients who 
could be evaluated, the confidence intervals for 
treatment effect are wide; however, the 15-per-
centage-point absolute benefit of hypothermia 
that was postulated during the trial design can 
be ruled out. Another possible limitation was 
the relatively long time from the return of circu-

lation to the achievement of a temperature within 
the target temperature range (median time, ap-
proximately 6 hours). We did not conduct a pre-
trial site phase-in or use only high-enrolling sites; 
such strategies have been suggested in other hy-
pothermia trials.24-28 Other limitations are similar 
to those previously described in the THAPCA-OH 
trial report.5
Our overall findings in the THAPCA-IH trial 
are consistent with those of recent trials investi-
gating the efficacy of hypothermia versus normo-
thermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.4,5 In 
contrast to earlier trials in the out-of-hospital 
setting involving only adults,2,3 in more recent 
trials involving adults and children,4,5 fever was 
prevented in the normothermia group through 
an active intervention similar to that used in our 
normothermia group. The duration of tempera-
ture control was identical in the THAPCA-OH 
trial and the THAPCA-IH trial (120 hours) but 
was longer than the duration used in both the 
earlier and the more recent trials involving only 
adults. The characteristics of the in-hospital popu-
lation included in the THAPCA-IH trial differed 
markedly from those of the out-of-hospital popu-
lation included in the THAPCA-OH trial, as ex-
pected on the basis of the results of our pretrial 
cohort study.8 The leading cause of cardiac arrest 
in the THAPCA-IH trial was a cardiac cause or a 
cause related to congenital heart disease (in 50% 
and 16% of patients, respectively, or in 65% of pa-
tients combined); in contrast, in the THAPCA-OH 
trial, 72% of patients had a respiratory cause of 
cardiac arrest. A lower percentage of patients in 
the THAPCA-IH trial than in the THAPCA-OH 
trial had asystole (7% vs. 58%), and a much

Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest
higher percentage had bradycardia (57% vs. 6%). 
Shockable rhythms were infrequent in both trials 
(occurring in 8 to 10% of patients). Brain death or 
withdrawal of life support owing to a poor neuro-
logic prognosis was the cause of death in approxi-
mately 79% of patients in the THAPCA-OH trial 
but in only 36% of patients in the THAPCA-IH 
trial, whereas a cardiac cause of death was more 
common in the THAPCA-IH trial than in the 
THAPCA-OH trial (in 34% vs. 13% of patients). 
A favorable primary outcome occurred in a sub-
stantially higher percentage of patients in the 
THAPCA-IH trial than in the THAPCA-OH trial 
(37% [96 of 257 patients] vs. 16% [42 of 260 
patients]).
Trials comparing therapeutic hypothermia 
with therapeutic normothermia have shown no 
significant differences between the two inter-
ventions in outcomes.4,5 A possible mechanism 
underlying the initial reports2,3 of a benefit of 
hypothermia over conventional treatment (i.e., 
care that does not include targeted temperature 
management to prevent fever) is that therapeutic 
normothermia is also beneficial. Fever commonly 
occurs after hypoxic–ischemic brain injury.29-32 
In initial trials of hypothermia for neonatal as-
phyxial encephalopathy and adult out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest, the control groups did not receive 
therapeutic normothermia.2,33-35 A small trial of 
cooling versus normal temperature control in 
neonates who were receiving ECMO and were at 
high risk for neurologic injury showed no differ-
ence in outcome between the two interventions.36 
Studies of hypothermia in children with trau-
matic brain injury showed that hypothermia had 
no efficacy and may have resulted in higher mor-
tality.24,37 A recent registry report of outcomes in 
adults who had in-hospital cardiac arrest showed 
higher mortality and lower survival with a favor-
able neurologic outcome among patients who 
received therapeutic hypothermia than among 
those who received usual care.38 In contrast, we 
found no trends toward higher mortality or high-
er incidences of infection, arrhythmias, blood-
product use, or other serious adverse events in the 
therapeutic hypothermia group than in the thera-
peutic normothermia group in the THAPCA-IH 
trial.
Unanswered questions remain regarding the 
role of targeted temperature management in chil-
dren after in-hospital cardiac arrest. A different 
therapeutic window for attaining the target tem-
perature (shorter), a different duration of tem-
perature control (longer or shorter), and different 
depths of temperature control (higher or lower) 
are modifications that have been suggested previ-
ously and might be considered for future trials.5 
In neonates with hypoxic–ischemic encephalop-
athy, use of a lower target temperature (32.0°C 
vs. 33.5°C) and a longer duration of temperature 
control (120 hours vs. 72 hours) did not decrease 
mortality.39 Modification of inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria and the combination of targeted 
temperature management with neuroprotective 
agents might also be considered in future trials 
of therapies after cardiac arrest in children.40
In conclusion, in comatose children who sur-
vived in-hospital cardiac arrest, therapeutic hypo-
thermia (target temperature, 33.0°C), as compared 
with therapeutic normothermia (target tempera-
ture, 36.8°C), did not confer a significant benefit 
with respect to survival with a good functional 
outcome at 1 year.
