ABSTRACT
Background The original Manchester Acute Coronary
Syndromes model (MACS) ‘rules in’ and ‘rules out’ acute
coronary syndromes (ACS) using high sensitivity cardiac
troponin T (hs-cTnT) and heart-type fatty acid binding
protein (H-FABP) measured at admission. The latter is
not always available. We aimed to refine and validate
MACS as Troponin-only Manchester Acute Coronary
Syndromes (T-MACS), cutting down the biomarkers to
just hs-cTnT.
Methods We present secondary analyses from four
prospective diagnostic cohort studies including patients
presenting to the ED with suspected ACS. Data were
collected and hs-cTnT measured on arrival. The primary
outcome was ACS, defined as prevalent acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) or incident death, AMI or coronary
revascularisation within 30 days. T-MACS was built in
one cohort (derivation set) and validated in three
external cohorts (validation set).
Results At the ‘rule out’ threshold, in the derivation
set (n=703), T-MACS had 99.3% (95% CI 97.3% to
99.9%) negative predictive value (NPV) and 98.7%
(95.3%–99.8%) sensitivity for ACS, ‘ruling out’ 37.7%
patients (specificity 47.6%, positive predictive value
(PPV) 34.0%). In the validation set (n=1459), T-MACS
had 99.3% (98.3%–99.8%) NPV and 98.1% (95.2%–
99.5%) sensitivity, ‘ruling out’ 40.4% (n=590) patients
(specificity 47.0%, PPV 23.9%). T-MACS would ‘rule in’
10.1% and 4.7% patients in the respective sets, of
which 100.0% and 91.3% had ACS. C-statistics for the
original and refined rules were similar (T-MACS 0.91 vs
MACS 0.90 on validation).
Conclusions T-MACS could ‘rule out’ ACS in 40% of
patients, while ‘ruling in’ 5% at highest risk using a
single hs-cTnT measurement on arrival. As a clinical
decision aid, T-MACS could therefore help to conserve
healthcare resources.
BACKGROUND
A number of strategies have been proposed to ‘rule
out’ acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in the ED
using various combinations of the ECG, cardiac
troponin and history. Several recent reports suggest
that ACS could be ‘ruled out’ in some patients fol-
lowing a single blood test in the ED. For example,
patients with high sensitivity cardiac troponin T
(hs-cTnT) concentrations below the limit of detec-
tion (LoD) of the assay and no ECG ischaemia
have very low probability of acute myocardial
infarction
(AMI)
(the
‘LoD
strategy’).1–3
W
e
recently reported the derivation and external valid-
ation
of
the
Manchester
Acute
Coronary
Syndromes (MACS) decision aid. The decision aid
uses a computer model to both ‘rule in’ and ‘rule
out’ ACS by combining the presence or absence of
six clinical features with two biomarkers measured
on
arrival:
hs-cTnT and
heart-type
fatty
acid
binding protein (H-FABP).4 5 The components of
the original MACS model and the method of calcu-
lation are displayed in table 1. The absence of any
clinical features and negative results of the biomar-
kers has been shown to have negative predictive
values (NPVs) of 100%, 98.7% and 100% in three
prior derivation/validation studies. The advantage
of the computer decision aid is that it aims to ‘rule
in’ ACS as well as ‘rule out’, which may help to
make efficient use of inpatient resources. MACS
has also been validated to predict AMI and major
adverse cardiac events (MACE, which include AMI,
death
or
coronary
revascularisation)
within
30 days.
A barrier to implementing MACS in practice is
the need to run the H-FABP assay, which is not
widely used.6 7 In the original analysis, H-FABP
strongly predicted ACS independently of hs-cTnT
,
ECG ischaemia and other clinical information, thus
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
▸ The Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes
(MACS) model, which has been externally
validated in two cohorts, could ‘rule out’
coronary syndromes following a single blood
test, reducing unnecessary hospital admissions.
▸ The original model requires measurement of
heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP),
which some people may perceive as a barrier
to implementation.
What this study adds?
▸ We refined MACS, producing a version that
only requires measurement of high sensitivity
troponin (and not H-FABP). On external
validation in three cohorts, this refined version
performed well, paving the way for further
evaluation when the model is used in practice.

 justifying its inclusion in the model. However, a re-derivation of
MACS using cardiac troponin alone could enable more wide-
spread clinical implementation without the expense of an add-
itional assay.
Our primary objective was therefore to return to the deriv-
ation of the original MACS model, but using hs-cTnT as the
only biomarker (Troponin-only Manchester Acute Coronary
Syndromes (T-MACS)), and then to evaluate the model in three
separate external cohort studies. A secondary objective was to
compare the predictive characteristics of T-MACS with MACS
and with the alternative ‘LoD strategy’.
METHODS
Design and setting
In this work, we present secondary analyses from four prospective
diagnostic cohort studies. The MACS model was rederived using
data from the original study
, which was undertaken at Manchester
Royal Infirmary (January 2006 to February 2007). External valid-
ation was undertaken in three separate cohort studies as follows:
validation cohort (1) took place at Stepping Hill Hospital,
Stockport
(April to July 2010); cohort study (2) was at
Manchester Royal Infirmary (May 2011 to July 2013) and study
(3) took place at Poole NHS Foundation T
rust (July 2012 to
August 2013), all of which are located in the UK. Several separate
analyses have been published from these cohorts, as detailed in the
online supplementary appendix. Ethical approval was obtained
from the Research Ethics Committees separately for each study
(references 05/Q1410/27, 09/H1014/74, 10/H1003/96 and 12/
SW/0133) and all participants provided written informed consent.
Participants
In each study, we included patients who presented to the ED
with a primary complaint of chest pain that the treating clinician
suspected might be cardiac in nature and warranted investiga-
tion for a possible ACS. A detailed list of inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria specific to each study is included in the online
supplementary appendix. In summary, the only key difference in
inclusion and exclusion criteria between cohorts is that patients
with evidence of ECG ischaemia were excluded in validation
study 3.
Data collection
In each study, data were collected prospectively using custom-
designed case report forms. The initial ECG findings and sys-
tolic BP recording at the time of arrival in the ED were
considered. Because the model aims to support decisions at the
point of arrival following a single blood test, serial recordings
or measurements were not considered. ECGs were interpreted
by the treating clinicians. W
e adopted this pragmatic approach
because it is practising clinicians’ interpretations that would be
used to guide use of the model in practice.
Laboratory analyses
Serum samples were drawn at the time of arrival, stored at ≤−70°C
and subsequently thawed for testing in batches. W
e analysed
samples for hs-cTnT concentrations (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys,
fifth generation, 99th percentile 14 ng/L, coefficient of variation
<10% at 13 ng/L). T
o address a calibration shift affecting the
initial batch of reagents used in validation study 1, samples were
retested using an unaffected batch.8 Results from the unaffected
batch are presented here. Other than in validation studies 2 and 3
(where hs-cTnT was used in clinical practice), samples were also
tested for cTnT (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys, fourth generation,
99th percentile 10 ng/L, coefficient of variation <10% at 30 ng/L).
H-FABP concentrations were measured in serum samples
drawn at the time of presentation to the ED, which are reported
here to compare the accuracy of T-MACS with MACS. In the der-
ivation study, H-FABP was evaluated in serum using the Cardiac
Plus Array, Evidence Investigator, Randox Laboratories, County
Antrim.4 In the validation studies, we used an automated immu-
noturbidimetric assay (Randox Laboratories), in which case the
relevant coefficient for the MACS model was amended in accord-
ance with a previous assay-specific validation.5
Follow-up
All participants underwent reference standard troponin testing
at least 12 hours after peak symptoms (derivation study and val-
idation studies 1 and 2) or at least 6 hours after presentation to
the ED (validation study 3). Participants were also followed up
by telephone, email, letter, home visit or in clinic after 30 days.
W
e contacted the general practitioner for information if patients
were persistently uncontactable.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ACS. In the absence of
an accepted reference standard for unstable angina, patients
were deemed to have ACS if they had either prevalent AMI or
incident MACE within 30 days. MACE included incident AMI,
death (from all causes) or coronary revascularisation. Secondary
outcomes included the diagnosis of (prevalent) AMI alone and
the identification of a coronary stenosis >50% of the luminal
diameter of a major epicardial vessel, even if revascularisation
did not take place.
The diagnosis of AMI was adjudicated at each study site by
two independent investigators with reference to clinical data
and any relevant investigation results blinded to the results of
MACS and T-MACS. AMI was diagnosed if the patient devel-
oped a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin with at least one
value above the 99th percentile in conjunction with symptoms
compatible with myocardial ischaemia.9 In line with the manu-
facturer’s recommendations, we did not use sex-specific cut-
points. Full details of the reference standards used in each study
are shown in the online supplementary appendix.
Statistical analysis
Refinement
Statistical analysis proceeded according to a prespecified statis-
tical analysis plan. T-MACS was derived by including the seven
variables in the original MACS model in a logistic regression

 analysis, having removed H-FABP from the model. T
wo of the
seven variables were on a continuous measurement scale:
hs-cTnT concentration and systolic BP
. W
e explored the appro-
priateness of assuming a linear relationship by examining the
strength of association between each predictor variable and the
outcome, using the raw variable, the squared variable and a dis-
cretised form (20 ordinal categories). W
e noted a sudden
change in the prevalence of ACS at a systolic BP cut-off of
103 mm Hg (the bottom 20th) and therefore dichotomised this
variable at 100 mm Hg, as in the original MACS model. As lin-
earity appeared to hold for hs-cTnT
, this was fitted as a continu-
ous linear variable in the model.
W
e then examined whether other covariates had become
important to the model by adding (as independent variables) those
covariates that had been shown to be significant (p<0.05) and reli-
able (Cohen’s κ>0.6 in a separately reported substudy of interob-
server reliability) predictors of ACS in our original derivation
study.4 Based on the refined model, we generated the predicted
probability (p) of ACS for each individual patient. Using the same
categorisation as for the original MACS rule, we classified patients
into four risk groups based on this probability, as follows: very low
risk (p<0.02; ACS ‘ruled out’); low risk (0.02<p<0.05; suitable
to continue with serial cardiac troponin testing in a low
dependency environment such as an ED observation ward); mod-
erate risk (0.05<p<0.95; suitable for ongoing investigation
including serial troponin sampling in a general ward such as an
Acute Medical Unit) and high risk (p≥0.95; ACS ‘ruled in’).
Goodness
of
fit
was
evaluated
by
calculation
of
the
Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and by visual evaluation of a calibra-
tion plot.
Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy
The diagnostic accuracy of T-MACS was evaluated by calculat-
ing sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and
NPVs, positive and negative likelihood ratios and areas under
the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for all
cohorts, together with their respective 95% CIs. The AUC in
the derivation (refinement) cohort was corrected for in sample
optimism by sample splitting with 10-fold cross-validation.
W
e pooled the data from each of the three validation studies
(the ‘validation set’) for the primary analysis, although baseline
characteristics are reported separately for each cohort and we
undertook secondary analyses for each individual cohort.
Comparison with alternative strategies
W
e compared the diagnostic accuracy of T-MACS with MACS
and to the ‘LoD strategy’ in the validation set. In the latter strat-
egy, patients were considered ‘ruled out’ if they had initial
hs-cTnT concentrations below 5 ng/L and no ECG ischaemia.
The performance of MACS and T-MACS models were com-
pared among patients who had sufficient data for applying the
models.
Paired proportions (including sensitivities and specificities)
were compared by McNemar’s test. The AUCs for dependent
receiver operating characteristic curves were compared by the
method of De Long et al10 Independent proportions were com-
pared with a χ2 test (categorical data) or t-test (continuous
data). As the proportion of missing data for each variable was
very small (<3%), we ran a complete case analysis without
imputation. Statistical analyses were completed using MedCalc
V
.13.1.3 (Mariakerke, Belgium) or SPSS V
.23.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
Illinois, USA).
Sample size
Sample size in the derivation study was determined in order to
derive a clinical decision rule that would contain a maximum of
15 predictors. This required the inclusion of 150 patients with
the primary outcome.11 Estimating a 20% prevalence of ACS
with 5% loss to follow-up would require 790 participants.
Because the analyses were post hoc in the validation set, no
formal sample size calculations that are directly relevant to this
analysis were undertaken a priori.
RESULTS
A total of 804 participants were included in the derivation
study, of which 703 had available blood samples and were
included in this analysis. The validation set included a total of
1459 patients including 462 patients from the first validation
study; 191 patients from the second validation study and 806
patients from the third (figure 1). In the derivation study, 157
(22.3%) patients had ACS including 130 (18.5%) with AMI on
their initial presentation. In the validation set, a total of 212
(14.5%) patients had ACS, of whom 172 (11.8%) had AMI
diagnosed on their initial admission. The baseline characteristics
of participants in each study are summarised in table 2.
Refinement of the MACS model
All seven variables that were considered for inclusion in the
refined model remained independent predictors of ACS, once
H-FABP concentration had been removed. After entering these
variables, considering
additional variables with a
stepwise
approach identified no further independent predictors of ACS.
W
e did not detect any significant interactions between variables.
The refined MACS model thus estimated the probability (p) of
ACS as follows (rounded values are presented):

Where E is ECG ischaemia; A is worsening or crescendo angina
(defined as anginal pain with increasing frequency, occurring with
less exertion or becoming more prolonged); R is pain radiation to
the Right arm or shoulder; V is pain associated with Vomiting; S is
Sweating observed; H is Hypotension (systolic BP <100 mm Hg)
and T is hs-cTnT concentration on arrival. Calculation in clinical
practice would be computer-based, tablet-based or smartphone-
based. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic for the refined model was
0.144. A calibration plot is shown in the online supplementary
appendix.
Performance of the refined rule in the derivation set
In the derivation set, T-MACS gave an AUC of 0.94 after cor-
rection for in-sample optimism by cross-validation. The diagnos-
tic performance for ACS and prevalent AMI is summarised in
tables 3 and 4. In total, 37.7% (n=265) patients were classified
as ‘very low risk’ and could have thus been ‘ruled out’ in the
derivation study with a NPV of 99.3% (95% CI 97.3% to
99.9%) for ACS and 99.6% (97.9% to 100.0%) for AMI.
Another 10.1% (n=71) patients were classified as ‘high risk’
(and thus ‘ruled in’) with a PPV of 100.0% (94.9% to 100.0%)
for ACS and 97.2% (90.2% to 99.7%) for AMI.
Of the patients in the ‘very low risk’ group who had ACS,
one (who presented to the ED within 1 hour of symptom onset,
had an initial hs-cTnT concentration of 8 ng/L and no ECG
ischaemia) had AMI (cTnT 2640 ng/L at 12 hours) and one
underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days,
although cTnT concentrations remained within the normal

 range on serial sampling. No patients in the ‘very low risk’
group who had not already been diagnosed with ACS had detec-
tion of angiographic coronary stenosis >50% (the secondary
outcome) within 30 days.
Performance in the validation set
In the validation set, T-MACS gave an AUC of 0.90. Again,
diagnostic performance is summarised in tables 3 and 4. A total
of 40.4% (n=590) patients would have been ‘ruled out’ by
being classified as ‘very low risk’, with 99.3% NPV (95% CI
98.3% to 99.8%) for ACS and 99.7% (98.8%–100.0%) for
AMI. Another 4.7% (n=69) patients would have had ACS
‘ruled in’ by being identified as ‘high risk’. The PPV of T-MACS
for ‘ruling in’ ACS was 84.0% (95% CI 73.7% to 91.5%). The
performance of T-MACS in each individual cohort within the
validation set is shown in the online supplementary appendix.
Four patients in the ‘very low risk’ group had ACS. T
wo of
these patients had AMI. Of those one patient, who had chest
pain in association with palpitations and an hs-cTnT concentra-
tion rising from 6 ng/L on arrival to 43 ng/L at 12 hours, was
later diagnosed with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
Thus it would appear that this patient had type 2 AMI. While
contemporaneous knowledge of this would have excluded the
patient from the study, the diagnosis of supraventricular tachy-
cardia was not recognised until later and thus the patient was
eligible for inclusion. The other patient with AMI had an
hs-cTnT concentration of 6 ng/L rising to 18 ng/L at 6 hours.
CT coronary angiography showed a moderate stenosis to the left
anterior descending artery, but the patient did not undergo
coronary intervention. T
wo further patients in the ‘very low
risk’
group
had
ACS,

whom
underwent
symptom-induced coronary revascularisation within 30 days (4
and 8 days after presentation, respectively). A total of seven
(1.2%) further patients in the ‘very low risk group’ developed
the secondary outcome of angiographic stenosis detected within
30 days (without undergoing coronary intervention).
Paired comparison with the original MACS rule
A total of 1330 patients (187 with ACS including 150 with
AMI) had H-FABP concentrations available and were included
in the paired analysis. The AUC was 0.90 for MACS and 0.91
for T-MACS, giving an absolute difference of 0.01 (95% CI
0.00 to 0.02, p=0.06). The original MACS would have ‘ruled
out’ ACS in 18.0% (n=239) patients, of whom none had ACS,
compared with 40.5% (n=538) for T-MACS, of whom 3
(0.6%) had ACS. Thus, the sensitivity of MACS was 100.0%
(95% CI 98.1% to 100.0%) compared with 98.4% (95% CI
95.4% to 99.7%) for T-MACS: absolute difference 1.6%, 95%
CI=−0.7% to 1.6%, p=0.25. At this ‘rule out’ threshold,
however, the specificity of MACS was 20.9% (95% CI 18.6%
to 22.4%) compared with 46.8% (95% CI 43.9% to 49.8%)
for T-MACS: absolute difference 25.9% (95% CI 25.3% to
25.9%, p<0.0001; table 5).
As a ‘rule in’ tool (‘high risk’ vs ‘not high risk’) in the valid-
ation set, T-MACS ‘ruled in’ a smaller proportion of patients
than the original MACS (4.4% vs 5.5%, difference 1.1% (95%
CI 0.6% to 1.1%, p=0.0001). With MACS, 83.3% (n=60/72)
patients in the ‘high risk’ group had ACS compared with 91.4%
(n=53/58) with T-MACS.
Paired comparison with the ‘LoD strategy’
All 1459 patients in the validation set were included in this ana-
lysis. In total, 468 (32.1%) patients had hs-cTnT concentrations
<5 ng/L and no ECG ischaemia. Of those patients, 4 (0.9%)
had ACS (none of whom had AMI). The sensitivity of T-MACS
and the LoD strategy for ACS was identical (98.1%, absolute
difference 0.0%, 95% CI −2.2% to 2.2%, p=1.00), but
T-MACS had greater specificity (47.0% vs 37.2%, absolute dif-
ference 9.8%, 95% CI 6.7% to 12.7%, p<0.0001). Thus,
T-MACS would have ‘ruled out’ ACS in 40.4% (n=590)
patients, compared with 32.1% (n=468) for the LoD strategy
(see online supplementary table S5).
DISCUSSION
W
e have successfully re-derived and externally validated the
MACS model as T-MACS. T-MACS can now be used more
widely than MACS because it requires only the readily available

 hs-cTnT and not the less accessible H-FABP biomarker. Its use
requires a computerised calculation but implementation advice
and calculators are available on request from the lead author
(RB). Examples of the output from a T-MACS calculator are
demonstrated in the online supplementary material.
Although H-FABP was a strong predictor of ACS in our ori-
ginal study, its inclusion may present a barrier to clinical imple-
mentation at some centres, which has been highlighted in the
literature.12 13 This new evidence suggests that a model using
hs-cTnT as the only biomarker gives comparable sensitivity and
greater specificity as a ‘rule out’ tool. Importantly, T-MACS
would enable a greater proportion of patients to be ‘ruled out’
following a single blood test than either the original MACS
model or the LoD strategy. Interestingly, we noted that both
models
had
similar
specificity
in
the
derivation
cohort.
However, H-FABP was measured using a semi-automated ELISA
in that cohort. W
e used an automated assay in the validation set,
which is more relevant to clinical practice and may explain the
lower specificity of the original MACS model in that cohort.
T-MACS has the added advantage of risk-stratifying the
patients who cannot be ‘ruled out’, pending further investiga-
tion, such that patients in the ‘high risk group’ can be consid-
ered to have ACS ‘ruled in’ with high PPV
. This is particularly
important given concerns about the high prevalence of elevated
hs-cTnT concentrations among patients presenting to the ED
who do not have ACS.14 Emergency physicians need an effective
‘rule out’ tool and a tool that will determine which patients can
have ACS immediately confirmed. This would help to ensure
appropriate, selective and judicious use of high dependency and
specialist resources and would potentially enable early treatment
to be targeted to those who stand to benefit while minimising
unnecessary risk (pending further investigation) to lower risk
patients. It should be noted, however, that T-MACS is intended
to be assistive rather than directive and should therefore be used
alongside (rather than instead of) clinical judgement in any indi-
vidual clinical scenario.
Interestingly
, the coefficients in the original MACS meant that
no patient with an hs-cTnTconcentration >14 ng/L (the 99th per-
centile) could have ACS ‘ruled out’. In T-MACS, the absence of
H-FABP caused an adjustment such that the effective hs-cTnT
threshold is lower. With T-MACS, patients will only be ‘ruled out’
if each of the features incorporated in the model is absent and if
the hs-cTnT concentration is <10 ng/L, which was 40% of the
cohort. Thus, T-MACS presents another novel way of using
hs-cTnT concentrations below the 99th percentile to achieve early
‘rule out’, building on previous work evaluating the ‘LoD rule out’
and 1-hour strategies.3
15 While this feature does mean that
T-MACS could be used as a simple checklist (‘rule out’ only if each
feature is absent) without affecting sensitivity and NPV
, the
granularity of the model presented allows for superior overall risk
stratification and has potentially important advantages for clini-
cians and patients, which are potential avenues for future research.
Limitations
W
e should note that validation cohort 3 (Poole) excluded
patients with evidence of ECG ischaemia. MACS and T-MACS
are designed to risk-stratify ‘all comers’ with suspected cardiac
chest pain. This difference in inclusion criteria may therefore
account for the smaller proportion of patients in the ‘high risk’
group and the lower PPV of being ‘high risk’ in that cohort.
In addition, the T-MACS rule incorporates hs-cTnT concen-
trations, which relates to a single commercially available high
sensitivity troponin assay. Performance may be different with
other troponin assays and this should be a focus for future
work. Lastly, it is possible that decisions to undertake coronary
angiography were influenced by elements of the MACS and
T-MACS models (eg, ECG ischaemia or hs-cTnT concentration
in validation cohort 3, the only cohort in which hs-cTnT was
used in routine practice during the study period). This could
have influenced the observed incidence of this outcome in dif-
ferent MACS rule risk groups and is a potential limitation of all
observational research in this field.
Future directions
MACS and T-MACS show great promise to reduce the number
of unnecessary hospital admissions for patients who present to
EDs with chest pain. At present, chest pain is the most common
reason for emergency hospital admission, accounting for over a
quarter of a million hospital admissions each year in England
and W
ales alone.16 If 40% of those patients can be safely dis-
charged immediately from the ED following a single blood test,
the cost savings for health services will be substantial and this is
likely to have a large impact on the current challenges we face
with ED and hospital overcrowding.17 Following on from this
work, external validation in other cohorts will help to ensure
that our findings can be generalised to other settings. Our find-
ings also pave the way for evaluation of the impact of clinical
implementation, such as in the context of a randomised con-
trolled trial.
It is important to note that there are other emerging alterna-
tives that could potentially achieve a similar reduction in
unnecessary hospital admissions for these patients. Some strat-
egies rely on serial troponin testing over 1–2 hours15 18 19 while
others, such as the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk
Factors, T
roponin (HEART) score or Triage Rule-out Using
high-Sensitivity T
roponin protocol, could be used to discharge
patients after a single troponin test.13 20–22 There is growing evi-
dence to support the single test LoD rule out strategy.1–3 All of

 these strategies have relative advantages and disadvantages.
Single test strategies such as the T-MACS rule have the advan-
tage of facilitating rapid decisions soon after patients arrive in
the ED with minimal inconvenience for patients and no require-
ment for serial blood sampling.
It is, of course, possible that the optimal diagnostic pathway
will require a combination of a single test strategy (which will
‘rule in’ and ‘rule out’ ACS in a proportion of patients) followed
by serial sampling over 1–3 hours for patients who remain in
the ‘observational zone’ (which equates to the T-MACS ‘low’
and ‘moderate’ risk groups). At each time point, fewer patients
will remain in the observational zone until all patients have
either had ACS ‘ruled out’ or ‘ruled in’. Such a strategy may
make the most efficient use of healthcare resources and make
the most substantial contribution to unburdening overcrowded
EDs and hospitals, but will require further evaluation in clinical
practice.
Finally, it will be important to determine the acceptable risk
of missed ACS for a rule out strategy in practice. Clearly, no
strategy could ever achieve perfect sensitivity and NPV
. Even
with an observed NPV of 100.0%, the lower bound of the 95%
CI will always extend below that. Our work suggests that the
post-test probability of ACS in the T-MACS ‘very low risk’
group is <1%, which may be considered acceptable. It is
important to recognise, however, that the sensitivity is 98.8%
and thus 1.2% of patients with ACS would not be identified. An
international survey demonstrated that emergency physicians are
relatively risk averse, with only 40% accepting a 1% risk of
MACE within 30 days (and thus a 99% NPV).23 However, strat-
egies may be cost-effective at a much lower threshold and
patients may be willing to accept greater degrees of risk.24 The
use of the T-MACS model to facilitate shared decision making,
which has been shown to be effective in this patient group, is an
avenue worthy of future evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS
With a single blood test at the time of arrival in the ED,
T-MACS identifies 40% of patients as being at ‘very low risk’.
These patients have <1% probability of ACS, which may be
considered to ‘rule out’ the diagnosis. Similarly, T-MACS can
‘rule in’ ACS in approximately 5% of patients with high PPV
.
Future work should focus on evaluation of the impact of
T-MACS when used in practice, particularly when combined
with serial troponin sampling over 1–3 hours and in conjunction
with shared decision making.
