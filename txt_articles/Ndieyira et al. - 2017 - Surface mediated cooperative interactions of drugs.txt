The alarming increase of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics is now recognized 
as a major health issue fuelling demand for new drugs. Bacterial resistance is often caused by molecular 
changes at the bacterial surface, which alter the nature of specific drug-target interactions. Here, we 
identify a novel mechanism by which drug-target interactions in resistant bacteria can be enhanced. We 
examined the surface forces generated by four antibiotics; vancomycin, ristomycin, chloroeremomycin 
and oritavancin against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant targets on a cantilever and demonstrated 
significant differences in mechanical response when drug-resistant targets are challenged with 
different antibiotics although no significant differences were observed when using susceptible targets. 
Remarkably, the binding affinity for oritavancin against drug-resistant targets (70 nM) was found to 
be 11,000 times stronger than for vancomycin (800 μM), a powerful antibiotic used as the last resort 
treatment for streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA). Using an exactly solvable model, which takes into account the solvent and membrane 
effects, we demonstrate that drug-target interactions are strengthened by pronounced polyvalent 
interactions catalyzed by the surface itself. These findings further enhance our understanding of 
antibiotic mode of action and will enable development of more effective therapies.
While molecular recognition exhibits complementarities between a host and guest, cross-reactive binding at a 
single docking site is possible1,2. For a binding site to interact with different ligands, binding must be treated as a 
dynamic process with the population of the ensemble being in equilibrium, and shape of binding sites strongly 
influenced by the incoming partner3. However, in cell-mediated immune response4 and antimicrobial activ-
ity5, the doctrine of molecular selectivity is a prerequisite for ligand-receptor binding interactions. Vancomycin 
(Van) exemplifies this principle by specifically targeting amino acid residues of peptide domains which are only 
found in bacteria. Specific drug-target interactions not only inhibit cell wall biosynthesis6,7 but can also impose 
mechanical force on the overall cell via cell wall stress changes8. Modifications of receptors at the surface of a 
bacterium cell, however, can alter the selectivity of drug-target interactions in bacteria, thus inactivating the rec-
ognition mechanisms and associated mechanical stress. For example, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium 
and Staphylococcus aureus are well-known aetiological agents of a wide variety of infections caused by struc-
tural changes at a cellular target. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

(or VRSA)9 is caused by cell wall thickening while for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (or VRE) is conferred by 
the reprogramming of terminal alanine amino acid residues of bacterium cell10.
The alarming increase of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics is now recognized as a 
major health issue11 putting at risk society’s ability to treat common infections. To prevent and control the spread 
of AMR requires development of new drugs and novel interventions to infections. Since the discovery of peni-
cillin and other antibacterial agents, a large number of studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of how 
antibiotics induce cell death. Interestingly, in nearly all work on antimicrobial activity12 cell death is presumed 
to be primarily caused by the inhibition of one of a few essential cellular functions such as cell wall biosynthesis, 
protein synthesis and DNA or RNA signaling. The exploration of bacterial mechanobiology13 with the view to 
developing novel antibacterial therapies has, however, been largely overlooked.
Here, we show that the mechanical forces induced by drug-target interactions, regulated by solvent inter-
actions and membrane effects, are critical to our understanding of bactericidal activity against drug-resistant 
bacteria. In order to demonstrate that molecular changes within a membrane receptor can incapacitate recog-
nition and efficacy of drugs (Fig. 1a–d), we used two extracellular model targets found in bacterial cell enve-
lopes, herein termed vancomycin-susceptible receptor (or VSR)14 and a reprogrammed version of VSR termed 
vancomycin-resistant receptor (or VRR). While VSR functions as an attractive surface “lock” to sense an anti-
biotic’s “key”, the VRR motif is less attractive as a “lock” because of the changes in an amide NH group to an 
ester15 which increases the repulsive effects in an oxygen lone pair (Fig. 2). VSR and VRR were therefore used 
as targets to investigate the impact of a mismatch on the molecular recognition process. To dissect the mecha-
nisms involved in controlling molecular recognition processes and provide solutions to the mechanoselectivity 
in drug-resistant targets, we formulated for the first time an analytical theory, explicitly including solvent inter-
actions and membrane effects. We propose that confinement of drug molecules to a near-membrane layer can 
trigger their self-assembly through a process catalysed by the bacterial surface to enable formation of multimeric 
complexes which is fundamental to the creation of tight drug-target interactions16. Specifically, a near-membrane 
layer formed at the interface between bound receptors and solution, defined at a length of ~1 nm as determined 
from ionic strength of 0.1 M salt concentration under physiologically relevant conditions, shows that enhanced 
association kinetics of drugs at the cognate extracellular target is responsible for the surprising efficacy of anti-
biotics against drug-resistant strains (see definition of near membrane layer, Supplementary Information). We 
tested this concept on a panel of biologically relevant systems including; Van, the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved drug used as the last resort treatment of MRSA and clostridium difficile infections (CDIs)17, 
oritavancin (Ori or Orbactiv), a recently FDA-approved drug for treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue 
infections (cSSTIs) as well as ristomycin (Rist) and chloroeremomycin (CE). The latter two drug molecules are 
not in clinical use for treatment of bacterial infections. These drugs were also tested on the methicillin-susceptible 
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) cell line (ATCC 29213).
Results
Effect of near-membrane layer on ligand binding efficiency. 
To probe different pathways of sig-
nal-transduction central to the efficacy of recognition mechanisms and therapeutic agents, we used cantilever 
force-based technology. Because of its nanometre strain sensitivity, this technology can directly measure the 
smallest changes in mechanical strain caused by specific antibiotic binding. The principles of force transduc-
tion and measurements are well established18–20 and many studies focused on cantilever sensors have been pub-
lished21–27. Unlike conventional methods such as 1H–NMR spectroscopy28, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays (ELISA)29 or surface plasmon resonance (SPR)30 which measure optical signatures of chemical binding, 
cantilever technology has the capacity to resolve forces at the level of individual hydrogen bonds31, making it 
uniquely suited to provide important insight into force transduction mechanisms, such as cell wall strain in 
response to antibiotic binding. Moreover, in contrast to direct current or low-frequency signals, which cannot 
probe beyond electrical double layers formed by screening salts32,33, mechanical signaling is sensitive to ligands 
even when they are located at distance of ~1 nm or more from the sensor surface (Fig. 1d). Measurements were 
performed using cantilevers functionalized with self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of VSR, VRR or reference 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) (see methods & materials, Supplementary Information). The specificity of mechanical 
signaling was achieved by performing measurements in differential mode, where the bending response of the 
reference PEG-coated cantilevers, (known to reduce nonspecific drug adsorption8,14,34) was subtracted from VSR- 
and VRR-coated cantilever signals (see cantilever measurement procedure, method section).
As proof of concept and to understand how membrane effects regulate molecular recognition to stimulate 
force transduction and transmission, we investigated the impact of near-membrane rather than bulk solvent 
effects on the antibiotic binding efficiency. This was achieved by limiting the distance at which the membrane tar-
gets are felt by molecules in solution via changing the ionic strength of the medium whilst keeping the solution pH 
at 7.4 to reflect physiological conditions. Assays were performed under constant flow conditions at three different 
ionic strengths for the same antibiotic concentrations. While constant flow experiments can induce an offset 
during mechanical deflection measurements depending on the position of the chip within the flow system, such 
variations are eliminated if a scanning laser is aligned within the middle region of the position sensitive detector 
(PSD). Figure 3a shows the outcome after injection of Van against VSR, initially kept constant at 1000 μ 
M to 
ensure full surface coverage34. The results reveal a mechanical response, as measured by the free end deflection, of 
~150 nm when near-membrane layer thickness is ~50 nm and ~220 nm for a layer thickness of ~1 nm (Fig. 3a,b). 
The measurements show that the association kinetics of Van accelerate with decreasing near-membrane layer 
thickness. This is because when near-membrane distance is reduced the effect of ionic shielding and molecular 
charge is increased thus permitting close contact between the drug molecules and so triggering attractive forces, 
such as induced dipole interaction, which are important for occasioning complex aggregation of drug molecules 
(whose strength is determined by the complex aggregation constant K1, the equilibrium dissociation constant

of ligand-ligand interactions). Conversely, when a near-membrane layer thickness is increased, ionic shielding 
and molecular charge is reduced, thus hindering molecules from close contact and decreasing the association 
kinetics35. To explain the general principle of the observed mechanical response we hypothesize that prior to the 
introduction of Van molecules (as shown by grey shaded area in Fig. 3a), receptor molecules interact with each 
other only weakly, if at all, which explains the minimal or zero mechanical response relative to the reference PEG 
control. However, the exposure of Van to VSR leads to the formation of Van-VSR complexes, which carry an 
electrostatic charge36. The resulting electrostatic repulsive and steric interactions between Van-VSR complexes 
induce local strain in the silicon, which creates compressive stress on the Au top surface (Fig. 3a). For the cantile-
ver to bend downwards with the inclusion of bound complex, we propose that the monolayer on top must expand, 
imparting a tensile stress on the membrane receptor itself.
Chemical functionality of groups remote from the binding sites explain high affinity required 
for enhanced force transduction. 
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of membrane effects in regulat-
ing molecular recognition to enhance force transduction, we considered the interaction of drugs at the interface 
Figure 1. Complex interplay between unrestricted solution phase and membrane targets. (a) Schematic 
representation of Gram-positive bacteria with lipid membrane (blue) surrounded by cell wall composed of 
peptidoglycan layers anchored to the cell membrane. The peptidoglycan backbone consists of repeat polymers 
of two amino sugars of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid (white solid lines) which are linked 
to short peptide precursors or bridges (red solid lines). In the absence of antibiotics, the peptide precursors 
are cross-linked via a peptide bridge with other peptides attached to neighboring glycan chains, resulting into 
three-dimensional rigid network that is vital for mechanical strength, desired for exoskeletal bacterial function; 
for clarity, only a two-dimensional network is shown. (b) Schematic representation of the corresponding 
bacterial cell treated with antibiotics (blue chemical structural cartoons) which bind to the peptide precursors 
(red solid lines) from the glycan backbone to form drug-target complexes that may block rigid network 
formation and essential cellular activities. (c) Schematic representation of possible binding events occurring 
between antibiotics in solution and membrane bound targets. This is consistent with the picture that following 
the application of a lethal antibiotic dose, the insertion of drug molecules into bacterium cell wall can induce 
a local strain which grows as the number of reacted regions grow until a deleterious strain is generated, 
weakening overall mechanical strength as well as the ability for the cell to counteract high internal osmotic 
pressure (yielding cracks on the cell wall – yellow depression) which bacteria cannot ultimately withstand, 
leaving bacterium susceptible to lysis and death. (d) Schematic representation of drug molecules binding to a 
model to bacterial cell wall (red and blue circles), generating stress due to the electrostatic repulsive and steric

between bacterial surface and solution to be defined by three-dimensional (3-D) rates and affinity constants, 
while the induced mechanical response following drug binding is restricted to a two-dimensional (2-D) envi-
ronment (Fig. 1a–d). In the first set of experiments, we assessed whether the 2-D boundary layer could mediate 
more efficient complex aggregation of antibiotics and thus lead to enhanced signal transduction compared to a 
3-D solution. To achieve this, diacetyl vancomycin susceptible receptor (or Ac-VSR)14 was added to the solution 
containing Van or Ori in order to act as a competitor against membrane bound VRR. Van and Ori were cho-
sen because they have consistent binding affinity of ~1 μ 
M37 against Ac-VSR and ~4200 μ 
M37 against VRR. The 
concentrations of Van and Ori in solution were kept constant at 50 μ 
M and 0.1 μ 
M respectively. These particular 
concentrations were chosen because (1) they give rise to relatively large mechanical bending signals, (2) they 
fall within the linear portions of the Langmuir adsorption isotherms, and (3) they require relatively low levels of 
Ac-VSR to inhibit the mechanical response at the surface. We therefore reasoned that if the interaction between a 
drug and Ac-VSR is independent of any surface effects then the amount of Ac-VSR which inhibits the mechanical 
response at a surface is expected to be the same for both Van and Ori. The concentration of antagonist (Ac-VSR) 
that gives rise to 50% inhibition (IC50) of drug-receptor interactions at the surface was used as measure of mem-
brane effects on the association kinetics and mechanical response. Figure 3c shows the cantilever deflection as a 
function of Ac-VSR in solution against Van at 50 μ 
M. With increasing levels of Ac-VSR cantilever deflection was 
found to decrease as a result of the lower levels of free Van molecules available to interact with the membrane 
bound VRR molecules. The mechanical response with Van was completely inhibited at 500 μ 
M Ac-VSR. With 
0.1 μ 
M Ori, however, more than 500 μ 
M of Ac-VSR was required to inhibit the mechanical response which sug-
gests that Ori has a stronger drug-target interaction at the surface than Van (Fig. 3d). The reproducibility of these 
measurements were tested using four separate chips, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3e,f. To calculate the 
IC50, we analyzed the data using equation (1), whose detailed derivation has been reported previously14.

ligand1 is the mechanical stress generated by ligand1 in the absence 
of a competing ligand2, σ 
ligand2 is the corresponding minimum stress generated by ligand1 in the presence of a large 
excess of the concentration of competing ligand2. The outcome of the fit of equation (1) superimposed onto the 
mechanical stress data reveal an IC50 of 15.4 ± 
 0.2 μ 
M for Van and 50.7 ± 
 2.1 μ 
M for Ori (Fig. 3e,f). The IC50 for 
Ori is 3-fold larger than that of Van. The results support the prediction that a 2-D boundary layer is superior to a 
3-D solvent in accelerating the association kinetics of ligands thus enabling multivalent interactions that lead to 
stronger binding and enhanced mechanical force transduction (Fig. 3d).
That a near-membrane layer is critical in driving the recognition and efficacy of drugs at a surface (Fig. 3f), 
was further confirmed by examining the binding affinity of Van, Rist, CE and Ori to targets in solution and at a 
surface (Fig. 4a). The binding affinity against VRR in solution was found to be identical for all four antibiotics in

In VRR phenotype, a single hydrogen bond is deleted from the drug binding pocket distinguishing between 
vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The X group (red) on the of drug susceptible 
phenotype corresponds to a mutation of an amide group to an ester, conferring antimicrobial resistance in 
vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. The measurements show that chemical R1 and R2 groups added at sites 
remote from the binding pocket could control the mechanical forces induced from drug-target interactions to 
effect bactericidal activity.

the millimolar range. Similarly, with VSR the binding affinity was virtually indistinguishable for all antibiotics in 
the micromolar range. Remarkably, however, when VRR at a surface was considered, the antibiotics displayed 
non-uniform binding constants. Moreover, a clear difference was observed between the strength of interactions 
and ability of antibiotic molecules to polymerise in solution (Fig. 4a). These findings lend support to the hypothe-
sis that a near-membrane layer has a significant influence on molecular recognition and binding efficiency.
Mechanical force and microbial susceptibility. 
To investigate whether enhanced antibiotic binding 
efficiency has any impact on bacterial cell growth, we compared the binding affinity, Ksurf or surface thermody-
namic equilibrium dissociation constant of drug-target interactions (Supplementary Table S1), to the Minimum 
Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values from four different types of bacteria (Supplementary Table S2, S3). 
Figure 4b shows the logarithmic plots for Ksurf versus MICs for all four bacterial samples. The data demonstrated 
a linear correlation between binding affinity and MICs over a large, 10,000-fold, range. Weak binders were found 
to have high MICs while those with the strongest binding affinity exhibited lower MIC values. Our results are in 
agreement with previous findings using SPR measurements whereby vancomycin analogs with differing binding 
affinities were used to inhibit S. aureus RN4220 (ref. 30).
In order to test the idea that a strong drug binder can generate large-scale mechanical strain on a bacterium 
surface to impact on its vitality, we examined the mechanical response generated from binding of an antibiotic 
to its resistant and susceptible targets. We first used slow bacteriostatic Van and rapid bactericidal Ori38 against 
two different bacterial cell wall targets for which Ori and Van concentrations were initially kept constant at 3 μ 
M 
(Fig. 5a,b). Van was found to show a reduced overall stress transduction against VSR, and no effect on the VRR, 
compared with Ori, which showed a significantly large mechanical response against both VRR and VSR targets, 
when measurements were repeated with 3 μ 
M to match the experimental conditions for Van (Fig. 5b). In addi-
tion, we found that the buffer washing step alone cannot fully remove successive drug injections, particularly for 
strong surface binders such as Ori and therefore an additional washing step using 10 mM hydrochloric acid was 
necessary to regenerate the surface for quantitative analysis. The finding that Ori which tends to polymerise more 
strongly in solution37 generates high mechanical stress against bacterial targets on a cantilever prompted us to 
repeat the experiments using CE which also has strong complex aggregation ability37. The stress transduction of 
3 μ 
M CE yielded deflection signals of 20 nm for VRR and 120 nm for VSR targets, respectively (Fig. 6a). These 
results demonstrate that antibiotics which polymerise strongly in solution are able to interact with both resistant 
and susceptible targets. To explain the non-bending response observed in Van against the VRR target, we have 
made the assumption that the complementarities between antibiotics and membrane targets govern molecular 
recognition to regulate the levels of mechanical signaling. However, the presence of repulsive effects in the oxygen 
lone pair within the drug’s binding site weakens the Van-VRR bound complex, as well as the deletion of hydro-
gen bond formation10,15. Correspondingly, the molecular recognition in the case of CE or Ori against the VRR 
is also explained as a “lock-key” type binding interaction39. However, the enhanced multiple and cooperative 
receptor-ligand interactions effectively overcome the repulsive effects in the oxygen lone pair10,15 to increase the

function of complex aggregation constants, K1. (b) Double logarithmic plot of Ksurf versus experimentally

and β ~ 0.9 ± 0.2 is the power law and Ksol = K1 (red dotted lines). The surface stress data error bars were 
determined as the standard deviation of the surface stress data fitted measurements from four separate 
cantilever chips. The results show that by considering measurements which quantify near membrane layer and 
solution effects, we can unlock the connections between specificity of interaction of antibiotics and the 
corresponding mechanics of bacterial cell walls’ targets responsible for the destruction of bacteria.

mechanical response and bactericidal activity. So far, no experiments have ever successfully demonstrated that 
Ori can target drug-susceptible and drug-resistant targets with consistently tighter binding interactions. This 
shows force-based technology plays a key role, and could offer a new way for rapid profiling of clinically impor-
tant molecules, as well as for sensitive characterization of the relative efficacy of drugs.
To further examine the role of a strong drug binder on the mechanical strain, we repeated the experiments 
using Van, Rist, CE and Ori at a concentration of 10 μ 
M. This particular concentration was chosen because it gives 
a saturation stress signal against VSR and is within the clinically relevant range of antibiotic dose (3–27 μ 
M)40. 
Figure 6b demonstrates that a relatively large mechanical response is obtained for each antibiotic against VSR 
where the mean compressive surface stress was found to be ~33 ± 3 mNm−1. In contrast the compressive surface 
stress with VRR varied for each antibiotic; Van ~0.4 mNm−1, Rist ~2 mNm−1, CE ~6 mNm−1 and Ori ~23 mNm−1 
(Fig. 6c). The observed difference in mechanical response between VRR and VSR was confirmed statistically. 
Using one-way ANOVA (Supplementary Table S4, S5) the difference in the level of mechanical response for VRR 
against different antibiotics was significant (P < 
 0.000). However there was no significant difference with VSR 
 
(P = 
 0.059). This was further confirmed using an independent sample t-test in which the mechanical response 
for each antibiotic against VSR and VRR was found to be significant ((P < 
 0.001), see Supplementary Table S6). 
We hypothesize that the reduced mechanical response in VRR could be caused by the repulsive effects in oxygen 
lone pair conferred by the reprogramming of the terminal alanine amino acid residues of bacterium cell10 or by 
the changes in the phenotypic mechanical plasticity13.
We next determined the critical threshold force sensitivity, s, for therapeutically effective drugs such as Ori 
against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacteria. To achieve this, we used the relation s = 
 σ 
eq/n, where n is the 
number of receptor molecules per cantilever, estimated at ~1011 (Supplementary Table S7), and σ

step, 3 μ 
M Van, buffer washing step and 3 μ 
M Ori and again buffer washing step to remove the drug. Here we 
show that the buffer washing step alone cannot fully remove successive drug injections particularly for strong 
surface binders such as Van against VSR and so an additional washing step using 10 mM hydrochloric acid 
is necessary to regenerate the surface for further use. The MIC values are included for the drug-susceptible 
(red text) and drug-resistant targets (blue text) to demonstrate the power of cantilever assays in predicting the 
efficacy of drugs under identical conditions. The findings in effect imply that modestly sized drug molecules 
such as Ori could be designed to successfully target drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacteria in equal 
measure.

drug-susceptible bacteria cannot ultimately withstand (Fig. 6b,c). By assuming that each drug-target complex acts 
independently, the deleterious force sensitivity was estimated to be ~20 fNm−1. The finding that therapeutically 
effective drugs such as Ori generate high force sensitivity prompted us to investigate the correlation between 
mechanical force and microbial susceptibility. We quantified the mechanical force arising from binding of drugs 
to their bacterial targets on a cantilever (Fig. 6a–c) using the equation F = kΔ 
z, where Δ 
z is the cantilever deflec-
tion signal and k is its nominal spring constant of 0.02 Nm−1. Figure 6d shows the force generated with VSR and 
VRR using four different cantilever chips and more than 30 measurements plotted against the MICs obtained 
from vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. An excellent linear correlation 
was observed between mechanical force and MIC (Fig. 6d). The MIC of Van against MSSA bacteria was 0.67 μ 
M 
and is consistent with the ~3 nN mechanical force generated against VSR on the cantilever (Fig. 6b). In contrast, 
the large ~3.6 nN mechanical force generated by Ori against VSR correlates with the low 0.03 μ 
M MIC value of 
Ori against MSSA. These results are consistent with the time–kill kinetics which is typically between ~6–24 h for 
Van, a slow bacteriostatic drug, and 15 min-2 h for Ori, which displays rapid bactericidal activity38. Van and Ori 
have different functional chemical groups R1 and R2 located remote from their binding pockets but both share 
a structurally equivalent peptide backbone. This suggests that enhanced bactericidal action can be effected by 
modifying drug molecules with additional functional groups (Fig. 2). The consistency between the bacterial cell 
assays and cantilever based measurements strongly suggest that large-scale mechanical forces may play a vital role 
in bactericidal activity.

Modelling mechanisms of antibiotic activity. 
Thus far, we have discussed the impact of near-membrane 
layer on the association kinetics, mechanical force transduction, specificity of molecular recognition and micro-
bial susceptibility. To gain mechanistic insight (Fig. 7a,b), we averaged measurements for each drug-target 
interaction over four separate chips and the results are summarized in Fig. 7c,d. To determine the equilibrium 
dissociation constant Ksurf, quantitative assays as shown in Fig. 7c,d were determined under steady-state equi-
librium conditions for a range of concentrations for each drug-receptor combination. The mechanical signaling 
response follows an s-shaped curve undergoing its steepest rise at N ~1/Ksurf before reaching a plateau when the 
binding sites are fully occupied (Fig. 7c,d). To calculate Ksurf, we used equation (2)14, based on the conventional 
Hill adsorption model41.

Here, Ksurf is raised to the power n to ensure that it maintains the dimension of concentration as n varies. Setting 
n = 
 1 yields the Langmuir isotherm where the reactions occur independently, while n > 
 1 corresponds to posi-
tive co-operative polyvalent interactions and n < 
 1 is a measure of negative co-operativity. In Fig. 7c,d, we find 
that the mechanical response at VSR levels off at 50 μ 
M concentration for all antibiotics. In contrast, for the 
drug-resistant VRR a concentration of more than 1000 μ 
M of Van, Rist or CE was required to reach indistin-
guishable maximum signals. The outcome of the fit using three parameters (n, Ksurf and σ 
max) is summarized 
in Supplementary Fig. 2. The calculated Ksurf for Ori binding to VSR is 40 ± 
 10 nM, which is 25 times stronger 
than for Van where Ksurf is 1.0 ± 
 0.3 μ 
M. The Ksurf of Ori against VRR is 70 ± 
 10 nM, an astonishing 11,000 times 
stronger than for Van where Ksurf is 800 ± 
 300 μ 
M. As a further measurement control and to confirm the accuracy 
of surface binding affinity, we used a commercially available SPR method (Fig. 7e,f and Supplementary SPR sen-
sor chip functionalization procedure), where the detection of ligands is at a single planar metal surface30. The cal-
culated Ksurf of 1.0 ± 0.3 μ 
M for Van is indistinguishable from the SPR response-based Ksurf value of 1.1 ± 0.4 μ 
M, 
which suggests that the mechanical assays give the same biophysical parameters as gold-standard biophysical 
methods.
Next, we analyzed the underlying Hill coefficient n of each drug/receptor pair and found that n ≤ 
 1 for Van 
and Rist, while n > 
 1 for CE and Ori (Supplementary Table S1), implying that as long as K3 > K2 for the lat-
ter drugs, the surface interaction is polyvalent. However, the model Hill equation is purely phenomenological 
and so cannot account for the interrelation of solution and surface influences on the catalytic cycle of mul-
tiple interactions. To gain mechanistic insight, we solved the equilibrium equations for Model I (see, Case I, 
Supplementary Information) to obtain

Inspection of equations (3–5) shows how multivalent and cooperative effects arise - the Taylor expansion of 
equations (3) and (4) will add higher order terms, with positive coefficients in N to the numerator and denom-
inator of equation (3) provided K3 > K2, meaning that fits to equation (2) will yield Hill coefficients n > 
 1. 
Accordingly, we modeled the entire stress data using equation (3) with 3 fitting parameters (σ 
max, K2 and K3) 
for each membrane receptor, while fixing K1, to the tabulated values (Supplementary Table S1). For algebraic 
convenience all the equilibrium constants K1–K6 in the models and equations below are in the form of associ-
ation constants (1/M) while the plotted and tabulated values are shown in the form of disassociation constants 
(M). The maximum mechanical stress σ 
max was fixed at 33.9 ± 
 3 mNm−1 for VSR and 19.2 ± 
 2 mNm−1 for VRR, 
respectively (Fig. 7c,d, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S8), because of the simplifying hypothesis, 
which states that the mechanical saturation stresses for ligand complexes should depend only on the match-
ing of a docking site to an incoming ligand. Moreover, our recent work34 has shown the practical need for this 
hypothesis - when the surface coverage is low, the stress contribution is insufficient to allow independent deter-
mination of σ 
max and Ksurf values. The outcome of the fit of equation (3) is summarized in Fig. 7c which shows 
good fit to the VSR data. The remarkably good agreement for VSR shows for the first time that an exactly solved 
equilibrium model with only a single control parameter, K1, can account for the full variability in the activity 
of antibiotics against drug-susceptible targets. However, Model I fails dramatically for the VRR data (Fig. 7c) – 
 
the “best” fit gives a variability (determined by K1) in the half-height point of the Langmuir curves of only two 
orders of magnitude, while the experimental variability is four orders of magnitude.

There are various possible explanations for the failure of Model I. The most trivial, not entailing any surface 
effects apart from those in the 3-D solution, is that multivalent interactions produce different mechanical stresses 
than monovalent binding – this translates mathematically into a formula identical to equation (3), but with dif-
ferent weightings of Nm and Np in the numerator. Our attempt to fit the data with this generalization was unable 
to account for the much larger variability in K1 of the VRR data. As an admittedly non-unique attempt to improve 
on Model I, but in direct response to the strongly implied importance of the surface effects in mediating cooper-
ative processes discussed above, we included a near-membrane layer between the 2-D surface and 3-D solution, 
yielding Model II (see, Case II, Supplementary Information). This approach allows monovalent and multivalent 
ligands in solution to enter and exit a near-membrane layer, either to the surface bound states or back to solution, 
at rates characterized by the interconversion equilibrium constant K4, within a membrane layer. The additional 
equilibrium equations were solved analytically to yield

The terms K1–K6 are the equilibrium constants defined in Fig. 7b. The identical form of equations (3) and 
(6) show that α and γ are renormalized binding coefficients for monovalent and multivalent interactions. It is 
possible that the aggregation of antibiotic monomers near the interface is facilitated by attractive forces, such as 
induced dipole interaction and charges. Thus, the difference in the free energy of binding may be caused by the 
changes in the dimensionality, as well as any other effects that could arise from a constrained environment. The 
standard approach for translating 3-D binding constants in solution to 2-D membrane environment was first 
proposed by Bell42 and modified by Honig and colleagues43. We note that in Bell’s model the possibility that there 
could be a transition from monovalent to polyvalent interactions at a near-membrane layer even when there is 
none in solution was not considered, so we have simply generalized Bell’s equation to the form K4 = 
 hK1 + 
 K0, 
where K0 is the membrane receptor’s own contribution to multiple interactions and h is the inverse of the length 
representing the effective thickness (transverse to the surface) of near membrane layer to relate the solution and 
surface reactions. Moreover, given that the molecules studied differ only in the chemical functionality of groups 
remote from the ligand binding site, and that the tracking of either monovalent or multivalent ligand complexes 
at the near-membrane layer ought not depend strongly on these groups, the equilibrium constants in equation (7) 
are combined to produce the constants Cα = 
 (K5(K3/K2)^1) and Cγ = 
 (K6(K3/K2)^2), which again are unlikely to 
depend strongly on the chemical functionality of remote groups. Consequently, equation (7) is solved to obtain a 
simplified form for α and γ in equation (8).

Further work using more microscopic techniques such as X-ray scattering and NMR will be required to 
understand the individual contributions of these equilibrium constants and to validate the simplifying assump-
tions made above.
In light of Model II, we fitted equations (6) and (8) to antibiotic stress data with 5 parameters (σ 
max, Cα, 
Cγ, K0 and h), where K1 was fixed to the tabulated values (Supplementary Table S1). In Fig. 7d, we show that 
after accounting for the surface effects, there are improvements to the fits in both the VSR and VRR data, 
although we observed a less than perfect fit in the case of CE VRR data. The quantitative results from this anal-
ysis are consistent with the global fits of the antibiotic stress data using Model II to both VSR and VRR sur-
face targets, revealing K0 ~ 4 nM for VRR and K0 ~ 30 M for VSR and h = 
 0.011, common to both surface targets 
(Supplementary Table S8). The very large K0 (i.e. K0 ≫ 
 hK1), implies that the surface effects for VRR data cannot 
be neglected. In contrast, for VSR, the very small K0 (i.e. K0 ≪ hK1) suggests that it is the solution rather than the 
surface effects that dominate the recognition process, in good agreement with equation (3). Although a good fit 
does not prove that a model is correct, there are several reasons to believe that the proposed model is likely to rep-
resent an accurate approximation of the role a membrane bound receptor plays in driving the binding activities. 
First, the binding parameters obtained in Models I and II are the same in case of VSR data. Second, the idea that 
the contribution of membrane binding is a cooperative process as determined by the Hill equation is consistent 
with the proposed model. Third, there is consistency from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives for the 
membrane reactions as evidenced by the experimental data. Finally, the fact that the competitive inhibition via 
Ac-VSR is much weaker for Van than Ori (Fig. 3c–f) shows clearly that it is near-membrane rather than solvent 
effects that are dominant factors in determining the pharmacological efficacy of newer bactericidal drugs such 
as Ori.
Discussion
Our experiments have shown unequivocally the importance of surface effects in the mediation of molecular 
cooperativity and the understanding of antibiotic’s action, furthermore we have made significant steps in unrav-
eling the mechanisms by which a near membrane surface layer regulates molecular association kinetics both 
for mechanical force transduction and microbial susceptibility. Indeed, even though it is widely accepted that

vancomycin analogues inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis without substrate binding44, here we show that such 
binding can also contribute to enhanced bactericidal activity of drugs. We find that while a single site binding 
mechanism in a pre-existing ensemble of conformational states dominates the behavior of susceptible targets, it 
fails dramatically for drug-resistant targets. However, by including solvent interactions and membrane effects, we 
demonstrate by comparing an exactly solvable model to our data that the formation of polyvalent interactions 
catalyzed by the surface itself can account for the enhanced Ksurf of Ori on drug-resistant targets of 70 ± 
 10 nM, 
an astonishing 11,000 times stronger than for Van where the Ksurf is 800 ± 
 300 μ 
M. This finding is in agreement 
with solid-state NMR, which has concluded that Ori is a more potent inhibitor of the transpeptidation process 
than transglycosylation45.
The molecular binding events occurring between antibiotics in solution and at membrane bound targets were 
found to enhance the binding efficiency and mechanical stress signals. Our results from intact bacterial cell assays 
and stress measurements suggest that bactericidal activity is linked to the extent of molecular recognition and 
associated mechanical force transduction. We find four orders of magnitude of bactericidal activity are strongly 
linked to mechanical force, consistent with the picture that following the application of a lethal dose, the insertion 
of antibiotic molecules into bacterium cell walls can induce a local strain, which grows as the number of reacted 
regions grows, until a deleterious strain is generated which the bacteria cannot ultimately withstand (Fig. 1c). 
Consequently, this weakens the overall mechanical strength required to counteract high internal osmotic pres-
sure, leaving bacterium cells susceptible to lysis and death. In summary, we show that by developing the prin-
ciples46,47 underlying the interactions of drugs in solution and at a surface, it will be possible to provide more 
mechanistic insight to fully establish the link between the perturbations observed here and the mode of microbial 
killing activity. Our findings will aid in the rational design of novel molecules that could be further optimized 
by using numerical modeling prior to synthesis to ensure that they can successfully target drug-susceptible and 
drug-resistant bacteria in equal measure. Beyond our key results that near-membrane effects are very important 
to pharmacological research, our systematic experiments on model cell wall motifs provide a new framework for 
understanding and eventually designing devices for rapid quantitative screening, as well as for assessing the rela-
tive efficacy of drugs. This should be generally applicable to problems in biochemical signaling and pharmacology 
where the target molecules form relatively dense networks on cell surfaces.
Methods
Cantilever measurement procedure. 
The modified cantilever chip was mounted in a sealed liquid cell. The 
alignment of each light source onto the free end of each cantilever was confirmed by heating liquid chamber to 1 °C 
rise. All eight Au-coated cantilever arrays were found to undergo compressive downward bending because of the 
bimetallic effect caused by the differences in expansion rates of silicon and Au. Care was taken so that the optical 
alignment error was less than 5% between the minimum and maximum bending signals within the cantilever arrays. 
In addition, the resonant frequency of all eight Au-coated cantilever arrays was measured to ensure that the variation 
of spring constant between each cantilever within a chip was ≤ 
1%. The absolute deflection at the free-end of each 
cantilever ∆ 
zabs was measured using a time-multiplexed optical detection system in different liquid environments 
(Scentris, Veeco Instruments Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The desired flow rate was first determined before each 
experiment to ensure a constant flow rate for all the arrays. The data acquisition was automated using LabView 
(National Instruments Co., Austin, TX, USA) software via a 6-way valve (Serial MVP, Hamilton, Reno, NV
, USA). 
All cantilever bending signals were acquired under an average liquid flow rate of 30–180 μ 
L min−1. The equilibrium 
differential cantilever bending signals were not found to be significantly dependent on the direction or fluid flow 
rates. The measurement protocol involved the following steps, (1) sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1 M) for 5 or 
10 minutes to establish a baseline; (2) injection of antibiotics in sodium phosphate buffer for 30–60 minutes; (3) to 
dissociate the complex, sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1 M) wash for 10–30 minutes; (4) a further washing step 
using 10 mM HCl for another 30 minutes to regenerate the membrane surface targets; and (5) finally another sodium 
phosphate buffer step for 10 minutes to restore the baseline signal. We investigated the impact of surface regener-
ation by undertaking repeated regeneration measurements with more than 10 cycles using 10 mM hydrochloric 
acid and found that the quality of sensing layers can deteriorate if a large number of receptor regeneration steps are 
employed particularly when using acidic reagents, thus limiting the lifetime of the sensor itself. The detection spec-
ificity was achieved by performing measurements in differential mode, where the bending response of the reference 
PEG-coated cantilevers, was subtracted from VSR- and VRR-coated cantilever signals.
Data analysis and statistical characterization. 
To convert the bending signals into differential surface 
stress, the raw data from each set of separate cantilever chips were were analyzed off-line using automated data 
software to rapidly analyze large data sets and remove user bias. The bending signals were converted into differen-
tial surface stress between the upper and lower sides of the cantilever, according to the Stoney’s equation

ance associated with between-array measurements in agreement with our previous findings8. In this manuscript,

surface stress and a negative absolute deflection to the upward bending of cantilevers due to a tensile surface

of measurements, concentration and the number of cantilever chips. The statistical analysis was performed by 
using IBM SPSS Statistics software (IBM Corporation) and the results are summarized in the Supplementary Ta
ble S4, S5 and S6.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement procedure. 
The SPR sensor chip functionalization 
procedure is summarized (see methods & materials Supplementary Information) while the measurement proto-
col has been described previously34. In brief we used a T100 BIAcore SPR instrument in which a series of binding 
analyses for Van was performed. Figure 7e,f shows the differential SPR signal in which the responses increases 
with increasing Van concentration. The corresponding SPR response signals featured an S-shaped curve, with 
a steep rise, then a plateau when Van concentration was increased beyond 50 μ

Author Contributions
J.W.N. conceived the original idea of the effects of remote chemical functionality of groups on the efficacy of 
drugs in activating large-scale mechanical force transduction. J.W.N., R.A.M. and G.A. conceived the idea that 
a single control parameter, K1, can account for the full variability in the activity of antibiotics against drug-
susceptible and drug-resistant targets. J.W.N. introduced a near-membrane layer between the 2-D surface and 
3-D solution. J.W.N. and G.A. formulated the mathematical description of the analytical model and J.W.N. and 
J.B. implemented the model in software. J.W.N., S.B.P. and M.V. prepared Figures 1, 5, 6 and 7. J.W.N. performed 
the measurements and wrote the manuscript. J.B., S.B.P., M.V., M.A.C., C.A., R.A.M. and G.A. reviewed and 
modified the manuscript text.
