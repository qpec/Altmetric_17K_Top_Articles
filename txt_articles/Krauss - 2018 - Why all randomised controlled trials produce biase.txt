Why all randomised controlled trials produce biased results

ABSTRACT
Background: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are commonly viewed as the best research
method to inform public health and social policy. Usually they are thought of as providing the
most rigorous evidence of a treatment’s effectiveness without strong assumptions, biases and
limitations.
Objective: This is the first study to examine that hypothesis by assessing the 10 most cited RCT
studies worldwide.
Data sources: These 10 RCT studies with the highest number of citations in any journal were
identified by searching Scopus (the largest database of peer-reviewed journals).
Results: This study shows that these world-leading RCTs that have influenced policy produce
biased results by illustrating that participants’ background traits that affect outcomes are often
poorly distributed between trial groups, that the trials often neglect alternative factors contribu-
ting to their main reported outcome and, among many other issues, that the trials are often
only partially blinded or unblinded. The study here also identifies a number of novel and import-
ant assumptions, biases and limitations not yet thoroughly discussed in existing studies that
arise when designing, implementing and analysing trials.
Conclusions: Researchers and policymakers need to become better aware of the broader set of
assumptions, biases and limitations in trials. Journals need to also begin requiring researchers to
outline them in their studies. We need to furthermore better use RCTs together with other
research methods.
KEY MESSAGES
� RCTs face a range of strong assumptions, biases and limitations that have not yet all been
thoroughly discussed in the literature.
� This study assesses the 10 most cited RCTs worldwide and it shows, more generally, that trials
inevitably produce bias.
� Trials involve complex processes – from randomising, blinding and controlling, to implement-
ing treatments, monitoring participants etc. – that require many decisions and steps at differ-
ent levels that bring their own assumptions and degree of bias to results.

Introduction
How well a given treatment may work can greatly
influence our lives. But before we decide whether to
take a treatment we generally want to know how
effective it may be. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
are commonly conducted by randomly distributing
people into treatment and control groups to test if a
treatment may be effective. Researchers in fields like
medicine [1–4], psychology [5] and economics [6,7]
often claim that this method is the only reliable means
to properly inform medical, social and policy decisions;
it is an ultimate benchmark against which to assess
other
methods;
and
it
is
exempt
from
strong
theoretical assumptions, methodological biases and
the influence of researchers (or as exempt as possible)
which non-randomised methods are subject to.
This study assesses the hypothesis that randomised
experiments estimate the effects of some treatment
without strong assumptions, biases and limitations. In
assessing this hypothesis, the 10 most cited RCT stud-
ies worldwide are analysed. These include highly influ-
ential randomised experiments on the topics of stroke
[8], critically ill patients receiving insulin therapy [9],
breast cancer and chemotherapy [10], estrogen and
postmenopause [11], colorectal cancer [12], two trials
on cholesterol and coronary heart disease [13,14] and

 three trials on diabetes [15–17]. While these trials are
related to the fields of general medicine, biology and
neurology, the insights outlined here are as useful for
researchers and practitioners using RCTs across any
field including psychology, neuroscience, economics
and, among others, agriculture.
In any trial, a degree of bias arises because some
share of recruited people refuse to participate in any
trial (which leads to sample bias), some degree of par-
tial blinding or unblinding of the various trial persons
generally arises in any trial (which leads to selection
bias), participants generally take treatment for different
lengths of time and different dosages in any trial
(which leads to measurement bias), among other
issues. The ten most cited RCTs assessed here suffer
from such general issues. But they also suffer from
other methodological issues that affect their estimated
results as well: participants’ background characteristics
are often poorly allocated across trial groups, partici-
pants at times switch between trial groups, trials often
neglect alternative factors contributing to their main
reported outcome, among others. Some of these
issues cannot be avoided in trials – and they affect the
robustness of their results and conclusions. This study
thereby contributes to the literature on the methodo-
logical biases and limits of RCTs [1,18–25], and a num-
ber of meta-analyses of RCTs also indicate that trials at
times face different biases, using common assessment
criteria
including
randomisation,
double-blinding,
dropouts and withdrawals [20,21,26]. To help reduce
biases, trial reporting guidelines [1,18] have been
important but these need to be significantly improved.
A critical concern for trial quality is that only some
trials report the common methodological problems.
Even fewer explain how these problems affect their tri-
al’s results. And no existing trials report all such prob-
lems and explain how they influence trial outcomes.
Exacerbating the situation, these are only some of the
more commonly known problems. This study’s main
contribution is outlining a larger set of important
assumptions, biases and limitations facing RCTs that
have
not
yet
all
been
thoroughly
discussed
in
trial studies.
Better
understanding
the
limits
of
randomised
experiments is very important for research, policy and
practice. Trials, while many help improve the condi-
tions of those treated, all have at least some degree of
bias in their estimated results and at times mis-
guidedly claim to establish strong causal relationships.
At the same time, some strongly biased trials are still
used to inform practitioners and policymakers and can
thus do harm for treated patients.
To be clear, the intention is not to isolate or criticise
any particular RCTs. It is to stress that we should not
trivialise
and
oversimplify
the
ability
of
the
RCT
method
to
provide
robust
conclusions
about
a
treatment’s average effect. Arriving at such conclusions
is
only
possible
if
researchers
go
through
each
assumption and bias, one after the other (as outlined
in this study), and make systematic efforts to try and
meet these assumptions and reduce these biases as
far as possible – while reporting those they are not
able to.
Methods
This study selected trials using the single criterion of
being one of the 10 most cited RCT studies. These 10
trials with the highest number of citations worldwide
in any journal – up to June 2016 – were identified by
searching
Scopus
(the
largest
database
of
peer-
reviewed journals) for the terms “randomised con-
trolled trial”, “randomized controlled trial” and “RCT”.
These trials (each with 6500þ citations) were screened
and each fulfilled the eligibility requirements of being
randomised and controlled. For further information on
the trial selection strategy and on the 10 most cited
trials, see Appendix Figure A1 and Table 1.
This study, while applying and expanding common
evaluation criteria for trials (such as randomisation,
double-blinding, dropouts and withdrawals [20,21,26]),
assesses RCTs using a broader range of assumptions,
biases and limitations that emerge when carrying out
trials. Terms I create for these assumptions, biases and
limitations are placed in italics. In terms of the study’s
structure, the assumptions, biases and limitations are
discussed together and in the order in which they
arise in the design, then implementation, followed by
analysis of RCTs.
Results and discussion
Assumptions, biases and limitations in
designing RCTs
To begin, a constraint of RCTs not yet thoroughly dis-
cussed in existing studies is that randomisation is only
possible for a small set of questions we are interested
in – i.e. the simple-treatment-at-the-individual-level limi-
tation of trials. Randomisation is largely infeasible for
many complex scientific questions, e.g. on what drives
overall good physical or mental health, high life
expectancy, functioning public health institutions or, in
general, what shapes any other intricate or large-scale
phenomenon
(from
depression
to
social
anxiety).

 Topics are generally not amenable to randomisation
that are related to genetics, immunology, behaviour,
mental states, human capacities, norms and practices.
Not having a comparable counterfactual for such
topics is often the reason for not being able to ran-
domise. The method is constrained in studying treat-
ments for rare diseases, one-off interventions (such as
health system reforms) and interventions with lagged
effects (such as treatments for long-term diseases).
Trials are restricted in answering questions about how
to achieve the desired outcomes within another con-
text and policy setting: about what type of health
practitioners are needed in which kind of clinics within
what regulatory, administrative and institutional envir-
onment to deliver health services effective in provid-
ing the treatment. This method cannot, for such
reasons, bring wholescale improvements in our gen-
eral understanding of medicine. In cases where well-
conducted RCTs are however most useful is in evaluat-
ing, for an anonymised sample, the average efficacy of
a single, simple treatment assumed to have few
known confounders – as published RCTs suggest. But
they cannot always be easily conducted in many cases
with multiple and complex treatments or outcomes
simultaneously that often reflect the reality of medical
situations – e.g. in cases for understanding how to
increase life expectancy or make public health institu-
tions more effective. Researchers would, if they viewed
RCTs as the only reliable research design, thus largely
only focus on select questions related to simple treat-
ments at the level of the individual that fit the quanti-
fiable treatment–outcome schema (more to come on
this later). They would let a particular method influ-
ence what type and range of questions we study and
would neglect other important issues (e.g. increased
life expectancy or improved public health institutions)
that are studied using other methods (e.g. longitudinal
observational studies or institutional analyses).
Another constraint facing RCTs is that a trial’s initial
sample, when the aim is to later scale up a treatment,
would ideally need to be generated randomly and
chosen representatively from the general population –
but the 10 most cited RCTs at times use, when
reported, a selective sample that can limit scaling up
results and can lead to an initial sample selection bias.
Some of these leading trials, as Table 1 indicates, do
not provide information about how their initial sample
was selected before randomisation [8,10] while others
only state that “patient records” were used [13] or that
they “recruited at 29 centers” [15]; but critical informa-
tion is not provided such as the quality, diversity or
location of such centres and the participating practi-
tioners, how the centres were selected, the types of
individuals they tend to treat and so forth. This means
that we do not have details about the representative-
ness of the data used for these RCTs. Moreover, the
trial on cholesterol by Shepherd et al. [14] was for
example conducted in one district in the UK and the
trial on insulin therapy by Van Den Berghe et al. [9] in
one intensive care unit in Belgium – while both none-
theless aimed to later scale up the treatment broadly.
A foundational and strong assumption of RCTs
(once the sample is chosen) is the achieving-good-
randomisation assumption. Poor randomisation – and
thus poor distribution of participants’ background traits
that affect outcomes between trial groups [27] – puts
into question the degree of robustness of the results
from several of these 10 leading RCTs. The trial on
strokes [8], which reports that mortality at 3 months
after the onset of stroke was 17% in the treatment
group and 21% in the placebo group, attributes this
difference to the treatment. However, baseline data
indicates that other factors that strongly affect the out-
comes of stroke and mortality were not equally allo-
cated: those receiving the main treatment (compared
to those with the placebo) were 3% less likely to have
had congestive heart failure, 8% less likely to have
been smoking before the stroke, 14% more likely to
have taken aspirin therapy, 3% more likely to be of
white ethnicity relative to black, and 3% more likely to
have had and survived a previous stroke. These factors
can be driving the trial’s main outcomes – in part or
entirely. But the study does not explicitly discuss this
very poor baseline allocation. In the breast cancer trial
[10], 73% of treated participants (receiving chemother-
apy plus the study treatment) had adjuvant chemother-
apy before the trial compared to 63% of controlled
participants (receiving chemotherapy alone). Because
response to chemotherapy differs for those already
exposed to it relative to those receiving it for the first
time, it is difficult to claim that the study treatment
was solely shaping the results. Likewise, the estimated
main outcome of the colorectal cancer trial [12] –
namely that those with treatment survived 4.5 months
longer – cannot be viewed as a definitive result given
that 4% more of those in the control group already
had adjuvant chemotherapy. It is also unlikely that
results in the diabetes trial by DCC [15] were not
biased by the main intervention group having 5% less
males, 2% more smokers and being 3% more likely to
suffer from nerve damage. Some researchers may
respond saying that “those may just be study design
issues”. But the point is that all of these 10 RCTs rando-
mised their sample, showing that randomisation by
itself does not ensure a balanced distribution – as we
always have finite samples with finite randomisations.

A. KRAUSS
 As long as there are important imbalances we cannot
interpret the different outcomes between the treat-
ment and control groups as simply reflecting the
treatment’s effectiveness. Researchers thus need to bet-
ter reduce the degree of known imbalances – and thus
biased results – by better using, for example, larger
samples and stratified randomisation.
Another constraint that can arise in trials is when
they do not collect baseline data for all relevant back-
ground influencers (but only some) that are known to
alternatively influence outcomes – i.e. an incomplete
baseline data limitation. These individual world-leading
RCTs report for instance that heart disease reduced by
taking the cholesterol-reducing drug called simvastatin
[13] or the drug called pravastatin [14], that intensive
diabetes therapy reduced complications of insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus [15], and that the dur-
ation that patients survive with colorectal cancer
increased by taking the treatment called bevacizumab
[12]. But these same trials do not collect baseline data
– and thus assess – for differences between patients in
levels of physical fitness, of exercise, of stress and
other alternative factors that can also affect the pri-
mary outcome and bias results. The common claim,
that “an advantage of RCTs is that nobody needs to
know all the factors affecting the outcome as random-
ising should ensure it is due to the treatment”, does
not hold and we cannot evade an even balance of
influencing factors.
To better ensure a balanced distribution of back-
ground influencers between trial groups, and to do so
over the same period of time and reduce other pos-
sible confounders, we commonly randomise – in fields
like economics and psychology – the entire sample at
the same time before conducting a trial. This approach
could also be conducted for relevant trials in medicine,
including for example for six of the ten most cited tri-
als that tested treatments for common health condi-
tions
like
diabetes
and
high
cholesterol,
lifestyle
choices like increased exercise, and hormone use in
postmenopausal women, as many potential partici-
pants exist at any time and one would not necessarily
have to wait for participants to enrol. When we then
observe, after randomising the sample for relevant tri-
als, differences in the measurable influencing factors
among the trial groups and if we for example re-ran-
domise the same sample multiple times (before run-
ning the trial) until these factors are more evenly
distributed, then we realise that trial outcomes are
nonetheless the result of having only randomised
once. We realise that trial outcomes would not be
identical after each (re-)randomisation of the sample.
Moreover, for a trial to reduce selection bias and be
completely blinded it is important (beyond randomisa-
tion) that nobody – not just experimenters or patients
but also data collectors, physicians, evaluators or any-
body else – would know the group allocations. These
10 RCTs do not however provide explicit details on
the blinding status of all these key trial persons
throughout the trial.
Table 1 shows that some of these 10 trials did not
double-blind [9,10,12] while others initially double-
blinded but later partially unblinded [11,15,17] or only
partially blinded for one arm of the trial [16] – which
reflects in relevant cases (while often unavoidable) a
lack-of-blinding bias. In the trial by Van Den Berghe
et al. [9], for example, modifying insulin doses requires
monitoring
participants’
glucose
levels,
making
it
impossible to run a blinded study. The estrogen trial
[11] unblinded 40% of participants to allow for man-
agement of adverse effects. The diabetes trial by
Knowler et al. [17] unblinded participants (though the
share was not indicated) when their clinical results sur-
passed set thresholds and treatment needed to be
changed. Some placebo patients in the trial by SSSSG
[13] stopped the study drug to obtain actual choles-
terol-lowering treatment which shows that treatment
allocation was at times unblinded by participants
themselves checking cholesterol levels outside the
trial. Such issues related to blinding, although often
unpreventable, need to be more explicitly discussed in
studies and particularly the extent to which they
bias results.
Beyond randomisation and blinding, a further con-
straint is that trials often consist of a few hundred
individuals that are often too restrictive to produce
robust results – which frequently leads to a small sam-
ple bias. Among the top 10 RCTs, the two separate
parts of the breast cancer trial [10] have sample sizes
of 281 and 188 participants; and the two parts of the
stroke trial [8] have sample sizes of 291 and 333 par-
ticipants. Such small trials, together with at times strict
inclusion and exclusion criteria and poor randomisa-
tion, often bring about important imbalances in back-
ground influencers and bias results (as shown earlier
for these two studies) [21]. Small trials, when the effect
size is also small, can face other issues related to less
precise estimates. An example is that the stroke trial
[8] with 624 participants in total reports that at
3 months after the stroke, 54 treated patients died
compared to 64 placebo patients – with the main out-
come thus being just a difference of 10 deaths.
Overall, to increase reliability in estimated results
researchers ideally need large samples (if possible,
thousands of observations across a broad range of
ANNALS OF MEDICINE
315
 different groups with different background traits) that
estimate large effects across different studies. This
would furthermore ideally be combined with more
studies comparing different treatments against each
other within a single trial – and testing (in relevant
cases) multiple combined treatments in unison [e.g.
comparing (i) increased exercise, (ii) improved nutri-
tion, (iii) no smoking, (iv) a particular medication etc.
in one trial with different treatments to assess relative
benefits: (i), (i þ ii), (i þ ii þ iii) and (i þ ii þ iii þ iv)].
Another issue facing RCTs not yet discussed in exist-
ing studies is the quantitative variable limitation: that
trials are only possible for those specific phenomena
for which we can create strictly defined outcome varia-
bles that fit within our experimental model and
make correlational or causal claims possible. The 10
most cited RCTs thus all use a rigid quantitative out-
come variable. Some use the binary treatment variable
(1 or 0) of whether participants died or not [9,12,13].
But this binary variable can neglect the multiple ways
in which participants perceive the quality of their life
while receiving treatment. In the colorectal cancer trial
[12], for example, the primary outcome is an average
longer survival of 4.5 months for those treated; but
they were also 11% more likely to suffer grade 3 or 4
adverse events, 5% more likely to be hospitalised for
such adverse events and 14% more likely to experi-
ence hypertension. These variables for adverse effects
are nonetheless proxies and do not perfectly capture
patients’ quality of life or level of pain which are, by
their very character, not directly amendable to quanti-
tative analysis. Only using the variables captured in
the trial, we do not have important information about
whether participants who lived several months longer
– but also suffered more intensely and longer – may
have later preferred no treatment. Another example of
the quantitative variable limitation is that the diabetes
trial by Knowler et al. [17] sets the treatment as the
goal of at least 150 min of physical activity per week.
This treatment with a homogenous threshold nonethe-
less neglects factors that influence the effects of
150 min of exercise and thus the estimated outcomes
– factors such as inevitable variation in participants’
level of physical fitness before entering the trial and in
their physiological needs for different levels of physical
activity that depend on their specific age, gender,
weight etc. This clear-cut quantitative variable (while
often the character of the RCT method) thus does not
reflect the heterogeneous needs of patients and deci-
sions of practitioners. In fact, most medical phenom-
ena (from depression, cancer and overall health, to
medical norms and hospital capacity) are not naturally
binary or amendable to randomisation and statistical
analysis (and this issue also affects other statistical
methods and its implications need to be discussed
in studies).
Assumptions, biases and limitations in
implementing RCTs
An assumption in implementing trials that has not yet
been thoroughly discussed in existing studies is the
all-preconditions-are-fully-met assumption: that a trial
treatment can only work if a broad set of influencing
factors (beyond the treatment) that can be difficult to
measure and control would be simultaneously present.
A treatment – whether chemotherapy or a cholesterol
drug – can only work if patients are nourished and
healthy enough for the treatment to be effective, if
compliance is high enough in taking the proper

 dosage, if community clinics administering the treat-
ment are not of low quality, if practitioners are trained
and experienced in delivering it effectively, if institu-
tional capacity of the health services to monitor and
evaluate its implementation is sufficient, among many
other issues. The underlying assumption is that all
these and other such preconditions – causes – would
be fully met for all participants. Ensuring that they are
all present and balanced between trial groups, even if
the sample is large, can be difficult as such factors are
at times known but non-observable or are unknown.
Variation in the extent to which such preconditions
are met leads to variation (bias) in average treatment
effects across different groups of people. To increase
the effectiveness of treatments and the usefulness of
results, researchers need to give greater focus, when
designing trials and when extrapolating from them, to
this broader context.
In these 10 leading RCTs, some degree of statistical
bias
arises
during
implementation
through
issues
related to people initially recruited who refused to
participate,
participants
switching
between
trial
groups, variations in actual dosage taken, missing
data for participants and the like. Table 1 illustrates
that for the few trials in which the share of people
unwilling to participate after being recruited was
reported it accounted at times for a large share of
the eligible sample. Among all women screened for
the estrogen trial [11], only 5% provided consent for
the trial (and reported no hysterectomy). This implies
a selection bias among those who have time, are will-
ing, find it useful, view limited risk in participating
and possibly have greater demand for treatment.
Among this small share, 88% were then randomised
into the trial. During implementation, 42% in the
treatment group stopped taking the drug. Among all
participants 4% had unknown vital status (missing
data) and 3% died. As a sample gets smaller due to
people
refusing,
people
with
missing
data
etc.
“average participants” are likely not being lost but
those who may differ strongly – which are issues that
intention-to-treat analysis cannot necessarily address.
A constraint in interpreting the estrogen trial’s results
is that 11% of placebo participants crossed over to
the
treatment
arm.
Decisions
to
switch
between
groups, once patients become familiar with the trial,
need to also be understood in terms of their immedi-
ate health and lives – not just in terms of the statis-
tical bias it brings to results.
One of the two cholesterol trials [14] reported that
51% recruited to participate appeared for the first
screening, after which only 4% of the recruited sample
was randomised into the study – and later about 30%
of participants dropped out. In the other cholesterol
trial [13], 8% of those eligible did not consent to par-
ticipate, while 12% later stopped the drug due to
adverse effects but also reluctance to continue. Non-
compliance also arises in several of these RCTs. In one
of the diabetes trials [17], the share of participants tak-
ing at least 80% of the prescribed dosage was 72% for
those in the treatment group. In the colorectal cancer
trial [12], 73% in the treatment group took the
intended dose of one of the drugs. That significant
shares of participants in these and other trials have
different levels of treatment compliance (see Table 1)
can lead to variation (bias) in estimating outcomes
across participants (whether using intention-to-treat or
per-protocol analysis). Also, several of these trials did
not provide complete data on dropout rates (Table 1).
Among them is the stroke trial [8] and for all partici-
pants with missing outcome data “the worst possible
score was assigned”. This assumption is not likely cor-
rect. Overall, what decisions researchers take to deal
with participant refusal, switching between groups,
missing data etc. raises difficult methodological issues
and a further degree of bias in results that researchers
need to openly discuss in trial studies.
Assumptions, biases and limitations in
analysing RCTs
In evaluating results after trial implementation, RCTs
face a unique time period assessment bias that has not
yet been thoroughly discussed in existing studies:
that a correlational or causal claim about the out-
come
is
for
many
trials
a
function
of
when
a
researcher chooses to collect baseline and endline
data points and thus assesses one average outcome
instead
of
another.
The
trial
by
SSSSG
[13]
for
example reports that the effect of the cholesterol-low-
ering drug seemed to begin, on average, after about
a year and then subsequently reduced. Treatments
generally have different levels of decreasing (or at
times
increasing)
returns.
Variation
in
estimated
results
is thus
generally inevitable depending on
when we decide to evaluate a treatment – every
month, quarter, year or several years. No two (or
more) assessment points are identical and we need
to thus, for most trials, always evaluate at multiple
time points to improve our understanding of the
evaluation trajectory and of lags over time (while this
issue also affects other statistical methods).
In half of these 10 RCTs, the total length of follow-
up was, given trial design, not always identical but at
times two or three times longer for some participants
– though just the average results were reported
ANNALS OF MEDICINE
317
 [11,13,15–17]. Different time lengths and different
amounts of doses taken, however, bring about differ-
ent effects between trial participants and lead to
measurement bias. In the trial on breast cancer and
chemotherapy [10] for example, participants in the pri-
mary treatment group remained in the study between
1 and 127 weeks (on average 40 weeks) and the doses
taken
ranged
between
1
and
98
(on
average
36 doses).
Another strong assumption made in evaluating RCTs
that has not yet been discussed is the background-
traits-remain-constant assumption – but these change
during the trial so we need to assess them not only at
baseline but also at endline as they can alternatively
influence outcomes and bias results. The longer the
trial is the more important these influences often
become. But they are also important for shorter trials: if
those in the control group are given the common treat-
ment or nothing at all and for example 3% of those in
the treatment group decide to combine the tested
drug treatment with other forms of treatment such as
additional exercise or better nutrition to improve their
conditions more rapidly but we only collect baseline
and not endline data on levels of exercise and nutrition,
then we do not know if the tested drug treatment
alone is driving the outcomes. Unless we can ensure
that participants at the endline have the identical back-
ground conditions and clinic traits that they had at the
baseline, we cannot claim that “the outcome is just
because of the treatment”. This issue applies to all 10
RCTs as they do not include such endline data.
Another constraint is that trials are commonly
designed to only evaluate average effects – i.e. the
average treatment effects limitation. Though, average
effects can at times be positive even when some or
the majority are not influenced or even negatively
influenced by the treatment but a minority still experi-
ence large effects.
Most of these top 10 RCTs, which have the object-
ive to use the treatment in a broader population, do
not fully assess how the results may apply to people
outside the trial [28] (Table 1) – i.e. the extrapolation
limitation. A few however do partially report this infor-
mation. The trial by Shepherd et al. [14] for example
states that their results could be “applicable to typical
middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia”. But it
does not indicate if the results would only apply to
typical men in the particular sub-population within the
West of Scotland (where the trial was run) given the
specific lifestyle, nutrition and other traits of people in
this region and the capacity of participating clinics. For
the trial by Van Den Berghe et al. [9], participants
were selected for insulin therapy in one surgical
intensive care unit. This implies that results cannot be
applied to those in medical intensive care units or
those with illnesses not present in the sample (which
the authors acknowledge) but also to those with dif-
ferent demographic or clinical traits. The diabetes trial
by Knowler et al. [17] provides most detail on the
study’s applicability compared to other top 10 trials,
conceding that: “The validity of generalizing the results
of
previous
prevention
studies
is
uncertain.
Interventions that work in some societies may not
work in others, because social, economic, and cultural
forces influence [for example] diet and exercise”. The
authors of this trial state that the results could apply
to about 3% of the US population. In general, when
researchers however do not explicitly discuss the
potential scope of their results outside the trial con-
text, practitioners do not exactly know whom they
may apply to.
A best results bias can also exist in reporting treat-
ment effects, with funders and journals at times less
likely to accept negligible or negative results. Of these
10 trials, researchers at times indicate possible alterna-
tive explanations (beyond the treatment) for adverse
treatment effects (e.g. in the colorectal cancer trial
[12]). But these 10 trials do not explicitly discuss other
measurable or non-measurable confounders, like the
imbalanced background traits outlined above, that
also shape the main (treatment) outcome (Table 1).
Only one of these trials (the estrogen trial [11]) had a
negative main treatment effect. The trial by Van Den
Berghe et al. [9] did not discuss the adverse effects of
the insulin therapy, but only reported an extensive list
of its benefits.
Another constraint in evaluating trials is that fun-
ders can have some inherent interest in the pub-
lished outcomes that can lead to a funder bias. This
has been shown by a number of systematic reviews
of trials [29,30]. Among the ten most cited RCTs,
seven were financed by biopharmaceutical compa-
nies. The colorectal cancer trial [12] was funded and
designed by the biotech company Genentech and it
collected and analysed the data, while the research-
ers also received payments from the company for
consulting, lectures and research. This was also the
case for the breast cancer trial [10]. However, drug
suppliers should not ideally, because of commercial
interests, be independently involved in trial design,
implementation and analysis – with one potential
source of bias emerging through the selection of an
inappropriate
comparator
to
the
tested
treat-
ment [29,30].
An associated constraint that arises in interpreting a
trial’s treatment effects is related to a placebo-only or
318
A. KRAUSS
 conventional-treatment-only limitation. Four of the 10
trials compare the treatment under study only with a
placebo [8,11,13,14] which can, in relevant cases, make
it more difficult to inform policy as we do not know
how the tested treatment directly compares with the
current or conventional treatment. Five of the 10 trials
compare the treatment only with conventional treat-
ments [9,10,12,15,16] (and not additionally with a pla-
cebo) though a treatment’s reported benefit can at times
be attributed to the poor outcome in the conventional
group. Only one of these trials [17] was designed for
assessing the relative benefit of the tested and conven-
tional treatments comparatively against a placebo.
A number of other biases and constraints can also
arise in conducting RCTs. These range from calculating
standard
errors
(with
the
number
of
participants
between trial groups being uneven in all 10 trials, as
Table 1 illustrates), placebo effects [31], variations in
the way sample sizes are determined, in the way dif-
ferent enumerators collect data for the same trial, and
in the methods used to create the random allocation
sequence, to differences in analysing, interpreting and
reporting statistical data and results, changes in the
design or methods after trials begin such as exclusion
criteria, conducting subgroup analysis (and related ex
post data-mining) [32], ethical constraints [33], budget-
ary limitations, and much more.
Combining the set of assumptions, biases and
limitations facing RCTs
Pulling the range of assumptions and biases together
that arise in designing, implementing and analysing
trials (Figure 1), we can try to assess how reliable an
RCT’s outcomes are. This depends on the degree to
which we may be able to meet each assumption and
reduce each bias – which is also how researchers can
improve trials.
Yet is it feasible to always meet this set of assump-
tions and minimise this set of biases? The answer does
not seem positive when assessing these leading RCTs.
The extent of assumptions and biases underlying a tri-
al’s results can increase at each stage: from how we
choose our research question and objective, create our
variables, select our sample, randomise, blind and con-
trol, to how we carry out treatments and monitor par-
ticipants, collect our data and conduct our data
analysis, interpret our results and do everything else
before, in between and after these steps. Ultimately
our results can be no more precise than such assump-
tions we make and biases we have. It is, in general
terms, not possible to talk about which of them are
more important. That can only be assessed in a given
trial and depends on the extent to which each
assumption is satisfied and each bias reduced.

Sample population 
• Trial would ideally have only a limited share of participants who  
have missing data or switch between treatment and control 
groups, but also who do not comply or take full intended 
treatment, stop taking it, or drop out 
• Set of preconditions would be satisfied for the treatment to work 
in the trial and/or another context – such as patients being 
nourished and healthy enough for treatment to be effective (the 
all-preconditions-are-fully-met assumption) 
• Achieving-good-randomisation assumption: 
Trial statistician would (for relevant trials) select 
most balanced distribution among multiple 
randomisation schedules; Participants would 
thereby be randomised and equally distributed 
into trial groups along (measurable, known-but-
non-measurable and unknown) background 
influencers; The sample would also (if 
appropriate) be well stratified when randomising 
• There would then be no – or only a small – 
imbalance in the number of participants in each 
trial group 
• Trial would collect baseline data for all relevant 
and known background influencers, not just 
some (no incomplete baseline data limitation) 
• Trial would provide data showing that everyone 
involved in the trial – experimenters, patients, 
data collectors, physicians, evaluators etc. – 
would then be blinded before group assignment 
and during the entire trial to reduce selection 
bias (no lack-of-blinding bias) 
• A unique time period assessment bias: The particular time 
points at which baseline and endline are selected may reflect 
the average (or greatest possible) treatment outcome (i.e. 
same claim to average outcome, but a function of when 
assessment (a to e) is conducted); Trials would thus evaluate 
at multiple time points to better understanding evaluation 
trajectory 
• Background-traits-remain-constant assumption: Background 
traits that can influence outcomes would not have changed 
between groups during trial implementation; To this end, 
trials would assess background influencers not just at baseline 
but also at endline 
• Initial sample selection 
assumption: Sample would 
be generated randomly and 
chosen representatively (to 
reflect well the distribution 
of background traits of  the 
general population) for trials 
aiming to scale up treatment 
• Appropriate eligibility and 
exclusion criteria would be 
selected  
• Those who refuse to 
participate would not differ 
strongly from those who 
consent 
• Sample would have 
sufficient number of 
observations for statistically 
reliable results (no small 
sample bias) 
• The degree of ‘external validity’ of results would 
be fully assessed and discussed (the extrapolation 
limitation) 
• Average results of sample would (for trials aiming 
to expand the treatment) be applicable for the 
broader population and the decisions of individual 
practitioners and policymakers (the average 
treatment effects limitation)  
              Design                                                                  Implementation                                                         Analysis 
• Alternative (background) factors influencing reported 
outcomes, and adverse effects would be fully assessed and 
discussed (no best results bias) 
• Trial would (in relevant cases) evaluate tested treatment 
against placebo and conventional treatment to assess relative 
benefits and more easily interpret results (no placebo-only or 
conventional-treatment-only limitation)  
• Sample would not suffer from large heterogeneity and outliers 
• Data would be properly collected, statistical methods 
adequately applied, results analysed and interpreted well, 
standard errors correctly calculated (despite generally 
different variance within each trial group) 
• Funding agencies would not adversely influence research 
design, implementation or reported outcomes (no funder bias) 
• The trial would not raise serious ethical concerns 
• among others 
• Trials would be able to make large-scale improvements in our understanding 
of overall health – though they are only feasible for a small set of topics (the 
simple-treatment-at-the-individual-level limitation of trials) 
• The particular dynamic phenomena or treatments can be captured well in 
quantifiable variables – used for the outcome, baseline and stratification (the 
quantitative variable limitation)

 We need to furthermore use RCTs together with
other methods that also have benefits. When a trial
suggests that a new treatment can be effective for
some participants in the sample, subsequent observa-
tional studies for example can often be important to
provide insight into: a treatment’s broader range of
side effects, the distribution of effects on those of dif-
ferent age, location and other traits and, among
others, whether people in everyday practice with
everyday service providers in everyday facilities would
be able to attain comparable outcomes as the average
trial participant. Single case studies and methods in
and outside of the laboratory are furthermore essential
first steps that ground later experimentation and make
later evaluation using RCTs possible. Moreover, to
attain some of the medical community’s most signifi-
cant insights, historical and observational methods
were used and RCTs were not later needed (and at
times not possible), ranging from most surgical proce-
dures, antibiotics and aspirin, to smallpox immunisa-
tion, anaesthesia, immobilising broken bones, smoking
inducing cancer, among many other examples [23].
Conclusions
Randomised experiments require much more than just
randomising an experiment to identify a treatment’s
effectiveness. They involve many decisions and com-
plex steps that bring their own assumptions and
degree of bias before, during and after randomisation.
Seen through this lens, the reproducibility crisis can
also be explained by the scientific process being a
complex human process involving many actors (trial
designers,
all
participants,
data
collectors,
practi-
tioners/physicians, trial statisticians etc.) making many
decisions at many steps when designing, implementing
and analysing studies, with some degree of bias inevit-
ably arising during this process. That trials face some
degree of bias is simply the trade-off for studies to actu-
ally be conducted in the real world. And addressing one
bias can at times mean introducing another bias (e.g.
making a sample more heterogeneous can help improve
how useful results are after the trial but can also reduce
reliability in the trial’s estimated results).
We then have to always make a judgement: are
biased results in studies good enough to inform our
decisions? Often they are – but that judgement gener-
ally depends on how useful the results are in practice
and their level of robustness compared with other
studies using the same method or, at times, other
methods. Yet no single study should be the sole and
authoritative source used to inform policy and our
decisions. In general however, the impact of RCTs
would be greater if researchers would systematically
go through and aim to reduce each bias and satisfy
each assumption as far as possible – as outlined in
Figure 1. More broadly, what are the lessons for
researchers to improve RCTs?
Journals
must
begin
requiring
that
researchers
include a standalone section with additional tables in
their studies on the “Research assumptions, biases and
limitations” they faced in carrying out the trial. Each trial
should thereby have to include a separate table with
the information listed in the CONSORT guidelines that
have to be significantly expanded to also require not
yet reported information on the share, traits as well as
reasons of participants refusing to participate before
randomisation, not taking full dosages, having missing
data etc., on the blinding status of all key trial persons,
on alternative (background) factors that can affect the
main outcome and on the wider range of issues dis-
cussed throughout this study (Figure 1). It needs to also
include a table with endline data (not just baseline
data) of participants’ background traits and clinic char-
acteristics – and also more detailed information on the
“applicability of results” including the broader range of
background influencers of participants, step-by-step
information on how the initial sample is exactly gener-
ated (not just eligibility criteria and clinic location) and
whom the trial results may explicitly apply to. These 10
RCTs do not discuss all such essential information and
the
particular
assumptions,
biases
and
limitations
(Table 1) – nor do they include all the information
already in the CONSORT guidelines while most of these
trials were published after the standardised inter-
national guidelines were agreed upon [1]. This study
here thus highlights, on one hand, wider issues such as
not fully understanding study reporting guidelines or
not fully complying with the guidelines for minimally
robust trials. It also raises the important question of
why a number of high-profile studies that do not match
up to minimal quality standards and have biased results
continue to be highly cited. On the other hand, it illus-
trates that the CONSORT guidelines must be greatly
extended to reflect this larger set of assumptions,
biases and limitations. If journals begin requiring these
additional tables and information (e.g. as an online
supplementary appendix due to word limits), research-
ers would learn to better detect and reduce problems
facing trials in design, implementation and evaluation –
and thus help improve RCTs. Without this essential
information in studies, readers are not able to assess
well a trial’s validity and conclusions. Some researchers
may respond saying that they may already be familiar
with a number of the biases outlined here. That how-
ever does not always seem to be the case as otherwise
320
A. KRAUSS
 these influential RCTs would not all suffer, to such an
extent, from some of these biases.
Researchers need to furthermore better combine
methods as each can provide insight into different
aspects of a treatment. These range from RCTs, obser-
vational studies and historically controlled trials, to
rich single cases and consensus of experts. Some
researchers may respond, “are RCTs not still more
credible than these other methods even if they may
have biases?” For most questions we are interested in,
RCTs cannot be more credible because they cannot be
applied (as outlined above). Other methods (such as
observational studies) are needed for many questions
not amendable to randomisation but also at times to
help design trials, interpret and validate their results,
provide further insight on the broader conditions
under which treatments may work, among other rea-
sons discussed earlier. Different methods are thus
complements (not rivals) in improving understanding.
Finally, randomisation does not always even out
everything well at the baseline and it cannot control
for endline imbalances in background influencers.
Researchers need to however make efforts to ensure a
balanced distribution of important background influ-
encers between trial groups, and then also control for
changes in those background influencers during the
trial by collecting endline data. Though if researchers
hold onto the belief that flipping a coin brings us
closer to scientific rigour and understanding than for
example systematically ensuring participants are dis-
tributed well at baseline and endline, then scientific
understanding will be undermined in the name of
computer-based randomisation.
