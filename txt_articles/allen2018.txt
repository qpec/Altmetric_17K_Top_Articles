IMPORTANCE Shared decision making helps patients and clinicians elect therapies aligned
with patients’ values and preferences. This is particularly important for invasive therapies
with considerable trade-offs.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of a shared decision support intervention for patients
considering destination therapy left ventricular assist device (DT LVAD) placement.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From 2015 to 2017, a randomized, stepped-wedge trial
was conducted in 6 US LVAD implanting centers including 248 patients being considered for
DT LVAD. After randomly varying time in usual care, sites were transitioned to an intervention
consisting of clinician education and use of DT LVAD pamphlet and video patient decision
aids. Follow up occurred at 1 and 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Decision quality as measured by knowledge and
values-choice concordance.
RESULTS In total, 135 patients were enrolled during control and 113 during intervention
periods. At enrollment, 59 (23.8%) participants were in intensive care, 60 (24.1%) were older
than 70 years, 39 (15.7%) were women, 45 (18.1%) were racial/ethnic minorities, and 62
(25.0%) were college graduates. Patient knowledge (mean test performance) during the
decision-making period improved from 59.5% to 64.9% in the control group vs 59.1% to
70.0% in the intervention group (adjusted difference of difference, 5.5%; P = .03). Stated
values at 1 month (scale 1 = “
do everything I can to live longer…”to 10 = “live with whatever
time I have left…”) were a mean of 2.37 in control and 3.33 in intervention (P = .03).
Patient-reported treatment choice at 1 month favored LVAD more in the control group (than
in the intervention group (47 [59.5%] vs 95 [91.3%], P < .001). Correlation between stated
values and patient-reported treatment choice at 1 month was stronger in the intervention
group than in the control group (difference in Kendall’s τ, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.05-0.45); however,
there was no improved correlation between stated values and actual treatment received
by 6 months for the intervention compared with the control group (difference in Kendall’s τ,
0.01; 95% CI, −0.24 to 0.25). The adjusted rate of LVAD implantation by 6 months was
higher for those in the control group (79.9%) than those in the intervention group (53.9%,
P = .008), with significant variation by site. There were no differences in decision conflict,
decision regret, or preferred control.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A shared decision-making intervention for DT LVAD modestly
improved patient decision quality as measured by patient knowledge and concordance
between stated values and patient-reported treatment choice, but did not improve
concordance between stated values and actual treatment received. The rate of implantation
of LVADs was substantially lower in the intervention compared with the control group.

 S
hared decision making is a process that helps patients
and clinicians align therapies with patients’values and
preferences.1 This is particularly important for inva-
sive therapies for life-threatening illness,2,3 such as left
ventricular assist devices as destination therapy (DT LVADs).
These devices are offered to patients with severe heart fail-
ure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Placement
of a DT LVAD can be life-prolonging, but also comes with con-
siderable changes in lifestyle, need for caregiver support, and
a high likelihood of complications.4,5 Unfortunately, for many
major decisions involving newer medical technologies—
including DT LVAD—education, consent, and shared decision-
making processes are suboptimal.6,7 Current consent docu-
mentsaretoolongandpoorlywritten,8industrymaterialstend
to be biased,9,10 and clinicians often lack the skills to support
high-quality decision making.11
Patient decision aids are a form of decision support that
standardize the information received by patients to support a
shared decision-making process.12 Decision aids have been
shown to improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflict.13
However, few tools have been developed to engage seriously
illpatientsinshareddecisionmaking,14anduntilrecently,none
were available for LVAD.9 In addition, the effectiveness of
decision aids in clinical practice is largely unknown and wide-
scale implementation remains a substantial challenge.15,16
In this context, we performed a series of studies explor-
ing the decisional needs for patients and their caregivers con-
sidering DT LVAD.10,17,18 Based on this research and following
the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS), we
developed pamphlet and video decision aids for patients and
their caregivers considering DT LVAD.19 We aimed to study the
effectiveness of these decision aids coupled with a clinician-
directed support training through a multicenter, cluster-
randomized, stepped-wedge design.
Methods
Design and Sites
The Multicenter Trial of a Shared Decision Support Interven-
tion for Patients and their Caregivers Offered Destination
Therapy for End-Stage Heart Failure (DECIDE-LVAD) used a
hospital-level, randomized phased roll out (stepped wedge) in
6 mechanical circulatory support (MCS) programs across the
United States.20,21 This approach was chosen because the in-
tervention engages clinicians and other program staff in ad-
dition to patients.22 The study was overseen by the institu-
tional review board at the University of Colorado and approved
by institutional review boards at all sites. The trial protocol is
available in Supplement 1.
Study Participants
Patient and caregiver dyads were enrolled from the 6 sites dur-
inga20-monthenrollmentperiod.Patienteligibilitycriteriain-
cluded age 18 years or older, end-stage heart failure, and active
consideration for a DT LVAD. Eligible patients were identified
by the study team at each site at the time a DT LVAD evaluation
was initiated. This was triggered either by a preauthorization
request to the patient’
s health insurance for LVAD evaluation
or a provider’
s request for formal education about LVAD. Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all study partici-
pants. Participants were compensated $25 for completing sur-
veys at each time point.
Intervention
The content and development of the decision aids is described
separately19; the pamphlet is available in Supplement 2.
Allsitesbeganinthecontrolperiodusingtheirexistingma-
terials during formal education. This process typically con-
sisted of a patient teaching session with an MCS coordinator
and use of industry pamphlets/videos and program-specific
documents. At 4 stepped time intervals, programs were ran-
domly assigned to cross over to the intervention. The deci-
sion support intervention included (1) delivery of a 2.5-hour
clinician-directed decision support training and (2) use of the
26-minute video and 8-page pamphlet decision aids devel-
oped by our group.19 At the time of intervention implemen-
tation, staff directly involved in LVAD patient education and
care were asked to attend a 60-minute grand rounds style
presentation about shared decision making for DT LVAD,
followed by a 90-minute coaching session that included dem-
onstration and discussion of the decision aid materials.20 With
facilitation by local physician champions, sites were then in-
structed to formally integrate the decision aids and tenets
learned from the coaching session into existing education, de-
cision making, and informed consent processes. The only re-
quirements of sites around the use of the decision aids were
that they be delivered by clinicians and not research staff. This
designallowedforsitestoimplementthedecisionaidsinaway
that was most appropriate for that site; thus, local differ-
ences in how the intervention was delivered were possible.
Data Collection
Data collection was the same during both control and inter-
vention periods. For all patients meeting initial eligibility cri-
teria, basic demographic and health status data were cap-
tured in the screening form. Enrolled participants were
administered surveys (Supplement 2) at 4 time points: prior
to formal LVAD education (baseline 1), immediately after
formal education (baseline 2), 1 month after enrollment, and
Key Points
Question Does a shared decision support intervention for patients
considering destination therapy left ventricular assist device
(DT LVAD) improve decision quality compared with usual care?
Findings In this multicenter randomized stepped-wedgeclinical
trial of 248 patients being considered for DT LVAD, compared with
patients in the usual care control period, patients enrolled in the
intervention period had significantly better knowledge and higher
concordance between stated values and patient-reported
treatment choice.
Meaning An intervention supporting shared decision making for
DT LVAD was associated with improved patient decision quality.

 6 months after enrollment. Baseline surveys were adminis-
tered in person (with verbal assessments completed),23-25
whereas follow-up surveys were administered in person or
through telephone or mail. Medical records were reviewed
at enrollment, 1 month, and 6 months for relevant clinical
information, outcomes, and adverse events. Decision aid use
by individual patients was reported by clinical staff. All data
were entered into a REDCap database by the individual sites.26
Outcomes
Theprimaryoutcomewasdecisionquality:theextenttowhich
medicaldecisionmakingreflectstheconsideredpreferencesof
a well-informed patient.13,27,28 As such, coprimary endpoints
were chosen comprising the 2 main IPDAS domains of deci-
sion quality—knowledge and values-choice concordance.
A10-itemknowledgetestwasdevelopedbythestudyteam
and validated by clinicians and patients. Consistent with the
methods of Sepucha et al,29 the study team created a list of
knowledge items based on clinical needs, local post-LVAD edu-
cation standards, and needs assessment work with patients.
We then surveyed patients, caregivers, MCS coordinators, and
physicians to narrow the list and determine the key knowl-
edgeitemsandassurecontentvalidity.Theacceptabilityofthis
measure was further assessed with patients and caregivers in a
pilot of the trial protocol.20 Improvement in knowledge from
baseline 1 to baseline 2 was a coprimary endpoint.30 A values
scale was also developed, modeled after a well-accepted val-
ues evaluation tool.31 During previous needs assessment
work,10,17,181valueroseaboveallothersinconsideringDTLVAD:
maximizing chances of survival with aggressive medical care
vs not. We developed a single-item, 10-tier Likert values mea-
sure using the dichotomy of “Do everything I can to live lon-
ger, even if that means having major surgery and being depen-
dent on a machine” (score 1) vs “Live with whatever time I have
left, without going through major surgery or being dependent
on a machine” (score 10). Concordance between 1-month value
scoreandpatient-reportedtreatmentchoice(DTLVADormedi-
cal treatment without LVAD) at 1 month was the other copri-
maryendpoint.Concordancebetween1-monthvaluescoreand
actual treatment received by 6 months was also assessed.
Secondary outcomes included validated measures of
decision conflict,32 decision regret,33 control preferences,34
illness acceptance,35 perceived stress,36 depression (Patient
Health Questionnaire-2),37 and quality of life (EuroQol Visual
Analogue Scale).38 Acceptability of the decision aids was also
measured at baseline 2.39
Analysis
Wedeterminedthatasamplesizeof168participantswithstan-
dard deviation of 18% would yield a power of 0.95 to detect
an improvement in knowledge by 10%. We anticipated a drop-
out rate of 25% by 6 months based on expected death rates and
other loss to follow-up.
We compared baseline characteristics between partici-
pants enrolled in the study to those screened but not en-
rolled using χ2 tests. We compared characteristics between
those enrolled during the control period with those enrolled
during the intervention period using χ2 tests and t tests.
To assess the change in patient DT LVAD knowledge over
time, we fit a linear mixed model proposed for the analysis of
steppedwedgedesigns.40Thismodelaccountedfortherepeated
within-person measures, included a random effect for site and
fixedeffectindicatorsofinterventiongroupandsteppedwedge

thatchangesoccursimilarlyacrossallsites.Owingtodifferences

edge score (percent correct) between baseline 1 and baseline 2
was different between the control and intervention groups.
To assess values-choice concordance, we calculated the
Kendall’
s τ correlation coefficient between the stated values
score at 1 month and each of the treatment outcomes (patient-
reportedtreatmentchoiceat1month,actualtreatmentreceived
at 6 months), and looked at the difference in this correlation
coefficient by intervention group. To generate a confidence in-
terval for this difference, we performed 500 bootstrap samples
and calculated the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
In analysis of secondary survey scores described previ-
ously and the LVAD implantation rates by intervention group,
we applied the same mixed model methods described above.
Owing to site differences in LVAD implantation rate and dif-
ferences in location of patient enrollment over time, we per-
formed separate sensitivity analyses accounting for each, as
well as sensitivity analysis without including the site random
effect. Missing data analyses can be viewed in Supplement 2.
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical soft-
ware (version 9.4, SAS Inc).
Results
Patients
BetweenJune2015andJanuary2017,of385patientswhowere
actively considering a DT LVAD, 248 were enrolled (Figure 1).
Compared with patients who were screened but not enrolled
inthestudy,enrolledpatientsweremorelikelytobewhitenon-
Hispanic (75.8% vs 63.9%, P = .03); other demographics and
clinical status were not different between the 2 groups.
Patients in the intervention period were more likely to be
enrolled as outpatient (31% vs 17%, P = .007) and to have been
diagnosed with heart failure less than 4 years prior (29.8% vs
18.2%, P = .03) than those enrolled in the control period. See
Table 1 for other demographic information.
Exposure to and Impression of Decision Support Materials
In the control period, patients most often received site-
specific consent forms, locally made documents, and indus-
try pamphlets/videos during formal education. In the inter-
vention period, 94.7% of patients received the decision aid (99
patients received both pamphlet and video, 2 received pam-
phlet only, 6 received video only, and 6 received neither); 3 of
the 6 sites stopped using industry pamphlets/videos labeled
as decision making materials. Patient-reported acceptability
of the educational materials was not significantly different
between the control and intervention periods.

 DecisionQuality:KnowledgeandValues-ChoiceConcordance
Patient knowledge (mean test performance) during the deci-
sion-making period improved from 59.5% to 64.9% in the con-
trol group vs 59.1% to 70.0% in the intervention group (dif-
ference of difference, 5.5%; P = .03) (Figure 2).
Patient values on the 10-tier Likert scale were generally in
the direction of more aggressive care to maximize survival
(ie, closer to 1): control period baseline 1 score mean of 2.19
(standard error [SE], 0.26); 1-month, 2.37 (SE, 0.28); 6-month,
3.12 (SE, 0.33); intervention period baseline, 2.98 (SE, 0.30);
1-month, 3.33 (SE, 0.32); 6-month, 3.65 (SE, 0.39); adjusted
overall difference P = .06 (Table 2).
At 1 month, patient-reported treatment choice favored
LVAD more in the control group than the intervention group:
“wanted LVAD and decided to get it” 78.8% control, 54.4%
intervention; “first decided not to get the DT LVAD but then
decided he/she wanted it” 12.5% control, 5.1% intervention;
“decided not to get LVAD” 1.0% control, 7.6% intervention
(overall P < .001).

treatment choice (eg, values score closer to 1 combined with
“wantedLVAD”)at1-monthwashigherintheinterventionthan

s τ correlation coefficient: con-
trol 0.17, intervention 0.48 (difference in correlation control to
intervention,0.28;95%CI,0.05-0.45;P = .01)(Figure2).Patient-
reported treatment choices were stable from 1 month to
6 months (Table 2).
By 6 months, 110 (83.3%) (adjusted rate, 79.9%) patients
in the control group and 54 (52.4%) (adjusted rate, 53.9%)
patients in the intervention group had undergone LVAD
implantation (P = .008), with significant differences among
sites (Figure 3). The medical team decided the patient was
not eligible for a DT LVAD in 11 (8.3%) control and 25 (24.3%)
intervention patients (P < .001). Concordance between
stated values at 1 month and actual treatment received by 6
months (in contrast to the 1-month patient-reported treat-
ment choice above) was the same in both the control and
intervention groups (Kendall’

Discussion
The DECIDE-LVAD trial offers unique insights into one of the
most challenging medical decisions created by modern medi-
cine. Rather than test the efficacy of decision support tools
administered by research personnel in a patient-randomized
trial, this study used a pragmatic effectiveness design to
assess how programmatic integration of decision aids and cli-
nician training into standard processes of care may influence
DT LVAD decision making.22 Through its conduct, DECIDE-
LVAD created one of the largest prospective LVAD-eligible
cohorts,4enrollingmostofthepatientsconsideredforDTLVAD
during the study period, from 6 geographically diverse sites,
and nearly a quarter from intensive care. In this context, the
intervention was associated with better decision quality.
Decision support studies most commonly measure knowl-
edge and decision conflict as the primary outcomes.13 How-
ever, central to a high-quality decision is whether the choice
matches the patient’
s values, goals, and preferences. Knowl-
edge alone is insufficient to guarantee high-quality decision
making, particularly for emotionally charged decisions around

to address life-threatening situations—rather than providing
them with false reassurances—may transiently increase feel-
ings of conflict, anxiety, and even regret.42 Thus, it is not sur-
prising to us that DECIDE-LVAD intervention did not reduce
conflict at 1 month; we predicted this a priori.43 In contrast,

 we leveraged the dominant value that emerges when consid-
ering DT LVAD (ie, aggressive care to optimize survival chances
vs not) and found that the intervention was associated with
improved concordance between stated values and patient-
reported treatment choice. This did not translate to im-
proved concordance between stated values and actual treat-
ment received, perhaps because DT LVAD implantation is
influenced by a wide range of factors (eg, medical eligibility,
presence of an adequate caregiver), many of which are not in
the patient’
s control.
The site-based intervention with a randomized stepped
wedgerolloutdistinguishestheDECIDE-LVADstudyfrommost
other assessments of shared decision making. Despite strong
efficacy data, uptake of decision aids in routine practice has
been slow.16 To be successful, decision support tools must in-
tegrate easily into existing care and facilitate necessary dis-
cussions. Leveraging the formal consent and education pro-
cess for LVAD, we were able to implement the DECIDE-LVAD
intervention into this existing structure, while observing the
programmatic transitions in all 6 sites over time. Given the im-
portance of widespread adoption of shared decision making,
pragmatic studies such as this one are needed to address real-
world complexities and implementation challenges. The de-
crease in device implantation rates from control to interven-
tion in 5 of the 6 sites supports the ability to influence
institutional culture and decision-making processes related to
major medical interventions.44
Unlike most prospective studies in MCS that follow pa-
tientsfromthetimeofimplant,theDECIDE-LVADstudymoved
upstream to follow the entire population of patients formally
considered for DT LVAD.45,46 By focusing on a choice rather
than a specific therapy (ie, only those who have received
an LVAD), DECIDE-LVAD expands insights into the patients,
experiences, and processes that lead up to decisions about
device implantation.47 We found that a significant number of
patients facing high morbidity and mortality from heart fail-
ure decline DT LVAD in favor of avoiding aggressive thera-
pies. The declination rates reported here are among patients
who have agreed to undergo formal evaluation; thus, we sus-
pect that DT LVAD declination may be more prevalent in the

 broader community.48 This is concordant with prior work
showing diversity in the relative emphasis patients place on
quality vs quantity of life, even when actively facing life-
threatening illness.17,49 It also reinforces DT LVAD as a rela-
tively preference-sensitive decision.
Limitations
A number of limitations should be recognized. First, missing
data were somewhat frequent and concentrated among the
group of patients who did not undergo implantation of DT
LVAD. Death was the most common cause of missing data, fol-
lowed by withdrawal from the study, both of which are com-
mon in studies targeting patients with life threatening ill-
ness. Our missing data rates are comparable to similar study
types,43,45 and our models adjusted for missing data as much
as possible. Second, time trends in rapidly evolving fields are
particularly problematic for the stepped wedge design.21,40
Fortunately, device technology was relatively stable between
2015 and 2017 and durable LVAD implant rates across the US
plateaued somewhat during this period.48 Third, the phased
implementation randomized the site with the lowest LVAD
implant rate to spend the most time in the intervention and
the site with the highest LVAD implant rate to spend the most
time in the control. Linear mixed models accounting for site
effects and sensitivity analyses were used to explore and di-
minish these differences for the patient-based effectiveness
outcomes, but do not necessarily fully account for such
effects.40 Finally, the population was mostly white males.
Althoughenrolleeswere12%morelikelytobewhitethanthose
excluded, the final study cohort reflects contemporary use of
LVADs in the United States.50,51 This bias makes it difficult to
extrapolate the findings here to decision making for women
and underrepresented races/ethnicities.
Conclusions
A shared decision-making intervention for patients consider-
ing DT LVAD—implemented programmatically, integrating
novel patient decision aids, and including clinician training—
was associated with a significant improvement in knowledge
and an increase in concordance between stated values and pa-
tient-reported treatment choice. Although these changes did
not translate to improvements in concordance between stated
values and actual treatment received, patients were less likely
during intervention than control to proceed to LVAD implant.
These results suggest that institutional culture and processes
can influence medical decisions in life-threatening illness.
