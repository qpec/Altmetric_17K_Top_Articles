RESEARCH
The health, poverty, and financial consequences of a cigarette 
price increase among 500 million male smokers in 13 middle 
income countries: compartmental model study
Global Tobacco Economics Consortium
ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To examine the impact of a 50% increase in market 
prices of cigarettes on health, poverty, and financial 
protection.
DESIGN
Compartmental model study.
SETTING
13 middle income countries, totalling two billion men.
PARTICIPANTS
500 million male smokers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Life years gained, averted treatment costs, number of 
men avoiding catastrophic healthcare expenditures 
and poverty, and additional tax revenue by income 
group.
RESULTS
A 50% increase in cigarette prices would lead to 
about 450 million years of life gained across the 13 
countries from smoking cessation, with half of these 
in China. Across all countries, men in the bottom 
income group (poorest 20% of the population) would 
gain 6.7 times more life years than men in the top 
income group (richest 20% of the population; 155 
v 23 million). The average life years gained from 
cessation for each smoker in the bottom income 
group was 5.1 times that of the top group (1.46 v 0.23 
years). Of the $157bn (£113bn; €127bn) in averted 
treatment costs, the bottom income group would 
avert 4.6 times more costs than the top income group 
($46bn v $10bn). About 15.5 million men would avoid 
catastrophic health expenditures in a subset of seven 
countries without universal health coverage. As result, 
8.8 million men, half of them in the bottom income 
group, would avoid falling below the World Bank 
definition of extreme poverty. These 8.8 million men 
constitute 2.4% of people living in extreme poverty 
in these countries. In contrast, the top income group 
would pay twice as much as the bottom income group 
of the $122bn additional tax collected. Overall, the 
bottom income group would get 31% of the life years 
saved and 29% each of the averted disease costs 
and averted catastrophic health expenditures, while 
paying only 10% of the additional taxes.
CONCLUSIONS
Higher prices of cigarettes provide more health and 
financial gains to the poorest 20% than to the richest 
20% of the population. Higher excise taxes support 
the targets of the sustainable development goals 
on non-communicable diseases and poverty, and 
provides financial protection against illness.
Introduction
On current smoking patterns where large numbers 
of young adults start smoking but few quit, smoking 
will be responsible for about one billion deaths in the 
21st century.1 Most of these will be in low and middle 
income countries. At the global level, tobacco control 
relies on the Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control2 and increasingly on the United Nations 2030 
sustainable development goals. The latter include 
goals to eradicate extreme income poverty, reduce the 
age standardised death rates from non-communicable 
diseases by one third, and achieve universal health 
coverage so as to provide financial risk protection 
against the impoverishment that arises from illness.3 
These three goals are interrelated.
Tobacco use is the leading risk factor for non-
communicable diseases.1 In most countries, smoking 
prevalence and rates of smoking attributable diseases 
are highest in lower income stratums.4 Smoking 
accounts for much of the difference in risk of death 
among men of different social status.5 The World Health 
Organization has estimated that 100 million people 
fall into poverty (defined by low food expenditure) 
annually due to out-of-pocket health expenditures,6 
with much of these expenditures for the treatment of 
non-communicable diseases.
Progress towards goals for non-communicable 
diseases is possible only if tobacco cessation rates

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Higher excise taxes on tobacco are essential to reach the sustainable 
development goals to reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases by one 
third by 2030
Low income groups are more responsive to price increases than high income 
groups
There are few published studies of the distributional impact of higher tobacco 
taxes on health and financial outcomes
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Despite differences in socioeconomic class and health finance arrangements 
a 50% increase in tobacco prices strongly favours those in the bottom income 
group for life years saved, out-of-pocket expenses from tobacco attributable 
treatment costs averted, and avoidance of catastrophic health expenditures or 
poverty
Higher tobacco excise taxes are a powerful but generally underused tool by most 
governments to reduce expenditures on treatment of diseases that are a major 
cause of income poverty
In 13 middle income countries studied, around 450 million life years would be 
saved from higher excise taxes, contributing substantially to the target of the 
sustainable development goals of a one third reduction in mortality from non-
communicable diseases at ages 30-69 by 2030

in most low and middle income countries increase 
substantially.1 7 8 Effective tobacco control could 
avoid hundreds of millions of premature deaths in the 
21st century, and tobacco taxation is the single most 
effective intervention to increase cessation rates among 
current smokers and to decrease initiation by young 
people. The effects of taxes are greatest among young 
people and people on a low income.9 10 However, high 
excise taxes, at the levels recommended by WHO and 
the World Bank11 remain uncommon in most low and 
middle income countries.2 12
The relation between higher tobacco taxes and poverty 
levels, impoverishment due to medical treatment costs, 
and the financial burden of higher taxes in both low and 
high income groups have been published for China13 
and Lebanon.14 Broad representative assessments 
across a range of countries have not yet been done. Here, 
we quantify the likely effect of a 50% cigarette price 
increase on health, poverty, and financial outcomes in 
13 middle income countries with diverse socioeconomic 
demographic characteristics, tobacco use, and effective 
universal health coverage.
Methods
We developed a simple compartmental model to 
assess the health gains, financial protection, and tax 
gains for governments from a large increase in the 
market prices of cigarettes across income groups.15 
This model was developed by the Disease Control 
Priorities Project building on an earlier poverty and 
tobacco taxation analysis by the Asian Development 
Bank.13 15 16 Among the current cohort of smokers in 13 
countries, we calculated the cumulative effect of a one-
time 50% increase in the market prices of cigarettes on 
life years gained, treatment costs averted, number of 
men avoiding catastrophic health expenditures and 
extreme poverty, and additional tax revenues collected. 
The supplementary appendix (pages 3, 4, and 13-20) 
provides the details of the theoretical foundation, data 
inputs and sources, and statistical procedures.
Study population
We selected 13 middle income countries in Latin 
America and Asia, with a total of two billion men. For 
the compartment model we chose countries based 
on the prevalence of smoking, population size, and 
availability of data. Using the World Bank income 
definitions,17 six countries are classified as lower 
middle income (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, the 
Philippines, Vietnam, and Armenia) and seven as 
upper middle income (China, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, 
Colombia, Thailand, and Chile). We focused on male 
smokers, as they comprised about 90% of all smokers 
in these 13 countries.18 To estimate the number of 
smokers by five year age group and five income groups 
(where the bottom income group refers to the poorest 
20% of the population and the top group refers to the 
richest 20% of the population) in each country, we 
applied the male smoking prevalence by age group 
from the most recent rounds of the global adult tobacco 
survey or similar nationally representative surveys (see 
supplementary appendix pages 13-15) to the UN 2015 
population estimates.19 Because these surveys do 
not usually report household income, we used asset 
index or education as a proxy measure to estimate the 
smoking prevalence by income group.20
Price effects on smoking
In the main analyses we estimated the cumulative 
number of smokers who would quit as a consequence 
of a one-time 50% increase in the retail price of 
cigarettes. Quitting is a function of price elasticity of 
demand for cigarettes, age, and income. Studies on 
cigarette price elasticity (defined by the percentage 
reduction in cigarette consumption resulting from a 
specific increase in price) have mostly been done in 
high income countries but are increasingly available 
for low and middle income countries.9 10 Price elasticity 
estimates vary widely across countries, time periods, 
and study design, but reviews of all reliable evidence 
from both high income countries and low and middle 
income countries found that elasticity estimates 
fall within the range of −0.2 to −0.6, or an average 
of −0.4.9 10 The small number of studies in low and 
middle income countries found smokers to be at least 
as sensitive (and often more sensitive) to price than 
smokers in high income countries. A price elasticity 
of −0.4 implies about a 20% decrease in smoking with 
a 50% price increase. Of the reduction, roughly half 
(10%) is attributable to quitting by current smokers 
and half to fewer cigarettes smoked. Economic theory 
predicts that those on a low income and young people 
should be more sensitive to price than others, and this 
has been well documented in high income countries 
and in the more limited literature from low and middle 
income countries.9 Price responsiveness in young 
people and among smokers on a low income is about 
twice as great as it is in older people and smokers on a 
high income.9 21 The International Agency for Research 
on Cancer found all 18 price elasticity studies in low 
and middle income countries reviewed to show a 
gradient by income or education.9
We applied a relative weighted price elasticity matrix 
by age and income group to all estimates. Hence price 
elasticity in younger smokers (age 15-24 years) in the 
bottom income group was −1.27 whereas in smokers 
aged 25 or more in the top group it was −0.24. We 
applied the higher price elasticity to future smokers 
aged less than 15 years who have not yet started to 
smoke. Sensitivity analyses examined the key outcomes 
by excluding China and India (as these have more than 
two thirds of the male smokers of all 13 countries in the 
study), including the three countries (Chile, Colombia, 
and Mexico) with notable smoking in females, and 
testing price increases by 25% and 100% with the 
above elasticities. We also applied country specific price 
elasticities (see supplementary appendix pages 3 and 4).

quitting by age group and income group. We relied 
on epidemiological studies of populations in high 
and middle income countries, which document that 
smoking is responsible for deaths in at least half of 
the current and future smokers who begin early in 
adult life and do not quit. Smokers lose an average of 
10 years of life compared with otherwise similar non-
smokers.1 22-27 It is reasonable to apply this risk to the 
13 countries in the analysis, as most of the current and 
future smokers studied are aged less than 35 years so 
many began (or would begin) smoking in early adult 
life. We applied the benefits of cessation from studies 
in high-income countries as cessation rates in most 
low and middle income countries remain low.18 28 
Various studies in high income countries document 
that the life years gained from cessation varies by age: 
approximately 10 years gained for cessation before 
age 30 years and 9 years, 6 years, and 3 years gained 
for cessation by ages 30-44 years, 45-64 years, and 
more than 65 years, respectively.1 22-26 We used spline 
regression to smooth these estimates into five year 
intervals from 15 to 90 years, assumed similar risk 
reductions by age across the five income groups, and 
conservatively excluded any health benefits from fewer 
cigarettes smoked.
Next we estimated the treatment costs averted due 
to reduced tobacco attributable death. All costs and 
prices were in US dollars adjusted for purchasing 
power parity and expressed in inflation adjusted 
terms for 2015.17 We apportioned the calculated 
reductions in deaths from the above procedure across 
four main causes of smoking attributable mortality: 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, heart 
disease, and cancers (ignoring tuberculosis). We used 
global burden of disease estimates of the mortality 
proportions for these four diseases,29 validated with 
the local epidemiological evidence if available (see 
supplementary appendix pages 3 and 4).
We derived the annual treatment cost for each 
country for these four conditions for 2015 (adjusted for 
purchasing power parity)17 from peer reviewed studies 
or country reports (see supplementary appendix pages 
3 and 4). The treatment cost averted was a function 
of the reduced number of cause specific deaths 
attributable to tobacco. We quantified the number of 
men avoiding catastrophic healthcare expenditures 
using the WHO definition (out-of-pocket costs >10% 
of an individual’s yearly income)6 and extreme poverty 
as when out-of-pocket costs reduce daily income below 
the World Bank definition (<$1.90/day).17 Because the 
comparable average individual’s yearly income within 
each income group were not readily available for all 
13 countries, we created a probability distribution of 
catastrophic expenditures and extreme poverty from 
an income distribution function for each country 
based on the Gini coefficient and average per capita 
household income (see supplementary appendix 
pages 3 and 4).
Finally, to estimate the value of taxes gained from 
additional tax revenues from cigarette price increases, 
we used WHO estimates of country specific data on 
price per pack of cigarettes ($ purchasing power 
parity), tobacco tax incidence as a percentage of 
final price, and average cigarette sticks consumed by 
smokers each day across income groups.2 We used 
STATA version 13.0 for the analyses. 
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures nor were they 
involved in developing plans for implementation 
of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results.
Results
We studied 490 million male cigarette smokers in 13 
middle income countries (table 1); 291 million were 
in China and 199 million in the remaining countries. 
Smoking prevalence varied considerably across 
countries, as did the number of cigarettes smoked per 
day. In some countries, such as Indonesia, smoking 
prevalence was noticeably lower in higher income 
groups, whereas in Bangladesh and India, cigarette 
smoking prevalence was similar across income groups. 
The price (all in $ purchasing power parity) per pack 
of the most commonly smoked cigarettes varied from 
$2.20 in Colombia to $10.30 in Turkey. The absolute 
increase in the median excise tax needed to achieve a 
50% price increase was $1.70, ranging from $1.10 in 
Colombia and the Philippines to $5.10 in Turkey. The 
median of $1.70 would correspond to an approximate 
doubling of the excise tax rate, with the assumption 
that entirety of the excise tax increase is passed on to 
smokers.
The number of male smokers before the price 
increase was greater in the bottom income group 
(106 million, or 20%, range 14-27%) than in the top 
income group (82 million or 17%, range 9-24%); a 
ratio of 1.3:1 (table 2). A 50% price increase would 
result in about 67 million men quitting smoking, 
with the bottom income group having 7.7 times as 
many quitters as the top income group (23 million v 3 
million). Cessation would result in about 449 million 
years of life gained, about half of which would be in 
China (241 million). Across the 13 countries, the 
bottom income group would gain 6.7 times more life 
years than the top income group (155 million v 23 
million). The average life years gained for each smoker 
from cessation in the bottom income group was 5.1 
times that of the top income group (1.46 v 0.23 years). 
The average life years gained for each smoker would 
be greatest in young people. At ages 25-29 years, the 
50% higher price would lead to 1.4 life years gained 
for each smoker in the bottom income group compared 
with 0.3 in the top income group. At ages 60-64 years, 
the comparable results would be 0.6 and 0.2 life 
years gained for the bottom and top income groups, 
respectively (see supplementary appendix page 5).
The proportion of health expenditure borne by public 
health systems and the co-payment requirements for 
the four diseases varied across countries. The disease 
costs (all in $ purchasing power parity) that would be

averted to treat the four clusters of tobacco attributable 
diseases would be about $157bn. These averted costs 
in the bottom income group ($46bn, median 29%, 
range 16-34%) would be 4.6 times those in the top 
income group ($10bn, median 7%, range 2-12%). The 
increases in excise tax needed to achieve a 50% higher 
price would generate about $122bn across countries, 
corresponding to between 0.1% and 1.1% of each 
current country’s gross domestic product in 2015. 
In contrast to distribution of the health benefits, the 
extra tax revenue generated from the top income group 
($29bn, median 23%, range 19-35%) would be double 
that from the bottom income group ($15bn, median 
10%, range 5-22%).
Figure 1 presents the results for poverty and 
catastrophic expenditures in the six countries with 
low universal health coverage (India, Indonesia, 
Bangladesh, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China) and 
in Mexico, which had high out-of-pocket treatment 
costs for the four smoking attributable diseases. The 
50% higher cigarette price would lead to about 15.5 
million men avoiding catastrophic health expenditures 
and 8.8 million men avoiding extreme poverty, 
including 4.2 million in the bottom income group 
(median 37%, range 16-68%; see supplementary 
appendix page 6) and 2.5 million in the second lowest 
income group. Nearly all of the extreme poverty 
avoided was in the bottom income group. The 8.8 
million men represent 2.4% of the baseline number of 
360 million men and women living in extreme poverty 
in these seven countries. In most countries, there is an 
inverse relation between income group and number 
of people who will avoid catastrophic healthcare 
expenditures or poverty. In Bangladesh, however, a 
sizeable number of men who would avoid poverty and 
catastrophic healthcare expenditures would be from

the fourth income group owing to the relatively high 
prevalence of smoking in this income group.
Figure 2 summarises the differences in the key 
outcomes for the bottom and top income groups across 
the 13 countries. Smoking is 1.3 times more common 
in the bottom income group as the top income group. 
However, because smokers in the bottom income group 
are more likely to quit than those in the top income 
group, the bottom income group would receive a 
substantially larger share of the health and financial 
benefits for years of life gained, disease costs averted, 
and number of people avoiding catastrophic health 
expenditures. Overall, the bottom income group would 
get 31% of the life years saved and 29% each of the 
averted disease costs and averted catastrophic health 
expenditures but pay only 10% of the additional taxes.
Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. The 
ratio of catastrophic health expenditures avoided by 
the bottom versus top income group was 4:1 for all 
13 countries and similar (3.5:1) in the 11 countries

after exclusion of China and India. This ratio was 
similar (3.3:1) if we included female smokers from 
three countries with a relatively high proportion of 
female smokers to total smokers (Chile at 46% and 
Colombia and Mexico at 29% each). Use of lower or 
higher price increases or country specific elasticities 
showed slightly greater ratios for the bottom versus 
top income groups (fig 3; see supplementary appendix 
pages 7-10). The additional tax burden from a 100% 
price increase would be borne mostly by the top 
income group.
discussion
Across 13 diverse middle income countries, we found 
that the benefits of tobacco taxation through a 50% 
price increase favour the bottom income group of the 
population more strongly for life years saved, out of 
pocket expenditures from averted tobacco attributable 
treatment costs, catastrophic health expenditures, and 
extreme poverty averted. However, a much greater share 
of the additional tax burden is borne by the top income 
group. Our results were consistent across countries, 
despite noticeable differences in smoking prevalence, 
level of universal health coverage, and poverty 
levels. Our analysis challenges the conventional view 
that tobacco taxes are more detrimental to people 
on low versus high incomes, which is based on the 
observation that smokers with a low income spend a 
disproportionately greater share of their income on 
cigarettes than do high income smokers.30
Relevance of higher taxes to sustainable 
development goals
Higher tobacco excise taxes support three of the targets 
of the sustainable development goals on lowering 
income poverty, reduction of non-communicable 
diseases, and expanded financial protection against

universal health coverage, practicable increases in 
tax could avoid about 2.4% of the income poverty by 
averting out-of-pocket costs for disease treatment. 
The reduction in poverty is heavily concentrated in 
the bottom income group but is notable also in the 
second lowest group, suggesting that higher tobacco 
taxes help protect those on the borderline of extreme 
poverty. Higher tobacco excise taxes are a powerful 
but generally under-appreciated tool to be used by 
governments to reduce income poverty. Worldwide, 
some 20 million people could avoid extreme poverty 
for one year from a 50% higher cigarette price, which 
compares favourably with 30 million people who have 
avoided extreme poverty annually in recent years owing 
to economic growth and other reasons.31 Secondly, in 
these 13 countries alone, some 450 million life years 
would be saved from higher excise taxes, contributing 
substantially to the sustainable development goals 
target of a one third reduction in mortality from non-
communicable diseases at ages 30-69 years by 2030.8
The relevance of higher tobacco taxes to universal 
health coverage is more complex. Tobacco taxes can 
generate substantial revenues, but in most countries 
they are not enough to meet the financing needs of 
universal health coverage. Extra tobacco revenue 
could finance an average of 4% of the recently 
estimated costs of achieving the health system related 
sustainable development goals, ranging from 1% in 
India to 16% in Turkey (see supplementary appendix 
page 12).32 The goals of universal health coverage are 
not only to improve health but also to reduce poverty 
through financial risk protection.6 Tobacco taxation 
is an unusually effective way to achieve both. As 
such, tobacco taxation (within the strategies of the 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) should be 
a prominent and early intervention in most universal 
health coverage plans.
WHO observed that between 2012 and 2015 more 
than 100 countries raised excise taxes on tobacco.2 
However, few did so at the high levels required to 
reduce consumption, particularly in many low and 
middle income countries where rapid income growth 
has made tobacco relatively more affordable in the past 
decade.11 The median tax increase required to achieve 
a 50% higher price across the countries was $1.70 
for each pack of cigarettes, corresponding to a 100% 
increase in the excise rate. Although the doubling 
of excise taxes is not small, the Philippines, Turkey, 
France, and other countries have adopted comparable 
or even larger increases.12 33 The large required increase 
in excise taxes in some countries mostly reflects the 
low cost of manufacturing cigarettes. In addition to 
large tax increases that change consumer behaviour, 
governments need to pay attention to the structure 
of the tax and unintended consequences of price 
differentiation, which can lead to substitution of lesser 
taxed forms (eg, “cheap, short” cigarettes). In most low 
and middle income countries—most notably China and 
Indonesia—the cigarette industry manipulates a wide 
range of cigarette prices to limit the health effect of 
any tax increases by encouraging smokers to shift to 
cheaper brands. The structure in some countries can 
also create financial incentives for those who engage in 
tax evasion and avoidance. The World Bank has recently 
called on governments to implement large, simplified 
taxes that reduce downward substitution and combat 
tax avoidance.11 Such action requires dispelling 
common misconceptions about the consequences 
of higher taxes, most notably on smuggling and tax 
avoidance (see box 1).
Smokers, including those on low incomes, who 
do not quit or substantially reduce their tobacco 
consumption, will spend more of their income on 
cigarettes after a tax increase. Those who quit will free 
Box 1: Common misconceptions with supporting evidence about higher tobacco taxation
•  
Higher tobacco taxes affect poor people
Smokers on low incomes are more price responsive than wealthier smokers and hence quit (or smoke less) in greater proportions when taxes are 
higher; thus the health benefits are strongly concentrated in smokers on low incomes12 13 16 28
Higher taxes may lead to some smokers switching to cheaper cigarettes. Governments need to pay attention to high specific excise taxes on 
cigarettes of all lengths to encourage cessation rather than switching (by narrowing the price gap between the most and least expensive 
cigarettes). A large, simplified tax system can influence consumer behaviour and favour people on low incomes1 11 28
In relation to benefits to people on low incomes, spending and taxes both should be considered. Higher taxes enable higher revenue, which 
might be used to improve health and other social services for people on low incomes41
•  
Higher tobacco taxes lead to more illegal activities such as smuggling and tax avoidance
Legal and illegal tobacco products are not perfect substitutes because there is a high transaction costs involved in consuming illegal products. 
Higher taxes raise both official and black market retail prices9
The main determinant of smuggling is not price but lax enforcement of customs and tolerance for organised criminal smuggling networks9 41
Even in the face of moderate smuggling, higher excise tax prices reduce consumption and increase revenue11 28 41
•  
Higher tobacco taxes result in reduced tobacco revenues
The extra revenue per pack of cigarettes outweighs the reduced demand, yielding revenue increases10
The World Health Organization estimates that raising tobacco excise tax by Int$1 (about $0.80) in all countries would increase excise revenue by 
47%, representing an extra $141bn10
•  
Higher tobacco taxes result in reduced employment
Money not spent on tobacco does not disappear from the economy but is spent on other goods and services that generate employment. This is 
particularly true for countries where major shares of tobacco leaf or tobacco products are imported
Several reviews of even more extreme curtailing of tobacco use found that increases in tobacco taxes did not lead to net job losses42

up additional income for other expenditures that could 
enhance their household welfare. Spending on health, 
education, or other items is reduced in households 
where men are addicted to tobacco.34 35 Although the 
reductions in smoking related deaths from higher taxes 
are concentrated in men, the benefits of reductions in 
catastrophic health expenditures and poverty benefit 
children, women, and families. Effectively, tobacco 
taxation enables an income transfer from male smokers 
to females and other family members. Moreover, 
tobacco taxes reduce maternal tobacco use, which 
is an important risk factor for low birth weight and 
child mortality,36 additional targets of the sustainable 
development goals.
Limitations of this study
Ideally, direct epidemiological studies in various 
low and middle income countries would document 
the hazards of smoking and benefits of cessation by 
income group. As with any modelling study, ours has 
certain limitations. Firstly, we used a standard price 
elasticity of −0.4 across countries. Sensitivity analysis 
that used country specific elasticities yielded similar 
poverty effects. Our core premise of a gradient in price 
elasticity by age and income group is supported by 
economic theory and most (but not all) studies on price 
elasticity.9 21 Secondly, our model is static, estimating 
cumulative benefits of a one-time increase and not a 
longer term reduction in smoking. The ideal would be a 
dynamic model that incorporates discounting rates and 
changes in demographic, economic, and healthcare 
system characteristics over time. However, this is 
not yet developed. Large, one-time price increases in 
several countries or states within the United States have 
been associated with reduced tobacco use.9 If also true 
in low and middle income countries, the one-time price 
increase would reduce household expenditures on 
treatment of non-communicable diseases. Thirdly, in 
theory faster future economic growth among the lower 
income groups would mean that increases in tobacco 
taxes may benefit people on low incomes to a lesser 
extent than we estimate. In reality, the rapid economic 
growth in the 13 countries continues to be greater in 
the top income groups (ie, fast developing countries 
such as China and Brazil have Gini coefficients of 0.46 
and 0.53, respectively).17 Similarly, a rapid expansion 
of universal health coverage that reaches people on 
low incomes would also mean that increases in tobacco 
taxes are less likely to benefit people on low incomes 
than we estimate. Unfortunately, the expansion of 
universal health coverage has generally been slow, 
and high out-of-pocket costs continue to be the norm 
in many low and middle income countries.37
We also might be underestimating the true benefits 
of smoking cessation among people on low incomes. 
We were unable to assess loss of productivity 
and family earnings related to tobacco use and 
thereby the greater probability of being pushed into 
impoverishment. Only about 40% of welfare benefits 
of disease control broadly arise from averted treatment 
costs,38 with the rest from productivity gains that we 
did not include. Also, we did not take into account the 
averted cost related to negative externalities such as 
second-hand smoking and environmental damage.39 
We limited our analyses to cigarette smoking. The 
Indian subcontinent has a sizeable number of bidi 
(small, locally manufactured cigarettes) users as well 
as oral tobacco users. In this region, smoking patterns 
are changing, with cigarettes increasingly substituting 
bidis, particularly in those on low incomes and young 
people.12 40 Similarly, we also did not account for the 
modest health benefits of reduced amount of smoking. 
Finally, our estimates did not take into account 
the long term signalling effects of higher taxes on 
individual smoking behaviour. France has halved its 
daily per capita smoking in only 15 years (the UK took 
30 years), in part because its government announced 
at the outset (in 1992) that excise taxes would rise 5% 
above inflation every year.1 As with mortgages, future 
rational price expectations can have an additional 
benefit beyond the initial price increase.
Implications of this study
Our analyses suggest that large increases in tobacco 
excise taxation are effective not only at reducing 
smoking and its consequences on diseases but are also 
strongly relevant to the UN sustainable development 
goals for poverty and universal health coverage. 
Ongoing efforts by countries, the World Bank, WHO, 
and the Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation to advance tobacco control can use 
our findings as new evidence based arguments to 
accelerate smoking cessation. Modest action by many 
governments could yield unprecedented health gains 
and poverty reduction in the 21st century.41
