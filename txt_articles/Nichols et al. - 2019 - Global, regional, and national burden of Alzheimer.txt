Global, regional, and national burden of Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Dementia Collaborators*
Summary
Background The number of individuals living with dementia is increasing, negatively affecting families, communities, 
and health-care systems around the world. A successful response to these challenges requires an accurate 
understanding of the dementia disease burden. We aimed to present the first detailed analysis of the global prevalence, 
mortality, and overall burden of dementia as captured by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
(GBD) Study 2016, and highlight the most important messages for clinicians and neurologists.
Methods GBD 2016 obtained data on dementia from vital registration systems, published scientific literature and 
surveys, and data from health-service encounters on deaths, excess mortality, prevalence, and incidence from 
195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, through systematic review and additional data-seeking efforts. To 
correct for differences in cause of death coding across time and locations, we modelled mortality due to dementia 
using prevalence data and estimates of excess mortality derived from countries that were most likely to code deaths to 
dementia relative to prevalence. Data were analysed by standardised methods to estimate deaths, prevalence, years of 
life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; computed as the 
sum of YLLs and YLDs), and the fractions of these metrics that were attributable to four risk factors that met GBD 
criteria for assessment (high body-mass index [BMI], high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a diet high in sugar-
sweetened beverages).
Findings In 2016, the global number of individuals who lived with dementia was 43·8 million (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 37·8–51·0), increased from 20.2 million (17·4–23·5) in 1990. This increase of 117% (95% UI 114–121) contrasted 
with a minor increase in age-standardised prevalence of 1·7% (1·0–2·4), from 701 cases (95% UI 602–815) per 
100 000 population in 1990 to 712 cases (614–828) per 100 000 population in 2016. More women than men had dementia 
in 2016 (27·0 million, 95% UI 23·3–31·4, vs 16.8 million, 14.4–19.6), and dementia was the fifth leading cause of death 
globally, accounting for 2·4 million (95% UI 2·1–2·8) deaths. Overall, 28·8 million (95% UI 24·5–34·0) DALYs were 
attributed to dementia; 6·4 million (95% UI 3·4–10·5) of these could be attributed to the modifiable GBD risk factors 
of high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.
Interpretation The global number of people living with dementia more than doubled from 1990 to 2016, mainly due 
to increases in population ageing and growth. Although differences in coding for causes of death and the heterogeneity 
in case-ascertainment methods constitute major challenges to the estimation of the burden of dementia, future 
analyses should improve on the methods for the correction of these biases. Until breakthroughs are made in 
prevention or curative treatment, dementia will constitute an increasing challenge to health-care systems worldwide.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are a major 
and increasing global health challenge, with 40–50 million 
people currently living with dementia.1–3 Care and support 
of patients with dementia has wide-ranging consequences 
for families, health-care systems, and society as a whole.4 
There is growing evidence of risk factors for demen-
tia, which shows that lifestyle and other interventions 
might, if implemented effectively, contribute to delaying 
the onset and reducing the future number of people 
who have dementia.5–9 Changes in risk factor exposures 
might account for several cohort studies documenting a 
reduction in age-specific incidence rates in their study 
populations.3,6,10,11
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
(GBD) Study uses a systematic method to analyse fatal and 
non-fatal health losses to facilitate comparisons across 
countries and diseases. Annual updates of results quantify 
mortality, prevalence, incidence, and non-fatal health losses 
for more than 300 diseases and injuries by age and sex 
from 1990 for 195 countries and territories and many 
subnational locations, such as Mexican states or provinces 
of China. Although other efforts to estimate dementia pre-
valence1,2,12 have used meta-analytic strategies to synthesise

the available data, these analyses did not attempt to re-
concile and make the combined best use of different types 
of data on incidence, prevalence, excess mortality, and 
causes of death reported in literature sources, claims 
databases, and vital registration systems. Furthermore, 
GBD assesses the strength of causal evidence for risks and 
includes estimates of attributable disease burden from risk 
factors using a comparative risk assessment framework.
Global data and cross-country comparisons might help 
further current understanding of complex and multi-
factorial diseases such as dementia. The capacity of GBD 
to examine patterns across countries creates a unique 
opportunity to identify populations with different trends 
that in turn could reveal clustered risk or environmental 
factors, providing empirical evidence about factors that 
affect neurodegenerative diseases.4 Such findings could 
provide insights that can supplement and aid ongoing 
research, and also allow estimates of the future effect of 
dementia expected from rapidly ageing populations across 
the world. To facilitate further exploration of these 
patterns, we present an analysis of GBD 2016 data with 
the aim of articulating the key methods, results, and 
limitations pertaining to dementia estimation.
Methods
Overview and data sources
General methods of GBD, including methods for 
calculating the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a com-
posite indicator combining income per person, educa-
tion, and fertility, can be found in the general methods 
overview (appendix) and in the GBD 2016 overview 
papers.13–16 In this Article, we have highlighted the meth-
ods pertaining to processes specific to the estimation 
of Alzhemier’s disease and other dementias (hereafter 
referred to as dementia).
For the GBD analyses, the reference case definitions 
were either those from the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; DSM-III, DSM-IV, or 
DSM-5), which are used in surveys and cohort studies, or 
those from the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD; ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10), which are used in vital 
registration and claims data sources.17,18 For GBD analyses 
of dementia, the relevant ICD-9 codes were 290, 291.2, 
291.8, 294, and 331, and the relevant ICD-10 codes were 
F00, F01, F02, F03, G30, and G31. In GBD, for each disease 
a reference case definition was chosen that represents 
the most recent consensus or the most commonly used 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Over the past decade, there have been substantial research 
efforts to describe the global epidemiology of Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementias. Other efforts to summarise the 
evidence, including the World Dementia Report, have compiled 
evidence through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, but 
they report only on dementia prevalence by world region. 
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 
Study has published regular updates of estimates for dementia 
in 195 countries and territories and subnational locations, 
such as the provinces of China and states in countries such as 
Brazil, the USA, and Mexico. However, there has been no 
dedicated and detailed publication of GBD methods and 
estimates for dementia. GBD 2016 estimates for dementia 
incorporated 43 new data sources on the prevalence and 
incidence of dementia, updating a previous review that 
covered 1980 to 2015; new sources were identified through 
a systematic review of English-language articles published in 
PubMed from 23 Jan, 2015, to Oct 7, 2016,with the search terms 
“dementia”[Title/Abstract] AND (“prevalence” OR “incidence”)
[Title/Abstract].
Added value of this study
GBD 2016 added 5-year age groups from ages 80 to 95 years to 
replace the oldest category (≥80 years) used in GBD 2015, 
providing more detailed estimates where the burden from 
dementia was highest. Our report examined more closely the 
methods, results, and limitations specific to Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias with the aim of making this information 
more accessible to clinicians and researchers. The data 
informing estimates were heterogeneous, with 230 different 
diagnostic procedures across 237 studies. Over time, the 
global age-standardised prevalence was fairly stable: 
701 cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 602–815) per 
100 000 population in 1990 and 712 cases (614–828) per 
100 000 population in 2016, constituting an increase of 1·7% 
(95% UI 1·0–2·4). However, because of population ageing and 
growth, the number of people affected by dementia more than 
doubled since 1990 and almost 44 million prevalent cases were 
estimated globally in 2016. Age-standardised prevalence was 
1·17 (1·17–1·18) times higher in females than in males. We also 
estimated that 22·3% (11·8–35·1) of the total global DALYs due 
to dementia in 2016 could be attributed to the four modifiable  
risk factors that met GBD criteria for assessment (high 
body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, a diet high in 
sugar-sweetened beverages, and smoking). 
Implications of all the available evidence
This analysis identified substantial heterogeneity in 
case-ascertainment methods throughout the dementia 
literature, highlighting the need for more consistency in future 
research. Nevertheless, there is no doubt about the striking 
increase in the numbers of individuals living with dementia 
since 1990 due to ageing and population growth. Despite some 
evidence indicating small decreases in age-specific incidence, 
without a major scientific breakthrough the continuation of 
sweeping demographic trends in population ageing and 
growth will lead to further increases in the number of people 
living with dementia. With limited scope for prevention and the 
absence of an effective disease-modifying treatment, the 
burden on caregivers and the parts of health-care systems 
devoted to care of the elderly will continue to increase rapidly.

definition. Data based on alternative case definitions were 
adjusted if systematic bias was detected. We included 
237 sources of data from the scientific literature, and 
3 years of medical claims data from the USA. We identified 
176 sources reporting on prevalence, covering 17 of 
21 world regions, and 64 sources on incidence, covering 
ten of 21 world regions (appendix). No input data were 
available for Oceania, central Asia, eastern Europe, or 
southern sub-Saharan Africa.
We could not adjust the data for different study designs 
or case definitions because of the extreme hetero-
geneity in case-ascertainment methods. We identified 
230 different methods of screening and diagnosis in the 
237 scientific literature sources. Data points that had an 
age range of greater than 20 years were split into new 
data points for the 5-year age groups within the age 
range, using the age pattern from the USA as the country 
for which we had the most detailed information.
Natural-history model
We did not use the typical GBD cause of death ensemble 
modelling (CODEm) approach for dementia because we 
noted large inconsistencies between cause of death data 
and prevalence data over time and between countries. 
Data from the US Vital Registration system showed that 
the age-standardised rates of deaths from dementia 
between 1990 and 2016 increased by a factor of five, 
whereas there has been no corresponding increase in 
the prevalence of dementia over the same period.19–21 
Additionally, the highest age-standardised death rates 
were more than 50 times higher than the lowest age-
standardised death rates across different locations for 
2016, possibly indicating that the practice of coding a 
death to dementia as an underlying cause of death has 
not been consistent over time or between countries. To 
adjust for this bias, we jointly modelled cause of death 
and non-fatal outcomes for dementia. We first ran an 
initial cause of death model using CODEm, and an initial 
non-fatal model using DisMod-MR 2.1, the Bayesian 
meta-regression tool used in most non-fatal models for 
GBD.22,23 DisMod-MR 2.1 enforces consistency between 
the different parameters, because incidence determines 
the inflow into the pool of prevalent cases and excess 
mortality determines outflow via death. The rates of 
inflow and outflow then determine the average duration 
of disease. Both DisMod MR 2.1 and CODEm use 
covariates and borrow strength from locations in the 
same region that have data to make estimates for 
locations where there are no input data.
The initial CODEm model included 16 226 site-years of 
data (ie, data for a unique combination of location and 
calendar year). The covariates used in the initial CODEm 
model included diabetes prevalence, mean cholesterol, 
and mean body-mass index (BMI; full list in the 
appendix). The initial DisMod-MR 2.1 model included 
settings of no remission (ie, no cure), and no incidence 
before age 40 years. We also excluded incidence data from 
the model, because data for incidence and prevalence 
were inconsistent. In many locations, the incidence data 
combined with mortality estimates suggested a prevalence 
higher than the available prevalence data, and the model 
fitted above the prevalence data and below the incidence 
data. Because measurement of prevalent cases of de-
mentia probably has less error than measurement of 
incident cases, we decided to exclude incidence data and 
rely on prevalence data.
We let DisMod-MR 2.1 adjust medical claims data to 
correct for under-reporting compared with survey data. 
We used average years of education in the population 
aged 15 years and older and smoking prevalence as 
predictive covariates, because these risk factors for 
dementia have a large evidence base.24,25 From the initial 
model results we identified the locations with high-
quality vital registration systems that most often coded 
to dementia as a cause of death per prevalent case in 
the most recent year of estimates. For GBD 2016, 
these locations were the USA, Finland, Sweden, and 
Puerto Rico. We then used the log-transformed ratio 
between cause-specific mortality and prevalence for these 
locations to run a fixed-effects linear regression with 
dummy variables on 5-year age bins and sex. Because the 
ratio of cause-specific mortality and prevalence is an 
estimate of excess mortality rate, we used the results of 
this regression to predict data inputs for every GBD 
location and all years in a second DisMod-MR 2.1 model. 
As an exception, we retained the 2016 ratios of cause-
specific mortality and prevalence for the four locations 
used in the regression analysis but assumed the 2016 
ratios applied to the whole 1990–2016 period. Otherwise, 
the model included the same assumptions and covariates 
as the initial DisMod-MR 2.1 model. We used the 
prevalence outputs from this model to estimate years 
lived with disability (YLDs). We also used the cause-
specific mortality estimated from this model for our final 
cause-specific mortality results.
YLDs and risk estimation
To derive YLDs for dementia, we first divided dementia 
prevalence into three severity categories. We used data 
from a systematic review of studies reporting on the 
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)26 and pooled 
proportions of mild (CDR 1), moderate (CDR 2), and 
severe dementia (CDR 3) in random-effect meta-analyses. 
We did this separately for ages 40–69, 70–79, and 80 years 
or more. For GBD 2016, we included seven studies 
identified through systematic review published from 
1980 to 2015, covering two world regions. To calculate 
YLDs, we multiplied the prevalence at each severity level 
by the corresponding disability weight24 and further 
corrected for comorbidity using a simulation assigning 
all non-fatal outcomes to hypothetical individuals for 
each age group, sex, location, and year.27
We made estimates for high BMI, high fasting plasma 
glucose, smoking (including all smoked tobacco products),

and diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages as risk factors 
for dementia. For each of these risk factors we set a 
theoretical minimum exposure level (TMREL) at which 
the risk of health outcomes is lowest. The TMREL was set 
to greater than 20 and less than 25 kg/m² for BMI; greater 
than 4·5 and less than 5·4 mmol/L for high fasting plasma 
glucose; zero for smoking; and less than 5g/day for sugar-
sweetened beverages.
Criteria for inclusion as a risk factor in GBD included 
sufficient evidence of a causal relationship, availability of 
exposure data, and potential for modification.14 Although 
physical inactivity and absence of education were not 
assessed for inclusion as risk factors for dementia in GBD 
2016, these will be considered in upcoming rounds. We 
calculated population-attributable fractions based on 
relative risk data, exposure data, and a theoretical mini-
mum level of exposure. When aggregating risks, we 
assumed a multiplicative function and accounted for 
instances where one risk was mediated through another. 
Additional details on risk factor calculations are in the 
GBD 2016 risk factor overview paper.14
Compilation of results
Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying the 
reference life expectancy at each age, taken from the GBD 
reference life table, by the number of deaths in each age 
group.28 Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were then 
calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. Age-standardised 
rates were calculated using the GBD world popula-
tion standard.29 Uncertainty was propagated through all 
calculations by sampling 1000 draws at each step of the 
calculations, which enabled us to carry through uncertainty 
from multiple sources, including input data, corrections 
of measurement error, and estimates of residual non-
sampling error. 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI) were 
defined as the 25th and 975th values of the ordered draws. 
Any report on signi 
ficant differences was based on the 
95% UI of the difference not including zero.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the 
study and had final responsibility for the decision to 
submit for publication.
Results
Between 1990 and 2016, the number of prevalent 
dementia cases increased by 117% (95% UI 114–121), 
from 20·2 million (17·4–23·5) in 1990 to 43·8 million 
(37·8–51·0) in 2016, whereas there was an increase 
of only 1·7% (95% UI 1·0–2·4) in age-standardised 
prevalence, from 701 (602–815) per 100 000 population in 
1990 to 712 (614–828) per 100 000 population in 2016.

For all-age prevalence over the same period, there 
was an increase of 54·7% (95% UI 52·1–57·5), from 
383 (330–447) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 593 
(511–690) per 100 000 population in 2016. The percentage 
change from 1990 to 2016 in age-standardised prevalence 
was highest for the high-middle SDI quintile (table). 
Age-standardised prevalence varied by a factor of three 
across countries in 2016. Turkey had the highest age-
standardised prevalence (1192 [95% UI 1007–1405] cases 
per 100 000 population), followed by Brazil (1037, 882–1220). 
Nigeria (397, 335–462) and Ghana (406, 342–483) had the 
lowest age-standardised prevalence estimates (figure 1).
The number of deaths due to dementia increased by 
148% (140–157) between 1990 and 2016. Globally in 2016, 
dementia was the fifth-largest cause of death (2·4 million 
[95% UI 2·1–2·8] deaths) after ischaemic heart disease, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, intracerebral 
haemorrhage, and ischaemic stroke. In 2016, deaths due 
to dementia accounted for 4·4% (95% UI 3·8–5·1) of 
total deaths but 8·6% (7·4–10·1) of deaths in individuals 
aged more than 70 years (2·2 million [1·9–2·6] deaths),13 
making dementia the second largest cause of death in 
this age group after ischaemic heart disease. Globally, 
dementia caused 28·8 million (24·5–34·0) DALYs, 
making it the 23rd largest cause of DALYs globally in 
2016, up from 41st in 1990.16 Dementia accounted for 
1·2% (95% UI 1·0–1·4) of DALYs across all ages. Over 
the age of 70 years, this increased to 6·3% (5·4–7·5) of 
DALYs (23·9 million DALYs, 20·1–28·6).16
More women than men died from dementia in 2016 
(1·5 million, 95% UI 1·3–1·8 vs 0·8 million, 0·7–1·0). 
The age-standardised death rates in women were also 
higher than in men, in line with a higher prevalence in 
women than in men, indicating the female predominance 
was not simply due to the longer lifespan of women. 
Age-standardised global prevalence in females was 
1·17 times (1·17–1·18) the age-standardised prevalence in 
males in 2016, with more women globally affected by 
dementia (27·0 million, 95% UI 23·3–31·4) than men 
(16·8 million, 14·4–19·6).
Both YLLs and YLDs increased sharply with age 
(figure 2). However, YLL rates increased faster with age 
and were much higher than YLD rates at the oldest ages. 
Prevalence also increased substantially with age in both 
men and women, approximately doubling every 5 years 
between the ages of 50 and 80 years, after which the 
increase slowed owing to the high prevalence in the 
oldest ages (figure 3).
There was no clear pattern between age-standardised 
DALY rates for the 21 GBD world regions and SDI over 
the 1990–2016 estimation period (figure 4). At each SDI 
level, there was a large amount of heterogeneity between 
DALY rates due to dementia. There was no uniformity 
between regions in the changes over time in DALY rates,

with some regions increasing and others decreasing over 
the 1990–2016 period.
Overall, 6·4 million (95% UI 3·4–10·5) DALYs (22·3% 
[95% UI 11·8–35·1] of DALYs due to dementia) in 2016 
could be attributed to risk factors analysed as part of 
GBD: 3·5 million (1·4–6·7) DALYs (12·2% [4·7–23·1]) 
were attributed to high BMI; 2·1 million (0·4–4·9) 
DALYs (7·4% [1·6–16·1]) to high fasting plasma glucose; 
1·3 million (0·6–2·0) DALYS (4·4% [2·0–6·7]) to 
smoking; and 18·9 thousand (7·8–34·1) DALYs (0·07% 
[0·03–0·12]) to a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages. 
There was no significant difference in the proportion of 
all dementia DALYs in 2016 explained by risk factors in 
men (24·7%, 12·7–37·6) compared with women (20·8%, 
8·6–35·7). More detailed estimates, including values for 
all years from 1990–2016, and all locations, all age groups, 
and both sexes, can be found in our online results tool.
Discussion
We estimated that in 2016, 27·0 million (95% UI 
23·3–31·4) women and 16·8 million (14·4–19·6) men 
lived with dementia in the 195 countries and territories 
that were included in the 2016 round of GBD. The number 
of prevalent cases of dementia more than doubled from 
1990 to 2016, contrasting with relatively minor changes in 
age-standardised prevalence and pointing to population 
ageing and growth as the main drivers of the increase. 
The numbers of DALYs and age-standardised DALY 
rates showed similar patterns to the prevalence figures. 
Dementia was the fifth leading cause of cause of death 
in 2016.
Our overall global estimate of 43·8 million people 
living with dementia in 2016 is close to the estimate in 
the World Alzheimer Report 2015 of 46·8 million for 
2015.2 Additionally, the GBD estimate of a doubling in 
number of prevalent cases and a 148% (140–157) increase 
in dementia deaths over the 26-year period from 1990 to 
2016 is of the same order as the doubling time of 20 years 
previously reported.2,3 However, the previous studies 
reported results only at the region level and did not 
use data across regions to generate estimates for all 
countries.
The increase in the number of cases of dementia is of 
even more importance given that there is currently no 
effective disease-modifying cure or treatment for the 
disease.30 Additionally, even when clinical trials are 
initiated, many more end in failure than success in 
bringing a new disease-modifying drug to market, with 
ratios of more than 100:1 compared with the 14·6:1 
pharmaceutical industry average.31,32 Without potential 
treatments, increasing numbers of cases will pose un-
due burden on individuals who have dementia, their 
caregivers, and health-care systems more generally.
In GBD 2016, only four risk factors were judged to have 
sufficient evidence for a causal link to Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias: high BMI, high fasting plasma 
glucose, smoking, and high intake of sugar-sweetened 
beverages.23 In GBD, the effect of high intake of sugar-
sweetened beverages was posited to be mediated through 
BMI on the basis of scientific literature linking BMI with 
dementia, but sugar-sweetened beverages as such ex-
plained only a negligible fraction of dementia burden 
attributed to risks. GBD is continuously reviewing new 
evidence for risk-outcome pairs and will update estimates 
of dementia burden attributable to risks in upcoming 
cycles for risk factors that meet GBD criteria for causality.

A Lancet Commission Report5 suggested that modifiable 
risk factors including hearing loss, education, smoking, 
depression, physical inactivity, social isolation, diabetes, 
and obesity could account for as much as 35% of dementia 
burden. In the context of our finding of a doubling of the 
prevalence of this terminal disease every 5 years over age 
50 years, and the absence of a cure, the impetus to 
examine risk factors is clear.
Furthermore, the timing of interventions and pre-
vention efforts focused on modifiable risk factors for 
dementia warrants further investigation. The prodrome 
of disease is thought to be long, with evidence point 
ing 
to a length of 20–30 years, but potentially longer.33 
The inability to identify individuals accurately in the 
prodromal stage complicates the study of risk factors. 
Efforts to explore the timing of risk factors during this 
period are further limited by the span of observational 
studies and the short length of randomised controlled 
trials, as well as uncertainty over whether exposures are 
causative, are bystanders of highly correlated factors, or 
are even early symptoms of disease. Because of these 
issues, there are so far no official international lifestyle 
guidelines for preventing dementia.34 However, attention 
on the effects of dementia risks is increasing, and WHO 
has created a group tasked with the development of risk-
reduction guidelines.35
By 2050, the number of people living with dementia 
could be around 100 million.36 Tackling this will require 
training of health professionals, as well as planning and 
building facilities to cater to increasing numbers in-
dividuals with dementia. The cost of care for those living 
with dementia is also very high, especially in high-income 
countries. According to recent estimates, in the USA the 
cost was US$818 million in 2015, an increase of 35% since 
2010.37 Since ageing is expected to continue, the only way to 
reduce burden and associated costs is to identify effective 
preventive or treatment measures. Despite the low return 
on research investment in dementia in the past, the size 
of the burden and its increasing trend warrant a con-
tinued effort to find effective means of intervening. Until 
such breakthroughs are made, dementia will constitute 
an increasing challenge to health-care systems across 
the globe.
There were several limitations, separate from the broader 
limitations of GBD, relevant to the modelling process for 
dementia. First, to correct for changes in coding practices 
in cause of death data, we selected the countries that were 
most willing to code to dementia as a cause of death per 
prevalent case, and we assumed that certification and 
coding practices in these countries are correct. Although 
coding practices are probably not perfect in these countries, 
we selected them as the best available benchmark. Second, 
in this correction we then assumed that the excess 
mortality derived from these countries applied to all 
countries across the entire timeseries. Although this 
assumption was clearly approximate, it was necessary to 
address the changes in coding practices that led to large 
changes over the study period in cause of death data from 
countries with high-quality vital registration. Third, in 
correcting for the bias in cause of death data, we relied on 
prevalence data to determine patterns in geographical 
distribution of both prevalence and mortality. Although we 
had a large number of data sources from western Europe, 
east Asia, high-income Asia-Pacific, and high-income 
North America, for 13 of the 21 regions we had fewer than 
five prevalence sources. Fourth, there was a large amount 
of heterogeneity in the ways in which dementia was 
diagnosed within the available data. Of the 237 avail-
able data sources, 230 different diagnostic procedures 
were used.

Although most of the data ultimately classified demen-
tia cases using the DSM or ICD definitions, differences 
between different versions of the DSM criteria could have 
led to differences in prevalence estimates, as suggested in 
a meta-regression analysis of prevalence studies in China.38 
Even if the same screening test was used, different studies 
often used different cutoff scores. For example, although 
42% of studies used the Mini-Mental State Examination in 
the screening phase, the absolute cutoff scores that were 
used ranged from 18 to 28, and other studies used different 
cutoff scores by educational attainment level. In this round 
of GBD we did not find a way to correct for such bias 
because of the extreme variability in methods, so it is likely 
that part of the observed variation in prevalence was due to 
measure 
ment bias rather than reflecting true geographical 
variation.
A potential next step in the GBD is to consider dividing 
dementia into subtypes, as these might have different 
epidemiological features and potentially different pre-
vention and treatment strategies. A first subdivision 
could be Alzheimer’s disease dementia, vascular de-
mentia, and remaining types. The challenges of sub-
dividing include sparse data and the complication of how 
to handle mixed types of dementia.39 However, increased 
use of biomarkers in the classification of dementia and 
Alzheimer’s disease might help facilitate subdivision.40,41 
Additionally, the data on severity distribu 
tions over age 
rely on few data sources and can be strengthened. We also 
aim to expand our data coverage through increased use of 
claims data and other data types, including general 
practitioner data, which have been used to estimate 
dementia prevalence.42–44
Monitoring trends in dementia is difficult because of 
the extreme variation in cause of death coding pract-
ices and the large heterogeneity in case-ascertainment 
methods. Although previous guidelines have been de-
veloped to systematise the reporting of neurological 
disorders generally, because of the diagnostic challenges 
noted with dementia, disease-specific guidelines are 
warranted and resources should be directed towards 
creating and implementing more systematic methods.45 
The GBD study will continue to update its estimates for 
dementia annually, and estimates might become more 
robust if data collection methods improve. Additionally, as 
new data become available on risk factors for dementia 
that meet GBD criteria for causal links, they can be 
incorporated into future iterations of GBD.
