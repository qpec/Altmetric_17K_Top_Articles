Title of article:  
 
Are corticosteroid injections more beneficial than anaesthetic alone in the management of rotator 
cuff related shoulder pain? A systematic review. 
 
ABSTRACT 
Objective: To compare the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections to local anaesthetic injections, in 
the management of rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP).  
Design: Systematic review with best evidence synthesis. 
Data sources: The Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PEDro and EMBASE electronic databases 
were searched (inception until 08/06/2017).  Reference lists of included articles were also hand 
searched.  
Eligibility criteria: Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility. Randomised controlled trials 
were included if they compared subacromial injections of corticosteroid with anaesthetic injections. 
Two reviewers independently extracted data regarding short-, mid- and long-term outcomes for pain, 
self-reported function, range of motion and patient-perceived improvement. 
Results:  Thirteen RCTs (n=1013) were included. Four trials (n=475) were judged as being at low risk 
of bias. Three studies of low risk of bias favoured the use of corticosteroid over anaesthetic-only 
injections in the short-term (up to 8 weeks). There was strong evidence of no significant difference 
between injection types in mid-term outcomes (12-26 weeks). There was limited evidence of no 
significant difference between injection types in long-term outcomes.   
Conclusion:  Corticosteroid injections may have a short-term benefit (up to 8 weeks) over local 
anaesthetic injections alone in the management of RCRSP. Beyond 8 weeks, there was no evidence 
to suggest a benefit of corticosteroid over local anaesthetic injections.  
Trial registration number:  PROSPERO CRD42016033161.

What are the new findings? 
• 
Corticosteroid injections may confer superior benefit compared to anaesthetic-only injections 
in the short term (up to 8 weeks). 
• 
Beyond 8 weeks, corticosteroid and anaesthetic-only injections had the same therapeutic 
effect for rotator cuff-related shoulder pain 
• 
It is unknown if improvement over time is due to placebo, natural history or a therapeutic 
effect of the medicines used in the published research 
 
How might these findings inform clinical practice in the future? 
• 
Both corticosteroid and anaesthetic-only injections may have short-term benefit for people 
considering injection therapy for rotator cuff-related shoulder pain  
• 
Corticosteroid injections may have a superior short-term therapeutic effect compared to 
anaesthetic-only injections, but not beyond that time point. 
• 
The medium- and long-term effects of corticosteroid and anaesthetic injections are equivocal 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder with prevalence estimates ranging from 6.9 to 
26.0% for point prevalence, annual prevalence; 4.7 to 46.7%, and lifetime prevalence; 6.7 to 
66.7%.(1) Prevalence increases with age(2) and shoulder pain is frequently associated with long term 
disability.(3-5) Injection therapy is a common intervention for musculoskeletal shoulder pain and is 
administered in primary and secondary care. In the United Kingdom, general practitioners (GPs) 
administer corticosteroid (CS) injections to approximately 1 in 10 people presenting with shoulder pain 
in primary care.(3) Injection therapy for shoulder pain is also performed by physiotherapists, 
orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, radiologists, sports and exercise medicine doctors and 
others, in primary and secondary care, as well as in private settings. However, the definitive number 
of people receiving CS injections for musculoskeletal shoulder conditions remains unknown. 
 
Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP)(6) is an over-arching clinical term and includes a number 
of other conditions: subacromial impingement syndrome,(7) subacromial pain syndrome (8) 
and rotator cuff tendinopathy.(9, 10)  In addition to local tissue pathology, persistent pain associated 
with RCRSP may be related to altered processing and output of the central nervous system.(11, 12) 
Education, advice and exercise are the most common treatments for RCRSP(6) and have 
comparable results to surgery.(6, 13) Another very common treatment for this condition, is injection 
therapy, which typically involves injections of corticosteroid in isolation, or more commonly, mixed with 
anaesthetic(14) into the subacromial space.(15) For patients with RCRSP, corticosteroid, or 
corticosteroid and anaesthetic preparations are often administered for treatment (3) and anaesthetic 
injections alone are used for diagnosis, in a procedure known as the Neer impingement test.(7) 
 
Although corticosteroid injections for RCRSP are common, the definitive mechanism of action is 
uncertain, with suggestions they may have an anti-inflammatory role,(16) reduce tenocyte 
numbers(17) and inhibit nociceptor activity.(18) There is also uncertainty regarding clinical 
effectiveness with previous reviews suggesting their benefit maybe unclear,(19, 20) short-lived,(21-
23) no greater than non-steroidal anti-inflammatories,(21, 22) or beneficial for up to 9 months.(24) In 
addition, there is emerging evidence linking the use of corticosteroid injections with negative effects 
on rotator cuff tissue.(25-27) Due to these risks, anaesthetic-only injections (although not devoid of 
risk) might, when deemed appropriate, be considered a reasonable alternative to corticosteroid in the 
management of RCRSP.(6) A recently published meta-analysis assessed short-term outcomes and 
concluded that corticosteroid injections provide, at best, a minimal transient pain reduction in a small 
number of patients with rotator cuff tendinosis.(23) 
 
No previous review has directly compared corticosteroid alone, or corticosteroid and anaesthetic 
injections, with local anaesthetic-alone injections in the treatment of RCRSP. A comparison of this 
nature is relevant for a number of reasons, including the common use of injection therapy in the

management of RCRSP,(3) as well as: (i) the potential comparable clinical effectiveness of these 
medicines,(14) and (ii) the potential deleterious effect of corticosteroid on tendon tissue.(26) 
 
To inform the shared-decision making process, those seeking and providing treatment for RCRSP, 
would be better informed with more knowledge on injection therapy, especially comparing the most 
commonly performed procedures (corticosteroid alone, or corticosteroid and anaesthetic injections, 
with local anaesthetic alone injections) in the management of RCRSP. Therefore, the aim of this 
review was to compare these pharmacological preparations in the management of RCRSP, for clinical 
effectiveness (symptoms, range of movement and function) in the short-, medium- and long-term. 
 
METHODS 
 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane 
collaboration guidelines were followed.(28-30) PROSPERO registration number: CRD42016033161. 
 
Population. Inclusion criteria: Studies with adult participants diagnosed with RCRSP were 
included.(6) Exclusion criteria: Participants with non-RCRSP shoulder conditions such as shoulder 
dislocation or instability, fractures, rheumatological conditions or frozen shoulder. Also, people who 
had undergone previous surgery, as well as those with confirmed full thickness rotator cuff tears. 
 
Intervention/control. Inclusion criteria:  Randomised clinical trials. Studies were included if they 
compared groups receiving single or repeated: subacromial injections of corticosteroid with or without 
local anaesthetic, versus local anaesthetic injection without corticosteroid. Concurrent prescription of 
exercise therapy, as well as prescription of pain relieving medications, such as analgesics and non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID’s), were permitted inclusions, as this reflects common 
clinical management of RCRSP.(6, 31) 
 
Exclusion criteria: In the treatment of RCRSP, the subacromial space is the most common target for 
injections and investigations of injection therapy that did not solely target this region(32, 33) were 
excluded. Other injection procedures, such as barbotage, were also excluded.  
   
Outcome:  Outcome measures included shoulder pain, self-reported function, range of motion (ROM) 
and patient-perceived improvement.  Follow-up time post intervention was defined as short-term (less 
than 3 months), mid-term (3-12 months), and long-term (a year or longer).(34) 
 
Data Sources: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro and ‘CINAHL plus’ databases were 
searched from inception to June 8th, 2017 by two independent reviewers (TC and MM).  No 
language, date or publication restrictions were applied.  Search terms included “shoulder”, 
“impingement”, “subacromial”, “injections”, “corticosteroid”, and “local anaesthetic”.  These terms were 
linked broadly to the PICO elements for the review question (population, intervention, comparators, 
and outcome) (Table 1).  
The reference lists of retrieved articles, including previous systematic reviews, were assessed for 
additional study titles and relevant publications; including, articles not identified in the search, 
personal communications, books and book chapters. None were identified.

Study selection:  Studies that were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were excluded from the 
review.  Selection of studies was independently performed by two reviewers (TC and MM).  Where 
full-text manuscripts were not accessible, the corresponding authors were contacted.  If there was no 
reply or the full text was not available, the study was excluded from this review. Following this process 
(and after a one month wait) two studies were excluded from the review as only abstracts of these 
studies have been published.(35, 36) Two eligible studies (37, 38) not published in the English 
language were professionally translated into English by bi-lingual members of the Cochrane 
collaboration.    
 
Data extraction: Data were independently extracted by two reviewers (TC and MM) using the 
Cochrane 
data 
extraction 
form 
for 
RCT 
intervention 
reviews 
(http://training.cochrane.org/resource/data-collection-forms-intervention-reviews).  Any discrepancies 
in this process were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers, followed by reassessment of 
the data.  A system to resolve any disagreements was established a priori via discussion with a third 
reviewer (JL), but no such discrepancies occurred. Data extraction for the two non-English studies 
were performed by the bi-lingual members of the Cochrane collaboration. 
 
Risk of bias assessment: Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using the domain-
based Cochrane tool for RCTs (see Table 2 and Figure 2). Trials were evaluated as low risk of bias if 
all individual criteria were low, and high if at least one was rated as high (and that criterion was 
deemed by the reviewers to introduce bias).      
For further information on this tool please refer to the Cochrane collaboration handbook (39).  
Exceptions were made if a study was rated as high risk of bias in a particular criterion, but that it was 
judged by the reviewers not to have affected the overall risk of bias. For example, if a clinician 
performing the injections in a study was not blind to the treatment but the patient was blinded, and 
blind outcome assessment was used then the overall risk of bias would be scored as low.  Items rated 
as unclear raised risk of bias.(39) An overall risk of bias rating for each trial was agreed by two 
reviews (TC and MM).  Table 3 details pharmacological information and injection method relating to 
the studies deemed to be at low risk of bias.  A system to resolve any disagreements was established 
a priori via discussion with a third reviewer (JL). Three such disagreements occurred during the risk of 
bias assessment and consensus was agreed by discussion following review of the data. Further 
discussion with the third reviewer was therefore not required.   
 
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment procedures were pilot-tested by TC and MM on three 
similar articles prior to the formal review process.(40) A Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was used to 
assess inter-rater reliability for judgement of high and low risk of bias for each criterion.  The number 
of agreements was 36/39 (92.31%) with a Kappa score of 0.836 and thus the level of agreement was 
considered strong.(41) 
 
Data syntheses: 
The studies included in our review utilised different medications, doses and outcome measures (see 
supplementary Table 1).  Due to these confounding variables, a decision not to pool data to perform a 
meta-analysis was reached. Instead, we used best evidence synthesis to synthesise the results 
following data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Textual descriptions of studies were written

to aid the synthesis of findings, and tables were used to present study characteristics, data extraction 
and risk of bias assessments. Studies were grouped in accordance with their level of risk of bias in 
order to identify those assessed as having the highest level of internal validity. 
. The best evidence synthesis was based on the quality of the studies reviewed (43): 
• 
Strong evidence – provided by generally consistent findings in multiple high quality RCTs; 
• 
Moderate evidence – provided by generally consistent findings in one high quality RCT plus 
one or more low quality RCTs, or by generally consistent findings in multiple low quality 
RCTs; 
• 
Limited or conflicting evidence – only one RCT (either high or low quality) or inconsistent 
findings in multiple RCTs 
• 
No evidence – no RCTs 
 
To guide clinical recommendations, studies were combined in relation to their outcome timescales(34) 
and whether their results favoured corticosteroid, local anaesthetic or neither injection type.   
 
RESULTS 
The electronic database search, performed on June 8, 2017, identified 287 potentially eligible articles. 
Ultimately, 13 full-text studies were included in this systematic review and seven studies were 
excluded.(35, 36, 44-48)  Figure 1 details the PRISMA flow chart.

Short-term comparisons (0-12 weeks): 
Twelve studies assessed short-term (0-12 weeks) outcomes of injection therapy for RCRSP.  Five of 
the twelve studies, four of high risk of bias(38, 49-51) and one of low risk of bias(52) reported in 
favour of corticosteroid injections for a range of different outcome measures (Table 3).   
Three further studies, one of high risk of bias (53) and two of low risk of bias (54, 55) reported 
improvements in the first 4-6 weeks  in favour of corticosteroid, but reported no significant difference 
between groups at 12 weeks. The remaining four studies; three of high risk of bias(37, 56, 57) and 
one of low risk of bias(14) reported no significant difference in short-term outcomes between the two 
types of injection therapy at any time-point. 
In summary, three trials(52, 54, 55) (n=417) of low risk of bias favoured corticosteroid injections for 
the first 4-8 weeks post injection and one trial(14) of low risk of bias (n=48) found no difference 
between the two types of injection. 
 
 
Mid-term comparisons (13-26 weeks): 
In the mid-term two studies (51, 58) (both of high risk of bias) reported a significant difference in 
outcome favouring corticosteroid injection.  One study(37) (of high risk of bias) reported a significant 
difference in favour of local anaesthetic injection for pain relief.  The remaining two studies,(14, 54) 
both of low risk of bias and including 217 participants, reported that there was no significant difference 
in mid-term outcomes between the two types of injection therapy. Penning et al(54) mixed anaesthetic 
(lidocaine 1%) with sodium chloride (0.9%) and the effect of sodium chloride may have been a 
confounding influence. Of note, Penning et al(54) reported that this preparation (lidocaine and sodium 
chloride), designated as the placebo group in this trial, had the best results at 26 weeks with respect 
to reduction in pain and improvement in functional mobility. 
 
Long-term comparisons (≥ 1 year): 
This review identified only two studies with long-term outcome measures of at least one year.  In 
summary, in the long-term there is evidence from only one study (38) (high risk of bias) favouring 
corticosteroid injections, and one study (55) (low risk of bias, n=179) suggesting no significant 
difference between injection groups. 
 
 
Best evidence synthesis: 
Using the rating system described in our methods section (43) and taking into account the results 
from all 13 studies (both of low and high risk of bias) to provide a best evidence synthesis, we 
summarise the following results: 
  
• 
There is strong evidence (from 8 trials, 3 of low risk of bias) to suggest a significant benefit of 
corticosteroid injections over anaesthetic-only injections for the first 4-8 weeks. 
• 
There is strong evidence (from 7 trials, 3 of low risk of bias) to suggest that at 12 weeks there 
is no significant difference in outcome between injection types.   
• 
There is strong evidence (from 2 trials of low risk of bias) to suggest that there is no 
significant difference in outcome between injection types in the mid-term (26 weeks). 
• 
There is limited evidence (from one trial of low risk of bias) to suggest that there is no 
significant difference between injection types in the long-term (1 year or longer). 
 
In summary, corticosteroid injections may have better short-term results than anaesthetic only 
injections in the first 8 weeks. There does not appear to be any convincing evidence from the studies 
of low or high risk of bias that corticosteroid injections confer additional benefit over anaesthetic-only 
injections after this time point.   
 
DISCUSSION 
The studies evaluated as being at low risk of bias in this review have indicated that there may be a 
temporary initial benefit (4-8 weeks) of administering corticosteroid in comparison to anaesthetic 
injections for the treatment of RCRSP. There does not appear to be any evidence that corticosteroid 
injections confer any additional benefit after this time point. We are unable therefore to establish 
whether corticosteroid medications only afford a therapeutic advantage for 4-8 weeks and no added 
benefit thereafter, or whether they provide an initial benefit after which time both medications are of 
equal value.

The certainty of any conclusions reached is challenged by the choice, appropriateness and lack of 
consistency of outcome measures used for the patient populations within the individual studies. Due 
to variation in study design and inconsistent use of primary outcome measures, we did not pool data. 
Although our study differs in its primary objectives and methodology, our findings are similar to those 
reported in a recent review.(23)  The authors of this recent review did not identify any additional 
evidence that was not included in our review that may have influenced our findings.  The continued 
use of corticosteroids is suggested by the authors to be attributable to “habit, to the underappreciation 
of the placebo effect, to satisfy patient desire for a physical intervention, or for simple remuneration”. 
The majority of the included studies did not perform injection therapy in isolation.  Although use of 
concurrent therapy (exercise, analgesics and NSAID’s) was varied, it was balanced within each 
individual trial.  There is no definitive way of determining the impact of concurrent therapy in addition 
to the administered injections on the reported outcomes.  Because of this uncertainty the influence of 
an independent injection or an injection in conjunction with other therapy requires further 
investigation. 
 
The majority of the investigations included in this review described the administration of local 
anaesthetic-injections as a placebo procedure, assuming that local anaesthetic injections in the 
subacromial space are inert and do not provide any therapeutic benefit.  However, recent evidence 
suggests that local anaesthetics such as lidocaine and bupivacaine may have an effect of reducing 
tenocyte numbers(17, 59) and altering collagen organisation in tendons.(60) Increased cellularity has 
been associated with tendinopathy(61, 62) and if elevated, reducing tenocyte numbers may be a 
possible mechanism by which injection therapy may contribute to the restoration of tendon 
homeostasis.(6) The manner by which injections may improve symptoms remains elusive and in 
addition to; reducing inflammation, restoring tissue homeostasis, reducing the threat of pain, 
placebo,(6) it has also been suggested that the therapeutic effect of subacromial injections may be 
the effect of distension of the subacromial space.(14) Due to these possible chemical, biological and 
physical effects the assumption that local anaesthetic injections are a true placebo is challenged, and 
suggests their use may provide a therapeutic effect. However, this needs to be balanced by a 
potential deleterious effect.(60).  Further research is required to determine the benefits of the 
medicines used in these studies compared with; other medicines, other interventions, natural history 
and a validated placebo. The physiological effects of these interventions on the local tissues needs 
also to be further investigated. 
 
Implications for practice. There are a paucity of data quantifying the number of corticosteroid 
injections performed annually in the United Kingdom. Limited evidence from one out-patient survey 
(n=2000) suggested the shoulder was the most common anatomical site of musculoskeletal injection, 
accounting for over a third of all injections. Seventy two percent of injections for the shoulder (n=1440) 
were for the stated treatment of subacromial bursitis (RCRSP).  Recent United Kingdom National 
Health Service figures reveal that almost 800,000 prescriptions of injectable corticosteroids are 
dispensed nationally within primary care per year.(63) The average cost of each prescription of 
corticosteroid is estimated at £5.16p, totalling a yearly national cost of over £4,000,000 (Health and 
Social Care Information Centre, 2015). The average cost of a standard dose of local anaesthetic (5ml 
of 1% Lidocaine) is £0.24p.(64) We believe it is safe to assume that, whilst exact figures for patients 
with RCRSP are unknown, the cost of corticosteroid injections for this patient group is sizable and, if 
local anaesthetics prove safe and effective in future research, significant cost savings could be 
achieved. Lidocaine only injections would be over twenty times less expensive than the average cost 
of corticosteroid medication.  
 
Clinically, in addition to cost, is the growing concern regarding the negative effects of corticosteroids 
upon tendon tissue.(26, 27, 65) It has also been suggested that the use of corticosteroid injections 
may detrimentally impact the course of lateral epicondyalgia.(66) This review has highlighted a lack of 
evidence to support the use of corticosteroid injections over local anaesthetic injections for the 
treatment of RCRSP after an 8-week period, which raises important issues for clinicians. Should 
clinicians avoid injections entirely? Should clinicians consider local anaesthetic injections for patients 
with RCRSP as the first choice of management, and only provide corticosteroid injections to those 
who do not respond to local anaesthetic? Additionally, potentially the risks of both corticosteroid and 
anaesthetic-only injection outweighs the benefits, as both pharmaceutical products may damage 
tendon tissue. Future research is needed that compares injections of corticosteroids, local 
anaesthetic, saline injections, needle only (for the mechanical effect), other products (e.g. hyaluronate

sodium) an advice-only group, true placebo and a control group (to map natural history). In addition, 
uncertainty persists over the benefit of image-guided versus landmark-guided injection therapy for the 
treatment of RCRSP,(32, 67) and whether the procedure should be performed locally or 
systemically.(33)  
 
In an investigation of local (corticosteroid to the subacromial bursa, local anaesthetic to the gluteal 
region) versus systemic (corticosteroid to the gluteal region, local anaesthetic to the subacromial 
bursa) for RCRSP, Ekberg et al(33) concluded that as both groups improved, both local and systemic 
injections of corticosteroid were equally effective. Although this may support a systemic effect of 
corticosteroid, these findings may be confounded for a number of reasons. This review suggests that 
corticosteroid injections may confer clinical benefit in the first 8 weeks but beyond this time point both 
types of injections and anaesthetic injections appear to be equally effective. Therefore, the conclusion 
that local and systemic corticosteroid injections are equally effective(33) needs to be considered 
cautiously as the benefit reported in this study may have been due to the administration of 
corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injections to the subacromial bursa. In addition, as there was no 
control group, the reported findings(33) may have mapped natural improvement, or possibly an 
equivalent placebo response in both groups.  
 
The findings of this review suggest that, in the treatment of RCRSP, corticosteroid injections may 
have a more beneficial effect than anaesthetic injections alone in the short-term (up to 8 weeks). 
However, the size of this effect is uncertain and beyond this time point, the two medicines appear to 
have a comparable effect. The combination of anaesthetics and sodium chloride may be associated 
with better outcome at 26 weeks.(54) Anaesthetic alone may also have a positive effect in the short-
term. The uncertainty implies that it is not yet possible to guide clinicians on particular circumstances 
where (i) there is a definitive role for injection therapy for RCRSP and (ii) when corticosteroid or 
anaesthetics may be equally responsive or one may be more beneficial than the other. Equally 
important is that both medicines may have detrimental effect on rotator cuff tissue. Shared decision 
making empowers people seeking healthcare to voice their opinions and thoughts. The findings of this 
review may be used to help inform people of the risks and benefits of their choices. 
 
LIMITATIONS: 
There is debate regarding how to assess risk of bias and methodological quality in clinical trials.(68) 
The variety of tools available, covering differing items/domains, suggest a lack of agreement 
regarding their relevance.(69) The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used in this review.  Although widely 
used, this tool does have some acknowledged challenges; these include modest inter-rater 
agreement and how to deal with the risk of bias associated with funding/conflicts of interest.(70)  In 
this review inter-rater agreement was strong with both reviewers making similar judgments regarding 
the importance of potential sources of bias (92.31%, Kappa score of 0.836) and conflict of interest 
data are presented (Table 2).  The assessment of risk of bias in this review was influenced by the 
amount of incomplete or missing information in included studies(70) (Table 2). This contributed to 
studies being rated as being at high risk of bias and, as the majority of studies were assessed as 
being at potentially high risk of bias, this limited the extent to which the objective of this review could 
be achieved.   
Although we performed a thorough search of commercially published literature we did not perform a 
search of sources grey literature such as conference papers or government reports.  As such we 
acknowledge this as a potential source of publication bias within our literature search.     
CONCLUSIONS: 
Corticosteroid injections may have a short-term benefit (up to 8 weeks) over local anaesthetic 
injections alone in the management of RCRSP. However, the certainty of this conclusion is 
challenged due to variations in outcome measures and study design. Beyond 8-weeks, there was no 
evidence to suggest a benefit of corticosteroid over local anaesthetics.
