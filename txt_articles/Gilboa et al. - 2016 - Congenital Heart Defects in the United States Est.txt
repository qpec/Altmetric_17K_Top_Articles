Background: Because of advancements in care, there has been 
a decline in mortality from congenital heart defects (CHDs) over the 
past several decades. However, there are no current empirical data 
documenting the number of people living with CHDs in the United States. 
Our aim was to estimate the CHD prevalence across all age groups in the 
United States in the year 2010.
Methods: The age-, sex-, and severity-specific observed prevalence of 
CHDs in Québec, Canada, in the year 2010 was assumed to equal the 
CHD prevalence in the non-Hispanic white population in the United States 
in 2010. A race-ethnicity adjustment factor, reflecting differential survival 
between racial-ethnic groups through 5 years of age for individuals with a 
CHD and that in the general US population, was applied to the estimated 
non-Hispanic white rates to derive CHD prevalence estimates among US 
non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. Confidence intervals for the estimated 
CHD prevalence rates and case counts were derived from a combination of 
Taylor series approximations and Monte Carlo simulation.
results: We estimated that ≈2.4 million people (1.4 million adults,  
1 million children) were living with CHDs in the United States in 2010. 
Nearly 300 
000 of these individuals had severe CHDs.
conclusions: Our estimates highlight the need for 2 important efforts: 
planning for health services delivery to meet the needs of the growing 
population of adults with CHD and the development of surveillance data 
across the life span to provide empirical estimates of the prevalence of 
CHD across all age groups in the United States.

ongenital heart defects (CHDs) are diagnosed in ≈8 
to 10 per 1000 live births in the United States.1,2 
CHDs are associated with lifelong comorbidity and 
health services use, and the need for repeated surgical in-
terventions3 has resulted in a significant increase in health 
services use during infancy and childhood,4 the transition 
years,5 and adulthood.6 In the United States in 2004, CHDs 
accounted for >46 
000 hospitalizations among individuals 
of all ages and nearly $1.4 billion in hospital costs.7
Advances in medical and surgical treatment have led 
to decreased mortality attributable to CHDs across all 
age groups in the United States.8–11 With lower mortality, 
a demographic shift in the population living with CHDs is 
likely. The most compelling evidence of this demographic 
shift comes from recent analyses of administrative data 
in Québec, Canada. Analyses of these data were the first 
to show time trends in the lifetime CHD prevalence in the 
general population, documenting a 22% increase in the 
number of children and an 85% increase in the number of 
adults living with severe CHDs between the years 1985 
and 2000.12,13 The median age at death among those 
with severe CHDs has reportedly increased from 2 years 
of age in 1987 to 1993 to 23 years of age in 1999 to 
2005.14 Similar demographic trends are expected to ex-
ist in other high-income countries, including the United 
States, but observation of such patterns in the United 
States is challenging in the absence of population-based 
surveillance systems with long-term follow-up or exten-
sively linked administrative data sets.
Two previous publications estimated the size of the 
adult population living with CHDs in the United States in 
the year 2000 on the basis of estimates of birth preva-
lence and survival.15,16 In 2001, a task force of the Amer-
ican College of Cardiology estimated that ≈788 
000 
adults with CHDs (ACHDs) were living in the United States 
in the year 2000.16 In a 2004 analysis, this estimate 
was refined on the basis of survival probabilities con-
sidering either treatment or no treatment, resulting in a 
range from 650 
000 without treatment to 1 
330 
000 with 
treatment.15 In 2009, Marelli and colleagues13 estimated 
that 860 
000 ACHDs were living in the United States in 
the year 2000 on the basis of an extrapolation of the 
prevalence estimates from the year 2000 in Québec. 
Evidence-based planning for health services delivery to 
meet the needs of the growing population of ACHDs in 
the United States will depend on the availability of con-
temporary data on prevalence of CHDs across the life 
span. The goal of the present study was to provide esti-
mates of the prevalence of CHDs across all age groups 
in the United States in the year 2010.
MethODs
Using the recently published estimates of the age-, sex-, and 
severity-specific prevalence of CHDs in Québec, Canada,17 we 
assumed that the Québec CHD prevalence within age and sex 
strata was equal to that in similar strata in the non-Hispanic 
white population in the United States in 2010. We then applied 
a race-ethnicity adjustment factor to derive CHD prevalence 
estimates for the US non-Hispanic black and Hispanic popula-
tions based on the non-Hispanic white estimates. A detailed 
description of the methods, assumptions, and derivation of 
the estimators used in developing the US CHD prevalence esti-
mates is given in the online-only Data Supplement. A complete 
list of assumptions can be found in Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Data inputs
CHD Prevalence in Québec in 2010
Age-, sex-, and severity-specific prevalence of CHDs in Québec 
in 2010 was calculated from the Québec Congenital Heart 
Disease Database with the use of 28 years of longitudinally 
linked administrative data. Detailed methods for the devel-
opment of these estimates have been published.17 Access 
to health care is universal in Québec, and every individual is 
assigned a unique medical record number in the first year 
of life that is used to track all diagnoses and health services 
delivered. These interactions with the healthcare system are 
recorded across several administrative databases, including 
physicians’ services and drug claims, hospital discharges, 
health insurance, and the death registry. The Québec 
Congenital Heart Disease Database was created by linking the 
relevant databases for all Québec patients with at least 1 diag-
nostic or procedural code for a CHD who came into contact 
with the healthcare system in Québec from January 1, 1983, 
to December 31, 2010 (inclusive).17 Diagnostic codes adhered 
to the International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, and 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• There are no current empirical data documenting 
the number of people living with congenital heart 
defects (CHDs) in the United States.
• The aim of this study was to estimate the CHD prev-
alence across all age groups in the United States 
in the year 2010. Using prevalence data from Qué-
bec, Canada, in the year 2010 as a foundation for a 
mathematical model, we estimated that ≈2.4 million 
people (1.4 million adults, 1 million children) were liv-
ing with CHDs in the United States in the year 2010. 
Nearly 300 
000 people had severe CHDs.
• Overall, there was a slight predominance of females 
compared with males.
What are the clinical implications?
• This current estimate of 1.4 million adults with CHDs 
in 2010 corresponds to a 63% increase in the esti-
mated size of the adult population with CHDs since 
the year 2000.
• Resource allocation for health services delivery 
will need to account for this growing population of 
adults with CHDs.

10th Revision (as of 2006). Severe CHDs were defined on 
the basis of these code systems as definitive diagnoses or 
surgical procedures to treat the following CHD types: tetral-
ogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, complete and congenitally 
corrected transposition of the great arteries, atrioventricular 
septal defect, or univentricular hearts.12,17 Severe CHDs and all 
other CHD diagnoses were included in estimates for all CHDs. 
CHD prevalence in Québec in 2010 was calculated as the total 
number of individuals living with CHDs as of midyear per 1000 
population. Children were defined as individuals <18 years of 
age; adults were ≥18 years of age (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
US Population in the Year 2010 and Racial-
Ethnic–Specific CHD Survival and All-Cause 
Mortality
Age-, sex-, and racial-ethnic–specific estimates for the size 
of the US population were derived from the July 1, 2010, US 
Census Bureau intercensal estimates (http://www.census.
gov/popest/data/intercensal/national/files/US-EST00INT-
ALLDATA.pdf).17a Racial-ethnic differences in CHD mortality 
were estimated for children 0 to 5 years of age on the basis 
of published estimates of 5-year survival among non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic children with specific 
CHDs using data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry.18 
The published survival data were aggregated by the authors 
(W.N.N., P.X.) into groupings of all CHDs and severe CHDs to 
correspond to the prevalence data available from Québec. 
Racial-ethnic differences in all-cause mortality for children 0 
to 5 years of age were derived from 1999 to 2014 detailed 
mortality data available from CDC WONDER (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for 
Epidemiological Research)19 (Tables III and IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
statistical analysis
The Figure is a flowchart illustrating the input data and steps 
in the estimation process. As a first step in the estimation 
process, we used the CHD age-, sex-, and severity-specific 
prevalence estimates in Québec in 2010 as estimates for 
the corresponding age-, sex-, and severity CHD prevalence 
in the 2010 among the US non-Hispanic white population. We 
then estimated race-ethnicity adjustment factors that, under 
some simplifying assumptions (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement), correspond to the ratio of CHD prevalence 
among either non-Hispanic blacks to non-Hispanic whites or 
Hispanics to non-Hispanic whites. Therefore, multiplying the 
estimated non-Hispanic white CHD prevalence by the appropri-
ate adjustment factor results in estimate of CHD prevalence 
within the other racial-ethnic populations. A detailed rationale 
for the estimator for the race-ethnicity adjustment factor is 
provided in the online-only Data Supplement; however, the key 
assumptions underlying this approach are that US birth preva-
lence of CHDs does not differ among the racial-ethnic groups 
considered in this analysis and that survival probability within 
racial-ethnic groups among those born with a CHD and the US 
general population differs only though 5 years of age.
We used a combination of Taylor series approximations and 
Monte Carlo simulation, in which the model inputs were repeat-
edly drawn from their assumed sampling distributions, to esti-
mate the sampling variability for the US CHD prevalence and 
case count estimates. Although the US Census–based popula-
tion counts were considered fixed, all other inputs to the model, 
observed prevalence from Québec, mortality among individuals 
with a CHD observed in the Texas Birth Defect Registry, and 
death counts from the detailed mortality file, were considered 
to be subject to sampling variability. Standard errors for these 
inputs were estimated under a Poisson assumption on the num-
ber of CHD cases or number of deaths as appropriate. The

sampling distributions for these inputs were assumed to be 
normal with the mean equal to the observed value and variance 
equal to the square of the estimated standard error. The Monte 
Carlo simulation process was repeated 10 
000 times with 
CHD prevalence and case count estimates for each repetition 
calculated from values for the model inputs drawn from their 
assumed sampling distributions in each iteration. The resulting 
10 
000 calculated values for CHD prevalence and case counts 
were assumed to reflect the sampling variability of the esti-
mators. These generated sampling distributions for US CHD 
prevalence and cases counts are summarized with the mean 
value and 95% confidence intervals defined by the 2.5th and 
97.5th percentiles of the generated values. To reflect the lack 
of certainty in these modeled estimates, all CHD case count 
estimates are rounded to the nearest 1000. A detailed descrip-
tion of the methods used to estimate the sampling error in the 
CHD estimates is provided in the online-only Data Supplement.

Institutional Review Board review.
resUlts
Approximately 2.4 million people were estimated to be 
alive with CHDs in the United States in 2010 (Table 1). 
Approximately 290 
000 of these individuals (12%) had se-
vere CHDs. The prevalence of CHDs ranged from ≈6 per 
1000 in adults to 13 per 1000 in children, although there 
are more adults estimated to be living with CHDs (≈1.4 
million) compared with children (≈1 million). Considering 
differences by race-ethnicity, the prevalence was slightly 
higher in the non-Hispanic white and Hispanic populations 
compared with the non-Hispanic black population. Given 
the relative sizes of the US population, however, the vast 
majority of individuals estimated to be living with CHDs 
in the United States are non-Hispanic white (≈1.7 million) 
compared with non-Hispanic black or Hispanic (≈700 
000).
Overall, there was a slight predominance of females 
to males (Table 2). The most striking difference between 
the sexes was among individuals 25 to 44 years of 
age; women in this age group had a prevalence of 6 
per 1000, whereas men had a prevalence of 3.8 per 
1000, which translated to ≈247 
000 affected women 
and 157 
000 affected men.

There are published estimates of the size of the CHD-
affected population in the United States in the year 
2000.13,15,16 A task force that convened as part of 
the American College of Cardiology’s 32nd Bethesda

and colleagues13 extrapolated that lifetime prevalence 
estimate to the US population in 2000 and estimated 
≈1.7 million affected individuals, evenly divided among 
adults and children.
Importantly, the present study is an extension of the 
2009 Marelli et al17 analysis, using updated 2010 Qué-
bec estimates as input data, and attempts to account 
for racial-ethnic differences in survival in the United 
States. Analyses of cross-sectional US death certificate 
data have shown that age-adjusted mortality resulting 
from CHDs is greater for non-Hispanic blacks than non-
Hispanic whites and that decreases in mortality resulting 
from CHDs have been greatest for non-Hispanic whites 
compared with other racial-ethnic groups in the United 
States.9 In addition, survival analyses of population-
based birth defects surveillance data have shown that 
mortality at 0 to 5 years of age among non-Hispanic 
black and Hispanic infants born with CHDs is generally 
higher than among non-Hispanic whites, although there 
are differences among CHD subtypes.11,18 The reasons 
for higher mortality among those 0 to 5 years of age 
born with a CHDs in minority populations are not well 
understood. Although differential access to health care 
among minority populations has frequently been a pro-
posed explanation, it is likely not the only explanation. 
For example, there are persistent racial-ethnic differ-
ences in postoperative mortality after CHD surgery that 
do not seem to be explained by differences in access to 
care.21 Nembhard and colleagues18 have hypothesized 
that other factors such as the severity of the defect, 
use of home care both before and after surgery, and 
differences in the frequency and severity of comorbid 
conditions such as asthma could be responsible for 
racial-ethnic differences in mortality among those 0 to 
5 years of age with CHDs. Previous reports of the size 
of the population living with CHDs have not attempted to 
account for these recognized, but largely unexplained, 
differences in child survival.
Conceptually, the lifetime prevalence of CHDs in a 
closed population (ie, no migration) or in a population 
with zero net migration is the product of the birth preva-
lence and survival. The estimated birth prevalence of 
CHDs in the United States is ≈8 to 10 per 1000 live 
births1,2 and has increased over the past 30 to 40 years, 
driven largely by increasing prevalence and improved 
detection of less severe phenotypes such as ventricu-
lar and atrial septal defects.22,23 Survival, however, has 
also increased because of advancements in medical and 
surgical care. According to US death certificate data, 
age-adjusted annual infant mortality resulting from CHDs 
decreased 40% between 1979 and 19938 and contin-
ued to decrease through the mid-2000s,9 although death 
resulting from CHDs still remains the most common 
cause of infant mortality from birth defects in the United 
States.24 In addition, according to death certificates, 
overall mortality decreased 40% in people with tetral-
ogy of Fallot and 60% in those with ventricular septal 
defect between 1980 and 2005.25 Similarly, in the Qué-
bec CHD database, among >8000 patients with severe 
CHDs followed up for >1 million life-years, the median 
age of death increased from 2 years of age in 1987 to 
1993 to 23 years of age in 1999 to 2005.14 The authors 
concluded that mortality from CHDs has changed from 
a bimodal distribution of death to a distribution skewed 
toward the elderly, matching that of the population un-
affected by CHDs.14 Finally, with respect to sex, it has 
been observed that among adults 18 to 45 years of age 
with CHDs, women had lower in-hospital mortality than 
men, independently of pregnancy history.26
Despite the fact that most patients with CHDs require 
lifelong cardiology care,27 data from a recent study indi-
cated that >40% of individuals with CHDs reported a gap 
of at least 3 years in such care28 with the late teens being 
the most common age of the first gap. This corresponds 
to the typical time of transition from pediatric- to adult-
oriented medical care during which pediatric patients 
can be lost to follow-up and fail to undergo a successful 
transition.28,29 A long lapse in medical care may result in 
adverse outcomes because ACHDs must be monitored 
frequently for the development of complications from 
their structural heart defects such as arrhythmias and 
pulmonary hypertension.29,30 As of 2010, the consensus 
among the ACHD community was that the ACHD clin-
ics in the United States at that time were inadequate 
to meet the needs of this population.29 The treatment 
recommendation from the 32nd Bethesda Conference 
was that adults with moderate or complex CHDs should 
be followed up in a regional ACHD center at least once 
or twice each year.16 On the basis of the 2009 estimate 
of nearly 860 
000 ACHDs in the United States in the year 
2000 and assuming that 50% of them were seen at least 
once each year in an ACHD regional center, it was esti-
mated that 150 large regional centers would be required 
to care for the ACHD population in the United States.13 
If the current estimate of 1.4 million ACHDs in 2010 is 
considered, it represents a 63% increase in the estimat-
ed size of the adult population with CHDs in the United 
States since 2000. It is conceivable that >200 ACHD 
regional centers will be required to meet the needs of 
this rapidly growing population. According to the Adult 
Congenital Heart Association, there are currently 114 
ACHD regional centers in the United States (http://www.
achaheart.org/home/clinic-directory.aspx).30a
The study findings presented here must be interpret-
ed in light of several potential methodological limita-
tions. First, the Canadian input prevalence data were 
derived from administrative data in which CHDs were 
identified via International Classification of Disease, 9th 
Revision, coding; cases identified in this fashion are 
more subject to misclassification than those actively 
ascertained through medical records review.10 How-
ever, to minimize the possibility of misclassification

resulting from the use of administrative data, Marelli 
and colleagues12 developed extensive algorithms to ex-
clude individuals who seemed to have miscoded CHDs 
and manually reviewed ≈28% of their original data set 
(17 
474 of 61 
386) to validate the categorization of 
the algorithm. In addition, the input data for the pres-
ent analysis17 reassuringly had a CHD birth prevalence 
comparable to those reported from active birth defects 
surveillance systems.2 An advantage of using input 
data derived from inpatient hospitalization and outpa-
tient records across the life span is that individuals with 
CHDs who were clinically diagnosed at any age were 
included in the data set, and diagnosis at birth (which 
can be missed, depending on the CHD subtype) was 
not required for inclusion. Second, given that individu-
als who neither represent a visible racial-ethnic minority 
nor consider themselves Aboriginal represent 89% of 
the Québec population according to the 2011 Canadian 
National Household Survey,31 the calculated age-, sex-, 
and severity-specific prevalences for 2010 in Québec 
were assumed to be equivalent to that of the US non-
Hispanic white population for the same time period. We 
assumed that there were no differences in either birth 
prevalence or survival between the Québec population 
and the US non-Hispanic white population with CHDs. 
Any differences in environmental or genetic risk factors 
or healthcare provision between Canada and the United 
States were assumed to have no impact on prevalence 
or survival. Third, for individuals ≥6 years of age, we 
assumed that the impact of mortality caused by CHDs 
was the same across all age groups. For children 0 
to 5 years of age, we approximated CHD racial-ethnic 
prevalence ratios using their corresponding ratios of 
cumulative survival with CHDs, thereby assuming no 
racial-ethnic differences in CHD prevalence at birth. 
Given that racial-ethnic differences in CHD prevalence 
in the United States are inconsistent across CHD sub-
types and eras,22,23,32 accounting for differences in 
birth prevalence across racial-ethnic groups was not 
feasible in this study. Other nuances of differential sur-
vival by race-ethnicity could not be modeled. For ex-
ample, recently published data from California pediatric 
cardiology specialty care centers indicated substantial 
differences in hospital discharges among Hispanics 
and non-Hispanic whites over a 28-year period.33 From 
1983 to 2011, the percent of discharges identified as 
non-Hispanic white decreased from 58% to 30%; in the 
same time period, the percent identified as Hispanic 
rose from 24% to 48%. This demographic shift, spe-
cific to California, might be attributable to underlying 
population growth, immigration, or changing access to 
health care.
Despite these limitations, this is the first report to pro-
vide a contemporary estimate of the number of people 
living with CHDs in the United States stratified by age, 
sex, race-ethnicity, and CHD severity. Compared with 
population estimates generated for the year 2000,13 the 
current estimates for the year 2010 represent a 40% in-
crease in the total number of individuals living with CHDs 
in the United States and a >60% increase in the size of 
the adult population alone. Results from this analysis 
can help inform 2 efforts critical to this emergent public 
health issue: planning for health services delivery to meet 
the needs of the growing population of ACHDs and the 
development of surveillance data across the life span to 
provide more accurate, empirical estimates of the preva-
lence of CHDs across all age groups in the United States.
