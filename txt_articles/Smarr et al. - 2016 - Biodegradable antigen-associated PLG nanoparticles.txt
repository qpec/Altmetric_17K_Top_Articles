Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the most widely used treatment
for allergic diseases that directly targets the T helper 2 (Th2) bias
underlying allergy. However, the most widespread clinical appli-
cations of SIT require a long period of dose escalation with soluble
antigen (Ag) and carry a significant risk of adverse reactions,
particularly in highly sensitized patients who stand to benefit most
from a curative treatment. Thus, the development of safer, more
efficient methods to induce Ag-specific immune tolerance is critical
to advancing allergy treatment. We hypothesized that antigen-
associated nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), which we have used to prevent
and treat Th1/Th17-mediated autoimmune disease, would also be
effective for the induction of tolerance in a murine model of Th2-
mediated ovalbumin/alum-induced allergic airway inflammation.
We demonstrate here that antigen-conjugated polystyrene (Ag-PS)
NPs, although effective for the prophylactic induction of tolerance,
induce anaphylaxis in presensitized mice. Antigen-conjugated NPs
made of biodegradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (Ag-PLG) are simi-
larly effective prophylactically, are well tolerated by sensitized an-
imals, but only partially inhibit Th2 responses when administered
therapeutically. PLG NPs containing encapsulated antigen [PLG(Ag)],
however, were well tolerated and effectively inhibited Th2 re-
sponses and airway inflammation both prophylactically and ther-
apeutically. Thus, we illustrate progression toward PLG(Ag) as a
biodegradable Ag carrier platform for the safe and effective
inhibition of allergic airway inflammation without the need for
nonspecific immunosuppression in animals with established Th2
sensitization.

llergic diseases are a growing health concern in developed
countries. T helper 2 (Th2) cells are central to the allergic
response, producing cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, to
act directly and indirectly on a variety of cells, including B cells,
eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and epithelial cells, inducing
inflammation and further propagating the allergic cascade (1).
The primary clinical approaches to allergy consist of antigen
(Ag) avoidance and symptom control by targeting acute effector
molecules with drugs, such as antihistamines, leukotriene inhibi-
tors, or broad-acting glucocorticoids. However, such treatments
fail to address the underlying Th2 bias driving allergic in-
flammation. Specific immunotherapy (SIT), however, has a long
history of treating allergies by inhibiting Th2 responses. Typically
consisting of gradually escalating doses of soluble Ag delivered
mucosally or s.c., SIT has been demonstrated to induce both
regulatory and Th1 responses that compete with established Th2
responses (2). However, administration of soluble Ag to sensitized
patients bears a considerable risk of adverse reactions, thereby
necessitating slow dose escalation or coadministration of therapies
that minimize anaphylaxis, such as omalizumab (3). Therefore,
improved methods to induce Ag-specific tolerance safely and
effectively remain a sought-after clinical tool for the treatment of
allergic disease in presensitized subjects.
We previously demonstrated the ability of i.v.-administered Ag-
conjugated apoptotic splenocytes (Ag-SPs) to induce protective tol-
erance for the prevention and treatment of established Th2 responses
in murine models of allergic airway inflammation and food allergy
(4). Ag-SPs induce tolerance in a variety of immune disorders, and
Ag-conjugated autologous leukocytes have shown initial promise in
clinical trials of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (5). However,
the need for autologous cells to be isolated and manipulated before
each treatment limits the broad clinical application of such a
treatment. Therefore, the development of shelf-stable, tolerance-
inducing Ag carriers made under good manufacturing practices
(GMP) represents the next generation of Ag-specific medicine. To
this end, we have identified nanoparticle (NP) formulations for the
induction of tolerance to prevent and treat Th1/Th17-mediated
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (6, 7).
Here, we describe the experimental progression toward the
development of synthetic NPs, including antigen-conjugated poly-
styrene (Ag-PS), antigen-conjugated biodegradable poly(lactide-co-
glycolide) (Ag-PLG), and antigen-encapsulated poly(lactide-co-
glycolide) [PLG(Ag)] particle carriers for the delivery of Ag for the
safe and effective treatment of Th2-mediated allergic airway
inflammation. Prophylactic treatment with formulations of Ag-PS,
Ag-PLG, and PLG(Ag) all effectively inhibited Th2 sensitization
and subsequent airway inflammation. Ag-PS induced anaphylaxis
in presensitized animals, whereas Ag-PLG and PLG(Ag) were
Significance
Allergic diseases are characterized by inappropriate inflamma-
tory responses to benign environmental antigens (Ags). Primary
clinical approaches to allergic disease consist of symptom control
or administration of soluble Ag to skew the immune response to
alternate phenotypes or induce immune tolerance. However,
such approaches carry a significant risk of adverse events and
require a long treatment course to achieve efficacy. In this paper,
we describe the use of i.v.-administered nanoparticles as carriers
of whole-protein Ag to induce tolerance safely and effectively in
the absence of nonspecific immunosuppression for the pre-
vention and treatment of a mouse model of allergic asthma.

 well tolerated. Ag-PLG partially inhibited preexisting Th2 responses
but did not inhibit airway inflammation. Importantly, PLG(Ag) NPs
inhibited both Th2 responses and airway eosinophilia in pre-
sensitized mice and were not recognized by Ag-specific Ab.
These studies illustrate the potential clinical development of a
safe, biodegradable platform for tolerogenic Ag delivery for ef-
fective abrogation of established Ag-specific Th2 responses and
inhibition of allergic airway inflammation.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice (Taconic Farms) were maintained
in specific pathogen free conditions at Northwestern University Center for
Comparative Medicine. All protocols were approved by the Northwestern
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Particle Preparation. PLG with carboxylate end groups (50:50 D,L-lactide/glycolide,
inherent viscosity = 0.18 dL/g) was purchased from Durect Corporation. PS
particles (Fluoresbrite Brilliant Blue carboxylate) were purchased from Poly-
sciences, Inc. PLG particles with surface carboxylate groups and a negative
ζ-potential were prepared using a single-emulsion/solvent evaporation method
as previously described (7). Particles were lyophilized and stored for future use.
PLG(Ag) NPs were prepared using a double-emulsion/solvent evaporation
method. Briefly, 150 μL of 200 mg/mL aqueous Ag was added to 2 mL of
20% (wt/vol) PLG in dichloromethane and emulsified by sonication. The poly
(ethylene-alt-maleic acid) (PEMA) solution [10 mL of 1% (wt/vol) aqueous
PEMA] was added to the emulsion and reemulsified by sonication. The
emulsion was then poured into 200 mL of 0.5% (wt/vol) aqueous PEMA
under stirring. The particles were purified, lyophilized, and stored for future
use. Before use in vivo, the particles were rehydrated and washed three times
with sterile PBS. The Ag dose of washed particles was determined as pre-
viously described by dissolving particles in DMSO before 3-(4-carboxybenzoyl)
quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde) (CQBCA) analysis (8). NP size and ζ-potential in
PBS were measured using dynamic light scattering on a Zetasizer Nano ZS
(Malvern Instruments).
Ag Conjugation to PLG and PS NPs. Ag was surface-conjugated to PLG or PS
particles through surface carboxylates as previously described (8). Lyophilized
particles were rehydrated and washed three times with PBS. Peptides were then
incubated with particles and 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
(ECDI) at final concentrations of 50 mg/mL at 25 °C for 1 h. After conjugation,
the particles were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min (PLG) or 16,100 × g for
10 min (PS) and washed three times with PBS before injection or further
analysis. Ag dose and ζ-potential in PBS were measured as described above.
Allergic Airway Inflammation Model. Mice were immunized i.p. with two doses
of 10 μg of ovalbumin (OVA; grade V; Sigma–Aldrich) in alum (3 mg) or alum
and PBS alone. Mice were challenged for 20 min with aerosolized OVA
(10 mg/mL) for three consecutive days before tissue harvest.
Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Eosinophils. Lungs were flushed with 1 mL
of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF; 1 mM EDTA and 10% (vol/vol) FBS in
PBS]. Total cell counts were determined, and samples were cytospun onto
slides and stained with DiffQuik (Siemens) for differential cell counts.
Airway Histology. Lungs were collected, fixed in formalin, embedded in
paraffin, and stained with H&E or periodic acid–Schiff. Images are shown at a
magnification of 200×.
OVA-Specific IgE. Serum was collected upon sacrifice, and OVA-specific IgE
(OVA-IgE) was quantified by sandwich ELISA. Anti-mouse IgE (BD Biosciences)
was used as the capture Ab, and biotinylated OVA (prepared using an EZ-Link
Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit from Pierce) was used as a secondary reagent. The
quantity of OVA-IgE was determined by a standard curve generated using
purified mouse OVA-IgE from the TOe hybridoma.
Ag-Specific Recall Responses. Spleens and mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) were
harvested, processed into RBC-free single-cell suspensions, an incubated with
25 μg/mL OVA in serum-free HL-1 culture medium at 37 °C for 48 h, and
pulsed with 1 μCi of tritiated thymidine ([3H]TdR) per well for the last 24 h of
culture. Proliferation was determined by [3H]TdR incorporation as detected
by a Topcount Microplate Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer).
Cytokine Quantification. BALF and supernatants from recall response cultures
(harvested at 48 h) were assayed for IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ by
magnetic Milliplex MAP multiplex assay (Millipore).
Temperature Measurements. Temperature was measured for 1 h after treatment
using either s.c.-implanted temperature transponders (BioMedic Data Systems)
or a rectally inserted temperature probe attached to an Oakton Temp-10 type
K thermocouple thermometer.
OVA-Ig Binding in Vitro. Fifty micrograms of particles was incubated with 1 μg/mL
OVA-IgE or 10 μg/mL OVA-IgG1 (Sigma–Aldrich) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and
incubated with 2.5 μg/mL biotinylated anti-IgE (BioLegend) or biotinylated
anti-IgG1 (BD Biosciences), followed by washing and incubation with 2.5 μg/mL
streptavidin-FITC (eBioscience). After a final wash, fluorescence was measured
on a BD FACSCanto (BD Biosciences).
Statistics. Statistics were performed on GraphPad Prism 5 software using a
Student t test or one-way ANOVA.
Results
Ag-Linked PS NPs Prevent Induction of Allergic Airway Inflammation.
We previously demonstrated that Ag-SPs induce protective tol-
erance for the prevention and treatment of established Th2 re-
sponses in murine models of allergic airway inflammation and
food allergy (4). Ag-SPs administered i.v. rapidly undergo apo-
ptosis (9) and localize to the splenic marginal zone, where they
induce the up-regulation of IL-10 and coinhibitory molecules
by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (10). Ag-PS NPs have been
identified as surrogates mimicking many of the properties and
mechanisms of Ag-SPs for the induction of tolerance to prevent
and treat Th1/Th17-driven EAE (6). These particles are most
effective at diameters of ∼500 nm and are decorated on the sur-
face with carboxyl groups to facilitate the attachment of Ag by
peptide bond formation induced by the chemical cross-linker
ECDI and to facilitate tolerogenic uptake by the macrophage
receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) scavenger re-
ceptor (6). We therefore sought to determine the efficacy of Ag-
PS for the modulation of Th2-driven allergic airway inflammation.
PS particles had a diameter of 532.4 ± 4.96 nm. Measurement
of protein coupling showed 0.50 ± 0.12 nmol of OVA was at-
tached per dose of OVA-PS NPs, which had a ζ-potential of −17.3 ±
0.5 mV (Table S1).
Similar to prior studies with Ag-SP (4), we administered Ag-
PS i.v. 1 wk before each of two i.p. immunizations with OVA in
alum adjuvant followed by airway challenge with aerosolized
OVA. Similar to tolerance induced by OVA-SP, OVA-PS inhibited
production of OVA-IgE compared with control lysozyme-PS par-
ticles or no particle treatment (Fig. S1A). Additionally, OVA-PS
inhibited airway inflammation as measured by eosinophil in-
filtration in BALF (Fig. S1B) and corroborated by airway histology
(Fig. S1C). Analysis of BALF cytokines showed significant in-
hibition of the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10
without the induction of IFN-γ or IL-17 associated with skewing to
Th1 or Th17 phenotypes (Fig. S1D). OVA restimulation of cells
from mediastinal LN further demonstrated the tolerization of
OVA-specific Th2 cells. Cells from OVA-PS recipients exhibited
significantly reduced proliferation (Fig. S1E) and Th2 cytokine
production (Fig. S1F) following ex vivo OVA restimulation. To-
gether, these data indicate that Ag-PS NPs are effective Ag carriers
for the prophylactic inhibition of Th2 responses.
Ag-Linked Biodegradable PLG NPs Prevent Induction of Allergic
Airway Inflammation. Despite the successful tolerance induced
by Ag-PS particles in allergic airway inflammation and other
models, the nonbiodegradable nature of PS renders it unap-
pealing for clinical use. Our recent studies have identified NPs
composed of PLG as a biodegradable alternative to PS effective
for the prevention and treatment of EAE (6, 7). The PLG par-
ticles had diameters of 543.8 ± 14.82 nm and a carboxylated
surface to facilitate peptide bond formation by ECDI chemistry
for the attachment of Ag and tolerogenic uptake by APCs. Due to
carboxylation, the ζ-potential of the particles was −55.2 ± 3.8 mV.

 Measurement of protein conjugated to OVA-PLG particles
showed 0.13 ± 0.06 nmol of OVA was attached per dose with a
postcoupling ζ-potential of −11.5 ± 0.2 mV (Table S1). To de-
termine the prophylactic potential of these particles in allergic
airway inflammation, Ag-PLG was administered 1 wk before each
of two immunizations with OVA in alum adjuvant, followed by
airway challenge with aerosolized OVA. OVA-PLG significantly
inhibited production of OVA-IgE compared with control myelin
basic protein (MBP)-PLG particles (Fig. 1A). Additionally, OVA-
PLG significantly inhibited airway inflammation as measured by
BALF eosinophilia (Fig. 1B), which was further borne out by
airway histology (Fig. 1C). Analysis of BALF cytokines showed
significant inhibition of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 without in-
duction of IFN-γ or IL-17 (Fig. 1D). OVA restimulation of me-
diastinal LN cells further demonstrated the tolerization of OVA-
specific Th2 cells. Cells from OVA-PLG recipients exhibited
trends, albeit nonsignificant, toward reduced proliferation (Fig.
S2A) and significant reduction of Th2 cytokine production (Fig.
S2B) in response to OVA restimulation. Together, these data
indicate that Ag-PLG NPs are effective Ag carriers for the pro-
phylactic inhibition of allergic airway inflammation.
Ag-Linked PS NPs Induce Anaphylactic Temperature Drop in
Presensitized Mice. Given the striking inhibition of Th2 responses
by prophylactic treatment with Ag-PS, we tested whether Ag-PS
would be a viable Ag carrier for therapeutic tolerance. Ag-PS had
previously been shown to treat ongoing EAE by inhibiting re-
sponses to spread epitopes (6). We opted to replicate the two-dose
tolerance regimen that was effective for therapeutic inhibition of
Th2 responses with Ag-SP (4). However, our first execution of this
protocol resulted in significant adverse reactions in OVA/alum-
sensitized OVA-PS recipients, including labored breathing and loss
of mobility, resulting in the deaths of three of five mice following
the second dose of OVA-PS. Given these reactions in Th2-sensi-
tized animals, we hypothesized that Ag presented on OVA-PS–
induced an anaphylactic response. Indeed, OVA-PS–treated mice
exhibited a significant reduction in body temperature compared
with control MBP-PS–treated animals (Fig. S3A). This reaction
may be due to recognition of OVA on the particle surface by
OVA-IgE, which significantly bound OVA-PS particles in vitro, as
did OVA-IgG1 (Fig. S3 D and E). This anaphylactic response, in
conjunction with the nonbiodegradable nature of PS, contra-
indicated Ag-PS for further development as a therapeutic treatment.
Ag-Linked Biodegradable NPs Are Nonanaphylactic and Inhibit Th2
Responses but Not Airway Inflammation in Presensitized Mice. We
next sought to determine the safety profile of OVA-PLG in
presensitized mice. Like OVA-PS, OVA-PLG was significantly
bound by OVA-IgE and OVA-IgG1 in vitro, although signifi-
cantly more OVA-IgG1 was bound to OVA-PLG than to OVA-
PS (Fig. S3 D and E). However, unlike OVA-PS–treated mice,
animals treated with OVA-PLG exhibited no adverse reactions or
temperature drop following particle administration (Fig. S3B).
Having identified OVA-PLG as safe to administer to pre-
sensitized recipients, we next determined its ability to inhibit
established Th2 responses. Following the second dose of OVA-
PLG, mice were challenged with aerosolized OVA to induce
airway inflammation. Similar to results seen with OVA-SP (4),
OVA-PLG significantly enhanced OVA-IgE production com-
pared with controls (Fig. 2A). OVA-PLG had no effect on airway
eosinophilia (Fig. 2B), although analysis of BALF cytokines
showed reduced levels of Th2-associated cytokines in OVA-
PLG–treated mice compared with lysozyme-PLG controls (Fig.
2C). Ex vivo restimulation of LN cells from OVA-PLG recipients
demonstrated a significant reduction in proliferation (Fig. 2D).
However, a significant reduction in Th2 cytokines was not ob-
served in these recall cultures (Fig. 2E). Altogether, these data
show a partial reduction of established Th2 responses by OVA-
PLG, but no significant reduction in allergic airway inflammation.
Ag-Encapsulated Biodegradable NPs Are Nonanaphylactic and Inhibit
Both Th2 Responses and Airway Inflammation in Mice treated Pre- or
Postsensitization. To be clinically feasible for the treatment of
allergic disease, tolerogenic Ag carriers must be both well tol-
erated and efficacious in subjects with established Th2 sensiti-
zation. With these criteria, the data presented thus far rule out
covalently linked Ag-PS and Ag-PLG at these doses as unsafe
and ineffective, respectively, for the treatment of established Th2
responses. However, our group has recently investigated the use
of PLG(Ag). PLG(Ag) allows for the potential delivery of larger
amounts of Ag while retaining a free particle surface for further
modification. Such particles are effective for the treatment of a
variety of immune disorders, including EAE and allograft re-
jection, and can be prepared and lyophilized in advance to min-
imize end-user manipulation (11). PLG(Ag) had a diameter of
703.5 ± 84.28 nm. PLG(OVA) particles had a ζ-potential of −41.9 ±
12.9 mV and were loaded with 1.18 ± 0.81 nmol of OVA per
dose (Table S1). Ag release studies demonstrated a slow release of
Fig. 1.

OVA-PLG or control MBP-PLG on days −7 and +7 relative to i.p. immunization with 10 μg of OVA in 3 mg of alum or alum alone on days 0 and +14 before aerosol

 OVA from PLG(OVA) particles in PBS over the course of 5 d
(Fig. S4). Similar to OVA-PS and OVA-PLG, prophylactic
treatment with PLG(OVA) significantly inhibited allergic sensiti-
zation as measured by serum OVA-IgE, airway inflammation, and
Th2 recall responses (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). Treatment of OVA/
alum-sensitized mice with PLG(OVA) induced no observed
adverse reactions and no change in core body temperature (Fig.
S3C). Unlike the case with Ag-coupled particles, neither OVA-
IgE nor OVA-IgG1 bound PLG(OVA) in vitro (Fig. S3 D and
E). As with other OVA carriers, postsensitization PLG(OVA)
treatment significantly increased production of OVA-IgE com-
pared with controls (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, however, PLG(OVA)
treatment significantly decreased inflammatory airway eosino-
philia (Fig. 4 B and C). This reduction in airway inflammation was
associated with significant inhibition of Th2 cytokines in the BALF
of PLG(OVA) recipients without concurrent induction of IFN-γ
or IL-17 (Fig. 4D). Restimulation of mediastinal LNs with OVA
similarly demonstrated a significant reduction in proliferation and
Th2 cytokines in PLG(OVA) recipients (Fig. 4 E and F).
Discussion
We previously demonstrated the ability of i.v.-administered Ag-
SP to induce tolerance in models of autoimmunity, transplant,
and allergy (4, 10, 12). Ag-SP uses natural tolerogenic pathways,
targeting apoptotic cells to the splenic marginal zone via scavenger
receptor-mediated uptake, resulting in induction of IL-10 and PD-
L1 on APCs and, ultimately, T-cell anergy and regulatory T-cell
(Treg) activation (10). The use of Ag-coupled leukocytes in

Smarr et al.
 patients with MS appears promising (5), but complexities associ-
ated with leukocyte manipulation led us to test alternative Ag
carriers for the promotion of tolerance. Ag-PS and biodegradable
Ag-PLG NPs have been identified as suitable Ag carriers for the
induction of tolerance in EAE (6, 7). To our knowledge, this report
is the first report of i.v.-administered Ag-PS, Ag-PLG, and PLG(Ag)
NPs for the induction of tolerance in a Th2-mediated allergy model.
Ag-PS particles induced effective tolerance for the prevention
of Th2 sensitization, but induced a profound anaphylactic tem-
perature drop in Ag-sensitized animals. This reaction was un-
expected because Ag-SPs were well tolerated when administered
to animals with significant Ag-specific IgE on board (4, 13).
Moreover, the process of ECDI coupling Ag to carboxylated NPs,
similar to allergoid generation by aldehyde fixation, was expected
to obscure conformational epitopes recognized by Fce receptor
(FceR)-bound OVA-IgE (14). OVA-PS and OVA-PLG were
bound by OVA-specific IgE and IgG1, which both can mediate
anaphylaxis via cross-linking of FceRI and FcγRIII, respectively
(15), but only OVA-PS induced anaphylaxis in presensitized mice.
Binding of mAbs in vitro is nonphysiological and difficult to cor-
relate directly to in vivo cross-linking of FcR. The lack of ana-
phylaxis in response to OVA-PLG may be due to increased
binding of OVA-IgG1 to OVA-PLG vs. OVA-PS particles be-
cause IgG1 binding to low-dose Ag can inhibit anaphylaxis by
cross-linking inhibitory FcγRIIb and inhibiting IgE binding (15).
Ag-PLG effectively inhibited Th2 sensitization, but only par-
tially inhibited established Th2 responses and did not inhibit
airway eosinophilia. Eosinophilia despite reduced airway IL-5
may be due to the lack of reduction in LN-derived IL-5 because
peripheral, but not airway-specific, expression of IL-5 has been
demonstrated to be required for the induction of airway eosin-
ophilia (16). A similar phenotype was seen with postsensitization
treatment with Ag-SP, in which airway Th2 cytokines were
inhibited but Ag-specific IgE and airway eosinophilia were ex-
acerbated (4). Interestingly, postsensitization treatment with
PLG(Ag) significantly inhibited both Th2 responses and airway
inflammation. Because PLG(OVA) particles carry more OVA
per dose than OVA-PLG particles, we hypothesize that improved
Ag loading, resulting in increased Ag dosage, is important to the
therapeutic efficacy of PLG(Ag), which will be optimized to de-
termine minimal effective Ag dose in future studies. Considerable
variability in loading can be observed from batch-to-batch pro-
duction of PLG(Ag), and the in vivo studies were performed with
a minimal loading of 0.79 ± 0.05 nmol of OVA per dose. En-
hanced efficacy could also be related to the more negatively
charged surface of PLG(OVA) vs. Ag-PLG. Highly charged par-
ticles are rapidly opsonized by serum proteins upon injection, fa-
cilitating APC uptake and Ag delivery, although the opsonizing
protein corona varies depending on the charge polarity (17). We
reported that, independent of opsonization, particle uptake via
scavenger receptors, such as MARCO, occurs in a charge-
dependent fashion (6, 18). As demonstrated in Table S1, a con-
founding factor in conjugating different Ags to particles is the
variable surface charge imparted by those Ags. This variation
presents a caveat in the use of control Ags, such as lysozyme,
that result in more neutrally charged particles. Additionally,
different Ags would be expected to have distinct release kinetics
from PLG(Ag) in solution, with factors such as Ag size, charge,
and hydrophobicity affecting the release rate (19). Differential

Treatment of presensitized mice with PLG(OVA) inhibits Th2-induced airway inflammation. Female BALB/c mice (n = 5) were treated i.v. with 2.5 mg
PLG(OVA) or control PLG(LYS) on days +28 and +42 relative to i.p. immunization with 10 μg of OVA in 3 mg of alum or alum alone on days 0 and +14 before
aerosol challenge with 10 mg/mL OVA for 20 min on days +56–58 and sample collection on day +59. (A) Concentration of serum OVA-IgE was determined by
sandwich ELISA. (B) Lungs were flushed with BALF, total cell counts were determined, and samples were cytospun onto slides before DiffQuik staining for
differential cell counts of BAL eosinophils. (C) Lungs were fixed in formalin and stained with periodic acid–Schiff. (D) Cytokines from BALF supernatant were
analyzed by Milliplex. (E) Mediastinal LNs were harvested and cultured with 25 μg/mL OVA. At 48 h, cells were pulsed with [3H]TdR for the final 24 h of
culture. (F) Before [3H]TdR pulsing, supernatant from LN cultures was reserved and cytokines were analyzed by Milliplex. Results are mean ± SEM of three
separate experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005; ***P < 0.001.

 vs. PLG(OVA) may explain the differences in postsensitization
efficacy between OVA-PLG and PLG(OVA) (i.e., binding of
OVA-specific Abs to OVA-PLG may target particles to non-
tolerogenic uptake pathways).
Similar to Ag-SP (4), both Ag-PLG and PLG(Ag) induce in-
creased Ag-specific IgE when administered to presensitized an-
imals, perhaps because memory B cells respond to Ag encounter
with increased production of Ag-specific Ig, in the absence of
T-cell help (20). Oral SIT therapy resulted in increased Ag-
specific IgE for months following treatment, returning to base-
line levels only at 12 mo (21). It is unknown whether the IgE
induced by antigen-associated nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) will simi-
larly decrease over time, and therapeutic use of Ag-NP tolerance
via targeting of allergen-specific Th2 cells may have to be used in
combination with anti-IgE. Indeed, clinical use of SIT combined
with omalizumab (IgE-specific IgG1) was safer and more effica-
cious than SIT alone (3).
The precise mechanisms by which Ag-NPs mediate tolerance
have yet to be elucidated. Ag-SPs act by a variety of mechanisms,
including induction of IL-10 and inhibitory molecules, such as
PD-L1 and CTLA-4 on splenic marginal zone APCs, leading to
anergy, depletion of Ag-specific T cells, and induction of Ag-
specific Tregs (10, 22). Ag-PS infused i.v. localizes to the splenic
marginal zone, inducing T-cell anergy and disease protection in
the Th1/Th17-mediated EAE model of MS in an IL-10/Treg-
dependent fashion (6). This effect is size-dependent, because
500-nm particles are more effective than smaller or larger parti-
cles. Five hundred-nanometer Ag-PLG particles protect from
EAE (7), and i.v.-infused PLG(Ag) associates with APCs in the
spleen and liver, inducing up-regulation of PD-L1 and establishing
PD-1–dependent tolerance to prevent and treat EAE.
Other studies have used PLG(Ag) to modulate allergic re-
sponses. Given orally, s.c., or i.p., PLG(Ag) inhibits Ag-specific IgE
and hypersensitivity reactions marked by skewing toward Th1 re-
sponses (23, 24), which inhibit Th2 responses (2). Indeed, s.c. ad-
ministration of Ag-SP and Ag-PLG is also immunogenic, enhancing
Th1/Th17-mediated responses in EAE, as opposed to the tolero-
genic response achieved with i.v. delivery (7, 10). Ag-NPs inhibit
Th2 responses without Th1/Th17 skewing because i.v. injection of
PLG(Ag) induces protective and therapeutic tolerance in Th1/
Th17-mediated EAE models and transplant rejection (11). We
posit that abrogation of immune responses as induced by PLG(Ag)
is preferable to the induction of a competitive inflammatory
phenotype and represents a “true” state of tolerance. A recent
report demonstrated that i.v. or s.c. administration of PLG(Ag)
containing rapamycin induces tolerance in models of autoim-
munity and allergic hypersensitivity (25). Upon s.c. administra-
tion, the rapamycin particles localized to draining LNs, whereas
our i.v.-administered PLG(Ag) particles localize with APCs in
the liver and splenic marginal zone. Similar to i.v. PLG(Ag),
rapamycin-bearing particles induced tolerance both pre- and
postsensitization, but unlike PLG(Ag) in our study, post-
sensitization treatment did not induce production of Ag-specific
IgE. Without rapamycin, these particles were immunogenic, in-
dicating a fundamental difference in the mechanism of action
from the 500-nm particles used in our studies, perhaps due to
their smaller size or differences in surface charge leading to the
targeting of different APCs or uptake pathways. In our PLG(Ag)
platform, i.v. administration directing Ag toward more naturally
tolerogenic APCs in the liver and splenic marginal zone targeting
is crucial, whereas s.c. administration targets Ag to immunoge-
nic, Th1-promoting microenvironments (6, 10).
Our data indicate biodegradable PLG(Ag) induces effective
tolerance in a safe manner for the treatment of established Th2
responses in a model of allergic airway inflammation. Ag-NPs
represent an evolution from Ag-SPs toward a more convenient,
standardizable Ag carrier that can be efficiently manufactured
under GMP conditions. Ag-PS is an effective Ag carrier for the
induction of prophylactic tolerance, but it is nonbiodegradable
and presents Ag to sensitized cells in an anaphylactic manner.
Biodegradable Ag-PLG is similarly effective prophylactically but
only partially inhibits established Th2 responses. PLG(Ag) is also
capable of being loaded with multiple Ags or drugs while leaving
the particle surface available for the attachment of additional
immunomodulatory or targeting molecules. Relevant to clinical
application, i.v. PLG(Ag) is well tolerated in sensitized mice,
inhibiting established Th2 responses and airway eosinophilia
without skewing toward Th1 or Th17 phenotypes.
