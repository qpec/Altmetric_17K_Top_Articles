Introduction
Living at high densities with close relatives increases the risk of
epizootic outbreaks, yet these are the exact conditions in
which social insects successfully live (Schmid-Hempel 1994;
Zasloff 2002; Lawniczak et al. 2007; Nunn et al. 2015).
Their success is due in part to their ability to mitigate epizootic
risk through two forms of immunity. The first is the innate
immune system ( e.g. Evans et al. 2006), composed of sets of
genes that are conserved and well characterized across social
and solitary taxa. This system is activated by a set of generally
acting recognition proteins that detect pathogens and,
through downstream signaling pathways, elicit the expression

 of proteins that eliminate or reduce the pathogenic threat.
We have a deep understanding of the genetics and evolution
of the innate immune system in social insects, in part be-
cause the genes underpinning innate immunity are taxo-
nomically ancient and are largely conserved across insects
(Evans et al. 2006; Harpur and Zayed 2013; Barribeau
et al. 2015).
The second form of immunity is social immunity, an
evolutionarily derived system of prophylactic or curative,
occasionally altruistic, responses that limit the spread of
pathogens (Cremer et al. 2007). Social immunity includes
secretions that act to limit bacterial and fungal growth
(Poulsen et al. 2003), self- or social-exclusion from all or
part of the colony (Heinze and Walter 2010; Lecocq et al.
2016), removal or cannibalism of infected or deceased
workers (Sun and Zhou 2013), grooming (Rosengaus
et al. 1998), and/or the removal of dead or infected lar-
vae
(fig.
1A;
Rothenbuhler
1964a,
1964b).
These
responses are very effective at eliminating the risk of
epizootics. For example, in honey bees, some workers
are able to detect and remove infected brood—a trait
referred to as hygienic behavior (fig. 1A). Forms of
Social immunity, such as hygiene, can be very effective
at eliminating the risk of disease. Field trials demonstrate
that hygienic behavior eliminates the risk of developing
clinical symptoms of Chalkbrood disease and reduces the
risk of developing symptoms of American Foul Brood dis-
ease by 61% (Spivak and Reuter 2001). Because of its
evolutionary novelty in social insects, we do not yet know
the genetic mechanisms underpinning social immunity.
This hampers efforts to understand how social immunity
evolves and to quantify potential genetic or evolutionary
trade-offs between innate and social immunity (e.g.,
Sackton et al. 2007; Harpur and Zayed 2013; Barribeau
et al. 2015).
Here, we take an integrative genomic approach to study
the genetics and evolution of loci associated with social im-
munity in honey bees. Hygienic behavior provides an ideal
model for this study. It varies in expression within and among
honey bee species and populations (Spivak and Gilliam 1998;
Woyke et al. 2004; Woyke et al. 2012; Uzunov et al. 2014),
has been the target of several breeding programs around the
world (e.g., Spivak and Reuter 2001; Buchler et al. 2010;
Pernal et al. 2012; Guarna et al. 2015), and has decades
of research effort demonstrating that it has high narrow-
sense heritability (Rothenbuhler 1964a, 1964b; Lapidge
et al. 2002; Oxley et al. 2010. In this study, we created
two artificially selected populations that highly express hy-
gienic behavior and made use of high-depth full-genome
sequencing to identify loci contributing to the variation in
the expression of hygiene. We then integrated multiple in-
dependent genomic data sets to quantify patterns of natural
and artificial selection at loci associated with hygienic behav-
ior in honey bees.
Materials and Methods
Beekeeping and Breeding
Honey bee sampling, field testing, and breeding was per-
formed at four locations in Western Canada: Selective breed-
ing for hygienic behavior was conducted near Grand Forks,
BC, whereas unselected colonies were maintained at the
Research Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in
Beaverlodge, AB, and at the University of Manitoba in
Winnipeg and propagated near Abbotsford, BC (for extensive
details on breeding scheme see Guarna et al. 2015). Colonies
were assessed for hygienic behavior using the freeze-killed

by freezing a section of capped honey bee brood (see left image) with
liquid nitrogen. Once thawed, the frozen section is placed back inside the
colony. After 24h the section is removed once more and the number of
uncapped and removed cells is counted. Hygienic behavior is scored as the

 brood (FKB) method (Spivak and Gilliam 1998), where the
proportion of sealed cells that nurse bees fully uncap and
remove dead pupae from is counted at 24h using two sep-
arate tests performed 1 week apart on each colony. From an
initial survey of 635 colonies, we created two selected pop-
ulations (of 100 colonies each) and maintained them for three
generations. Each generation we selectively bred for either
high hygienic behavior or a combination of hygienic behavior
and expression of protein markers associated with hygiene
(for extensive sampling details see: Guarna et al. 2015,
2017). Along with these two selected populations, we also
maintained a “baseline” population of 100 colonies that were
randomly chosen from the survey population. To prevent mi-
gration among baseline and selected populations during se-
lection, we maintained the baseline populations at separate
apiaries. The baseline population was maintained throughout
the experiment but allowed to openly mate. Our artificial se-
lection procedures involved the following. For the first two
generations, selected colonies were crossed using instrumen-
tal insemination: selected virgins were crossed with pooled
semen collected from drones from 8 to 12 breeder colonies
per site. Virgin queens from the third generation of selection
were naturally closed mated, with mating apiaries located in
an isolated mountain valley near Grand Forks and Christina
Lake, Canada, respectively, where there were no other
known feral or domestic sources honey bees. We sampled
colonies from these two selected populations and from the
baseline population at the third generation (see below).
We also sampled eight diploid adult workers from a random
set of colonies within Ontario, Canada (supplementary table S1,
Supplementary Material online). We included these samples to
look for evidence of nonrandom introgression at regions tenta-
tively associated with hygienic behavior.
Genome Alignment and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
Calling
The McGill University and G�

ebec Innovation Centre
sequenced high molecular weight DNA from a total of 125
haploid male honey bees (drones) using Illumina HiSeq 2500
Rapid with 150-bp paired-ended reads to a mean depth of
33.07 reads. Drones were collected as larvae from randomly
selected colonies of the control and selected lines with an
average of 3.1 drones collected per colony. All samples
were aligned, processed, and had single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) called following a similar pipeline used previ-
ously by our group (Harpur, Kent, et al. 2014) and all
sequencing data have been deposited with NCBI SRA (sup-
plementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Raw
reads were trimmed of leading and tailing sequence with
Trimmomatic v0.32, aligned to the honey bee reference ge-
nome (AMEL v4.5) using NextGenMapaligner v 0.4.12
(Sedlazeck et al. 2013), and removed of duplicate reads
with Picard v1.8. For each colony, we created Variant Call
Files (VCF) with GATK v 3.5 first by realigning around indels
with RealignerTargetCreator followed by IndelRealigner to re-
duce any potential erroneous alignments (McKenna et al.
2010) then using UnifiedGenotyper (with options -stand_-
call_conf 60.0 -stand_emit_conf 40.0 –dcov 200 –min_base_-
quality_score 20) to call SNPs and then indels. We hard-
filtered SNPs using VariantFiltration (QD < 5.0, FS > 40.0,
MQ < 25.0, DP < 100.0) and excluded sequence from all
unmapped scaffolds (AMEL v4.5; Groups 17 or Groups Un)
because of low sequencing coverage in these small and gene-
sparse scaffolds. Several genomic features can result errone-
ous variant calls (McKenna et al. 2010; Hodgkinson and Eyre-
Walker 2011; Leffler et al. 2013). To account for these prob-
lems, we applied three additional filters to our data set prior to
scanning for selection. First, we removed all SNPs within 10nt
of an indel using GATK’s VariantFiltration. Second, we elimi-
nated 1.5xIQR outliers for depth within any alignment. Third,
we aligned all drones individually to the honey bee reference
genome; however, when calling SNPs with GATK (as above)
we allowed the calls to be made as diploid with the expecta-
tion that heterozygotic calls would indicate areas of low com-
plexity that may lead to subsequent sequencing error
(Wallberg et al. 2014). We excluded any SNP within 5bp of
these low-complexity sites. This alignment procedure was fol-
lowed for each drone as well as for pooled alignments of
drones from the same colony. The later allowed us to infer
the queen’s genotype for each colony, the data set we pro-
ceeded with for all analyses. SNPs were identified as nonsy-
nonymous or synonymous using SNPEff v3.6 (Cingolani et al.
2012).
Quantifying the Effects of Genotyping Error
Inferring each queen’s genotype from a sample of at least
three of her haploid sons may lead to genotyping error at
heterozygotic sites due to the chance of not observing one
of her two alleles. In cases where both alleles are not ob-
served, we would falsely infer that a heterozygous genotype
is homozygous, with the probability of assignment to either
homozygotic genotype being the population-level allele fre-
quency. This random error is not expected to influence our
selection analysis because it affects both control and selected
populations and is not expected to lead to consistent differ-
ences in allele frequency between the two populations.
Nevertheless, we explored the impact of this random effect,
by using the R package HardyWeinberg v1.6.1 to sample
genotypes at 1,000,000 sites from a multinomial distribution
with allele frequencies of p¼ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. We
did this independently from three populations to represent
queens in each of control and two selected populations; sup-
plementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). For
each heterozygotic genotype, we applied a binomial proba-
bility to determine the number of heterozygotes missed due
to sampling error, assuming each queen’s genotype was

 inferred from three haploid sons. In the case where the sam-
pled sons of a heterozygous queen all had the same allele, we
probabilistically assigned the queen’s genotype to either of
the two homozygous genotypes based on the underlying al-
lele frequency. We then estimated Fst between selected and
control populations for both the real data (i.e. without geno-
typing error and called ‘real’ hereafter) and for the data fol-
lowing genotyping error.
We found that genotyping error had minimal effect on
allele frequency–based estimates of selection at heterozygotic
sites. The real allele frequency and the allele frequency esti-
mated with genotyping error were highly correlated (r¼ 0.99;
P< 0.000001) and expectedly, so too were real Fst and Fst
with genotyping error (r¼ 0.81; P< 0.000001). Fst with gen-
otyping error (mean ¼ 0.012) was slightly but significantly
higher
than
real
Fst
(mean
¼
0.017;
P< 0.00001).
Genotyping error did not greatly impact our False Positive
rate: there was only a 0.53% 6 0.0053 Standard Error chance
across all allele frequencies of a single real ‘low’ Fst site (Fst <
95% of data) becoming a ‘high’ Fst site due to genotyping
error alone (Fst > 95% of data). It is therefore very unlikely
that a 1Kbp window (containing an average of 11 SNPs in our
dataset) will falsely be called an outlier due to genotyping
error alone.
Neutral Simulations
We created a neutral simulation of our sampling design us-
ing ms (Hudson 2002). We simulated sampling 100 mated
queens from within a much larger Canadian honey bee pop-
ulation. Because the effective population size of Canadian
honey bees is unknown, we varied the initial population size
from which the three experimental populations were se-
lected over a wide range (N0 ¼
50,000, 100,000,
150,000, 250,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000). We note
that British Columbia and Alberta have a census population
size of at least 350,000 honey bee colonies (Mukezangango
and Page 2017) so our simulations likely cover the range of
expected effective population size for honeybees in our sam-
pling range and Canada more broadly. Honeybees in
Canada have little genetic differentiation between provinces
(Harpur et al. 2015) and have high levels of genetic diversity
(Harpur et al. 2012); two properties that suggest high effec-
tive population sizes. Importantly, our conclusions where
robust over the range of N0 simulated herein.
From each N0 simulated, we instantaneously sampled 100
mated queens each of which was assumed to be storing
sperm from 18 haploid males (Tarpy et al. 2015). This equa-
tes to sampling from each N0 to an effective population size
of 219 (Wright 1933; Zayed 2004). We created three such
samples of 219 individuals to represent our three experimen-
tal populations and we allowed these three populations to
evolve via drift with no migration for three generations. For
each simulation, we assumed a recombination rate of 22
cM/Mb (Beye et al. 2006; Solignac et al. 2007) and a muta-
tion rate of 3 � 10�9 (Liu et al. 2017). For each N0, we
simulated 100,000 1-kbp windows and sampled 84 total
chromosomes across the three populations, representing
our experimental sampling scheme. From these samples,
we then estimated pairwise Fst (Weir and Cockerham
1984) between each of the two populations representing
the experimental selected populations against the single
population representing the experimental control popula-
tion. We also estimated Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989) within
the selected populations independently. Therefore, our sim-
ulation allows us to quantify the expected distributions of Fst
and Tajima’s D for our breeding trial without the effects of
selection.
Identifying Positively Selected Loci
Our simulations demonstrated that the demographic effects
on allele frequency differentiation among populations are
minimal and so we sought to identify regions of the genome
acted on by positive selection using several robust frequency-
based approaches. Artificial positive selection shifts the allele
frequency spectrum around selected loci by driving causal
mutations and those linked to them to fixation (Nijhout
and Paulsen 1997; Nielsen 2005). Alleles that are associated
with a given trait will be among the first to fix and be de-
tectable by differences in allele frequency between popula-
tions (Nijhout and Paulsen 1997; Akey et al. 2002; Nielsen
2005; De Kovel 2006). By sequencing the genomes of se-
lected and unselected lines, we were able to look for these
differences in allele frequency between lines using scans of
pairwise Fst (Weir and Cockerham 1984) with the under-
standing that regions of high Fst relative to the rest of the
genome are likely to be those acted on by selection (Akey
et al. 2002). We used hapFLK analysis (Bonhomme et al.
2010; Fariello et al. 2013) to identify local haplotype clusters
acted on by positive selection. We first ran hapFLK on each
of the 16 chromosomes individually across all populations to
create a pairwise Reynolds’ distances between populations.
Using this kinship matrix, we used 20 haplotype clusters and
scanned across each chromosome for 20 expectation maxi-
mization iterations with hapFLK using our baseline popula-
tion as the outgroup. We estimated significance using chi-
squared density and we corrected for False Discovery Rate by
using Storey’s method (Storey and Tibshirani 2003) and tak-
ing
only

values
with
Q< 0.01
(corresponding

trum within selected populations using Tajima’s D (Tajima

 2014). We scanned each chromosome using a running me-
dian of 101 SNPs and extracted all regions with a �log10[CSS
P value] > 1.3. Any region that was within 5 kb of any other
significant region was pooled. For these methods, and all
other methods requiring phased data, we phased all queen
genotypes together for each chromosome individually using
SHAPEIT v2.2 (O’Connell et al. 2014) with the additional
options –rho 0.39 –window 0.5.
Comparisons to Previous Hygienic Behavior Association
Studies and Evidence of Natural Selection
Broad Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) have been previously
identified for hygienic behavior Lapidge et al. 2002; Oxley
et al. 2010; Spotter et al. 2012; Tsuruda et al. 2012. We
tested if genes acted on by artificial selection in our analysis
localized to these broader regions. We remapped QTL regions
based on microsatellites by using BlastN to identify the ho-
mologous regions within the Amelv4.5 genome. We have
included the previously associated regions supplementary ma-
terial (Data Set S1), Supplementary Material online. To quan-
tify natural selection acting since the split of Apis mellifera
from its sister species Apis cerana, we used previous estimates
of the selection coefficient (c ¼ 2Nes) on most genes within
the honey bee genome (Harpur, Kent, et al. 2014); a selection
coefficient >1 is indicative of positive selection driving the
fixation of beneficial alleles. This analysis was performed
with samples independent of those used in our artificial se-
lection experiment.
Phenotype Association Analysis
We targeted our association analyses to quantify the relation-
ship between haplotypes and the quantitative expression of
hygiene within the 132 artificially selected regions. Haplotype
analysis was performed within the baseline population only
for a moving three SNP window using PLINK v 1.07 (–hap –
hap-window 3) (Purcell et al. 2007; Chang et al. 2015). We
extracted all 1,443 haplotypes that were significantly associ-
ated (P< 0.05) with hygienic behavior.
Admixture Analyses
We scanned the genome for evidence of differential admix-
ture between selected and baseline populations and within
North American populations using ELAI v 1.0 (Guan 2014).
For each chromosome, we estimated local ancestry using the
recommended default parameters of ELAI and assuming 200
generations since the initial admixture of source populations.
Each run included both selected and baseline populations
together.
Gene Ontology Analyses
We used DAVID v 6.7 (Huang et al. 2009) to identify if the list
of candidate genes associated with hygienic behavior was
enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms, focusing specifically
on BP_4, MF_4, and CC_4. All tests we performed using
Drosophila homologs identified with BlastP match (E-value
threshold 1e-10) and because of our small gene list, we ac-
cepted any GO term with P< 0.1.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with R v3.30 (R Core
Team 2010). Statistical tests are reported within text and we
performed parametric tests where data permitted, otherwise
we report nonparametric results.
Results and Discussion
Sampling and Genome Sequencing
After three generations of artificial selection, our two se-
lected populations expressed hygienic behavior significantly
more (mean ¼ 92% of dead brood and caps completely
removed 24h postfreezing) than the baseline population
(mean ¼ 68%; Analysis of variance [ANOVA]; F2,38 ¼
25.8; P < 0.000001; Tukey Honestly Significant Difference
[HSD] P < 0.00001 for selected vs. baseline; Tukey HSD se-
lected 1 vs. selected 2 ¼ 0.29; fig. 1B). For all subsequent
analyses, we have pooled the two selected populations un-
less otherwise stated. We sampled a total of 125 haploid
drone larvae for colonies from each of the three populations.
The queen genotypes of each colony were inferred given the
genomes of their haploid drone sons, each sequenced to the
same average mean site depth (supplementary table S1,
Supplementary Material online; mean ¼ 34.3�; ANOVA
F1,37 ¼ 2.15; P ¼ 0.15; see Materials and Methods).
Following alignment and variant calling, we were able to
identify 2,340,950 segregating SNPs.
Selection Mapping
Strong selective events are expected to 1) increase the de-
gree of differentiation between selected and unselected pop-
ulations at loci contributing variation to the selected trait
(Nijhout and Paulsen 1997), 2) increase differentiation of al-
lele frequencies at loci that are nearby causal loci due to
hitchhiking effects—called selective sweeps (Nielsen 2005),
and 3) cause a shift in the allele frequency spectrum away
from neutral expectations at and nearby causal loci in se-
lected populations (Nielsen 2005). We used these expecta-
tions to identify regions of the genome that are associated
with hygienic behavior. To that end, we made use of three
tests for selection. The first was the haplotype-based outlier
approach hapFLK (Qanbari et al. 2012; Fariello et al. 2013)
applied on the selected populations using the baseline pop-
ulation as an outgroup. The hapFLK statistic is a measure of
haplotype frequency differentiation scaled by relatedness be-
tween populations: A high hapFLK value is indicative of

 positive selection (i.e., artificial selection in our study)
(Qanbari et al. 2012; Fariello et al. 2013). Second, we esti-
mated the shift in the allele frequency spectrum within the
selected populations using Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989)—lower
Tajima’s D relative to the genomic average is indicative of
positive artificial selection. Finally, we estimated the inte-
grated haplotype score (Voight et al. 2006) for selected pop-
ulations at each SNP within the genome. This statistic detects
evidence of recent positive selection at a locus by comparing
levels of linkage disequilibrium around alleles. These three
statistics were combined into a single composite selection
statistic (CSS) (Randhawa et al. 2014) that allowed us to
find regions of the genome with robust signatures of artifi-
cial selection. This approach yielded 132 candidate regions
across the genome that had significant evidence of positive
selection within the selected populations (fig. 2). Combined,
these regions account for at least 1,255 kb and 10,140 SNPs
across the genome.
Observed Patterns of Diversity and Divergence in Selected
Regions Are Not Expected by Drift and Sampling Alone
We developed neutral simulations to examine the distribution
of population genetic statistics in three populations similar to
the ones studied herein under a model of random sampling
and genetic drift. Three lines of evidence suggest that the
patterns used to identify artificially selected regions those hav-
ing high divergence between selected populations and the
control population and allele frequency shifts within selected
populations—are not caused by drift alone. First, simulated Fst

 population when compared with our neutral simulations (ta-
ble 1; Fisher test P< 0.001). Finally, in the experimental data
set, we found that windows with high Fst in both selected
populations were enriched for having lower Tajima’s D
(D < 99% of the data) relative to all windows in the genome
(Fisher test; OR ¼ 1.32; P < 0.013). We never observed this
patternwithinour simulations (Fishertest;P> 0.62 for all com-
parisons). In fact, such high Fst windows within the simulations
had significantly higher Tajima’s D relative to all windows
within a simulation (AOV; P < 0.01). This evidence suggests
that our selection scan adequately captured regions which
were acted on by artificial selection: regions with high Fst be-
tween selected and control populations and low Tajima’s D in
selected populations (Nielsen, et al. 2007).
Overlap with Previous QTL Studies
The regions we found to be significantly associated with hy-
gienic behavior often overlapped with, or were near to, previ-
ous QTLs for the trait (fig. 2; Lapidge et al. 2002; Oxley et al.
2010; Spotter et al. 2012; Tsuruda et al. 2012). Previous studies
found several broad QTLs (totaling �12 Mb) that explained
variation in the expression of hygiene among colonies. Our
regions fell directly inside the most informative QTL identified
to date: hyg2 on chromosome 5 (fig. 2) that accounted for
13% of the phenotypic variation in the expression of hygienic
behavior in an independent study (Oxley et al. 2010). Our
regions also overlapped with two QTLs on chromosomes 1
and 9 that explain 3.9% and 6%, respectively, of the pheno-
typic variance of Varroa-Specific Hygiene—a form of hygienic
behavior specific to brood parasitized by Varroa mites (Harbo
and Harris 1999, 2005; Tsuruda et al. 2012). Two selected
regions on chromosomes 10 and 9 that also overlapped with
QTLs that explain 7% of the variation in brood removal and 7%
of the variation in brood uncapping behavior, respectively
(Oxley et al. 2010). Finally, we supported evidence of loci on
chromosomes 3 and 6 that were found to be associated with
hygienic behavior from a low resolution genome association
study (fig. 2) (Spotter et al. 2012, 2016). The overlap between
our work and previous genetic studies of hygienic behavior
strongly supports our approach for identifying loci underpinning
hygienic behavior in honey bees. However, our approach has
higher resolution: hygienic-associated regions span 1,255 kb in
our study, relative to a total of �12 Mb previously implicated in
hygienic or associated behaviors from in QTL studies.
Candidate Regions Explain Variation in Hygienic Behavior
in the Baseline Population
Overlap with known QTLs provides evidence that the regions
we identified are associated with hygiene. We were able to
provide additional support by using a targeted haplotype as-
sociation approach (Purcell et al. 2007). We asked if hygiene-
associated loci inferred from our population genomic con-
trasts between baseline and selected populations contained
SNPs or haplotypes that explained phenotypic variation in hy-
giene in our baseline population (see Materials and Methods).
We found 1,443 haplotypes (2,058 SNPs) within 99 of the
132 candidate loci inferred from population genomic con-
trasts that were significantly associated (P< 0.05) with differ-
ences in hygienic behavior in the baseline (unselected)
population. For the proceeding functional and evolutionary
analysis, we only included the 99 genomic regions (977 kb;
supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online) that
had significant evidence of selection in our genomic contrast
between selected and baseline populations and contained
haplotypes that were significantly associated with hygienic
behavior in our baseline population.
Candidate Genes for Hygienic Behavior
By integrating both selection and association mapping, we
have narrowed the candidate loci underpinning variation in
hygiene from the �12 Mb of bee’s genome previously impli-
cated in QTL studies to �977 kb, representing an order of
magnitude improvement in mapping resolution.
The reduction in sequence space is promising and provides a
useful list of candidate genes for future functional investigation.
However, we sought to narrow our search further by extracting
from our list of candidate regions those genes with the greatest
evidence of differentiation among selected and control popu-
lations. We extracted those genes with significant evidence of
differentiation in and around the 99 associated windows
(�log10[hapFLK P] > 2.5). In doing so, we narrowed the puta-
tive candidates to a set of 73 protein-coding genes (49 of which
are within or near to QTL regions; supplementary table S3,
Supplementary Material online). We studied the taxonomic or-
igin, molecular and biological function, and evolution of these
73 genes to better understand the genetics, molecular biology
and evolution of hygienic behavior.

 After classifying these 73 candidate genes associated with
hygienic behavior based on their phylogenetic origins (see
supplemental in Harpur, Kent, et al. 2014; Jasper et al.
2015), we found that 85–98.7% of them are shared among
Hymenopterans and Insects, respectively (supplementary ta-
ble S3, Supplementary Material online). It has been hypothe-
sized that novel social traits arise either via novel genes (i.e.,
evolutionary recent) or by reusing and remodeling existing
genes and gene networks regulating analogous traits found
in solitary ancestors (i.e., evo-devo/tool kit hypothesis)
(Johnson and Linksvayer 2010; Rehan and Toth 2015). Our
study supports the latter model for social immunity, given that
most of our top candidate genes are taxonomically ancient.
Using enrichment analysis based on GO, we found that
candidate genes were enriched for terms associated with neu-
ronal development and early axon guidance (GO Analysis;
supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online).
The most highly significant SNPs (�log10[hapFLK P] > 2.5)
within the 73 genes were predominately found within introns
(94% of these SNPs), a pattern that suggests the genes un-
derpinning hygiene play a role in regulating gene expression.
Taken together, our results suggest that mutations in our
candidate genes play a role in regulating the expression of
key genes involved in neuronal development.
Reducing our search further and focusing solely on the
genes within only the most significant peaks and those within
or near to previous QTLs alone, we recapitulate the broader
results reported above. The significant CSS peak on chromo-
some 6 contains three genes (abscam, goosecoid, and tropo-
mysin-2-like), all of which are critical to early neuronal
development (Hahn and J€
ackle 1996; Li and Gao 2003;
Funada et al. 2007; Posnien et al. 2011). The most signifi-
cantly differentiated of the candidates is abscam (GB45774)
an ortholog of the Drosophila gene dscam2. Abscam is
among the few honey bee genes that has been functionally
characterized and is known to play a role in axon guidance
(Funada et al. 2007). Isoforms of abscam are expressed during
early development within the lamina, medulla, and lobula of
the optic lobes, the glomeruli of the antennal lobes, the cen-
tral body, and the mushroom bodies where expression pro-
motes neural outgrowth, particularly of olfactory neural axons
(Funada et al. 2007). It is the many isoforms of abscam that
are involved in neuronal outgrowth and patterning, isoforms
created by including or excluding immuno-globin domains
through alternative splicing (Funada et al. 2007). The most
significantly differentiated of the SNPs within this gene are
intronic and are within or flank splice-site recognition regions
surrounding immuno-globin domains.
The peaks at chromosomes 11 and 9 contain the ortholog
to
the
Drosophila
gene
dyschronic
(chromosome
11;
GB45054) and Insulin-like receptor (Chr. 9; GB53353).
Dyschronic is expressed during development and encodes sev-
eral splice forms whose expression can affect axon guidance,
overall neuroanatomy and locomotion (Jepson et al. 2012). In
adult Drosophila, dyschronic protein is expressed in the mush-
room bodies, ellipsoid body and antennal lobes where it inter-
acts with Big Potassium (BK) channels and regulates neuronal
excitability (Jepson et al. 2012). Variants of dyschronic, may
act to alter the response thresholds of hygienic bees through
its association with BK channels. BK channels are known to
limit the action potential duration (Bean 2007) and their in-
teraction with dyschronic can change the shape of response
thresholds (Jepson et al. 2014). Highly differentiated muta-
tions within dyschronic include one mutation within a splice-
site region and two nonsynonymous variants. Insulin-like re-
ceptor on chromosome 9 shares similar functions with
abscam and dyschronic: It is involved in neuronal pruning
and axon guidance (Song et al. 2003; Wong et al. 2013).
The CSS peak, on chromosome 5, contains GB44550 (similar
to Drosophila sidestep), again known to be involved in axon
guidance during development (Sink et al. 2001).
Though we are only able to explore candidate genes at
this time, our results are consistent with mechanistic stud-
ies of hygienic behavior in honey bees. Previous experi-
mental work revealed that variation in hygienic behavior is
the result of variance in the response threshold of nurse
bees to “dead-brood” signals (Masterman et al. 2001;
McAfee et al. 2018) potentially caused by overactive octo-
paminergenic neurons in the antennal lobes or mushroom
bodies of the brain (Spivak et al. 2003). Dead-brood sig-
nals are detected at olfactory chemo-sensory neurons of
the antennae which are then transmitted to the antennal
lobes and processed by the mushroom bodies. Hygienic
bees are more receptive to these signals as a result of
structural variation in the brain and have distinct patterns
of gene and protein expression in brain and antennal
regions (Parker et al. 2012; Boutin et al. 2015; Guarna
et al. 2015). Our data suggest that differences in the ex-
pression of hygienic behavior between bees may be the
result of differences in developmental trajectory during
adult behavioral maturation or larval development.
Evidence of Positive Selection on Social Immune Loci
Social immunity is argued to be effective at reducing the risk
of infection to such an extent that it relaxes constraint on the
innate immune system (Evans et al. 2006; Cotter and Kilner
2010; Harpur, Chernyshova, et al. 2014; Lopez-Uribe et al.
2016). If the genes underpinning social immunity contribute
to fitness in social lineages, we would expect those genes to
be acted on by natural selection. To date, no study has ex-
plored the genetic evolution of social immunity in honey bees
because the underlying genes were not known. Here, we
examined patterns of adaptive evolution at our 73 top candi-
date genes relative to the rest of the honey bee’s protein-
coding genome over the past �5–25 Ma (Harpur, Kent,
et al. 2014). We achieved this by directly estimating selection
coefficients at the 73 genes strongly associated with hygienic

 behavior and comparing them to other genes in the genome
using a variant of the MK test applied to sequence data from
A. mellifera and its sister species Apis cerana (as performed in
Harpur, Kent, et al. [2014]).
We found that 13.6% of the 73 candidate genes had ev-
idence of strong positive selection and that these genes had
significantly higher selection coefficients than all other similar
sized sets of genes in the genome (permutation test
N¼ 10,000; P¼ 0.005). If we restrict our analysis to only
the 49 candidate genes within QTL regions, we again find
that hygiene candidates are more highly enriched for evidence
of selection with 23.2% of those genes having evidence of
selection (P¼ 0.01). If we estimate the average selection co-
efficient for all GO Biological Process sets in the honey bee
database (Huang et al. 2009), we find that the hygienic can-
didates had higher selection coefficients than 90% of all
Biological Process GO terms, with levels of selection similar
to the biological processes of regulation of neurotransmitter
levels (GO:0001505), learning or memory (GO:0007611), and
detection of external stimulus (GO:0009581). Our analysis
supports the hypothesis that hygienic behavior is important
for fitness in honey bees. Further, fitness benefit is not strictly
a result of management though beekeeping as our estimates
of selection were derived from the African honey bee a pop-
ulation that is not typically used in commercial beekeeping.
C-Lineage Alleles Associated with Hygienic Behavior in
Managed Bees
Comparisons within and across multiple studies suggest that
subspecies of the honey bee’s C-lineage (e.g., A. m. ligustica
or A. m. carnica) are more hygienic than subspecies of the
M-lineage (e.g., A. m. mellifera) in Europe (Flores et al. 2001;
Perez-Sato et al. 2009; Bak et al. 2010; Balhareth et al. 2012;
Uzunov et al. 2014; Gerula et al. 2015) (supplementary table
S5, Supplementary Material online). Managed North America
honey bees are highly admixed, originating mostly from both
the C- and M-lineage bees of Europe (Harpur et al. 2015). If
the differences in hygienic behavior between the C- and M-
lineages are genetically influenced, then we may expect to
find a higher frequency of C-lineage alleles in managed North
American populations that have been artificially selected for
hygienic behavior.
In our artificially selected populations, we found that hy-
gienic loci have significantly more C-lineage ancestry (median
87% C) relative to the baseline population (79% C) and rel-
ative to the genome as a whole (fig. 3A; Wilcoxon test,
P< 0.0001). We found this same pattern of differential ad-
mixture at hygienic loci within an independent population of
Canadian honey bees—colonies from the Province of Ontario
that have been subjected to artificial selection for hygienic
behavior for more than a decade (Harpur et al. 2012, 2015)
(fig. 3B). Within the candidate genes above, at the most ex-
treme, SNPs within Insulin-like receptor (chr 9; GB53353) are
almost entirely fixed for C-lineage variants within selected and
North American hygienic populations (median 95% C in se-
lected and 91% within North America) but not within the
baseline population (53% C).

provides new opportunities to explore how candidate genes
contribute variation to the expression of hygienic behavior.
We show that candidate genes are highly conserved, have
evidence of positive selection, and are enriched for regulatory
mutations that likely act to influence brain and neuronal de-

functional experiments to identify and confirm the mechanis-
