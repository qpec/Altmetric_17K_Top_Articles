AbsTrACT
background A cluster randomised trial (CRT) in Burkina 
Faso was the first to demonstrate that a radio campaign 
increased health-seeking behaviours, specifically antenatal 
care attendance, health facility deliveries and primary care 
consultations for children under 5 years.
Methods Under-five consultation data by diagnosis was 
obtained from primary health facilities in trial clusters, from 
January 2011 to December 2014. Interrupted time-series 
analyses were conducted to assess the intervention effect 
by time period on under-five consultations for separate 
diagnosis categories that were targeted by the media 
campaign. The Lives Saved Tool was used to estimate 
the number of under-five lives saved and the per cent 
reduction in child mortality that might have resulted 
from increased health service utilisation. Scenarios were 
generated to estimate the effect of the intervention in the 
CRT study areas, as well as a national scale-up in Burkina 
Faso and future scale-up scenarios for national media 
campaigns in five African countries from 2018 to 2020.
results Consultations for malaria symptoms increased 
by 56% in the first year (95% CI 30% to 88%; p<0.001) 
of the campaign, 37% in the second year (95% CI 12% to 
69%; p=0.003) and 35% in the third year (95% CI 9% to 
67%; p=0.006) relative to the increase in the control arm. 
Consultations for lower respiratory infections increased 
by 39% in the first year of the campaign (95% CI 22% to 
58%; p<0.001), 25% in the second (95% CI 5% to 49%; 
p=0.010) and 11% in the third year (95% CI −20% to 54%; 
p=0.525). Diarrhoea consultations increased by 73% in 
the first year (95% CI 42% to 110%; p<0.001), 60% in the 
second (95% CI 12% to 129%; p=0.010) and 107% in the 
third year (95% CI 43% to 200%; p<0.001). Consultations 
for other diagnoses that were not targeted by the radio 
campaign did not differ between intervention and control 
arms. The estimated reduction in under-five mortality 
attributable to the radio intervention was 9.7% in the first 
year (uncertainty range: 5.1%–15.1%), 5.7% in the second 
year and 5.5% in the third year. The estimated number of 
under-five lives saved in the intervention zones during the 
trial was 2967 (range: 1110–5741). If scaled up nationally, 
the estimated reduction in under-five mortality would have 
been similar (9.2% in year 1, 5.6% in year 2 and 5.5% in 
year 3), equating to 14 888 under-five lives saved (range: 
4832–30 432). The estimated number of lives that could 
be saved by implementing national media campaigns in 
other low-income settings ranged from 7205 in Burundi to 
21 443 in Mozambique.
Conclusion Evidence from a CRT shows that a child 
health radio campaign increased under-five consultations 
at primary health centres for malaria, pneumonia and 
diarrhoea (the leading causes of postneonatal child 
Key questions
What is already known?
 
► Media campaigns can potentially reach a large audi-
ence at relatively low cost but have historically been 
poorly evaluated.
 
► A recent cluster randomised trial (CRT) in Burkina 
Faso found that a saturation-based radio campaign 
increased antenatal care attendance, health facility 
deliveries and primary care consultations for chil-
dren under 5 years but was unable to detect a re-
duction in child mortality.
What are the new findings?
 
► Evidence from the CRT shows that the radio cam-
paign substantially increased under-five con-
sultations at primary health centres for malaria, 
pneumonia and diarrhoea, the leading causes of 
postneonatal child mortality in Burkina Faso.
 
► Using the Lives Saved Tool, the effect of the media 
campaign on healthcare seeking behaviours was es-
timated to reduce under-five deaths by an average 
of 7.1% per year.
What do the new findings imply?
 
► Substantial changes in health-seeking behaviours 
and reductions in under-five mortality can be 
achieved by saturation-based media campaigns, 
and these should belong in the mainstream of public 
health interventions.

mortality in Burkina Faso) and resulted in an estimated 7.1% average 
reduction in under-five mortality per year. These findings suggest 
important reductions in under-five mortality can be achieved by mass 
media alone, particularly when conducted at national scale.
InTroduCTIon
Mass media campaigns have the potential to reach a 
large audience at a relatively low cost. As such, they have 
an important role to play in behaviour change commu-
nication to improve child survival in low-income and 
middle-income countries.1 However, there have been 
few attempts to rigorously measure the impact of mass 
media.2 A systematic review of evaluations of mass media 
interventions for child survival-related behaviours in 
low-income and middle-income countries reported that 
media campaigns can have a positive impact on a wide 
range of child health behaviours.3 The review high-
lighted scope for improvement in the often weak evalu-
ations of media campaigns and lack of cost-effectiveness 
analyses to allow comparisons with other types of health 
intervention.3 
Using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), we previously 
modelled the potential impact of saturation-based media 
campaigns, estimating that they could reduce child 
mortality by 10%–20% at a cost per disability-adjusted 
life-year (DALY) that is as low as the most cost-effective 
child health interventions.2 4 We tested these predictions 
by conducting the first cluster randomised trial (CRT) to 
evaluate the impact that a radio campaign alone could 
have on child mortality ( 
ClinicalTrial. 
gov Identifier: 
NCT01517230). As described elsewhere,5 the study clus-
ters consisted of 14 rural geographical areas with high 
radio-listenership, each centred on a community radio 
station, with areas around towns excluded to remove 
populations with potential access to electricity and hence 
television. Seven clusters were randomly allocated to 
receive the intervention or control using pair-matched 
randomisation based on geographical proximity and 
radio listenership. A baseline survey conducted after 
randomisation revealed some important differences in 
the socioeconomic characteristics of the intervention and 
control clusters, particularly with regard to ethnicity, reli-
gion, distance to the nearest health facility and distance 
to the capital city (a marker of general level of develop-
ment). Postneonatal under-five child mortality risk also 
differed between the intervention and control zones 
(see online supplementary appendix 1 for map and base-
line characteristics of clusters). A cluster-level summary 
confounder score was calculated using principal compo-
nent analysis (described elsewhere6) and used to control 
for imbalance between the groups.
The intervention consisted of a 35-month intensive 
radio campaign, running from March 2012 to January 
2015, across seven community FM radio stations, which 
has been described in detail previously.5 Briefly, caregivers 
of children less than 5 years old were the primary target 
audience of the campaign, which covered a wide range of 
maternal and child health behaviours. Sixty-second radio 
spots were broadcast approximately 10 times per day, 
and 2-hour interactive (long-format) programmes were 
broadcast 5 days per week.
The endline trial results are presented elsewhere.6 
Routine health facility data showed the intervention 
led to an increase in primary care consultations among 
children under-five, in all 3 years of the campaign (35% 
in year 1: p<0.001, 20% in year 2: p=0.003% and 16% in 
year 3: p=0.049, see online supplementary appendix 1a). 
The intervention also led to increases in antenatal care 
(ANC) attendances (6% in year 1: p=0.004% and 9% 
in year 2: p=0.026) and health facility deliveries (7% in 
year 1: p=0.004, 6% in year 2: P=0.003 and 9% in year 
3: p<0.001). This constitutes the most rigorous evidence 
to date that a radio campaign alone can increase health 
facility utilisation for maternal and child health in a 
low-income setting.6
The study did not detect an impact of the campaign 
on the primary outcome of postneonatal child mortality. 
The power of the study was constrained by the limited 
number of clusters available. The original power calcula-
tions estimated the evaluation had 80% power to detect 
a 20% reduction in postneonatal child mortality and 
54% power to detect a 15% reduction. However, rapidly 
declining child mortality in both arms and substan-
tial between-cluster heterogeneity at baseline further 
reduced the power of the study to detect an effect on 
mortality.6 In this paper, we present further trial data on 
under-five consultations disaggregated by diagnosis. We 
then estimate the impact of the increased health service 
utilisation observed in the trial on under-five mortality in 
Burkina Faso using the LiST.
MeTHods
routine health facility data
For 78 primary health facilities located across trial clus-
ters (41 in control clusters), routine health facility data 
were obtained from the Direction Générale des Etudes 
et des Statistiques Sanitaires of the Ministry of Health 
in Burkina Faso.6 Monthly counts of all-cause under-
five consultations were obtained from January 2011 to 
February 2016, and monthly counts of clinical diagnoses 
as reported by healthcare workers were obtained from 
January 2011 to December 2014. Reported diagnoses are 
based on clinical symptoms assessed by health workers 
and are not typically supported by diagnostic or labora-
tory test confirmation. Diagnoses were divided into the 
following categories of illnesses that were addressed by 
the radio campaign and correspond to the three leading 
causes of postneonatal under-five child mortality: malaria 
(complicated and uncomplicated), lower respiratory 
infections (pneumonia and bronchopneumonia) and 
diarrhoea. The remaining diagnoses were categorised 
as follows: upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), 
malnutrition and ‘other’, included all diagnoses not 
captured by any diagnostic category listed above.

Health worker diagnoses were recorded, but the 
primary reason for presentation was not. Each child 
attending a health centre may have had multiple diag-
noses recorded per consultation, so the number of diag-
noses recorded does not equal the number of children 
presenting (online supplementary appendix 2b). To 
facilitate modelling of deaths averted using LiST, we 
therefore compressed the absolute numbers in each 
diagnosis category proportionally (online supplemen-
tary appendix 2c) to create compressed counts, summing 
to 100% of all-cause under-five consultations (online 
supplementary appendix 3)(figures 2–7).
Analysis of routine data
Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted using 
mixed effects Poisson regression of compressed and 
uncompressed monthly counts of attendances per cluster, 
from January 2011 to December 2014, to assess the inter-
vention effect by time period on under-five consultations 
for separate diagnosis categories. The model included 
fixed effects allowing for a long-term secular trend, for 
month of the year to account for seasonal variation, for 
intervention status of the cluster to account for system-
atic differences between arms at baseline, for confounder 
score and for intervention effect by period, with cluster 
treated as a random effect.6 To obtain 95% CIs and 
p values, we used bootstrap resampling (using the BCa 
method and 1000 bootstrap replications).7
The LisT modelling
Mortality impact was estimated using LiST.8 9 LiST allows 
users to model counterfactual scenarios in order to 
calculate the impact of a projected scale up of a health 
intervention on mortality outcomes and to compare the 
impacts of alternative scenarios. More detailed informa-
tion about key inputs used by the tool, including sources 
of data on intervention effectiveness and cause-specific 
mortality by country, are provided in a series of journal 
supplements.8 10–13
LisT analysis
We used health facility data from the CRT as the basis for 
modelling the effect of the radio intervention on child 
mortality (online supplementary appendix 2a). The base-
line and endline coverage estimates used in this model-
ling can be found in online supplementary appendix 4 
and are described in more detail below. A flow diagram 
summarising each stage of the described modelling 
approach and assumptions made is provided in figure 1.
Spectrum software V.5.63 was used for all analyses. The 
LiST package was used to model the mortality change in 
the intervention arm from 2011 (baseline) to 2014. We 
examined the effect of increasing health facility utilisa-
tion in line with the estimates from the CRT while holding 
the coverage of all other interventions constant at their 
2011 level according to the base LiST projection data file 
for Burkina Faso (which uses DHS 2010 as its primary 
data source). For ANC, we applied increases of 6% in 
year 1, 9% in year 2 and 8% in year 3 to coverage of the 
three routine pregnancy interventions in LiST: tetanus 
toxoid vaccination, intermittent preventive treatment of 
malaria in pregnancy and syphilis detection and treat-
ment. Coverage of all other antenatal interventions such 
as prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, 
nutritional supplements or case management of preg-
nancy related disorders was not altered. For facility deliv-
eries/skilled birth attendance, we modelled a 7% increase 
in year 1, 6% in year 2 and 9% in year 3 (online supple-
mentary appendix 2a). Where the LiST programme proj-
ects any other lives saved due to any other interventions 
(such as measles vaccination or HIV treatment with time-
varying coverage), these were subtracted from the lives 
saved totals as no media campaigning was conducted or 
impact measured on these interventions.
Annual percentage increases in seeking treatment 
(figures 2–4) for each of the three main childhood 
illnesses targeted by the radio campaign, malaria, diar-
rhoea and pneumonia (the three primary causes of post-
neonatal under-five mortality in Burkina Faso), were 
applied to treatment coverage estimates in LiST.14 To 
do this, assumptions were made about the proportion 
of the increased number of children seeking treatment 
who actually received appropriate treatments. Data from 
the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2010 survey 
were used to estimate the proportion of children taken 
to health facilities (public primary health centres only) 
with symptoms of these illnesses who received effective 
treatments: artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for 
malaria and oral rehydration solution (ORS) for diar-
rhoea. Where available, DHS data specifically relating 
to rural areas were used for the CRT scenario, since the 
campaign and evaluation were focused on rural areas 
only. The proportion of children taken to public primary 
health facilities who received effective treatments (54.3% 
of those with fever received an antimalarial and 34.5% 
of those with diarrhoea received ORS, according data 
for rural areas from DHS 2010) was then multiplied 
by the increase in facility attendances attributed to the 
radio intervention for each diagnosis group in each year 
(figures 2–4). This was then applied to the baseline LiST 
coverage values for the proportion of all children with 
malaria or diarrhoea who received treatment, adjusted 
for rural/national differences, also based on DHS 2010. 
For the oral antibiotics for pneumonia field, the LiST 
definition uses care-seeking for pneumonia at a health 
centre as a proxy for treatment with oral antibiotics. We 
therefore simply applied the increase in facility atten-
dances for pneumonia attributed to the radio interven-
tion in each year.15
To account for declining rates of under-five mortality 
in both arms throughout the trial period, we input sepa-
rate under-five mortality rates for each year (2012–2014), 
based on the endline mortality survey (137 under-
five deaths per 1000 live births in 2012, 126.5 in 2013 
and 105.1 in 2014 in the intervention arm).6 We then 
obtained the corresponding total number of under-five

deaths (occurring in the absence of the intervention) for 
each year, which served as the denominator to calculate 
the percentage reductions in mortality that occurred as 
a result of the lives saved by the intervention. For the 
national scale-up scenario, child mortality rates of 103.3 
(2012), 97.7 (2013) and 92.8 (2014) per 1000 live births 
were assumed, based on the most recent (2017) Inter-
Agency Group for Child Mortality (IGME) estimates.16 
The percentage reduction in mortality was then calcu-
lated by dividing the estimated number of under-five lives 
saved by the total number of under five deaths (in the 
absence of the intervention) for each separate year. For 
all years, the distribution of under-five deaths by cause 
was based on the WHO 2011 estimates for Burkina Faso.17
LiST uses an estimated effectiveness of ACT treatment 
for malaria of 99%.18 Although ACT is the recommended 
treatment distributed to government primary care facili-
ties in Burkina Faso, we assumed some children might not 
have received the correct, effective antimalarial and so 
we modelled a more conservative effectiveness of malaria 
treatments of 87%. This value was derived based on 
estimates of treatments received from the Malaria Indi-
cators Survey 2014, consultation with the Burkina Faso 
Malaria Control Programme and estimated resistance 
rates of alternative malaria treatments that may have 
been prescribed (see online supplementary appendix 
5).19 The modelled effectiveness for antibiotic treatment 
for pneumonia was 70% and for ORS was 93% (the LiST 
default values). For all three treatments modelled, the 
affected fraction (per cent of deaths due to a specific 
cause that are potentially able to be impacted by a 
specific intervention) for children aged 0–59 months was 
set at 1.0. All other data regarding demographics, popu-
lation size, incidence of diseases, intervention coverage 
and effectiveness remained as provided in the LiST base 
projection data file for Burkina Faso, mostly using DHS 
2010 data.
The impact of changes in intervention coverage on 
under-five and maternal mortality were modelled, and 
these national projections were then adjusted to reflect 
the population reached in the CRT, estimated using 
government population data to be 2.4 million (around

15% of the total population of Burkina Faso).20 We 
made a further adjustment to reflect radio penetration 
at national scale. To do this, we assumed that the number 
of people impacted would be directly proportional to 
the number of people exposed. We therefore adjust the 
mortality outcomes generated by the LiST modelling, 
using the figure for female radio listening in our inter-
vention zones (52% in the endline survey) as a linear 
index. According to the 2010 DHS, the national figure 
for women across Burkina Faso listening to radio in the 
last week was 45.2%. We therefore applied a 13.1% reduc-
tion to the national mortality outcomes (reflecting the 
percentage reduction in female radio listenership from 
52% to 45.2%).
sensitivity analysis
There is currently no single, standardised approach for 
calculating uncertainty bounds around LiST mortality 
estimates due to the challenge of determining the extent 
to which errors and biases in the different model inputs 
overlap and are correlated.21 We therefore conducted 
an additional sensitivity analysis by running projections 
using the upper and lower bounds of the 95% CI around 
the increases in health service utilisation reported in the 
CRT (online supplementary appendix 2). This produced 
the range of possible mortality reductions reported.
In order to be conservative in our scale-up modelling, 
we also applied a reduction to the estimated number 
of lives saved to reflect the reduction in impact that is 
likely to occur due to adaptation of the intervention for 
delivery at the national level. Qualitative implementa-
tion research captured during the campaign suggested 
spots were more strongly linked to changes in behaviour. 
The national scale-up is therefore a spots-only campaign 
at the same intensity as the spot broadcasts during the 
trial. In the absence of any data on which to base the esti-
mated reduction in impact due to removal of long format 
programmes, we modelled a range, applying a 0%, 10% 
and 20% reduction to under-five lives saved.

Future scale-up scenarios
Burkina Faso has a unique configuration of commu-
nity radio stations with very low penetration of national 
media making it feasible to conduct a CRT, and such a 
study would be impossible to replicate in most countries. 
Hence, we explored generalisability of our findings by 
using LiST to explore whether the changes in health-
care-seeking behaviour demonstrated in Burkina Faso 
would have a similar impact on child mortality in other 
countries with different underlying patterns of treatment 
seeking and mortality. We followed a similar approach to 
model the impact of national media campaigns in five 
potential scale-up countries: Burkina Faso, Burundi, 
Malawi, Mozambique and Niger. These projections 
implicitly assume that the media campaign would be 
culturally adapted in each of the countries using the 
processes and principles used to develop the campaign 
in the CRT.5 These countries were selected because they 
vary in terms of their media landscape, population size, 
and rates and causes of child mortality. Health impacts 
in each country were derived from the care-seeking 
effects observed in the Burkina Faso trial and applied to 
LiST baseline coverage estimates for ANC, facility deliv-
eries and treatment for childhood illnesses, as described 
above, for each separate country. For Burkina Faso, base-
line coverage estimates were again based on the most 
recent DHS 2010 figures, as for projections described 
earlier. LiST was then used to project mortality effects 
for 3-year media campaigns in each country from 2018 
to 2020. We made the assumption that the number of 
people impacted was directly proportional to the number 
exposed and therefore adjusted for media penetration 
levels, using DHS estimates of radio and/or television 
penetration in each country (see online supplemen-
tary appendix 6) and using the figure for female radio 
listening in Burkina Faso (52% as measured by the CRT

due to removal of long-format programmes, we applied 
a 0%, 10% and 20% reduction to under-five lives saved.
resuLTs
routine health facility data
Consultations with a diagnosis of malaria increased signif-
icantly throughout the radio campaign (figure 2) by 56% 
in the first year (95% CI 30% to 88%; p<0.001), 37% in 
the second year (95% CI 12% to 69%; p=0.003) and 35% 
in the third year (95% CI 9% to 67%; p=0.006). Malaria 
was the most common diagnosis recorded for 55% of all 
under-five consultations across the 3-year period (online 
supplementary appendix 1c and 2).
Consultations with a diagnosis of lower respira-
tory infection increased by 39% in the first year of the 
campaign (95% CI 22% to 58%; p<0.001) 25% in the 
second year (95% CI 5% to 9%; p=0.010) and 11% in the 
third year (95% CI −20% to 54%; p=0.525) (figure 3). A 
pneumonia diagnosis was recorded for 18% of all under-
five consultations across the 3-year period (online supple-
mentary appendix 1c and 2).
Consultations with a diagnosis of diarrhoea increased 
by 73% in the first year (95% CI 42% to 110%; p<0.001), 
60% in the second year (95% CI 12% to 129%; p=0.010) 
and 107% in the third year (95% CI 43% to 200%; 
p<0.001) (figure 4). A diarrhoea diagnosis was recorded 
for 3% of all under-five consultations across the 3-year 
period (online supplementary appendix 1c and 2).
Other diagnoses that were not targeted by the radio 
campaign, such as URTI (figure 5), malnutrition 
(figure 6) and other diagnoses (figure 7), showed no 
intervention effect. In the case of the other category, 
consultations rose in both arms but significantly more in 
the control arm.

Lives saved modelling
The total number of under-five lives estimated to have 
been saved in areas covered by the radio campaign 
was 2967, with lower and upper bounds of 1110–5741 
(table 1). From this modelling, we estimate the radio 
intervention reduced child mortality in the areas it 
covered by 9.7% (5.1%–15.1%) in the first year, 5.7% 
(0.2%–13.1%) in the second year and 5.5% (−0.1%–
13.1%) in the third year.
Appropriate treatment of malaria accounted for the 
greatest reduction in mortality (61% of the lives saved) 
followed by antibiotics for treatment of pneumonia 
(18%) and delivery in a health centre/presence of a 
skilled birth attendant (16%). ORS for treatment of diar-
rhoea and ANC accounted for 5% and 1% of lives saved, 
respectively.
Extrapolating these results to the national level, 
adjusted by 13.1% to allow for lower radio-listenership, 
we estimate that the total number of under-five lives that 
would have been saved if the intervention had been deliv-
ered at a national scale was 14 888 over 3 years (with lower 
and upper bounds of 4832–30 432). This represents an 
estimated reduction in under-five mortality of 9.2% in 
year 1, 5.6% in year 2 and 5.5% in year 3 (an average 
reduction of 6.8% per year). After applying a further 
discount to account for adaptation of the intervention for 
the nationwide scale-up, the estimated number of lives 
that would have been saved by a national radio campaign 
is 13 400 (4349 to 27 389) when a 10% discount is applied, 
and 11 910 (3865 to 24 345) when a 20% discount is 
applied (table 2).
Although the aim of DMI’s campaign was to reduce 
child deaths, our LiST analyses also suggest that a nation-
wide campaign could have saved maternal lives through 
increased uptake of antenatal and delivery care services.

intervention zones was 39 (range: 12–65) and if scaled up 
nationally would have been 227 (range: 72–376), repre-
senting an average 3% reduction in maternal mortality. 
The estimated number of under five lives that could be 
saved by implementing national media campaigns in 
other low income settings, ranged from 7205 in Burundi 
to 21 443 in Mozambique (table 3).
dIsCussIon
Routine health facility data collected as part of a CRT 
in Burkina Faso provides strong evidence that a radio 
campaign alone significantly increased consultations at 
primary health facilities among under-fives with symp-
toms of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea (the three 
leading causes of postneonatal child mortality in Burkina 
Faso) as well as ANC and facility deliveries. Further 
supporting this evidence of an intervention effect, the 
data showed no difference between the intervention and 
control arms in consultations for diagnoses that were not 
targeted by the media campaign, such as upper respira-
tory infections, malnutrition and other childhood diag-
noses. Using LiST, we estimate that increased health 
service utilisation attributed to the radio campaign 
should have resulted in 2967 under-five and 39 maternal 
lives saved. When scaled up to a national level, we esti-
mate delivery of the intervention would have resulted 
in between 11 910 and 14 888 under-five and 182 to 227 
maternal lives saved. These results suggest that mass 
media represent an important tool for changing health 
behaviours and improving maternal and child survival 
at scale, in low-income countries, dependent on radio 
listenership levels and service availability.

RMNCH interventions on health outcomes,13 22–26

intervention on mortality enables us to estimate the 
potential mortality impact of our campaign. The esti-
mated reduction in under-five mortality (including the 
lower and upper bounds) corresponds to an effect size 
that the mortality survey in the CRT was not powered to 
detect (and which any future studies would struggle to 
detect) and is compatible with the CIs around the esti-
mated mortality reduction in the trial (risk ratio 1.0, 
95% CI 0.82 to 1.22).6 Furthermore, LiST enables the 
estimation of maternal lives saved which the CRT could 
never have been powered to measure.
This modelling further represents an important contri-
bution to the evidence base for social and behaviour 
change communication, since it has facilitated a health 
economic analysis.3 An accompanying study has used 
these findings to assess the cost-effectiveness of mass 
media campaigns, analysing both the costs of the radio 
intervention implemented for the CRT as well as the costs

of delivering it at a national scale in Burkina Faso and 
other countries). Mass media is an unusual intervention 
in that it is usually easier to deliver at scale than within the 
limitations of a cluster trial. Mass media campaigns could 
potentially be used in any similar setting with minimal 
demand generation initiative and good service avail-
ability, perhaps supplementing existing successful inte-
grated community case management activities. Kasteng 
et al have estimated that the incremental provider cost-ef-
fectiveness of a national media campaign in Burkina Faso 
during the trial period would have been $15 per DALY 
averted, with a societal cost (including the additional 
costs to households of changed care-seeking) of $38 per 
DALY averted.20 For national campaigns in five African 
countries from 2018 to 2020, the projected provider cost 
ranged from $7 to $27 per DALY averted.
Our modelling was based on results from a CRT, using 
routine health facility data that was well powered to detect 
changes in care seeking and was collected as part of the 
most rigorous evaluation of a mass media intervention 
to have been conducted in a developing country.6 There 
is extensive evidence, derived from non-randomised 
studies from multiple low-income countries, that mass 
media campaigns with adequate exposure can change 
health-related behaviours affecting child survival.3 Our 
projections for other countries illustrate that the impact 
seen in Burkina Faso is potentially generalisable to other 
countries with different patterns of treatment seeking 
and mortality. However, these projections assume that 
the intervention (with cultural adaptation) would be 
equally effective at increasing healthcare seeking in other 
countries, which may not be the case.
Health facilities in Burkina Faso adopted the District 
Health Information System (DHIS) 2 data management 
system in 2013. In 2014, data submissions from health 
facilities were over 95% complete,29 but there is limited 
information available on the quality of the data collected. 
A further limitation is that the system does not provide 
precise denominator data.6
The average number of diagnoses per consultation 
increased in both arms over time, from 1.23 to 2.17 
in the control arm and from 1.51 to 2.29 in the inter-
vention arm (online supplementary appendix 2b). For 
this reason, it was necessary to compress the absolute 
numbers of diagnoses in each month to 100% of the 
total number of consultations to facilitate modelling. By 
far the largest contributor to this pattern was the other 
diagnosis category (not targeted by the campaign), which 
rose more rapidly in the control arm (online supplemen-
tary appendix 2c). The reasons for this are unclear.
In our modelling, we made adjustments to reflect the 
fact that not all sick children taken to a health facility will 
necessarily receive treatment (perhaps because a health 
worker did not adhere to guidance, or treatment was 
not actually required or due to supply-side constraints). 
We estimated this based on 2010 DHS data (or LiST

automatically estimates this in the case of pneumonia) 
on the proportions of children with fever or diarrhoea 
taken to a health facility who received an ACT or ORS, 
respectively. We used the DHS since it is the largest, most 
representative population-based data available on which 
to base these figures and, as such, is also the basis for most 
intervention coverage figures used in LiST. However, by 
relying on DHS data from 2010 to estimate treatment 
coverage, we may be underestimating the proportion 
of children who received treatment for malaria and 
diarrhoea during the study period. Our modelling may 
overestimate the proportion of children who receive 
antibiotics for pneumonia, as LiST uses care-seeking for 
pneumonia at a health centre as a proxy for the propor-
tion receiving oral antibiotic treatment for pneumonia.
Given the rapid declines in child mortality reported in the 
CRT mortality survey, it is likely that since 2010 investments 
in the health system in Burkina Faso have improved the 
availability of treatments. Indeed, the WHO 2014 Service 
and Availability Readiness Assessment (SARA) report 
suggests good availability of key life-saving treatments in 
primary health facilities: 91% for malaria treatment, 82% 
for ORS sachets and 83% for antibiotics (amoxicillin), 
based on their survey of 659 primary health facilities across 
Burkina Faso.30 This more recent survey of health centres 
provides a reliable assessment of treatment availability but 
does not provide an estimate of the proportion of symp-
tomatic children who receive the available treatments. We 
were therefore reliant on the DHS to estimate this and such 
population-based surveys are not without their limitations. 
Retrospective recall of illness episodes and reporting of 
received treatments by parents using a 2-week recall period 
may be prone to errors and even these large-scale surveys 
are subject to the challenges of small samples for many 
childhood illnesses. No other national data on treatments 
received for all major causes of childhood illness during 
the study period were available. However, an ongoing 
evaluation related to the use of Integrated Management 
of Childhood Illness guidelines in one region of Burkina 
Faso found that only 3 out of 819 cases (0.4%) of uncompli-
cated malaria diagnosed by health workers did not receive 
an ACT (S Sarrassat, personal communication). This was 
based on observations of health workers during consulta-
tions in primary care facilities rather than recall of parents.
Several assumptions are inherent in our modelling 
approach, and we have limited data available to test 
their validity in the context of Burkina Faso, including 
regarding the causes of child deaths and the effective-
ness of different treatments prescribed. We also made an 
assumption that we did not increase the proportion of 
children attending health centres who did not actually 
require treatment. We do know the clinical diagnoses 
ascribed by health workers to the increased consultations, 
and we know that these reflected the three leading causes 
of postneonatal child mortality in Burkina Faso (malaria, 
pneumonia and diarrhoea). It is possible that some 
people travelled to the health centre for trivial reasons, 
but we would expect these are recorded and captured 
within the ‘other’ diagnosis category rather than malaria, 
pneumonia or diarrhoea diagnoses. We also know that 
parents living in intervention areas tended to have much 
further to travel to their closest health facility than 
parents living in the control areas (a median of 6.3 km 
compared with 2.5 km in the control areas) usually by 
foot or bicycle. Moreover, we can only hypothesise that 
it is unlikely parents would make the journey to health 
centres unless their child was quite unwell.
ConCLusIon
Evidence from a CRT shows that a child health radio 
campaign resulted in increased under-five consultations 
at primary health facilities for malaria, pneumonia and 
diarrhoea (the leading causes of postneonatal child 
mortality in Burkina Faso). Our modelling suggests that 
increased health service utilisation attributed to the radio 
campaign, resulted in important reductions in child and 
maternal mortality of 7.1% and 3%, respectively, with an 
estimated 2967 under-five and 39 maternal lives saved, in 
a low-income rural setting in Burkina Faso.
