Over the years, many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the antineoplastic effects of 
cannabinoids (CBDs), with reports advocating for investigations of combination therapy 
approaches that could better leverage these effects in clinical translation. This study 
explores the potential of combination approaches employing CBDs with radiotherapy 
(RT) or smart biomaterials toward enhancing therapeutic efficacy during treatment of 
pancreatic and lung cancers. In in vitro studies, clonogenic assay results showed greater 
effective tumor cell killing, when combining CBDs and RT. Meanwhile, in vivo study results 
revealed major increase in survival when employing smart biomaterials for sustained 
delivery of CBDs to tumor cells. The significance of these findings, considerations for 
further research, and viable roadmap to clinical translation are discussed.

Many in vitro and in vivo studies have reported on the antitumorigenic effects of plant-derived can-
nabinoids (CBDs) and their synthetic analogs, including effects in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting 
tumor cell growth and metastasis (1, 2). Despite these reports of demonstrating the potential of CBDs 
as anticancer agents, clinical translation has been hampered in part by the need to demonstrate 
significant therapeutic efficacy with minimal toxicities or side effects. So far, the only published 
clinical trial on the use of CBDs for cancer treatment has been on a small pilot study involving 
intratumoral (IT) administration of CBDs in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme 
 
(1, 3). This study and subsequent reports (1, 2) highlighted the need for further research to enhance 
the therapeutic efficacy of CBDs, including via combinations with other therapies like chemotherapy 
or radiotherapy (RT), or the use of other routes of administration that can better leverage the effects 
seen in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies.
The advantage of combining CBDs with other therapies is that this may allow simultaneous 
targeting of tumor progression at different levels, while minimizing toxicities for these therapies 
relative to toxicities from higher doses when used as monotherapies. For example, studies suggest 
that fractionated RT can be a double-edged sword (4), killing tumor cells while also inducing tumor 
cell metastasis or invasion from the primary tumors. The use of CBDs in combination with RT 
could benefit from findings that CBDs can inhibit metastasis or invasion (5–8). CBDs have also 
been reported to enhance tumor cell apoptosis via increased generation of reactive oxygen species, 
which could enhance the DNA-damaging effects of RT (9). This could allow for the reduction of RT 
doses or fractions to minimize RT toxicities. Such a combination would be particularly beneficial for

patients needing salvage RT but who are close to their RT normal 
tissue limits (10).
Meanwhile, the route of administration has a significant 
bearing on pharmacokinetics, the bioavailability, time course 
and hence effectiveness of CBDs as anticancer agents. The 
solubility of CBDs in water is poor, with inherent limits to 
intravenous and other routes of CBD delivery. Absorption 
following oral administration route for cancer treatment could 
also be limited by potential for CBD degradation by the acid 
of the stomach (11). Inhalation route exposes valid concerns 
about the adverse pulmonary effects this may have and limited 
effectiveness if not well targeted (12). It has been proposed that 
the administration of a low dose of CBDs directly to the tumor 
would increase effectiveness and reduce adverse side effects 
(13). The published pilot clinical trial (3) employed such an IT 
route with repeated daily administrations of CBDs. However, 
many studies suggest that sustained drug delivery approaches, 
e.g., using smart biomaterials can be more effective than 
repeated injections (12, 14–17).
Pancreatic and lung cancers are amongst the deadliest forms 
of cancers (18, 19), where greater effective treatment approaches 
are needed. Here, we explore the potential for enhancing the 
effectiveness of pancreatic and lung tumor cell kill via: (1) 
combination of CBDs with RT and (2) use of smart biomaterials 
loaded with CBDs for sustained in situ delivery. These findings 
are discussed with considerations toward clinical translation.

cell culture and Materials
Human lung cancer cell line A549 (ATCC) was maintained in 
RPMI media (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L 
l-glutamine, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin solution. Lewis lung 
 
cancer C57BL/6 back ground mouse cell line LLC-1 (ATCC) 
and pancreatic adenocarcinoma C57BL/6 back ground mouse 
cell line PANC-02 (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM media 
(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L l-glutamine, 
1% penicillin, and streptomycin solution following standard 
protocol. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incu-
bator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere following standard protocol. 
All supplements were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and tissue 
culture plastics were obtained from Corning Life Sciences. All 
experimental cells were at least 95% alive.
clonogenic cell survival assay
A549 cells from an actively growing monolayer were trypsinized 
and 300 cells per well were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning). 
After 24 h, seeded cells were treated with 0, 1, 2, and 5 μg/well of 
CBD concentrations. The cells were irradiated at 0, 2, and 4 Gy 
using 220 kVp energy, 13 mA, 24 h after the CBD treatment. 
 
A small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) (20, 21) was 
used for RT (Figure 1). The growing colonies (>50 cells/colony) 
were fixed with 75% ethanol and stained with 1% crystal violet 
(Sigma) 7–10 days after treatment. Colonies were counted using 
ImageJ software and a percent survival was calculated following 
standard protocol (22, 23).
smart Biomaterials
Smart radiotherapy biomaterials (SRBs) were prepared as 
described in previous work (14) using 200 mg of poly(lactic-
co-glycolic) acid (Sigma-Aldrich) with MW 40,000–75,000 
dissolved in 4 mL of Acetone. The resulting blend was loaded 
with a constant flow rate into a silicon tubing (VWR and Versilic) 
using a Harvard apparatus (Harvard Bioscience) and dried at 
50°C for 72 h. The dried biomaterials were cut into 4 mm length 
to incorporate the CBD payload. CBD payloads were custom 
loaded into the SRBs with a unique potential for image-guided 
RT and sustained in situ delivery of the CBD payload. The SRBs 
are customizable allowing for loading of different concentration 
of CBD payloads tagged with fluorescence dye and the incor-
poration of high-Z nanoparticles (NPs) for enhanced computed 
tomography (CT) imaging contrast.
In vitro release of payloads was investigated by placing CBD-
loaded SRBs into wells of a microplate, triplicated for each day the 
payload release was observed. The fluorescence intensity of the 
released payload was read using a microplate reader/photometer.

animal studies
Immune uncompromised, wild-type (W+/+) C57BL/6 strain 
male and female mice were purchased from Jackson laboratory 
at the age of 8 weeks. All mice were maintained at Dana Farber 
Cancer Institute (DFCI) animal facility in accordance with 
institutional policies and Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC)-approved guidelines. Mice between 10 
and 12 weeks of age were used for the experiments. Syngeneic 
mouse models were created by subcutaneously (s.c.) implanting 
C57BL/6 mice with 2 × 105 cells per tumor for PANC-02 cells for 
the pancreatic tumor model, and 5 × 104 cells per tumor LLC-1 
cells for the lung tumor model, in the flank of same background 
wild mice. For both cases, only the live cells were counted deter-
mined by Trypan blue staining.
Tumor growth was supervised regularly following DFCI 
animal protocol until a tumor size of approximately 6 mm in 
length was reached. Mice were then randomized into different 
cohorts. For the direct IT administration method, IT injection of 
CBD (0.1 mg, 5 mg/kg) dissolved in methanol was given using a 
26 G insulin needle (BD Bioscience). Same volume of methanol 
was injected in control group tumors. For SRB-CBD treatment 
method, SRBs with the same dose of CBD as for IT method were 
administered to the tumors using clinical brachytherapy needles 
(IZI Medical Products). A control group of mice with tumors 
were also administered with SRBs loaded with same methanol 
concentration as CBD solution.
After treatment, a Vernier caliper was used to measure the 
length and width of the subcutaneous tumors. Tumor volumes 
were calculated as: (length × width2)/2. Dimension imaginary 
longitude to the leg was designated as length and the perpen-
dicular was for width. The tumors were measured between the 
skin surface layers. The tumor volume was plotted against time.
Animal survival was performed for treatments following 
IACUC-approved protocol, which was predetermined based on 
published evidence justifying such a study design. Tumors reach-
ing >1 cm in diameter or actively bleeding were determined as 
excessive tumor burden and mouse was euthanized following the 
protocol. For IT release studies, CT imaging was carried out using 
the SARRP (Figure 1) with 65 kVp and 0.5 mA. The CT imaging 
was conducted over 1 week.
cT image analysis
The CT images were analyzed using the Preclinical Imalytics 
software. In the image analysis, the segmented tumor was made 
transparent to highlight the SRB. The results clearly depict the 
SRB disintegration in the tumor volume with lapse of time. The 
quantification of the images was performed using MATLAB 
software.
statistical analysis
Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test and Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test 
were performed to analyze statistical significance of the survival 
assay for in vivo lung cancer model with GraphPad prism 
software.
resUlTs
Clonogenic assay results are shown in Figures 2A,B demonstrat-
ing substantially enhanced tumor cell killing when using CBDs 
with RT. Significant synergy is observed in the study arm combin-
ing 2 µg of CBD with RT at 4 Gy. Such synergy may allow for 
greater effective tumor cell killing while reducing the dose of RT. 
Remarkably, 5 µg of CBD was found to achieve greater tumor cell 
killing than 4 Gy of RT. This supports findings in previous studies 
that CBDs can induce apoptosis, with potential mechanism being 
the generation of highly potent reactive oxygen species (9). This 
effect combined with DNA damage by RT could account for the 
observed synergistic outcomes.
The remarkable in vitro study results with and without RT 
followed an exposure of the tumor cells to CBD over a prolonged 
period of 24 h. With view to translating such effective tumor 
 
cell killing in vivo, we hypothesized that using smart biomaterials 
for sustained/prolonged delivery of CBDs in tumors can also 
enhance the effectiveness of in vivo tumor cell kills with CBDs. 
To test this hypothesis, CBD was loaded into SRBs.
The design of the smart biomaterial is illustrated in Figure 3A, 
while actual SRBs with CBD payloads are shown in Figure 3B. 
The result in Figure 3C shows the sustained release of the payload 
over time. Noteworthy is the initial burst release with over 50% 
of the payload released over the first day, followed by a slower 
prolonged release over several days. Such sustained release is

designed to expose tumor cells to the CBDs over a prolonged 
period to enhance therapy outcomes.
Figure 3D shows quicker release results demonstrating poten-
tial for controlled release, e.g., by varying the weighting of the SRB 
polymer component or degree of cross-linking of the smart poly-
mer, to allow for quick or slow release as needed for any treatment 
schedule. Such controlled/customizable release may be useful 
when combining CBDs with other treatment modalities like RT, 
chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Meanwhile, Figure 3E shows 
processed CT images of mice with tumors on both flanks, with 
one of the tumors on the right side (image view) implanted with 
the SRB. The decrease in intensity of this maximum amplitude 
image indicates that overtime the SRB degrades to release the 
payload into the tumor subvolume (Figure 3F).
Further confirmation of the release of CBD is evident in its 
action in Figure 4A, which shows tumor growth inhibition 
results in animal cohorts with CBD-loaded SRB compared to 
cohorts with direct IT administration of the same dose of CBD,

versus control cohorts. Results of separate survival study also sup-
ports this (Figure 4B) comparing mice treated with empty SRBs 
(n = 11), mice treated with CBD (n = 13), versus mice treated 
with CBD-loaded SRB (n = 12). This result shows significantly 
(p < 0.0001) increased survival for the mice with CBD-loaded 
SRBs relative to the other cohorts including control cohort 
(n = 12). These initial lung tumor survival study results support 
the hypothesis that sustained delivery with prolonged exposure 
of tumor cells to CBD may be more effective in inhibiting tumor 
growth than direct IT administration of the same dose of CBD.
Figures 4C,D show initial results from a parallel study with 
pancreatic tumors in mice. Direct IT injection of CBD demon-
strates slight increase survival benefit compared to untreated mice 
(Figure 4C). In another study, the benefit of prolonged exposure 
of tumors to CBD is again observed in Figure 4D with 100% of 
the mice alive in the CBD-SRB cohort, compared to fewer mice 
alive in the CBD (IT) and control group. The result here justifies 
further studies with higher concentrations of CBDs delivered by 
the SRBs which could further enhance tumor cell kill.
DiscUssiOn
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with a dismal 
5-year survival rate of less than 5% (24, 25). Meanwhile lung can-
cer is amongst the top killers, with a growing burden, especially 
in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to treat-
ment (19). There is, thus, great need to develop more effective 
and accessible therapeutic approaches for treating these cancers. 
Our results suggest that the use of a combination of strategies 
could allow for greater therapeutic efficacy when using CBDs for 
cancer treatment. The in vitro study results showing synergistic 
outcomes when using CBDs in combination with RT are in con-
sonance with previous work highlighted in recent reviews (1, 2). 
In one such previous study, synergy was observed in vivo when 
using RT with CBDs in the treatment of brain tumors, in a glioma 
model (26). Over the years, different reports have advocated for 
investigations of combination therapy approaches where such 
synergies could be established toward clinical translation (1, 13).
A significant innovation in the approach to leverage CBDs for 
cancer treatment highlighted by our study is the use of smart bio-
materials loaded with CBDs. In general, smart materials (14) are 
designed to be sensitive to specific stimuli (e.g., tumor microenvi-
ronment, pH, the wavelength, or intensity of incident radiation or an 
electrical or magnetic field). Once activated, they can respond in 
active ways including changing their structure to deliver payloads 
(e.g., CBDs in this case), or other functions that have the potential 
to effectively enhance treatment outcomes. Advancing a smart 
CBD cancer therapy approach with smart biomaterials presents 
a number of advantages toward enhancing therapeutic efficacy. 
First, the sustained delivery of CBDs via this approach will allow 
for prolonged exposure of the tumor cells to CBDs with expected 
enhanced effectiveness in tumor cell kills as seen in our initial 
results. Highlighting the viability of such a sustained delivery 
approach, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
 FigUre 5 | Illustration of innovative approach with potential to significantly enhance therapeutic efficacy using cannabinoids (CBDs). (a) Currently used 
commercially available inert radiotherapy (RT) biomaterials, e.g., fiducials (CIVCO Medical); (B) one design of multifunctional biomaterial [smart biomaterial (SRB)] 
made of Food and Drug Administration-approved biocompatible biodegradable polymer loaded with a payload of CBDs; (c) potential clinical translation pathway is 
envisioned where the smart SRB could simply replace the inert biomaterials currently used for image-guided RT. Such replacement would come at no additional 
inconvenience to cancer patients. Once in place the SRB can be activated to sustainably release its payload as the polymer coating degrades for greater effective 
tumor cell kill working in synergy with RT as highlighted by our study results.

approved biodegradable disks infused with carmustine for the 
treatment of brain tumors (27) for greater effective treatment 
outcomes. Our approach with SRBs could also be developed to 
leverage the antitumor effects of CBDs more effectively.
Second, the in situ delivery afforded using smart biomaterials 
allows direct delivery of CBD payloads to the tumor subvolume 
while minimizing off-target toxicities, as seen with other deliv-
ery approaches like oral or intravenous administration. The 
in situ delivery also ensures that 100% of the payload is delivered 
to the tumor compared to other approaches. This could allow 
for reducing the dose of CBDs used, to further minimize any 
potential toxicities or side effects which have so far limited clini-
cal translation. CBD receptors are not located in the brainstem 
areas which control respiration and, therefore, lethal overdoses 
from CBDs are not common (8, 13). Nevertheless, there are 
CBD receptors in other tissues throughout the body, which may 
lead to toxicities or adverse effects such as tachycardia, hypo-
tension, conjunctival injection, bronchodilation, and decreased 
gastrointestinal motility. Site-targeted delivery via SRBs could 
minimize such adverse effects as well as the psychoactive effects 
that have limited clinical translation efforts. Ongoing work is 
focusing on demonstrating this expected toxicity advantage in 
a large cohort study.
A limitation of the current study is the short-term investi-
gation on the survival. This is partly due to an initial focus to 
explore and demonstrate feasibility to inform further studies. 
With view to clinical translation, further investigations will build 
on the current work for longer term survival studies employing 
CBD-loaded smart biomaterials with and without RT. This will 
also include investigations of other CBDs besides CBD that have 
demonstrated potential as anticancer agents but have not been 
rigorously tested, or have been limited by off-target toxicities, 
which may be minimized with the use of SRBs.
Figure 5 illustrates a potential pathway for clinical translation 
using SRBs that integrates and builds on the results of this study, 
demonstrating the benefits of combining CBDs with RT and smart 
biomaterials. In current clinical practice, inert RT biomaterials 
(fiducials, spacers, beacons) illustrated in Figure 5A are routinely 
employed to ensure geometric accuracy during RT for tumors 
that move during treatment, e.g., lung or pancreatic tumors due to 
 
respiratory motion (28). We propose that these inert RT 
biomaterials could simply be replaced by CBD CBD-loaded 
SRBs (Figure 5B), at virtually no additional inconvenience to 
cancer patients. The multifunctional SRBs will be able to ensure 
geometric accuracy but also sustainably deliver potent CBD 
payloads directly to the tumor with the anticipated benefits of 
greater therapeutic efficacy and minimal toxicities. While our 
initial studies have focused on pancreatic and lung tumors 
(Figure 5C), this approach could be extended to other sites 
where inert RT biomaterials are also currently used, including: 
breast, prostate, and liver cancers. In the previous clinical trial on 
brain tumors (3), CBDs had to be repeatedly administered. Our 
approach could allow for sustained delivery, which will obviate 
the need for repeated administration and be more convenient 
for patients.
The use of smart RT biomaterials for sustained delivery could 
also integrate the use of NP drones (12) loaded with CBDs 
that can bind specifically to tumor cells to deliver their potent 
payloads, enhancing tumor cell kill with minimal off-target 
distribution. The drone technology could also be designed to 
target CBDs to CB1-type receptors expressed on the peripheral 
terminals of nociceptors around the RT planning target volume

for CBD-induced analgesia. It has been shown (29) that CBDs 
mediate analgesia largely via peripheral type 1 CBD receptors in 
nociceptors, so such an approach with sustained delivery could 
also help in pain management for cancer patients.
In the US, an increasing number of states have now legalized 
the use of medical cannabis. This trend has also spread interna-
tionally, with more countries recognizing the medicinal com-
ponents of cannabis and legalizing medical use. Unfortunately, 
medical cannabis research has been lagging in animal or human 
placebo-controlled studies addressing barriers to clinical transla-
tion. Viable pathways to clinical translation for cancer treatment 
should include combination approaches or smart CBD cancer 
therapy that leverages the antitumor effects of CBDs with high 
therapeutic efficacy and minimal side effects.
Altogether, our results offer an approach for leveraging the 
antineoplastic activity of CBDs to achieve enhanced therapeutic 
efficacy during cancer treatment with the possibility of address-
ing toxicity concerns that have hampered clinical translation 
efforts. The potential for using smart RT biomaterials, which 
integrate enhanced tumor cell killing when combining CBDs 
with RT, and delivery with smart biomaterials, provide a 
promising pathway for clinical translation. To this end, ongoing 
work is investigating such SRBs loaded with CBDs, which could 
simply replace currently used inert RT biomaterials during 
image-guided RT, all at no additional inconvenience to cancer 
patients.
