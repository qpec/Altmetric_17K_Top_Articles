2. Whether the tweet was a copy of another tweet (retweet)
3. Whether the tweet mentioned a specific user
4. Whether the tweet included a question mark
5. Whether the tweet included a hash tag
6. The number of words in the tweet
7. Whether the tweet included a URL
8. The top and second level URL (of an expanded URL), if present
9. User attributes:
a. Words and word pairs from the userâ€™s description (User Bio)
b. Whether the user description included a URL
