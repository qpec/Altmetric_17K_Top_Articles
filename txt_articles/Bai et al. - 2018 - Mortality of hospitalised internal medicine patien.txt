Objective To compare inhospital mortality of general 
internal medicine (GIM) patients bedspaced to off-service 
wards with GIM inpatients admitted to assigned GIM 
wards.
Method A retrospective cohort study of consecutive 
GIM admissions between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 
2016 was conducted at a large tertiary care hospital in 
Canada. Inhospital mortality was compared between 
patients admitted to off-service wards (bedspaced) and 
assigned GIM wards using a Cox proportional hazards 
model and a competing risk model. Sensitivity analyses 
included propensity score and pair matching based on 
GIM service team, workload, demographics, time of 
admission, reasons for admission and comorbidities.
Results Among 3243 consecutive GIM admissions, more 
than a third (1125, 35%) were bedspaced to off-service 
wards with the rest (2118, 65%) admitted to assigned GIM 
wards. In hospital, 176 (5%) patients died: 88/1125 (8%) 
bedspaced patients and 88/2118 (4%) assigned GIM ward 
patients. Compared with assigned GIM wards patients, 
bedspaced patients had an HR of 3.42 (95% CI 2.23 to 
5.26; P<0.0001) for inhospital mortality at admission, 
which then decreased by HR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.99; 
P=0.0133) per day in hospital. Competing risk models 
and sensitivity analyses using propensity scores and pair 
matching yielded similar results.
Conclusions Bedspaced patients had significantly 
higher inhospital mortality than patients admitted to 
assigned GIM wards. The risk was highest at admission 
and subsequently declined. The results of this single 
centre study may not be generalisable to other hospitals 
and may be influenced by residual confounding. Despite 
these limitations, the relationship between bedspacing 
and patient outcomes requires investigation at other 
institutions to determine if this common practice 
represents a modifiable patient safety indicator.
IntroductIon
Hospital capacity strain negatively impacts 
quality of care.1 Overcrowding creates 
many challenges to efficient patient navi-
gation of the hospital system from initial 
assessment in the emergency department 
(ED), to admission onto inpatient wards, 
and ultimately to patient discharge. 
Beginning in the ED, overcrowding is 
associated with delayed care and reduced 
survival.2 After admission, patients may 
then become ‘boarders’, who remain in 
EDs after admission while awaiting inpa-
tient beds. ED boarding delays medical 
care, prolongs length of stay and may 
increase mortality.3–6 
When assigned general internal medi-
cine (GIM) ward beds become fully occu-
pied, new patients are often ‘bedspaced’, 
meaning they are admitted to off-service 
inpatient units to free up ED beds.7 8 This 
is a common occurrence across hospi-
tals.8 Bedspaced patients reside in areas 
of the hospital away from assigned GIM 
wards where medical team members 
responsible for their care are usually 
located. 
Allied 
health 
services 
(eg, 
nursing, physiotherapy) for bedspaced 
patients are typically delivered by the 
‘host service’,and they may have limited 
contact and communication with the 
GIM team responsible for patient care.8
Little research exists to assess whether 
bedspacing compromises quality of care 
or patient outcomes. In other areas of 
medicine, patients who are not cared for 
in the appropriate specialised setting may 
have worse quality of care and outcomes; 
for example, stroke patients not on 
specialised stroke services9 and haemo-
dialysis patients on surgical services.10 
Similar issues may apply to bedspaced 
GIM patients.
This study aimed to evaluate the rela-
tionship between bedspacing of GIM 
patients and inhospital mortality.

Original research
at a large Canadian tertiary care hospital. Ethical 
approval was obtained from the institution’s research 
ethics committee. We based our study reporting on the 
REporting of studies Conducted using Observational 
Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guide-
lines for observational studies using routinely collected 
data.11
Setting
A tertiary level, acute-care, university-affiliated 
teaching hospital with a large catchment area exceeding 
500 
000 people in Canada served as the study setting. 
The hospital has 440 inpatient beds and admits more 
than 22 
000 inpatients each year.
The GIM service has 68 beds for four clinical 
teaching unit (CTU) teams, which consist of a staff 
physician, a third year internal medicine resident, a 
second year internal medicine resident, two to three 
first year residents and two to three medical student 
clerks. The CTU teams change every 4 weeks. Staff 
physicians on CTU teams rotate every 2 weeks.
Patient population
We included consecutive adult patients admitted to the 
four GIM CTU teams at the hospital from 1 January 
2015 to 1 January 2016. Patients were excluded if they 
had any of the following:
 
►
Admission to the medical short stay team (anticipated 
length of stay <72 
hours)
 
►
Located in the step down intensive care unit
 
►
Transfer to another service during hospital admission
 
►
Death, discharge or leaving against medical advice be-
fore being transferred to a ward bed
Data sources
Data were obtained from patient electronic medical 
records and the Discharge Abstract Database, an 
administrative database collected for all hospital 
discharges and maintained by the Canadian Institute 
of Health Information (CIHI).12 Data were collected 
on patient demographics, admission diagnosis, comor-
bidities, death in hospital and details of discharge from 
hospital.
Admission and bedspacing
Patients were admitted under one of four CTU teams. 
Patient assignment to CTU teams was based on day of 
admission.
On admission, patients were typically transferred 
from the ED to the GIM ward. When admission 
numbers exceeded assigned GIM ward bed capacity, 
the patient flow manager secured a bed on an off-ser-
vice ward based on services with available beds (with 
medical subspecialty wards given priority over surgical 
wards) and length of time the patient was in the ED 
since admission. In principle according to hospital 
guidelines, patients’ reasons for admission, severity of 
illness, comorbidities, CTU team assignment, plans of 
care in hospital and discharge dispositions were not 
considered in this decision.
The two assigned GIM wards with 68 beds were 
located on geographically consolidated hospital wings 
(wards A and B). If all beds were occupied on the 
assigned GIM wards, patients would be bedspaced to 
off-service ward beds. These patients were defined as 
bedspaced patients.
The medicine off-service wards included:
C: Medicine Short Stay Unit, Alternate Level of 
Care patients
F: Cardiology
I: Neurology, Neurosurgery
D: Haematology/Oncology, Medical Oncology, 
Radiation Oncology, Palliative Care
The surgery off-service wards included:
H: Cardiac Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Vascular 
Surgery
E: Gynaecology Oncology, Plastic Surgery, Urology
G: Otolaryngology, General Surgery
J: Orthopaedic Surgery
The CTU teams are responsible for both the patients 
on assigned GIM wards and those on off-service wards 
admitted under their team. Allied health professionals 
(including nurses, respiratory therapists, physiothera-
pists, occupational therapists and social workers) are 
instead organised by ward location. Therefore, the 
off-service ward’s allied health team would care for 
bedspaced patients.
Patients on assigned GIM wards were sometimes 
bedspaced to an off-service wards when they had their 
medical issues addressed and were awaiting disposi-
tion to free up assigned GIM ward beds for patients 
with active medical issues.
Patients’ room locations were extracted from the 
hospital database to classify patients as being either 
on an assigned GIM ward or bedspaced. If a patient 
was transferred to another room, the last room loca-
tion temporally closest to the end of their hospital stay 
(ie, death or discharge) would be recorded as their 
room, because the last room would have more impact 
on death or discharge compared with previous room 
locations.
Variable definitions
Capacity ratio was defined as the number of GIM inpa-
tients (off-service and assigned GIM wards) divided by 
total capacity of assigned GIM wards (68 beds) on day 
of admission for each patient.
Case mix group (CMG) and resource intensity weight 
(RIW) were based on CMG methodology as described 
by CIHI.13–16 Admission diagnoses were organised into 
CMGs based on International Classification of Disease 
10th Revision Canadian version (ICD-10-CA) codes,17 
complications and procedure codes, while RIW was a 
weighted summary measure representing the relative 
value of resources a patient was expected to consume 
based on their age, CMG and comorbidities.

Original research
ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes present at and after 
admission for each patient were used to calculate the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)18 using an estab-
lished coding algorithm.19
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause inhospital 
mortality. Patients were followed until death in 
hospital, discharge, or for up to 365 days following 
hospital admission, whichever came first. Length of 
stay was calculated as time from admission to discharge 
or death in hospital. Readmissions to the same hospital 
within 30 days were recorded for patients who were 
discharged alive.
Statistical analysis
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to char-
acterise inhospital mortality. The survival analysis 
assumed non-informative censoring.20 The prognosis 
of patients who were discharged may be different than 
that of patients who remained hospitalised. The poten-
tial impact of informative censoring was addressed in 
a competing risk model that accounted for competing 
risk events that would preclude the event of interest.20 
Specifically, as a secondary analysis, a competing risk 
model was used to describe inhospital mortality and 
time to discharge, where possible end points included 
being alive in hospital on day 365, dying in hospital 
or being discharged alive. Based on a cumulative inci-
dence function, a subdistribution HR (sHR) was calcu 
lated based on the Fine and Gray model.21 Assump-
tion of proportional hazard was tested based on 
weighted Schoenfeld residuals for the Cox propor-
tional hazards22 and competing risk models.23 To 
account for non-proportional hazards, an interaction 
of bedspacing variable with time in a linear relation-
ship was added in the Cox proportional hazards and 
competing risk models.24
As sensitivity analyses, a propensity score for room 
allocation (bedspaced vs assigned GIM ward) was esti-
mated using a multivariable logistic regression model.25 
The following covariates were included in the model 
: age, sex, admission month, admission on a weekend, 
capacity ratio, cumulative CCI score, individual CCI 
comorbidity, RIW and CMG. CMG had a factor for 
each of the 52 most common groups, which accounted 
for approximately 80% of all admissions. Bedspaced 
patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio to assigned GIM 
ward patients using nearest neighbour matching with a 
specified calliper width of 0.2 times SD of the logit of 
the propensity score.26 Covariate balance between the 
two groups was assessed by standardised difference with 
a threshold of 0.10 for significant imbalance.27 The two 
groups matched by propensity scores were compared 
using the Cox proportional hazards and competing risk 
models.
As another sensitivity analysis, bedspaced patients 
were matched to assigned GIM ward patients in a 
1:1 ratio, so that each matched pair was admitted in 
the same 4-week rotation block under the same CTU 
team with the same CMG. This ensured the same CTU 
team for each matched pair. In cases where multiple 
matched pair combinations were possible, the matched 
pair with the closest admission dates was selected. 
Thus, each matched pair was admitted under the same 
CTU team at a similar time to reflect similar workload. 
The two groups were compared with the Cox propor-
tional hazards and competing risk models.
Our study data were complete without any missing 
data, so statistical handling of missing data was not 
applicable.
All reported CIs were two-sided 95% intervals and 
all tests were two-sided with a P<0.05 
significance 
level. All analyses were done with R V
.3.2.3 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
Matching was done using the package matchit.28 
Competing risk analysis was done using the packages 
cmprsk29 and crrSC.30

Patient characteristics
From 1 January 2015 to 1 January 2016, 4925 patients 
were admitted under the GIM service, of which 3243 
patients were included in the analysis (figure 1). Of 
these 3243 patients, over a third (1125, 35%) were 
bedspaced to off-service wards while the rest (2118, 
65%) were admitted to assigned GIM wards (table 1 
and online supplementary appendix table 1). Numbers 
of bedspaced patients admitted under each off-service 
ward are listed in online supplementary appendix 
table 2.
Bed-spacing
Over the 1-year period, the daily proportion of 
bedspaced patients had a median of 32% (IQR 
28%–35%), minimum of 19% and maximum of 
47% (online supplementary appendix figure 1). Daily 
numbers of GIM inpatients were consistently over 
the capacity of 68 patients except for 5 days in May 
(online supplementary appendix figure 2).
Bed moves were uncommon and occurred equally 
in both directions. Only 365 (11%) patients were 
on different wards at time of discharge or death than 
their admission wards: 195 (6%) were originally 
bedspaced and then transferred to assigned GIM 
wards,while 170 (5%) were originally on assigned 
GIM wards and then bedspaced to off-service wards.
Outcomes
Of 3243 GIM inpatients, 176 (5%) patients died in 
hospital including 88/1125 (8%) bedspaced patients 
and 88/2118 (4%) assigned GIM wards patients. Inhos-
pital mortality rates for individual wards and each CCI 
strata are listed in online supplementary appendix 
tables 2 and 3, respectively. Deaths occurring among

assigned GIM ward and bedspaced patients are illus-
trated in online supplementary appendix figure 3.
Of the 3067 patients who were discharged alive, 
205/1037 (20%) bedspaced patients and 372/2030 
(18%) assigned GIM wards patients were readmitted 
to the same hospital within 30 days (P=0.3582).
In an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model, 
bedspaced patients had significantly greater inhos-
pital mortality than assigned GIM wards patients (HR 
2.24; 95% 
CI 1.67 to 3.02; P<0.0001). Testing for 
non-proportionality was significant (P=0.0040), indi-
cating that the relationship between bedspacing and 
death was time-dependent. After adding an interaction 
term of bedspacing with time, the HR for mortality of 
bedspaced patients was 3.42 (95% CI 2.23 to 5.26; 
P<0.0001) at admission, which then decreased by HR 
of 0.97 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.99; P=0.0133) per day. The 
HRs for time periods of 0–7 days, 7–14 days, 14–21 
days and 21–28 days were 3.26 (95% CI 2.10 to 5.07), 
2.68 (95% CI 1.39 to 5.16), 1.43 (95% CI 0.53 to 
3.86) and 1.16 (95% CI 0.40 to 3.34), respectively.
Cumulative incidence functions describing dying in 
hospital and being discharged alive for bedspaced and 
GIM assigned wards patients are shown in figure 2. 
In an unadjusted competing risk model, bedspaced 
patients had a significantly higher risk of inhospital 
mortality than assigned GIM wards patients with an 
sHR of 1.94 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.61; P<0.0001) for 
dying in hospital and an sHR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 
1.06; P=0.5656) for being discharged alive. Testing 
for non-proportionality was significant for a linear 
relationship with time (P<0.0001). After adding an 
interaction term of bedspacing with time, the sHR for 
dying in hospital of bedspaced patients was 3.18 (95% 
CI 2.03 to 4.98; P<0.0001) at admission, which then 
decreased by an sHR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99; 
P=0.0124) per day. The sHR of bedspaced patients 
for being discharged alive was 1.14 (95% CI 1.02 to 
1.26; P=0.0210) at admission, which then decreased 
by an sHR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98 to 0.99; P=0.0002) 
per day.
Propensity score matching
Based on propensity score, 1093 bedspaced patients 
were matched to 1093 assigned GIM wards patients 
(table 2  and online supplementary appendix table 4). 
The maximum standardised difference of matched 
variables was 0.0579 (5.79%), reflecting good balance 
on measured baseline characteristics.
In the propensity-matched sample, 138/2186 (6%) 
patients died in hospital: 87/1093 (8%) for bedspaced 
patients and 51/1093 (5%) for assigned GIM wards 
patients.
In a Cox proportional hazards model using the 
propensity-matched sample, the HR for mortality of 
bedspaced patients was 3.20 (95% CI 1.92 to 5.33; 
P<0.0001) at admission, which then decreased by 
an HR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.99; P=0.0146) per 
day.
In a competing risk model using the propen-
sity-matched sample, bedspaced patients had an 
sHR for inhospital mortality of 2.83 (95% CI 1.67 to 
4.79; P=0.0001) at admission, which then decreased 
by an sHR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; P=0.0302) 
per day. The sHR for discharged alive of bedspaced 
patients was 1.13 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.27; P=0.0530)

(95% CI 0.98 to 1.00; P=0.0038) per day.
Pair matching
Matching by 4-week rotation blocks, CTU team and 
CMG, 456 bedspaced patients were matched to 456 
assigned GIM wards patients (table 3 and online supple-
mentary appendix table 5). Although the two groups 
were not matched by comorbidities, the proportions of 
patients with CCI comorbidities were similar between 
the two groups. The maximum standardised difference 
of comorbidities was 0.1087. Among matched pairs, 
the median difference in days between admission dates 
was 5.00 days (IQR 2.00–11.00 days). Of the 456 
matched pairs, 168 (37%) pairs were admitted in the 
same week.
In the paired matching sample, 50/912 (5%) 
patients died in hospital: 36/456 (8%) bedspaced 
patients and 14/456 (3%) assigned GIM wards 
patients.
In a Cox proportional hazards model, compared with 
assigned GIM wards patients, the HR for mortality of 
bedspaced patients was 3.84 (95% CI 1.42 to 10.38; 
P=0.0080) at admission, which then decreased by 
an HR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; P=0.5485) per 
day.

Original research
In a competing risk model, bedspaced patients had 
an sHR for inhospital mortality of 3.73 (95% CI 
1.38 to 10.09; P=0.0096) at admission, which then 
decreased by an sHR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; 
P=0.3589) per day. The sHR of bedspaced patients 
for being discharged alive was 1.11 (95% CI 0.90 to 
1.37; P=0.3365) at admission, which decreased by 
an sHR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.00; P=0.0477) 
per day.
Sensitivity analyses
Comparison of bedspaced and assigned GIM wards 
patients using restricted mean time survival that did 
not assume proportional hazards again demonstrated 
shorter survival time for bedspaced patients (online 
supplementary appendix text 1).
Comparison of bedspaced and assigned GIM wards 
patients based on their first ward bed (instead of 
ward bed at discharge or death) yielded similar results 
(online supplementary appendix table 6).
An analysis of matched pairs admitted in the same 
week (to ensure the same staff physician for both 
matched patients)showed similar results (online 
supplementary appendix table 7).
dIscussIon
In this retrospective cohort study, the risk for inhos-
pital mortality among bedspaced patients was approxi-
mately three times that of patients admitted to assigned 
GIM wards in the first week of admission, which then 
decreased to approximately the same risk by the third 
week. This result was consistent across multiple anal-
yses that employed competing risk models, propensity 
score matching and pair matching.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to docu-
ment heightened mortality associated with the practice 
of bedspacing.
The CCI Score and length of stay in our study 
were lower than those reported in some individual 
tertiary Canadian centres,31 32 but higher than the 
average reported in a multicentre study of 11 hospi-
tals in Ontario.33 Our inhospital mortality rate of 5%

Original research
approximates the inhospital mortality rate on GIM 
services in Canadian academic tertiary acute care 
hospitals.32
This study has several strengths. First, the large 
sample size allowed for precise estimates. Second, 
our study recruited patients over a 1-year period. The 
admitting diagnoses, prognoses and outcomes may 
differ depending on month and season. Data over a 
1-year period allowed examination and adjustment 
for trends over time. Third, the findings remained 
robust using Cox proportional hazards and competing 
risk models with adjustment for many potential 
confounders using propensity score matching and pair 
matching. The propensity score and pair matching 
ensured that the two groups were balanced in terms 
of prognostic factors including demographics, comor-
bidity, care provider, workload, time of admission and 
reason for admission.
Several study limitations merit emphasis. First, this 
study used data from a retrospective discharge data-
base. The database was not created specifically for our 
research question. However, the data collection and 
verification were rigorous, consistent and complete, as 
it was based on a standardised protocol by CIHI.12 All 
of the data relevant to our research were collected by 
the database.
Second, there may be residual confounders. As an 
example, bedspacing may be more common during 
periods of higher patient influx, when the heavier 
caseload may have led to worse outcomes. However, 
the temporal trend showed a constant trend in patient 
volume above capacity of 68 beds and the proportion of 
bedspaced patients with few significant spikes (online 
supplementary appendix figures 1 and 2). Moreover, 
we adjusted for workload by including a capacity ratio 
in the propensity score and by pair matching (where 
each matched pair was admitted at a similar time under 
the same CTU team). Boarding time in the emergency 
room may be another confounder. Patients with longer 
boarding time may be more likely to be bedspaced 
to off-service wards, where the boarding time led to 
a higher mortality. We excluded patients who were 
discharged or died in the emergency room. Thus, all 
patients were alive on completion of transfer to the 
hospital ward. More than 85% of inhospital deaths 
occurred after 2 days in hospital. Since all patients 
were alive after transfer to the hospital ward and the 
majority of deaths occurred after 2 days of hospital 
stay, it would be unlikely for cause of death to be due 
to care during boarding in the emergency room and 
more likely for the cause of death to be related to the 
care received in the hospital ward. Another possible 
confounder would be preferential bedspacing of sicker 
patients, which could account for higher mortality. 
However, this was unlikely given that bedspacing 
decisions were not based on disease severity. Although 
disease severity was not adjusted, the comorbidity 
score and reason for admission were similar between 
the propensity-matched groups. Our primary anal-
ysis did not account for transfer of patients between 
off-service and assigned GIM wards. However, trans-
fers occurred in only 11% of patients and went in both 
directions. Sensitivity analysis based on first ward bed 
yielded similar results (online supplementary appendix 
table 6). Transfer between the off-service and GIM 
wards would make the two groups more similar to one

another making it more difficult to detect a difference, 
so results would be conservative.
Third, our study was based on a single academic 
acute care hospital, which limits the generalisability of 
the results.
There may be several reasons for bedspaced patients 
to have a higher risk of mortality. First, off-service 
wards were geographically separated from the CTU 
teams’ usual rounding area, which may have decreased 
the frequency and duration of patient contact and 
interaction. Decreased patient contacts in situations 
such as boarding in EDs and isolation precautions for 
infection control have been linked to increased rates 
of adverse events and higher mortality.6 34 Second, 
bedspacing may reduce the frequency and quality of 
communication between CTU medical personnel and 
unfamiliar allied health team members (especially 
nurses) who host these patients on off-service wards. 
Inadequate communication between nurses and 
physicians has been associated with higher inpatient 
mortality.35 36 On the GIM wards, daily ‘bullet rounds’ 
typically occur Monday to Friday. At these rounds, the 
medical and allied healthcare teams discuss and update 
patient care plans daily. An interdisciplinary approach 
has been shown to decrease mortality.37 These bullet 
rounds would omit bedspaced patients, and there-
fore these patients would not receive the benefits of a 
comprehensive team approach. Third, the allied health 
team members on off-service wards may provide lower 
quality of care due to different skill sets and lack of 
experience caring for GIM inpatients. Inexperience 
with managing specialised medical issues, such as 
care for haemodialysis patients on surgical wards, has 
led to care lapses that predispose patients to adverse 
events.10 Lastly, for an acutely sick GIM patient, the 
highest workload in terms of new investigations and 
clinical instability are often compressed into the first 
few days post admission. Bedspaced GIM patients are 
often bedspaced at the start of admission. Less frequent 
clinical monitoring by the team due to geographical 
barriers at this vulnerable period may increase the risk 
of adverse outcomes. We hypothesise that a combi-
nation of these factors may have contributed to the 
observed increase in mortality for bedspaced patients. 
The magnitude of the risk is greater than we had 
anticipated based on the presumed mechanisms, and 
there may be a complex interplay of various factors 
contributing to this striking increase in mortality. The 
limitations of this single centre study such as residual 
confounding or other unforeseen factors may have 
contributed to this surprisingly large mortality risk. 
Pending further study at other institutions, cautious 
interpretation of our results is warranted.
Our study showed that the highest risk of mortality 
for bedspaced patients occurred within the first week 
of admission. We hypothesise that internal medicine 
patients were most medically active within the first 
days of admission requiring intensive investigations 
and management. Bedspacing may have the most 
impact during this critical period of active workup and 
management resulting in a front-loaded mortality risk.
Interestingly, based on the competing risk model, 
the bedspaced patients had a slightly higher rate of 
discharge compared with assigned GIM patients 
initially at time of admission. However, this trend was 
not statistically significant for the propensity-matched 
and pair-matched analyses. It may be that the knowl-
edge of taking up a bed from another service gave 
the CTU teams additional motivation to address the 
bedspaced patients’ medical issues and discharge these 
patients sooner.
This study highlights the importance of managing 
patient flow and bed mapping. Future interventional 
or quasi-experimental studies may help demonstrate 
the impact of patient flow and bed mapping policies 
on patient quality of care and outcomes. The number 
of bedspaced off-service ward GIM patients may be a 
clinically important and potentially modifiable quality 
marker. Future hospital policies focusing on patient 
flow should prioritise getting patients to the appro-
priate assigned ward beds, which may contribute to 
improved patient outcomes.
Our findings should be interpreted with caution, 
because they are based on a single centre. Each 
hospital has unique features relating to hospital 
capacity, bed mapping, admission processes, organ-
isation of healthcare teams and training of health-
care professionals. Small single centred studies tend 
to overinflate the estimated effect due to a greater 
risk of bias.38 39 It is not uncommon for results of 
non-randomised studies to be contradicted by future 
studies.40 Therefore, future studies with multiple 
sites including both academic and community hospi-
tals are necessary to ensure the generalisability of 
these findings. Future studies should also examine 
reasons for the differences in mortality, to help 
design strategies to minimise risk when bedspacing is 
deemed unavoidable.
In conclusion, we observed substantially higher 
inhospital mortality for GIM patients bedspaced to 
off-service wards. Future studies in other hospitals 
should help clarify mechanisms that influence the 
association between bedspacing and adverse outcomes 
including mortality. In this way, we may be able to 
identify modifiable contributors to this relationship 
and thereby improve patient safety.
