Strictures of a microchannel impose fierce competition
to select for highly motile sperm
Meisam Zaferani1, Gianpiero D. Palermo2, Alireza Abbaspourrad1*
Investigating sperm locomotion in the presence of external fluid flow and geometries simulating the female re-
productive tract can lead to a better understanding of sperm motion during fertilization. Using a microfluidic
device featuring a stricture that simulates the fluid mechanical properties of narrow junctions inside the female
reproductive tract, we documented the gate-like role played by the stricture in preventing sperm with motilities
below a certain threshold from advancing through the stricture to the other side (i.e., fertilization site). All the
slower sperm accumulate below (i.e., in front of) the stricture and swim in a butterfly-shaped path between
the channel walls, thus maintaining the potential for penetrating the stricture and ultimately advancing toward
the fertilization site. Accumulation below the stricture occurs in a hierarchical manner so that dense concentra-
tions of sperm with higher velocities remain closer to the stricture, with more sparsely distributed arrays of lower-
velocity sperm lagging behind.
INTRODUCTION
In mammals, the number of sperm entering the female reproductive
tract (~60 million to 100 million) exceeds the number of available
eggs (one egg during every ovulation) by far (1). Accordingly, only
a few sperm can fertilize the available eggs. Since motility is required
for sperm to traverse the female genital tract (2), it has been thought
that normal motility is one of the critical properties that determine
the sperm’s fertilization chances (3). Consequently, motility-based
competition must take place so that sperm with higher motility have
a greater chance of fertilizing the egg (4).
In addition to motility, sperm require steering mechanisms to
swim on the correct path toward the egg (5). Chemotaxis (6) has been
identified as a steering mechanism for the sperm of marine inverte-
brates, such as sea urchins (7–13). However, its role in the guidance
of mammalian sperm toward the egg is disputable (14). In mammals,
the fluid mechanical steering mechanisms of sperm, including the
tendency to follow rigid boundaries (15, 16) and swim upstream (i.e.,
sperm rheotaxis) (17–19), are known to be responsible for guiding sperm
toward the egg. Swimming along rigid boundaries enables sperm to
move parallel to the walls of the female reproductive tract, and the rheo-
tactic behavior leads to their ability to swim opposite to the directional
flow of secreted genital mucus (20–23). Since the fluid mechanical
steering mechanisms solely guide motile sperm, all nonmotile sperm
are carried away by the genital mucus flow, while the healthy, motile
sperm advance toward the fertilization site (23). This ability of the mo-
tile sperm to swim upstream has been used to design new microfluidic
tool to hasten the process of sperm separation required for assisted
reproductive technologies (24).
To date, mammalian sperm locomotion, including its fluid
mechanical steering mechanisms, has been studied using microfluidic
technology (16, 18). However, the sperm rheotaxis–based navigation
in the presence of a fluid flow has been examined exclusively in
straight swimming channels (17, 20, 21, 23), whereas the biophysical/
fluid mechanical conditions of the female reproductive tract are
more complex (25, 26). The sperm swimming channel within the fe-
male reproductive tract does not have constant dimensions, but
rather varies in width. Deviation in width of the swimming channel
results in alteration of the flow magnitude, which consequently in-
fluences the sperm rheotactic and boundary swimming behavior.
Therefore, investigation of sperm locomotion in a channel that
mimics the biophysical aspects of the swimming channel in vivo will
reveal the impact of the channel geometry on the sperm-steering me-
chanisms. By the same token, the effect of the fluid mechanical prop-
erties of the female reproductive tract on motility-based competition
among sperm cells can be revealed.
In this study, we examine sperm motion, including their fluid
mechanical steering mechanisms, by solving sperm equations of mo-
tion inside a microfluidic design featuring variable width. In addi-
tion, by experimentally observing sperm locomotion within the
design, we show that strictures inside the sperm swimming channel
play a gate-like role. That is, sperm slower than a threshold velocity
cannot pass through the stricture, revealing the function of narrow
junctions in the reproductive tract in selecting for highly motile
sperm. Sperm slower than the threshold velocity resist against the
flow and accumulate below (i.e., in front of) the stricture in a hierar-
chical manner in which motility-based competition becomes fiercer
among highly motile sperm.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We designed and fabricated a microfluidic device with 30 mm in
depth using conventional soft lithography that featured three eye-
shaped compartments connected to each other by a progressive
narrowing in width of the microchannel (Fig. 1A). The width of
the channel in the narrowest section (i.e., the stricture) was 40 mm,
while the maximum width of each compartment was 300 mm. The
angle of the stricture mouth was ~ 80 °. The velocity field of the sperm
medium (i.e., shear rate along the^
z and^
y directions) within each stric-
ture was designed to be high enough to act as a barrier so that no
sperm can pass through. The velocity field within the microfluidic
channel was obtained by solving the conservation of momentum
and mass equations with no-slip boundary conditions using finite
element method simulations. The velocity field in an X-Y cut plane at
a Z position corresponding to half the channel depth is demonstrated
in Fig. 1A, which shows that the mean velocity field increases as the

 width of the channel decreases. In Fig. 1B, the velocity profile of
the fluid in four different cross sections is demonstrated using con-
tour levels (X = 0, 25, 50, and 75 mm). According to the simulations,
the maximum velocity field (125 mm/s) occurred in the stricture of the
channel (X = 0) and decreased to as low as 20 mm/s at X = 300 mm.
To use these numerical results for simulating the rheotactic behavior
of the sperm, we extracted the shear rate of the fluid on the top sur-
face of the chip in the^
z direction using gz ¼ ∂v
∂z, as shown in Fig. 1C,
in which v is sperm medium velocity field. Moreover, we found the
shear rate near the sidewalls using gn ¼ ∂v
∂n, in which n is the perpen-
dicular distance from the sidewall.^
n, the unit vector perpendicular to
the sidewalls, is depicted in Fig. 1D.
To simulate the swimming path of the sperm, we assumed that the
sperm location was influenced by its propulsive velocity, the velocity
field of the medium, and the velocity components induced by the
hydrodynamic interactions with the sidewalls. These hydrodynamic
interactions with the sidewalls are created from the contribution of
the microswimmer to the fluid flow in the presence of boundaries.
Consequently, the time derivative of the sperm location can be writ-
ten using the following equation

height and the d value reported for sperm is ~10 mm (fig. S1). The two

duced by hydrodynamic interactions of the sperm with the sidewalls,
and the terms r⊥ and r′⊥ are the perpendicular distances of the sperm
from the sidewalls, as shown in Fig. 1D.
To determine the drift velocities induced by the hydrodynamic in-
teractions at large distances from the sidewalls (r⊥ or r′⊥ > 50 mm), we
first calculated the contribution of the microswimmer to the fluid flow

 by using a dipole pusher swimmer model proposed by Berke et al.
(27). In the dipole pusher swimmer model, the flow produced by
the swimmer is modeled by two forces with equal magnitudes and
opposite directions that act on two points in the fluid with a distance
equalto the swimmerlength. Fora point force, the solution of the Stokes
equation is its Green’s function, known as “Stokeslet,” and the solution
for a dipole swimmer is thus Stokes doublet. For the sake of simplicity,
we then used the image method to consider the existence of the side-
walls and satisfy the no-slip boundary condition on the sidewall. By
neglecting the reflection of each image system on the other sidewall,
we found the hydrodynamic interaction terms (drift velocities) to be
inversely correlated to the perpendicular distance of the sperm from
the sidewalls, as described by

in which P is the dipole strength of the sperm, h is the viscosity of the
sperm medium, and q and q′ are the angles between the swimming
direction of the sperm and the sidewalls. On the basis of Eqs. 2 and 3,
when |cos q| ≤ 1/√ 3, the sidewalls repel the sperm; otherwise, they
attract it. To calculate the vertical distance of the sperm from the
sidewalls, we found the microswimmer’s minimum distance from
the sidewalls at each point simulated in the channel.
However, the dipole swimmer model as a far-field approximation is
not accurate at distances closer to the wall (r⊥ or r′⊥ < 50 mm). There-
fore, we further developed a model based on the lubrication approx-
imation (fig. S2) to obtain the drift velocities imposed on the swimmer
at near-wall conditions (see the Supplementary Materials for more de-
tails). On the basis of our model, the drift velocities imposed on the
swimmer at near-wall conditions can be described by

We considered the magnitude of the v

sperm as a constant value over
time, since the sperm energy loss was not considered in this paper.
However, sperm swimming direction evolves with time and the sperm
angular velocity is affected by its fluid mechanical response to an
external fluid, intrinsic rotation, and response to the sidewalls (i.e.,
hydrodynamic interactions). Therefore, and on the basis of the super-
position principle, the angular velocity of the sperm at each point
between the sidewalls can be described by

in which WRH is the rheotactic angular velocity caused by the re-
sponse of the sperm to the fluid flow. Bukatin et al. (20) have ob-
served that under a flow reversal condition, half of the sperm
make a left-hand U-turn, whereas the other half make a right-hand
turn based on their initial alignment. We thus assume that the sperm
rotation toward the left- and right-hand sides obeys a similar rate
(we examine the accuracy of this assumption in the following exper-
imental sections). This sperm rotation rate has been described with
Eq. 7 [by Tung et al. (21) and Bukatin et al. (20)]

The intrinsic rotation (WIN) is the angular velocity created from
asymmetry in the beating pattern of the sperm tail. The sperm
flagellum does not feature a sine wave with a single frequency
and phase. Rather, the mechanical wave produced by the sperm
tail encompasses sine waves with different frequencies and initial
phases. Consequently, the sperm tail beating pattern is asymmetric,
which yields to an intrinsic rotation (see the “Intrinsic angular ve-
locity” section of the Supplementary Materials) (14). This rotation
can be modeled by an intrinsic angular velocity that is described
by Eq. 8

ð8Þ
in which xt is tangential friction coefficient of the sperm medium,
yn is the amplitude of the nth harmonic of the sperm tail, and f is
the phase difference between the main sine wave and the nth har-
monic. Since f is an arbitrary parameter, WIN can vary from −Wmax
to Wmax, which means that its rotation can be either counter-
clockwise or clockwise. To experimentally measure the intrinsic an-
gular velocity (movie S1 and figs. S3 and S4), we extracted the
trajectories of 28 sperm trapped in an area with no background
fluid flow. The majority of the sperm were moving clockwise, and
the value that we measured for those sperm was 〈WIN〉 = 0.12 ±
0.06 s−1. Accordingly, the absolute value of the intrinsic angular
velocity in all simulations was assumed to be less or equal to
〈WIN〉 (|WIN| ≤ 〈WIN〉 = Wmax).
To find the rotation induced in the swimmer caused by the
hydrodynamic interaction, we used the dipole swimmer model
for distances adequately far from the sidewalls, while for near-wall
conditions, the lubrication theory was used. Therefore, the total
rotation caused by the presence of the sidewalls can be written
out as

as proposed by Berke et al. (27). Otherwise (r⊥ < 50 mm), on the
basis of the model explained in the Supplementary Materials (lu-
brication approximation), we used eq. S13 to describe the rota-
tion. By calculating the rotation induced by the other sidewall
using a similar manner, the rotation induced on the sperm by hy-
drodynamic interactions was reflected in the calculations.
As sperm is a large microswimmer (in comparison to bacteria and
other swimming particles), and the role of noisy fluctuations is impor-
tant for swimmers with size much smaller than sperm, we neglect the
white zero-mean Gaussian noise in rotation of the sperm head (12).

For WIN = 0 and the initial sperm orientation parallel to the sidewall,
the trajectory calculated for the sperm with different velocities is
presented in Fig. 1F. Since the shear rate within the stricture is too
high for sperm to pass, the swimmer detaches from the sidewall at
the vicinity of the stricture and is swept away by the flow until it
reaches the other sidewall. The sperm trajectory depicted in Fig.
1F shows that the location of the initial contact point of the sperm,
and this sidewall is not linearly related to the sperm velocity. That is,
as the sperm velocity declines, the sperm are increasingly carried
away by the fluid flow. To demonstrate the impact of intrinsic rota-
tion on the sperm locomotion, the trajectories of the swimmers with
velocities of 40, 50, and 60 mm/s are also depicted in Fig. 1G for
|WIN| ≤ Wmax. As can be seen, the effect of intrinsic rotation is more
substantial on slower sperm (40 mm/s), whereas the increase/decrease
in location of the initial contact point caused by WIN is smaller for
faster sperm (60 mm/s).
Upon arrival to the opposing sidewall, the shear rate along ^
n (i.e., gn)
starts rotating the sperm upstream. Depending on the angle between
the sperm orientation and the sidewall at the contact point (Fig. 1H,
top), and the sperm velocity, which determines the location of the
contact point, the rotation time will vary (Fig. 1H, bottom). In Fig.
1H (top), the initial angle of the sperm with the sidewall is depicted
for different velocities, with the red, green, and blue curves
corresponding to WIN = −Wmax, 0, and Wmax, respectively. The evo-
lution of the angle between the sperm orientation and the sidewall at
the contact point is determined by Eq. 5, in which gz is replaced with
gn and the rotation rate obtained from lubrication theory. Therefore,
the time required for the sperm to reorient itself upstream is the time
required to decrease its angle with the sidewall from a0 tod

(fig.
S1). After the upstream orientation, the sperm starts following the
sidewall. This boundary movement is simply determined by the
shear rate along the ^
n direction multiplied by d subtracted from its
propulsive velocity. Last, the total time required for sperm to return
to its initial X coordinate (A → C), t is shown in Fig. 1I for different
sperm velocities. t includes the time required for sperm to transfer
from one sidewall to the other (tt), rotate upstream at the contact
point B/D (tr), and follow the boundary in the stricture direction
(tf). The time required for sperm to return to the initial X and Y
coordinates is 2 × t.
On the basis of the simulation, sperm movement below the
stricture—i.e., the hydrodynamic barrier—is composed of three dif-
ferent modes: (i) transfer mode, in which the sperm detaches from
the sidewall, becomes swept back by the flow, and reaches the oppos-
ing sidewall; (ii) rotation mode, which involves sperm rotation around
its head (i.e., the pivot) at the contact point; and (iii) boundary
swimming mode. When sperm motion begins at point A, its initial
orientation is parallel to the sidewall, as can be seen in Fig. 1D. The
high shear rate at the mouth of the stricture causes the sperm to be

 swept back to point B on the opposing sidewall (i.e., transfer
mode), at which point it stops moving perpendicular to the BC
sidewall and starts rotating counterclockwise (i.e., rotation mode).
By rotating near the wall, the sperm orients its direction parallel to
the BC sidewall and begins moving along it in the direction of the
stricture (i.e., boundary swimming mode). Upon arrival at point C,
it detaches from the sidewall (similar to point A) because of the
high shear rate of the structure and begins swimming toward the
AD sidewall again. This periodic motion takes on a butterfly-
shaped path (A → B → C → D → A) and continues until the
sperm has no more energy to swim.
For a given angle between the two sidewalls (b), only sperm with
velocities in a specific range can move in butterfly-shaped paths
(fig. S5). The upper limit of this range is determined by the shear rate
in the stricture. The lower limit of the range, however, is determined by
two conditions: (i) proximity to the stricture, and (ii) return-ability
conditions. The proximity condition determines the velocity of all
sperm that can become proximate to the stricture, while the return-
ability condition means that at points B and D, the shear rate is
adequate to reorient sperm toward upstream. Since the shear rate
outside the stricture decreases, depending on the angle, sperm can
get close to the stricture. By defining the proximity zone as x < 5 mm
(the average size of the bull sperm head), for b ~ 80°, all the sperm
with velocities between ~30 and 80 mm/s were able to become prox-
imate to the stricture. By considering the return-ability condition, we
observed that among the sperm with velocities in this range, the fluid
flow can reorient only sperm with velocities higher than 40 mm/s at
point B (and D) in Fig. 1D. The angle between the swimming direc-
tion and the sidewall at point B (and D) for sperm with motilities
slower than 40 mm/s becomes greater than 90°, and the shear rate
in these points is inadequate to reorient the sperm upstream. Con-
sequently, sperm slower than 40 mm/s follow the boundary in the
downstream direction.
Given the similarity between this stricture to the junctions of the
sperm’s path toward the site of fertilization, and the direction of the
fluid flow, which simulates the mucus outflux within the tract, the final
goal of the sperm in this situation is to pass through the stricture and
advance toward the site of fertilization, or at least to maintain its loca-
tion nearby the stricture. Since it is known that no sperm with velocities
in the range of 40 to 80 mm/s can pass through the stricture, we defined
the ability of the sperm to remain close to the stricture mouth as a com-
petition index (CI). Since the main path of the sperm toward the fertil-
ization site is in the �^
x direction, we projected the sperm periodic
motion onto the x axis, as can be seen in the schematic of sperm motion
in Fig. 2A. Given the total period of the sperm motion (T = t), and ne-
glecting the translational diffusivity of the sperm (28), the probability of
the sperm to be closer to the stricture than at x = a can be defined as

values of a as a function of sperm velocity, the results of which are
shown in Fig. 2B.
We also experimentally observed the butterfly-shaped motion de-
scribed by the simulation in our microfluidic device. To observe all
the sperm with motilities in the range of 40 to 80 mm/s swim in butterfly-
shaped paths and demonstrate rheotactic behavior and to perform
comprehensive experimental characterization of this swimming behav-
ior, we designed the flow rate such that the shear rate of the stricture was
8s−1. This shear rate is high enough to prevent all the sperm from pass-
ing through. Furthermore, given the shear rate within the stricture was
8s−1, the stricture mouth angle was chosen to be equal to ~ 80 ° so that
all the sperm with motilities in the range of 40 to 80 mm/s were able to
exhibit rheotactic behavior and thus swim in a butterfly-shaped path.
Although the butterfly-shaped swimming path was also discernible at
different stricture mouth angles, the motility range of the sperm that
exhibit such a motion was smaller than 40 to 80 mm/s, which lowers
the comprehensiveness of our study. The butterfly-shaped motion of
a bull sperm with a velocity of 54 mm/s is demonstrated in Fig. 3 (A and
B). Figure 3A is a combined image of the sperm location at 23 dif-
ferent frames, and Fig. 3B is the corresponding schematic of the
sperm swimming pattern based on Fig. 3A for better visualization.
As can be seen, the butterfly-shaped path is left-right symmetric, con-
firming the assumption that we made regarding the sperm featuring a
similar rotation toward the right- and left-hand sides. This left-right
symmetry is also in total agreement withprevious observations reported
by Bukatin et al. (20). To extract the sperm trajectories, we acquired
videos of the device, as shown in movie S2, and tracked the sperm
movement over the elapsed time (i.e., 3 to 20 periods). Using MATLAB
R2017a, we tracked 44, 35, and 51 sperm heads displaying different mo-
tilities to elucidate the trajectories of each microswimmer in three dif-
ferent sperm samples. Figure 3C displaysthe motion of a single sperm at
two different periods, in which the shape of the swimming path re-
mained relatively constant over the elapsed time (tblue = 0 − 6.24 s,
tred = 38.14 − 44.11 s). The motion of the sperm and its butterfly-
shaped path, as can be seen in Fig. 2C, is similar to the results obtained
by simulations presented in Fig. 1F.

 To confirm the results obtained from the simulations, we exper-
imentally measured the distance between the sperm-sidewall contact
points (B and D) and detachment points (A and C), i.e., the “withdrawal
distance,” for sperm with different velocities. As shown in Fig. 3D, the
increasing velocity of the sperm led to a decay in the withdrawal dis-
tance (W). According to simulation- and experimental-based results,
the decay in the withdrawal distance is exponentially correlated to the
sperm velocity. That is, the difference in the withdrawal distances of two
sperm is not only related to difference in the velocity of those swimmers—
the velocity of the sperm plays a determinative role as well. For instance,
on the basis of experimental data, the mean withdrawal distances
measured for sperm with velocities of ~75 and ~85 mm/s were 39.1
and 28.2 mm, respectively. However, for two slower sperm (~55 and
~65 mm/s) with the same difference in velocity, the corresponding
withdrawal distances were 74.6 and 51.3 mm. This dependency of
the sperm swimming path with the velocity of the sperm suggests that
swimmers with higher velocities move closer to each other, and their
corresponding CIs are closer in comparison than slower sperm.

 In addition to withdrawal distance, we also measured the elapsed
time taken for sperm to move in the transfer, rotation, and boundary
swimming modes. The images acquired from sperm at different time
frames and modes are presented in Fig. 4. In the pictures shown in
Fig. 4A, five sperm are moving in the transfer mode, in which three
of them (colored blue) are departing the upper sidewall and moving
toward the bottom sidewall. Likewise, the remaining two sperm (yellow-
colored) are departing the bottom sidewall toward the upper sidewall.
In Fig. 4B, a moderately motile sperm with a velocity of ~59 mm/s can
be seen beginning to rotate upstream because of the shear rate along
the normal direction of the sidewall. Later on, this sperm swims along
the boundary of the sidewall until it reaches the stricture, as can be
seen in Fig. 4C. These experimental observations of sperm movement
thus help confirm our simulated derivations of the three different
sperm swimming modes.
The corresponding elapsed times of each mode (tt, tr, and tf) are
presented in Fig. 4D. Since the rotation and boundary swimming times
somewhat overlap, especially for highly motile sperm, we combined the
amount of time required for each of these modes into a single measure-
ment (tr + tf). Using these times, we measuredthe CI from experimental
data of sperm featuring different velocities for different values of a
(Fig. 4E). At a = 40 mm, the CI measured for sperm with velocities
higher than 78 mm/s was close to 100%, which means that these sperm
were always closer than 40 mm to the stricture. For velocities below
78 mm/s, the CI decays, with the CI for the slowest sperm (v = 48 mm/s)
being 14.3%. In the case of a = 50 mm, the range of velocity for sperm
with a CI of 100% expands, and sperm faster than 72 mm/s are always
closer than 50 mm to the stricture.
The similarity between human and bovine sperm in terms of the
shape and swimming mechanism suggests that the motion of the hu-
man sperm below the stricture is similar to that of bovine sperm. We
also experimentally observed human sperm motion below the stricture
(movie S3), and as was expected, the butterfly-shaped swimming path
was seen in human sperm as well (fig. S6). Moreover, the human sperm
motion in the transfer, rotation, and boundary swimming modes is also
demonstrated in fig. S7, which confirms the similarity between human
and bull sperm locomotion strategies.
Accumulation of sperm near the stricture
In agreement with previous studies done in the absence of fluid flow
(29, 30), the butterfly-shaped motion (due to the sperms’ ability/tendency
to swim counter to the flow and parallel to the sidewalls) also leads to
the accumulation of sperm near the stricture, which could be inter-
preted as a mechanism used by the sperm to resist against the fluid flow.
Despite dead and nonmotile sperm being carried away by the flow, mo-
tile sperm maintained their proximity to the stricture, and thus, their
likelihood to pass through it is high. To observe this accumulation phe-
nomenon, we observed the microfluidic device using low-magnification
phase-contrast microscopy (movie S4) (31). To assess the abundancy of
the sperm, we took advantage of the twinkling effect observed in the
motile bull sperm due to the paddle-shaped head of the microswim-
mers, in which the side of the sperm flashes bright under the imaging
conditions, while the head’s top and bottom faces appear dark (Fig. 5A).
Zone A of Fig. 5B, which describes the area of the device that includes
the stricture, features more twinkling, whereas zone B, which includes
the wider region of the channel, twinkles less, as can be seen in movie S4.
On the basis of this evidence, we can conclude that more sperm accu-
mulate near the stricture. To validate this twinkling effect–based re-
sult, we manually counted the total number of motile sperm
swimming in zones A and B at high magnification, the results of which
are shown in Fig. 5C for three samples. With this method as well, we
observed that the number of sperm that accumulate below the stricture
is greater than that of zone B. This accumulation below the stricture
demonstrates sperm resistivity against the flow, which leads to persist-
ence upon advancing toward the egg, thus maintaining the chance of
fertilization.
Gate-like role of the stricture
The height of the hydromechanical barrier (i.e., the shear rate within the
stricture) determines the threshold motility that sperm must have to
overcome and pass through the stricture. To experimentally observe
the gate-like role of the stricture, we decreased the sperm medium
injection flow rate and, consequently, the shear rate within the stricture
to7.98s−1.Asa result, the spermwiththehighest motility (v= 84.2mm/s,
sperm number 1) could resist against the flow within the stricture, as
can be seen in Fig. 6A and movie S5. Meanwhile, all the sperm with
lower velocities (sperm numbers 2 to 6) maintained their location
below the barrier by periodically moving between the sidewalls. Under
these conditions, sperm number 1 is almost static in the observer
frame in the ^
x direction, as neither the shear rate of the flow nor
the sperm’s motility can overcome the other. By further decreasing
the shear rate of the stricture to 7.16 s−1, eventually, sperm number
1 can overcome the barrier and advance toward the next compart-
ment, as can be seen in Fig. 6B and movie S5. Meanwhile, all other
sperm with lower velocities accumulate below the barrier in a hier-
archical manner, i.e., sperm with higher velocities remain closer to
the stricture and slower sperm are swept further back by the flow. To
characterize the gate-like role of the stricture in motility-based selec-
tion of sperm, we gradually decreased the flow rate (thus the shear
rate of the stricture) and measured the velocity of the sperm that
passed through the stricture, which we call the “threshold sperm ve-
locity.” The threshold sperm velocity with regard to the shear rate
within the stricture is depicted in fig. S8, which demonstrates a linear
correlation (P = 0.01) between the threshold sperm velocity and the
Fig. 5. Accumulation of sperm below the stricture and the twinkling effect.

 shear rate of the stricture. The similarity between the geometry of the
stricture and the junctions within the female reproductive tract sug-
gests that the gate-like selective behavior of this microfluidic stricture
can mimic the potential role of junctions in motility-based selection
for sperm during fertilization (26).
CONCLUSION
The response of sperm to fluid flow and their inclination to follow
solid boundaries lead to the accumulation of sperm below the stricture
opening inside a microfluidic design. The accumulated sperm form
a hierarchy, in which swimmers with higher motilities are closer
together near the stricture mouth while slower sperm remain further
apart away from the stricture. Using numerical simulations and exper-
imental observations, we can quantitatively show that this hierarchical
structure imposes competition among the sperm, with the fiercest
competition occurring among highly motile microswimmers in com-
parison with the slower sperm. Moreover, depending on the shear rate
within the stricture, sperm with velocities higher than a threshold
value can pass through the stricture, whereas sperm slower than the
threshold accumulate below the stricture. This gate-like behavior shows
that sperm location is maintained near the stricture until the shear rate
within the stricture decreases; thus, the chance of the sperm to pass
through the stricture is maximized.
This gate-like behavior of the stricture suggests a motility-based se-
lection mechanismthatmay potentiallybeusedby the female reproduc-
tive tract to select for sperm with the highest motility. Moreover, since
we observed sperm accumulation below the stricture when the shear
rate was not sufficiently low enough for the sperm to pass through
the stricture, and given the fluid mechanical similarity between the stric-
ture in the microchannel and junctions of the female reproductive tract,
this investigation suggests that in these geometries, highly motile sperm
are more likely to pass through the fluid mechanical barriers and ad-
vance toward the fertilization site.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bull and human sperm samples
All the experiments were performed with four bull sperm samples
frozen in 250-ml straws that were purchased from Genex Cooper-
ative (Ithaca, NY). Semen from two of the bulls was frozen in a
milk-based extender, and semen from the other two bulls was fro-
zen in an egg yolk–based extender at a concentration of 100 million
sperm/ml. Frozen straws were thawed in a 37°C water bath. Then,
the live sperm were separated from the dead sperm using a density
gradient method (23). The separated sample was then diluted 1:3
using TALP (Tyrode’s albumin lactate pyruvate) medium. The vis-
cosity of the bull sperm sample after the dilution was 0.87 mPa∙s at
T = 37°C.
Fresh human sperm samples were provided by Weill Cornell
Medicine in accordance with the Weill Cornell Medicine Institu-
tional Review Board (IRB) guidelines. An approved IRB consent
form was used to prospectively recruit patients interested in
participating in this study. The original concentration of the hu-
man sperm sample was 46 million sperm/ml. All experiments
carried out on human samples diluted 1:3 with TALP medium at
T = 37°C. The viscosity of the human sample after the dilution was
0.94 mPa∙s. The TALP recipe was as follows: NaCl (110 mM), KCl
(2.68 mM), NaH2PO4 (0.36 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), MgCl2 (0.49 mM),
CaCl2 (2.4 mM), Hepes buffer (25 mM), glucose (5.56 mM), pyruvic
acid (1.0 mM), penicillin G (0.006% or 3 mg/500 ml), and bovine
serum albumin (20 mg/ml).
Device fabrication and injection systems
We used conventional soft lithography (32) to fabricate the micro-
fluidic device out of polydimethylsiloxane. We used con-
ventional soft lithography to fabricate the microfluidic device out
of polydimethylsiloxane. Syringe pumps (Chemyx Fusion 200)
were used to control the flow rate of the sperm medium at different
injection rates of 0 to 2 ml/hour. Using the syringe pump, we were
able to manipulate the input pressure and the injection rate. Fur-
thermore, to obtain very low flow rates (0 to 0.6 ml/hour), we used
gravity to inject the sample, in which case the flow rate was controlled
by changing the height of the sample container.
Image and video acquisition
Images and videos were acquired at 25 frames/s using phase-contrast
microscopy with a 10× objective and a digital Neo complimentary
metal-oxide semiconductor camera. During the experiments, the micro-
fluidic chip was kept on a heated microscope stage (Carl Zeiss, at 37°C).
The average path velocity of the sperm (also called VAP in computer-
assisted sperm analysis systems) was determined using ImageJ (version
1.51j8) and MATLAB (version R2017a) software by measuring the av-
erage distance between the center of the sperm head in each frame
divided by the time elapsed.
Simulation software
The layout of the microfluidic device was imported into COMSOL
MULTIPHYSICS (version 5.2) simulation software. Using the laminar
fluid module in a stationary mode, we solved the Navier-Stokes (Eq. 13)
Fig. 6. Gate-like role of the stricture. (A) Sperm number one is able to resist
against the shear rate in the stricture, and therefore, it has approximately no
movement in the −X direction. The other sperm (numbers 2 to 7) move in butterfly-
shaped paths, but they cannot pass through the junction. Hierarchical swimming
is discernible, and sperm with higher velocity are closer to the stricture and to
each other. (B) A small decrease (7.98 to 7.16 s−1) in the injection flow rate led
to sperm number 1 advancing and entering the adjacent compartment. Mean-
while, the slower sperm continue to swim on the butterfly-shaped path below
the stricture.
