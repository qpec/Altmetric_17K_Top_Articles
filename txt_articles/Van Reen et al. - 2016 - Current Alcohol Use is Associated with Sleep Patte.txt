Study Objectives: To examine whether differences exist in self-reported sleep patterns and self-reported alcohol use for first-semester college students who 
do or do not report drinking during the last 6 months (mo) of high school.
Methods: Participants were 878 first-year college students. Students completed a survey in late May/early June about alcohol use and consequences, during 
the last 6 mo of high school; they later completed a daily record of sleep behavior and alcohol use across the first 9 weeks of the first semester of college. 
High school drinking status (past 6 mo) was classified as positive (HS−6 mo+) or negative (HS−6mo−) based on any indication of drinking on the May/June 
survey. Collegiate drinking was determined from first-semester daily diary alcohol reports as non-drinkers (0 reported drinks), drinkers (one or fewer heavy 
episodic drinking episodes (HED)), and drinkers reporting more than one HED episode. Sleep patterns were compared for non-drinkers, drinkers, and HED 
with no high school drinking history (HS−6mo−/HED). In addition, a separate analysis compared sleep patterns for college HED with (HS−6mo+/HED) and 
without (HS−6mo−/HED) high school self-reported alcohol use.
Results: Increased alcohol consumption in the first semester of college was associated with later bedtimes and rise times. We found no association of high 
school alcohol use and sleep in those with collegiate HED.
Conclusions: Later sleep timing in those with greater alcohol use, supports a connection between sleep patterns and alcohol use. Such an early appearance 
of this connection may herald the development of alcohol use disorder in some individuals.

INTRODUCTION
Excessive alcohol use is problematic on college campuses in 
the United States, where almost half of college students re-
port engaging in heavy episodic drinking (HED, defined as 
five or more drinks in one occasion for males and four or more 
for females1,2), at least once in the past month.3 HED increases 
the risk of academic difficulties, physical illnesses, legal in-
volvement, and accidental death.4,5 HED also increases risk of 
campus and public policy violations, as alcohol use is restricted 
or prohibited on a large number of college campuses.6 A sig-
nificant number of college students meet diagnostic criteria 
for alcohol use disorders7; thus, alcohol use in college students 
is a major public health concern, and reducing alcohol use on 
campus is a prominent goal of many universities.
The first year of college is a particularly risky period for al-
cohol use and consequences due in part to substantial changes 
in daily routines and peer group affiliations.8 Heavy drinking 
during the first year of school can have long-term implications, 
as many students continue to exhibit heavy drinking behavior 
after graduation.9 The dynamic nature of the transition from 
high school to university in the United States together with 
significant health implications of heavy drinking make this pe-
riod of transition an advantageous time to study the association 
between alcohol use and sleep.

Significance
Excessive alcohol use is a problem in college students and is associated with a number of negative outcomes. An association between disturbed sleep 
and reduced hours of sleep is well established. The current study shows that the timing of sleep (i.e., later times) is associated with increased alcohol 
consumption in first-semester college students. In contrast to previous studies, we did not observe the association of reduced total sleep time and increased 
alcohol consumption. Thus, these data indicate that future studies should investigate the role of sleep timing and circadian rhythms on alcohol consumption. 
A better understanding of the associations between sleep, circadian rhythms, and alcohol may help to inform alcohol interventions and treatment.
The association between disturbed sleep and alcohol use is 
well established in adults. Several studies have shown that both 
acute and chronic alcohol consumption alter the architecture of 
physiologically measured sleep.10–16 Alterations resulting from 
acute alcohol use include shorter sleep onset latency, a decrease 
in amount of rapid eye movement sleep, more stage 4 sleep in 
the first half of the night, an increase in wake during sleep, and 
an increase in delta electroencephalography power. Research 
indicates an association between irregular self-reported sleep 
patterns and increased alcohol consumption. Specifically, self-
report of insomnia is associated with a twofold increase in self-
reported alcohol abuse.17 Furthermore, associations have been 
detected between self-reported short-sleep (< 6 h per night) 
and increased alcohol consumption in adult men and women 
(ages 18–64 y),18 and self-reported insomnia symptoms and 
HED adults older than 50 years,19 and associations between 
problems falling and staying asleep and HED in adolescents 
and young adults.20
These patterns are also evident in a few studies assessing 
adolescents and college students.21–26 For example, Hasler 
and colleagues21 found that youths with alcohol use disorders 
compared to those without report more insomnia, hyper-
somnia, and greater variability in weekday to weekend sleep 
duration. Wong and colleagues22 analyzed data from a large

database (n = 6,504) which contained two sleep questions: 
“Please tell me how often you have had each of the following 
conditions in the past 12 mo—Trouble falling asleep or 
staying asleep?” and “How many hours of sleep do you usu-
ally get?” Self-report of trouble falling or staying asleep once 
a week, every day or almost every day, and fewer hours of 
sleep predicted increased number of alcohol-related problems 
in older adolescents.22 Furthermore, Singleton and Wolfson23 
found that college students who reported consuming an in-
crease in alcoholic drinks over a 2-w period also reported 
less nighttime sleep, later sleep times, sleeping more on 
weekends compared to weekdays, and greater delays in sleep 
timing between weekday and weekend bedtimes. An associa-
tion between retrospective self-reported sleep and alcohol is 
well established, but few studies have assessed the associa-
tion of sleep patterns and alcohol use using daily diaries in 
college students.
This study examines drinking patterns of first-semester 
university students who participated in a study of sleep and 
mood.27 To date, most studies have relied on retrospective 
self-reports of sleep patterns and alcohol consumption. In 
contrast, our approach combined retrospective survey data 
with daily reports of concurrent sleeping and drinking pat-
terns summarized over the course of the first semester of 
college (9 w) to examine two hypotheses. First, we examined 
differences in sleep patterns for college students who re-
ported no alcohol use on our high school assessments (HS−) 
and (1) reported no alcohol use on the first-semester daily 
diaries (non-drinkers), (2) reported alcohol use in college but 
did not engage in HED more than once (drinkers), or (3) en-
dorsed HED on first semester daily diaries more than once 
(HS−/HED). We hypothesized that students reporting more 
alcohol consumption would also report later sleep times (e.g., 
bedtime, wake time) and less sleep compared to students re-
porting less or no alcohol use. Second, past research has not 
explored associations between history of alcohol use and 
sleep patterns in college students. We examined these asso-
ciations by assessing differences in sleep patterns between 
students who reported heavy episodic drinking in college 
and either did (HS+/HED) or did not (HS−/HED) report al-
cohol use in high school. Given known associations between 
alcohol and sleep and a proposed succession of poor sleep 
self-medicated with alcohol in turn leading to worse sleep 
and increased alcohol use,17 we hypothesize worse sleep (i.e., 
less total sleep time and later timing of sleep) in HS+/HED 
than in the HS−/HED students. In addition, sex differences 
exist in sleep28,29 and in college drinking patterns,30 espe-
cially in first-year students31–37; however, it is not known 
whether sex influences the relation between sleep patterns 
and alcohol use. Therefore, we include sex in our analyses 
to assess whether there is an interaction between sex and 
alcohol group on sleep patterns.
METHODS
Participants
Students (n = 8,417) who accepted admission to a private 
northeast 4-y university in 6 consecutive years were recruited 
to participate in a prospective study that assessed sleep and 
mood, across the first 8 to 10 w of classes in their first semester. 
Participants were also asked to complete a measure of previous 
alcohol consumption after they were accepted but before they 
arrived at university. No exclusion criteria were used in year 
1; in subsequent years, the only exclusion criterion was age 
younger than 18 y. All participants provided informed consent 
and they received monetary compensation for taking part in 
this study, which was approved by the Lifespan Institutional 
Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects. The anal-
yses included data from 878 students (see next section) who 
completed the study.
Procedure
In the 2 w following acceptance of admission (early May 
2009–2014), students were sent a four-page survey that que-
ried a number of behaviors, including alcohol use during the 
past 6 mo. Participants returned the surveys in postage-paid 
envelopes. All students who returned a completed survey 
(n = 2,832) were invited to enroll in the second phase of 
the project that involved completing an online daily diary 
prompted by Email for approximately 9 w from the start of the 
term. A total of 1,400 students agreed to complete these daily 
diaries. In-person consent and study description occurred at 
the start of this phase and included a review of the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism “standard” drink 
chart in the last 3 y of the project. Daily surveys that assessed 
sleep and drinking in the past 24 h were made available for stu-
dents to complete online beginning on the first day of classes. 
At week 9 of the semester (before the Thanksgiving holiday), 
participants completed an online outcome survey that included 
the Brief-Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire 
(B-YAACQ) among other measures. Illume software (DatStat, 
Inc., Seattle, Washington) was used to collect the online data 
through a secure website.
Measures
Sleep
Daily diaries included the following questions about the 
major sleep episode in the past 24 h: “What time did you 
try to fall asleep?” “Estimate how many minutes it took 
you to fall asleep,” “Estimate how many minutes you were 
awake after you fell asleep,” and “What time did you finally 
wake up?”
Sleep patterns were determined for each participant across 
all completed diaries as the mean and standard deviation of 
diary-reported bedtimes and rise times. Total sleep time was 
computed from the elapsed time from bedtime to rise time 
minus sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset.
Alcohol Use
Determination of high-school drinking status as positive or 
negative was based on students’ responses to two measures 
from the initial high school survey. A threshold for positive 
high-school drinking history included a positive endorse-
ment of the question, “during the past 6 mo, how often did 
you use alcohol?” and/or a score of greater than zero on the

B-YAACQ.38 Details about this measure are included in the 
next section. Thus, for these analyses students were classi-
fied as positive for high-school drinking history based on a 
question that assessed alcohol use over “the past 6 mo” of high 
school and any self-reported alcohol consequences over the 
past month of high school.
The first-semester college daily diaries included an alcohol 
question: “how many drinks did you have today?” and the par-
ticipant could select from 10 response options (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, or 9+). We used this item to create the following groups 
(non-drinkers, drinkers, HED) and variables: latency to first 
college drinking day (number of diary days between first day 
of classes and first reported alcoholic drink), percent of diary 
days drinking (% Drinking), and mean number of drinks re-
ported on drinking days.
Alcohol-Related Problems
Alcohol-related consequences were assessed at baseline and 
follow-up using the 24-item B-YAACQ. Dichotomous items 
(yes/no) are summed for a total number of alcohol-related con-
sequences experienced in the past month. The B-YAACQ is a 
24-item subset of the YAACQ39 that was created using item-
response theory analysis to extract those items that most ef-
ficiently capture a single dimension of alcohol problems with 
nonredundant items spread across a continuum of severity. 
The B-YAACQ has been found to be reliable yet sensitive to 
changes in alcohol use over time and has demonstrated high in-
ternal consistency in research with college students (α = 0.89),40 
mandated college students (α = 0.89),41 and the current sample 
(α = 0.84).
Analytic Approach
Drinking Group Assignment
Our initial sample included all participants who completed 
more than half (mean percentage of diaries completed = 88.7%, 
standard deviation = 11.4%) of the daily diaries and the final 
B-YAACQ form (n = 975). Few students (n = 97) reported high 
school drinking but limited college drinking, and these par-
ticipants were excluded from subsequent analyses. Of the re-
maining 878 participants, 647 (66%; 488 female, ages 18–22 y, 
mean age = 18.6) reported no evidence of high-school drinking 
in the past 6 mo as defined previously We divided this pre-
sumptive non–high-school drinking sample into three groups 
based on the alcohol reports in their first-semester college 
daily diaries. See Figure  S1 in the supplemental material for 
more details on how groups were determined.
• “Non-drinkers” (n = 325; 33%, female = 197) reported 
no alcohol use on the diaries;
• “Drinkers” (n = 199; 20%, female = 121) reported 
using alcohol on at least 1 day but no more than one 
HED episode (HED: defined as > 4 drinks for women 
and > 5 drinks for men reported on the same daily 
diary 24-h period);
• “HS−/HED” (n = 123; 13%, female = 59) reported more 
than one HED episode in the first semester.
A fourth group (“HS+/HED,” n = 231, female = 111) comprises 
individuals who had a positive self-report for alcohol in the last 
6 mo of high school and reported more than one HED episode 
on daily diaries in college, comparable to the HS−/HED group.
Analyses
To contextualize the four drinking groups across com-
monly used indices of drinking behavior (i.e., mean drinks 
on drinking days, percent days drinking, and the B-YAACQ 
total score), we report descriptive statistics by drinking group 
and by sex in Table 1. Group differences were evaluated using 
analyses of variance (ANOVA), where drinking group, par-
ticipant sex, and the drinking group by sex interaction were 
tested.
Next, we evaluated our first aim using ANOVAs, with al-
cohol group (”Non-drinkers,” “Drinkers,” “HS−/HED”) and 
sex (male, female) as independent factors. Consistent with our 
hypothesis that increased alcohol consumption is related to 
sleep patterns, a linear contrast across the three groups was 
used for each sleep outcome.
To compare the sleep data in students who reported heavy 
drinking in the first semester of college (HS−/HED) versus 
heavy drinking students who reported high-school drinking 
(HS+/HED) (Aim 2), each sleep variable was examined using 
ANOVAs with independent factors alcohol group (“HS−/
HED” versus “HS+/HED”) and sex (male, female). The influ-
ence of sex on the relationship between drinking group and 
sleep patterns were evaluated by including a sex by drinking 
group interaction in both sets of analyses. Effect sizes for all 
analyses were calculated using partial eta squared (η2). We 
will only report statistically significant findings. Multiple com-
parisons were addressed using a Bonferroni correction, with 
α < 0.008 for sleep variables. Statistical tests and effect sizes of

RESULTS
Data Screening and Descriptive Statistics
We tested whether differences in bedtime, wake time, total 
sleep time, B-YAACQ score, or drinking status differed be-
tween those who completed the survey and those who enrolled 
in the first semester portion of the study. No differences were 
observed for any of these variables.
Descriptive statistics stratified by drinking group and 
sex are provided in Table 1. Substantial differences between 
drinking groups on all of the drinking measures were found, 
and all were in expected directions. Thus, students whose re-
ports indicated heavy episodic drinking also reported drinking 
on more days with a higher amount of alcohol per drinking 
day. Scores on the B-YAACQ completed at the end of data 
collection also captured a greater number of alcohol-related 
consequences in the HED groups than for those who did not re-
port drinking or reported light alcohol use. Sex differences in 
drinking behavior were also observed (Bonferroni correction, 
with α < 0.013 used for alcohol variables): women reported 
fewer mean drinks on drinking days (F1, 530 = 51.69, P < 0.001, 
η2 = 0.089) than men.
Furthermore, a significant interaction between sex and al-
cohol group was observed for mean number of reported drinks 
on drinking days (F1, 530 = 7.59, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.028). Specifi-
cally, the mean number of reported drinks on drinking days 
were greater in HS−/HED and HS+/HED men compared to 
women.
Sleep Variables for High-School Alcohol History Negative 
Students (Hypothesis 1, Table 2)
Our examination of the sleep variables across three groups 
of students who did not report high school drinking showed 
no group differences in the amount of sleep, with average re-
ported sleep time of approximately 7 h and 15 min each night. 
Differences were observed for variables capturing the timing 
of sleep (rise time: F1, 641 = 15.23, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.024; bedtime: 
F1, 641 = 10.05, P = 0.002, η2 = 0.016), later bedtime and rise time 
were associated with greater reported drinking as evidenced

by a significant linear trend (rise time: F1, 641 = 15.23, P < 0.001; 
bedtime: F1, 641 = 10.05, P = 0.002; see Figure 1). No other sleep 
variables showed significant differences as a function of the 
alcohol group.
HS+/HED Versus HS−/HED Sleep Variables (Hypothesis 2, Table 2)
Although we hypothesized distinguishable differences in the 
sleep variables when comparing the students whose heavy 
episodic drinking occurred on the background of high-school 
drinking versus those without prior drinking, our hypothesis 
was not supported.
Sex Differences
Overall sex differences emerged from both Hypotheses 1 and 
2. In the former, the women’s data showed earlier (F1, 641 = 25.09, 
P < 0.001, η2 = 0.038) and less variable rise times (F1, 641 = 29.15, 
P < 0.001, η2 = 0.044) and earlier bedtimes (F1, 641 = 10.04, 
P = 0.002, η2 = 0. 015) than men. The latter analyses (Hypoth-
esis 2) also showed sex differences including earlier rise time 
(F1, 350 = 28.48, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.075) and less variable rise time 
(F1, 350 = 14.89, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.041), as well as earlier bedtime 
(F1, 350 = 11.73, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.032) for women. No additional 
sex differences were observed and no significant interactions 
between sex and drinking group were observed. The absence 
of sex*drinking group interactions indicate that sex did not 
moderate the associations of alcohol use with sleep patterns.
DISCUSSION
The current study examined differences in self-reported sleep 
in students reporting alcohol use in the first semester of college, 
some of whom reported evidence of precollege alcohol use. 
The participants’ drinking histories and collegiate drinking 
were derived from self-reports. 
We found several expected associations between sleep and 
alcohol when we examined collegiate sleep patterns in stu-
dents with no reported evidence of alcohol use in the past 6 
mo of high school. First, later sleep patterns in those reporting 
alcohol use were observed. Indeed, increased alcohol con-
sumption was associated with later bedtimes and rise times. 
In contrast to other studies,18,23 reported total sleep time was 
not significantly associated with alcohol use in our partici-
pants. Second, current alcohol consumption rather than history 
of alcohol use was most strongly associated with the average 
timing of sleep patterns and the relation of sleep patterns. Con-
sidering these findings in the context of the Brower model,17 a 
cycle of poor sleep and subsequent use of alcohol to treat poor 
sleep ultimately lead to alcohol use disorders; thus, we would 
have expected to see worse sleep patterns in students who used 
alcohol in high school. The finding that history of alcohol use 
in high school does not play a role in college sleep patterns 
suggests this association may be more subtle in young adults 
and highlights the importance of examining the association 
between sleep and alcohol use in young people beginning to 
use alcohol.
The findings that sleep patterns are later in students con-
suming more alcohol indicate that the average clock times of 
sleep behavior rather than the amount of sleep per se are more 
closely associated with alcohol intake in our first-year college 
students. College lifestyle may be implicated in the lack of 
an association between total sleep time and alcohol, because 
students in general have considerable flexibility in their sleep 
schedules. Thus, even though the collegiate drinkers reported 
later bedtimes overall than the moderate drinkers or non-
drinkers, unconstrained rise times may have mitigated sleep 
loss that can occur if one must wake up for daily activities.
As noted earlier, we did not observe less sleep for partici-
pants reporting heavier alcohol consumption. We expected to 
see shorter sleep linked to alcohol use based on previous lit-
erature demonstrating that risk-taking and impulsivity—and 
hence perhaps proclivity for alcohol use—increase with re-
duced sleep. We may have missed this “signal” by using av-
eraged sleep and alcohol ingestion patterns across the entire 
study period. Thus, our future analyses will examine sleep 
patterns more proximal to HED episodes to assess whether we 
can relate sleep length to individual alcohol use events.
Sex differences in sleep variables were consistent with 
previous literature42,43; for example, women reported earlier 
bedtimes and earlier rise times on average than men. Of note, 
however, we observed no interactions of sex and reported al-
cohol consumption for any sleep variable, indicating that the 
associations between sleep patterns and alcohol consumption 
do not differ for men and women.
We note some limitations to the current analyses. First, we 
did not assess lifetime alcohol use history in these students; as 
such, these high-school drinking histories differentiate those 
students who reported consuming alcohol in the “past 6 mo” of 
high school compared to those who did not report consuming 
alcohol. Second, these findings are from college students at a 
private residential university in the Northeast United States; 
thus, these findings may not be generalizable to all college 
students.
In summary, we found an association between alcohol con-
sumption and sleep patterns in first-semester college students. 
Specifically, we found that later bedtimes and rise times were 
associated with increased alcohol consumption. In contrast to 
previous studies, our findings indicate that sleep timing, rather 
than sleep length, is associated with current alcohol use level. 
These findings suggest that interventions targeting alcohol use/
misuse in college students may benefit from addressing how to 
improve sleep timing and sleep hygiene in general.
