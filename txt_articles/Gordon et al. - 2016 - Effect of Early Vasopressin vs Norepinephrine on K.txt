IMPORTANCE Norepinephrine is currently recommended as the first-line vasopressor in septic
shock; however, early vasopressin use has been proposed as an alternative.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of early vasopressin vs norepinephrine on kidney failure in
patients with septic shock.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A factorial (2×2), double-blind, randomized clinical trial
conducted in 18 general adult intensive care units in the United Kingdom between February
2013 and May 2015, enrolling adult patients who had septic shock requiring vasopressors
despite fluid resuscitation within a maximum of 6 hours after the onset of shock.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated to vasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min)
and hydrocortisone (n = 101), vasopressin and placebo (n = 104), norepinephrine and
hydrocortisone (n = 101), or norepinephrine and placebo (n = 103).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was kidney failure–free days during
the 28-day period after randomization, measured as (1) the proportion of patients who never
developed kidney failure and (2) median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for
patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both. Rates of renal
replacement therapy, mortality, and serious adverse events were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS A total of 409 patients (median age, 66 years; men, 58.2%) were included in the
study, with a median time to study drug administration of 3.5 hours after diagnosis of shock.
The number of survivors who never developed kidney failure was 94 of 165 patients (57.0%)
in the vasopressin group and 93 of 157 patients (59.2%) in the norepinephrine group
(difference, −2.3% [95% CI, −13.0% to 8.5%]). The median number of kidney failure–free
days for patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both was 9 days
(interquartile range [IQR], 1 to –24) in the vasopressin group and 13 days (IQR, 1 to –25) in the
norepinephrine group (difference, −4 days [95% CI, −11 to 5]). There was less use of renal
replacement therapy in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group (25.4% for
vasopressin vs 35.3% for norepinephrine; difference, −9.9% [95% CI, −19.3% to −0.6%]).
There was no significant difference in mortality rates between groups. In total, 22 of 205
patients (10.7%) had a serious adverse event in the vasopressin group vs 17 of 204 patients
(8.3%) in the norepinephrine group (difference, 2.5% [95% CI, −3.3% to 8.2%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with septic shock, the early use of vasopressin
compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure–free days.
Although these findings do not support the use of vasopressin to replace norepinephrine as
initial treatment in this situation, the confidence interval included a potential clinically
important benefit for vasopressin, and larger trials may be warranted to assess this further.

I
n 2015, it was estimated that there were more than 230 000
cases of septic shock with more than 40 000 deaths in the
United States each year.1 In addition to treating the under-
lying infection, the mainstay of cardiovascular resuscitation
in septic shock is intravenous fluids and vasopressor treat-
ment. Norepinephrine is the recommended first-line
vasopressor2but,sincearelativevasopressindeficiencyinsep-
tic shock was described, there has been growing interest in the
useofvasopressinasanadjunctiveagent.3Preclinicalandsmall
clinical studies have suggested that vasopressin may be bet-
ter able to maintain glomerular filtration rate and improve cre-
atinine clearance compared with norepinephrine.4-6
Thelargesttrialofvasopressintodate,theVasopressinand
Septic Shock Trial (VASST),7 found no difference in mortality
overall when vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) was added to ex-
isting norepinephrine treatment compared with norepineph-
rine alone, but there was a significantly lower mortality in the
patients treated with vasopressin who had less severe shock
(defined as a dose of norepinephrine <15 μg/min). Additional
analyses from VASST and other investigations have sug-
gested that early vasopressin might prevent deterioration in
organfunction,5,8particularlykidneyfunction,andthathigher
dosesofvasopressin(upto0.06U/min)maybemoreeffective.9
In addition, it has been proposed that there may be an inter-
action between vasopressin and corticosteroids when used to
treat septic shock and that the combination of vasopressin and
corticosteroids may improve survival10 and reduce the dura-
tion of shock.11
The Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine as Initial Therapy in
Septic Shock (VANISH) trial was designed to test whether early
vasopressin use, titrated up to 0.06 U/min, would improve
kidney outcomes compared with norepinephrine.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
The VANISH trial was a factorial (2×2), multicenter, double-
blind, randomized clinical trial. It was conducted in 18 gen-
eral adult intensive care units (ICU) in the United Kingdom be-
tween February 2013 and May 2015. The trial protocol and
statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1.
TheOxfordAresearchethicscommitteeapprovedthetrial.
In view of the emergency nature of the trial, a waiver of initial
consentwasgranted.Patientscouldbeenrolledintothetrialwith-
outprospectiveconsentandthenwrittenconsentwasobtained
from the patient or a personal or professional legal representa-
tiveassoonaspracticallypossible.Forcasesinwhichalegalrep-
resentative gave consent, retrospective written consent was
sought once the patient regained decision-making capacity.
Adult patients (≥16 years) who had sepsis (2 of 4 systemic
inflammatory response criteria due to known or suspected
infection12) and who required vasopressors despite adequate
intravenous fluid resuscitation, as assessed by clinical exami-
nation, central venous pressure, oxygen saturation, or other
physiological parameters using repeated fluid challenges were
eligible for the trial. Exclusion criteria were patients who had
received a previous continuous infusion of vasopressors dur-
ing this ICU admission, an ongoing requirement for systemic
steroid treatment (ie, known adrenal insufficiency or regular
systemic steroid therapy within the last 3 months), end-stage
kidney failure, known mesenteric ischemia, Raynaud phe-
nomenon, systemic sclerosis or other vasospastic disease, a
medical team that was not committed to full active treat-
ment, known pregnancy, enrollment in another interven-
tional trial that might interact with the study drugs, or hyper-
sensitivity to any of the study drugs.
Ethnicity was classified based on medical records, as most
patients lacked capacity to provide this information at the time
of their study enrollment. Documentation of ethnicity in pa-
tients’medical records is standard practice within the UK
National Health Service. The main categories of ethnicity were
white, black, Asian, and other. Because the vast majority of
study participants were white, the descriptive statistics uti-
lized a simplified dichotomization of white vs other.
Randomization and Masking
Enrollment, randomization, and data collection were con-
ducted via an online system (InForm, Oracle). Patients were
assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (vasopressin and hydro-
cortisone, vasopressin and placebo, norepinephrine and hy-
drocortisone, or norepinephrine and placebo) on a 1:1:1:1 ba-
sis with variable block size randomization (4 and 8) using
computer-generatedrandomnumbers,stratifiedbycenter.The
allocation sequence was prepared by an independent statis-
tician in the Imperial Clinical Trials Unit and concealed from
all investigators and treating clinicians.
Ampoules of vasopressin (Ferring), norepinephrine
(Aguettant), and hydrocortisone phosphate (Amdipharm
Mercury) were masked by overlabeling on the body and neck
of normal drug ampoules. Matching placebo ampoules (0.9%
saline) were manufactured by Sharp Clinical Services (United
Kingdom) who carried out all labeling and treatment pack
preparation.
Clinical Management
Patients were allocated to receive either vasopressin (titrated
up to 0.06 U/min) or norepinephrine (titrated up to 12 μg/min)
as the initial vasopressor infusion (study drug 1) via a central
venous catheter, and titrated to maintain the target mean ar-
terial pressure (MAP). The protocol recommended a MAP of
65 to 75 mm Hg, but this could be altered by the treating phy-
sician if clinically indicated.
Once the maximum infusion rate of study drug 1 was
reached, patients received study drug 2, either 50 mg of hy-
drocortisone phosphate or placebo, administered as an intra-
venousbolusevery6hoursfor5days,every12hoursfor3days,
and then once daily for 3 days, as previously reported.13 The
drug could be weaned more quickly if the shock had already
resolved.
If the patient was still hypotensive after the first dose of
study drug 2 then additional open-label catecholamine vaso-
pressorscouldbeadministered.Asthepatientrecovered,open-
label catecholamine vasopressors were reduced first and only
once the patient was weaned off open-label vasopressors was
study drug 1 then reduced. Once study drug 1 was weaned off,

if there was recurrent hypotension within 24 hours, the study
drug was restarted; if hypotension recurred after 24 hours,
open-label vasopressors were used at local physician discre-
tion. All other treatment was at physician discretion, based on
the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines at that time.14
Patients could present and be recruited from any part of
the hospital prior to ICU admission. Although the aim was to
use study drug 1 as the initial vasopressor, study drugs could
not be stored in multiple locations within the hospitals. There-
fore, in an emergency when immediate treatment was re-
quired, patients could be initially resuscitated using usual
(open-label) clinically prescribed vasopressors. In this situa-
tion, the patient had to be enrolled into the trial within 6 hours
of commencing the open-label vasopressor infusion. As the
study drug infusion was titrated up, as detailed above, the ini-
tial open-label vasopressor infusion was weaned off as quickly
as possible to maximize the study drug infusion rate.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of the trial was kidney failure–free days
(ie, the number of days alive and free of kidney failure), de-
fined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) group stage
3 definition,15 during the 28 days after randomization, with no
additional penalty for death. This outcome measure was not
normally distributed and had a large spike in frequency at 28
days, the point at which the measure was truncated, repre-
senting survivors who never developed kidney failure. There-
fore, the prospective plan was to report the data using 2 sum-
mary measures: (1) the proportion of survivors who never
developed kidney failure (the spike at 28 days) and (2) the me-
dian number of days alive and free of kidney failure for the
other patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney
failure, or both at any time.
Secondary outcomes included rates and duration of renal
replacement therapy; length of kidney failure in survivors and
nonsurvivors;28-day,ICU,andhospitalmortalityrates;andor-
gan failure–free days in the first 28 days, assessed using the
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.16
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 400 was chosen to provide 80% power to de-
tect a 20% to 25% relative reduction of risk of developing
kidney failure if treated with vasopressin compared with nor-
epinephrine, assuming an overall incidence of acute kidney
failure of 30% to 50%8,11 and a significance level of .05. The
calculations were based on simulation, assuming a Mann-
Whitney U test for analysis. To allow for a 3% withdrawal of
consent in line with previous critical care studies within the
United Kingdom,17 412 patients was the recruitment target.
The primary analysis tested for a difference between the
distribution of kidney failure–free days for all patients ran-
domized to vasopressin compared with those randomized to
norepinephrine using a Mann-Whitney U test. The main analy-
sis was a modified intention-to-treat basis (patients who did
not receive study drug because they had died or recovered or
were found to be ineligible after randomization were ex-
cluded).However,becausenotallpatientswouldrequirestudy
drug2,analysiswasalsocarriedoutonanas-treatedbasis,with
patients not requiring study drug 2 allocated to the placebo
group, and reallocation of any crossovers. A further per-
protocol analysis was carried out in which any patients not re-
ceiving the allocated study drugs or crossovers were ex-
cluded. Logistic regression models and Cox regression models
were used to compare renal replacement therapy and mortal-
ity between the 4 treatment groups and test for a potential
vasopressin and hydrocortisone interaction on an intention-
to-treat basis accounting for study site using a hierarchical
model for the logistic regression and stratification for the Cox
model. All analyses were carried out using R (R Foundation),
version 3.1.3, and a P value less than .05 was considered sta-
tistically significant using 2-sided tests.
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of patients through the trial. The most
frequent reason for screening failure was exceeding the 6-hour
recruitment window. A total of 421 patients were random-
ized. Seven patients were found to be ineligible after random-
ization but before receiving any study drug and 5 patients or
legal representatives withheld or withdrew consent after in-
clusioninthetrial;thesepatientswereexcludedfromallanaly-
ses. One patient refused ongoing participation in the trial af-
ter inclusion, including 28-day follow-up, but allowed existing
data to be included in the analyses. Therefore, 409 patients
were included at baseline for safety data and some secondary
outcome analyses as indicated and 408 patients were in-
cluded in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. In total, 8 pa-
tients in placebo groups were given open-label hydrocorti-
sone as “rescue” therapy or for other clinical indications and
2 patients in the norepinephrine groups were given open-
label vasopressin (1 of whom was also 1 of the 8 given open-
label hydrocortisone), and these patients were included as
crossovers in the as-treated analysis. The patients who did not
receive study drug 2 (Figure 1) were allocated to the placebo
groupintheas-treatedanalysis.Allcrossoversandpatientsnot
receiving the second study drug were excluded from the per-
protocol analysis.
The treatment groups were well balanced at baseline
(Table 1). The study drugs were started at a median of 3.5 hours
after the diagnosis of shock. In 15% of patients, study drug 1
was the first vasopressor administered. For the 309 patients
(76%) receiving norepinephrine at randomization, the me-
dian dose of open-label norepinephrine at baseline was
0.16 μg/kg/min. The MAP in all treatment groups was similar
at baseline and over the first 7 days (Figure 2A; eFigure 1A in
Supplement 2) and vasopressin spared the total dose of nor-
epinephrine required to maintain the blood pressure
(Figure 2B).
There was no significant difference in the distribution of
kidneyfailure–freedaysbetweenvasopressinandnorepineph-
rine groups, P = .88 (Figure 3). The number of survivors who
never developed kidney failure was 94 of 165 patients (57.0%)
in the vasopressin group and 93 of 157 patients (59.2%) in the
norepinephrine group (absolute difference, −2.3% [95% CI,
−13.0% to 8.5%]) (Table 2). The median number of kidney

failure–free days in the other patients who died, experienced
kidney failure, or both at any time was 9 (interquartile range
[IQR], 1 to 24) in the vasopressin group and 13 (IQR, 1 to 25) in
the norepinephrine group (absolute difference, −4 days [95%
CI, −11 to 5]). Similar results were obtained when using the se-
rum creatinine values and urine output values separately to
define kidney failure (eTable 2 in Supplement 2), and the as-
treated and per-protocol analyses gave similar results (eTable
3 in Supplement 2).
Similar quantities of intravenous fluid were given to all
groups, and total fluid balance, serum lactate levels, and heart
rate were similar in all groups (eTables 4-7 in Supplement 2).
Serum creatinine levels were lower and urine output slightly
higher over the first 7 days in the vasopressin group com-
pared with the norepinephrine group (Figure 4 and eTables 8A
and 9A in Supplement 2) and the rate of renal replacement
therapy use was 25.4% in the vasopressin group and 35.3% in
the norepinephrine group (odds ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20-
0.73]) (Table 2). There was no significant difference in mor-
tality rates between vasopressin and norepinephrine groups
(28-day mortality, 30.9% in the vasopressin group vs 27.5% in
the norepinephrine group; absolute difference, 3.4% [95% CI,
−5.4% to 12.3%]), and hydrocortisone and placebo groups
(28-day mortality, 30.8% in the hydrocortisone group vs 27.5%
in the placebo group; absolute difference, 3.3% [95% CI, −5.5%
to 12.1%]) (Table 2; eFigure 4A in Supplement 2), and there was
no significant interaction between vasopressin and hydrocor-
tisone (P = .98 from Cox regression model for 28-day mortal-
ity). There were no differences in rates of other new organ fail-
ures or organ failure–free days between vasopressin and
norepinephrine groups (eTable 10 in Supplement 2).
In the vasopressin group 22 patients had a total of 29 se-
rious adverse events and 17 patients in the norepinephrine
group had 19 events. The breakdown of all serious adverse

0.06 U/min and the mean dose of norepinephrine or epineph-
rine was 0.55 μg/kg/min (0.33 μg/kg/min in the vasopressin
group and 0.79 μg/kg/min in the norepinephrine group).
Rates of vasopressin and norepinephrine infusion are
shown in eFigures 1B-D and 2 in Supplement 2. There was no
difference in serum creatinine, urine output, rates of kidney
failure, use of renal replacement therapy, mortality, or seri-
ous adverse events between the hydrocortisone group and the
placebo group (eTables 8B, 9B, and 11 and eFigures 3A-B and
4B in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this multicenter, factorial (2×2), double-blind, randomized
clinical trial, early use of vasopressin to treat septic shock did
not increase the number of kidney failure–free days compared
with norepinephrine. Mortality rates were similar between all
groups and there was no interaction on outcome between va-
sopressin and corticosteroids. Although these findings do not
supporttheuseofvasopressintoreplacenorepinephrineasini-
tial treatment in this situation, the confidence interval in-
cluded a potential clinically important benefit for vasopressin,
and larger trials may be warranted to assess this further.
The rationale for this trial was based on the results of the
previous VASST study.7 Although there was no significant dif-
ference in mortality rates in the overall septic shock popula-
tion in that trial, there was a lower mortality rate in the a priori
definedsubgroupofpatientswhohadlesssevereshocktreated
withvasopressincomparedwithnorepinephrine(28-daymor-
tality relative risk, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.01], P = .05). There
was no difference in mortality in those who had more severe
shock(definedasnorepinephrine≥15μg/minatbaseline).Pos-
sible explanations for the VASST result might be (1) that vaso-
pressin was more effective when used earlier before patients
had become too sick (the mean time to study drug initiation
was approximately 12 hours after meeting eligibility), (2) that
the patients with more severe shock might have required a
higher dose of vasopressin because the maximum rate of va-
sopressinwaslimitedto0.03U/min,(3)thattherewasaharm-
ful interaction between vasopressin and high-dose norepi-
nephrine,or(4)itcouldhavebeenachancefindinginasubgroup
analysis, although the subgroups were large and prospec-
tively defined, and randomization was stratified by subgroup.
Further analyses from VASST suggested that vasopressin
mightimprovekidneyfunctioninpatientsatriskofkidneyfail-
ure and reduce rates of progression to kidney failure and loss,
but that it had no effect if acute kidney failure was already es-
tablished at the time of study inclusion.8 This was supported
by evidence from a study by Lauzier and colleagues5 that dem-
onstrated an improvement in creatinine clearance when vaso-
pressin was started in the first 12 hours of developing vasodi-
latory shock. Similarly in VASST, patients enrolled in the first
12hourstendedtohavebetteroutcomeswithvasopressintreat-
ment compared with norepinephrine, but not if enrolled after
12 hours.7 For this reason patients in this study were random-
ized as early as possible, and at a maximum of 6 hours after de-
veloping hypotension. Despite this early recruitment, a num-
ber of patients already had developed acute kidney failure at
the time of inclusion. However, there was no significant dif-
ferenceinthenumberofpatientswhohadkidneyfailureatany
time or progressed to kidney failure after randomization. Al-
though there was no significant difference in rates of kidney
failure, there was a lower rate of use of renal replacement
therapy in the patients treated with vasopressin. The use of re-
nal replacement therapy was not controlled in this trial, and it
was started based on local clinical decision. It is therefore not
possible to know why renal replacement therapy was or was
not started. Because the trial was double-blinded, it is un-
likely to be due to any obvious clinician bias. It is possible the

difference in rates of renal replacement therapy reflects the
slightly lower creatinine values and higher urine outputs seen
in the patients treated with vasopressin, particularly on days
3 through 6. Although use of renal replacement therapy was
not the primary outcome of this trial, it is an important patient-
centered outcome, and therefore this result may be important
when planning patient treatment strategies.
To ensure that patients with more severe shock were
treated with an adequate dose of vasopressin, the dose of va-
sopressin was titrated up to 0.06 U/min, double the dose used
in VASST. In another randomized clinical trial, a dose of
0.067 U/min restored cardiovascular function more effec-
tively than 0.033 U/min, without a difference in adverse
events.9 In the previous pilot trial, an infusion rate of
0.06 U/min of vasopressin led to mean plasma levels of around
300 pmol/L, well above the physiological levels seen in other
shock states.11 Although the trial by Lauzier et al,5 which had
demonstrated an improved creatinine clearance, used a vaso-
pressin dose up to 0.2 U/min, there was concern that higher
doses might lead to adverse effects, such as ischemia from ex-
cessive vasoconstriction. The mean dose of vasopressin was
0.06 U/min, and the mean dose of norepinephrine or epineph-
rine was 0.55 μg/kg/min, when the potentially drug-related
serious adverse events occurred. In view of the uncertainty
about what is the ideal blood pressure to target in septic
shock,18 clinicians need to balance the potential benefits of an
increased blood pressure against the risk of vasopressor-
related adverse events, particularly at high dose and should
set blood pressure targets for individual patients.
TheotherpotentiallyimportantfindingfromVASSTthatin-
formed this trial was the potential interaction with corticoste-
roids. There are several possible biological interactions includ-
ing that vasopressin binds to V1b receptors in the anterior
pituitary that then leads to adrenocorticotropin hormone
release19 and corticosteroids have been shown to restore
cytokine-mediateddown-regulationofvasopressinreceptors.20
Patients in VASST who received vasopressin and corticoste-
roids had reduced mortality rates compared with patients who
received norepinephrine and corticosteroids. In contrast with
patients who did not receive corticosteroids, patients treated
with norepinephrine had better outcomes.10 Other retrospec-
tive studies also suggested that patients treated with the com-
bination of vasopressin and corticosteroids had reduced mor-
tality rates compared with patients receiving vasopressin
alone.21,22 In view of the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines that rec-
ommend only using hydrocortisone (200 mg/d) if hypoten-
sion is not responding to fluid and vasopressor therapy,2 corti-
costeroids were only administered once study drug 1 was at its
maximal infusion rate (vasopressin 0.06 U/min or norepineph-
rine 12 μg/min). As in the pilot study,11 corticosteroids reduced
vasopressin requirements but there was no difference in mor-
tality rates and no evidence of an interaction between vaso-
pressin and corticosteroids on outcome. Although not all pa-
tients required study drug 2 (hydrocortisone or placebo), the
resultsweresimilarintheas-treatedandtheper-protocolanaly-
ses. However, because many patients did not require or re-
ceive study drug 2, the power to assess an interaction was lim-
ited and restricts the interpretation of this finding.
Limitations of this study need to be considered. The mul-
ticenter nature of the trial was designed to test the effective-
ness of early vasopressin use in the treatment of septic shock
in normal clinical practice. Other co-interventions, timing of
initiation of renal replacement therapy, or levels of hemody-
namic monitoring were not controlled, other than specifying
that sites should follow the international guidelines.14 Be-
cause the trial was blinded and randomization was stratified
by center, we would expect these other factors to be balanced
between groups and therefore unlikely to affect the overall re-
sult. Another important limitation is that only short time out-
comes,28-dayandhospitalmortalitywerecollected,andthere-
fore any long-term differences between treatment groups
cannotbeassessed.Similarly,noformalhealtheconomicanaly-
sis was originally planned, but the lower rate of renal replace-
ment therapy in the vasopressin-treated patients means that
this could be an important future assessment. Although there
was no difference in the distribution or number of kidney
failure–free days between vasopressin and norepinephrine
groups, the 95% confidence intervals of the difference be-
tween groups has an upper limit of 5 days in favor of vasopres-
sin, which would be clinically important. Therefore, these re-
sults are still consistent with a potentially clinically important
benefit for vasopressin but a larger trial would be needed to
confirm or refute this.
Conclusions
Among adults with septic shock, the early use of vasopressin
compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number
ofkidneyfailure–freedays.Althoughthesefindingsdonotsup-
port the use of vasopressin to replace norepinephrine as ini-
tial treatment in this situation, the confidence interval in-
cluded a potential clinically important benefit for vasopressin,
and larger trials may be warranted to assess this further.
