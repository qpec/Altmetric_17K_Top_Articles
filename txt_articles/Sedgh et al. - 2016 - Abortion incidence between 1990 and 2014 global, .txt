Summary
Background—Information about the incidence of induced abortion is needed to motivate and 
inform efforts to help women avoid unintended pregnancies and to monitor progress toward that 
end. We estimate subregional, regional, and global levels and trends in abortion incidence for 1990 
to 2014, and abortion rates in subgroups of women. We use the results to estimate the proportion 
of pregnancies that end in abortion and examine whether abortion rates vary in countries grouped 
by the legal status of abortion.
Methods—We requested abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from 
international sources and nationally representative studies. With data for 1069 country-years, we 
estimated incidence using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion 
rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age defined by their 
marital status and contraceptive need and use, and the sizes of these subgroups.
Findings—We estimated that 35 abortions (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 33 to 44) occurred 
annually per 1000 women aged 15–44 years worldwide in 2010–14, which was 5 points less than 
40 (39–48) in 1990–94 (90% UI for decline −11 to 0). Because of population growth, the annual

 number of abortions worldwide increased by 5·9 million (90% UI −1·3 to 15·4), from 50·4 million 
in 1990–94 (48·6 to 59·9) to 56·3 million (52·4 to 70·0) in 2010–14. In the developed world, the 
abortion rate declined 19 points (–26 to −14), from 46 (41 to 59) to 27 (24 to 37). In the 
developing world, we found a non-significant 2 point decline (90% UI −9 to 4) in the rate from 39 
(37 to 47) to 37 (34 to 46). Some 25% (90% UI 23 to 29) of pregnancies ended in abortion in 
2010–14. Globally, 73% (90% UI 59 to 82) of abortions were obtained by married women in 
2010–14 compared with 27% (18 to 41) obtained by unmarried women. We did not observe an 
association between the abortion rates for 2010–14 and the grounds under which abortion is 
legally allowed.
Interpretation—Abortion rates have declined significantly since 1990 in the developed world 
but not in the developing world. Ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health care could help 
millions of women avoid unintended pregnancies and ensure access to safe abortion.

Introduction
Periodic estimates of the incidence of induced abortion (hereafter referred to as abortion) are 
needed to monitor progress towards reducing the unmet need for effective contraception and 
the incidence of unintended pregnancy. These estimates can also motivate investments in 
helping women avoid the recourse to and consequences of unsafe abortion where safe 
abortion is not available.
However, reliable data for abortion incidence are not consistently available across countries. 
Past estimates of global abortion incidence relied on available abortion data and on 
qualitative assessments of exchangeability to make inference to countries and territories 
lacking data. 1–3 After the last global estimates were made, country-specific estimates of the 
level of contraceptive use and unmet need for contraception among married women, and the 
proportions of women who are married, were published. 4–6 These estimates, and their 
association with abortion incidence,7,8 make possible a systematic, model-based approach to 
estimating abortion incidence. This is in line with methods used recently to estimate other 
global health indicators, such as causes of maternal death9 and the incidence of anaemia10 
and maternal and child mortality.11–13
In this analysis, we aimed to estimate subregional, regional, and global levels and trends in 
abortion incidence for 1990 to 2014.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous estimates of global abortion incidence were made for 1995, 2003, and 2008. 
These estimates relied on abortion data from various sources and qualitative assessments

 of exchangeability to make inference from existing data to countries and territories 
lacking data.
Added value of this study
We use an updated database of abortion incidence estimates and newly available annual 
estimates of factors associated with abortion incidence across all countries to develop 
model-based estimates of abortion incidence for 1990–2014.
We compiled a database on abortion incidence for the period 1990 to 2014 from official 
statistics and nationally representative studies. The Guttmacher Institute updated its 
database with information from official statistics obtained from countries with liberal 
abortion laws, United Nations Demographic Yearbook reports for countries with liberal 
and restrictive laws, and searches of published and unpublished reports based on 
nationally representative studies in countries with restrictive abortion laws. PubMed and 
Google searches were carried out with keywords “abortion incidence” followed, one by 
one, by the name of each country with a restrictive abortion law.
We also examined the results from an ongoing systematic review with a primary focus on 
abortion safety at WHO for additional evidence on incidence. This review entailed 
searches of PubMed, POPLINE, and Embase without language restrictions; Lilacs and 
Scielo to identify Spanish and Portuguese language literature; and BDSP and Inedoc to 
identify French-language literature.
The data collection effort resulted in abortion incidence data for 1069 country-years. We 
also compiled estimates made by the UNPD on the proportion of women of reproductive 
age who are married, and of contraceptive need and use among married women of 
reproductive age. These factors are known to be associated with abortion incidence.
We developed a Bayesian hierarchical time series model to construct country-year-
specific estimates for 184 countries from 1990 to 2014, using all available data and 
information on marital status and contraceptive use among women of reproductive age. 
We used the country-period estimates to produce abortion incidence estimates for 5-year 
periods globally and for all world regions and subregions.
We estimate that the abortion rate declined significantly in the developed world from 46 
(41–59) per 1000 women aged 15–44 years in 1990–94 to 27 (24–37) in 2010–14. The 
abortion rate in 2010–14 was higher in the developing world than in the developed world 
at 37 (34–46), and the decline in the developing world from 39 (37–47) in 1990–94 was 
not significant.
Implications of all the available evidence
The findings underscore that investments are needed to meet women’s and couples’ 
contraceptive needs and ensure access to safe abortion care, especially in the developing 
world, where abortion rates are high and many abortions are unsafe. Reliable estimates of 
abortion incidence in the developing world are scarce and additional research in this area 
is needed to improve our ability to monitor and more accurately estimate trends in this 
region.

 Methods
Framework
We developed a theoretical framework in which abortion incidence is estimated as the sum 
of abortions in subgroups of women of reproductive age defined by their marital status and 
contraceptive need and use. Separately for married and unmarried women, these subgroups 
are women with an unmet need for any contraception, those using a contraceptive method 
and expected to experience a method failure, and those classified as not needing 
contraception (either because they wish to have a child or because they are infecund). 
Because of data constraints, we examined abortion incidence in four subgroups of women: 
married women with unmet need, those with met need, and those with no need for 
contraception; and all unmarried women (panel). Married women are defined as women in 
formal marriages or in non-marital cohabiting unions. Abortion incidence in the subgroups 
might vary with coital frequency, fecundity, the strength of motivation to avoid carrying an 
unintended pregnancy to term, and a woman’s ability to act on her preferences. Proxies for 
these measures were considered for inclusion in the model, as described below. A detailed 
technical explanation of the model is in the appendix (pp 2–8).
Panel
Definitions of women as classified into groups used by the United Nations 
Population Division (UNPD)
•
Unmarried women: women who are neither formally married nor living in a 
cohabiting union.
•
Married women: comprised of (1) women who have been married and are not 
divorced, widowed, or separated and (2) women who are living in a 
cohabiting union. Women in “visiting partnerships” in the Caribbean region 
are also classified by the UNPD as married.
•
Married women of reproductive age with no need: this group includes married 
women who want to be pregnant soon (in the next 2 years) and those who are 
currently pregnant with an intended pregnancy, have recently had an intended 
birth, or are infecund.
•
Married women of reproductive age who use contraception but become 
pregnant: this is the sum of the number of women using a specific method × 
method-specific failure rate, for all methods, including traditional methods.
•
Married women of reproductive age with unmet need for contraception: this 
group is comprised of married women who are fecund and who do not want a 
child soon (in the next 2 years) or at all and are not using a modern or 
traditional method of contraception. Pregnant women who identify their 
current pregnancy as unintended, and women experiencing post-partum 
amenorrhoea after an unintended pregnancy, are included in this group.

 Abortion incidence data
We searched for abortion incidence data for every country and major territory in the world 
for 1990–2014. Data were obtained from official statistics and published or unpublished 
national studies.
We obtained data for abortion for 962 country-years from official statistics compiled by 
country agencies. For 527 of these observations, key informants, including contact persons 
at relevant agencies, indicated that reports were incomplete (appendix p 6); for these 
observations, we treated the reported numbers as the minimum numbers of abortions 
performed. For observations in eight countries or territories where the extent of under-
reporting could be quantified, statistics were adjusted accordingly (appendix p 55).
For 26 country-years, we obtained abortion estimates from nationally representative surveys 
of women in countries with liberal abortion laws. Women are known to under-report their 
abortions in surveys, and a review of validation studies indicated that reported abortions in 
countries with liberal abortion laws represent 30–80% of true incidence.14 We used the mean 
level of reporting observed in the review (55%) to adjust the survey-based estimates.
For 81 country-years, abortion estimates were based on other types of nationally 
representative studies. The most common of these were censuses of abortion providers in the 
USA15 and studies that use an indirect approach to estimate abortion incidence in 
developing countries (as defined by the United Nations Population Division).16 The 
censuses are deemed to include all abortions. The net direction of the potential sources of 
bias in the other nationally representative studies is not known, therefore no adjustment was 
made to these estimates.
We obtained data for 1069 country-years. Of these, 625 were for countries in Europe, 239 
for Asia, 74 for Latin America and the Caribbean, 40 for North America, 40 for Oceania, 
and 51 for Africa (appendix p 56). Data were available for 92 countries and territories, and 
data for 2 or more years were available for 74 countries. The proportions of countries and 
territories with at least one estimate of abortion incidence, by geographic area and time 
period, are in the appendix (p 57). The proportion of women of reproductive age represented 
by at least one observation of abortion incidence are in the appendix (p 58).
We assessed the likely random error associated with the abortion data that were used as 
inputs, based on information in reports and input from key informants. Expected SEs ranged 
from 2·5% to 20% (appendix p 59). Sensitivity tests show that the main findings are robust 
to the SEs assumed around the abortion data (appendix pp 15–16).
To aid in the estimation of abortion rates in subgroups of women by marital status, 
information about the proportion of all abortions obtained by unmarried women was 
collected from official statistics and nationally representative surveys (appendix pp 60–63). 
We obtained 177 observations for 35 countries. Because of differences in the definition of 
marital status, we treated 162 of the observations as minimum or maximum estimates of the 
percent of abortions to unmarried women. Additionally, estimates were available from the 
USA of the proportion of abortions obtained by married women with unmet need, met need,

 and no need for contraception and these were treated as data inputs.17,18 The numbers and 
distributions of observations related to abortion by type of observation and data source are 
summarised in the appendix p 64).
Sizes of subgroups
Estimates of the number of women of reproductive age, the percent of these women who are 
married, and the percent of married women with unmet need for contraception, no 
contraceptive need, and met need, by country and year for 1990–2014, for women aged 15–
49 years for 184 countries, were taken from the United Nations Population Division 
(UNDP).4, 19 Distributions of women across the subgroups are shown in the appendix (p 65).
To estimate the proportion of married contraceptive users expected to experience 
contraceptive failure, we computed the sum of the percent of women using a method × the 
failure rate for that method, for all methods. We used method-specific contraceptive 
prevalence data from the UNPD20 and published method-specific user failure rates.21 We 
used a hierarchical regression model to estimate method-specific contraceptive prevalence 
for country-years without information on the basis of data from other years for that country 
and data from other countries in the subregion (appendix p 9).
Potential predictors of abortion rates (covariates)
We explored whether proxies for coital frequency, fecundity, the strength of women’s 
motivation to avoid carrying an unintended pregnancy to term, and their ability to act on 
their preferences, predict the estimated abortion rates in the subgroups of women. For coital 
frequency and fecundity, we used the age distribution of women of reproductive age 22,23 
(including the average age of married and unmarried women separately, as well as the 
percent of women in 5-year age groups).24 For women’s motivation and ability to act on 
their fertility intentions, we used female education (the percent of women who completed 
primary or secondary school)25–27 and national wealth (gross domesic product [GDP] per 
capita).
Statistical analysis
We developed a Bayesian hierarchical time series model in which the dependent variable 
was the number of abortions in a country-year. The predictors were the number of women of 
reproductive age in each of the four subgroups described above. The model did not include 
an intercept, and coefficients were constrained to be positive; thus, the coefficients represent 
abortion rates in population subgroups. The model was used to estimate country-period-
specific subgroup abortion rates, using the constraint that married women with no need for 
contraception would experience the lowest abortion rates and married women who 
experienced method failures would exhibit the highest rates of the four subgroups. The 
hierarchical aspect of the model allowed for exchange of information on the rates, as well as 
on changes in rates, between countries within subregions. By estimating subgroup rates, we 
were able to fit the model to data for the percent distribution of abortions by subgroup, in 
addition to the data for overall abortion incidence. We estimated abortion incidence for each 
subgroup for each country for each 5-year period (1990–94, etc), and the number of 
abortions as the sum of abortions in these subgroups. The model-based abortion estimates in

 countries change over time if subgroupspecific rates change and as the sizes of the 
subgroups change. Additional details about the analyses are in the appendix (pp 2–7).
In the hierarchical model, we used the UNPD classification of subregions. Because of data 
constraints, a few countries or subregions were merged with other subregions with similar 
measures on demographic and family planning indicators for the analysis (appendix p 66). 
Western Asia was divided into two regions because of heterogeneity on relevant factors. 
Final results are shown with original UNPD classifications of subregions.
Model choice, validation, and sensitivity analysis
We used in-sample and out-of-sample validation exercises to check model performance 
(appendix pp 10–14). In brief, we did validation exercises whereby 20% of the data were left 
out at random and ran simulations. The simulation results approximated the results that 
would be obtained if we treated each country as a random country without abortion data, 
given its subregion and its country-period-specific values for population composition and 
potential predictors of subgroup abortion rates (covariates). We noted that the hierarchical 
time series model did well in both sets of validation exercises.
We used statistical and theoretical criteria to assess the potential covariates (appendix p 10). 
Analyses showed that none of the covariates meaningfully improved upon the no-covariate 
model. Moreover, the implied associations between abortion rates and GDP per capita were 
not in the direction that we expected. We also observed that the no-covariate model yielded 
the most conservative (widest) uncertainty intervals and the most conservative (lowest) point 
estimates for developing countries (appendix p 14). Based on these findings, we chose the 
no-covariate model as the basis for the model-based estimates.
We investigated the sensitivity of the model-based estimates to various model assumptions 
(appendix pp 15–27). We noted that estimated overall abortion rates varied little between 
models with different assumptions, but estimated rates for subgroups of married women 
varied more substantially and were very uncertain. Hence, we focus the discussion of the 
results on the overall abortion rates and rates for married and unmarried women, which are 
deemed to be less sensitive to model assumptions.
Because the evidence base of abortion rates is scarce, we present abortion incidence for 5-
year periods rather than for each year, and we present rates for subregions rather than for 
countries. Abortion rates are presented as the total number of estimated abortions per 1000 
women aged 15–44 years. We defined differences as statistically significant at α of 0·9, two-
tailed; that is, if the posterior probability of a difference in the estimated direction was at 
least 95%. Details regarding computation of point estimates and uncertainty intervals are in 
the appendix (p 8).
Using the results, we calculated total pregnancy incidence and the percent of all pregnancies 
that end in abortion. The total number of pregnancies is the sum of all livebirths, abortions, 
and miscarriages (spontaneous fetal losses at 5 or more weeks of gestation). We used the UN 
Population Prospects’ estimates of livebirths19 and model-based estimates of abortions. To 
estimate miscarriages, we used an approach derived from life tables of pregnancy loss by

 gestational age based on clinical studies,23 which indicates that these events are equal to 
about 20% of births plus 10% of induced abortions.
We also used the results to examine how the estimated abortion rates in 2010–14 varied 
across groups of countries classified according to the grounds under which abortion is legal, 
as categorised by the US Center for Reproductive Rights.28

Results
We estimated that there were 35 abortions per 1000 women (90% UI 33–44) aged 15–44 
years worldwide each year in 2010–14 (table 1; figure 1). This represents a non-significant 5 
point decline (–11 to 0) since 1990–94, when the estimated rate was 40 abortions per 1000 
women (90% UI 39–48). Because of population growth, the absolute number of abortions 
increased by 5·9 million (90% UI −1·3 to 15·4), from 50·4 million per year (48·6 to 59·9) in 
1990–94 to 56·3 million per year (52·4 to 70·0) in 2010–14 (table 2).
In the developed world, the annual abortion rate declined significantly and substantially by 
19 points (–26 to −14) from 46 abortions per 1000 women (90% UI 41 to 59) in 1990–94 to 
27 (24 to 37) in 2010–14. In the developing world, the 2 point decline (−9 to 4) in the 
abortion rate from 39 abortions per 1000 women (37 to 47) in 1990–94 to 37 (34 to 46) in 
2010–14 was not significant.
Of the 16 world subregions, the highest estimated annual rate in 2010–14 was in the 
Caribbean at 65 abortions per 1000 women (90% UI 48–107) and the lowest were in 
Northern America at 17 (16–18) and western Europe at 18 (14–31). The largest observed 
reduction between the first and last time periods was in eastern Europe, where the rate fell 
from 88 abortions per 1000 women (90% UI 80–107) in 1990–94 to 42 (38–51) in 2010–14. 
The abortion rate also fell in northern America and all the European subregions, except 
western Europe. Non-significant declines were noted in all the Asian subregions and in 
Northern Africa. The abortion rate is estimated to have increased significantly in western 
Europe by 5 points (1–11) from 13 abortions per 1000 women (90% UI 10–23) to 18 (14–
31). Non-significant increases were noted in western, middle, eastern, and southern Africa 
and in all the Latin American subregions.
Globally, 25% (23–29) of pregnancies ended in abortion in 2010–14 (table 3). In the 
developed world, the percent of pregnancies ending in abortion declined by 11 points (–15 to 
−9) from 39% (36 to 44) to 28% (26 to 33), whereas in the developing world, it increased 
significantly by 3 points (2 to 7) from 21% (20 to 24) to 24% (23 to 29). Pregnancy rates and 
numbers of pregnancies are shown in the appendix (pp 70–71).

 When countries were grouped according to the grounds under which abortion was legal, we 
did not find evidence that abortion rates for 2010–14 were associated with the legal status of 
abortion (table 4). The rate was 37 abortions per 1000 women (34–51) where abortion is 
prohibited altogether or allowed only to save a woman’s life, and 34 (29–46) where it is 
available on request.
The estimated annual abortion rate in 2010–14 was 36 (32–53) for all married women and 
25 (20–42) for unmarried women (table 5). The UIs for the subgroup rates are wide, but 
married women have higher abortion rates than unmarried women in most subregions, and 
this difference is significant in Europe (posterior probability 98·5%). In sub-Saharan Africa 
and north America, unmarried women have higher abortion rates than do married women; 
this difference is significant in western Africa (posterior probability 99·6%; appendix pp 19, 
22). In the developed world, the abortion rate declined more among married women than 
among unmarried women (posterior probability 98·4%; appendix pp 18–23). Globally, we 
estimate that for the period 2010–14, 27% (18–41) of abortions were obtained by unmarried 
women (who represent 35% of all women of reproductive age; figure 2).
Discussion
Our findings indicate the abortion rate declined significantly in the developed world, but not 
in the developing world, between 1990 and 2014. Although it is likely that current numbers 
and rates of abortion would be even higher in the absence of investments in family planning 
services in recent decades, the findings suggest that much more investment is needed to meet 
the demands of the growing population, the increasingly widespread desire for small 
families, and the growing strength of women’s and couples’ motivation to control family 
size and the timing of births.
We estimate that more than 15 million unmarried women obtained an abortion each year in 
2010–14. The findings should motivate efforts to ensure that unmarried women and their 
partners have access to the reproductive health services they need to prevent and manage 
unintended pregnancies.29
Although the estimated rates for subgroups of married women were sensitive to model 
assumptions, we found that a non-trivial number of abortions occur in all subgroups of 
married women, including women using a contraceptive method and those who had been 
classified as having no need for contraception. These findings suggest that some 
contraceptive users need more effective methods, methods better suited to their 
circumstances, more secure contraceptive supply, and information and counselling to help 
them use their methods more effectively and consistently. It is also the case that nearly all 
methods sometimes fail, even when used consistently and correctly.
Findings from the descriptive analysis presented here indicate that abortion rates are not 
substantially different across groups of countries classified according to the grounds under 
which abortion is legally allowed. The level of unmet need for contraception is higher in 
countries with the most restrictive abortion laws than in countries with the most liberal laws, 
and this contributes to the incidence of abortion in countries with restrictive laws. Additional

 research on women’s and couples’ decision making in the face of an unintended pregnancy 
in different legal settings and sociocultural contexts is needed to improve our understanding 
of the factors that influence the decision to have an abortion.
The estimates of abortion incidence for 1990–2014 are intended to override previously 
published estimates for 1995, 2003, and 2008.1 Our results corroborate the previously 
published finding that abortion incidence declined more substantially in the developed world 
than in the developing world, and extend this finding to 2010–14. The model-based abortion 
rates presented here are higher than those previously published for many regions (appendix 
pp 28–53). We expect that the previously published estimates were based on conservative 
assumptions, including conservative adjustments for under-reporting. Moreover, the current 
estimates drew from a larger body of information, including abortion rates, information 
about the composition of populations, and relationships between these factors.
Our estimates have several limitations. Information about abortion incidence in the 
developing world is scarce. The quantity and precision of data in developing regions are 
reflected in the wide uncertainty intervals around estimates for these regions. Empirical 
evidence to inform and validate the estimated rates for subgroups of married women is also 
lacking, and research on abortion incidence in these subgroups is needed.
Only proxy information was available for the potential predictors of subgroup rates—
namely, women’s strength of motivation to resolve an unintended pregnancy through 
abortion, their ability to do so, their fecundity, and the frequency of their sexual activity. The 
proxies for these potential predictors of subgroup abortion rates did not improve overall 
model performance. More research is needed to better understand and capture the covariates 
and their relationships with abortion incidence.
To estimate the number of women experiencing contraceptive failure, we required estimates 
of method-specific contraceptive failure rates. Because of data constraints, we assumed that 
contraceptive failure rates are fixed across place and time, but user effectiveness rates vary 
across populations.30–32 We might expect that method-specific failure rates, and therefore 
abortion rates among contraceptive users, are higher in developing countries with fairly 
weak family planning programmes than in developed countries. Sensitivity analyses indicate 
that the overall abortion rates in the subregions are not sensitive to assumptions about 
method failure rates (appendix pp 15–16).
Data limitations also required us to classify all unmarried women together rather than 
subdivide them according to whether they had an unmet or met need for contraception. 
Information about sexual activity, contraceptive need, and contraceptive use among 
unmarried women is available for a small proportion of all the countries and years in this 
analysis, and existing estimates can be compromised by under-reporting of sexual activity 
where premarital sex is stigmatised. It is also possible that the composition of the married 
subgroups varies across subregions and over time. For example, a larger share of women 
classified as having unmet need might be infecund or sexually inactive in some subregions 
than in others. However, the model’s ability to estimate different subgroup rates across 
countries, and different trends in rates across countries, provides one means to capture these

 differences. Validation exercises suggest that the model performs well for estimating overall 
abortion rates despite these limitations.
The availability of abortion data on which to base our estimates was also uneven across 
regions and time. As for any estimates based on inference, this approach relies on the 
assumption that abortion rates in countries without data are comparable to those in countries 
with similar characteristics but for which evidence is available.
This analysis represents a substantial improvement over approaches used previously to 
estimate abortion incidence. This undertaking brings formal model-based inference to 
worldwide abortion estimates for the first time. The modelling approach allowed us to make 
formal inference, present uncertainty intervals around the estimated abortion rates, and 
examine the robustness of the results with validation exercises and sensitivity analyses.
The increasingly widespread use of medical abortion (misoprostol with or without 
mifepristone) has made it more difficult to measure abortion incidence in many countries. To 
make these global estimates, we distinguished between data sources that are and are not 
likely to include all abortions, including medical abortions. Nevertheless, more rigorous data 
collection and estimation efforts are needed to ensure that medical abortions are not omitted 
from national statistics and studies of abortion incidence.
Although an induced abortion is a medically safe procedure when done in accordance with 
recommended guidelines,33 many women undergo unsafe abortions that put them at risk of 
physical harm. It is estimated that 6·9 million women in the developing world were treated 
for complications from unsafe abortion in 2012,34 and as many as 40% of women who need 
care do not obtain it.35 Estimates of the proportion of abortions that are unsafe, ideally with 
a gradation by severity of risk associated with the procedure,36 will help to bring attention to 
the magnitude of this public health problem and the need for policies and programmes to 
help to reduce the incidence and consequences of unsafe abortion.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals include the target of ensuring universal access to 
sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for contraceptive services. Achieving 
this goal would help millions of women to avoid unintended pregnancies and the need for 
abortion. But our findings indicate that, even if all couples who wished to avoid pregnancy 
used contraception, unintended pregnancies and abortions would occur because no method is 
perfect and methods are sometimes used imperfectly. Moreover, some women who want to 
have a child face circumstances that lead them to seek an abortion after they become 
pregnant. Access to safe abortion is necessary to help women seeking an abortion to avoid 
recourse to clandestine and unsafe procedures.
