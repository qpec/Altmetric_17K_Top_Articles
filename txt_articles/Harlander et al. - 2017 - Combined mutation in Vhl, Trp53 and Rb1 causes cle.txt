Abstract
Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) frequently exhibit inactivation of the VHL tumour 
suppressor gene and often harbour multiple copy number alterations in genes that regulate cell 
cycle progression. We show here that modelling these genetic alterations by combined renal 
epithelium-specific deletion of Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 in mice caused ccRCC. These tumours arose 
from proximal tubule epithelial cells and shared molecular markers and mRNA expression profiles 
with human ccRCC. Exome sequencing revealed that mouse and human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent 
mutations in genes associated with the primary cilium, uncovering a mutational convergence on 
this organelle and implicating a subset of ccRCCs as genetic ciliopathies. Different mouse tumours 
responded differently to standard therapies for advanced human ccRCC, mimicking the range of 
clinical behaviours in the human disease. Inhibition of HIF-α transcription factors with 
Acriflavine as third line therapy had therapeutic effects in some tumours, providing pre-clinical 
evidence for further investigation of HIF-α inhibition as a ccRCC treatment. This autochthonous 
mouse ccRCC model represents a tool to investigate the biology of ccRCC and to identify new 
treatment strategies.

 Introduction
Kidney cancers represent approximately 2-3% of all human cancers and ccRCC accounts for 
roughly 70% of all renal malignancies 1. Metastatic spread of ccRCC occurs in about half of 
all patients and despite ongoing improvements in clinical management due to the availability 
of several therapeutic options in the form of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint 
blocking agents, 5-year survival rates for patients with metastatic disease are still only 
around 8-12% 2,3. 82-92% of ccRCC tumours harbour biallelic inactivation of the von 
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene 4–6 and VHL mutations occur at the earliest 
stage of tumor formation 7. Patients with VHL disease inherit a mutant VHL allele and are 
predisposed to develop ccRCC. However, second hit VHL loss-of-function mutations in 
renal epithelial cells in VHL patients are insufficient to cause ccRCC in humans 8 and 
numerous renal-epithelial cell-specific Vhl knockout mice also failed to develop ccRCC 
(reviewed in 9), arguing that ccRCC formation requires mutations in addition to VHL. The 
presence of recurrent mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, PIK3CA, PTEN, 
MTOR and TP53, as well as copy number losses of CDKN2A and RB1 and gains of MDM4 
and MYC in human ccRCCs 6,10 argues that these genetic alterations may act cooperatively 
with VHL loss to induce ccRCC formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, kidney 
epithelial cell-specific co-deletion of Vhl with Pten 11, or with Kif3a to genetically ablate 
primary cilia 12, caused the formation of simple and atypical cystic lesions, mimicking the 
proposed precursor lesions of a subset of ccRCCs. Deletion of Vhl together with Trp53 gave 
rise to simple and atypical cystic lesions as well as small tumours containing cells that 
display cytoplasmic clearing and elevated mTORC1 activity 13, recapitulating some of the 
cellular and molecular changes that are characteristic of human ccRCC. Similar phenotypes 
were observed in mice with combined Vhl deletion and heterozygous loss of Bap1 14. While 
these mouse models reproduce ccRCC precursor lesions and small tumours with some of the 
features of ccRCC they do not fully reproduce all of the characteristics of human ccRCC. A 
very recent study 15 showed that combined deletion of Vhl and Pbrm1 causes renal cysts 
with subsequent development of ccRCCs after approximately 10 months, providing an 
autochthonous model that reflects the VHL/PBRM1 mutant genetic subset of human 
ccRCC. In this study we identify another genetic combination that gives rise to ccRCC, 
furthering our understanding of the spectrum of molecular causes of this disease and 
providing an autochthonous mouse model to test new therapeutic strategies.
Results
Human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent copy number gains and losses of genes regulating p53 
and the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint
To gain further insight into genetic changes that arise in ccRCC we utilised cBioPortal 16,17 
to reanalyze genomic data from 448 sporadic ccRCCs from the TCGA dataset 10. We 
focused on alterations in the network of genes that regulate p53 and the G1-S cell cycle 
transition, including TP53, MDM2, MDM4, CDK inhibitor family genes, RB family genes, 
CYCLINs and CDKs. While loss- or gain-of-function nucleotide level mutations in these 
genes occur rarely in ccRCC, copy number losses of negative regulators or gains of positive 
regulators of the network are common. 68% of human ccRCCs harbour a chromosomal copy

 number alteration in at least one of these genes and most (78%) of these tumours harbour 
multiple simultaneous alterations (Supplementary Figure 1a). Patients with tumours that 
display alteration in at least one gene in the p53/G1-S network signature have a worse 
outcome than those without these genetic alterations (Supplementary Figure 1b). Alterations 
in other frequently mutated ccRCC genes including VHL, PBRM1, BAP1 and SETD2 are 
not enriched in the p53/G1-S network signature tumours (Supplementary Figure 1a), arguing 
that alterations of genes in this network arise independently of other putative mutational 
selection pressures during ccRCC evolution. These data give rise to the hypothesis that 
during the evolution of the majority of ccRCCs there is a selection for multiple copy number 
alterations that are predicted to alter the integrity of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, 
promoting tumour initiation and progression.
Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 deletion allows the evolution of ccRCC in mice
To functionally test this idea in mice, we genetically deleted Vhl together with two tumour 
suppressor genes that encode proteins that function as the key controllers of cell cycle entry 
in the p53/G1-S network, namely Trp53 (encoding p53) and Rb1 (encoding pRB). We 
generated mice that allow inducible renal epithelial cell-specific (Ksp1.3-CreERT2) 18 
homozygous deletion of loxP-flanked alleles of Rb1, Vhl/Rb1, Trp53/Rb1 and Vhl/
Trp53/Rb1 to complement our previous analyses of the effects of Vhl and Vhl/Trp53 
deletion 11,13. Epithelial cell-specific gene deletion throughout the nephron, including in 
proximal tubule epithelial cells 18, the likely cell of origin of ccRCC 19, was induced in 
pups by injecting nursing dams with tamoxifen or by feeding six week-old mice with 
tamoxifen-containing food. These two treatments yielded identical results and have been 
pooled for the purposes of the following descriptions. Hereafter Δ/Δ refers to deleted alleles. 
Littermate mice lacking the Ksp1.3-CreERT2 transgene served as wild type controls, 
denoted by +/+. While p53 was not detectable by immunohistochemical staining, loss of 
immunoreactivity for pRB confirmed Rb1 deletion in all genotypes and the nuclear 
accumulation of HIF-1α in VhlΔ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ and VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys confirmed 
Vhl deletion (Supplementary Figure 2a). Kidneys of Rb1Δ/Δ (n=35 mice) and VhlΔ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ 
(n=29 mice) mice displayed occasional sites of subtle disorganization of renal tubular 
epithelia 50-57 weeks after gene deletion (Figure 1a,b). Trp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys (n=12 
mice) displayed small cysts (1-5 cysts per kidney section) (Figure 1c), as well as occasional 
sites of cystic or tubular dysplasia (Figure 1d,e) within 46-54 weeks of gene deletion. In 
contrast, within 30-47 weeks of gene deletion, 10 of 25 VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice 
developed a total of 64 tumours (Figure 1f-i). Mice that did not develop tumours showed an 
equivalent extent of tubular immunoreactivity for CA9 (Supplementary Figure 2b), a marker 
of Vhl deletion and HIF-α activation, to histologically normal tubules in kidneys with 
tumours, showing that the absence of tumours in these mice was not caused by failure of 
activation of Cre. The presence of apparent small precursor lesions in these mice 
(Supplementary Figure 2b) implies that tumours may potentially have developed at later 
timepoints. To follow up these observations in new cohorts of mice, we first established that 
the emergence of tumours in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice could be monitored using 
contrast-assisted μCT imaging (Figure 1j) and followed tumour onset over time in larger 
cohorts of Trp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ and VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice (Figure 1k). 31 of 38 (82%) 
VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice fed tamoxifen at 6 weeks of age developed a total of 159

 tumours within 25-61 weeks after tamoxifen treatment. In contrast, 6 of 25 (24%) 
Trp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice developed a total of 13 tumours within 50-70 weeks after tamoxifen. 
We conclude that Vhl deletion accelerates the onset and increases the incidence of tumour 
formation as well as increases the number of tumours per mouse. Interestingly, 
VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ male mice developed tumours at earlier timepoints and developed 
more tumours than female mice (Supplementary Figure 3a,b), consistent with the fact that 
human ccRCC is almost twice as likely to occur in males than females 20.
Based on the WHO 2016 criteria, all tumours in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice were classified 
as grade 3 or grade 4 ccRCCs growing in either acinar, solid or pseudo-papillary growth 
patterns (Figure 1l-p). Some tumours exhibited a cystic component (Figure 1h, tumour 2). 
60% of tumours contained cells with either completely optically clear cytoplasms (Figure 1l) 
or very weakly stained cytoplasms (Figure 1m). 28% of tumours exhibited more cytoplasmic 
eosin staining (Figure 1n) and resembled the eosinophilic variant of ccRCC. 5 tumours 
showed regions with obvious transitions between clear cell and eosinophilic morphology, 
arguing that these cytoplasmic appearances represent a continual phenotypic spectrum 
(Figure 1o). Indeed, similar eosinophilic cells can be found in high-grade human ccRCC or 
in hypoxic regions of ccRCC tumours. Regions of necrosis (data not shown) were observed 
in many of the mouse tumours and 2 tumours exhibited intratumoural haemorrhage (Figure 
1h, tumour 3). Necrosis and haemorrhage are also common features of human ccRCC. Two 
clear cell tumours also showed papillary-like features that arise rarely in VHL patients 
(Figure 1p) but did not show features of the newly described clear cell papillary RCC entity. 
These tumours were also distinguished from true papillary renal cell carcinomas by the 
absence of a fibrovascular core and absence of CK7 staining (data not shown). Importantly, 
irrespective of cytoplasmic morphology, all tumours displayed a highly developed vascular 
network of CD31- and von Willebrand Factor-positive thin-walled blood vessels enveloping 
clusters of carcinoma cells in a pseudoalveolar fashion (Figure 1q-t). These sinusoidal 
vascular structures are a characteristic diagnostic feature of human ccRCC. All tumours 
were confined to the kidney and exhibited pushing rather than infiltrative margins (Figure 
1u). There was no evidence of invasion into blood vessels, peri-renal fat or the renal pelvis. 
No metastases were observed in the lungs, liver, spleen, bones or brains of tumour-bearing 
mice (n=19). In contrast to the ccRCC tumours in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys, the 
tumours that arose in Trp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys exhibited a range of non-ccRCC phenotypes 
and were variously characterised by sarcomatoid and rhabdoid tumour cell morphologies, 
eosinophilic cytoplasms, comedonecrosis, atypical giant tumour cells and aberrant mitoses. 
(Supplementary Figure 4).
As well as ccRCCs, VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys exhibited a spectrum of lesions 
(Supplementary Figure 5) that recapitulate the putative precursor lesions that are found in 
human VHL patient kidneys, namely cysts with a single epithelial layer, cysts with 
proliferation of atypical cells growing in multilayered structures in the cystic lumen, as well 
as small solid lesions that appear to have no cystic component. ccRCCs in this model 
therefore appear to arise via both cystic and solid precursor lesions.

 Mouse ccRCCs are molecularly similar to human ccRCCs
Immunohistochemical stainings revealed numerous similarities between 
VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mouse ccRCCs and human ccRCCs (Figure 2). All mouse ccRCCs 
displayed nuclear accumulation of HIF-2α (n=41) and 75% displayed nuclear accumulation 
of HIF-1α (n=47), consistent with the fact that while most human ccRCCs express both 
HIF-1α and HIF-2α, approximately 30% express only HIF-2α but not HIF-1αΔ21. All 
tumours stained positively for the HIF-α target CA9 (n=46). It is noteworthy that 
histologically normal tubules in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys frequently exhibited 
HIF-1α, HIF-2α and CA9 immunoreactivity (Figure 2), demonstrating that these mutant 
cells had not become tumours within 9-11 months of gene deletion. All tumours showed 
strong staining for phospho-Thr37/46-4E-BP1 (n=44), indicative of strong mTORC1 
activation, a common feature of human ccRCC. In contrast, antibodies against phospho-
Thr202/Tyr204-ERK1/2, a marker of activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway, labelled only 
rare cells in most tumours (n=44). All tumours showed strong immunoreactivity for PAX8 
(n=47) (Figure 2) and pan-cytokeratin (n=47) (Supplementary Figure 6), which are clinical 
diagnostic markers for ccRCC. 39 of 43 tumours stained positively for CD10, 37 of 43 
stained positively for AQP1 and 14 of 43 stained positively for NAPI2A (Supplementary 
Figure 6). All tumours were positive for at least one of these proximal tubule marker 
proteins and no tumour (n=43) displayed immunoreactivity for markers of loops of Henle 
(THP), distal tubules (NCC) or collecting ducts (AQP2) (Supplementary Figure 6). We 
conclude that even though the Cre driver induces gene deletion widely throughout the 
nephron, VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mouse ccRCCs arise from proximal tubule epithelial cells.
In contrast to tumours in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys, which exhibited uniform positive 
staining of HIF-1α and CA9, tumours in Trp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ kidneys stained positively only in 
specific regions, often bordering on necrotic areas, which are typically hypoxic in most 
types of tumours (Supplementary Figure 4). 11 of 11 tumours were positive for the proximal 
tubule marker CD10, 2 of 11 for NAPI2A and 0 of 11 for THP, implicating the proximal 
tubule as the likely cell of origin (Supplementary Figure 4).
We next utilized RNA sequencing to compare global mRNA abundance between 6 mouse 
ccRCCs and 3 non-transgenic kidney cortices from littermate Vhlfl/flTrp53fl/flRb1fl/fl mice. 
Multidimensional scaling analysis demonstrated a clear segregation of global gene 
expression profiles between normals and tumours (Supplementary Figure 7a,b) with 1852 
genes significantly upregulated more than 2-fold and 2010 genes significantly 
downregulated more than 2-fold (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 1). Of the human 
orthologues of these mouse ccRCC differentially expressed genes, 37% were also present in 
a list of differentially expressed genes identified by comparing 72 normal kidney and 533 
human ccRCC samples (Figure 3b). Moreover, correlation analysis between human ccRCC 
and mouse ccRCC of the average expression values for all unique orthologous gene pairs 
revealed a strong correlation in global transcriptional profiles, in particular for those genes 
that are highly expressed (Figure 3c). These data demonstrate that there are strong 
transcriptional similarities between the mouse ccRCC model and human ccRCCs. 
Predominant transcriptional signatures in mouse ccRCCs included upregulation of a set of 
HIF-1α and HIF-2α target genes that we previously identified as being upregulated

 following deletion of Vhl in primary renal epithelial cells 22 (Figure 3d), upregulation of 
numerous genes that regulate cell cycle progression, DNA replication and mitosis (Figure 
3e) as well as upregulation of a set of genes that regulate immune responses and 
inflammation (Figure 3f). Global comparisons of mouse ccRCC mRNA expression with 
gene expression profiles of micro-dissected normal mouse nephron segments 23 revealed 
strong expression correlations of all tumours with S1 and S3 proximal tubule segments but 
not with other nephron segments (Figure 3g). These data strongly argue that the proximal 
tubule is the origin of ccRCCs in this model, consistent with similar gene expression 
correlation analyses of human ccRCC 19 and with our immunohistochemical stainings.
Mouse ccRCCs exhibit similar genetic mutational profiles to human ccRCCs
The observation that ccRCCs arise in vivo after a relatively long latency implies that 
additional mutational events likely accumulate to allow tumour formation. To identify such 
cooperating genetic alterations we conducted exome sequencing of DNA isolated from 7 
mouse ccRCCs and normal liver tissue from these 6 mice. An average of 4.52 ± 0.56 x 107 
total reads were obtained per sample, giving mean target coverages of 56 ± 5 fold. Specific 
losses of sequencing coverage of the loxP-flanked regions of the Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 genes 
confirmed that tumours are triply mutant for all three genes (Supplementary Figure 7c). 
Copy number variants in tumours were determined by comparing to matched liver samples. 
All tumours exhibited a normal autosomal karyotype without evidence of whole 
chromosome aneuploidy. Large regions of gain and loss were rare but a total of 55 regions of 
copy number variation were identified. We focused analyses on named genes that were 
present in the minimal overlapping chromosomal regions of gain or loss between different 
tumours or that were amplified (present in 4 or more copies) in individual tumours (Figure 
4a and Supplementary Table 2). Notably, 2 tumours harboured amplifications (estimated 
copy numbers of 59 and 66) of the Myc oncogene (Figure 4a, Supplementary Figure 7d) and 
these tumours exhibited very high levels of Myc mRNA (Figure 3e). Copy number gains or 
amplifications of MYC occur in 8-15% of human ccRCC and are associated with poor 
patient survival 10,24,25 (Figure 4c). We identified regions of human-mouse synteny and 
investigated whether similar copy number variations arise in human ccRCCs. Interestingly, 
when human tumours exhibit copy number gains of genes that were gained in the mouse 
ccRCCs, or losses of genes that were lost in the mouse ccRCCs, they almost invariably (with 
the exception of the DYNTL1 syntenic region) arise specifically in the p53/G1-S network set 
of human tumours (Figure 4b), arguing that the copy number alterations in the mouse model 
are non-random and that they may participate in the evolution and progression of a subset of 
ccRCC. Consistent with this notion, copy number gain of SYCP1 in human ccRCC predicts 
poor patient survival (Figure 4c).
Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (InDels) were identified in 
mouse ccRCCs versus matched liver. The most frequent SNVs were C>A/G>T 
transversions, C>T/G>A transitions and A>G/T>C transitions (Figure 5a). These three 
classes of mutations are also the most frequently occurring in human ccRCC 10 
demonstrating that the mouse model reproduces the same classes of mutations that arise in 
human ccRCC. Mouse ccRCCs exhibited 161 ± 17 non-synonymous mutations per tumour 
and these were almost entirely attributable to SNVs rather than InDels (Figure 5b). Human

 ccRCCs exhibit 50.6 ± 20.3 non-synonymous mutations per tumour (n=382, cBioPortal), 
suggesting that VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mouse ccRCCs do not appear to harbour fewer 
mutations than the human counterparts, a limitation of some genetically engineered mouse 
tumour models 26. To narrow the search for potential truncal or clonal cooperating 
mutations, we focused further analyses on the set of truncating and frameshift mutations that 
were present at variant allele frequency (VAF) greater than or equal to 5% plus non-
synonymous coding mutations that were present at high (>25%) VAF (Supplementary Table 
3). While mutations of mouse orthologues of commonly mutated genes in human ccRCC, 
including Pbrm1, Bap1 and Setd2 were not observed in these tumours, gene set enrichment 
analysis demonstrated striking enrichment in genes associated with GO terms for Cell 
Projection Part (P = 3.91 x 10-14), Vesicle Mediated Transport (P = 5.89 x 10-11) and 
Microtubule Cytoskeleton (P = 1.71 x 10-9), amongst other related gene sets. Further 
inspection revealed the recurrence of mutations in genes that are involved in regulating the 
structure or function of the primary cilium. Each of the 7 tumours exhibited one or more 
mutations in 12 primary cilium-related genes (Figure 5c), including Kif3a and Kif3b, which 
encode components of the Kinesin-2 microtubule motor complex that is necessary for the 
generation of primary cilia. Genetic deletion of Kif3a cooperates with loss of Vhl or Vhl/
Trp53 to promote the formation of ccRCC precursor lesions in mice 12,27. 11 of 12 of the 
human orthologues of these genes are mutated in small percentages of human ccRCCs, and 
extending the list to include other known human ciliopathy genes and genes for which there 
is evidence for a function in primary cilium biology, we identified that 40% of human 
ccRCCs harbour one or more mutations in primary cilium-related genes (Supplementary 
Figure 8). Importantly, these mutations are largely mutually exclusive of one another, and of 
PTEN mutations. We have previously shown that Pten mutation cooperates with Vhl 
mutation to reduce the frequency of ciliated renal epithelial cells and induces renal cysts 11. 
Similar to human ccRCCs 28, all mouse ccRCCs exhibited a reduced frequency of ciliated 
tumour cells (Figure 5d). These data uncover a mutational convergence on primary cilium-
related genes in mouse and human ccRCCs.
Therapeutic studies using the mouse ccRCC model
Having established many molecular similarities between mouse and human ccRCC, together 
with the demonstration that different mouse ccRCCs are genetically distinct from one 
another, we next asked whether this model is useful for pre-clinical therapeutic studies. 
Patients with metastatic ccRCC typically receive anti-angiogenic therapy in the form of 
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Sunitinib. Up to 20% of tumours are refractory to 
these therapies and the majority of patients typically develop resistance within 1 year. 
Second line therapy often involves mTOR inhibition (eg. Everolimus), which confers a 
moderate increase in progression-free survival compared to placebo. We first mimicked this 
therapeutic regime by monitoring tumour initiation and progression in 
VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice using contrast-assisted μCT imaging and we initiated therapy 
once the largest tumour in each mouse reached a volume of approximately 20-70 mm3 
(Figure 6a,b). Of 19 independent tumours in 4 mice, 6 tumours grew at a rapid rate under 
Sunitinib treatment, 3 tumours regressed and 10 were stable with no or slow growth (Figure 
6c). Of these latter tumours, 6 developed resistance within 2-3 weeks and grew rapidly. 
Second line therapy with Everolimus showed stable disease or regression in 18 of 23

 tumours (several new tumours developed during Sunitinib therapy), 4 of which developed 
resistance (Figure 6c). Thus, individual ccRCCs in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice are 
differently sensitive to clinical agents used to treat human ccRCC, further validating the 
accuracy of the mouse model and suggesting that this model will be useful to interrogate 
mechanisms or identify biomarkers that are associated with therapeutic sensitivity or 
resistance.
Acriflavine, a drug that was given orally as a urinary antiseptic in the 1920s, was recently 
identified to inhibit the dimerization of HIF-1α and HIF-2α with HIF-1β, blocking 
transcriptional activation 29. Acriflavine treatment was shown to reduce the growth of 
various cancer cell lines in xenograft assays and reduce colorectal cancer growth in an 
autochthononous mouse model 29,30. Given the important pathogenic role of dysregulated 
HIF-α activity in human ccRCC we tested Acriflavine in the above-described mice as third 
line therapy after Sunitinib and Everolimus. Daily intraperitoneal injection slowed growth of 
2 of 23 tumours and one large tumour that was resistant to Everolimus showed an initial 
regression but developed resistance after 3 weeks of Acriflavine therapy (Figure 6b,c). 3 
smaller tumours regressed during Acriflavine therapy, while other similarly sized tumours in 
the same mice increased in size (Figure 6c, Supplementary Figure 9). While these proof-of-
principle studies identified that this drug is effective in only a subset of tumours, these 
results provide further pre-clinical evidence to support the ongoing development and clinical 
testing of various HIF-α inhibitors with better specificities and pharmacological properties 
as therapies for ccRCC. This mouse model represents an experimental platform that should 
assist in the identification of biomarkers that could be used to predict which human ccRCC 
tumours are likely to respond to HIFα-inhibition.
Discussion
This study describes an autochthonous mouse model of ccRCC that accurately recapitulates 
the cellular and molecular features of human ccRCC. While the exact combination of 
biallelic inactivation of VHL, TP53 and RB1 is not common in human ccRCC tumours, 
VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice represent a genetic background that models the predicted 
effects of the many combinatorial gene copy number alterations in regulators of the 
interconnected networks governing the p53 pathway and the G1-S cell cycle control 
machinery that arise in human ccRCC. The VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ genetic background does 
not automatically confer tumour-forming capacity on renal epithelial cells in vivo but rather 
permits the evolution of genetically distinct ccRCC tumours. The dependency of these 
tumours on Vhl mutation is clearly shown by the accelerated and increased incidence of 
tumour formation in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice compared to Trp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice, as well 
as the fact that only VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice develop ccRCCs. These functional genetic 
data are consistent with the fact that VHL is biallelically inactivated as an initiating event in 
the vast majority of ccRCCs 6,7,10. We identified a mutational convergence on genes that 
regulate the structure or function of the primary cilium in mouse ccRCCs and in 40% of 
human ccRCCs. Due to their individual relative rarity, these mutations had been previously 
missed by statistical analyses to identify recurrent mutations but when considered in the 
larger biological context we propose that at least a subset of ccRCC can be viewed as 
genetic ciliopathies. While further functional studies will be necessary to establish whether

 the mutations that we identified in ccRCC play a pathogenic role in the disease, given that a 
common phenotypic outcome of genetic alterations in diverse genes that are important for 
cilia biology is the induction of renal epithelial cell proliferation and cyst formation 31, it 
appears likely that primary cilium gene mutations might either permit or enhance the 
proliferation of VHL mutant cells. In this context, our previous studies have shown 
cooperation between loss of Vhl and loss of primary cilia in causing uncontrolled renal 
epithelial proliferation and development of simple and atypical cystic precursor lesions in 
mice 11,12,27,32. It is plausible that the combination of VHL mutation, primary cilium gene 
mutation and additional genetic alterations, such as in the p53 and G1-S cell cycle network 
or in other frequently mutated tumour suppressor genes like PBRM1, BAP1 or SETD2, act 
cooperatively to cause the evolution of ccRCC. It is noteworthy that none of the 7 mouse 
ccRCCs examined in this study showed mutations in these tumour suppressor genes, arguing 
that this model may reflect the approximately 50% of ccRCCs that do not harbour mutations 
in other known or suspected kidney cancer tumour suppressor genes.
The VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mouse ccRCC model will provide an opportunity to assess 
genetic dependencies and identify mutational modifiers that enhance tumour initiation or 
promote invasion and metastasis. Our gene copy number analyses identified several 
candidate genes, including the Myc oncogene and Loxl2, which have been implicated in 
various aspects of the pathogenesis of ccRCC 21,33–36. It is also noteworthy that all 
VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mouse ccRCCs showed high levels of mTORC1 activation, as 
evidenced by phospho-Thr37/46-4E-BP1 staining. PI3K-mTORC1 pathway activation was 
also observed in cysts or tumours in Vhl/Pten 11, Vhl/Trp53 13, Vhl/Trp53/Kif3a 27, Vhl/
Bap1 14 and Vhl/Pbrm1 15 mutant mice, suggesting that PI3K-mTORC1 pathway activation 
might generally promote ccRCC evolution in the context of diverse cooperating mutations.
The fact that different VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ ccRCCs are genetically distinct from one 
another, coupled with our observations that different ccRCCs within and between mice 
responded differently to therapeutic regimes used to treat human metastatic ccRCC, suggests 
that this experimental system will be useful for the identification of molecular determinants 
of tumour sensitivities and resistances. Our observations of therapeutic effects of the HIF-1α 
and HIF-2α inhibitor Acriflavine on at least some tumours support recent findings that a 
new HIF-2α-specific inhibitor shows good therapeutic activity in various pre-clinical models 
towards approximately half of human ccRCC tumour-derived cell lines or tumourgrafts 
37,38. Finally, the availability of this and other autochthonous models of ccRCC will allow 
investigations of the role of the tumour microenvironment in tumour progression and 
therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of the ongoing optimisation of immune 
checkpoint-blocking therapies, which have already yielded good clinical responses in sub-
fractions of ccRCC patients 39.

 CreERT2;Vhlfl/fl;Rb1fl/fl, Ksp1.3-CreERT2;Trp53fl/fl;Rb1fl/fl and Ksp1.3-
CreERT2 Tg/+;Rb1fl/fl animals. Littermate mice that lacked the Cre transgene served as wild 
type controls. Gene deletion in 6 week-old mice was achieved by feeding with food 
containing tamoxifen (400 parts per million) for 2 weeks. For gene deletion in pups, nursing 
dams were injected intraperitoneally with tamoxifen (0.1 mg/g body weight) from days P2–
P4. Mouse crosses and phenotyping were conducted under the breeding license of the 
Laboratory Animal Services Center, University of Zurich and tumour monitoring studies 
were conducted under license ZH116/16 of the Canton of Zurich. Investigators were not 
blinded to the genotype of the mice.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were conducted using previously described 
methods 11 using the antibodies against the following antigens AQP1 (Abcam, ab15080), 
AQP2 (gift from Johannes Loffing, 43), CA9 (Invitrogen, PA1-16592), CD10 (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific PA5-47075), CD31 (Abcam, ab28364), pan-Cytokeratin (DAKO, M3515), 
HIF-1α (Novus Biotechnologies, NB-100-105), HIF-2α (PM8, gift from Patrick Pollard, 
44), NAPI2A (gift from Jürg Biber, 45), NCC (Millipore, AB3553), PAX8 (Protein Tech 
Group, 10336-1-AP), Phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling Technologies, 9101), 
Phospho-Thr37/46-4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, 2855), pRB (BD Biosciences, 
554136), THP (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, SC-20631), acetylated-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, 
T6793), vWF (Sigma, F3520).
Therapeutic studies and µCT imaging
Imaging of animals was performed as previously described 12. Mice were imaged monthly 
beginning 5 months after tamoxifen feeding and every week or every two weeks during 
therapeutic studies. Tumour volumes were determined from μCT images by measuring the 
maximum diameter of tumours in the x, y and z planes and using the formula for the volume 
of an ellipsoid (V = 4/3 x π x radiusx x radiusy x radiusz). As a first line therapy animals 
with tumours between 20-70 mm3 received 40 mg/kg Sunitinib (dissolved in 0.5% carboxy-
methyl-cellulose, 5% dextrose) every day via oral gavage. If tumours did not respond or 
developed resistance to Sunitinib, therapy was switched to daily 10 mg/kg Everolimus 
(dissolved in 5% PEG, 5% Tween80, 5% EtOH and 85% D5W) via oral gavage. As a third 
line therapy 2 mg/kg Acriflavine dissolved in PBS was injected intraperitoneally every day.
RNA sequencing
RNA isolated from 6 ccRCCs from VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice (2 tumours were from the 
same mouse) and from renal cortex samples from 3 non-transgenic Vhlfl/flTrp53fl/flRb1fl/fl 
littermate mice was subjected to RNA sequencing by Otogenetics Corporation (USA). 
Starting from the raw .fastq files (2x150bp) the reads were mapped against the mouse 
reference genome GRCm38 (with ENSEMBL annotation GRCm38.p4, release 84) using the 
STAR aligner (version 2.4.2a) 46. Standard quality control (Picard and RSeQC) 47 was run 
to assess the quality of the resulting alignments. Subsequently, strand-specific (reversely 
stranded) read counting was performed using featureCount (subread, version 1.5.0) 48 
yielding count tables for 47729 transcripts per sample. Between 1.9-3.8x107 mapped reads 
were obtained per sample. To avoid technical artifacts the data were filtered such that genes

 where the average over all samples was less than 5 counts were removed. This resulted in 
29111 transcripts removed out of 47729 in total, leaving 18618 transcripts for further 
analysis. Differential expression was modelled using generalized linear regression of the 
negative binomial family, as implemented in the R-package DESeq2 49. TCGA RNASeqV2 
mRNA data for human ccRCC and normal kidneys were downloaded using the 
TCGA2STAT package. Limma/voom 50 was used to identify differentially expressed genes 
in this data set. Comparisons were made using only mouse and human genes with one-to-
one orthology. Similarity to normal nephron segment expression profiles was assessed 
following the described procedure of Davis et al. 19. Briefly, the Pearson correlation 
coefficients between each mouse tumor sample and the nephron segment specific reference 
data sets were calculated over all common genes 23. Independently, competitive enrichment 
of nephron segment-specific gene sets was performed using Fisher’s exact test. The negative 
logarithmic p-value can serve as a similarity score and gave results analogous to the Pearson 
coefficient. Global similarities in gene expression between mouse and human ccRCC were 
determined using Pearson correlation analysis of the normalised log-transformed gene 
expression values for all unique orthologous gene pairs in human (RNA sequencing data 
from TCGA studies) and mouse (this study) ccRCCs.
Exome sequencing
Genomic DNA isolated from 7 ccRCCs from VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice (2 tumours were 
from the same mouse), from 6 normal liver samples from the tumour-bearing mice and from 
renal cortex samples from 3 wild type mice was subjected to exome sequencing by 
Otogenetics Corporation (USA) using Agilent's SureSelect Mouse All Exon V1 kit. The raw 
fastq files were mapped against the mouse reference (GRCm38/mm10) using bwa mem 
(http://github.com/lh3/bwa). Subsequently, Picard tools MarkDuplicates and GATK 
IndelRealigner 51 were used to improve the final alignments. Picard tools 
AlignmentSummaryMetrics and HsMetrics were used to perform quality control on the raw 
sequencing data and the alignments. Somatic SNVs were called for each tumor-normal 
combination using two tools: mutect and strelka. Small somatic InDels were called using 
strelka. Merging and filtering of variant calls was performed using GATK 51 and only 
variants with variant allele frequencies greater than 5% were included in the analyses. 
SnpEff 52, SnpSift 53 and BEDTools 54 were used for annotations. EXCAVATOR 55 was 
used to call copy number variations with 95% probability cut-off in tumours against the 
matched normal liver samples. Lists of copy number variants were manually filtered to 
remove calls in which multiple tumours showed the exact start and end points of the gain or 
loss, as these are highly likely to represent artefacts of the calling algorithm. Result files 
were annotated with mouse and human genes using BEDTools 54. We used the non-mouse 
refgenes track (xenoRefGene) from the UCSC Genome Browser 56 (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/) to map human genes to the mouse genome. Gene set enrichment analysis 
was conducted using the online GSEA software (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/
index.jsp).
Survival analyses
Human ccRCC Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted using the online tools of the 
cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org).

 Statistics
All sample size (n) values used for statistical analyses are provided in the relevant figures 
and supplementary figures. Differences in tumour onset between different mouse genotypes 
and sexes were assessed using the Log-rank Mantel-Cox test and differences in tumour 
numbers between mice were assessed using Student’s one-tailed unpaired t-test. Pearson 
correlation analyses were used to compare global mouse and human ccRCC mRNA 
expression as well as to compare mouse ccRCC mRNA expression with nephron segment-
specific mRNA expression profiles.

 Figure 3. ccRCCs in VhlΔ/ΔTrp53Δ/ΔRb1Δ/Δ mice exhibit global transcriptional similarities to 
human ccRCCs
(a) Volcano plot showing statistically significantly (false discovery rate < 0.01, horizontal 
line) and differentially regulated genes (> 2-fold up- or down-regulated, vertical lines) 
between 6 mouse ccRCCs and 3 normal kidney cortex samples. (b) Venn diagram showing 
overlap of the human orthologues of the set of mouse differentially expressed genes with the 
set of differentially expressed genes derived from analysis of human normal kidney (n=72) 
and ccRCC (n=533) samples using the same criteria as for the analyses in a. (c) Sample-

 averaged, normalised and log-transformed gene expression values for all unique orthologous 
gene pairs in human and mouse ccRCC (black dots). The red line represents a perfect 
correlation and the blue line results from a smooth parametric regression with confidence 
band in grey. Pearson coefficient [0.65;0.67] (P < 1 x 10-16), 95% confidence interval. (d-f) 
Mouse ccRCCs show upregulation of mRNA expression of (d) HIF-1α and HIF-2α target 
genes, (e) genes that regulate cell cycle progression, DNA replication and mitosis and (f) 
genes involved in immune responses. (g) Normalised Pearson correlation scores depicting 
global mRNA expression similarities between mouse ccRCCs and normal nephron 
segments; Glom = glomeruli, S1/S3 = proximal tubule S1 and S3 segments, mTAL/cTAL = 
medullary and cortical thick ascending limbs of Henle’s loop, DCT = distal convoluted 
tubules, CCD/OMCD = cortical and outer medullary collecting ducts.

 Figure 5. Exome sequencing reveals that mouse and human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent mutations 
of primary cilia-associated genes
(a) Distributions of nucleotide transitions and transversions in mouse ccRCCs. (b) Numbers 
of non-synonymous mutations caused by single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or insertions 
and deletions (InDels) in mouse ccRCCs. (c) Recurrent alterations in primary cilium-
associated genes in mouse ccRCCs. Variant allele frequencies of each mutation are shown. 
(d) Examples of anti-acetylated tubulin staining to label primary cilia in normal kidney 
tissue and mouse ccRCCs. The frequency of tumours (n=59) showing these observed 
patterns is indicated. All panels are the same magnification, scale bar = 50 μm.
