Background: Improved antibiotic stewardship (AS) and reduced prescribing in primary care, with a parallel in-
crease in personal internet use, could lead citizens to obtain antibiotics from alternative sources online.
Objectives: A cross-sectional analysis was performed to: (i) determine the quality and legality of online pharma-
cies selling antibiotics to the UK public; (ii) describe processes for obtaining antibiotics online from within the UK;
and (iii) identify resulting AS and patient safety issues.
Methods: Searches were conducted for ‘buy antibiotics online’ using Google and Yahoo. For each search engine,
data from the first 10 web sites with unique URL addresses were reviewed. Analysis was conducted on evidence
of appropriate pharmacy registration, prescription requirement, whether antibiotic choice was ‘prescriber-driven’
or ‘consumer-driven’, and whether specific information was required (allergies, comorbidities, pregnancy) or
given (adverse effects) prior to purchase.
Results: Twenty unique URL addresses were analysed in detail. Online pharmacies evidencing their location in
the UK (n " 5; 25%) required a prescription before antibiotic purchase, and were appropriately registered. Online
pharmacies unclear about the location they were operating from (n " 10; 50%) had variable prescription require-
ments, and no evidence of appropriate registration. Nine (45%) online pharmacies did not require a prescription
prior to purchase. For 16 (80%) online pharmacies, decisions were initially consumer-driven for antibiotic choice,
dose and quantity.
Conclusions: Wide variation exists among online pharmacies in relation to antibiotic practices, highlighting con-
siderable patient safety and AS issues. Improved education, legislation, regulation and new best practice stew-
ardship guidelines are urgently needed for online antibiotic suppliers.
Introduction
Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is recognized as the organiza-
tional or healthcare-system-wide approach to promoting and
monitoring the judicious use of antimicrobials,1 such as antibiotics.
Co-ordinated interventions within antibiotic stewardship (AS) pro-
grammes are designed to achieve optimal clinical outcomes whilst
minimizing adverse events and antibiotic resistance.2 AS is a key
priority within the UK3 and globally,4 as antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) poses a profound threat to health security, healthcare qual-
ity and patient safety. The WHO global action plan for tackling AMR
has specific objectives for international AS. These objectives
include strengthening international regulations on the distribution,
quality and use of antibiotics, with emphasis placed on those ob-
tained through internet sales.4 Within the UK National Health
Service (NHS), local antibiotic guidelines, a variety of hospital-
based restrictive and persuasive interventions,5 community-based
social norm feedback6 and national stewardship guidelines1,7 en-
courage judicious antibiotic prescribing. However, antibiotics may
be acquired in much of the world without a prescription, despite
this being illegal in many of the countries concerned.8–15 Within
the UK, patient safety and current AS strategies may be threat-
ened due to antibiotics being available to purchase online, without

 a prescription, from a variety of vendors globally.16 In 2013 a
European survey reported that the use of the internet to resolve
healthcare needs within the UK was modest.17 However, it is ex-
pected that the use of the internet within the UK for both con-
sumer and healthcare needs will continue to rise based on the
current trajectory.
Prescribing by healthcare professionals, all practices conducted
within registered pharmacies and any advertisements for medi-
cinal products are closely monitored and regulated within the UK.
The General Medical Council (GMC) advises on remote and elec-
tronic prescribing decisions,18 and dentists, nurses, pharmacists,
optometrists and midwives, who may also issue antibiotic prescrip-
tions, have similar regulatory bodies. In Great Britain (GB), the
General
Pharmaceutical
Council
(GPhC)
registers
practising
pharmacists as well as pharmacy premises and online pharmacies.
Guidance for providing services online is also distributed by the
Royal
Pharmaceutical
Society
(RPS)
in
GB19
and
by
the
Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland (PSNI). The UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
also provides registration for online pharmacies, investigates web
sites that are suspected of operating illegally and considers adver-
tisements for prescription-only medicines (POMs), which are ac-
ceptable only on web sites whose content is directed at healthcare
professionals.20 Formal MHRA registration for all online vendors
selling medicines to UK consumers was mandated in 2015, with
every web page legally required to display the EU common logo
containing a hyperlink directing users to a list of registered online
pharmacies.21 In contrast to the EU common logo, the GPhC logo
is a voluntary scheme applicable only to pharmacies registered in
GB.22
Currently, patients may obtain antibiotics online through legal
registered pharmacy platforms, or through illegal web sites, which
expose them to a variety of potential risks. These risks may include:
no verbal or physical review prior to antibiotic supply; inappropriate
choice, dose or duration; poor-quality medication; pressured anti-
biotic advertising; or payment information fraud. In November
2015 the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, commissioned by
the UK government, highlighted the risks of online antibiotic sales
and emphasized the need for a safe, secure and controlled antibi-
otic supply chain.23 However, the extent of the associated prob-
lems is largely unknown.23
We report here an exploratory cross-sectional analysis of a rep-
resentative sample of online pharmacies with the overarching ob-
jective being to improve understanding of the current state of
online antibiotic sales in the UK. The specific aims of this cross-
sectional analysis were: (i) to assess the quality and legality of on-
line pharmacies identified (using registration status as a proxy
indicator for quality and legality); (ii) to analyse the processes
(whether prescriber-driven or consumer-driven) for purchasing an
antibiotic online; and (iii) to identify any resulting AS or patient
safety issues.
Methods
A multidisciplinary working group (A. H. H., S. E. B., M. G., L. S. P. M., C. C.),
which included both healthcare professionals and academics with expert-
ise in AS, agreed a study protocol and data collection tool by Delphi consen-
sus. One researcher (S. E. B.) completed data collection based on the
pre-agreed protocol using a computer for which the cached search history
was cleared prior to the study.
Choice of search engine
The popularity of specific internet search engines will vary depending on
the preference and geographical location of searchers. Google and Yahoo,
widely recognized as two of the most popular search engines in the world,
play a major role in how people address medical needs24 and were both
used to reduce bias in the way that individual search engines may retrieve
and rank results.25 Owing to varying degrees of overlap in the way these
search engines present results,26 web sites that were duplicated were only
included once. The Google search was completed first.
Choice of search term
Simple queries and keyword searches dominate when purchasing products
online with searchers viewing fewer result pages.27 Consumer time-
pressure and cognitive-resource limitations have been hypothesized to ac-
count for this.28 Search engine queries were therefore conducted with the
search term ‘buy antibiotics online.’
Choice of sample size
In their default setting the search engines selected typically respond to
queries with a ranked list of 10 web sites on the first page, with searchers
being heavily influenced by the order in which they are presented.29 The
first position in an internet search contributes to more traffic than the se-
cond and subsequent positions,29,30 with products or web sites at the top of
a list being more likely to become part of a consumer’s consideration set.31
The first page of a Google search generates �92% of traffic from an aver-
age search; traffic drops by 95% when moving from the first to second
page and by 78% and 58% for subsequent pages.30 When presented with
options, consumers typically undergo a two-stage process by screening
products or web sites, and subsequently reviewing a more relevant subset
in detail before making a purchase decision.32 A sample size of 20, to in-
clude the first 10 unique web pages identified from each search engine that
met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, was subsequently pre-determined.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Web sites were included if they were English-language vendors selling anti-
biotics online, for human use, to consumers within the UK. Web sites were
excluded if they were advertisement links, primarily for veterinary medicine,
did not ship to the UK, or were inactive when attempts were made to pro-
ceed to checkout. In some cases different uniform resource locator (URL)
addresses were linked to a common stem vendor (CSV) selling antibiotics.
Each CSV was included only once. The first 10 web sites from each search
engine with a unique URL address, that fitted the criteria specified, were
analysed in detail. Data were collected to meet the objectives, and the pro-
cess for purchasing an antibiotic was followed until the point of payment.
Purchasing an antibiotic was defined as a payment transaction.
The first objective was to assess the quality and legality of online phar-
macies identified. Registration with the MHRA, evidenced by the presence
of the mandatory EU common logo, was used as a proxy indicator of the
quality and legality of the pharmacy. Evidence of accreditation and regis-
tration with the GPhC (or PSNI) was also recorded. All web sites displaying
accreditation logos were cross-referenced with the relevant online register
(MHRA and GPhC/PSNI) to ensure the validity of the logo displayed. Each
web site was further studied to identify the location from where it was
operating.
The second objective was to analyse the processes for purchasing an
antibiotic online. Data were collected on prescription requirements and
whether information for safe prescribing (allergies, comorbidities, preg-
nancy) was required prior to the purchase of an antibiotic. Web sites were

 thoroughly reviewed to identify statements on prescription requirements.
All web pages specifying the sale of antibiotics were analysed in detail and
the process for obtaining an antibiotic was followed up to the point of input-
ting payment information for each web site. In addition, the term ‘prescrip-
tion’ was searched for and the ‘frequently asked questions’ section, or
equivalent, was reviewed in detail for each online pharmacy included.
Initial decisions regarding the choice of antibiotic were defined as being
‘prescriber-driven’ or ‘consumer-driven’. A prescriber-driven process was
when the consumer was first directed through an online consultation after
clicking on a specific ailment, and if appropriate, a prescription for an antibi-
otic was subsequently selected by the prescriber. A consumer-driven pro-
cess was when the consumer initiated the antibiotic purchase by first
selecting an antibiotic of their choice for placement in their ‘shopping bas-
ket’. Data were also collected on whether any safety information on ad-
verse effects was provided to patients during the online process, whether
oral or intravenous (iv) antibiotics were available for purchase, the standard
delivery time to the UK, and whether an express delivery option was avail-
able. Each web site was explored in detail and data were collected on the
name of all antibiotics that appeared available for purchase online.
The third objective was to identify any resulting AS and patient safety
issues; this was met through integration of the above findings.
After completion of data collection, all vendors identified as illegally sell-
ing antibiotics to patients within the UK were reported to the MHRA. Ethics
approval was not required for this study of open-source data.
Results
Results of the searches performed on 28 February 2016 are shown
in Figure 1. Twenty-eight web sites were screened. Of the web sites
analysed in detail (n " 20), five (25%) showed evidence of
operating from within GB. All five displayed appropriate evidence
of registration with both the MHRA and the GPhC. Table 1 shows
the locations and registration status of the 15 other web sites
analysed.
Figure 2 summarizes the prescription requirements and differ-
ent processes for providing a prescription to the vendor prior to on-
line purchase. All five GB-based online pharmacies required
a prescription before an antibiotic would be delivered. For 16 (80%)
web sites, decisions regarding antibiotic choice, dose and duration
were initially consumer driven, with only 4 (20%) online pharma-
cies utilizing a prescriber-driven pathway (Table 2). All four of these

 were based in GB and registered with both the MHRA and GPhC.
A further GB-based pharmacy, registered with both the MHRA and
GPhC, permitted a consumer-driven process prior to the point of
payment, through which consumers were directed to an antibiotic
choice depending on the syndrome they clicked on the web page.
However, despite initially adopting a consumer-driven approach,
this pharmacy described a pathway whereby a health question-
naire would be made available after payment was received to
allow a doctor to assess an individual’s suitability for an antibiotic.
Six web sites (30%) did not issue online prescriptions and instead
required that a prescription be faxed or posted before an antibiotic
would be delivered. One of these web sites did not specify the loca-
tion from where they were operating and it was not clear whether
an address would have been provided to allow a consumer to post
the prescription after a payment transaction. Figure 3 correlates
the requirement for prescription through each individual online
pharmacy with the information that was requested, prior to antibi-
otic purchase. All pharmacies offered oral antibiotics; one non-EU
based web site also advertised iv antibiotics for sale. The cumula-
tive frequency of all types of antibiotic available from the 20
pharmacies is presented in Table 3. Standard delivery time to
the UK varied from 1 to 14 days (mean 10.5, median 14, IQR
6.75–14 days). Thirteen web sites (65%) had a standard delivery
time of 14 days. An express option was available on request for all
20 web sites.
Discussion
This study raises several important issues regarding AS and patient
safety with online pharmacies. Concerning heterogeneity was
observed in the legality and quality of online pharmacies, the proc-
esses for obtaining an antibiotic, and in other safety procedures
prior to the point of payment.
Assessing the quality and legality of online pharmacies
A similar study, carried out by Mainous et al.16 in the USA, found
that 36.2% of 138 online pharmacies sold antibiotics without pre-
scription, a figure slightly below the 45% identified in our sample.
The relative paucity of published literature around selling antibi-
otics via the internet contrasts with numerous studies relating to
other classes of medication. A systematic review published in 2011
assessed 193 relevant studies and aimed to determine the charac-
teristics and quality of online pharmacies.33 The authors reported
a wide variety of prescription-only medicines available with incon-
sistent prescription requirements and that the presence of at least
one quality certification ranged from between 12% and 28% de-
pending on the study in question.33 Among the 20 online

 pharmacies analysed in the present study, those that were operat-
ing from within the UK (25%) evidenced registration with both the
MHRA and the GPhC. Confirming the registration status was facili-
tated by a user-friendly hyperlink, enabling potential consumers to
check the legitimacy of a web site. However, this mechanism to re-
assure the public on quality and safety relies on consumers under-
standing what the logos represent. A concerning number of
pharmacies within our sample (75%) lacked evidence of the regis-
tration that is required by current UK and European legislation. This
may be because some of the identified pharmacies were operating
outside of Europe, with three based in India. There was no informa-
tion provided on where 10 (50%) of the pharmacies were operat-
ing from. Regardless of where they are based, vendors providing
antibiotics to patients within the UK are subject to UK legislation.
While non-prescription antibiotics are recognized as an important
means for access in resource-poor settings,34 this is unlikely to be a
concern within the UK, where healthcare is free at the point of
need. This study raises concerns on the effectiveness of current le-
gislation, licensing and regulation for platforms selling antibiotics
via the internet to UK consumers.
The processes for obtaining antibiotics online from
within the UK
We have identified a variety of processes for obtaining antibiotics
online, including heterogeneity in the safety assessments made to
determine whether antibiotics were required, and if so, the most
appropriate and safe antibiotic choice, dose and duration. Overall,
16 (80%) of the pharmacies reviewed required that consumers dir-
ectly select an antibiotic before proceeding to checkout. Health
questionnaires were utilized in only six (30%) online pharmacies.
These lacked consistency and often came subsequent to a
consumer-driven choice on requirement and type of antibiotic.
A systematic review of online pharmacies reported use of an online
questionnaire during the purchasing process to be between 10%
and 81%, depending on the study in question.33 We observed vari-
ation in the information sought via health questionnaires, and the
methods used to collect this information. Some questionnaires
comprised drop-down boxes, some free-text boxes and others a
mixture of both. Additionally, it was not clear whether there would
be feedback from the prescriber/dispenser if a mismatch was sub-
sequently identified between the consumer-selected choice and
the most appropriate course of action, taking into account the in-
formation in the questionnaire.
Opinion is mixed regarding whether antibiotics should be avail-
able without prescription.35,36 However, in line with current UK
legal requirements37 and National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidance for AS,1 decision processes should be
shared and crucially underpinned by prescriber-driven rationale. In
addition, a uniform, consistent and thorough health questionnaire
should be mandatory. This tool should be developed through col-
laboration with key UK stakeholders to ensure that online patient
safety and antibiotic stewardship are consistent with national best
practice. Key stakeholders may include representatives from PHE,
the GMC, GPhC, RPS, PSNI, MHRA, Royal College of General
Practitioners, NICE, the Department of Health Advisory Committee
for Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infection,
patient representatives and the public.
We identified a median delivery time of 14 days, representing a
potential risk to patients acquiring antibiotics to treat an acute in-
fection. Mainous et al.16 also analysed shipping times for antibiotic
delivery. These authors suggested, based on similar results to our
findings, that the prolonged ‘interval between ordering and receiv-
ing the medication suggest that these transactions will likely be
used by individuals storing the drugs for future self-diagnosis and
treatment or for sale’.
Consumers accessing health web sites have relatively high
levels of digital health literacy,17 but there remains a need for a for-
mal assessment of web sites to ensure uniform standards for user-
friendly platforms and readability, and for important health
messages to be conveyed. If antibiotics are to be sold online, ad-
vice to see a healthcare provider promptly if an adverse reaction
occurs or if presenting symptoms do not improve must be at the
forefront of the antibiotic purchasing process.

 other healthcare settings, this practice is not congruent with cur-
rent MHRA regulations.20 The prevalence of antibiotic advertising
was not a primary outcome measure in this study, but is raised as
a concern on both ethical and safety grounds. Given the significant
volume of funding and effort to develop effective strategies for
antibiotic stewardship in the UK, further research should be con-
ducted to determine the frequency with which this advertising
occurs, the effect it has on patients’ expectation for antibiotics, and
subsequent antibiotic-seeking behaviours. Recognition that in-
appropriate antibiotic prescribing is correlated with public expect-
ation has been the focus of several educational campaigns led by
the UK Department of Health and PHE.7,38 Technical solutions that
prevent advertisement links should be implemented, with consid-
eration of financial penalties for web sites who are in breach of
MHRA regulations or who are supplying antibiotics outwithnational
stewardship guidelines, which are ‘Start Smart Then Focus’,
‘TARGET’ and the NICE Antimicrobial Stewardship guideline, within
England.1,39,40 Responsibility also exists for individual prescribers to
ensure they conform to nationally accepted best practice recom-
mendations for antimicrobial stewardship, given the emphasis
placed on this in recent NICE guidance.1
This research raises a question on the potential unintended con-
sequences of stewardship initiatives that improve and reduce anti-
biotic prescribing through traditional routes.5 If the risks of
inappropriate antibiotic use are not conveyed to patients there is
concern that, as consumers, they may seek to obtain antibiotics
from an alternative source. At present there is no way to estimate
the acquisition of antibiotics through legal or illegal online pharma-
cies. Education and public awareness campaigns should encourage
prescribers to identify patients’ ideas, concerns and expectations,
whilst fully explaining why they do not need an antibiotic. Although
the gains of this strategy have been modest to date, the prospect
that a patient may seek to obtain an antibiotic from an alternative
source, such as online, reinforces its importance. Practitioners
should seek to address the issues surrounding obtaining medicines
online with those felt most likely to engage in this behaviour, al-
though further research is urgently required to understand who
they may be. It seems likely that they represent a group that is
hard to reach through traditional healthcare, given their preference
to seek healthcare through non-traditional routes. A snowball ap-
proach that actively seeks to engage online healthcare commun-
ities may prove useful to identify these consumers. Facilitated
small group or one-to-one sessions using formal qualitative behav-
ioural research methods, aiming to understand how to engage
their desire for self-management in a safe manner, is required. In
addition to these strategies, the issues surrounding obtaining a var-
iety of medicines online, including antibiotics, should be integrated
into the curricula for all prescribers in order to raise awareness.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first analysis looking specifically at issues pertaining to
the availability of antibiotics online to patients within the UK. Web
sites were identified using a method felt to be widely representa-
tive of how consumers search for and buy products online. By
using two popular search engines we identified a broad range of
relevant web sites.
This study had limitations inherent to the constantly evolving
online consumer domain. A Google or Yahoo search is not

 identical when different browsers are used for the same search, or
when the same search is performed at different times. Different
consumers may be faced with different purchasing options.
However, it is widely accepted that the most popular sites will be
placed higher on the result list for all searchers. Illegal vendors
may also masquerade, and change their domain name frequently
in order to remain operational. There is a possibility that if this
occurred, the same vendor may have been included twice, al-
though this is unlikely given the cross-sectional nature of the study.
In addition, one researcher analysed all web sites and would have
most likely noticed any striking similarities among them.
When antibiotics are dispensed in person, an opportunity to en-
sure patient safety exists when handing over a prescription.
Actually purchasing antibiotics was beyond the scope of our ana-
lysis, and in not proceeding to payment we may have missed any
patient safety prompts that occur only after a monetary transac-
tion. Statements on web sites were sought to determine whether
antibiotic prescriptions were required. However, by not proceeding
through a payment transaction we cannot be certain whether
web sites that made no statement on prescription requirement
would subsequently refuse to process an order without a valid pre-
scription, or whether web sites that had statements on prescrip-
tion requirement would subsequently dispense antibiotics without
a valid prescription. We did not explore whether or not information
was sought on concomitant medications that may affect antibi-
otic suitability; collecting this additional data would be a valuable
focus for future research.
Finally, the URL pages we identified may no longer be oper-
ational. All vendors identified as illegally selling antibiotics to pa-
tients within the UK were reported directly to the MHRA,41 who
promptly responded by e-mail stating that all concerns had been
passed to the Enforcement Team.
Conclusions
The way patients interact with healthcare is constantly evolving
and shifts in consumer behaviour over the past decade mean
increasing numbers are now opting to purchase products online.
The availability of antibiotics online, or products being sold as such,
poses a serious threat to patient safety and national antibiotic
stewardship initiatives.
We make several key recommendations for stakeholders in the
UK. GMC and RPS guidance for prescribers should be updated to re-
flect changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour, the increasing de-
mand for remote and online prescribing, and the importance of
antibiotic stewardship in this environment. Display of the GPhC/
PSNI logo should be made mandatory in line with the EU common
logo. A best practice toolkit based on current NICE guidelines for
antibiotic stewardship with a standardized health questionnaire
developed by key stakeholders is recommended if the sale of anti-
biotics online is to continue in the UK. Emphasis should be placed
on prescriber responsibility for follow-up to ensure infective symp-
toms improve and to monitor antibiotic-associated adverse events
in line with current NICE guidance. We also evidence the urgent
need to improve the surveillance of online antibiotic sales.
Antibiotic distribution through online channels should be manda-
tory to report, in line with antibiotic consumption data for the UK
NHS. Engaging collaboration between international policy makers,
governmental
law
enforcement
agencies,
pharmaceutical
companies, individual prescribers and consumers will be a priority.
In order to promote patient safety and preserve antibiotic therapy,
an efficient and operational multidisciplinary taskforce is needed
to address the issues we have identified.
