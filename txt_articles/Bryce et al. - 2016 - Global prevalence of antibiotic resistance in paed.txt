Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary 
tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with 
routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review 
and meta-analysis
Ashley Bryce,1 Alastair D Hay,1 Isabel F Lane,1 Hannah V Thornton,1 Mandy Wootton,2 Céire Costelloe3 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To systematically review studies investigating the 
prevalence of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract 
infections caused by Escherichia coli in children and, 
when appropriate, to meta-analyse the relation 
between previous antibiotics prescribed in primary 
care and resistance.
Design anD Data analysis
Systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled 
percentage prevalence of resistance to the most 
commonly used antibiotics in children in primary care, 
stratified by the OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) status of the study 
country. Random effects meta-analysis was used to 
quantify the association between previous exposure to 
antibiotics in primary care and resistance.
Data sOurCes
Observational and experimental studies identified 
through Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ISI Web of 
Knowledge databases, searched for articles published 
up to October 2015.
eligibility Criteria fOr seleCting stuDies
Studies were eligible if they investigated and reported 
resistance in community acquired urinary tract 
infection in children and young people aged 0-17. 
Electronic searches with MeSH terms and text words 
identified 3115 papers. Two independent reviewers 
assessed study quality and performed data extraction.
results
58 observational studies investigated 77 783 E coli 
isolates in urine. In studies from OECD countries, 
the pooled prevalence of resistance was 53.4% 
(95% confidence interval 46.0% to 60.8%) for 
ampicillin, 23.6% (13.9% to 32.3%) for trimethoprim, 
8.2% (7
.9% to 9.6%) for co-amoxiclav, and 2.1% (0.8 to 
4.4%) for ciprofloxacin; nitrofurantoin was the lowest at 
1.3% (0.8% to 1.7%). Resistance in studies in countries 
outside the OECD was significantly higher: 79.8% 
(73.0% to 87
.7%) for ampicillin, 60.3% (40.9% to 79.0%) 
for co-amoxiclav, 26.8% (11.1% to 43.0%) for 
ciprofloxacin, and 17
.0% (9.8% to 24.2%) for 
nitrofurantoin. There was evidence that bacterial isolates 
from the urinary tract from individual children who had 
received previous prescriptions for antibiotics in primary 
care were more likely to be resistant to antibiotics, and 
this increased risk could persist for up to six months 
(odds ratio 13.23, 95% confidence interval 7
.84 to 22.31).
COnClusiOns
Prevalence of resistance to commonly prescribed 
antibiotics in primary care in children with urinary tract 
infections caused by E coli is high, particularly in 
countries outside the OECD, where one possible 
explanation is the availability of antibiotics over the 
counter. This could render some antibiotics ineffective 
as first line treatments for urinary tract infection. 
Routine use of antibiotics in primary care contributes 
to antimicrobial resistance in children, which can 
persist for up to six months after treatment.
Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised 
threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare 
is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of 
all antibiotics used within the health service are pre-
scribed.1  Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can 
limit the availability of effective treatment options, ren-
dering some commonly encountered bacterial infections 
difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. 
Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to 
be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and 
are associated with increased healthcare costs.2  In low 
income countries, affordability of second line drugs and 
reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer 
broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing con-
cerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibi-
otic resistant infections in these countries.3
Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services 
and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number 
of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations.4 
 
Children are also key drivers of infection within commu-
nities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from 
person to person. Despite this, little research has been 
published describing the prevalence of bacterial

resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in 
this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted 
a systematic review that reported strong associations 
between previous exposure to routinely prescribed anti-
biotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance per-
sisting for up to 12 months.5 Most of the contributing 
studies, however, were conducted in adults.
Urinary tract infections are one of the most common 
bacterial infections seen in primary care.6  In children 
with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most com-
mon management strategy is to treat empirically with an 
antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing 
are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to 
immediate and long term complications, including renal 
scarring and renal failure,7 and therefore require prompt 
appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for 
over 80% of all urinary tract infections8  and is also the 
most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne 
infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates.9
We conducted a systematic review to investigate the 
prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli 
urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed 
antibiotics given to children in primary care and to 
quantify the relation between previous exposure to 
antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We 
stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) status of the study 
countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in 
these groups. In the more developed OECD countries 
antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, 
whereas in “developing” non-OECD countries many 
antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat uri-
nary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, 
without the need for a prescription.10-14
Methods
search strategy and selection criteria
We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for articles 
published in any language between 1955 and October 2015. 
MeSH terms for these databases included “drug resis-
tance”, “antimicrobial resistance”, “bacterial resistance”, 
“primary health care”, “urinary tract infections”, and 
“children”. MeSH terms were combined with text word 
searches that included “antibiotic(s)”, “primary care”, 
“family practice”, “ambulatory care”, “community”, 
“UTI”, and “urinary bacteria”. Grey and unpublished liter-
ature was searched for with ISI Web of Knowledge soft-
ware and included journal articles, patents, websites, 
conference proceedings, government and national 
reports, and open access material. We screened reference 
lists of selected key papers and contacted authors who 
appeared multiple times to request details of further pub-
lished and unpublished work. All full text papers were 
subject to citation searches. Appendix 1 details the full 
search strategy. Our review protocol was published on 
PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/).
Two independent reviewers (AB and HT) screened all 
titles and abstracts independently for eligibility. Studies 
were eligible for inclusion if they met the following crite-
ria: investigated and reported patterns of resistance in 
laboratory diagnosed E coli positive isolates from 
 
children with urinary tract infection from primary care, 
defined as the first point of contact in the healthcare sys-
tem; or investigated associations between previous anti-
biotic exposure and bacterial resistance; and study 
participants were children and young people aged 0-17 
presenting with symptoms of urinary tract infection who 
had provided a urine sample. We included hospital 
based studies when it was clear that the investigation 
was for community acquired urinary tract infection, 
defined as a laboratory diagnosed infection from urine 
samples taken within 48 hours of admission.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Full text papers for all eligible studies were obtained, 
and three reviewers (AB, CC, and IL) extracted data inde-
pendently using a purpose built spreadsheet. The fol-
lowing information was extracted from each paper, 
when provided: author, journal, year of publication, 
study design, study country, economic status, partici-
pants and recruitment location, recruitment time 
period, age range, method of urine sample collection 
and testing, method of antimicrobial sensitivity testing, 
bacteria cultured and reported antibiotic sensitivities, 
previously prescribed antibiotics, and time between 
antibiotic exposure and urine sample collection. Level 
of development was measured with the OECD status of 
the country in which the study was conducted.15  The 
OECD is an international economic organisation first 
established in 1948, now made up of 34 countries, which 
aims to work together and with emerging and develop-
ing economies to reduce poverty through economic 
growth and financial stability.15 Member countries tend 
to be “developed” countries, whereas non-member 
countries tend to be “developing.” We used OECD status 
as a general measure of country level development and 
primary care infrastructure and a proxy marker for use 
of over-the-counter antibiotics. For antimicrobial expo-
sure, time was generally recorded as a period of days, 
weeks, or months before the urine sample was taken 
and resistance was measured with standard local labo-
ratory methods. When any information was unclear in 
the paper, we contacted authors for clarification.
We extracted and reported resistance to antibiotics 
commonly prescribed and reported for urinary tract infec-
tion in children in primary care: ampicillin, co-amoxiclav 
(amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), co-trimoxazole (trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, 
ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (as a marker for cephalo-
sporin resistance). Ampicillin was reported in place of 
amoxicillin because of more frequent reporting and its 
equivalence in spectrum of antimicrobial activity.16
We used the Cochrane collaboration’s risk of bias tool 
to assess papers for quality.17 Selection bias was assessed 
with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) 
checklist for cohort and case-control studies (www.
casp-uk.net). We produced quality assessment charts 
based on a traffic light system of “good,” “adequate,” 
and “poor” reporting (see appendix 2), as recommended 
by Cochrane.17 Our key quality criteria for eligible studies 
were a reliable measure of antibiotic resistance; clear

people aged up to 17; and clear reporting of urinary bac-
teria isolated as community acquired. The same key 
quality indicators applied for papers that included infor-
mation on previous antibiotic exposure, with the addi-
tion of adjustment for confounders including age, sex, 
previous admission to hospital, and comorbidities.
Data synthesis and analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted with Stata ver-
sion 13 software, and all methods undertaken according 
to PRISMA guidelines.18
We calculated estimates of pooled prevalence of 
resistance by generating a forest plot for each antibi-
otic, stratified by OECD status. Forest plots illustrated 
the proportion of resistant E coli for each country, along 
with 95% confidence intervals, and the pooled preva-
lence of resistance per antibiotic per economic country 
group (OECD v non-OECD). We calculated pooled esti-
mates for each country and for OECD and non-OECD 
groups using the pooled country estimates. Pooled 
prevalence estimates were generated for children/
young people of all age groups (ages 0-17) and children 
aged 0-5, for comparison. When we could identify the 
first line antibiotics, these were indicated in the forest 
plot. I2 of 25%, 50%, and 75% were used to signify low 
level, moderate level, and high level heterogeneity, in 
line with Cochrane recommendations.17  All pooled esti-
mates and 95% confidence intervals were generated 
with double arcsine transformation to adjust for vari-
ance instability. This avoids implausible 95% confi-
dence intervals for prevalence estimates when 
generated under the normal approximation.19
For studies investigating the association between pre-
vious antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance, the 
outcome measure was the odds ratio of bacterial resis-
tance in children previously exposed to antibiotics com-
pared with those children previously unexposed. The 
crude estimates from these studies were grouped 
according to the reported preceding exposure time 
period (0-1 month, 0-3 months, and 0-6 months). One 
study investigated exposure at discrete time intervals up 
to 12 months or more before urine sampling and was 
reported separately. We carried out a random effects 
meta-analysis and generated a pooled odds ratio for 
each exposure time period measured. These were com-
pared with adjusted odds ratios for each time period, 
when reported. We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 
statistic. Meta-regression was used to investigate differ-
ences in the odds ratios between antibiotic exposure 
and resistance across different time periods. Finally, we 
generated funnel plots to explore the possibility of small 
study effects, which can be caused by publication bias.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
review. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
study characteristics
We identified 4246 articles through database searches. 
Of these, we assessed 3115 non-duplicated papers and 
excluded 2491 on basis of title (fig 1). The 624 remaining 
papers were assessed by abstract screening; 540 did not 
meet our eligibility criteria. We obtained and assessed 
84 full text papers, with 26 papers not meeting our eligi-
bility criteria for the following reasons: 12 had no 
 
primary care data, 11 did not report antibiotic suscepti-
bilities for E coli urinary tract infection bacteria, two 
studies were in adults, and one paper reported dupli-
cate data from another included paper. We therefore 
included 58 papers in our review,8 20-76 of which five 
papers (all from OECD countries) reported information 
on previous antibiotic exposure and were included in 
our  
meta-analysis. No grey literature or national reports 
were eligible for inclusion in the review.
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the 58 
included studies (full details are in appendix 3). Thirty 
three studies from OECD countries reported resistance 
in 73 375 E coli isolates from the same number of 
 
children, with the exception of one UK study that 
included multiple urine isolates per child. As data 
reported in the UK study were analysed with a two level 
model of samples nested within patients, we reported it 
separately in our meta-analysis.24 All studies were 
observational; 25 were retrospective, six prospective, 
and two case-control. Thirty reported information on 
prevalence of resistance in E coli urinary tract infection 
isolates, with the three remaining reporting the

51 Table 1 also summarises the 25 
studies included from non-OECD studies that reported 
bacterial resistance in 4408 E coli isolates from the 
same number of children. All were observational; 10 
were retrospective, 11 prospective, one case-control, 
and three cross sectional. All 25 non-OECD studies 
reported information on prevalence of resistance in uri-
nary E coli. No non-OECD studies reported information 
on previous antibiotic exposure. Figure 2 shows the 
number of studies per country included in the review. 
Most studies were conducted in OECD countries, and 
there were relatively few studies from each country.
Thirty one (20 OECD v 11 non-OECD) studies used 
mixed methods for urine collection, including clean 
catch, catheter, or suprapubic aspiration, with the 
remaining studies using a single method. There were no 
differences in rates of resistance detected between the 
different methods of urine sampling that studies used. 
Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was carried out with 
standard disk diffusion methods in 44 studies, with one 
interpreted and reported according to British Standard

78 and 14 not reported. There were no differences 
in resistance between studies that did and did not 
report the use of antimicrobial sensitivity guidelines. 
All children had presented to primary care facilities 
(18 studies), outpatient clinics (19 studies), or emer-
gency departments (eight studies) with symptoms of a 
urinary tract infection, with some children sent to a sec-
ondary or tertiary care hospital for urine tests on admis-
sion (12 studies). Of the 12 inpatient studies, nine stated 
that they included only community acquired E coli iso-
lates; the three remaining confirmed urine samples 
were collected within 48 hours of admission.
The quality assessment “traffic light” charts for the 
included studies showed that, for the five studies 
reporting information on antibiotic exposure, reporting 
was generally good for our all our key quality indicators 
(appendix 2). For studies reporting prevalence of resis-
tance only, overall quality was good with the exception 
of adjustment for confounding.
Prevalence of resistance in urinary E coli
Table 2 shows the prevalence of E coli urinary isolates 
resistance to antibiotics. These data were obtained from 
forest plots generated for each antibiotic (appendix 4).
For all antibiotics tested, the prevalence of antibiotic 
resistance was higher in non-OECD than in OECD countries. 
For all countries the prevalence of resistance was highest 
for ampicillin. Figure 2 shows the pooled prevalence (or 
 
single study reported prevalence if n=1) of ampicillin 
 
resistance by country. Switzerland had the lowest preva-
lence at 41%, with Ghana and Nigeria highest at 100%.
Pooled prevalences of resistance to co-trimoxazole 
and trimethoprim were high in OECD countries, with 
co-trimoxazole resistance at 30%. Resistance to co-tri-
moxazole was more than twice as high in non-OECD 
compared with OECD countries. Trimethoprim resis-
tance was reported in only one non-OECD study, con-
ducted by Al-Mugeiren and colleagues in Saudi-Arabia, 
which reported 67% resistance from 596 isolates.70 
Nitrofurantoin resistance was the lowest of all reported 
for all countries.
Pooled prevalences of resistance to ciprofloxacin and 
ceftazidime in children’s E coli urinary isolates were 
both around 2% in OECD countries; however, resistance 
to both antibiotics was over 10 times higher in non-
OECD countries, both over 26% (table 2).
When we stratified by “reported first line” antibiotic 
versus “first line not specified” for each country, esti-
mates of prevalence of resistance for OECD countries were 
similar to overall OECD estimates reported in table 2, with 
little difference in estimates when first line treatment was 
specified or not. In non-OECD countries, however, pooled 
estimates of resistance were generally higher for those 
countries that specified the antibiotic as first line. The dif-
ference was particularly large for co-trimoxazole (first 
line pooled resistance 76.2% (95% confidence interval 
64.1% to 87
.2%) versus non-first line resistance 55.6% 
(26.6% to 84.7%)) and ciprofloxacin (first line pooled 
resistance 58.1% (51.5% to 64.7%)  
versus non-first-line 
pooled resistance 15.8% (4.7% to 26.8%) (appendix 5).

Prevalence of resistance in children aged 0-5
Twelve studies reported resistance in urinary E coli spe-
cifically for children aged 0-5, seven from OECD coun-
tries and five from non-OECD countries (table 3 ). As 
there were insufficient data to compare with children 
and young people aged 6-17
, we compared these data 
with data from all children (table 2). As with all chil-
dren, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in children 
aged 0-5 was higher in non-OECD than OECD countries. 
Compared with the data for all children, in OECD coun-
tries the pooled prevalence of resistance in urinary 
E coli in children aged 0-5 was higher for ampicillin and 
ceftazidime, and lower for co-amoxiclav, co- 
trimoxazole, 
and nitrofurantoin (table 2). In non-OECD countries, 
resistance was higher against all reported antibiotics 
for children aged 0-5 compared with all children.
association between previous antibiotic exposure 
and bacterial resistance
Figure 3  shows a forest plot of five studies investigating 
the relation between previous exposure to any versus no 
antibiotics and bacterial resistance. The studies varied in 
the combinations of antibiotic resistance and exposure 
investigated, some reporting resistance and exposure to 
any antibiotic, while others reported resistance to tri-
methoprim, co-trimoxazole, or third generation cephalo-
sporins. In figure 3 , for all time periods of exposure the 
crude odds of resistance were greater in children exposed 
to antibiotics than in those who were unexposed. The 
effect sizes show a decline between exposure time peri-
ods of 0-1 month (pooled odds ratio 8.38, 95% confidence 
interval 2.84 to 24.77) and 0-3 months (3.38, 2.05 to 5.55), 
then an increase at 0-6 months (13.23, 7
.84 to 22.31). The 
study by Allen and colleagues, which explored the asso-
ciation between exposure to any antibiotic in the previ-
ous six months and resistance to co-trimoxazole, 
measured previous exposure to antibiotics for four weeks 
or more within the six months before the urine sample 
was taken. The three other studies shown in figure 3 
 
measured exposure to any antibiotic for an unspecified 
total prescription time period. Given the overlap in the 
exposure time periods reported by the included studies, 
we did not conduct a meta-regression analysis for the 
data presented in  
figure 3.
There was no evidence of heterogeneity within 
groups in the 0-1 month time period, with too few stud-
ies in the 0-3 and 0-6 months time periods to calculate 
heterogeneity. Of the four studies included in figure 3, 
three reported odds ratios adjusted for sex, age, race, 
renal abnormalities, and previous admission to hospi-
tal. The adjusted odds ratio did not differ substantially 
from the crude pooled estimates.
The study by Duffy and colleagues was the only one 
of those measuring the association between antibiotic 
exposure and resistance to report results based on 
 
multiple urinary isolates per child and with a more 
accurate measure of antibiotic exposure24 ; therefore we 
chose to report this study separately. Figure 4 shows the 
crude multilevel odds ratios for resistance to trimetho-
prim relative to the number of days since exposure to 
trimethoprim. Duffy and colleagues reported multilevel

patients, along with the number of isolates with 
reported exposure to trimethoprim only for each time

ables included sex, socioeconomic status, rurality, and 
total number of E coli isolates in the study period. The

Principal findings
The 58 studies from both OECD and non-OECD coun-
tries provide evidence of high rates of bacterial resis-
tance in E coli isolates from children with urinary tract 
infection to some of the most commonly prescribed 
antibiotics in primary care. Worldwide, rates of 
 
resistance to ampicillin were the highest and nitrofu-
rantoin rates lowest, irrespective of OECD status. Resis-
tance to all reported antibiotics was higher in non-OECD 
than OECD countries, with resistance rates higher to 
first line than to non-first line antibiotics. Resistance 
could render several first line antibiotics ineffective in 
some countries. Prescribing of antibiotics to individual 
children in primary care is an important contributor to 
bacterial resistance, which can persist for up to six 
months after prescription.

children’s urinary tract infection and associations with 
the routine use of antibiotics in primary care. WHO 
recently published their “global action plan” on antimi-
crobial resistance, which described data relating to the 
prevalence of resistance, including geographical pat-
terns, as a key gap in our current knowledge,80  which 
this systematic review in part fills. Our review was rigor-
ously conducted according to the Cochrane guide-
lines.17  We chose to stratify our results by OECD status 
to reflect both national development and likely avail-
ability of over-the-counter antibiotics.3 
81
We are, however, aware of several limitations. Firstly, 
antibiotics are used differently within OECD and non-
OECD countries,82-85  and over-the-counter use is difficult 
to measure. A 2011 systematic review reported high 
worldwide variability in non-prescription antibiotics,81 
with some evidence of less than 100% agreement 
between OECD status and over-the-counter availability. 
To our knowledge there is no better country level alterna-
tive, and none of the included studies reported or mea-
sured availability of over-the-counter antibiotics. We also 
acknowledge that factors other than antibiotic use and 
over-the-counter availability can account for differences 
in resistance prevalence between OECD and non-OECD 
countries, including poor sanitation, unstable gover-
nance, and lower levels of regulation of medicines. 
Although it is useful to explore changes in resistance 
over time, (for example, to understand the impact of vac-
cination), we were also unable to explore this as the data 
collected overlapped in terms of recruitment periods.
Of the five studies we included in our meta-analysis, 
most reported the association between previous antibi-
otic exposure and resistance within overlapping time 
periods. This implies that the associations with longer 
time periods (such as 0-6 months) could reflect a com-
bination of long and short term associations. The odds 
ratios were highest in the 0-6 months time period; prob-
ably because this individual study measured exposure 
to antibiotics for a combined total of four weeks or more 
within the previous six months compared with no expo-
sure within the six month time period.68 The other stud-
ies measured exposure to antibiotics within an 
undefined combined length of prescription time within 
the measured time period versus no antibiotic 
 
prescriptions. None of the studies we included in our 
meta-analysis reported antibiotic doses, so we were 
unable to evaluate any dose-response effects.
In most countries it is standard practice to treat empir-
ically with an antibiotic when a child presents to primary 
care with a suspected urinary tract infection. Sometimes 
a urine sample is taken only if the illness does not 
respond to first line antibiotic treatment. This can lead to 
falsely high reported resistance rates to first line antibiot-
ics. This problem would be removed if only incident 
cases were included or systematic urine sampling was 
used, but studies did not present this information. That 
said, there were no obvious differences in resistance 
rates according to the timing of the urine sampling. Fur-
thermore, variation in sampling strategies could explain 
some of the variation in pooled prevalence of resistance 
between OECD and non-OECD countries, though this 
could not be explored from the data available. Reverse 
causality and other confounding associations could also 
have introduced bias to our findings; including previous 
hospital admissions, comorbidities, age, and sex. Stud-
ies that attempted to adjust for confounding factors, 
however, did not show differences between crude and 
adjusted estimates of association.
results in the context of existing research
Prevalence of urinary bacterial resistance
We believe our rates of prevalence of resistance are accu-
rate as they are consistent with other data sources. The 
highest reported resistance to ampicillin in our review 
was similar to the reported aminopenicillin group resis-
tance in the European EARS-Net database and US Centre 
for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP) 
databases.86 
87  Resistance to ampicillin in other studies 
from the US ranged between 36% and 54%, suggesting 
that resistance to antibiotics in young children is similar 
to that of the general population. The similarities 
observed here could be a result of transmission between 
age groups of genetic resistance factors such as plas-
mids, facilitated through frequent interaction between 
children and adults. Trimethoprim resistance was 
reported by three studies from the UK, all with large sam-
ple sizes (>1700 isolates); all reported resistance in 
excess of 20%. These are similar to levels of trimethoprim 
resistance reported by other UK based studies; Bean and 
colleagues reported trimethoprim resistance in commu-
nity acquired urinary isolates from adults and children at 
39%.88 Additionally, Farrell and colleagues reported 27% 
resistance in E coli urinary isolates from all age groups.89 
 
In total, seven OECD studies from five countries (UK, Ire-
land, Austria, Australia, and Sweden) reported suscepti-
bility to trimethoprim; these were also the only countries 
to report trimethoprim as a first line antibiotic treatment 
for urinary tract infection (appendix 5). Trimethoprim 
resistance was infrequently tested for in many studies 
from OECD countries, which probably because it is not a 
first line treatment in their country. Co-trimoxazole was 
the most common first line treatment for urinary tract 
infection worldwide (15 countries and 37 studies). Resis-
tance to co-trimoxazole was relatively high worldwide, 
particularly in non-OECD countries at 64%. Resistance to 
nitrofurantoin, an antibiotic used almost exclusively for 
urinary tract infections, was low worldwide, supporting 
its continued effectiveness as a first line treatment for 
uncomplicated infections.90-92
For many of the antibiotics reported in this review, the 
pooled prevalence of resistance was higher in children 
aged 0-5 than in all children and young people (0-17). It 
has been previously suggested that resistance levels are 
likely to be higher in those communities with a higher 
proportion of young children because of their high con-
sumption of antibiotics.93  A study conducted in France 
found that children aged under 7 consumed three times 
more antibiotics than older populations.94 The findings in 
our review support this theory as resistance to all com-
monly prescribed antibiotics worldwide was higher in 
younger children than in children of predominantly older 
age. Our findings also suggest there could be a reversible

element of antibiotic resistance, whereby reduced use of 
antibiotics (in older children) reduces the selective pres-
sure that favours antibiotic resistant strains.
Association between previous antibiotic exposure 
and bacterial resistance
Our meta-analysis showing an association between 
exposure to antibiotics in the previous six months and 
isolation of resistant urinary isolates is similar to our 
previous 2010 review, which explored the effect of anti-
biotic prescribing in primary care on the development 
of resistance in individual patients of all ages.5  Consis-
tent with our previous review, we found some evidence 
from Duffy and colleagues of decreasing resistance for 
increasing time from antibiotic prescribing.24
Policy, clinical, and research implications
Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of 
the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children 
primary care, which could result in several drugs becom-
ing ineffective first line treatments in many countries. 
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in col-
laboration with the European Society for Microbiology 
and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)95 recommend that an 
antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treat-
ment of urinary tract infection only if the local preva-
lence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these 
guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxaz-
ole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line 
treatment options for urinary tract infection in many 
OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, 
such as those published by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. 
In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibi-
otics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess 
of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line 
treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well 
developed countries. Our results also support the need 
for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local 
resistance and that, for many areas,  
nitrofurantoin might 
be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower uri-
nary tract infection. That said, care is needed because 
ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead 
clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line anti-
biotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and 
quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use 
of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.
Prevalence of resistance to common antibiotics in pri-
mary care was higher in non-OECD countries than 
OECD countries, which could be because of weaker 
infrastructure of primary care, weaker regulation of 
antibiotic use, and the need for higher use of antibiotic 
because of higher risks of serious bacterial infection in 
children living in non-OECD countries. Improved infra-
structure of primary care, access to healthcare, and 
antibiotic regulation might be necessary to reduce the 
burden of antimicrobial resistance in these settings.
Furthermore, the results indicate that bacterial resis-
tance to antibiotics can persist for up to six months after 
antibiotic exposure in individual children. The study 
conducted by Duffy and colleagues is an exemplar of 
how future studies should measure associations 
between resistance and time since exposure to antibiot-
ics.24  In addition, future studies should also consider 
inclusion of incident data whenever possible to facilitate 
better comparison with other studies. Primary care clini-
cians should consider the impact of any antibiotic use 
on subsequent antimicrobial resistance and avoid their 
unnecessary use by following local and national guid-
ance whenever possible. When antibiotic treatment is 
needed, our findings suggest that clinicians should con-
sider a child’s antibiotic use in the past six months when 
selecting further treatment, avoiding the use of broad 
spectrum antibiotics whenever possible.96  Our findings 
also support other evidence for the continued availabil-
ity of nitrofurantoin as an effective treatment for uncom-
plicated urinary tract infections in primary care.91 
97
Conclusions
Prevalence of resistance to commonly prescribed pri-
mary care antibiotics in E coli urinary tract infections in 
children is high, particularly in non-OECD countries, 
where one possible explanation is availability of antibi-
otics over the counter. This could render some drugs 
ineffective as first line treatments for urinary tract infec-
tion. Routine use of antibiotics in primary care contrib-
utes to antimicrobial resistance in children, which can 
persist for up to six months after antibiotic prescription.
