Abstract
Background Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been largely replaced by organophosphate flame retardants
(OPFRs) and alternative brominated flame retardants (Alt-BFRs) to meet flammability requirements. Humans are ubiqui-
tously exposed to some variety of flame retardants through contact with consumer products directly or through household
dust.
Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of house cleaning and hand washing practices to reduce exposure to flame
retardants, we measured concentrations in dermal hand wipes and urinary metabolites before and after assignment to two
consecutive interventions.
Methods We selected 32 mother and child dyads from an existing cohort. This analysis focuses on mothers. Participants
provided baseline measurements (urine, hand wipes, and questionnaires) and were then assigned for 1 week to either a house
cleaning (including instruction on proper technique and cleaning supplies) or hand washing (including instruction on proper
technique and soaps) intervention arm. For the second week, participants were assigned to the second intervention in
addition to their initial assignment, thus all subjects both washed their hands and cleaned according to the intervention
guidelines during week 2. We collected measurements at the end of weeks 1 and 2.
Results We found reductions in urinary analytes after week 1 of house cleaning (BCIPHIPP and ip-DPHP), week 1 of hand
washing (BCIPP, BCIPHIPP, and tbutyl-DPHP), and week 2 of combined interventions (BCIPHIPP and tbutyl-DPHP),
compare to baseline. We found no significant decline in hand wipes in the entire sample but did find reductions after week 1
of house cleaning (BDE 209), week 1 of hand washing (TCEP), and week 2 of combined interventions (TDCIPP and BDE
209) in women with exposure above the median at baseline (verified through simulations).
Conclusions Exposure to individual flame retardants was reduced by about half, in some cases, by 1 week of increased hand
washing, house cleaning to reduce dust, or combined activities.

Introduction
Anthropogenic flame retardant chemicals are included in a
myriad of consumer products, ranging from polyurethane
foam in furniture to electronics, to meet the flammability
requirements at the state and federal levels in the US. [1, 2].
Many of these additive flame retardants are not chemically
bound to consumer products, and thus have a tendency to
migrate into the external environment [3]. Polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were originally the most highly
used chemicals for reducing flammability in furniture
because of their low cost, efficiency, and availability [4, 5].
Growing concerns over the health impacts of exposure (i.e.,
neurobehavioral effects) [6–11] led to the voluntary phase-

 out of industrial production and application of penta- and
octa-BDE mixtures by 2005. Phase-out of deca-BDE was
meant to be completed by 2013, with the largest producers
and importers of deca-BDE in the US committing to end its
production, importation, and sale for all uses, but its status
is still uncertain [12–14].
To replace these PBDE mixtures [4, 15, 16], manu-
facturers have introduced organophosphate flame retardants
(OPFRs) and alternative brominated flame retardants (Alt-
BFRs) which have increased in use since 2005. OPFRs
(also referred to as PFRs (phosphorous flame retardants)
and OPEs (organophosphate ethers)), including triphenyl
phosphate (TPHP), tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate
(TDCIPP, also called Tris), tris-(2-chloroethyl) phosphate
(TCEP), and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP),
have become pervasive in the environment and in humans
[17–22]. OPFRs are used not only as flame retardants, but
also in other applications, such as plastics [23]. Two Alt-
BFRs, 2-ethylhexyl-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB) and bis(2-
ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), components of a
commercial mixture known as Firemaster550 (FM 550) [4],
which also contains OPFRs, have been repeatedly detected
in household dust [15, 24] and at varying levels in human
urine (from 27% detection [25] to 77% detection [26]). Dust
is believed to be the primary pathway of exposure. Since
flame retardants are not chemically bound to consumer
products, they leach into the external environment and are
inadvertently ingested through dust exposure, primarily via
hand-to-mouth activity [27]. OPFRs are rapidly metabo-
lized, with half-lives of several hours in animal models,
compared to half-lives of PBDEs between 1.8 and 6.5 years
in humans [3, 20, 28–32]. However, due to continuous
exposure to both OPFRs and Alt-BFRs through household
products, exposure measures likely approximate a constant
body burden, with intra-class correlations (ICCs) of 0.50
(DPHP) and 0.72 (BDCIPP) previously reported [26, 33].
OPFRs are structurally similar to neurotoxic organo-
phosphate pesticides and have demonstrated neurotoxicity
in laboratory models, raising concerns about exposure and
toxicity to humans [34–37]. In human epidemiologic stu-
dies, OPFR exposure has been associated with disruptions
of the endocrine system [17, 38], decreased fertility [39],
and thyroid function [40]. More research is needed to
understand the toxicokinetics and potential effects of Alt-
BFRs [41].
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in
assessing the risks of flame retardant exposure, provides
recommendations for exposure mitigation to parents of
young children [42]. This advice to minimize exposure to
flame retardants is based on previous research implicating
dust as the principle exposure pathway of PBDEs [27]. The
EPA suggests practical steps, including hand washing,
especially before eating, and house cleaning, specifically
dusting with a moist cloth, wet mopping, and vacuuming, to
reduce exposure to flame retardants [42].
In the present study, we assessed changes in urinary
flame retardant metabolite levels and in dermal concentra-
tions measured by hand wipes before, during, and after a
population-based behavioral intervention study based on
EPA recommendations designed to mitigate exposure to
flame retardants through household dust.
Materials and methods
Participants
We selected 32 mother and child dyads from the previously
established Sibling-Hermanos Cohort, which began in
2008, consisting of Dominican and African–American
mothers and children from Northern Manhattan and the
South Bronx. Briefly, these women were enrolled in the
Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health
Mothers and Newborns birth cohort between 1998 and 2006
[43], and when subsequently pregnant with a singleton, they
were invited to enroll an additional child in the Sibling-
Hermanos cohort, which was followed prospectively [24].
Among participants with children between the ages of 3–6
years between December 2015 and May 2016, we invited
women and children from the Sibling-Hermanos Cohort to
participate in our intervention study, described in detail
below.
The current analysis of this intervention is restricted to
mothers because they provided more complete samples and
data than children. In an ancillary report, we describe the
relationship between flame retardants measured in paired
samples from mothers and children (in preparation).
Intervention
Interventions were based on EPA recommendations for
flame retardant exposure mitigation [42]. All participants
provided urine and hand wipe samples and completed a
detailed questionnaire at baseline. Participants were ran-
domly assigned to one of two study arms, conditional on
race/ethnicity,
to
guarantee
equal
distributions
of
African–American and Dominican women in each arm.
This ensured that race/ethnicity, which has been found to be
associated with flame retardant exposure [44], was not
associated with intervention arm. Those in the cleaning arm
were told to clean their home with an emphasis on removing
dust during week 1, given instructions on proper cleaning
techniques, and incentivized with flame retardant-free
cleaning products, mops and buckets, microfiber dust
cloths, and handheld vacuums without a HEPA filter. They
were asked to use the vacuum as much as they liked, with
34

 the suggestion that they open windows while vacuuming to
reduce exposure to recirculating dust. Those in the hand
washing arm were told to wash their hands in a specific
manner during week 1, given instructions on proper wash-
ing techniques and necessary length of time, and incenti-
vized with flame retardant-free soaps. They were asked to
wash their hands more often, particularly before they ate.
Directions and reinforcement materials are included in
the Supplemental materials. All participants provided urine
and hand wipe samples and completed a follow-up ques-
tionnaire after week 1 (Fig. 1).
During week 2, all participants were assigned to both
study arms. Those who cleaned during week 1 were addi-
tionally instructed to increase hand washing during week 2.
Those who washed their hands during week 1 were addi-
tionally instructed to increase house cleaning during week
2. All participants provided urine and hand wipe samples
and completed a follow-up questionnaire after week 2
(Fig. 1). With this crossover design, all participants had
equivalent assignments at baseline (pre-intervention) and
after week 2 (combined intervention), but assignment at
week 1 varied with equal groups of 16 families assigned to
each arm.
Sample collection
All adults gave informed consent for themselves and their
children before sample collection. At each visit (baseline,
after week 1, after week 2), we administered a short ques-
tionnaire to the mothers which included information about
hours typically spent in the home and typical hand washing
and house cleaning behaviors. At each visit, we collected a
spot urine sample and a hand wipe sample from the mother
and her child. As previously described [45], we wiped the
entire palm and back surface of both hands from the base of
the fingernails to the wrist with a 3×3 pre-cleaned cotton
pad saturated with 3 mL of isopropyl alcohol. We wrapped
the collected hand wipe in an aluminum foil packet, inserted
it into a glass vial, and covered the glass vial in bubble
wrap, which was subsequently stored in a cooler for
transport to our laboratory where samples were stored at
−20 °C. We collected field blanks (whose purpose was to
assess the potential for field contamination) at 10% of
randomly selected households by saturating a pre-cleaned
wipe with isopropyl alcohol and placing it directly into an
aluminum foil packet.
Laboratory analysis
Hand wipe and urine samples were extracted and analyzed
using methods published previously for each matrix for
PBDEs, OPFRs, and Alt-BFRs in hand wipes and for
OPFRs in urine [20, 22, 25, 26]. Entire hand wipe samples
were spiked individually with F-BDE-69, 13C-BDE-209,
13C-TBB, and 13C-TPHP as internal standards (positive
controls) and extracted three times by sonication with 1:1
hexane/acetone (v/v). The combined extracts were con-
centrated (roughly 45 mL) to 1 mL using a nitrogen eva-
poration system and transferred to an autosampler vial for
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. F-BDE-
69, 13C-BDE-209, 13C-TBB, and 13C-TPHP recoveries
averaged
94.39%,
55.36%,
84.66%,
and
71.19%,
respectively.
We used a digital hand-held refractometer (Atago) to
measure specific gravity for each urine sample. Using
methods described previously, 5.0 mL of urine was spiked
individually with d-BDCIPP, d-DPHP, and d-TDCIPP as
internal standards and combined with a sodium acetate
buffer and an enzyme solution, then incubated overnight at
37 °C. The flame retardant metabolites were extracted via
mixed-mode anion-exchange solid-phase extraction and
measured using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (Agilent
Technologies, Model 6410) [22]. d-BDCIPP, d-DPHP, and
d-TDCIPP recoveries averaged 107%, 69.4%, and 69.1%,
respectively. The method detection limits (MDLs) were
calculated using three times the standard deviation of the
blanks normalized to the volume of urine extracted. Six
urinary metabolites of OPFR flame retardants were mea-
sured: bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), bis
(1-chloro-2-propyl)
phosphate
(BCIPP),
bis(1-chloro-2-
isopropyl)
1-hydroxy-2-propyl
phosphate
(BCIPHIPP),
diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), two alkylated DPHPs (ip-
DPHP and tbutyl-DPHP) (Table 1). MDLs ranged from
0.08 ng/mL (ip-DPHP and tbutyl-DPHP) to 0.64 ng/mL
(BCIPHIPP) for urinary metabolites. All hand wipes and

Data analysis
Urinary concentrations are reported as analyte mass per
volume (nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)), normalized by
specific gravity to account for urinary dilution [46]. Hand
wipe concentrations are reported as total analyte mass per
hand wipe (nanograms (ng) from both hands). We exam-
ined the concentration and distribution of flame retardant
analytes in each sample. Measurements below the MDL
were assigned the sample-specific MDL/√2 [47]. All sta-
tistical analyses were repeated separately for urine and hand
wipe measurements.
We measured 29 analytes in hand wipes, including 23
PBDEs, two Alt-BFRs, and four OPFRs, and six OPFR
metabolites in urine. Analyses were conducted for analytes
with detection frequency >50%. We summed five repre-
sentative PBDEs (BDE 47, BDE 99, BDE 100, BDE 153,
and BDE 154) and both measured Alt-BFRs (TBB and
TBPH) to create two composite scores, ΣBDE and ΣAlt-
BFR, for concentrations in hand wipes. This analysis
includes ΣBDE, BDE 209, ΣAlt-BFR, TCEP, TCIPP,
TDCIPP, and TPHP in hand wipes and all urinary meta-
bolites of OPFRs (relationships between parent compounds
and metabolites are detailed in Table 1).
Flame retardant concentrations were not normally dis-
tributed; as they approximated a log-normal distribution, we
log-transformed all concentrations in regression models and
used non-parametric tests for correlation and differences
between time points (sensitivity analysis). We conducted
bivariate
analyses
using
linear
regression
with
log-
transformed
flame
retardant
concentrations
as
the
outcomes to determine if baseline exposure concentrations
differed by demographic variables or by baseline cleaning
practices. Because this study included seven analytes in
hand wipes and six metabolites in urine, consistency in
direction and magnitude were assessed across flame retar-
dants within each sampling matrix to identify predictors of
flame retardant exposure. Variables found to be associated
with baseline concentrations of flame retardants and also
associated with intervention arm despite random assignment
(e.g., hours spent at home) were included as covariates in
statistical models.
We used mixed-effects models for repeated measures
(three urine samples and three hand wipes within each
individual), with participant included as a multilevel ran-
dom effect to evaluate the changes in concentrations over
time. Intervention was categorized into four groups—
baseline, week 1/cleaning, week 1/hand washing, and week
2/combined—and this variable was included as a fixed
effect to assess the changes from baseline to the end of
week 1 for each intervention arm and from baseline to the
end of week 2 for the combined study sample. We adjusted
all hand wipe models for time since last hand wash and
hours spent at home and all urine models for hours spent at
home (during the previous week).
We conducted sensitivity analyses on these results
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on matched pairs to
assess the differences in concentrations between baseline
and week 1 within study arms and between baseline and
week 2.
After stratifying the mixed-effects models by partici-
pant’s exposure at baseline (categorized as either high or
low based on the median concentration), we repeated the
analysis for all flame retardants. Because of concerns over
regression to the mean when focusing on participants with
initially high exposure, we simulated a null association
across the course of the study (i.e., no change from baseline)
within those with high baseline exposure levels. To do this,
we sampled from the baseline distribution of those 16
individuals above the median exposure level (individuals
classified as high varied across flame retardants), with
replacement, three times to create three time points within
individuals to simulate a model of null association. We
repeated this sampling and modeling process 1000 times.
We then took the beta coefficients from the bootstrapped
mixed-effects models (with components identical to the
original models) to create a distribution of coefficients
representative of random chance. We finally compared our
observed coefficient from the mixed-effects models to the
betas generated from the random distribution. We repeated
these steps for the 16 individuals below median exposure at
baseline. In the instances where our observed coefficient
was greater than two standard deviations from the mean of
the randomly generated distribution of beta coefficients, we

 affirmed that our finding could not be explained as a
byproduct of regression.
We evaluated the influence of individual participants on
exposure. To evaluate the effects over the course of the
study, we estimated the ICC within individuals (the var-
iance attributable to the random effect of each participant
divided by the total variance).
We also compared the measurements between flame
retardant levels in hand wipes and urine. We calculated
Spearman correlation coefficients to examine the associa-
tions between urinary metabolites and their parent com-
pounds in hand wipes, averaging baseline and week
1 samples to evaluate the correlation during week 1’s
intervention, and averaging week 1 and week 2 samples to
evaluate the correlation during week 2’s shared interven-
tion, and creating overall composites of urine samples and
of hand wipes (the average of three time points, each) to
evaluate correlation across the length of the study.
We performed statistical analyses in SAS statistical
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and in
R (version 3.3.3; R Development Core Team 2017); sta-
tistical tests were conducted at the 0.05 significance level.
Results
Thirty-two mothers provided baseline urine and hand wipe
samples. Of these, two mothers failed to provide urine
samples and one failed to provide a hand wipe sample after
week 2. The mean age of mothers in the study was 32.6
years. The intervention arms differed marginally on average
hours at home per day (p = 0.05). Characteristics of study
participants are provided in Table 2.
DPHP, BDCIPP, and ip-DPHP were detected in 100% of
maternal urine samples at baseline (Table 3). BCIPHIPP
and tbutyl-DPHP were both detected in 96.9% of urine
samples. BCIPP was detected in 87.5% of maternal sam-
ples. We found detectable levels of all analytes in 100% of
hand wipes. Geometric means (with standard deviations) in
maternal urine samples at baseline ranged from 0.22 (1.94)
ng/mL for tbutyl-DPHP to 6.92 (2.16) ng/mL for ip-DPHP.
Geometric means for analytes in hand wipes at baseline
ranged from 11.75 (2.50) ng for BDE-209 to 167.82 (3.82)
ng for TPHP (Table 3).
Differences in exposure at baseline
Demographic
variables
(race/ethnicity—Dominican
or
African American, maternal education, and age), cleaning
practices (frequency of cleaning, type of cleaning, window
position (opened/closed) during cleaning, and frequency of
hand washing), and lifestyle factors (number of stuffed
pieces of furniture at home, nail biting, diet, and hours spent
at home) were investigated as potential predictors of flame
retardant exposure.
Among three or more of the flame retardants measured in
hand wipes, time since last hand wash, ethnicity, and hours
spent at home were associated (p < 0.15) with and explained
a noticeable proportion of the variance (R2 > 0.10). These
three variables were then included in a multivariable linear
model (Suppl. Table 1). Increased time since last hand wash
was consistently associated with higher flame retardant
levels in bivariate models, but not when adjusting for race/
ethnicity and time spent at home. African Americans had
lower levels of TCEP (p = 0.07), TCIPP (p = 0.03), TPHP
(p = 0.01), and BDE 209 (p = 0.04) than Dominican
Americans. Women who spend more time outside the home
had higher exposure to TCIPP (p = 0.10), TDCIPP (p =
0.05), TPHP (p = 0.09), and ΣAlt-BFRs (p = 0.03).
In univariate analysis of urine samples, race/ethnicity
was associated with DPHP (p=0.03), with African Amer-
icans, on average, having higher concentrations of the

higher levels of BCIPP (p=0.11) in unadjusted models.
Generally, there were no predictors of exposure at p<0.15 or
variables that explained a noticeable proportion of the
variance (R2>0.10) for three or more urinary metabolites
(our pre-set criteria). Maternal education had an R2>0.10 for
DPHP (p=0.02) and BCIPHIPP (p=0.18), with more edu-
cated mothers having higher levels of BCIPHIPP but lower
levels of DPHP.
Effectiveness of intervention
Hand washing
We
found
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
analytes measured in hand wipes in the hand washing
intervention arm after week 1, controlling for time since last
hand wash and hours at home (Suppl. Figure 1). We found
significant decreases in urinary metabolites (BCIPP, BCI-
PHIPP, and tbutyl-DPHP) in the hand washing intervention
arm after week 1, controlling for hours spent at home
(Fig. 2). Figure 3 depicts percent change in urinary
metabolites.
After week 1 in the hand washing intervention arm,
we found, on average, a 52.36% (95% CI: −73.29, −15.63;
p = 0.01) decrease in BCIPP; a 30.81% (95% CI: −54.62,
6.18; p = 0.09) decrease in urinary metabolites of BCI-
PHIPP; and a 48.02% (95% CI: −67.37, −17.30; p = 0.01)
decrease in tbutyl-DPHP (Table 4).
In stratified hand wipe models (Fig. 4), those above
median exposure at baseline had consistently lower expo-
sure in the hand washing group across flame retardants after
week 1 based on mixed-effects models. Hand washing in
highly exposed participants in week 1 was associated with a
56.65% (95% CI: −79.4, −9.52; p = 0.03) decrease in
TCEP; a 38.63% (95% CI: −64.3, 5.13; p = 0.07) decrease
in TCIPP; and a 44.61% (95% CI: −69.58, 1.01; p = 0.05)
decrease in ΣAlt-BFRs (Table 5).
House cleaning
We found no statistically significant differences in analytes
measured in hand wipes in the house cleaning intervention
arm after week 1, controlling for time since last hand wash
and hours at home (Suppl. Figure 1). We found significant
decreases in urinary metabolites (BCIPHIPP and ip-DPHP)
in the house cleaning intervention arm after week 1, con-
trolling for hours spent at home (Fig. 2).
After week 1 in the house cleaning intervention arm, we
observed, on average, a 47.24% (95% CI: −65.35, −19.75;

CI: −58.1, 4.08; p = 0.08) decrease in ip-DPHP (Table 4).
In stratified hand wipe models (Fig. 4), those above
median exposure at baseline had consistently lower exposure
in the house cleaning intervention arm across flame retar-
dants after week 1 based on mixed-effects models. In those
most exposed, house cleaning in week 1 was associated with
a 57.63% (95% CI: −81.36, −3.92; p = 0.04) decrease in
BDE 209 (Table 5). In stratified models of urinary meta-
bolites, in addition to flame retardants with significant
reductions prior to stratification (BCIPHIPP and ip-DPHP),
BCIPP decreased 77.36% (95% CI: −90.93, −40.55, p =
0.004) after week 1 of house cleaning (Suppl. Figure 2).
Combined
We found no statistically significant differences in analytes
measured in hand wipes after week 2 of combined inter-
ventions, controlling for time since last hand wash and
hours at home (Suppl. Figure 1). We found significant
decreases in urinary metabolites (BCIPHIPP and tbutyl-
DPHP) after week 2 of combined interventions, controlling
for hours spent at home (Fig. 2).
After week 2 of combined hand washing and house
cleaning, we found a 43.41% (95% CI: −60.15, −19.75;
p = 0.002) decrease in BCIPHIPP; a 31.00% (95%
CI: −52.76, 1.01; p = 0.06) decrease in tbutyl-DPHP; and
an unexpected 72.91% (95% CI: 19.72, 150.93; p = 0.004)
increase in DPHP (Table 4).
In stratified hand wipe models (Fig. 4), those above
median exposure at baseline had consistently lower expo-
sure after week 2 across flame retardants. After week 2 of
combined interventions, those above the median at baseline
had TDCIPP levels 37.10% (95% CI: −58.93, −2.96;
p = 0.04) lower than at baseline; TPHP levels 46.98% (95%
CI: −73.82, 7.25; p = 0.08) lower than at baseline; and
BDE 209 levels 58.63% (95% CI: −79.4, −16.47;
p = 0.02) lower than at baseline (Table 5). In stratified
models of urinary metabolites, in addition to flame retar-
dants with significant reductions prior to stratification
(BCIPHIPP and tbutyl-DPHP), BDCIPP decreased 36.76%
(95% CI: −55.07, −3.92; p = 0.03) after combined inter-
ventions in week 2 (Suppl. Figure 2).
Intra-class correlations
We used variance estimates from the mixed-effects models
to measure ICCs among observations within the same
individual (Table 4), estimating the percentage of the total
variance explained. Intra-individual correlations in urine
samples ranged from 0.27 (DPHP) to 0.52 (BDCIPP). In
hand wipes, the lowest ICC observed was 0.00 (TCEP), but
five of the seven analytes had ICCs between 0.61 (TDCIPP
and TPHP) and 0.67 (ΣAlt-BFR).

Flame retardant exposure assessment: findings from a behavioral intervention study
39
 Cross-sample correlations
We investigated Spearman correlations between parent
compounds in hand wipes and urinary metabolites. Con-
sistent correlations in mothers were found between aver-
aged hand wipes and averaged urine samples (baseline,
week 1, and week 2); sample pooling across the length of
the study was done to stabilize intra-individual variation in
exposure and metabolism (Table 6).
TDCIPP in maternal hand wipes was significantly cor-
related with BDCIPP in urine (r = 0.51; p = 0.01). TPHP in
hand wipes was significantly correlated with DPHP (r =
0.51; p = 0.01). Correlations between TDCIPP and TPHP
and their metabolites within week 1 and week 2 appeared
similar. TCIPP concentrations were not significantly cor-
related with urinary BCIPP (r = 0.26; p = 0.18) over the
course of the study, but they were during week 1 (r = 0.38;
p = 0.03); TCIPP was consistently non-significantly and
negatively correlated with BCIPHIPP.
Sensitivity analyses
Analysis using unadjusted Wilcoxon signed rank tests for
observations across time produced similar, though atte-
nuated, results. We found no significant differences in
concentrations between time points in hand wipe samples.
In urine samples stratified by intervention group, there were
significant decreases in BCIPP (p = 0.02) and BCIPHIPP
(p = 0.04), both metabolites of TCIPP, within the hand
washing group between baseline and week 1. We found no
significant differences within the house cleaning group
between baseline and week 1. Between baseline and
week 2, we found a significant decrease in BCIPHIPP
(p = 0.0003) and a significant increase in tbutyl-DPHP
(p = 0.02). In adjusted models, the difference between
baseline and week 2 tbutyl-DPHP was negative and sig-
nificant. The significant increase in DPHP after week 2 seen
in the mixed-effects model was not replicated using a
Wilcoxon sign ranked test.
Simulations
We conducted simulations using hand wipe and urine data
to determine if our stratified results were subject to mod-
eling choices and to assess the models’ robustness (Suppl.
Figures 3 and 4). Simulations of hand wipe data above the
median at baseline confirmed that negative beta coefficients
for TCEP at all time points, TDCIPP after week 2, and BDE
209 at all time points were more extreme than chance.
Coefficients for TCIPP, TPHP, and ΣAlt-BFR, while at
least marginally significant in stratified models, could not be
distinguished from random chance. Simulations of urine
data above the median at baseline upheld that decreases in
BCIPP after week 1 of house cleaning and in BDCIPP after
week 2 (the only significant associations in the stratified
models that were not significant in the original models)
were more extreme than chance findings. All significant
coefficients in the stratified urine models (including those

had changed over the course of the intervention. Five
women (15.6%) said that they spent less time, nine (28.1%)
said that they spent about the same amount of time, and 17
(53.1%) said they spent more time cleaning during the
intervention than usual. Only five women (15.6%) had a
vacuum available for their use at baseline. Twenty-eight
(87.5%) used the vacuum they were given as incentive at
least once.
When asked directly if their hand washing habits had
changed, 22 participants (68.8%) responded that they had.

Flame retardant exposure assessment: findings from a behavioral intervention study
43
 When comparing reported frequency from baseline to the
end of the week of their hand washing intervention, 16
women (50%) reported increases, nine (28.1%) reported
decreases, and seven (21.9%) reported no change in the
number of times they washed their hands per day during the
previous week. This does not consider duration or manner
of hand washing. Restricting analyses to participants who
complied with intervention protocol did not change the
direction or magnitude of results.
Discussion
This
is
the
first
study
to
assess
changes
in
flame
retardant exposure as the result of house cleaning and
hand washing practices. The results of our case-crossover
design support the hypothesis that hand washing and
house cleaning can reduce exposure to some, though not all,
flame retardants measured through dermal exposure and
urinary metabolites. In hand wipes, reductions in exposure
were only found in those individuals with exposure above the
median at baseline, indicating that behavioral intervention
may not be effective for those with initially low exposure. In
urine samples, consistent, substantial reductions in exposure
across the majority of metabolites were found in the original,
unstratified sample, but an unexpected increase in DPHP, a
metabolite of TPHP, was found after week 2 of combined
exposure.
Baseline OPFR concentrations in hand wipes and meta-
bolites in urine were higher in our participants than in an
exposure assessment conducted on adults over the age of 18
in North Carolina [20]. Compared to a study on mother and
child pairs also in North Carolina, our mothers had higher
urinary levels of BCIPP, DPHP, ip-DPHP, and tbutyl-DPHP,
but lower levels of BDCIPP [25]. Our study also found higher
levels of BCIPP and DPHP, but lower levels of BCIPHIPP
and BDCIPP in mothers than a study of mothers and children
(between 2 and 70 months old) in California [48]. Participants
in the latter two studies were predominantly White, and pre-
vious studies have found higher body burdens of PBDEs
among non-White women compared to White women [44].
Thus, our observation of racial/ethnic differences in exposure
levels supports previous findings.
Recent studies have reported seasonal variation in urin-
ary OPFR metabolite concentrations, with highest levels
observed in the summer [49]. Our intervention took place
between December and May, and Hoffman et al. found
significant differences between levels of BDCIPP in the
winter and spring. While temporal differences may affect
the concentrations of urinary metabolites measured in our
study, they will not influence the percent change within an
individual, thus should not bias our results concerning the
effectiveness of the intervention.
Baseline exposure in our study was predicted by race/
ethnicity, time since last hand wash (in hand wipe samples
only), and hours spent at home. African American mothers
in our study had lower levels of OPFRs and BDE 209 than
Dominicans, though other studies have shown Dominicans
to have lower levels of summed PBDEs (children only),
BDE 209, and Alt-BFRs, presumably due to cultural dif-
ferences in cleaning practices [24]. Time outside the home,
in unspecified locations where women were working (thus,
not in control of the environment), predicted increased
OPFR and Alt-BFR exposure. The positive association
between time outside the home and flame retardant expo-
sure challenges the effectiveness of a house cleaning-based
intervention.
After 1 week of hand washing, we found significant
decreases in levels of BCIPP, BCIPHIPP, and tbutyl-DPHP
in urine samples. And while no decreases were found in
hand wipes from the entire study sample, hand washing
after week 1 in those highly exposed at baseline was sig-
nificantly associated with decreases in TCEP, TCIPP, and
ΣAlt-BFRs in hand wipes. Simulations corroborated results
for TCEP, but not for TCIPP or ΣAlt-BFRs, meaning that
TCEP levels were unlikely to have declined as a statistical
byproduct of regression. BCIPP and BCIPHIPP are both
metabolites of TCIPP [48], thus the significant findings in
parent compounds and in urinary metabolites support the
plausibility of the effectiveness of hand washing as pre-
ventative of TCIPP exposure. We did not measure meta-
bolites of TCEP or ΣAlt-BFRs in this study.
After 1 week of house cleaning, we found significant
decreases in levels of BCIPHIPP and ip-DPHP in urine
samples. Restricted to those above the median at baseline,
house cleaning after week 1 was significantly associated
with decreased BDE 209 in hand wipes, which was sup-
ported by simulations. TCIPP, the parent of BCIPHIPP, was
reduced, but not significantly, by house cleaning in this
study. Neither the parent of ip-DPHP nor a metabolite of
BDE 209 were measured.
After week 2 of combined interventions, we found sig-
nificant decreases in levels of BCIPHIPP and tbutyl-DPHP
and an unexpected significant increase in DPHP in
urine
samples.
Combined
house
cleaning
and
hand
washing
during
week
2
in
those
more
exposed
at
baseline was associated with lower levels of TDCIPP,
TPHP, and BDE 209 in hand wipes. Only the effect on BDE
209 was validated by simulations. TCIPP, the parent of
BCIPHIPP, and TDCIPP’s metabolite, BDCIPP, were
reduced, but not significantly, by combined interventions in
this study.
Results for TPHP and its metabolite DPHP appear con-
tradictory. Even stratified to those most exposed at baseline,
combined house cleaning and hand washing during week 2
led to a significant decrease in dermal TPHP exposure but

 an increase in urinary levels of DPHP. It is known that
chemicals other than TPHP (including monosubstituted
isopropylated triaryl phosphate (mono-ITP), 2-ethylhexyl
diphenyl phosphate (EHDPHP), and isodecyl diphenyl
phosphate (id-DPHP)) may metabolize to form DPHP [20].
Thus, it is possible that, though the intervention was
effective in reducing TPHP exposure, it unintentionally led
to increased exposure to one or more of the other possible
parent compounds of DPHP. Results for TCIPP and BCIPP,
while in the same direction, may differ in magnitude as
urinary levels of BCIPP are limited by the low formation
yield of BCIPP from TCIPP, as TCIPP has been shown to
be metabolized to a dechlorinated carboxylic acid metabo-
lite more often than to the dialkyl ester [25]. Effect of
intervention on all parent–metabolite pairs (TDCIPP and
BDCIPP, TPHP and DPHP, TCIPP and BCIPP, and TCIPP
and BCIPHIPP) may disagree due to the limitation of the
spot urine sample. Since sample collection was not con-
ducted in a standardized way, rather at the convenience of
study participants, disagreement may also reflect unmea-
sured behaviors and not differences in the effectiveness of
the intervention.
It is possible to conceive of time spent at home as an
effect modifier instead of a confounder, as a cleaning
intervention to reduce flame retardant exposure may be
more effective for individuals who spend more time at
home. Unfortunately, we did not have the statistical power
to evaluate this scenario. Examination of models stratified
by more/less time spent at home did not suggest a difference
in the effect of the intervention.
Limitations of this study include its small sample size,
generalizability of the cohort, multiple comparisons, and the
imperfections of spot urine samples. Because of our small
sample
size,
we
cannot
rule
out
chance
findings
despite statistical significance of our effect estimates. The
intervention’s case-crossover design, however, where indi-
viduals act as their own controls, removes the possible time-
invariant confounding factors of cross-sectional studies.
Additionally, the small sample size allowed for more robust
data collection, including hand wipes, urine samples,
detailed questionnaires, wristbands (included in a compa-
nion article), and house dust (not included in the present
analysis). Generalizability from this sample to the U.S.
population is limited because of the purposeful sampling of
African American and Dominican families. As minority
residents of urban environments face a disproportionate
burden from environmental toxicants, participants from the
Sibling-Hermanos cohort were intentionally selected to
address concerns relevant to minority health and living
conditions. We analyzed seven flame retardants in hand
wipes and six metabolites in urine, begging the question of
multiple comparisons. In this regard, we looked for con-
sistency in magnitude and direction of effect estimates.
Finally, spot urine samples, which do not account for intra-
individual variations in analyte levels, were used to analyze
OPFR metabolites. We unfortunately do not have infor-
mation about the length of time spent at home prior to
sample collection, which would better characterize expo-
sure. Since OPFRs have short half-lives, spot urine samples
may have introduced outcome misclassification. However,
this misclassification of metabolite level would be random
and not associated with exposure (i.e., intervention arm),
and thus, would be non-differential, biasing our results
toward the null.

Flame retardant exposure assessment: findings from a behavioral intervention study
45
 Though neither intervention arm nor combined hand
washing and house cleaning led to a reduction across all
flame retardants, four of the six urinary metabolites mea-
sured (all but BDCIPP and DPHP) decreased (at least
marginally) significantly after week 1 or week 2. In parti-
cipants above the median at baseline, six of the seven flame
retardants measured (all but ΣBDE) decreased after week 1
or week 2. The simulations show that reductions in TCEP
and BDE 209 were unlikely to be byproducts of regression
to the mean. These results imply that both hand washing
and house cleaning can be effective methods of exposure
reduction to flame retardants. This evidence supports the
EPA’s recommendations of house cleaning and hand
washing, with the qualification that a substantial proportion
of our participants’ exposure came from outside the home,
where cleaning may not be an option for exposure
mitigation.
This intervention took place over the course of 2 weeks,
requiring a sustained behavioral change over the course of
the study. Twenty-two of the 32 mothers reported that their
(and their children’s) hand washing behavior did, in fact,
change as a result of the intervention, while 20 mothers
reported vacuuming more often. After 2 weeks with the
addition of the second intervention, there is a possibility that
participants could not maintain the study’s recommenda-
tions. In addition, exposure likely occurs in places other
than the home, such as places of work and transportation
modalities where increased cleaning might also be effective
in reducing exposure. However, while hand washing is not
specific to the home, individuals may or may not be able to
control the cleanliness of the work places or transit meth-
ods. This study does not address how much individuals
need to clean their homes or wash their hands to make a
difference with regard to flame retardant exposure. As a
sustained behavioral change is difficult, it is necessary to
give practical and achievable recommendations.
Conclusion
One week of increased hand washing or targeted house
cleaning is enough, in some cases, to reduce exposure to
flame retardants by half. Results of this study suggest that
behavioral interventions can significantly decrease exposure
levels of some, but not all, flame retardants. None of the
reported flame retardants were reduced below the MDL,
indicating that individual behavior cannot entirely mitigate
exposure. As participants faced additional exposure outside
the home, house cleaning and hand washing can help to
reduce, but not eliminate, exposure to flame retardants.
