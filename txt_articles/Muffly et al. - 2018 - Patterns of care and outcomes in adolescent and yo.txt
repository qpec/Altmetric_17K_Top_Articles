Key Points
• Two-thirds of AYA ALL
are treated in the
adult cancer setting;
one-quarter of AYAs in
this setting receive
front-line pediatric ALL
therapy.
• Survival was superior
for AYA ALL patients
treated in pediatric
cancer settings and in
NCI-designated cancer
centers.
Adolescents and young adults (AYAs, 15-39 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) represent a heterogeneous population who receive care in pediatric or adult cancer
settings. Using the California Cancer Registry, we describe AYA ALL patterns of care and
outcomes over the past decade. Sociodemographics, treatment location, and front-line
therapies administered to AYAs diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 were obtained.
Cox regression models evaluated associations between ALL setting and regimen and overall
survival (OS) and leukemia-specific survival (LSS) for the entire cohort, younger AYA
(,25 years), and AYAs treated in the adult cancer setting only. Of 1473 cases, 67.7% were
treated in an adult setting; of these, 24.8% received a pediatric ALL regimen and 40.7% were
treated at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)–designated center. In multivariable analyses,
front-line treatment in a pediatric (vs adult) setting (OS HR 5 0.53, 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.37-0.76; LSS HR 5 0.51, 95% CI, 0.35-0.74) and at an NCI/Children’s Oncology
Group (COG) center (OS HR 5 0.80, 95% CI, 0.66-0.96; LSS HR 5 0.80, 95% CI, 0.65-0.97)
were associated with significantly superior survival. Results were similar when analyses
were limited to younger AYAs. Outcomes for AYAs treated in an adult setting did not differ
following front-line pediatric or adult ALL regimens. Our population-level findings
demonstrate that two-thirds of AYAs with newly diagnosed ALL are treated in an adult
cancer setting, with the majority receiving care in community settings. Given the potential
survival benefits, front-line treatment of AYA ALL at pediatric and/or NCI/COG-designated
cancer centers should be considered.
Introduction
Since the publication of retrospective cancer cooperative group studies demonstrating a survival benefit
for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) treated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
regimens delivered by pediatric oncologists vs adult ALL regimens administered by medical
oncologists,1-5 much attention has been given to the type and location of treatment of AYA ALL.
Defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as patients diagnosed with cancer between the ages of
15 and 39 years,6 AYAs are a growing proportion of the ALL population such that it is projected
that .1300 AYAs will be diagnosed with ALL in 2018 in the United States.7
Prospective clinical trials have confirmed both the feasibility and encouraging outcomes associated with
the use of pediatric ALL regimens in the adult medical oncology setting.8-14 In the United States, the

From 
 Intergroup C10403 prospective clinical trial demonstrated that a
complex pediatric ALL chemotherapy regimen could be administered
by medical oncologists in the adult medical setting with successful
outcomes.9,15 Similar clinical trials conducted by cancer cooperative
groups across Europe demonstrated comparable results to C10403,
with overall survival (OS) exceeding 60% at 3 to 5 years.10,12,13
A substantial obstacle facing AYAs with ALL remains that they are
often caught in the gap between pediatric and adult cancer care, with
treatment at an adult or a pediatric cancer resulting from referral
patterns, hospital guidelines, or just plain chance. Similarly, if treated at
an adult center, an AYA ALL patient may receive a pediatric or adult
ALL regimen. Despite a multitude of review articles, society guidelines,
and AYA cancer resources championing the pediatric approach,16-18
it is not clear whether AYA ALL patients are increasingly being cared
for at pediatric centers or whether pediatric regimens have been
universally applied to AYA ALL patients treated in the adult cancer
community. To address these gaps in knowledge, we conducted an
observational, population-based study of AYAs with newly diagnosed
ALL between 2004 and 2014 across the state of California. Using data
abstracted from the California Cancer Registry (CCR), we describe
front-line ALL regimens received by AYAs in a variety of cancer settings
and evaluate associations among treatment setting, ALL regimen, and
survival. These data are intended to complement clinical trial findings
conducted primarily in research centers and to provide a “real-world”
evaluation of AYA ALL care and outcomes in the modern era.
Methods
Case ascertainment and data collection
The study population consisted of all California residents with newly
diagnosed ALL (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
3rd ed,19 codes 9826, 9835, 9836, 9811-9818, and 9837 per
NCI Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results [SEER] AYA
site recode), aged 15 to 39 years at time of diagnosis between 1
January 2004 and 31 December 2014. Data were abstracted from
the CCR, California’s population-based cancer surveillance system
that comprises 4 SEER cancer registries and captures approximately
99% of new cancer cases statewide (www.ccrcal.org). Patient and
tumor characteristics were obtained from CCR data routinely
collected for the registry via medical records, including age at
diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, health insurance status at the time of
initial diagnosis or treatment, and a previously developed composite
measure of neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) that
incorporates census block group level data on income, education,
housing costs, and employment.20,21 Underlying cause of death was
determined from death certificates. Patients were assigned to
statewide nSES quintiles based on their address at time of diagnosis.
Approval for human subjects research was granted by the
institutional review board of the Cancer Prevention Institute of
California and the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects
for the California Health and Human Services Agency. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Facility-level information
We reviewed all available CCR facility-level reports for each patient
following methodologies previously described.22 The facility where
the initial ALL treatment regimen was administered was designated
as either a pediatric or adult hospital (“treatment setting”). Pediatric
centers were identified using a list of Children’s Oncology Group
(COG) pediatric cancer centers23 and children’s hospitals24 across
California. Patients treated at institutions that that do not report
cancer cases from their pediatric and adult hospitals separately
were identified as treated in a pediatric setting only if the treating
physician was a pediatric oncologist; if no information on treating
physician was available, treatment setting was considered un-
known. Hospitals were classified by their affiliation with an NCI-
designated cancer center (CC)25; affiliation as a COG center was
taken into account for patients treated in pediatric settings only.
Data text fields were abstracted to identify ALL chemotherapy
regimens administered and individual records were reviewed to assign
the treatment facility associated with front-line ALL regimen adminis-
tration. Treatment regimens were categorized as either adult or
pediatric/pediatric-inspired ALL regimens (supplemental Table 1).
Based on previous work and clinical input, every ALL regimen
administered in the pediatric setting was considered a pediatric ALL
regimen.22 Missing or unclear data were coded as unknown. A facility
initially administering a single agent (such as steroids or hydroxyurea)
was not considered the treating facility if a patient was subsequently
transferred elsewhere to begin front-line ALL therapy.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) characterized
baseline patient, hospital, and treatment characteristics by treat-
ment setting. Differences in these characteristics between pediatric
and adult treatment settings were evaluated using x2 and Fisher’s
exact test. Logistic regression models were used to obtain the odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the factors
associated with receipt of a pediatric-inspired ALL regimen in the
adult treatment setting, adjusting for clustering by facility. Variables
significant at P , .10 in the univariable model were included in the
final multivariable model.
The association of treatment setting (pediatric vs adult) with both OS
and leukemia-specific survival (LSS) was assessed using Cox pro-
portional hazards regression for AYAs of all ages and for those 15 to 24
years of age because of the superior outcomes and variability in pediatric
vs adult treatment setting in these younger AYAs. Cox proportional
hazards regression was also used to explore the association of ALL
regimen type (pediatric-inspired vs adult) with overall and LSS in the
adult ALL treatment setting after 2008 (pediatric ALL regimens were
used infrequently in the adult treatment setting before this time).
Proportional hazards assumptions were tested using Schoenfeld
residuals. In the model of AYAs treated in the adult setting (2009-
2014), age violated the proportional hazards assumption and was
included as a stratification variable, allowing baseline hazards to vary by
age. No evidence of significant multicollinearity was found using the
variance inflation factor. Survival time was calculated from the date of
diagnosis to the date of death or last known vital status. Vital status data
were complete through December 31, 2014; any patient alive at this
date was censored. For LSS analyses, patients who died of a cause
other than leukemia were censored on the date of death. Patients with
incomplete dates of diagnosis or follow-up for whom we could not
calculate survival time (N 5 33) were excluded from survival analyses. All
multivariable models were adjusted for age and sex. Additional covariates
considered for inclusion in the multivariable models were race/ethnicity,
health insurance, nSES, NCI-designated CC/COG status of treating
facility, and year of diagnosis. In the model limited to AYA treated in the
adult setting, NCI/COG center status and type of induction protocol
were selected for inclusion a priori because the effects of these variables

 were of primary interest. Using backward selection, any additional
variables significant at P , .10 were retained in all the final models.
Results are reported in hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. Statistical
analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (Cary, NC).
Results
AYA patient and treatment setting characteristics
A total of 1795 AYA patients with newly diagnosed ALL were
diagnosed and reported to the CCR between 1 January 2004 and
31 December 2014. Five cases were excluded because of multiple
leukemia diagnoses and 30 cases were excluded because they
were found to have been miscoded as ALL. Cases were also
excluded if missing essential data for characterization of treatment
or treatment setting (N 5 270) or if death occurred before
administration of any therapy (N 5 17), resulting in a total of 1473
AYAs with ALL included in the analyses.
Patient and treatment setting characteristics are detailed in Table 1.
The median age at diagnosis was 22 years; 32.3% were 15 to 18 and
56.8% were ,25 years. Two-thirds of the study population was male
and 63.7% were of Hispanic race/ethnicity. The majority of patients
had public insurance (47.2%; including Medicaid/Medicare) or

From 
 private insurance (43.1%). Most (67.7%) patients were treated in an
adult cancer setting. The proportion of AYAs treated in a pediatric
setting increased significantly over the study period, from 27.3% from
2004 through 2007 to 34.9% from 2012 through 2014 (P 5 .002).
Treatment setting differed significantly by age, with 86.9% and
16.0% of AYA aged 15 through 18 and 19 through 24 years,
respectively, treated in a pediatric setting, and .98% of AYA aged
25 through 39 years treated in an adult setting (P , .001). The
proportion of public and private insurance holders was similar
between AYA treated in a pediatric vs adult setting (P 5 .384).
Across the total cohort, 56.2% received their initial ALL regimen at
either an NCI CC or COG center. Among the 43.7% of AYAs who
did not receive care at either an NCI-CC or COG center, a
significantly higher proportion of AYAs were treated in an adult vs
pediatric setting (59.3% vs 11.1%, P , .001) (Table 1).
Treatment regimens applied to AYA ALL across adult
treatment settings
Of those treated in an adult setting, 24.8% of AYAs received a
pediatric ALL regimen (Table 2). The administration of pediatric ALL
regimens to AYAs treated in adult settings increased over time from
10.3% between 2004 and 2007 to 34.7% between 2012 and
2014 (P , .001). Factors associated with receipt of a pediatric ALL
regimen in an adult setting include younger age (P 5 .007),
treatment at an NCI CC (P , .001), residence in low SES
neighborhoods (P 5 .015), and diagnosis in a more recent year
(P , .001) (supplemental Table 2).
OS and LSS
For the total cohort of AYAs, the median follow-up for alive patients was
3.5 years (range, 0-10.9 years) and the 3-year OS and LSS were
61.8% (95% CI, 58.9-64.5) and 66.4% (95% CI, 63.5-69.1),
respectively. In multivariable adjusted models, treatment of AYA ALL
patients in a pediatric (vs adult) setting was associated with significantly
higher overall (HR 5 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76) and leukemia-specific
(HR 5 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35-0.74) survival (Table 3; supplemental
Figure 1). Similarly, treatment of AYA ALL at an NCI CC/COG center
was associated with significantly higher overall (HR 5 0.80; 95% CI,
0.66-0.96) and leukemia-specific (HR 5 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97)
survival. AYA ALL patients of Hispanic (OS: HR 5 1.64; 95% CI, 1.30-
2.06; LSS: HR 5 1.76, 95% CI, 1.39-2.24) or African American race/
ethnicity (overall survival: HR 5 2.07; 95% CI, 1.28-3.35, LSS:
HR 5 2.01; 95% CI, 1.19-3.39) experienced lower survival than
non-Hispanic white AYAs (Table 3). Results were similar when
analyses were limited to younger AYAs, 15 to 24 years of age
(Table 4; supplemental Figure 1).
Among AYAs treated in the adult treatment setting only between
2009 and 2014, receipt of a pediatric (vs adult) ALL regimen was
not associated with OS or LSS (Table 5; supplemental Figure 1).
Similarly, there was no significant difference in OS (HR, 0.83; 95%
CI, 0.58-1.20) or LSS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.66-1.47) among AYA
receiving “hyper cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, Adriamycin,
and dexamethasone” as opposed to pediatric ALL regimens.
Consistent with prior analyses, Hispanics experienced worse
survival (OS: HR 5 1.82, 95% CI 1.22-2.74; LSS: HR 5 2.10;
95% CI, 1.31-3.35) than non-Hispanic white AYA with ALL, and
treatment at an NCI CC was nonsignificantly associated with better
LSS (HR 5 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.07). Results were similar when
analyses were limited to younger AYAs, 15 to 24 years of age,
treated in the adult setting (data not shown).
Discussion
In the current study of 1473 newly diagnosed AYA ALL patients in
California from 2004 through 2014, we found a significant survival
advantage for AYAs with ALL treated in a pediatric, as opposed to
an adult cancer setting, as well as for AYA ALL patients cared for at

From 
 NCI CC/COG centers. This study was based on population data
enhanced with a previously piloted method of abstracting ALL
treatment setting and chemotherapy regimen data from cancer
registry free-text fields.22 We show that two-thirds of AYAs with
newly diagnosed ALL are treated in an adult cancer setting, of
which approximately 60% are community-based centers, and that
as of 2014, only 33% of AYAs treated in an adult cancer setting
received a pediatric-inspired ALL regimen. Our population-based
findings complement those of prospective clinical trials by providing
a “real-world” analysis of AYA ALL and identifying concerning gaps
in patient management and outcomes that may be improved upon
through educational, practice, and/or policy interventions.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that the majority (87%) of AYAs
aged 15 to 18 years were treated in a pediatric cancer setting,
whereas nearly 100% of AYAs age $25 years were treated in an
adult cancer setting. Nineteen- to 24-year-old AYAs were more
commonly treated in an adult setting throughout the decade, but
over time a shift occurred such that ALL patients in this age group
were increasingly treated in a pediatric setting, up to 27.8% between
2012 and 2014. Regardless, in multivariable analyses taking into
account age, we found that in AYAs #25 years, treatment in a
pediatric cancer setting was associated with superior OS and LSS. As
best as we could discern, our observations do not appear to be due to
the pediatric regimen alone because pediatric vs adult regimen in the
adult setting was not a significant predictor of outcome in AYA of all
ages in our study. Instead, our observations may have resulted from
unmeasured factors that have been shown to favor the pediatric setting
such as minimal residual disease-driven ALL treatment algorithms,26
greater clinical trial enrollment,27,28 and improved therapeutic adher-
ence.29 Our data highlight that referral of younger AYAs, up to at least
age 25 years, to pediatric centers for ALL management should be
strongly considered.
The association between management of AYA and adult cancer
patients in NCI CC/COG centers and superior outcomes has been
previously shown in population studies using data from local/regional
cancer registries.30-32 Our data confirm a striking difference in
whether AYAs are treated at an NCI CC/COG center based upon
adult or pediatric cancer setting of care, with 88.9% and 40.6% of
AYA treated in a pediatric vs adult setting receiving care at an NCI
CC/COG center, respectively. NCI-designated CC status is granted
based upon recognition of scientific leadership, resources, and the
depth and breadth of research in basic, clinical, and/or population
science.25 Similarly, in the pediatric cancer setting, COG center
member institutions are expected to adhere to COG’s conduct of
clinical research responsibilities and performance requirements.33
Given that ALL represents just 0.4% of all newly diagnosed
cancers,34 and a tiny fraction of all cancers treated in the adult
cancer setting, it is perhaps anticipated that outcomes of this rare
malignancy are likely superior at centers with greater expertise and
infrastructure to incorporate research and comprehensive leukemia

 care. The results of our study and others demonstrating the
importance of NCI CC/COG centers to improving AYA ALL
outcomes warrant further attention in the development of systematic
quality metrics and improving access to specialty care in this
vulnerable population.
Our findings demonstrate that over the past decade, only 25%
of AYAs with ALL treated in an adult cancer setting received a
pediatric ALL regimen as front-line therapy. Receiving a diagnosis of
ALL in more recent years and treatment at an NCI CC were
associated with receipt of a pediatric ALL regimen in the adult

From 
 setting, yet even as recently as 2014, only one-third of AYAs were
receiving pediatric-inspired therapy. This is striking, given that
concurrent outcome comparisons of pediatric and adult treatment
regimens performed in 10 countries as well as a large meta-analysis
have demonstrated superiority of the pediatric regimen for young
adults with ALL.7,35
In the current analyses, our ability to evaluate the long-term survival
benefit of pediatric ALL regimens delivered in an adult cancer setting
was limited by short median follow-up time (median follow-up of 2.3
years for surviving patients), in addition to our inability to reliably track
sequential therapies (such as hematopoietic cell transplantation) and
their influence on outcomes. This is an important limitation given that
the large Medical Research Council/Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group ALL study was reported during this time and demonstrated
improved outcomes with consolidative hematopoietic cell transplanta-
tion for young adults with standard-risk ALL who achieved first
remission with front-line adult ALL therapy.36 The pediatric approach
administered in the adult ALL setting has not been compared with
traditional adult ALL regimens in a randomized fashion, and, because of
the complexity and ethical constraints of such a study design, this is
unlikely to be feasible. Although the pediatric approach appears
superior in nearly all retrospective cooperative group studies and in
single-arm phase 2 prospective studies, a large US single-center report
showed equivalent survival between the pediatric approach and an
optimized adult ALL regimen in young adults with ALL.14 Estimates of
the long-term impact of pediatric ALL regimens administered by
medical oncologists will require mature clinical trial results and future
assessments of population-level data.
AYAs of Hispanic and African American race/ethnicity experienced
worse OS and LSS relative to non-Hispanic white AYAs. Several
studies in childhood ALL have reported inferior outcomes in Hispanic
populations, likely, in part, due to a higher reported frequency of adverse
biological risk variants, such as alterations in CRLF2, found in Hispanic
and African American ALL populations that confer adverse leukemic
risk.37-39 Additional factors, such as clinical trial enrollment, adherence
to therapy, and access to specialized care have also been shown to
contribute to disparities in ALL outcomes among racial/ethnic
groups.29,31,40-42 Interestingly, we did find that there were significant
differences in ALL regimens received based upon race/ethnicity; for
example, C10403 was not administered to any non-Hispanic African
American AYA in our sample. These findings warrant attention and
focused interventions in order to narrow health outcome disparities as
the US population continues to grow and diversify.
Population-based cancer registries, such as the CCR, provide invalu-
able data on cancer epidemiology and outcomes across the population
that may not be gleaned from clinical trials or single-center reports and
lack the associated selection biases.43 In addition to basic de-
mographic, cancer type, and survival information, we were able to
enrich our report on this AYA ALL cohort through detailed examination,
first applying a text mining approach and then an individual record
review, of facility-level reporting, yielding granular data on treatment
setting and front-line ALL chemotherapy regimen administered.
However, the CCR and other SEER registries lack important disease-
specific information (such as ALL cytogenetic and molecular risk),
detailed treatment data beyond front-line therapy, and critical treatment
response metrics such as minimal residual disease. Further, we were
unable to characterize differences in treatment toxicities between
regimens, as well as therapeutic adherence, an area of heightened
importance in the AYA population. Future population-science research
incorporating detailed clinical, treatment, and patient-reported informa-
tion, perhaps through comprehensive database development or
database linkages, will be essential to improving access to optimal
care and improving outcomes across the entire population of AYA ALL.
In summary, our data demonstrate a significant survival advantage
for AYA ALL associated with treatment in a pediatric, as opposed to
an adult cancer setting, suggesting that referral of younger AYAs,
up to at least age 25 years, to pediatric centers for ALL
management should be strongly considered. The results of our
study and others demonstrate the importance of NCI CC/COG
centers to improving AYA ALL outcomes and warrant further
attention as only a minority of AYA ALL treated in the adult setting is
cared for at these centers. Given the relatively recent adoption of
pediatric ALL regimens by medical oncologists, mature population-
level data are needed to better quantify the evolving impact of
pediatric ALL regimens administered by medical oncologists in
adult cancer settings.
