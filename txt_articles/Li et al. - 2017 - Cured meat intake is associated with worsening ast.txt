ABSTRACT
Background Cured meat intake—a recent
carcinogenic factor—may increase the risk of COPD, but
its association with asthma remains unknown. Though
body mass index (BMI) is a likely risk factor for asthma,
its role in the diet–asthma association as a mediator has
never been studied. We investigated the association
between cured meat intake and worsening asthma
symptoms in adults, and the role of BMI as a potential
mediator.
Methods Using data from the French prospective EGEA
study (baseline: 2003–2007; follow-up: 2011–2013),
we applied a mediation analysis in the counterfactual
framework, a marginal structural model (MSM), to
estimate the direct effect of baseline cured meat intake
(<1, 1–3.9, ≥4 servings/week) on change in asthma
symptom score (worsening or not), and the indirect
effect mediated by BMI.
Results Among the 971 participants (mean age
43 years; 49% men; 42% with asthma), 20% reported
worsening asthma symptoms during the mean follow-up
time of 7 years. Using the MSM, we reported a positive
direct effect of cured meat intake on worsening asthma
symptoms (multivariable OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.06
for ≥4 vs <1 serving/week). We also reported an
indirect effect mediated by BMI (OR=1.07; 95% CI 1.01
to 1.14), accounting for 14% of the total effect.
Conclusions Higher cured meat intake was associated
with worsening asthma symptoms over time, through a
direct effect and to a lesser extent an effect mediated by
BMI. This research extends the effect of diet on asthma
in adults.
INTRODUCTION
Cured meat,
an important
component of the
Western diet, has recently been classified as car-
cinogenic by WHO.1 High cured meat intake is a
risk factor not only for cancer,2 but also for
several chronic diseases3 4 and all-cause mortal-
ity.3 The deleterious health effects of high cured
meat intake have been increasingly observed.
Regarding
lung
health,
frequent
cured
meat
intake
is
associated
with
lung
cancer,2

6
decreased lung function7
8 and COPD symp-
toms,6
7 exacerbations9 or incidence.10
11 As
cured meat is known for its high-nitrite content12
which
may
lead
to
nitrosative
stress
related
airway
inflammation—one
of
the
several
physiological processes involved in asthma,13 it is
reasonable to posit that cured meat intake is an
independent
risk
factor
for
asthma.
To
our
knowledge, only two studies—both performed in
the
USA—have
investigated
the
association
between
cured
meat
intake
and
the
risk
of
adult-onset asthma, and they reported no signifi-
cant association after adjustment for body mass
index (BMI) and other confounders.10 11
Since obesity is a likely risk factor for incidence
and exacerbations14–16 of asthma, one challenge
when investigating the association between diet and
asthma is to properly account for BMI. As diet
affects BMI, it is plausible that BMI lies in the
causal pathway between diet and asthma.17 Thus
the classical way, in which we consider BMI as a
confounder in the analysis and adjust for BMI, may
over adjust the diet–asthma association due to the
likely mediating role of BMI.17 18 Recently, medi-
ation analyses in the counterfactual framework
have been proposed to disentangle direct and indir-
ect effects.19–21
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Is high cured meat intake, a risk factor for
several diseases, associated with worsening
asthma symptoms in adults? Does body mass
index (BMI) act as a mediator in this
association?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Correctly accounting for the BMI as a mediator,
this paper shows that high cured meat intake
was associated with worsening asthma
symptoms over time, through a direct effect
and to a lesser extent an effect mediated by
BMI.
Why read on?
▸ This paper is not only the first prospective
study on the association between cured meat
intake and asthma symptoms, it is also the first
application of newly developed methods to
estimate the role of BMI as a mediator in the
diet–asthma association.

 Asthma is a complex disease, with strong clinical phenotypic
heterogeneity and temporal phenotypic variability. Whereas the
doctor-diagnosed incidence of asthma is widely used, there have
been increasing concerns about its limitations, particularly due
to the dichotomous assumption of asthma.22 Recently, an
asthma symptom score has been proposed to study risk factors
for asthma in longitudinal studies.23 24 Being a multi-categorical
measure, the score provides more power to detect risk factors
for asthma incidence and asthma control.23 24 Moreover, the
asthma symptom score detects the change in asthma symptoms
over time, reflecting either asthma incidence, or captures the
temporal variability of the disease among participants with
asthma—remission, relapse or persistence.23 Given that previous
studies showed weak association between dietary factors and
adult-onset asthma incidence,25 the asthma symptom score
might be particularly relevant to studying the role of dietary
factors as an aetiological risk factor and as a disease modifier.26
In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association
between cured meat intake and the change in asthma symptom
score in a French prospective study of adults, and to assess the
role of BMI as a mediator using a counterfactual approach to
mediation analysis.
METHODS
Study sample
The EGEA study (Epidemiological study on the Genetics and
Environment of Asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and
atopy) is a longitudinal study with an initial group of asthma
cases, their first-degree relatives, and a group of controls, fol-
lowed up over 20 years (https://egeanet.vjf.inserm.fr/index.php/
fr/). Protocol and descriptive characteristics of the EGEA study
have been previously published.27 28 Briefly, 2047 participants
from five cities in France were enrolled between 1991 and
1995. Between 2003 and 2007, this population was contacted
for the second survey (EGEA2). Out of 2002 participants alive,
1845 completed a short self-administered questionnaire and
1601 had a complete medical examination (among whom 715
(42%) ever had asthma). As a follow-up study of EGEA2, the
third survey (EGEA3) was performed between 2011 and 2013
using a self-completed questionnaire, and 1558 questionnaires
were returned.
Since diet was measured at EGEA2 only, we used data col-
lected at EGEA2 as baseline and EGEA3 as the follow-up. Out
of
the
1601
participants
from
EGEA2,
35
adolescents
(<16 years old) were first excluded. Among adults (n=1566),
we excluded 330 participants who did not complete the food
frequency questionnaire, had an inadequate assessment of diet,
or had an implausibly high or low total energy intake.29 T
en
participants with missing data for the asthma symptom score
were further excluded. Among the 1226 remaining, 185 (15%)
were lost to follow-up; compared with participants lost to
follow-up (n=185), participants followed at EGEA3 (n=1041)
were less likely to be men or smokers, and were similar regard-
ing age, BMI, educational level, physical activity and asthma
status (see online supplementary table S1). After excluding 70
participants out of 1041 with missing data for the asthma
symptom score assessed at EGEA3, the final study sample
included 971 participants (figure 1).
Among adults, excluded participants (n=595) were similar
compared with participants included in the analysis (n=971)
regarding age, BMI, physical activity, sex, smoking and asthma
status, but they were more likely to have a lower educational
level (see online supplementary table S2).
Ethical approval was obtained from the relevant institutional
review board committees (Cochin Port-Royal Hospital and
Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris). All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Dietary intakes
At EGEA2, we used a 118-item food frequency questionnaire
based on a French validated dietary questionnaire30 to assess
average dietary intakes during the previous 12 months. These
118 items were grouped into 46 food groups and average intake
was calculated for each group.29 The French food composition
table from the SU.VI.MAX survey was used to calculate the
nutrient intakes and total energy intake (kcal/day).31 The cured
meat group included three items: ham (2 slices/portion), sausage
(1/portion) and dried sausage (2 slices/portion). According to
the distribution of cured meat intake, exposure was categorised
in three classes: <1 serving/week (lowest; 19%), 1–3.9 servings/
week (medium; 48%) and ≥4 servings/week (highest; 33%).
The group with the lowest intake was considered as ‘non-
exposed’ and was taken as the reference group.
To account for the overall remaining effect of diet in the
cured meat–asthma association, analyses were adjusted for
dietary patterns derived from all food groups except cured
meat. In the EGEA study, two dietary patterns were previously
identified using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the 46
food groups: (1) a prudent pattern characterised by a high
intake of vegetables, fruits, oils, whole grain cereals and fish;
and (2) a W
estern pattern loaded by a high consumption of pre-
pared meals, French fries, cured meat, condiments, alcohol,
beer/cider, sandwiches and potatoes.29 In the current analysis,
we derived a ‘modified W
estern pattern’ and a prudent pattern
using CFA on 45 food groups (all food groups except cured
meat, see online supplementary table S3). The individual scores
obtained from CFA for the two dietary patterns were used as
potential confounders in the analysis.
Asthma symptom score
The asthma symptom score has been proposed as a continuous
measure to study risk factors for asthma in longitudinal studies.
Compared with a dichotomous definition of asthma, increased
power in the analysis identifying risk factors was suggested
when using the asthma symptoms score.23
24 In the EGEA
study, the asthma symptom score was calculated both at EGEA2
and EGEA3. Ranging from 0 to 5, the score is based on the
number of respiratory symptoms during the past 12 months
reported in the questionnaire: (1) breathless while wheezing; (2)
woken up with chest tightness; (3) attack of shortness of breath
at rest; (4) attack of shortness of breath after exercise; and (5)
woken by attack of shortness of breath. Change in asthma
symptom score was categorised as ‘stable or improved’ if
EGEA3 score–EGEA2 score ≤0, and ‘worsening’ if EGEA3
score–EGEA2 score >0.
Body mass index
W
eight and height of participants were measured at EGEA2.
BMI (kg/m2) at EGEA2 was calculated as weight/height2 and
was categorised into five classes: <22.5, 22.5–24.9, 25–27.4,
27.5–29.9, ≥30.
Other variables
Age, sex, smoking status (never and ever smoking), educational
level, and physical activity were assessed at baseline (EGEA2).
Educational level was categorised into two classes depending on
whether the participants had higher education (university or

 equivalent). Leisure-time physical activity was assessed in meta-
bolic equivalents per week (METs/w) taking into account a
variety of intensive activities (such as jogging, aerobic, swim-
ming, cycling, tennis, soccer, digging in the garden), moderate
activities (such as cleaning, walking, golf, slight gardening), and
light activities (such as reading, watching TV
, office work,
driving, eating). Average physical activity was estimated by
summing the product of average active time per week and the
metabolic equivalent value of each activity.
Due to the case-control design of the EGEA study, the study
population was enriched with participants with asthma. To take
into account this study design, ever asthma was considered as a
covariate in analysis. Ever asthma was defined by being recruited
as an asthma case in chest clinics at EGEA1 or responding posi-
tively to at least one of the two questions at EGEA1 or EGEA2:
(1) ‘Have you ever had attacks of breathlessness at rest with
wheezing?’ and (2) ‘Have you ever had asthma attacks?’ Never
asthma was defined by absence of asthma at EGEA1 and
EGEA2.
Statistical analysis
W
e used a direct acyclic graph to represent our mediation
model (figure 2). Age (continuous), sex, smoking status (never/
ever), educational level (low/high (ie, university or equivalent)),
leisure-time physical activity (expressed in metabolic equiva-
lents/week, continuous), dietary patterns, total daily energy
intake, and asthma status at EGEA2 were considered as potential
confounders.
Several methods with practical implementation have been
recently proposed to disentangle the natural direct and indirect
effects in the counterfactual framework.19–21 In the current ana-
lysis, we applied the marginal structural model proposed by
Lange and colleagues,20 which has been described as a simple
approach and can be implemented in standard software for
almost any variable type. Detailed implementation of this
method is described in the online supplementary methods. As
previously described,19
20 several conditions are required to
apply such methods, and we assumed that they were satisfied
(see online supplementary methods).
To evaluate how much of the total effect was due to the
effect of BMI, we calculated the ‘proportion explained’ by BMI
as (ORTE−ORNDE)/(ORTE−1), where ORTE and ORNDE were
respectively the OR of total effect and natural direct effect.32
The total effect was calculated as ORNDE×ORNIE, where ORNIE
denoted the natural indirect OR.
W
e tested potential interactions between cured meat intake
and BMI in the association with asthma.20 In addition, since
cured meat intake is usually higher in men than in women,33 34
and often associated with smoking habit,35 we conducted sensi-
tivity analyses stratified on sex and smoking status, and formally
tested interactions of cured meat intake with sex and smoking.
Furthermore, considering the case-control design of EGEA

 study, we also performed a stratified analysis on asthma status at
EGEA2.
As a sensibility analysis, we replicated our results using
another method of mediation analysis in the counterfactual
framework, a two-stage regression model, which provides esti-
mation of total effect and SEs using bootstrapped samples19 (see
online supplementary methods for details).
All analyses were performed using SAS V
.9.3 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
RESULTS
Description of population
The study sample was comprised of 971 participants. The mean
age was 43 years and 49% were men. At EGEA2, 42% partici-
pants had ever asthma, 51% were never smokers, 35% were
overweight and 9% were obese. The median cured meat intake
was 2.5 (Q1–Q3: 1.5–4.5) servings/week.
Baseline characteristics of the participants according to cured
meat intake are presented in table 1. Compared with partici-
pants with the lowest intake (<1 serving/week) of cured meat,
participants with the highest intake (≥4 serving/week) were
younger (p<0.001), more likely to be men (p<0.001) and
smokers (p=0.04), to report a higher total energy intake
(p<0.001), and to have ever asthma (p=0.03); as expected,
they also consumed more sodium (p<0.001) and saturated fat
(p<0.001). Besides, participants who had a higher intake of
cured meat were more likely to be in a higher BMI category
(p=0.01).
Cured meat intake and change in asthma symptom score
At EGEA3, after a mean follow-up time of 7 years (ranging
from 5 to 9 years), 513 participants (53%) reported the same
asthma symptom score as EGEA2 (stable), 191 (20%) reported
more symptoms (worsening), and 267 (27%) had fewer symp-
toms (improved). The proportion of participants with worsen-
ing asthma symptoms was 14%, 20% and 22% respectively
among those who ate <1, 1–3.9 and ≥4 servings/week of cured
meat (p for trend=0.04).
Results of mediation analyses using the marginal structural
model are presented in table 2. Among all the participants, after
adjustments for age, sex, smoking, educational level, physical
activity, dietary patterns, total energy intake, and asthma status,
we observed a positive direct effect of cured meat intake on
worsening asthma symptoms: the OR was 1.76 (95% CI 1.01 to

also reported a positive indirect effect mediated by BMI: the
adjusted OR was 1.07 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.14) when comparing
the highest to the lowest intake (figure 3). The percentage
mediated by BMI of the association was 14%. No interaction
was observed between cured meat intake and BMI (p for inter-
action=0.90) in the associations with asthma. W
e formally
tested interactions for total effect between cured meat intake
with sex (p for interaction=0.50), smoking status (p for inter-
action=0.60), and asthma status (p for interaction=0.50).
When we performed stratified analyses according to sex,
smoking, and asthma status, results were similar in all subgroups
(OR>1), although the power was limited (table 2).

counterfactual
framework

results
to
those

supplementary tables S5 and S6).
DISCUSSION
In this French prospective study of adults, using mediation ana-
lysis in the counterfactual framework, we reported a positive
association between high cured meat intake (≥4 serving/week)
and worsening asthma symptoms over time. While the indirect
effect mediated through BMI accounted for only 14% of this
association, the direct effect explained a greater proportion, sug-
gesting a deleterious role of cured meat independent of BMI.
Diet is highly influenced by culture as well as geographical,
environmental and socioeconomic factors. In our study, cured
meat food group included three typical French cured meats—
ham, sausages and dried sausage. The mean intakes of cured
meats in the EGEA study were similar to those reported by the
French National Individual Survey on Food Consumption
2006–2007.34 The EGEA results are in agreement with previous
researches indicating a harmful association between cured meat
intake and different measures of lung health in several countries,
where the types and preparation of cured meats may be differ-
ent.5–9 However, two large prospective American studies,10 11
with different types of cured meat (mainly bacon, hot dogs and
sausages), reported that cured meat intake may increase the risk
of newly diagnosed COPD, but not the risk of incident asthma,
after adjustment for BMI and other potential confounders. This
different finding may result from the role of BMI in the associ-
ation (confounder vs mediator) or the assessment of respiratory
phenotypes (incidence vs change in asthma symptoms).
In the present study, BMI was taken into account as a medi-
ator rather than a confounder. The modification of dietary
habits, the obesity epidemic, and the decrease in physical activ-
ity have been suggested to play a role in the increase of asthma
worldwide during the last decades.36 Overweight and obesity
reflect an imbalance between energy provision (ie, intake of cal-
ories) and expenditure (ie, physical activity), so the interrela-
tions between these factors make it difficult to disentangle their
separate roles on asthma, and to identify confounders and med-
iators in the diet–asthma association.17 To date, the adjustment
for BMI has been widely used when investigating the role of
nutritional factors in obesity-related diseases. Previous studies
have
consistently
suggested
a
dose-dependent
association
between BMI and the risk of asthma incidence and control,14–16
indicating that obesity is a likely mediator in the diet–asthma
association. The traditional BMI-adjusted method could over

 adjust the association and lead to biased results. Mediation ana-
lysis in the counterfactual framework allows taking into account
BMI correctly in such an association. Moreover, it provides a
quantitative measure of the proportion mediated through a
given mediator, which could help us to better understand the
observed association. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first application of newly developed methods for mediation ana-
lysis to estimate the association between cured meat intake and
asthma.
Accounting for BMI as a mediator, we reported an overall
positive association between high cured meat intake and wor-
sening asthma symptoms. The indirect effect mediated through
BMI accounted for only 14% of the total effect, supporting the
hypothesis that the cured meat–asthma association is related to
other mechanisms. Several potential mechanisms were proposed
by previous studies involving biological markers. First, cured
meats are rich in nitrite, which may lead to nitrosative stress13
and oxidative stress37 related lung damage and asthma. Second,
the positive relation between cured meat intake and C-reactive
protein38 indicated that cured meat might increase the systemic
inflammation, which may have an influence on asthma. In add-
ition, the high content of salt and saturated fat in cured meat
might also contribute in part to the association with asthma,
though existing evidence has been mainly for childhood-onset
asthma.39 Further studies need to be carried out to improve our
understanding regarding potential mechanistic processes.
Besides the BMI issue (mediator vs confounder), we have used,
unlike the previous studies,10
11 an asthma symptom score
instead of incident doctor-diagnosed adult-onset asthma. Studies
on incidence assume that the disease is a true dichotomous entity,
which might be inappropriate in asthma for several reasons: (1)
asthma is a complex disease, with strong clinical phenotypic het-
erogeneity and temporal phenotypic variability in both adults
and children;40 41 (2) asthma develops over a long period of time
with preclinical status difficult to define; and (3) asthma has a
low incidence in adults and different epidemiological definitions
of asthma exist. These characteristics of asthma might lead to
misclassification and biased association estimates.22 Without
making the dichotomous assumption of the asthma status, the
asthma symptom score captures temporal variability of asthma
and allows assessment of the disease progression in longitudinal
studies,23 and it is a more powerful tool to investigate risk factors
for asthma. Furthermore, the asthma symptom score was shown
to have increased specificity and positive predictive value com-
pared with self-report ever asthma or bronchial hyperresponsive-
ness;23 and the asthma symptom score at baseline has been
associated with markers of asthma but not those of COPD at
follow-up.24 In participants with asthma, worsening symptoms
capture relapse or exacerbation of the disease, and in participants
without asthma, worsening symptoms coincide with the asthma
incidence and activity. While the asthma symptom score was
developed and validated in a general population,23 24 our results
were obtained in a population among which 42% had ever
asthma. Although previous research has suggested that diet could
be a modifier of asthma control rather than an aetiological risk
factor for incidence of asthma,26 we did not observe interaction
between cured meat intake and asthma status at EGEA2 on the
association with worsening symptoms. The stratified analysis
according to asthma status at EGEA2 showed similar effects in
participants with ever asthma. Further studies are needed to
clarify potential differences related to asthma status in the effect
of cured meat intake on worsening asthma symptoms.
Because people consume complex meals rather than isolated
food/nutrients
that
might
interact
with
each
other,
the
association between cured meat intake itself and the asthma
symptom score is difficult to assess and may be partly due to the
confounding by other food groups.25 Therefore we adjusted the
associations for scores of dietary patterns. The total, direct and
indirect effects remained after adjustment for these dietary
scores. W
e acknowledge that findings might not be generalisable
to populations with completely different diet habits, such as
infrequent cured meat intake and very different food consump-
tions. The association between cured meat intake and the
asthma symptom score may also be due, in part, to a residual
confounding by cigarette smoking.42 To minimise this possibil-
ity, we performed a stratified analysis according to smoking
status
and
yielded
comparable
results
in
never
smokers,
although we faced a statistical power issue. Additionally, since
cured meat intake has been suggested as a risk factor for
COPD,10 11 the potential overlap between COPD and asthma
might contribute to the association between high cured meat
intake and asthma. Nevertheless, the overlap between COPD
and asthma is less likely in the current study because (1) com-
parable results were obtained among never smokers; (2) the
EGEA study was initiated as a case-control study of asthma with
cases
recruited
in
hospital,
with
childhood
asthma
and
adult-onset asthma;27 28 and (3) the use of the asthma symptom
score reduces the possibility of this overlap.24 W
e acknowledge
that our definition of ‘non-exposed’ group (<1 serving/week)
was not ideal. Due to the limited number of non-eaters of cured
meat in the EGEA study, we faced a statistical power issue in
subgroup analyses. W
e acknowledge that 15% of the partici-
pants were lost to follow-up. However, most of the character-
istics were similar among included and lost to follow-up
participants, except for sex and smoking status (as expected,
more men and more smokers were lost to follow-up). W
e also
acknowledge that a deterministic approach was used to deal
with missing data for asthma symptom score (7% participants).
Similar to any other observational study, however, we were able
to adjust for many potential confounders due to the extended
information available in our study; the validity of the results
relies on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding.43
Besides, we acknowledge that recall bias could exist as data from
questionnaires were used.
In summary, correctly accounting for BMI as a potential
mediator in the diet–asthma association, higher cured meat
intake was associated with worsening asthma symptoms over
time, not only through an indirect effect mediated by BMI but
also a greater direct effect. This research extends the deleterious
effect of cured meat in health, and the effect of diet on asthma
in adults, and provides a novel analytic approach regarding the
role of BMI in the diet–asthma association.
