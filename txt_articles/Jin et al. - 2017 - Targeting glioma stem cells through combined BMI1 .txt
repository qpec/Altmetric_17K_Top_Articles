 Glioblastomas are lethal cancers defined by angiogenesis and pseudopalisading necrosis. Here, we 
demonstrate that these histological features are associated with distinct transcriptional programs, 
with vascular regions showing a proneural profile and hypoxic regions a mesenchymal pattern. As 
these regions harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of these 
two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas mesenchymal GSCs in 
hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted cellular survival under stress, due to 
downregulation of the E3 ligase, RNF144A. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we 
found that proneural GSCs are preferentially sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas mesenchymal 
GSCs are preferentially sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both 
proneural and mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective 
than either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that simultaneously 
target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be necessary to overcome 
resistance to therapies caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.

Glioblastoma is the most prevalent and lethal primary brain tumor, with current therapies 
offering only palliation1. Glioblastomas represent one of the most rigorously characterized 
solid cancers, yet delineation of molecular lesions has not translated into effective targeted 
therapeutics. Glioblastomas display remarkable heterogeneity, both between tumors 
(intertumoral heterogeneity) and within tumors (intratumoral and cellular heterogeneity), 
supporting molecular and cellular complexity unlikely to respond to targeting single 
molecular pathways. Glioblastomas contain stem cell-like tumor initiating cells, GSCs (also 
known as cancer stem cells)2,3. Whereas GSCs remain controversial due to unresolved 
issues in their definition and origin, the significance of GSCs has been supported by 
observations that they promote resistance to conventional therapies, invasion into normal 
brain, and angiogenesis4–6. GSCs are not uniformly distributed within tumors, but rather 
enriched in perivascular and hypoxic niches, suggesting that GSCs critically interact with 
their microenvironment6–8. Indeed, microenvironmental stressors, such as hypoxia, acid, and 
nutrient restriction, promote GSC maintenance7,9,10.
Global transcript profiling and DNA methylation analyses from bulk adult glioblastoma 
samples have categorized glioblastoma into several distinct subtypes: glioma CpG island 
methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), associated with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 
2 (IDH1/2); non-G-CIMP proneural; classical or proliferative; and mesenchymal11. 
Genomic profiling has yet failed to guide precision medicine efforts for glioblastoma12, 
possibly because the tumors comprise cell populations with divergent subtype-specific gene 
expression13,14. Glioblastoma transcriptional groups are plastic, including proneural-to-
mesenchymal transition after cytotoxic therapy15,16. Nevertheless, tumor cells grown under 
stem cell conditions recapitulate the dominant subtype of parental tumor from which they 
were derived, suggesting retention of a cell intrinsic biology17,18. We hypothesized that the 
heterogeneous distribution of GSCs suggest that they reside in different niches, requiring 
differential therapeutic targeting of different subsets in the context of their specific niches.

 RESULTS
As bulk tumors contain cells from different subgroups13, we profiled expression patterns 
within specific tumor microenvironments by image-guided multiregional glioblastoma 
sampling (Fig. 1a). Tumor cells from the enhancing region (ER) expressed high levels of 
proneural genes, whereas the necrotic region (hypoxic; NR) expressed high levels of 
mesenchymal genes (Fig. 1b). An intermediate tumor region (enhanced margin, EM) 
displayed a mixed transcriptional signature comprising classical and proneural gene 
expression signatures (Fig. 1b). These findings were validated in two other multi-regional 
patient biopsies with glioblastoma subtype gene signatures (Supplementary Fig. 1). GSCs 
displayed regional variation, measured by immunofluorescence of each region using 
proneural GSC markers, SOX2 and OLIG2, and mesenchymal GSC markers, CD44 and 
YKL4016,19. GSCs in the ER, defined by disruption of the blood-brain barrier at areas of 
angiogenesis, were exclusively SOX2+ and OLIG2+, whereas NR GSCs exclusively CD44+ 
and YKL40+, indicating segregation of proneural and mesenchymal GSC markers (Fig. 1c). 
Gene expression profiling for vascular and hypoxic markers confirmed that proneural-
enriched cells were associated with vascular regions, and mesenchymal cells with hypoxia 
(Fig. 1d). Immunofluorescence staining using von Willebrand Factor (vWF) for vessels and 
carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) for hypoxia confirmed the regional variance of vascularity and 
hypoxia (Fig. 1e). To validate our observations in a larger tumor cohort, we interrogated the 
Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) database, which contains data from 55 
glioblastomas regionally microdissected with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (http://
glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org/). Confirming our findings from the MRI-guided biopsy 
results, the leading edge and infiltrating tumor regions expressed a proneural signature, 
whereas perinecrotic and microvascular proliferative regions expressed a mesenchymal 
signature (Fig. 1f–h).
Next, we constructed microenvironment-related gene signatures based on microarray data 
from vascular sources [human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human 
microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC)] and glioblastoma hypoxia vs. normoxia 
analyses20,21 (Supplementary Fig. 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b). Selected signatures and genes were 
analyzed in glioblastoma samples and the Ivy GAP database (Supplementary Fig. 2c, 2f, 2i, 
3c and 3f). In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) low-grade glioma-glioblastoma database, 
both vascular signatures and hypoxia were expressed in glioblastoma (Supplementary Fig. 
2d, 2g and 3d), and associated with tumor histology, grade, and defining molecular features 
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Proneural glioblastomas expressed markers of mature vessels, 
whereas mesenchymal glioblastomas expressed markers for microvasculature and 
hypoxia22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 2e, 2h, and 3e). Both vascular signatures and hypoxia 
were each significantly anti-correlated with patient survival (Supplementary Fig. 2j, 2k and 
3g). Patients with both vascularity and hypoxia expression patterns fared the worst 
(Supplementary Fig. 4b), supporting microvascular and hypoxic microenvironments as 
major predictors of unfavorable glioblastoma patient survival24,25. Our multi-regional 
patient biopsy samples validated these in silico observations, demonstrating that the regional 
variation in transcriptional signatures correlated with vascular and hypoxic features 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c and 4d).

 Regional transcriptional variation may reflect differential chromatin regulation. Polycomb 
repressive complexes (PRCs) comprise major chromatin modifiers of epigenetic regulation 
of global gene expression. PRC1 and PRC2 collectively regulate chromatin compaction 
through specific histone modifications: PRC2 first binds to chromatin and its catalytic 
subunit, EZH2, trimethylates H3K27. H3K27me3 is then recognized by PRC1, which 
contains BMI1, followed by monoubiquitination of histone 2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) 
to cause chromatin compaction and pausing of RNA polymerase II. However, recent 
evidence suggests that PRC1 can also silence gene expression through a non-canonical, 
H3K27me3-independent mechanism26. Based on this background, we investigated PRC1 
and PRC2 activity with H2AK119Ub and H3K27me3 staining in multiregional patient 
biopsy samples, observing dichotomous distribution of H2AK119Ub and H3K27me3 
positive cells in hypoxic (necrotic) and vascular (enhancing) regions, respectively (Fig. 2a 
and Supplementary Fig. 5a). As the GSC markers CD133 and CD44 may be specific for 
glioblastoma subgroup16, we employed another GSC marker, CD15 (stage-specific 
embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA1))34, which we find is less specific, but more sensitive than 
CD133 (data not shown). CD15+ cells in different regions expressed H2AK119Ub or 
H3K27me3 and displayed functional characteristics of GSCs (Fig. 2a and Supplementary 
Fig. 5a–c). Using image-guided biopsies from two new glioblastomas, we interrogated 
genome-wide distribution of chromatin marks from PRC1 (H2AK119Ub28) or PRC2 
(H3K27me3) in CD15+ GSCs from enhancing and necrotic regions using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). To determine region specific 
peaks, we analyzed overlapping peaks in both patient specimens and identified peaks that 
were both unique to a particular anatomic region and shared between patient specimens (Fig. 
2b). Annotation of region-specific target genes of H3K27me3 or H2AK119Ub with 
overlapping peaks in a same anatomic region revealed over 80% of region-specific target 
genes displayed differential H3K27me3 or H2AK119Ub marks (Fig. 2c and Supplementary 
Table 1), indicating distinct PRC function in GSCs residing in different regions. While 
intertumoral variation was substantial, shared regions converged on important gene targets. 
H3K27me3, generally associated with inhibition of transcription, marked neuronal and 
cellular development targets in both the ER and NR, albeit without substantial overlap in 
gene identity, with EZH2/SUZ12/H3K27me3 targets most significantly in the ER (Fig. 2d 
and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, H2AK119Ub marked very different targets in the 
ER and NR, with H2AK119Ub in CD15+ GSCs from the hypoxia (necrotic) regions 
marking genes strongly associated with mesenchymal signaling pathways, such as TGFβ, 
NFκB, and WNT (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 1), indicating probable 
microenvironment-specific functions of PRC2 and PRC1. Furthermore, an EZH2 activation 
signature (containing 41 putative targets or partners of EZH236) and EZH2 protein levels 
were significantly enriched in tumors with proneural signatures or high expression of 
OLIG2, a proneural marker (Fig. 2e, 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6g), whereas a BMI1 
activation signature (containing 341 genes downregulated upon BMI1 knockdown37) and 
BMI1 protein levels were significantly enriched in tumors with mesenchymal transcriptional 
profiles or high expression of CD44, a mesenchymal marker (Fig. 2f, 3a, and Supplementary 
Fig. 7g).

 To assess PRC contribution to microenvironment-specific distribution of glioblastoma 
subtypes, we correlated EZH2, BMI1, and microenvironment-related signatures. The EZH2 
activation signature positively correlated with proneural and mature vascular signature, but 
negatively correlated with mesenchymal and classical microenvironment signatures 
(Supplementary Fig. 6f, 8b, and 8c), implicating EZH2 function in tumor neovascular 
regions31. Conversely, a BMI1 activation signature correlated positively with mesenchymal 
or classical microenvironment signatures and negatively with a proneural microenvironment 
signature (Supplementary Fig. 7f, 8b, and 8c). EZH2 and BMI1 protein or activation 
signatures were each associated with poor prognosis, but the worst prognosis was associated 
with high expression levels of both proteins or signatures (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 6e, 
6h, 6i, 7e, 7h, 8a, and 8d), suggesting that combined PRC1–PRC2 activation portends 
greater tumor malignancy.
As both EZH2 and BMI1 regulate GSCs, we investigated BMI1 and EZH2 levels in several 
validated proneural and mesenchymal GSC and neural progenitor cell models. BMI1 and 
H2AK119Ub were markedly increased in CD44+ and YKL40+ mesenchymal GSCs, 
whereas EZH2 and H3K27me3 were associated with OLIG2+ and SOX2+ proneural GSCs 
(Fig. 3c). RNA-seq data from 19 patient-derived GSC models that we generated confirmed 
EZH2 mRNA and activity signatures correlated with a proneural signature, while BMI1 
activation, but not BMI1 mRNA, correlated with mesenchymal GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 
9), indicating that BMI1 and EZH2 signaling pathways were activated in different GSC 
subtypes.
EZH2 mRNA expression levels correlated with the EZH2 activation signature and the 
proneural subtype and microenvironment in TCGA tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 6), 
but, surprisingly, BMI1 mRNA expression did not correlate with a BMI1 activation 
signature or the mesenchymal subtype/microenvironment signature (Supplementary Fig. 7), 
suggesting that EZH2 is regulated at the transcriptional level but BMI1 is regulated post-
transcriptionally. Inhibiting translation with cycloheximide treatment showed that BMI1 
protein levels were unchanged in mesenchymal GSCs, but markedly reduced in proneural 
GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Conversely, poly-ubiquitinated BMI1 was strongly 
increased in proneural GSCs after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, but 
weakly accumulated in mesenchymal GSCs under the same conditions (Fig. 3d), suggesting 
that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis maintains BMI1 protein stability in GSCs of different 
subtypes.
Based on apparent region-specific BMI1 proteosomal degradation, we interrogated the 
TCGA glioblastoma database for ubiquitin-related genes whose expression correlated 
inversely with BMI1 activation. Among 254 genes associated with ubiquitination, 22 genes 
were differentially expressed by proneural and mesenchymal glioblastomas (Supplementary 
Fig. 10b). To link these genes to BMI1 activity, we plotted r values for the 22 genes against 
two BMI1-related signatures (Fig. 3e). The top r value negatively associated with BMI1 
activation was associated with the ring finger, RNF144A, which was previously described as 
a E3 ligase for the DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs39. 
Supporting its potential role as a BMI1 E3 ligase, RNF144A expression negatively 
correlated with BMI1 activation and positively correlated with a BMI1 inhibition signature

 (Fig. 3e). ChIP-seq for acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) on a panel of glioma 
GSCs and primary patient glioblastoma tissues with proneural or mesenchymal signatures 
were then compared to deposited results for other gliomas and normal brain. CD44 showed 
preferential activation in mesenchymal models, whereas OLIG2 was more specific for 
proneural tumors (Supplementary Fig. 10c). RNF144A transcriptional regulation was 
stronger in proneural models and correlated with SOX2 (Supplementary Fig. 10c). 
Supporting a negative regulatory role of RNF144A on BMI1 protein levels, mesenchymal 
GSCs expressed lower RNF144A protein levels compared to normal neural precursors and 
proneural GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 10d). Immunoprecipitation confirmed direct binding of 
RNF144A to BMI1 (Supplementary Fig. 10e). Depleting RNF144A in proneural GSCs with 
low baseline levels of BMI1 reduced poly-ubiquitinated BMI1 after proteolysis inhibition 
and concordantly increased non-ubiquitinated BMI1 protein expression (Fig. 3f). Non-
ubiquitinated BMI1 protein in RNF144A knockdown cells persisted at similar levels with or 
without proteolysis inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 10f), highlighting RNF144A-mediated 
poly-ubiquitination as a regulatory node for BMI1 protein degradation.
To determine the clinical relevance of RNF144A in gliomas, we examined its regulation and 
survival in patient tissues and databases. RNF144A expression was lower in glioblastoma 
than low grade gliomas (LGG) and inversely related to patient survival (Supplementary Fig. 
11a–d). Using the LGG-glioblastoma TCGA dataset, we mapped the mRNA expression 
levels for RNF144A and EZH2 against tumor histology, grade, survival, and common 
molecular features (IDH1 or ATRX mutations; chromosome 1p and 19 co-deletion) 
(Supplementary Fig. 12a). RNF144A mRNA levels were strongly inversely correlated with 
glioblastoma histology and IDH1 mutation, with a weaker association with chromosome 1p 
and 19q co-deletion. RNF144AlowEZH2high tumors were enriched with unfavorable 
microenvironmental transcriptional signatures (Supplementary Fig. 12b). To determine the 
prognostic significance of RNF144A and EZH2 mRNA levels, we mapped expression levels 
for each targets and derived survival trends, revealing that RNF144AlowEZH2high tumors 
had the lowest survival (Supplementary Fig. 12c). Multivariate analysis considering patient 
age, tumor grade, and IDH mutation revealed RNF144A mRNA and BMI1 activation 
signatures as independent prognostic factors for overall survival of glioma prognosis 
(Supplementary Table 2), but not for glioblastoma (Supplementary Table 3). Collectively, 
suppression of RNF144A informs tumor grade and poor patient outcome, supporting a 
negative role in tumor malignancy.
To determine a functional role for differential PRC utilization by GSCs, we examined EZH2 
and BMI1 expression in GSCs and neural precursors under stressful conditions, including 
hypoxia and nutrient restriction: neural precursors and proneural GSCs lost BMI1 and EZH2 
expression, with loss of proneural GSC markers (Fig. 3g). In contrast, mesenchymal GSCs 
under stress retained BMI1 expression and increased levels of mesenchymal markers (Fig. 
3g). Mesenchymal GSCs preferentially survived stress, whereas almost all neural precursors 
and proneural GSCs died (Fig. 3h). Thus, stress conditions, similar to those found in the 
pseudopallisading necrotic regions, may select for BMI1high mesenchymal glioma cells. 
Under low stress, RNF144A depletion in proneural GSCs increased BMI1 expression but 
did not alter cell proliferation or self-renewal, suggesting that BMI1 is not essential in the 
absence of stress (Supplementary Fig. 13a and 13b). In contrast, targeting RNF144A

 expression in proneural GSCs under stress increased cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 13c). 
To further assess PRC function under stress, we depleted either EZH2 or BMI1 using two 
non-overlapping specific shRNAs for each target in two proneural (Supplementary Fig. 14a) 
and two mesenchymal GSC models (Supplementary Fig. 14b). Targeting BMI1 or EZH2 
protein levels and chromatin effects was confirmed on immunoblot, measured by their 
respective modifications, H2K119Ub and H3K27me3. BMI1 depletion potently decreased 
cell viability of mesenchymal GSCs under stress, with modest or no effects on proneural 
GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 14c). In contrast, EZH2 depletion failed to sensitize GSCs to 
harsh growth conditions, suggesting that EZH2 is dispensable under stress. To further 
support these findings, forced BMI1 expression in proneural GSCs significantly increased 
cell viability under stress, without altering cell growth or tumorsphere formation in the 
absence of stress (Supplementary Fig. 14d–g).
To determine the potential role of BMI1 in mediating in vivo tumor growth mimicking 
regional tumor growth, we performed an in vivo cell mixing experiment with orthotopic co-
implantation of BMI1-overexpressing mCherry+ proneural GSCs and control GFP+ 
proneural GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 14h). BMI1+ cells significantly accelerated disease 
progression compared to GFP+ control proneural GSCs (Supplementary Fig. 14i). BMI1-
overexpressing cells preferentially localized to CA9+ hypoxic regions in the subsequent 
brain tumors (Supplementary Fig. 14j), suggesting that BMI1 confers tumor cell fitness in 
the hypoxic niche. In line with the preferential expression of EZH2 in proneural cells, RNA 
interference using two non-overlapping shRNAs against EZH2 preferentially reduced cell 
growth and tumorsphere generation of proneural GSCs (Fig. 4a and 4b). Reciprocally, BMI1 
depletion preferentially reduced mesenchymal GSC cell growth and tumorsphere formation 
(Fig. 4a and 4b), demonstrating differential sensitivity to PRC depletion based on molecular 
subtypes. Collectively, these results support a context-specific role for BMI1, suggesting that 
differential utilization of PRCs may contribute to divergent subtype-specific niche 
adaptation and associated poor prognosis.
To leverage our findings for clinical application, we examined the sensitivity of GSC 
subtypes to inhibitors of BMI1 (PTC596, denoted as BMI1-i) or EZH2 (EPZ6438, denoted 
as EZH2-i). Mesenchymal GSCs displayed preferential sensitivity to BMI1-i treatment with 
an IC50 of BMI1-i fourfold lower than the IC50 of proneural GSCs and a neural precursor 
line (Fig. 4c and 4d). Conversely, proneural GSCs were generally more sensitive to EZH2 
inhibitor treatment. Differential sensitivity to BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors was confirmed 
using the mean IC50 of BMI1 (122 nM) and EZH2 (45 μM) inhibitors in proneural and 
mesenchymal GSCs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 15a). To determine combinatorial 
efficacy, we interrogated the effects of a range of concentrations of each inhibitor against 
two proneural and two mesenchymal GSC models (Supplementary Fig. 15b and 15c). While 
the interaction did not achieve synergy, the combination of low, clinically achievable 
concentrations of BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors completely blocked tumorsphere formation 
and eradicated the GSC population (Fig. 4e). As all drugs may have off-target effects, we 
validated the subtype specific effect of BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors on cell viability and 
tumorsphere-forming ability with other structurally unrelated inhibitors: PTC209 (another 
BMI1 inhibitor) and DZNep (another EZH2 inhibitor) (Supplementary Fig. 16).

 Systemically delivered drugs against brain tumors must achieve intracranial delivery, as even 
contrast enhancing gliomas, representing a disrupted blood-tumor barrier, usually have 
regions of tumor protected by a barrier. To augment the brain penetration of the EZH2i, we 
leveraged a previously developed approach using a combination with Elacridar (a dual 
ABCCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor)40. Measurement of the plasma and brain levels of BMI1i 
after treatment BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated that at least 20% BMI1i blood 
levels penetrate into the brain (Supplementary Fig. 17a and 17b). To determine if the 
concentrations achievable in the brain were efficacious, we plotted the measured 
concentrations of BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors in the brain against the combinational efficacy 
studies on four different subtype GSCs, consistent with an 80% in vitro inhibitory 
concentration (Supplementary Fig. 16d, 17a, and 17b)40. Pharmacodynamics analysis of 
each agent against intracranial models over a time course confirmed that BMI1 and EZH2 
inhibitors specifically attenuated H2K119Ub and H3K27me3 in tumor tissues obtained from 
orthotopic tumors (Supplementary Fig. 17c–e).
Leveraging evidence that the BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors penetrate into the brain, we 
examined the therapeutic effects of BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors on mice bearing intracranial 
tumors derived from proneural, mesenchymal, or mixtures of proneural and mesenchymal 
GSCs (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 18a). Though near the limit of detection, 
bioluminescent imaging confirmed that anti-tumor effects of EZH2 inhibition were more 
effective against proneural models than mesenchymal models, whereas BMI1 inhibition 
displayed the opposite predilection, with combined therapy being more effective (Fig. 5b, 
Supplementary Fig. 18b–e, and Supplementary Fig. 19). To address the in vivo cellular 
effects of the EZH2 or BMI1 inhibitor treatments, we xenografted a combination of 
mCherry+ proneural and GFP+ mesenchymal GSCs, treated with vehicle control or the 
inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination and analyzed the treated tumors 
(Supplementary Fig. 20). In mCherry+ proneural cells, EZH2i treatment specifically reduced 
the number of cells with the PRC2 mark H3K27me3, the GSC marker CD15, and the cell 
proliferation marker Ki67; whereas, there were much more modest changes in mesenchymal 
cells. In contrast, BMI1i treatment ablated the mesenchymal population. The combination of 
the BMI1 and EZH2 inhibitors had effects on each marker in both compartments. Cell 
apoptosis, as measured by active CASPASE3, and senescence, as measured by senescence 
associated β-GAL, did not show substantial changes with any of the therapies tested. 
Further, we quantified the residual number of each fluorescently labeled tumor cell 
population after each therapy, confirming preferential activity of each inhibitor of the 
specific tumor subtype and superiority of combined treatment (Fig. 5c). These in vivo results 
translated into superior survival of combined treatment (Fig. 5d–f), indicating that the 
combinatorial inhibition of BMI1 and EZH2 is an effective treatment strategy for 
heterogeneous microenvironment-dependent subtype glioblastoma.
DISCUSSION
Tumor cell heterogeneity arises from variation in genetics, epigenetic cell state, and 
microenvironment. Single cell RNA sequencing of gliomas demonstrated intratumoral 
variation in transcription profiles with a fraction of proliferating cells that express stem cell 
programs13. Multiple GSC clones can be derived from a single patient14,35,36. Our results

 refine these observations by linking spatially defined, radiographic features to GSCs with 
specific transcriptional signatures and response to targeted therapies. We recently reported 
that mesenchymal GSCs have hypomethylated DNA, associated with reduced availability of 
methionine and hypoxic induction of methyltransferases that deplete methyl donors37, 
suggesting that regional epigenetic regulation could extend to DNA methylation. Here, we 
find that stress responses may select for different dependencies on PRCs, with PRC1 (BMI1) 
promoting cellular survival in areas of low oxygen and nutrient availability. Collectively, 
these findings support a model in which hypoxia promotes the survival of mesenchymal 
GSCs by repressing the expression of RNF144A that results in enhanced BMI1 protein 
stability. Like neural stem cells, GSCs receive maintenance cues from their 
microenvironment; yet GSCs are not passive recipients of these cues, but rather actively 
remodel their environment through induction of angiogenesis and other features38. As we 
and others have found that hypoxia, acidic stress, and nutrient restriction promote GSC 
maintenance, the RNF144A-BMI1 regulatory mechanism may empower GSCs to reside in 
stressful microenvironments.
The significance of epigenetic diversity in tumors is supported by genetic observations that 
collectively 40% of glioblastomas harbor mutations in epigenetic regulators, including BMI1 
and EZH239. Epigenetic dysregulation may induce neoplasia and be amenable to therapeutic 
targeting, but likely do not adhere to a simple dichotomization of mutations into oncogenes 
and tumor suppressors, rather permitting cellular plasticity to accelerate tumor evolution. 
IDH1 mutations transform astrocytes through modulation of DNA methylation40. Mutant 
IDH1 inhibitors attenuate tumor growth of gliomas harboring IDH1 mutations41. Pediatric 
glioblastomas are commonly driven by mutations in variant histones, which lead to 
alterations in DNA methylation and transformation42–44. Epigenetic regulators may be 
particularly effective to target as oncogenic pathways converge on the epigenome to 
maintain neoplasia45. BMI1 regulates tumor initiation and growth in a genetically 
engineered murine model of glioblastoma and human stem-like glioma lines46–49. BMI1 
binds and regulates the promoters of numerous genes, including transforming growth factor-
β (TGFβ), which has been strongly linked to a mesenchymal phenotype50. Targeted 
therapies against BMI1 have shown preclinical efficacy in a number of cancer types, with 
effects against cancer stem cells51. EZH2 has also been investigated as a cancer therapeutic 
target with numerous studies suggesting potential therapeutic benefit against adult and 
pediatric high grade gliomas52–57. The dynamic interchange of elements between PRC1 and 
PRC2 suggests that the roles of BMI1 and EZH2 are not biochemically interchangeable, but 
may permit a plasticity of cell state under different microenvironmental conditions. Our 
results support a model in which GSCs are present in different niches with differential 
utilization of BMI1 and EZH2 (Supplementary Fig. 21). Thus, differential region-specific 
dependency on epigenetic modifiers may inform the development of a combinatorial 
treatment approach that could collapse intratumoral heterogeneity and limit adaptation to 
cancer therapeutics.
Comparatively, far less is understood about Ring Finger protein 144A (RNF144A) beyond 
its enzymatic function. RNF144A is an E3 ligase for DNA-PKcs39. Interrogation of the 
cBioPortal database shows that several cancer types have mutations or amplifications in 
RNF144A, including prostate, breast, uterine, and lung (data not shown). A single low-grade

 glioma patient had a missense mutation and the TCGA glioblastoma data revealed one 
patient each with a deletion, amplification, and nonsense mutation (data not shown). Prior 
reports investigating BMI1 mRNA expression supported increased expression in proneural 
tumors, but our results demonstrate that BMI1 activity does not correlate with BMI1 mRNA 
levels and that BMI1 protein levels are higher in mesenchymal tumors than proneural 
tumors. RNF144A post-translational regulation of BMI1 provides a novel mechanism of 
BMI1 regulation in glioblastoma, and reveals a limitation of transcriptional target discovery. 
Moreover, the clinical relevance of the RNF144A and BMI1 activation signatures inform 
biomarker development for BMI1 inhibitors.
Our results demonstrate the significant efficacy of combined inhibition of BMI1 and EZH2, 
but we did not detect cures: the efficacy against each subtype was preferential, but not 
absolute. Though monotherapy alone against either PRC component hindered tumor growth 
near the limits of detection, combinatorial therapy against both proneural and mesenchymal 
tumors achieved the most efficacious tumor control. Glioblastoma cells can undergo 
molecular subtype transitions under the influence of different tumor microenvironment that 
may lead to different effects between in vitro and in vivo experiments by BMI1 and EZH2 
inhibitor treatments. Future studies will determine how interconversion of different pools of 
GSCs may support adaptive resistance to targeted therapies. While our therapeutic paradigm 
will likely evolve before direct clinical application, our findings suggest that epigenetic 
therapies against heterogeneous tumors may need to be considered in combination. Both 
BMI1 and EZH2 contribute to resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, suggesting that our 
dual targeting strategy may be useful in combination with conventional therapies55,58,59. 
Similar to our prognostic findings, the combined expression of BMI1 and EZH2 in bulk 
tumor may have greater negative prognostic significance than either target alone60. As single 
tumors may contain different pools of GSCs, we advocate considering not only combined 
targeting of epigenetic processes, which may prevent the plasticity of cell state transitions, 
but also GSC pools.
ONLINE METHODS
Human glioblastoma specimens
Excess tumor tissues were collected from glioblastoma patients from whom informed 
consent was obtained in accordance with approved Institutional Review Board protocols 
from Cleveland Clinic, Duke University, or University Hospitals-Cleveland Medical Center 
(UH-CMC). At UH-CMC, the surgeon selected only tumors with significant quantities of 
enhancing tumor; peritumor regions, which were non-enhancing on T1 weighted MRI with 
gadolinium but hyperintense on FLAIR imaging and thought to contain infiltrating tumor 
cells; and necrotic avascular regions in the center of the tumor (enhancing region, enhancing 
margin, and necrotic region respectively as indicated in Fig. 1). Prior to surgery, the surgeon 
obtained volumetric imaging of the patient and pre-selected distinct areas of enhancing, 
necrotic and invading tissue to sample according to his surgical strategy. In the operating 
room, after co-registration was confirmed to be accurate (BrainLab Stealth), the surgeon 
then sampled regions from these distinct areas using stereotactic techniques at the beginning

 of the procedure. These distinct specimens from different anatomic regions of each tumor 
were then processed separately and analyzed as indicated below.
Cells and culture condition
Fresh CD15+ GSCs from CW2451, CW2472, and CW2473 glioblastoma primary specimens 
were isolated with magnetic columns (MACS, CD15 microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec, 
130-046-601), and functionally validated self-renewal ability with Limited dilution assay 
(LDA). Cultures enriched or depleted for GSCs (PN1919, PN3691, PN1914.2, MES3565, 
MES738, and MES3128) were isolated from surgical specimens or xenografts and 
functionally validated, as previously described5–7. Functional assays included prospective 
enrichment of stem cell marker expression, sphere formation, and in vivo tumor formation. 
Cellular contamination was ruled out by serial short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and 
mycoplasma testing. Molecular subtyping was performed by either expression array or RNA 
sequencing. The subtype-characterized GSCs (PN11, PN23, PN-JK2, PN-MMK1, MES20, 
MES28, and MES-MN1) were a generous gift from Erick P. Sulman (M.D. Anderson 
Cancer Center) or Andrew W. Boyd (Queensland Institute of Medical Research). Normal 
neural progenitor cells [NPC1 (NHP1), NPC2 (NPC16357), and NPC3 (NPC17893)] and 
GSCs were maintained in Neurobasal medium with B27 (without vitamin A, Invitrogen), 
basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml) and epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA 
using the aScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences). Real-time PCR was performed on 
an Applied Biosystems 7900HT cycler using SYBR-green Mastermix (SA Biosciences).

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation assay
Cells were collected and lysed in IP Lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing phosSTOP 
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis) and 
separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE Bis-
Tris gel, Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were 
blocked with 5% (wt/vol) non-fat milk in PBS-Tween-20 (0.5% vol/vol) and probed with 
primary antibodies against BMI1 (1:1000, Abcam, ab126783), H2K119Ub (1:1000, Cell 
signaling, #8240S), CD44 (1:1000, BD Biosciences, 550392), YKL40 (1:1000, Abcam, 
ab86428), EZH2 (1:1000, BD Biosciences, 612667), H3K27Me3 (1:1000, Millipore, 
07-689), OLIG2 (1:1000, R&D system, AF2418), SOX2 (1:1000, R&D system, AF2018), 
RNF144A (1:500, Abcam, ab89260), Ub (1:5000, Santa Cruz, sc-9133), TUBULIN (α-
Tubulin,1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, T6074), and ACTIN (β-actin,1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, 
A1978). BMI1-RNF144A interaction and BMI1 polyubiquitination were detected by Pierce 
Crosslink magnetic IP and Co-IP kit (Thermo Scientific). For the ubiquitination assays, cells 
were treated with Lactacystin (5 μM or 10 μM; Sigma) for 5hr before collection. BMI1 
polyubiquitination was quantified by Image J.
Immunofluorescence and β-GAL staining
10 μm thick slides of de-identified frozen multi-regional samples [glioblastoma patient 
(CW1757) according T1-weighted MRI images] and PN3691 (VEC/BMI1) xenografted 
frozen brain tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunolabeled using the

 primary antibodies against SOX2 (1:500, R&D system, AF2018), CD44 (1:100, BD 
Biosciences, 550392), vWF (1:500, Millipore, AB7356), CA9 (1:100, Genetex, GTX70020), 
H3K27Me3 (1:1000, Millipore, 07-689), H2AK119Ub (1:500, Cell signaling, #8240S), 
CD15 (1:100, Millipore, MAB4301), Ki67 (1:100, Dako, M7240), active CASPASE3 
(1:100, Cell signaling, #9661S) and the secondary fluorescence-labeled antibodies. Nuclei 
were counterstained with DAPI. Immunofluorescence images were taken by a LEICA TCS 
SP5 Confocal Microscope or a Leica SCN400 Slide Scanner. A Senescence β-Galctosidase 
Staining Kit (Cell Signaling, 9860S) was used to detect senescent cells in tumor tissues, the 
phase-contrast light images were captured by Leica DM4000 B microscope.
Tissue microarray (TMA) and Immunohistochemistry
5 μm thick slides of de-identified paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays (TMAs) were 
constructed from glioma after obtaining Ohio State University Institutional Review Board 
Approval. A total of 96 cases were arrayed on the TMA block, including 15 non-neoplastic 
controls (cortical dysplasias), 16 grade II glioma cases, 27 grade III gliomas, and 38 grade 
IV glioblastomas. Tissues too small and/or crushed on the TMA were eliminated from 
analysis after immunohistochemistry staining with anti-BMI1 (1:50, Abcam, ab126783), 
anti-EZH2 (1:100, BD Biosciences, 612667), anti-CD44 (1:100, BD Biosciences, 550392), 
anti-OLIG2 (1:100, R&D system, AF2418), and secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies. The 
TMA images were taken by a Leica SCN400 Slide Scanner. Overall staining on TMA was 
scored as – (negative) or + (positive) compared to non-neoplastic controls. PN3691 (with or 
without treatment with BMI1 or EZH2 inhibitors) xenografted brain tissues were fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde, and were stained with anti-H2K119Ub (1:100, Cell signaling, 
#8240S), anti-H3K27Me3 (1:1000, Millipore, 07-689), and secondary HRP-conjugated 
antibodies. Nuclei in immunohistochemistry were counterstained with Hematoxylin. The 
immunohistochemistry images were taken by a LEICA DM4000B Microscope, and were 
analyzed by IHC Profiler.
Cell viability and cell growth assays
Cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) 
according to manufacturer’s instructions after exposing 3 days under different conditions 
including low-glucose (0.45 g/l glucose)10, hypoxia (1% oxygen)7, BMI1 inhibitor 
(PTC596, PTC therapeutics; PTC209, PTC therapeutics), and EZH2 inhibitor (EPZ6438, 
Medchemexpress LLC; DZNep, SELLECKCHEM). 1×106 cells were seeded for cell 
viability under low-glucose or/and hypoxia conditions, 2×103 cells were seeded for drug 
response under BMI1 or EZH2 inhibitor treatment. IC50 values of BMI1 or EZH2 inhibitors 
were calculated with GraphPad Prism software. For competitive response assay of BMI1 and 
EZH2 inhibitors, the proportion of GFP or mCherry positive cells was determined by flow 
cytometry after treatment the co-cultured MES83-GFP and PN528-mCherry cells with 
PTC-209, and DZNep. Two-dimensional titration assay was performed on four different 
subtype GSCs after combined treatment with different doses of PTC596 and EPZ6438. 
Relative cell growth was measured over a four-day time course using CellTiter-Glo 
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) after seeding 1×103 cells.

 In vitro limiting dilution tumorsphere formation assay
For detection of stem cell frequency change by BMI1 and EZH2 signaling pathway, different 
numbers of cells per well (range of 40 to 1 cell/well) were seeded in 96-well plates 
containing 100 μl completed neurobasal medium with or without BMI1 or/and EZH2 
inhibitors, and added 20 μl completed neurobasal medium with or without BMI1 or/and 
EZH2 inhibitors per 3 days. After 14 days, the tumorspheres were measured, and were 
analyzed by Extreme Limiting Dilution analysis software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/
software/elda).
Plasmid and lentiviral or retroviral transduction
Lentiviral plasmids for targeting EZH2 (TRCN0000040077 for shEZH2-950, and 
TRCN0000293738 for shEZH2-2450), BMI1 (TRCN0000020158 for swhBMI1-880, and 
TRCN0000020157 for shBMI1-939), RNF144A (TRCN0000004414 for shRNF144A-1099, 
and TRCN0000004416 for shRNF144A-3112) and non-specific control sequence (SCH002 
for shCNTRL) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lentiviral plasmids pGIPZ-GFP, 
PRSC-mCherry, L-2-G, and L-2-T were used to label the BTIC cells in in vivo experiments. 
Lentiviral particles were produced in 293T cells with PAX2 and PMD2G helper plasmids 
(Addgene) in stem cell medium. Retroviral plasmids PMSC-BMI1 and PMSC-VEC 
(control) were used to produce retroviral particles in 293T cells with pCMV-VSVG and 
pCMV-Gag-Pol helper plasmids (Addgene).
Calculation of achievable drug concentrations
Zhang and co-workers reported the pharmacokinetics of the EZH2 inhibitor, EPZ6438, in 
combination with the ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor, Elacridar40. They found that the 
EPZ6438 concentration was 1.5 μg/ml in the plasma and 0.35 mg/kg in the brain 1 hour after 
treatment with 2.5 mg/kg EPZ6438 and 100 mg/kg Elacridar. Based on these observations 
and the likely contamination of the brain measurements by blood, we calculated the 
minimum brain concentration as (1.5 × 0.35)/2.5 = 0.21 μg/ml. Our studies used 350 mg/kg 
of EPZ6438 (e.g. 140-fold higher dose), leading to a calculated brain concentration of 29 – 
210 μg/ml. The molecular weight of EPZ6438 is 572.74, translating into a calculated brain 
concentration range of 51 – 366 μM. We determined the concentration of the BMI1 inhibitor 
4 hours after combined treatment with 10 mg/kg or 12.5 mg/kg BMI1 inhibitor PTC596 
(MW 420.34) and 350 mg/kg EZH2 inhibitor EPZ6438 in the plasma and brain. 10 mg/kg 
BMI1 inhibitor treatment achieved 1 μg/ml in plasma and 2 mg/kg in the brain. Using the 
same approach that we used for the EZH2 inhibitor concentration calculations, we estimated 
the brain concentration range of the BMI1 inhibitor administered at 10 mg/kg as 475.8 – 
2379 nM. Collectively, in vivo drug ranges for each agent achieved concentrations consistent 
with those we detected as having combinational benefit in IC80 concentrations from two-
dimensional drug concentration assays [51.3 – 366.7 μM for the EZH2 inhibitor and 158.6 – 
793 nM (1/3 of 475.8 – 2379 nM) for the BMI1 inhibitor].
Animal experiments
All animal studies were performed in accordance with Cleveland Clinic IACUC approved 
protocols. Required sample sizes were calculated by an a priori power analysis. All mice

 were randomly assigned to appropriate treatment groups. For the co-implantation study, 2.5 
× 105 PN3691-mCherry-BMI1 and 2.5 × 105 PN3691-GFP-VEC cells (BMI1/VEC), or 5 × 
105 PN3691-GFP-VEC (VEC/VEC control) cells were implanted into the right frontal lobes 
of 3 weeks old NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice as previously described7. For 
pharmacokinetic study, BMI1 inhibitor (PTC596) concentration in plasma and brain was 
determined by HPLC-mass after oral administration of BMI1 inhibitor (PTC596) or EZH2 
inhibitor (EPZ6438) with Elacridar (dual ABCCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor; Medchemexpress 
LCC) to enhance EPZ6438 uptake into brain39. For pharmacodynamic testing of BMI1 and 
EZH2 inhibitors, 5 × 105 PN3691 cells were implanted intracranially into NSG mice. After 
1 week, the BMI1 inhibitor (PTC596) or EZH2 inhibitor (EPZ6438) with Elacridar were 
administered orally by gavage. For testing, in vivo inhibition effect of BMI1 and EZH2 
inhibitors, 1 × 105 luciferase-expressing PN1919 or MES20 cells for single subtype 
glioblastoma model, and 1000 RFP-labeled PN1919 and 1000 GFP-labeled MES20 cells for 
subtype-mixed glioblastoma model were implanted intracranially into NSG mice. When the 
luciferase signals from tumor cells were detectable (after 4 days for single subtype model, 
and 10 days for subtype-mixed model), the BMI1 inhibitor or EZH2 inhibitor with Elacridar 
were administered orally by gavage. The size of orthotopic tumor was monitored by 
bioluminescence channel of IVIS Spectrum. The investigators were blinded to the group 
allocation and study outcome assessments of all mice.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of 5–10 mg of flash frozen primary glioblastoma 
tumors, and 1 million fresh CD15+ GSCs was performed using H3K27Ac (5 mg; Active 
Motif, 39133), H3K27Me3 (5 mg; Active Motif, 39155), and H2AK119Ub (10 mg, Cell 
signaling, #8240S) antibodies per ChIP experiment (Abcam, AB4729). Enriched DNA was 
quantified using Picogreen (Invitrogen) and ChIP libraries were amplified and barcoded 
using the Thruplex DNA-seq library preparation kit (Rubicon Genomics) according to 
manufacturer recommendations. Following library amplification, DNA fragments were 
Agarose gel (1.0%) size selected (< 1 kb), assessed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent 
Technologies) and sequenced at The Center for Applied Genomics (The Hospital for Sick 
Children) using Illumina Hi-Seq2000 100 bp single-end sequencing. Sequencing reads were 
aligned using Bowtie2 to the hg19 genome using default settings. HOMER was used for 
calling peaks in the H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub datasets versus ChIP Input data with the 
following settings: -F 2, -P 0.01, -L 2, -LP 0.01, -minDist 5000 –size 1000. Region specific 
peaks were identified using the BedTools subtract function and overlapping peaks were 
defined using the BedTools intersect function. Gene Ontology Pathway analysis was 
performed using the gene set enrichment analysis molecular signatures database at (http://
software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) and using the HOMER annotatePeaks function. 
Molecular Signature bubble plots were created using Cytoscape v3.5 and the Bader Lab 
Enrichment Map software (http://www.baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap). All raw 
ChIP sequencing data may be accessed from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO 
GSE86237).

 RNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), separated using Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 
Prime), and purified using the miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was prepared for 
sequencing by Beckman-Coulter Genomics using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA 
Library Prep Kit. RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform 
by Beckman-Coulter Genomics. For gene expression analysis, reads were aligned to the 
hg19 genome build (retrieved from http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html), using 
Tophat v2.0.6. Paired-end 125-bp reads were generated on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 
instrument at the Case Western Reserve University Genomics Core Facility. Reads were 
aligned to the hg19 genome using TopHat v2.0.6 with the library type option set to first 
strand. FPKM values for known genes were calculated using Cufflinks v2.0.2 provided with 
the GTF file via the -G (known genes only) option. FPKM values were Quantile 
Normalized. All RNA sequencing raw data may be accessed from the NCBI Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE86237).
In silico analyses
Collected in silico resources, including transcript microarray data, RNA sequencing, patient 
survival, and anatomic information of patient samples were downloaded from TCGA 
(https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga) and Ivy GAP (http://glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org) 
portal websites. GBM molecular subtypes (including proneural, classical, and 
mesenchymal), EZH2 and BMI1 activation or inhibition signatures were informed by 
previous publications36, 37, 65. Microenvironment-related gene signatures included: mature-
vascular signature (MATURE_VAS), 9 genes significantly up-regulated twofold in HUVEC 
compared to HMEC (Supplementary Fig. 2a and 2b); microvascular signature 
(MICRO_VAS), 8 genes significantly up-regulated twofold in HMEC compared to HUVEC 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a and 2b); hypoxia activation signature (HYPOXIA_AC), 9 genes 
significantly up-regulated twofold in hypoxia regions compared to normoxia region 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a and 3b); hypoxia inhibition signature (HYPOXIA_IN), 23 genes 
significantly down-regulated in hypoxia regions compared to normoxia regions 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a and 3b). Single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) was used to analyze gene 
signature enrichment in TCGA and Ivy GAP datasets. Correlation of genes and signatures 
was analyzed by Excel software, and the patient survival was analyzed with GraphPad Prism 
software.
Statistical analysis
All grouped data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Significance 
between groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA or Student’s t-test using GraphPad Prism 
software. The F-values and DF for each ANOVA test can be found in the Life Sciences 
Reporting Summary associated with this manuscript. Correlation coefficients were 
calculated by Excel software. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated by GraphPad 
Prism software, and log-rank p-value were used to determine significance. All experiments 
were repeated in each specimen presented in at least three biologic duplicates (patient-
derived xenograft cell models) with technical triplicates. Multivariate linear regression was 
performed using R 3.2.4. Independent variables were tumor type by histology (astrocytoma,

mutant), chromosome 1p/19q co-deletion (co-deleted vs. non-co-deleted) and ATRX status 
(wild-type vs. mutant). Sample size was determined using the appropriate power calculation 
formula in JMP (Version 12, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989–2007) for each 
experimental setup. This study complies with randomization. The investigator was blinded 
to the group allocation during the experiment and/or when assessing the outcome.
