The proteasome generates the epitopes presented on HLA class I molecules that elicit CD8+ T cell 
responses. While reports of proteasome-generated spliced epitopes exist, they have been regarded 
as rare events. Here, however, we show that the proteasome-generated spliced peptide pool 
accounts for one third of the entire HLA class I immunopeptidome in terms of diversity and one 
fourth in terms of abundance. They also represent a unique set of antigens, possessing particular and 
distinguishing features. We validated this observation using a range of complementary experimental 
and bioinformatics approaches, and multiple cell types. The widespread appearance and abundance 
of proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing events will inform immunobiology and autoimmunity 
theories, and may provide a previously untapped source of epitopes for uses in vaccines and cancer 
immunotherapy.

The presentation of epitopes on the cell surface is a key mechanism by which organisms identify 
the presence of pathogens, metabolic malfunctioning, or tumors. The HLA class I (HLA-I) 
immunopeptidome, i.e. the epitopes allocated onto the HLA-I molecules, impinges upon the CD8+ 
T cell repertoire and the cell-mediated immune response (1). HLA-I immunopeptidomes are usually 
investigated by sequence identification of peptides eluted from HLA-I molecules using LC-tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. S1). The key step for the transformation of a protein into HLA-I-
restricted epitopes is usually processing by the proteasome (1), which cuts proteins into peptides; 
alternatively, the proteasome can also cut and paste peptide sequences, thereby releasing peptide 
antigens that do not correspond to the original protein sequence (2) (Fig. S2). This proteasome-
catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) has long been considered to occur only very rarely; partly this 
has been because the screening of the HLA-I immunopeptidome for proteasome-generated spliced 
peptides was impeded by methodological challenges. 
To overcome these problems we developed an analytical strategy, which accounts for recent 
discoveries underpinning the PCPS mechanism, and which can handle the vast proteome-wide 
human spliced peptide database (Fig. S3). With this strategy we initially analyzed the HLA-I-eluted 
immunopeptidome of the GR lymphoblastoid cell line (GR-LCL) adopting, for a deeper coverage 
of the immunopeptidome, a 2D peptide pre-fractionation strategy, followed by a hybrid peptide 
fragmentation method, electron-transfer higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) for peptide 
identification (3, 4) (Fig. S1), supplemented by an adapted target-decoy approach (Fig. S4). Our 
analysis led to the identification of 6592 non-spliced and 3417 spliced 9-12mer peptides (Table 
S1). The latter thus represent 34 % of the total of identified antigenic peptides (Fig. 1A) increasing 
the number of identified HLA-I ligands by some 50%. The authenticity of the identified spliced 
epitopes is confirmed by comparing the LC-MS/MS spectra of 98 exemplary spliced peptides with 
their corresponding synthetic peptides and the computation of their correlation score (Table S2 and 
Fig. S5). In addition, the proteasome-dependent generation of the spliced epitopes was verified in 
vitro for three examples by digestions of synthetic polypeptides harboring the corresponding 
antigenic peptides by purified 20S proteasome (Fig. S6). 
We furthermore queried the HLA-I immunopeptidome mass spectrometry data of GR-LCL against 
the standard Swissprot human proteome database, which does not account for spliced peptides; this 
reveals that 655 peptides (i.e. 9 % of the total non-spliced antigenic peptides) would be erroneously 
matched against this incomplete database as non-spliced peptides, since they have much better hits 
as spliced peptides in our search against the combined spliced and non-spliced peptide database 
(Fig. 1A). The correct sequences for a set of these antigenic spliced peptides are verified by 
comparing the LC-MS/MS spectra of the synthetic spliced and non-spliced candidates with the 
corresponding LC-MS/MS of the GR-LCL HLA-I immunopeptidome (Fig. S7A-I). Our 
  
4 
identifications are further supported by the ion score distributions (see Fig. S4) of the non-spliced 
peptides and of those spliced peptides that were wrongly assigned as non-spliced peptides using the 
standard Swissprot human proteome database, which differ only slightly in their median, but not in 
the overall shape (Fig. S7J). 
In independent technical replicates of the GR-LCL HLA-I immunopeptidome analyzed without pre-
fractioning (see Fig. S1, S8A) through EThcD or higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) we 
identified thousands of peptides, where the spliced peptide pools represent between 25 % and 33 % 
of the HLA-I immunopeptidome diversity (Fig. 1B, Table S1A). To corroborate whether this 
unexpected finding would not be a peculiarity of the GR-LCL cell line we investigated the HLA-I 
immunopeptidome of unrelated cell lines. Here, similar results were obtained in the analysis by 
EThcD of a non-related C1R lymphoid cell line (5), where one third of the HLA-I 
immunopeptidome variety is represented by spliced peptides (Fig. 1A, Table S1B). This large 
prevalence of spliced peptides in the HLA-I immunopeptidome is not a peculiar characteristic of 
lymphoblastoid cell lines since in the HLA-I immunopeptidome of primary human fibroblasts (6) 
29 % of the identified antigenic peptides were spliced peptides (Fig. 1A, Table S1C). Again, if we 
were to query those datasets only against the standard Swissprot human proteome database, we 
would wrongly assign 4 - 7 % of the antigenic peptides as non-spliced peptides (Fig. 1A, B), while 
missing all spliced peptides. 
Spliced peptides were prevalent not only in the HLA-I immunopeptidome but also in the unsorted 
pool of GR-LCL cell lysate peptides with molecular weight (MW) smaller than 3 kDa, the 
maximum size of peptides produced in vitro by proteasome (7) (Fig. 1C). The numbers of both 
non-spliced and spliced 9-12mer peptides declined when we used an inhibitor of proteasome 
activity such as epoxomicin (Fig. 1C, S9). Inhibition of proteasome activity led to a longer median 
length of the non-spliced peptides (Fig. S9), which was to be expected since proteasome generates 
peptides with an average length of 11 residues (7, 8). It also almost eliminated all spliced 9-12mer 
peptides (Fig. 1C, S9), thereby confirming that the identified spliced peptides are generated by 
proteasome.  
We further verified the proteasome-dependency of the spliced peptides by querying the HLA-I 
immunopeptidome of the T2 cell line, which lacks a functioning transporter associated with antigen 
processing (TAP). As for other TAP-deficient cell lines the few antigenic peptides identified so far 
in its HLA-I immunopeptidome derive from both proteasome- and SPase-mediated proteolysis in 
similar manner (9, 10). As expected, compared to other HLA-I immunopeptidomes we identified a 
dramatically reduced number of both spliced and non-spliced peptides eluted from the HLA-I 
molecules of T2 cells. Among them, spliced peptides represented only 13 % of the whole T2 HLA-I 
immunopeptidome (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the analysis of a cytosolic unsorted pool of 9-12mer 
  
5 
peptides of the T2 cells peptides (with MW < 3 kDa) showed a normal frequency of spliced 
peptides (25 %, Fig. 1C). Together these experiments provide further evidence that spliced peptides 
presented by HLA-I molecules are produced by proteasome, and that about half of the TAP-
independent antigenic peptide pool is generated through proteasome activity (9).   
As a final (negative) control we performed LC-MS/MS analysis of a tryptic lysate of the C1R cell 
line (Fig. S8). This time the cell lysate was first filtered to include only proteins with MW > 30 kDa 
to exclude intracellular peptides generated by the proteasome in the mixture. In this tryptic digest 
we identified about 1300 9-12mer non-spliced peptides, but only a few 9-12mer spliced sequences 
(Fig. 1C). In fact, only 2.7 % of them are (likely incorrectly) annotated as spliced peptides, which 
provides us with an experimental limit on the overall false discovery rate (FDR) (see Fig. S4B).  
We thus have independent experiments that provide evidence that about one third of peptides bound 
to HLA-I are generated by PCPS.  
 
Although spliced peptides represent one third of the HLA-I immunopeptidome variety, their 
relevance from an immunological point of view could be undermined if they were not abundantly 
presented at the cell surface. We thus set out to quantify the abundance of each HLA peptide by 
label-free quantification, based on the intensity of the MS ion peak area. Although this method is 
not applicable for single peptides (6, 8), it has recently become well accepted when analyzing large 
proteomics datasets (6, 11, 12). We substantiate this strategy by titrating two pools of synthetic non-
spliced and spliced antigenic peptides and observing no significant differences between non-spliced 
and spliced peptides (Fig. 2A). Using label-free quantification there appear to be significant 
differences in the abundance distribution between non-spliced and spliced peptides. Indeed, the 
spliced antigenic peptides are on average 16 – 26 % less abundant than non-spliced peptides in the 
HLA-I immunopeptidomes of three independent cell lines (Fig. 2B, Fig. 2C). Therefore, based on 
our results we conclude that spliced peptides not only represent one third of the HLA-I 
immunopeptidome variety but also approximately one fourth of the total amount of peptide 
molecules presented onto the HLA-I complex. In agreement with this finding we recently reported 
that the abundance of peptides of a small group of melanoma-associated spliced epitopes exposed 
onto the HLA-I complexes is comparable to that of non-spliced melanoma-associated epitopes (13). 
Moreover, we observed a specific response against those spliced epitopes in the peripheral blood of 
half of the melanoma patients we studied (13), highlighting the potential biological impact of the 
much larger set of spliced epitopes presented in this study. 
 
Spliced epitopes could also represent a distinct pool of antigenic peptides with particular 
characteristics. The few pioneering studies on PCPS had already provided hints about generative 
  
6 
mechanisms. For instance, they suggested that PCPS prefers specific peptide sequences, although 
the limited number of spliced peptides/epitopes identified has so far precluded an analysis with 
sufficient statistical power (2, 8, 14-21). With our large pool of spliced antigenic peptides this 
became possible. Contrasting the characteristics of the spliced and non-spliced peptides in the GR-
LCL HLA-I immunopeptidome we observed no significant differences in terms of: (i) peptide 
length distribution (Fig. S10A) in agreement with our previous observation on in vitro proteasome-
catalyzed reactions (8); (ii) frequency of the number of putative parental proteins that can generate 
each spliced or non-spliced peptide (Fig. S10B); and (iii) the frequencies of spliced and non-spliced 
peptides derived from a given antigen (Fig. S10C). Remarkably, one third of self-antigens are 
represented on the GR-LCL cell surface only by spliced peptides (Fig. 3A and Fig. S10D), showing 
that PCPS increases the antigen exposure and expands the HLA-I immunopeptidome-mediated 
surveillance of the immune system. 
 
Among the identified spliced antigenic peptides in the GR-LCL 2D HLA-I immunopeptidome we 
observed a similar number of spliced peptides generated by the ligation of two splice-reactants 
following their orientation in the parental protein or by inverting their order, i.e. reverse PCPS 
(50.1% were normal cis spliced peptides; see Fig. S2). We did not observe a clear preference for a 
specific length of intervening sequences, i.e. the sequences excised between two splice-reactants 
(Fig. S2, 3B). Also the length of the N- and C-terminal splice-reactants (see Fig. S2) was almost 
equally distributed with the exception of a seemingly preferred length of two residues in the N-
terminal splice-reactant, which is most apparent for 9mer, 10mer and 11mer peptides (Fig. 3C and 
Fig. S10E). Since the second residue of the antigenic peptide often corresponds to the anchor site of 
the specific HLA-I molecules, we can speculate that preference for specific amino acids for the 
ligation could have introduced an evolutionary pressure on the HLA allotype selection, as has 
previously been hypothesized for the proteasome-dependent peptide hydrolysis and the C-terminus 
of the HLA-I-restricted peptides (22). 
 
In the GR-LCL dataset we also compare spliced and non-spliced antigenic peptide motifs in relation 
to HLA-I haplotypes by predicting in silico their binding to HLA-I molecules applying the 
(NetMHC) ANN and (IEDB) SMM algorithms (23, 24). The two algorithms perform similarly if 
we consider the non-spliced antigenic peptides (Fig. S11A-D). They do, however, differ 
significantly in the prediction of how efficiently the spliced peptides bind the specific HLA-A and –
B variants (Fig. S11A-D). Often spliced peptides predicted by (NetMHC) ANN to be barely 
compatible with the specific HLA-I cleft bind it with an experimentally determined IC50 below 
5000 nM (Table S2, Fig. S11E). Such a phenomenon might be due to intrinsic differences in the 
  
7 
motifs of spliced and non-spliced antigenic peptides. Indeed, since the algorithms have been trained 
exclusively on non-spliced epitopes (or non-randomized peptide libraries) their predictive power for 
that peptide type could be limited. This hypothesis is also supported by our previous in vitro PCPS 
analysis (8), where we observed that several spliced peptides were produced by proteasomal cutting 
at rarely used substrate cleavage sites. Such differences emerge when considering the sequence 
motifs of the spliced and non-spliced 9mers within the GR-LCL HLA-I immunopeptidome (Fig. 
3D) and the other immunopeptidome datasets (Fig. S12), especially in the positions 2 and 9, which 
correspond to frequently used anchor sites. 
 
To gather information about sequence preference of PCPS we exploited the large number of spliced 
antigenic peptides available here, and we computed the amino acid distribution at the PN, P1, P1´ 
and PC positions (see Fig. S2) of the GR-LCL HLA-I immunopeptidome. This outcome matched 
the data obtained for the replicate GR-LCL immunopeptidome (1D EThcD), but differs from the 
immunopeptidomes obtained from the C1R cell lineage and human primary fibroblasts (Fig. 3E and 
Fig. S13). The difference between the patterns of the spliced peptide PN, P1, P1´ and PC positions 
could be due to the HLA anchor site differences between the three cell lines. Our more general 
analysis differs markedly from the HLA-A*02:01-restricted P1–P1´ position pattern recently 
published by Berkers and colleagues (20), confirming that an HLA-unbiased strategy to identify 
spliced peptide patterns may be essential for developing PCPS prediction algorithms. 
 
In summary, our study shows that the spliced peptides bound to the HLA-I molecules are very 
frequent and comparable in their amount to the non-spliced peptides but represent a distinct pool of 
antigens and possess particular immunological characteristics. One of the key features that may 
have maintained PCPS through evolutionary history (8, 25, 26) might be its higher degree of 
freedom of selecting antigenic peptide sequences. Targeting antigens through non-spliced peptides 
can be limited by the sequence restrictions that antigens have due to their function. PCPS is a 
solution to this problem as hinted at by the fact that a significant portion of the antigens are 
represented by spliced peptides only. Of course, the unexpectedly large frequency and amount of 
HLA-I-restricted spliced peptides may – and we strongly expect will – have profound implications 
for the concept of self/non-self peptide presentation: the large variety of potential spliced antigenic 
peptides would dramatically increase the number of antigenic peptides with overlapping sequences 
derived from either human or pathogen proteomes with direct implications for autoimmunity (25, 
27, 28). On the other hand, the frequency of antigenic spliced peptides and their features could also 
in turn have positive implications for therapies involving HLA-I-restricted epitopes such as anti-
viral vaccinations or mutation-specific adoptive T cell therapy against tumors (29-33): mutant 
  
8 
antigens lacking HLA-I-restricted non-spliced epitopes could finally be targeted through spliced 
epitopes.

Figure 1. Sizes and characteristics of spliced and non-spliced peptide pools. A-B) Summary of 
the 9-12mer peptides presented by HLA-I molecules on the GR-LCL and C1R cell line, and human 
primary fibroblasts (A), or, as controls, GR-LCL and T2 cell lines (B).  C) Summary of the 9-12mer 
peptides identified among the cell lysates of T2 and GR-LCL cell lines pre-filtered for peptides 
smaller than 3 kDa or of C1R cell line pre-filtered for polypeptide bigger than 30 kDa and trypsin 
digested. Samples are analyzed by different LC-MS/MS methods, as depicted. Light blue shaded 
areas are part of the spliced peptide pool. 
 
Figure 2. Semi-quantitative comparison of HLA-I eluted spliced and non-spliced peptides. A) 
Correlation between the MS ion peak area and the concentration of a pool of 75 non-spliced and 78 
spliced peptides from two experimental replicates. The correlation coefficients with confidence 
intervals are reported in the charts. Linear regression was applied and the resulting regression lines 
with their confidence intervals are depicted for spliced (dark blue line and light blue shaded area) 
and non-spliced (red line and pink shaded area) peptides. Neither the correlation coefficients nor the 
parameters of the regression lines significantly differ between spliced and non-spliced peptides. B) 
Distribution of the MS ion peak area of the spliced and non-spliced peptides eluted from the HLA-I 
molecules of GR-LCL, C1R cell line or human fibroblasts. Dashed lines indicate the median of the 
distribution for spliced (blue) and non-spliced peptides (red). The MS ion peak area distribution of 
the non-spliced peptides is significantly larger than the distribution of the spliced peptides 
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; p-value <10-16). The relative amount of spliced peptides estimated from 
the integral of the MS ion peak areas of spliced peptides relative to the integral of the peak area of 
all peptides is reported. C) Medians of the MS ion peak area of spliced and non-spliced peptides 
identified in the HLA-I immunopeptidome of GR-LCL, C1R cell line or human primary fibroblasts. 
All samples were not pre-fractioned and were analyzed by EThcD (GR-LCL, C1R cell line and the 
synthetic peptide pools) or by HCD (human fibroblasts).

Figure 3. Antigens, characteristics and sequence motifs of spliced and non-spliced peptides of 
the GR-LCL HLA-I immunopeptidome. (A-E) refer to the GR-LCL 2D – EthcD HLA-I 
immunopeptidome. A) Number of antigens represented onto the HLA-I molecules by only spliced, 
only non-spliced or both spliced and non-spliced peptides. B) Length distribution of the sequence 
between the two splice-reactants (i.e. intervening sequence). C) Length distribution of N- and C-
terminal splice-reactants generating the antigenic spliced peptides. D) Frequencies of amino acids at 
each residue of the non-spliced and spliced 9mer peptides. E) Distribution of amino acids in the PN, 
P1, P1´ and PC positions (see Fig. S2) of the spliced peptides. D-E) All frequency values are 
normalized for the frequency of the amino acids in the human proteome, i.e. they indicate the 
probability of observing a certain amino acid at a certain position given the frequency of this amino 
acid in the human proteome.
