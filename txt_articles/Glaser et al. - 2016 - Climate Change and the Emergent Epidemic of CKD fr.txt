Abstract
Climate change has led to significant rise of 0.8˚C–0.9˚C in global mean temperature over the last century and
has been linked with significant increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves (extreme heat events).
Climate change has also been increasingly connected to detrimental human health. One of the consequences of
climate-related extreme heat exposure is dehydration and volume loss, leading to acute mortality from exacer-
bations of pre-existing chronic disease, as well as from outright heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Recent studies
have also shown that recurrent heat exposure with physical exertion and inadequate hydration can lead to CKD
that is distinct from that caused by diabetes, hypertension, or GN. Epidemics of CKD consistent with heat stress
nephropathy are now occurring across the world. Here, we describe this disease, discuss the locations where it
appears to be manifesting, link it with increasing temperatures, and discuss ongoing attempts to prevent the
disease. Heat stress nephropathy may represent one of the first epidemics due to global warming. Government,
industry, and health policy makers in the impacted regions should place greater emphasis on occupational and
community interventions.

One of the pressing challenges facing the world is the
increasingimpactofclimate changeandwatershortage
(driven by both climate change and population expan-
sion) on human health and productivity. Global warm-
ing has resulted in an overall increase of about 0.8°C
during the last century, and is estimated to be respon-
sible for 75% of the extreme heat events (1–4). Heat
waves typically refer to sustained temperatures of
.40°C, or temperature increases of .5–6°C over the
normal maximum temperature of the region, or any
time temperatures reach .45°C (5–7). One of the
most intuitive effects of heat waves on human health
is heat stroke and death. During the summer of 2015,
for example, the heat index—which takes into account
both air temperature and humidity—toppled world
records at 74°C (165°F) in Iran. A heat wave in Pakistan
resulted in 40,000 cases of heat stroke, and another
heat wave in Andhra Pradesh took 1400 lives in 1
month (8–10). Conditions will worsen, with predictions
of a rise of 3–4°C in mean temperature by the end of the
century (11), which could result in intermittent temper-
atures incompatible with outside living in some of the
hottest areas of the world, such as the Middle East (12).
The rise in temperature is paralleled by an increasing
shortage of water, with the percentage of the world
population suffering from moderate water shortage
(defined as 1.0–1.7 m3 water/person per year)
skyrocketing from 5% in 1800 to 50% in 2005, and
with 10% of the world population currently suffering
from extreme (,0.5 m3 water/person per year) water
shortage (13).
While increased risk for heat stroke is an obvious
manifestation of global warming, climate change af-
fects health in many other direct and indirect ways
(14,15). Dehydration secondary to heat stress (relative
water loss with development of hyperosmolarity) is
associated with cognitive dysfunction, hypotension,
and AKI (16). Drought can reduce crop yields, which
can lead to starvation, malnutrition, and act as a threat
multiplier to poverty and violence, especially in re-
gions of the world with poor governance; likewise,
extreme heat waves kill heat-sensitive cereals such as
wheat and rice (17–19). Alterations in water supply,
with variations in precipitation, can lead to emergence
of water-borne and vector-borne infectious diseases
(20,21). Drying up of wells can lead to increased con-
centration of heavy metals and/or toxins. Further-
more, subjects who are chronically dehydrated may
not excrete toxins as effectively as those who are well
hydrated, leading to higher concentrations of toxins in
the serum and kidney. In addition, chronic dehydra-
tion and hyperosmolarity have also been linked with
increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syn-
drome (22,23). Thus, a wide variety of health issues are

 likely to result from climate change over the next century,
emphasizing the importance for educating physicians,
industry, policy makers, and the public.
Recently, an epidemic of CKD of unknown etiology has
been recognized in Central America (Mesoamerican ne-
phropathy),whichhasbeenlinkedwithrecurrentdehydration
and heat stress (24–26). We and others have previously sug-
gested, based on both experimental and epidemiologic
studies, that this disease may be a type of heat stress ne-
phropathy (HSN) and could be an example of a disease that
is accelerated by global warming (27,28). If true, one might
hypothesize that similar epidemics should be occurring
among those working manually in other hot environments.
Unfortunately, the subjects at risk are often from impover-
ished and neglected populations where medical care is
poor, renal biopsies are rarely performed, and diagnosis
is rarely confirmed. Nevertheless, there are reports of
CKD of unknown etiology emerging in other regions of
the world where individuals are performing strenuous
manual labor under very hot conditions (29–31).
Here, we provide a brief summary of these epidemics, and
evaluate the relationship to heat stress, local environmental
changes (global warming and progressive water shortages),
and dietary changes (increased sugar intake). Although
surveillance data are limited, the populations identified as
most at risk are heavy laborers with a high workload, limited
access to potable water, and otherwise extreme working
conditions (32–34). We propose that HSN may be a major
cause of CKD, representing an overlooked disease in
neglected populations in hot communities. We suggest it
may also emerge as a cause of CKD in any population
where subjects are exposed to heat stress.
Mesoamerican Nephropathy
Mesoamerican nephropathy was first reported in 2002
in El Salvador by one of the authors (R.G.T.) during his
medical residency, when excessive numbers of individuals
were presenting at Hospital Rosales in San Salvador with
ESRD (35). The disease typically presents in male sugar-
cane workers from the Pacific coast of Central America,
but has since been reported with less frequency in other
occupations, including in construction workers, corn and
rice farmers, cotton plantation workers, and miners
(32,36–38). In the affected areas women also have an in-
creased prevalence of CKD, although to a much lesser
extent, and there is some preliminary evidence that chil-
dren from these regions may also be at risk (36,39,40).
Clinically, the subjects are usually discovered with an
asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine, in association with
low grade or absent proteinuria, occasionally with micro-
hematuria (36,37). Mild anemia, hypokalemia, and hyperuri-
cemia are common (41–43). Renal biopsies show interstitial
fibrosis, low grade inflammation, tubular atrophy, and
extensive glomerulosclerosis with signs of glomerular ische-
mia but only mild vascular lesions (42,44). Progression to
ESRD occurs over several years and is higher in those
who work more harvests (32). Since chronic renal replace-
ment programs are rarely available in the affected regions,
many thousands have died (25).
Initial concerns were that Mesoamerican nephropathy
might be due to a toxin, for example, from exposure to
agrochemicals (such as glyphosate), heavy metals (such as
from lead, cadmium, or arsenic), or infectious agents (such as
leptospirosis) (24,45,46). The theory that this was a result of
direct exposure to pesticides in the fields, however, is weak-
ened by the presence of the disease in occupations not
involving farming, by reports that there is a greater risk
for renal injury in the sugarcane fields among the cane cut-
ters as opposed to the pesticide applicators, and because the
frequency of the disease is lower in sugarcane cutters work-
ing at higher altitudes where it is significantly cooler than
at lower altitudes, despite similar agrochemical exposure
(32,36,47). Nevertheless, it remains possible that toxins,
for example, could be concentrating in well water that
could affect the populations as a whole. There is also mini-
mal evidence for heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead
or cadmium (29). Nonsteroidal agent use is also common
among the sugarcane workers and could be an additive
factor, but several studies could not identify nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs as an independent risk factor for
CKD in this population (32,36,48). Infections, such as lepto-
spirosis, remain a possible cause (49) but there is minimal
evidence for this disease as a primary driver of this epidemic,
and certainly some manifestations of leptospirosis, such as
liver involvement, are not observed.
HSN: The Cause of Mesoamerican Nephropathy?
The Pacific coast is one of the hottest regions in Central
America and aligns closely with the location of the epi-
demic (Figure 1). As the effects of heat are compounded by
humidity and other factors, heat exposure is commonly
measured by the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a
composite index that includes air temperature, solar radia-
tion (globe temperature), wind speed, and humidity (50). For
outside workers the Occupational Safety Health Administra-
tion recommends frequent work breaks (15 minutes per
hour) for a WBGT of 26°C and breaks of 45 minutes
per hour for a WBGT of $30°C, whereas at temperatures
.35°C humans cannot maintain their body temperature by
usual mechanisms (sweating) for .6 hours (12,50,51).
Sugarcane workers are particularly at risk for heat stress
and dehydration due to the heavy exertion, lack of shade,
infrequent breaks, long work hours (in some regions), and
lack of access to sufficient potable water during the workday
(50,52). Sugarcane is often burned to facilitate cutting and,
depending on the local policy, some sugarcane workers
enter the fields the morning after the burning, where they
may be exposed to additional heat from the recently
burned cane. While work begins in the early morning
when the temperature is relatively cooler, the WBGT often
surpasses 28°C by midmorning (53). As such, many sub-
jects show symptoms of heat stress and dehydration when
in the fields (headaches, lightheadedness, and fainting), and
during the work shift their systolic and diastolic BP falls,
pulse rises, and urine becomes progressively concentrated
and acidic due to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, with a loss of hydrogen and potassium
in the urine (50,54).
Evidence that heat stress and recurrent dehydration may
be the cause of Mesoamerican nephropathy is emerging.
Acute dehydration is generally considered to be a reversible
type of kidney failure (termed ‘prerenal’) that responds to

 rehydration. However, there is an interesting report of four
Bantu gold miners who developed heat stroke with AKI that
recovered only to later present with CKD due to chronic
interstitial fibrosis (55). Experimental studies in mice have
also demonstrated that recurrent daily heat exposure and
dehydration can cause chronic tubulointerstitial disease
with fibrosis and inflammation, similar to what is observed
in renal biopsies of subjects with Mesoamerican nephrop-
athy (56). Interestingly, renal injury is largely prevented if
rehydration is given between exposure to heat/dehydration,
as opposed to at the end of the day, despite equivalent
amounts of water provided. This mirrors conditions in the
fields where workers often only rehydrate at lunch and at
the end of the workday. The mechanism has been linked
with development of hyperosmolarity with activation of
the vasopressin and aldose reductase/fructokinase pathway
(56,57). Recurrent dehydration, for example, activates aldose
reductase in the proximal tubule, converting glucose to
fructose that is metabolized by fructokinase in the prox-
imal tubule, leading to the release of oxidants that cause
local tubular injury (56). Vasopressin has also been shown to
accelerate experimental CKD (58,59). In turn, repeated AKI
may lead to CKD (60).
Dehydration and recurrent volume depletion may also
cause CKD via other mechanisms (Figure 2). For example,
volume depletion can lead to hypokalemia, which causes
intrarenal vasoconstriction and hypoxia, resulting in chronic
tubulointerstitial injury (61). Hypokalemia is common
among sugarcane workers presenting with CKD (41–43).
Nevertheless, the tubular vacuolation common in hypoka-
lemic nephropathy (61) has not been reported. Heat stress-
associated labor can also result in subclinical or clinical
rhabdomyolysis from low grade muscle trauma and heat,
and has been shown to occur during the work shift in sug-
arcane workers (34). Rhabdomyolysis is a well known cause
of AKI (62), and repeated exposures may lead to CKD.
Finally, hyperuricemia and uricosuria associated with heat
stress may lead to excessive levels of uric acid in the urine,
which may also crystallize in the urine, and this has also
been documented in the affected sugarcane workers (28).
Indeed, many subjects complain of intermittent dysuria
from the passage of sand-like material (termed chistata in
Nicaragua and mal de orín in El Salvador) due to urate crys-
talluria, and this is frequent in sugarcane workers and is
associated with signs of dehydration (50,63,64).
Studies in Costa Rica have shown that Mesoamerican
nephropathy was probably present in the 1970s in the
Guanacaste province on the Pacific coast, yet the prevalence
had increased almost ten-fold in men and four-fold in
women by 2010 (39). During this same time, the maximum
temperatures in Central America had risen by 0.8°C–1.0°C
(Figures 1 and 3). While the mean rise in temperature may
seem small, temperature extremes (the number of extremely
hot days) increased by 30%–75% (1). During the sugarcane
harvest, maximum WBGT often surpasses the 30°C limit by
10:30 a.m., especially during the late harvest of April and
May, with levels .35°C being occasionally recorded (41,50).
Thus, the risk for recurrent dehydration is likely greater on
these hot days. Consistent with this possibility, in a study in
which uric acid was measured before and after work on four
different dates during a sugarcane harvest, we noted one
day in which all seven worker samples available showed
extremely high uric acid levels (.100 mg/dl) compared
with the other dates, and this was one of the hotter days of
the year (May of 2013) (65).
We propose that Mesoamerican nephropathy is more
frequent in sugarcane workers as they are working in the
most extreme conditions, as noted by heat exposure and
work intensity (66). Indeed, one study found that the
greatest risk for Mesoamerican nephropathy in El Salvador

region in El Salvador, or Guanacaste in Costa Rica. Those areas are also generally colocated with the climatologically warmest zones (left

 was working in sugarcane fields, with the second greatest
risk factor being working in areas of high mean maximum
temperature (67). However, all individuals spending time
in the hot external environment, or indoors without suffi-
cient ventilation, might be at risk, potentially explaining
why there is some evidence for the presence of renal injury
in other occupations, in women, and possibly in children.
While the rise in disease prevalence may be due, in part,
to improved diagnosis and surveillance, there is likely a
true rise in incidence that correlates with climate change.
Inadequate hydration is also a key factor, as some subjects
are afraid of drinking well water as it may contain toxins,
and others drink fructose-containing sugary beverages
(juices and soft drinks) that may exacerbate the renal injury
(56). Laboratory rats with heat-associated dehydration show
worse renal damage if they are rehydrated with sugary
beverages as opposed to water (68). Finally, there may be
higher risk in sugarcane workers than in the past, as the
practice of burning cane prior to harvesting was enacted
only in the last few decades and this has also led to an
increase in the average number of tons cut by workers in a
given day. These environmental and land use factors are
exacerbated by greater demands placed on sugarcane cut-
ters, as they are paid by piece. While definitive data for
Central America is lacking, a study in Brazil reported that
sugarcane workers are required to cut three to four times as
much as they did 20 years ago (69).
Sri Lanka Nephropathy
A similar epidemic of CKD of unknown etiology is ongoing
in the northern provinces of Sri Lanka (70–73). The epidemic
has been increasing since the 1980s, and currently affects
more than 100,000 individuals (74). The primary popula-
tion affected are young to middle-aged male rice farmers,
although women working in the fields are also at risk
(73,74). The CKD is clinically similar to that observed in
Central America, with most subjects presenting with asymp-
tomatic elevations in serum creatinine with normal BP and
minimal proteinuria, or with the individuals discovered to
already be in ESRD. Biopsies show chronic tubulointerstitial
disease (75).
The etiology of Sri Lanka nephropathy remains unknown.
The association of the disease with drinking well water (76)
has led to concerns of toxin exposure, such as from heavy
metals (cadmium and arsenic) or agrochemicals (71). While
an early study linked cadmium exposure with the CKD (72),
more recent studies have found minimal evidence for
cadmium or other heavy metal exposure, with levels in
both deep and surface wells within acceptable limits (77,78).
Exposure to agrochemicals, such as glyphosphate, re-
main possible and some studies suggest that the disease
may represent an aggregate of nephrotoxins as opposed
to a single entity (71). Nevertheless, concerns that the
wells are contaminated may encourage farmers not to
drink local water and could predispose them to increased
risk for dehydration. The Northern Province is the hot-
test region in Sri Lanka (Figure 4). Indeed, in one study
in which 100 subjects with CKD were compared with
control subjects, the risk for CKD was higher in those
exposed to the sun, those working for .6 hours, and
those drinking ,3 L of water per day (risk increased be-
tween fourfold and eightfold), and this was also
Figure 2. | Mechanism for heat stress nephropathy. Repeated heat stress and water shortage, especially when coupled with overexertion, can
lead to several pathophysiologic processes, including low grade or overt rhabdomyolysis, hyperosmolarity, hyperthermia, and extracellular
volume depletion. These processes can result in several mechanisms that can lead to AKI, including the acute effects of vasopressin on renal
tubules, endogenous fructose metabolism in the proximal tubule via the fructokinase system, the development of uricosuria and urate crystal
formation, hypokalemia-induced renal vasoconstriction and injury, and a generalized reduction in renal blood flow that may also cause is-
chemic damage. Repeated AKI, in turn, may lead to chronic tubulointerstitial disease.

 associated with the presence of dysuria at the end of the
work day that cannot be ascribed to urinary tract infection
(76). Similar to the situation in Central America, many
subjects with CKD also have hyperuricemia (mean levels
of 7.2 mg/dl versus 5.2 mg/dl in controls) and hypokalemia
(Channa Jayasumana, personal communication).

annual temperatures is evident, it is interesting that the most northern part of Sri Lanka is also hot but does not appear to be a site of

reporting. (A) and (B) courtesy of Channa Jayasumana (106). (C) is from the Centre for Climate Change Studies, Department of

 The Epidemics of CKD in India
An epidemic of CKD in rural farmers (of rice, coconuts,
and cashews) in Andhra Pradesh, India, was first observed
by one of the authors (G.T.). A study of 1500 villagers in the
Prakasham district documented 27% with serum creatinine
levels .1.5 mg/dl, with 60% having an eGFR of ,60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 (30,79). Studies based on sites where hemodi-
alysis is present suggest even higher rates in the Nellore
District to the south, and represent rates that are about
tenfold higher than in other regions of India. Similar
to Mesoamerican nephropathy, the disease is observed pri-
marily in hot, rural communities in which the primary
occupation is farming. Most subjects present late and renal
biopsies are not done; however, when performed they
show chronic tubulointerstitial disease, with many of the
features suggesting a similar disease as Mesoamerican
nephropathy, including an asymptomatic rise in serum
creatinine with minimal proteinuria, in the absence of
diabetes and hypertension. Furthermore, many of these
subjects give a history of recurrent dehydration and frequent
hyperuricemia (Gangadhar Taduri, personal communication).
Similar to Mesoamerican nephropathy, there is also some
evidence that this disease has been present for decades but
has increased in recent years. Indeed, Mani reported in
1993 that chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (diagnosed
based on clinical presentation of small kidneys with no
history of edema, minimal proteinuria, and an absence
of diabetes and hypertension) was the most common cause
of CKD in his unit in Madras, especially among the rural
farmers of the area, where it constituted 40% of all cases of
CKD (80).
India has experienced rising temperatures over the last
century, with a mean annual rise of 0.8°C in the last 100
years (81). This has been associated with a 10.4% decrease
in annual rainfall over the last century (1901–2007), with a
17.6% decrease in annual rainy days over the same period
(81). Whereas traditionally, the farmers living in rural
areas relied on surface water from lakes, ponds, and shallow

wave days (Avg HW days) between March and July (hottest time of the year) in India, based on the number of heat wave days over the 50-year
period. Andhra Pradesh has had some of the longest heat waves, with one recorded at 35 days. Other suspected sites of CKD of unknown
etiology, such as the Akola district of Maharashtra and the central Odisha region, are also sites with high number of heat waves. In contrast, Goa
does not show this pattern. Courtesy: Editor Mausam—India Meteorological Department. Reprinted from reference 5, with permission.

 wells as their source of drinking water, there has been a shift
toward drinking ground water that in some rural areas, such
as Andhra Pradesh, is becoming increasingly limited due
to inferior quality and decreasing groundwater tables (82).
In Andhra Pradesh, the number of heat wave days during
spring has increased markedly, with one heat wave lasting
35 days (Figure 5), and this is associated with an increase in
heat strokes and mortality (5). Climate projections for the
21st century also show a nationwide increase in tempera-
ture, heat waves, and heat stress-related mortality (83). The
minimum temperatures have also been increasing in recent
decades and are projected to increase over the Indian sub-
continent (83). This reduces the nighttime cooling that is
typically available, thereby increasing hydration stress, and
can also reduce crop yield, especially rice.
Other Hot Spots of CKD
South Asia
Other areas with CKD of unknown etiology are slowly
being recognized (Table 1). For example, there are reports
of CKD epidemics in other areas of India, including Goa,
some regions in central Odisha, and Akola districts in
Maharashtra (Vivek Jha, personal communication). This
seems consistent with increased occurrence of heat waves
and decreased rainfall in these regions (5) (Figure 5). CKD
of undetermined etiology is also one of the dominant causes
of ESRD in Thailand, accounting for 20%–25% of causes of
ESRD (84,85). CKD of unknown etiology is highest in the
northeastern (Isan) region, which is one of the hottest
regions in Thailand. These subjects also show signs of
recurrent dehydration, with the presence of hypokalemia,
hyperuricemia, acidic urine, and passage of sand-like mate-
rial with dysuria similar to that observed in Central America
(Amorn Premgamone, personal communication) (86,87).
These observations are consistent with epidemiologic
studies in Thailand linking excessive CKD with occupational
heat stress (88) and hyperuricemia (89).
North and South America
Back to the Americas, there are similar reports of excessive
CKD of unknown etiology in Mexico, in the rural region of
Tierra Blanca, Veracruz (90). Tierra Blanca has the hottest
climate in Veracruz State and most of the agricultural activ-
ities include sugarcane, lime, cantaloupe, papaya, rice,
mango, and bananas. The National Cardiology Institute in
Mexico City has been a referral center for this population,
and 58 kidney transplants from this area have been done in
the past 5 years. These patients are typically young men
(mean age, 29 years) with no traditional risk factors for
CKD. A recent analysis in this area reported that the prev-
alence of CKD was 15%–25% in males aged 20–39 years old,
and the death certificates from CKD report 32–77 per
100,000 deaths per year, with 20% of the deaths occurring
in subjects ,40 years old (91). AKI has also been reported in
sugarcane workers in Brazil (34), and population-based
studies are being planned in Brazil to better understand
the clinical and epidemiologic situation on the ground.
There have also been reports that farm workers, most of
whom are migrants, may be developing acute kidney disease
and CKD at higher rates than expected in the Central Valley
of California (92,93). One recent study linked hospitaliza-
tions for dehydration and AKI with the onset of heat waves
in the Central Valley and other hot regions in California (94).
Further studies are required to better characterize the preva-
lence and clinical characteristics of the CKD, but it is worri-
some that it may be similar to what is occurring with farmers
in other hot, rural environments. Clinicians in California and
Texas have also reported immigrants from Mexico and
Central America with work histories and clinical character-
istics consistent with the profile of the disease outlined in
this paper (David Sheikh-Hamad, personal communication).

 Notably, the Migrant Clinicians Network has initiated a sur-
vey to determine if HSN may be occurring among migrant
workers in the United States (95).
Africa and the Middle East
In northern Africa and the Middle East, ESRD has been
reported to be high in rural farm workers in El Minya in
Upper Egypt (27% of cases) (96,97) and in the Tabuk area
of Saudi Arabia (33% of cases) (96). Further studies are
needed to address the role of heat stress and dehydration
in these disorders and their relation to climate change and
water supplies. Less is known about the etiology of ESRD
in sub-Saharan Africa, in part because of the rarity of renal
biopsy and poor overall reporting (98).
General Mechanism for CKD
In addition, the observation that recurrent dehydration
may cause CKD also suggests that chronic dehydration
or intermittent hyperosmolarity may also have a role as a
general risk factor for CKD of traditional causes (57). It is
interesting that both low water intake and low urinary pH
have recently been identified as risk factors for CKD pro-
gression, and some studies suggest that bicarbonate therapy
may slow renal disease, which might act by alkalinizing the
urine and reducing uric acid crystal formation (99–101).
Possible Low Cost Treatment Opportunities
Prevention of HSN should focus on improving hydration
and worksite practices. Given that hyperuricemia and urico-
suria is common, lowering uric acid may also provide a
low cost treatment opportunity. There is increasing evidence
that lowering uric acid in hyperuricemic subjects can slow
the progression of CKD (102,103). Noticeably, allopurinol
was reported to slow renal disease progression in a cohort
of patients from Andhra Pradesh, of which 25%–30% had
CKD from chronic tubulointerstitial disease (104). As scale
and scope of this disease grows due to improved surveillance,
a warming world, increased work demands, and an in-
creasing informal labor sector that produces more precar-
ious populations, the costs associated with treatment and
loss of productivity for countries, and industry, are likely
to be enormous. Prevention, early diagnosis, and cost-effective
treatment are paramount.

 Limitations
While the epidemics of CKD in Central America, India,
and Sri Lanka are associated with recurrent heat stress and
dehydration, more studies need to be performed to address
if this mechanism is causal and whether similar processes
are occurring at other sites (Table 1). Based on temperature
patterns, we predict that similar epidemics of CKD from
HSN may be ongoing and potentially discoverable in the
hotter regions of Africa and the Middle East. However, it
is important to recognize that toxicity from agrochemicals,
heavy metals, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
remain potential contributing factors. It is also important
to recognize that reports of CKD of unknown etiology do
not in themselves support the presence of HSN, but rather
require epidemiologic studies investigating the role of heat
stress and recurrent dehydration as risk factors. It also
remains possible that some of the “epidemics” may repre-
sent improved awareness and diagnosis rather than a new
epidemic. Nevertheless, temperature maximums are increas-
ing, especially in the equatorial zone. Figure 6 shows the
change in maximum temperature between 1945 and 2014,
which indicates an increase in the hot spots discussed
above–South India, Sri Lanka, and Central America. The
temperature increase in recent decades and in the future
also leads to evaporative loss of water that will compound
the reduction in water availability.
Summary
CKD that is not associated with traditional risk factors
appears to be increasing in rural hot communities in associ-
ation with a progressive rise in worldwide temperatures. The
disease is a type of chronic tubulointerstitial disease that has
only recently been recognized, and we propose that it may be
due to heat stress (HSN). We believe the risk for HSN has
been increased as a consequence of global warming and
an increase in extreme heat waves. We further suggest this
disease has a disproportionate impact on vulnerable pop-
ulations, i.e., agricultural workers. Warmer temperatures,
coupled with decreasing precipitation, exacerbate this epi-
demic by reducing water supply and water quality. We rec-
ommend epidemiologic and clinical studies to document the
presence of these epidemics, their magnitude, and the role
of dehydration and hyperosmolarity. A coordinated effort
by governments and researchers to improve surveillance
must be undertaken so we may understand the scale of
the epidemic. Ongoing occupational interventions, such as
the Worker Health and Efficiency Program in El Salvador
(https://laislafoundation.org/the-we-program-we-can-end-
ckdnt-video/), and actions by the government to improve
worksite conditions (such as adequate breaks for rest and
adequate clothing) should be continued. Improved hydra-
tion, alkalinization of the urine, and the lowering of uric acid
may represent new approaches for the prevention and treat-
ment of this type of CKD.
