 The Prevalence of Substance Use and Other Mental
Health Concerns Among American Attorneys
Patrick R. Krill, JD, LLM, Ryan Johnson, MA, and Linda Albert, MSSW
Objectives: Rates of substance use and other mental health concerns
among attorneys are relatively unknown, despite the potential for
harm that attorney impairment poses to the struggling individuals
themselves, and to our communities, government, economy, and
society. This study measured the prevalence of these concerns among
licensed attorneys, their utilization of treatment services, and what
barriers existed between them and the services they may need.
Methods: A sample of 12,825 licensed, employed attorneys com-
pleted surveys, assessing alcohol use, drug use, and symptoms of
depression, anxiety, and stress.
Results: Substantial rates of behavioral health problems were found,
with 20.6% screening positive for hazardous, harmful, and poten-
tially alcohol-dependent drinking. Men had a higher proportion of
positive screens, and also younger participants and those working in
the field for a shorter duration (P < 0.001). Age group predicted
Alcohol Use Disorders IdentificationTest scores; respondents 30 years
of age or younger were more likely to have a higher score than their
older peers (P < 0.001). Levels of depression, anxiety, and stress
among attorneys were significant, with 28%, 19%, and 23% experi-
encing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.
Conclusions: Attorneys experience problematic drinking that is
hazardous, harmful, or otherwise consistent with alcohol use disorders
at a higher rate than other professional populations. Mental health
distress is also significant. These data underscore the need for greater
resources for lawyer assistance programs, and also the expansion of
available attorney-specific prevention and treatment interventions.
Key Words: attorneys, mental health, prevalence, substance use
(J Addict Med 2016;10: 46–52)
L
ittle is known about the current behavioral health climate
in the legal profession. Despite a widespread belief that
attorneys experience substance use disorders and other mental
health concerns at a high rate, few studies have been under-
taken to validate these beliefs empirically or statistically.
Although previous research had indicated that those in the
legal profession struggle with problematic alcohol use,
depression, and anxiety more so than the general population,
the issues have largely gone unexamined for decades (Benja-
min et al., 1990; Eaton et al., 1990; Beck et al., 1995). The
most recent and also the most widely cited research on these
issues comes from a 1990 study involving approximately
1200 attorneys in Washington State (Benjamin et al.,
1990). Researchers found 18% of attorneys were problem
drinkers, which they stated was almost twice the 10% esti-
mated prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence among
American adults at that time. They further found that 19% of
the Washington lawyers suffered from statistically significant
elevated levels of depression, which they contrasted with the
then-current depression estimates of 3% to 9% of individuals
in Western industrialized countries.
While the authors of the 1990 study called for
additional research about the prevalence of alcoholism
and depression among practicing US attorneys, a quarter
century has passed with no such data emerging. In contrast,
behavioral health issues have been regularly studied among
physicians, providing a firmer understanding of the needs
of that population (Oreskovich et al., 2012). Although
physicians experience substance use disorders at a rate
similar to the general population, the public health and
safety issues associated with physician impairment have
led to intense public and professional interest in the matter
(DuPont et al., 2009).
Although the consequences of attorney impairment may
seem less direct or urgent than the threat posed by impaired
physicians, they are nonetheless profound and far-reaching.
As a licensed profession that influences all aspects of society,
economy, and government, levels of impairment among
attorneys are of great importance and should therefore be
closely evaluated (Rothstein, 2008). A scarcity of data on the
current rates of substance use and mental health concerns
among lawyers, therefore, has substantial implications and
must be addressed. Although many in the profession have
long understood the need for greater resources and support for
attorneys struggling with addiction or other mental health
concerns, the formulation of cohesive and informed strategies
for addressing those issues has been handicapped by the

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 outdated and poorly defined scope of the problem (Associ-
ation of American Law Schools, 1994).
Recognizing this need, we set out to measure the
prevalence of substance use and mental health concerns
among licensed attorneys, their awareness and utilization
of treatment services, and what, if any, barriers exist between
them and the services they may need. We report those
findings here.
METHODS
Procedures
Before recruiting participants to the study, approval
was granted by an institutional review board. To obtain a
representative sample of attorneys within the United States,
recruitment was coordinated through 19 states. Among
them, 15 state bar associations and the 2 largest counties
of 1 additional state e-mailed the survey to their members.
Those bar associations were instructed to send 3 recruit-
ment e-mails over a 1-month period to all members who
were currently licensed attorneys. Three additional states
posted the recruitment announcement to their bar associ-
ation web sites. The recruitment announcements provided a
brief synopsis of the study and past research in this area,
described the goals of the study, and provided a URL
directing people to the consent form and electronic survey.
Participants completed measures assessing alcohol use,
drug
use,
and
mental
health
symptoms.
Participants
were not asked for identifying information, thus allowing
them to complete the survey anonymously. Because of
concerns regarding potential identification of individual
bar members, IP addresses and geo-location data were
not tracked.
Participants
A total of 14,895 individuals completed the survey.
Participants were included in the analyses if they were
currently employed, and employed in the legal profession,
resulting in a final sample of 12,825. Due to the nature of
recruitment (eg, e-mail blasts, web postings), and that recruit-
ment mailing lists were controlled by the participating bar
associations, it is not possible to calculate a participation rate
among the entire population. Demographic characteristics are
presented in Table 1. Fairly equal numbers of men (53.4%)
and women (46.5%) participated in the study. Age was
measured in 6 categories from 30 years or younger, and
increasing in 10-year increments to 71 years or older; the
most commonly reported age group was 31 to 40 years old.
The majority of the participants were identified as Caucasian/
White (91.3%).
As shown in Table 2, the most commonly reported legal
professional career length was 10 years or less (34.8%),
followed by 11 to 20 years (22.7%) and 21 to 30 years
(20.5%). The most common work environment reported
was in private firms (40.9%), among whom the most common
positions were Senior Partner (25.0%), Junior Associate
(20.5%), and Senior Associate (20.3%). Over two-thirds
(67.2%) of the sample reported working 41 hours or more
per week.

Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
(Babor et al., 2001) is a 10-item self-report instrument
developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
screen for hazardous use, harmful use, and the potential for
alcohol dependence. The AUDIT generates scores ranging
from 0 to 40. Scores of 8 or higher indicate hazardous or
harmful alcohol intake, and also possible dependence (Babor
et al., 2001). Scores are categorized into zones to reflect
increasing severity with zone II reflective of hazardous use,
zone III indicative of harmful use, and zone IV warranting full
diagnostic evaluation for alcohol use disorder. For the pur-
poses of this study, we use the phrase ‘‘problematic use’’ to
capture all 3 of the zones related to a positive AUDIT screen.
The AUDIT is a widely used instrument, with well
established validity and reliability across a multitude of
populations (Meneses-Gaya et al., 2009). To compare current
rates of problem drinking with those found in other popu-
lations, AUDIT-C scores were also calculated. The AUDIT-C
is a subscale comprised of the first 3 questions of the AUDIT

 focused on the quantity and frequency of use, yielding a range
of scores from 0 to 12. The results were analyzed using a cut-
off score of 5 for men and 4 for women, which have been
interpreted as a positive screen for alcohol abuse or possible
alcohol dependence (Bradley et al., 1998; Bush et al., 1998).
Two other subscales focus on dependence symptoms (eg,
impaired control, morning drinking) and harmful use (eg,
blackouts, alcohol-related injuries).
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 item version
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) is
a self-report instrument consisting of three 7-item subscales
assessing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Indi-
vidual items are scored on a 4-point scale (0–3), allowing for
subscale scores ranging from 0 to 21 (Lovibond and Lovi-
bond, 1995). Past studies have shown adequate construct
validity and high internal consistency reliability (Antony
et al., 1998; Clara et al., 2001; Crawford and Henry, 2003;
Henry and Crawford, 2005).
Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 item version
The short-form Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 (DAST)
is a 10-item, self-report instrument designed to screen and
quantify consequences of drug use in both a clinical and
research setting. The DAST scores range from 0 to 10 and are
categorized into low, intermediate, substantial, and severe-
concern categories. The DAST-10 correlates highly with both
20-item and full 28-item versions, and has demonstrated
reliability and validity (Yudko et al., 2007).
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics were used to outline personal and
professional characteristics of the sample. Relationships
between variables were measured through x2 tests for inde-
pendence, and comparisons between groups were tested using
Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
Alcohol Use
Of the 12,825 participants included in the analysis,
11,278 completed all 10 questions on the AUDIT, with
20.6% of those participants scoring at a level consistent with
problematic drinking. The relationships between demographic
and professional characteristics and problematic drinking are
summarized in Table 3. Men had a significantly higher pro-
portion of positive screens for problematic use compared with
women (x2 [1, N ¼ 11,229] ¼ 154.57, P < 0.001); younger
participants had a significantly higher proportion compared
with the older age groups (x2 [6, N ¼ 11,213] ¼ 232.15,
P < 0.001); and those working in the field for a shorter duration
had a significantly higher proportion compared with those who
had worked in the field for longer (x2 [4, N ¼ 11,252] ¼ 230.01,
P < 0.001). Relative to work environment and position,
attorneys working in private firms or for the bar association
had higher proportions than those in other environments
(x2 [8, N ¼ 11,244] ¼ 43.75, P < 0.001), and higher pro-
portions were also found for those at the junior or
senior associate level compared with other positions (x2 [6,
N ¼ 4671] ¼ 61.70, P < 0.001).
Of the 12,825 participants, 11,489 completed the first
3 AUDIT questions, allowing an AUDIT-C score to be calcu-
lated. Among these participants, 36.4% had an AUDIT-C score
consistent with hazardous drinking or possible alcohol abuse or
dependence. A significantly higher proportion of women
(39.5%) had AUDIT-C scores consistent with problematic
use compared with men (33.7%) (x2 [1, N ¼ 11,440] ¼
41.93, P < 0.001).
A total of 2901 participants (22.6%) reported that they
have felt their use of alcohol or other substances was problem-
atic at some point in their lives; of those that felt their use has
been a problem, 27.6% reported problematic use manifested
before law school, 14.2% during law school, 43.7% within 15
years of completing law school, and 14.6% more than 15 years
after completing law school.
An ordinal regression was used to determine the pre-
dictive validity of age, position, and number of years in the
legal field on problematic drinking behaviors, as measured by
the AUDIT. Initial analyses included all 3 factors in a model to
predict whether or not respondents would have a clinically
significant total AUDIT score of 8 or higher. Age group
predicted clinically significant AUDIT scores; respondents
30 years of age or younger were significantly more likely to
have a higher score than their older peers (b ¼ 0.52, Wald
[df ¼ 1] ¼ 4.12, P < 0.001). Number of years in the field

 approached significance, with higher AUDIT scores predicted
for those just starting out in the legal profession (0–10 yrs of
experience) (b ¼ 0.46, Wald [df ¼ 1] ¼ 3.808, P ¼ 0.051).
Model-based calculated probabilities for respondents aged
30 or younger indicated that they had a mean probability of
0.35 (standard deviation [SD] ¼ 0.01), or a 35% chance for
scoring an 8 or higher on the AUDIT; in comparison, those
respondents who were 61 or older had a mean probability of
0.17 (SD ¼ 0.01), or a 17% chance of scoring an 8 or higher.
Each of the 3 subscales of the AUDIT was also inves-
tigated. For the AUDIT-C, which measures frequency and
quantity of alcohol consumed, age was a strong predictor of
subscore, with younger respondents demonstrating signifi-
cantly higher AUDIT-C scores. Respondents who were
30 years old or younger, 31 to 40 years old, and 41 to 50
years old all had significantly higher AUDIT-C scores than
their older peers, respectively (b ¼ 1.16, Wald [df ¼ 1] ¼
24.56,
P < 0.001;
b ¼ 0.86,
Wald
[df ¼ 1] ¼ 16.08,
P < 0.001; and b ¼ 0.48, Wald [df ¼ 1] ¼ 6.237, P ¼ 0.013),
indicating that younger age predicted higher frequencies of
drinking and quantity of alcohol consumed. No other factors
were significant predictors of AUDIT-C scores. Neither the
predictive model for the dependence subscale nor the harmful
use subscale indicated significant predictive ability for the
3 included factors.
Drug Use
Participants were questioned regarding their use of
various classes of both licit and illicit substances to provide
a basis for further study. Participant use of substances is
displayed in Table 1. Of participants who endorsed use of
a specific substance class in the past 12 months, those using
stimulants had the highest rate of weekly usage (74.1%),
followed by sedatives (51.3%), tobacco (46.8%), marijuana
(31.0%), and opioids (21.6%). Among the entire sample,
26.7% (n ¼ 3419) completed the DAST, with a mean score
of 1.97 (SD ¼ 1.36). Rates of low, intermediate, substantial,
and severe concern were 76.0%, 20.9%, 3.0%, and 0.1%,
respectively. Data collected from the DAST were found to
not meet the assumptions for more advanced statistical
procedures. As a result, no inferences about these data
could be made.
Mental Health
Among the sample, 11,516 participants (89.8%) com-
pleted all questions on the DASS-21. Relationships between
demographic and professional characteristics and depression,
anxiety, and stress subscale scores are summarized in Table 4.
While men had significantly higher levels of depression
(P < 0.05) on the DASS-21, women had higher levels of
anxiety (P < 0.001) and stress (P < 0.001). DASS-21 anxiety,

 depression, and stress scores decreased as participants’ age or
years worked in the field increased (P < 0.001). When com-
paring positions within private firms, more senior positions
were generally associated with lower DASS-21 subscale
scores (P < 0.001). Participants classified as nonproblematic
drinkers on the AUDIT had lower levels of depression, anxiety,
and stress (P < 0.001), as measured by the DASS-21.
Comparisons of DASS-21 scores by AUDIT drinking classi-
fication are outlined in Table 5.
Participants were questioned regarding any past mental
health concerns over the course of their legal career, and
provided self-report endorsement of any specific mental
health concerns they had experienced. The most common
mental health conditions reported were anxiety (61.1%),
followed by depression (45.7%), social anxiety (16.1%),
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (12.5%), panic dis-
order (8.0%), and bipolar disorder (2.4%). In addition, 11.5%
of the participants reported suicidal thoughts at some point
during their career, 2.9% reported self-injurious behaviors,
and 0.7% reported at least 1 prior suicide attempt.
Treatment Utilization and Barriers to
Treatment
Of the 6.8% of the participants who reported past treat-
ment for alcohol or drug use (n ¼ 807), 21.8% (n ¼ 174)
reported utilizing treatment programs specifically tailored to
legal professionals. Participants who had reported prior treat-
ment tailored to legal professionals had significantly lower
mean AUDIT scores (M ¼ 5.84, SD ¼ 6.39) than participants
who attended a treatment program not tailored to legal pro-
fessionals (M¼ 7.80, SD ¼ 7.09, P < 0.001).
Participants who reported prior treatment for substance
use were questioned regarding barriers that impacted their
ability to obtain treatment services. Those reporting no prior
treatment were questioned regarding hypothetical barriers in
the event they were to need future treatment or services. The
2 most common barriers were the same for both groups: not
wanting others to find out they needed help (50.6% and 25.7%
for the treatment and nontreatment groups, respectively), and
concerns regarding privacy or confidentiality (44.2% and
23.4% for the groups, respectively).

 DISCUSSION
Our research reveals a concerning amount of behavioral
health problems among attorneys in the United States. Our
most significant findings are the rates of hazardous, harmful,
and potentially alcohol dependent drinking and high rates of
depression and anxiety symptoms. We found positive AUDIT
screens for 20.6% of our sample; in comparison, 11.8% of a
broad, highly educated workforce screened positive on the
same measure (Matano et al., 2003). Among physicians and
surgeons, Oreskovich et al. (2012) found that 15% screened
positive on the AUDIT-C subscale focused on the quantity and
frequency of use, whereas 36.4% of our sample screened
positive on the same subscale. While rates of problematic
drinking in our sample are generally consistent with those
reported by Benjamin et al. (1990) in their study of attorneys
(18%), we found considerably higher rates of mental
health distress.
We also found interesting differences among attorneys
at different stages of their careers. Previous research had
demonstrated a positive association between the increased
prevalence of problematic drinking and an increased amount
of years spent in the profession (Benjamin et al., 1990). Our
findings represent a direct reversal of that association, with
attorneys in the first 10 years of their practice now experi-
encing the highest rates of problematic use (28.9%), followed
by attorneys practicing for 11 to 20 years (20.6%), and
continuing to decrease slightly from 21 years or more. These
percentages correspond with our findings regarding position
within a law firm, with junior associates having the highest
rates of problematic use, followed by senior associates, junior
partners, and senior partners. This trend is further reinforced
by the fact that of the respondents who stated that they believe
their alcohol use has been a problem (23%), the majority
(44%) indicated that the problem began within the first
15 years of practice, as opposed to those who indicated the
problem started before law school (26.7%) or after more than
15 years in the profession (14.5%). Taken together, it is
reasonable to surmise from these findings that being in the
early stages of one’s legal career is strongly correlated with a
high risk of developing an alcohol use disorder. Working from
the assumption that a majority of new attorneys will be under
the age of 40, that conclusion is further supported by the fact
that the highest rates of problematic drinking were present
among attorneys under the age of 30 (32.3%), followed by
attorneys aged 31 to 40 (26.1%), with declining rates
reported thereafter.
Levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among attor-
neys reported here are significant, with 28%, 19%, and 23%
experiencing mild or higher levels of depression, anxiety, and
stress, respectively. In terms of career prevalence, 61%
reported concerns with anxiety at some point in their career
and 46% reported concerns with depression. Mental health
concerns often co-occur with alcohol use disorders (Gianoli
and Petrakis, 2013), and our study reveals significantly higher
levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among those screen-
ing positive for problematic alcohol use. Furthermore, these
mental health concerns manifested on a similar trajectory to
alcohol use disorders, in that they generally decreased as both
age and years in the field increased. At the same time, those
with depression, anxiety, and stress scores within the normal
range endorsed significantly fewer behaviors associated with
problematic alcohol use.
While some individuals may drink to cope with their
psychological or emotional problems, others may experience
those same problems as a result of their drinking. It is not clear
which scenario is more prevalent or likely in this population,
though the ubiquity of alcohol in the legal professional culture
certainly demonstrates both its ready availability and social
acceptability, should one choose to cope with their mental
health problems in that manner. Attorneys working in private
firms experience some of the highest levels of problematic
alcohol use compared with other work environments, which
may underscore a relationship between professional culture
and drinking. Irrespective of causation, we know that co-
occurring disorders are more likely to remit when addressed
concurrently (Gianoli and Petrakis, 2013). Targeted interven-
tions and strategies to simultaneously address both the alcohol
use and mental health of newer attorneys warrant serious
consideration and development if we hope to increase overall
well being, longevity, and career satisfaction.
Encouragingly, many of the same attorneys who seem to
be at risk for alcohol use disorders are also those who should
theoretically have the greatest access to, and resources for,
therapy, treatment, and other support. Whether through
employer-provided health plans or increased personal finan-
cial means, attorneys in private firms could have more options
for care at their disposal. However, in light of the pervasive
fears surrounding their reputation that many identify as a
barrier to treatment, it is not at all clear that these individuals
would avail themselves of the resources at their disposal while
working in the competitive, high-stakes environment found in
many private firms.
Compared with other populations, we find the signifi-
cantly higher prevalence of problematic alcohol use among
attorneys to be compelling and suggestive of the need for
tailored, profession-informed services. Specialized treatment
services and profession-specific guidelines for recovery man-
agement have demonstrated efficacy in the physician popu-
lation, amounting to a level of care that is quantitatively and
qualitatively different and more effective than that available to
the general public (DuPont et al., 2009).
Our study is subject to limitations. The participants
represent a convenience sample recruited through e-mails and

 news postings to state bar mailing lists and web sites. Because
the participants were not randomly selected, there may be a
voluntary response bias, over-representing individuals that
have a strong opinion on the issue. Additionally, some of those
that may be currently struggling with mental health or sub-
stance use issues may have not noticed or declined the
invitation to participate. Because the questions in the survey
asked about intimate issues, including issues that could
jeopardize participants’ legal careers if asked in other contexts
(eg, illicit drug use), the participants may have withheld
information or responded in a way that made them seem
more favorable. Participating bar associations voiced a con-
cern over individual members being identified based on
responses to questions; therefore no IP addresses or geo-
location data were gathered. However, this also raises the
possibility that a participant took the survey more than once,
although there was no evidence in the data of duplicate
responses. Finally, and most importantly, it must be empha-
sized that estimations of problematic use are not meant to
imply that all participants in this study deemed to demonstrate
symptoms of alcohol use or other mental health disorders
would individually meet diagnostic criteria for such disorders
in the context of a structured clinical assessment.
CONCLUSIONS
Attorneys experience problematic drinking that is
hazardous, harmful, or otherwise generally consistent with
alcohol use disorders at a rate much higher than other
populations. These levels of problematic drinking have a
strong association with both personal and professional
characteristics, most notably sex, age, years in practice,
position within firm, and work environment. Depression,
anxiety, and stress are also significant problems for this
population and most notably associated with the same
personal and professional characteristics. The data reported
here contribute to the fund of knowledge related to behav-
ioral health concerns among practicing attorneys and serve
to inform investments in lawyer assistance programs and an
increase in the availability of attorney-specific treatment.
Greater education aimed at prevention is also indicated,
along with public awareness campaigns within the pro-
fession designed to overcome the pervasive stigma surround-
ing substance use disorders and mental health concerns. The
confidential nature of lawyer-assistance programs should be
more widely publicized in an effort to overcome the privacy
concerns that may create barriers between struggling attor-
neys and the help they need.
