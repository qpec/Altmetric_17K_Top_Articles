Abstract
Family caregivers are an important component of the long-term services and supports (LTSS) system. However, caregiving 
may have negative consequences for caregiver physical and emotional health. Connecting caregivers to formal short-term 
home- and community-based services (HCBS), through information resources and referrals, might alleviate family caregiver 
burden and delay nursing home entry for the patient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early impact of the Program 
of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) (established by P.L. 111-163 for family caregivers of seriously 
injured post-9/11 Veterans) on Veteran use of LTSS. A two-cohort pre-post design with a nonequivalent comparison group 
(treated n = 15 650; comparison n = 8339) was used to (1) examine the association between caregiver enrollment in 
PCAFC and any VA-purchased or VA-provided LTSS use among Veterans and (2) describe program-related trends in HCBS 
and institutional LTSS use. The comparison group was an inverse-propensity-score weighted sample of Veterans whose 
caregivers applied for, but were not accepted into, the program. From baseline through 24 months post application, use of 
any LTSS ranged from 13.1% to 17.8% for Veterans whose caregivers were enrolled in PCAFC versus from 3.8% to 5.3% for 
Veterans in the comparison group. Participation in PCAFC was associated with a statistically significant increased use of any 
LTSS from 1 to 24 months post application (over time odds ratios ranged from 2.71 [95% confidence interval: 2.31-3.17] to 
4.86 [3.93-6.02]). Support for family caregivers may enhance utilization of LTSS for Veterans with physical, emotional, and/
or cognitive conditions.

Introduction
For individuals with chronic disabling physical, emotional, and/
or cognitive conditions, long-term services and supports (LTSS) 
are critical to maintain day-to-day function and independence. 
Formal LTSS, that is, LTSS provided by a trained and paid pro-
vider or organization, comprises (1) services received in resi-
dential facilities, such as skilled nursing facilities, assisted 
living, medical foster homes, and community residential care, 
referred to as institutional LTSS, and (2) services received in the 
home, such as homemaker home health aide care, outpatient 
adult day health care, respite care, and skilled home health care, 
referred to as home- and community-based services (HCBS).
LTSS use is of great interest to policymakers given the high 
demand for and high cost of these services. In 2013, the US 
health care system (all payer sources) spent an estimated $338.8 
billion on formal (paid) long-term care.1 Government programs 
are the primary funding source for formal LTSS and account for 
>70% of dollars spent on LTSS.1,2 Of all public payers, Medicaid 
and Medicare contribute the largest proportion of funds (64.5%),

but other public sources, such as the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA), provide 7% of total LTSS spending.1,2 In 2013, VA 
spent a total of $5.6 billion on LTSS1 and will face a growing 
demand for LTSS from both aging Vietnam War era Veterans 
and the over 1 million younger Veterans of post-9/11 conflicts 
with disabilities.3,4
Despite immense government spending on formal LTSS, 
informal care, which is defined as an individual who may 
have formal clinical training, but is not employed profession-
ally to attend to the daily needs of another person,5,6 is an 
even greater source of LTSS. For the remainder of this arti-
cle, we use the term “family caregiver” to indicate a family 
member or friend who provides care to a Veteran to help with 
day-to-day function. Among older adults, receipt of informal 
care was shown to reduce the use of formal home health 
care,6-8 delay nursing home entry,7 and lower Medicare 
expenditures for both home health and skilled nursing facil-
ity care.9 However, while informal care reduces the publicly 
funded cost of LTSS, it can have negative consequences for 
the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of the fam-
ily caregivers. One review that focused primarily on caregiv-
ers of adults with dementia or illnesses, such as cancer, found 
that caregivers who spend more hours providing care are, on 
average, of lower socioeconomic status, experience more 
financial stress, feel that they had no choice in becoming a 
caregiver, and are, generally, at higher risk for experiencing 
higher levels of caregiver burden.10 Younger individuals who 
are disabled may require a family caregiver for decades; 
long-term caregiving has heightened implications for care-
giver burden and other negative outcomes, including poor 
quality care for the care recipient and financial distress.4 
Therefore, support for family caregivers including educa-
tion, health system information, financial support, and health 
care services could be critical to ensure that younger indi-
viduals with disabilities receive high-quality care over time 
in the home. Yet, over the past 15 to 20 years, national and 
state-level efforts to support family caregivers have been 
inconsistent, poorly funded, and limited to modest tax credits 
offered by a few states, poorly funded National Family 
Caregiver Support Program training and services provided 
through Area Agencies on Aging,11,12 and cash and counsel-
ing demonstration projects to pay family caregivers instead 
of a formally trained provider to meet their care needs.13,14 
Within VA, there are also national supports for caregivers, 
including a caregiver support line, peer support mentoring, 
and freely available programs to reduce caregiver burden. 
However, advocates argue that existing supports and services 
for family caregivers are not sufficient and highlight the need 
to expand these supports through paid leave policies, social 
security, expanded tax credits, and expanded Medicaid/
Medicare waiver programs.15 One example of such an expan-
sion is P.L. 111-163, Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus 
Health Services Act, which in 2010 established the Program 
of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers 
(PCAFC), the first nationwide effort to systematically 
improve care for younger Veterans who are disabled by 
providing access to a broad range of services. Specifically, 
PCAFC supports eligible caregivers of post-9/11 Veterans 
who incurred or aggravated a serious injury (including trau-
matic brain injury [TBI], psychological trauma) in the line of 
duty and require ≥6 months of ongoing care because of an 
inability to perform one or more activities of daily living 
(ADLs) and/or need supervision or protection based on 
symptoms or residuals of neurological impairment or injury. 
These caregivers are provided with caregiver skills training; 
education about VA resources and services; respite care; 
mental health services; health care for those without cover-
age, travel, lodging, and per diem to attend required training 
or the Veteran’s medical appointments; and a monthly sti-
pend ranging from $600 to $2300/month.
This program is unique because it provides a multitude of 
services and supports to family caregivers with the goal of 
improving Veteran outcomes; it therefore has the potential to 
increase the use of preferred, less expensive community-
based services versus more expensive institutional services 
which has tremendous implications for patient-, family-, and 
system-level costs. Findings from a recent evaluation of this 
program suggest that Veterans whose caregivers are enrolled 
in PCAFC have higher use of VA-purchased and VA-provided 
outpatient services, including primary, mental health, and 
specialty care, and thus may be more engaged with VA ser-
vices.16 Furthermore, previous rigorous research has shown 
that older adults who have a family caregiver receive less 
HCBS and institutional LTSS compared with those without a 
family caregiver.7-9 However, it is unclear whether there is a 
difference in use of LTSS if caregivers receive training and 
other kinds of support, such as the support provided for care-
givers enrolled in PCAFC.
The analytical objectives of this study are to describe pro-
gram-related trends in use of any VA-purchased LTSS and to 
examine whether family caregiver participation in PCAFC 
was associated with changes in any VA-provided or 
VA-purchased LTSS use. We consider trends in use for 
HCBS and institutional LTSS as secondary outcomes.
Understanding the relationship between family caregiver 
support and Veteran LTSS use is critical to develop policies 
that effectively support caregiver needs while maintaining 
access to high-quality services for Veteran care recipients. 
Therefore, while this research has important implications for 
VA policy, future results from this work may eventually 
inform national and state-level policy agendas, as federal and 
state governments grapple with how to best assist millions of 
care recipients with disabilities who reside in their communi-
ties and are cared for by emotionally and financially bur-
dened family caregivers.
Methods
Study Population and Design
The study sample comprised Veterans whose caregivers 
applied to PCAFC. Caregivers self-identified as needing 
 Shepherd-Banigan et al 
3
support to provide ongoing personal care services to the 
Veteran because, due to neurological impairment and/or 
physical injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty (eg, 
TBI, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], amputation, etc), 
the Veteran was unable to perform one or more ADLs and/or 
needed supervision or protection. Within this sample, close 
to 90% of Veterans received VA disability compensation and 
approximately 70% of the sample received compensation for 
a high level of service-connected disability (defined as 
≥70%). VA awards disability compensation to Veterans who 
are determined by VA to have a disability due to an injury or 
illness aggravated or incurred during active military service. 
A designation of 70% service-connected disability refers to 
the level of function that a Veteran has for a service-related 
condition. Common types of disabilities that result in a high 
rating for service-connected disability include physical (eg, 
musculoskeletal conditions, amputations, polytrauma) and 
cognitive disabilities (eg, TBI or PTSD).
A retrospective pre-post, nonequivalent comparison 
group design was used to evaluate the impact of the PCAFC 
on enrolled Veterans’ LTSS use. The treatment group com-
prised Veterans whose caregivers applied for and were ever 
approved to participate in the PCAFC from May 1, 2011, to 
March 31, 2014. For Veterans in the treatment group, caregiv-
ers had to be enrolled in the program for ≥90 consecutive 
days. Information about the program and how to apply is pub-
licly available through a VA Caregiver interactive website, a 
toll-free Caregiver Support Line, and through community-
based resources, including Veterans Service Organizations 
and other nongovernmental organizations. Caregiver Support 
Coordinators are located at every VA medical center, and they 
provide education and outreach to VA providers and the gen-
eral public. The nonequivalent comparison group consisted of 
all Veterans whose caregivers had applied to the PCAFC dur-
ing the same timeframe, but were determined to be ineligible. 
Caregivers were denied for several reasons that were both 
administrative (eg, not having served during the post-9/11 era 
[12%]) and clinical (eg, caring for a Veteran with an illness not 
related to military service [5%]). In all, caregivers were more 
often denied entry on the basis of administrative (n = 
4656/8339) as opposed to Veteran-related clinical (3683/8339) 
reasons. It is possible that reasons for denial from PCAFC 
would make the treatment and comparison groups less equiv-
alent; however, these applicants would have been excluded 
from our study if they did not meet the study eligibility crite-
ria described below. Veterans were excluded from this study 
if they (1) had an identification number that could not be 
matched to VA data (Figure 1); (2) were ≥66 years as of 
September 11, 2001; (3) were >68 years as of the application 
date; (4) died within 90 days of the application date; (5) had a 
non-US or non–Puerto Rico home zip code at time of appli-
cation; or (6) had a missing comorbidity score. The analytic 
cohort included 23 989 Veterans (treatment n = 15 650; com-
parison n = 8339).
Baseline was defined as the application date for each dyad 
and established the pre-post timeframe in the analytic 
models. For the treatment group, baseline was the date of 
submission of the first approved application to the PCAFC; 
comparison group baseline was defined as the date of the 
first submitted application.
Data
This study analyzed VA program data and electronic health 
records that included the use of VA-provided and 
VA-purchased care from May 1, 2010 to September 30, 
2014. Datasets were constructed by the VA Caregiver Support 
Program Partnered Evaluation Center which examined the 
impact of the PCAFC on VA and VA-purchased Veteran 
health care utilization.16
Outcomes
Any LTSS use, the primary health service outcome of inter-
est, was defined as use of any VA-provided or VA-purchased 
HCBS or institutional care within a given 6-month interval.
A secondary outcome of interest, HCBS, was defined as 
receipt of homemaker home health aide services (unskilled 
home health care), skilled home health care, adult day health 
care, hospice, or respite care services. While some hospice 
care and respite care may have taken place in an institutional 
setting, for the purposes of this report, this care is classified 
as HCBS. If a Veteran received any of the above types of care 
during the 6-month interval, the observation was coded as 1 
(receipt of HCBS) versus 0 (no receipt of HCBS). Home-
based primary care was not included as part of HCBS because 
eligibility and ongoing in-home assessments required as part 
of the PCAFC often used these service codes. As such, these 
types of services were considered to be directly related to 
routine program administration.
Institutional LTSS, another secondary outcome of inter-
est, was defined as receipt of any care in a VA skilled nursing 
facility (community living center), a community nursing 
home, State Veterans Home, or medical foster care home.17 
Medical foster care homes provide services similar to those 
offered in assisted living facilities but in a smaller home-like 
setting. If a Veteran received any of the above types of care 
during a 6-month interval, the observation was coded as 1 
(receipt of institutional LTSS) versus 0 (no receipt of institu-
tional LTSS); if a stay crossed 2- or more 6-month intervals, 
the observation was coded as 1 for each time period to reflect 
receipt of any institutional care in each interval.
Explanatory Variables
Baseline variables were used in a propensity score model to 
control for factors that may have impacted both acceptance 
into PCAFC and Veteran propensity to use LTSS (Table 1). 
These variables were defined a priori and correspond to con-
structs defined by the Anderson-Newman model of health 
service use.18 Per the Anderson-Newman model, explanatory 
variables used in the propensity score model included

demographic information (predisposing characteristics) such 
as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and marital status.18 Attributes 
affecting access to care and tendency to seek care (enabling 
resources and need) were service connection, means test 
status, enrollment priority group, distance to nearest VA 
Medical Center, homelessness, and non-VA health insurance. 
Individual comorbidities, prior health service use, and a 
comorbidity score were also included to conceptualize need.

The Nosos score, akin to a Diagnostic Cost Group score,19-21 
is a risk adjustment measure of expected use that is based on 
past diagnoses, inpatient care, outpatient care, pharmacy uti-
lization, and demographics.22
Statistical Analysis
Propensity score model and inverse probability of treatment 
weights. As the PCAFC was implemented by law, we were 
unable to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
Additional limitations, including rolling application dates, 
prevented us from using other quasi-experimental study 
designs (eg, discontinuity in calendar time) that might have 
accounted for all, including unobserved, differences between 
the treatment and comparison groups. Therefore, propensity 
score methods were determined to be the best available 
method to answer the stated research questions. To address 
observed differences, which can be seen in the large stan-
dardized differences between the treatment and comparison 
groups in the unweighted columns (Table 1), inverse proba-
bility of treatment (IPT) weights derived from propensity 
score models were constructed. While propensity score 
methods can account for observed between-group differ-
ences (see weighted columns in Table 1), they are unable to 
account for differences that are unobserved and therefore the 
primary assumption is that there are no unobserved differ-
ences in confounding variables between the treatment and 
comparison groups. To enhance observed comparability 
across the two groups, individuals in the comparison group 
were assigned weights based on how representative their 
individual characteristics were of individuals in the treat-
ment group. Individuals in the treatment group were assigned 
a weight of 1 as the outcome of interest was the average 
effect of program participation on use of any LTSS among

those in the program—in other words, the average treatment 
effect among the treated (ATT).24
To assess whether balance was achieved on observed 
baseline covariates after IPT weights were applied, the fol-
lowing were examined: (1) graphical depictions of the pro-
pensity score distribution by treatment group (to further 
improve balance, individuals whose propensity scores did 
not overlap with scores observed in the other group were 
removed from the analytical sample prior to statistical esti-
mation of outcome models [n = 186 treatment group, n = 767 
comparison group]) and (2) the standardized differences of 
each covariate between the treatment and comparison groups. 
Standardized differences are robust to sample size; a stan-
dardized difference ≤10 suggests a reasonable level of bal-
ance25 (see Table 1).
LTSS use outcome models. Generalized linear models were fit 
using generalized estimating equations weighted by the IPT 
weights with a logit link, binomial variance structure, and 
empirical sandwich standard errors to estimate the effect of 
the PCAFC over time on the probability of any LTSS use. 
The same technique was used to model the effect of the 
PCAFC over time on the probability of HCBS and institu-
tional LTSS use. In the outcome models, 6-month time inter-
vals were defined as the units of observation for each 
individual. For each individual, two 6-month intervals of 
service use data prior to the application were included as the 
“prebaseline” period. Application dates differed among care-
givers and ranged from May 2011 to March 2014; therefore, 
the number of postapplication intervals naturally varied by 
Veteran. The number of postapplication 6-month intervals 
ranged from 1 to 4; the latter representing 19 to 24 months 
after application date. Because of this, Veterans who applied 
closer to the inception of the program were assessed for more 
6-month intervals (see Table 2).
The analytical model regressed any-LTSS service use on 
PCAFC participation and 6-month time intervals. To allow 
for nonlinear trends over time, each time interval was dummy 
coded and interactions between time and treatment status 
were included at all time points. The analyses were planned 
a priori and conducted in SAS 9.4 and SAS Enterprise Guide 
7.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). The cutoff for 
statistical significance was set at P < .05. This was a quality 
improvement project for VA operations, so the project was 
considered nonresearch and, therefore, not subject to institu-
tional review board (IRB) approval.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 displays the characteristics of the unweighted and 
weighted samples classified by Veteran treatment or com-
parison group status. The columns labeled “Unweighted” 
present the preweighting baseline characteristics of treated 
(n = 15 650) and comparison (n = 8339) Veterans whose 
caregivers had applied to PCAFC, prior to incorporating pro-
pensity score weights. The large (>10) standardized differ-
ences observed in the unweighted cohort demonstrate that 
Veterans who were treated were notably different from 
Veterans who were not and indicate the need for IPT weight-
ing to account for baseline differences. In the unweighted 
cohort, the treatment group Veterans had a lower proportion 
of women (7.6% vs 10.9%) and were on average 2.4 years 
younger than Veterans in the comparison group. A higher 
proportion of Veterans in the treatment group were of white 
race and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, while a higher proportion 
of Veterans in the comparison group were of black race. 
Furthermore, a descriptively higher proportion of individuals 
in the treatment group (72.3%) was more than 70% service 
connected compared with the comparison group (64.0%) 
prior to applying IPT weights. After applying IPT weighting, 
all standardized differences were <10. The excellent balance 
indicates that the effects estimated in the multivariable anal-
ysis might approximate the unbiased ATT.
Trends in LTSS Use
The model-estimated prevalence of any LTSS use was much 
lower for individuals in the comparison group (Figure 2) fol-
lowing program application compared with those in PCAFC. 
In the first 6-month interval postapplication date, 13.1% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.5%-13.6%) and 5.3%

aApplication dates varied, so the number of outcome intervals differed per Veteran. For example, Veterans with observations at 19 to 24 months post 
application were among the first to apply and, therefore, have 2 years of eligible follow-up, whereas Veterans who applied a year after the program 
started would have 1 year of eligible follow-up.

respectively, used any LTSS (combined institutional LTSS 
and HCBS). During this same interval, 9.5% (95% CI: 9.1%-
10.0%) of treated Veterans and 2.2% (95% CI: 1.7%-2.8%) 
of comparison Veterans, respectively, used HCBS (Figure 3) 
and 4.4% (95% CI: 4.1%-4.7%) of treatment and 3.3% (95% 
CI: 2.8%-3.9%) of comparison Veterans used institutional 
LTSS (Figure 4). Examining model-estimated means, use of 
any LTSS was 7.8 percentage points higher for treated 
Veterans at 1 to 6 months, 13.5 percentage points higher at 7 
to 12 months, 9.5 points higher at 13 to 18 months, and 7.7 
percentage points higher at 19 to 24 months postapplication 
date compared with comparisons (Figure 2). Use of any 
HCBS followed a similar trend to use of any LTSS across the 
two groups (Figure 3). We found no clear patterns in the 
overall use of institutional LTSS which decreased overall, 
but not consistently through time, between application date 
and 24 months post application for both groups and ranged 
from 2% to 4.4% for both groups (Figure 4).
Modeled Association Between Program 
Participation and Any LTSS Use
Results from the analytical model suggest that participation 
in PCAFC was associated with increased use of any LTSS 
from 1 to 24 months post application. Odds ratios ranged 
from 2.71 (95% CI: 2.31-3.17) at 1 to 6 months post applica-
tion to 4.86 (95% CI: 3.93-6.02) at 7 to 12 months post 
application (Figure 2). While participants in the treatment 
group had a higher likelihood of using HCBS in 7 to 12 
months prior to application date (odds ratio: 1.54 [95% CI: 
1.08-2.18]) and no difference in 1 to 6 months prior to appli-
cation date, their participation in PCAFC was associated 
with increased use of HCBS from 1 to 24 months post appli-
cation (odds ratios ranged from 4.71 [95% CI: 3.66-6.07] at 
1 to 6 months post application to 10.30 [95% CI: 7.61-13.94] 
at 7 to 12 months post application) (Figure 3). Participants 
in the treatment group had a lower likelihood of institutional 
LTSS use in the 12 months prior to application date (odds 
ratio at 7 to 12 months prior to application 0.66 [95% CI: 
0.52-0.83] and odds ratio at 1 to 6 months prior to applica-
tion 0.75 [95% CI: 0.62-0.91]); however, individuals in the 
treatment group used more institutional LTSS at 1 to 6 
months (odds ratio 1.35 [95% CI: 1.11-1.65]) and 13 to 18 
months (1.64 [95% CI: 1.10-2.44]) post application. There 
was no difference in institutional LTSS use between the two 
groups at any other time points (Figure 4), resulting in an 
inconclusive overall effect of PCAFC on trends of institu-
tional LTSS use.
Discussion
Veterans whose family caregivers participated in PCAFC 
had significantly higher relative rates of any LTSS use 
between 1 and 24 months post application compared with

Veterans whose caregivers were not enrolled. There are sev-
eral plausible explanations for this. Due to education, train-
ing, and interaction with Caregiver Support Coordinators 
and other program staff, family caregivers enrolled in the 
PCAFC, compared with those not enrolled, may have 
become more knowledgeable about and received referrals to 
VA and community resources and services, such as respite 
care and adult day care. Also, these interactions may have 
encouraged caregivers to recognize their own need for time 
away from caregiving tasks and connected them with options 
for short-term HCBS for their Veteran.
Rates of HCBS use were consistently higher among 
PCAFC participants over time in the postapplication period. 
Institutional LTSS use was higher in some post application 
time periods, but these effects were inconsistent. This find-
ing might suggest that those enrolled in PCAFC may be 
more likely to consistently use HCBS instead of institutional 
LTSS to meet the additional care needs of the Veteran that the 
caregiver cannot meet on his or her own. Relatedly, caregiv-
ers may choose HCBS to supplement the care they provide to 
remain eligible for PCAFC benefits. This is because perma-
nent entry into institutional care would render the caregiver 
ineligible to participate in PCAFC as institutional care pro-
viders would assume the main caregiving responsibility for 
the Veteran. Given the young age of Veterans whose caregiv-
ers are enrolled in the PCAFC, from the patient and family 
perspectives, institutional LTSS might also be a less appeal-
ing source of care.
While more research is needed to understand the interplay 
between HCBS and institutional LTSS, if participation in 
PCAFC increases the use of HCBS and not institutional 
LTSS, this finding would have important implications for the 
VA. From a payer and health system perspective, use of 
HCBS is more desirable than institutional LTSS because it 
provides care in the least restrictive setting possible, the 
Veteran’s home or community, and may cost less.26 Increased 
use of short-term HCBS may be an important strategy to 
improve caregiver well-being as limited research suggests 
that caregivers who use some type of LTSS may have fewer 
psychological symptoms and reduced caregiver burden.27-29 
Furthermore, increasing the use of HCBS aligns well with 
VA’s commitment to provide patient-centered care because 
this is consistent with patient preferences to remain in the 
home30 and engaged with their families and communities.31 In 
turn, remaining in the community may facilitate long-term 
recovery for Veterans with physical, emotional, or cognitive 
conditions and disabilities resulting from their post-9/11 ser-
vice. This perspective is also consistent with the Millennium 
Act that extended the home care benefit to qualifying Veterans 
in VA and stipulated rebalancing of long-term care services 
from the institutional setting to the home.32,23 Despite VA 
policy to extend home care services, such as respite, for 
Veterans who qualify clinically, not all eligible Veterans have 
access to or use this benefit.33,34 Yet, our findings suggest that 
providing education, knowledge, and resources to family 
caregivers may help to connect eligible VA users to LTSS. 
Mechanisms to connect Veterans to high-quality, lower cost 
HCBS care may be particularly salient for the cohort of post-
9/11 Veterans whose caregivers are enrolled in PCAFC—the 
Veterans are young (mean age: 36 years) and may continue to 
need LTSS in the coming decades.35
While additional research is needed, the results from this 
analysis may have broader implications for LTSS funded by 
both other public programs and consumers. There is an 
increasing need for LTSS in younger populations. Research 
suggests that obesity and its resulting sequelae, advances in 
medical technology (which allow individuals with signifi-
cant health concerns to live longer), and the rising preva-
lence of disability among young people in the general 
population will drive up demand for LTSS. 36 Unfortunately, 
many in the civilian population face a more fragmented, dif-
ficult to navigate LTSS system than Veterans using VA LTSS. 
While the civilian and Veteran populations in need of LTSS 
differ, if trends similar to those observed in this analysis are 
also observed in the civilian population, supportive services 
for family caregivers through public and private insurers 
might improve access to formal HCBS LTSS which could, in 
turn, have positive implications for caregiver and patient 
outcomes.10,27,28
Several limitations to this study must be considered. First, 
it is possible that the statistical approach of IPT weighting 
did not address all residual unobserved confounding, includ-
ing unobserved confounding related to PCAFC eligibility 
criteria. Statistically significant baseline differences were 
observed in LTSS service use between the treatment and 
comparison groups. However, a sufficient balance on 
observed variables was achieved which suggests that resid-
ual unobserved confounding might have been minimized 
through IPT weighting.37 Second, as longer term follow-up 
was only available for those who applied close to PCAFC 
inception, effects after 24 months were not examined. Third, 
administrative data used by this study did not contain infor-
mation about patient ADLs, instrumental activities of daily 
living (IADLs), or cognitive function. Fourth, we only con-
sider use of LTSS provided or purchased by the VA health 
care system; these rates could differ across treatment and 
comparison group Veterans if we expanded our frame to 
other payers (eg, Medicaid, private pay services). Future 
research that takes a broader societal perspective, rather than 
the VA perspective, could inform the full picture of program 
impacts on LTSS.
Finally, these analyses do not capture information about 
Veteran preferences for HCBS versus institutional LTSS or 
how LTSS service use impacts critical caregiver outcomes. 
However, this analysis is part of a larger evaluation of the 
PCAFC and findings from other aspects of the evaluation 
might improve the understanding of Veteran and Veteran 
caregiver preferences for specific LTSS services. Despite 
these limitations, these analyses attempt to address an impor-
tant gap in knowledge about a high-needs Veteran population 
 Shepherd-Banigan et al 
11
with substantial rates of disability compensation through the 
use of a strong pre-post, two-cohort group design, and 
applied propensity score weights to limit observed baseline 
heterogeneity between groups.
Conclusions
These analyses are some of the first to examine the impact of 
comprehensive support for caregivers on any LTSS use and 
specific types of LTSS use (HCBS and institutional LTSS) 
among a cohort of young Veterans who were seriously 
injured in the line of duty. VA recognizes that family caregiv-
ers are already in place and committed to caring for their 
loved ones in their home environment. By engaging family 
caregivers in the VA system, caregivers can aid Veterans to 
access high-quality services that improve the quality of life 
for both the Veteran and caregiver. More research is needed 
to understand (1) the longer term impact of support for fam-
ily caregivers on Veteran LTSS use and costs, (2) Veteran 
preferences for informal versus formal care and HCBS ver-
sus institutional LTSS, and (3) the impact of supports for 
family caregivers on civilian populations that likely face a 
different set of health concerns and system supports. 
Furthermore, additional work is needed to assess how reli-
ance on HCBS versus institutional LTSS impacts family 
caregivers. If these services reduce caregiver emotional and 
financial burden, they may provide an important societal 
benefit. However, if the opposite is true, LTSS may require 
restructuring to better support family caregiver needs.
