Environmental context.
Neonicotinoids are a group of widely used insecticides that have been implicated in
the deterioration of honeybee health and the declining number of honeybee colonies worldwide. We wanted to
find out whether neonicotinoids are commonly present in pollen and honey, which are the main food sources for
bees. The results show that neonicotinoids are ubiquitous in the environment where bees foraged, and therefore
could pose risks to honeybee health.
Abstract.
It is known that honeybees are exposed to a wide variety of pesticides, including systemic neonicotinoids,
through different media. Pollen might be a better matrix for assessing exposure to neonicotinoid not only because it is the
protein source for bees, but also because pollen collected from foraging bees could help to establish the field-realistic
levels of neonicotinoids. In this study, we aimed to assess temporal and spatial variations of neonicotinoids in pollen
collected across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Monthly pollen samples and a honey sample were collected
between April and August 2013 from 62 volunteered hives and analysed for eight neonicotinoids. We utilised the relative
potency factor (RPF) method to integrate individual neonicotinoids into a single measurement of imidaclopridRPF. We
then analysed the spatial and temporal variations of imidaclopridRPF in pollen using the response profile analysis. Overall,
73 % of pollen and 72 % of honey samples contained at least one detectable neonicotinoid. We found that 49, 20 and 4 % of
pollen samples contained one, two and three neonicotinoids respectively. In honey, we detected that 57 and 15 % of
samples contained one and two neonicotinoids respectively. Neonicotinoids as a group, or imidacloprid, in pollen
exhibited no significant temporal or spatial variation, however, we found statistically significant spatial–temporal
interaction differences of imidaclopridRPF concentrations. Considering the ubiquitous of neonicotinoids in the environ-
ment and their effects on bees at the sub-lethal levels, it is prudent to identify ways to minimise the uses of neonicotinoids
in order to reduce the risk of neonicotinoid exposure to honeybees.

Introduction
It is well documented in the literature that bees are constantly
being exposed to a wide variety of pesticides. Those pesticides
that are either brought back by bees from the outside foraging
environment or applied by beekeepers for treating infectious
diseases could inadvertently harm individual bees, as well as the
whole colony. A 2010 study demonstrated the magnitude of
pesticide contamination in bee hives by analysing hundreds of
pollen, wax, foundation, brood and adult bee samples for ,120
pesticides.[1] Those convenient samples were collected cross-
sectionally from different studies and epidemiological surveys
aiming to investigate possible threats of pesticides to colony
health. Among those pesticides detected, neonicotinoid insec-
ticides, in particular imidacloprid and clothianidin, have long
been implicated and recently shown complicit in honeybee
colony collapse disorder (CCD).[2–8] Neonicotinoids, including
thiacloprid (2–115 ppb), acetamiprid (14–134 ppb) and imida-
cloprid (6–206 ppb) were found in stored pollen samples,[1] as
well as in guttation water collected from corn seeds treated with
various neonicotinoids with levels high enough to provide a
lethal dose.[9]
Pollen is an ideal matrix for assessing exposure to neonicoti-
noidsand the health risksto bees because it isthe protein source for
bees. Also, levels of neonicotinoids in pollen collected from bees
returning from foraging could help establish the field-realistic
levels that bees encountered. Most published studies analysed
either stored pollen collected from hives or pollen samples
collected from bees cross-sectionally. No study has yet been
published that demonstrates the prevalence of neonicotinoids in
the environment where bees are foraging to elucidate the temporal
and spatial variations of neonicotinoids in pollen. Because of their
systemic properties along with large number of uses around the
world, it is likely that once applied neonicotinoids would be found
throughout the environment. Therefore, the distribution of neoni-
cotinoids in the environment needs to be adequately assessed in
order to better assess the risks to bees and other pollinators. The
objective of this study is to quantify neonicotinoids in pollen
collected directly from foraging bees and honey of individual
hives across the State of Massachusetts (MA) longitudinally.
In addition, we aim to identify high-risk locations or months of
neonicotinoid exposure for bees in MA by assessing temporal and
spatial variations of neonicotinoids in pollen.

Research Paper
 Experimental
Individual beekeepers were informed about this study through
their county beekeeping associations in MA in March 2013.
Beekeepers who were interested in participating contacted us
directly, and an instruction sheet describing the protocols was
sent to individual beekeepers before pollen and honey collec-
tion. Because the amount of pollen that was collected was fairly
small, it should not have put the hive at risk of lacking pollen for
consumption. Beekeepers were asked to perform the following
tasks:
1. Choose a day in April 2013 that is most convenient for you
and the weather is warm enough for your bees to forage.
2. Install a pollen trap that we provided on the landing of the
hive (Fig. 1) and leave it there for ,60 min several days
before the planned sampling date so your bees will be used
to the pollen trap. The length of time that you need to leave
the pollen trap on the landing may vary depending upon
the traffic of foraging and the amount of pollen taken back
by your bees on the sampling day. We will only need no
more one-third of the centrifuge tube (50 mL tube) that we
provided.
3. Transfer the pollen left at the bottom of the trap to a pre-
labelled centrifuge tube, leave the tube in the prepaid enve-
lope and then send the tube back to us by the US Postal
Service immediately.
4. Repeat pollen collection in May, June, July and August 2013
on or close to the same day that you collected the pollen
sample in April (or at least separated by three weeks between
the monthly samples).
5. Collect a tablespoon of honey from the same hive that you
have been collecting pollen from, in August 2013. Transfer
honey to a pre-labelled tube and send it with the pollen
sample to us immediately.
Analytical method
Individual pollen and honey samples were analysed for eight
neonicotinoids, including acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran,
flonicamid, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid and thia-
methoxam, using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC–MS/MS) method.[10] In brief, 2 g of pollen sample
was first ground using a pestle and mortar, dissolved in 8 mL
of water, mixed with 10 mL of acetonitrile, 3 mL of n-hexane and
20 mL of isotope-labelled internal standard solution in a 50-mL
centrifuge tube and shaken for 30 s in a ShaQer 1500 SPEX
(SamplePrep, Metuchen, NJ, USA). One pack of QuEChERS salt
and one ceramic homogeniser were added to the tube, which was
shaken for 40 s, and then centrifuged (Eppendorf centrifuge
5810R, Hauppauge, NY, USA) at 5000 rpm for 4 min at 238C
room temperature.Subsequently, 1 mLfrom the acetonitrilelayer
was transferred to a 2-mL QuEChERS dispersive solid phase
extraction (SPE) vial containing 50 mg of primary–secondary
amine (PSA), 50 mg of C18 and 150 mg of MgSO4, vortexed for
30 s, and then centrifuged (Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R) at
5000 rpm for 5 min at 23 8C room temperature. We then trans-
ferred 600 mL of supernatant into a glass test tube, dried under a
gentle N2 stream, reconstituted with 200 mL of acetonitrile–water
(15 : 85, v/v), and finally 150 mL of the filtered reconstituted
solution was transferred to an auto-sampler vial for LC-MS/MS
(API 4000, AB Sciex Inc.) analysis. For honey samples, 5 g of
honey was dissolved in 10 mL of water in a shaking water bath at
408C for 10 min until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The
rest of the sample preparation procedures were the same as those
for pollen except hexane was not added. The chromatographic
separation was performed on a YMC ODS-AQ column
(100 mm � 2.1 mm, 3-mm particle size, YMC, Allentown, PA,
USA) with the mobile phase consisting of water with 5 mL of
ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic acid (mobile phase A) and
acetonitrile–water (95 : 5 v/v) with 5 mL of ammonium formate
and 0.1 % formic acid (mobile phase B), with a running gradient
of 170 mL min�1. The mass spectrometer equipped with an
electrospray ionisation source was operated in positive ionisation
mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).
The relative potency factor (RPF) method was utilised as
shown in Eqn 1 to integrate individual neonicotinoids found in a
pollen sample into a single measurement. The RPF method
normalises each neonicotinoid to imidacloprid, a reference
neonicotinoid, based on the lowest observed adverse effect level
(LOAEL, mg kg�1 BW day�1) reported by the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Imidacloprid
was chosen because it has been the most commonly used
neonicotinoid worldwide and studied in regard of its toxicity.[2–4]

The spatial and temporal variations of imidaclopridRPF in
pollen samples were analysed by conducting a response profile
analysis because of the anticipated correlation of neonicotinoid
concentrations in the monthly samples collected from the same
hive. A PROC MIXED model was used with no random effect
(Eqn 2) using SAS 9.3 (Cary NC, USA). ‘County’ was selected
as the spatial scale because of the small numbers of hives that
participated in this study. Because of the lack of specific trends
in monthly concentrations for counties, the monthly difference
of imidaclopridRPF concentrations was set to be categorical
variables with temporal effects. Norfolk County was then
chosen as the reference county in the model because complete

Results and discussion
Beekeepers from 10 out of 14 counties of Massachusetts par-
ticipated in this study. We did not have pollen samples from
hives located in Berkshire, Bristol, Franklin and Nantucket
counties. Because only one beekeeper from Dukes County
participated in this study, we merged data from this hive with the
Barnstable County hives because of its close proximity. In total,
we received 219 pollen and 53 honey samples from 62 hives.
Table 1 shows the frequency of detection of eight neonicotinoids
in the monthly pollen and honey samples. The limit of quanti-
fication (LOQ) for the neonicotinoids is 0.1 ng g�1, or 0.1 ppb,
for both pollen and honey samples, except the LOQs for
flonicamid in pollen and honey are 0.5 ng g�1.[10] Overall,
73 % of pollen and 72 % of honey samples contained at least
one detectable neonicotinoid insecticide. We detected that 49,
20 and 4 % of pollen samples contained one, two and three
neonicotinoids respectively. In honey, we detected that 57 and
15 % of samples contained one and two neonicotinoids
respectively. There is no statistically significant difference of
neonicotinoid concentrations in pollen collected in different
months, suggesting the ubiquity of neonicotinoids in pollen
from April to August in MA.
Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of neonicotinoids in
pollen and honey samples. Consistent with previous reports,
imidacloprid was the most commonly detected neonicotinoid in
both pollen and honey samples in this study, whereas no samples
were detected with flonicamid. We found that 124 (57 %) and 28
(53 %) pollen and honey samples contained detectable imida-
cloprid residue, or a total of 56 % of 272 samples. The highest
imidacloprid concentration was 43.1 ng g�1 (ppb) in a pollen
sample collected from Suffolk County, a mostly urban commu-
nity, and 14.7 ng g�1 (ppb) in a honey sample collected from
Plymouth County, a semi-rural community. The second most
commonly detected neonicotinoid in both pollen and honey
samples was dinotefuran for which the highest concentration of
14.5 ng g�1 (ppb) was found in a sample collected from
Hampshire County, a rural community located in western MA.
We calculated the relative-potency adjusted imidacloprid, or
imidaclopridRPF, of each sample to reflect not only the overall
exposure to neonicotinoids in honey and pollen that bees
brought home from the environment, but also the cumulative
toxicity of each neonicotinoid, as defined by the LOAEL.
Table 3 shows the RPFs that are applied to each individual
neonicotinoid before summing up to generate imidaclopridRPF.
Nitenpyram was excluded from the calculation because of the
lack of LOAEL data. However, this exclusion should not affect
the final results substantially because nitenpyram was only
detected in nine pollen samples. The RPF approach has been
applied to assess health risks associated with exposures to a

Distribution of neonicotinoids in pollen and honey
C
 mixture of chemicals with similar chemical structures and
toxicological endpoints, such as dioxin[11] or polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons,[12,13] and it is appropriate for use in this
study to assess the exposure and risk of systemic neonicotinoids
to bees. The concentrations of imidaclopridRPF tended to be
close to those of imidacloprid, but were higher when either
thiacloprid or thiamethoxam was detected because both neoni-
cotinoids are considered more toxic with higher RPFs than
imidacloprid. Several notable high imidaclopridRPF concentra-
tions were found in pollen samples collected from the counties
of Worcester (4.2 ng g�1) in April, Hampshire (5.5 ng g�1) in
May, Essex (19.9 and 276.1 ng g�1) in June and August and
Suffolk (43.1 ng g�1) in July of 2013.
Table 4 shows the monthly average of imidaclopridRPF
concentrations across Massachusetts from April to August in
2013. The distributions of imidaclopridRPF concentrations of
individual hives, as well as aggregated based on the counties
across Massachusetts, are shown in Figs 2 and 3 respectively.
The relative size of individual pies corresponds to the total
imidaclopridRPF concentrations, and the proportion of each pie
illustrates the monthly contributions to the total imidaclopridRPF
with different colours for each hive. The highest monthly
average imidaclopridRPF concentrations varied by county,
except for Essex County which had the highest monthly average
imidaclopridRPF concentrations in June and August 2013. There
was no statistically significant difference of spatial (county) or
temporal (month) variation in imidaclopridRPF concentrations
(Table 5), suggesting bees are constantly being exposed
to neonicotinoids in pollen and nectar during the foraging
seasons in Massachusetts. Overall, the average imidaclopridRPF
concentrations among counties were not significantly different
(P ¼ 0.84), nor were the average imidaclopridRPF concentrations
in different months (P ¼ 0.17). However, we found statistically
significant spatial–temporal interaction of imidaclopridRPF con-
centrations in hives located in the counties of Worcester in April
(P , 0.001), Hampshire (P , 0.001) and Worcester (P , 0.01)
in May, and Suffolk (P , 0.05) in July, compared to Norfolk
County, as shown in Table 5. Those significant spatial–temporal
interaction effects were consistent with data shown in Table 4 in
which the highest imidaclopridRPF concentrations were found in
Worcester County in April, in Hampshire County in May, and in
Suffolk County in July. This finding suggests that those counties
in certain months pose significant risks to bees as a result of high
neonicotinoid residues found in pollen. Although the model
showed an elevated Essex–June interaction term of 24.67
(Table 5), it was driven mainly by an extremely high imidaclo-
pridRPF and the corresponding standard error which is also large
(15.5). Therefore, the interaction term was not able to reach
significance.
We also analysed imidacloprid concentrations in pollen for
temporal and spatial variations separately in order to determine
if there were any trends associated with specific neonicotinoid
pesticides rather than the whole group of neonicotinoids com-
puted as imidaclopridRPF. Fig. 4 shows the distributions of
average imidacloprid concentrations in pollen collected in
different months from 10 counties across Massachusetts. The
results of spatial and temporal variation analyses of imidaclo-
prid are consistent with those of imidaclopridRPF, including the
statistical significance of spatial–temporal interaction of imida-
cloprid concentrations in pollen collected from hives located in
certain counties of certain months.
A comparable study has demonstrated that bees living and
foraging near cornfields in Indiana are being exposed to neoni-
cotinoids in several ways throughout the foraging seasons.[14]
During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thia-
methoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced
during the planting of neonicotinoid-treated maize seeds. When
maize plants reached anthesis, maize pollen that was collected
directly from bees using a pollen trap from treated seed was
found to contain clothianidin and thiamethoxam, ranging from
non-detectable to 88 mg g�1 and non-detectable to 7.4 mg g�1
respectively. If data reported by Krupke et al.[14] represent the
scenario for pollen contaminated by neonicotinoids used in
agriculture, data collected in MA might reflect neonicotinoids
in pollen collected from non-agricultural sources because only a
few beehives were set up near agricultural land. The attempt to
quantitatively define the ‘field-realistic’ neonicotinoid levels in
the environment that bees would be exposed to is a foreseeable
challenging task without the knowledge of the land use of the

Distribution of neonicotinoids in pollen and honey
E
 area where bees forage. If the field-realistic levels of neonico-
tinoids were to exist, it would likely encompass 4–5 orders of
magnitude of concentrations. The data reported in the published
studies, as well as presented in this study, would support this
conclusion. Regardless, it is evident that the ubiquity of neoni-
cotinoids in pollen collected from foraging bees reflects the
common uses of neonicotinoids in non-agricultural settings.
As demonstrated in recent studies conducted either in labo-
ratory settings or in the natural environment, the levels of
neonicotinoids that we measured in pollen samples have signifi-
cant implications for honeybee health. In brief, honeybees
exposed to imidacloprid or clothianidin at levels ranging from
0.5 to 30 ppb[15] or 0.15 to 3 ng bee�1 day–1 [16,17] could lead to
CCD, a systematic disease still lingering in many countries after
its first occurrence in the winter of 2005–2006. Adult worker
bees exposed to imidacloprid, clothianidin or thiamethoxam at
levels as low as 0.02 ppb would have difficulty performing
normal foraging activities.[18–24] Sub-lethal exposure to aceta-
miprid, imidacloprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, fipronil, thia-
cloprid
or
thiamethoxam
could
lead
to
developmental
impairments, including poor colony growth at levels of 2–5
ppb,[25,26] olfactory learning at levels as low as 0.1 mg bee�1 of
acetamiprid,[18,27–29] behavioural and cognition–neurological
learning at a level of 0.45 ng bee–1[30–33] and increasing
susceptibility to pathogens at levels of 0.7 ppb of imidacloprid
and 0.1 mg kg�1 of thiacloprid.[34–37]
There are several limitations associated with this study. First
of all, data reported here only represent a very small fraction of
honeybee hives established in 10 counties across the state, and
therefore may not be representative of the true distribution of
neonicotinoids in pollen or honey in Massachusetts. Second,
neonicotinoid levels in the monthly pollen samples during the
foraging season might not be adequate to assess temporal
variations of neonicotinoids. Bees are likely to forage in differ-
ent areas within a month that would have an effect on the levels
of neonicotinoids in pollen. Because the procedure of pollen
collection using the trap is fairly easy for beekeepers and the
amount of pollen needed for neonicotinoid analysis is very
small, it is plausible to collect pollen from foraging bees of
the same hive more frequently in order to better characterise the
spatial and temporal distributions of neonicotinoids. Third, the
spatial and temporal variation analysis was not applicable to
neonicotinoid residues in honey because we only collected one
honey sample from each hive in August. Seeing as there are
many factors that could affect the levels of neonicotinoids in
stored honey inside the hive, the monthly honey samples may
not reflect the true spatial and temporal variation. Lastly, the use
of the LOAEL as the basis of calculating imidaclopridRPF may
be a reasonable approach for estimating the aggregate neonico-
tinoid exposure by pollen ingestion, but one should be cautious
when interpreting the cumulative risks in bees. Depending upon
the selection of health end-points in relation to sub-lethal
exposure to each individual neonicotinoid, the LOAEL might
not be the same for different health end-points, such as the
inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), as
shown in published studies.[15–37]
In this study, we used an innovative approach to assess the
overall neonicotinoid exposure in bees in a longitudinal setting
by quantifying the temporal and spatial variations of imidaclo-
pridRPF levels in the monthly pollen samples that we collected
from foraging bees. We found more than 70 % of pollen and
honey samples contained at least one neonicotinoid, and the
neonicotinoids in pollen exhibited no significant temporal or
spatial variation during the foraging seasons in Massachusetts.
However, we found statistically significant spatial–temporal
interaction differences of imidaclopridRPF concentrations in
pollen collected in certain months when neonicotinoids are
present in the areas where bees foraged. The spatial–temporal
interaction of imidaclopridRPF is independent of the settings of
communities (or county) where pollen samples were collected.
The ubiquity of neonicotinoids in states such as Massachusetts
where the planting of neonicotinoid-treated crops only repre-
sents a very small fraction of overall agricultural activities

 suggests that non-agricultural uses of neonicotinoids is likely
the main contribution to the levels found in pollen and honey
that bees brought back to their hives. Considering various sub-
lethal effects of neonicotinoids on bees, it is prudent to identify
ways to reduce the uses of neonicotinoids in order to reverse the
deteriorating trends in honeybee health and the declining num-
bers of honeybee colonies.
