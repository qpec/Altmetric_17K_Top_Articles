Abstract 
20 
The present study compared the effects of two weekly-equalized volume and relative load 
21 
interventions on body composition, strength and power. Based on individual baseline 
22 
maximal strength values, eighteen recreationally trained men were pair-matched and 
23 
consequently randomly assigned to one of the following experimental groups: a low volume 
24 
per session with a high frequency (LV-HF, n = 9) group who trained 4-days (Mondays, 
25 
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays) or a high volume per session and low frequency (HV-LF, 
26 
n = 9) group who trained 2-days (Mondays and Thursdays). Both groups performed two 
27 
different routines over 6 weeks. Participants were tested pre- and post- intervention for 
28 
maximal strength, upper body power, fat-free mass, limb circumferences and muscle 
29 
thickness. Compared to baseline values, both groups increased their fat-free mass (HV-LF 
30 
+1.19 ± 1.94; LV-HF +1.36 ± 1.06 kg, p<0.05) and vastus medialis thickness (HV-LF 
31 
+2.18±1.88, p<0.01; LV-HF +1.82±2.43 mm, p<0.05), but only the HV-LF group enhanced 
32 
arm circumference (1.08±1.47cm, p<0.05), elbow flexors thickness (2.21±2.81 mm, P<0.01) 
33 
values and decreased their fat mass (-2.41 ± 1.10, P<0.01). Both groups improved (p<0.01) 
34 
the maximal loads lifted in the bench press (LV-HF +0.14 ± 0.01; HV-LF +0.14 ± 0.01 
35 
kg.body mass-1) and the squat (LV-HF +0.14 ± 0.06; HV-LF 0.17 ± 0.01 kg.body mass-1) 
36 
exercises as well as in upper body power (LV-HF +0.22 ± 0.25; HV-LF +0.27 ± 0.22 
37 
watts.body mass-1) Although both training strategies improved performance and lower body 
38 
muscle mass, only the HV-LF protocol increased upper body hypertrophy and improved body 
39 
composition.

Introduction 
44 
Resistance training (RT) is recommended as one of the most effective methods to 
45 
improve muscle mass, strength and power (Kraemer et al. 2002; Panton et al. 2000). An 
46 
appropriate control of training variables, such as intensity, volume, and frequency is 
47 
considered essential to optimize post-exercise muscular adaptations (Kraemer and Ratamess 
48 
2004). One of these essential variables, the frequency of training, refers to the number of 
49 
sessions performed in a given period of time (Wernbom et al. 2007). With respect to inducing 
50 
muscle hypertrophic effects, the frequency of training is often considered as the number of 
51 
times a muscle group is trained and it is generally associated with a one-week training 
52 
duration (Schoenfeld et al. 2015).  
53 
In their position statement, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM, 2009) 
54 
recommends a RT frequency of 4 (intermediate training) to 6 days (advanced training) per 
55 
week using upper/lower body split routines. However, individuals targeting muscular 
56 
hypertrophy commonly train each muscle every 5 to 7 days using one to maximally three 
57 
muscle groups per session. Compared to the ACSM (2009) recommendations, this results in a 
58 
relative higher session training volume (Gentil et al. 2017; Kerksick et al. 2009; Ostrowski et 
59 
al. 1997). The strategy is based on suggestions that a muscle which is subjected to a greater 
60 
session training volume, is consequently also exposure to a higher level of intramuscular 
61 
metabolic stress (Gotshalk et al. 1997; Schoenfeld 2010). To elicit an enhanced hypertrophic 
62 
effect, this stress response in turn requires several days to recover (Ferreira et al. 2017; 
63 
Schoenfeld et al. 2016). Along these lines, relevant research also indicates that multiple-set 
64 
programs (i.e. a higher volume per training session) are generally associated with greater 
65 
strength (Krieger 2009) and hypertrophy (Krieger 2010) gains in both, trained and untrained 
66 
individuals. Moreover, recent data have shown that the training volume is a substantial 
67 
contributor to muscle hypertrophic effects, which occurs independently of training load when 
68

the total volume per session is equated (Klemp et al. 2016). However, twice (Schoenfeld et 
69 
al. 2016) or higher (Dankel et al., 2017) weekly training frequencies have recently been 
70 
suggested to promote superior hypertrophic outcomes, considering a volume-equated 
71 
program is performed. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that even though increasing 
72 
the number of weekly sessions may provide greater muscle growth, it may be difficult to 
73 
increase the training frequency without an appropriate adjustment of training volume and 
74 
length of training program (Dankel et al. 2017). 
75 
 In novice individuals, similar outcomes were obtained from single and split body 
76 
routines using a volume equalized weekly training (Arazi and Asadi 2011; Candow and 
77 
Burke 2007; Gentil et al. 2015). In contrast, experienced weight lifters have demonstrated to 
78 
obtain superior improvements in body composition and strength gains using multiple (i.e. 3 
79 
sessions) compared to a single weekly volume equated training session (McLester et al. 
80 
2000). It should be noted that the total weekly volume used by McLester and colleagues was 
81 
lower (i.e. 3 sets per muscle group) than the typical routine employed in bodybuilding, which 
82 
commonly involves between 6 to 12 sets per muscle group performed in a single session 
83 
together with a greater than once a week training frequency (Schoenfeld et al. 2016).  
84 
The purpose of the present study, therefore was to compare the effects of two weekly-
85 
equalized volume and relative load interventions on body composition, strength and power 
86 
gains using two different protocol designs whereby one group trained twice weekly (low 
87 
frequency) with a high volume per session and a second group performed four weekly 
88 
training sessions (high frequency) with a low session volume.

Methods 
90 
Experimental Design 
91 
The study utilized a two-parallel group randomized controlled trial design. 
92 
Participants were randomly allocated into two intervention groups: 1) Low Training Volume 
93

5 
 
and High Weekly Frequency group (LV-HF; n = 9) and 2) High Training Volume and Low 
94 
Weekly Frequency group (HV-LF, n = 9). Before and after the intervention period, 
95 
measurements of body composition, muscle thickness, strength and power performance were 
96 
assessed. Both groups trained for a total 6 weeks, which were equated for total training 
97 
weekly volume and relative load, whereby the only difference comprised the weekly training 
98 
frequency (2 vs. 4) and the session volume (high vs. low). 
99 
Participants 
100 
Presented as mean (SD) the final group characteristics were as follows: LV-HF: age 
101 
21 (3.2) years, height: 180.40 (4.8) cm, and body mass: 76.63 (14.72) kg; 1 repetition 
102 
maximum (1RM) squat: 103 (25.65) kg; 1RM bench press 77 (25.79) kg; RT experience 3.0 
103 
(0.5) years. HV-LF: age 28 (7.9) years, height: 178.6 (6.7) cm, and body mass: 79.38 (14.22) 
104 
kg; 1RM squat: 115 (31.7) kg; 1RM bench press 71 (15.57) kg; RT experience 2.9 (0.4) 
105 
years. No significant differences were observed between treatments at baseline.  
106 
To be eligible, participants had to be free of injury in the last three months prior to the 
107 
intervention. They were furthermore required to train regularly between 2 to 3 times per 
108 
week, using a whole-body routine including squat and bench press exercises for a minimum 
109 
of two and a maximum of 5 years before the start of the present study. Only recreationally 
110 
trained individuals with no regular participation in other sports, including bodybuilding, 
111 
power or weight lifting were recruited. Additionally, only individuals not having ingested 
112 
ergogenic aids or any type of nutritional supplements affecting muscular performance 12 
113 
weeks or longer prior to the start of the study were eligible. Participants were instructed not 
114 
to change their nutritional habits, and if any relevant change had been detected (i.e. becoming 
115 
a vegetarian, restricting calories, taking nutritional supplements, etc.) participants’ data would 
116 
have been excluded from the analysis. The University Research Ethics Committee approved 
117 
the study (no. UREC/15/3/5/16). All procedures were in accordance with the Helsinki

declaration. Prior to providing written informed consent, participants were fully informed of 
119 
the nature and risks of the study. 
120 
Procedures 
121 
Familiarization period: Before the start of the intervention and over a one-week 
122 
period, participants performed 3 sessions of familiarization where the correct execution of the 
123 
main training exercises (e.g. bench press and squat) and testing procedures was explained, 
124 
demonstrated and strictly controlled. After the familiarization but within a one-week period 
125 
strength and body composition tests were performed. Thereafter, the participants were 
126 
assigned to one of the two interventions by block randomization, using a block size of two.  
127 
Assessments: Participants refrained from heavy exercise in the 48 h prior to all pre- 
128 
and post-intervention tests. Baseline and post intervention values of all relevant variables 
129 
were tested within one day and in the following order 1) body composition 2) limb 
130 
circumferences 3) muscular thickness measurements 4) 1RM bench press 5) 1RM parallel 
131 
squat, 6) bench press power at 50% of the previously determined 1RM. Fifteen minutes of 
132 
rest was allowed between the performance assessments. 
133 
Body Composition: Standard measurements were performed in accordance with the 
134 
recommendations for anthropometric assessment (Ross and Marfell-Jones 1991). To 
135 
eliminate inter-observer variability only one investigator consistently performed all 
136 
measurements. Height was measured in a stretched stature to the nearest 0.01m using a wall 
137 
mounted stadiometer (Seca GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and body mass was weighted to the 
138 
nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale (Seca GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).  
139 
Fat mass and fat-free mass was estimated from the whole body densitometry using air 
140 
displacement via the Bod Pod® (Life Measurements, Concord, CA) and followed the 
141 
manufacturer’s instructions as detailed elsewhere (Dempster and Aitkens 1995). Briefly, the 
142 
participants were tested wearing only tight-fitting clothing (swimsuit or undergarments) and 
143

an acrylic swim cap. Volunteers wore the exact same clothing for all body composition tests. 
144 
The thoracic gas volume was estimated using a predictive equation integral to the Bod Pod® 
145 
software. To estimate body composition, the calculated value for body density was taken 
146 
from the Siri equation (Siri 1961). A complete body composition measurement was 
147 
performed twice. If the percentage of body fat was within 0.05%, the two tests were 
148 
averaged. If the two tests were not within that agreement, a third test was performed and the 
149 
average of the three trials was used for all body composition variables.  
150 
Limb Circumferences: The circumferences of the right arm and thigh were measured 
151 
using a constant tension tape measure during maximal elbow extension or standing position 
152 
respectively. Three measurements were made for both arm and thigh circumference. 
153 
Averaging was performed to obtain mean values for both circumferences. Mid arm 
154 
circumference was measured midway between the tip of the acromion and the olecranon 
155 
process (Heymsfield et al. 1982) and the thigh circumference was determined at a point 
156 
situated two thirds between the edge of the iliac crest and the proximal border of the patella 
157 
(upper knee) (Bielemann et al. 2016). 
158 
Muscle thickness: A real time B-mode ultrasound system (Dynamic Imaging, 
159 
Livingston, Scotland UK) was used to capture cross-sectional images at three sites (dominant 
160 
side) of the body: (i) elbow flexors, comprising biceps brachii and brachialis, (ii) anterior 
161 
deltoids, and (iii) vastus medialis. A trained independent blinded researcher performed all the 
162 
measurements in a standardized manner and according to the protocol described by (Bradley 
163 
and O’Donnell 2002). Each participant was placed in a semi-recumbent and relaxed position 
164 
with knees fully extended and arms held straight alongside the torso with a supination 
165 
position of the lower arms. The measurement sites were accurately located and marked at 
166 
60% distal to the lateral humerus epicondyle from the scapular acromial process for brachii 
167 
and brachialis muscles; at the acromion anterolateral edge for the anterior deltoid muscle; and 
168

at a distance of 80% distal from the greater trochanter to the lateral femur condyle for the 
169 
vastus medialis muscle. A 7.5-MHz linear transducer together with water-soluble 
170 
transmission gel (Aquasonic 100 Ultrasound Transmission gel), which provided acoustic 
171 
contact without depressing the dermal surface, was placed in the transversal plane 
172 
perpendicular to the skin surface at each of the marked sites. Distortion of tissue due to 
173 
excessive compression was eliminated by resting the transducer lightly on the skin surface, 
174 
by visually monitoring the image on the ultrasound screen and by asking participants to 
175 
provide verbal feedback on the amount of skin pressure experienced. The interfaces between 
176 
subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle and between muscle and bone were identified from 
177 
the ultrasonic image and the distance from the adipose tissue-muscle interface to the muscle-
178 
bone interface was measured as representative of muscle thickness. 
179 
The location of the probe was recorded onto acetate paper and pre- and post- 
180 
intervention images were compared during the measurements to ensure that the location was 
181 
the same based on identifiable markings (moles and small angiomas) viewed in the muscle 
182 
fascicles as reference points. This was done to increase the reliability of repeated measures. 
183 
Three images of each location were obtained and the average of the measurements was 
184 
calculated. Furthermore, to ensure the intra-observer reliability of the muscle thickness, the 
185 
same researcher evaluated all participants. Images were obtained at least 48 hours before and 
186 
after the training intervention to avoid any intra-muscle swelling. The intra-rater reliability of 
187 
muscle thickness measurements performed by the trained investigator on the same scans in a 
188 
preparatory study was excellent, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of >0.980 (95% 
189 
confidence intervals of 0.986 to 0.995). Therefore, the thickness measurements on the three 
190 
analyzed muscles at pre- and post- intervention could be compared confidently. 
191 
Strength: The 1RM value for both the bench press (BP) and parallel squat (SQ) using 
192 
free weights was determined according to the methodology described by McGuigan (2016) 
193

(see supplementary material for further explanation). To avoid any specific muscle group 
194 
interaction, the order of BP and SQ tests was randomized. Additionally, each participant 
195 
followed the same assessment order at the pre- and post- intervention time point.  
196 
Upper body power determination: The maximal upper body power value was 
197 
measured for the BP exercise using 50% of the previously determined 1RM value. 
198 
Participants were required to perform 5 repetitions with a maximal possible movement 
199 
velocity and using a correct technique. Muscular power was determined from the repetition 
200 
that produced the maximal average accelerative mechanical power (calculated from the 
201 
accelerative portion of the concentric phase, during which the acceleration of the barbell was 
202 
≥ -9.81 m.s-2. 
203 
An optical rotary encoder (Model WLEN01, Winlaborat®, Buenos Aires, Argentina,) 
204 
with a minimum lower position register of 1 mm connected to the proprietary software (Real 
205 
Speed Version 4.20) was used for measuring the position and for the calculation of the 
206 
average mechanical power in watts achieved during the five BP repetitions. The cable of the 
207 
encoder was connected to the bar in such a way that the exercise could be performed freely 
208 
while it allowed the cable to move in both directions of the movement.  
209 
The test-retest reliability coefficients (ICCs), coefficient of variation (CV) and 
210 
standard error of measurement (SEM) for the 1RM BP; 1RM SQ and BP power at 50% were 
211 
0.95 (2.1%; SEM 3.12) 0.92 (1.1%; SEM 2.11) and 0.90 (2.5%; SEM 23.08) respectively. 
212 
Training Intervention: The two intervention groups (LV-HF and HV-LF) underwent a 
213 
6-week RT program aimed to improve muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy. Each group 
214 
performed two training routines involving 9 exercises per session. Routine 1 was designed to 
215 
target pectorals, deltoids and arm flexors while routine 2 focused on back, arm extensor and 
216 
lower body (Table 1).  
217 
Table 1

The LV-HF group trained 4 times per week (Mondays and Thursdays routine 1; 
219 
Tuesday and Fridays routine 2) whereby the HV-LF group trained 2 times per week 
220 
(Mondays routine 1 and Thursdays routine 2). Consequently, both groups completed the same 
221 
number of total sets per exercise and routine per training week (Table 2). To equate the 
222 
exercise effort, all participants regardless of group performed a minimum of 8 to a 12 self- 
223 
determined maximum repetitions (Steele et al. 2017) per set with a load ~75% of the 
224 
estimated 1RM with 2 min of rest between sets (de Salles et al. 2009). If participants became 
225 
aware that they could not reach the minimum number of prescribed repetitions per set, an 
226 
additional ~30 sec of rest within the set was allowed to reach the lower target number of 
227 
repetitions. Conversely, a minimum amount of load (2.5kg) was added to the subsequent set 
228 
if participants felt that they could perform more than 12 repetitions per set. Participants were 
229 
instructed to perform the concentric phase of every exercise with the maximal possible movement 
230 
velocity from the beginning of each set and during the entire session. All training sessions 
231 
were supervised and instructed by a qualified research assistant. To improve the quality of 
232 
supervision, a ratio of one instructor to three participants was maintained during all training 
233 
sessions. All participants completed the 6 weeks of intervention with a full compliance to 
234 
both training routines. All sessions were completed within ~45 minutes or ~105 for the LV-
235 
HF or HV-LF respectively.  
236 
Table 2 summarizes the volume and relative load used per training session and week 
237 
for both intervention protocols.

Statistical Analysis 
240 
A descriptive analysis was performed and subsequently the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and 
241 
Shapiro-Wilk test were applied to assess normality. Sample characteristics at baseline were 
242 
compared between groups using an independent means Student`s t-test. All pre- and post- 
243

11 
 
data were summarized and reported as mean (standard deviation) unless stated otherwise. 
244 
Raw changes in all outcome variables were calculated by subtracting pre minus post 
245 
assessment values. Under the assumptions that both conditions would promote changes from 
246 
baseline values and that the amount of change would be also dependent on each individual’s 
247 
enrolment performance levels, one-way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models were 
248 
used to compare differences in raw change between groups, using the pre assessment values 
249 
as covariates. Confidence intervals (CI) of the adjusted differences were calculated and 
250 
plotted. Those CIs not crossing zero were considered statistically significant. Additionally, 
251 
two-tailed one sample student’s tests were used to test for a null effect hypothesis. Effect 
252 
sizes of the adjusted differences between intervention groups were assessed converting eta 
253 
squared from the ANCOVA effects to Cohen’s d-values and compared to common 
254 
benchmarks (Cohen 1988) (small d = 0.2-0.49; moderate d = 0.5-0.79; and large d = ≥0.8). 
255 
Significance level was set to p < 0.05, but p values between 0.05 and 0.1 were considered 
256 
indicative of a trend. Stata (version 13.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for 
257 
statistical analysis. 
258 
Results 
259 
The pre- and post- values of the analyzed variables are depicted in table 3. 
260 
Furthermore, the changes and the adjusted 95% CI are included for each of the intervention 
261 
groups.

Differences from the baseline 
264 
Only the HV-LF produced positive changes in body composition, as both total and 
265 
relative amount of fat and fat-free mass decreased and increased respectively (Figure 1A and 
266 
B), while body mass remained relatively stable. The LV-HF group demonstrated a positive 
267 
change in fat-free mass only when expressed in kg (mass) but not as percentage. Although

both groups significantly increased vastus, medialis thickness (Figure 1D), only the HV-LF 
269 
condition showed significant increases in arm circumference (Figure 1C) and elbow flexors 
270 
thickness (Figure 1D). 
271 
Different from the body composition outcomes, both groups produced similar 
272 
significant improvements in the absolute and relative strength and upper body power values.

Comparison between groups 
278 
No main significant differences were observed between groups. However, the HV-LF 
279 
group showed a large effect size (>0.80) for increasing body mass and absolute 1RM bench 
280 
press at post intervention (Table 3). 
281 
Discussion 
282 
The main finding of the present study indicates that both training designs using a high and a 
283 
low weekly training frequency comprising the same weekly RT volume are effective in 
284 
improving fat-free mass and performance in recreationally resistance trained individuals. 
285 
Even though, no significant differences favoring one of the two used strategies were observed 
286 
at post intervention, the HV-LF design seems to be more effective to enhance body mass (p = 
287 
0.054, d= 1.08) and upper body strength (p = 0.067, d = 0.89). Although the trend to increase 
288 
1RM bench press disappears when results are normalized by body mass, it seems that the 
289 
HV-LF protocol produces a better stimulus for increasing body mass in this population. 
290 
Moreover, along with a trend to increase anterior deltoids thickness the HV-LF group showed 
291 
significant positive changes in the reduction of fat mass, as well as in the increase of fat-free 
292 
mass (Figure 1A), arm circumference (Figure 1C), vastus medialis and elbow flexors 
293

thickness (Figure 1D) (Table 3). The analysis of the individual changes revealed that almost 
294 
all participants but one allocated in the HV-LF group showed a consistent decrease in fat 
295 
mass. Conversely, the participants included in the LV-HF demonstrated a more 
296 
heterogeneous response with 5 decreasing fat mass, 2 increasing and 2 showing no changes. 
297 
Reasons for discrepancies can be attributed to the different patterns of response in RT 
298 
between individuals as well as the lack of a strict control of the diet habits. Additionally, the 
299 
higher metabolic stress associated with the HV-LF protocol represent an important stimulus 
300 
for adaptations within skeletal muscle necessary to create an enhanced anabolic response 
301 
(Burd et al. 2010; Buresh et al. 2009). High volume routines have also been associated with 
302 
greater acute post training increase of testosterone (Smilios et al. 2003) and growth hormone 
303 
(Mulligan et al. 1996) concentrations. Thereby increasing the potential of facilitating muscle 
304 
tissue remodeling including a higher energy demand for supporting the recovery process 
305 
(Schoenfeld et al. 2016). 
306 
Only a few controlled trials investigated the effects of RT frequency on muscular 
307 
adaptations. (Candow and Burke 2007) compared the effects of frequency between 2-days 
308 
and 3-days weekly volume equated training in a cohort of untrained individuals. Conversely, 
309 
after 6 weeks, no differences in muscle strength or lean body mass (as assessed by DXA) 
310 
were identified between conditions. The aforementioned study included a gender mixed 
311 
sample of 6 men and 29 women and consequently the influence of gender on lean mass gain 
312 
could have affected results. Arazi and Asadi (2011) who also used untrained individuals, 
313 
found similar results after an 8-week equalized-volume intervention comparing 1-day vs. 2-
314 
days vs. 3-days weekly training volume as no significant differences amongst experimental 
315 
groups on maximal strength were identified. Similarly, Gentil et al. (2015) in untrained 
316 
individuals showed that after a 10-week equalized training volume, which compared a 1-day 
317 
vs. 2-days weekly frequency, no differences between groups in terms of changes in muscle 
318

 Draft
14 
 
mass and strength were identified. In contrast and using well-trained individuals, McLester et 
319 
al. (2000) demonstrated that strength gains in a low frequency condition (1-day/week) were 
320 
less than 62% of that achieved by a higher frequency (3-days/week) protocol over a 12-week 
321 
training period. Moreover, differences for lean body mass accretion also favored the high 
322 
frequency routine (~8% for 3-days and ~1% for 1-day weekly training routines). It is likely, 
323 
that the apparent discrepancies in findings between the aforementioned investigations were 
324 
subject to the different training status of participants as only McLester et al. (2000) used 
325 
trained individuals.  
326 
Results from the present study suggest that in recreationally resistance trained males, 
327 
a twice-weekly training involving two different high-volume routines each performed once a 
328 
week seems to elicit slightly superior changes in body composition. It is conceivable that 
329 
early-phase adaptations in less-well trained individuals are less sensitive to alterations in 
330 
frequency and that benefits reach more notable differences with a progressively higher 
331 
training level. Indeed, a meta-analysis by Rhea et al. (2003) found that well-trained 
332 
individuals require a greater number of weekly training sessions to maximize strength gains. 
333 
Moreover, the low frequency condition implemented by McLester et al. (2000) involved only 
334 
one session per week while the low frequency protocol implemented by Candow and Burke 
335 
(2007) comprised two weekly training sessions. Thus, in novice or recreationally trained 
336 
individuals, it could be hypothesized that a frequency of two weekly training sessions 
337 
represents a threshold beyond which further increases may not yield additional benefits, 
338 
without manipulating other variables, particularly the relative load or the overall weekly 
339 
volume. 
340 
The present results demonstrate greater increases in upper body muscle thickness with 
341 
a lower weekly RT frequency. Our findings contrast with McLester et al. (2000) who 
342 
identified greater improvements with a 3-weekly training frequency. Besides the 
343

 Draft
15 
 
aforementioned issue of training level, the discrepancies in findings may partially be 
344 
attributed by the differences in study designs. McLester et al. (2000) employed the same 
345 
exercises each training session and participants were tested using the same exercises pre- and 
346 
post- intervention. Furthermore, different from our study in which ultrasound measurements 
347 
were conducted, McLester and colleagues estimated body composition through the use of the 
348 
3-skinfold-site Jackson and Pollock equation and limb circumferences. Our study was 
349 
designed to mimic the typical split-body routines used by resistance trained enthusiasts and 
350 
thus exercises for each muscle group were rotated on a session to session basis each week. 
351 
Even though this strategy provides sufficient recovery and avoids fatigue accumulation 
352 
throughout the weekly routines in the major muscle groups (pectorals, back and lower body), 
353 
for muscles such as biceps and triceps which act as synergists during several multiple-joint 
354 
exercises, the training frequency was higher e.g. 4 (two as agonist and two as synergist) and 2 
355 
(one as agonist and two as synergist) for the LV-HF and HV-LF groups respectively. 
356 
Nonetheless, considering that the HV-LF group showed a more robust increase in muscle 
357 
mass, the training frequency was still lower than three times per week. Moreover, McLester 
358 
et al. (2000) utilized a 12-week intervention period, whereby the present study implemented a 
359 
shorter, i.e. a 6-week duration.   
360 
 
Compared to a single set protocol, multiple sets per exercise sessions result in 
361 
significantly greater metabolic stress (Gotshalk et al. 1997). Consequently, higher volume 
362 
sessions can elicit a greater anabolic stimulus and hence require a longer recovery phase to 
363 
enhance the hypertrophic response and adaptations to RT. While not reaching statistical 
364 
significance between groups, this might have contributed to our findings of a more effective 
365 
HV-LF training strategy. The suggestion that increasing the number of sets performed per 
366 
session, rather than increasing the training frequency, is a more effective strategy to increase 
367 
muscle size is in contrast to others (Dankel et al. 2017). Nonetheless, regardless how the 
368

https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/apnm-pubs

 Draft
16 
 
weekly volume is distributed over 1 or 2 sessions, it is important to highlight that all 
369 
participants in the present study regardless of the protocol, performed 6 or more than 10 sets 
370 
per week involving the action of vastus medialis or elbow flexors respectively. Even though 
371 
these figures are in the line with the recent recommendations of >5 to 9 (moderate) and >9 
372 
(high) weekly sets per muscle group for maximizing muscle mass increase (Schoenfeld et al. 
373 
2017), the LV-HF protocol was not effective to significantly increase elbow flexors 
374 
thickness. The lack of consistent responses opens an avenue for future research that 
375 
investigates whether an increased training frequency while maintaining a similar weekly 
376 
volume, does indeed results in greater muscle hypertrophy or strength gains. 
377 
The present study had several limitations that must be considered when attempting to draw 
378 
evidence-based inferences. Firstly, the low sample size of 9 participants included in each 
379 
experimental group could increase the risk of type 2 error. Nonetheless, the presented effect 
380 
size analysis reduces the risk of misinterpretation and suggests potential changes, which need 
381 
to be confirmed in future studies. Furthermore, the study period lasted only 6 weeks and 
382 
although this period was sufficient to achieve significant increases in muscular strength and 
383 
hypertrophy for both groups, it is possible that results between groups could have diverged 
384 
with a longer implemented intervention protocol. Secondly, a high degree of inter-individual 
385 
variability was noted between participants, which limited the ability to detect significant 
386 
differences in several outcome measures. Third, measurements of muscle thickness were 
387 
obtained only at the middle portion of the muscle. Although this region is often used as a 
388 
proxy of overall growth of a given muscle, research indicates that hypertrophy manifests in a 
389 
regional specific manner, with greater gains sometimes seen at the proximal and/or distal 
390 
aspects (Wakahara et al. 2012). Proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon include exercise 
391 
specific intramuscular activation and or tissue oxygenation saturation (Miyamoto et al. 2013). 
392 
The possibility therefore exists that different changes in proximal or distal muscle thickness 
393

 Draft
17 
 
may have occurred in one condition vs. the other, which would have gone undetected. It is 
394 
also important to highlight that diet was not controlled but participants were instructed to 
395 
maintain their diet habit. Although nutritional changes were consistently monitored, 
396 
providing a prepared and pre-packed diet to participants during the intervention would have 
397 
offered an ideal scenario to standardize and control the influence of diet on the present 
398 
results. 
399 
From a practical point of view, provided that the total weekly training volume 
400 
approaches a total of 9 exercises targeting 3 or 4 muscle groups (including the action of 
401 
synergist muscles during multi-joint exercises) per session (= 36 per the entire training 
402 
session), similar outcomes would be obtained by performing the entire training routine once a 
403 
week or splitting the volume into two separate sessions over the same week. Nonetheless it is 
404 
noteworthy that for recreationally resistance trained individuals using a HV-LF strategy over 
405 
a short intervention period (i.e. 6 weeks) might be a better (day saving) option to induce 
406 
hypertrophic effects and overall positive changes in body composition. At this point it is 
407 
interesting to highlight that those who can only commit to short sessions, spreading out the 
408 
volume over a LV-HF protocol might be an appropriate consideration.  
409 
In conclusion, over a 6-week period, both weekly-equalized volume protocols, HV-LF and 
410 
LV-HF were similarly effective to improve performance, fat-free mass and lower body 
411 
muscle mass. However, only the HV-LF group was effective for enhancing upper body 
412 
hypertrophy and reducing fat mass in recreationally resistance-trained males.
