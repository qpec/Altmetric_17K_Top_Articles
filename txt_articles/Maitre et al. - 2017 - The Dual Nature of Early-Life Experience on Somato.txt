In Brief
Maitre et al. show that the degree of
prematurity at birth determines the extent
of attenuated brain responses to touch.
This directly depended on the quality of
touch experiences, even when controlling
for prematurity and analgesics. Perinatal
experiences shape the somatosensory
scaffolding of later perceptual, cognitive,
and social development.

SUMMARY
Every year, 15 million preterm infants are born, and
most spend their first weeks in neonatal intensive
care units (NICUs) [1]. Although essential for the sup-
port and survival of these infants, NICU sensory en-
vironments are dramatically different from those in
which full-term infants mature and thus likely impact
the development of functional brain organization [2].
Yet the integrity of sensory systems determines
effective perception and behavior [3, 4]. In neonates,
touch is a cornerstone of interpersonal interactions
and sensory-cognitive development [5–7]. NICU
treatments used to improve neurodevelopmental
outcomes rely heavily on touch [8]. However, we un-
derstand little of how brain maturation at birth (i.e.,
prematurity) and quality of early-life experiences
(e.g., supportive versus painful touch) interact to
shape the development of the somatosensory sys-
tem [9]. Here, we identified the spatial, temporal,
and amplitude characteristics of cortical responses
to light touch that differentiate them from sham stim-
uli in full-term infants. We then utilized this data-
driven analytical framework to show that the degree
of prematurity at birth determines the extent to
which brain responses to light touch (but not sham)
are attenuated at the time of discharge from the hos-
pital. Building on these results, we showed that,
when controlling for prematurity and analgesics,
supportive experiences (e.g., breastfeeding, skin-
to-skin care) are associated with stronger brain re-
sponses, whereas painful experiences (e.g., skin
punctures, tube insertions) are associated with
reduced brain responses to the same touch stimuli.
Our results shed crucial insights into the mecha-
nisms through which common early perinatal experi-
ences may shape the somatosensory scaffolding of
later perceptual, cognitive, and social development.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In a large cohort of 125 preterm (24–36 weeks’ gestational age
[GA]) and full-term (38–42 weeks GA) infants before discharge
from the hospital, we recorded high-density 128-channel elec-
troencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs)
to calibrated light touch (see Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures for full exclusion criteria and Table S1 for subject char-
acteristics). Parents consented prior to testing using Vanderbilt
IRB-approved protocols. Participant data on hospitalizations
and experiences were extracted from medical and nursing re-
cords. Cumulative nociceptive exposure was measured, as in
seminal work in this field, ‘‘in the absence of an empirical basis
for assigning weights to every procedure’’ [10, 11]. All surgical
procedures involved the use of opioids, whereas non-surgical
procedures involved oral sucrose administration, per unit proto-
cols. The cumulative number of positive tactile experiences was
measured in the absence of empirical evidence that one type of
stimulus is more positive than another or that one duration is
more optimal than another [10, 11]. Only touch with the purpose
of providing supportive and positive tactile experience for the in-
fant beyond usual nursing care was recorded.
Characterization of Full-Term Responses to Light Touch
We first objectively characterized full-term infants’ brain re-
sponses to light touch (Figure 1A) compared to the sham stim-
ulus (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Fifty-five
full-term infants (median GA: 39.5 weeks; 49% female) were
tested at a median of 2 post-natal days (range 1–3 days). To
characterize temporal and topographic responses, we applied
a normative approach wherein brain activity of full-term infants
was presumed to reflect typical tactile processing. These
analyses were implemented with Cartool freeware [12]. We first
1048

 compared ERPs as a function of time across the entire electrode
montage. We only considered as reliably ‘‘tactile’’ those time in-
tervals when >10% of the electrode montage exhibited a signif-
icantly different response from that to the sham stimulus for a
minimal duration of 40 ms (non-parametric randomization test
at each time sample of the ERP; p < 0.05; temporal extent >
40 ms) [13]. This analysis identified the 184–500 ms post-stim-
ulus interval as showing differential responses to touch versus
sham in full-term infants (Figures 1B and 1C).
Because it cannot be assumed that this entire period reflects
a singular brain process that is stable over time, we next sub-
mitted the group-averaged ERP data from full-term infants in
response to touch and sham stimuli to a hierarchical topo-
graphic cluster analysis [14]. This process identified time inter-
vals of stable ERP topography, a data-driven manner to
identify the series of ERP components. This data-driven
approach identified four time windows comprising distinct
ERP topographies in response to touch: (1) 171–240 ms, (2)
241–340 ms, (3) 341–400 ms, and (4) 401–500 ms (Figure 1D).
Using the time intervals of these components and the loci of
topographic maxima (fronto-central scalp sites F3/F4, C3/C4,
and F7/F8; Figure 1E), we derived mean amplitudes at a subset
of electrodes used in all subsequent analyses. This provided
an objective validation of the choice of electrodes used in
our (and others’) prior studies of tactile processing [4, 15–
17], allowing the convergence of our data-driven approach
with existing methodological knowledge.
Characterization of Preterm Responses to Light Touch
The above results obtained from full-term infants served as a
normative framework within which to compare the brain
responses to touch by preterm infants (N = 61; median GA =
31 weeks, range 24–36; 51% female; median age at time of
EEG recording = 28 post-natal days, range 2–103, or 36 weeks
post-menstrual age, range 35–43). The mean amplitude values
for each time interval of stable ERP topography described above
were compared between full-term and preterm infants using Wil-
coxon rank-sum tests. Two time windows demonstrated differ-
ences (Table 1; Figure 2), as measured using the selected subset
of electrodes identified objectively above. Full-term infants’
cortical responses to light touch were of higher amplitude in
the 171–240 ms window than those of preterm infants (0.67 mV
difference; confidence interval [CI] 0.45–1.09 mV; p < 0.001).
Next, we compared the topographic distribution of the ERPs
from full-term and preterm infants to determine whether differ-
ences were due to changes in the active configuration of brain
circuitry [14]. This was achieved by quantifying and analyzing
global dissimilarity between the topography of ERPs, indepen-
dent of their strength. Global dissimilarity equals the square
root of the mean of the squared differences between the poten-
tials measured at each electrode (versus the average reference),
each of which is first scaled to unitary strength by dividing by the
instantaneous global field power (i.e., the standard deviation
across the electrode montage). This measure can range from
0 to 2, with 0 meaning that topographies are identical and 2
meaning that topographies are inverted. It is therefore directly
converted to correlation (i.e., spatial correlation equals 1 minus
the squared value of global dissimilarity divided by 2). Global
dissimilarity was statistically tested here using non-parametric

 randomization. Effects were considered reliable if p % 0.05 and if
also temporally sustained for R40 ms.
Combining these topographical and temporal amplitude ana-
lyses, we confirmed the presence of differential responses to
touch (but not sham) between the two groups as early as the
P2 component (171–240 and 241–340 ms) (Table 1 and Figure 2).
Infants’ responses to median nerve stimulation over this period
have been previously linked with their neurodevelopmental out-
comes at 18 months [18]. Our analytical framework revealed that
brain responses to touch in our cohort of preterm infants prior to
discharge from the NICU not only were of significantly lower
amplitude but also differed in their topographic distribution rela-
tive to full-term infants (Figures 2A–2C). No attenuation of the
sham response was seen between preterm infants, and no cor-
relation was present between amplitude/response to sham and
degree of prematurity, underlining the possible specificity of
our results to touch.
Prematurity can contribute to these differences in somatosen-
sory functional activity via altered postnatal experiences, inter-
ruptions in the normal sequence of brain maturation by preterm
birth itself, or interactions between the two [9, 12]. In animal
models, somatosensory map formation via thalamocortical
afferent axon organization [19] is initiated at both full-term and
preterm birth and appears to be experience independent.
Studies of human infants’ auditory systems, however, show
that postnatal experience does not appear to compensate for
immaturity at birth during the first months of life [20]. In our cur-
rent cohort of preterm infants, the amplitude of responses to
touch in the 171–240 ms time window increased by 0.08 mV
(p < 0.001) for each week of GA (sham responses did not). GA
and postnatal days were strongly correlated (r2
(59) = �0.757,
p < 0.001). Therefore, we used the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and likelihood ratio tests to summarize overall model fits
and identify independent effects [21]. A model with both GA
and postnatal days accounted for significantly more variance
in the amplitude of light touch responses than postnatal days
alone (AIC 323 versus 329; p = 0.004). Conversely, including
the number of postnatal days did not enhance the fit of the model
with GA alone (AIC 323 versus 321, p = 0.58). Thus, preterm in-
fants cared for in NICUs exhibit decreased touch responses
when they are discharged home compared to full-term infants,
and these decreases are proportional to their degree of immatu-
rity at birth. This finding may superficially contrast observations
[22] that somatosensory responses to a non-noxious stimulus
appeared equivalent between term and term-equivalent preterm
infants. However, Slater et al. used stimuli �29–145 times stron-
ger than ours, which in all likelihood activated deep pressure
receptors (Pacinian corpuscles). While processing of deep
pressure as measured in central locations may be typically
developed at term equivalent in preterm infants, more complex
processing of light touch in frontal and central locations appears
to still be attenuated.
Associations between Painful and Supportive
Experiences in the NICU and Touch Response in
Preterm Infants
While the number of postnatal days was not strongly associated
with amplitude of touch response, length of stay is an imprecise
surrogate for multiple components of intensive care, which could
potentially impact somatosensory development. In particular,
painful experiences are associated with childhood problems in
somatosensory function and socio-emotional development [9].
Conversely, developmental care approaches (e.g., Newborn
Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program)
often include varied tactile components purported to improve
neurodevelopmental outcomes [8] but rarely studied in associa-
tion with quantitative changes in somatosensory processing.
Therefore, we next determined dose-response associations
between either positive tactile experiences (beyond usual nursing
care) or painful procedures, as well as the tactile ERP amplitudes
in preterm infants at the time of discharge from the NICU (related
to Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S1). All
analyses were performed with and without the inclusion of minor
surgical procedures without a change in conclusions. Supportive
tactile experiences were associated with increased amplitude of
cortical responses to light touch, even when controlling for GA
and postnatal days (r2
(110) = 0.177; p < 0.001). Additionally, we
provide the first demonstration that nociceptive exposures
are associated with decreased amplitude of cortical responses
to light touch after controlling for variations in GA and PND

 (r2
(110) = 0.153; p = 0.002). In preterm infants, painful exposures
may have a negative impact on typical processing of non-painful
tactile stimuli. The preterm cohort had no known conditions
associated with severe illness (necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis,
severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, abnormalities on cranial
imaging). Between birth and time of EEG recording, the preterm
infants had a median of 32 (range 10–103) painful procedures
and a median of 4 (range 0–46) supportive tactile experiences,
with no discernible associations between these two types of
experiences. This cross-modal association between exposure
to pain and attenuated light touch response supports previous
findings showing that repeated exposure to painful procedures
is associated with decreased responses across multiple other
modalities (e.g., temperature [23]) and systems (e.g., autonomic
nervous system [24]).
Sensory processing throughout infancy and early childhood
enables learning from experiences and constitutes a foundation
for the construction of higher-level perceptual and cognitive rep-
resentations. Among the sensory systems, the somatosensory
system is the earliest to develop, with physiological responses
first observable at 14 weeks of gestational age and detectable
cortical responses at 24 weeks [3, 4]. The somatosensory sys-
tem mediates biological and social interactions with the mother
[7] during early life and thus scaffolds the development of other

 sensory systems (e.g., vision, hearing). However, objective and
quantitative metrics of the consequences of an early-life NICU
experience on light touch—including those associated with
medical procedures and even potentially therapeutic interven-
tions—were previously missing.
Our collective results now extend the current understanding
of the development of the somatosensory system and its sus-
ceptibility to the quality of early-life experiences. The emer-
gence of evoked brain activity alongside the disappearance of
unstructured and spontaneous ‘‘neural bursts’’ is considered
an index of the maturation of neural circuits across sensory sys-
tems [25, 26]. In the case of the human somatosensory system,
this shift occurs at 35–37 weeks GA [11], with discrimination of
different types of somatosensory inputs (e.g., nociceptive
versus touch) perhaps maturing along a similar trajectory [11].
The case could have been made that a greater amount of any
somatosensory experience would have resulted in an enhanced
response to somatosensory stimuli, thus compensating for
immaturity
at
birth
through
amount
of
experience.
This
appeared to be the case for deep-pressure processing [22].
However, in the case of complex processing of light touch,
our results suggest that repeated painful experiences in early
life attenuate the formation of later typical responses, perhaps
through cross-modal inhibition established from non-specific
neuronal bursts to both light touch and to nociception. Previous
work has also demonstrated that nociceptive experiences can
alter the perception of multiple somatosensory modalities
(pain, touch, temperature) at the site of a procedure or in other
parts of the body [23]. These findings, along with observed long-
term dysesthesias of preterm infants undergoing surgical
procedures [23], also argue in favor of cross-modal interactions
at both peripheral and central levels. Individual modalities within
the somatosensory system may be differentially affected by
maturation, experience, and the complexity of connections
between modalities.
One limitation of this study was that controlling for opiate use
was infeasible, as all infants undergoing painful procedures
received some form of analgesia. Recent evidence supports
conventional anesthetics and sucrose as both contributing to
altered brain maturation [27–29]. Additional analyses were con-
ducted in the preterm infants that considered cumulative total
opiate exposure. In particular, we examined the robustness of
the significant associations between GA and ERP amplitude of
touch response (Table 2) and associations of pain and touch
with ERP amplitudes, controlling for postnatal days and GA (Fig-
ure S1). Results of these analyses are consistent with pain being
significantly associated with ERP response to light touch after
accounting for opiate exposure. The reported association with
total supportive touch exposure was unchanged when control-
ling for cumulative opiate exposure (see Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures). Together, our results support the hypothe-
sis that exposure to painful procedures in preterm infants, even
when analgesics are used to mitigate pain and when sucrose is
used as a sedative to mask the behavioral expression of pain,
may contribute to attenuated responses to non-noxious tactile
stimuli at discharge to home.
With respect to painful procedures themselves, our study
faced the same challenges as groundbreaking work in the field:
we could not quantify the intensity of each painful stimulus—EEG
data on each experience throughout the entire hospital stay for
each infant would have been infeasible due to methodological
(EEG nets are not designed for infants <30 weeks post-men-
strual age [PMA]) and time (interrupting care to measure intensity
of stimulus) limitations. Behavioral manifestations of pain would
have been difficult to prospectively collect on an hourly basis and
are not always reliable in preterm infants. Furthermore, our study
was limited in its focus on the processing of pain in the brain and
did not address the subjective and emotional experience of pain.
Similarly, our analysis of supportive tactile experiences was
limited by feasibility considerations, such as controlling for indi-
vidual variations in nursing handling and parent education; we
relied instead on the consistent and extensive training—dissem-
inating knowledge-base and following protocols—implemented
by nursing leaders and the intent to provide support, rather than
the behaviors elicited in response to support.
The results of our study have important clinical implications for
infants cared for in NICUs and for those aiming to improve their
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current efforts aim to minimize
the number and intensity of painful procedures, especially
through non-pharmacological pain management [30]. Concur-
rently, family-centered initiatives and therapeutic interventions
may remedy the relative paucity of supportive tactile experi-
ences, a common problem in referral center NICUs, where geog-
raphy, socioeconomic conditions, and support systems impact
parents’ direct involvement with their infants [31, 32]. Simulta-
neously, our study raises concerns with regard to subjectively
inferring positive or negative experiences for infants hospitalized
in the neonatal period without first examining their impact on
brain processing. However, regardless of these concerns, a
greater one remains: infants currently discharged to their homes
from NICUs have decreased cortical processing of touch
compared to their full-term counterparts. This creates an altered
learning scaffold for motor, tactile, and multisensory exploration
of the environment and self, as well as for social-emotional

thresholds are associated with worse cognitive, motor, and lan-
