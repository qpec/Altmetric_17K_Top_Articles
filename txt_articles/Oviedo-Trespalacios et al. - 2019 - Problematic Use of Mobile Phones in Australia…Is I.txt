Rapid technological innovations over the past few years have led to dramatic changes
in today’s mobile phone technology. While such changes can improve the quality of life
of its users, problematic mobile phone use can result in its users experiencing a range of
negative outcomes such as anxiety or, in some cases, engagement in unsafe behaviors
with serious health and safety implications such as mobile phone distracted driving. The
aims of the present study are two-fold. First, this study investigated the current problem
mobile phone use in Australia and its potential implications for road safety. Second, based
on the changing nature and pervasiveness of mobile phones in Australian society, this
study compared data from 2005 with data collected in 2018 to identify trends in problem
mobile phone use in Australia. As predicted, the results demonstrated that problem
mobile phone use in Australia increased from the first data collected in 2005. In addition,
meaningful differences were found between gender and age groups in this study, with
females and users in the 18–25 year-old age group showing higher mean Mobile Phone
Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) scores. Additionally, problematic mobile phone use was
linked with mobile phone use while driving. Specifically, participants who reported high
levels of problem mobile phone use, also reported handheld and hands-free mobile
phone use while driving.

INTRODUCTION
The use of smartphones has continued to amplify over the years, with the total number of
smartphone users worldwide projected to surpass the 2.5 billion mark in 2019 (1). In Australia,
approximately 88% of the population owns a smartphone, thus making Australia one of the
foremost adopters of such technology (2). Other Western countries such as the United States of
America, for instance, have found approximately 64% of its population to use a smartphone as of
2017 (3). Additionally, in developing countries such as India, smartphone ownership rates were
expected to reach 36% by 2018 (4), and 46.1% in Sub-Saharan Africa by the end of the same
year (5). Such high ownership rates in Australia and across the globe can be attributed to scale
manufacturing practices, socio-economic factors, and advancements in technology over the years.

Problematic Mobile Phone Use
Mobile phone devices are now commonly referred to
as “smartphones,” as they offer greater functionality and
numerous gratifications over and above traditional phones (6).
Initially designed for basic functionalities such as calling and
texting, smartphones have significantly changed to now include
engagement in a wide range of activities such as navigating
social media (e.g., Instagram R
�), browsing the internet, and
playing games, all in one device (7, 8). As social media and
other applications are primarily accessed via smartphones,
communication is often viewed as the most prevalent use of
smartphones today (8, 9). Thus, one would expect such a
powerful piece of technology to have struck a chord within the
community and have a tremendous social impact on modern
society, particularly among populations with the highest use such
as young people (8). For the purposes of this paper, and from
here on out, the term “mobile phone” was used when referring
to “smartphone.”
Benefits of Mobile Phone Technology
Mobile phones serve plenty of beneficial uses, some of which
have the potential to increase an individual’s quality of life.
According to Burckhardt and Anderson (10), quality of life
is determined by five dimensions: material and physical well-
being, relationships with other people, social, community and
civic activities, personal development and fulfillment, and
recreation. Based on these dimensions, one can assert that
mobile phones promote physical well-being through helping
users access help in the case of an emergency, and encourages
users to form and maintain relationships with others (e.g.,
family or partners) via social media networks (11). Mobile
phones can also promote engagement in social, community and
civic activities, enabling users to support social causes such
as reducing fuel consumption while driving (12), in addition
to promoting personal development and fulfillment through
offering users a plethora of information on a variety of topics
(via websites, apps). Finally, mobile phones can also help users
engage in recreational activities through games and music.
While such research highlights the positive contribution made
by mobile phones to modern society, problematic or excessive
mobile phone use can alternatively contribute to an array of
adverse outcomes.
Negative Consequences of Mobile
Phone Use
Negative and adverse outcomes associated with problematic
mobile phone use have caught the attention of researchers around
the world. Most of the research in this area continues to assume
that some individuals are having maladaptive relationships with
their mobile phone devices. This phenomenon is evident in
cases wherein certain individuals were reported to have endured
feelings of stress or separation anxiety when they were unable
to use their phone (13, 14). In addition, some individuals have
also expressed difficulties in disconnecting from smartphone
use particularly due to its utility and usefulness in filling gaps
during the performance of mundane tasks (15). According to
(11), problematic or excessive mobile phone use refers to an
individual’s inability to control their usage of their mobile
phone which, in turn, leads to adverse consequences in their
everyday life. On a personal level, such consequences may
relate to financial problems, sleep disturbances, attentional and
learning impairments in educational settings, excessive sedentary
behavior, and the deterioration of personal relationships (11, 16–
20). It should also be noted, however, that although certain
parallels do exist between addiction/dependency syndromes and
excessive mobile phone use, this paper will refrain from referring
to this behavior as “addictive,” as the core symptoms are vastly
different from classically recognized and defined addictions such
as substance-use disorders or gambling (6, 21). Nonetheless, it is
apparent that in some instances excessive use of mobile phones
can be problematic, with greater or more frequent use creating
higher functional impairments (21).
When an individual uses a mobile phone in physically
hazardous situations, such use can be considered extremely or
highly problematic. The use of a mobile phone while driving,
for instance, is an example of problem mobile phone use as it
falls toward the end of the mobile phone use spectrum or, in
other words, creates more serious health and safety implications.
Greater problematic mobile phone use is apparent in Australia,
with 61% of active Australian drivers having reported using
their mobile phone while driving despite the unlawfulness and
dangers surrounding this behavior (22). Another example is
using a mobile phone while crossing the road. Research shows
that at least a quarter of pedestrians cross the road while engaged
in visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing
on a mobile phone (23). Given the increasing risks of phone
use while walking, some jurisdictions (Honolulu; Mont Clair;
Stamford) now prohibit the use of mobile phones while using
cross-walks (24).
Additionally, due to the advanced functionality of mobile
phones, an increase in usage may also result in individuals being
subjected to security issues such as location tracking, access
to personally identifiable information (through software apps),
and mobile malware, all of which can increase users risks of
falling victim to identity theft or robbery (25). Similarly, as
the capabilities of mobile phones continue to increase, certain
individuals may be more prone to abusing functions offered by
these devices (e.g., Freemium games) and developing addictive
behaviors such as pathological gambling (26).
Problem Mobile Phone Use: Scales
and Questionnaires
The need to study these potentially negative impacts of mobile
phone misuse has required the development of a number of
tools to identify maladaptive mobile phone use. Specifically,
a range of psychometrically sound scales/questionnaires has
been developed to measure problematic mobile phone use. The
Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire [PMPUQ; (27)]
was developed to measure problematic phone use based on four
factors: prohibited use, dangerous use, dependence symptoms,
and financial problems associated with its use. Additionally, the
Problematic Cellular Phone Use Questionnaire [PCPU-Q; (28)] is
another scale that has been developed to measure problematic cell
phone use based on the taxonomies of substances use dependence
(e.g., symptoms, functional impairment). However, one of the
pioneering tools used in this area of research, the Mobile
Phone Problem Use Scale [MPPUS; (29)], has ubiquitously

Problematic Mobile Phone Use
been used in the literature for many years. According to (29)
problem mobile phone use in the MPPUS is measured based on
potential predictors of behavioral and technological addiction.
The MPPUS considers issues involving tolerance, withdrawal,
craving, negative life consequences (e.g., social, financial), and
escaping from other problems. This scale has demonstrated high
levels of validity and reliability [α = 0.93; 26; α = 0.94; (30)],
has been used in several studies across different countries, and
is considered to be a highly useful tool in measuring a universal
score of problematic mobile phone use (11).
The Present Study
Since the development of the MPPUS in 2005, countries around
the world have witnessed the speed at which mobile phone
technology has changed over the past decade. Hence, it is of
utmost importance to revisit and update the literature, in order
to determine whether problematic mobile phone use has become
a pervasive issue in today’s world. Currently, there is a gap in the
literature regarding the current trends of problem mobile phone
use in Australia. In addition, it is also unclear whether problem
mobile phone use, as originally defined by Bianchi and Phillips
(29), has changed since 2005. Thus, in order to address these gaps
in the literature, the present study has two main objectives:
• The first objective is to investigate the current problem mobile
phone use in Australia and its potential implications for
road safety.
• The second objective is to use the original 26 study to
identify trends of change related to mobile phone misuse in
the Australian population. This time comparison is relevant
given the changing nature of mobile phones and growing
pervasiveness of mobile phones in Australian society.
In comparisons of samples collected in 2005 and 2018, it is
expected that the proportions of the sample reporting high levels
of problem mobile phone use has increased from the first data
collected in 2005. The following sections describe the methods
used in this study.
METHODS
Participants
The present study included a total of 709 participants (365
males and 344 females). Participants’ ages ranged between 18
and 83 years, with the highest number of participants (n = 135;
19%) belonging to the 56–65 year-old age group (see Table 1).
Based on eligibility criteria, all participants were aged 18
years and over, resided in Australia and owned/used a mobile
phone. Participants also reported their level of education, with
the majority having completed or were currently enrolled in
university (n = 473; 66.7%), followed those by who completed or
were currently enrolled in TAFE (n = 114; 16.1%), finished year
12 high schooling (n = 79; 11.1%), and completed junior year 10
high schooling or equivalent (n = 43; 6.1%).
With the aim to generate a wide and large sample,
potential participants were recruited throughout Australia
using various methods, including a Queensland University
of Technology (QUT) media release, social media ads on

Measures
The present study utilized the 27-item Mobile Phone Problem
Use Scale [MPPUS; (29)] as the main tool of analysis. Items in
the MPPUS (29) assess symptoms of behavioral and technological
addiction such as issues of tolerance, escaping from problems,
withdrawal, craving, and negative life consequences (e.g.,
financial, work, social, and family). In addition, the MPPUS (29)
also consisted of items that examined loss of control over mobile
phone usage (e.g., “I find it difficult to switch off my mobile
phone”), time spent on mobile phone-related activities, and social
motivational aspects of mobile phone use (e.g., “All my friends
own a mobile phone”). Participants responded to questions on
a 10-point Likert-type scale, ranging from “not at all” (1) to
“extremely true” (10).
The MPPUS (29) was validated based on moderately strong
positive correlations reported between the scale and other
measures of mobile phone use such as self-reported time spent
using the mobile phone during the week, average monthly
expenditure, and the number of calls made to people on a regular
basis. In addition, good construct validity for the scale was also
determined based on moderate correlations found between the
MPPUS (29) and the MMPI-2 Addiction Potential Scale [APS;
(31)], an established scale known for measuring addiction.
In addition to the MPPUS, participants were asked about
their handheld and hands-free mobile phone use while driving
a moving vehicle based on scales designed for this study.
The questions pertained to the frequency with which they
performed visual-manual interactions (e.g., “You performed a
visual manual task on your mobile phone”; α = 0.81) and hands-
free conversations (e.g., “You had a phone conversation using
an in-car audio system or Bluetooth”; α = 0.76) while driving.
Participants responded to questions on a 7-point Likert-type
scale, ranging from “never” (1) to “always” (7).

Problematic Mobile Phone Use
Data Analysis
Problem Mobile Phone Use in the 2018 Sample
The data analysis plan was designed to meet two objectives, the
first objective being to investigate the current problem mobile
phone use in Australia and its potential implications for road
safety. To meet this objective, the following steps were taken.
Firstly, the reliability and validity of the MPPUS (29) were
analyzed to understand the current psychometric properties.
As explained earlier, the MPPUS was designed and validated
in Australia by Bianchi and Phillips (29). However, societal
and technological changes surrounding mobile phone use in
the last 10 years necessitates confirmation of the psychometric
properties, factorial structure and internal consistency of the
MPPUS (29). To assess the factorial structure, a statistical
technique known as an exploratory factorial analysis was
conducted (via principal components analysis) to replicate the
analysis in the original study. According to Grant & Fabrigar
(32), this analysis is often used to reduce data by analyzing the
relationship between many variables through a small number
of factors. Finally, the reliability of the MPPUS was evaluated
using measures of internal consistency by means of Cronbach’s
alpha coefficient.
Secondly, the psychometric properties of the MPPUS were
confirmed: the prevalence, user categories, and cut-off points
in the MPPUS were determined following the methodology
developed by de-Sola et al. (30). Specifically, four categories
were created: 5% of mobile phone users are problem phone
users, 15% are at risk of being problem users, 65% are regular
phone users, and 15% are occasional phone users. Differences
by sex, age, education level, and mobile phone distracted driving
among phone user categories were studied using ANOVA and
correlation analyses.
Thirdly, the influence of socio-demographic and mobile
phone
distracted
driving
factors
on
the
user
categories
was studied using logistic regression, a statistical analysis
which involves determining the probability of an outcome
through its relationship to one or more predictors (33).
The statistical model predicted associations with two user
categories: normal phone users (the sum of casual and
habitual
and
regular
users)
and
users
with
problematic
phone
usage
(including
the
sum
of
at
risk
users
and
problem users).
Problem Mobile Phone Use Comparisons Between
2005 and 2018 Samples
The second objective was to use the original Bianchi and Phillips
(29) study to identify trends of change related to mobile phone
misuse across the Australian population. To meet this objective,
differences between the 2005 and 2018 MPPUS samples in
Australia were calculated. An item-level analysis was conducted
using the Mann-Whitney U test. This nonparametric test is
used to compare two independent samples (34). In this study,
the Mann-Whitney U test was used to establish differences
between the 2005 and 2018 samples by age and gender. Four
age groups were defined: 18–25 years, 26–35 years, 36–45 years,
and 46+ years. These groups were chosen due to the small
number of participants aged 46+ in the 2005 study. Additionally,
to illustrate changes in the prevalence of larger responses over
time, the percentage of participants who marked a value of 6 or
higher in each item was calculated for each age and gender and
compared. Statistical analyses were conducted through the IBM
SPSS Statistics software (version 23).
RESULTS
Problem Mobile Phone Use in the
2018 Sample
A Retest of the MPPUS Validity and Reliability
in Australia
First, a principal component analysis was conducted to validate
the factorial structure of the MPPUS. During the analysis, Item
4 “All my friends own a mobile phone” was removed as it
had a factor loading <0.4, while the other 26 items had factor
loadings above 0.4. More recent applications of the MPPUS have
also confirmed the poor performance of item 4 (35). Although
the final solution showed three factors (explained variance of
62.25%), it was confirmed that there is a single factor “Problem
mobile phone use” that compiles the 26 items of the MPPUS
(explained variance of 49.88%). The unidimensionality of the
MPPUS has been supported in the previous Australian study (29)
and its replications in Britain (36) and Spain (35). The Kaiser–
Mayer–Olkin index (KMO = 0.96) confirmed the adequacy of
the sample, while Bartlett’s test of sphericity (χ2
(325) = 13,028.39;
p < 0.001) supported the use of the factor analytic procedure.
Five items (Item 15, Item 17, Item 25, Item 26, and Item 27)
had cross-loading on one of two factors. However, cross-loading
items were retained as they fitted theoretically into a single main
factor where they loaded the strongest (37). Table A1 further
illustrates the individual items’ loadings. Second, the reliability
analysis revealed an overall Cronbach’s α of 0.954 for all 26
items. This value indicates that the MPPUS demonstrated high
reliability in the current Australian sample.
Prevalence, User Categories, and Cut-Off Points in
the MPPUS
Table 2 presents the mean values for each MPPUS (29) item
used in Australia and other countries. A detailed analysis per
item shows that Item 4 (“All my friends own a mobile phone”;
M = 8.86; SD = 2.24) and Item 17 (“If I don’t have a mobile
phone, my friends would find it hard to get in touch with me”;
M = 5.19; SD = 3.33) have the higher scores. While item 15
(“I have frequent dreams about the mobile phone; M = 1.37;
SD = 1.20) had the lowest score in Australia. To put the items
into context, previous studies using the MPPUS were identified
in a literature review search. As can be seen in Table 2, Britain
(36) consistently demonstrated higher means in comparison to
Spain, Switzerland, and Australia (2018). It should also be noted
that although (39) used fewer MPPUS items in the USA version,
each one of their items revealed the highest means in comparison
to the other countries.
Mobile phone users in the 2018 Australian sample were
categorized based on the criteria by de-Sola et al. (30) as
specified in section Data Analysis, using the 26-MPPUS score

Problematic Mobile Phone Use
(see Table 3). A total of four user categories were identified:
Casual Users, Habitual and Regular Users, At Risk Users, and
Problem Users.
Prevalence by sex
The ANOVA revealed significant differences in the mean 26-
item MPPUS scores between males and females in the study
[F(1, 707) = 19.78, p < 0.001], with the females reporting more
problematic mobile phone use (M = 72.23, SD = 41.36) as
opposed to the males (M = 58.80, SD = 39.07). This finding
is consistent with the distribution of sex across user categories,
which revealed that 15.4% of males and 24.1% of females are
Problematic Users.
Prevalence by age
Significant differences were found between the three age
groups with respect to average problematic mobile phone use
[F(2, 706) =
83.19, p < 0.001], with the younger population
of 18–24 year old participants reporting the highest 26-item
MPPUS mean score (M = 95.90, SD = 45.58) and the older
population of over 60 year old participants reporting the lowest
mean score (M = 41.85, SD = 22.97). This finding is consistent
with the distribution of age across user categories, such that the
proportion of Problematic Users within the 18–24 year old age
group was 40.9%, within the 25–59 year old age group was 23.5%,
and 60 years and over was 3.2%. Significant negative correlations
were found between the 26-item MPPUS and age (r = −0.506,
p < 0.001), such that older participants report less problematic
mobile phone use.
Prevalence by education level
The participants’ level of education was associated with their
problematic mobile phone use, with the ANOVA revealing a
significant difference in the 26-item MPPUS scores between the
four education levels [F(3, 705) = 13.83, p < 0.001]. Overall, the
participants who had completed or were currently enrolled in
university (n = 473) reported the greatest mean 26-item MPPUS
score (M = 71.81, SD = 42.63) and significantly differed from
participants who had completed Year 10, finished High School,
and who had completed or were currently enrolled in a TAFE
course. Participants who had completed Year 10 had the lowest
mean MPPUS score (M = 42.67, SD = 24.94).
Relationship between MPPUS and mobile phone use while
driving
To understand the impact that problematic phone use has
on health, this study explored the relationship between the
26-item MPPUS and mobile phone use while driving. On
average, participants reported more hands-free mobile phone
use of mobile phones whilst driving (M = 3.06, SD = 1.59),
compared with handheld mobile phone interactions whilst
driving, such as texting, browsing, etc. (M = 1.87, SD = 1.08).
With regards to specific items examining handheld phone use,
46% of participants reported having looked continually at the
phone for more than two seconds; while 42% reported that they
have performed a visual-manual task on their mobile phone
(e.g., texting, browsing, or emailing) and have monitored/read
conversations without writing back. In relation to the items
assessing hands-free conversations, 68% reported having had a
conversation using a hands-free device (e.g., headset) and/or an
in-car audio system or Bluetooth, with 62% reporting having
phone conversations while driving without holding the phone in
their hands (e.g. phone on loudspeaker).
The ANOVA found significant differences between handheld
use [F(3, 705) =
62.50, p < 0.001] and hands-free use
[F(3, 705) = 10.80, p < 0.001] while driving based on user
categories. Post-hoc comparison tests revealed that Problem
Users significantly differ from Casual or Habitual and Regular
Users for both handheld and hands-free phones while driving,
such that Problem Users engage in more handheld and hands-
free mobile use whilst driving compared to Casual or Habitual
and Regular Users. Finally, it should be noted that significant
positive correlations were found between the 26-item MPPUS
and both handheld (r = 0.503, p < 0.001) and hands-free
(r = 0.158, p < 0.001) phone use while driving.
Predictive Variables of Problematic Users
A binary logistic regression was performed to identify the
variables that predict Normal Users and Problematic Users. The
independent variables used in this analysis were age, sex, level of
education, and mobile phone use while driving (handheld and
hands-free phone use while driving). The dependent variables
comprised of the two categories used in the de-Sola et al. (30)
article: Normal Users and Problematic Users. As can be seen in
Table 4, the results revealed that three variables: age, handheld
mobile phone use while driving, and education level, were
capable of differentiating between Normal Users and Problematic
Users. More specifically, it was found that an individual is more
likely to be a deemed as a Problematic User if they use a handheld
mobile phone while driving and belong to either the 18–24 or 25–
59 year old age group. However, participants currently enrolled
in or who completed TAFE education compared to those who
are studying or graduated from university are less likely to be
classified as Problematic Users.
Problem Mobile Phone Use Comparisons
Between 2005 and 2018 Samples
An item-level analysis was conducted comparing scores from
the study conducted by Bianchi and Phillips (29) and the
current study. As can be seen in Table 2, the average MPPUS
individual item scores have increased from when the scale was
first used within the Australian population in 2005. For instance,
Australian participants in 2018 have been feeling, on average,
more lost without their mobiles phones (Item 26, M = 3.17,
SD = 2.75) in comparison to Australian participants in 2005
(M = 2.99, SD = 2.74), and have also reported experiencing, on
average, more problems when occupied on their mobile phones
in 2018 (Item 3, M = 2.95, SD = 2.45) compared to Australians
in 2005 (M = 1.81, SD = 1.59). Similarly, Australians in 2018
have also experienced, on average, more loss of sleep due to time
spent on their mobile phones (Item 5, M = 2.55, SD = 2.50), in
comparison to Australian mobile phone users in 2005 (M = 1.35,
SD = 1.32).

were
conducted to study differences between the 2005 and original
27-item 2018 MPPUS based on sex and age. With regards to sex,
average MPPUS item scores increased for eight items within the
male population between 2005 and 2018 (see Table 5). In relation
to the female population, the analysis revealed an increase in
the average MPPUS item scores for more than half of the items
in the scale between 2005 and 2018 (i.e., 15 items; see Table 5).
The largest differences between the 2005 and 2018 MPPUS were
found in Item 6 (“I lose sleep due to the time I spend on my
mobile phone”; � = 0.93, p < 0.001) with an increase among the
male population, and Item 21 (“There are times when I would
rather use the mobile phone than deal with other more pressing
issues”; � = 1.83, p < 0.001) with an increase among the female
population. Additionally, males reported the most substantial
decreases in Item 10 (“The time I spend on the mobile phone has
increased over the last 12 months”; � = −1.48, p < 0.001) and
Item 26 for females (“My friends don’t like it when my mobile
phone is switched off”; � = −0.66, p <0.01).
Additionally, concerning the age-related differences between
the 2005 and 2018 MPPUS, the results revealed 18 MPPUS
item scores to increase among the 26–35 and 36–45 year
old age groups, and 12 MPPUS items scores to increase
among the 18–25 and 46+ year old age groups (see Table 6).
Furthermore, as can be seen in Table 6, the largest differences
between the 2005 and 2018 MPPUS were found in Item
21 among the 18–25 year old participants (“There are times
when I would rather use the mobile phone than deal with
other more pressing issues”; � = 2.85, p < 0.001) and 26–
35 year olds (� = 2.88, p < 0.001), Item 4 among the
36–45 year old participants (“All my friends own a mobile
phone”; � = 2.41, p < 0.001), and Item 17 among the
46+ year old age group (“If I don’t have a mobile phone,
my friends would find it hard to get in touch with me”;
� = 1.80, p < 0.001).
To illustrate changes in the prevalence of larger responses over
time, the percentage of participants who marked a value of 6 or
higher in each item was calculated for sex and age, as can be seen
in Table A2. With regards to age, the 2018 sample consistently
showed increases in selecting a value of 6 or higher for a majority
of the MPPUS items.
Among the 18–25 years and 26–35 years age groups, the item
with the highest increase in prevalence was Item 21 (“There are
times when I would rather use the mobile phone than deal with
other more pressing issues”). The proportion of participants who
reported a score of 6 or higher for Item 21 in the 18–25 years
old age group was 10.5% in 2005, and 51.4% in 2018. Likewise,

reported scores of 6 or higher was 7.0% in 2005, and 44.8% in
2018. Among the 36–45 years old and 46+ years old age groups,
the item with the highest increase in prevalence was Item 17 (“If I
don’t have a mobile phone, my friends would find it hard to get in
touch with me”). The proportion of participants who reported a
score of 6 or higher for Item 17 in the 36–45 years old group was
20.9% in 2005, and 52.0% in 2018. Additionally, the proportion
of participants who reported a score of 6 or higher for Item 17
in the 46+ years old age group was 12.2% in 2005, and 36.0%
in 2018.
With regards to sex, higher percentages of prevalence were
also found in the 2018 sample, with more participants in
this study selecting a value of 6 or higher for most of the
MPPUS items. In the male population, the item with the
largest increase in prevalence was Item 18 (“My productivity
has decreased as a direct result of the time I spend on
the mobile phone”), with the proportion of participants
reporting a score of 6 or higher being 0% in 2005, and
12.5% in 2018. Amongst the female population, Item 17
(“If I don’t have a mobile phone, my friends would find
it hard to get in touch with me”) had the largest increase
in prevalence, with the proportion of participants reporting
a score of 6 or higher being 28.8% in 2005, and 54.9%
in 2018.

A t-test was conducted between the 2018 Australian 26-
item MPPUS scores and the 2005 Australian scores. There
was a significant difference in the scores for the 2018 26-
item MPPUS (M = 65.32, SD = 40.73) and the 2005 MPPUS
(M = 57.08, SD = 30.66), such that the 2018 scores were higher
[t(402.078) = −3.08, p = 0.002].
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The current study is a recent replication of the Mobile Phone
Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) in an Australian sample. The first
objective of this study was to investigate the current misuse
of mobile phone technology in Australia and its potential

implications on the health of Australians. Specifically, this study
examined the relationship between problematic mobile phone
use (at risk and problem users), sex, age, and education levels.
The road safety implications of problematic mobile phone use
were determined through the examination of the relationship
between the MPPUS scores and mobile phone use while driving.
Using a mobile phone while driving has been established as one
of the riskiest behaviors with serious potential consequences such
as property damage, injury, and death (40, 41). Additionally,
differences were investigated between the scores of the current
Australian sample and the original Australian sample studied
by Bianchi and Phillips (29). This is the first replication study
undertaken within Australia since Bianchi and Phillips’ original
research and confirmed the validity of the MPPUS to study
problem mobile phone use. The findings of this paper offer new
insights into the penetration of the role of mobile phones within
a developed nation that has high mobile phone ownership rates.
The MPPUS scores were analyzed according to sex, showing
that females report higher problematic phone use scores
compared to males. Such findings are in line with previous
research that has found greater mobile phone use among females,
particularly in regards to females spending both a greater amount
of time on their phone and money on their phone bill (42, 43).
These results are also similar to a study conducted by Olivencia-
Carrion et al. (44), whereby females were found to score higher
in a questionnaire assessing mobile phone dependence based on
addictive symptoms, time spent on the phone, etc. In addition,
van Deursen et al. (45) also found that women, in comparison to
men, were more likely to use their phones for social purposes.
Both Nayak (42) and van Deursen et al. (45) attributed such
findings to men experiencing less social stress than women.
Furthermore, it is important to consider that these findings may
be explained by differences in self-awareness, such that females
tend to be more self-aware and self-report mobile phone use
more openly (46). Contrary to expectations, the participants’
sex did not predict Problematic Use which included those
categorized as “At Risk” and “Problem Users,” compared with
Normal Users which include “Casual Users” and “Habitual and
Regular Users.” It is important to notice that these categories
reflect common assumptions about the distribution of addictions
in a population (30, 47). This finding mirrors that of Bianchi
and Phillips (29) who did not find sex to be a predictor of
smartphone usage, they found differences in the type of use, with
females predominantly using their phones for social reasons and
males for business purposes. More recent research has also found
that females do not experience more problems related to mobile
phone use compared to males (48, 49).
The results from this study also found significant differences
between the three age groups, with the younger age group (18–
24 years) reporting the highest levels of problematic mobile
phone use, and the older age group (60+ years) reporting the
lowest levels. This finding is in line with Bianchi and Phillips’
(29) study, which found younger people to spend more time
on their mobile phone and experience more problematic mobile
phone use in comparison to older people. Similarly, these results
are also consistent with another study which found younger
participants (16–25 year-olds and 26–35 year-olds) to use their
phones more problematically than the older participants (36
years and over), with hours of cell phone use diminishing
with age (30). Overall, such findings highlight the possibility of
younger people being more likely to embrace new technologies
and utilize the various functions offered by mobile phones, such
as SMS, social media, and gaming (29). Additionally, physical
limitations such as issues with vision or manual dexterity may
result in some older people using their phone less frequently
in comparison to younger people (29). Generally, international
findings have shown young people tend to be at higher risk of
problematic phone use (50). An interesting finding was that there
were significant associations between problematic mobile phone
use and level of education, with participants enrolled or having
completed university education reported higher MPPUS scores.
This could be related to lifestyle variables not considered within
this study.
This study found that there is a direct relationship between
problematic mobile phone use and mobile phone use while
driving. Specifically, self-reported handheld and hands-free
mobile phone use increase with self-reported problematic mobile
phone use. Participants who reported more handheld mobile
phone use whilst driving are more likely to be classified as
“problematic mobile phone users.” Research has been skeptical
about defining mobile phone use as an addiction due to the
lack of evidence for major consequences and symptomology
of mobile phone use (51). As explained by Panova and
Carbonell (6), one of the characteristics of addiction is the
impairment of physical health, and in the case of mobile phone
usage, physical consequences appear to be very minimal. The
link between MPPUS and mobile phone use while driving
suggests that problematic mobile phone use can indeed have
physical consequences in the form of potential road crash-
related injuries among drivers (52–54) and pedestrians (23).
Data from naturalistic studies have found that the likelihood
of a crash increases nearly 3.6 times as a result of handheld
interactions with a mobile phone while driving (41). Specifically,
in Australia, mobile phone use while driving is an activity that
has been the target of a plethora of interventions to prevent
these behaviors such as legislation, active police enforcement,
educational campaigns, etc. However, these efforts have been
mostly unsuccessful due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile
phone use, lifestyle factors, and strategies to avoid police
enforcement (55, 56). The current investigation adds to these
factors, confirming that individual differences in the levels of
problematic mobile phone use are related to mobile phone use
while driving.
The results revealed that there are differences between MPPUS
scores in 2005 and 2018, thus indicating that problem mobile
phone use has, in fact, increased in Australia over the past 13
years. However, it is important to notice that this increased
problem mobile phone use was not only among the younger
generations but also participants aged 46 years old or more.
As reported in the Deloitte (2) study, older generations have
driven the market growth in Australia to 88% smartphone
ownership. Further evidence of this phenomenon was seen when
analyzing differences between self-reports in 2005 and 2018
in item 4 “All my friends own a mobile phone,” in which
males, females and those aged 26 years old and older reported
increased penetration of mobile technology in their social circles.

Problematic Mobile Phone Use
This finding potentially signals the growing adaptation and
versatility of mobile phone technology to support lifestyles
across generations.
Among
the
most
significant
changes
in
item
scores,
Australians in 2018 reported experiencing more problems when
occupied on their mobile phones, in addition to feeling more
lost when their mobile phones are not in their possession. These
findings may potentially be likened to the symptoms of tolerance,
withdrawal and loss of control commonly discussed in literature
on addictions, with the caveat that these symptoms in the context
of mobile phones can be attributed to the substantial material
cost, and the high level of integration of mobile phones within
daily communication and social functioning (6).
Another interesting pattern is that of “technoference,” which
in this study corresponds to the everyday intrusions and
interruptions due to mobile phone devices and their usage (57).
In this 2018 sample, technoference is shown to have increased
amongst males and females across all ages. For example, self-
reports of items such as “I lose sleep due to the time I
spend on my mobile phone” (Item 6) and “my productivity
has decreased as a direct result of the time I spend on the
mobile phone” (Item 18) significantly increased during the
last 13 years. This finding suggests that mobile phones are
potentially increasingly affecting aspects of daytime functioning
due to lack of sleep and increasing dereliction of responsibilities.
These results confirm previous research that has linked mobile
phone use with sleep and productivity disturbances (19, 58).
An emerging explanation for the maladaptive relationship that
individuals have with their mobile phone is “fear of missing
out” (FOMO). FOMO is a psycho-social construct that is
defined as the persistent desire to stay connected with others’
rewarding experiences, and has been linked to both negative
affectivity (e.g., stress, depression, anxiety) and increased severity
of problem mobile phone use (59–61). While such findings
are promising, more research into the cognitive impacts of
smartphone technology is required to reach more definitive
conclusions (62).
The non-significant differences between 2005 and 2018
responses suggest that some degree of tolerance or better
community understanding of mobile phone devices has been
achieved in the last 13 years. Examples of this are items such
as “I have received mobile phone bills I could not afford to
pay (Item 7),” “Sometimes, when I am on the mobile phone
and I am doing other things, I get carried away with the
conversation and I don’t pay attention to what I am doing
(Item 9),” and “The time I spend on the mobile phone has
increased over the last 12 months (Item 10),” which did not
increase. For the behavioral addictions, there has been some
discussion as to whether increased access/exposure will always
lead to problems [e.g., (63)] or whether a community eventually
adapts [e.g., (64)]. Therefore, caution should be exercised in
pathologizing the overall increased mobile phone ownership
and usage, since professional, social, and academic contexts
could heavily influence the frequency and type of certain mobile
phone behaviors (6, 65). Nonetheless, an increased frequency
of general phone use (regardless of being problematic or not)
could result in a number of health issues such as musculoskeletal
disorders (66).
In 2018, compared with the 2005 sample, more users in the
18–25 and 26–35-years old age groups reported that there were
times when they would rather use their mobile phone than deal
with other more pressing issues. This may indicate that mobile
phones are also being used as a coping strategy that may facilitate
avoidance of other “pressing issues” in one’s life. Taken as a
whole, this notable finding suggests that in spite of an increase
in mobile phone use, not all phone use should be considered
“bad” or problematic by nature, given that some individuals
could be using the device in a way to better function during
difficult times. Research conducted by Gonzales (67) particularly
showed that disadvantaged groups (ethnic and sexual minorities)
use the internet to enhance their social networks, with mobile
phones being a key medium to facilitate this. The potential
positive benefits of mobile phones must also be considered and
contextualized when considering the overall impact of mobile
phone technology.
Limitations
The current study possesses some limitations that must be
acknowledged. First, given the use of self-report data in the study,
it is plausible that some participants may have overestimated
their own mobile phone usage (30, 68). This may have influenced
the potential accuracy of the findings in the study. To address this
limitation, future research may look into using more objective
measures of problem mobile phone use (e.g., apps which monitor
frequency of use) and, if possible, gathering additional data from
the people closest to the participant (e.g., family, colleagues) to
strengthen the findings and generate a more holistic and accurate
understanding of an individual’s problem mobile phone use (52).
Second, the unequal age and gender distributions resulted in
this study comprising of a relatively older group of participants
and, to a lesser extent, more males than females. This may
have limited the study’s ability to generalize its findings within
a wider population of Australian mobile phone users. Third,
this study did not investigate the health implications associated
with mobile phone use while driving. Such information would
have been of value within the field of road safety and can be
considered an avenue for future research. The researchers also
acknowledge that, due to rapid advancements in technology over
the past decade, the ways in which people used mobile phones
in 2005 is starkly different to the ways in which it is used in
2018. Consequently, our capacity to understand the mechanisms
for the increase in the MPPUS scores is limited. Finally, it is
important to note that the results may have potentially been
affected due to differences in sample distributions between
both the 2005 and 2018 surveys. The 2018 sample is a larger
and more diverse sample regarding age and gender, and more
representative of the general Australian population.
Future Research
Future research may look into recruiting an equal number of
participants within the age and gender groups. Finally, although
mobile phone use seems to have increased in Australia, it is still
unclear whether the maximum level has been reached as of yet.
Further technological advancements such as the development
of smart watches, for instance, are providing individuals with
new and more accessible ways of utilizing the functions on

their mobile phones without physically handling a phone in
the first place. Thus, future research may investigate whether
problematic use of such devices tends to exhibit similar health
and safety implications to that of problematic mobile phone use.
