Aims
Intravenous procainamide and amiodarone are drugs of choice for well-tolerated ventricular tachycardia. However, the
choice between them, even according to Guidelines, is unclear. We performed a multicentre randomized open-labelled
study to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous procainamide and amiodarone for the acute treatment of
tolerated wide QRS complex (probably ventricular) tachycardia.
Methods
and results
Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous procainamide (10 mg/kg/20 min) or amiodarone (5 mg/kg/20 min).
The primary endpoint was the incidence of major predefined cardiac adverse events within 40 min after infusion initiation.
Of 74 patients included, 62 could be analysed. The primary endpoint occurred in 3 of 33 (9%) procainamide and 12 of 29
(41%) amiodarone patients (odd ratio, OR ¼ 0.1; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.03–0.6; P ¼ 0.006). Tachycardia termi-
nated within 40 min in 22 (67%) procainamide and 11 (38%) amiodarone patients (OR ¼ 3.3; 95% CI 1.2–9.3;
P ¼ 0.026). In the following 24 h, adverse events occurred in 18% procainamide and 31% amiodarone patients (OR:
0.49; 95% CI: 0.15–1.61; P: 0.24). Among 49 patients with structural heart disease, the primary endpoint was less common
in procainamide patients (3 [11%] vs. 10 [43%]; OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04–0.73, P ¼ 0.017).
Conclusions
This study compares for the first time in a randomized design intravenous procainamide and amiodarone for the treatment
of the acute episode of sustained monomorphic well-tolerated (probably) ventricular tachycardia. Procainamide therapy
was associated with less major cardiac adverse events and a higher proportion of tachycardia termination within 40 min.

Introduction
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an uncommon but dangerous med-
ical condition, with an extremely variable clinical presentation, from
being almost asymptomatic to producing cardiac arrest. When the
clinical condition as the patient seeks medical attention is not com-
promised (i.e. blood pressure is maintained and there are no overt
signs of heart failure) VT is usually referred to as ‘stable’ or ‘well tol-
erated’. Although it may remain stable for minutes or even hours,
the condition produces justified concern and requires prompt

 intervention for termination because haemodynamic instability and
deterioration leading to collapse can develop at any time. Termin-
ation can be achieved with electrical cardioversion, antiarrhythmic
medications, and pacing techniques. Following guidelines recom-
mendations, intravenous procainamide, and amiodarone are drugs
of choice for the treatment of haemodynamically stable VT with a
class II recommendation.1 – 4 However, although both drugs are
well known and have been in conventional clinical use for dec-
ades,5 – 10 there is no scientific evidence to base the use of one
drug vs. the other in this clinical context. Controlled trials with
amiodarone have been performed in other clinical contexts11 – 14
(i.e. hypotensive VT or cardiac arrest) and procainamide has been
compared with other antiarrhythmic drugs,7 but no controlled pro-
spective trial have focused in comparing these two agents in well-
tolerated VT.
The PROCAMIO is a multicentre, prospective and randomized
study that compares the safety and efficacy of intravenous procaina-
mide and amiodarone in the acute treatment of wide QRS complex
monomorphic tachycardias (presumably VT) which are haemo-
dynamically well tolerated.
Sustained monomorphic VT always involves a differential diagno-
sis with supraventricular tachycardia. However, the majority of wide
QRS complex tachycardias presenting at Emergency Departments
are in fact VTs, even if the haemodynamic tolerance is acceptable.15
As such, the present trial refers to ‘wide QRS complex tachycardia
(probably of ventricular origin)’ rather than to ‘VT’, assuming some
uncertainty in diagnosis.
Methods
Study design and randomization
Patients were randomly assigned in an open-labelled fashion to receive
either intravenous procainamide (single dose 10 mg/kg over 20 min) or
intravenous amiodarone (single dose 5 mg/kg over 20 min) with a 1:1 ra-
tio. The study period was 40 min from infusion initiation (20 min for drug
administration and 20 min following administration). There was an obser-
vation period of 24 h after the end of the study period.
The randomization procedure was as follows: since a rapid decision
has to be made as to the drug assigned, groups of 10 numbered and
closed envelopes were deposited at each Centre (and were replaced
as necessary) so, whenever a candidate appeared, the investigator could
open the next envelope containing the assigned therapy. The study
complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Both Cardiology and Emer-
gency Departments participated at different Centres in order to include
a representative patient population. The study protocol was approved
by the Ethics Committee at each centre, and informed consent of the
subjects was obtained before enrolment. The trial was registered in
Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00383799). PROCAMIO investigators are listed
in Appendix.
Patient selection
Patients with regular wide QRS complex tachycardia that required med-
ical attention were included in the study if they had the following con-
ditions: (i) regular heart rhythm with rate ≥120 bpm; (ii) tachycardia
QRS duration ≥120 ms; (iii) good haemodynamic tolerance defined
as: (a) systolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, (b) absence of dyspnoea
at rest, (c) absence of peripheral hypoperfusion signs, and (d) no severe
anginal symptoms; and (iv) age .18 years. Exclusion criteria included: (i)
treatment with either intravenous amiodarone or intravenous procaina-
mide during the previous 24 h; (ii) poor haemodynamic tolerance that
required urgent termination; (iii) presence of irregular tachycardia, (iv)
tachycardia that was considered as supraventricular due to physician cri-
teria (based mostly on response to vagal manoeuvres or adenosine,
electrocardiographic analysis was not particularly encouraged within
the study), (v) contraindications to the drugs under study, and (vi) the
patient that did not want to cooperate and/or sign the consent form.
Definitions and treatments
Major cardiac adverse events were considered to be probably related
to the drugs in study and predefined as one of the following: (i) clinical
signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, (ii) heart failure signs: dyspnoea at
rest and/or orthopnoea associated with signs of pulmonary congestion
(presence or increase of rales and/or decrease in blood oxygen satur-
ation), (iii) severe hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure
≤70 mmHg if the pre-treatment systolic pressure was ≤100 mmHg
or systolic blood pressure ≤80 mmHg if the pre-treatment systolic
pressure was .100 mmHg, (iv) tachycardia acceleration of .20 bpm
of its mean value, and (v) appearance of fast polymorphic VT.
Drug infusion was stopped by protocol if any of the following oc-
curred: (i) termination of the tachycardia during the infusion period;
(ii) complete administration of the amount of drug programmed; and
(iii) presence of a major cardiac adverse event. If the tachycardia did
not terminate during the study period, the patient was treated following
physician’s criteria. Nevertheless, electrical cardioversion was strongly
recommended.
Response to treatment was evaluated as follows: termination was de-
fined as conversion to the patient’s known or presumed usual heart
rhythm (e.g. sinus, atrial fibrillation) within the study period. If the tachy-
cardia terminated within 20 min of drug infusion initiation and recurred
within 20 min following infusion ending, then the treatment was consid-
ered unsuccessful.
A 12 lead ECG was obtained before including the patient in the study.
During the study period, patients were constantly monitored. A 12 lead
ECG or a rhythm strip of at least one lead was obtained every 10 min.
Likewise, a 12 lead ECG was obtained at the time the tachycardia ended.
Blood pressure (at least systolic) was measured every 3 min.
Study endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study was to compare the incidence of ma-
jor cardiac adverse events between both treatments. Secondary end-
points were the following: (i) to compare the efficacy of both drugs
in relation to the acute termination of the tachycardia episode and
(ii) to compare the incidence of total adverse events during the obser-
vation period. Adverse events were analysed and classified blinded to
the patient study group.
Sample size calculations and premature study
termination
The sample size calculation for this study had significant uncertainties at
the time the study was designed. There was only one randomized trial
with intravenous procainamide in tolerated VT, with considerable ad-
verse events.7 Observational studies with small number of patients
had reported extremely good tolerance of intravenous amiodar-
one.8,16–18 So we hypothesized 20 and 5% adverse event rate in the pro-
cainamide and amiodarone groups. Based on these assumptions, 302
patients were needed to detect a difference of 15% in major adverse
events between both groups.
After nearly 6 years including patients at 26 participating Centres, 74
patients had been randomized and a trend towards a decrease in

 inclusion rate was observed. At this point, the Steering Committee
decided to stop patient recruitment and analyse the results.
Statistical analysis
Summary statistics for continuous variables was recorded as means and
standard deviations, as well as medians. Comparisons between the two
treatment groups were performed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All
P-values are two tailed. Categorical data were summarized as frequen-
cies and percentages, and comparisons between groups were per-
formed with the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test and
non-conditional logistic regression to calculate odd ratio (OR) and con-
fidence interval (CI). As sensitivity analyses, we estimated the OR for
both treatments after several assumptions: (i) including patients initially
excluded, (ii) including only patients with structural heart disease, and
(iii) adjusting for several confounding factors (adjusted OR). Data
were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0) and JMP (version 12.0.1).
Results
Study population
Seventy-four patients that required medical attention at 16 of the 29
participating hospitals were included in the study. Figure 1 depicts a
flow diagram of patients entering the trial. One patient did not
receive the assigned drug (amiodarone) because he/she required
urgent cardioversion before drug administration. Twelve patients
(6 in the amiodarone group and 6 in the procainamide group)
were excluded from the analysis due to protocol violation or the de-
velopment of exclusion criteria before drug treatment (Figure 1).
Sixty-two patients were analysed. Thirty-three patients were as-
signed to procainamide and 29 to amiodarone. Their relevant clin-
ical data are provided in Table 1. Most variables, including b-blockers
and vasodilators, were evenly distributed. Age and previous oral
amiodarone differed and were included in sensitivity analyses
(see below). Time from arrival to start of infusion was 87 +
21 min for procainamide and 115 +36 min for amiodarone patients
(P ¼ 0.58). In order to obtain an idea of the true incidence of VT,
ECGs of tachycardias were reviewed off-line by two electrophysiol-
ogists (F.A., R.P.) who classified the episodes as probably/definite VT
or SVT. 90.3% of the episodes were considered VT (88% procaina-
mide, 93% amiodarone, P ¼ 0.49).
Primary endpoint
Fifteen patients (24%) had major cardiac adverse events during the
study period. Major cardiac adverse events occurred less frequently
in patients treated with intravenous procainamide (9 vs. 41%; OR ¼
0.1; 95% CI: 0.03–0.6; P ¼ 0.006, Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). Events are
detailed in Table 4: severe hypotension requiring immediate elec-
trical cardioversion was the most frequent adverse event in both
groups, no death occurred.
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the association between
procainamide treatment and major cardiac adverse events

 compared with amiodarone. The reduction of events in patients
treated with procainamide compared with amiodarone did not
change if we included all patients, or after adjusting by age, sex,
structural heart disease, and previous treatment with oral amiodar-
one (Table 3).
Secondary endpoints
Tachycardia termination
Termination of VT during the study period occurred in 33 patients
(53%). Efficacy was significantly higher in patients treated with
intravenous procainamide: 67 vs. 38%; OR ¼ 3.3; 95% CI 1.2–9.3;
P ¼ 0.026, Table 2, Figure 2.
An analysis was performed including all patients entering the
trial, which did not change the results (68 vs. 42%; OR ¼ 2.7; 95%
CI 1.04–7.08; P ¼ 0.041).
Total adverse events during the study period
Hypotension not requiring cessation of infusion occurred in seven
patients adding to a total number of adverse events of eight in the
procainamide group and 14 in the amiodarone group (24 vs. 48%;
OR ¼ 0.34; 95% CI 0.12–1.00; P ¼ 0.052, Tables 2 and 4, Figure 2).

 Adverse events during the observation period
Fifteen patients (24%) presented adverse events during the observa-
tion period (18% procainamide, 31% amiodarone group, OR: 0.49;
95% CI: 0.15–1.61; P ¼ 0.24, Tables 2 and 4, Figure 2).
Subgroup analysis in patients with
structural heart disease
Among patients with structural heart disease, major cardiac adverse
events were significantly lower during the study period in patients
treated with intravenous procainamide (11 vs. 43%; OR: 0.17; 95%
CI: 0.04–0.73, P ¼ 0.017, Table 5). There were no significant differ-
ences in total adverse effects during the study period or during the
observation period (31 vs. 48%, P ¼ 0.22, and 23 vs. 30%, P ¼ 0.56,
respectively, Table 5). Ventricular tachycardia termination tended to
be higher with intravenous procainamide (65 vs. 39%, OR ¼ 2.94,
95% CI 0.92–9.4; P ¼ 0.069, Table 5).
Discussion
This study shows for the first time in a randomized controlled trial
that when intravenous procainamide and amiodarone, at usual clin-
ical doses, are compared for the acute treatment of spontaneous
episodes of well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardias, pre-
sumably VT: (i) procainamide is associated with less major cardiac
adverse events; (ii) procainamide is more efficacious in terminating
the tachycardia episode; (iii) these findings equally apply to the
subgroup of patients with structural heart disease.
Comparison with previous available
information
The information regarding intravenous procainamide and amio-
darone for the acute termination of well-tolerated spontaneous
sustained VT is limited.19 The only study that has compared procai-
namide and amiodarone is a retrospective multicentre historical co-
hort trial that gathered information from 90 patients.20 In that study,
amiodarone caused severe hypotension requiring emergency elec-
trical cardioversion in 6% and one patient died with asystole. There
is only one additional series using intravenous amiodarone: this
retrospective single cohort analysis identified 41 patients that
received 300 mg.21 Severe hypotension requiring emergency
electrical cardioversion occurred in 7/41 cases (17%). Our figure
of 41% major cardiac adverse events in the amiodarone arm is high-
er than in these reports. One possible explanation is that in our pro-
spective study, we prespecified which symptoms and levels of
hypotension were considered a major event, whereas in retrospect-
ive trials major adverse events were recognized by the need of elec-
trical cardioversion. In addition, the retrospective nature of these
studies imposes significant limitations: 47 patients (52%) in one
study20 had received another antiarrhythmic drug and the mean
dose was 2.0 mg/kg in patients in whom amiodarone was ineffective,
smaller than the 5 mg/kg used in our trial; in another study21 the
duration of the drug infusion lasted up to 60 min.
Regarding efficacy, amiodarone was effective in 23% in whom it
was the first drug tried (25% considering all patients)20 and in 15%
within 20 min (29% within 1 h).21 Our figure of 38% success rate,
slightly higher, could also be related to the higher doses and shorter
infusion time.

 The information regarding procainamide for the acute termin-
ation of spontaneous well-tolerated sustained VT is even more lim-
ited, including a retrospective comparison with amiodarone20 and
two studies comparing procainamide with lidocaine.7,22 Major car-
diac adverse events occurred in 137 and 17%.20 Our figure of 9%
is slightly lower. Efficacy was reported in 76 and 57% in retrospect-
ive studies20,22 and in 80% in a prospective study.7 Our figure of 67%
VT termination is consistent with these reports.
In light of the above findings, procainamide and amiodarone have
been considered in published Guidelines as agents that could be
used for the acute therapy of VT. Although the most recent Guidelines
indicate that electrical cardioversion should be the first-line approach,
they also consider antiarrhythmic drug therapy in this situation.23
Characteristics of our study: selected
dosages and administration
Since the most important concern in treating patients with cardiac
arrhythmias is safety, the primary endpoint of the study was focused
on major cardiac adverse events.
There is general agreement that for a condition, such as tolerated
VT that is potentially but not immediately life threatening, the dur-
ation of infusion can be longer than a ‘bolus’ but relatively short. Stud-
ies and guideline recommendations have ranged between 10 and
60 min infusion duration,2,4,7,20,21 we chose a 20 min duration period
which seemed a reasonable compromise for the workload of most
emergency departments. Amiodarone doses have ranged between
150 mg and a bolus of 5 mg/kg.4,13 The dose we chose, 5 mg/kg in-
fused during 20 min, approximated the 300 mg recommendation
made by the European Resuscitation Council.2 It is conceivable that
a lower amiodarone dose could have resulted in less adverse effects,
but probably also in lower efficacy not changing the main message of
the trial. Procainamide doses have also varied in the literature, ranging
between ‘at least’ 500 mg20 and ‘up to 17 mg/k’.4 We chose the
10 mg/k used by Gorgels et al.,7 but infused over 20 min.
Unexpected findings?
It is clear from the hypothesis and the sample size considerations
that we did not expect such a high incidence of major adverse effects

 in the amiodarone arm. Leak et al.16 reported on using a bolus of
150 mg of amiodarone in 11 critically ill patients and stated that
‘hypotension, cardiac failure and bradyarrhythmias were not in-
duced by this treatment’. In 38 critically ill patients, but having atrial
tachyarrhythmias, a mean of 242 mg of amiodarone was shown to
control heart rate without hypotension in any patient. In a series
of 15 patients with recurrent VT, amiodarone at an initial dose of
5 mg/k over 15 min resulted in no significant adverse effect.8 In se-
verely hypotensive recurrent VT, amiodarone produced less hypo-
tension than bretilium.12 We hypothesized that if amiodarone was
safe in these very sick patients it was going to be so in the stable pa-
tient with tolerated VT. However, in retrospect, some findings can
explain our results: (i) when the arrhythmia is immediately life threa-
tening, an antiarrhythmic action can produce such a benefit that
overcomes potential adverse effects; (ii) in studies performed during
resuscitation13,14 all patients had previously received intravenous
catecolamines (adrenaline) and in critically ill patients12 most were
receiving catecolamines: these drugs may have counteracted the
hypotensive effects of amiodarone.
Limitations
The study included less number of patients that were required accord-
ing to our sample size calculations. Several reasons probably accounted
for this: (i) extension of emergency protocols to treat these patients on
the ambulance; in these protocols only amiodarone was allowed, pre-
cluding participation in the trial; (ii) fast turnover of medical personnel
at emergency departments. In any event, recruitment rate was less than
expected and declining, which prompted us, after nearly 6 years includ-
ing patients, to end the study before having reached the number origin-
ally planned. In looking now to retrospectives series published in
recent years, a low number of patients of this kind seems to be the
rule, so it is possible that the condition is indeed rare.
The study design was randomized but not blinded. To avoid as-
signing less importance to adverse events related to one drug, major
adverse events and reasons to stop the study drug were precisely
predefined. In fact, since physicians are more familiar with intraven-
ous amiodarone, if anything, less relevance to adverse events related
to this drug could have been expected.
Conclusions
In this randomized prospective study comparing intravenous procai-
namide and amiodarone for the treatment of the acute episode of
sustained monomorphic well-tolerated wide QRS tachycardia
(probably VT), procainamide therapy was associated with less major
cardiac adverse events and a higher proportion of tachycardia ter-
mination within 40 min.
