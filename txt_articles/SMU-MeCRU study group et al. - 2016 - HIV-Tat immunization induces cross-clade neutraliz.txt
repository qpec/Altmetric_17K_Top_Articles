Abstract 
Background:  Although combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has saved millions of lives, it is incapable of full 
immune reconstitution and virus eradication. The transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein is a key human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV) virulence factor required for virus replication and transmission. Tat is expressed and released 
extracellularly by infected cells also under cART and in this form induces immune dysregulation, and promotes virus 
reactivation, entry and spreading. Of note, anti-Tat antibodies are rare in natural infection and, when present, corre-
late with asymptomatic state and reduced disease progression. This suggested that induction of anti-Tat antibodies 
represents a pathogenesis-driven intervention to block progression and to intensify cART. Indeed Tat-based vaccina-
tion was safe, immunogenic and capable of immune restoration in an open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial 
conducted in 168 cART-treated volunteers in Italy. To assess whether B-clade Tat immunization would be effective also 
in patients with different genetic background and infecting virus, a phase II trial was conducted in South Africa.
Methods: The ISS T-003 was a 48-week randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate immuno-
genicity (primary endpoint) and safety (secondary endpoint) of B-clade Tat (30 μg) given intradermally, three times at 
4-week intervals, in 200 HIV-infected adults on effective cART (randomised 1:1) with CD4+ T-cell counts ≥200 cells/
µL. Study outcomes also included cross-clade anti-Tat antibodies, neutralization, CD4+ T-cell counts and therapy 
compliance.
Results: Immunization was safe and well-tolerated and induced durable, high titers anti-Tat B-clade antibodies in 
97 % vaccinees. Anti-Tat antibodies were cross-clade (all vaccinees tested) and neutralized Tat-mediated entry of 
oligomeric B-clade and C-clade envelope in dendritic cells (24 participants tested). Anti-Tat antibody titers correlated 
positively with neutralization. Tat vaccination increased CD4+ T-cell numbers (all participants tested), particularly 
when baseline levels were still low after years of therapy, and this had a positive correlation with HIV neutralization.

Background
South Africa is severely affected by human immunode-
ficiency virus (HIV) infection [1]. The HIV counselling 
and testing campaign (HCT) launched by the National 
Department of Health has steadily increased the propor-
tion of HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral 
therapy (cART). However, access to therapy and care of 
millions of people living with HIV is posing an enormous 
challenge to the public health system by means of a grow-
ing work overload and economic burden. This is going to 
be further complicated by the expected implementation 
of the new World Health Organization (WHO) guide-
lines that recommend starting therapy at the time of the 
first positive HIV testing (“test and treat”) [2]. However, 
despite vast access to cART, the rates of HIV morbid-
ity/mortality are still high, with a 14 % annual increase 
of HIV drug resistance related to insufficient treatment 
compliance, which hampers an effective suppression of 
virus replication, a prerequisite to reduce virus transmis-
sion [3]. Further, late therapy initiation is still frequent in 
South Africa limiting the extent of CD4+ T cell recov-
ery and immune restoration [4, 5]. Similarly, persistent 
immune activation, particularly when associated with 
poor immunological response to therapy, leads to disease 
progression even under HIV suppression [6–8]. These 
are causes of increasing co-morbidities, hospitalization, 
deaths and costs for the National Health Systems. In this 
context, an effective therapeutic vaccine, in conjunction 
with existing strategies, may represent a relevant, cost-
effective intervention to intensify cART [9].
The transactivator of transcription (Tat) is a key HIV 
virulence factor playing pivotal roles in virus gene expres-
sion, replication, transmission and disease progression 
(reviewed in [10, 11]). Tat is produced very early upon 
infection [12–16] and continues to be expressed under 
cART [17, 18], is released extracellularly [19–21], accu-
mulates in tissues [22, 23], and exerts effects on both the 
virus and the immune system [17, 24–52] that make it 
an optimal candidate for therapeutic immunization and 
cART intensification [53–58]. In particular, by promoting 
an excessive and improper immune stimulation, Tat pre-
pares target cells for virus propagation, while disabling 
an effective immune control [17, 24–52]. This leads to 
the chronic loss of immune homeostasis observed in 
HIV-infected patients, which is only partially reverted by 
cART [59–63]. Further, extracellular Tat, which is present 
on virions [64], binds the envelope (Env) spikes forming 
a virus entry complex that favors infection of dendritic 
cell (DC) and T cells, key components of the virus res-
ervoir [65]. Of note, by binding the Env C–C chemokine 
receptor 5 (CCR5) co-receptor binding sites, Tat shields 
Env from anti-HIV antibodies (Abs), thus inhibiting virus 
neutralization, which, however, is restored by anti-Tat 
Abs [65]. Notably, anti-Tat Abs are uncommon in natural 
infection and, when present, correlate with the asympto-
matic state, higher CD4+ T-cell number, lower viral load, 
and reduced disease progression [66–70]. This suggested 
that the induction of effective anti-Tat Abs represents a 
pathogenesis-driven intervention to block progression 
and to intensify cART efficacy.
After completion of randomised, placebo-controlled, 
double-blinded phase I trials with the biologically 
active HIV-1 B-clade Tat protein in HIV-infected and 
uninfected individuals in Italy [54–56], an open-label 
randomised exploratory phase II trial with Tat was con-
ducted in 168 HIV-infected anti-Tat Abs negative, viro-
logically suppressed cART-treated (mean of 6 years) 
adult subjects in Italy (ISS T-002, ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT00751595) [53, 57]. The endpoints were to evaluate 
immunogenicity and safety of B-clade Tat protein admin-
istered at 7.5 or 30 µg, given three or five times monthly, 
and to investigate immunological and virological disease 
biomarkers. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated and 
induced anti-Tat Abs in most patients (79 %), with the 
highest frequency and durability in the Tat 30 µg groups 
(89 %), particularly when given 3 times (92 %). Vaccina-
tion promoted a durable and significant restoration of T, 
B, and natural killer (NK) cell numbers, increased CD4+ 
and CD8+ central memory subsets, and upregulated the 
expression of human leukocyte antigen-D related (HLA-
DR+) on CD8+ killer T cells, a phenotype found to be 
increased in elite controllers and to contribute to HIV 
containment [71, 72]. Moreover, a significant reduction 
of blood proviral DNA was seen after 3 years from the 
Finally, in cART non-compliant patients (24 participants), vaccination contained viral load rebound and maintained 
CD4+ T-cell numbers over study entry levels as compared to placebo.
Conclusions: The data indicate that Tat vaccination can restore the immune system and induces cross-clade neutral-
izing anti-Tat antibodies in patients with different genetic backgrounds and infecting viruses, supporting the conduct 
of phase III studies in South Africa.

first immunisation, particularly under protease inhibitor 
(PI)-based regimens and with Tat 30 µg given three times 
(30 μg, 3×), reaching a predicted 70 % decay with a half-
life of 88 weeks [57]. This decay was significantly associ-
ated with anti-Tat immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG Ab 
titers and neutralization of Tat-mediated entry of oligo-
meric Env in DC. Neutralization predicted HIV-1 DNA 
decay [57].
Based on these data, a 48-week randomised, double-
blinded, placebo-controlled phase II study was conducted 
in cART-treated South African adult volunteers to verify 
the immunogenicity and safety of the B-clade Tat vaccine 
in a population with a different genetic background and 
mainly infected with a C clade virus. Anti-Tat Abs were 
further characterised to explore cross-clade recogni-
tion and their capability of cross-neutralising Tat-medi-
ated oligomeric Env entry in DC. CD4+ T-cell counts 
were monitored for the entire trial, and the relationship 
between neutralization and CD4+ T-cell counts, as well 
as between anti-Tat and anti-Env Ab titers and neutrali-
zation, were also examined.
Methods
Production and purification of the recombinant 
biologically active HIV‑1 Tat protein for human use
The biologically active recombinant clade B HIV-1 Tat, 
selected as vaccine candidate for human use, is the 86 
amino acid-long protein derived from the HTLV-IIIB 
strain (BH-10 clone) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The 
protein was produced under good manufacturing prac-
tice (GMP) conditions by Diatheva-Avitech APU Srl, 
Fano (PU), Italy. Tat vialing, packaging and batch release 
was performed by Injectalia Srl, Rome, Italy. Briefly, the 
Tat protein is obtained from a lysate of Escherichia coli 
cells engineered with the pET-tat plasmid, constructed 
for Tat expression. The pET system is based on the T7 
promoter-driven system originally developed by Studier 
and colleagues [73–75], and provides vector-host com-
binations that enable tuning of basal expression levels to 
optimize target gene expression [75]. The GMP protein is 
then purified by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) chromatog-
raphy followed by heparin Sepharose chromatography. 
Following purification, the Tat protein is formulated in 
potassium phosphate saline buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 % 
sucrose and 1 % human serum albumin (HSA). This for-
mulation was defined in order to maintain the biological 
activity of the protein in a liquid form, stored at −80 °C 
in the absence of light over 3 years.
Study design and conduct
The ISS T-003 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01513135) was a 
phase II, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 
clinical trial with the recombinant biologically active HIV-1 
B-clade Tat protein conducted at the MeCRU, University 
of Limpopo, Medunsa Campus (now Sefako Makgatho 
Health Sciences University), South Africa (Additional 
file 2: ISS T-003 study protocol). The study was designed 
to evaluate Tat protein immunogenicity and safety in HIV-
1-infected, cART-treated, anti-Tat Ab-negative adult South 
Africans, and to explore CD4+ T-cell numbers and anti-Tat 
cross-clade neutralizing activity after immunization. The 
study duration was 48 weeks including an 8-week treat-
ment phase and a 40-week follow-up phase. The allowed 
window for patients’ screening was 35 days long.
Patients were recruited at the public Health Facilities 
located in the MeCRU catchment area (Tshwane Dis-
trict). Patients received cART at the Health Facilities 
throughout the trial. Procedures for patients’ recruit-
ment, access to medical records, referral to the Health 
Facilities for intervening medical conditions were imple-
mented under the coordination of the South African 
National Department of Health and the Department of 
Health of the Gauteng Province, South Africa. A commu-
nity involvement program was implemented at MeCRU 
with the support of the South African AIDS Vaccine Ini-
tiative, a lead program of the South African   Medical 
Research Council. MeCRU and local community advi-
sory board and groups implemented community educa-
tion strategies on HIV/AIDS awareness, participation 
in clinical trials, recruitment and retention strategies. A 
Contract Research Organization monitored study con-
duct, data quality and performed safety data analyses, 
which were periodically evaluated by the Local Medical 
Monitor and Data Safety Monitoring Board. The Local 
Medical Monitor was a blinded sponsor’s representative 
expert in HIV/AIDS clinical management. He reviewed 
safety data, assisted the Investigator in assessing adverse 
events (AEs) severity and causality, and forwarded quar-
terly reports to the Data Safety Monitoring Board. Data 
Safety Update Reports were submitted to the Competent 
Authorities as required.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study (immunogenicity) 
was measured by the induction, magnitude and persis-
tence of anti-Tat IgM, IgG and IgA in sera. The second-
ary endpoint (safety) was assessed by collecting all AEs 
during the trial, which included vital signs and any clini-
cally significant change in haematological, biochemical 
and coagulation parameters. All the recorded AEs were 
classified according to Medical Dictionary for Regula-
tory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and system 
organ class, and on the basis of drug relationship and 
grade of severity.

Study participants
Two hundred adult cART-treated patients were recruited 
and randomised 1:1 to receive Tat vaccine or placebo. 
Main criteria for enrolment were the following: age 
18–45 years (inclusive), current cART-treatment and 
chronically suppressed HIV-1 infection as indicated by a 
HIV-1 plasma viremia <400 copies/mL and a CD4+ T-cell 
count ≥200 cells/µL at screening, and documented at 
least once during the 12-month period prior to screening 
irrespective of the pre-cART CD4+ nadir, B-clade anti-Tat 
Ab-negative, willingness and ability to provide informed 
consent, and no acute illness at study start. Female par-
ticipants of childbearing potential were required to have 
a negative pregnancy test at screening and immediately 
before each vaccination and to use an acceptable method 
of contraception for at least 3 weeks prior to the first vac-
cination and for all duration of the trial.
Study procedures
All participants were randomized to receive the Tat 
vaccine (30 μg dose) or placebo (vaccine formulation 
buffer), administered intradermally three times at 4-week 
intervals (Additional file 2: ISS T-003 study protocol). 
Randomisation was performed in block sizes of four. Par-
ticipants were allocated to a randomisation number con-
sisting of a three-digit sequential number pre-fixed by a 
one-digit unique site identifier. Upon screening comple-
tion and immediately prior to vaccine administration, 
volunteers were randomly assigned to the next avail-
able treatment number according to the randomisation 
schedule, which was generated by the Contract Research 
Organization using the SAS® procedure PROC PLAN 
with a randomisation ratio of 1:1. Participants and clini-
cal and laboratory staff, project management personnel 
and anyone involved in data management or analysis and 
the sponsor were blinded to treatment assignment. Each 
investigational product (Tat vaccine/placebo) vial was 
packaged in one kit-box constituted of three vials with the 
same label for vaccine or placebo, according to the “Guide 
to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicines in South 
Africa, Version 4.01 March 2009”
. Kits were provided to 
the clinical site in a blinded fashion by the sponsor.
The evaluations performed at each of the 12 study visits 
varied according to the schedule provided in the Addi-
tional file 2: ISS T-003 study protocol . General labora-
tory assessments, including CD4+ T-cell number and 
HIV plasma viral load were performed by a centralized 
laboratory (South African National Health Laboratory 
Service at the Dr. George Mukhari, Ga-Rankuwa, Pre-
toria). CD4+ T-cell counts were performed according to 
standard national laboratory measurements. HIV-1 viral 
load was determined with the Abbott Real Time HIV-1 
assay (lower limit of detection 40 RNA copies/mL). Blood 
samples were collected and transferred according to 
protocol-specific procedures, and tested within 3 h from 
sample withdrawal. Anti-Tat binding and neutralizing 
Abs were assessed on cryopreserved specimens shipped 
by a certified courier to the designated Core Laboratory 
(Core Laboratory of Immunology and Virology, San Gal-
licano Institute, Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, 
Italy) according to Standard Operating Procedures.
Measurement of serum Abs against Tat proteins
The Tat proteins used for anti-Tat Ab determina-
tion and for anti-Tat Ab cross-clade analysis were, 
respectively, from HIV-1 B clade (GenBank acces-
sion no.: AAA44199.1); C clade (GenBank acces-
sion no.: AAL06113.1); A clade (GenBank accession 
no.: AAP33775.1); D clade (GenBank accession no.: 
AAP33758.1) (amino acid sequences are shown in Addi-
tional file 1: Figure S1) and were purchased from Dia-
theva. All proteins were biologically active as determined 
by the rescue assay with HLM-1 cell line carrying a Tat-
defective HIV provirus [19, 20], and/or by Tat uptake by 
monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) evaluated by intracellu-
lar staining for Tat in flow cytometry [35], a potency test 
that is used to release the Tat vaccine clinical lots.
Serum IgM, IgA and IgG against B-, A-, C-, and D-clade 
Tat were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorb-
ent assay (ELISA), as previously described [76]. Briefly, 
96-well microplates (Nunc-Immuno Plate MaxiSorp Sur-
face; Nunc) were coated with Tat (100 ng/well) in 200 µL 
of 0.05 mol/L carbonate-buffer (pH 9.6), and incubated 
overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed 5 times with phos-
phate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.05 % 
Tween-20, by an automatic plate washer (Asys Hitech 
flexi wash). Wells were then saturated with PBS contain-
ing 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05 % Tween-
20 (Sigma) (blocking buffer) for 90 min at 37 °C and 
then washed again as above. One hundred microlitres of 
patient serum samples [diluted at 1:100 (for anti-Tat IgG) 
or at 1:25 (for anti-Tat IgM or IgA detection) in blocking 
buffer] were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 
90 min. To correct for unspecific binding, each sample was 
assessed in duplicate against Tat and singly against the 
buffer in which Tat had been re-suspended. After washing, 
wells were saturated again with blocking buffer for 15 min 
at 37 °C, washed again and then a goat anti-human IgG, 
IgM, or IgA horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
Ab (100 µL/well) (PIERCE-Thermo Scientific) was added 
to each well, and incubated for an additional 90 min at 
37 °C. Antigen-bound Abs were revealed by the addition 
of 
ABTS 
[2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sul-
phonic acid)] solution (Roche Diagnostics) for 60 min at 
37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a micro-
plate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments EL800). The assay was

Ensoli et al. Retrovirology  (2016) 13:34 
considered valid only when both the positive and negative 
controls were within ±10 % of variation of the absorbance 
values recorded in previous 50 assays. For the cut-off cal-
culation, both the optical density (OD) readings at 405 nm 
of the wells coated with Tat and the delta (Δ) value were 
utilized. The Δ value was obtained by subtracting the OD 
reading of the well coated with the buffer alone from the 
average of the OD values of the two wells coated with the 
Tat protein. Serum samples were considered positive when 
both the sample OD at 405 nm and Δ values were ≥0.350 
and ≥0.150, respectively. The 0.350 and 0.150 OD values 
had been previously calculated as three standard devia-
tions (99 % confidence interval) above the mean of each of 
the absolute and Δ OD values obtained with sera from 89 
Italian HIV-negative blood donors and 34 South African 
HIV-negative individuals. If the sample scored positive, 
the titer value was 100 for IgG, 25 for IgM and IgA. How-
ever, if the OD reading of the sample exceeded both the 
absolute and Δ OD values by 50 %, serial twofold dilutions 
of the sample were performed to determine the endpoint 
titers. Endpoint titers were determined as the reciprocal of 
the last sample dilution that still had ≥0.350 and ≥0.150 
OD values for absolute and Δ parameters. For Tat cross-
clade analysis, OD values obtained with the different pro-
teins in the same ELISA test, on the same sample, at the 
same dilution, were compared.
Measurement of serum Abs against the Env protein
The same ELISA protocol and criteria for cut-off deter-
mination were applied for measurement of anti-Env Abs 
and their titer definition [70]. The ΔV2-Env (Novartis 
Vaccine and Diagnostics) from the HIV-1 C-clade TV1 
strain was used. Only IgG Abs were tested, starting from 
a 1:100 dilution.
Anti‑Tat neutralizing Ab responses
Anti-Tat neutralizing activity in sera was assessed by 
Tat-mediated Env entry in DC as described [35]. Briefly, 
MDDC from blood of healthy donors were cultured 
and induced to maturation as described [35, 36]. Purity 
of MDDC was always ≥99 %. Sera were diluted 1:30 in 
PBS and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with B- or C-clade 
trimeric Env (0.4 μM in monomer) (Novartis) previously 
mixed for 10 min at 25 °C with B- or C-clade Tat (0.4 μM) 
or degassed PBS (control). Samples were then added 
to MDDC (2 × 105 cells/mL) to a 1:5 final dilution and 
incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed 
with cold medium and treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 
ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) (Life Tech-
nologies) to remove any externally bound protein. After 
fixation and permeabilization, DC were stained with rab-
bit anti-gp120 polyclonal Abs (Chem Progress) or puri-
fied rabbit-IgG control Abs (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit 
Ig (Pierce). Fluorescence was measured by flow cytom-
etry and results expressed as the percentage of Env-pos-
itive cells as compared to isotype-stained samples. Sera 
were defined as “neutralizing” when capable of inhibiting 
Env entry into DC in the presence of Tat by at least 50 % 
as compared to baseline sera values (ND50).
Sample size calculation
Sample size for this study was powered for immuno-
genicity evaluation. The immunogenicity was assumed to 
be 80 % for vaccinees and 60 % for placebos, with alpha 
set at 0.05 (two-tailed). According to this assumption, a 
sample size of 91 per group had 80 % power of showing 
statistical significance (p < 0.05). The assumed response 
rate for vaccinees was based on the results of studies con-
ducted at the time of protocol preparation. The response 
rate in placebos was set in the absence of reference-con-
trolled studies and was therefore very conservative. The 
actual power of the study, given the percentage of sponta-
neous seroconversion, is 99 %.
Statistics
Two populations were considered for statistical analyses: 
the immunogenicity population (199 subjects), repre-
senting all randomised individuals who received at least 
two immunizations, and the safety population (200 sub-
jects), representing all randomised subjects who received 
at least one immunization. Subjects with at least one pos-
itive anti-Tat Ab response at any given time point during 
the study were defined as “responders”
. Ninety-five per-
centage confidence intervals were estimated for the pri-
mary endpoints; comparison between treatment groups 
was performed using the Chi square test. Kaplan–Meier 
method was used to assess the cumulative probability of 
anti-Tat Ab persistence, by treatment groups, and com-
pared by the log-rank test. Anti-Tat Ab titers and the per-
centage of DC internalizing Env were compared between 
vaccinees and placebos by the Student’s t test after log10 
transformation to normalize the data distribution. Wil-
coxon signed-rank test was used to assess the intensity 
of cross-clade anti-Tat Abs (measured as OD units) after 
immunization. Longitudinal analysis for repeated meas-
ures was applied for analysis of CD4+ T-cell number, 
after controlling normality assumption of variable dis-
tribution (Saphiro–Wilk test). The relationship between 
Tat-mediated Env entry in DC and anti-Tat or anti-Env 
Ab-binding titers or CD4+ T-cell number was assessed 
by the longitudinal regression model using the general-
ized estimating equations method. Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test was used to assess changes from baseline of CD4+ 
T-cell number in subjects not compliant to cART, while 
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was performed in order 
 Page 6 of 22
Ensoli et al. Retrovirology  (2016) 13:34 
to evaluate differences between non-cART-compliant 
vaccinees and placebos at each visit. Statistical analyses 
were carried out at two-sided with a 0.05 significance 
level, using SAS® (Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA).
Results
Patients accrual and demographic data
Seven-hundred-seventy cART-treated patients were 
assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Two hundred participants 
were enrolled between February 27, 2012 and 13 June, 
2013. Study was completed in June 2014. Participants 
were randomised 1:1 to one of the two treatment groups. 
Ninety-seven percent of enrolled participants completed 
the study.
All individuals were analyzed for safety. One subject 
who received only one immunization was excluded from 
the immunogenicity population (Fig. 1). Thirteen volun-
teers were excluded from the “Per Protocol” analysis for 
major protocol non-compliance (Fig. 1). Baseline demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of participants are 
shown in Table 1. Twenty-six percent of participants 
Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram. The number of participants screened, enrolled, randomized, followed-up and analyzed is shown for vaccine and 
placebo groups. Two hundred participants were randomised to one of the two treatment groups and analyzed for safety (safety population). One 
subject who received only one immunization was excluded from the immunogenicity population (total = 199). Thirteen volunteers were excluded 
from the “Per protocol” analysis: four received <3 immunizations, four did not complete three or more visits of follow-up and five had major protocol 
non-compliance (total = 187)

were male and 74 % female; all were black, except one 
volunteer. At the study entry the mean age was 36 years 
for both vaccinees and placebos. In vaccinees, the mean 
CD4+ T-cell count was 510 cells/µL, 95 % of them had 
undetectable HIV RNA, the mean years from HIV 
diagnosis was 5.0, while the mean time on cART was 
3.5 years, with 97 % on non-nucleoside reverse-tran-
scriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) or nucleoside reverse tran-
scriptase inhibitors (NRTI)-based and 3 % on PI-based 
regimens. In placebos, the mean CD4+ T-cell count was 
563 cells/µL, HIV RNA was undetectable in 96 % of them, 
the mean years from HIV diagnosis was 4.9 years, while 
the mean time on cART was 3.3, with 98 % on NNRTI or 
NRTI-based and 2 % on PI-based regimens.
HIV‑1 B‑clade Tat vaccine safety and tolerability
Tat immunization was safe and well tolerated without 
relevant differences between vaccinees and placebos. In 
particular, 190 patients (96 vaccinees and 94 placebos) 
experienced at least one AE during the study, mainly of 
mild intensity (Table 2). General disorders and admin-
istration site conditions were the most frequent AEs 
related to study treatment both in vaccinees (73 %) and 
placebos (58 %), followed by nervous system disorders 
(mainly headache events), which had higher incidence in 
placebos (38 %) than vaccinees (27 %) (Table 3). No seri-
ous AEs (SAE) related to study treatment or suspected 
unexpected adverse reactions were reported. The non-
serious AEs related to study drug were mostly mild and 
local. Most clinically relevant abnormal laboratory events 
were reported with a similar frequency in both the treat-
ment groups and were considered unrelated, since they 
are findings typically associated with HIV-1 infection (i.e. 
low haemoglobin, low neutrophil and white cell counts, 
increased viral load). Eight participants (two placebos 
and six vaccinees) reported at least one SAE (unrelated 
to study treatment). In particular, one placebo under-
went hysterectomy and one was diagnosed with type-II 
diabetes mellitus. Among the vaccinees, two participants 
were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, one patient 
was admitted to the hospital for respiratory tract infec-
tion, bronchiectasis-empyema thoracis and abdominal 
pain, one patient underwent hysterectomy, and inten-
tional self-injury was reported in two participants. All 
these SAE resolved completely, except the type II diabe-
tes mellitus.
Since no “important safety events” or “significant find-
ings” emerged during the study, the Data Safety Monitor-
ing Board concluded that the Tat vaccine is safe and well 
tolerated.
HIV‑1 B‑clade Tat vaccine induces durable anti‑Tat Abs 
of all subclasses
Tat immunization induced anti-Tat B-clade Abs in 97 % 
of vaccinees, whereas 20 % of placebos developed spon-
taneously anti-Tat Abs (all immunogenicity population 
evaluated). Anti-Tat Ab responses detected in vaccinees 
and placebos were significantly different (Chi square test, 
p < 0.0001, both for total Abs and Ig subclasses). In par-
ticular, 81 % of vaccinees developed anti-Tat B-clade IgM, 
96 % IgG, and 76 % IgA, as opposed to 10 % IgM, 13 % 
IgG, and 6 % IgA of placebos, respectively (Fig. 2a). As 
shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2b, 69 % of vaccinees developed 
anti-Tat Abs of all Ig subclasses, 28 % developed one or 
two Ig subclasses, and 3 % of vaccinees had no detect-
able anti-Tat Abs. In contrast, 1 % of placebos developed 
anti-Tat Abs of all three Ig subclasses, 19 % of one or 
two subclasses, and 80 % had no detectable anti-Tat Abs 
(Chi square test, p < 0.0001, Fig. 2b). Anti-Tat B-clade 
Ab mean titers peaked between week 8 and week 12 for 
all Ig subclasses and statistically significant differences

for IgG titers between vaccinees and placebos were 
observed since week 12 (weeks 12–24, p < 0.0001; week 
48 p = 0.0004) (Fig. 2c). Moreover, anti-Tat Ab responses 
persisted significantly longer in vaccinees as compared to 
placebos (log-rank test, p = 0.0019) (Fig. 3a). Further, Ab 
persistence was longer in vaccinees and placebos with 2 
or 3 Ab subclasses as compared to those with 1 subclass 
(Fig. 3b, c). The “Per Protocol” analysis confirmed the 
results from the immunogenicity population, in particu-
lar, 88/91 (97 %) and 20/96 (21 %) of vaccinees and pla-
cebos, respectively, developed anti-Tat Abs (p < 0.0001).
Vaccination with the HIV‑1 B‑clade Tat protein elicits Abs 
also recognizing Tat from A, C and D clades
The presence of anti-Tat Abs against clades other than 
B (i.e. C, D, A) was evaluated in the 99 vaccinees. Fifty-
one patients that were negative at baseline also for Abs 
against Tat from A, C, or D clade, after immunization 
with the B-clade Tat protein developed anti-Tat Abs 
recognizing Tat from one or more of these other clades 
(Table 5), in addition to Tat B clade.
At baseline (Fig. 4a), 29 vaccinees, although negative 
for anti-Tat Abs against B-clade Tat, had Abs against Tat 
of one or more of the other clades tested (76 % C clade, 
41 % A clade, 14 % D clade). After vaccination, all of them 
experienced a statistically significant increase of inten-
sity of these responses (Fig. 4b). In particular, changes of 
intensity from baseline levels were similar for IgM and 
IgA for all clades, while for IgG changes were higher for 
C and D clades.
Vaccination with the HIV‑1 B‑clade Tat protein induces 
cross‑clade neutralizing anti‑Tat Abs
The neutralization of B-clade Tat-mediated entry of oli-
gomeric B-clade Env in DC was used to investigate anti-
Tat Ab functional activity in 24 participants. This assay 
permits measuring HIV neutralization even in the pres-
ence of cART [57, 65], which interferes with traditional 
infection assays [77]. At baseline, entry of Env in the 
absence of Tat was comparable for all sera (Fig. 5a, left 
panel) and did not change after immunization (Fig. 5a, 
right panel). As shown previously [57], Tat increased 
entry of Env with all sera prior to immunization (base-
line) (Fig. 5b, left panel), whereas sera from vaccinees 
strongly reduced Env entry (more than 60 %) (week 
20 and 48, p < 0.0001). This occurred to a lesser extent 
also with sera from anti-Tat Ab-positive placebos (about 
37 % reduction) (Fig. 5b, right panel). No changes were 
observed in Ab-negative placebos (Fig. 5b, right panel). 
Differences between vaccinees and anti-Tat Ab-negative

placebos were statistically significant at both time 
points examined (week 20 and week 48 p = 0.0009 and 
p = 0.0003, respectively). Further, differences in reaching 
50 % neutralization (ND50) of Env entry were observed 
between vaccinees (11/13, 85 %) and the anti-Tat Ab-pos-
itive placebos (2/6, 33 %) (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.0460). 
Neutralization of Tat-mediated Env entry in DC was also 
analyzed for C clade Tat and Env. As shown in Fig. 6, 
anti-Tat Abs elicited by vaccination with the B-clade Tat 
protein induced cross-clade neutralizing Abs against B 
and C clade Tat/Env complex entry in DC (p < 0.0001 for 
both clades).
Anti‑Tat but not anti‑Env Abs correlate with neutralization 
of Env entry in vaccinees
To evaluate the role of both anti-Tat and anti-Env humoral 
responses on the neutralization of Tat-mediated entry 
of oligomeric Env in DC, anti-Env Abs were also tested 
(all immunogenicity population evaluated). At baseline, 
all subjects had anti-Env Abs (geometric mean Ab-titers 
72,408, range 200–409,600) with titers that did not change 
significantly during the follow-up (data not shown) and 
correlated positively with the levels of Tat-mediated Env 
entry in DC (r = 0.42, p = 0.0214), indicating lack of neu-
tralization. In contrast, after immunization, vaccinees 
showed a significant inverse relationship between anti-Tat 
IgM or IgG Ab titers (p = 0.0853 and p = 0.0039, respec-
tively) or anti-Env IgG titers (p = 0.0015) and the levels of 
Tat-mediated Env entry in DC (Table 6), indicating corre-
lation with neutralization of Env entry. Of note, anti-Env 
Ab titers did not correlate with neutralization of Env entry 
in anti-Tat Ab-negative placebos, indicating that anti-Env 
Abs require anti-Tat Abs to inhibit the Tat/Env complex 
formation and virus entry, as shown earlier both in vitro 
and in vivo [65, 70, 78].
Tat vaccination induces CD4+ T cell number increases, 
which correlate with neutralization
Compared to placebos, CD4+ T-cell counts increased 
significantly and progressively in vaccinees (Fig. 7) up

to week 24 when they peaked (mean gain of 60 cells/µL 
p = 0.0015), whereas at the end of the study (week 48) the 
mean gain compared to baseline values was of 28 cells/
µL. In contrast, placebos showed a slower kinetics and 
lower, and not statistically significant, increases (mean 
gain of 11 cells/µL), which peaked at 48 weeks with a 
mean value of 17 cells/µL as compared to baseline. CD4+ 
T-cell counts were also analyzed by treatment groups 
over time by applying a random-effect regression model. 
The increase from baseline of CD4+ T cells up to week 24 
was 2.2 cells/µL (95 % CI 1.1; 3.2, p < 0.0001) per week in 
vaccinees and 0.1 cells/µL (95 % CI 0.7; 3.4) per week in 
the placebo group, respectively. The difference between 
the coefficients of regression was statistically significant 
(p = 0.0031). The comparison between the two arms 
showed statistically significant changes from baseline at 
week 20 (p = 0.0466) and week 24 (p = 0.0250).
To evaluate the effect of vaccination on the increase 
of CD4+ T cells according to their levels at study entry, 
baseline values were stratified by quartiles. Increases up 
to about 90 cells/µL were detected in vaccinated sub-
jects in Q1, Q2, and Q3, while no significant changes 
were observed in Q4, indicating that vaccination had 
major effects in subjects with lower CD4+ T cell number 
at baseline (Fig. 8). Placebos showed significant CD4+ 
T-cell increases only in Q1 (up to 84 cells/µL). Of note, 
the gaining in CD4+ T-cell counts in Q1 was lower (up 
to 58 cells/µL) in placebos negative for anti-Tat Abs, who

also experienced a significant CD4+ T-cell decay in Q3 at 
week 20 (Fig. 8).
Further, CD4+ T-cell increases correlated significantly 
with neutralization of Env entry in DC in vaccinees 
(n = 19) (p = 0.0023) as compared to placebos (n = 11) 
(Table 7).
Tat vaccination maintains CD4+ T cells and contains viral 
load rebound in patients non‑compliant to therapy
Compliance was always verified at each study visit. How-
ever, despite counseling for adherence to therapy, medical 
records showed poor compliance (i.e. missing doses up to 
prolonged interruptions) in 24 volunteers, particularly 
between week 20 and 48 after the first immunization. Of 
them, 18 were vaccinees and 6 were placebos (1 anti-Tat 
Ab-positive and five anti-Tat Ab-negative). None of the 
vaccinees non-compliant to cART therapy experienced 
a decay of CD4+ T cells which, instead, increased above 
study entry levels (median increase of 50 cells/µL at week 
16, p = 0.0814, 57 cells/µL at week 20, p = 0.0987 and 
30 cells/µL at week 48, as compared to baseline). In con-
trast, the anti-Tat Ab-negative placebos had CD4+ T-cell 
decreases below study entry levels (median of −33 cells/
µL at week 12, p = 0.0625 and −60 cells/µL at week 48 
vs. baseline levels). Comparison between vaccinees and

anti-Tat Ab negative placebos showed significant differ-

respectively) (Fig. 9).
With regard to viral load, plasma viremia remained 
undetectable at week 48 in 12/18 (67 %) vaccinees, and in 
3/5 (60 %) of anti-Tat Ab-negative placebos. In addition, 
in patients with detectable viral load at week 48, the geo-
metric mean levels were lower in vaccinees (1090 copies/
mL), as compared to anti-Tat Ab-negative placebos

The development of therapeutic vaccination strategies 
for treating people already infected with HIV-1 has been 
recently accelerated, with an increasing number of vac-
cine candidates being tested in clinical trials, either in

cinees prior to immunization (n = 29, 76 % C clade, 41 % A clade, 14 % D clade). b Changes from baseline of IgM, IgG and IgA Ab responses (OD)

analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. p values assess the increase from baseline

drug-naïve patients or in association with cART. In drug-
naïve patients, therapeutic vaccines are expected to con-
tain infection (i.e. low to undetectable plasma viral load 
and CD4+ T cell preservation), preventing progression 
to disease as well as virus transmission, while in cART-
treated patients therapeutic vaccination is expected to 
intensify the efficacy of cART, thus supporting a more 
effective immune restoration and virological control, 
particularly in poor immunological responders or cART 
non-compliant patients, preventing progression to AIDS-
related as well as non AIDS-related diseases and virus 
transmission.
No therapeutic vaccines are currently market approved. 
However, the rapidly expanding HIV/AIDS therapeu-
tic vaccine field portraits a variety of approaches, which 
differ sensibly in many aspects, the most relevant being 
the antigen chosen (unlike preventative vaccines, regula-
tory and accessory genes are frequently targeted; in some 
cases almost the entire HIV genome is targeted), and the 
delivery systems, which range from simple subcutaneous, 
intradermal, or intramuscular vaccine administration 
to reinfusion of autologous DCs loaded ex vivo with the 
selected antigen(s) [9, 79–89]. In most vaccine trials con-
ducted in treated patients cART therapy was interrupted 
to assess the potency of the immunological control of 
infection provided by vaccination, while they were not 
aimed at evaluating the immunological recovery, with the 
exclusion of CD4+ T cell counts, which, however, did not 
appear to go beyond the restoration provided by cART 
alone [9, 79].
Our approach has focused on Tat, a key HIV virulence 
factor, which is released extracellularly in a biologically 
active form also under cART, and promotes virus reacti-
vation, replication and spreading while inducing immune 
activation and disabling the host immune defense 
(reviewed in [25]). Thus, induction of effective anti-Tat 
Abs may represent a pathogenesis-driven therapeutic 
intervention to block disease progression as indicated by

tion. Student’s t test was applied to evaluate the changes from baseline within and between treatment groups

the effects of long-lasting, high titers anti-Tat Abs in nat-
ural infection [9, 79] or after vaccination with Tat, which 
induced CD4+ T cell recovery, immune restoration, as 
well as reduction of immunoactivation and of proviral 
DNA in Italian subjects (ISS T-002 trial) [53, 57].
The results of the present study indicate that B-clade 
Tat immunization is safe and well tolerated also in South 
African individuals infected with a different virus sub-
type. Further, vaccination induced anti-Tat Abs in almost 
all vaccinees. Abs were durable, at high titers and of mul-
tiple subclasses. Remarkably, B-clade Tat vaccination 
induced cross-clade (A, C, D) Tat-binding Abs, which 
were capable of neutralizing Tat-mediated entry in DC of 
oligomeric HIV Env from B and C clade, suggesting that 
the B-clade Tat protein used in our vaccine program may 
be used for a cross-clade HIV vaccine approach.
A natural humoral anti-Tat Ab response developed in a 
small number of placebos, a finding expected from pre-
vious studies conducted in Italy and South Africa [53, 
54, 69, 70]. Indeed, as compared to the other HIV pro-
teins which elicit Abs virtually in all infected patients, 
production of anti-Tat Abs is seen only in about 20 % 
of the HIV-infected subjects present in all cohorts we 
have investigated. Surprisingly, although Tat is released 
extracellularly, only a small percentage of individuals 
recognizes and mounts an Ab response against this pro-
tein [66–70]. One reason could be its molecular mimicry 
for extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (FN) 
and vitronectin (VN) [90–92]. As for Tat, FN and VN 
possess a similar basic region and RGD sequence binding 
to the α5β1, αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins [93, 94].
In vaccinees, neutralization correlated positively with 
anti-Tat IgM and IgG Ab titers, whereas Env entry was 
not neutralized by anti-Env Abs in the absence of anti-
Tat Abs [57, 65]. Indeed, anti-Env Abs measured prior to 
immunization both in vaccinees and placebos had a posi-
tive correlation with increased levels of Tat-mediated Env 
entry in DC. This reproduces what has been seen earlier 
with sera from Italian vaccinees (ISS T-002 trial) or in 
monkey studies [57, 65]. In particular, by forming a com-
plex with Env, Tat increases virus entry in DC and blocks 
neutralization by anti-Env Abs, which is restored and fur-
ther increased only in the presence of anti-Tat Abs [65].
Tat vaccination was associated with significant 
increases of CD4+ T cells above baseline levels, whereas 
placebos showed a slower kinetics and lower, and not sta-
tistically significant, increases, as expected in individuals 
on cART for a mean of about 3 years. Increases of CD4+ 
T cells in vaccinees correlated significantly with neu-
tralization. Of note, CD4+ T cells increased particularly 
in vaccinees with lower CD4+ T cell counts at baseline. 
This is of particular relevance since poor immunological 
response to therapy is frequent either in patients start-
ing cART late, even if virologically suppressed [4–8], or 
in patients with persistent immune activation [95–99] 
or low compliant [100–103]. A poor CD4+ T cell recov-
ery (<500 T cells/μL) is associated with disease pro-
gression, co-morbidities, hospitalization and death 
[104–107]. These patients are those that most require 
ART intensification.
While in the ISS T-002 trial conducted in Italy patients 
were highly compliant to therapy, compliance was lower

in the ISS T-003 study, a finding particularly frequent 
in Southern Africa where scarce adherence to cART 
therapy represents a relevant clinical problem since it is 
associated with disease progression, virus drug resist-
ance and transmission [108–111]. Of interest, none of the 
vaccinees non-compliant to cART therapy experienced 
a decay of CD4+ T cells, and in most of them plasma 
viremia remained undetectable at week 48 while, in those 
with detectable viremia, viral load levels were low. In con-
trast, the anti-Tat Ab-negative placebos had CD4+ T-cell

decreases below entry levels, and in most of them plasma 
viremia rebounded to geometric mean levels higher than 
those recorded in non-compliant vaccinees. Although 
these results are only descriptive, since the groups are too 
small to draw any firm conclusion, they indicate the need 
of ad hoc studies to address whether cART intensification 
by Tat therapeutic immunization may mitigate the effects 
of low adherence to therapy. To this end, structured ther-
apy interruption studies after cART intensification by the 
Tat vaccine are being planned.
The results of the ISS T-003 trial are highly consistent 
with those of the ISS T-002 [53, 57], although the two tri-
als were conducted in individuals with different genetic 
background, infected with HIV from different subtypes 
(B vs. C clade), and on cART for different periods of 
time (i.e. mean of 6 years in the ISS T-002 trial vs. about 
3 years in the ISS T-003 trial). Indeed, safety and immu-
nogenicity results were remarkably similar, sometimes 
identical, as were the CD4+ T-cell increments, particu-
larly in subjects with lower levels at baseline [53, 57], 
suggesting that poor immunological responders to ther-
apy could greatly benefit from Tat immunotherapy.
The results from the Italian trial (ISS T-002) clearly 
indicate that proviral DNA reduction (as opposed to 
CD4+ T cell increase) is a late event, particularly under 
NNRTI-based drug regimens requiring 108 weeks for 
detecting a significant proviral reduction [57]. Indeed, 
no significant reductions of proviral DNA are seen at 
week 48 in both (ISS T-002 and ISS T-003) trials (data 
not shown). Furthermore, it appears that time on effec-
tive cART is also relevant, in that proviral DNA decay 
plateau after about 4–5 years of successful therapy 
[112, 113]. Thus, unlike the Italian trial in which vac-
cinees had been on therapy on average for 6 years, sub-
jects enrolled in the South African study had been on 
cART for around 3 years. Altogether these data indicate 
that longer periods of time are required to see an effect 
on proviral DNA in NNRTI-treated South African sub-
jects, which represent 97 % of the trial population.
Therefore, similarly to the ISS T-002 trial, a roll-over 
observational study (ISS T-003 EF-UP) has been initi-
ated for the South African trial to ensure the extended 
follow-up of the volunteers, in order to evaluate the per-
sistence of vaccine-induced immune responses as well as 
the immunological and virological effects of Tat immuni-
zation. In particular, proviral DNA will be monitored to 
verify whether Tat vaccination is capable of reducing it, 
as observed for the ISS T-002 trial after 3 years from vac-
cination [57].
Conclusions
These data indicate that immunization with B clade Tat 
induced functionally effective cross-clade anti-Tat Abs
