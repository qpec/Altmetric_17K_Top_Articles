ABSTRACT 
People with advanced COPD experience distressing physical and psychological symptoms, 
often have limited understanding of their condition, and infrequently discuss end of life 
issues in routine clinical care. These are strong indicators for expert multidisciplinary 
palliative care incorporating assessment and management of symptoms and concerns, 
patient and caregiver education, and sensitive communication to elicit preferences for care 
towards the end of life. The unpredictable course of COPD and difficulty predicting survival 
remain barriers to timely referral and receipt of palliative care. Early integration of palliative 
care with respiratory, primary care and rehabilitation services, with referral based on the 
complexity of symptoms and concerns, rather than prognosis, can improve patient and carer 
outcomes. Models of integrated working in COPD could include: services triggered by 
troublesome symptoms such as refractory breathlessness; short-term palliative care; and in 
settings with limited access to palliative care, consultation only in specific circumstances, or 
for the most complex patients. 
Keywords: breathlessness, COPD, integrated care, palliative care, symptom management

BACKGROUND 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major contributor to global morbidity 
and mortality.1,2 Despite declining rates in smoking in developed countries, tobacco 
consumption in low-to-middle incomes is increasing, and global COPD prevalence is 
projected to rise due to population growth and aging. 3 The disease is characterised by 
chronic airflow limitation and symptoms of breathlessness, exercise intolerance and cough.4 
The mainstay of pharmacological treatment is inhaled bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory 
therapies. These have modest effects on airflow limitation and rates of exacerbations, but 
not survival.5 COPD is recognised as a multi-system disease with impacts beyond the lung 
associated with symptom burden and prognosis.4,6,7 Further, many people with COPD have 
multiple other conditions. A recent meta-analysis of published literature found that COPD is 
associated with significantly higher comorbidities than other diseases.8 Thus, even when 
medical treatment is optimised, a significant proportion of people with COPD continue to 
experience symptom related distress.9 Hence, there is a clear role for additional 
intervention with the therapeutic aims to reduce symptoms, improve functioning and 
optimise quality of life. 
Within this context, palliative care might be expected to play a prominent role in the 
management of people with COPD. Palliative care is “an approach that improves the quality 
of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening 
illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering”.10 It puts the person before the 
disease, affirms life, and regards death as a normal process. Palliative care supports people 
to live fully through the early identification, and impeccable assessment and treatment of 
physical, psychosocial and spiritual concerns, providing education around illness to patients 
and families; and discussing treatment preferences towards the end of life (Figure 1).2,11 
Evidence supporting involvement of palliative care in non-cancer conditions is growing, 
including early in the course of disease. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis 
pooling data on patients (n=12,731) and caregivers (n=2,479) demonstrated palliative care is 
associated with improvements in patient symptom burden (standardized mean difference 
SMD; −0.66; 95% CI, −1.25 to −0.07), quality of life (SMD 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.83) over 1 to 
3 months, and a consistent pattern of lower health care utilisation.12

Almost 20 years ago, the SUPPORT study of the seriously ill admitted to hospital, advocated 
for earlier and enhanced palliative care for people with COPD, including in those remaining 
open to life-sustaining treatments.13 However, there are barriers to palliative care referral in 
COPD and progress has been slow. The disease has an unpredictable course, punctuated by 
frequent exacerbations, and often without a distinct terminal phase.14 Clinicians are poor at 
predicting the survival of patients with COPD, even when they are hospitalised.15,16 Although 
composite prognostic indices such as the BODE and ADO can help,17,18 these lack the 
accuracy required to change short-term management of individuals (C statistics for survival 
0.61 and 0.74), in part because they do not consider non-respiratory causes of death such as 
cardiovascular disease. It is therefore unsurprising that compared with other chronic 
illnesses people with COPD remain less likely to be referred to palliative care.19 Even in 
patients with advanced disease such as those on long term oxygen therapy or hospitalised 
with exacerbation, large cohort studies show only 2-20% have accessed palliative care 
services.19,20 Population based studies comparing symptom burden to palliative care receipt 
suggest this gap between COPD and other chronic illnesses is widening with time.21,22 
leading to poorer quality end of life care.23  People with COPD are more likely to die in a 
hospital setting compared with people with lung cancer,24 which is against the general 
preference to die at home.25 In a UK population-based study spanning 14 years, 67% of 
people with COPD died in hospital whilst 20% died at home, and  <1% died in a hospice 
setting.26 
The aims of this review are to (i) describe the common physical and psychosocial symptoms 
and concerns of people with advanced COPD; (ii) summarise current evidence on how these 
can be addressed using palliative care interventions; and (iii) consider models of integrated 
palliative care in COPD and evidence for their effectiveness. 
SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA 
Data for this review were identified by searches of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and 
EMBASE databases. We used the search terms “palliative care”, “end of life”, “symptom”, 
“breathlessness”, “communication”, “advance care planning”, AND “respiratory” or “COPD”, 
and hand searched reference lists from retrieved articles. We considered articles published 
in English between 1980 and 2017, but predominantly selected publications from the past 5 
 5 
 
years. When assessing the effectiveness of an intervention or service model, systematic 
reviews and meta-analysis were selected over individual randomised controlled trials, and 
where possible we extracted data or calculated effect sizes. When considering the 
symptoms, concerns and experiences of people with advanced COPD we selected 
observational and qualitative studies to support our interpretation of evidence. 
COMMON EXPERIENCES OF ADVANCED COPD  
The common experiences of people living with advanced COPD reveal multiple areas of 
need. A meta-synthesis of qualitative studies found that patients consistently report a 
limited understanding of their condition, a sustained symptom burden, and the unrelenting 
psychosocial impact of disease (Figure 2).27 The slow onset of symptoms leads some 
patients to interpret COPD as a normal aging, and with its long course the seriousness of the 
disease is not always appreciated.28 Patients may take a stoical approach to their symptoms, 
perceiving them as a “way of life” rather than components of progressive illness.29  
Patients with COPD report a median of 11-14 symptoms,30,31 which is a comparable number 
to patients with advanced lung cancer.32,33  Multimorbidity is common in COPD and 
symptoms may relate to, for example, concomitant heart failure or diabetes.34 In a large 
cross-sectional study, almost half of patients with COPD aged over 65 had at least three 
other conditions.35 This sustained symptom burden often results in patients focusing on 
maintaining or adapting to the present, rather than looking to the future.36,37 
The psychosocial impact of COPD is multifaceted and can be influenced by the disease, but 
also the shame and guilt that smokers who develop COPD can carry, sometimes reinforced 
by social attitudes.27 Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent,38,39 and can exacerbate 
other symptoms including breathlessness. Conversely, breathlessness can limit patient 
function to such an extent that disability leads to isolation and loneliness. In open interviews 
patients describe the ‘invisibility’ of their problems.40 It is easy for patients to feel 
demeaned by the limitations of the illness and question ‘why me?’. These feelings may lead 
people to feel unworthy of care, shun company, or not seek help.40,41  Younger patients with 
COPD, such as those with an inherited condition (alpha1-antritrypsin deficiency), may carry 
the additional burden of balancing illness with a young family and/or continuing 
employment. Up to 1 in 10 people with COPD report a loss of dignity; ‘the quality or state of 
 6 
 
being worthy, honoured, or esteemed’, which in cross-sectional studies is associated with 
requiring assistance to self-care, anxiety and depression, and being uncertain about future 
health care.42-44 
ADDRESSING SYMPTOMS AND CONCERNS 
For all symptoms, medical management of the underlying condition needs to be optimised 
and accurate diagnosis of contributing factors to symptoms must be elucidated. Optimal 
medical management of the stable patient with COPD comprises prevention strategies 
(smoking cessation, influenza / pneumococcal vaccination), reducing symptom burden and 
preventing exacerbations and hospitalisations. This has been summarised recently by the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.4 In patients with advanced COPD, the 
mainstay of pharmacologic treatment is dual combination bronchodilator therapy, 
comprising long-acting beta 2 agonist and muscarinic antagonist (LABA/LAMA). These have 
modest benefits on FEV1, health status, exercise tolerance and reduction of exacerbations, 
with additive benefits over monotherapy. Inhaled corticosteroids, used in conjunction with 
bronchodilator therapy, reduce exacerbations.4 To date however, no inhaled therapy has 
been shown to convincingly reduce long-term lung function decline or mortality. 
Of the non-pharmacologic therapies, pulmonary rehabilitation, a multi-disciplinary program 
of care comprising exercise-training and education (particularly around self-management), 
significantly improves exercise tolerance, dyspnea, health status and psychological 
morbidity in those who are medically optimised.45 Long term oxygen therapy is 
recommended in patients with COPD and severe hypoxemia,46 but does not improve 
survival, exercise tolerance, symptoms or reduce hospitalizations in those with moderate 
hypoxemia or exercise-induced oxygen desaturation alone.47 Ventilatory support is a 
standard of care for acute type II respiratory failure during severe exacerbations of COPD, 
but there is increasing evidence to support the use of domiciliary non-invasive ventilation in 
select patients with persistent hypercapnia following hospitalization.48 Surgical options 
include lung volume reduction surgery which improves survival in select patients with 
heterogeneous upper-lobe emphysema and poor exercise capacity,49 whilst lung 
transplantation in appropriate selected patients with very severe COPD has been shown to 
increase exercise capacity and quality of life.

Palliative care may be proposed to patients and families as an additional layer of expert 
support and can lead on or share symptom management with other teams.50 
Comprehensive symptom assessment using patient reported outcome measures helps to 
identify each individual’s symptoms and concerns.51,52 This includes not only symptom 
severity but the impact on the patient’s life and that of their carers. Symptom management 
can then be put in the context of the individual’s situation with their own goals leading the 
direction of care.  Management considerations for common symptoms in advanced COPD 
are provided in Table 1 with key references and supporting evidence. Treatable causes 
relating to disease management, e.g. cough due to ACE-inhibitors or dry mouth due to 
LAMAs, should be excluded and core practices, e.g. correct inhaler technique, should be 
reinforced. There is often a paucity of evidence specific to symptom control in COPD, so 
approaches may be based on cancer, though the trial evidence base for cancer-specific 
palliative care is only marginally greater. Standard texts provide more complete 
information.53,54 The cardinal symptoms of advanced COPD are breathlessness, fatigue and 
cough, which co-exist so frequently they are sometimes called the ‘respiratory cluster’.55 
Breathlessness 
Non-pharmacological interventions take priority in the mobile patient and can be helpful 
even in advanced disease.56  Supporting patients to self-manage can increase their 
individual’s self-efficacy and reduce feelings of helplessness in both patient and carer.56  This 
can lead to a virtuous circle of reduced anxiety and depression, more activity and social 
contact, and improved quality of life. The following may have value for the mobile patient: 
increasing physical activity by means of activity pacing, mobility aids, and an individual 
exercise plan; use of the hand held fan or cold water spray to palliate the sensation of 
breathlessness;57 breathing retraining;58 and support for carers including education.59,60 
Other interventions such as behavioural therapies or Tai Chi may be useful, depending on 
the individual and are worthy of further study.61 A written individualised ‘crisis plan,’ 
outlining actions to palliate breathlessness may enable the patient and carer to have a 
reminder of effective actions available when feeling overwhelmed by fear, or at moments of 
severe episodic breathlessness.62 These interventions have been combined into services for 
people with breathlessness that persists despite optimal management of disease (see Table 
1 and ‘Integration of palliative care and respiratory services’).63,64  
 8 
 
The neurophysiology of breathlessness is complex and incompletely understood. The 
‘Breathing Thinking Functioning’ approach can help to explain and choose component 
interventions. 60 In those with ‘breathing’ dysfunction, for example, specialist physiotherapy 
may be most appropriate. Breathlessness can be driven by unhelpful incorrect thoughts 
about breathlessness (patients might feel they are going to die during a breathlessness 
episode) or believe long-term resting will help reduce the symptom. The ‘thinking’ cycle may 
be dominant in that patient and to change these cognitions before doing anything else is 
likely most effective.  Like many people living with a chronic relapsing and remitting disease, 
patients with COPD have higher levels of anxiety which in turn can exacerbate 
breathlessness. Anxiety and breathlessness are particularly linked because of the role the 
amygdala and higher cortical centres have in the genesis of both symptoms. Other patients 
may be most affected by the ‘functioning’ vicious circle; resting to avoid breathlessness, and 
so becoming deconditioned, breathless and fatigued at lower levels of function. Helping the 
patient to become more active will be the priority here, with pacing advice, goal setting and 
mobility aids as indicated. 
There is limited evidence for most pharmacological approaches for breathlessness, and 
research is urgently needed into effective drug treatments (Table 1). Pharmacological 
treatments do not address the underlying cycles from psychosocial problems or unhelpful 
cognitions that may drive breathlessness, and therefore any pharmacological treatment 
may benefit from being combined with non-pharmacological treatments. The more severe 
and unremitting the breathlessness is, the more likely that pharmacological treatment is 
needed. Three main classes of drug are routinely used to palliate breathlessness: opioids, 
benzodiazepines and anti-depressants. 
Opioids have the largest evidence base though it is not substantial. A recent Cochrane 
review and meta-analysis of the few small trials available concluded that ‘There is some low 
quality evidence that shows benefit for the use of oral or parenteral opioids to palliate 
breathlessness, although the number of included participants was small.’ There was no 
evidence to support nebulised opioids. Subgroup analysis including only those with COPD 
produced similar results. The review recommended that ‘ Further research with larger 
numbers of participants, using standardised protocols and with quality of life measures 
included, is needed’.65  Ekstrom et al re-analysed these results as they believed that the 
 9 
 
analysis  ‘did not account for matched data of crossover trials’ (11/12 included trials), and 
on this basis argued that the true effect was larger than that found by the Cochrane 
review.66 The Cochrane review of opioids for breathlessness did not report differences in 
survival or emergency room visits, but this was rarely studied. Some patients choose not to 
continue opioids because of adverse effects.67 Some concerns have recently been raised 
regarding opioids for pain in COPD (see ‘Pain’ section). Taken together these findings 
suggest that in those patients where non-pharmacological approaches are no longer 
effective, opioids currently have the best evidence base among drugs to help refractory 
breathlessness especially in advanced disease, at the end of life and in the most severe 
breathlessness. They will not suit all and further research is needed especially in longer term 
effects.  As with opioids used for pain relief, it is essential to seek and actively treat potential 
adverse effect such as nausea, vomiting and constipation. 
Benzodiazepines, although widely used, have no evidence to support their use. They have a 
high potential for dependency and are very difficult to withdraw – with both physical and 
psychological dependence developing rapidly. A recent Cochrane review found no evidence 
for or against benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in people with advanced 
cancer or COPD.68 Benzodiazepines caused more drowsiness as an adverse effect compared 
to placebo, but less compared to morphine. In clinical practice therefore, benzodiazepines 
may be considered as a second- or third-line treatment, when opioids and non-
pharmacological measures have failed to control breathlessness. They may be suitable 
during anxiety and/or at the very end of life. There is a need for well-conducted and 
adequately powered studies.  
Antidepressants have been mooted as possible treatments for breathlessness because of 
serotonergic pathways involved in the genesis of the symptom. Several trials have 
foundered because of the difficulties of drug interactions in patients with advanced disease 
who are taking a wide range of agents. Depression commonly accompanies breathlessness 
therefore there is a rationale for having a low threshold for using this group when there is 
accompanying depression. Many palliative care physicians favour mirtazapine (which is not 
a first line anti-depressant) because: (i) it is anxiolytic at low doses (ii) it is tetracylic 
antidepressant that affects nor-adrenergic and serotonergic pathways in the brain stem – 
 10 
 
both known to be involved in the central genesis of breathlessness. Fully powered trials are 
now needed. 
There is no evidence to show that oxygen palliates the sensation of breathlessness in 
patients without hypoxia, though it may be essential for other disease-related morbidities 
such as hypoxia reducing exercise tolerance, or its association with cognitive impairment. A 
number of other drugs have been tried (e.g. cannabinoids, furosemide, heliox) in the 
management of breathlessness, but none can be recommended outside a clinical trial. 
Fatigue 
Fatigue is a profound feeling of physical and psychological weariness not relieved by sleep 
or rest. Fatigue management has some overlap with breathlessness. Both require 
psychological approaches and, paradoxically for patients, increased physical activity can be 
helpful. Sleep quantity and quality is important, and often reported to be poor. A complete 
assessment is essential, paying attention to physical activity, psychological status, beliefs 
and sleep habits 69. Providing education to support self-management,70 improving the 
patient’s psychological resilience, and addressing depression are key to improving fatigue.71 
Individualised exercise and rehabilitation plans may improve physical activity and 
independence in daily activities 72. Based on limited evidence, no drug treatment can 
currently be recommended, though research is focused on modafinil and 
methylphenidate.73 
Cough 
Cough can be very distressing for patients. Optimal respiratory management includes 
mucolytics treating infection, and sputum clearance physiotherapy as appropriate.74 Non-
pharmacological treatments for refractory cough may include patient education on cough 
reflex hyper-sensitivity and the effect of repeated coughing, laryngeal hygiene and 
hydration, e.g. through use of nasal breathing, cough control techniques, and 
psychoeducation counselling.75 Birring et al. combined these in a complex Physiotherapy and 
Speech and Language Intervention (PSALTI), which in a randomised controlled trial (n=75) 
reduced cough frequency and improved patient quality of life.76 Although delivered using 
therapist expertise, written treatment guidelines and prompt sheets may improve 
 11 
 
availability and support use by other clinicians.75 Based on limited evidence, no antitussive 
drug treatment can currently be recommended. Evaluation of centrally acting 
neuromodulator drugs such as Gabapentin, widely used for refractory cough, is needed for 
COPD.77 There are promising antitussives in development for refractory cough such as P2X3 
antagonists that target cough sensory nerves; which should be evaluated for use in COPD.78  
Pain 
Pain can be related to the systemic impacts of COPD and its management (e.g. osteoporosis 
due to long-term steroid use), and pre-existing co-morbidities (such as osteoarthritis).79 
Long-term pharmacological management of chronic non-malignant pain is challenging and 
needs to be individualised. Assessment of the cause and relieving factors of pain is key, and 
many patients may have several different pains, each with a different aetiology. Cicely 
Saunders, founder of the modern hospice movement, development the concept of ‘total 
pain’ with physical, emotional, spiritual and social components, all of which must be 
considered in any assessment.80 
Pain management in chronic illness has advanced considerably in recent decades.  The WHO 
approach of an “analgesic ladder” with non-opioid analgesics (step 1), followed by a mild 
opioid (step 2) and strong opioids (step 3) in patients with persistent pain remains at the 
cornerstones of practice.50 Non-opioid drugs (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs –NSAIDs) are effective analgesics for patients with mild pain and can be combined 
with opioids in patients with moderate to severe pain. Drugs should be given orally 
(wherever possible) and regularly, rather than waiting for pain to break through. Opioid 
treatment should be at the lowest effective dose.81 It should slowly titrate to individual 
patient need, calculating the previous 24 hour dose by summing the regular plus ‘as 
required’ doses.  There are newer analgesics, different routes of administration (e.g. 
sublingual, subcutaneous, transdermal, intra-nasal), long and short acting medications for 
different pain durations, techniques to manage neuropathic pain  and research into 
approaches to “switch” opioids, which may be useful if side effects are problematic, in 
instances of renal failure and, in some cases, to improve effectiveness of pain relief or in 
cases when the person responds poorly to morphine because of their genetic makeup. 
However, most of this research is among patients with cancer or musculosketal pain, and 
 12 
 
evidence in COPD is limited.82 Common side effects should be managed and explained, 
including constipation, drowsiness and nausea/vomiting. 
A retrospective cohort study using routine data from Canada recently raised some safety 
concerns regarding opioid use for pain relief in COPD, although the analysis focussed on 
people not in advanced stages of disease. The authors used propensity scoring to try to 
reduce the effects of sample biases (e.g. people prescribed opioids for pain being different 
from those not being needed this treatment). Patients prescribed opioids had higher 
emergency room visits and mortality compared to those who did not (Hazard Ratios (HR) all-
cause mortality 1.76, 95% CI 1.57–1.98), but had lower outpatient exacerbations (HR 0.88, 
95% CI 0.83–0.94).83 A longitudinal, population-based study of patients starting long-term 
oxygen therapy from Sweden also studied opioid prescribing in COPD, and found that most 
prescriptions (97%) were for pain, with only 2% for breathlessness, 1% other.84 Patients and 
clinicians commonly express concerns about dependence and addiction from opioids,85 yet 
the event rate for addiction and abuse is very low.82 
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CARE 
The distress of living with COPD is widely recognised but can be difficult to address in clinical 
practice, with calls for ‘more holistic care’ from those involved in clinical standard setting.4,86 
Going beyond physical symptoms and treating the whole person is important, as patients 
living with advanced disease place high value on achieving a sense of control, strengthening 
relationships with loved ones, maintaining dignity, and coming to peace spiritually. 44,87,88 
An important role of the clinical team includes countering any self-blaming cognitions that 
can heighten the chances of rumination and depression. Psychological and/or lifestyle 
interventions, including exercise, can be used to help improve anxiety and depression in 
COPD.89,90 Cognitive behavioural techniques are increasingly incorporated within pulmonary 
rehabilitation programmes, psychologists are often part of the respiratory team, and 
specialist nurses or physiotherapists are now more likely to use psychological strategies as 
part of care than was previously seen.91 There is still uncertainty about when 
pharmacological intervention is needed or which strategies are most effective.92 Dignity 
conserving therapy and spiritual support (in its broadest sense) can also reduce the loss of 
self–esteem and feeling a burden to others. Dignity therapy also provides an opportunity for 
 13 
 
people to reflect on things that matter. It uses questions like ‘what would you want your 
family to know and remember about you?’, ‘what are your most important 
accomplishments/at what times did you feel most alive?’ and ‘what have you learned that 
you would want to pass on to others?’93 Trials of dignity therapy as conducted in cancer are 
required in COPD.93 94 
As well as managing psychosocial morbidity, we suggest that improving resilience and well-
being in people living with COPD is also important. Emerging evidence suggests that 
enhancing psychological well-being may attenuate the inflammatory response.95 The ‘five 
ways to well-being’ provides one framework to support patients and their families, and 
emphasises the importance continuing to exercise (be active), being open to a non-
judgemental, more compassionate awareness of current reality (take notice), learning new 
skills (keep learning), and remaining connected to a wider social network (connect). The 
reminder to remain altruistic (give) reinforces that patient’s feel psychologically enriched by 
being engaged with the needs of others. Benzo et al’s work suggests higher levels of 
Emotional Intelligence are also associated with better outcomes regardless of age or disease 
severity.96  
Support for carers, family members and those close to the patient 
The disability, uncertainty and emotional toll associated with COPD can inflict a heavy 
burden on caregivers, families and those close to the patient, who may have health 
problems of their own, resulting in persistent stress and physical demands. The 
psychological care and support of the family and caregivers has recently been reviewed in 
depth.97,98  One of the problems supporting carers is that they are rarely identified, although 
patients living with a carer are shown to have fewer exacerbations and admissions.97,99 The 
first step is therefore to identify carers (who may not be cohabitees) and their roles.98 Carer 
support can include: assessment and active treatment of depression and anxiety; education 
around the disease, symptoms, and relationship management; and bereavement support.100 
It can be valuable to acknowledge the positive aspects of caregiving, such as personal 
growth and a deepen relationship.101 
COMMUNICATION AND CARE PLANNING 
 14 
 
Need for improved communication 
In qualitative studies patients with COPD commonly express concern about the lack of 
education around disease progression and end of life, which can prompt anxiety around 
what the end of life will entail.27,102 End of life issues are infrequently discussed.102  In 
representative observational studies only 1 in 6 patients with advanced COPD,103 and 1 in 3 
patients dependent on oxygen,104 had discussed life-sustaining treatments, prognosis, the 
dying process, or spirituality. When end of life discussions do occur, the quality of 
communication is rated highly, suggesting the key to improving communication is to 
overcome initial barriers to these discussions taking place.102 From systematic reviews, 
patient-reported barriers include a lack of understanding about their condition, and a belief 
that health care professionals will initiate discussions about end of life care at the 
appropriate time.104,105 Health care professional barriers include a lack of time and 
communication skills, uncertainty around prognosis, feeling that end of life discussions 
conflict with disease management, and not wanting to dispel hope.104,105 Fragmented care 
between acute and primary care services can also result in a diffusion of responsibility 
where no one is sure who should initiate conversations about end of life care.105 
Talking about End of Life Care and meeting preferences  
Narrative reviews suggest that discussion and education about the course of disease, 
prognosis, care preferences, and spiritual issues are valued by people with advanced 
COPD.106,107 Care preferences towards the end of life may concern which life-sustaining 
treatments patients wish to receive or not (e.g. tube feeding, mechanical ventilation and 
cardio-pulmonary resuscitation),103 where they would prefer to receive care, and the 
location in which they may choose to die.107 End of life discussions are not associated with 
increased distress, worry or depression,108 but are associated with care being more 
consistent with patient preferences, less aggressive care at the end of life, earlier hospice 
referral, and improved family bereavement.109 Discussion is recommended early on to 
ensure subsequent care is in keeping with the patient’s preferences should they lose 
capacity to express them.109 
Best practice for end of life communication comprises exploring illness understanding, 
eliciting decision-making preferences, understanding patients’ priorities and goals, exploring

views on trade-offs and wishes for family caregiver involvement, and sharing information 
about prognosis (including uncertainty) in line with their preferences.109,110 Awareness of 
individual communication preferences is crucial, as whilst most patients express openness 
to end of life issues, this is not always the case. Health professionals should be sensitive to 
the preference not discuss end of life care, and provide ongoing opportunities to revisit it.111  
When discussing end of life, some patients want explicit information while others prefer the 
‘bigger picture’ and are ambivalent about likely prognosis.112,113  
The dynamic or unstable nature of preferences should not be underestimated. In stable 
outpatients with advanced COPD, about one-third of patients change their preference for 
life-sustaining treatments over one year, and two-thirds change their willingness to accept 
these treatments.101,114 There can be a tension between wishing to die at home (which most 
people prefer) and being admitted to hospital, especially when the chance of survival 
following hospital treatment is high – the SUPPORT study found that inpatient mortality in 
people with COPD admitted in respiratory failure was 11%.13 This makes the decision not to 
admit (or not be admitted) very difficult, especially as it is not possible to predict survival 
even in the acute situations.15,16 It is not known to what extent people with COPD change 
their preferences for place and goals of care, once they are in the midst of an exacerbation.  
Discussions about end of life care may occur as part of an Advance Care Planning (ACP) 
process. ACP interventions aim to improve and often document communication between 
the patient, their family, and healthcare professionals about their values and preferences 
for end of life care.115 In patient populations, a systematic review of 55 randomised 
controlled trial found that ACP led to increased discussion of end of life issues between 
patients and their health care professionals (OR 2.82 [95% CI 2.09-3.79]) and increased 
completion of advanced directives (OR 3.26 [95% CI 2.00-5.32]).116 Only three studies 
reported the effect of ACP on subsequent care and all found it closed the gap between 
patient preferences and subsequent care delivery. Two further studies, including one using 
an ACP-related patient feedback form with people with COPD,117 found ACP quality of 
communication.116 Given the diversity and complexity of ACP interventions it is important to 
remain cautious about implementing specific interventions. With few studies examined the 
effect of ACP on subsequent care and only one study focused on patients with COPD, future 
research on effectiveness on patient and family outcomes is needed.

INTEGRATING PALLIATIVE CARE IN COPD SERVICES 
Indications for palliative care 
Guidelines suggest that palliative care should begin at the time of diagnosis of a life-limiting 
illness, recognising that symptom control is key to ensuring optimal quality of life.4,50 The 
American Thoracic Society endorses the concept that palliative care should be available at 
all stages of illness, and emphasises the value of palliative care including when curative or 
restorative treatments are being offered.50 In the US, patients with COPD are eligible for 
hospice benefit under Medicare if they meet criteria for the terminal stage of pulmonary 
disease (life expectancy 6 months or less) of; severe chronic lung disease with disabling 
breathlessness at rest and decreased functional capacity, plus progression as evidenced by 
visits to the emergency department or hospital admission.50 Most insurers require the 
physicians to certify that they expect the patient to die within 6 months. The uncertainty 
around prognostication seemingly leads to referral delay, with almost one-third of patients 
dying within one week of referral.9 
We advocate for early integration of palliative care with respiratory, primary care and 
rehabilitation services, and referral based on complexity of symptoms and concerns, rather 
than estimated prognosis. Early integration allows longer for established relationships 
between palliative care staff and patient, and avoids crisis management during impending 
death.118 Expertise from the palliative care team, with the required skills for managing 
complex psychological, social, and emotional aspects of illness, may also release time for the 
respiratory physician to focus on medical management.119 Alongside symptom severity,63,64  
indicators of deterioration that can be used to trigger referral, include hospitalisation with 
an exacerbation (particularly with respiratory failure requiring mechanical or non-invasive 
ventilation), declining functional status, and co-morbidities.120,121 Qualitative studies find 
these criteria are acceptable to patients and their families.62,122 
Integration of palliative care in COPD services 
Models that integrate palliative care with existing services are needed, such as those being 
implemented in oncology.123-125 In most countries, palliative care teams in hospital and 
community settings provide the majority of patient contacts. Teams in hospice settings may 
 17 
 
offer respiratory clinics, rehabilitation services, and provide care for people with COPD at 
the end of life, though the proportion of patients seen in the hospice setting remains 
small.26 
Randomised controlled trials provide good quality evidence that early integration of 
palliative care with respiratory and/or primary care services can alleviate the effects of 
breathlessness on quality of life and its distress, in patients with COPD and their families, 
without increasing overall costs of health, social and informal care.63,64 In one trial there was 
also improved survival, as a secondary outcome, and improved dignity and patient and 
family satisfaction.122 Service specifications of these case-examples are detailed in Table 2, 
which often involve short-term early integration of palliative care. In a small feasibility trial, 
patients were randomised to usual care or a nurse-led palliative care intervention 4 weeks 
following hospital discharge.126 In this context the additional intervention overlapped 
considerably with respiratory discharge planning,127 and few new actions were instigated.126 
Other interventions have been implemented as quality improvement programmes but not 
tested in controlled settings. Rocker and Cook’s “Implementing a Novel and Supportive 
Program of Individualised Care for Patients and Families Living with Respiratory Disease” 
(INSPIRED) model of care includes an action plan, advance care planning, and use of low 
dose opioids in advanced COPD. The program aims to support people to die at home, and 
initial service evaluations suggests a reduction in unplanned hospital admissions can be 
achieved.128,129  Advanced COPD clinics led by respiratory medicine with palliative care 
consultation only for the most complex patients have also been described, 130 but again 
require formal testing. Figure 2 summarises models of integrated palliative care, based on 
examples identified in our literature search. 
Integration of palliative care with pulmonary rehabilitation 
A pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme typically comprises >25 hours of face-to-face 
contact with a health care professional representing an opportunity to provide treatments  
to address symptoms and concerns, educate around disease- and self-management skills, 
and to introduce palliative care if indicated. Some goals of PR and palliative care overlap. 
Both services target symptom management, functional independence and quality of life. 
Both address psychological concerns, especially around breathlessness using non-
 18 
 
pharmacological and education interventions. Heffner et al. surveyed patients (n=105) 
entering PR about the addition of advance care planning within the programme education, 
and found nearly 90% desired more information about advance directives and nearly 70% 
wished to discuss life-sustaining treatments more explicitly with their clinical team.131  The 
broader integration of palliative care into PR, could be one approach to introduce palliative 
care early on in illness,132 and warrants further study. 
However, PR’s reach is limited by poor uptake, variable service availability and non-
completion, typically due to illness and co-morbidities. Epidemiological studies suggest that 
only a proportion of eligible patients receive and/or complete pulmonary rehabilitation; less 
than 50% of those referred in a recent snapshot audit of PR services in England and 
Wales.133 Physically frail patients are less likely to complete PR.134 The breathlessness 
services described above, and/or less intensive exercise modalities e.g. neuromuscular 
electrical stimulation135,136 may serve as alternative interventions for those unable to 
complete PR, or when effects of PR wane.137  Further research is warranted to explore how 
palliative care might integrate with PR. 
CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS 
People with advanced COPD experience complex often severe physical and psychological 
symptoms, fluctuating trajectories, significant illness burden for them and their families and 
multimorbidity. Palliative care is an approach that focuses on the whole person, with 
impeccable assessment and management of symptoms and concerns, supporting the person 
and those close to them. Modern approaches to palliative care, which are need rather than 
prognosis based, are especially suited to care for people with COPD, where prognostication 
is uncertain. There is emerging evidence for non-pharmacological and pharmacological 
treatments to aid the management of symptoms such as refractory breathlessness, 
depression, fatigue. Alongside and often after known effective treatments such as 
pulmonary rehabilitation, palliative care services can be integrated early in the course of 
illness using short-term models, and these can improve patient outcomes. However, 
unfortunately, few people with advanced stages of COPD receive any form of palliative care.    
The findings of our review suggest that both health care professionals and policy makers 
should pay particular attention to improving access to palliative care for patients with COPD 
 19 
 
and their families. This includes better training and support in the detection and 
management of symptoms and in communication skills. Such an approach may also focus on 
gaining a better understanding of preferences, and investing in services to enable more 
people to die in their preferred place of death, and ensure quality palliative care is available 
in locations (such as hospitals) where large proportions of this population die. Integrating 
palliative care earlier in the disease trajectory may be one route to achieve this. Investment 
into demonstration projects at the population level should be boosted.  
Finally though, our review also identifies multiple gaps in the evidence, especially in 
therapies to alleviate symptoms such as breathlessness, and to support patients and 
families. There is a lack of evidence about the cost-effectiveness and safety of non-
pharmacological and pharmacological therapies, which needs to be addressed through 
randomised trials and population-based cohort studies. Investment in research to discover 
and test better ways to manage the problems encountered in advanced COPD, such as 
symptoms, meeting preferences and supporting patients and families is urgent.
