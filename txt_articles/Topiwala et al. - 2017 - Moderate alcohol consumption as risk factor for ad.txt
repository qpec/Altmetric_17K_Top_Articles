Abstract
Objectives To investigate whether moderate alcohol consumption has
a favourable or adverse association or no association with brain structure
and function.
Design Observational cohort study with weekly alcohol intake and
cognitive performance measured repeatedly over 30 years (1985-2015).
Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at study
endpoint (2012-15).
Setting Community dwelling adults enrolled in the Whitehall II cohort
based in the UK (the Whitehall II imaging substudy).
Participants 550 men and women with mean age 43.0 (SD 5.4) at study
baseline, none were “alcohol dependent” according to the CAGE
screening questionnaire, and all safe to undergo MRI of the brain at
follow-up. Twenty three were excluded because of incomplete or poor
quality imaging data or gross structural abnormality (such as a brain
cyst) or incomplete alcohol use, sociodemographic, health, or cognitive
data.
Main outcome measures Structural brain measures included
hippocampal atrophy, grey matter density, and white matter
microstructure. Functional measures included cognitive decline over the
study and cross sectional cognitive performance at the time of scanning.
Results Higher alcohol consumption over the 30 year follow-up was
associated with increased odds of hippocampal atrophy in a dose
dependent fashion. While those consuming over 30 units a week were
at the highest risk compared with abstainers (odds ratio 5.8, 95%
confidence interval 1.8 to 18.6; P≤0.001), even those drinking moderately
(14-21 units/week) had three times the odds of right sided hippocampal
atrophy (3.4, 1.4 to 8.1; P=0.007). There was no protective effect of light
drinking (1-<7 units/week) over abstinence. Higher alcohol use was also
associated with differences in corpus callosum microstructure and faster
decline in lexical fluency. No association was found with cross sectional
cognitive performance or longitudinal changes in semantic fluency or
word recall.
Conclusions Alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, is
associated with adverse brain outcomes including hippocampal atrophy.
These results support the recent reduction in alcohol guidance in the
UK and question the current limits recommended in the US.
Introduction
Alcohol use is widespread and increasing across the developed
world.1-3 It has historically been viewed as harmless in
moderation,4 defined variably from 9-18 units (72-144 g) a
week.5 6 Recent evidence of associations with risk of cancer7
has prompted revision of UK government alcohol guidance,
though US Federal Dietary guidelines (2015-20) allow up to
24.5 units a week for men.8 Even light drinking (midpoint
<12.5g daily/8 units a week) has been associated with increased
risk of oropharnygeal, oesophageal, and breast cancer.7 9 While
chronic dependent drinking is associated with Korsakoff

 syndrome and alcoholic dementia,10 the long term effects of
non-dependent alcohol consumption on the brain are poorly
understood. Robust evidence of adverse associations would
have vital implications for public health.
Some authors have suggested an inverted U shaped relation
between alcohol use and brain outcomes, similar to that seen
with cardiovascular disease. Light-to-moderate drinking has
been associated with a lower risk of dementia11 12 and a reduced
incidence of myocardial infarction13 and stroke.14 Brain imaging
studies, however, have thus far failed to provide a convincing
neural correlate that could underpin any protective effect.
Results of research into the effects of moderate alcohol on the
brain are inconsistent.15 Moderate alcohol consumption in older
people has been associated with reduced total brain volume,16
increased ventricle size,17 grey matter atrophy,18 and reduced
density of frontal and parietal grey matter,19 20 but others have
not found such associations15 or only at higher consumptions.21
Associations between moderate alcohol consumption and white
matter findings are also inconsistent. De Bruin and colleagues
reported increased white matter volume in moderate drinkers
compared with abstainers,22 whereas Anstey and colleagues
found the inverse relation.23 Similarly, whereas increased white
matter hyperintensities have been described in moderate drinkers
compared with abstainers,24 others found no association.17-25
Unresolved questions persist because of design limits to existing
studies of non-dependent drinking and brain imaging. Alcohol
consumption cannot be randomised over long periods. Most
studies to date have been cross sectional or with limited
prospectively gathered data on alcohol. People typically
underestimate their alcohol intake,26 a problem likely to be worse
in a retrospective study. Studies have also included elderly
people, in whom sub-threshold presymptomatic cognitive
impairment might already have an impact on drinking patterns.
We used data on alcohol consumption gathered prospectively
over 30 years to investigate associations with brain structural
and functional outcomes in 550 non-alcohol dependent
participants. Our hypotheses were twofold: light drinking (<7
units weekly) is protective against adverse brain outcomes and
cognitive decline and heavier drinking (above recommended
guidelines) is associated with adverse brain and cognitive
outcomes.
Methods
Study design and participants
Five hundred and fifty people were randomly selected for the
current Whitehall II imaging substudy (2012-15) from the
Whitehall II cohort study.27 The Whitehall II study was
established in 1985 at University College London, with the aim
of investigating the relation between socioeconomic status,
stress, and cardiovascular health. It recruited 10 308
non-industrial civil servants across a range of employment
grades. Sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle variables
(including alcohol use) were measured over a follow-up period
of about 30 years, at about five year intervals (phase 1: 1985-88,
phase 3: 1991-93, phase 5: 1997-99, phase 7: 2003-04, phase
9: 2007-09, phase 11: 2011-12). To make the sample as
representative as possible of the cohort at baseline, we drew a
random list of 1380 participants from those who took part in
the Whitehall II phase 11 clinical examination or phase 10 pilot
examination and had consented. Participants were sampled from
high, intermediate, and low socioeconomic groups.
Alcohol variables collected in each phase included units drunk
a week, frequency of drinking a week over the previous year,
and results of the CAGE screening questionnaire.28 We used
weekly consumption in this analysis as there is less likelihood
of a ceiling effect in comparison with drinking frequency. We
calculated average alcohol use across the study as mean
consumption a week averaged across all study phases.
Participants were deemed “abstinent” if they consumed less
than 1 unit of alcohol a week. “Light” drinking was defined as
between 1 and <7 units a week and “moderate” drinking as 7
to <14 units a week for women and 7 to <21 units for men,
based on use in the existing literature and government guidelines
(fig 1⇓). “Unsafe drinking” was defined according to pre-2016
(21 units (168 g) a week for men and 14 units (112 g) for
women) and newly revised UK Department of Health guidelines
(>14 units (112 g) for men and women) and further categorised
(14-20, 21-30, >30 units weekly) for the purposes of the logistic
regression analysis.29 Non-dependent drinkers were defined as
those scoring <2 on the CAGE questionnaire.
Age, sex, education, smoking, social activity—such as
attendance at clubs and visits with family/friends, physical
activity, voluntary work—and component measures of the
Framingham stroke risk score—such as blood pressure, smoking,
history of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular drugs—were
assessed by self report questionnaire. Social class was
determined according to occupation at phase 3 (highest class=1,
lowest=4). Drugs (number of psychotropic drugs reported as
taken) and lifetime history of major depressive disorder
(assessed by structured clinical interview for DSM IV) were
assessed at the time of the scan. Information about personality
traits was determined by questionnaire at phase 1 and included
trait impulsivity (question: “Are you hot-headed?”).
Cognitive function was assessed longitudinally at phases 3, 5,
7, 9, and 11 and at the time of scanning with lexical (how many
words beginning with a specific letter can be generated in one
minute) and semantic (how many words in a specific category
can be named in one minute) fluency tests. Short term memory
recall (20 words) was tested at phases 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Cross
sectional cognitive performance was measured at the time of
the scan with the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA,
education adjusted), trail making test (TMT-A and B),
Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (RCF) test (copy, immediate,
delay, recognition), Hopkins verbal learning test (HVLT-R;
immediate, delay), Boston naming test (BNT), and digit span
and digit substitution test (DSST). Full scale IQ (FSIQ) was
estimated at the time of the scan with the test of premorbid
functioning-UK version (TOPF-UK), with adjustment for sex
and education.
Participants were included in the imaging substudy if they were
safe to undergo MRI and able to give informed consent.
Exclusions were due to incomplete or poor quality imaging data
or gross structural abnormality (such as a brain cyst), incomplete
data on alcohol use (>2 study phases data missing), and missing
sociodemographic, health, or cognitive data (fig 2⇓).
MRI analysis
All MRI scans were acquired at the functional magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain (FMRIB) centre, University of
Oxford, with a 3 Tesla Siemens Verio scanner (2012-15). We
used T1-weighted and diffusion tensor (DTI) 3T MRI sequences
for these analyses.30
Full technical details are in the appendix. In brief, we initially
examined associations between alcohol use and grey matter
using voxel based morphometry, an objective method to
compare grey matter density between individuals in each voxel
(smallest distinguishable image volume) of the structural image.

 For each participant for subsequent analyses we additionally
extracted hippocampal volumes (adjusted for total intracranial
volume) using an automated segmentation/registration tool.
Automated segmentation of the amygdala was less reliable in
this sample so we did not use extracted volumes in this analysis.
Three clinicians independently defined hippocampal atrophy
according to visual rating (Scheltens score31) and reached a
consensus.
Diffusion tensor images indicate the directional preference of
water diffusion in neural tissue and allow inferences about the
structural integrity of white matter tracts. In healthy myelinated
fibres diffusion is restricted perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis of the fibre—that is, it is anisotropic. We carried out
voxel-wise statistical analysis of diffusion tensor data (fractional
anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD),
and mean diffusivity (MD)) using tract based spatial statistics
(TBSS).32
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were continuous measures of grey matter
density in the voxel based morphometry analysis and white
matter integrity in the tract based spatial statistics analysis
(fractional anisotropy, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity).
Visual ratings of hippocampal atrophy were dichotomised into
atrophy versus no atrophy based on 0/1 on the (4 point)
Scheltens scale to reflect clinical use (“abnormal” versus
“normal”).31 Hippocampal volume (%intracranial volume) was
used as a continuous variable in a multiple linear regression
analysis.
As cognitive outcomes we used decline in short term memory,
semantic and lexical fluency, and cross sectional performance
on Montreal cognitive assessment, trail making test,
Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, Hopkins verbal learning
test, Boston naming test, digit span, and digit substitution test.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were done with R,33 unless otherwise stated. To
assess representativeness of included participants we examined
differences between included and excluded participants using
t tests of means (continuous variables) or χ2 tests of
independence (categorical variables). According to variable
type, we used means (standard deviations), medians
(interquartile ranges), or numbers (percentages) to summarise
sociodemographic and clinical measures for included
participants who were split by safe versus unsafe average alcohol
use averaged over all phases, on the basis of UK contemporary
(pre-2016) guidelines. Significant differences between safe and
unsafe drinkers in continuous variables were tested with t tests
of means (normally distributed) or Wilcoxon rank sum tests
(non-normally distributed), and in binary categorical variables
(and mini-mental state examination, Montreal cognitive
assessment, and Framingham stroke risk score, which have
lower and upper bounds) with Fisher’s exact test of proportions.
In view of small group numbers (<5) for social class, we
performed a simulation test to estimate group differences.34
Weekly consumption of alcohol (units and grams) was described
with means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile
ranges.
We examined alcohol trends over time using mixed effects
modelling, with time from study baseline (phase 1) as the
independent variable and alcohol consumption (units/week) as
the dependent variable. This method accounts for missing data
and correlation of repeated measures (in this case alcohol use).
We calculated intercepts (baseline consumption) and slopes
(trends over study) for each participant. The ability of other
variables to predict longitudinal trends of alcohol consumption
was tested by inclusion of the following in the mixed effects
model: age, sex, education, premorbid IQ, social class,
Framingham risk score (a composite measure including smoking,
cardiovascular disease or diabetes, cardiovascular drugs),
exercise frequency, club attendance, voluntary work, visits with
friends and family, lifetime history of major depressive disorder
on the structured clinical interview for DSM IV (SCID)
(yes-2/no-1), and current psychotropic drugs (yes-2/no-1).
We included mean alcohol consumption (units/week) across all
study phases as an independent variable in voxel based
morphometry (grey matter density as dependent variable) and
tract based spatial statistics analyses (FA/MD/RD/AD as
dependent variable). Voxel-wise, we applied a generalised linear
model (GLM) using permutation based non-parametric testing
(randomise),35 correcting for multiple comparisons across space
(threshold-free cluster enhancement, TFCE).
We used two post hoc tests to confirm the associations between
alcohol consumption and hippocampal size after the voxel based
morphometry analysis. Firstly, we used logistic regression to
calculate odds ratios for left and right hippocampal atrophy
versus no atrophy (visual atrophy ratings based on a cut off of
0/1 on the Scheltens scale),31 given average alcohol consumption
across study phases. The latter was categorised as abstinent (<1
unit, reference group), 1 to <7 units, 14 to <21 units, 21 to <30
units, and >30 units a week. Secondly, we performed multiple
linear regression with hippocampal volume (extracted from
FIRST (an automated segmentation/registration tool), adjusted
for intracranial volume and transformed by squaring to normalise
the residuals) as the dependent variable and alcohol consumption
as an independent variable.
In all analyses with a brain measure as the dependent variable,
we included the following potential confounding variables
(identified from knowledge of the literature) as independent
variables: age, sex, premorbid IQ, education, social class,
Framingham risk score, current psychotropic drugs (number),
lifetime history of major depressive disorder (structured clinical
interview: yes-2/no-1), exercise frequency, club attendance,
voluntary work, and visits with friends and family. In the subset
with data on personality traits (n=179), analyses were
additionally adjusted for impulsiveness.
We used mixed effects models to model longitudinal cognitive
data. For count data (word recall from list of 20: “memory”)
we used a binomial regression and for lexical and semantic
fluency (performed within a certain time) we used Poisson
regression. The following fixed effects were included: time from
study baseline, average alcohol consumption across the study
(abstinent (reference group, <1 unit weekly), 1- <7, 7- <14, 14-
<21, >21), age, sex, education, social class, premorbid IQ, and
Framingham stroke risk score. To test whether cognitive decline
significantly differed between abstainers and those with higher
alcohol intakes, we added interaction terms between time and
alcohol category. Contrasts between other categories of drinking
were also checked to test for significant differences in cognitive
decline—for example, those drinking 1-<7 versus >21 units.
We used Wald tests,36 37 estimating the overall effect of all
interactions between alcohol and time on the models, to test the
null hypothesis that rates of cognitive decline did not differ
between alcohol categories. Learning effects have been well
demonstrated when the same cognitive test is presented more
than once to a participant, which in our study could obscure
true cognitive decline. In an attempt to control for this we added
a dummy variable to code for the first time the test was taken
(First). We also dummy coded for the test being performed at

 Oxford (Oxford), as there was an atypically short time interval
between phase 11 and the last measurement point, which we
hypothesised could result in an increased learning effect. We
included interaction terms for FSIQ*First and FSIQ*Oxford to
check if learning effects differ with premorbid IQ. Participant
identification was included as a random effect. Usual diagnostic
checks were performed on the models. The resulting coefficients
from binomial regression equate to log(odds) and from Poisson
regression to log(Poisson mean count). Exponentiated estimates
are reported in the appendix. Regression coefficients were
converted into interpretable differences in lexical decline per
year compared with abstainers by: 100*(1−(exp (estimates)).
Models were visually presented with graphs to predict trends
in cognitive test scores over the study for a “typical” participant:
male, mean age 70, 15 years’ education, social class I, IQ 118,
and Framingham stroke risk score 10%.
We fitted regression models to check whether average alcohol
consumption over the study (independent variable) predicted
cross sectional performance on a range of memory tests
(dependent variable) performed at the study end point. Age,
sex, education, and premorbid IQ were included as covariates.
When the test score represented a continuous variable, we used
multiple linear regression. For count data (such as digit coding),
we initially fitted Poisson regression and checked for
over-dispersion. If this was found, we used a negative binomial
model. For the remainder of the tests, where the upper score is
bounded, we initially fitted regression models using binomial
distributions. If over-dispersion was in evidence we performed
a folded transformation and checked for approximate normality
using Q-Q plots of residuals. The same models were re-fitted
with and without alcohol consumption, and a hypothesis test
(likelihood ratio) was performed. Calculated P values were used
to test whether alcohol made a significant difference to the
model.
Structural equation modelling (SEM; Amos 24 for Windows)
was used post hoc for hypothesis testing and to generate fit
statistics for models of relations between alcohol use, brain
measures, and cognitive decline. This modelling allows
simultaneous analysis of multiple variables in one model, and
time series with auto-correlated errors. The hypothesised
underlying structure of the model was constructed following
the voxel based morphometry, tract based spatial statistics, and
mixed effects analyses, with average alcohol consumption as
an exogenous variable, hippocampal volume, corpus callosum
mean diffusivity (generally the most sensitive measure of loss
of white matter integrity), and decline in lexical fluency (slopes
from mixed effects model) included as endogenous variables
(with latent variables to account for measurement error). We
modelled covariance of alcohol with sex and IQ and between
brain measures. The model was improved by iteratively
eliminating paths with P>0.1 and monitoring of the successive
improvement of the model fits statistics (χ2, comparative fit
index, root mean square error of approximation, and the
Tucker-Lewis index) until we identified the most parsimonious
model.
In all analyses, results were judged significant if the adjusted P
value was <0.05. Bootstrapping was performed to derive 95%
confidence intervals for estimates.
Patient involvement
Participants were from the Whitehall II cohort. No patients were
involved in setting the research question or the outcome
measures, nor were they involved in the design, recruitment, or
conduct of the study. No patients were asked to advise on
interpretation or writing up of results. Results were disseminated
to the study participants in abstract format and as presentations
at the 30th anniversary day for the Whitehall II cohort.
Results
Participants/descriptive data
Sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle data are reported for
the 527 included participants, separated into alcohol
consumption groups (table 1⇓). Twenty three participants were
excluded from the voxel based morphometry and visual ratings
analyses on the basis of structural brain abnormalities, poor
quality images, or missing confounder data (fig 2⇓). A further
16 were excluded from the tract based spatial statistics analysis
because of missing or poor quality diffusion tensor images.
Excluded participants did not significantly differ from those
included on any of the reported characteristics (data available
on request). There was a higher proportion of men, and
participants were slightly less educated, with higher blood
pressure and lower measures of depressive symptoms compared
with the larger Whitehall II cohort (see appendix table A). Mean
age was 43.0 (SD 5.4) at the start of the study (appendix table
B). Unsafe drinkers differed from safe drinkers by having a
higher premorbid IQ, a higher percentage of men and smokers,
and higher Framingham risk scores (table 1⇓).
Median alcohol consumption across study phases (fig 3⇓ and
appendix table B) was 11.5 units (85.8 g) a week (interquartile
range 6.2-18.8 units (51.7-154.3 g)) for men and 6.4 units (51.4
g) a week (2.8-11.9 units (22.7-103.6 g)) for women. Weekly
alcohol intake did not significantly increase over the phases of
the study for the group as a whole (change in weekly alcohol
units per 10 years of follow-up 0.15, 95% confidence interval
−0.21 to 0.51; P=0.4), but trends over time correlated with
baseline intake (intercepts and slopes correlated negatively (r=
−0.43, 95% confidence interval −0.50 to −0.36)—that is, those
drinking more at baseline tended to lower their consumption
more over the course of the study, a finding consistent with
regression to the mean. Male sex (difference in weekly alcohol
units compared with women 4.89, 2.54 to 7.19; P<0.001) and
higher premorbid IQ (change in weekly alcohol units for every
1 IQ point 0.18, 0.06 to 0.30; P=0.004) predicted higher baseline
consumption but not changes in consumption with time. Other
sociodemographic and clinical factors were not related to
consumption. Average alcohol use over the study was over “safe
limits” in 13.6% women and 20.0% men, as judged by pre-2016
UK guidelines (>21 units (168 g)/week for men, >14 units (112
g)/week for women), and 40.3% as judged by the 2016 revised
UK guidelines (>14 units (112 g)/week for men and women)
(see appendix for consumption data for single phases). Scores
on the CAGE questionnaire were below the sensitive screening
cut off of 228 for all participants at all Whitehall II phases
(appendix table C).
Alcohol and brain structure
Higher alcohol use was associated with reduced grey matter
density, hippocampal atrophy, and reduced white matter
microstructural integrity.
Grey matter
Average alcohol consumption over the study (units/week) was
negatively correlated with grey matter density in the voxel based
morphometry analyses, especially in hippocampi (fig 4⇓), even
after adjustment for multiple potential confounders. Associations

 also extended anteriorly into the amygdalae. Frontal regions
were unaffected.
Compared with abstinence, higher alcohol consumption was
also associated with increased odds of abnormally rated
hippocampal atrophy (defined as score >0 on Scheltens visual
rating scale; table 2⇓). This was a dose dependent effect. The
highest odds were in those drinking in excess of 30 units a week
(odds ratio 5.8, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 18.6; P≤0.001),
but odds of atrophy were higher compared with abstinence even
in those drinking at moderate levels of 7-<14 units a week (3.4,
1.4 to 8.1; P=0.007). There was no protective effect (that is,
reduced odds of atrophy) with light drinking (1-<7 units a week)
over abstinence. Findings were similar in subanalyses of men
alone but not in the smaller subgroup of women. The risk of
right sided hippocampal atrophy was significantly greater at
>14 alcohol units a week compared with abstinence, but for left
sided atrophy at only >30 units a week.
Mean hippocampal volumes (raw and adjusted for intracranial
volume) were within the range cited in the literature (appendix
table D)38-40 and correlated with visual ratings of hippocampal
atrophy (Spearman’s r=−0.4; P<0.001). Consistent with voxel
based morphometry and visual ratings findings, alcohol
consumption independently predicted FIRST-extracted
hippocampal volume (%ICV) (table 3⇓). Exclusion of the three
individual highest drinkers (>60 units weekly) did not
substantially change the results (appendix table E). In the subset
of participants for whom personality trait data were available
from phase 1 (n=179), additionally adjustment for the analysis
for trait impulsivity did not alter the findings.
White matter
Higher average alcohol consumption across the study was
inversely associated with white matter integrity (fig 5⇓),
reflected by lower corpus callosum fractional anisotropy and
higher radial, axial and mean diffusivity. These associations
were focused on the anterior corpus callosum (genu and anterior
body, fig 5⇓).
Alcohol and cognitive function
Higher alcohol consumption over the study predicted faster
decline on lexical fluency but not semantic fluency or word
recall (fig 6⇓). Those drinking 7-<14, 14-<21, and >21 units a
week declined faster in terms of lexical scores than abstainers.
This effect was independent of age, sex, premorbid IQ,
education, social class, and Framingham stroke risk score.The
size of the difference can be interpreted as follows: people
drinking 7-<14 units experienced a 0.5% greater reduction from
their baseline in lexical fluency per year (14% over 30 years),
those drinking 14-<21 units 0.8% greater per year (17% over
30 years), and those drinking >21 units 0.6% per year (16%
over 30 years) than abstainers (appendix table F). Though the
three categories of higher consumption (7-<14, 14-<21, and
>21 units/week) showed significantly greater decline than
abstainers, the only significant difference in trends between
these three groups was between those drinking 14-21 units and
those drinking 7-14 units (14-21 units experience 0.3% faster
decline per year; P=0.02). There was no evidence to support
light drinkers being relatively protected from cognitive decline
compared with abstainers. Overall results of tests examining
the question of whether rates of cognitive decline are linked to
alcohol were significant (after multiple comparisons correction)
for lexical fluency (χ2=14.4; P=0.006) but not semantic fluency
(χ2=10.0; P=0.04) or memory recall (χ2=9.8; P=0.04).
We found evidence of learning effects on lexical and categorical
fluency tests (P≤0.01), such that the second time a participant
was presented with a test they performed better. This learning
effect was predicted by premorbid IQ (First*premorbid IQ
P=0.002-0.02).
There was a trend towards higher baseline performance on
lexical fluency and memory recall in those drinking compared
with abstainers (appendix table F), but these findings did not
reach significance after correction for multiple testing.
We did not find any significant relations between alcohol
consumption and cross sectional performance on cognitive tests
performed at the time of scanning (a summary of cognitive test
performance and its relation to alcohol is given in appendix
table H).
Modelling alcohol consumption and brain
structure and function
To see how alcohol consumption and the associated brain
regions interacted with cognitive decline, we used structural
equation modelling. Hippocampal volume and corpus callosum
mean diffusivity were included as exogenous variables. Age,
sex, and premorbid FSIQ were also incorporated.
Removal of regression arrows from age, sex, premorbid IQ, and
hippocampal volume to lexical fluency decline improved the
model fit. Alcohol consumption independently predicted decline
in lexical fluency. The final parsimonious model explained 21%
of corpus callosum mean diffusivity, 14% of right hippocampal
volume, and 2% of lexical fluency decline variance (fig 7⇓,
table 4⇓), with good model fit. Alcohol consumption (in addition
to age) predicted smaller hippocampal volume and greater
corpus callosum mean diffusivity. Through its relation with
corpus callosum mean diffusivity, and through a direct path,
increased alcohol consumption predicted faster decline of lexical
fluency.
Discussion
Principal findings
We have found a previously uncharacterised dose dependent
association between alcohol consumption over 30 years of
follow-up and hippocampal atrophy, as well as impaired white
matter microstructure. Additionally, higher alcohol consumption
predicted greater decline in lexical fluency but not in semantic
fluency or word recall. There was no evidence of a protective
effect of light drinking over abstinence on brain structure or
function. The hippocampal findings were consistent between
the brain-wide voxel based approach, automatically extracted
volumes, and clinical visual ratings of hippocampal atrophy.
The relation was dose dependent, and increased odds of
hippocampal atrophy were found even in moderate drinkers
(14-<21 units/week in men). The association between alcohol
consumption and white matter microstructure in non-dependent
drinkers is also novel and seemed to be driven by greater radial
relative to axial diffusivity.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study are the 30 year longitudinal data on
alcohol consumption and the detailed available data on
confounders. Additional strengths include the availability of a
large amount of MRI data and the advanced methods of imaging
analysis. Grey matter findings were replicated with a voxel
based approach, automated hippocampal volumes, and visual
ratings. Visual atrophy ratings are known to correlate closely
with automated methods (own data) and are more applicable to

 clinical settings.41 In large neuroimaging studies, automatic
segmentation is widespread.42 43 The automated approach we
use (FIRST) has been shown to give accurate and robust
results.44
When interpreting these results, some caveats are necessary.
While the sample comprised people living in the community,
it might not be representative of the wider UK population. Most
participants were educated and middle class men. The
hippocampal atrophy associations we found in the total sample
were replicated in men alone but not in women. This could
reflect a lower power to detect an effect in women, in part
because the sample was dominated by men (a reflection of the
sex disparity in the civil service in the 1980s) and in part because
few of the included women drank heavily. This is an
observational study as long term alcohol use cannot be
randomised. The Rosenthal effect could have influenced
participants to lead healthier lifestyles as they were enrolled in
the Whitehall II “stress and health” study. Data on alcohol use
were self reported, and participants could have underestimated
their drinking, though the longitudinal rather than cross sectional
approach often taken in other reported studies might minimise
this,27 and the percentage of people drinking “unsafely” was
comparable with that reported elsewhere.45-47 We used the CAGE
screening instrument to identify alcohol dependence as it is well
validated.28 48 There were 75 (14.2%) individuals with missing
CAGE data from at least one phase, and we cannot exclude the
possibility that we have included some people who were alcohol
dependent at points during the study period. All included
individuals, however, had at least three (out of a total of five)
CAGE measurements, and individuals with incomplete CAGE
data on average drank significantly less than those with complete
data (on a t test of means of 13.1 (SD 10.3) v 8.5 (SD 8.8)
(P<0.001). Additionally, some participants reported drinking
high levels of alcohol while screening negative on the CAGE,
indicating a further possible inclusion of people with an alcohol
use disorder in the sample. Increased odds of hippocampal
atrophy and faster lexical fluency decline, however, were found
even in those drinking moderate amounts. Although the alcohol
and cognitive data were longitudinal, the analyses with MRI
measures were cross sectional, raising the possibility that the
associations between brain structure and alcohol were the result
of a confounding variable. Longitudinal imaging over more
than a couple of years adds further confounders as the physical
scanner and imaging sequences are unlikely to be the same
because of developments in MRI science, making results
difficult to interpret. While efforts have been made to control
for multiple potential sources of confounding, residual
confounding from unmeasured sources is conceivable. To
produce the adjusted associations we found, however, any
uncontrolled confounders would need to be associated with both
alcohol consumption and risk of brain abnormalities and
unrelated to the multiple factors we controlled for. We cannot
exclude the possibility, of unlikely face validity, that those with
hippocampal atrophy at study baseline were more likely to drink
more. Multiple testing and the possibility of a false positive is
a concern when cognitive decline on three tests is performed.
The small P values (range 0.015-0.004) for lexical decline
according to differing alcohol consumption, which reach
significance with a strict Bonferroni correction (that is, a reduced
significance threshold of P<0.017), however, make this unlikely.
In contrast, we cannot be as confident about the differences in
baseline cognition for drinkers compared with abstainers
(P=0.03).
Finally, we fitted a structural equation model for alcohol, brain,
and cognitive data that was defined post hoc. As such, results
of previous analyses affected the choice of included variables
meaning that the fit of the model might be overoptimistic.
Comparison with other studies
On average, 20% of men and 14% of women were drinking
above pre-2016 UK guidelines (>21 units/>14 units/week,
respectively). Other studies vary in reported rates of heavy
drinking, but our rates are comparable.45 46 Alcohol consumption
might vary with country, as highlighted by a study using the
WHO global alcohol database.47
Hippocampal atrophy is a sensitive and relatively specific
marker of Alzheimer’s disease,49 though it has also been reported
in chronic alcoholics.19 50 The brain regions most vulnerable to
alcohol abuse are said to be the frontal lobes.21 In our sample,
higher but non-dependent alcohol use was not associated with
subsequent frontal brain atrophy or impaired cognition. Only
the study by Den Heijer and colleagues has reported
hippocampal findings in non-dependent drinkers.51 This used a
manual tracing rather than voxel based or visual rating approach
to estimate hippocampal size. They reported a protective effect
of moderate alcohol intake compared with abstinence, which
conflicts with our results.19 Alcohol consumption, however, was
determined cross sectionally, making it difficult to exclude
reverse causation. In contrast, because of the longitudinal
cognitive component of our study we could show an association
between higher alcohol consumption and cognitive decline.
Additionally, several known confounders of hippocampal size,
such as depression, were not controlled for in the Den Heijer
study.51 Other studies in non-dependent drinkers have reported
either no effect52 53 or a negative correlation with global grey
matter but not hippocampal atrophy.17 18 In contrast with our
first hypothesis and the findings of some other studies,11-54 we
observed no evidence of a protective effect of light drinking
compared with abstinence on brain structure or cognitive
function. Previous studies did not control for (premorbid) IQ,11 12
and only a few for socioeconomic class.55-57 The observed
protective effect could be due to confounding as we and others
found a positive association between alcohol intake and IQ.58
These factors separately predict better performance on cognitive
tests. Supporting our second hypothesis, we found heavier
alcohol consumption to be associated with adverse brain
outcomes. The biological mechanism for this is unclear. Ethanol
and acetaldehyde (a metabolite) are neurotoxic59 and cause
reduced numbers60 61 and morphological changes in hippocampal
neurones in animal models.62 Associated thiamine and folate
deficiency,63 repeated head trauma, cerebrovascular events, liver
damage, and repeated intoxication and withdrawal have also
been implicated in more severe drinkers. The risk of
hippocampal atrophy might be stronger and at lower levels of
alcohol consumption for the right side. More severe hippocampal
atrophy on the right has been described in those at higher risk
of Alzheimer’s disease (asymptomatic ApoE4 homozygotes),64
as well as in those with mild cognitive impairment or
Alzheimer’s disease.65 We found no structural laterality in
associations with cognitive function. The literature on this is
scarce and conflicting. Stronger associations between right
hippocampal volume and visuospatial memory have been
reported.66
The voxel based morphometry analysis also showed associations
between increased alcohol consumption and reduced grey matter
density in the amygdala. This result could not be confirmed
with other methods as automated segmentation of these regions
was unreliable, and we are unaware of any reliable visual
atrophy rating scales. Amygdala atrophy has been described in
those with Alzheimer’s disease67 and is implicated in preclinical

 models of alcohol misuse,68 alcohol abuse relapse,69 and in
abstinent alcoholics,70 though others have found no association
with lower levels of consumption.53
In animals, radial diffusivity reflects differences in
myelination.71 72 Previous studies have highlighted the corpus
callosum as an area affected in fetal alcohol syndrome73 and in
chronic alcoholism in Marchiafava-Bignami disease.74 75 One
study reported increased mean diffusivity in the amygdala in a
post hoc analysis of female non-dependent drinkers.25 We are
not aware of any studies investigating microstructural changes
in white matter in moderate drinkers using a data driven
skeletonised tract approach to diffusion tensor images, such as
tract based spatial statistics. Alternative voxel-wise methods
could compromise optimal analysis of multiple participants as
there are alignment problems causing potential difficulties with
interpretation of voxel-wise statistics.32
Participants drinking higher levels of alcohol over the study
experienced a faster decline of lexical fluency compared with
abstainers. Lexical fluency involves selecting and retrieving
information based on spelling (orthography) and has
characteristically been associated with frontal executive
function,76 in contrast with semantic fluency, which could
depend more on temporal lobe integrity.77 The distinction might
not be as clear cut, however, as functional networks overlap.78
The inverse relation between alcohol consumption and lexical
decline was perhaps unsurprising given the frontal predominance
of the negative associations with white matter integrity. We
suggest two possibilities for the lack of more widespread
associations with cognition, particularly with semantic fluency
and short term memory decline, given the structural brain
findings (hippocampal atrophy). Firstly, there are clear practice
effects over the study—that is, at least some participants improve
their performance after repeated testing, and this is positively
associated with premorbid IQ. This might be greater for the
semantic compared with lexical fluency tests. Variables
predicting the ability to learn could be different from those
protecting against cognitive impairment because of a
neurodegenerative process. Though we attempted to control for
both IQ and learning effects, this might be insufficient to remove
the confounding effect if a third variable, such as diet, mediates
the relation between IQ and learning but is not in the model.
Secondly, the brain changes might reflect an intermediate
phenotype, and cognitive change is not yet evident. It is now
well documented that hippocampal atrophy precedes symptoms
in those with Alzheimer’s dementia by several years,79 so a
similar phenomenon in alcohol related changes is plausible.
Conclusions and policy implications
Prospective studies of the effects of alcohol use on the brain are
few, and replication of these findings in other populations will
be important. Alcohol consumption for individuals was
remarkably stable across the study phases. This sample was
therefore underpowered to detect differences in those
considerably changing their intake from others who drink
consistently. Investigations with larger numbers are needed to
clarify whether there are graded risks between short versus long
periods of higher alcohol consumption.
The finding that alcohol consumption in moderate quantities is
associated with multiple markers of abnormal brain structure
and cognitive function has important potential public health
implications for a large sector of the population. For example,
in our sample nearly half of the men and a quarter of the women
were currently drinking in this range. Additionally, drinking
habits were remarkably stable over a 30 year period, suggesting
that risky drinking habits might be embarked on in midlife.
Recommended guidelines for drinking remained unchanged in
the UK from 1987 until 2016. Our findings support the recent
reduction in UK safe limits and call into question the current
US guidelines, which suggest that up to 24.5 units a week is
safe for men, as we found increased odds of hippocampal
atrophy at just 14-21 units a week, and we found no support for
a protective effect of light consumption on brain structure.
Alcohol might represent a modifiable risk factor for cognitive
impairment, and primary prevention interventions targeted to
later life could be too late.

 What is already known on this topic
Heavy drinking is associated with Korsakoff’s syndrome, dementia, and widespread brain atrophy
While smaller amounts of alcohol have been linked to protection against cognitive impairment, few studies have examined the effects
of moderate alcohol on the brain
Previous studies have methodological limitations especially regarding the lack of prospective alcohol data, have been conflicting, and
have failed to provide a convincing neural correlate
What this study adds
Compared with abstinence, moderate alcohol intake is associated with increased risk of adverse brain outcomes and steeper cognitive
decline in lexical fluency
The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable, which has not been previously linked negatively with moderate alcohol use
No protective effect was found for small amounts of alcohol over abstinence, and previous reports claiming a protective effect of light
drinking might have been subject to confounding by associations between increased alcohol and higher social class or IQ

 Fig 4 Results of voxel based morphometry (corrected for threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)): significant negative
correlation between weekly alcohol units (average of all phases across study) and grey matter density in 527 participants.
Adjusted for age, sex, education, premorbid IQ, social class, physical exercise, club attendance, social activity, Framingham
stroke risk score, psychotropic drugs, and history of major depressive disorder

 Fig 5 Tract based spatial statistics results (corrected for threshold-free cluster enhancement, TFCE) showing negative
correlation between average alcohol across study (all phases) and fractional anisotropy, and positive correlations with radial
diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and axial diffusivity in 511 participants. Adjusted for age, sex, education, premorbid IQ, social
class, physical exercise, club attendance, social activity, Framingham stroke risk score, psychotropic drugs, and history of
major depressive disorder

 Fig 6 Predicted longitudinal change in cognitive test scores (lexical and semantic fluency, word recall “memory”) for man
of mean age (70) and premorbid IQ (118), median education (15 years), social class I and Framingham stroke risk score
(10%) according to average alcohol consumption (weekly units). Predictions made on basis of mixed effects models with
cognitive testing performed at phases 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 and time of scan

 Fig 7 Final parsimonious structural equation model illustrating relations among alcohol consumption (average across study
phases, as fraction of 100 units weekly), hippocampal volume (average, %intracranial volume), corpus callosum mean
diffusivity (as multiplicative of 1000), decline in lexical fluency (slopes), and age in 511 participants. Values on arrows
represent unit changes in dependent variable for 1 unit increase in predictor. Model explained 21% of corpus callosum
mean diffusivity, 14% of hippocampal variance, and 2% of lexical fluency decline variance (R2). Model fit: χ2=5.6, df=4,
P=0.23, root mean square error of approximation=0.03, comparative fit index=0.99, Tucker-Lewis index=0.97
