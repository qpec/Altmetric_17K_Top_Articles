ABSTRACT 
19 
DNA methylation is considered to be a relatively stable epigenetic mark. Yet, a growing body of evidence 
20 
indicates that DNA methylation levels can change rapidly, for example, in innate immune cells facing an 
21 
infectious agent. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between changes in DNA methylation and gene 
22 
expression during infection remains to be elucidated. Here, we generated time-course data on DNA 
23 
methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility patterns during infection of human dendritic 
24 
cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We found that the immune response to infection is accompanied 
25 
by active demethylation of thousands of CpG sites overlapping distal enhancer elements. However, 
26 
virtually all changes in gene expression in response to infection occur prior to detectable changes in DNA 
27 
methylation, indicating that the observed losses in methylation are a downstream consequence of 
28 
transcriptional activation. Footprinting analysis revealed that immune-related transcription factors (TF), 
29 
such as NF-κB/Rel, are recruited to enhancer elements prior to the observed losses in methylation, 
30 
suggesting that DNA demethylation is mediated by TF binding to cis-acting elements. Collectively, our 
31 
results show that DNA demethylation is not required for the establishment of the core regulatory program 
32 
engaged upon infection.

INTRODUCTION 
42 
Innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, are the first mediators recruited in 
43 
response to an invading pathogen. Upon stimulation, these cells considerably shift their transcriptional 
44 
program, activating hundreds of genes involved in immune-related processes in a rapid and highly 
45 
choreographed fashion. This is achieved through the binding of signal-dependent transcription factors 
46 
(TFs), including NF-κB/Rel, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), to gene regulatory regions of 
47 
the genome where recruitment of various co-activators is initiated [1, 2]. Alterations to the epigenome, 
48 
such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are recognized as important permissive or 
49 
suppressive factors that play an integral role in modulating access of TFs to cis-acting DNA regulatory 
50 
elements via the regulation of chromatin dynamics. Consequently, changes to the epigenetic landscape are 
51 
expected to have a significant impact on gene expression.  
52 
 
53 
Many studies have highlighted the importance of histone modifications in regulating complex gene 
54 
expression programs underlying immune responses [3, 4]. However, the exact role that DNA methylation 
55 
plays in innate immune response regulation remains ambiguous. We have previously shown that infection 
56 
of post-mitotic DCs is associated with an active loss of methylation at enhancers and that such 
57 
demethylation events are strongly predictive of changes in expression levels of nearby genes [5]. Many 
58 
other studies correlate these two processes [6-13], but it remains unclear whether altered methylation 
59 
patterns directly invoke transcriptional modulation or whether such patterns are the downstream 
60 
consequence of TF binding to regulatory regions. Thus, the causal relationship between changes in DNA 
61 
methylation and gene expression during infection remains unresolved. To address this question, we 
62 
characterized in parallel genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin 
63 
accessibility in non-infected and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-infected DCs at multiple time 
64 
points. Our results show that the loss of DNA methylation observed in response to infection is not

RESULTS 
69 
Bacterial infection induces stable DNA demethylation at enhancers of dendritic cells 
70 
To investigate the relationship between changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in response to 
71 
infection, we infected monocyte-derived DCs from 4 healthy individuals with a live virulent strain of 
72 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) for 2-, 18-, 48-, and 72-hours. At each time-point, we obtained single 
73 
base-pair resolution DNA methylation levels for over 130,000 CpG sites using a customized capture-
74 
based bisulfite sequencing panel (SeqCap Epi, see Methods), in matched non-infected 
and 
MTB-
75 
infected DCs. Our customized SeqCap Epi panel interrogates 33,059 regions highly enriched among 
76 
putative enhancer elements (58% are associated with the H3K4me1 enhancer mark [14]; Supplementary 
77 
Figure 1A), which are the main targets of methylation changes in response to infection [5]. In total, we 
78 
generated ~717 million single-end reads (mean = 17.5 million reads per sample; Supplementary Table 
79 
1), resulting in an average coverage of ~70X per CpG site (Supplementary Figure 1B). Methylation 
80 
values between samples were strongly correlated, attesting to the high quality of the data 
81 
(Supplementary Figure 1C; median r across all samples = 0.94). 
82 
 
83 
We next assessed temporal changes in methylation levels in response to infection using the DSS software 
84 
[15]. We defined differentially methylated (DM) CpG sites as those showing a significant difference of 
85 
methylation between infected and non-infected samples at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.01 and an 
86 
absolute mean methylation difference above 10%. Using these criteria, we identified 6,174 DM CpG sites 
87 
across the time course of infection. Consistent with previous findings [5], the vast majority of changes in 
88 
methylation (87%) were associated with the loss of DNA methylation in infected cells (Figure 1A,B).

To test if live bacteria were required to induce the observed changes in DNA methylation, we collected 
91 
similar data on DCs exposed to heat-killed MTB in addition to the live MTB experiments. Changes in 
92 
methylation in response to live and heat-killed MTB were strikingly correlated, particularly at later time-
93 
points post-infection (r ≥ 0.84 at 18h and above; Supplementary Figure 2). These results show that DCs 
94 
do not require exposure to a live pathogen to elicit the overall demethylation detected in response to 
95 
infection. Simply, the engagement of innate immune receptors and activation of pathways involved in 
96 
pathogen sensing and elimination is sufficient to induce methylation shifts. Hierarchical clustering 
97 
analysis of the DM sites observed when considering samples exposed to either live or heat-killed bacteria 
98 
showed that >80% of the sites exhibited a gradual loss of methylation over the time course of infection 
99 
until methylation marks were almost completely erased and that very few changes were detectable at 2 
100 
hours post-infection (DM Cluster 3; Figure 1C,D; Supplementary Table 2).  
101 
 
102 
Monocyte-derived DCs do not proliferate in response to infection [5] and, therefore, any observed losses 
103 
in methylation must occur through an active mechanism involving the ten-eleven translocation (Tet) 
104 
enzymes, a family of enzymes that converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) 
105 
[16]. Thus, we used Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-seq) data collected from non-infected DCs [5] 
106 
to assess if DM sites had significantly different levels of 5hmC as compared to non-DM sites. We found 
107 
that DM sites (Cluster 3) show high levels of 5hmC even prior to infection (Figure 1E; 3.2-fold 
108 
enrichment compared to non-DM sites; Wilcoxon test; P < 1 × 10-16), suggesting that DM sites are likely 
109 
pre-bound by TET enzymes (likely TET2 [17, 18], the most expressed Tet enzyme in DCs 
110 
(Supplementary Figure 3)) and that 5hmC may serve as a stable mark that acts to prime enhancers [19-
111 
21].

We collected RNA-seq data from matched non-infected and infected samples at each time point, for a 
115 
total of 34 RNA-seq profiles across time-treatment combinations (mean = 42.2 million reads per sample; 
116 
Supplementary Table 1). The first principal component of the resulting gene expression data accounted 
117 
for 63% of the variance in our dataset and separated infected and non-infected DCs (Supplementary 
118 
Figure 4A). We found extensive differences in gene expression levels between infected and non-infected 
119 
DCs: of the 13,956 genes analyzed, 1,987 (14%), 4,371 (31%), 4,591 (33%), and 5,189 (37%) were 
120 
differentially expressed (DE) at 2, 18, 48, and 72 hours post-infection, respectively (FDR < 0.01 and 
121 
absolute log2(fold change) > 1; Supplementary Table 3). We also collected RNA-seq data in samples 
122 
stimulated with heat-inactivated MTB and found that, similar to changes in methylation, changes in gene 
123 
expression in response to live and heat-inactivated MTB were strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.94; 
124 
Supplementary Figure 4B). We next grouped the set of DE genes across the time course (7,457 in total) 
125 
into 6 distinct temporal expression clusters (Figure 2A,B; Supplementary Table 3). These clusters cover 
126 
a variety of differential expression patterns, including genes which show increasing up-regulation over 
127 
time (DE Cluster 5: Persistent induced; n = 2,091) to genes in which the highest levels of expression 
128 
occur at 2 or 18 hours followed by a decrease towards basal levels (DE Cluster 4: Early induced (n = 
129 
765), and DE Cluster 6: Intermediate induced (n = 839), respectively) (Figure 2B). Gene ontology (GO) 
130 
enrichment analysis revealed that induced genes were strongly enriched among GO terms directly related 
131 
to immune function, including defense response (FDR = 1.2 × 10-11) and response to cytokine (FDR = 8.2 
132 
× 10-12), whereas repressed genes were primarily enriched for gene sets associated with metabolic 
133 
processes (Figure 2C; Supplementary Table 4). 
134 
 
135 
We next tested whether genes located near DM sites—particularly focusing on those sites exhibiting a 
136 
stable loss of methylation (i.e., Cluster 3 in Figure 1C,D)—were more likely to be differentially expressed 
137 
upon MTB infection relative to all genes in the genome. We found that genes associated with one or more 
138 
DM sites were strongly enriched among genes that were up-regulated in response to infection, regardless

of the time point at which expression levels started to change: early (2.5-fold, P = 3.23 × 10-11), 
140 
intermediate (3.5-fold, P = 3.59 × 10-25), and persistent (3.1-fold, P = 3.80 × 10-33) (Figure 2D,E).  
141 
 
142 
If demethylation is required for the activation of enhancer elements and the subsequent up-regulation of 
143 
their target genes, we would expect demethylation to occur prior to changes in gene expression; instead, 
144 
we found the opposite pattern. Among up-regulated genes associated with DM sites (n = 593), 37% 
145 
exhibited at least a two-fold increase in gene expression levels at 2-hours post-infection, although 
146 
differential methylation did not begin to be detectable until 18-hours post-infection (Figure 2E). For only 
147 
17 genes (less than 3% of all up-regulated genes associated with DM sites), DNA demethylation occurred 
148 
prior to gene activation (Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that no definitive causal relationship 
149 
between DNA demethylation and gene activation exists. 
150 
 
151 
To confirm that our findings were generalizable to other innate immune cell types and pathogenic 
152 
infections, we performed a separate time-course analysis of differential methylation in Salmonella-
153 
infected macrophages from one additional donor over six time-points (Supplementary Table 1). We 
154 
discovered hundreds of CpG sites that exhibited a progressive loss of methylation over the time course of 
155 
infection, corroborating our findings in MTB-infected DCs (Figure 3A). To assess whether 
156 
demethylation arises after the activation of associated enhancers, we collected ChIP-seq data for 
157 
acetylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) at 2-hours post-infection, as changes in DNA methylation 
158 
have yet to occur at this point. We found that the deposition of activating H3K27ac marks preceded 
159 
demethylation at these CpG sites (Figure 3B). Moreover, using previously published RNA-seq 
160 
expression data from Salmonella-infected macrophages [22], we found that most genes associated with 
161 
these sites were up-regulated at 2-hours post-infection (Figure 3C), prior to any changes in methylation. 
162 
Collectively, these findings indicate that DNA demethylation is not required for the activation of most

enhancer elements and that the vast majority of methylation changes induced by infection are a 
164 
downstream consequence of transcriptional activation. 
165 
 
166 
The binding of most infection-induced TFs does not require active demethylation 
167 
We next asked whether MTB-induced gene expression changes were associated with changes in 
168 
chromatin accessibility. To do so, we profiled regions of open chromatin in non-infected and infected 
169 
DCs at the same time-points (plus one additional time-point at 24 hours) using ATAC-seq [23]. Overall, 
170 
we found that the response to MTB infection was accompanied by an increase in chromatin accessibility 
171 
across regulatory regions associated with genes up-regulated upon MTB infection, regardless of their 
172 
expression profiles (Figure 4A). Interestingly, most increases in chromatin accessibility were observed at 
173 
later stages of infection, suggesting that the activation of early response genes does not require significant 
174 
modifications to the chromatin structure.  
175 
 
176 
To investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and TF occupancy, we performed TF 
177 
footprinting analysis on our target regions (i.e., the set of putative enhancers tested for dynamic DNA 
178 
methylation). We classified target regions as “hypomethylated regions” (n = 1,877) or “non-differentially 
179 
methylated regions” (non-DMRs) (n = 31,182) according to whether or not these regions overlap DM 
180 
CpG sites (from differential methylation Cluster 3, specifically). We found that hypomethylated regions 
181 
were significantly enriched for the binding of immune-related TFs relative to regions exhibiting 
182 
consistent methylation levels. These immune-related TFs include several master regulators of the innate 
183 
immune response, such as NF-κB/Rel family members NFKB1 (up to 4.6-fold enrichment across the time 
184 
course (FDR = 4.78 × 10-29)) and RELA (up to 3.6-fold enrichment across the time course (FDR = 1.95 × 
185 
10-18)) Figure 4B; Supplementary Table 5).

We next used CentiDual [5] to test for differential binding of TFs between non-infected and infected 
188 
samples, specifically focusing on the set of TF family members known to orchestrate innate immune 
189 
responses to infection (i.e., NF-κB/Rel, AP-1, STATs, and IRFs). We found increased binding at NF-
190 
κB/Rel binding motifs starting at 2-hours post-infection, despite the fact that no changes in methylation 
191 
were observed at such early time points (P = 0.002; Figure 4C; Supplementary Table 5; see Methods). 
192 
A similar pattern was observed for AP-1 (P = 0.01; Supplementary Figure 6). These data show that, 
193 
while demethylated regions overlap areas bound by immune-induced TFs, the binding of these TFs occurs 
194 
prior to DNA demethylation.  
195 
 
196 
Although demethylation does not appear to be required for the binding of key TFs involved in regulation 
197 
of innate immune responses, it is plausible that the removal of methylation marks at DM sites might 
198 
enable occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors at later time points [24-26]. In support of this 
199 
hypothesis, we found that, at later time-points (18 hours and above), there was a stronger enrichment for 
200 
the binding of TFs that preferentially bind to unmethylated motifs (or “methyl-minus” as defined by Yin 
201 
et al. [24]) within hypomethylated regions (up to 1.7-fold enrichment; χ2-test; P = 4.14 × 10-34; Figure 
202 
4D; see Methods). Collectively, these results suggest that, although demethylation is likely not required 
203 
for the engagement of the core regulatory program induced early after infection, it might play a role in 
204 
fine-tuning the innate immune response by facilitating the binding of salient methyl-sensitive TFs that 
205 
mediate later immune responses. 
206 
 
207 
DISCUSSION 
208 
In this study, we generated paired data on DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility 
209 
in non-infected and MTB-infected DCs at multiple time-points. Our results show that bacterial infection 
210 
leads to marked remodeling of the methylome of phagocytic cells (both DCs and macrophages), with 
211 
several thousand CpG sites showing stable losses of methylation via active DNA demethylation.

Strikingly, in our experiment, virtually all changes in gene expression in response to infection occurred 
213 
prior to detectable alterations in DNA methylation, suggesting that the observed demethylation is a 
214 
downstream consequence of TF binding and transcriptional activation. We note, however, that our 
215 
bisulfite sequencing data does not allow us to distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC. Thus, it is possible 
216 
that the gain of 5hmC in DM sites, which do not show a loss of 5mC at 2-hours post-infection, precedes 
217 
the activation of certain enhancers, as was recently suggested in T cells [8].   
218 
 
219 
The observed changes in methylation most likely occur via TET2-mediated active demethylation, as 
220 
previously shown [5, 17, 27]. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that CpG sites that lose 
221 
methylation upon infection display high levels of 5hmC at baseline, suggesting that these regions are 
222 
actively bound by TET2 even prior to infection.  Moreover, TET2 is strongly upregulated 2 hours after 
223 
infection (∼2.5 fold; Supplementary Figure 7). 5hmC could be a stable intermediate that serves as an 
224 
epigenetic priming mark, ensuring the rapid response of DCs against infection [19-21, 27-30]. Further 
225 
studies are necessary to investigate the functional relevance of 5hmC in the induction of inflammatory 
226 
genes during infection. 
227 
 
228 
Using footprint analysis, we show that NF-κB/Rel, a master regulator of inflammation, is recruited to 
229 
hypomethylated regions as soon as 2-hours post-infection. This finding is consistent with ChIP-seq data 
230 
collected from macrophages stimulated with Kdo2-Lipid A (KLA), a highly specific TLR4 agonist, which 
231 
shows that the NF-κB subunit p65 is rapidly recruited to enhancer elements within one hour post-
232 
stimulation [31]. We hypothesize that the rapid binding of NF-κB, and of other immune-induced TFs, 
233 
instigates chromatin opening which is then followed by the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase p300 
234 
and the subsequent deposition of activating H3K27ac marks in these regions [32]. Interestingly, p300 can 
235 
acetylate TET2, conferring enhanced enzyme activity [33], which might account for the eventual loss of 
236 
DNA methylation in response to infection.

238 
Our results indicate that most changes in gene expression that occur in response to infection are 
239 
independent of DNA demethylation, further supporting a lack repressive capacity of DNA methylation 
240 
[34]. Notably, for only 17 genes—out of thousands of differently expressed genes in response to MTB 
241 
infection—there is evidence that DNA demethylation occurred prior to gene activation. Similar to 
242 
previous findings [27, 35-40], our results further reinforce the idea that site-specific regulation of DNA 
243 
demethylation is mediated by TFs that bind to cis-acting sequences. Interestingly, several recent reports 
244 
have shown that other epigenetic modifications, such as the H3K4me1 enhancer mark, have a similar 
245 
passive regulatory function [41-43]. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that 
246 
demethylation might be necessary for the binding of a second wave of TFs that only play a role at later 
247 
stages of infection (18 hours post-infection or later). In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed a 
248 
significant enrichment of binding of TFs known to preferentially bind unmethylated CpGs in 
249 
hypomethylated regions, primarily at later stages post-infection. Ultimately, this suggests that DNA 
250 
demethylation is not a key regulatory mechanism of early innate immune responses but that it could still 
251 
play a role in fine-tuning later innate immune responses by facilitating the binding of methylation-
252 
sensitive TFs at enhancers.  
253 
 
254 
After an infection is cleared, TFs are expected to unbind, and gene expression as well as DNA 
255 
methylation levels are anticipated to return to basal state. However, our 72-hour time course study of 
256 
DNA methylation shows that levels of methylation at DM sites gradually decrease with time post-
257 
infection and never revert back to higher levels. Interestingly, this pattern is also observed for genes in 
258 
which the largest fold changes in gene expression occur at earlier time points. Thus, we speculate that 
259 
demethylation in response to infection could have a specific biological role in innate immune memory 
260 
[44-47], and that regions that stably lose methylation may act as primed enhancers, potentially allowing 
261 
for a faster response to a secondary infection.

METHODS 
264 
Biological material and sequencing libraries. Buffy coats from healthy donors were purchased from 
265 
Indiana Blood Center and all participants signed a written consent. The ethics committee at the CHU 
266 
Sainte-Justine approved the project (protocol #4023). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 
267 
obtained by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque, and monocytes were isolated by positive selection with CD14 
268 
magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes were differentiated into either DCs by adding rhIL-4 (20 
269 
ng/mL; Shenandoah Biotechnology,Inc) and rhGM-CSF (20 ng/mL; R&D Systems Inc.) or macrophages 
270 
by adding rhM-CSF (20ng/mL; R&D Systems Inc.) in the cell culture medium. 
271 
 
272 
DCs were infected with MTB for 2, 18, 48, and 72 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1 or with 
273 
heat-killed MTB at MOI of 5:1, as this MOI induces virtually the same transcriptional response at all four 
274 
time points compared to that observed with live MTB (Supplementary Figure 2). Macrophages were 
275 
infected with Salmonella typhimurium as previously described [22]. Briefly, macrophages were infected 
276 
at MOI of 10:1 for 2 hours, washed, and cultured for 1 hour with 50µg/ml gentamycin, then washed again 
277 
and cultured in complete medium with 3µg/ml gentamycin for an additional 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 or 48 h, the 
278 
time points we refer to in the main text.  
279 
 
280 
DNA from DCs was extracted using the PureGene DNA extraction kit (Gentra Systems). DNA from 
281 
macrophages was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). RNA was extracted using 
282 
the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was evaluated with the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent 
283 
Technologies) and only samples with no evidence of RNA degradation (RNA integrity number > 8) were 
284 
kept for further experiments. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit 
285 
v2, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

ATAC-seq libraries were generated from 50,000 cells, as previously described [23]. We collected ChIP-
288 
seq data for the H3K27ac histone mark in non-infected and Salmonella-infected macrophages as 
289 
previously described [5]. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500, as per the 
290 
manufacturer’s instructions.  
291 
 
292 
SeqCap Epi library preparation and sequencing.  
293 
Libraries were generated with KAPA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina Platforms (KAPA Biosystems), 
294 
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, genomic DNA was fragmented to 100-300 bp with an S2 
295 
sonicator (Covaris). Fragments were then end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated with methylated sequencing 
296 
adapters. Between every enzymatic step, libraries were purified using AMPure beads (Agencourt). After 
297 
ligation, in addition to the AMPure bead purification, a DUAL-SPRI size selection was performed to 
298 
further select for fragments with adapters in the window of 200-400 bp. Sodium bisulfite conversion was 
299 
performed with EZ DNA Methylation Lightning Kit (Zymo Research), and libraries were amplified using 
300 
KAPA Hifi HotStart Uracil Tolerant Enzyme (KAPA Biosystems). Library quality was assessed by 2100 
301 
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples showing the desired profile were pooled together in equal 
302 
mass according to Qubit quantification. We then performed a hybridization using the SeqCap Epi kit 
303 
(Roche NimbleGen). The sample pool, indexes corresponding to the sequences of the adapters used for 
304 
library preparation, and repetitive DNA (C0t) were desiccated and then incubated in hybridization buffer 
305 
with a set of customized probes for 72 hours to select and sequence target regions only. Specifically, 
306 
DNA methylation data was collected for 33,059 target regions spanning >130,000 CpG sites (mean length 
307 
= 300 bp; mean number of CpG sites = 5), which is less than 1% of the ~28 million CpGs contained in the 
308 
human genome. These regions were primarily comprised of MTB-induced differentially methylated 
309 
regions identified at 18 hours post-infection using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, as well as other 
310 
distal regulatory elements in DCs where changes in DNA methylation have been shown to be most likely 
311 
to occur (Supplementary Figure 1A) [5]. Moreover, these candidate regions were nearby differentially

expressed genes in response to MTB at 18 hours. Probes targeting a two kilobase region between 
313 
coordinates 4500 and 6500 bp of the lambda genome (NC_001416.1) were also included in the SeqCap 
314 
Epi design, as a control for bisulfite conversion efficiency. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina 
315 
HiSeq 2500, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

SeqCap Epi data processing and differential methylation analysis. Adaptor sequences and low-quality 
318 
score 
bases 
(Phred

< 
20) 
were 
first 
trimmed 
using 
Trim 
Galore 
319 
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). The resulting reads were mapped to 
320 
the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) and lambda phage genome using Bismark [48], which uses 
321 
Bowtie 2 [49] and a bisulfite converted reference genome for read mapping. Only reads that had a unique 
322 
alignment were retained. Methylation levels for each CpG site were estimated by counting the number of 
323 
sequenced C (‘methylated’ reads) divided by the total number of reported C and T (‘unmethylated’ reads) 
324 
at the same position of the reference genome using Bismark’s methylation extractor tool. We performed a 
325 
strand-independent analysis of CpG methylation where counts from the two Cs in a CpG and its reverse 
326 
complement (position i on the plus strand and position i+1 on the minus strand) were combined and 
327 
assigned to the position of the C in the plus strand. To assess MethylC-seq bisulfite conversion rate, the 
328 
frequency of unconverted cytosines (C basecalls) at lambda phage CpG reference positions was 
329 
calculated from reads uniquely mapped to the lambda phage reference genome. Overall, bisulfite 
330 
conversion rate was >99% in all of the samples (Supplementary Table 1).  
331 
 
332 
In DCs, differentially methylated (DM) CpG sites at each time point following MTB infection were 
333 
identified using the R package DSS [15]. We used a linear model with the following design: DNA 
334 
methylation ~ Donor + Infection, which allowed us to consider the paired nature of the experiment and 
335 
capture the effects of infection on DNA methylation observed within donors. We considered a CpG site 
336 
as differentially methylated if statistically supported at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.01 and an

absolute mean methylation difference above 10%. Only CpG sites that had a coverage of at least 5X in 
338 
each of the samples were included in the analysis (103,649 in total).  
339 
 
340 
To identify DM sites that show a stable loss of methylation (as Cluster 3 DM sites in DCs) in Salmonella-
341 
infected macrophages using one individual, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis on sites that 
342 
specifically: (i) do not change methylation at 2 hours (|methylation difference| < 10%), and (ii) lose 
343 
methylation at 48 hours (methylation difference < -40%). 
344 
 
345 
5hmC enrichment at DM sites. To calculate the enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at DM 
346 
CpG sites (Clusters 1, 2 and 3), we compared the distribution of 5hmC levels in non-infected DCs 
347 
between DM and non-DM sites. Since non-DM sites have lower overall levels of baseline methylation 
348 
than DM sites (Supplementary Figure 8A), we performed similar enrichment analysis by using a 
349 
random set of non-DM sites that matches the distribution of methylation found in non-infected samples 
350 
within each set of DM sites (Supplementary Figure 8B). Each random set contains the same number of 
351 
CpG sites as those identified within each DM cluster.

RNA-seq data processing and identification of differentially expressed genes. Read count estimates 
354 
per gene were obtained using the alignment-free method Kallisto [50]. For all downstream analyses, we 
355 
excluded non-coding and lowly-expressed genes with an average read count lower than 10 in all of the 
356 
samples, resulting in 13,955 genes in total. The R package DESeq2 [51] was used to identify differences 
357 
in expression levels between non-infected and infected samples at each time point. Nominal p-values 
358 
were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [52]. The complete list of 
359 
differentially expressed genes can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

Gene set enrichment analysis. We used ClueGO [53] at default parameters to test for enrichment of 
362 
functionally annotated gene sets among differentially expressed genes. The results for these enrichment 
363 
analyses are reported in Supplementary Table 4. Enrichment p-values were based on a hypergeometric 
364 
test using the set of 13,955 genes as background. Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied for multiple 
365 
testing correction.

ChIP-seq data processing and tag density profiles. ChIP-seq reads were trimmed for adapter sequences 
368 
and low-quality score bases using Trim Galore. The resulting reads were mapped to the human reference 
369 
genome using Bowtie 2 with the following option: -N 1. Only reads that had a unique alignment were 
370 
retained, 
and 
PCR 
duplicates 
were 
further 
removed 
using 
Picard 
tools 
371 
(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Tag density profiles for chromatin modifications and genome 
372 
accessibility patterns around regions of interest were accomplished with ngs.plot package [54] using 
373 
default parameters.

375 
ATAC-seq data processing and TF footprinting analysis. ATAC-seq reads were trimmed for adapter 
376 
sequences and low-quality score bases and were mapped to the human reference genome. Mapping was 
377 
performed using BWA-MEM [55] in paired-end mode at default parameters. Only reads that had a unique 
378 
alignment (mapping quality > 10) were retained. TF footprinting analyses were performed as previously 
379 
described, using the Centidual algorithm [5] and JASPAR annotated human TF binding motifs (2018 
380 
release) [56]. For each of the actively bound TFs in DCs (241 in total; FDR < 0.05 at 18 hours post-
381 
infection; Supplementary Table 5)), we first trained Centidual assuming that the footprint was bound in 
382 
the two conditions. Then, we fixed the model parameters and generated a likelihood ratio and posterior 
383 
probability 
 for each condition 
 separately and for each site . To detect if the footprint was more 
384 
active in one of the two conditions, we fit a logistic model that included an intercept for each condition (
385 
 and 
), the PWM effect 
, and PWM times the treatment effect

388 
calculated a Z-score for the interaction effect 
, corresponding to the evidence for condition-specific

binding. ATAC-seq samples were down-sampled to obtain similar number of reads between NI and HI 
390 
samples at each time-point.  We used a window size of 300 bp on either side of the motif match, and 
391 
reads with fragment lengths [40, 140] and [141, 600] bp for footprinting analyses.

Relationship between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Peaks were first called on ATAC-
408 
seq using the MACS2 software suite [57] with the added parameters: -g hs -q 0.05 --broad --nomodel --
409 
extsize 200 --nolambda. All peaks from each sample were then merged to provide one set of combined 
410 
peaks. To count the number of reads overlapping peaks, we used featureCount (from the subread 
411 
package) [58] with the following option: -p -P. For all downstream analyses, we excluded low-count 
412 
peaks with an average read count lower than 10 across all samples, resulting in 79,282 peaks in total. We 
413 
then plotted the distribution of changes in Tn5 accessibility (between non-infected and MTB-infected 
414 
DCs across the five time-points of infection (2, 4, 18, 24, 48, and 72 hours)) for the top 25% most 
415 
variable peaks associated with DE genes in each cluster. The DE genes associated with the selected peaks 
416 
represent ~50% of the total genes within each of the DE clusters: (i) Early induced: 418/765 = 55%; (ii) 
417 
Intermediate induced: 418/839 = 49%; and (iii) Persistent induced: 1083/2091 = 52%.

Figure 1. (A) Barplots showing the number of differentially methylated (DM) CpG sites identified at a 
436 
|methylation difference| > 10% and FDR < 0.01 (y-axis) at each time point after MTB infection (2, 18, 48, 
437 
and 72 hours (h)) (x-axis). (B) Distribution of differences in methylation between infected and non-
438 
infected cells at DM sites, at each time point. (C) Heatmap of differences in methylation constructed 
439 
using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 4,578 DM sites (identified at any time point using live 
440 
and heat-inactivated MTB-infected samples combined; y-axis) across four time points after infection, 
441 
which shows three distinct patterns of changes in methylation. (D) Mean differences in methylation of 
442 
CpG sites in each cluster across all time points; shading denotes ±1 standard deviation. For visualization

Figure 2. (A) Heatmap of differences in expression (standardized log2 fold changes) constructed using 
448 
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 7,457 differentially expressed genes (identified at any time 
449 
point using cutoffs of |log2FC| > 1 and FDR < 0.01; y-axis) across four time points after MTB infection 
450 
results in six distinct patterns of changes in expression. (B) Mean log2 fold expression changes of genes 
451 
in each cluster across all time points; shading denotes ±1 standard deviation. For visualization purposes, 
452 
we also show the ‘0h’ time point, where we expect no changes in expression. (C) Gene ontology 
453 
enrichment analyses among genes that are repressed or induced in response to MTB infection. (D) 
454 
Enrichment (in log2; x-axis) of differentially expressed genes associated with differentially methylated 
455 
CpG sites (Cluster 3). Error bars show 95% confidence intervals for the enrichment estimates. (E) 
456 
Boxplots showing the distribution of standardized differences in methylation of DM sites in Cluster 3 
457 
(blue) along with the corresponding standardized differences in expression of the associated genes

Figure 3. (A) Mean differences in methylation (y-axis) in CpG sites that show stable losses of 
461 
methylation (similar to Cluster 3 DM sites in Figure 1C,D; n = 453) in Salmonella-infected macrophages, 
462 
across six time points after infection (2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours (h); x-axis). Shading denotes ±1 
463 
standard deviation. For visualization purposes, we also show the ‘0h’ time point, where we expect no 
464 
changes in methylation. (B) Composite plots of patterns of H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals ±5 kb around the 
465 
midpoints of hypomethylated sites (x-axis) in macrophages at 2 hours post-infection with Salmonella. (C)

Figure 4. (A) Boxplots showing the distribution of log2 fold changes in chromatin accessibility between 
470 
non-infected and MTB-infected DCs across the five time points of infection (2, 4, 18, 24, 48, and 72 
471 
hours) for open chromatin regions associated with the three classes of induced genes described in Figure 
472 
2A,B. (B) TF binding motifs for which the number of well-supported footprints (posterior probability > 
473 
0.99) within hypomethylated regions were enriched (FDR < 0.01) relative to non-DMRs (with 250-bp 
474 
flanking the start and end) in MTB-infected DCs. The enrichment factors (x-axis) are shown in a log2 
475 
scale and error bars reflect the 95% confidence intervals. A complete list of all TF binding motifs for 
476 
which footprints are enriched within hypomethylated regions can be found in Supplementary Table 5. (C) 
477 
Barplots showing significant differences in TF occupancy score predictions for NF-κB/Rel motifs 
478 
between MTB-infected and non-infected DCs (ZMTB - ZNI; y-axis; see Methods) across all time points (x-
479 
axis). A positive Z-score difference indicates increased TF binding in hypomethylated regions after MTB 
480 
infection. (D) Proportion of regions that overlap a methylation-sensitive (“methyl-minus”; reported in Yin 
481 
et al. [24]) TF footprint (y-axis) observed among non-DMRs and hypomethylated regions (or hypo-
482 
DMRs; see Methods).
