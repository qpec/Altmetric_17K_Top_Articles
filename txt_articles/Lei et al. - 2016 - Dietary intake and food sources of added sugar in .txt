Abstract
Previous studies in Australian children/adolescents and adults examining added sugar (AS) intake were based on now out-of-date national
surveys. We aimed to examine the AS and free sugar (FS) intakes and the main food sources of AS among Australians, using plausible dietary
data collected by a multiple-pass, 24-h recall, from the 2011–12 Australian Health Survey respondents (n 8202). AS and FS intakes were
estimated using a previously published method, and as defined by the WHO, respectively. Food groups contributing to the AS intake were
described and compared by age group and sex by one-way ANOVA. Linear regression was used to test for trends across age groups. Usual
intake of FS (as percentage energy (%EFS)) was computed using a published method and compared with the WHO cut-off of <10 %EFS. The
mean AS intake of the participants was 60·3 (SD 52·6) g/d. Sugar-sweetened beverages accounted for the greatest proportion of the AS intake of
the Australian population (21·4 (SD 30·1) %), followed by sugar and sweet spreads (16·3 (SD 24·5) %) and cakes, biscuits, pastries and batter-
based products (15·7 (SD 24·4) %). More than half of the study population exceeded the WHO’s cut-off for FS, especially children and
adolescents. Overall, 80–90 % of the daily AS intake came from high-sugar energy-dense and/or nutrient-poor foods. To conclude, the majority
of Australian adults and children exceed the WHO recommendation for FS intake. Efforts to reduce AS intake should focus on energy-dense
and/or nutrient-poor foods.
Key words: Total sugars: Added sugar: Free sugar: Food sources: Australian population: National surveys: Australian Health Survey
‘Added sugar’ is commonly defined as sugars added to foods
during processing and preparation. It has become a prime focus
of nutritional intervention and research in recent years, as it
provides energy with no or little associated nutrients – the so-
called ‘empty calories’(1,2). Studies have shown that excessive
added sugar intake can dilute the nutrient content of the
diet(3–6) and can increase total energy intake(7), ultimately
leading to weight gain(8). Therefore, dietary guidelines around
the world consistently recommend limiting the intake of added
sugar(9–12). Recently, the World Health Organization released a
set of revised sugars guidelines(13), which recommends a limit
of <10 % energy from ‘free sugars’ (i.e. added sugar plus honey,
syrups
and
sugars
in
fruit
juices).
Although
the
WHO
acknowledged that the evidence supporting the association
between added sugars and obesity and other health outcomes
is limited at this stage, it concluded that the clear association
between high or frequent consumption of free sugars and
increased risk of dental caries(9) warrants a stricter limit(13).
To inform public health policy decisions, data on the current
intake of added sugar are much needed as the 1995 Australian
National Nutrition Survey (NNS) is now out-of-date(6). Although
our group has published more recent data on Australian
children and adolescents based on a national survey conducted
in 2007(14), the food supply and dietary patterns of the
Australian population may have substantially changed in the
past 10–20 years. Furthermore, Australian apparent consump-
tion data(15) suggest that there has been a declining trend in
added sugar intake over the past 40 years. This trend was
similar to that observed in other developed countries(16–19).
To fill this important gap in the literature, this study aims to
describe the intake and food sources of added sugar of the
Australian population, using data from the most recent national
nutrition survey – the 2011–12 Australian Health Survey
(AHS)(20). We also aimed to examine age and sex differences in
added sugar intake and food sources. To benchmark the
population intake of Australians, we also examined the intake
of free sugars as defined by the World Health Organization(13).
Methods
Data source
Data from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey
(NNPAS) component of the 2011–2012 AHS were used(20). The
2011–12 NNPAS was conducted by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics in 2011 and 2012. It measured the consumption of foods,

 beverages and dietary supplements, as well as information on
dietary behaviours. Dietary data were collected using a computer-
assisted, multiple-pass, 24-h recall from 12153 individuals aged 2
years and over in a face-to-face interview. Where possible, at
least 8d after the first interview, respondents were contacted to
participate in a second 24-h dietary recall via a telephone interview
(n 7735)(20). Data from this second recall were excluded from the
primary analyses, and were only used to generate usual intake data
(See the ‘Statistical analyses’ section). Food and beverage intakes
were then translated into energy and nutrient intakes using the
AUStralian Food and NUTrient Database (AUSNUT) 2011–13 food
composition database(21).
Anthropometric measurements
Weight and height were measured without shoes and heavy
clothing where possible, using a digital scale (to the nearest
0·1 kg) and a stadiometer (to the nearest 0·1 cm), respectively.
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in metres. Subjects were then classified as underweight,
normal weight, overweight or obese based on their BMI. For
children and adolescents (2–18 years), age- (in half yearly
intervals) and sex-specific BMI cut-offs(22) were used. For adults
(19+ years) the following cut-offs(23) were used: underweight
(≤18·5 kg/m2), normal weight (18·5–24·99 kg/m2), overweight
(25·0–29·99 kg/m2) and obese (≥30·0 kg/m2).
Non-dietary variables
Information on household income was collected from an adult
respondent within each of the sampled households, which
represents the combined income of all household members
aged 15 years and over. This was then classified into deciles.
The Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)(24), a ranking of
socio-economic status based on regions/areas, were derived
based on the geographical location of the household. SEIFA
quintiles were created where the highest quintile represents the
most advantaged areas. Urbanity of the household location
was classified based on the Australian Standard Geographical
Classification
remoteness
classification(25),
and
in
this
study households classified as located in ‘major cities of
Australia’ and ‘inner regional Australia’ were considered as
urban. Respondents reported their country of birth, which was
classified into ‘Australia’, ‘major English-speaking countries’ and
‘other countries’.
Data cleaning
The plausibility of the food intake data was assessed using the
Goldberg cut-off(26) for specific physical activity level (PAL). As
PAL data were not available from the survey, we assigned a
standard PAL of 1·55 to all respondents as per the advice of the
Australian Bureau of Statistics(20) and similar to previous
studies(27–29). Participants with an energy intake:BMR ratio
outside the 95 % CI were excluded from the analysis. We
excluded 1847 extremely low reporters and 2104 extremely
high reporters based on this method. The final data set included
8202 participants, of which 47·8 % were female. The demographic
characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table 1.
Method for estimating added sugar and free sugar content
of foods
In this study, the term ‘added sugar’ refers to ‘sugars and syrups
that are added to foods or beverages when they are processed
or prepared’(30), which is the definition used by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture(31).
A method developed by our group(30) was used to estimate
the added sugar content of the 5740 foods in the AUSNUT
2011–13 food composition database(21). In brief, the ten steps
are as follows:
Step 1: Assign 0 g added sugar to foods with 0 g total sugars
(n 1329).
Step 2: Assign 0 g added sugar to foods in food groups that
are either unprocessed or minimally processed with no
added sugar (n 1369).
Step 3: Assign 100 % of total sugar as added sugar for foods
in food groups that contain no naturally occurring sugars
(n 462).
Step 4: Calculation based on standard recipe used in the
food composition database (n 772).
Step 5: Calculation based on comparison with values from
the unsweetened variety (n 63).
Step 6: Decision based on analytical data – for example, all
lactose in dairy foods was considered naturally occurring (n 131).
Step 7: Use borrowed values from similar products from
steps 1–6 or from overseas databases (n 130).
Step 8: Subjective estimation based on ingredients and/or
common recipes (n 277).
Step 9: Calculation based on the standard recipe that
includes ingredients with values assigned at steps 5–8, using
the proportion method (n 1182).
Step 10: Assign 50 % of total sugars as added sugar to foods
that are not included in steps 1–9 (n 25).
Free sugar contents of foods were defined based on the WHO
definition as 100 % of added sugar for non-fruit juice sources
(including honey and syrups) and 100 % of total sugars for fruit
juices and drinks(13). The added and free sugar values were
then linked to the NNPAS database to generate the intake of
added and free sugar of individual respondents.
Food groupings
To determine the food sources of added sugar of the population,
foods considered likely to contain added sugar were classified into
the following categories: sugar-sweetened beverages (fruit drinks,
cordial/mixer, soft drinks, energy drinks and other sweetened
beverages); cakes, biscuits, pastries and batter-based products
(sweet and savoury biscuits, cakes, buns, pastries, muffins and
scones); sugar and sweet spreads (sugar, honey, jam, syrup and
other sweet spreads); chocolate and confectionery (chocolate,
chocolate-based
confectionery
and
other
confectionery);
sweetened dairy products (flavoured or condensed milk, yoghurt,
frozen yoghurt and custard); bread and cereals (bread, breakfast
cereal and bars); ice cream and ice confection (ice cream, frozen
desserts and ice confection). All other food groups were grouped
into ‘other food sources’ (detailed food grouping decision can be
found in online Supplementary Table S1).

 Statistical analyses
All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0
(IBM), and weighting factors were applied in all analyses. All the
results are presented as mean values and standard deviations for
continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables.
Data were weighted to control for under- and/or over-sampling in
particular categories of persons and households, which may
occur because of the random nature of sampling or non-
response(20). This enables representation of the general Australian
population aged 2 years or above. Usual percentage energy from
free sugars (%EFS) of the participants, computed by the Multiple
Source Method(32) to account for intra-personal variability by
taking into account the data from the second 24-h recall, was
compared with the WHO recommendation for ‘free sugar’ intake
(<10 % of total energy intake from free sugar/d). A further
reduction to below 5 % of total energy from free sugars/d is
suggested for additional health benefits(13). Pearson’s χ2 test was
used to test for differences in categorical variables across the age
groups and between children and adolescents v. adults.
Per capita analysis included all respondents with plausible
intake data, and represents the mean intake of the population.
Per consumer analysis included only subjects who had reported
the consumption of food item(s) in the food groups tested
(online Supplementary Table S2). The differences in percentage
contribution
of
added
sugar
from
major
added
sugar-
contributing food groups between sexes and the differences
in continuous variables between children and adolescents v.
adults were tested by one-way ANOVA. For all the analyses,
linear regression with age (years, continuous) as the indepen-
dent variable was used to test for trends across age groups.
Owing to the number of comparisons made, P < 0·01 was
considered to indicate marginal statistical significance, and
P < 0·001 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
The demographics of the subjects are summarised in Table 1.
There was a higher proportion of males than females among the
included subjects (52·2 v. 47·8 %). A higher proportion of adults
were classified as overweight or obese (60·1 v. 23·2 %;
P < 0·001), and a lower proportion of adults were born in
Australia (69·1 v. 90·0 %; P < 0·001) compared with children and
adolescents.
Table 2 shows the daily intakes of energy, macronutrients and
added and free sugars by age groups. Intakes of fat and protein
(as percentage energy) appeared to increase with age (Ptrend=0·05
and <0·001, respectively), with a concurrent decrease in percen-
tage energy from carbohydrates (Ptrend<0·001). The estimated
mean daily intake of total, added and free sugars of the study
population were 114·2 (SD 61·8), 60·3 (SD 52·6) and 65·1 (SD 54·3)g/
d, contributing 19·8 (SD 8·5), 10·8 (SD 8·0) and 11·7 (SD 8·3)% of the
total daily energy intake, respectively. Males had a significantly
higher mean daily intake of total (124·6 (SD 68·5) v. 103·0
(SD 51·4)g/d; P<0·001), added (68·0 (SD 58·8) v. 51·9 (SD 43·4)g/d;
P<0·001) and free sugars (73·5 (SD 60·5) v. 56·0 (SD 44·9)g/d;
P<0·001) than females. Added sugar and free sugar accounted for
48·2 (SD 23·5) and 52·2 (SD 23·2) % of total sugars in the Australian
population, respectively. People in the age group of 9–13, 14–18
and 19–30 years had more than half of their total sugars as added
sugar (52·3 (SD 20·5), 58·4 (SD 20·9) and 53·6 (SD 25·2) %,
respectively). More than half (55·7 %) of the study population
had higher usual intake of free sugar than the WHO’s
recommendation, and children and adolescents were more
likely to exceed the two cut-offs compared with adults (72·7 v.
50·6 %; P < 0·001). Children aged 9–13 years had the highest
proportion (76·2 %) exceeding 10 %EFS. Those aged 14–18
years had the highest mean daily intake of total, added and free
sugars (132·2 (SD 68·1), 81·9 (SD 59·2) and 88·2 (SD 60·9)g/d,

 respectively), as well as the highest mean proportion of
energy intake from added sugar (13·6 (SD 8·2) %) and %EFS
(14·7 (SD 8·3) %).
Table 3 summarises the per capita percentage contribution of
added sugar from the major added sugar-contributing food
groups, stratified by age. Sugar-sweetened beverages accoun-
ted for the greatest proportion of added sugar intake of the
Australian population (21·4 (SD 30·1) %), followed by sugar and
sweet spreads (16·3 (SD 24·5) %) and cakes, biscuits, pastries
and batter-based products (15·7 (SD 24·4) %). For children aged
2–3 years, cakes, biscuits, pastries and batter-based products
contributed the largest proportion of daily added sugar intake
(20·3 (SD 26·5) %). However, sugar-sweetened beverages were
the largest contributors of added sugar in those aged 4–8, 9–13,
14–18, 19–30 and 31–50 years (22·5 (SD 27·8), 28·1 (SD 29·1),
33·9 (SD 32·9), 31·8 (SD 34·2) and 20·3 (SD 30·0) %, respectively).
Sugar and sweet spreads were the main contributors to added
sugar among older Australians aged 51 years or above. Children
and adolescents had a significantly higher proportion of
their added sugar intake from sugar-sweetened beverages
(26·8 (SD 30·0) v. 19·8 (SD 29·9); P < 0·001), cakes, biscuits,
pastries and batter-based products (17·4 (SD 24·2) v. 15·2
(SD 24·4); P < 0·001), sweetened dairy products (9·0 (SD 18·4) v.
6·2 (SD 16·5); P < 0·001), bread and cereals (9·2 (SD 17·3) v.
7·9 (SD 17·4); P = 0·004) and ice cream and ice confection
(7·9 (SD 16·3) v. 4·3 (SD 13·4); P < 0·001), and had a lower
proportion of their added sugar intake from sugar and sweet
spreads (9·2 (SD 17·0) v. 18·4 (SD 25·9); P < 0·001) compared
with adults.
The per consumer percentage contribution of added sugar
from the major added sugar-contributing food groups are
summarised in Table 4. Consumers of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages derived 50·3 (SD 25·9) % of their daily added sugar intake
from this food group. Among sugar-sweetened beverage con-
sumers, those aged 19–30 years had the greatest proportion of
energy contributed by added sugar (57·8 (SD 24·8) %), followed
by those aged 14–18 years (54·2 (SD 25·0) %). Except for con-
sumers aged over 71 years, all sugar-sweetened beverage
consumers had more than 40 % of added sugar from this food
group. Consumers of sweetened dairy products and ice cream
and ice confection aged 4–8 years derived 35·3 (SD 24·8) % and
31·7 (SD 20·3) % of their daily added sugar intake from these two
food groups, respectively.

Discussion
This study presents current data on the dietary intake and food
sources of added sugar in the Australian population using data
from the most recent national nutrition survey. The mean daily
total, added and free sugar intakes of the study population were
114 g, 60 g and 65 g, contributing 20, 11 and 12 % of total daily
energy intake, respectively. Alarmingly, more than half of the
study
population
exceeded
the
WHO’s
cut-off
for
‘free
sugar’, especially children and adolescents. Sugar-sweetened
beverages, sugar and sweet spreads and cakes, biscuits pastries
and batter-based products accounted for more than 50 % of the
daily added sugar intake. Overall 80–90 % of the daily added
sugar intake came from high-sugar energy-dense and/or

 nutrient-poor
foods,
commonly
referred
to
as
‘extra’
or
‘discretionary’ foods in dietary guidelines(9,33).
A previous analysis based on the 1995 NNS conducted by
Cobiac et al.(6) found that the estimated mean intake of added
sugar for the Australian population (adults and children) was
66·0 g/d, approximately 11 % of the total energy intake. This is
5·7 g/d higher than our findings from the 2011–2012 NNPAS,
but the percentage energy from added sugar is similar between
the two surveys. Studies from other developed countries also
report a declining trend in added sugar consumption(16,18,34,35).
For example, using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) in the USA, Welsh et al.(16)
observed a 23·4 g/d decrease in added sugar intake between
1999–2000 and 2007–2008 among US residents aged 2 years or
above. However, the magnitude of change observed was larger,
possibly due to the higher intake reported in the earlier
NHANES (100·1 g/d), leaving more room for improvement.
It is interesting to note that adolescents were found to be the
highest consumers of added sugar among all age groups in both
the present analysis and the 1995 NNS(6). Previous analysis by our
group of the more recent 2007 Australian National Children’s
Nutrition
and
Physical
Activity
Survey
(2007ANCNPAS)(14)
showed similar results, with children and adolescents aged
9–16 years having the highest added sugar intake, mainly from
increased sugar-sweetened beverage consumption.
Our results revealed that sugar-sweetened beverages were
the greatest source of added sugar in the Australian population
(21·5 %), followed by sugar and sweet spreads (16·4 %) and
cakes, biscuits, pastries and batter-based products (15·8 %). In
the 1995 NNS, the greatest source of added sugar was
non-alcoholic beverages(6), the same as observed in the present
study, with a different name for the beverage type. On the
basis of data from the three Australian national nutrition
surveys(6,14,36), the per capita percentage contribution of added
sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages among adolescents
aged 14–18 years appears to have decreased from almost 50 %
in the 1995 NNS to 24·1 % in the 2007ANCNPAS (data for
adolescents aged 14–16 years only), and then increased to
33·9 % in the 2011–12 NNPAS. Although the lack of data from
older adolescents in the 2007ANCNPAS may have influenced
the trend, the current pattern of added sugar contribution from
sugar-sweetened beverages among Australian youths is still a
public health concern.
Health professionals and consumer groups have regularly
criticised the food manufacturers for ‘blurring’ the line between
‘core’
and
‘discretionary’
foods(37,38)
by
producing
food
products high in added sugar such as breakfast cereals and
sweetened dairy products that are traditionally considered ‘core’
foods(39). However, the present analyses revealed that these
products only accounted for approximately 15 % of the daily
added sugar intake of Australians. This suggests that strategies
focusing on reducing the added sugar content in these foods
may not be the most effective approach for reducing the added
sugar intake of the population. Our results showed that the top
three sources of added sugar in the Australian population were
sugar-sweetened beverages, cakes, biscuits, pastries and batter-
based products, and sugar and sweet spreads, which are all
energy-dense
and/or
nutrient-poor
‘discretionary’
foods(9).
Therefore, interventions aimed at reducing added sugar intake
should focus on these foods, especially sugar-sweetened
beverages. As sugar-sweetened beverages contributed to half of
the added sugar among consumers, reducing the consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages, such as by replacement with water
or other low-energy beverages(40,41), may lead to a considerable
decrease in added sugar intake in the Australian population.
The WHO strongly recommends that free sugars – that is,
added sugar (including honey and syrups) plus sugars in fruit
juices – should be <10 % of daily total energy intake. A further
reduction to <5 % of daily total energy intake was proposed(13).
A commonly used alternative recommendation by the Institute
of Medicine (IOM)(42) has proposed a dietary intake of ≤25 % of
energy from added sugars. Using the IOM cut-off, we found
only <2 % exceeded this guideline (data not shown). However,
Linos & Bassett(43) argued that this cut-off was not intended to
be used as a recommended intake level, rather it represents a
cut-off where there is evidence to suggest that intake higher
than this may lead to inadequate intake of essential nutrients(43).
Therefore, it appears unsatisfactory to use this lenient cut-off as
a benchmark for population intake, particularly in terms of
reducing risk for dental caries as has been the focus of the
WHO guideline(13). In contrast, Erickson & Slavin(44) suggest
that the proposed free sugars recommendation from the
WHO is likely to be too restrictive and unachievable for most
Americans. Our results showed that this may also be the
case for Australians with more than half exceeding the 10 %EFS
cut-off and <10 % meeting the newly proposed recommenda-
tion of 5 %EFS. Nonetheless, compared with data from the
2007ANCNPAS(14), there appears to be an improvement in this
benchmark where more Australian children and adolescents in
2011–2012 are meeting the <10 %EFS guideline (27·3 v. 14·7 %).
Our study has several strengths: first, the use of sample
weighting enabled the findings to be generalised to the general
Australian population. Another strength of the study is the use
of a published, reproducible method for estimating added sugar
contents of foods(30). Although the methodology has not been
formally validated, and hence the accuracy of the estimated
values was unknown, the method has passed a vigorous peer-
review process, which established its face validity. The method
was also clearly described, which increased the transparency in
the estimation process for further review by peers, and we have
recently shown it has good reliability when applied to AUSNUT
2011–13(45). This is in contrast to methods proposed/used by
other researchers, which are often inadequately described(46).
On the basis of this method, we assigned added sugar content
to most of the 5740 foods in AUSNUT 2011–13 using an
objective step or a recipe-based step, and an assumption
that 50 % of total sugars as added sugar was only used in <0·5 %
of the foods(45).
However, there are several limitations to this study. First,
although the 24-h recall is a suitable dietary assessment method
for a large number of subjects, the use of this method in chil-
dren remains doubtful, and it has been argued that it is espe-
cially difficult to assess the dietary intake among children
accurately(47). Parental recall of food intake has been suggested
to be likely to result in under-reporting and may contribute to
inaccuracy at an individual level(48–51). Children who reported

 their own food intake were also likely to inaccurately recall
their food intake, which could be a result of incorrect identifi-
cation of foods(52,53) and/or unfamiliarity of the food(54), both of
which may lead to misreporting. Information overload (e.g.
large number of foods to report) may also bias the recall of food
intake(55). By using the Goldberg cut-off for a specific PAL
method(26), we have excluded extreme under- and over-
reporters to increase the plausibility of the findings of this
study, although it is acknowledged that the cut-offs were con-
servative and are only able to identify extreme degrees of
misreporting(56).
Second, dietary intake is likely to vary from day to day, and
therefore data obtained from one 24-h recall may not be
representative of the usual intake of an individual(57), although
it was deemed appropriate by the National Cancer Institute for
estimating population means(58). The ideal method to obtain
usual dietary intake data of individuals would be a 7-d food
record, but the large number of participants of the 2011–12
NNPAS renders this impractical. The heavy respondent load is
another issue for the 7-day food record, which may result in a
low response rate. Where estimates were calculated for a pro-
portion of subjects (such as comparisons with the WHO cut-
offs) that require dietary information at an individual level, we
utilised the Multiple Source Method(32) to generate the usual
intake to minimise errors.
Conclusions
Our results indicated that added sugar intake appeared to be
similar to that reported from the 1995 NNS. Adolescents aged
14–18 years had the highest added sugar intakes, which is
concerning. More than half of the Australian population had
more free sugars than the WHO’s recommendation. Energy-
dense nutrient-poor foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages
and
cakes,
biscuits,
pastries
and
batter-based
products
accounted for the greatest proportion of added sugar in the
Australian population. Efforts on reducing added sugar intake
should focus on reducing the consumption of these energy-
dense nutrient-poor foods, with clear messages about mini-
mising the frequent consumption of discretionary foods and
promotion of water and healthy core foods.
