Abstract
Objective—The primary aim was to compare the impact of NAVIGATE, a comprehensive, 
multidisciplinary, team-based treatment approach for first episode psychosis designed for 
implementation in the U.S. healthcare system, to Community Care on quality of life.
Methods—Thirty-four clinics in 21 states were randomly assigned to NAVIGATE or Community 
Care. Diagnosis, duration of untreated psychosis and clinical outcomes were assessed via live, 
two-way video by remote, centralized raters masked to study design and treatment. Participants 
(mean age 23) with schizophrenia and related disorders and ≤6 months antipsychotic treatment

 (N=404) were enrolled and followed for ≥2 years. The primary outcome was the Total Score of the 
Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale, a measure that includes sense of purpose, motivation, 
emotional and social interactions, role functioning and engagement in regular activities.
Results—223 NAVIGATE recipients remained in treatment longer, experienced greater 
improvement in quality of life, psychopathology and involvement in work/school compared to 181 
Community Care participants. The median duration of untreated psychosis=74 weeks. NAVIGATE 
participants with duration of untreated psychosis <74 weeks had greater improvement in quality of 
life and psychopathology compared with those with longer duration of untreated psychosis and 
those in Community Care. Rates of hospitalization were relatively low compared to other first 
episode psychosis clinical trials and did not differ between groups.
Conclusions—Comprehensive care for first episode psychosis can be implemented in U.S. 
community clinics. and improves functional and clinical outcomes. Effects are more pronounced 
for those with shorter duration of untreated psychosis.
Introduction
Schizophrenia is associated with enormous personal suffering, disability, family burden, 
premature death, and societal cost (1,2). Randomized trials suggest that intervention close to 
psychosis onset improves symptoms and functioning more than traditional care (3,4). 
Comprehensive first episode psychosis programs that emphasize low-dose antipsychotic 
medications, cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, family education/support, and vocational/
educational recovery have been implemented worldwide (5-11), but few randomized 
controlled trials have compared multimodal, multidisciplinary team approaches to usual care 
in first episode psychosis (12-16). Such programs can be easier to implement in settings with 
a national healthcare system, perhaps why a multi-site study of first episode psychosis 
treatment has never been conducted in the U.S. in non-academic, community clinics under 
existing reimbursement mechanisms. Despite the fact that academic centers play a key role 
in developing and testing new treatment strategies, such strategies must be implemented in 
typical, “real world” settings.
This report presents two-year outcome data from first episode psychosis subjects 
participating in a multi-site, randomized controlled trial comparing comprehensive, team-
based treatment to usual care in U.S. community treatment centers. We also explored how 
the duration of untreated psychosis influences treatment response.
Methods
The Early Treatment Program (ETP) study is part of the National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH) Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative. RAISE aims to 
develop, test, and implement person-centered, integrated treatment approaches for first 
episode psychosis that promote symptomatic and functional recovery. The background, 
rationale, and design of the RAISE-ETP trial is described elsewhere (17).

 a. Subjects
404 individuals between ages 15-40 were enrolled. (a consort diagram appears in 
Supplemental Figure S1.) DSM-IV (18) diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, or psychotic disorder not 
otherwise specified were included. Diagnoses of affective psychosis, substance-induced 
psychotic disorder, psychosis due to general medical conditions, clinically significant head 
trauma, or other serious medical conditions were excluded. All participants had experienced 
only one episode of psychosis (i.e. individuals with a psychotic episode followed by full 
symptom remission and relapse to another psychotic episode were excluded) and had taken 
≤6 months of lifetime antipsychotics. All spoke English.
Written informed consent was obtained from adult participants and legal guardians of those 
under 18 years old, who provided written assent. The study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Boards of the coordinating center and the participating sites. The NIMH 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided study oversight.
b. Clinical Sites and Randomization
Thirty-four community mental health treatment centers in 21 states were selected via 
national search. Site eligibility criteria included (1) experience treating people with 
schizophrenia; (2) interest in offering early intervention services for first episode psychosis; 
(3) sufficient staff to implement the experimental intervention; (4) ability to recruit an 
adequate number of subjects; and (5) institutional assurance that research assessments would 
be completed. Academic centers or sites with existing first episode programs were excluded.
RAISE-ETP employed a cluster randomization design; i.e., randomization by clinic rather 
than individual patient (19). Clinics were randomly assigned to the experimental 
intervention (n=17) or standard care (n=17). None withdrew after randomization.
c. Interventions
The experimental treatment, NAVIGATE (20), includes four core interventions: personalized 
medication management (assisted by “COMPASS,” a secure, web-based, computerized 
decision support system developed for RAISE-ETP); family psychoeducation; resilience-
focused individual therapy; and supported education and employment (SEE). Treatment was 
supported through existing funding mechanisms except for SEE, which is not supported in 
many locations. SEE services (5 hours/week) were supported with research funds.
Treatment components are offered/implemented within a shared decision-making, patient 
preference framework (21). Weekly team meetings facilitated communication and 
coordination. NAVIGATE sites received initial training in team-based first episode psychosis 
interventions and on-going expert consultation facilitated fidelity (20). We continually 
assessed clinicians’ competence and monitored team functioning. These assessments will be 
reported later.
The control condition, “Community Care”, is psychosis treatment determined by clinician 
choice and service availability. Community Care sites received no additional training or

 supervision, except for guidance regarding subject recruitment, retention, and collection of 
research data.
d. Research Infrastructure
Part-time Study Directors and Research Assistants recruited subjects and performed on-site 
research assessments. All research personnel participated in training on goals and 
procedures. Subject attrition was minimized though (1) regular contact by the coordinating 
team with research staff to reinforce retention efforts and (2) a progressive reimbursement 
schedule for trial participants completing outcome assessments.
f. Trial Duration
Enrollment occurred between July 2010 and July 2012. Each subject was provided at least 
two years of treatment. There was no threshold for discontinuing patients, even after lengthy 
interruptions. Study assessments were suspended during periods of incarceration/
hospitalization, but resumed after release/discharge. Subjects could continue research 
assessments even if they discontinued NAVIGATE or Community Care treatment. The last 
subject who entered completed 2-years in July 2014.
g. Assessment Strategy and Measures
Well-trained interviewers using live, two-way, video conferencing performed diagnostic 
interviews and assessments of symptoms and quality of life. Remote assessment via two-
way video conferencing is comparable to face-to-face assessments in patient acceptability 
and reliability (22). Centralized assessors, who were masked to individual treatment 
assignments and overall study design, administered Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-
IV (SCID) (23) for diagnosis and duration of untreated psychosis; the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (24); the Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (25); the 
Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (26); and the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of 
Life Scale (27), our primary outcome measure. The Quality of Life Scale has 21-items rated 
from a semi-structured interview. It covers areas such as: sense of purpose, motivation, 
emotional and social interactions, role functioning and engagement in regular activities. The 
SCID was completed at baseline and one-year; other measures every six months.
Site Research Assistants interviewed participants monthly to complete the Service Use and 
Resource Form (28,29) to capture participation in work or school, inpatient, residential, 
emergency, and outpatient mental health and medical services in the previous month, as well 
as self-reported days of alcohol/drug use. The Service Use and Resource Form includes 
questions concerning four specific NAVIGATE interventions, allowing treatment groups to 
be compared on receipt of key services. Time remaining in treatment was defined as the time 
from randomization to the time of the last mental health service received based upon the 
Service Use and Resource Form assessments.
h. Data Analysis
The analysis of the primary outcome (Total Quality of Life score) compared treatments over 
two years (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). The analysis model was a three level mixed-
effects linear regression model with a linearized term for time, an interaction of treatment 
Kane et al.

 group by linearized time, and a random intercept and a random slope for linearized time at 
both patient and site levels. To enhance analysis interpretability, time was linearized through 
square root or logarithmic transformation because outcome plots over time for both 
treatment groups showed greater improvement in the earlier months leveling off in the later 
months. The group by linearized time interaction was tested to assess the difference between 
treatments in the rate of Quality of Life Scale improvement. Alpha level for the analysis of 
the total Quality of Life Scale score was preset at 0.05.
Clustered, randomized trials typically have a limited number of clusters potentially resulting 
in imbalance between treatment groups on baseline measures that may confound the 
relationship between treatments and patient-level outcomes. A generalized linear mixed-
effects regression model with a random effect (intercept) for site was used to identify 
baseline measures that were significantly different between the treatment groups. The 
identified baseline variables that were also significantly correlated with the Quality of Life 
Scale were included in the above model. The main effect of treatment would have been 
included had the baseline Quality of Life Scale been significantly different between the two 
treatment groups since the baseline Quality of Life Scale was modeled as part of the 
longitudinal response. A sensitivity analysis (available upon request) with no baseline 
covariate adjustment was also conducted based on the expectation of no significant baseline 
differences between treatment groups due to randomization.
In a further analysis, time was coded into dummy variables for categorical levels following 
baseline (6, 12, 18 and 24 months). An additional dummy variable for baseline time 
(time=0) would have been included had the baseline Quality of Life Scale been significantly 
different between the two treatment groups. Random effects for site and patient were also 
included. The same adjustment for potentially confounding baseline variables, as described 
above, was used. Interaction between treatment group and each of the dummy variables of 
time were tested to identify specific times at which there were significant differences 
between treatment groups.
In models with either linearized or categorical time the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 
was used to compare independent, first order autoregressive (AR1), and unstructured (UN) 
covariance structures for repeated measures. Analyses of secondary outcomes, using a 
comparable approach, were conducted on subscales of the Quality of Life Scale and on 
measures of symptoms (PANSS Total Score and five factors (30), the Clinical Global 
Impressions Severity Scale and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia). Service 
use analyses were based on a mixed-effects Poisson regression model with both site- and 
patient-level random effects. The same approach, as described above, was applied to the 
inclusion of baseline covariates and time transformation. We did not adjust for multiple 
comparisons in secondary outcomes analyses; such adjustment would risk increasing type II 
error which is of concern given the descriptive nature of the secondary analyses (31).
To evaluate the impact of duration of untreated psychosis as a moderator of treatment 
effectiveness, an additional fixed effect of duration of untreated psychosis (representing 
values below or above the median) and a three-way interaction of duration of untreated 
psychosis by linearized time and by a treatment indicator (referring to one of the treatment 
Kane et al.

 groups) were evaluated. This three-way interaction compared the slope of linearized time for 
patients in the indicated treatment group who were above and who were below the median 
duration of untreated psychosis. The median split approach was selected to maximize 
statistical power and optimize interpretability of findings. The moderating effect of duration 
of untreated psychosis was tested using the three-way interaction only after the significant 
difference in the rate of improvement between the two treatment groups was declared.
The two-year treatment effect-size was determined by the change from the baseline to two 
years using the estimates derived from the mixed model dividing by the pooled baseline 
standard deviation of the outcome measure -Cohen's d (32).
For each analysis, we checked the model assumptions and diagnostics including the 
normality assumption for random effects and the distribution of residuals.
Sample size calculations for mixed-effects linear regression analyses assumed that the intra 
class correlation (ICC) within subject would range from .30 to .60 and the ICC within site 
would be 0.10. With at least N=145 per group, even after attrition, the proposed design 
provided power in excess of 0.90 to detect an overall group difference and the difference in 
rate of change over time for a standardized effect size at the 24 month visit as small as 0.40 
standard deviation units (9 Quality of Life scale points).
Results
Participant Characteristics
NAVIGATE and Community Care groups included 223 and 181 patients, respectively. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The mean age was 
23 in both groups. The proportion of patients meeting schizophrenia-spectrum criteria were 
90% for Community Care and 89% for NAVIGATE; the proportions for schizophrenia were 
56% and 51%, respectively. Mean duration of untreated psychosis did not differ between 
groups; median duration was 74 weeks for both. Most patients (71% in both groups) lived 
with their families. Detailed descriptions of duration of untreated psychosis findings (33), 
baseline medication status/history (34) and baseline medical/metabolic measures (35) have 
been published elsewhere. NAVIGATE participants differed significantly from Community 
Care participants on four measures. NAVIGATE had significantly more males (77.6% vs. 
66.2%; p=0.05); a smaller proportion with prior hospitalization (76.3% vs. 81.6%; p<0.05), 
worse PANSS total scores (p<0.02), and fewer attending school at baseline (16.0% vs. 26%; 
p<0.02).
Main Outcomes
On a series of treatment validity measures, NAVIGATE participants were much more likely 
to endorse receipt of key services included in the experimental intervention than patients in 
Community Care (Figure 1; p<.0001 for each of the four services). Participants assigned to 
NAVIGATE remained in treatment longer than Community Care patients (median 23 months 
compared to 17 months, p<0.004; Supplemental Figure S2) and were more likely to have 
received mental health outpatient services each month than Community Care subjects (mean

 of 4.53 (standard deviation=5.07) versus 3.67 (standard deviation=5.93) services (t=2.49, 
p=0.013)).
On the primary outcome measure, Quality of Life Scale total score; NAVIGATE participants 
experienced significantly greater improvement over the two year assessment period than 
those in Community Care (group by time interaction, p<0.02; Figure 2 and Tables 2 and S1), 
with an effect size of 0.31 and of a clinically meaningful magnitude (36). More 
improvement was also found on the subscales “interpersonal relations,” “intrapsychic 
foundations (i.e. sense of purpose, motivation, curiosity, and emotional engagement), and 
engagement with “common objects and activities”. Service Use and Resource Form data 
showed significantly greater gains for NAVIGATE regarding the proportion of participants 
who were either working or going to school at any time during each month (group by time 
interaction p<0.05; Supplemental Figure 3).
NAVIGATE participants experienced greater improvement on PANSS total scores (p<0.02), 
the PANSS depressive factor (p<0.05), and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia 
(p<0.04) between baseline and 24 months. There were no significant group differences on 
the CGI.
The average rate of hospitalization was 3.2%/month for NAVIGATE and 3.7%/month for 
Community Care. Over the two years, 34% of the NAVIGATE group and 37% in the 
Community Care group (adjusted for length of exposure) had been hospitalized for 
psychiatric indications (p=NS).
Moderating Effect of Duration of Untreated Psychosis
Median duration of untreated psychosis was a significant moderator of the treatment effect 
on total Quality of Life Scale and PANSS scores over time (Figure 3; Supplemental Table 2). 
The difference in effect sizes comparing change between treatments with participants with 
duration of untreated psychosis ≤ 74 weeks and those with duration of untreated psychosis > 
74 weeks was substantial: 0.54 versus 0.07 for Quality of Life Scale and 0.42 versus 0.13 for 
PANSS scores.
Discussion
RAISE-ETP accomplished the primary goals of the NIMH RAISE initiative. We developed a 
comprehensive recovery-oriented, evidence-based intervention for first episode psychosis 
(20), trained over 100 community providers in early intervention principles and to deliver 
manual-based, coordinated specialty care, and successfully implemented the NAVIGATE 
model in 17 real world community clinics serving a racially and ethnically heterogeneous 
patient mix. NAVIGATE programs operated continuously between 2010 and 2014, 
demonstrating sustained model implementation. RAISE-ETP is the first multi-site, 
randomized, controlled trial of coordinated specialty care conducted in the United States, 
and the first anywhere to simultaneously include all of the following elements: randomized 
concurrent controls; masked assessment of primary and secondary outcomes; manual driven 
intervention with ongoing training and fidelity metrics. Most importantly, NAVIGATE 
improved outcomes for patients over 24 months; with effects seen on length of time in

 treatment, quality of life, participation in work and school, and symptoms - outcomes of 
importance to service users, family members, and clinicians.
Our results are likely to generalize to many U.S. community care settings that wish to 
implement specialty care teams for young persons with first episode psychosis. Insurance 
covered some NAVIGATE services (i.e., individual and family therapy, medication 
management), but supplements are needed to make first-episode services viable (37). 
Congress recently allocated additional funds to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) to subsidize first episode psychosis services not 
covered by insurance, like assertive outreach, care coordination, and supported employment/
education (38,39). Since 2014, 32 states have moved toward earlier intervention by 
combining SAMHSA funds with services reimbursed by public or private insurance, and in 
some cases with increased state funding for first episode psychosis programs.
Three multi-element treatment studies have been conducted outside the U.S., although only 
one (14,15) included exclusively first episode psychosis patients. The Lambeth Early Onset 
(LEO) study (12,13,40) randomly allocated 144 patients in London with a first or second 
psychotic episode to “specialist services” or “care as usual” for 18 months. Patients had a 
median age of 25, 24% were Caucasian, 58% were living with family. Data on duration of 
untreated psychosis were not provided. Individuals receiving specialist services had fewer 
readmissions (but were not less likely to have ever been readmitted or to have shorter 
admissions) and better social and vocational functioning, quality of life and medication 
adherence. At follow up, only 58% of participants had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 
schizotypal or delusional disorder.
In the Danish OPUS study (14,15) 547 first episode psychosis patients with <12 weeks 
exposure to antipsychotic medications were randomly assigned to “integrated” or “standard” 
treatment. The sample differed from ours in being 3 years older on average and with 78% 
living alone or with a partner. The only data reported on duration of untreated psychosis was 
a median of <50 weeks. At two-year follow up, the integrated treatment group was more 
likely to have remained in treatment and had significantly lower levels of psychotic and 
negative symptoms, but there was no difference in mean number of days spent in hospital. 
The proportion of patients hospitalized was 59% in year 1 and 26% in year 2 among patients 
receiving integrated care. With standard care, the respective rates were 71% and 39%. 
Differences were significant during year 1 but not during year 2. Of note, overall 
hospitalization rates in both groups were considerably higher than in our study. Patients in 
integrated care experienced significantly less substance misuse, better adherence and more 
satisfaction with care. Neither LEO nor OPUS included formal SEE, a robust evidence-
based practice, which emphasizes further that these studies are not identical.
Grawe et al (41) studied 50 patients with less than two years illness duration and most 
diagnosed schizophrenia, but not necessarily first episode. At two years, hospitalization rates 
were 33% in the enhanced intervention group and 50% among controls (difference not 
significant). Although individual outcomes did not differ, the percent of participants having a 
good outcome based upon a “Clinical Composite Index” was significantly higher in the 
intervention group (53% versus 25%).

 In the US, Srihari and colleagues (16) randomly assigned 120 first episode psychosis 
patients with <12 weeks antipsychotic medication exposure to the Specialized Treatment 
Early in Psychosis (STEP) program at an academic community mental health center or usual 
care in the community. The mean duration of untreated psychosis was 40 weeks. 
Assessments were not masked. After one year of participation, STEP compared with usual 
care recipients experienced significantly greater reductions in symptoms, required less 
inpatient care (hospitalization rates were 23% versus 44%), and were more likely to be 
working or going to school. Neither quality of life nor social functioning differed between 
treatments.
Given NAVIGATE's effect on treatment retention, quality of life, and symptom 
improvement, we expected a larger difference between treatment conditions in post-
enrollment hospitalization. However, the 34% rate for NAVIGATE is comparable to 
hospitalization rates for integrated treatment programs in the four prior multi-component 
first episode psychosis intervention studies (23%-59%). Post-enrollment hospitalization 
rates for standard care in these studies (44%-71%) were uniformly higher than that in 
Community Care (37%). All sites randomized to Community Care had expressed eagerness 
to participate in RAISE-ETP and had the staff, administrative support and desire to 
implement a coordinated specialty care program. Hence, Community Care sites may have 
had the motivation and resources available to serve clients with first episode psychosis, 
resulting in lower hospitalization rates compared to unselected community sites.
The observation that patients with shorter duration of untreated psychosis derived 
substantially more benefit from NAVIGATE is important. Prolonged duration of untreated 
psychosis is an issue of national importance; reducing duration of untreated psychosis from 
current levels of >1 year to the recommended standard of <3 months (42) should be a major 
focus of applied research efforts.
A key question is the sustained benefit of comprehensive specialty care programs. The long-
term OPUS trial outcomes suggest that the benefits of participation in a two-year intensive 
early intervention program do not persist in a five-year follow-up (43). It is also possible, as 
suggested by Linszen et al. (6), that the positive effects of intensive early treatment are only 
sustained when patients continue to receive specialized services. The length of time subjects 
were eligible to receive NAVIGATE services after the completion of 2 year period that is the 
focus of this report varied. An ongoing follow-up study will extend outcome assessment for 
a total of 5 years to provide information on longer-term effects and optimal treatment 
duration.
Conclusions
The RAISE-ETP study demonstrates that diverse U.S. community clinics can implement a 
team-based model of first episode psychosis care, producing greater improvement in clinical 
and functional outcomes as compared to standard care. These effects were more pronounced 
for those with shorter duration of untreated psychosis, suggesting that the receipt of 
appropriate first episode psychosis treatment at the proper time in the illness course can have 
a substantial impact on outcomes.
