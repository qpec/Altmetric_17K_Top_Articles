Abstract
Background: Several reports have confirmed that macrocyclic lactone-resistant isolates of Dirofilaria immitis are
circulating in the United States; however, the prevalence and potential impact of drug resistance is unknown. We
wished to assess computer-aided measurements of motility as a method for rapidly assessing the resistance status
of parasite isolates.
Methods: Blood containing microfilariae (MF) from two clinical cases with a high suspicion of resistance was fed to
mosquitoes and the resultant L3 injected into dogs that were then treated with six doses of Heartgard® Plus
(ivermectin + pyrantel; Merial Limited) at 30-day intervals. In both cases patent heartworm infections resulted
despite the preventive treatment. Microfilariae isolated from these dogs and other isolates of known resistance status
were exposed to varying concentrations of ivermectin in vitro and their motility assessed 24 h later using computer-
processed high-definition video imaging.
Results: We produced two isolates, Yazoo-2013 and Metairie-2014, which established patent infections despite Heartgard®
Plus treatments. Measurements of the motility of MF of these and other isolates (Missouri, MP3 and JYD-27) following
exposure to varying concentrations of ivermectin did not distinguish between susceptible and resistant heartworm
populations. There was some evidence that the method of MF isolation had an influence on the motility and drug
susceptibility of the MF.
Conclusions: We confirmed that drug-resistant heartworms are circulating in the southern United States, but that motility
measurements in the presence of ivermectin are not a reliable method for their detection. This implies that the drug does
not kill the microfilariae via paralysis.

 Background
Dirofilaria immitis, the canine heartworm, is one of the
most pathogenic parasitic helminths infecting small
companion animals [1]. Infection in domesticated dogs
and wild canids is widespread in the United States and
other parts of the world. In domestic dogs the disease
is prevented by prophylactic administration of one of
several macrocyclic lactone (ML) products approved
for this indication. These drugs have been shown to be
100% effective against the establishment of patent in-
fections and the occurrence of subsequent disease when
given in accordance with the manufacturers’ instruc-
tions [2–4]. The MLs are the only class of drug
currently used for heartworm prophylaxis. Reports sug-
gestive of drug failures (loss of efficacy), however, have
been accumulating for more than 10 years [5–7] and re-
cently the existence of resistant isolates of D. immitis has
been unequivocally confirmed by the establishment of pa-
tent infections under laboratory conditions despite the use
of appropriate ML treatments [8–11]. Most reports of
ML resistance in D. immitis have focused on the
Mississippi
Delta
region
of
the
southern
United
States, an area of very high parasite challenge, but we
do not know the frequency and geographic range of
resistant isolates, and so it is difficult to assess the
potential impact they might have on canine and feline
health [2, 11]. In large part this is because the con-
firmation of drug resistance in heartworms is time-
consuming and expensive. The in vivo microfilarial
suppression test proposed by Geary et al. [12] appears
to be useful, but there is still a need for a properly
validated in vitro test for resistance. Evans et al. used
a larval migration inhibition assay to measure the
susceptibility of D. immitis L3 to MLs [13], but the
concentrations of drug needed to prevent migration
were much higher than those to which the larvae
would be exposed to in vivo and the assay does not
seem to be able to distinguish resistant from suscep-
tible isolates [14]. Bourguinat et al. [5, 6, 15] used
observations of microfilaria (MF) motility in a single
concentration of ivermectin, described as twice the IC95,
to assess the susceptibility and resistance of some candi-
date ML-resistant isolates. The derivation of the IC95,
however, was by extrapolation from a limited number of
observations at lower drug concentrations and the assays
were dependent on visual observation and assessment of
motility by an expert technician, which would limit the
wider usefulness of the method.
The MLs are most effective against the infecting
L3/L4 stage of the parasite life cycle, with clearance
of circulating MF and any effects on the adult worms
requiring
much
higher
drug
concentrations
[16].
Microfilariae are by far the most convenient stage of
the life cycle to use in any resistance assay, however,
because they can be easily obtained from infected ani-
mals using noninvasive methods.
Recently, we reported the application of computer-
processed high-definition video imaging (the ‘Wormina-
tor’) to measuring the motility of MF from D. immitis
and Brugia malayi [17]. In this study, we evaluated the
suitability of such methods for assessing the drug resist-
ance status of several D. immitis isolates of known re-
sistance status. Such experiments required the isolation
and characterization of some new resistant isolates,
Yazoo-2013 and Metairie-2014, and a description of
these isolates is provided in this article.
Methods
Isolation of Yazoo-2013 and Metaririe-2014
Male purpose-bred beagles were purchased from Covance
Inc. (Princeton, NJ, USA) with no previous exposure to
macrocyclic lactones. Dogs were infected by subcutaneous
injection of D. immitis L3. Thirty days after inoculation of
D. immitis L3, dogs were administered Heartgard® Plus
(ivermectin + pyrantel; Merial Limited) according to man-
ufacturer’s recommendations. A total of six monthly treat-
ments
of
Heartgard®
Plus
were
administered
every
30 days. Microfilariae concentrations were determined
using thick smears as described [18].
Yazoo-2013
Yazoo-2013 was isolated from a 2-year-old intact male Do-
berman pinscher that resided in Yazoo City, Mississippi,
USA. Trifexis® (milbemycin oxime + spinosad; Elanco) was
administered at a weight-appropriate dose beginning at
8 months of age. Per preventive heartworm treatment stan-
dards, this dog was heartworm negative when Trifexis® was
first given in September 2011 and remained so for another
test in July 2012. The owner purchase history verified that
drug was purchased monthly through July 2013, when the
dog tested antigen and MF positive. The owner was consid-
ered highly compliant and attentive to treatment by the at-
tending veterinarian, and reported that the dog took the
drug tablet willingly every month and did not vomit after
administration. The same day the dog tested positive,
Trifexis® was administered to prevent transmission before
beginning adulticidal treatment, and blood was sent to the
University of Georgia 30 days later for feeding to mosqui-
toes. This produced 100 L3, which were evenly divided and
injected
subcutaneously
into
two
male
purpose-bred
beagles. Thirty days after infection with L3 each dog was
administered Heartgard® Plus according to weight. Admin-
istration of Heartgard® Plus was repeated every 30 days for
a total of 6 months after infection. One month after the
final administration of Heartgard® Plus, blood was drawn to
perform thick smears and an IDEXX SNAP® test to detect
MF and heartworm antigen, respectively. Both dogs were
MF and antigen positive 7 months after they were infected.

 Microfilaremia increased in both dogs for several months,
peaking at 3675 microfilariae per milliliter (MF/mL) in Dog
1 (Yazoo-2013.1) at 411 days post infection and 5925 MF/
mL in Dog 2 at 348 days post infection (Table 1). Microfi-
laremic blood from Dog 2 was used to feed mosquitoes to
produce 32 L3 that were injected into a third dog. This in-
fection was not challenged with ML treatment and is
known as Yazoo-2013.2.
Metairie-2014
The Metairie-2014 isolate was obtained from a 13-year-
old spayed female English retriever that resided in Met-
airie, Louisiana and traveled to Mississippi for hunting
trips. The owner had a perfect purchase record of heart-
worm preventives. This dog became heartworm positive
while on Trifexis® in March 2011 but was treated with
melarsomine and doxycycline and was amicrofilaremic
and antigen negative by the end of the year. Trifexis®
was used from December 2013 through June 2014, when
the dog tested heartworm antigen and MF positive again.
Microfilaremic blood was sent to the University of
Georgia and fed to mosquitoes, producing five L3 that
were injected subcutaneously into a 2-year-old male
purpose-bred mongrel dog. A second blood sample was
sent 2 weeks later and fed to mosquitoes, yielding an
additional 95 L3 that were injected into the same dog
9 days after the first five. Thirty days after all L3 had
been introduced, Heartgard® Plus was administered ac-
cording to weight. Drug treatment was repeated every
30 days for the 6 months following infection. Following
the final drug administration, blood was drawn monthly
to perform a thick smear to detect MF, which were first
detected 7 months after infection. Heartworm antigen
was detected by IDEXX SNAP® test in March 2015. Al-
though no SNAP test was performed in February, due to
the presence of MF it is reasonable to assume that the
dog was also antigen positive. Microfilaremia rose stead-
ily from days 215 to 847 post infection, peaking at
75,500 MF/mL of blood (Table 1).
Isolation of MF from canine blood
Microfilariae were isolated from canine blood by two
methods. The first is the standard Filariasis Research Re-
agent Resource Center (FR3) protocol first developed by
Sawyer and Weinstein [19]. Canine blood in heparinized
tubes was diluted 1:11 with 0.2% saponin in 0.85% NaCl to
lyse red blood cells (RBC). Tubes were shaken several times
to mix blood and saponin before being placed in a 38 °C
water bath for approximately 30 min; tubes were shaken
again halfway through incubation. Tubes were centrifuged
for 15 min at 2500 RPM, and supernatant was discarded be-
fore washing MF twice with PBS. The PBS supernatant was
removed and replaced with pre-warmed RPMI 1640 with
L-glutamine containing 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (P/
S). Microfilariae were placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5%
CO2 for approximately 30 min before being counted.
The second method was developed by Franks and Stoll
[20] and has been modified for use in our laboratory.
Canine blood in heparinized tubes was centrifuged for
30 min at 2500 RPM before removing the top layer con-
taining plasma and white blood cells. A 4:1 solution of
3.8% saline-citrate was added to bring the tube up to its
original volume, and 1 mL of 15% (w/v) saponin was
added for every 15 mL of blood. Tubes were shaken vig-
orously for 30 s before being centrifuged for 30 min at
2500 RPM. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet
containing MF was washed twice with saline-citrate so-
lution to remove any remaining RBC. Microfilariae were
washed once with PBS before a final centrifugation for
4 min at 2500 RPM. The PBS supernatant was removed
and replaced with pre-warmed RPMI 1640 with L-
glutamine
containing
1%
P/S.
Microfilariae
were
placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for approxi-
mately 30 min before being counted. Microfilariae
were diluted or concentrated to 4 to 5 MF/μL for the
Metairie and Yazoo 2013–2.1 strains and to 2 MF/μL
for the Yazoo 2013–1 strain.
Motility assays
The motility of the MF after 24 h in culture was assayed
as described by Storey et al. [17], except that a heated

 stage top incubator (Tokai Hit model WSKM, Tokai Co.
Ltd., Japan) was added to the microscope to maintain
plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 while they were being ana-
lyzed. Concentration-dependent inhibition of motility by
ivermectin was assayed and analyzed as previously de-
scribed [17]. In all cases, experiments were carried out
in triplicate (n = 4–5).
Results
Motility of MF from ML-susceptible and resistant isolates
and the effect of ivermectin
The motility of MF from these resistant isolates, plus the
ML-resistant JYD and ‘less-susceptible’ MP3 [21, 22]
was compared with that of the susceptible Missouri
strain (Fig. 1) using the Worminator system [17]. There
was no significant difference in the motility of Yazoo-
2013.1 and Yazoo-2013.2 compared with Missouri, while
Metairie was significantly more motile in the absence of
any drug (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, non-repeated
measures) than all other strains.
The effects of incubation with ivermectin on the motility
of the isolated MF from the various isolates was measured
(Fig. 2). Incubation of Missouri and MP3 MF in the pres-
ence of ivermectin for 24 h (1 nM to 50 μM) showed a
concentration-dependent inhibition of motility with appar-
ent IC50 values of 8.4 ± 1.6 μM and 5.8 ± 1.3 μM, respect-
ively (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Despite similar baseline motility,
differences between the passages of Yazoo-2013 in the pres-
ence of ivermectin were noted; the Yazoo-2013.1 MF
showed a concentration-dependent reduction in motility
(IC50 = 3.5 ± 1.6 μM) while Yazoo 2013.2 MF did not (Table
2 and Fig. 2). Metairie-2014 MF remained more motile
than the other isolates in all drug concentrations, but also
showed a concentration-dependent reduction in motility
(IC50 = 8.1 ± 1.3 μM). The reduction in motility never
exceeded 50% for any isolate, even at the maximum con-
centration we used (50 μM). The JYD MF showed no re-
duction in motility when incubated with ivermectin.
The inconsistencies observed with the results ob-
tained with different resistant isolates, and between dif-
ferent passages of the same isolate, prompted the
examination of the effects of the purification method
on the motility and apparent drug sensitivity of the MF.
Microfilariae from two resistant isolates were used,
Yazoo-2013.1 and Metairie-2014, which exhibited a
concentration-dependent inhibition of motility, and the
effects of our standard ‘saponin’ purification procedure
were compared with those of an alternative sodium cit-
rate- based procedure. No effects of the purification
procedure were observed on the motility of the MF in
the absence of the drug. A marked difference, however,
was seen in the effects of incubation with ivermectin
on the Metairie-2014 MF; there was no inhibition of
motility at any concentration (Fig. 3). The purification
method had no effect, however, on the response of the
Yazoo-2013.1 MF to the drug (Fig. 3).

 Discussion
Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration Center
for Veterinary Medicine requires heartworm preventives
to be 100% effective in preventing infection in order to
be approved and licensed for use [7]. As described
above, both Yazoo-2013 and Metairie-2014 isolates were
able to establish patent infections in experimentally in-
fected dogs despite six monthly drug challenges, un-
equivocally confirming their resistance to ML and that
such parasites are in circulation in the United States
[8, 9, 23]. Because considerable uncertainty remains
about the current prevalence and the future impact of
ML-resistant heartworms [2, 11, 12, 24], there is a major
research need to develop a rapid, reproducible, and rea-
sonably inexpensive assay to monitor the baseline preva-
lence and geographic spread of such biotypes. In vitro
assays for anthelmintic resistance typically use a surro-
gate life-stage, rather than that which is the target of the
drug treatments, and many assays, including some for
ML resistance, use motility or an aspect of motility, such
as migration, as a phenotypic read-out [25, 26]. We have
previously described the use of a migration inhibition
assay to measure the effects of MLs on D. immitis [13]
and of high definition video recordings to do the same
for MF [17]. Because the MF are much easier to obtain
than L3, for future field application, we chose to exam-
ine the possibility of developing an assay for ML resist-
ance using this life-stage.
The results were somewhat confusing. In the initial
studies, MF from one resistant isolate, JYD, predictably
showed no concentration-dependent inhibition of move-
ment; however, another isolate, Metairie-2014, did. The
results with the third resistant isolate, Yazoo-2013, were
even more confusing, with the MF from passage 2
showing no ML-dependent inhibition, while those from
passage 1 did. The IC50 values for Metairie-2014 and
Yazoo-2013 were similar, in fact lower, than those for
the two susceptible isolates, Missouri and MP3, indicat-
ing that there were no significant quantitative differences
between the resistant and susceptible isolates in their
response to ivermectin in this assay. All of the dose–
response curves we obtained were similar to those previ-
ously reported [17] and confirm that much higher
concentrations of drug are required to inhibit larval
movement in vitro than are effective in vivo [27]. The
difference in the numerical values of the IC50 reflects a
difference in the calculation method. In our previous
paper, the maximum value for inhibition was con-
strained to 100%, but because we never observed inhib-
ition close to this in these experiments this constraint
was not applied to the curves presented here. It is pos-
sible that using a drug other than ivermectin may work
slightly better, as the use of eprinomectin seemed to
work better than ivermectin in the L3 migration assay
[13] and doramectin inhibits MF movement more ro-
bustly than ivermectin [17]. Cost considerations and
solubility probably preclude the use of doramectin in a
routine assay, however, and the discrepancy in concen-
tration required for effects in vitro and in vivo remains.
Eprinomectin also fails to distinguish between suscep-
tible and resistant L3 in the LMIA [14].
An additional confounding factor was revealed by
varying the purification method use to obtain the MF.
Our standard protocol is based on that described by
Sawyer and Weinstein [19]; when we compared the re-
sults with MF purified with this method with those puri-
fied by the method of Franks and Stoll [20], the
apparent phenotype of the Metairie-2014 isolate changed
from ‘susceptible’ to ‘resistant.’ We do not know the rea-
son for this change, but one speculation is that the MF
isolated via the ‘saponin’ method [19] may be slightly
more damaged than those isolated via the ‘citrate’
method [20], and this may allow the drug to have a
greater effect. The fact that the purification method only
affected Metairie-2014 but not Yazoo-2013.2 might point
to differences in the physical robustness of the two iso-
lates, but this possibility needs further investigation.
Overall, our data suggest that simple motility measure-
ments on MF are unlikely to form the basis of a robust
assay for ML resistance in heartworm. This may not be

 surprising, as the glutamate-gated chloride channels that
are the molecular targets of the drugs [28–30] have
multiple roles in many other nematode species and do not
appear to be expressed in the motor nervous system of
MF [31]. Taken together with evidence suggesting that the
anti-MF effect of the MLs may require a contribution
from the host immune system [27, 32], our results indicate
that motility of MF is not a reliable phenotype for detect-
ing resistance in D. immitis. This likely reflects the fact
that the drug concentrations experienced by the parasites
in the host are several orders of magnitude lower than
those required to inhibit motility in vitro. Thus, it would
seem that inhibition of motility is not a mechanism of
action for the ML drugs against D. immitis and thus is un-
likely to be a mechanism of resistance. Data from this
study indicate that for the moment an in vivo assay for re-
sistance such as the microfilarial suppression test [12]
may be the most useful means of determining whether
resistance is present in a suspect case.
