The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) posits a neuron-centric, linear cascade initi-
ated by Ab and leading to dementia. This direct causality is incompatible with clinical observations.
We review evidence supporting a long, complex cellular phase consisting of feedback and feedfor-
ward responses of astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. The field must incorporate this holistic
view and take advantage of advances in single-cell approaches to resolve the critical junctures
at which perturbations initially amenable to compensatory feedback transform into irreversible,
progressive neurodegeneration.
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) impairs cognition, memory, and lan-
guage and causes dementia. In 1907, Aloı
¨s Alzheimer described
the extensive distribution of neuronal tangles and amyloid pla-
ques in brain that, together with astrogliosis, neuronal dystrophy,
neuronal loss, and vascular alterations, constitute the hallmarks
of the disorder.
For over 20 years, the ‘‘amyloid cascade hypothesis’’ has pro-
vided the main theoretical construct for AD (Hardy and Selkoe,
2002). It proposes amyloid plaques or their major constituents,
the Ab-peptides, as the direct cause of the progressive neurode-
generation. The concept that a biochemical/biophysical process
underlies the complex cognitive alterations has transformed AD
research, replacing earlier descriptive studies with a molecular,
mechanistic view. This has led to diagnostic and therapeutic
trials for a disease believed before to be either incurable or an
inevitable consequence of aging. The tremendous increase in
knowledge on the molecular biology, pathophysiology, and diag-
nosis of AD is exciting and holds promise for future prevention
and therapies but also starts to erode the assumptions of its
main theoretical foundation.
To understand the disease, the well-studied biochemistry
needs to be integrated into the complex cellular context of the
brain. We examine here how a failing vascular system contrib-
utes to disease progression; how inhibitory and excitatory
neurons, neuronal networks, microglia, astroglia, and, finally,
oligodendrocytes all contribute to a complex cellular phase of
the disease evolving over decades, and how initial benign reac-
tions ultimately become chronic, resulting in an irreversible dys-
homeostasis of the brain. Emerging approaches could provide
us with a more holistic understanding of the spatial, temporal,
and cellular aspects of the disease process. We start with a brief
critique of the amyloid cascade hypothesis itself.
The Amyloid Hypothesis
The amyloid hypothesis for AD is a neuron-centric, linear, and
quantitative model postulating direct cause and consequences
in a cascade initiated by Ab deposition and leading progressively
to Tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction, inflammation, neuronal
loss, and, ultimately, dementia.
The linearity of the cascade remains very controversial. For
instance, exploration of the direct link between Ab and neurotox-
icity has resulted in a rather confusing literature with at least ten
different molecular mechanisms and receptors (see Figure 1)
(Benilova et al., 2012). It is debatable whether they all equally
contribute to the disease process in humans, as many of the sup-
porting studies used non-physiologically high concentrations of
Ab or transgenic mice significantly overexpressing APP (see
Nilsson et al., 2014). However, an alternative explanation for
the richness of these findings is that different mechanisms or
even the same mechanism exert multiple effects at different
stages of disease progression. For instance, the interaction of
Ab with the receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE) causes oxidative stress in neurons but enhances inflam-
matory responses in microglia and is involved in endothelial cells
in ‘‘reversed’’ transport of Ab across the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) (Deane et al., 2012). Thus, the neuron-centric view has
to be expanded to one that considers the contribution of different
cell types, their interactions with each other, and the gradual
evolution of the disease.
Preclinical or prodromal AD stages have been defined by clini-
cians to underscore the concept that AD starts insidiously many
decades before full dementia becomes apparent (Carrillo et al.,
2013; Dubois et al., 2014). The amyloid cascade hypothesis pro-
vides no explanation for the silent incubation period of AD. Even
in familial AD (FAD), where the role of Ab is established because
of causative mutations in APP and Presenilin, the amyloid hy-
pothesis is found wanting. Why, for instance, does abnormal
Ab production, already present from conception, manifest its
toxicity only in midlife? Clearly the complex compensation
mechanisms in the brain that maintain almost normal cognitive
performance for decades should be accommodated into any
theoretical construct of the disease. In our view, AD only starts
when a pathological cellular reaction is initiated.

 The quantitative aspects of the hypothesis (the concept that
more amyloid plaques, or, in more recent versions, more Ab42,
is causing disease) imply that quantitative lowering of Ab-pla-
ques or Ab-oligomers should be sufficient to halt progression
of AD (critically discussed in Karran et al., 2011). The discrep-
ancy between amyloid load and disease symptoms in sporadic
AD (SAD) has, however, been pointed out in the past: ‘‘it seems
as if the Ab plaques appear at the wrong time and in the wrong
places with respect to the clinical dementia’’ (Mesulam, 1999).
Less appreciated is the fact that the quantitative concept is
equally not tenable for FAD. Most Presenilin (PSEN1) mutations
do not increase Ab generation. PSEN1 is part of the g-secretase
complex, and mutations affect mainly the ‘‘trimming’’ function of
these proteases whereby the C-terminal region of long Ab is
progressively cleaved. The mutations might destabilize the
three-dimensional structure of the g-secretases, which might
explain the premature release of longer (insufficiently ‘‘trimmed’’)
hydrophobic Ab42, Ab43, and, hypothetically, Ab>43, peptides
(Cha
´ vez-Gutie
´ rrez et al., 2012; Szaruga et al., 2015; Saito
et al., 2011). In this view, even lowering of total Ab could still
be pathogenic if the Ab produced is longer than Ab40. Such
long Ab, even in low amounts, could provide seeds for further
nucleation and amyloidosis. Thus, in contrast to what is
assumed in the amyloid hypothesis, the pathological effects of
the PSEN1 mutations on Ab production are qualitative and not
quantitative (Kuperstein et al., 2010; Szaruga et al., 2015).
Figure 1. Ab Receptors and Ab Toxicity Mechanisms
All membrane receptors implied in Ab pathogenic mechanisms are indicated. Some receptors are only indirectly affected by Ab, inferred by physiological
alterations of cells exposed to Ab. The second series are receptors shown to directly bind Ab (see Benilova et al., 2012).

 The Biochemical Phase in AD Causes Proteostatic
Stress and Homeostatic Cellular Responses
The ‘‘biochemical phase’’ of AD is characterized by abnormal
aggregation of Ab and potentially abnormal processing of APP;
formation of Tau conformers followed by hyper phosphorylation;
the seeding and propagation in a prionoid fashion of these
abnormally folded proteins (Walker and Jucker, 2015); the gener-
ation of oligomeric amyloids (Abo- and Tau-oligomers); and the
generation of amyloid plaques and neuronal tangles. The
different conformations of Ab and Tau exert ‘‘proteopathic’’ or
‘‘aggregrate’’ stress on different cells of the brain, i.e., they
interact with proteins and membranes and interfere with
signaling and other functions. They also bind APP and Tau,
which disturbs the normal activities of these proteins in neuro-
transmission (Palop and Mucke, 2010). The temporal sequence
of these events is undefined. Age-related deficiencies of the pro-
teostatic network could cause accumulation of aggregating pro-
teins; conversely, protein aggregates might disturb the complex
cellular molecular network that sustains protein folding (Labba-
dia and Morimoto, 2015). The lysosomal/endolysosomal system
and, in particular, autophagy is a key regulator of this proteo-
pathic stage (Nixon, 2013). In AD brains, a striking increase in
classic autophagosomes, featuring a double membrane that en-
capsulates heterogenous intracellular components, is seen in an
early stage of the disorder (Nixon, 2013). Deletion of key macro-
autophagy components such as ATG5 or ATG7 in neurons in
mice causes motor deficits, ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions,
and neurodegeneration (Komatsu et al., 2006). In Niemann-
Pick’s disease type C, loss of function of the NPC1 or NPC2
genes leads to late endosomal/lysosomal accumulation of lipids
and defective autophagocytosis (Elrick et al., 2012). Affected
neurons display tau inclusions that are indistinguishable from
those in AD. Thus, abnormalities in autophagy are linked to tau
pathology. The genetic support for a role of autophagy in AD
compared to Parkinson disease, for example, remains surpris-
ingly limited, however (Lambert et al., 2013)
None of the initial effects of proteopathy should be considered
overwhelming or irreversible, as brain cells can apparently
survive this stress for many years. The elicited responses are
physiological and can be cell or non-cell autonomous. They
can be biochemical, maintaining homeostasis in the proteostatic
network (Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015), or functional, involving
various synaptic plasticity mechanisms in which astroglia may
play crucial roles. Inflammatory responses contribute initially to
sustaining homeostasis. It is only when these compensating
mechanisms turn into chronic, irreversible, and pathological pro-
cesses that disease progresses inexorably. The transition of an
early reversible to a chronic, irreversible, autonomous cellular
response, likely no longer dependent on the initial Ab and Tau
aggregate stressors, represents a critical phase in the disease
process.
The separate locations of Tau and amyloid pathology and their
natural progression in the brain (Braak and Braak, 1995; Thal
et al., 2002) suggest that the two biochemical pathologies prog-
ress relatively independently from each other (Mesulam, 1999;
Small and Duff, 2008). Tangles are universally found in all aged
people and are already present early in life (Braak and Del Tre-
dici, 2011). This primary age-related tauopathy or PART (Crary
et al., 2014) is mild. The effects of age-associated Ab accumula-
tion are initially also mild—they are found in many aged people
without causing clinical symptoms of brain dysfunction. Ab
stress might enhance the progression of Tau pathology (Khan
et al., 2014), but described molecular links are multiple and indi-
rect. Alternatively, Ab-stress and PART could be considered in-
dependent stressors that each cause a slowly evolving, relatively
benign, age-related neurodegenerative process with no or only
mild symptomatology. Only when they come together and recip-
rocally augment their deleterious effects is a more aggressive
disease manifested with multiple cellular effects. Even in pure
FAD, this scenario is conceivable: the abnormal Ab generated
by the mutations becomes only part of a disease process
when the ‘‘natural’’ process of progressive accumulation of neu-
rofibrillar tangles has reached a threshold and both pathologies
start to interact. The rather stereotypical evolution of the disease
is compatible with this view (Karran et al., 2011).
In the current Review, we try to go beyond the discussion—
which is nevertheless important—of the biochemistry and
toxicity of Ab and Tau (De Strooper, 2010). We see AD as a com-
plex process consisting of different interacting phases encom-
passing feedback and feedforward mechanisms between cells,
which, after many years, lead to dementia. Most importantly, in
this view, Ab and Tau accumulations in SAD are considered
risk factors—i.e., even if their accumulation is a sign of increased
proteopathic stress, additional cellular factors are determinative
in the evolution toward dementia. Instead of Ab and Tau, the real
causes of sporadic disease are upstream of these proteopathies
and are likely manifold, with aging being the major driver. Never-
theless, the proteopathic stress of the biochemical phase results
in the cellular phase of AD. The clinical phase of the disease is
initiated when the cellular reaction can no longer maintain ho-
meostasis (Figure 2).
Defective Clearance Mechanisms Are Part of the Initial
Cellular Phase
Defective clearance of Ab (and Tau), considered to underlie the
majority of sporadic AD cases, illustrates the complexity of the
cellular response. Many proteases can break down Ab peptides
in the biochemical phase (Figure 2) (De Strooper, 2010), but, as
shown by injecting labeled Ab or Tau in the brain parenchyma
and following its elimination (Iliff et al., 2014), it is now clear
that a large part of normal Ab turnover depends on bulk flow
via the perivascular circulation and the glymphatic system in
the brain (Tarasoff-Conway et al., 2015). Genetic risk associated
with APOE4, PICALM, and APOJ (or CLU) is thought to affect Ab
clearance (Verghese et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015).
The cellular component of the clearance system is complex.
The BBB consists of tightly connected endothelial cells and as-
troglia end-feet. Pericytes and smooth muscle cells provide con-
tractile elements. The glia barrier is relatively open because of
gap junctions allowing passage of Ab and Tau. The endothelial
barrier is, however, not permeable, and therefore, specialized
transport proteins (receptors of the LDL receptor family, e.g.,
LRP1&2, RAGE, ABC transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein,
ABCA1, and Ab free or bound to proteins such as a2-macroglob-
ulin, APOJ, or APOE particles) are responsible for Ab (and Tau)
egress to the circulation. For instance, heterozygote Picalm+/�

 mice show decreased LRP1-mediated clearance of Ab via the
BBB. Although neurons with downregulated Picalm produce
less Ab, accelerated amyloidosis and worsening in behavioral
parameters is seen in these mice: this could be rescued via
adenoviral expression of PICALM in the endothelium (Zhao
et al., 2015). PICALM proteolysis has also been associated
with Tau-tangle formation and disturbed endocytosis in SAD
(Ando et al., 2013). The multifactorial effects of genes involved
in AD are a recurrent theme in this Review and illustrate the
importance of placing the biochemical process into the context
of the cellular phase.
In contrast to Ab, much less is known regarding Tau clearance.
Previously, Tau pathology was seen as a cell-autonomous phe-
nomenon, and studies of Tau clearance were predominantly
focused on intracellular processes such as autophagy. However,
Tau pathology can progress through the brain in a prion-like
Figure 2. The Biochemical, Cellular, and Clinical Phases of AD
The transition of biochemical to cellular and cellular to clinical phases are indicated. The cellular phase is complex and evolves gradually over two decades from
reversible physiological reactions upon proteopathic stress to irreversible immune and electrophysiological compensation mechanisms that disturb the normal
homeostasis of the brain. The effects are cell and non-cell autonomous and occur in the context of neurovascular or glioneuronal units (see main text). Processes
are derived from GWAS studies (clearance dysfunction, lipid metabolism, immune response, protein trafficking) and are indicated in different colors. Genes are in
italics when genetic evidence links them to AD. Other genes (LRP1, RAGE and others) are functionally implicated in the disease process. Each gene is associated
to a color code indicating the pathways in which they operate. The picture is a late self-portrait from the German painter William Utermohlen, who suffered from
AD. Image courtesy of Chris Boı

 fashion (Walker and Jucker, 2015), and Tau is secreted after
increased electrical activity (Yamada et al., 2014). Some
secreted Tau is cleared by the glymphatic flow (Iliff et al.,
2014); thus, it is reasonable to predict that Tau gets cleared
from the brain via similar cell-regulated bulk flow pathways
as Ab. However, the role of the vasculature in AD goes far
beyond clearance.
The Neurovascular Unit and the Vascular Hypothesis
for AD
The term ‘‘neurovascular unit’’ is used to describe the close
anatomic and functional interrelationship between the cellular
components of the brain. The vascular hypothesis proposes
that initial vascular damage precipitates AD. Hypoperfusion
and hypoxia are one aspect of the problem, but the associated
breakdown of the BBB also results in accumulation of neuro-
toxic serum proteins in brain, inflammation, vascular, and syn-
aptic dysfunction that lead secondarily to defects in Ab and Tau
metabolism and clearance, which in turn cause vascular prob-
lems such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Zlokovic,
2011). CAA is caused by widespread deposition of Ab in the
vasculature, resulting in fibrinoid necrosis, microaneurysms,
and bleedings. Co-existence of AD and vascular pathology in-
creases the risk for dementia considerably (Attems and Jellin-
ger, 2014).
Many functional studies support the central postulate of the
vascular hypothesis—i.e., the primacy of vascular lesions in
driving the AD phenotype (Zlokovic, 2011). Mice that express
the major genetic risk factor for AD, human APOE4 (on a
mouse ApoE�/� background), show a curious degenerative
response of endothelial cells and pericytes mediated by cyclo-
phylin A and NFkb that leads to damage of the BBB (Bell et al.,
2012), which is also seen in human APOE4 carriers. Other ge-
netic manipulations of receptors, transporters, and cells sup-
port the idea that early alterations in the BBB could play a
major role in the initiation of AD. For example, AD patients
typically display diminished glucose uptake in the brain as
measured by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emis-
sion tomography (FDG-PET) (Protas et al., 2013). Interestingly,
heterozygous deficiency of GLUT1 (Slc2a1+/�) in endothelium
accelerated degenerative changes in the APPsw mouse model
for AD (Winkler et al., 2015). Degeneration of pericytes or
vascular smooth muscle cells under hypoxic stress also leads
to neurodegeneration and Ab clearance problems (Winkler
et al., 2014), suggesting that atherosclerosis and hypoperfusion
of the brain might be an upstream cause in a subgroup of pa-
tients. In models of traumatic brain injury, the clearance flow is
slowed down, which might contribute to accumulation of
secreted Tau (Iliff et al., 2014). Sleep increases, and aging
and/or stiffening of the arterial wall slows down the glymphatic
clearance flow (Tarasoff-Conway et al., 2015). While it seems
that vascular defects lead to amyloid accumulation, it may
also be the case that Ab accumulation can lead to vascular
defects as seen with some clinical APP mutations that manifest
as CAA. Thus, Ab is both cause and consequence of vascular
pathology, and this destructive cycle is an important part
of the cellular action and reaction that underlies the cellular
phase of AD.
Neurons and Neuronal Circuitry as Part of the Cellular
Phase of AD
In the prevailing neuron-centric view, dysfunction of the brain is
mediated by decrements in synaptic plasticity: e.g., long-term
potentiation and depression, changes in homeostatic scaling,
and disruption of neuronal connectivity. These alterations are
currently often studied by recording synaptic function in
neuronal cell and hippocampal slice models treated with Ab pep-
tides, either synthetically generated, isolated from ‘‘natural’’
brain material, or expressed in transgenic mouse models. These
models are too acute to mimic the progressive cellular disruption
that occurs in AD brains over many years.
The complexity of how neurons are progressively affected by
Ab stress has been addressed by a few groups. In a series of
landmark publications, Palop and Mucke studied how Ab stress
results in excitatory, (non-convulsive) seizure activity in neuronal
networks (Palop and Mucke, 2010). The study nicely illustrates
how work in preclinical animal models can translate into novel in-
sights relevant to human pathogenesis: epileptic seizures and
neuronal hyperexcitability in AD patients became a recognized
part of the condition (Bakker et al., 2012). To explain the unex-
pected hyper-reactivity, they looked to cellular alterations and
found loss of calbindin expression and ectopic expression of
the inhibitory neuropeptide Y (NPY) in granule cells and mossy
fibers, and GABAergic synaptic sprouting in the molecular layer
emanating from NPY- and somatostatin positive interneurons.
They also found a reduction in the voltage-gated sodium channel
subunit Nav1.1 in parvalbumin cells, leading to defective inhibi-
tory input that could be rectified by restoring channel expression
(Verret et al., 2012). Their data suggest that increased Ab stress
in AD leads to a complex pattern of neuronal actions and
reactions, causing aberrant excitatory network activity and
compensatory inhibitory responses involving learning and mem-
ory circuitry (Palop and Mucke, 2010). These fascinating studies
are but a first step to address the complex cellular processes in
AD. For example, recent work suggests that reactive astroglia in
these mice secrete GABA, which paradoxically could contribute
to seizure-like activity by suppressing inhibitory input on excit-
atory circuitry (Jo et al., 2014).
Other mouse models also show that the neuronal reaction to
Tau and Ab proteopathic stress is complex and not just simple
cell death. Pyramidal cells in the frontal cortex show phases of
hypo- and/or hyperexcitability in Tau and Ab mouse models
(Menkes-Caspi et al., 2015). Oscillatory network activity is
altered in many AD models. Finally, the activity of hippocampal
place cells that normally show a robust relation to animal loca-
tion in the environment lose spatial selectivity in AD mice
(Cheng and Ji, 2013). Importantly, the recorded alterations
are likely due to a mixture of direct and indirect effects of Ab
on neurons and glial cells, synaptic dysfunctions that impact
local network activity, and afferent activity in downstream tar-
gets and compensatory mechanisms. Disease progression
likely entails an initial localized and acute direct or indirect
effect of Ab species on cell and synaptic function, where
distinct cell types may have a varying degree of sensitivity.
The early local changes in network activity patterns would
then progressively affect connected brain structures, followed
by the spread of pathology.

 An important caveat is that functional disturbances in mice
are typically occurring in the absence of severe tangle forma-
tion and neuronal loss that characterizes AD dementia. Some
investigators therefore severely doubt the validity of mouse
experiments: a more moderate and constructive view is that
the alterations in these mice recapitulate early alterations
occurring in incipient AD brain (Zahs and Ashe, 2010). In that
sense, they are very relevant to the study of the early cellular
phase of AD.
Morphological and biochemical studies of human brain mate-
rial are limited to evolved stages of the disease. However, they
too demonstrate the complex cellular phase in AD. Loss of inner-
vation by the entorhinal cortex (EC) of the outer molecular layer of
the dentate gyrus is associated with extensive sprouting of
cholinergic innervation (Mufson et al., 2015). Loss of input via
the Schaffer collaterals is associated initially with increases in
length and complexity of the basal dendritic trees of CA1 pyrami-
dal neurons that become reduced only in the very advanced
state of AD (Mufson et al., 2015).
Astrocytes Are Central Players in the Cellular Phase
of AD
In contrast to neurons, the astroglia population is strikingly
under-investigated in AD-related studies. Each astrocyte de-
ploys many fine processes to contact up to 140,000 synapses
in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus (Bushong et al., 2002).
With their end feet, they also contact blood vessels, forming
the glia limitans of the BBB (Figure 2). The astrocytes occupy
anatomically and functionally discrete micro-domains (Bushong
et al., 2002), and arrays of astrocyte and neurons are organized
around capillaries, providing the basis for higher-order neuro-
vascular units (Allen, 2014).
The metabolic roles of astroglia are well recognized (Figure 3).
Importantly, astroglia and oligodendrocytes synthesize all brain
Figure 3. Molecular and Cellular Links between Astroglia and AD
Astroglia are central in the cellular phase of AD. They interact directly with Ab and display normal synaptic and metabolic responses in AD. They also display
reactive and atrophic responses in AD. Major pathways are schematically represented.

 cholesterol and secrete apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein J
that are loaded with cholesterol by ATP-binding cassette trans-
porters—in particular, ABCA1. Synaptogenesis is promoted by
glia-derived cholesterol, but there is also complex overlap be-
tween the lipid metabolism function of these various genes and
the clearance of Ab over the BBB and blood-CSF barriers. Lipo-
protein metabolism is strongly associated with risk for AD as
repeatedly suggested in GWAS (Karch and Goate, 2015).
Astroglia play an active role in synapse formation and synaptic
strength regulation and in synchronizing and integrating the
many synaptic processes under their control. Astroglia possess
receptors and cognate signaling machinery for glutamate,
GABA, adenosine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and endocan-
nabinoids and respond to neurotransmitter release with calcium
signaling (Figure 3). They are thus well equipped to monitor
neuronal activity. They also actively secrete gliotransmittors
like ATP, glutamate, and D-serine that modulate activity of
neuronal receptors (Allen, 2014). In fact, astroglia participate in
the ‘‘tripartite synapse,’’ providing a third component to the clas-
sical ‘‘bipartite’’ flow between pre- and postsynaptic neurons.
Astrocytes thus both sense and modulate synaptic output and
may exert an integrating role in the overall computing function
of the brain (Allen, 2014; Gittis and Brasier, 2015). Astrocytes
are also involved in elimination of synapses via phagocytic re-
ceptors MEG10 and MERT (Chung et al., 2013) or via guiding
microglial cells to synapses that are pruned involving the com-
plement pathway. Recently, it was shown how this might operate
in AD: NFkB is upregulated by Ab (Lian et al., 2015) and induces
C3 release from the astrocytes. C3 binding to the G-protein-
linked receptor C3aR on neurons leads to alterations of dendritic
morphology and network dysfunction. A C3aR antagonist im-
proves performance of AD mice in the Morris water maze (Lian
et al., 2015).
Astrocytes are intimately involved in Ab catabolism, and Ab
peptides affect their metabolic phenotypes. Astroglia are acti-
vated, express inflammatory markers early (Heneka et al.,
2005), and display abnormal synchronous Ca2+ transients over
long distances upon Ab exposure (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009).
Elevated Ca2+ increases 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) signaling and
N-cadherin expression, which underlies astrogliosis. Likely
several other signaling pathways are involved as well, and astro-
glial functionality should be considered when investigating
mechanisms of Ab toxicity in brain.
Local ablation of astrocytes in specific domains of the mouse
brain causes neurodegeneration. This is partially because of
increased excitotoxicity, as glutamate is no longer efficiently
removed. However, the number of astrocytes is not markedly
reduced in aging or AD brains (Pelvig et al., 2003) nor in various
AD mice (Olabarria et al., 2010). The contribution of astrocytes to
AD neurodegeneration is thus clearly more complex than simple
‘‘astrodegeneration’’ and encompasses a whole spectrum of
beneficial and harmful reactions (Figure 3).
Reactive, Degenerating, and Atrophic Astrocytes in AD
The ‘‘reactive’’ astrogliosis in AD was noticed by Dr. Alzheimer
himself. Reactive astrogliosis is a complex and dynamic
response to brain damage (Burda and Sofroniew, 2014) charac-
terized by astrocytic hypertrophy, proliferation, and augmented
expression of intermediate filaments (glial fibrillar acidic protein
[GFAP], vimentin, and nestin). It is a physiological response
and should, a priori, be considered a protective reaction; how-
ever, in AD, it could contribute directly to defective clearance
because astrogliosis results in downregulation of Aquaporin 4
interfering with normal glymphatic flow. Astrogliosis is a relatively
early event seen before the appearance of Ab deposits in an AD
mouse model (Heneka et al., 2005). PET studies measuring
monoamine oxidase B (MaoB) activity in astrocytes confirm
that astrogliosis is an early event in patients, with the largest sig-
nals seen in prodromal AD (Carter et al., 2012). The relationship
between amyloidosis, tau pathology, and astrogliosis remains
enigmatic.
Experiments in various mouse models suggest that the astro-
glial reaction does not lead to astroglial scars as seen in injury
models—i.e., the hypertrophy reflects morphological thickening
of processes and soma, and the astroglia sustain support for the
synapses in their unit. Indeed, attenuation of astrocyte activation
(by deleting Gfap and vimentin genes) accelerates plaque path-
ogenesis in APP/PS1 mice (Kraft et al., 2013). Moreover, a
marked increase in dystrophic neurites was seen, indicating
the protective nature of the astrogliosis reaction in the mice.
Another group, however, found the opposite effect in similar
models (Kamphuis et al., 2015), and whether astrogliosis is
beneficial or harmful remains an open question. Indeed, it might
be that the answer depends upon the stage of the cellular phase
of AD and the brain region affected (Olabarria et al., 2010). The
paradoxes in the different studies will probably only be resolved
when the progressive and divergent cellular responses in AD are
systematically and comprehensively delineated.
Atrophy of astroglia, characterized by reduced branching, is
also seen at 1 month in the entorhinal cortex and at 3 months
in the prefrontal cortex of triple transgenic AD mice (Kulijewicz-
Nawrot et al., 2012). This could lead to defective metabolic sup-
port and shrinking of their territorial domain, leading to synaptic
dysfunction. Atrophy of astroglia was independently observed in
another AD mouse (Beauquis et al., 2014). Studies linking
morphological changes to functional alterations are limited. Jo
et al. (2014) provide insight in how MaoB (which is upregulated
in AD patients [Carter et al., 2012]) increases GABA in reactive,
GFAP-positive astroglia in the dentate gyrus of APP/PS1 mice.
Release of GABA causes a tonic inhibition of perforant path/
dentate granule cell synapses. Two other studies link the Gs-pro-
tein-coupled adenosine receptor A2A expressed on astroglia to
memory defects in Tau- and APP-mice (Orr et al., 2015). The
A2A-receptor is increased in AD brain, and these new studies
demonstrate that specific antagonists can restore memory
(and possibly decrease Tau-pathology) in models for AD.
Microglia and Inflammation: Beneficial or AD Promoting
Effects?
Microglia, the phagocytic cells of the CNS, comprise between
5% and 12% of the cell population in the adult mouse brain
(Lawson et al., 1990) and are a recognized part of the cellular

tory processes (which also involves astrocytes and monocytes)

 in the pathogenesis of AD have been intensively investigated
[Heneka et al., 2015]). The role of microglia in AD is likely broader
than inflammation alone. These cells constitute a dynamic pop-
ulation that samples the local brain environment continuously
with highly ramified processes and interacts intimately with neu-
rons (Li et al., 2012). Microglia phagocytose supernumerary
neurons during normal development and can directly induce
neuronal apoptosis (Salter and Beggs, 2014). More subtle ac-
tions, such as synaptic pruning, are also part of their repertoire.
Highly replicable data show complement activation, increases
in inflammatory cytokines in the CSF, increased levels of reactive
oxygen species, and so on, in AD. Epidemiological studies sug-
gest, in addition, a potential inverse correlation between the use
of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and AD prevalence
(Heneka et al., 2015), although interventional studies with anti-
inflammatory drugs have all been negative to date. Recent
genetic data unequivocally place inflammatory processes as
being important in AD. A series of GWASs of increasing size re-
vealed 22 susceptibility loci (Lambert et al., 2013) of which a
large group clearly could be ascribed to pathways within innate
immune system regulation (Figure 2): complement receptor 1
(CR1), clusterin, CD33, the MS4A6-MS4A4 cluster, ABCA7,
CD2AP, EPHA1, HLA-DRB5–DRB1, INPP5D, and MEF2C
(Karch and Goate, 2015). However, for most of these associa-
tions, it is not possible to ascribe changes in biological function
to the identified gene or, indeed, whether the polymorphisms are
in disequilibrium with other genes that harbor the relevant biolog-
ical function.
A critically important finding from two groups revealed that
rare mutations to the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells 2 (TREM2) gene significantly increased the risk of late onset
AD by about 3- to 5-fold (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al.,
2013)—an increase in risk on a par with that of APOE4. TREM2
mutations can also increase the risk of other neurodegenerative
diseases, suggesting some commonality in the underlying path-
ological processes. At the same time, a very large study of late
onset AD patients versus controls using whole-genome gene-
expression profiling (Zhang et al., 2013) demonstrated that a
module grouping innate immunity/microglia related genes corre-
lated best with clinical disease. TYROBP ranked highest as the
module’s potential regulator. TYROBP, otherwise known as
DAP12, encodes the signaling partner for TREM2. Thus, using
radically different approaches, microglial function and TREM2
signaling are found to play a major role in SAD.
TREM2 is a type I transmembrane protein that is expressed on
the surface of osteoclasts, immature dendritic cells, macro-
phages, and, in the CNS, on microglia. TREM2 ranks as one of
highest expressed receptors on microglia, where its expression
is >300-fold that of astrocytes (Hickman and El Khoury, 2014).
Homozygous, loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 and its
adaptor molecule DAP12 (TYROPB) cause Nasu Hakola disease
that is characterized by dementia, white matter loss, and cystic
bone lesions. TREM2 binds to a range of poorly defined ligands
such as phospholipids, bacterial products, and cell debris, and
receptor binding mediates microglial phagocytosis and pro-
motes an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile. The greatest risk
for AD is associated with the R47H variant, which causes loss
of function by preventing normal folding of the protein (Klein-
berger et al., 2014). An obvious hypothesis is that TREM2 is trig-
gering the phagocytosis of Ab plaques (Kleinberger et al., 2014).
Another microglia risk gene, CD33, apparently also inhibits up-
take of Ab but via a gain-of-function mechanism, as it is upregu-
lated in SAD (Griciuc et al., 2013).
To assess the effects of Trem2 in vivo, APP/PS1 transgenic
mice were crossed with Trem2�/� mice (Ulrich et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2015). The results are divergent. In one study (Ulrich
et al., 2014), no effects on Ab plaque load, cytokine levels, or mi-
croglial activation were recorded. The only reported difference
was a reduction in the numbers of microglia that clustered
around plaques. In the second study, which used a different
model—i.e., the 5XFAD mice—Trem2 knockout resulted in a
gene dosage increase in brain Ab plaques, accompanied by
significantly reduced expression of microglial markers of activa-
tion and inflammatory cytokines. Thus, this work suggests that
Trem2 plays an important role in the microglial inflammatory
response: in the absence of Trem2, this response is diminished.
Apart from their phagocytic capacities, microglia express a
range of cell-surface receptors that activate innate immune re-
sponses. This allows microglia to mount protective responses
to damage-associated molecular patterns, such as Ab aggre-
gates. In particular, a number of studies have implicated the
CD36 scavenger receptor and the Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR-4)
in mediating inflammatory cytokine release in response to aggre-
gated Ab. Data on the role of microglia and inflammatory
mediators on the deposition and clearance of Ab plaques in
APP transgenic mice are again mixed, with some researchers
finding amelioration and others exacerbation of plaque deposi-
tion. Recently, two groups looked at the effects of Interleukin
10 (IL10) on amyloid pathology in APP transgenic mice, with
very concordant results. Interleukin 10 is a cytokine that inhibits
inflammatory cytokine signaling. Increasing its expression in two
APP transgenic mouse models using adeno-associated virus
mediated brain expression (Chakrabarty et al., 2015) caused
an increase of deposited Ab42 and plaque burden. The authors
postulate that IL10-mediated increases in astrocyte ApoE pro-
duction led, in turn, to an elevation of ApoE binding to Ab plaque
that reduced microglial phagocytosis—although this appears to
be at variance with data showing binding of ApoE to Trem2 (Atagi
et al., 2015). In the second study (Guillot-Sestier et al., 2015), the
investigators crossed APP/PS1 transgenic mice with IL10�/�
knockout mice. In a similar fashion, but with an opposite polarity,
the IL10 deficiency reduced insoluble, deposited Ab. Another
study investigated the effects of removing microglia from the
brain altogether (Grathwohl et al., 2010). Using different gangci-
clovir dosing regimens, it was possible to remove nearly 100% of
the microglia, albeit for a relatively short duration of up to
4 weeks. In no case was the deposition or clearance of amyloid
plaques altered.
Collectively, these examples illustrate the conundrum of in-
flammatory processes: in some situations they can be beneficial,
in others, damaging. A more integrated approach seems neces-
sary to investigate the progressive inflammatory and other
responses, and a more comprehensive analysis of the role of
the different cells (microglia, but also astroglia and infiltrating
monocytes) over the different stages of the cellular phase of
AD is needed. Indeed, what is beneficial in the beginning could
610
Cell 164, February 11, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 become destructive later. Finally, inflammation must be placed
into the wider context of aging. The AD brain carries the hall-
marks of an inflammatory process, but it is also apparent that
age itself predisposes to inflammation—a concept that has
been coined as ‘‘inflammaging.’’ In a fascinating study, an anal-
ysis of gene expression profiles of immune- and inflammation-
related genes was conducted across a range of ages of normal
and AD brains (Cribbs et al., 2012). This study demonstrated
that the increase in expression of immune/inflammation-related
genes with age far exceeded that seen in AD versus normal
brains. The conclusion from this work is that, with age, the brain
becomes predisposed to inflammatory processes, which might
explain why age is the greatest risk factor for AD.
Oligodendrocytes: A Silent Majority
The roles of oligodendrocytes in AD are even less studied than
those of astrocytes, although evidence supports their role in
the cellular phase of the disease (Ettle et al., 2015). Oligodendro-
cytes constitute �75% of the neuroglia cells in the neocortex
and are therefore the largest group of non-neuronal cells in the
brain (Pelvig et al., 2008). They produce myelin and facilitate
neuronal transmission via saltatory action potential conductance
over the nodes of Ranvier. They also provide buffer capacity for
potassium, metabolic, trophic, and mechanic support to axons.
They are considered highly vulnerable cells and show a dramatic
(�27%) decrease in number in the aging brain (Pelvig et al.,
2008). This cellular loss is reflected in age-associated myelin
breakdown as seen in MRI scans of patients from age 50 on
(Bartzokis, 2011). Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, character-
ized by the expression of the proteoglycan nerve-glial antigen
NG2, provide up to 5% of the cells in the mature brain. They
are the main proliferating cells and can differentiate into oligo-
dendrocytes, astrocytes, and possibly neurons, although this
pluripotency remains an issue of debate (Crawford et al., 2014).
Braak suggested a link between vulnerability of neurons and
their myelination stage because the spreading of neurofibrillary
tangles recapitulates the pattern of myelination in reverse order
(Braak and Braak, 1996). Later differentiating oligodendrocytes
en-sheath more axons with small axon diameters as seen in
late myelinating frontal and temporal lobes (Bartzokis, 2011),
and it might be that these make these areas more vulnerable
to all kinds of stresses. Bartzokis goes even as far as to propose
that the recently evolved extensive myelination of the human
brain explains increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative and
neuropsychiatric disorders (Bartzokis, 2011). Age-related myelin
breakdown as assessed by MRI might indeed result in a progres-
sive disconnection of neural networks and presage AD (Bartzo-
kis, 2011). One of the more compelling arguments to increase
focus on oligodendrocytes and possible demyelination is the
strongly accentuated age-related breakdown of myelin in AD
and in APOE4 patients (Bartzokis, 2011; Scheltens et al.,
1992). At the cellular level, Ab deposition is linked to focal demy-
elination. In APP/PS1 mice, an early demyelination phenotype is
seen that is apparently ‘‘repaired’’ by proliferation of oligoden-
drocyte progenitor cells at 6–8 months (Behrendt et al., 2013).
Such proliferation is not observed in AD brain, suggesting that
this putative ‘‘protective’’ reaction does not occur in patients
(Behrendt et al., 2013). Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells appear
to phagocytose Ab while Ab triggers deficits in oligodendrocytes
in different mice models (Desai et al., 2010). Other molecular
links between AD and oligodendrocytes include their central
role in lipid metabolism, discussed above, and the role of
BACE1 in neuregulin processing.
Systems Biology Approaches to Study the Cellular
Responses in AD
The complexity emerging from the current analysis of the litera-
ture stresses the importance of generating a new theoretical
framework that encompasses the many parallel processes that
go astray in the brains of AD patients. Typically, systems biology
addresses such questions, but the ‘‘big data’’ approaches,
excepting the genetic studies, have not yet yielded spectacular
new insights into AD pathogenesis. Available studies charac-
terize global alterations of mRNA (Bennett et al., 2014; Bossers
et al., 2010; Matarin et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2010; Zhang
et al., 2013) or miRNA expression (Lau et al., 2013), thus aggre-
gating all changes in neurons, interneurons, astroglia, oligoden-
drocytes, and microglia of the analyzed brain block with a
consequent loss in resolution. Typically, small expression
changes of thousands of genes are recorded. Systems biology
uses sophisticated statistical methods to correct for the multiple
testing of hypotheses and involves a series of assumptions to
increase the power of analysis—for instance, that complex dis-
eases disturb complex biological pathways and that the genes
in these pathways are co-regulated (Santiago and Potashkin,
2014). Other assumptions are that key regulators of biological
networks can be discovered by identifying regulatory patterns
of co-expressed genes or by finding gene expression correlation
patterns between different samples (differential co-expression
network analysis or DCA) and that proteins in pathways interact
directly in a protein complex or in a small protein interaction
network (protein-protein interaction or PPI analysis). In AD, real
experimental validation of the conclusions of such analyses is
mostly lacking. A notable exception is the study on transcrip-
tion/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRF) (Lu et al.,
2014). Data mining of transcription profiles from prefrontal
cortex of aging humans predicted that REST/NRF was activated
in aging brains but less so in AD (Lu et al., 2014). An impressive
series of experiments in human brain and in mouse and
C. elegans genetic models demonstrated that REST expression
is neuroprotective, represses genes that promote cell death, in-
creases oxidative stress resistance by de-repressing FOXO1a
and SOD1 expression, and maintains neuronal viability in the
aging cortex (Lu et al., 2014), providing crucial insight in protec-
tive mechanisms that, when malfunctioning, contribute to the
risk for neurodegenerative disease.
As stated, other available systems biology studies in the field
are more descriptive. Altered regulation of transcription and
cell proliferation, changes in energy pathways or mitochondria,
upregulation of complement activation, inflammation, lipid meta-
bolism, or downregulation of synaptic transmission are expected
(Matarin et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). Further analyses try to
identify molecular players that act as drivers or are critical in the
overall processes identified. One study found downregulation of
tumor suppressors and focused also on changes in oligodendro-
cyte growth factors. Another study found significant changes in a

611
 human-specific module (group of highly co-expressed genes)
that closely correlated with AD progression. The authors specu-
late that the hubs in this network are important parts of the AD
process (Miller et al., 2010). However, none of those hubs has
been further validated, and one (FLJ12151) has even been with-
drawn as a gene by NCBI. Overall, this study found major links
with oligodendrocytes, astroglia, and microglia, re-enforcing
the major theme of the current review. As previously mentioned,
TYROBP, was identified as a regulator of an immune- and micro-
glia-specific module in a study in 549 brains from late-onset pa-
tients and non-demented subjects (Zhang et al., 2013). Although
only upregulated by 18%, the authors boldly conclude that
TYROBP may be a therapeutic target in prevention of neuronal
damage in LOAD, supported by the genetic data found in other
studies (vide supra).
There are many reasons why systems biology approaches are
currently not yielding novel insights in our field. Further massive
data gathering is of questionable use unless systematic, quality
controlled, in-depth phenotypic information is associated with
the samples (Bennett et al., 2014). However, in addition,
massively collecting ‘‘omic’’ data from blocks of brain material
probably lacks the granularity required to dissect key aspects
of the disease process. The brain is the most complex structure
of the human body with an incredible variety of cell types. The
lack of cellular resolution makes it very likely that dramatic
changes in gene expression in particular cell types or groups
of cells will be diluted or lost by the absence of effects in other
cell groups. The interpretation of data from brain blocks might
be very misleading with regard to the cell type affected in the
disorder.
Single-Cell Populations and Resolution over Different
Stages of Disease
A recent systems biology study in AD mice strikingly illustrated
the above point by looking separately at astrocytes and micro-
glia (Orre et al., 2014). The immune pathways were much more
affected in astrocytes than in microglia, and interestingly, while
the recorded alterations in astrocytes were remarkably similar
to the alterations recorded in human AD brain, the microglial
changes showed much less similarity (Orre et al., 2014). Individ-
ual changes in expression of genes were much more pro-
nounced than in the ‘‘whole brain block’’ studies. Tyrobp expres-
sion increased almost 10-fold (compared to the overall 18%
increase reported in human AD [Zhang et al., 2013]), and
Trem2 increased more than 9-fold in the astrocytes while both
were conspicuously absent in the list of microglia associated
gene changes (Orre et al., 2014). While Trem2 expression is
much lower in astrocytes than in microglia (Hickman and El
Khoury, 2014), these dramatic and consistent changes in gene
expression provide high confidence that they are real and will
translate to biologically significant effects. The study clearly illus-
trates how important it is to provide cellular resolution when per-
forming whole-genome analyses of the brain.
Temporal resolution is also important. In particular, studies on
human tissue tend to pool the data without taking into account
disease duration or evolution. A study following global gene
(Bossers et al., 2010) and miRNA (Lau et al., 2013) expression
in the prefrontal cortex over different Braak stages of AD demon-
strated major changes between Braak stage II and III, which is
just before or at the onset of plaque and tangle pathology. Unex-
pectedly, and in contrast with other genome-wide studies, in-
creases in synaptic plasticity genes came up in this early phase,
while downregulation was only seen in the late stage of AD
(Bossers et al., 2010). The miRNA study demonstrates complex
patterns of change in 41 miRNA with a 2- to 3-fold decrease in
miRNA132 expression standing out in this analysis (Lau et al.,
2013). Unfortunately, the dataset encompasses only 49 brains
at the moment, and therefore, statistical power is limited. Ex-
panding this dataset and providing in addition cellular resolution
would be extremely helpful for the field.
Real temporal resolution can only come from animal studies
where brain samples can be taken from cohorts of mice at
different stages of the disease. One such study compared
gene expression alterations over time in Ab- and Tau-models
of the disease (Matarin et al., 2015). Mainly immune-related
changes were recorded, with an immune module strongly asso-
ciated to amyloid pathology, and genes related to synaptic func-
tion most altered in the Tau model. Cellular resolution, however,
was lacking.
The Future: Single-Cell Biology and Cellular Network
Analysis in the Study of AD
Breakthroughs in the study of the biochemical phase of AD are
still needed, and an excellent example was the recent elucidation
of the atomic structure of g-secretases, opening a complete new
perspective on drug discovery for this important AD target (Bai
et al., 2015; De Strooper, 2014). However, it is unlikely that mo-
lecular genetics or molecular cell biology will continue to propel
our understanding of the disorder in as productive a way as it has
over the last 20 years. The major challenge for AD research is
now to understand the complex cellular reaction underlying the
long prodromal phase of AD. Cellular and temporal resolution
will be crucial to map systematically the progressive cellular
alterations and to generate a comprehensive cellular theory of
the disorder. AD is indeed not a biochemical or molecular prob-
lem but a physiological one of disrupted cellular connectivity.
The disease can therefore only be fully understood in the context
of the complex cellular interactions that maintain homeostasis in
the brain—i.e., at the level of the neurovascular and glioneuronal
units discussed above.
Spectacular progress in ‘‘single-cell biology’’ (Sandberg,
2014) over the last 3 years makes it possible to map alterations
in gene expression in many different cell types in parallel. The
strong advantages of a single-cell approach are (1) agnosticism
with respect to cell type (allowing also the discovery of new cell
types) and (2) that information on the variation in responses over
a subpopulation of cells can be evaluated—e.g., do all astroglia,
interneurons and so on, respond in the same way and at the
same time to Ab stress? Two recent publications provide proof
of concept that genomic expression data from hundreds of indi-
vidual cells from mouse hippocampus (Zeisel et al., 2015) and
human cortex (Darmanis et al., 2015) can be resolved success-
fully. In addition, spatial transcriptomics is rapidly evolving, and
spatial resolution of genome-wide gene expression in cells is
becoming possible. A limitation of current approaches is that
changes are recorded only at the transcriptional level. However,
612
Cell 164, February 11, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 cells react by changes in gene expression, and pathway analysis
will help to indicate processes affected in the different cells.
A framework could be generated by measuring all changes in
the different cell types of the brain over the different Braak stages
in a few relevant brain areas, which would constitute a valuable
resource for the field and propel AD research into the complex
biology of the 21st century. Further experimentation and valida-
tion of hypotheses at the protein and in vivo level will still use
classical reductionist approaches and yield individual insights,
but being able to fit such pieces into the time, cell, and network
dependent atlas that describes the evolution of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease will be transformative for the field. Novel ideas will emanate
from such an insight and an integrated conceptual framework
will provide a scientifically coherent basis for targeted therapeu-
tics that address different elements of the disease in a stage-
dependent manner.
