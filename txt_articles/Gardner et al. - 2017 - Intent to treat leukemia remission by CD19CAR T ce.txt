Key Points
• Defined-composition
manufacturing platform of
CD19 CAR T cells contributes
to .90% intent-to-treat
complete remission rate.
• Uniformity of durable
persistence of CAR T cells
and mitigation of antigen
escape are key aspects for
further optimization.
Transitioning CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells from early-phase
trials in relapsed patients to a viable therapeutic approach with predictable efficacy and
low toxicity for broad application among patients with high unmet need is currently
complicated by product heterogeneity resulting from transduction of undefined T-cell
mixtures, variability of transgene expression, and terminal differentiation of cells at the
end of culture. A phase 1 trial of 45 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory
B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia was conducted using a CD19 CAR product of
defined CD4/CD8 composition, uniform CAR expression, and limited effector differenti-
ation. Products meeting all defined specifications occurred in 93% of enrolled patients.
The maximum tolerated dose was 106 CAR T cells per kg, and there were no deaths or
instances of cerebral edema attributable to product toxicity. The overall intent-to-treat
minimal residual disease–negative (MRD2) remission rate for this phase 1 study was 89%.
The MRD2 remission rate was 93% in patients who received a CAR T-cell product and
100% in the subset of patients who received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lym-
phodepletion. Twenty-three percent of patients developed reversible severe cytokine release syndrome and/or reversible severe
neurotoxicity. These data demonstrate that manufacturing a defined-composition CD19 CAR T cell identifies an optimal cell dose with
highlypotentantitumoractivityanda tolerableadverseeffectprofilein a cohort ofpatientswith anotherwisepoorprognosis.This trial
was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02028455. (Blood. 2017;129(25):3322-3331)
Introduction
CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–expressing autologous
T cells administered after lymphodepleting chemotherapy can induce
clinicalremissionsinB-lineagemalignancies,includingrefractorypediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), irrespective of disease burden or
anatomic dissemination.1-6 Obstacles to broad clinical deployment of this
treatment are a high failure rate in CAR T-cell manufacturing, heteroge-
neity of antitumor responses, and severe modality-associated toxicities in
some patients.1,7,8 Although structure-function attributes of the various
CD19-specific CARs have been delineated in preclinical models,9
variations among the polyclonal transduced CAR T-cell products tested
in clinical trials have limited opportunities for the systematic study of
product attributes related to cellular composition, differentiation, and
transgene expression that affect therapeutic potency and safety.10 Addi-
tionally, a major barrier to the overall success of this therapy in other
reported studies has been the exclusion of research participant enrollment
in up to 24% of patients based on an in vitro assay predicting failure to
manufacture a CAR T-cell product.8 Given the high rates of remission in
patients with ALL, manufacturing feasibility is a significant contributor to
intent-to-treat (ITT) remission induction.
WeengineeredaCART-cellproductthatcomprisesadefined1:1ratio

cytokine release syndrome (CRS) compared with prior studies and no
cases of cerebral edema.1,2 We report the duration of leukemic remissions
and the impact of lymphodepleting regimens and CD19 antigen burden
on sustained CAR engraftment and durable remissions. These data
establish the feasibility of this advanced manufacturing platform and
support further study of this highly defined CD19 CAR T-cell product.

 Methods
Study design and participants
This phase 1/2 study for recurrent/refractory CD191 ALL in children and young
adults was conducted in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration and
International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical
Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable institutional review board
requirements. All patients or their guardians provided written informed consent.
Enrollment criteria included: age $12 months and ,27 years and weight
$10 kg. Patients with no prior history of allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT) were required to have one of the following characteristics:
second or later marrow relapse, with or without extramedullary disease; first
marrow relapse at the end of the first month of reinduction, with the marrow
having $0.01% blasts by multiparameter flow cytometry, with or without
extramedullary disease; primary refractory disease, defined as having M2 or M3
marrow after $2 separate induction regimens; or an indication for HCT but
ineligible for the procedure. Patients who had undergone allogeneic HCT were
required to have a confirmed CD191 leukemia recurrence, defined as $0.01%
disease, and were required to be free from active graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and have ended immunosuppressive therapy $4 weeks before
enrollment. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement
were eligible for the study, provided they were asymptomatic. Patients with
significant neurologic deterioration were not eligible until alternate therapies
resulted in neurologic stabilization and return to baseline status. Patients had a
Lansky performance status score of $50 or a Karnofsky score of $50 for those
age $16 years. Patients were required to have a life expectancy of $8 weeks
and to have recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, or radiotherapy. Patients were required to have adequate organ
function and an absolute lymphocyte count of $100 cells per mL.
Clinical lentiviral vector and cell product manufacture
The CD19CAR-T2A-EGFRt sequence (supplemental Figure 2, available on the
Blood Web site) and expressed proteins have been previously described.11,12
CD81 and CD41 T cells were sequentially isolated from patient apheresis prod-
uct by immunomagnetic separation using the CliniMACS device (Miltenyi
Biotec) in positive selection mode. Selected cell fractions then either proceeded
directly to stimulation or were cryopreserved in Cryostor-CS5 (BioLife Solu-
tions) for future expansion.
After enrichment, 180 3 106 CD4 and CD8 selected T cells were separately
stimulated with GMP Dynabeads CD3/CD28 CTS (Thermo Fisher) at a 1:3 ratio
(T cell to bead) and transduced via spinoculation with clinical grade SCRI-
19CAR-01_epHIV7 at an approximate multiplicity of infection of 0.1 in
X-Vivo15 containing 10% fetal calf serum with 0.1 mg/mL of protamine sulfate
(APP Pharmaceutical). CD4 cultures were supplemented with 5 ng/mL of
recombinant human interleukin-7 (rhuIL-7) and 0.5 ng/mL of rhuIL-15
(CellGenix),whereasCD8culturesweresupplementedwith0.5ng/mLofrhuIL-
15 and 50 U/mL of rhuIL-2 (Prometheus). Cultures were then transferred to
appropriately sized VueLife fluorinated ethylene propylene culture bags (Saint-
Gobain) and maintained at 37°C, 75% relative humidity, 5% CO2. Cultures were
fed every 2 to 3 days with fresh X-Vivo15 and 10% fetal calf serum,
supplemented with appropriate cytokines as described to keep cell density
between 5 3 105 and 2 3 106 viable cells per mL. Approximately 10 days after
the lentiviral transduction, the CD3/CD28 CTS particles were removed using the
Dynal DynaMag CTS magnet. Approximately 2 days after bead removal,
cultures received immunomagnetic positive selection for EGFRt-expressing
cells using the CliniMACS device.
Cultures were propagated until sufficient cells for testing and patient
administration were generated as determined by Trypan blue exclusion, at which
time cultures were harvested, washed in Isolyte (Braun) with 2% human serum
albumin, and resuspended in Cryostor-CS5 for cryopreservation in CryoMACS
bags (Miltenyi Biotec). Quality-control tests on freshly thawed cells included
viability by Trypan blue exclusion, potency (cell-surface expression of EGFRt),
identity (cell-surface expression of CD4 or CD8 as appropriate), average
transgene copy number (WPRE quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]),
replication-competent virus testing (VSV-G quantitative PCR and formal
replication-competent lentivirus testing at the University of Indiana), residual
bead count, mycoplasma (PCR), endotoxin (limulus amebocyte lysate), and
sterility (US Pharmacopeia bacterial and fungal). Typically, these release tests
were completed within 7 days of product cryopreservation.
Evaluations
The primary end points of this study were to evaluate feasibility and toxicity.
Feasibility was evaluated by the ability to generate a therapeutic product after
2 attempts using a single apheresis product as starting material. Toxicity was
evaluated relative to a baseline assessment conducted within 24 hours before
T-cell infusion. The primary efficacy end point was the MRD2 rate by bone
marrow aspirate by day 63; assessments were also conducted on days 7, 21, and
42 postinfusion. Responses were graded per standard ALL criteria. Secondary
end points included persistence of transferred T cells (defined as the detection of
transferred T cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow), disease response
and anti-CD19 activity response (defined as a measurable effect of disease
reduction and absence of CD191 cells), and efficacy of cetuximab in ablating
EGFRt1 T cells. Isolated peripheral blood and bone marrow lymphocytes and
whole cerebrospinal fluid were stained with a viability dye and the following
monoclonal anti-human antibodies: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD14, and
allophycocyanin-conjugated cetuximab (BD Biosciences). Cells were acquired
on an LSRFortessa (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and analyzed using FlowJo
software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Immunophenotyping of surface markers
on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and starting and final products was per-
formed using standard staining and flow cytometry techniques with combina-
tionsofthefollowingfluorophore-conjugatedanti-humanmonoclonalantibodies:
CD3, CD8a, CD4, CD14, CD45RO, CD27, CD45RA, CCR7, CD95, PD-1, and
LAG-3 (BD Biosciences) and TIM-3 and CD39 (Biolegend). CAR T-cell ex-
pression (EGFRt) was quantified using custom-conjugated cetuximab-
allophycocyanin (BD Biosciences). Cells were also stained with a live/dead
viability dye (BD). Cells were acquired on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences), and
flow cytometric analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Treestar). T cells
were defined as singlets/lymphocytes/live CD31CD142/CD41 or CD81.

 Statistical analysis
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) at the end of phase 1 dose escalation was
defined as the highest T-cell dose with $6 toxicity-evaluable patients and a
cumulative dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate ,34%.
Standard descriptive statistics (median/range, percentage, and response rate)
are reported for key variables. Directional associations between categorical
variables with 3 levels (severe CRS, neurotoxicity) and various predictors were
evaluated via univariate proportional odds logistic regression. The significance
level for these tests and others described in this section was .05.
Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated for overall survival (OS), event-free
survival (EFS), and B-cell aplasia (BCA), a marker of T-cell persistence. The OS
and EFS curves include data from all infused patients. For BCA, only data from
patients achieving CR were included. Pairs of curves were calculated for these
end points, dividing patients into 2 groups by characteristics and variables either

 were calculated for each patient, then grouped by risk factors as listed in this
section, and differences were tested via a two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
(when 2 groups were compared) or Kruskal-Wallis test (when $3 groups were
compared).
Analyses were performed using R 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).
Results
Forty-five patients with relapsed or refractory CD191 ALL were
enrolled inthe phase 1 arm of the PLAT-02 protocol, with a median age
of 12.3 years (range, 1.3-25.4 years), including 4 patients ,3 years of
age(Table1;supplementalTable1).Twenty-eightpatients(62%)hada
history of at least 1 prior allogeneic transplantation, with a range of 121
to 1783 days from the time of most recent transplantation before
enrollment. The disease burden varied, with 22 patients having M3
marrow and 9 having active CNS involvement at time of lymphode-
pletion.SevenpatientshadpreviouslyreceivedCD19-directedtherapy:
blinatumomab (n 5 6) and second-generation (CD28zeta) CD19-
specific CAR T cells (n 5 1). The mean time between completion of
blinatumomab and PLAT-02 CAR T-cell infusion was 52 days (range,
36-73 days) and 21 months from prior CD19 CAR T-cell infusion.
An objective of our study was to determine the feasibility of
manufacturing and releasing patient-derived products with distinct
features: a defined 1:1 ratio of CAR-expressing CD41/CD81 subsets,
uniform high-level expression of CD19-specific 4-1BB:z CAR, and
homogeneity of T-cell differentiation at the end of culture with
enrichment of cells expressing cell-surface markers associated with
engraftment fitness.13,14 In the heavily treated population of children
and young adults with ALL enrolled in this study, the sole eligibil-
ity requirement pertaining to manufacturing feasibility was an ALC
.100 cellsper mL.The average ALC at the time of apheresis was 1228
cellspermL(range,168-4488cells),andnoinvitroproliferationscreen
was required. All enrolled patients had successful manufacturing of a
clinical CAR T-cell product, and 33 of 45 products were manufactured
from fresh apheresis material, whereas 12 of 45 were manufactured
from cryopreserved CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets. Paired CD4/CD8
products were manufactured (Figure 1A) and released at the protocol-
prescribed doses from 41 (89%) of 45 on an ITT basis, whereas an
additional 3 patients had released products that deviated from specifi-
cation (2 without CD4 unit and 1 with a less than 1:1 CD4:CD8 dose
administered). One patient (S39) had a product that failed to expand
adequately and required a second apheresis, which produced a CAR
T-cell product that was released for infusion at the prescribed 1:1 ratio.
The cytokine cocktails used for manufacturing of CD8 and CD4 T cells
enriched for T cells with phenotypic markers associated with
engraftment fitness, such as CD127, CCR7, and CD27 (Figure 1B). The
midprocess immunomagnetic EGFRt selection step enriched for
transgene-expressingTcells(Figure1C)atauniformlevelofexpression
(Figure 1D). The average length of cell-product manufacturing was
15 days for CD8-cell products (range, 11-22 days) and 14 days for
CD4 products (range, 10-20 days). A median of 53 days transpired
(range, 29-156 days) from consent to product infusion.
Detectable engraftment and expansion of CAR T cells were
observed in 42 (98%) of the 43 infused patients, and BCA was ob-
served in 40 (93%) of 43. Irrespective of cell dose, all patients (n 5 14)

From 
 CD191 cells (Figure 2B). The median time to peak engraftment in
peripheral blood was 10 days (range, 7-18 days). For the entire cohort
of treated patients, the magnitude (area under the curve) and peak
engraftment in peripheral blood did not correlate with the infused cell
dose (P 5 .9 and .8, respectively) or disease burden at the time of
product infusion (P 5 .12 and .14, respectively) but positively
correlated with the total level of CD191 antigen load in the marrow
(tumor plus nonmalignant B cells .15% vs ,15%; P 5 .001 and
.003, respectively) and the use of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
versus cyclophosphamide alone as the lymphodepletion regimen
(P 5 .05 and .03, respectively; Figure 2C). However, the significance
of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on peak engraftment was lost
when accounting for CD19 antigen load. Engraftment kinetics in the
bone marrow were similar to those in peripheral blood; however, M3
disease burden significantly correlated with the magnitude of CAR
T-cell engraftment in marrow specimens (supplemental Figure
2A-B). The persistence of functional CD19 CAR T cells was assessed
by measuring the duration of BCA by flow cytometry. With a median
follow-up duration of 9.6 months for the entire cohort (range, 2-28
months),themedianexpecteddurationofBCAwas3months(95%CI,
2.07-6.44; Figure 2D).
The rate of MRD2 CR, as measured by multiparameter flow
cytometry, was 89% (40 of 45) in all enrolled subjects and 93% (40 of
43) among research participants who received a CAR T-cell infusion
(Table 2). All remissions occurred by day 21. There was no impact of
disease burden, relapsed or refractory status, prior transplantation
status, or high-risk cytogenetics on achievement of MRD2 CR. The
rate of MRD2 CR was 90% (19 of 22) in M3 patients and 100% (14 of
14) for those who received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Four of
the six patients who had received prior blinatumomab obtained an
MRD2 CR. Of the 3 evaluable patients who did not obtain a CR, 2 had
evidence of engraftment with expansion and functional activity of the
CAR T cells (supplemental Figure 3). The ALC at the time of aphere-
sis was lower in the 3 nonresponders (mean, 469 vs 1327 cells per mL;
P 5 .04). Of the 40 patients who obtained an MRD2 CR, 27 had a
malignant clone identified by next-generation sequencing. Sixty-five
percent (17 of 27) of these patients achieved a molecular CR by day 63.
The estimated 12-month EFS is 50.8% (95% CI, 36.9%-69.9%;
Figure 3A) and the estimated 12-month OS is 69.5% (95% CI, 55.8%-
86.5%; Figure 3B) of infused patients, with a median follow-up time
of 9.6 months. The temporal relationship between duration of BCA,
duration of remission, and occurrence of relapse is depicted in
Figure 3C. Eighteen of the 40 patients who obtained an MRD2 CR
experienced relapse, 17 of which were isolated to marrow and 1 of
which was isolated to CNS (supplemental Table 1). Seven relapses
were associated with loss of cell-surface detection of CD19, including
1 lineage switch to acute myeloid leukemia occurring 1 month after
CAR T-cell infusion.15 Of the 11 relapses in which leukemic cell-
surface CD19 expression was preserved, the median time from T-cell
infusion to relapse was 5.98 months (range, 1.25-14 months), with a
median time from loss of BCA to relapse of 3.7 months (range, 0-11
months). Eleven patients underwent consolidative allogeneic HSCT,
and 2 subsequentlyexperienced recurrence,bothwith CD191 disease.
These 2 patients exhibited molecularly detectable leukemia by next-
generation sequencing at the time of transplantation; 1 was MRD2 by
flow cytometry. Of 29 patients who reached a CR and did not proceed
to consolidative allogeneic HSCT, 13 remain in continuous CR, with a
median follow-up time of 12.2 months (range, 1.9-27.5 months).
In analyzing the 40 patients achieving MRD2 remission in this
study, we found that the loss of functional CAR T cells,as measured by
loss of BCA, adversely affected the risk of CD191 leukemic relapse
(hazard ratio [HR], 34; 95% CI, 2.1-552; P 5 .01), whereas the HR
for all relapses, CD191 and CD192, was 3.5 (95% CI, 1.01-11.88;
P 5 .04). In a multivariate analysis of factors that predicted BCA
duration, inclusive of dose level, disease burden, and lymphodepletion,
marrow CD191 antigen load of ,15% before lymphodepletion was a
significant risk factor for early loss of BCA (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.32-
6.81; P 5 .005). The median duration of BCA for patients with a
CD191 antigen load .15% was 6.4 months (95% CI, 2.6 months to
upper bound not defined) vs 1.7 months for patients with a load of
,15% (95% CI, 1.4 months to upper bound not defined; Figure 3D).
The median duration of BCA for the 29 patients who received
lymphodepletion therapy without fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
was 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.4-6.4 months) versus 6.4 months (95% CI,
lower bound 2.5 months) for the 14 patients who received fludarabine
and cyclophosphamide (P 5 .15; Figure 3E).
Ten patientes received a second dose of CAR T cells (supplemental
Table 2). Administration of a second dose of CAR T cells in 8 patients
who had lost engraftment resulted in only 2 demonstrating evidence
of reengraftment. The 6 patients who did not obtain reengraftment
received the less immunosuppressive lymphodepletion regimen that
did not include fludarabine with the first infusion; therefore, the role
of immunologic rejection cannot be discounted as an etiology of
reengraftment failure.3,4 Two (S04 and S32) of the 8 patients were
administered CAR T cells for CD191 relapse after loss of CAR T cells,
with 1 (S32) obtaining a second MRD2 CR. Two additional patients
were administered repeat infusions for ongoing (S09) or reemergence
(S37) of CD191 disease with persistent low-level CAR T-cell
engraftment; after reinfusion, these 2 patients continued to experience
ongoing CAR T-cell persistence without substantial reexpansion,
induction of BCA, or antileukemic effect.
The occurrence of severe toxicities resulting in patient mortality is a
barrier to broad adoption of CAR T-cell immunotherapy. No deaths
resulting from toxicity were reported in this trial. DLTs were observed
at all dose levels and disease burdens (Table 3). Dose-level 2 (1 3 106
CAR T cells per kg) was determined to be the MTD, with a DLT rate of
17% (1 of 6) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and 9% (1 of 11)
overall.Nopatientmetcriteriatoreceivecetuximab.Themostcommon
adverse events related to CAR T cells were CRS and neurotoxicity
(supplemental Tables 3 and 4). The overall incidence of CRS was 93%
(40 of 43) of patients, and the rate of protocol-defined severe CRS
(requirement for pressors, inotropes, or respiratory failure) was 23%
(10 of 43). The predominant symptom that contributed to severity
of CRS was hypotension requiring pressor support. No patient
required intubation for respiratory failure, multiple pressors, or high-
dose pressors. For treatment of CRS, 16 patients received 1 or .1 (5 of
16) doses of tocilizumab, and 10 patients received corticosteroids for a
median duration of 5 days (range, 1-13 days). The use of tociluzimab

 and/or corticosteroids did not affect response rates or durability of
remission.Adose-leveleffectonseverityofCRSwasnoted,withhigher
doses associated with higher rates of severe CRS (P 5 .03; Figure 4A).
A correlation between disease burden at the time of CAR T-cell infusion
withseverityofCRS(P5.56)orwithCD19antigenload(P5.13)was
not observed; however, there was a trend toward increased CRS with
increased CD19 antigen load. Similarly, there was no impact of the
lymphodepletion regimen on severity of CRS (P 5 .63).
The overall incidence of neurotoxicity was 49% (21 of 43); severe
neurotoxicity (any grade seizure or grade 3/4 neurotoxicity exclusive
of headache) occurred in 21% (9 of 43). No cases of cerebral edema
were encountered. There was no effect of dose level (P 5 .32),
disease burden (P 5 .93), CD19 antigen load (P 5 .23), or fludarabine
and cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion (P 5 .32) on the occurrence
of severe neurotoxicity; however, the presence of severe CRS was
predictive of subsequent severe neurotoxicity (P 5 .01; Figure 4B). All
patients experiencing neurotoxicity experienced reversible symptoms
and eventual return to baseline neurologic status.
Twenty-seven patients in the trial had undergone prior allogeneic
HSCT. One of these patients experienced recrudescence of grade 3
acute skin GVHD (supplemental Figure 4). This patient (S03) was 2.3
yearsfrompriortransplantationandhadtaperedoffGVHDmedications
more than 1 year before CAR T-cell treatment. Although the infused
CAR T cells cannot be formally ruled out as direct mediators of the skin
GVHD, a biopsy of involved skin revealed that 9% of CD31 T cells
infiltrating the dermis were EGFRt1 compared with 78% EGFRt1
T cells in peripheral blood. The patient was treated with prednisone
2 mg/kg per day followed by a taper for approximately 1 month, with
resolution of GVHD and without untoward effect on the persistence of
CAR T cells or BCA. Functional persistence of CAR T cells was noted
until the time of CD192 relapse 8 months after CAR T-cell infusion.
Discussion
This study evaluated treatment of children and young adults with
relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL with CD19 CAR T cells
characterized by a defined CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, a uniform level of
CAR expression, and a less differentiated phenotype. Of 43 patients
treated at CAR T-cell doses ranging from 0.5 to 10 3 106 cells per kg,
41 (93%) of 43 obtained an MRD2 CR, with a rate of 89% among all
enrolled patients. After fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphodeple-
tion, 14 of 14 patients experienced MRD2remission. Specific subgroups
of patients that may predict for increased or decreased efficacy were not
identified,becauseofthehighCRrateandtrialsize.Inparticular,therewas
nodifferenceinresponseratesbasedonnumberofpriorrelapsesoramong
lowandhighdiseaseburdenpatients.The estimated12-month OSforthis
poor-prognosis cohort of patients is 65.9%, and the estimated 12-month
EFS is 50.3%. A longer duration of postremission functional persistence
of CART cells,as inferred by ongoing BCA,correlated significantly with
the durability of remission. Higher CD19 antigen load positively
correlated with prolonged CAR T-cell persistence and BCA.
There is significant heterogeneity in CD19 CAR clinical trials
reported to date with respect to receptor composition and product
formulation.1,2,4,7,16,17 Accordingly, early-phase trials have reported a
spectrum of efficacy and toxicity results. Our data show that, despite
significant interpatient heterogeneity of apheresis T-cell populations
from children and young adults with relapsed or refractory ALL,
manufacturing using cell purification, enrichment of transgene expression,
and cocktails of recombinant human cytokines can reproducibly generate
products that exhibit phenotypic and functional attributes associated with
therapeuticpotency.13,14Thisisincontrasttoreportedstudiesthatrequired
a screening in vitro proliferation assay or ALC of .500 cells per mL for
enrollment and excluded 24% of patients enrolled in CD19 CAR trials.8
The cell selection, homeostatic cytokines, and enrichment of transgene-
expressing T cells likely all contributed to the robustness of our product-
manufacturing approach. Given the efficacy of CD19 CAR T-cell
infusionsininducingleukemicremissionsinselecttrials,thegreatestITT
riskoftherapeuticfailurenowresidesinthefeasibilityofmanufacturinga
product for any given research participant. This manufacturing platform
therefore provides a significant advantage over prior reported trials,
which excluded substantial numbers of patients because of an inability
to manufacture a product or had a marked decrease in efficacy.1,2
No deaths resulting from toxicity occurred in this trial, with an
acceptable incidence of severe CRS (23%) and severe neurotoxicity

 (23%).1-3,7 The rate of severe CRS increased with cell dose-level es-
calation; however, we did not find an effect of higher disease burden with
increased rates of severe CRS. The level of CD19 antigen burden,
although not statistically significant, did trend toward higher rates of
severe CRS. Although the reported rate of severe CRS was 23%, the
thresholddefinitionofsevereCRSusedforthistrialwaslowerthanthatin
otherreportedcomparabletrials.1,2Whenapplyingthedefinitionofsevere
CRS from other protocols, the rate of severe CRS is remarkably lower,
and in fact, there were no patients meeting the definition of grade 4 severe
CRSfromothertrials.1Therefore,thisproductseemstohaveanimproved
toxicity profile, with decreased severity of CRS. It has previously been
shown in animal models that the defined-composition product can induce
remissions at lower doses,10 and we believe that the defined-composition
formulationofthisproductenablestheuseoflowerdosesofCARTcells,
while retaining high efficacy, resulting in attenuated CRS severity.
This phase 1 study investigated tolerability of formulated CAR T-
cell product infusions over a range of cell doses and with various
lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimens. At the MTD of 106 cells per
kg after fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion, we
observed uniform engraftment and MRD2 remissions in 14 of 14
research participants and enhanced durability of functional CAR T-cell
persistence. Our phase 1 trial has revealed that a subset of patients
exhibit durable remissions without consolidative allogeneic HSCT,
and the durability of remission is enhanced by ongoing CAR T-cell
persistence. A risk factor for relapse with CD191 disease is a short
duration of BCA that in turn can be predicted by the quantity of CD19-
expressing B cells (malignant and nonmalignant) in the bone marrow
before CAR T-cell dosing. Our observation that low quantities of
CD191B cellsresult in suboptimal expansion and persistence of CD19
CAR T cells indicates a future challenge when this modality is applied
among patients earlier in the course of their therapy, for instance, pa-
tients in second remission as a consolidative therapy that obviates
prolonged chemotherapy and/or allogeneic HSCT. Approaches to
augmentCD19CART-cellpersistenceindependentofB-cell/leukemic
cell burden are warranted and are being pursued by our group via the
provision of T cells transduced to express CD19 after CAR T-cell
infusion. Additionally, the uniform use of fludarabine and cyclophos-
phamide lymphodepletion may also promote longer persistence of the
CAR T cells, allowing more comparable functional CAR T-cell
persistence to other CD19 CAR T cells with 4-1BB costimulation.1
Although we did not observe a statistically significant advantage in the
duration of CAR T-cell persistence with fludarabine and cyclophos-
phamide lymphodepletion, there was a trend toward improved per-
sistence, and this has previously been shown by others to significantly
enhance long-term CAR T-cell persistence, potentially through the
reduction of T-cell rejection responses to the murine scFv CAR binder
domain.3,4 For this reason, a phase 2 arm of this protocol is now
enrolling and treating patients at the MTD of 106 cells per kg after
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion.
CD19 antigen escape is an established mechanism of relapse after
remissions induced by CD19 CAR T-cell immunotherapy.18 In this
phase 1 study, relapse occurred in 45% of patients who achieved an
MRD2 CR, and CD19-negative escape variant leukemia accounted for
39% of these relapses. Targeting B-lineage ALL with CD22-specific
CAR T cells may enable the salvage of a proportion of patients who
experience a CD192 relapse.19 Current efforts by our group are fo-
cusing on bispecific CAR engineering and vector technologies that
allow for expression of 2 CARs that enable dual targeting of CD19 and
CD22, because the simultaneous targeting of .2 antigensisanticipated
to reduce therapeutic failures resulting from antigen escape after im-
munotherapy with monospecific CAR T cells.
