ABSTRACT 
We investigated the effects of sprint interval (SIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) 
on glucose uptake (GU) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and fatty acid uptake (FAU) at 
fasting state in thigh and arm muscles in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) or prediabetes.  
 
Twenty-six patients (age 49, SD 4; 10 women) were randomly assigned into two groups: SIT (n=13), 
and MICT (n=13). The exercise in the SIT group consisted of 4–6 x 30 s of all-out cycling with 4 min 
recovery and in the MICT group 40–60 min cycling at 60% of VO2peak. Both groups completed six 
training sessions within two weeks. GU and FAU were measured before and after the intervention 
with positron emission tomography in thigh (quadriceps femoris, QF; and hamstrings) and upper arm 
(biceps and triceps brachii) muscles. 
 
Whole-body insulin-stimulated GU increased significantly by 25% in both groups and this was 
accompanied with significantly increased insulin-stimulated GU in all thigh and upper arm muscles 
and significantly increased FAU in QF. Within QF, insulin-stimulated GU improved more by SIT than 
MICT in rectus femoris (p=0.01), but not differently between the training modes in the other QF 
muscles.  
 
In individuals with T2D or prediabetes, both SIT and MICT training rapidly improve insulin-stimulated 
GU in whole body and in the thigh and arm muscles as well as FAU in the main working muscle QF. 
These findings highlight the underused potential of exercise in rapidly restoring the impaired skeletal 
muscle metabolism in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism.

INTRODUCTION 
Prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing throughout the world (Danaei et al., 
2002). It is well known that regular exercise is an effective, though underused method for the 
prevention and treatment of T2D (Colberg et al., 2010). Emerging research in healthy subjects shows 
that not only moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), but also more vigorous high-intensity 
interval training (HIIT) causes health-enhancing changes in the body, such as increased VO2peak 
(Milanovic et al., 2015;Sloth et al., 2013;Gist et al., 2014), improved whole-body insulin sensitivity 
(Eskelinen et al., 2015;Jelleyman et al., 2015), and increased skeletal muscle (Burgomaster et al., 
2008) and whole-body fat oxidation (Astorino et al., 2013). 
The current recommendations for physical activity for people with T2D include moderate intensity 
aerobic exercise at least three times a week, totally for 150 minutes. This kind of exercise training 
benefits glucose control in T2D patients at least as effectively as drug therapy or diet (Snowling & 
Hopkins, 2006). Interestingly, recent studies with different HIIT protocols and large range of 
intensities show that HIIT can have at least equivalent health-enhancing effects also in subjects with 
T2D or prediabetes. For example, VO2peak (Karstoft et al., 2013;Robinson et al., 2015;Tjønna et al., 
2008;Mitranun et al., 2014) and whole-body insulin sensitivity (Mitranun et al., 2014;Tjønna et al., 
2008) have increased, and fasting plasma glucose concentration (Karstoft et al., 2013;Mitranun et al., 
2014) decreased at least equally after HIIT as MICT intervention in subjects with T2D or prediabetes, 
with some exceptions (Robinson et al., 2015). Plasma glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration 
has decreased more by HIIT than MICT intervention in one study (Mitranun et al., 2014), but the 
improvement has not been evident in all studies (Karstoft et al., 2013;Terada et al., 2013).  On the 
other hand, HIIT has also effectively reduced body mass (Mitranun et al., 2014), body mass index 
(BMI) (Karstoft et al., 2013;Mitranun et al., 2014) and body fat content (Mitranun et al., 2014;Terada 
et al., 2013;Karstoft et al., 2013) in patients with T2D.

Improved whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (GU) after training can be due to an effect in 
many tissues, but is mostly attributed to skeletal muscle (Dela et al., 1992;Dela & Stallknecht, 
2010;Reichkendler et al., 2013). We recently showed that GU increases in the main working muscle, 
quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle group, at least as effectively after a short-term very intense sprint 
interval training (SIT) as MICT in healthy men (Eskelinen et al., 2015). On the other hand, we did not 
observe any significant changes in GU in upper body muscles or in fatty acid uptake (FAU) in any of 
the studied muscles (Eskelinen et al., 2015). The feasibility and the effects on glucose and fat 
metabolism of such a demanding SIT intervention in subjects with T2D or impaired glucose 
metabolism are unknown.  
In the present study we used positron emission tomography (PET) combined with fluorine-18 
labelled 
tracers, 
2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose 
([18F]FDG) 
and 
14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-
heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA), to measure glucose and free fatty acid uptake in the thigh and arm 
muscles in response to SIT and MICT training performed by leg cycling exercise. In our previous study 
we found no significant difference in GU after SIT and MICT in healthy subjects, but a more extensive 
meta-analysis shows that whole-body insulin sensitivity has increased more by HIIT than MICT in 
both healthy and diabetic or metabolic syndrome patients (Jelleyman et al., 2015). Thus we tested 
the hypothesis that insulin-stimulated GU would be increased in the QF more after SIT than MICT. In 
addition, as patients with T2D or prediabetes consistently have poor physical fitness (Reusch et al., 
2013) and training can thus induce more profound metabolic changes in patients with T2D or 
prediabetes compared to healthy subjects, we also hypothesized that GU would be improved in 
these patients also in other muscles than just the main working muscle QF, and that the training 
would also improve muscle FAU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Subjects 
Fifty-seven subjects were screened, and eligible twenty-six sedentary [age 49 (SD 4) years], 
individuals (10 female) with either non-insulin-treated T2D or prediabetes (impaired glucose 
tolerance, IGT and/or impaired fasting glucose, IFG) were admitted into this study. The recruitment 
was done with newspaper advertisements, using personal contacts, and by using electronic and 
traditional bulletin boards. The inclusion criteria were age of 40-55 years and a good treatment 
balance in case of T2D. The exclusion criteria were as follows: any other chronic disease or defect 
which hinder daily life, smoking or use of narcotics, history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, history of 
asthma, current or history of regular and systematic exercise training, VO2peak > 40 ml·kg-1·min-1, or 
any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator could create a hazard to the participant’s 
safety, endanger the study procedures, or interfere with the interpretation of the study results. 
According to the diagnostic criteria of WHO (World Health Organisation, 2006), seventeen of the 
subjects had T2D, seven had both IGT and IFG, and two had IFG. Nine of the subjects in the SIT group 
and four in the MICT group were treated by oral hypoglycemic agents (table 1). The subjects were 
instructed not to alter their eating habits or daily activities during the intervention. 
Previously we observed that GU was increased in the QF by 53% after SIT and by 28% after MICT in 
healthy subjects undergoing the same training protocols as in the present study. As patients with T2D 
generally have poorer physical fitness, we assumed that the training responses and the difference in 
training response between the groups would be even larger in these patients. We calculated that a 
sample size of 10 subjects per group with the increases of 60% and 30% for HIIT and MICT would give 
> 90% power of detecting significant difference in the training response between the groups with a 
level of significance at 5% (two-tailed). To allow possible drop-outs and possible technical problems 
in acquiring or in the analyses of the data, three extra subjects were recruited for both groups.  
During the intervention, two participants from the SIT group dropped out, one due to migraine

headache during the first exercise session, and one due to claustrophobic sensation in the MR 
scanner. Three participants from the MICT group dropped out due to personal reasons. 
The health status of the subjects was determined by a thorough physical examination. The purpose, 
nature, and potential risks were verbally and literally explained to the subjects before they gave their 
informed consent to participate. The study was performed according the Declaration of Helsinki and 
was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital District of South-Western Finland (decision 
95/180/2010 §228). The present study is a part of a larger study entitled: ‘‘The Effects of Short-Term 
High-Intensity Interval Training on Tissue Glucose and Fat Metabolism in Healthy Subjects and in 
Patients with Type 2 Diabetes’’ (NCT01344928). 
 
Study design 
The measurements and the training intervention were conducted at the Turku PET Centre, Turku, 
Finland. VO2peak and body composition were measured at The Paavo Nurmi Centre, University of 
Turku, Turku, Finland. The measurement procedures were similar to our previous study in healthy 
subjects (Eskelinen et al., 2015). Pre-training oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed 
during the screening day as previously described (Eskelinen et al., 2015). This was followed by a 
VO2peak test on the same or one of the next few days (see more details below). At least a week later, a 
[18F]FTHA-PET study was performed to measure FAU in different muscles in the fasting state (see 
more details below). Before the [18F]FTHA-PET study, myocardial perfusion was measured with 
[15O]H2O-PET in the basal state and during adenosine stress. These results are not reported in the 
present paper. On the next day, a [18F]FDG-PET study under hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was 
performed to measure insulin-stimulated GU in different muscles (see more details below) as 
previously described for the healthy subjects (Eskelinen et al., 2015). Subjects were required to have 
fasted for at least 10 h before the OGTT and PET measurement days. They were also instructed to 
abstain from caffeinated drinks and to avoid exhausting exercise 48 h prior to the studies. After all

the pre-training measurements, the subjects were randomly allocated into two training groups: 
either into the SIT or MICT group. Randomization was performed in random permuted blocks of four 
subjects with 1:1 ratio. 
All the measurements were repeated after the training interventions starting on the second day 
(about 48 hours) after the last training session. The post-training measurements were started with 
the [18F]FTHA-PET study, followed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and the [18F]FDG-PET 
study on next day, and completed with OGTT and VO2peak tests on the fourth post-training day.  
 
Training interventions 
Similarly to our previous study (Eskelinen et al., 2015;Kiviniemi et al., 2014) both groups (SIT and 
MICT) trained six sessions within two weeks in controlled laboratory conditions. The progressive SIT 
training included 4–6 × 30 s of all-out cycling efforts with 4 min of recovery between the bouts, 
during which participants were allowed to remain still or do unloaded cycling (Monark Ergomedic 
894E; Monark, Vansbro, Sweden) as based on the protocol originally described by Burgomaster et al. 
(2005). The initial number of bouts was 4 and it was increased by one after every other session. Each 
bout started with about a five-second acceleration to maximal cadence without any resistance, 
followed by a sudden increase of the load (10% of the fat free body mass in kg) and continued by 
maximal cycling for 30 seconds. The participants were shortly familiarized with the SIT training 
protocol during the screening phase (2 x 30 s bouts). A session of MICT group consisted of 40-60 min 
of cycling at an intensity of 60% of VO2peak with an electrically-braked ergometer (Tunturi E85, Tunturi 
Fitness, Almere, the Netherlands). The duration of cycling was initially 40 min, and it was increased 
by 10 min after every other session until 60 min was reached during the last two sessions. 5 min low-
intensity warm-up and cool-down periods were included in both training modes before and after 
each session.

PET measurements 
The GU and FAU measurements were performed as previously described (Eskelinen et al., 2015). The 
PET and CT imaging was performed with GE Advance PET/CT scanner (General Electric Medical 
System, Milwaukee, WI, USA).  
FAU was measured using [18F]FTHA (half-life 110 min) that was produced as previously described 
(DeGrado, 1991;Maki et al., 1998). The tracer [155 (SD 9) MBq] was injected into the vein and 
scanning of the thoracic region (biceps and triceps brachii muscles) was started simultaneously and 
continued for 40 minutes in 4 x 15 s, 6 x 20 s, 2 x 60 s, 2 x 150 s and 6 x 300 s time frames. The 
femoral region (quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscle groups) was scanned starting 
approximately at 65 minutes after the tracer injection in 3 x 300 s time frames. Starting at 4 min after 
the tracer injection, blood samples for plasma radioactivity determination (Wizard 1480 3; Wallac, 
Turku, Finland) and calculation of input function were collected at approximately (exact timing was 
recorded) 4, 5, 7.5, 10, 20, 30, 55, and 70 min time points. As the heart was in the imaging area, the 
activity in the LV chamber in the first ten time frames (first 3 min) in PET image set were used for 
determination of input function for that period. Additional blood samples were collected to measure 
the metabolites of the [18F]FTHA to make pure plasma [18F]FTHA input function.    
Insulin-stimulated GU was measured using [18F]FDG (half-life 110 min) that was produced as 
previously described (Hamacher et al., 1986;Lemaire et al., 2002). The tracer [157 (SD 10) MBq] was 
injected into the vein and similar scans with similar framing from thoracic and femoral regions were 
performed as in the [18F]FTHA-study. Also plasma radioactivity samples for input function were taken 
similarly, but no other samples were needed as [18F]FDG is not metabolized. Due to technical issues 
some of the PET measurements were unsuccessful.  The [18F]FTHA study was successfully completed 
for 25 subjects (12 SIT, 13 MICT) pre- and for 17 subjects (8 SIT, 9 MICT) postintervention. The 
[18F]FDG study was successfully completed for 24 subjects (11 SIT, 13 MICT) pre- and for 19 subjects 
(9 SIT, 10 MICT) postintervention.

PET data analysis 
All PET image data were corrected for dead time, decay, and photon attenuation and reconstructed 
using 3D-OSEM reconstruction method. Carimas software (version 2.9, Turku PET Centre, Turku, 
Finland, www.turkupetcentre.fi/carimas) was used in the image analysis. Regions of interest (ROIs) 
were drawn manually into the CT images and copied into the PET images for the data analysis. 
Femoral region ROIs encompassed the four heads of QF individually (rectus femoris, RF; VL; vastus 
medialis, VM; vastus intermedius, VI) and the hamstring muscle group (semitendinosus, 
semimembranosus, and biceps femoris) in five cross-sectional mid-thigh planes (5 x 3.3 mm thick). 
For the QF as a whole, the weighted average according to cross-sectional area of the four heads of 
QF was calculated. For the upper arm muscles, ROIs were drawn into the biceps and triceps brachii 
muscles on three subsequent cross-sectional mid-muscle planes. Using these ROIs, tissue time 
activity curves (TACs) were extracted from the PET data.   
Fractional rate of tracer uptake was calculated using graphical analysis using tissue and plasma TACs 
as previously described (Eskelinen et al., 2015). The rate of glucose (GU) and fatty acid uptake (FAU) 
was calculated by multiplying the fractional tracer uptake rate by the average plasma glucose or 
plasma free fatty acid concentration of the study subjects from the repeated samples during the PET 
scan. With GU this was further divided by the lumped constant value of 1.2 (Peltoniemi et al., 2000). 
Analyses of plasma glucose concentrations were performed at the Turku PET Centre laboratory and 
analyses of plasma FFAs as well as hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) at the laboratory of Turku 
University Hospital using standard assays.

Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp 
The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study was performed as previously described (Eskelinen et 
al., 2015). It was performed after at least 10 hours of fasting. A primed-constant insulin (Actrapid, 
100 U · ml-1, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) infusion was started with the rate of 40 mU · m2 of 
body surface area in minutes during the first 4 min. From 4 to 7 min, infusion rate was reduced to 20 
mU·m-2·min-1, and, from 7 min to the end of the clamp, it was kept constant at 10 mU·m-2·min-1. 
Exogenous glucose infusion was started 4 min after the start of the insulin infusion with a rate of 
subject’s weight (kg) · 0.1-1·g-1·h-1. At 10 min, glucose infusion was doubled, and after that further 
adjusted according to blood glucose concentration to keep it as closely as possible to the level of 5 
mmol · l-1. Arterialized venous blood samples were collected before the clamp and every 5 min during 
the first 30 min of the clamp and later every 10 minutes to determine the glucose concentration for 
adjusting the glucose infusion rate. Whole body insulin-stimulated GU rate was calculated from the 
measured glucose values collected during the PET scan that was started 95 min (SD 20) after the start 
of the clamp. FDG-PET study was performed when the subject had reached the stable glucose 
concentrations at the level of 5 mmol · l-1 (within 5% range for at least 15 min) after positioning into 
the PET scanner (table 2). 
 
VO2peak test and body composition 
Similarly to the previous description of the study in the healthy subjects (Eskelinen et al., 
2015;Kiviniemi et al., 2014), the subjects with T2D or prediabetes in this study performed an exercise 
test (VO2peak test) on a bicycle ergometer (Ergoline 800s; VIASYS Healthcare, Germany) to determine 
peak oxygen consumption. The participants were asked to abstain from eating and drinking at least 
for 2 hours before the testing. The test was started at 50 W and followed by an increase of 30 W 
every 2 minutes until volitional exhaustion. Ventilation and gas exchange (Jaeger Oxycon Pro; VIASYS 
Healthcare) were measured and reported as the mean value per minute. The peak respiratory

exchange ratio was at least 1.17 and the peak blood lactate concentration, measured from capillary 
samples obtained immediately and 1 min after exhaustion (analyzed using YSI 2300 Stat Plus; YSI 
Incorporated Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH), was at least 7.4 mmol·l-1  for all the tests. The highest 
1-min mean value of oxygen consumption was used as VO2peak. The test was performed for each 
participant before the intervention and 4 days after the last training session at approximately the 
same time of day at the test laboratory of the Paavo Nurmi Centre, University of Turku, Turku, 
Finland. Body composition was measured also at the Paavo Nurmi Centre using a bioimpedance 
monitor (InBody 720, Mega Electronics Ltd., Kuopio, Finland). 
 
Statistical analysis 
All the data are presented as mean (95% confidence interval, CI). Normal distribution of the variables 
was evaluated visually and tested using Shapiro-Wilk test. Logarithmic transformations were done to 
achieve the normal distribution assumption for all GU data, for FAU in the hamstrings, as well as for 
insulin concentrations, insulin AUC, glucose (FTHA), and body fat percentage. 
The difference between the groups at the baseline was tested using t-test for age and height and 
Fisher’s exact test for the diabetes status (T2D or prediabetes) and gender. For all other parameters 
reported in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 we used a hierarchical linear mixed model including 
one within-factor (time) and one between-factor (group). Compound symmetry covariance structure 
was used for time. The diabetes status (T2D/prediabetes) and gender were used as additional factors 
for all the analyses. Subjects with one value, but another missing (drop outs, technical problems) are 
included in this model and therefore model-based mean (SAS least square means) values are 
reported for all the parameters. Comparisons between the changes in GU and blood glucose 
variables were performed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and by Spearman’s rank correlation 
coefficient (ρ) for non-normally distributed data.

All the tests were performed as two-sided with a significance level set at 0.05. The analyses were 
performed using SAS System, version 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, US). 
 
RESULTS  
Subjects characteristics and whole-body findings 
At the baseline, the two training groups did not differ according to any of the characteristics reported 
in this study (by t-test or Fisher’s exact test). Over the study, fat percentage decreased (p=0.018 for 
the time effect) in both training groups, but body weight, BMI, and fat free mass (FFM) only tended 
to change (all p≤0.11 for the time effect). VO2peak changed differently between the groups (p=0.0495 
for the group*time interaction), increasing by 5.0%, 1.3 (0.3, 2.3) ml·kg-1·min-1 (p=0.013 for the time 
effect) in the SIT group and remaining unchanged in the MICT group, -0.2 (-1.3, 0.9) ml·kg-1·min-1 
(p=0.75 for the time effect). In both groups HbA1c decreased (p=0.002 for the time effect), Hb and 
Hct decreased (p<0.001 and p<0.001), 2-h glucose OGTT tended to decrease (p=0.089), and whole-
body insulin-stimulated GU (M-value in the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) increased (p=0.001) 
during the intervention, whereas there was no change in the fasting glucose or insulin levels. When 
Hb was added to the model, the decrease in HbA1c was no longer significant (p=0.22 for the time 
effect, p=0.74 for group*time interaction). 
 
Glucose, FFA, and insulin concentrations during the PET studies 
The glucose and FFA concentrations during both PET measurements were similar between the 
groups and did not change during the intervention (Table 2). The insulin levels during the FAU 
measurements decreased (p=0.002 for the time effect) with no difference between the groups 
(p=0.54 for the group*time interaction, Table 2).

GU and FAU in different lower and upper body muscles 
The insulin-stimulated GU increased statistically significantly in QF, hamstrings, and biceps and 
triceps brachii in both training groups without statistically significant difference between the groups 
(see Fig. 1 for statistics). In the QF the GU increased by 3.35 (2.45, 4.59) µmol·100 g-1·min-1 in the SIT 
group (p<0.001), and by 1.70 (1.27, 2.29) µmol·100 g-1·min-1 in the MICT group (p<0.001), which 
correspond to 138% and 93% changes in average, respectively.  
Within QF, RF responded differently to training interventions (p=0.010 for the group*time 
interaction) so that GU increased significantly more in the SIT group (Fig. 2). However, in the vasti 
muscles (VL, VM and VI) GU increased after both training modes (all p<0.001 for the time effect), but 
not differently between the groups (all p>0.26 for the group*time interaction, Fig. 2).  
The change in the 2-h glucose OGTT correlated strongly with the change in GU in the QF (ρ=-0.87, 
p=0.002) and triceps brachii (ρ=-0.83, p=0.005) in the SIT group, but not significantly in the MICT 
group. The changes in fasting glucose or glucose AUC in the OGTT did not correlate significantly with 
the changes in GU in any of the investigated muscles. 
The FAU increased statistically significantly in the QF, but not in hamstrings, biceps, or triceps brachii. 
Training interventions increased FAU in all the four heads of QF (all p≤0.036 for the time effect), but 
not statistically differently between the groups (all p>0.60 for group*time interaction). 
 
DISCUSSION 
Both SIT and MICT have been shown to be effective in improving insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 
the main working muscle, QF in healthy subjects (Eskelinen et al., 2015). Here we show that these 
training modes are even more effective in the subjects with T2D or prediabetes, as only six session of 
SIT or MICT within two weeks induced dramatic 138% and 93% increases in QF GU compared to 53%

and 28% increase previously observed in healthy subjects. Furthermore, in contrast to healthy 
subjects, GU increased significantly also in the hamstrings and arm muscles and also FAU increased in 
the QF. Correspondingly with the findings in healthy subjects, GU in the RF increased significantly 
more after SIT than after MICT. These findings underscore the remarkable possibilities that exercise 
training - either SIT or MICT - has to restore impaired skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated glucose 
uptake and insulin sensitivity even in a very short time frame. 
In the present study, in subjects with T2D or prediabetes, both SIT and MICT training increased 
whole-body insulin sensitivity (M-value) similarly by 25% on average. This finding agrees well with 
the previous findings, although the changes were larger here than in our previous study with healthy 
subjects after similar training interventions (Eskelinen et al., 2015). Also other studies have shown 
markedly improved insulin sensitivity in subjects with T2D or prediabetes after HIIT and/or MICT 
interventions (Mitranun et al., 2014;Tjønna et al., 2008). Interestingly, training also decreased HbA1c 
significantly in both groups even though fasting glucose values remained unchanged. One potential 
explanation for decreased HbA1c could be decreased postprandial plasma glucose levels (Praet et al., 
2006), as it has been shown that even a single session of HIIT or MICT leads to significantly 
attenuated postprandial plasma glucose levels and 24-hour glucose profiles (Francois et al., 
2014;Gillen et al., 2012;Little et al., 2011) and HbA1c is more closely related to postprandial than 
fasting glucose levels (Ketema & Kibret, 2015). Another potential and even more likely explanation 
considering the short intervention could be the observed hemodilution. Hb and Hct decreased 
significantly after the training in the present study, probably due to increased plasma volume as 
typically observed after training. When Hb was added into the analysis as covariate the changes in 
HbA1c were no longer statistically significant. It is possible that at least a part of the decreases in 
HbA1c observed in previous studies with relatively short training interventions have been due to the 
same mechanism, but have not been considered.

Interestingly, despite the positive effects on whole body glucose metabolism, the training responses 
in VO2peak differed significantly between the groups (p=0.0495). While VO2peak improved after SIT, it 
remained essentially unchanged after MICT. This contrasts our previous findings of improved VO2peak 
after both SIT and MICT in healthy subjects (Eskelinen et al., 2015). The changes in VO2peak have been 
similar (about 5 – 7%) after two weeks of SIT in other studies with healthy individuals (Sloth et al., 
2013), but the results in HIIT studies in subjects with T2D or prediabetes have been variable. HIIT has 
increased VO2peak in these subjects similarly or even more than MICT, but the changes have not been 
statistically significant in all studies (Karstoft et al., 2013;Robinson et al., 2015;Terada et al., 2013). 
Taken together these findings suggest that although HIIT and MICT may not improve physical fitness 
(measured by VO2peak) as effectively in subjects with T2D as in healthy subjects, they both are very 
effective to rapidly improve whole body glucose metabolism.  
It is therefore not surprising that both HIIT and MICT increased remarkably the insulin-stimulated GU 
in the main working muscle, QF. It is fascinating that despite the pre-intervention QF GU in the 
present study was less than half of the QF GU of the healthy middle-aged men in the previous study 
(Eskelinen et al., 2015), after only two weeks of SIT training, QF GU was at the same level as in the 
healthy subjects at baseline (Eskelinen et al., 2015). In the MICT group the increase was slightly 
smaller and the post-training values in the subjects in the present study did not quite reach the 
baseline level in healthy subjects, but most probably after a few more weeks of training they would 
have reached the same level. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of exercise training, 
especially high intensity exercise, on skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Intriguingly, although 
impaired skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is only one of the manifestations of T2D, it is also one of 
the most important; and based on our findings in the present study, and supported by other studies 
(Hussey et al., 2012;Little et al., 2011;Perseghin et al., 1996), can easily be reversed with short 
training interventions.

Previously we did not observe any significant changes in the other muscles than QF in the healthy 
subjects. Here we show that the early training adaptations in subjects with type 2 diabetes or 
prediabetes are more widespread as GU increased also in the posterior thigh and arm muscles 
suggesting a more general whole-body response to exercise. It is generally known that lower physical 
fitness prior to exercise intervention can cause greater responses and this may also be one of the 
reasons of the more pronounced effects observed in the subjects in the present compared to the 
previous study. It has been also shown that people with diabetes are less physically active than the 
general population and the majority of people with diabetes or at high risk for developing T2D do not 
engage in regular physical activity (Morrato et al., 2007). Thus, even though the subjects in our 
present and previous study (Eskelinen et al., 2015) were both physically inactive at baseline, the 
subjects in the present study may have been even less physically active than the healthy subjects in 
the previous study, and may therefore have had larger capacity to increase GU.  
In concordance with the healthy subjects (Eskelinen et al., 2015), HIIT and MICT caused different 
responses in GU in the RF so that the increase was larger after HIIT than MICT. In the vasti muscles 
this was not observed corresponding to the findings in healthy subjects (Eskelinen et al., 2015). The 
possible explanations for these diverging responses between QF muscles were discussed in depth in 
the previous paper (Eskelinen et al., 2015). The most plausible explanation is that the biarticular RF is 
fully activated only by a certain amount of force production that is not reached during moderate 
intensity exercise. 
Previously, skeletal muscle FAU has been shown to be decreased in subjects  with glucose 
intolerance (Turpeinen et al., 1999) and T2D (Blaak et al., 2000) and on the other hand, not different 
between healthy untrained and trained subjects (Hannukainen et al., 2007). Also, in our previous 
study in healthy subjects two weeks of SIT or MICT did not change muscle FAU significantly 
(Eskelinen et al., 2015). However, in the present study, in subjects with T2D and prediabetes FAU 
increased significantly, but only in the main working muscle QF. It should be noted that although the

subjects in the present study were in the fasted state during the FTHA-PET study, the measured 
concentrations of glucose, FFA, and insulin during the study seemed to be lower than the fasting 
values reported in Table 1. Although we don’t have any direct evidence to that, the most likely 
explanation is that the measurements of myocardial perfusion, and especially infusion of adenosine, 
shortly before the FTHA-PET study has caused those decreased concentrations either by direct 
actions of adenosine on metabolism or indirectly by altered hormonal milieu by adenosine. 
Therefore the FAU results do not reflect complete fasting state situation. Nevertheless, the 
measurements were performed similarly in the both groups and before and after the training, 
making it possible to make a conclusion that reduced FAU in patients with T2D and prediabetes may 
be at least partly restored by intensive SIT as well as by MICT in the most active muscles. 
There are some limitations in this study. The study involved both male and female subjects, but the 
number of the subjects in both genders was so small that the possible gender differences in 
responses, as previously shown (Bagley et al., 2016), could not be reliably addressed. In addition, this 
study was performed in subjects with T2D or prediabetes (IGT and/or IFG) and the results cannot 
therefore be directly applied to other populations. However, as the results paralleled pretty well our 
previous findings in healthy subjects, it may be expected that the observed phenomena could be 
more general. Considering diabetes status (T2D/prediabetes) the groups were slightly uneven, even 
if the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Therefore gender and diabetes 
status were used as factors in the statistical analyses to remove any possible confounding effects. In 
the female subjects, the phase of the menstrual cycle or the incidence of menopause was not 
recorded or controlled during the study. Three of the ten female subjects were on menopausal 
hormone therapy. Thus the female population in this study was heterogeneous and that could have 
interfered with the results.

There were no serious adverse reactions to SIT or MICT in the present study. The subjects went 
through a thorough physical examination by an experienced physician before the intervention and no 
serious adverse event occurred during the intervention. One of the participants in the SIT group got a 
migraine headache episode during the first exercise session. The subject’s condition was carefully 
monitored and no serious consequences occurred. 
Taken together, in individuals with T2D or prediabetes, already a short-term SIT or MICT training 
intervention leads to remarkably increased GU both in the thigh and upper arm muscles as well as 
increased FAU in the main working muscle QF. These findings further underscore the still underused 
possibilities that exercise training has to restore impaired skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated glucose 
uptake, insulin sensitivity, and fatty acid uptake even in a very short time frame in subjects with 
metabolic impairments. 
 
PERSPECTIVE 
In the present study, the pre-intervention QF insulin-stimulated GU was less than half of the values 
observed in the healthy middle-aged men in our previous study (Eskelinen et al., 2015). Remarkably, 
after only two weeks of SIT it reached the same level as in the healthy subjects at the baseline 
(Eskelinen et al., 2015). In the MICT group the increase was smaller and the post-training values did 
not quite reach the baseline level of the healthy subjects. However, most probably after a few more 
weeks of training they would have reached the same level. These findings emphasize the 
effectiveness of exercise training, especially high intensity exercise, in restoring impaired skeletal 
muscle glucose uptake that is one of the key disturbances in the subjects with metabolic disorders.

The results are presented as model-based means (95% CI). Group p-value indicates whether there is a level difference between the groups, time p-value displays the mean 
change between pre- and post-measurements and group x time p-value indicates whether the mean changes are different between groups. PET, positron emission 
tomography; SIT, sprint interval training; MICT, moderate intensity continuous training; FTHA, 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid study; FDG, 2-deoxy-2-
(18F)fluoro-D-glucose study; FFA, plasma free fatty acid concentration. The FTHA study was conducted in the fasting state and the FDG study was conducted under 
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Significant differences are printed in boldface.

Fig. 1. Skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (A, B, C, D) and free fatty acid uptake in the 
fasting state (E, F, G, H) in thigh- (A, B, E, F) and upper arm (C, D, G, H) muscles. Open dots show the 
results of the SIT group and black dots the results of the MICT group before and after the 
intervention presented as model-based means with 95% confidence interval. Group p-value indicates 
whether there is a level difference between the groups, time p-value displays the mean change 
between pre- and post-measurements and group x time p-value indicates whether the mean changes 
are different between groups. GU, glucose uptake; FAU, fatty acid uptake; QF, quadriceps femoris; 
Ham, hamstrings; Bic, biceps brachii; Tri, triceps brachii. 
Fig. 2. Skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (A, B, C, D) and free fatty acid uptake in the 
fasting state (E, F G, H) in the four heads of the quadriceps femoris. Open dots show the results of 
the SIT group and black dots the results of the MICT group before and after the intervention 
presented as model-based means with 95% confidence interval. Group p-value indicates whether 
there is a level difference between the groups, time p-value displays the mean change between pre- 
and post-measurements and group x time p-value indicates whether the mean changes are different 
between groups. * SIT p<0.001 for the time effect, MICT p=0.015 for the time effect, pre-intervention 
difference between groups p=0.31, postintervention difference between groups p=0.016. GU,
