Abstract
Objectives: The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) plays a pivotal role in cluster headache (CH) pathophysiology as the
major efferent parasympathetic relay. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of SPG stimulation in medically refrac-
tory, chronic CH patients.
Methods: Thirty-three patients were enrolled in an open-label follow-up study of the original Pathway CH-1 study, and
participated through 24 months post-insertion of a microstimulator. Response to therapy was defined as acute effect-
iveness in � 50% of attacks or a � 50% reduction in attack frequency versus baseline.
Results: In total, 5956 attacks (180.5 � 344.8, range 2–1581 per patient) were evaluated. At 24 months, 45% (n ¼ 15) of
patients were acute responders. Among acute responders, a total of 4340 attacks had been treated, and in 78% of these,
effective therapy was achieved using only SPG stimulation (relief from moderate or greater pain or freedom from mild
pain or greater). A frequency response was observed in 33% (n ¼ 11) of patients with a mean reduction of attack
frequency of 83% versus baseline. In total, 61% (20/33) of all patients were either acute or frequency responders or both.
The majority maintained their therapeutic response through the 24-month evaluation.
Conclusions: In the population of disabled, medically refractory chronic CH patients treated in this study, SPG stimu-
lation is an effective acute therapy in 45% of patients, offering sustained effectiveness over 24 months of observation. In
addition, a maintained, clinically relevant reduction of attack frequency was observed in a third of patients. These long-
term data provide support for the use of SPG stimulation for disabled patients and should be considered after medical
treatments fail, are not tolerated or are inconvenient for the patients.

Introduction
Cluster headache (CH), one of the most excruciating
primary headaches, has unilateral pain occurring up
to eight times daily and lasting 15–180 minutes (1).
Both disability and impairment are high and lead to
reduced quality of life (2,3). Abortive (subcutaneous
and nasal triptans or oxygen) and preventative treat-
ments (verapamil, lithium, topiramate, corticosteroids
or greater occipital nerve injections) (4,5) tend to be less
effective in the considerable proportion of patients with
the chronic subtype. Treatment in this subpopulation
may also be complicated by systemic side effects limit-
ing the efficacy of these therapies. This can result in
continued high disability and substantial direct and

 indirect costs (6,7). Additional therapies are needed for
this difficult-to-treat condition.
Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) neuromodulation
offers a minimally invasive, targeted option without
dose restrictions or systemic side effects. Typical
adverse effects are mild and transient and include sen-
sory effects, pain and swelling associated with the
microstimulator insertion procedure (8). The SPG is
part of the neural reflex responsible for CH pain patho-
physiology. For over 100 years, it has been targeted via
pharmacological blocks (9), alcohol injection (10), cor-
ticosteroid and/or local anaesthetic injections (11) and
radiofrequency ablation (12). Acute electrical SPG neu-
romodulation has shown promising results for treating
CH (13), and an implantable, on-demand SPG micro-
stimulator was developed and tested in a randomised
controlled multicentre study in chronic CH (cCH) (the
Pathway CH-1 study) (14). Significant acute pain relief
or freedom at 15 minutes was achieved in 67.1% of
attacks treated with full stimulation, compared to
only 7.1% in sham stimulation (p < 0.0001). A total
of 68% experienced a clinically significant improve-
ment, achieving pain relief in �50% of full stimula-
tion-treated
attacks
and/or
experiencing
a � 50%
reduction in attack frequency in the double-blinded
experimental period (ending approximately 6 months
following microstimulator insertion) versus baseline
(14). The objective of this analysis is to characterise
the long-term outcomes in cCH patients who agreed
to be followed for 24 months after microstimulator
insertion. Outcomes include the acute and frequency
response to SPG stimulation, improvements in head-
ache disability and preventative medication usage.
Methods
In the original Pathway CH-1 study, the initial inclu-
sion criterion was cCH and dissatisfaction with current
headache treatments (14). However, all study sites
included only patients who were medically refractory
according to the consensus criteria published before
(15). Patients underwent trans-oral insertion of a
microstimulator such that the stimulating electrodes
were placed proximate to the SPG. Additional insertion
details have previously been published (14,16). In the
Pathway CH-1 study, patients were followed for
12 months after microstimulator insertion. Initially,
the efficacy of SPG stimulation was evaluated in a
randomised
controlled
experimental
period
(14).
During the remaining part of the first 12 months,
patients had the opportunity to use the therapy in an
open-label period. A separate long-term follow-up
study was initiated so that these patients could be fol-
lowed beyond the first 12 months (Figure 1). Open-
label results, including both data from open-label use
during the first 12 months (Pathway CH-1) and data
from the long-term follow-up through to 24 months
post-insertion, are presented for all patients enrolled
in the long-term follow-up study.
Patient selection
Patient selection criteria for the long-term follow-up
study included participation in the Pathway CH-1
study, continued microstimulator implantation, previous
compliance with study protocol and written informed
consent. Reasons for not being enrolled included non-
compliance to the Pathway CH-1 protocol, unwilling-
ness to follow the protocol or a lack of signed informed
consent.
SPG Microstimulator System
The
SPG
Microstimulator
System
(Pulsante�
Microstimulator
System,
Autonomic
Technologies,
Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) is designed to fit the
facial anatomy with an integrated lead placed proxim-
ate to the SPG. The microstimulator communicates
with a handheld remote controller by radio-waves and
is inductively powered, and as such contains no battery
(14). Using the remote controller, patients apply on-
demand SPG stimulation to treat the acute pain of
their cluster attacks. Apart from instructions on how
to use the remote controller, patients were advised to
treat attacks early, defined as ‘as soon as the patient felt
a CH attack’.
Data collection. Acute response to SPG stimulation was
captured prospectively in an electronic headache diary
incorporated into the remote controller. Pain scores are
reported
using
the
Categorical
Pain
Scale
(CPS;
0 ¼ none, 1 ¼ mild, 2 ¼ moderate, 3 ¼ severe, 4 ¼ very
severe). Headache pain was reported prior to stimula-
tion use and headache pain and acute medication use

 were reported at either 15 minutes following the start of
stimulation (through the first 12 months post-insertion)
or immediately following cessation of each SPG stimu-
lation (between 12 and 24 months post-insertion) as
appropriate.
Average cluster attack frequency over past 4 weeks,
preventative medications and headache disability were
captured prior to microstimulator insertion and again
at each study visit using case report forms, which were
monitored.
Outcomes and analyses. The primary objective of this
analysis was to characterise the therapeutic response
to SPG stimulation at 24 months. Per the protocol,
the therapeutic response was calculated as a responder
analysis, or the percentage of patients experiencing an
acute abortive effect from SPG stimulation, a preventa-
tive effect from SPG stimulation or both. Acute and
frequency responses are described in detail below.
Acute effectiveness (referred to as effective therapy)
is pain relief (decrease in CPS score from 2 (moderate)
or greater to 1 (mild) or 0 (none) without the use of
acute
medications)
or
pain
freedom
(CPS
score
decreased from 1 (mild) or greater to 0 (none) without
the use of acute medications) following SPG stimula-
tion. These analyses include all SPG stimulation
attempts
during
the
open-label
period
(following
the randomised controlled period through to the
24-month follow-up visit) with completed electronic
headache diary data. Attacks were evaluated at the
per-protocol evaluation point (15 minutes following
the start of stimulation or immediately following the
cessation of stimulation). Acute response was defined
as effective therapy in at least 50% of evaluable attacks
occurring during the open-label period and through to
the 24-month study visit.
The cluster attack frequency was recorded as the
average number of attacks per week over the prior
4 weeks. Frequency response was defined as at least a
50% reduction in cluster attack frequency at the
24-month study visit as compared to baseline.
Therapeutic
response
to
SPG
stimulation
was
defined as acute response and/or frequency response
(for a detailed definition, see above). As an additional
analysis, therapeutic response was evaluated and char-
acterised at the 12- and 18-month study visits.
Additional protocol pre-specified analyses included
characterisation of use of preventative medications and
headache disability at the 24-month study visit as com-
pared to baseline. Changes in preventative medication
use were characterised, identifying those patients who
stopped, decreased dose, remained off or added/
increased doses of preventative medications.
Headache disability improvements were evaluated
using the headache-impact test (HIT-6) questionnaire
and were considered clinically meaningful if scores
improved by at least 2.3 units relative to baseline (17).
A paired t-test was used to account for changes over
time, with p < 0.05 regarded as a statistically significant
difference between baseline and the 24-month study
visit.
Any missing data for frequency analyses, use of pre-
ventative medications and headache disability were
imputed from the respective preceding study visit.
A post-hoc exploratory analysis was performed in
order to evaluate acute medication use for SPG stimu-
lation-treated attacks, with data collected in conjunc-
tion
with
headache
pain
ratings
on
the
remote
controller. An additional post-hoc exploratory analysis
was performed in order to evaluate the percentage of
patients achieving a therapeutic response for either an
acute or preventative effect of >30% and >75%,
respectively.
Results
Patient disposition, demographics and clinical
characteristics
Forty-three medically refractory cCH patients with a
minimum of four attacks per week were enrolled into
the Pathway CH-1 study from six European centres. Of
these, 33 patients were enrolled into the long-term
follow-up study at five centres (Figure 2). Of the ten
patients not eligible for enrolment into the long-term
follow-up study, four did not meet the inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria as they no longer had implanted neurosti-
mulators, one was not eligible because the extended
follow-up study was not initiated at their site and five
were not eligible for previous protocol non-compliance.
Of the five non-compliant patients, four were frequency
responders during the open-label period of the Pathway
CH-1 study (for further details, please see Figure 2 and
Table 1).
All 33 patients in this analysis completed the follow-
up through to 24 months. The open-label period began
at 156 � 66 days post-insertion. Average time in the
open-label period through to the 24-month study visit
was 594 � 81 days. Patient characteristics are provided
in Table 2.
Acute response. Across all 33 patients, a total of 5956
attacks were treated, of which 65% achieved effective
therapy (3849/5956), with a total of 50% (2958/5956)
becoming pain free (see Figure 3). On average, each
patient treated 181 � 345 (range 2–1581) CH attacks
that were evaluable for the analysis (see Figure 4).
The average duration of stimulation was 11.2 � 8.4
minutes (range 0.1–61.5 minutes). In 4682 of 5956
attacks (79%), patients did not report the use of

 acute medication. These attacks included both the 3849
that achieved effective therapy and an additional 833
attacks that did not meet the definition of effective ther-
apy as pain was not reduced to mild or none, but in
which acute medications were not reported as being
used. A total of 45% of patients (15/33) were acute
responders, achieving effective therapy in at least 50%
of their evaluable attacks. These acute responders each
treated, on average, 289 � 471 (range 2–1581) attacks
and obtained effective therapy in 78% (3387/4340) of
those attacks. Furthermore, nearly half of all acute
responders experienced a very strong response to ther-
apy, achieving the ability to treat at least 75% of their
attacks effectively. A total of 73% of all patients (24/33)
were able to effectively treat at least 30% of their
attacks.
Attack frequency. Thirty-one patients had complete data
sets at both baseline and 24 months. Two patients had
missing frequency data at 24 months that were not able
to be imputed. A total of 35% of these patients (11/31)
were frequency responders at the 24-month study visit,
experiencing at least a 50% reduction in attack
frequency relative to baseline. These 11 patients experi-
enced an 83% average reduction in frequency at 24
months compared to baseline (average attack frequen-
cies at baseline and 24 months were 18 � 13 attacks/
week and 3 � 4 attacks/week, respectively). Six of the
11 frequency responders were also acute responders,
achieving effective therapy in greater than 50% of
attacks treated. Two frequency responders reported
no cluster attacks at the 24-month visit, effectively con-
verting from cCH to episodic CH, and the majority of
frequency responders (8/11) experienced a frequency

quency responders reduced (n ¼ 3) or stopped (n ¼ 4)
their preventative medication.
In the entire population, the average attack fre-
quency at these two time points was unchanged
(17 � 3 (range 5–70) and 17 � 15 (range 0–50) attacks
per week, respectively). In 29% of patients (9/31),
attack frequency did not change significantly (< 50%
change in either direction); 35% of patients (11/31)
experienced an increase in attack frequency of at least
50% (see Figure 5).
A total of 40% of the frequency non-responders
were acute responders and 65% experienced improve-
ments in preventative medications (stopped all medica-
tion (n ¼ 5), stopped some medication (n ¼ 2), remained
off
(n ¼ 4)
and
experienced
clinical
improvement
(n ¼ 2)).
Therapeutic response. This study of a novel neuromodu-
lation therapy for severe headache is the first to show
both acute effects and a reduction of headache fre-
quency in an open-label cohort. Therefore, therapeutic
response (i.e., acute and/or frequency effectiveness) as a
novel outcome was considered (14).
At 24 months, 61% of patients experienced a thera-
peutic response to SPG stimulation (acute effectiveness
and/or frequency reduction of at least 50%), and more
than 80% of patients had a therapeutic response of at
least 30%. Furthermore, the majority of therapeutic
responders were considered as very strong (�75%)
responders to SPG stimulation therapy (Figure 6).
This group was able to effectively treat at least 75%
of their attacks, to experience a reduction in attack fre-
quency of at least 75% compared to baseline, or both.
Effectiveness over time. Individual patient responses at
each time point are provided, and the majority of
patients maintained their response at 18 through to
24 months (Figure 7). Total effectiveness was stable,

and
patient
satisfaction. HIT-6 headache disability was clinically
and significantly reduced by 4.8 points compared to
baseline disability (n ¼ 29; p ¼ 0.0048). Four patients
did not complete the HIT-6 survey at their 24-month
clinic visit. Of these, one patient missing a HIT-6 survey
was an acute responder. A total of 55% of patients
(16/29) who completed headache disability surveys
were considered HIT-6 responders (clinically meaning-
ful change is a reduction of at least 2.3 points).

experienced
a
reduction
in
headache disability of 12.6 � 6.7, patients with both

experienced
a
reduction in headache disability of 11.2 � 8.8, acute
responders experienced a reduction in headache disabil-
ity of 1.9 � 4.8 and non-responders experienced an
increase in headache disability of 0.4 � 6.9. The only
groups to experience clinically meaningful changes in
headache disability relative to baseline were the group
of patients with only frequency responses and those
with both acute and frequency responses. Non-respon-
ders remained effectively unchanged in terms of head-
ache disability relative to baseline.
Regarding patient satisfaction, 69% of those that
responded to the survey (18/26) indicated that they
found SPG stimulation useful for treating their head-
aches at the 24-month follow-up.
Preventative medication changes from baseline. A total of
64% (21/33) of patients experienced clinical improve-
ments in their preventative medication use at 24 months
compared to baseline. Specifically, nine stopped all
preventative medications. Six stopped or decreased
the doses of their medications (one stopped two medi-
cations, one stopped two medications and reduced the
dose of a third, two stopped one medication, one
stopped one medication and reduced the dose of a
second and one decreased the dose of two medications).
Furthermore, two had clinically beneficial medication
adjustments (change in type of preventative medication
that was assessed by the clinician as an improvement or
reduction from the baseline mediation regimen), and
four who were not using any preventative medications
at baseline remained free of preventative medication at
the 24-month study visit. Of these 21 patients with clin-
ical improvements in preventative medication use,

Cephalalgia 37(5)
 67% (14/21) experienced at least a 50% acute or fre-
quency response or indicated that they found SPG
stimulation useful. Further details on changes in pre-
ventative medication, including therapeutic responses
at 24 months, are provided in Table 3.
Complications. The side effects, which are described in
detail in a prior publication (8), are mainly surgical
sequelae occurring during the peri-operative period
(within 30 days post-operation) in 81% patients, and
typically include sensory disturbances, post-operative
pain and swelling. These post-insertion side effects
were typically mild to moderate, and resolved within
2–3 months (68 days on average, range 0–312 days) (8).
Contralateral attacks. During the course of the 24-month
study, 11 out of 33 patients (33%) reported the occur-
rence of cluster attacks contralateral to the side of their
inserted microstimulator. Five of these reported a his-
tory of contralateral attacks in the 6-month period
before the insertion. Of the six patients with no history
in the immediate 6 months prior to microstimulator
insertion, one experienced a nominal number of contra-
lateral attacks (�1% of all attacks), two experienced
contralateral attacks for 1–1.5 months only, two experi-
enced a combination of ipsilateral and contralateral
attacks for 3.5 and 6 months only and one continued
to experience 5–10% of their attacks contralaterally
through to the 24-month study visit.
Discussion
In a population of 33 medically refractory cCH patients
followed for 24 months while receiving on-demand
SPG stimulation, we found sustained effectiveness for
acute attack pain relief and attack frequency reductions
in a subgroup of patients. At 24 months, 45% of
patients were acute responders and 35% were fre-
quency responders. As this study was the first neuro-
modulation study in CH in which both acute and
frequency effects were observed, a novel endpoint
(therapeutic response) was used. According to this
novel endpoint, 61% of patients experienced a thera-
peutic response. A total of 64% of patients reduced,
stopped or remained off all preventative medications.
Mean headache disability improved, with 55% of
patients considered to be HIT-6 responders and 69%
of the 26 patients responding to the survey indicating
that they found SPG stimulation useful for treating
their headaches.
Previously published data from the sham-controlled
experimental
period
in the
Pathway CH-1
study
showed a 68% therapeutic responder rate (acute and/
or frequency) for SPG stimulation (14). Compared to
these results with similar proportions of acute and fre-
quency responders, the present study shows a main-
tained effectiveness in the majority of patients over
time, indicating that the acute and/or attack frequency
reduction benefit is robust, stable and is likely not
attributable to the implant procedure itself (i.e., a sur-
gical response).
An at least 50% improvement is routinely used in
the headache literature to define a responder (18).
However, a 30% threshold for the definition of fre-
quency response has been suggested to be appropriate
for trials in chronic migraine and in chronic tension-
type headache (19,20). As cCH patients experience very

 and particularly as only medically refractory patients
were included in this study, this threshold may be
appropriate here as well. Although not predefined in
the protocol, if such criteria were applied to our data-
set, more than 80% of the included patients achieved
clinical benefit at the 30% responder level in the speci-
fied period. Further support includes the fact that 64%
of the patients had a meaningful reduction in use of
preventative medication use and/or minimised acute
therapy, despite some of these patients not falling into
the 50% or 75% responder categories. SPG stimulation
is the only form of neurostimulation that elicits both an
acute and a preventative effect (21). These therapeutic
effects of SPG stimulation were quite dramatic, with the
majority of responders being able to treat at least 75%
of their attacks and/or experiencing a reduction in
attack frequency of at least 75%. Furthermore, two
of these cCH patients were no longer having cluster
attacks at the 24-month study visit, and effectively con-
verted from cCH to episodic CH.
The field of neurostimulation is highly dynamic and
evolving, and yet there are no official guidelines for the
study design. At the time of conception of the original
Pathway CH-1 study, preventative effects of SPG
stimulation were not anticipated, and thus the design
was not ideally tuned to capture this information.
Furthermore, the question of how to interpret both
acute and preventative responses is open to discussion.
The authors believe that a meaningful therapeutic
response that is not exclusively focused on an acute
or preventative effect should be considered as an add-
itional outcome in future studies.
SPG stimulation may offer some unique benefits.
For example, in contrast to triptans, there are no quan-
titative limits to SPG stimulation therapy, and no
reported cardiovascular or systemic side effects thus
far. Furthermore, the stigmatisation and logistical
hassle of using and transporting oxygen canisters can
be avoided.
However, SPG stimulation itself is not without side
effects, and whenever patients are subjected to surgical
procedures,
due
caution
must
be
exercised.
As
expected, the majority of reported side effects have
been associated with the insertion procedure itself.
These are mostly mild to moderate, and most resolve
within 2–3 months. The sequelae are comparable to
oral cavity interventions (22,23). These data have
been published separately (8).
It is nevertheless important to note that at the
24-month visit, a third (11/33) of patients experienced
an increase in attack frequency of >50% compared to
the 1-month baseline period. In the design of future
studies, it will be necessary to take the frequency com-
ponent of the response into consideration and record
frequency continuously during the entire study so that

 both increases and decreases in frequency can be better
evaluated.
Furthermore, the issue of contralateral attacks is
often raised with regards to neurostimulation, but the
underlying mechanisms are as yet unknown. However,
peripheral intervention in CH is likely to change
the side of the attack if the intervention is positive
(i.e., effective) (24). Reports on the prevalence of
contralateral attacks in CH are sparse and based on
retrospective analyses (25). Furthermore, single contra-
lateral attacks probably occur more frequently than
permanent side-shifts. In our population, 11 patients
reported contralateral attacks in the 24-month period.
We note that of these patients, nearly half of them had
a history of contralateral attacks prior to the insertion
of the SPG microstimulator.
Therefore, further studies are needed in order to
better
understand
the
occurrence
of
contralateral
attacks, as well as the predictors of acute and frequency
responses.
Strengths and limitations
These data represent the largest currently published
prospective cohort of patients and attacks in CH. The
data set is substantial and unique, encompassing nearly
6000 consecutively recorded attacks in medically refrac-
tory and highly disabled patients. It is exceptional in
that all patients remained in the study through to
24 months.
As data on attack frequency were collected retro-
spectively, a recall bias cannot be excluded. In the
study’s second year, frequency data were not collected
continuously
and
thus
required
imputation.
Nevertheless, the data suggest that a subset of patients
experienced significant reductions in attack frequency.
An even larger proportion of these severely affected
patients demonstrated acute responses, the majority
of which achieved pain freedom. A longer baseline
period of at least 2–3 months could have reflected the
undulating natural course of the headaches and the side
locations more adequately. However, a baseline of 4
weeks is commonly used (26,27), and our included
patients had long histories of enduring, chronic and
medically refractory CH.
The mean attack frequencies at baseline and after
24 months were similar. However, it must be recognised
that there is a dilemma of skewed ratings: improve-
ments cannot fall below 0% (corresponding to a max-
imum improvement of 100%), yet an increased attack
frequency may exceed 100%. Thus, a few patients with
large increases in attack frequency can severely skew
the analysis, and data should be evaluated on an indi-
vidual basis. In light of these observations and the fact
that the study investigated a highly selected, refractory
patient population that was dissatisfied with previous
treatment attempts, the authors believe that the acute
and preventative results found in a subgroup of patients
in this study represent a valid, positive signal.
Conclusion
In an open-label, 24-month follow-up study in 33 med-
ically refractory cCH patients, we found that SPG
stimulation may be an effective treatment. The long-
term effects on frequency response and the occurrence
of contralateral attacks should be investigated further.
Overall, the effect of SPG stimulation is maintained in
the long term, and preventative medications can be
tapered or stopped.
Clinical implications
. A sustained effect of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation at 24-month follow-up is demonstrated in
a subset of patients.
. A total of 45% of medically refractory chronic cluster headache (cCH) patients have an acute effect in 50%
or more of their attacks.
. A total of 35% of medically refractory cCH patients have a 50% or higher reduction in their attack
frequency.
. A total of 61% are therapeutic responders to SPG stimulation therapy.
. SPG stimulation is a fairly safe treatment alternative for patients with medically refractory cCH.
