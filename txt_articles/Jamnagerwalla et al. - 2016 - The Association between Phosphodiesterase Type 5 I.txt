Abstract
Purpose—Despite the routine use of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) for treatment 
of erectile dysfunction, their role in prostate cancer (PC) chemoprevention remains unclear with 
only a few studies exploring the link between PDE-5i use and PC. We tested the association 
between PDE-5i use and PC risk in the REDUCE study.
Materials & Methods—REDUCE was a four-year multi-center study testing the effect of daily 
dutasteride on PC risk in men with a PSA of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL and a negative biopsy, with men 
undergoing study-mandated biopsies at 2- and 4-years. The association between PDE-5i use and 
overall PC risk and disease grade (Gleason 2–6 and 7–10) was examined using adjusted logistic 
and multinomial regression analysis. Secondary analysis was performed exploring the association 
between PDE-5i use and PC risk in North American men given the significantly higher use of 
PDE-5i among these subjects.
Results—PDE-5i inhibitor use was not associated with PC diagnosis (OR=0.90, 95%CI 0.68–
1.20, p=0.476) or low- (OR=0.93, 95%CI 0.67–1.27, p=0.632) or high-grade disease (OR=0.85, 
95%CI 0.51–1.39, p=0.508). An inverse trend was seen between PDE-5i use and PC diagnosis in 
North American men, but was not statistically significant (OR=0.67, 95%CI 0.42–1.07, p=0.091).
Conclusions—PDE-5i use was not associated with decreased PC diagnosis in post-hoc analysis 
of the REDUCE study. In North American men, who had a much higher baseline use of PDE-5i,

INTRODUCTION
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major problem with a prevalence of 20–40% in the 6th decade 
of life and approaching 75% in the 7th decade1. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors 
(PDE-5i) were first introduced in 1998 and since then their durability, safety, and efficacy 
for treating ED have been clearly demonstrated2–4.
In mouse models, PDE-5i have anti-neoplastic effects via down-regulating myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs)5. Given the routine use of PDE-5i for patients with ED after 
prostatectomy and the possibility that these agents may have anti-cancer activity, three 
recent studies examined PDE-5i use and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after prostatectomy 
and/or radiation with conflicting results: one found patients who routinely used PDE-5i post-
operatively had a higher BCR rate6, while two others found no association between post-
operative PDE-5i use and BCR7, 8. Beyond prostatectomy patients, only one other study 
explored the association between PDE-5i use and diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC)9, finding 
that men on PDE-5i had a lower chance of being diagnosed with PC. The study was limited, 
however, in that all men had baseline ED, men did not have study-mandated biopsies, and 
there with significant differences in baseline characteristics such as PSA that influenced 
biopsy decisions.
We explored the association between PDE-5i use and PC diagnosis using the REDUCE 
dataset. REDUCE was a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of 
dutasteride on PC diagnosis among men who had a negative pre-study biopsy. The strength 
of REDUCE is all men were required to undergo protocol-mandated biopsies at 2 and 4 
years regardless of PSA and thus, cancer ascertainment was uniform in all men. 
Furthermore, we adjusted for exact PSA levels and other characteristics including erectile 
function as men in REDUCE had baseline potency data recorded. Based upon the basic 
science linking PDE-5i and anti-cancer activity, we hypothesized that PDE-5i would be 
associated with decreased PC detection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
REDUCE was a four-year multicenter, double-blind trial randomizing men to placebo or 0.5 
mg of daily dutasteride10. Eligibility criteria included men 50–75 years old, PSA of 2.5–
10.0ng/ml if 50–60 years or 3.0–10.0ng/ml if >60 years, and a single negative study-
independent prostate biopsy (6–12) cores within 6 months prior to enrollment. Exclusion 
criteria included men with a past history of PC, prostate surgery, prostate volume >80ml, or 
IPSS >25 or >20 on alpha-blockers. Ten-core trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate

 biopsies were performed at 2- and 4-years post randomization regardless of PSA. A central 
pathologist reviewed all slides. Baseline prostate volume was obtained using the TRUS and 
digital rectal examination (DRE) findings were reported from the pre-study biopsy. PSA was 
obtained at enrollment and every six months thereafter. PDE-5i use including tadalafil, 
sildenafil, and vardenafil, medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes, and height 
and weight were recorded at enrollment. Race was self-reported. Patients also completed 
questionnaires assessing sexual function using the PAS-SFI11, with self-reported impotence 
assessed by the treating physician at baseline.
Participants
Among 8,122 men enrolled in the efficacy population of REDUCE, we excluded 1,391 who 
received no on-study biopsies. Of 6,731 men with at least one on-study biopsy, we further 
excluded men with missing baseline data for BMI (n=97), PSA (n=13), DRE (n=7), TRUS 
prostate volume (n=70), smoking history (n=3), CAD history (n=2), PC family history 
(n=4), diabetes (n=1) or baseline impotence (n=33) resulting in 6,501 men (Figure 1). There 
were no significant differences in baseline PSA, DRE, age, CAD, prostate volume, family 
history of PC, body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) or use of PDE-5i between men who received 
at least one biopsy during the study versus those who did not. Non-white race (p=0.001), 
North American location (p<0.001), current smokers (p=0.038), impotence (p=0.010), and 
being assigned to the placebo arm (p=0.008) were all predictive of not receiving any on-
study biopsy.
Statistical Analysis
The association between baseline PDE-5i use and baseline clinical characteristics was 
examined using t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, or χ2 for continuous normal, continuous non-
normal and categorical variables, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to 
explore the relationship between PDE-5i use and PC diagnosis at any point during the study. 
Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age (continuous), race (white vs. non-white), 
geographic region (Europe, North America, other), baseline PSA (continuous), prostate 
volume (continuous), DRE findings (abnormal vs. normal), BMI (continuous), PC family 
history (yes/no), CAD (yes/no), smoking (current, former, and never), impotence (yes/no), 
diabetes (yes/no), and treatment group (placebo vs. dutasteride). Detailed questionnaires 
about sexual function (PAS-SFI) were available, but results were unchanged when adjusting 
for the numeric score from the questionnaire vs. the dichotomous impotence variable. As 
some men (n=555) were missing questionnaire data, we adjusted for the impotence variable 
instead.
To assess the association between PDE-5i use and disease grade we used a multinomial 
logistic regression with the outcomes of low-grade (Gleason ≤6 vs. no cancer) and high-
grade (Gleason 7–10 vs. no cancer). Results were adjusted for the same variables as above. 
Given large geographic differences in PDE-5i use and potential difference due to dutasteride 
use, we tested whether region or randomization group (placebo vs. dutasteride) was an effect 
modifier on the association between PDE-5i use and PC by including both primary variables 
and a cross-product in the multivariable analysis with a Wald test to determine the p-value.

 Given the possibility that PDE-5i use was related to biopsy compliance, which could affect 
PC detection, we explored the association between PDE-5i use and PC at the 2-year study-
mandated biopsy.
Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. All analysis was performed using Stata v13.1 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX USA).
RESULTS
Patient demographics
Of the 6,501 men, 364 (5.6%) used PDE-5i at baseline. Men on PDE-5i had higher BMIs 
(p<0.001), lower PSAs (p<0.001), and a higher rate of baseline diabetes (p=0.029) (table 1). 
They were also more likely to have an abnormal DRE (p=0.001), be impotent (p<0.001) and 
be from North America (p<0.001). No differences were observed between PDE-5i use and 
age, smoking, race, CAD, PC family history, prostate volume, or treatment arm (all p-
values≥0.05).
Study compliance
PDE-5i use was not significantly predictive of receiving any on-study biopsy over the entire 
study period. However, among men with a negative 2-year biopsy, PDE-5i users were more 
likely to receive the 4-year biopsy after adjusting for clinical and demographic features 
(OR=1.57, 95%CI 1.11–2.22, p=0.011).
PDE-5i use and PC
The rate of PC diagnosis during the study was 19.5% (71/364) for men on PDE-5i vs. 22.7% 
(1,391/6,137) for men not on PDE-5i. Though PDE-5i use was associated with lower PC 
detection, this did not reach statistical significance on univariable (OR=0.83, 95%CI 0.63–
1.08, p=0.161) or multivariable analysis (OR=0.90, 95%CI 0.68–1.20, p=0.478). When 
examined by grade, PDE-5i use was unrelated to both low-grade and high-grade cancer on 
univariable and multivariable analysis (all p>0.05, table 2). Results were unchanged whether 
high-grade was defined as Gleason ≥7(4+3) or ≥8 (data not shown).
Interaction between PDE-5i use and region for predicting PC
Given the significantly higher PDE-5i use in North American, subset analysis was 
performed comparing North American men with other regions. Among North American 
men, those on PDE-5i tended to have a lower risk of overall PC that approached but did not 
reach significance (multivariable OR=0.67, p=0.091; table 3). When stratified by disease 
grade, the inverse association between PDE-5i use was stronger for high-grade (OR=0.42, 
p=0.076) than low-grade (OR=0.78, p=0.351), though neither association reached statistical 
significance on univariable or multivariable analysis. The interaction between region and 
PDE-5i use was not significant for either overall PC risk (p=0.101), or when stratified by 
grade (p≥0.217). Among non-North American patients, PDE-5i use was unrelated to all 
outcomes (all p>0.6; table 3).

 Interaction between PDE-5i use and treatment arm for predicting PC
As dutasteride use may influence the effect of PDE-5i use on PC risk, we explored whether 
results were similar in men treated with placebo or dutasteride. We found treatment arm 
(placebo vs. dutasteride) was not a significant effect modifier (p=0.974) meaning results 
were similar in both arms.
PDE-5i use and PC on 2-year biopsy
As men on PDE-5i were slightly more likely to receive a 4-year biopsy, we tested the 
association between PDE-5i and PC at the 2-year study-mandated biopsy to eliminate any 
bias present from higher biopsy rates among PDE-5i users. Results were similar to the 
overall cohort: no significant association between PDE-5i use and overall PC or high-grade/
low-grade disease (table 4).
DISCUSSION
PDE-5i have anti-cancer effects in-vitro via mediation of apoptosis12, 13 and modulation of 
MDSCs5. However, in humans, data are mixed with some studies showing PDE-5i use 
associated with increased BCR6, no change in BCR7, longer PSA doubling time after BCR14 
and lower PC diagnosis9. Herein, we investigated the association between PDE-5i use and 
PC detection in REDUCE, wherein men with a negative baseline biopsy underwent study-
mandated biopsies at 2- and 4-years. We found PDE-5i use was not associated with PC 
diagnosis. While there was a suggestion of an inverse association in North American men, 
this did not reach statistical significance. While these findings do not support PDE-5i for PC 
chemoprevention, they do not demonstrate any increased PC diagnosis associated with 
PDE-5i use.
PDE-5i were first introduced in 1998, quickly gaining widespread popularity due to their 
efficacy and minimal side effects4. Given data that other commonly used medicines may be 
associated with lower PC risk15, 16 and the high frequency of PDE-5i use in older men (i.e. 
those at greatest risk for PC), several studies examined the relationship between PDE-5i use 
and PC with conflicting results. Among 4,752 patients treated with radical prostatectomy, 
post-operative PDE-5i use was associated with increased BCR risk (HR=1.38; 95%CI: 1.11–
1.70)6. In contrast, a similar study of 2,579 patients showed no significant association 
between PDE-5i use and BCR after prostatectomy, even after adjusting for number of pills 
taken or treatment type (on demand use vs. prophylactic daily use) (HR=1.18, 95%CI: 0.85–
1.63)7. Similarly no association was seen between overall PDE-5i use and BCR in a recent 
case-control series matching 293 patients who had BCR after prostatectomy or radiation to 
BCR-free controls. Limitations of these studies include the retrospective nature of analysis 
and potential inherent differences between patient’s requiring PDE-5i post operatively vs. 
those who do not (i.e. differences in extent of nerve sparing dissection dictated by tumor 
aggressiveness). Also, these studies evaluated PC progression, not cancer diagnosis and 
some drugs may work better to block progression vs. cancer development17.
In regards to PDE-5i use and cancer risk, several studies have shown an association between 
PDE-5i use and increased risk of melanoma; however these associations may be due to

 shared lifestyle factors as PDE-5i users may be more likely have a lifestyle placing them at 
higher risk for melanoma18, 19. Specific to PC risk, only one study to date has examined this 
issue. Among 4,974 men with baseline ED seen between 2000 and 2006 in the US, the 
authors found men on PDE-5i had a 60% reduced risk of PC during the study (OR=0.4; 
95%CI: 0.3–0.5)9. However analysis was limited as men on PDE-5i had significantly lower 
PSAs, not all men received biopsies, and results were not adjusted for PSA. Furthermore, 
PDE-5i use was lower in 2000 than in 2006 creating concerns about differential follow-up in 
that PDE-5i users may not have been followed long enough. To overcome these limitations, 
we examined the association between PDE-5i use and PC diagnosis among men who all had 
negative baseline biopsies and underwent study-mandated biopsies at 2- and 4-years in 
REDUCE. Furthermore, we adjusted for key baseline differences between the groups, 
including PSA. In so doing, we found no association between PDE-5i use and overall PC 
diagnosis or low- or high-grade disease.
Despite the negative primary findings, a key secondary finding was that North American 
men were more likely to take PDE-5i, and among these men, there was a suggestion that 
PDE-5i use may be associated with lower risk of PC diagnosis, though this did not reach 
statistical significance. It is speculative to assume that there is an association between 
PDE-5i use and PC, however if future studies show a geographic difference in the 
association between PDE-5i use and PC risk the exact reasons are unclear; though other 
drugs have been shown to be associated with lower PC risk in some geographic regions and 
not others20. One possible explanation may be the derived from the more common and 
perhaps liberal use of PDE-5i use in North American men as opposed to non-North 
American men, thus men outside of North America may have had a stronger indication for 
PDE-5i use (severe ED) was opposed to North-American men. Given that risk factors for ED 
include smoking, CAD, and obesity, which in themselves have been associated with 
PC21–23, PDE-5i use in non-North American men may be linked tighter to these risks factors 
(as opposed to North American men), thereby negating any potential “protective” effect of 
PDE-5i.
Despite our overall null findings, pre-clinic research suggests PDE-5i have anti-cancer 
properties, including anti-PC24, 25. Mechanistically, PDE-5i prevent the cleavage of cGMP 
to 5′-GMP by PDE-5, with elevated cGMP mediating apoptosis via cGMP- dependent 
protein kinase12. PDE-5i also modulate MDSCs, which overexpress inducible nitric oxide 
synthase and arginase-1, arginine metabolizers. Arginine depletion leads to T-cell 
downregulation, however PDE-5i inhibit nitric oxide synthase and arginase-1 resulting in an 
improved anti-tumor immune response5. Despite this, mouse models of sildenafil vs. 
placebo on PC growth and metastasis show no difference in tumor weight, nodal, or distant 
metastasis26. Unfortunately, the REDUCE study design did not allow us to examine the 
association between PDE-5i and disease progression.
Our study has several strengths. All men underwent ≥1 on-study protocol-mandated biopsy 
independent of PSA, minimizing any confounding effect of PDE-5i on PSA and biopsy 
indication. REDUCE included a large multi-national prospective cohort with central 
pathology review.

 The main limitations of our study are that PDE-5i use was not randomly assigned. Moreover, 
PDE-5i use was low. As all men had a baseline negative biopsy, it is possible that PDE-5i are 
linked to PC, but by excluding men with PC prior to enrollment we were unable to detect 
this association. Furthermore PDE-5i use was self-reported at enrollment; men may have 
started or stopped during study. Data for PDE-5i dosage and frequency were unavailable, 
and thus we were unable to control for these factors. Our results are limited to Caucasians 
and it is unclear whether PDE-5i have different effects on other ethnicities. Finally, our study 
period was limited to 4 years. Thus, we cannot comment on PDE-5i and PC diagnosis over 
longer durations or on disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we found PDE-5i use in REDUCE was not associated with PC diagnosis. On 
secondary analysis, among North American men, there was an inverse association between 
PDE-5i use and PC diagnosis, which approached, but did not reach statistical significance. 
Future studies with longer follow-up and larger study populations are warranted to 
determine the association between PDE-5i and PC.
