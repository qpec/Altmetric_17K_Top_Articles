AIMS
Red yeast rice (RYR) is contained in dietary supplements for patients with dyslipidemia. RYR supplements contain monacolin K,
which is chemically identical to lovastatin, a licensed drug with a well-known risk profile. We aim to describe the safety profile of
RYR by analysing spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions (ARs).
METHODS
Within the Italian Surveillance System of Natural Health Products, suspected ARs were collected and evaluated by a
multidisciplinary group of experts to assess causality using the WHO-UMC system or the CIOMS/RUCAM score, for hepatic re-
actions. The public version of the WHO-Vigibase was also queried.
RESULTS
From April 2002 to September 2015, out of 1261 total reports, 52 reports concerning 55 ARs to RYR dietary supplements were
collected. ARs consisted in myalgia and/or increase in creatine phosphokinase (19), rhabdomyolysis (1), liver injury (10), gas-
trointestinal reactions (12), cutaneous reactions (9) and other reactions (4). Women were involved in 70% of cases. In 13 cases,
the reaction required hospitalization, and 28 patients were taking other medications. Dechallenge was positive in 40 reactions
(73%), rechallenge was positive in 7. Causality resulted as certain (1), probable (31, 56%), possible (18, 34%), unlikely (3) or
unassessable (2). Similar distribution emerged from the WHO-Vigibase.
CONCLUSIONS
The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR is similar to that of
statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus
supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Red yeast rice (RYR) is a dietary supplement used in patients with dyslipidemia. It contains monacolin K, which, being
identical to lovastatin, is associated with the same risks.
• RYR is often used by statin-intolerant patients, although there are no studies testing its safety profile as compared to
statins.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• Our case-by-case assessment highlighted myopathies and liver injury as potential safety issues, thus suggesting that the
safety profile of RYR is similar to statins.
• The proportion of serious reports (27%), the relatively rapid time to onset and the lack of concomitant/predisposing med-
ications in several cases call for continuous monitoring of RYR-containing food supplements to define their risk profile.

Introduction
Dietary supplements, often containing herbal substances, are
widely used in Western countries. In Europe, as well as in the
United States, the regulatory status of dietary supplements
does not allow the claim of therapeutic properties. Thus, they
are marketed as self-medication products promoted to main-
tain and improve well-being and overall health. The general
perception of their safety by the public, due to their ‘natural’
components, induces an under-evaluation of their risk pro-
file. However, a recent survey estimated that 23 000 visits
per year to emergency department in the United States for ad-
verse reactions (ARs) were related to dietary supplements [3].
Several case reports and general articles on ARs to these prod-
ucts have been published [4–7].
Red yeast rice (RYR), also known as ‘red Koji’ or ‘Hongqu’,
is a remedy belonging to Traditional Chinese Medicine,
largely used nowadays as dietary supplement in Western
countries. It is produced by fermenting steamed rice with a
food fungus of the Monascus genus, mainly Monascus
purpureus (Aspergillaceae family); during fermentation the
naturally produced pigments give the characteristic red
colour to the rice and monacolins are produced. As part of
the Chinese diet, red Koji is used as food additive to increase
the colour of meat, fish and soybean products; moreover, it
is recognized as a folk medicine for improving food digestion
and blood circulation [8].
Several studies have shown the lipid-lowering effects
of RYR in humans, especially in comparison with placebo
in patients intolerant to statins [9–13], although only a
minority of trials compared head-to-head RYR with statins
or ezetimibe [14–16], and some quality issues (e.g., allocation
concealment and blinding) have been raised [17]. These
properties of RYR are due to its monacolins content, a
family
of
naturally
occurring
substances
that
inhibit
hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme
A
reductase,
the
rate-
limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Monacolins content
in RYR is usually around 0.4% w/w; of this about 90%
consists of monacolin K (also known as mevinolin) which
is chemically identical to lovastatin. Other chemical compo-
nents of RYR are fatty acids and the pigments monascidin A,
ankaflavin, monascorubrine and monascorubramine. A fur-
ther pigment citrinin, a nephrotoxic mycotoxin, can be
produced by some strains of Monascus [8, 18, 19]. A dose
of RYR containing about 5–7 mg of monacolin K is consid-
ered as effective in lowering cholesterol as 20–40 mg of pure
lovastatin, probably owing to the presence of other active
monacolins or to an increased bioavailability of lovastatin
when given as RYR [12, 20, 21].
RYR is considered well tolerated and is often proposed as
an alternative therapy in statin-intolerant patients [9–13]. It
should be acknowledged that clinical trials are usually under-
powered and not fully representative to detect ARs, as dem-
onstrated by a recent systematic review with meta-analysis
of 20 studies, which concluded that the safety is uncertain
due to different methodological issues of included studies,
likely to result in underestimation of ARs [22]. Nevertheless,
different suspected ARs following RYR consumption have
been reported, mainly consisting in myopathies and liver
injury [23–29]. Notably, between 2009 and 2013, the French
Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health
& Safety (ANSES) received 30 reports of ARs potentially asso-
ciated with the consumption of food supplements containing
RYR. Of these, 25 were fully assessed for causality: in 12 cases

 causality was very likely or likely, and concerned predomi-
nantly muscle and liver damage [30]. Notably, the identifi-
cation of potential risks of these products is challenging
because food supplements are not usually registered in
pharmacovigilance databases where suspected adverse drug
reactions
are
collected.
Therefore,
specific
spontaneous
reporting systems represent a key source to promptly iden-
tify potential safety signals.
In this context, the present study analysed the suspected
ARs induced by RYR products, collected within the Italian
Surveillance System of Natural Health Products from April
2002 (its inception) to September 2015, keeping in mind
that well-documented anecdotal reports (and case series)
can provide convincing evidence of a causal association [31].
Methods
Data source
In 2002 the Italian Surveillance System of Natural Health
Products was set up to collect adverse reactions to natural
products. The system, coordinated by the Italian National
Institute of Health, born as a pilot project, has been a
national
surveillance
system
since
2012;
it
operates
separately from the Italian pharmacovigilance network,
which collects spontaneous reports of suspected ARs to
registered medicines.
The surveillance system consists in the collection and
evaluation of spontaneous reports of suspected ARs that
occurred after the consumption/administration of: dietary
supplements; herbal preparations and galenic formulations;
other herbal preparations not included in the former para-
graphs and other preparations of natural origin but non-plant
(e.g., royal jelly or propolis, snake extracts); and homeopathic
products.
Reports can be sent from anybody observing a suspected
adverse reaction associated with these products, by an ad
hoc form available on the websites of the involved institu-
tions (National Institute of Health, Ministry of Health, Italian
Medicines Agency). All reports are registered in a database at
the National Institute of Health. Labels of the products are
provided by the Ministry of Health. Diagnoses are coded ac-
cording to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA version 4). For serious cases, follow-up of patients
is obtained from the hospital physician. The reporting form
is provided in Supplementary material 1.
As an aid to better characterize the reporting profile from
an international perspective, we queried the public version of
the WHO-Vigibase (www.vigiaccess.org), given its (virtually
worldwide) catchment area in terms of adverse drug reactions
(ADRs). The Italian Surveillance System of Natural Health
Products does not currently submit reports to WHO UMC,
although there is the intention to share these data in the near
future. For this reason, no duplicates are likely to exist in our
sample.
Causality assessment
A Scientific Committee, including experts in toxicology,
pharmacology, pharmacognosy, phytotherapy, botany, paedi-
atrics and homeopathy, was appointed for the evaluation of
the reports and the detection of risk signals. A Steering Com-
mittee
with
experts
in
pharmacovigilance,
pharmacoe-
pidemiology and regulatory aspects supports the activities
of the Scientific Committee.
The causality assessment is performed using an evaluation
scale adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO)
causality categories reported in the WHO Guidelines on
Safety Monitoring of Herbal Medicines in Pharmacovigilance
Systems [32]. Feedback is provided to the reporter. When
needed and possible, the product is acquired and analysed
at the National Institute of Health. Among the possible
analyses, search for contaminants, adulterants or unde-
clared drugs can be performed.
In this study, all reports associated with RYR products
were extracted
through
a search strategy
using active
substances or specific product names and analysed according
to the WHO-UMC system for standardized case causality
assessment [33]. For hepatic reactions, causality assessment
was performed, when possible, using the CIOMS/RUCAM
score, a quantitative, liver-specific, validated scale for hepato-
toxicity, used in the assessment of both herb- and drug-
induced
liver
injury
(DILI)
[34].
The
evaluation
was
performed by two independent authors who, in case of
disagreement, discussed the case to reach consensus.
As suspected products contained other components in ad-
dition to RYR, the causality assessment concerned the whole
supplement, not just its single components. Nevertheless,
the possible role of the other components in the reaction
has been considered and discussed. According to the WHO,
an ADR was considered as ‘serious’ when it resulted in death,
or was life-threatening, or required hospitalization or prolon-
gation of existing hospitalization, or resulted in persistent or
significant disability or incapacity [35].
Results
Data overview
From April 2002 to September 2015, out of a total of 1261
reports, 52 (4.1%) concerning 55 suspected ARs to dietary
supplements containing RYR were collected within the
Italian Surveillance System of Natural Products. Three cases
(namely 1, 2 and 3) have been published previously [23];
however, they are included, in order to give a complete
pictureoftheARscollectedwithinthesystem.Thereportscon-
cerned 37 women (71%) and 14 men (in one case gender was
not reported), aged between 35 and 85 years (mean: 64 years);
intwocasesagewasnotreported.Themostfrequentlyreported
supplement was Armolipid plus® (29 cases, 55%), followed by
Colestat® (5 cases, 10%). These products contained other
components besides RYR, mainly policosanols (as such or as
Saccharum officinarum extract), coenzyme Q10, folic acid and
astaxanthin; some supplements contained green tea, resvera-
trol, fish oil, vitamins E, B6 and B12 and Berberis aristata dry
extract (in Armolipid plus® and Colest 500®): the exact
composition is reported in Table 1. The reason for use of
RYR preparations, as indicated on the reporting forms, was
hypercholesterolemia in all cases. The total daily dose of
monacolin K of the food supplements involved was 3 mg
in all but four reports.

 In 14 cases (27%) the reaction was serious, including 13
cases that required hospitalization. Notably, hepatic reac-
tions were serious in six out of ten cases. Twenty-eight pa-
tients were taking other medications consisting generally in
conventional drugs (ACE inhibitors, thyroid hormone, selec-
tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors, oral contraceptives, anti-
biotics, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, vitamin D,
beta-blocking agents and diuretics), but also in dietary sup-
plements: fish oil, olive (Olea europaea L.) and Vitis vinifera L.
(three cases). Conditions predisposing to RYR-associated re-
actions were generally absent or not reported. It has to be
noted that in 12 out of 13 cases resulting in hospitalization,
no concomitant medications or predisposing conditions
were reported; only in one case was a poly-pharmacotherapy
identified (≥ five drugs).
Based on the MedDRA terminology, the most frequently
reported system organ classes (SOCs) were ‘Musculoskeletal
and connective tissue disorders’ (20 reactions, 36%), ‘Gastro-
intestinal disorders’ (12, 22%), ‘Hepatobiliary disorders’ (10,
18%), ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (9, 16%).
Overall, after causality assessment, association was evalu-
ated as certain (1 reaction), probable (31 reactions, 56%),
possible
(18
reactions
34%),
unlikely
(3
reactions)
or
unassessable (2 reactions). Thus, for 56% of reactions, an at
least probable causal association was assessed. A complete de-
scription of cases is reported in Table 1.
From the WHO-Vigibase, 75 reports were retrieved using
RYR
as
active
substance
(search
performed
as
of
13
September 2016): 56% were submitted from the Americas,
43% from Europe; 36% occurred in patients aged 45–64
years (28% in those aged >65) and 69% were females. The
most
frequently
reported
reactions
were
myalgia
(22),
followed by muscle spasm, chest pain, drug interaction
(7 each), rhabdomyolysis, pain in extremity and dizziness
(5 each). The full reporting frequency of ARs is provided in
Supplementary material 2.
Case-by-case assessment
Musculoskeletal
and
connective
tissue
disorders.
Muscular
pain, with or without indication of creatine phosphokinase
(CPK)
increase,
occurred
in
19
patients,
one
case
of
rhabdomyolysis was also recorded. Muscle pain affected
generally the lower extremities and cramps were sometimes
present. The increase in CPK values was mild in some cases
(4, 5, 7, 10: about 200 U/L or less), high in others (1, 2, 3,
12, 14: from 288 to 732 U/L) and very high (up to ten times
the normal concentrations) in two patients (9, 16); in the
rhabdomyolysis case, the CPK level reached 12 245 U/L. The
latency of the reaction was variable, ranging between 9 days
and more than one year; however, about one third of the
reactions occurred within 30 days and 63% within two
months. Several patients were taking medications, most of
which are not known to be associated with muscular
disorders, with exception of venlafaxine [36, 37]; this
evidence
was
taken
into
account
in
the
causality
assessment. Noteworthy, some patients (3, 6 and 12) were
using RYR preparations as an alternative option, being
intolerant to statins, while patients 9 and 13 previously
experienced myopathy and CPK increase associated with
statin
use;
patient
15,
who
showed
rhabdomyolysis,
presented a previous identical reaction after taking statins;
in these cases RYR use was considered a positive rechallenge.
The causality assessment, according to the WHO scale,
resulted as possible in 8 cases (3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 18),
probable in 11 cases (1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20)
and certain in case 15.
Gastrointestinal disorders.
Gastrointestinal reactions occurred
in 12 patients and consisted mostly in dyspepsia, nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain, sometimes in diarrhoea. The
reactions occurred within one or two days or after 3–4 weeks
of treatment. The reactions were in general not serious, and
only one case (38) needed hospitalization. Dechallenge was
always positive (not available for case 32). Nevertheless, in
two patients (30, 31) the reaction, even if improved, was
persistent. Five patients (34–38) had a positive rechallenge.
For case 32 the causality was judged as unassessable, due to
lacking
information
about
outcome
and
dechallenge;
furthermore, the patient was taking another food supplement
with unknown side-effects. Some cases were judged as possible
because similar reactions were reported for concomitant
drugs; for example, abdominal pain has been reported in
more
than
1%
of
hypertensive
patients
who
received
moexipril/hydrochlorotiazide
[38],
as
with
case
18.
In
causality assessment a conservative approach was used,
taking in account that gastrointestinal symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting and impaired digestion do not represent
specific medical disorders and are common side-effects of
drugs. As a consequence, cases 37 and 38 were judged as
probable
and
not
certain
despite
the
plausible
time
relationship to drug intake, the absence of other causes, a
positive response to withdrawal and a positive rechallenge.
Hepatobiliary disorders.
Hepatic reactions occurred in ten
patients and consisted in acute hepatitis (six patients), that
required hospitalization, or in increase of hepatic enzymes.
These six cases fulfilled criteria for DILI, according to the
international Expert Working Group [39]. In one patient
(16) increase in AST occurred together with CPK increase.
Nine cases were compatible with the definition of drug-
induced liver injury, as recommended by the CIOMS [40, 41].
Time to onset was between two weeks and one year of
treatment, 37% of the reactions occurred within one month
and 75% within two months. Transaminases ranged from
about twice to 80 times the upper normal level. In all cases,
except for two in which it was not reported, dechallenge
was positive. Patients were taking other drugs or dietary
supplements, but generally these were not known to be asso-
ciated with liver injury. The CIOMS/RUCAM score was only
applied to cases 26 and 27, for whom the follow-up was avail-
able. Case 26 regarded a 49-year-old woman who had
consumed Armolipid plus® for 50 days. She was hospitalized
for suspected myocardial infarction; the infarction was ex-
cluded, while an acute hepatitis was diagnosed with ALT
and AST values corresponding to 46 and 57 times the upper
normal concentrations, respectively. Total bilirubin was nor-
mal, viral and autoimmune serology was negative and other
drug and non-drug causes of hepatitis were excluded; rhabdo-
myolysis was also excluded. The supplement consumption
was suspended and the values decreased, returning to normal

903
 after 17 days. The causality assessment resulted in a score of
7 (probable).
Case 27 was a 68-year-old woman who had a history of hy-
percholesterolemia, for which she had been taking the sup-
plement Armolipid plus® for 2 years. An increase of liver
enzymes (AST = 87; ALT = 168) was discovered during a rou-
tine blood test, and an additional laboratory test reported to-
tal bilirubin 0.5, γ-GT 53, ALP 109. Creatine kinase was
normal, thus suggesting that the increase in transaminases
did not have a muscular aetiology. The ultrasound scan did
not show clinically important signs of hepato-biliary dam-
age, except for moderate steatosis and lithiasis (previously
documented). Major infective hepatitis was excluded, no re-
cent flu-like episodes or gastro-intestinal symptoms were doc-
umented, no history of pre-existing liver or biliary disease,
blood transfusion or alcohol abuse was documented. Con-
comitant drugs included levothyroxine (for 7 years) and
chenodeoxycholic acid (for 5 years). The product was sug-
gested by healthcare professionals because of the patient’s
complaints about symptomatic myopathy, probably related
to the administration of statins. Notably, no elevation of
CPK or hepatic transaminases was previously documented
when the woman was treated with statins. The supplement
was suspended. Laboratory blood test, performed after less
than 4 weeks, gave normal values for AST, ALT, γ-GT and
ALP. Based on transaminases values, the liver injury was clas-
sified
as
hepatocellular
and
the
application
of
the
CIOMS/RUCAM scale resulted in a score of 5 (possible).
In cases 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 16, the causality assessment
performed by the WHO method, resulted as probable; case 28
was unassessable, due to lack of information about time to on-
set of the reaction, duration of treatment, outcome and
dechallenge, while case 29 was judged unlikely because, de-
spite the positive dechallenge, the reaction recurred without
rechallenge; moreover, information about time to onset and
treatment duration were lacking.
Skin and subcutaneous disorders.
Nine cutaneous reactions
associated with RYR products were collected. Most of them
(42, 44–47) occurred with a 1–4-day latency, the others
occurred after 10 days (48), 3 weeks (5) or about 2 months
(48) of treatment. Four cases (41, 43, 45 and 48) were serious
and required hospitalization. In case 41, which involved a
57-year-old woman, the reaction consisted in Pemphigus
vulgaris, diagnosed by titration of anti-desmoglein 1 and 3
antibodies and by biopsy. The reaction occurred 2 weeks
after discontinuation of the supplement and needed a
pharmacological therapy. The patient was not taking other
drugs, but as she had experienced a previous episode of
Pemphygus eight years before, then the reaction could be
considered a relapse and the causality was judged as unlikely.
Patient 43 (a 75-year-old woman) was admitted to hospital
with severe urticaria, rash and oedema of the lips. The
reaction
improved
after
discontinuation
of
the
RYR
supplement but recurred after 6 days, without rechallenge.
It is to be underlined that this patient, even without
predisposing
conditions,
was taking various
medications
(cardioaspirin, amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, triazolam,
metoprolol, lansoprazole, risedronate), but, most importantly,
received flu vaccine 5 days before the onset of the reaction, so,
also in this case, the causality was judged as unlikely. In cases 5,
45 and 47, the causality was judged as possible despite a positive
outcome and dechallenge, because patients were taking other
drugs, some of which (amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide,
lansoprazole) have been reported to induce cutaneous adverse
reactions [42, 43]. Patient 48 was hospitalized for DRESS (drug
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome,
a severe drug-induced reaction [44]. Laboratory tests suggested
that the patient had a Herpes simples virus infection, a
condition associated with DRESS [45]. Cases of DRESS are
described also for atorvastatine [46], a lipid-lowering drug
belonging to the statins class (as monacolin contained in RYR),
as well as for omeprazole [47], a proton pump inhibitor similar
to pantoprazole that the patient was consuming. Based on
these considerations, the causality between DRESS and RYR
preparation was judged as possible. In the other cutaneous
reactions (42, 44 and 46) the causality was considered as
probable on the basis of the positive dechallenge, outcome and
absence of alternative causes.
Others miscellaneous reactions.
Case 49 involved a 78-year-
old woman who was taking warfarin and showed an increase
of INR (international normalized ratio) after consumption
of the RYR supplement Armolipid plus®. The dose of
warfarin
was
reduced
and
the
INR
value
returned
to
normal.
In
this
case
a
pharmacodynamic
interaction
between the anticoagulant drug and RYR supplement can
be hypothesized, even if the dechallenge was not done.
Furthermore, three patients showed nausea, vertigo and
hazy
vision
(50),
tingling
of
extremities
(51)
and
tachycardia
(52);
the
latter
required
hospitalization.
Dechallenge was always positive and other causes were
excluded, so the causality was judged as probable in all of
them. Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that in case 52
the supplement consumed (Fisiostatin®) contained, besides
RYR, green tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze], a source
of caffeine that could be responsible for the adverse reaction.
Discussion
From April 2002 to September 2015, a total of 1261 spontane-
ous reports of suspected ARs to natural health products
(mainly dietary supplements, 65%) were collected within
the Italian Surveillance System of Natural Health Products.
In this article, we describe 55 suspected ARs to RYR food sup-
plements collected within the system in the same period. Be-
cause clinical trials are not requested by food supplements
legislation and no risk–benefit profile is known before mar-
keting, spontaneous reports are the only tool available to
evaluate their safety.
Overall, our findings raise the hypothesis that the safety
profile of RYR is similar to synthetic statins: myopathies
(myalgia, CK and transaminases elevation [48–51]), cutane-
ous reactions, gastrointestinal and liver reactions emerged
as a potential safety signals of RYR and have been reported
as not uncommon adverse reactions associated with statins
[52–55]. These data are also in line with cases collected from
WHO-Vigibase and reports received by the ANSES French
Agency, where muscle- and liver-related ARs were largely re-
ported with RYR [30]. In 14 cases (27%), the reactions were

 serious and mostly required hospitalization, especially those
related to hepatic injury. Most of the reactions involved
women, probably because they use more dietary supplements
than men [56, 57]. Notably, some patients who showed mus-
cular adverse reactions associated with statin switched to RYR
supplements as an alternative and experienced similar ad-
verse effects. The time to onset of muscle- and liver-related
ARs was relatively rapid: one third of cases occurred during
the first month of treatment, and two-thirds within 60 days.
Therefore, clinicians should be informed that monacolin
K contained in RYR is identical to lovastatin, and consider
early monitoring of liver function and signs of muscle injury.
In parallel, consumers should be discouraged from using RYR
preparations as self-medication, particularly if they have
experienced previous adverse reactions to statins. When
self-prescribed, without medical advice and monitoring and
possibly for the long term, patients should be aware they are
consuming an active substance, with both therapeutic and
toxic effects. In fact, even serious adverse reactions, such as
hepatitis or rhabdomyolysis, can remain asymptomatic for
long periods with the risk of organ failure progression. In
contrast, when statins are taken under medical control, blood
tests to check CK and organ function are performed periodi-
cally so that statin use can be stopped as soon as abnormal
results are shown.
We acknowledged limitations, especially underreporting,
which is likely to affect the so-called ‘natural’ products to a
larger extent, by both patients and physicians, who may not
correlate suspected ARs to dietary supplements [58, 59]. Fur-
thermore, sales data of food supplements are not available,
given that the regulatory status of RYR (not reimbursed) does
not allow their capture by administrative databases. Future
studies should explore the extent of RYR use through ad hoc
created strategies (e.g., questionnaire-based surveillance), in
order to gain information on the pattern of use of RYR and
to make cross-national comparisons.
All supplements involved, except one, contained other
natural components besides RYR. For this reason, as already
stated, the assessment causality refers to the supplement in
its whole composition. Nevertheless, we can assume that
the reactions here described, mainly myopathy and liver in-
jury, can reasonably be ascribed to RYR, which has been re-
ported to induce such reactions [10, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 60, 61].
Causality assessment presents some limitations due to the
fact that spontaneous reporting systems involve general
practitioners, specialists, hospital doctors, pharmacists, but
also herbalists and consumers. As a consequence, forms
were sometimes incomplete (i.e. lack of information about
latency of the reaction, treatment duration, concomitant
drugs or predisposing conditions). The application of the
CIOMS/RUSCAM score to hepatic reactions requires knowl-
edge of the complete serology of the patient, and the course
of the disease, with regard to liver enzyme values, is needed.
This kind of information was rarely available in most of our
reports, so the score was applied only to two cases (26, 27)
with an available detailed medical history. However, to the
extent of our knowledge, these are the first two reports where
the CIOMS/RUCAM score was applied to assess hepatic safety
of RYR. All these limitations made the causality assessment
quite difficult. Notwithstanding, for 56% of reactions, an at
least probable causal association emerged.
From a regulatory standpoint, in Italy, the Ministry of
Health in 2003 (note 600.12/AG21/2839 of January 1,
2003 and following memorandum 600.12/AG21/3178 of
November 11, 2003) allowed a maximum dose of 3 mg per
day of monacolin K in dietary supplements to ensure the
safety of the product. Moreover, a recommendation not to
assume RYR products together with statins was added on
the package. However, in 2011, the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) sustained that the health claim for RYR in
maintaining normal blood LDL cholesterol concentrations
was supported for a daily dose of 10 mg of monacolin [62].
Therefore, in 2012, the European Union increased the
maximum dose allowed to 10 mg per day (Official Gazette
of European Union, L136, May 25, 2012), which prompted
some manufacturers to increase the monacolin content in
RYR preparations. This may theoretically expose subjects to
an increased risk of ARs. Based on our data, in only four
out of 23 cases did the preparation contain 10 mg of
monacolin, thus making it is difficult to establish the real
consequences of the increase in monacolin dose on the
number and severity of ARs.
A further problem with efficacy and safety of RYR
commercial preparations is the variability in monacolin K
content. Analysing 12 RYR products, Gordon et al. [63]
labelled
‘600
mg/capsule’
of
active
product,
found:
monacolins 0.31–11.15 mg/capsule; monacolin K (lova-
statin)
0.10–10.09
mg/capsule,
and
monacolin
K
acid
0.00–2.30 mg/capsule. More recently, Avula et al. [64]
analysed three authentic samples of RYR, 31 RYR commercial
raw materials and 14 dietary supplements. In the authenti-
cated RYR samples, the monacolin K content ranged from
1.9 to 2.3 mg/g (w/w). Ten of 31 commercial RYR raw material
samples did not show the presence of any monacolin; in the
remaining 21 the amount of monacolin K was in the range
0.7–24.3 mg/g (w/w). Amounts of monacolin K in dietary
supplements labelled as containing 600 mg of RYR ranged
from 0.03 mg to 2.18 mg. From these data it appears that a
problem of standardization with RYR commercial products
does exist.
Conclusions
Our assessment of suspected ARs reported with RYR high-
lights two potential safety issues, namely muscle and he-
patic injuries, in line with data obtained from accessing
the public web-based version of the WHO-Vigibase and a
similar analysis recently carried out by the ANSES French
Agency. These findings raise the hypothesis that the safety
profile of RYR is highly similar to that of synthetic statins
and warrants further investigation to finally characterize
the safety profile of RYR. The proportion of serious reports
(27%), the relatively rapid time to onset and the lack of
concomitant drugs and/or predisposing medications in
several cases warrant regulatory consideration and call for:
(1) continuous monitoring of the safety of ‘natural’ dietary
supplements through spontaneous reports; and (2) appro-
priate
information
being
provided
to
clinicians
and
consumers, who should timely submit suspect reports to
regulatory agencies.
