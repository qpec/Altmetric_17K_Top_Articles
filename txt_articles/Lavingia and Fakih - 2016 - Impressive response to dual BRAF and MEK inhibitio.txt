Introduction
Molecular analysis in patients with cholangiocarcinoma has 
been studied increasingly and has shown marked diversity 
in the frequency of targetable oncogenic driver mutations. 
One such aberration is mutation in BRAF (v-Raf murine 
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) which is one of the 
downstream signals in MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein 
kinases) pathway. Here we report 2 cases of BRAF mutant 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) refractory to initial 
chemotherapy treated with dual BRAF and MEK inhibition 
exhibiting excellent durable clinical and radiological 
response.
Case presentation
Case 1
A 49-year-old female presented with abdominal bloating 
and increasing discomfort in June 2014. She was evaluated 
by imaging and was found to have a large left lobe liver 
tumor. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was 
consistent with adenocarcinoma. Her CA19-9 (carbohydrate 
antigen 19.9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum 
tumor markers and liver function tests were unremarkable. 
A [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission 
tomography (PET)/CT scan showed a left lobe liver mass

Abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) typically presents at an advanced stage and is associated 
with a poor oncological outcome. The median survival for metastatic ICC is less than 1 year with standard 
chemotherapy. ICC is associated with distinct oncogenic drivers including IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase), 
HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor 2), and BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), 
which may benefit from matching targeted therapies. Hereby we report 2 cases of BRAF V600E refractory 
ICC treated with dual BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib) with excellent clinical and 
radiological response to therapy and with protracted duration of disease control. Our first patient achieved 
CR (complete remission) at 6 months of treatment with ultimate disease progression at 9 months. The 
second patient achieved a PR (partial response) at 2 months from starting treatment and remains progression 
free at 5 months. Our results confirm the activity of dual BRAF and MEK targeting in BRAF mutated ICC, 
adding further support to 3 additional case-reports in the literature. Dual targeting appears superior to other 
case reports with BRAF inhibition alone and appear favorable to historic data with cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Given the poor outlook and refractoriness of BRAF mutant ICC, future studies should focus on early 
integration of BRAF/MEK inhibition.

with no evidence of extra hepatic disease. Colonoscopy 
was unremarkable. She underwent a left hepatectomy with 
dissection of celiac nodes and cystic duct in July 2014. Post 
operative histopathological examination revealed a 7.3-cm 
moderately differentiated ICC, with direct tumor invasion 
to local adjacent extra hepatic structures, perineural 
invasion, and with 3 out of 4 positive lymph nodes (Tumor 
Node Metastasis stage pT3N1—Stage IVA). No loss of 
mismatch repair protein (MMR) expression was noted by 
immunohistochemistry. In view of her high risk of disease 
recurrence, she received five 3-week cycles of gemcitabine 
and cisplatin adjuvant chemotherapy. Repeat imaging after 
cycle 5 (4 months) revealed a new 1 cm right liver lobe lesion 
with new periportal and portacaval nodes and a pericardial 
lymph node enlargement. She underwent radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA) to the liver lesion and was switched to 
second line single-agent capecitabine. Repeat computerized 
tomography (CT) scan following 3 cycles of capecitabine 
 
(2 months) revealed new liver lesions and progressive lymph 
node enlargement in the pericardial region (Figure 1A,B). 
 
Foundation One comprehensive genomic analysis was 
performed on her original resection specimen and confirmed a 
BRAF V600E mutation. She was started on dabrafenib 150 mg 
 
PO BID (twice a day) and trametinib 2 mg PO QD (once a 
day) in May 2015. Follow-up imaging studies confirmed a 
partial response after 6 weeks of treatment and a complete 
clinical response after 5 months of treatment (RECIST 1.1) 
 
(Figure 1C,D). At 9 months of treatment, CT imaging 
confirmed recurrence of disease in the pericardial node and 
periportal/portacaval lymph nodes and new right pleural 
disease. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was 
discontinued. 
Case 2
A 71-year-old lady presented with vague right sided 
abdominal discomfort of 3 to 4 months duration with 
associated anorexia and weight loss in August 2015. Her 
past medical history was significant for cardiac dysrythmia 
requiring pacemaker placement and mild chronic obstructive

pulmonary disease (COPD). CT scan of the abdomen and 
pelvis showed a 7.8 cm infiltrative mass in the left lobe of 
liver and other too numerous to count smaller metastases in 
both lobes of liver (August 2015, Figure 2A). CA19.9 levels 
was elevated at 84,000 U/mL. Her liver enzymes and other 
biochemical parameters were unremarkable. Colonoscopy and 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were unremarkable. 
FNA biopsy was consistent with ICC, with CK7+, CK19.9+, 
CK20-, CDX.2-, and TTF1-. She received gemcitabine and 
cisplatin chemotherapy for 3 cycles followed by re-staging 
CT scans, which confirmed progressive disease in the 
liver (November 2015, Figure 2B). Foundation One was 
performed on her initial diagnostic biopsy and confirmed 
a BRAF V600E mutation. She was started on dabrafenib 
150 mg PO BID and trametinib 2 mg PO QD starting 
November 2015. Her CA19.9 levels dropped dramatically 
in the next six weeks (Figure 2C). Her last scan was done 
5 months after initiation of BRAF/MEK inhibitors (April 
2016, FIG2d) and confirms a partial response to treatment. 
As of this report, the patient continues on treatment with 
ongoing clinical benefit. 
Discussion
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is one of the most fatal 
malignancies in the field of pancreatico-hepatobiliary tumors. 
Based on the SEER database, the 5-year overall survival is 
15% and 2% for stage I (localized) and stage IV disease, 
respectively (1). The median survival of metastatic CCA is 
approximately one year with currently approved systemic 
therapies (2). There is an unmet need for new strategies and 
treatment options for metastatic CCA. One such strategy 
relies on the stratification of cholangiocarcinoma into distinct 
molecular subgroups, with matching targeted therapies. 
These molecular subgroups include BRAF, ERBB2, IDH1 & 2 
 
and FGFR aberrations (3). These molecular aberrations have 
been shown to be targetable, and are the subject of several 
ongoing or planned clinical trials. In this reports, we focus

on two cases of ICC with BRAF mutation and demonstrate 
impressive clinical activity for a combination of BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib and tramatenib. 
BRAF mutations are more common in ICC than 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer 
(4,5). The frequency of BRAF mutations in ICC have 
ranged between 1% to 22% among various cases series 
or population studies. The frequency appears to be 
underestimated when assessed by immunohistochemistry 
studies in comparison to PCR (6,7). In addition, the 
variations in the reported frequency may be related to 
differences in PCR techniques and Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS) as well as distinct differences in the 
study populations. Irrespective of the true frequency, 
BRAF mutant cholangiocarcinoma appears to be a distinct 
molecular subtype of biliary cancers that can be associated 
with aggressive behavior and chemotherapy resistance, as 
demonstrated in our cases. The targeting of this subgroup 
of patients with single agent BRAF inhibitors has been 
associated with modest clinical responses and short duration 
of disease control. In a study by Hyman et al., single agent 
vemurafenib was associated with a 12% objective response 
rate in BRAF mutant cholangiocarcinoma (1 out of 8 patients 
 
had PR) (8). Several other solid tumors with BRAF 
mutation have shown a benefit from combining BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors. Randomized phase III clinical trials have 
shown superiority of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors to BRAF 
inhibitors alone in BRAF mutant melanoma (9). In addition, 
a study of dabrafenib plus tramatenib shows more favorable 
responses and progression free survival in comparison to 
another study with vemurafenib alone in patients metastatic 
BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (10).
In view of improved efficacy of dual BRAF and MEK 
inhibition in melanoma and colorectal cancer, we elected 
to treat our patients with BRAF mutant ICC with a 
combination of dabrafenib and tramatenib. Both cases 
were characterized by refractoriness to first-line standard 
chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin and with 
aggressive clinical behavior. Dramatic and durable 
responses to dabrafenib and tramatenib were recorded 
and included a complete clinical response and an ongoing 
partial response. Our results are in line with 3 additional 
case reports of dabrafenib and tramatenib in BRAF mutant 
ICC. These include 2 cases with a clinical benefit from 
MDACC (not detailed) and one case with a PR lasting 
more than 8.5 months from Penn University (11,12). While 
ideal, the conduct of future conclusive first-line phase III 
randomized clinical trials of dual BRAF/MEK inhibitors 
against gemcitabine plus cisplatin will be challenging. 
However, several Basket studies are currently evaluating 
combinations of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in non-
melanoma and non-colorectal cancer BRAF-V600E mutated 
tumors (NCT02034110, NCT01713972, NCT01902173). 
Additional data from these prospective clinical trials will 
help confirm the activity of dual MEK/BRAF inhibition as a 
standard approach in BRAF-mutant cholangiocarcinoma.
