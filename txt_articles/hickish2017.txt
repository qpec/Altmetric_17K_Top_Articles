Summary 
Background MABp1, an antibody that targets interleukin 1α, has been associated with antitumour activity and relief of 
debilitating symptoms in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We sought to establish the eff
 ect of MABp1 with a 
new primary endpoint in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
Methods Eligible patients for the double-blind phase of this ongoing, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 trial, 
had metastatic or unresectable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 1 or 2, systemic 
infl
 ammation, weight loss, and other disease-related morbidities associated with poor prognosis, and were refractory 
to oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either MABp1 or placebo. Randomisation 
codes were obtained from a centrally held list via an interactive web response system. Patients received an intravenous 
infusion of 7·5 mg/kg MABp1 or placebo given every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was assessed in 
patients who received at least one dose of MABp1 or placebo (modifi
 ed intention-to-treat population), and was a 
composite of stable or increased lean body mass and stability or improvement in two of three symptoms (pain, 
fatigue, or anorexia) at week 8 compared with baseline measurements. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02138422.
Findings Patients were enrolled between May 20, 2014, and Sept 2, 2015. The double-blind phase of the study was 
completed on Nov 3, 2015. Of 333 patients randomly assigned treatment, 207 received at least one dose of MABp1 and 
102 at least one dose of placebo. 68 (33%) and 19 (19%) patients, respectively, achieved the primary endpoint (relative 
risk 1·76, 95% CI 1·12–2·77, p=0·0045). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events in the MABp1 group compared 
with in the placebo group were anaemia (eight [4%] of 207 vs fi
 ve [5%] of 102 patients), increased concentration of 
alkaline phosphatase (nine [4%] vs two [2%]), fatigue (six [3%] vs seven [7%]), and increased concentration of aspartate 
aminotransferase (six [3%] vs two [2%]). After 8 weeks, 17 (8%) patients in the MABp1 group and 11 (11%) in the 
placebo group had died, but no death was judged to be related to treatment. The incidence of serious adverse events 
was not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent in the MABp1 group and placebo groups (47 [23%] vs 33 [32%], p=0·07).
Interpretation The primary endpoint was a useful means of measuring clinical performance in patients. MABp1 
might represent a new standard in the management of advanced colorectal cancer.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of 
malignancy in high-income countries, and the incidence 
is increasing worldwide as economies grow and the 
global population ages.1 In half of patients with colorectal 
cancer the disease progresses, leading to death.2 Disease 
progression is typically associated with severe morbidity 
related to the underlying disease process and to 
treatment-related toxic eff
 ects. The benefi
 t of continued 
treatment must, therefore, be weighed against increasing 
morbidity and loss of quality of life associated with the 
therapy itself. A substantial and growing need exists for 
methods to assess the ability of new anticancer agents to 
provide unequivocal clinical benefi
 t to patients with 
advanced colorectal and other cancers.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has provided a 
regulatory path to encourage and expedite the development 
of anticancer agents that improve patients’ health while 
prolonging life. These guidelines support development of 
anticancer agents that lessen the severity of debilitating 
symptoms in patients, particularly where the eff
 ect is the 
result of an antitumour mechanism and the clinical 
measures are deemed to have predictive value for overall 
survival.3
MABp1 is a monoclonal antibody derived from a 
natural human immune response that neutralises 
interleukin 1α. The interleukin 1 pathway, and 
specifi
 cally interleukin 1α, is a desirable target for 
anticancer therapy because it has pathological roles in 
the local and systemic eff
 ects of cancer.4 Interleukin 1α 
is an important source of infl
 ammatory signalling in the 
tumour 
micro 
environ 
ment, 
owing 
to 
increased 
expression by malignant cells or infi
 ltrating leucocytes 
or stromal cells.5 By itself, interleukin 1 drives various

infl
 ammatory processes, such as upregulation of COX2, 
but it also stimulates release of several infl
 ammation-
inducing mediators (eg, cytokines, chemokines, matrix 
metalloproteinases, and angiogenic factors) that amplify 
the infl
 ammatory response and work to create a 
protumor environment. In the tumour micro 
environ-
ment, therefore, interleukin 1α activity is implicated in 
the promotion of tumour growth. It also induces 
upregulation of adhesion molecules and diapedesis at 
the vascular endothelium, driving infi
 ltration of tumor 
sites and promoting spread of malignant cells.6–10 
By playing a part in recruitment of  myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells and T-regulatory cells, the interleukin 1 
pathway might also contribute to the downregulation  of 
host antitumour immunity.11,12 Interleukin 1α and the 
cytokines it induces, such as interleukin 6, cause fever, 
fatigue, anorexia, and acute-phase protein secretion. 
Interleukin 1 signalling via the hypothalamus–pituitary–
adrenal axis is thought to mediate metabolic pathology 
involving heightened gluconeogenesis and loss of lean 
body mass, but can also lead directly to breakdown of 
muscle tissue. Since so many local and systemic 
responses are mediated by interleukin 1 in the context of 
malignant tumours, neutralisation with a monoclonal 
antibody was proposed to have the potential to lessen 
tumour growth and to reverse or improve debilitating 
morbidities associated with the disease. Findings for the 
use of MABp1 in patients with advanced cancer supported 
this hypothesis.13 Given as monotherapy, the antibody 
was associated with disease control in 32% of patients.13 
This antibody has also been associated with pharmaco-
dynamic responses that correlate with overall survival in 
advanced cancer, including normalisation of para-
neoplastic thrombo 
cytosis, reduction in metabolic rate, 
and a lowering of systemic infl
 ammation.14–16 Antibody 
treatment was also associated with improve 
ments in 
disease-related morbidity, including reductions in 
fatigue, pain, and anorexia.13 A novel fi
 nding has been 
notable gains in lean body mass during treatment.13 Such 
treatment-related improvements of symptoms in patients 
with colorectal cancer might enable symptom assessment 
to be used as a clinical endpoint to monitor treatment 
benefi
 t. In this Article we report our results of a phase 3 
study to investigate this approach. The protocol for this 
study is available online.  
Methods
Study design and participants
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is 
being done in 42 outpatient oncology clinics in the 
European Union and Russia. Eligible patients were adults 
(age ≥18 years) who had metastatic colorectal cancer with 
multiple symptoms associated with poor outcomes, were 
refractory to oxaliplatin and irinotecan, and had Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
scores of 1 or 2. To ensure that patients had disease-
related morbidities that could be measured with dual-
energy x-ray absorp 
tiometry (DEXA) and self-reported 
outcomes, we enrolled those with any degree of 
unintentional weight loss of up to 20% in the previous 
6 months or with interleukin 6 concentrations in serum 
of 10 pg/mL or higher.17 Additionally, patients had to have 
one or more of anorexia (score >10), fatigue (score >10), 
pain (score >10), and decreased role, emotional, and 
social function (score <90), as assessed with the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) quality of life in cancer questionnaire 
(QLQ-C30), version 3. Other requirements were adequate 
renal function (serum creatinine ≤1⋅5 × the upper limit of 
normal [ULN]), hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤1⋅5 × the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before starting this trial, we did an extensive literature review 
for papers published from Dec 1, 2003, to Dec 31, 2013, to 
assess the validity of functional and metabolic outcomes to 
measure clinical response and predict overall survival in patients 
with advanced cancer. All searches were done in PubMed with 
the search terms “lean body mass”, “EORTC QLQ C30”, 
“interleukin-6 level”, “platelets”, “advanced cancer”, 
“improvement”, “survival”, and “prognosis”. With the exception 
of one previous trial that assessed MABp1 in advanced cancer, 
no trials were identifi
 ed that showed an improvement in lean 
body mass or a correlation between changing lean body mass 
and survival. 
Added value of this study
We showed an improvement in disease-associated symptoms 
when assessed with a composite endpoint of changes in lean 
body mass and symptoms. For those who achieved the primary 
endpoint, global quality of life and functional domain scores 
improved, as did pharmacokinetic measures. Additionally 
disease stabilisation and overall survival were signifi
 ciantly 
improved, and the incidence of serious adverse events was 
redcued. Our novel endpoint was validated as an important 
measure of clinical benefi
 t in patients with refractory disease.
Implications of all the available evidence
Patients with refractory cancer and disease-related symptoms 
have few treatment options. Most of the available treatments 
are associated with toxic eff
 ects that might lead to little or no 
overall clinical benefi
 t. We suggest that in this population clinical 
benefi
 t should be assessed by changes in symptoms with known 
predictive value for morbidity and mortality. We designed novel 
objective criteria for the primary endpoint that showed effi
  cacy 
in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with MABp1. 
Our fi
 ndings suggest that development of a new class of agents 
that selectively target disease pathophysiology is feasible.

ULN and alanine aminotransferase ≤2⋅0 × the ULN or up 
to ≤3⋅0 × the ULN in patients with known liver 
metastases), and bone marrow function (absolute 
neutrophil count [neutrophil and bands] ≥1⋅5 × 10⁹/L), 
platelet counts between 150 and 450 × 10⁹/L, and 
haemoglobin concen 
trations 90 g/L or higher. We placed 
no restrictions on histological fi
 ndings or molecular 
aberrations, such as KRAS mutation. The estimated 
median life expectancy for such patients is approximately 
4·6 months, and possibly less when those with an ECOG 
performance status score of 0 are excluded.18 Patients had 
to agree to go through a 2-week washout period from 
previous cancer treatments and agents used to treat 
symptoms, such as corticosteroids or stimulants. Those 
with bowel obstruction, uncon 
trolled medical disorders, 
or dementia were excluded.
The study was done in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and in agreement with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines 
on Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol and all its 
amend 
ments were reviewed and approved by the 
appropriate independent ethics committees, and all 
patients provided written informed consent before 
participation.
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) 
was established to assess safety of the intervention at a 
prespecifi
 ed interim analysis after 50% enrolment. The 
IDMC 
was 
also 
responsible 
for 
recommending 
adjustments to the sample size based on the number of 
patients not assessable for the primary endpoint at the 
interim safety analysis.
Randomisation and masking
The study used a non-stratifi
 ed randomisation plan. The 
randomisation scheme was generated centrally with the 
Oracle Clinical Remote Data Capture application (version 
4.6). Patients were randomly assigned within blocks of 
six to receive MABp1 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. When a 
patient was assigned to treatment by the site investigator, 
the remote data capture system generated a unique code 
that was delivered via an interactive web response 
system. The contract drug distribution organisation had 
one-time access to download the unmasked list to enable 
labelling and shipping of the study drugs. The patients, 
investigators, the clinical research organisation, and the 
sponsor were unaware of treatment allocation until after 
completion of the study and database lock. The study 
drug and placebo were both sterile solutions for 
intravenous 
infusion 
with 
an 
almost 
identical 
appearance. They were provided in kits that consisted of 
one or two boxes, containing all the necessary drug or 
placebo for one patient to complete four cycles of therapy. 
Procedures
Patients in the antibody group received 7·5 mg/kg MABp1 
intravenously every 2 weeks for 8 weeks (four doses). 
Placebo was given intravenously with the same schedule. 
All patients received best supportive care. Use of agents 
with proven anticancer eff
 ects, investigational agents, 
immunosuppressive drugs, or drugs that inhibit tumour 
necrosis factor α or interleukin 1 was prohibited. Use of 
agents that might confound measure 
ment of the 
primary endpoint, such as cortico 
steroids, megestrol, or 
stimu 
lants, was restricted to events deemed medically 
necessary until the 8-week assessment was completed.
After the 8-week double-blind treatment period ended, 
all patients from either group were eligible to receive 
MABp1 in an open-label extension phase of the study, but 
the original treatment allocation and whether patients 
entered the open-label extension from the placebo group 
or the MABp1 group will not be revealed until after 
completion of the study. Assessment of the primary and 
secondary endpoints was based on data collected during 
the 8-week study period, as no further prospective 
assessments of effi
  cacy are being collected in the open-
label extension (only safety data are being collected). 
No information on subsequent antineoplastic therapy in 
patients who discontinue the study is being recorded.
Tumour assessments, DEXA scans, and appraisal with 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire were done before 
the fi
 rst dose and after 8 weeks of treatment. Routine 
laboratory chemistry assessments in blood and urine 
were done every 2 weeks. Platelet counts were done at a 
central laboratory (PPD Laboratories, Brussels, Belgium) 
with automated cell counters. Interleukin 6 con-
centrations in serum were measured at XBiotech, 
Austin, TX, USA, with a commercially available ELISA 
kit from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA). Study 
treatment could be discontinued if a patient had any 
adverse event of grade 3 or worse that was classifi
 ed as 
being probably or defi
 nitely related to study therapy. 
Treatment could also be stopped if the investigator 
deemed that any clinical adverse event, laboratory 
abnormality, or concurrent illness indicated that con-
tinued participation in the study was not in the patient’s 
best interest. No dose modifi
 cations were scheduled, but 
doses could be delayed for up to 7 days if patients had 
mild or moderate adverse events not judged to be related 
to the study drug.
DEXA is an accurate and precise method for the 
assessment of mass of bone, fat, and lean body 
compartments.19 The range for the coeffi
  cient of variation 
for serial measurements of lean body mass is 0·4–1·3%.20 
DEXA images were analysed by a central imaging vendor 
(VirtualScopics, Rochester, NY, USA), where a board-
certifi
 ed radiologist who was unaware of treatment 
allocation reviewed images for artifacts and confi
 rmed 
correct placement of subregion cut-lines and the 
plausibility of values calculated by the DEXA software for 
each compartment (lean, fat, and bone mass). The same 
DEXA machine and software version were used to assess 
all patients at screening and week 8. Intravenous or oral 
contrast medium could not be used within 14 days of the 
baseline or follow-up scans.

Tumours were measured with CT or MRI within 
4 weeks before and at 8 weeks after the fi
 rst dose of 
MABp1 or placebo. No additional radiological assess-
ments were done after week 8. The images were assessed 
by a board-certifi
 ed radiologist at a central vendor 
(VirtualScopics) who was unaware of treatment 
allocation.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a validated 
quality of life instrument for assessment of cancer-related 
symptoms. It consists of 30 items that encompass three 
symptom scales (pain, fatigue, and nausea or vomiting), 
six single-item symptom items, fi
 ve functional scales 
(physical, cognitive, role, emotional, and social), and one 
scale assessing global health status and quality of life. 
Each scale has two to fi
 ve items, and all items have four 
response categories (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very 
much), except for two items assessing overall health 
status and quality of life, which use seven-point scales.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was defi
 ned as stable or increased 
lean body mass on DEXA and stability or improvement 
of two of three symptom measures of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 (fatigue, pain, and anorexia) at week 8 
compared with baseline (fi
 gure 1). This endpoint was 
prospectively designed as part of the Scientifi
 c Guidance 
procedure with the EMA to combine objective and self-
reported measures of health status and provide a direct 
measure of clinical benefi
 t that would correlate with 
overall survival. The primary endpoint was not reassessed 
during the open-label extension period. 
Secondary endpoints were pharmaco 
dynamic res 
ponse, 
assessed by measurement of interleukin 6 concentrations 
in serum (systemic infl
 ammation), platelet counts 
(paraneoplastic thrombocytosis), and other markers of 
infl
 ammatory response, and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores for 
functional performance (role, work, and social functions) 
and global quality of life at 8 weeks compared with 
baseline. Tumour response was classifi
 ed according to the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines 
(version 1.1). Additionally, safety was assessed by 
comparing the incidence of adverse events and serious 
adverse events between groups during the 8-week study 
period. Events were classifi
 ed in accordance with the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Serious adverse 
events were all events related to underlying cancer 
progression.
The study design did not enable comparison of overall 
survival between treatment groups. Rather, the study was 
designed to establish the usefulness of the primary 
endpoint to predict treatment effi
  cacy. On the 
recommendation of the study chair, the protocol was 
amended on Nov 20, 2014, to include survival as a 
measure of safety. Approximately a third of patients had 
discontinued treatment by the time this amendment 
came into eff
 ect and, therefore, were not available for the 
analysis of overall survival. In a post-hoc analysis we also 
compared the response between groups in terms of the 
individual elements of the primary endpoint.
Statistical analysis
The trial was designed to have 80% power to detect 
20% diff
 erence in eff
 ect size between groups, with the one-
sided α value set at 0·0125 to account for the 
multicomponent composite primary endpoint. For the 
secondary and exploratory endpoints, signifi
 cance was 
tested with a two-sided p value of 0·05. The initial sample 
size needed to achieve this power was calculated to be 
264 patients (176 in the MABp1 group and 88 in the placebo 
group). With the assumption of 5% dropout, we therefore 
aimed to recruit 276 patients. During the planned interim 
review of safety data, the IDMC recommended extending 
recruitment to include 20% more patients than needed 
(ie, a total of 316 patients) to compensate for missing 
endpoint data at the end of the study.
The primary effi
  cacy analysis was done in a modifi
 ed 
intention-to-treat population that included only patients 
who had received at least one dose of the assigned 
treatment. Patients with missing primary endpoint data 
and those who received treatments on the restricted 
medicines list were classifi
 ed as not having achieved the 
primary endpoint. We also did a per-protocol analysis for 
the primary endpoint in patients who had completed 
8 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was 
compared between the MABp1 and placebo groups with 
Pearson’s χ² test. Relative risk (RR) and unadjusted odds 
ratios (ORs) are presented with 95% CIs. A sensitivity 
analysis was done for the primary endpoint, stratifi
 ed by 
ECOG performance score, sex, geographical locations, 
and KRAS mutation status.
Paraneoplastic thrombocytosis and systemic infl
 am-
mation were assessed by ANCOVA with use of the GLM 
procedure in SAS (version 9.3). Treatment group and 
overall response status were used as factors and baseline 
values as covariates. The fi
 ndings are presented as

diff
 erences in derived least squares means with two-
sided p values. To investigate whether possible 
asymmetric distribution of the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores 
aff
 ected the covariance analysis, we reanalysed this 
measure with a mixed model that included a restricted 
maximum likelihood variance component.
Univariable analysis was done to assess the assumption 
of normality. Tukey’s method for identifying outliers was 
used as a guide.21 To make the range more expansive 
(ie, to detect extreme values), we extended the range for 
normal values from the IQR to the 5th to 95th quantiles 
and deemed values greater or smaller than three times 
the limits of this range to be extreme outliers. ANCOVA 
was used to assess change in interleukin 6 concentrations 
in serum and platelet counts from baseline to the fi
 nal 
visit. For the interleukin 6 response, a relative change of 
less than 25%, computed as [(post-treatment – pre-
treatment) / pretreatment], was taken to be a decrease in 
concentration.
All patients enrolled after the protocol amendment in 
November, 2014, and who gave consent were followed up 
for survival by the individual study centres after 
completion or discontinuation of treatment. Survival was 
measured from the fi
 rst dose of study drug to the date of 
death. We compared overall survival in the two groups 
with the log-rank test. Data for patients who were alive at 
the fi
 nal follow-up were censored. Patients who completed 
or discontinued the study or were lost to follow-up before 
the protocol amendment were not included in the survival 
analysis. We used a univariate Cox model to investigate 
the association of the grouping variable and to compute 
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.
The threshold for signifi
 cance was p=0·05 (two-sided). 
All analyses were done with SAS version 9.3. This 
study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT02138422.
Role of the funding source
The funder was involved in the study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and the

Results
Of 458 patients screened between May 20, 2014, and 
Nov 3, 2015, 333 were randomly assigned to study 
groups and 309 received at least one dose of study 
treatment (fi
 gure 2). The median duration of follow-up 
for the double-blind phase of the trial was 49 days 
(IQR 48–50) in the MABp1 group and 49 days (48–51) in 
the placebo group, and for the entire study population, 
including the open-label phase, was 6⋅1 months 
(IQR 2⋅7–11⋅1). 202 patients entered the open-label 
MABp1 phase of the study, 140 (68%) of 207 patients 
in the MABp1 group and 62 (61%) of 102 patients 
from the placebo group. The demographic and clinical 
characteristics were well balanced in the two groups at 
baseline (table 1).
Groups did not diff
 er for use of corticosteroid (one 
patient in each group) or megestrol acetate (one patient 
in the MABp1 group) and no patients who received 
these agents were responders. In the open-label 
extension 
49 
(24%) 
202 
of 
patients 
received 
corticosteroids. Use of corticosteroids in the open-label 
extension phase did not change the adverse event 
profi
 le, which suggests that the combination is safe. 
The eff
 ect of steroids on the effi
  cacy of MABp1 cannot 
be assessed as no endpoint data were collected during 
the open-label extension period. No patients received 
antineoplastic therapies in the 8-week double-blind 
phase or the open-label extension phase.
Five (5%) of 102 patients in the placebo group received 
restricted treatments and were classifi
 ed as not having 
achieved the primary endpoint per protocol. 45 (22%) of 
207 patients in the MABp1 group and 24 (24%) of 
102 patients in the placebo group did not achieve the 
primary endpoint because of disease progression before 
assessment at 8 weeks, and seven (3%) and fi
 ve (5%),

respectively, had no evidence of progression but did not 
have endpoint data.
The primary endpoint was assessed in 309 patients in 
the modifi
 ed intention-to-treat population (207 in the 
MABp1 group and 102 in the placebo group) and 
252 patients in the per-protocol population (169 in the 
MABp1 group and 83 in the placebo group). Signifi
 cantly 
more patients in the MABp1 group than in the placebo 
group achieved the primary endpoint (68 [33%] of 207 vs 
19 [19%] of 102; RR 1·76, 95% CI 1·12–2·77, p=0·0045). 
The diff
 erence was also signifi
 cant in the per-protocol 
population (68 [40%] of 169 vs 19 [23%] of 83; RR 1·76, 
95% CI 1·14–2·72, p=0·0033). The sensitivity analysis 
showed some signifi
 cant eff
 ects in the MABp1 group 
(table 2). Additional analysis of the primary endpoint 
with 1 kg or more as the cutoff
  for change in lean body 
mass also showed a signifi
 cant improvement in favour of 
the MABp1 group (appendix p 6). When assessed for the 
individual components of the primary endpoint (ie, lean 
body mass, pain, fatigue, anorexia), the treatment groups 
did not diff
 er (table 3). Changes in platelet count and 
concentrations of interleukin 6 did, however, diff
 er 
signifi
 cantly between the treatment and placebo groups, 
although there no signifi
 cant diff
 erences from baseline 
were seen for other pharmacodynamic outcomes 
(table 4).
Scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 were available for all 
309 patients at baseline, and 241 patients at week 8 
(79 [77%] of 102 patients in the placebo group and 
162 [78%] of 207 patients in the MABp1 group). The most 
common reason for the absence of completed 
questionnaires was patients stopping the study treatment 
early because of disease progression. Scores did not 
diff
 er signifi
 cantly between groups (appendix p 1). The 
results remained the same when this measure was 
assessed with the mixed model (data not shown). 
Assessment of univariable normality of change in 
interleukin 6 concentrations identifi
 ed four extreme 
outlier concentrations greater than three times the upper 
limit of the of 5th to 95th quantile range (222 mg/mL): 
275, 746, 1216, and 10 
176 mg/mL. The least squares mean 
change for the MABp1 group was 51⋅1 (SD 36⋅3) pg/mL 
including the four outliers and 1⋅6 (1⋅9) pg/mL after they 
were removed from the analysis. The univariate analysis 
of the platelet count showed no signifi
 cant asymmetry 
(appendix p 5).
Other markers of infl
 ammatory response, such as 
platelet-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, 
and C-reactive protein, were assessed and found to be 
well balanced between the MABp1 and placebo groups at 
baseline (mean neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios 4·6 
[SD 2·7] and 4·5 [3·2], p=0·87 and platelet-to-lymphocyte 
ratios 196 [90] and 207 [139], p=0·42). No signifi
 cant 
changes were seen at 8 weeks (mean change in 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·36–1·19 in 
the MABp1 group vs 1·1, 0·55–1·65 in the placebo group, 
p=0·35; mean change in platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio 41, 
17–66 vs 26, 10–43, p=0·32). Concentrations of C-reactive 
protein varied widely, and we could detect no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between groups.
After 8 weeks of treatment, 35 (17%) of 207 patients in 
the MABp1 group had stable disease compared with

disease progression 1·26, 95 CI 0·93–1·70, p=0·14). There 
were no complete or partial responses as defi
 ned by 
RECIST in either MABp1 or placebo groups. Patient-
reported outcomes did not diff
 er signifi
 cantly between 
groups (data not shown).
Among the 87 patients who achieved the primary 
endpoint, we found improvements from baseline in lean 
body mass and anorexia and reductions in the fatigue 
and pain scores (table 5). Changes for all individual 
measures of pharmacodynamic and other self-reported 
outcomes from baseline were signifi
 cant after adjustment 
for baseline values (table 5). The incidence of 
paraneoplastic thrombocytosis was increased in patients 
who did not achieve the primary endpoint but decreased 
in those who did (median change 23 × 10⁹/L, IQR –11 to 60 
vs –11 × 10⁹/L, –38 to 39, p=0⋅00017). 
Overall survival data were available for 116 patients in 
the MABp1 group and 59 in the placebo group. Of the 
59 placebo patients, 36 (61%) entered the open-label 
extension and received MABp1 and 23 (39%) did not. An 
exploratory survival analysis was done to compare 
overall survival between patients who received MABp1 
and those who received only placebo. Survival was 
measured from the fi
 rst dose of study treatment to the 
date of death. At a median follow-up of 6⋅1 months, 21 
(91%) of 23 patients who had received only placebo had 
died, compared with 93 (80%) of 116 who had received 
MABp1. The median survival was 6⋅1 months 
(IQR 4⋅4–7⋅2) in the MABp1 group compared with 
2⋅4 months (1⋅9–3⋅2) in the placebo group among 
patients who did not receive MABp1 (log-rank p=0⋅0002; 
appendix p 4). At a median of 6⋅1 months of follow-up, 
126 [57%] of 222 who did not achieve the primary 
endpoint and 49 [56%] of 87 who did were available for 
the survival analysis. Among these patients, 110 (87%) 
classifi
 ed as not having achieved the primary endpoint 
had died, compared with 25 (51%) who had achieved the 
primary endpoint. The median overall survival was 
4·2 months (95% CI 3·2–5·3) for those who did not and 
11·5 (8·3–13·2) for those who did achieve the primary 
endpoint (HR 0·31, 95% CI 0·20–0·48, log rank 
p<0·0001; appendix p 3). 
159 patients receiving MABp1 and 79 receiving placebo 
had at least one adverse event (table 6). Most of these 
events were grade 1 or 2 and seemed to be related to the 
underlying colorectal cancer. Peripheral oedema or 
ascites could potentially confound the assessment of lean 
body mass as measured by DEXA. However, our 
composite primary endpoint was intended to correct for 
this potential confounder. Only two (3%) of 68 patients 
who achieved the primary endpoint in the MABp1 group 
and one (5%) of 19 who did so in the placebo group had 
fl
 uid overload at the week 8 assessment. This fi
 nding is 
supported by an analysis of change in symptoms assessed 
with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in patients with gains in lean 
body mass, which showed a signifi
 cant correlation 
between improvement in lean body mass and symptom 
recovery (appendix p 1). In the open-label extension, 
49 (24%) of 202 patients received corticosteroids, but use 
of these drugs did not change the adverse profi
 le, which 
suggests that the combination is safe (appendix pp 7–10).

phosphatase increase (nine [4%] vs two [2%]), fatigue 
(six [3%] vs seven [7%]), and increase in aspartate 
aminotransferase concentration (six [3%] vs two [2%]). 
One patient in the MABp1 group discontinued treatment 
because of deep vein thrombosis in an upper extremity 1 
week after the fi
 rst dose. This event was classifi
 ed as 
probably related to the study treatment by the investigator, 
but was reclassifi
 ed as being unrelated by the sponsor 
after analysis of similar events in all studies of MABp1.
The incidence of serious adverse events did not diff
 er 
signifi
 cantly between the MABp1 and placebo groups 
(47 [23%] vs 33 [32%], p=0·07). 17 (8%) patients in the 
MABp1 group and 11 (11%) in the placebo group died. No 
deaths were deemed to be related to study treatment. 
Rather, all seemed to be related to the patients’ 
underlying disease. The reported causes of deaths were 
as follows: MABp1 group, disease progression (n=5), 
CNS metastasis (n=1), bowel obstruction (n=1), hepatic 
failure 
(n=1), 
disease 
progression 
(n=2), 
renal 
impairment (n=1), peritonitis (secondary to surgical 
complication, n=1), dehydration (n=1), respiratory failure 
(n=1), hip fracture (n=1), and cardio 
pulmonary failure 
(n=1); and in the placebo group, anaemia (n=1), disease 
progression (n=2), dyspnoea (n=1), renal failure (n=1), 
liver failure (n=1), respiratory failure (n=1), general 
health deterioration (n=1), and thromboembolic event 
(n=1). Additionally, three patients (one in the MABp1 
group and two in the placebo group) died at home after 
leaving the study. The causes were unknown and were 
reported only as “death”, but due to the advanced state of 
disease in these patients, the events were judged 
probably to be secondary to disease progression by the 
study sponsor.
In a post-hoc analysis, the incidence of serious adverse 
events was lower among patients who achieved the 
primary endpoint than among those who did not 
(fi
 ve [6%] of 87 vs 65 [29%] of 222, p<0·0001) and that of 
stable disease at week 8 was greater (21 [24%] of 87 vs 
26 [12%] of 222, p=0·0062). A similar eff
 ect was observed 
for survival when the analysis was stratifi
 ed by EORTC 
QLQ-C30 score and pharmacodynamic endpoints 
(appendix p 2), although the survival benefi
 t associated 
with achieving the primary endpoint seemed to be 
stronger than the benefi
 ts associated with the individual 
measures. This fi
 nding prompted an investigation of 
whether any additive interaction existed between DEXA 
response status and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores, by use of a 
multivariate Cox model, which showed an interaction 
(pinteraction=0·043). Thus, the joint eff
 ect of assessment by 
these methods was stronger than the eff
 ects of the 
individual components.
Discussion
With a novel composite endpoint that combined objective 
and self-reported measures of symptoms, we were able to 
assess responses to a new antibody therapy for refractory 
colorectal cancer. MABp1, a monoclonal antibody 
targeting the potent infl
 ammatory cytokine interleukin 
1α, was derived from a natural human immune response 
and used to block tumour-related infl
 ammation in 
patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Earlier fi
 ndings 
in patients with various advanced cancers had suggested 
antineoplastic eff
 ects of antibody monotherapy, including 
unique observations of resolution of disease-related 
morbidities.12 These data led to monitoring of specifi
 c 
debilitating symptoms being considered as a basis for a 
primary endpoint to assess response to treatment. EMA 
regulatory guidance for the development of new cancer 
therapies states that “symptom control, if related to anti-
tumour eff
 ects, is a valid measure of therapeutic activity 
and may serve as a primary endpoint in late line therapy 
studies”. 
1 We therefore sought advice from the EMA 
Scientifi
 c Advice Working Party to enable us to design a 
the study that used measures of disease symptoms as a 
primary endpoint. 
Stability or improvement in objective and subjective 
 
clinical measures after 8 weeks formed the bases of the 
primary endpoint in this study, and were taken to indicate 
a favourable disease course. Not achieving the primary 
endpoint was taken to indicate a relatively poor prognosis.

Signifi
 cantly more patients taking MABp1 than placebo 
were classifi
 ed as having achieved the primary endpoint. 
Some 
pharmacodynamic 
measures 
(eg, 
systemic 
infl
 ammation and paraneoplastic thrombocytosis) were 
also signifi
 cantly better in the MABp1 group than in the 
placebo group. These fi
 ndings indicated that treatment 
with MABp1 had important clinical benefi
 ts for patients 
with advanced colorectal cancer.
Infl
 ammation is well recognised as a central feature in 
the transformation processes of malignant disease and 
in creating a protumour microenvironment that is rich 
in essential remodelling and angiogenic factors.22–24 
Effi
  cacy, and conversely treatment failure, with cytotoxic 
chemo 
therapy might be at least partly explained by the 
eff
 ects these agents have on infl
 ammatory mechanisms 
and, subsequently, the tumour microenvironment.25 
Never 
theless, no targeted anti-infl
 ammatory approach to 
the treatment of cancer has yet led to an approved 
therapy.
To clarify the importance and relevance of our primary 
endpoint in the assessment of patients’ outcomes, we did 
a detailed post-hoc analysis of its component measures 
and all other correlates for outcomes measured in the 
study. The analysis showed that the primary endpoint 
was associated with signifi
 cant positive gains in lean 
body mass and clinically relevant reductions in fatigue, 
pain, and anorexia. Additionally, improvements were 
seen for almost every measure of antitumour activity. We 
found that neither the EORTC QLQ-C30 scores nor 
DEXA measures alone revealed signifi
 cant diff
 erences 
between groups. Individually, therefore, these measures 
could not have served to assess treatment response.
As well as measuring the eff
 ects of treatment, the 
primary endpoint off
 ered new perspective on the natural 
history of colorectal cancer. 19% of patients in the placebo 
group achieved the primary endpoint, which suggests 
that even in patients with advanced disease, compensatory 
responses to tumours, probably involving immuno-
regulatory mechanisms, can still operate to control 
disease. With this in mind, we emphasise that MABp1 
was isolated from a natural immune response. Although 
much attention has been given to the possible role for 
increasing cell-mediated immunity to treat cancer, less 
focus has been given to the potential for augmenting 
humoral immunity to fi
 ght the disease. Natural 
antitumour and immunomodulatory antibodies are 
present in human plasma,26–28 and our fi
 ndings provide 
evidence that these antibodies can be useful as 
therapeutic agents against cancer. Investigating the 
nature of the responses seen in patients in the placebo 
group, specifi
 cally whether they were related to 
endogenous humoral immunity, was beyond the scope of 
this study. We did, however, confi
 rm that no patient in 
the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint because 
of endogenous responses of antibodies to interleukin 1α 
(data not shown). From these fi
 ndings, the possibility 
that additional endogenous humoral responses regulate 
disease progression in cancer patients must be 
considered, along with the possibility that these could 
provide a potential source of candidate therapeutic 
antibodies.
The criteria we developed for the primary endpoint 
have several advantages compared with traditional 
endpoints. Studies of overall survival need large 
populations and often long follow-up times. The primary 
endpoint used in this study enabled rapid assessment of 
treatment effi
  cacy in a relatively small sample of patients. 
Therefore, this approach could reduce the time and 
expense of developing new agents. Patients can ethically 
be main 
tained on monotherapy versus placebo for the 
duration of the endpoint assessment, since this was done 
after only 8 weeks of treatment. The short time needed 
also makes it reasonable for patients to anticipate access 
to active therapy under a crossover design (which in our 
experience is crucial to patients’ welfare). Finally, the 
primary endpoint directly measures important aspects of 
patients’ serving as a measure of benefi
 t from treatment.
The study design had some limitations. While achieving 
the primary endpoint correlates with substantial overall 
individual survival benefi
 t, it is diffi
  cult to translate the 
data for meeting the endpoint criteria and the incidence of 
response over placebo in the present study into a 
prediction of overall survival benefi
 t for the entire 
treatment population. Further investigation will be needed 
to improve understanding of how clinical response can be 
used to classify such correlations. A large phase 3 study of 
MABp1 in overall survival as the primary endpoint is 
underway (NCT01767857). Our study generally assessed 
patients with very advanced disease and, therefore, the 
occurrence of disease progression resulted in some being 
unable to remain in the study long enough for analysis of 
the primary endpoint at 8 weeks. Since the outcome of the 
study is binary—response or no response to treatment—
all patients who did not reach the 8-week endpoint were 
necessarily classifi
 ed as not having achieved the primary 
endpoint, which dilutes the potential to observe treatment 
eff
 ect. The result of this diffi
  culty was highlighted with the 
relatively strong eff
 ects in the per protocol population, 
where 40% of patients in the MABp1 group compared 
with 23% in the placebo group achieved the primary 
endpoint. MABp1 might improve the effi
  cacy of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, particularly if disease progression is partly 
related to the induction of infl
 ammation and angiogenic 
factors in the tumour microenvironment.29,30 Studies of 
MABp1 in combination therapy regimens are being 
planned.
In conclusion, MABp1, an antibody derived from 
natural human immunity, is intended to augment 
endogenous immunoregulatory mechanisms in patients 
to help antagonise the chronic infl
 ammatory process 
involved 
in 
tumour 
growth 
and 
disease 
progression. 
A 
novel 
endpoint that combined self-reported and objective 
measures to assess the eff
 ects of antibody monotherapy

 cant clinical benefi
