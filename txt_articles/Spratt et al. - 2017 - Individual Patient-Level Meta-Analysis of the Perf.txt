Purpose
To perform the first meta-analysis of the performance of the genomic classifier test, Decipher, in
men with prostate cancer postprostatectomy.
Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Decipher genomic resource information database were searched for
published reports between 2011 and 2016 of men treated by prostatectomy that assessed the
benefit of the Decipher test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models fit to individual patient
data were performed; meta-analyses were conducted by pooling the study-specific hazard ratios
(HRs) using random-effects modeling. Extent of heterogeneity between studies was determined
with the I2 test.
Results
Five studies (975 total patients, and 855 patients with individual patient-level data) were eligible for
analysis, with a median follow-up of 8 years. Of the total cohort, 60.9%, 22.6%, and 16.5% of
patients were classified by Decipher as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. The 10-year
cumulative incidence metastases rates were 5.5%, 15.0%, and 26.7% (P , .001), respectively, for
the three risk classifications. Pooling the study-specific Decipher HRs across the five studies
resulted in an HR of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.39 to 1.67; I2 = 0%) per 0.1 unit. In multivariable analysis of
individual patient data, adjusting for clinicopathologic variables, Decipher remained a statistically
significant predictor of metastasis (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.47; P , .001) per 0.1 unit. The C-index
for 10-year distant metastasis of the clinical model alone was 0.76; this increased to 0.81 with
inclusion of Decipher.
Conclusion
The genomic classifier test, Decipher, can independently improve prognostication of patients
postprostatectomy, as well as within nearly all clinicopathologic, demographic, and treatment
subgroups. Future study of how to best incorporate genomic testing in clinical decision-making and
subsequent treatment recommendations is warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Stratifying patients’ risk of localized prostate cancer
(PCa) continues to be clinically challenging.1,2
Fundamentally, National Comprehensive Cancer
Network risk stratification is based on the serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, staging pri-
marily from a digital rectal examination, and the
Gleason score (originally described approximately
40 years ago).3 Growing molecular evidence has
raised discussion around the solitary use of routine
clinicopathologic risk factors and nomograms for
predicting disease progression.4,5
Decipher
(GenomeDx
Biosciences,
Van-
couver, British Columbia, Canada) is a 22-gene
genomic classifier that has been developed to aid
in prognostication of patients who have un-
dergone radical prostatectomy (RP).6 It has been
shown that the Decipher post-RP test discrimi-
nates risk of metastasis and PCa-specific mor-
tality, improves accuracy of risk stratification

 above and beyond clinicopathologic risk factors or commonly used
models, and impacts physician and patient post-RP treatment de-
cisions.6-15 However, the cohort size and event rate in the previous
validation studies did not allow for a thorough investigation into the
performance of Decipher, especially within individual clinicopath-
ologic, demographic, or treatment subgroups.
Therefore, the present meta-analysis with individual patient-
level genomic and clinicopathologic data was conducted to better
understand the performance of Decipher to prognosticate risk of
metastases. Additionally, by pooling studies, we aimed to explore
the correlation and performance of Decipher in multiple clinically
relevant subgroups within a multi-institutional and multiethnic
cohort of patients with adverse pathology at time of RP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Selection
Systematic literature searches were performed (July 1, 2016) using
two databases (MEDLINE [via PubMed] and EMBASE) for all studies
published from January 1, 2011, through July 1, 2016. Controlled vo-
cabulary was used in the formation of the search strategy.
The search strategy contained two major components linked together
with the AND operator: (1) genomic classifier AND (2) prostate. All search
results were imported into a bibliographic management tool and dupli-
cates were removed. Then, leveraging the Decipher genomic resource
information database, 1,692 patients from seven independent studies of the
Decipher test who underwent RP were identified.6-12 These studies were all
present in the previous bibliographic search strategy and duplicates were
removed electronically.
Data extraction. Two investigators (K.Y. and D.E.S) independently
reviewed each manuscript. Studies eligible for inclusion were required to
(1) have used the Decipher genomic test, (2) been performed in men
postprostatectomy, (3) have assessed rates of development of metastatic
disease, and (4) include only patients who reached an undetectable PSA
level after surgery (Fig 1). Of the seven eligible studies, patients from Erho
et al6 were excluded because this study was used to discover the Decipher
genomic classifier. In addition, the Klein et al9 study was excluded because
of its case-control design, which is not compatible with survival analysis
(Appendix Table A1, online only). After application of these requirements,
five studies remained, comprising 975 patients. Patients who were not
randomly selected from the case-cohort studies (n = 120) were excluded
from the individual patient-level analysis to avoid bias in estimation of the
hazard ratios [HRs].7,10,16 Individual patient genomic and clinicopatho-
logic data were gathered from each study group (n = 855) after institutional
review boards at the participating institutions approved the research
protocol under which the data were collected. Finally, the genomic data
from all prior published studies were deposited into the genomic resource
information database.7,8,10-12 Approval to obtain long-term clinical out-
comes data were obtained from each study’s authors, and these data were
then linked to the genomic and clinical information.7,8,10-12 Data ex-
traction and study selection followed the PRISMA-IPD (Preferred
Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual
Participant Data) statement.17
End points. The primary end point of the study was to determine the

 time to regional or distant metastases on multivariable analyses while
adjusting for pre-RP PSA level, RP Gleason score, margin status,
extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesical invasion (SVI), and lymph
node invasion (LNI). Metastasis end point was defined as either bone,
viscera, or LN metastasis documented radiographically by computed to-
mography or bone scan. The secondary end point was to assess the
performance of Decipher to predict time to metastases by pooling study-
specific HRs across all five studies (N = 975).
Preplanned analyses using the individual patient level data (n = 855)
included (1) determining the correlation of Decipher with pre-RP PSA, RP
Gleason score, margin status, ECE, SVI, and LNI; and (2) determining the
ability of Decipher to prognosticate time to regional or distant metastases
in subgroups by race, pre-RP PSA, RP Gleason score, margin status, ECE,
SVI, LNI, and adjuvant/salvage treatment modality (androgen deprivation
therapy [ADT] or radiation therapy [RT]).
Patients received either no postoperative treatment before metastasis
onset or were treated with adjuvant RT, salvage RT, adjuvant ADT, or
salvage ADT. Adjuvant RT and salvage RT were defined by initiation of
therapy at PSA levels of , 0.2 and $ 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Adjuvant RT
or salvage RT was performed using three-dimensional conformal RT or
intensity modulated radiation therapy. Adjuvant ADT and salvage ADT
were defined by initiation of therapy within 12 months and after
12 months post-RP, respectively.
Calculation of Decipher Score
The expression values for the 22 prespecified biomarkers that con-
stitute Decipher were extracted from the normalized data matrix and
entered into the random forest algorithm that was locked with defined
tuning and weighting parameters as previously described.6 The Decipher
score read-out is a continuous score between 0 and 1, with higher scores
indicating greater risk of metastasis. Previously established and locked cut
points of 0.45 and 0.60 were used to categorize patients into low-, in-
termediate-, and high-risk groups.10,12
Statistical Analysis
Association of Decipher with individual clinicopathologic variables
was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. In time-to-
event analyses, event times were defined as the time from RP to metastasis.
Cumulative incidence curves were constructed using Fine-Gray competing
risks analysis to estimate the risk of metastasis over time, with deaths from
other causes as a competing risk.18 Time-dependent C indices were
constructed using the approach described by Heagerty et al.19 The C index
of the combined model was estimated by subjecting the model to boot-
strapping with 100 resamples. Analysis of individual patient data used
stratified Cox univariable analysis (UVA) and multivariable analysis (MVA)
proportional hazards models to evaluate the association of Decipher with
time to metastasis, where deaths from other causes was considered as
a competing risk.20 In these analyses, institution was modeled as a strat-
ification variable to allow for variation of underlying hazard functions by
stratification levels due to the varying patient populations and referral
patterns.21 In a sensitivity analysis, we fitted an MVA Cox proportional
hazards model adjusting for RT and ADT as time-dependent covariates.
Study-specific HRs were pooled using a random effects model according to
the inverse variance method described by DerSimonian and Laird.22
Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the I2 statistic. Egger’s
regression test was used to evaluate publication bias. All statistical tests
were two-sided and analyses were performed in R version 3.1 (R Foun-
dation, Vienna, Austria).

 individual patient data, the median follow-up time for censored
patients was 8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 5 to 11 years). Patients
were treated with RP between 1990 and 2010. The median age of
patients at the time of RP was 60 years (IQR, 55 to 65 years); 41.9%
had ECE, 27.8% had SVI, and 26% had an RP Gleason score of 8 to 10
(Table 1). Overall, 51.3% of the patients received only prostatectomy
with no additional second-line therapy.
The median Decipher score for the cohort (n = 855) was 0.37
(IQR, 0.24 to 0.54). Of these patients, 60.9% (n = 520), 22.6%
(n = 193), and 16.5% (n = 141) were categorized as being at,
respectively, low, intermediate, and high risk by Decipher.
Correlation of Decipher With Clinicopathologic Features
Decipher was significantly, albeit only low to moderately,
correlated with RP Gleason score (r = 0.27), EPE (r = 0.20), SVI
(r = 0.19), and LNI (r = 0.13; all P , .001). Decipher was not
significantly correlated with preoperative PSA or surgical margin
status (Fig 2).
Decipher As a Predictor of Metastasis
During the study, 82 patients experienced metastasis. Cu-
mulative incidence curves demonstrated that Decipher categories
significantly stratified risk of metastasis (P , .001; Fig 3). Patients
categorized as low, intermediate, and high risk by Decipher had
a 5-year cumulative incidence of metastasis of 2.4%, 5.8%, and
15.2%, respectively; and a 10-year rate of 5.5%, 15.0% and 26.7%,
respectively.
On UVA, all variables except pre-RP PSA showed significant
association with time to metastasis (Table 2). On MVA, Decipher
remained a significant predictor of metastasis (P , .001). Decipher

 had a HR of 1.30 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.47) per 0.1 unit increase in
score. Analyzing Decipher as a categorical variable (low risk
as reference), Decipher high-risk patients had the greatest
hazard for metastases (HR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.86 to 5.88;
P , .001), even compared with Gleason score 8-10 (Gleason #
3+4 as reference; HR 3.23; 95% CI, 1.75 to 5.93; P , .001). In
a sensitivity analysis, adjusting for RT and ADT as time-
dependent covariates, Decipher remained a significant pre-
dictor of metastasis (Appendix Table A2, online only). The
C-index for 10-year distant metastases of the clinical model
alone was 0.76 and increased to 0.81 with inclusion of
Decipher.
Pooling study-specific HRs across the five studies (N = 975)
demonstrated that the Decipher score was significantly associated
with time to metastasis (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.39 to 1.67) per 0.1-unit
increase; I2 = 0%; Fig 4A).
Performance of Decipher Within Individual Subgroups
Decipher significantly predicted risk of metastasis irre-
spective of pre-RP PSA levels, RP Gleason score, surgical margin
status, and ECE, SVI, and LNI status (Fig 4B; Appendix Figs A1A-
A1C, online only). Additionally, Decipher was associated with
risk of metastasis in subgroups of white men, men treated with RP
alone, those treated with RP and salvage RT, and those treated
with RP and ADT (Fig 4B). For black patients (n = 106) and those
of any race treated with adjuvant RT (n = 140) or ADT (n = 44),
Decipher approached, but did not reach, statistical significance
for predicting risk of metastasis (HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.95 to 2.15];
HR, 1.86 [95% CI, 0.92 to 5.62]; and HR 1.52 [95% CI, 0.97 to
2.39], respectively).
Assessment of Publication Bias
A funnel plot of the five included studies demonstrated ex-
cellent symmetry (Appendix Fig A2, online only). In this analysis,
Egger regression test resulted in a P value of .60, indicating a low
probability of publication bias (Appendix Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
Accurately understanding the risk of recurrence after initial
therapy for cancer is critical to determine goals of care, ther-
apeutic recommendations, and the design of future clinical
trials. Men with PCa often have a long natural history after RP or
definitive RT, even for disease categorized as high risk according
to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, with an es-
timated median time to metastatic disease of 5 to 8 years after
biochemical recurrence.23,24 However, the subset of men who
will eventually develop metastatic disease is poorly understood
and not fully captured by clinicopathologic variables. For this
reason, there have been efforts to develop companion genomic
tests to provide clarity to classic phenotypic risk factors (ie,
Gleason score, PSA level, and T stage) and add independent
prognostic value.
Over the past several years, one of the commercially avail-
able genomic tests (Decipher) has been externally validated as

 a prognostic tool to predict time to metastasis in multiple in-
dependent studies.6-12 However, the sample size of each indi-
vidual study limited the ability to robustly assess the correlation
of Decipher with clinicopathologic risk factors, to assess the
overall performance of Decipher above standard clinicopath-
ologic risk factors, and to determine the performance of De-
cipher within relevant individual clinicopathologic risk groups.
Our analysis provides numerous findings into the associa-
tion of genomic and clinicopathologic risk and demonstrates
how they are complementary and impart unique biologic
information.
First, Decipher has a low-to-moderate correlation with RP
Gleason score, ECE, SVI, and LNI. Additionally, there was no
correlation of pre-RP PSA nor surgical margin status with
Decipher score. These results demonstrate that select clinico-
pathologic variables trend with Decipher scores; however, there
is a wide overlapping distribution of Decipher scores within
each subset (ie, Gleason # 3+4 v $ 8; Fig 2). Furthermore, it is
rational that surgical margin status, a function partially de-
pendent on the surgical procedure rather than the intrinsic
biology of the disease, would not correlate with the genomic
classifier results.
Second, in the present cohort of men with adverse pa-
thology after RP, 61% were classified as low risk by Decipher,
whereas only 17% were classified as high risk. Metastases rates
could readily be discriminated by the Decipher score (5 year:
2.4% v 15.2% for low and high Decipher score, respectively;
P , .001). Importantly, this prognostication was maintained on
MVA adjusting for pre-RP PSA, RP Gleason score, margin
status, ECE, SVI, and LNI (HR, 1.30 for each 0.1 increase in
Decipher score). Although clinicopathologic variables perform
reasonably well to predict who is at very low or very high risk of
recurrence, Decipher independently improves upon this to
further discriminate metastatic risk within these clinical risk
groups. This observation has important implications for de-
signing clinical trials for men with high-risk disease; use of
Decipher as an entry criterion or for stratification would enrich
the study population for meaningful clinical events (metas-
tasis), thereby increasing the event rate, decreasing the needed
sample size, and perhaps shortening trial length.
Last, given the large sample size of the present meta-
analysis, we were able to test the prognostic benefit of De-
cipher in numerous preplanned analyses of distinct clinico-
pathologic subgroups. Decipher improved the ability to predict
the cumulative incidence of metastases in nearly all subgroups
based on clinicopathologic factors, treatment factors, and de-
mographic factors. All subgroups reached statistical significance
except the adjuvant RT subgroup (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.90 to
5.62; P = .082) and the black race subgroup (HR, 1.43; 95% CI,
0.95 to 2.15; P = .087). Both exhibited elevated HRs associated
with Decipher, and the marginally nonsignificant tests may
reflect the small sample size of the subgroups. Given the recently
demonstrated disparities that exist for minorities undergoing
genomic sequencing, it will be important to have dedicated
efforts to increase tumor profiling for racial minorities.25 De-
spite this, it appears that the added benefit of using the Decipher
genomic classifier does not appear to be limited to a particular
subgroup; rather, it appears to add consistent benefit across all
subgroups (HR of all subgroups, 1.24 to 2.25).
The strength of our study is driven by the meta-analysis
methodology with individual patient-level genomic and clin-
icopathologic data from large multi-institutional cohorts, use
of a meaningful survival end point (ie, metastasis), and long-
term follow-up. However, this study is not without limitations.
First, the analysis is subject to the limitations associated with
the retrospective design of the individual studies (Appendix
Table A3, online only). Second, adjuvant and salvage treatments
were not randomized and thus differed based on institutional
and patient preferences. Third, our selection criteria included
only patients with adverse clinicopathologic features, thus
utility of Decipher in lower-risk PCa remains to be investigated.
Fourth, use of imaging for restaging post-treatment was not
standardized and, therefore, ascertainment bias is a potential
limitation of the current analyses. Last, there are further po-
tential social (eg, insurance and socioeconomic) factors,
patient-level factors (eg, comorbidities), treatment factors (eg,
duration of ADT and RT dose/field size), and tumor level
factors (eg, PSA kinetics) that were not accounted for but could
impact our results.
In conclusion, this study was performed to evaluate the
performance of Decipher to predict metastases in men with PCa
after RP. The results suggest that though Decipher only moderately
correlates with clinicopathologic variables, it independently adds
prognostic benefit over routine clinicopathologic variables to
predict metastases and appears to add benefit across a number of
clinically relevant subgroups. Decipher should be considered an
additive validated test to improve prognostication in high-risk men
after RP and to aid clinical decision-making and future clinical trial
design.
