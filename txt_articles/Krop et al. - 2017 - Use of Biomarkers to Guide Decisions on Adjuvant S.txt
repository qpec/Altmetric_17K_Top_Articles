Abstract
Purpose—This focused update addresses the use of MammaPrint (Agendia, Irvine, CA) to guide 
decisions on the use of adjuvant systemic therapy.
Methods—ASCO uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updates. For this focused update, 
the publication of the phase III randomized MINDACT (Microarray in Node-Negative and 1 to 3 
Positive Lymph Node Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy) study to evaluate the MammaPrint 
assay in 6,693 women with early-stage breast cancer provided a signal. An expert panel reviewed 
the results of the MINDACT study along with other published literature on the MammaPrint assay 
to assess for evidence of clinical utility.
Recommendations—If a patient has hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative, node-negative breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may be 
used in those with high clinical risk to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a good-prognosis population with potentially limited 
chemotherapy benefit. Women in the low clinical risk category did not benefit from chemotherapy 
regardless of genomic MammaPrint risk group. Therefore, the MammaPrint assay does not have 
clinical utility in such patients. If a patient has hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative, node-
positive breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may be used in patients with one to three positive 
nodes and a high clinical risk to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. 
However, such patients should be informed that a benefit from chemotherapy cannot be excluded, 
particularly in patients with greater than one involved lymph node. The clinician should not use 
the MammaPrint assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with hormone 
receptor–positive, HER2-negative, node-positive breast cancer at low clinical risk, nor any patient 
with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, because of the lack of definitive data in these 
populations.

INTRODUCTION
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guideline on the use 
of biomarkers to guide adjuvant therapy for early-stage invasive breast cancer was most 
recently published in February 2016.1 ASCO Guidelines are updated at regular intervals; 
however, there may be new evidence that potentially changes a recommendation and 
becomes available between scheduled updates. ASCO uses a signals approach to facilitate 
guideline updates. This approach is intended to identify new, potentially practice-changing 
data (ie, signals) that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach 
relies on routine literature searches and the expertise of ASCO Guideline Panel members to 
identify signals. The Methodology Supplement (www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines) 
provides additional information about this approach. For this focused update, the publication 
of the “Microarray in node-negative and one to three positive lymph node disease may avoid

 chemotherapy” (MINDACT) study, a randomized controlled trial on a 70-gene assay 
(MammaPrint; Agendia, Irvine, CA) provided the signal.2
THE BOTTOM LINE
Use of Biomarkers to Guide Decisions on Adjuvant Systemic Therapy for Women 
With Early-Stage Invasive Breast Cancer: ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline 
Focused Update
Guideline Question
For women with early-stage invasive breast cancer, which other biomarkers have 
demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on the need for adjuvant systemic 
therapy?
Target Population
Women with early-stage invasive breast cancer being considered for adjuvant systemic 
therapy
Target Audience
An Expert Panel was convened to update the clinical practice guideline recommendations 
based on a review of recently published literature.
Focused Update Recommendation(s)
Recommendation 1.1.1 (update of 2016 recommendation 1.7): If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
may be used in those with high clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform 
decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a 
good prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit (Type: evidence 
based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 1.1.2 (update of 2016 recommendation 1.7): If a patienthas ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
should not be used in those with low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to 
inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, because women in the 
low clinical risk category had excellent outcomes and did not appear to benefit from 
chemotherapy even with a genomic high-risk cancer (Type: evidence based; Evidence 
quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 1.2.1: (update of 2016 recommendation 1.7): If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
may be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at high clinical risk per 
MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a good prognosis population with potentially 
limited chemotherapy benefit. However, such patients should be informed that a benefit 
of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, particularly in patients with greater than one 
involved lymph node (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate).

 Recommendation 1.2.2: (update of 2016 recommendation 1.7): If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
should not be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at low clinical risk 
per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy. There are insufficient data on the clinical utility of MammaPrint in this 
specific patient population (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 1.3: (update of 2016 recommendation 1.8): If a patient has HER2-
positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the MammaPrint assay to guide 
decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Additional studies are required to address the 
role of MammaPrint in patients with this tumor subtype who are also receiving HER2-
targeted therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 1.4: (update of 2016 recommendation 1.9): If a patient has ER/PgR 
negative and HER2-negative (triple negative) breast cancer, the clinician should not 
use the MammaPrint assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: 
informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Patient information is available at www.cancer.net.
ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and 
improve cancer care, and that all patients should have the opportunity to 
participate.
The decision to update this aspect of the guideline was intended to convey any 
recommendation changes to the practicing community in a timely fashion. Although 
evidence on other aspects of the guideline may have become available after release of the 
guideline, no other strong signal likely to affect the recommendations has been identified to 
date. This approach acknowledges that frequent updating is not practical or necessary unless 
indicated by practice-changing evidence. It is important to note that new evidence, published 
in a peer-reviewed journal, about any ASCO guideline may be submitted at any time. Please 
access the ASCO Guidelines Wiki for more information on evidence submission at http://
www.asco.org/guidelineswiki. All new evidence submissions are reviewed by ASCO Staff 
for study selection eligibility requirements and by the Expert Panel co-chairs for a content 
assessment. If the new evidence is determined to constitute a signal, it will prompt an 
expedited update on the topic.
Focused updates for Clinical Practice Guidelines are approved by the Clinical Practice 
Guideline Committee, and this update reflects new evidence about recommendations 1.7 to 
1.9 on MammaPrint in the previous version of this guideline.1 This focused update reviews

 and analyzes new data about these recommendations while applying the same criteria of 
clinical utility as described in the 2016 guideline.
As stated in the 2016 guideline, a biomarker-based test is judged to have clinical utility if 
use of the test is associated with a favorable balance of benefits to harm compared with 
treatment of the patient in the absence of the biomarker test result. Benefits may include 
improvement in survival end points such as event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival 
(DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), or overall survival (OS).1 The Use of Biomarkers 
Update Committee clarified that reduction in toxicity of treatment also can be considered a 
benefit. For example, a biomarker test that provides evidence that a patient can be treated 
effectively with hormonal therapy alone provides benefit to that patient by avoiding the 
potential serious toxicity of chemotherapy.
GUIDELINE QUESTIONS
For women with early-stage invasive breast cancer, which other biomarkers have 
demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on the need for adjuvant systemic therapy: 
(a) in patients with estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)–positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (node-negative or node-
positive) breast cancer; (b) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer; and (c) in patients 
with triple-negative breast cancer?
As this focused update addresses the role of MammaPrint in early breast cancer, only the 
first clinical question from the original guideline is addressed here.
METHODS
This ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline focused update provides revised recommendations 
with a comprehensive discussion of the relevant literature for this specific biomarker 
identified through the methodology described above. The full guideline to which this 
revision applies and additional information are available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-
guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki. The complete list of recommendations, 
including the updated recommendation(s), is in Table 1.

individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate or low 
confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The 
use of words like “must,” “must not,” “should,” and “should not” indicate that a course of 
action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is 
latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all 
cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the

Guideline and Conflicts of Interest
The Expert Panel was assembled in accordance with ASCO’s Conflict of Interest Policy 
Implementation for Clinical Practice Guidelines (“Policy,” found at http://www.asco.org/
rwc). All members of the Expert Panel completed ASCO’s disclosure form, which requires 
disclosure of financial and other interests, including relationships with commercial entities 
that are reasonably likely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impact as a result of 
promulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; 
stock or other ownership; honoraria, consulting or advisory role; speaker’s bureau; research 
funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, 
accommodations, expenses; and other relationships. In accordance with the Policy, the 
majority of the members of the Expert Panel did not disclose any relationships constituting a 
conflict under the Policy.
Guideline Update Process
ASCO uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updating.3 This approach is intended to

 practice recommendations. The approach relies on routine literature searching and the 
expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. The Methodology 
Supplement (www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines) provides additional information about 
the signals approach.
For this focused update, the publication of the randomized controlled trial on MammaPrint 
provided the signal. The full ASCO Update Committee (Appendix Table A1, online only) 
was then convened to review the evidence. A summary of the relevant studies on this 
biomarker can be found in the Data Supplement.
The Expert Panel met via conference calls to consider the evidence for each of the 2017 
recommendations on MammaPrint (Appendix Table A2, online only). The guideline was 
circulated in draft form to the Expert Panel for review and approval. ASCO’s Clinical 
Practice Guidelines Committee reviewed and approved the final document. Because this was 
a focused update based on the signal described above, only MammaPrint was reviewed by 
the Panel for this update.
RESULTS
Study Characteristics
The MINDACTstudy was a randomized trial that included 6,693 women with histologically 
proven operable invasive breast cancer, zero to three positive nodes, and no distant 
metastases.2 Patients were recruited from 2007 to 2011. Only patients with node-negative 
disease were enrolled initially, and the study was amended to include women with one to 
three positive nodes in 2009. Each participant’s genomic risk was determined by using the 
MammaPrint assay, and clinical risk was determined by using a modified version of 
Adjuvant! Online (version 8.0 with HER2 status)4,5. The clinical risk classification criteria 
are included in the Data Supplement. Individuals with both low clinical and low genomic 
risk did not receive chemotherapy, but those at high clinical and high genomic risk received 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Those with discordant clinical and genomic risk results (high/low or 
low/high) were randomly assigned to chemotherapy or to no chemotherapy. Women in all 
groups were recommended to receive 7 years of hormonal therapy, if appropriate, on the 
basis of ER/PgR status.
The study included additional optional random assignments. First, participants who were 
allocated to chemotherapy could elect to be randomly assigned to receive an anthracycline-
containing regimen or a docetaxel-plus-capecitabine regimen. Second, participants with 
hormone receptor–positive breast cancer could be randomly assigned to a sequential regimen 
of tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 5 years, or to 7 years of letrozole only. 
Premenopausal women who entered random assignment had to have adequate ovarian 
function suppression during letrozole therapy. Results from these random assignments are 
yet to be reported.
The primary analysis of the study, which was reported in the recent publication,2 was to 
assess whether, among patients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-
expression profile who did not receive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% CI for 
Krop et al.

 the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastasis (distant metastasis–free survival, or 
DMFS) was 92% or greater. A prespecified secondary analysis was to estimate the efficacy 
of chemotherapy in those patients with discordant clinical and genomic risk results who 
were randomly assigned to chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy, but the study was not 
designed to detect a significant difference. An additional secondary analysis was to 
determine the proportion of patients who were assigned chemotherapy according to the 
clinical risk compared with the genomic risk.
The study included 6,693 participants, of whom 5,914 (88.4%) had ER/PgR–positive 
tumors, 6,043 (90.3%) had HER2-negative tumors, and 640 (9.6%) had triple-negative 
tumors. Of the 6,693 participants, 2,745 (41.0%) had tumors with low clinical and low 
genomic risks, 592 (8.8%) had tumors with low clinical risk and high genomic risk, 1,550 
(23.2%) had tumors with high clinical risk and low genomic risk, and 1,806 (27.0%) had 
tumors with high clinical and high genomic risks. This first report included a cutoff date of 
March 1, 2016, which corresponded to a median follow-up time of 5.0 years. Of the 644 
women who represented the primary test population (ie, those with high clinical risk and low 
genomic risk who did not receive chemotherapy), the DMFS at 5 years was 94.7% (95% CI, 
92.5% to 96.2%), thus demonstrating a lower boundary of the 95% CI for the rate of DMFS 
of at least 92%. In the 749 women in the intention-to-treat population with a high clinical 
risk and low genomic risk who were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy, the 5-year 
DMFS was 95.9% (95% CI, 94.0% to 97.2%) compared with a 5-year DMFS of 94.4% 
(95% CI, 92.3% to 95.9%) in women who were randomly assigned to not receive 
chemotherapy. The difference between these two groups was 1.5 percentage points, with an 
adjusted hazard ratio for distant metastasis or death with chemotherapy versus no 
chemotherapy of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.50 to 1.21; P = .27). In terms of other end points in this 
group with high clinical risk and low genomic risk who received chemotherapy per the 
intention-to-treat population (and per-protocol population) assessment, the DMFS was 1.5% 
(and 1.9%) higher, respectively; DFS was 2.8% (and 3%) higher, respectively; and OS was 
1.4% (and 1.5%) higher, respectively, compared with no chemotherapy. Given that a subset 
of the patients received a nonstandard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel plus 
capecitabine, and that the follow-up was only 5 years in a predominantly ER/PgR–positive 
cohort who received up to 7 years of endocrine therapy, a small chemotherapy benefit in 
patients with high clinical risk and low genomic risk cannot be excluded.
Patients at low clinical risk but high genomic risk who received chemotherapy had a 5-year 
DMFS of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.9% to 97.6%) compared with 95.0% (95% CI, 91.8% to 
97.0%) among those who did not receive chemotherapy. The adjusted hazard ratio for distant 
metastasis or death with chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy in this group was 1.17 (95% 
CI, 0.59 to 2.28; P = .66). Thus, a chemotherapy benefit is unlikely in women with tumors at 
low clinical risk regardless of genomic subtype.
GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS
Clinical Question
For women with operable invasive breast cancer which other biomarkers have demonstrated 
clinical utility to guide decisions on the need for adjuvant systemic therapy?

 Recommendation 1.1.1 (update of Recommendation 1.7)—If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may 
be used in those with high clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions 
on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a good 
prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit (Type: evidence based; 
Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 1.1.2 (update of Recommendation 1.7)—If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
should not be used in those with low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform 
decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy as women in the low clinical risk 
category had excellent outcomes and did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy even with 
a genomic high-risk cancer (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of 
recommendation: strong).
Clinical interpretation of literature review: The recently published MINDACT2 study 
informs the revision of the 2007 and 2016 ASCO Guidelines.1,6 In the MINDACT study, the 
Mamma-Print assay was able to identify patients with node-negative, ER/PgR–positive, 
HER2-negative breast cancer with high clinical risk (as determined by using a modified 
version of Adjuvant! Online) but low genomic risk who have a favorable outcome when 
treated with endocrine therapy alone: the 5-year rate of DMFS was 93.9% (95% CI, 90.6% 
to 96.1%). This was similar to the DMFS of the women randomly assigned to receive 
chemotherapy: 95.5% (95% CI, 92.5% to 97.3%).2 Additional retrospective studies of 
MammaPrint also support its prognostic value in ER/PgR–positive breast cancer.7–12 
Together, these data indicate that MammaPrint can provide guidance about the prognosis of 
women with ER/PgR–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and a high clinical risk but low 
genomic risk, whose outcome is likely to be favorable even in the absence of chemotherapy. 
When reviewing these data with individual patients with high clinical risk and low genomic 
risk, the clinician should acknowledge that a small benefit from chemotherapy cannot be 
excluded, because the MINDACT study was not designed to detect a significant difference 
in favor of chemotherapy and is underpowered to do so retrospectively. In addition, the 
clinician should consider that MINDACT included an optional random assignment to 
anthracycline-containing versus nonanthracycline-containing regimens, and whether the 
specific chemotherapy assignment affected patient outcome is not yet known. Last, the 
median duration of follow-up was only 5 years at the time of the 2016 publication. 
Additional follow-up and assessment of the clinical outcomes for key prognostic subgroups 
are needed.
Women with node-negative cancers and low clinical risk (as determined by using a modified 
version of Adjuvant! Online) had excellent outcomes regardless of genomic risk, and even 
those patients with high genomic risk did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy. Thus, in 
patients with node-negative cancers and low clinical risk, who will have an excellent 
outcome with endocrine therapy alone, MammaPrint does not provide significant clinical 
utility. Therefore, the MammaPrint assay should not be recommended to patients with low 
clinical risk who will receive endocrine therapy for hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.

 Recommendation 1.2.1 (update of Recommendation 1.7)—If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may 
be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at high clinical risk per MINDACT 
categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to its 
ability to identify a good prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy 
benefit. However, such patients should be informed that a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be 
excluded, particularly in patients with greater than one involved lymph node (Type: evidence 
based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 1.2.2 (update of Recommendation 1.7)—If a patient has ER/
PgR–positive, HER2-negative, node-positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
should not be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at low clinical risk per 
MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy. There are insufficient data on the clinical utility of MammaPrint in this 
specific patient population (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate).
Clinical interpretation of literature review: In the MIND-ACT study, 1,404 patients had 
node-positive breast cancers. Of these, 737 patients were categorized as high clinical risk 
(determined by using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online) but low genomic risk. These 
patients had a favorable outcome when treated with endocrine therapy alone (5-year rate of 
survival without distant metastasis, 95.6% [95% CI, 92.7% to 97.4%) compared with 96.3% 
(95% CI, 93.1% to 98.1%) among such patients randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy. 
On the basis of these results, the Panel felt that the MammaPrint assay may be used in 
patients with positive nodes and high clinical risk to identify those whose outcome is 
predicted to be sufficiently favorable that chemotherapy is unlikely to provide meaningful 
benefit. However, the Panel noted that there were several important limitations to the 
MINDACT data. The first is that the MINDACT study was not designed to detect a 
significant difference in favor of chemotherapy and is underpowered to do so retrospectively. 
Second, a separate outcome assessment of the subgroup of patients with ER/PgR–positive, 
HER2-negative, node-positive cancers was not performed. Third, only a minority (31.1%) of 
these patients with high clinical risk, low genomic risk, and node-positive disease had more 
than one node involved.2 Fourth, no specific information is available for other key 
prognostic characteristics, such as tumor grade, in the node-positive subgroup. Fifth, 
because patients with node-positive disease were only enrolled starting in 2009, their follow-
up is likely shorter than the overall 5-year median follow-up of the entire study population. 
Last, study participants may have received an anthracycline-containing regimen or a 
nonstandard regimen, and the impact of the specific chemotherapy regimen on 
chemotherapy benefit is unknown. Given these limitations, and the concern that patients 
with node-positive disease are generally at greater potential risk for undertreatment, the 
Panel felt that although the MammaPrint assay may be used in patients with one to three 
positive nodes, such patients should be informed that given the available data, a benefit from 
chemotherapy cannot be excluded. In addition, the assay should be used with some caution 
in patients with two to three positive nodes because of the relatively limited number of such 
patients in the MINDACT study.

 The utility of the MammaPrint assay in patients with lymph node–positive disease assessed 
at low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization is not clear, because the number of patients 
was small and was not analyzed separately. It is possible that patients in this category may 
not benefit from chemotherapy use regardless of genomic risk. Given the limited data 
available at this time, the Panel does not recommend the routine use of MammaPrint in 
women with node-positive tumors and low clinical risk.
Recommendation 1.3 (update of Recommendation 1.8)—If a patient has HER2-
positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the MammaPrint assay to guide 
decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Additional studies are required to address the role of 
MammaPrint in patients with this tumor subtype who are also receiving HER2-targeted 
therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: 
moderate).
Clinical interpretation of literature review: Currently, the standard of care for the 
adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive tumors includes both chemotherapy and 
anti-HER2 agents.13 In MINDACT, only 8% of patients (n = 124) had HER2-positive 
tumors with high clinical risk and low genomic risk and were randomly assigned to 
chemotherapy or not. In addition, results of this subgroup were not reported separately.2 
There are, therefore, insufficient data to support the use of MammaPrint in HER2-positive 
breast cancer. It is possible that patients with HER2-positive disease might not need 
chemotherapy if their prognoses are sufficiently favorable. Knauer et al8 performed a 
retrospective, grade-C study to address whether the MammaPrint assay might identify such 
patients. This study involved 168 patients with HER2-positive tumors from a pooled 
database who were classified by the MammaPrint assay as having a good or a poor 
prognosis. Of these, 89 (53%) patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or HER2-
targeted therapy. With a median follow-up of 7.4 years, MammaPrint classified 22% of 
patients with a good prognosis as having a 10-year DMFS of 84% compared with 78% of 
patients with a poor prognosis as having a 10-year DMFS of 55%. The hazard ratios were 
4.5 (95% CI, 1.1 to 18.7; P = .04) and 3.8 (95% CI, 0.9 to 15.8; P = .07) for DMFS and 
breast cancer–specific survival, respectively.8
Thus, the MammaPrint assay appears to have prognostic value in HER2-positive breast 
cancer in a retrospective study.8 However, the Panel does not consider the data sufficiently 
robust or a suggestion of a 10-year distant DFS of 84%8 sufficiently favorable to omit 
chemotherapy from an adjuvant regimen. Given the small HER2-positive subgroup in 
MINDACT and the known substantial benefit women with HER2-positive tumors derive 
from the addition of anti-HER2 agents to adjuvant chemotherapy, the Panel concluded that 
the data do not support use of the MammaPrint assay to decide whether a patient with 
HER2-positive breast cancer may safely forgo adjuvant chemotherapy.
Recommendation 1.4 (update of Recommendation 1.9)—If a patient has ER/PgR–
negative and HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer, the clinician should not use 
the MammaPrint assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: 
informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).

 Clinical interpretation of literature review: Although patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer were included in the prospective MINDACT study, the number of patients with this 
tumor subtype was small (n = 640 [9.6%]). The majority of women with this subtype (n = 
566 [88%]) were classified as high clinical and high genomic risk and were not randomly 
assigned. Therefore, the absolute number of women with triple-negative breast cancer and a 
low genomic risk who did not receive chemotherapy was extremely small, and this subgroup 
was not analyzed separately. Given that no other therapies (eg, endocrine therapy or HER2-
targeted therapy) are recommended for these patients, the Panel felt strongly that until data 
from larger data sets are available, the MammaPrint assay should not be used to guide 
clinical decisions in patients with triple-negative breast cancer.
DISCUSSION
Reduction of overtreatment in patients with early-stage breast cancer is an important goal. 
For several reasons, such a reduction would likely have the greatest societal and individual 
impact in patients with ER/PgR–positive disease. First, this is the most common type of 
breast cancer. Second, outcomes for this subtype generally are favorable for the majority of 
patients. Third, the available data suggest that only a minority of patients with ER/PgR–
positive breast cancer derive significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Fortunately, it 
is clear from a number of biomarker studies that genomic assays that measure the expression 
of a relatively small number of genes in breast tumor tissue can provide important 
prognostic and possibly predictive information that can be used to identify patients with 
early-stage hormone receptor–positive breast cancer for whom chemotherapy is unlikely to 
be associated with a meaningful clinical benefit. Several of these genomic signatures, 
including Oncotype DX, EndoPredict, PAM50 risk of recurrence score, and Breast Cancer 
Index, were noted as having clinical utility for this purpose for patients with node-negative 
ER/PgR–positive cancers in a 2016 ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline.1
In this focused update of the 2016 ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline, we review data from 
the recently reported MINDACT study, which prospectively evaluated another gene 
expression signature, the 70-gene MammaPrint assay. In the MINDACT study, the 
MammaPrint assay was able to identify patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk 
who had a relatively favorable prognosis in the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy. The assay 
had similar functionality in both node-negative and node-positive cancers. On the basis of 
these results, the Panel recommended that the MammaPrint assay could be used to guide 
decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with ER/PgR-positive 
lymph node–negative breast cancer and in select patients with lymph node–positive cancers. 
In both patients with node-positive and with node-negative disease, evidence of clinical 
utility of the MammaPrint assay was only apparent in those determined to be at high clinical 
risk, defined by a modified version of Adjuvant! Online. The Panel therefore did not 
recommend the use of the MammaPrint assay in any patient determined to be at low clinical 
risk. Of note, at the time of publication of this guideline update, the Adjuvant! Online 
website was not functional. As an alternative, clinicians can determine a patient’s clinical 
risk status by using the printed version of the Adjuvant! Online clinical risk criteria found in 
the Data Supplement.

 Now that there are several assays with clinical utility, particularly in patients with node-
negative cancers, how does one select the assay to use for a particular patient? At this time, 
head-to-head comparisons of the different assays are limited. Sestak et al14 did attempt one 
such comparison, but this study was limited by methodologic constraints.15 Clearly, 
additional work is needed to allow clinicians to choose the optimal assay for individual 
patients. Panel members caution that there are no data to suggest that ordering more than 
one assay in an individual patient will be helpful to guide treatment decisions and do not 
recommend the use of more than one test. Clinicians should choose a test that they are most 
comfortable with to guide treatment decisions.
It should be noted that although the Panel concluded that several genomic assays have 
clinical utility in guiding decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, none of 
these assays are perfect. In the available studies, some patients still developed recurrent 
disease despite favorable assay results, and many patients with poor-prognosis genomic 
scores remain disease free even in the absence of chemotherapy. Thus, improvements are 
needed in the assays to additionally reduce overtreatment but minimize risk of recurrence.

Summary of All Recommendations on MammaPrint
2016 Recommendation
Focused Update Recommendation
Recommendation 1.7: If a patient has ER/PgR–
positive, HER2-negative (node-positive or 
node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician 
should not use the 70-gene assay 
(MammaPrint; Agendia, Irvine, CA) to guide 
decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy 
(Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: 
intermediate; Strength of recommendation: 
moderate).
Recommendation 1.1.1: If a patient has ER/PgR–positive, HER2-
negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may 
be used in those with high clinical risk per MINDACT 
categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a good-prognosis 
population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit (Type: 
evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of 
recommendation: strong)
Recommendation 1.1.2: If a patient has ER/PgR–positive, HER2-
negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
should not be used in those with low clinical risk per MINDACT 
categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy, because women in the low clinical risk category had 
excellent outcomes and did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy 
even with a genomic high-risk cancer (Type: evidence based; 
Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 1.2.1: If a patient has ER/PgR–positive, HER2-
negative, node-positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay may 
be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at high 
clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on 
withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to its ability to 
identify a good-prognosis population with potentially limited 
chemotherapy benefit. However, such patients should be informed 
that a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, particularly in 
patients with greater than one involved lymph node (Type: evidence 
based; Evidence quality: igh; Strength of recommendation: 
moderate).
Recommendation 1.2.2: If a patient has ER/PgR–positive, HER2-
negative, node-positive, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay 
should not be used in patients with 1–3 positive nodes and at low 
clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on 
withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. There are insufficient 
data on the clinical utility of MammaPrint in this specific patient 
population (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; 
Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 1.8: If a patient has HER2-
positive breast cancer, the clinician should not 
use the 70-gene assay to guide decisions on 
adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal 
consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 1.3: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer, 
the clinician should not use the MammaPrint assay to guide 
decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Additional studies are 
required to address the role of MammaPrint in patients with this 
tumor subtype who are also receiving HER2-targeted therapy (Type: 
informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 1.9: If a patient has TN 
breast cancer, the clinician should not use the 
70-gene assay to guide decisions on adjuvant 
systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; 
Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of 
recommendation: strong).
No changes.
NOTE. Clinical question: For women with operable invasive breast cancer and with known ER/PgR and HER2 statuses, 
which other biomarkers have demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on the need for adjuvant systemic therapy? All 
recommendations include original recommendations and focused update recommendations. Only recommendations 1.7 and 
1.8 have been changed/modified. Bold type highlights the different patient subgroups.
Abbreviations: ER, estrogen receptor; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; MINDACT, Microarray in Node-
Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy; PgR, progesterone receptor; TN, triple-
negative.

Recommendation
Evidence Rating
1.25
If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, 
the clinician should not use TILs to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic 
therapy.
Type: evidence based
Evidence quality: intermediate
Strength of recommendation: 
strong
1.26
Ki67 labeling index by immunohistochemistry should not be used to guide 
the choice of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Type: evidence based
Evidence quality: intermediate
Strength of recommendation: 
moderate
1.27
If a patient has ER/PgR–positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast 
cancer and has had 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of 
recurrence, the clinician should not use multiparameter gene expression or 
protein assays (Oncotype DX, EndoPredict, PAM50, Breast Cancer Index, or 
IHC-4) to guide decisions on extended endocrine therapy.
Type: evidence based
Evidence quality: intermediate
Strength of recommendation: 
moderate
NOTE. Focused update recommendations are in bold. Clinical question 1 is as follows: For women with operable invasive breast cancer and with 
known ER/PgR and HER2 status, which other biomarkers have demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on the need for adjuvant systemic 
therapy?
