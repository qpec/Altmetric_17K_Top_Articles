Over the past decade, a large body of observational evi-
dence has suggested an association between lower vita-
min D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and multiple acute
and chronic disorders, including cancer, multiple sclero-
sis, depression and respiratory tract infections. This
evidence has fostered the hypothesis that increasing vita-
min D intake may treat and prevent such disorders. Our
objective was to perform a critical analysis of the highest-
level evidence for ten common beliefs regarding vitamin D
for the prevention of falls, fractures and respiratory tract
infections, the reduction of cancer incidence/mortality
and overall mortality, and the prevention or treatment of
depression/mental well-being, rheumatoid arthritis and
multiple sclerosis, as well as maximum dosing and regu-
lar testing. We searched the Cochrane Database of Sys-
tematic Reviews and PubMed (up to August 2014) for
randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews/
meta-analyses based on those studies. All searches were
performed, all evidence reviewed and each section written
by at least two authors. The evidence shows that vitamin
D supplementation provides some benefit in fracture pre-
vention (likely ∼10–15 % relative reduction), particularly
at a dose ≥800 IU and with calcium; a likely benefit in the
rate of falls, though it is less clear whether the number of
fallers changes; and a possible small (∼5 %) relative re-
duction in mortality. Evidence does not support the use of
vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of cancer,
respiratory infections or rheumatoid arthritis. Similarly,
evidence does not support vitamin D supplementation for
the treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthri-
tis or for improving depression/mental well-being. Regu-
lar testing of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is generally not re-
quired, and mega-doses (≥300,000 IU) appear to increase
harms. Much of the evidence is at high risk of bias, with
multiple flaws, including analyses of secondary end-
points, small and underpowered studies, inconsistent
results and numerous other issues. Therefore, enthusi-
asm for a vitamin D panacea should be tempered.

VITAMIN D: EXAMINING THE EVIDENCE FOR TEN
BELIEFS
Over the past decade, more than 1600 studies have been conducted
onvitaminD,andmorethanhalfofthesearecohortorobservational
studies demonstrating an association between deficits in vitamin D
and a litany of acute and chronic disorders—cardiovascular disease,
cancer,diabetes, fractures,depression and respiratorytractinfections,
to name a few.1 These findings have fueled the hypothesis that
vitamin D supplementation—a widely available, low-cost and
mostly harmless intervention—might treat or even prevent these
disorders.
Association, however, is not causation. Observational
studies are not sufficient for proving that low concentrations
of vitamin D (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-OHD]
level) cause disease, or that increasing levels would improve
health.1 Only high-quality randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), and resulting high-quality systematic reviews and
meta-analyses, can determine whether vitamin D supplemen-
tation influences clinical outcomes.
This article will explore ten common beliefs regarding
vitamin D based on the available evidence. Although not
always consistent, the first eight beliefs originate from
observational studies or theories drawing an association
between low 25-OHD level and increased risk or severity of
the following medical concerns: falls,2–4 fractures,5,6 respira-
tory tract infections,7 depression/mental well-being,8 rheuma-
toid arthritis,9,10 multiple sclerosis,5,11–13 overall mortality14,15
and cancer.16 The last two beliefs involve the practical
dilemmas of dosing and routine testing.

 elderly patients in long-term care.2–4 As a result, investigators
have postulated that vitamin D supplementation may reduce
the risk of falling.
Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis
Eight meta-analyses17–24 of vitamin D levels and falls have
been conducted, some with conflicting results. Online Table A
provides an overview of these meta-analyses, including pop-
ulations, outcomes and other methodological issues.
When considering this evidence, the analysis of Bfalls^
rather than Bfallers^ in many RCTs is a key issue. An analysis
of Bfalls^ means that people who fell more than once were
counted more than once in the primary outcome analysis.
These studies generally lacked the statistical power to detect
a significant difference in the number of Bfallers^ (people that
fell one or more times). They relied, therefore, on repeat falls
to obtain the desired number of total falls.
The most current systematic review included a trial sequen-
tial analysis24 (a method to identify the ideal sample size of a
meta-analysis and to potentially reduce false-positive results).
It showed that the effect estimate for vitamin D, with or
without calcium, lay within the futility boundary, i.e., that it
did not alter the relative risk (RR) of falls by 15 % or more.
Using a risk reduction threshold of 10 %, a sensitivity analysis
(a method to assess the impact of key variables on a study’s
conclusions) found that the effect estimate also lay within the
futility boundary.
Bottom Line
Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the number of falls
among the elderly. There is also likely an overall reduction in
the number of Bfallers^ (a less biased outcome), although these
results are less consistent.
BELIEF 2: VITAMIN D REDUCES FRACTURES
Observational Studies
For the most part, more recent observational studies are
consistent with older studies that have established a
relationship between low vitamin D levels and frac-
tures.5 A systematic review and meta-analysis of obser-
vational studies (17 case–control studies, n = 1903 hip
fracture cases and 1953 controls) found 33 % lower
vitamin D levels in cases compared to controls. This
difference was significantly greater in studies with
population-based versus hospital-based controls.6
Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses
There are many systematic reviews of vitamin D supplemen-
tation and fracture prevention. We focus on five large reviews
published within the last 5 years with meta-analyses on frac-
ture prevention (Table 1).
Vitamin D alone did not appear to reduce hip, non-vertebral
or total fractures.25,27,28 When vitamin D was combined with
calcium, the RR reductions were significant for total or non-
vertebral fracture25–29 and hip fractures,25,28 with two results
non-significant for hip fractures.26,29
Two of the systematic reviews26,29 found that higher doses
of vitamin D (>400 IU or a median dose of 800 IU) resulted in
better and statistically significant RR reductions for non-
vertebral and hip fractures. Although co-administration of
calcium is important, it appears that doses <1000 mg are just
as effective as higher doses.26
The most recent of these included a trial sequential analy-
sis25 showing that the effect estimate for vitamin D, with or
without calcium, was less than the futility boundary of 15 %
RR reduction of total fractures. Furthermore, this effect is
unlikely to be meaningfully changed by future studies. How-
ever, uncertainty remains around hip fracture, with more re-
search needed to determine whether vitamin D with calcium
results in a meaningful reduction in hip fractures (≥15 %).
Bottom Line
The best available evidence shows an apparent reduction in
fractures associated with vitamin D when given at moderate
doses (≥800 IU/day) together with calcium at low to moderate
doses (perhaps 500 mg/day). The RR reductions are approx-
imately 10–15 % for non-vertebral/total or hip fractures. At a
15 % baseline risk of any fracture, approximately 45–67
individuals would have to take vitamin D and calcium every
day for 10 years to prevent one fracture.
BELIEF 3: VITAMIN D REDUCES RESPIRATORY TRACT
INFECTIONS
Observational Studies
A large cohort study (n=18,883, age ≥12) suggested that
upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are more common in
people with low vitamin D levels and less common in those
with high vitamin D levels.7
Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses
Three recent systematic reviews/meta-analyses30–32 (Table 2)
have explored vitamin D supplementation and RTIs.
The Bergman 201330 and Charan 201231 reviews conclud-
ed that vitamin D provided a protective effect against RTIs.
The third, Mao 2013,32 found no effect. All three studies have
weaknesses in design and implementation, but the first
two30,31 have the greatest concerns. For example, they includ-
ed RCTs from heterogeneous populations: children under the
age of 3 with pneumonia from an impoverished area of
Afghanistan and healthy adult volunteers from Long Island,
New York. The Mao 2013 review limited some of the clinical
variability by focusing on healthy subjects.32

Allan et al.: Vitamin D: Ten Beliefs
JGIM
 Bergman 201330 and Charan 201231 used odds ratios,
which can exaggerate the relative effectiveness of interven-
tions in common events such as upper RTIs. For example, the
risk reduction from the Laaksi RCT33 (a trial included in each
of the three meta-analyses) was reported as 33 % in Bergman
201330 and 43 % in Charan 2012,31 but only 12 % in Mao
2013.32 Bergman 201330 and Charan 201231 also included the
influenza A-only results (with a 47 % reduction) from one
study34 rather than all flu outcomes (with a 3 % reduction) as
reported by Mao 2013.32 All in all, the Bergman 201330 and
Charan 201231 results are unreliable, particularly for healthy
western populations. The Mao 201332 meta-analysis was not
without concern—for example, 75 % of the weighting was
given to one of the seven trials. Overall, however, Mao 201332
was likely the most reliable analysis, and found that vitamin D
had no effect in reducing RTIs.
In this case, it is probably more helpful to examine the
individual RCTs. A Tools for Practice article (evidence synop-
sis)35 summarized 11 RCTs. The RCT of highest quality and
greatest application to western populations, Murdoch 2012,36
found that vitamin D supplementation over two winters did not
reduce cold or flu illness in 322 New Zealand university and/or
health care workers. The majority of other trials, including a large
trial of infants in Kabul Afghanistan,37 did not find a reduction in
respiratory infections. One trial of Mongolian children with
profound vitamin D deficiency (17.5 nmol/L) found a reduction
of 0.35 respiratory tract infections over 3 months.38
Bottom Line
Vitamin D supplementation does not prevent or reduce RTIs in
western populations. There may be some benefit in children

BELIEF 4: VITAMIN D IMPROVES DEPRESSION AND
MENTAL WELL-BEING
Observational Studies
A systematic review and meta-analysis (n = 31,424)
assessed observational data on the relationship between
vitamin D and depression. The systematic review includ-
ed one case–control study which found that patients
with depression had lower vitamin D levels than did
healthy controls. The mean difference between the
groups was 17.5 nmol/L. Three cohort studies also in-
cluded in the review explored the association between
vitamin D levels and the risk of developing depression.
Results showed a significantly increased risk of depres-
sion in patients with low vitamin D levels (hazard ratio
2.21, 95 % CI 1.40–3.40).8
RCTs
Many of the RCTs on mental health and vitamin D are
at high risk of bias, with poor randomization, lack of
blinding, no description of patient characteristics, no
intention-to-treat analysis and large loss to follow-up.
Online Table B includes 8 RCTs that used vitamin D
supplementation to improve mental well-being or de-
pression.39–46 Depression was not a requirement for
inclusion in these studies. Based on low baseline de-
pression scores, limited improvements in depression
scales would be possible. None of the RCTs that includ-
ed primarily patients without depression demonstrated a
meaningful change in depression or mental well-being.
Table 3 includes three RCTs of patients with depres-
sion or depressive symptoms. Mozaffair-Khosravi 201347
showed a statistically and clinically significant improve-
ment in symptoms, but had several methodological
flaws, including unclear randomization and allocation
concealment, and no blinding or intention-to-treat anal-
ysis. Khoraminya 201249 also demonstrated a statistical-
ly and clinically significant improvement in symptoms.
This trial was small and of short duration, and had
methodological weaknesses. Yalamanchili 201248 found
that vitamin D had no statistically significant effect on
depression. Although this was a secondary analysis,
there was no indication of a positive effect.
Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses
Three systematic reviews of RCTs on vitamin D supple-
mentation and depression scores have recently been
completed.50–52 The conflicting results are shown in

quality evidence and cannot be recommended.

 participants were divided into groups according to their vita-
min D intake, those with the highest intake had a lower risk of
developing RA than those with the lowest intake (RR 0.67,
95 % CI 0.44–1.00). In subgroups of vitamin D intake, both
higher dietary (RR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.46–1.14) and supplemen-
tal vitamin D (RR 0.66, 95 % CI 0.43–1.00) were associated
with lower risk. This study suggests a possible relationship
between low vitamin D intake and increased risk of RA.9
However, a larger cohort study (n=186,389 women) failed
to demonstrate a relationship between vitamin D intake and
the incidence of RA or systemic lupus erythematosus.10
RCTs
Prevention. Participants enrolled in the Women’s Health
Initiative trial (n=36,282, mean age 62) were randomized to
a daily dose of 1000 mg calcium carbonate plus 400 IU
vitamin D or placebo for an average of 5.1 years. In
intention-to-treat analyses, there were no differences in RA
incidence (RR 1.04, 95 % CI 0.76–1.41).61
Treatment. We identified three small RCTs62–64 in patients
with RA (Table 5), all with substantial issues with quality. One
study64 from Sweden, published over 40 years ago, reported
that 31 % more patients on high-dose vitamin D (100,000 IU/
day) had clinical improvements at 1 year. The authors, how-
ever, provided no explanation regarding the specific subjective
and objective outcomes measured. The Iranian study found no
effect on Disease Activity Score or any other clinical out-
come.62 The Indian study found no difference in time to pain
relief (their primary outcome), but reported that patients in the
vitamin D arm had greater improvement in pain at 3 months on
a visual analogue scale (VAS; median 50 vs. 30 % control
group, p=0.006).63 The authors mistakenly tried to convert
this continuous score difference to a number needed to treat.
Overall, given the inconsistent results and high risk of bias,
there is no reliable evidence that vitamin D supplementation
improves outcomes in RA.
Bottom Line
Vitamin D supplementation lacks consistent and reliable evi-
dence in preventing or treating RA.
BELIEF 6: VITAMIN D CAN TREAT MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
(MS)
Observational Studies
Observational studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent
association between vitamin D levels and MS.5 However, the
association between increasing latitude and increasing preva-
lence of MS inevitably led some to hypothesize that lower
exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and thereby lower vitamin D,
at high latitudes contributes to or causes MS.11 Furthermore,
some observational studies have drawn associations between
higher disease activity among MS patients and lower vitamin
D levels.12,13
Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses
We could not identify any high-level evidence of vitamin D for
the prevention of MS. Three systematic reviews/meta-
analyses65–67 have examined the effect of vitamin D on MS
(Table 6). The systematic reviews themselves have some
methodological concerns. They included up to five of six
possible trials. The six trials were small and had several
methodological weaknesses. Among these, one found a posi-
tive change in MRI lesions and another found one positive
clinical outcome out of seven. The one systematic review66

Bottom Line
Although the present evidence base is poor, vitamin D sup-
plementation does not appear to provide a clinical benefit in
the treatment of MS.
BELIEF 7: VITAMIN D REDUCES MORTALITY
Observational Studies
Multiple observational studies have found a positive associa-
tion between low vitamin D levels and an increase in all-cause
mortality.14,15
Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses
We reviewed six of the systematic reviews/meta-
analyses16,25,69–72 that examined the effect of vitamin D on
mortality (Table 7). Although these are large studies, mortality
was a secondary outcome for almost all included trials. Awide
range of patients (community-dwelling or institutionalized,
with or without chronic medical conditions or previous
fractures) and doses of vitamin D2 or D3 (with or without
calcium) were included. Overall, the relative reduction in
mortality ranged from 4 to 11 %. Some of the upper confi-
dence intervals include no effect. This is not uncommon
among meta-analyses, and an interpretation of benefit should
not rely entirely on statistical significance testing with confi-
dence intervals.73 Based on these meta-analyses, the relative
change in mortality may be a 2 % increase to a 13 % reduction,
but is most likely around a 5 % reduction.
Trial sequential analysis25 suggests that optimum sample
size of 130,005 participants has not been reached, indicating
that the estimate could change with future studies. A number
of the meta-analyses16,69 also found that while vitamin D3 was
effective, vitamin D2 was ineffective. The results regarding the
necessity of calcium co-administration are conflicting.
Although low 25-OHD levels have been associated with
increased mortality in observational studies, it should be noted
that emerging observational evidence indicates that high 25-
OHD levels (>120 nmol/L) are also associated with increased
mortality.74
Bottom Line
The effects of vitamin D on mortality are not consistently
statistically significant. If real, the relative reductions in mor-
tality are likely quite small (∼5 %).
BELIEF 8: VITAMIN D REDUCES CANCER INCIDENCE
AND CANCER MORTALITY
Observational Studies
There is relatively consistent evidence from observational
studies of an association between lower vitamin D levels and
an elevated risk of cancer. Pooled data from observational
studies show a correlation between populations in the bottom
versus top one third of circulating vitamin D levels and a 14 %
RR increase of 1.14 (95 % CI 1.01–1.29; 5003 events) in death
from cancer.16

 RCTs
A frequently cited RCT (n= 1179 white women over age
55)75 demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin D plus
calcium resulted in RR of developing cancer of 0.402
(P=0.01) compared to placebo. The trial, however, had many
limitations: industry-funded, secondary analysis of fracture
trial, unclear allocation concealment, small number of events
reported, efficacy of blinding not described, and outcome was
patient reporting of new onset cancers.
Systematic Reviews/Meta-Analyses
Early systematic reviews27,76,77 included limited numbers of
RCTs and did not perform meta-analyses. Generally, these
reviews included the RCT75 mentioned above and non-
statistically significant RCTs to conclude that possible clini-
cally important effects could not be ruled out.
Two meta-analyses (7 trials, n = 48,167; 18 trials, n =
50,623)25,78 have been performed more recently. Both reported
that vitamin D supplementation did not alter the incidence of
cancer: RR 0.99 (95 % CI 0.93–1.05),25 and RR 1.00 (95 % CI
0.94–1.06).78 Trial sequential analysis conducted in both meta-
analyses found that the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
the incidence of cancer lay within the futility boundary (15 % RR
reduction), and no further studies were required.25,78
The larger meta-analysis78 also assessed the effect of vita-
min D supplementation on cancer mortality and found a
statistically significant benefit, RR 0.88 (95 % CI 0.78–

 0.98). This analysis included four trials with a total of 44,492
participants, and evidence was deemed to be of low quality.
Trial sequential analysis indicated that this finding could be
due to random errors and that further data were required.
Bottom Line
Vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the incidence of
cancer. The impact of vitamin D supplementation on cancer
mortality is less clear and has been assessed only by low-
quality evidence.
BELIEF 9: VITAMIN D DOSE—MORE IS BETTER
RCTs
Two large RCTs (Table 8) provide concerning evidence that
higher doses of vitamin D could increase the risk of falls and
fracture.79,80 Given the present enthusiasm for vitamin D
supplementation and the pervasive belief that more is better,
these trials serve as a good reminder. Even in the two clinical
areas of best evidence for vitamin D supplementation (falls
and fracture prevention), massive doses can increase the very
outcomes we are trying to prevent. Additionally, there is some
evidence (albeit observational) that higher 25-OHD levels
(>120 nmol/L) are associated with increased mortality.74
Bottom Line
High-dose vitamin D has been shown to increase the risk of
falls and fractures. Single high-dose (≥300,000 IU) supple-
mentation should not be recommended.
BELIEF 10: VITAMIN D (25-OHD) LEVELS
SHOULD BE TESTED ROUTINELY
Routine 25-OHD testing is not recommended, for several
reasons. Vitamin D assays can vary by as much as 10–20 %,
even when repeating the test in the same person at the same
time.5 Therefore, changes in levels may not be discernable in
individuals at doses of 800 IU/day, as this dose on average
changes the serum vitamin D about as much as the variance in
assay.81
Enrollment in many vitamin D supplementation trials was
not based on 25-OHD levels, and treatment of patients without
screening 25-OHD level was found to be beneficial.29,72,82
Finally, routine screening/testing of 25-OHD levels is an
onerous and costly exercise. The cost of a 25-OHD assay is
$61.32,81 two to three times the cost of a year’s worth of
vitamin D.
Despite recommendations to the contrary, testing 25-OHD
levels has become widespread in recent years. One conse-
quence has been confusion regarding the 25-OHD level indic-
ative of deficiency. The Bcut-points^ for deficiency and suffi-
ciency used by laboratories are neither standardized nor based
on rigorous scientific studies. The number of people with
vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency may be overestimated, be-
cause many labs use higher cut-points than are indicated by the
evidence.5
Based on a systematic review of studies on health outcomes
associated with vitamin D, the Institute of Medicine now
recommends:
&
Deficiency: <30 nmol/L places a person Bat risk relative
to bone health^; 30–50 nmol/L Bplaces some, but not all,
persons at risk for inadequacy.^
&
Sufficiency (adequate): ≥50 nmol/L meets the needs of
97.5 % of the population
The Institute of Medicine also states that Blevels >75 nmol/
L are not consistently associated with increased benefit.^5
Bottom Line
Vitamin D supplementation in the general adult population is
safe, and supplementation without testing is reasonable. Test-
ing may be appropriate when clinically indicated (e.g.,

 parathyroid disease), and a variety of resources are available to
direct testing.83 When testing is performed, ≥50 nmol/L indi-
cates vitamin D sufficiency.
CONCLUSION
Severe vitamin D deficiency causes important health problems
(e.g., rickets). Additionally, lower 25-OHD levels have some-
times been associated with a long list of medical conditions
and negative outcomes. However, association is not causation,
and high-quality, high-level evidence for supplementation is
frequently lacking. Vitamin D may prove to be a good surro-
gate for general well-being.
At the present time, evidence supports vitamin D supple-
mentation to help prevent fractures (particularly if given with
calcium), and possibly to prevent falls and slightly reduce
mortality (particularly in older patients [>70 years of age]).
No other effects are proven. For many other conditions, the
evidence for vitamin D supplementation is plagued by the use
of small, poor-quality trials. Lastly, testing of 25-OHD levels
in the general population is not necessary, and very high doses
should be avoided.
