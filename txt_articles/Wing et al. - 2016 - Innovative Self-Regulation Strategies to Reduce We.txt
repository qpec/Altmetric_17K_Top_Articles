IMPORTANCE Weight gain occurs commonly in young adults and has adverse effects on health.
OBJECTIVE To compare 2 self-regulation interventions vs control in reducing weight gain in
young adults over a mean follow-up of 3 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial in 2 academic settings of 599
participants aged 18 to 35 years with body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) of 21.0 to 30.0, recruited via mailings and emails from
August 2010 to February 2012. Data were analyzed from January 2015 to January 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to control, self-regulation plus small changes,
or self-regulation plus large changes. Both interventions focused on frequent self-weighing to
cue behavior changes. “Small changes”taught participants to reduce intake and increase
activity, both by approximately 100 calories per day. “Large changes”focused on losing 2.3 to
4.5 kg initially to buffer against expected weight gain.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in weight from baseline over mean follow-up of 3
years. Secondary outcomes included proportion gaining at least 0.45 kg from baseline,
proportion developing obesity (BMI, �30.0), and weight change baseline to 2 years.
RESULTS Among the 599 participants (22% men; 27% minority; mean [SD] age, 27.7 [4.4]
years; mean [SD] BMI, 25.4 [2.6]), mean (SE) weight changes over a mean follow-up of 3
years were 0.26 (0.22), −0.56 (0.22), and −2.37 (0.22) kg in the control, small-changes, and
large-changes groups, respectively (P < .001). Differences among all 3 groups were significant
(large changes vs control, P < .001; small changes vs control, P = .02; large changes vs small
changes, P < .001). On secondary outcomes, both interventions significantly reduced
incidence of obesity relative to control (mean [SE], 8.6% [2.0%], 7.9% [2.0%], and 16.9%
[2.7%] in the large-changes, small-changes, and control groups, respectively; P = .02 for large
changes vs control and P = .002 for small changes vs control); a smaller percentage of
participants in the large-changes group gained 0.45 kg or more (mean [SE], 23.6% [2.8%],
32.5% [3.8%], and 40.8% [4.4%], respectively; P < .001 vs control and P = .02 vs small
changes) and weight change from baseline to 2 years was greater in control than in small or
large changes (mean [SE], 0.54 [0.33], −0.77 [0.33], and −1.50 [0.34] kg, respectively;
P = .02 vs small changes and P < .001 vs large changes).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Self-regulation with large or small changes both reduced
weight gain in young adults over 3 years relative to control, but the large-changes
intervention was more effective.

eight gain occurs commonly throughout adult-
hood and is associated with many adverse health
outcomes.1-4 Young adults are the age group that is
gaining weight the fastest5-7; moreover, weight gain in those

caloutcomessuchascancerriskandmortalitythanweightgain
at later ages.8,9 Developing effective approaches to reduce
weight gain in young adults is thus an important public health
priority.
Previous efforts to prevent weight gain during adult-
hood,particularlyinyoungadults,havehadlimitedsuccess.1,10
Although positive effects are often observed initially, few stud-
ies have observed participants for 2 to 3 years11-13 and long-
term differences between intervention and control are rarely
significant. Moreover, many of these programs have been
implemented in college courses, limiting generalizability.14
The present study examined 2 novel interventions for
weight gain prevention compared with a control condition on
the magnitude of weight change across a mean planned
follow-up of 3 years. Both interventions were based on a self-
regulation model shown previously to be effective in prevent-
ing weight regain15; both emphasized frequent self-weighing
and changes in eating and activity to prevent weight gain. One
approach focused on making daily small changes in eating and
activity to prevent weight gain. This “small-changes” ap-
proach has received a great deal of attention in the popular
media and is supported by theoretical articles16 and small
studies17-20 suggestingthatbothdecreasingintakeandincreas-
ing activity by approximately 100 kcal per day should be suffi-
cient to prevent weight gain. The other approach emphasized
largerinitialchangesinbehaviortoproduceweightlossasabuf-
fer against anticipated weight gains. Evidence favoring the
“large-changes” approach comes from the Women’
s Healthy
Lifestyle Project,21 which showed that producing initial weight
losses of 2.3 to 6.8 kg, even though they were followed by some
weight regain, was effective in reducing weight gain in meno-
pausalwomen.Thepresentstudytestedwhethereitherorboth
of these approaches reduced weight gain in young adults.
Methods
Study Design
The Study of Novel Approaches to Weight Gain Prevention
(SNAP) is a 3-armed randomized clinical trial, with equal al-
location, comparing self-regulation with small daily behav-
ior changes (small changes), self-regulation with large peri-
odicbehaviorchanges(largechanges),andaminimaltreatment
control condition (study protocol available in Supplement 1).22
The primary outcome was the mean weight gain over a mean
follow-up of 3 years. Secondary outcomes were the propor-
tion of participants gaining 0.45 kg or more (chosen to repre-
sent a stringent criterion of weight gain over baseline) and the
incidence of obesity (body mass index [BMI, calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared],
≥30.0) over the 3 years. We focused on outcomes over
follow-up (rather than at 1 specific time point) to capture the
cumulative effect of the interventions on body weight. We also
examined weight change specifically at 2 years because this
is the last time point reached by all participants in SNAP and
the outcome in several other current trials on weight gain pre-
vention in young adults.23 The study was funded by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and involved 2 clini-
cal sites (Providence, Rhode Island, and Chapel Hill, North
Carolina) and a coordinating center (Winston-Salem, North
Carolina)andwasapprovedbyeachinstitutionalreviewboard.

Study Participants
SNAPtargetedanenrollmentof600participants(25%menand
25% racial/ethnic minorities), aged 18 to 35 years, with a BMI
of 21.0 to 30.9. Both overweight and normal-weight individu-
als were included because young adults in both weight groups
(especially those who are overweight) are at greater risk of
weight gain than older individuals.5 We included individuals
withaBMIof21.0becauseepidemiologicalstudieshaveshown
that higher BMI in young adults, even within the normal range,
is associated with elevated mortality risk.9 In addition, the ear-
lier the age that the threshold of BMI of 25.0 or greater is ex-
ceeded, the greater the mortality risk. A weight loss of 2.3 kg
(as encouraged in 1 of the interventions) was considered safe
in individuals with a BMI of 21.0 or more because their BMI
would remain in the normal range. Other eligibility criteria, de-
scribedpreviously,22focusedonabilitytoparticipateinthepro-
gram (eg, Internet access, English speaking), safety (no his-
tory of eating disorders, ability to walk for activity), and
completion of screening and baseline assessment visits. Par-
ticipants were recruited primarily by mass mailings (38%) and
emails (23%), using text that sought individuals who were
concerned about gaining weight over time.24
Randomization
Randomization assignment used variable block lengths, was
stratified by clinical site, sex, and ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white/other), and was implemented through a web-based data
management system (Figure 1).

large or daily small behavior changes reduce weight gain in young
adults over a mean follow-up of 3 years?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, self-regulation with large
or small changes both reduced weight gain in young adults over 3
years relative to control, but the large-changes intervention was
more effective.

regulation, and an overview of both the small- and large-
changes approaches to potentially prevent weight gain.
The small- and large-changes interventions both began
with 10 face-to-face group meetings over 4 months. This treat-
ment duration was selected to be sufficient to enable the 2.3-
or 4.5-kg weight loss, but easily disseminated. Subsequently,
the interventions were delivered primarily online. Each year,
participantswereinvitedtojoin24-weekonlinerefreshercam-
paigns reinforcing the behaviors taught during the initial pro-
gram. All participants received identical quarterly newslet-
ters and personalized feedback reports on their assessment
data, including the control group.
The interventions were both framed in a self-regulation
model that forms the basis for several self-control theories25-28
and has been applied to diabetes mellitus29 and obesity15 and
was used in a pilot study for this trial.30 Self-regulation is based
on a negative feedback loop, in which there is a goal, error de-
tector, and controlling responses. In SNAP, the goal was to not
exceed baseline weight, the error detector was the scale and
daily self-weighing, and the controlling responses involved

received monthly email feedback on their weight, which was
based on a color-coded system15,22 and either reinforced their
success, encouraged problem solving, or recommended addi-
tional strategies to help reverse weight gain. Participants who
gained above baseline were invited to contact a study inter-
ventionist for problem-solving assistance via email, tele-
phone, or face to face, but very few requested this assistance.
The specific recommendations related to diet and activ-
ity differed for the small-changes vs large-changes groups.

changes (approximately 100 kcal/d) in both diet (eg, select
lower-calorie coffee drinks, reduce portion sizes) and physi-
cal activity (eg, park farther from store when shopping, use
stairs). Participants were given pedometers and instructed to
add 2000 steps per day (equivalent to 1.7 km) above baseline.
If participants in small changes experienced weight gains
above baseline, they were encouraged to make additional
daily small changes.
The large-changes intervention focused on losing weight
(2.3 kg if normal weight; 4.5 kg if overweight) during the ini-
tial 4-month program to create a buffer against subsequent
weight gain. To achieve this, participants were prescribed a
calorie goal based on a 500- to 1000-kcal deficit from base-
line to use during the initial 8 weeks. They were also encour-
aged to gradually increase moderate-intensity physical activ-
ity to a goal of 250 minutes/week, the level recommended for
weight loss maintenance,31 and to maintain this over time. If
weight exceeded baseline, they were to return to their calorie
goal and confirm that they were achieving the activity goal.
Study Assessment
All participants were scheduled to complete assessments at
baseline, month 4, year 1, and year 2. Depending on when par-
ticipants were randomized, some were also scheduled to reach
year 3 (n = 437) and year 4 (n = 106) before prespecified data
closeout on December 31, 2014. All assessments were com-
pleted by masked staff members, who were centrally trained
and certified. Participants received a $50 honorarium for each
follow-up assessment.
Weight was measured on a calibrated scale in light cloth-
ing, without shoes; height was assessed with a wall-mounted
stadiometer. Two measures were taken and averaged. Cellu-
lar network–connected scales (“smart” scales) were sent to
those who had moved or could not attend a clinic visit. These
nonprotocol smart scale weights constituted 4.7% of all weight
data, with comparable numbers in the 3 groups, and were used
only in sensitivity analyses.
Statistical Approach

across a mean planned follow-up of 3 years would differ among
the3arms,wasassessedbyfittingamixed-effectslinearmodel

ment with clinic site as the only prespecified covariate. Esti-
matedmeandifferencesforeachpairwisecomparisonfromlin-
ear contrasts were assessed with Wald statistics; Bonferroni

analyses, except those during or within 6 months after preg-
nancies. To assess heterogeneity in intervention responses, 3
subgroup comparisons were prespecified: baseline BMI (<25.0
vs ≥25.0), age (<25 vs ≥25 years), and sex.

Results
Study Participants
A total of 599 adults were enrolled (292 in Providence, Rhode
Island, and 307 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina) between August
2010 and February 2012 and randomly assigned to 1 of the 3
groups. Participants in the 3 groups were similar at baseline
(Table 1). The study sample included 22% men and 27% from
minority groups. Participants were a mean (SD) of 28.2 (4.4)
years of age and 72% were older than 25 years; mean (SD) BMI
was 25.4 (2.6), and approximately 50% were of normal weight.
The majority (63%) were employed full time. Figure 1 presents
the CONSORT diagram showing retention at each of the
follow-upassessments.Retentiondidnotdifferamonggroups.
Intervention Delivery
Participants in the large- and small-changes groups attended
a mean of 87.4% and 86.0% of the 10 intervention sessions, re-
spectively; 100% of the control group participants attended
their1session.Interventionfidelity,determinedbymaskedrat-
ers evaluating a randomly selected sample of 20% of recorded
group sessions, was excellent, with 100% accuracy for distin-
guishing large-changes from small-changes sessions and for
presentation of the appropriate behavioral content. Self-
weighing, a cornerstone of self-regulation interventions, was
increased in the 2 interventions. Whereas at baseline, 11% to
13% of each group reported daily self-weighing, at 4 months,
daily self-weighing was reported by 75%, 72%, and 30% of
large-changes, small-changes, and control participants,
respectively (P < .001).
Useoftheprescribedbehavioralstrategiesalsodifferedsig-
nificantly (P < .001) by randomization group; for example, at
4 months, 64% of large-changes participants (and 10% and 11%
in the small-changes and control groups) reported reducing
calories by 500 to 1000 kcal/d at least “much of the time” and
75% of small-changes participants (and 28% and 24% in the
large-changes and control groups) reported making small
changes to diet every day. Weight losses during the first 4
months also differed significantly, with mean (SE) weight
changes of −0.64 (0.22), −1.48 (0.23), and −3.60 (0.22) kg for
the control, small-changes, and large-changes groups, respec-
tively (all pairwise comparisons P < .05).

ethnicity subgroups were evident.
Discussion
Previousstudieshavefailedtoidentifyinterventionswithlong-
term effects on weight gain in young adults, who are at high
risk for weight gain.10,12,13 In our study, we found that self-
regulation interventions involving small or large changes were
both effective in reducing the mean weight gain (and produc-
ing small weight loss) relative to control over a mean
follow-up of 3 years. In addition, the large-changes interven-
tion was more effective than the small-changes intervention.
These results were confirmed in several sensitivity analyses.
Thelarge-changesinterventionalsosuccessfullydecreasedthe
proportion of participants who experienced weight gains of
0.45 kg or more over the follow-up, and both interventions re-
ducedtheincidenceofobesityduringfollow-upbyalmost50%
relative to control, representing a clinically significant reduc-
tion in risk of developing obesity.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to test 2 different
behavior change approaches to weight gain prevention and the
first large study of the small-changes approach.16 Although the
theoretical basis of small changes has recently been ques-
tioned,33 we found that the small-changes approach had
long-term efficacy in preventing weight gain relative to con-
trol. The large-changes approach was more effective over the
follow-up because of the significant weight losses produced
at 4 months. This weight loss was followed by gradual regain,

and by 2 years, large-changes participants had regained 2.1 kg
(58% of their initial weight loss). In contrast, participants in
the small-changes group lost less weight initially (a mean of
1.48 kg at 4 months) but had a more stable trajectory, gaining
only 0.7 kg between month 4 and year 2. At 2 years, weight
changeinboththesmall-changesandlarge-changesgroupsdif-
fered significantly from the control group but not from each
other. Because the difference between the large- and small-
change approaches diminished over time, further follow-up is
needed. In addition, it would be important to determine
whether success at weight gain prevention would be maxi-
mized by periodically repeating the initial 4-month program
to reinstate the buffer and/or reengage participants in the
small-changes approach.
These interventions could easily be disseminated through
community organizations and public health approaches using
electronic communication or mobile devices. The format used
in SNAP, with initial face-to-face group meetings followed by
Internet-delivered maintenance approaches, may have im-
proved outcomes because face-to-face approaches appear su-
periortoInternet-deliveredweight-lossinterventions35andin-
terventions involving exclusively electronic communication
have not been effective in preventing weight gain.36 Like-
wise, weight loss and maintenance programs that have in-
cludedface-to-faceortelephonecounseling15,37,38appearmore
effective than Internet-only programs. Further research to de-
termine how best to combine face-to-face and electronic ap-
proaches and which individuals respond better to the large-
vs small-change approach is needed.
Observational studies of weight gain suggest that young
adults typically gain approximately 0.6 to 0.8 kg per year,4-7
whereas our control group gained a mean of 0.54 kg at 2 years.
The smaller weight gains in our control group may reflect the
fact that SNAP was a weight gain prevention trial (vs an
observational study) and the control group received some,
albeit modest, intervention.
Strengths of this trial include the large sample size, recruit-
mentbeyondcollegecampuses,objectivelymeasuredoutcome
by masked personnel, and the successful implementation and

Conclusions
The findings from this trial suggest that self-regulation ap-
proaches that include frequent self-weighing have clinically
significant beneficial effects on reducing weight gain and risk
of obesity in young adults and indicate that a large-changes
approachmaybeparticularlyeffectiveinreducingmeanweight
gain over 3 years of follow-up. Further follow-up is needed to
determine whether effects are maintained over time and
whether the large- or small-changes approach produces the
best long-term outcomes. Because both small- and large-
change interventions reduced weight gain relative to control,
it may be important to consider individual preferences in se-
lecting which approach to recommend. Given the success of
both approaches in reducing the incidence of obesity in the
present sample of young adults, dissemination of these
approaches could help to combat the epidemic of obesity.
