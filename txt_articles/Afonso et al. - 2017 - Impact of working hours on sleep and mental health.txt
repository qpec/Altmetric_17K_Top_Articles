Background The number of hours people are required to work has a pervasive influence on both physical and 
mental health. Excessive working hours can also negatively affect sleep quality. 
The impact at work of 
mental health problems can have serious consequences for individuals’ as well as for organizations’ 
productivity.
Aims 
To evaluate differences in sleep quality and anxiety and depression symptoms between longer work-
ing hours group (LWHG) and regular working hours group (RWHG). To examine factors influenc-
ing weekly working hours, sleep quality and anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Methods 
Participants were divided into two groups, RWHG and LWHG, based on working hours, with a cut-
off of 48 h per week. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety 
and depression symptoms and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure the quality 
and patterns of sleep.
Results 
The response rate was 23%. Among the 429 study participants, those in the LWHG group (n = 256, 
53%) had significantly more depressive and anxiety symptoms and worse sleep quality than those in 
RWHG (n = 223, 47%). Working time was significantly positively correlated with higher corporate 
position and HADS scores. Moreover, HADS scores were positively correlated with PSQI scores 
and negatively correlated with age.
Conclusions This study suggests that longer working hours are associated with poorer mental health status and 
increasing levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. 
There was a positive correlation between these 
symptoms and sleep disturbances.
Key words 
 Anxiety; depression; long working hours; sleep quality.
Introduction
Long working hours are commonplace worldwide and 
have been one of the most important topics in occupa-
tional health since the late 19th century. The European 
Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC) estab-
lished minimum general safety and health requirements 
for the organization of certain aspects of working time 
in the European Union’s 28 member states, including 
for the health professions. The directive states in its pre-
amble that ‘the improvement of workers’ safety, hygiene 
and health at work is an objective which should not 
be subordinated to purely economic consideration’. 
Furthermore, it stipulates that workers should have a 
maximum weekly working time of 48 h, including over-
time. Over recent decades, significant progress has been 
made worldwide in establishing statutory limits on work-
ing hours. As a result, the majority of countries now have 
statutory limits <48 h, and around half have a 40-h limit 
in place [1]. Despite this, ~22% of workers worldwide are 
still working >48 h per week [2].
The number of hours people are required to work has 
a pervasive influence not only on physical health but also 
on mental health. Excessive weekly working time has 
negative effects on workers’ health, including increasing 
the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
infection, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, sleep disturb-
ance, anxiety and depression [1,3–6]. Additionally, 
excessive working time has been implicated in several 
sudden deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases (e.g. 
stroke, acute cardiac failure, myocardial infarction 
and aortic aneurysm rupture) in middle-aged workers.

In Japan, such deaths are called karoshi, meaning ‘death 
from overwork’ [7]. In Japan, the number of workers 
suffering from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular 
disease and mental disorders due to work has increased 
3-fold in the last decade [3].
Mental health problems in the workplace have seri-
ous consequences not only for the individual, but also 
for the productivity of the organization. In Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, 
mental ill-health is responsible for between one-third 
and half of all long-term sickness and disability in the 
working age population. Data show that many people 
with common mental health problems struggle at work. 
For example, 69% of people with moderate mental 
health problems report having difficulty with job per-
formance, compared with 26% of those without men-
tal health problems [8]. Sleep disturbance is associated 
with substantial impairment in an individual’s quality of 
life. Compared with good sleepers, people with persist-
ent sleep disturbance are more prone to accidents, have 
higher rates of work absenteeism, diminished job per-
formance, decreased quality of life and increased health 
care use [9]. Several studies have revealed that working 
overtime is related to short or disturbed sleep and can 
correlate with reduced sleep quality in a dose-response 
manner [10–12].
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 
longer working hours on sleep quality, anxiety and 
depressive symptoms in white-collar workers.
Methods
We sent an e-mail invitation to participate in this survey, 
with a unique hyperlink to a questionnaire, to all alumni 
of the Portuguese AESE-Business School. Participation 
in the study was voluntary and the questionnaire was 
confidential and anonymous. The study received ethical 
approval from the institutional review board. We defined 
long working hours as >48 working hours per week. 
According to this criterion, participants were divided into 
a regular working hours group (RWHG) and a longer 
working hours group (LWHG). We designed a question-
naire to collect demographic and work characteristics 
data and used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) to elicit anxiety and depressive symptoms [13]. 
HADS is a self-reported 14-item questionnaire com-
posed of two 7-item subscales, one measuring anxiety 
and one depression, which are scored separately. Each 
item is answered on a four-point (0–3) Likert scale, so 
possible scores range from 0 to 21 for both anxiety and 
depression, with higher scores indicating a higher level of 
depression or anxiety. We assessed the quality and pat-
terns of sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI) [14]. This self-reported questionnaire rates sleep 
quality and patterns during the previous month and 
evaluates seven components of sleep: subjective quality, 
latency, duration, usual efficiency, sleep disturbances, 
medication use and daytime dysfunction. A score >5 is 
suggestive of a sleep disorder.
Standard descriptive summary statistics were used 
to characterize the full sample and the two groups. 
Associations between variables were evaluated using 
the χ2 test (categorical variables) and the independent 
t-test with unequal variances and estimated degrees of 
freedom (continuous variables). Regression analysis was 
performed on average work hours per week, PQSI and 
HADS scores, social and demographic variables, work-
ing habits and sleep patterns. The backward selection 
method using the Akaike Information Criterion was 
used for model selection. All analyses were performed 
using commercially available and open source statistical 
software (IBM SPSS 22.0, R 3.2.4). In all regressional 
analysis, the symmetry of residuals and large sample size 
guaranteed estimates’ quality. A P value <0.05 was con-
sidered significant.
Results
Surveys were sent to 2059 alumni and 479 completed sur-
veys (23%) were returned and validated. The responders 
were divided into RWHG (n = 223, 47%) and LWHG 
(256, 53%). The average weekly working hours were 38 
(SD 11.8) in RWHG and 55 (SD 6.5) in LWHG. In addi-
tion, a larger proportion of the LWHG reported working 
>5 days per week (32 versus 7%). Characteristics of the 
study participants are shown in Table 1. In both groups, 
participants were mostly married men with children. 
The 
propensity to work long hours was associated with level 
in the corporate hierarchy. Interestingly, LWHG mem-
bers had higher level corporate positions than RWHG 
subjects. This means that those with higher level corpo-
rate positions were statistically significantly more likely 
to work more weekly hours than participants with lower 
positions. Moreover, LWHG subjects were more likely to 
take work home (75%) than those in the RWHG (55%; 
P < 0.001). We found no significant differences in shift 
work between the two groups.
An independence test to rule out any confounding 
between sex and job level, using the χ2 statistic, yielded 
P >0.99. A similar test was performed for sex and hav-
ing children, with P = 0.83. Both of these factors can be 
considered independent of sex.
Data on PSQI and HADS scores are reported in 
Table 2. The RWHG had significantly more sleeping 
time (mean 6.7 h, SD 0.8) than the LWHG (mean 
6.4 h, SD 0.9; P < 0.001), so sleeping hours were signif-
icantly negatively associated with weekly working hours 
(P < 0.05). As shown in Table 2, PSQI scores were not 
significantly higher for those in LWHG. Nonetheless, 
using a cut-off score of 5 on the PSQI scale, a signifi-
cantly higher number of subjects in LWHG (66%) 
reported more sleep disorders than in the RWHG

(54%). In addition, there were significantly higher total 
HADS scores and HADS subscale scores for anxiety 
and depression in LWHG members compared with 
those in RWHG. Although HADS scores do not provide 
definitive diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disor-
ders, these results show that LWHG members reported

significantly more anxiety and depression symptoms 
than those in RWHG.
Results of the regression analysis are shown in 
T
ables 3–5.
As shown in Table 3, a significant positive relationship 
was found between working hours per week and work in 
some professional areas, having a higher level of corpor-
ate responsibility, taking work home and the number of 
working days per week. Additionally, a negative correla-
tion was found between working hours per week and the 
number of vacation days annually.
The results from the regression analysis for PSQI 
scores (Table 4) suggested a positive correlation between 
PSQI scores and both HADS-depression and HADS-
anxiety subscale scores.
There were positive correlations between the total 
HADS score and both PSQI score and taking work home. 
In addition, there was a negative correlation between the 
HADS total score and age.
Discussion
Our study found significantly higher anxiety and depres-
sion symptom scores in respondents reporting long 
working hours compared with those reporting regular 
hours. 
These findings are similar to those of several previ-
ous studies [7,15–17]. Moreover, there was a significant 
negative correlation between total HADS score and age. 
This relationship can probably be explained by burnout, 
since age has been found to be related to burnout. For 
instance, in younger employees, the level of burnout is 
higher than in those over 30 or 40 years old [18], sug-
gesting that burnout appears early in a person’s career 
and may be a risk factor for developing depression [19]. 
However, the apparent relationship between burnout 
and age is inconsistent and further studies are needed to 
clarify this [20].
There is general agreement that long hours of work 
adversely affect sleep [21]. In our study, there were more 
participants reporting sleep disturbance in the LWHG 
than the RWHG, which is compatible with previous 
observations [12,22]. Additionally, our results showed 
a significant inverse relationship between working time 
and sleep duration. Inadequate recovery because of sleep 
deprivation is considered an important component of the 
pathway from long work hours to increased fatigue and 
risk of health problems [23,24]. Moreover, shift work is

associated with sleep disturbance [1,21,25], which may 
bias the results. However, there were only seven shift 
workers in the RWHG (3%) and 12 in the LWHG (5%), 
a non-significant difference unlikely to have biased the 
results. Sleep problems may be associated with psychiat-
ric conditions. Thus, there is growing experimental evi-
dence that the relationship between psychiatric disorders 
and sleep is complex and includes bi-directional causa-
tion [26]. The positive correlation between PSQI scores 
and HADS-anxiety and HADS-depression scores seem 
to support this relationship. In other words, our results 
showed an association between poor sleep quality and 
anxiety and depression symptoms.
A sex-specific difference was also found between 
the two groups, with more men in the LWHG (73%) 
than the RWHG (62%). Similar results were obtained 
in a large survey regarding working conditions in the 
European Union [27]. Women tend to work shorter 
hours than men, presumably because they still retain pri-
mary responsibility for the majority of housework and 
childcare. Not surprisingly, LWHG members had sig-
nificantly less vacation time, worked more days per week 
and took more work home than RWHG members.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, it was a cross-
sectional study, whereas longitudinal research would be 
necessary to clarify the long-term effects of long working 
hours on mental health and sleep quality. Secondly, long 
working hours may in part affect mental health through 
factors not measured in our study, such as work–fam-
ily conflicts [28], burnout [18], a prolonged increase in 
cortisol levels [28,29] and alcohol abuse [30]. Finally, 
the participants in the study were alumni from a busi-
ness school, so the results may not be applicable to other 
workers. In particular, the participants were white-collar 
workers and with a higher level of education than the 
general population.
Almost a century has passed since the 1919 adop-
tion of the first international labour standard on work-
ing hours, which established the principle of the 8-h 
working day and 48-h working week. Despite progress in 
legislation, ~22% of workers worldwide still work >48 h 
per week [2]. Surprisingly, 53% of workers in our study 
reported working >48 h per week, suggesting that the 
European Working Time Directive has been ineffective, 
at least at higher corporate levels.
Work is important for economic self-sufficiency and 
a meaningful way of living. However, as demonstrated 
in this study, long working hours can also be associ-
ated with problems such as an increased risk of sleep 
disturbance and symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
Our findings suggest that we still need to advocate 
shorter working hours in order to preserve health and 
well-being.
Key points
 
• In this study of Portuguese business school alumni 
long weekly working hours were associated with 
poorer mental health status, as evidenced by 
higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms.
 
• Long weekly working hours were also associ-
ated with reduced sleep time and increased sleep 
disturbance.
 
• These results confirm the importance of main-
taining regular weekly working hours and avoid-
ing excessive overtime work in reducing the risk of 
anxiety, depression and sleep disorders.
