Abstract: Racial disparities in how 
pain is treated in the emergency 
department (ED) for toothache have 
not been reported. Due to increasing 
reliance on EDs for dental care, the 
authors investigated whether race/
ethnicity and insurance type are 
associated with treatment for toothache 
pain. The authors conducted a 
nationally representative cross-sectional 
study of ED toothache visits by adults 
(19 to 64 y old), using the 2008–2010 
National Hospital Ambulatory Medical 
Care Survey. Multinomial regression 
models accounted for the complex 
survey design. Outcomes were pain 
medicines received: none, nonopioid 
only, or opioids. After adjusting for 
sociodemographic factors, black 
patients had 1.99 greater odds (P < 
0.005) than white patients of receiving 
only a nonopioid pain medicine for 
toothache. Visits made by patients on 
Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured, or 
“other” insurance status had greater 
odds than the privately insured of 
receiving only a nonopioid pain 
medicine rather than an opioid (odds 
ratios, respectively: 4.8, P < 0.001; 2.1, 
P ≤ 0.001; 2.3, P < 0.01; and 4.1,  
P < 0.001). Blacks are less likely than 
whites to receive opioids in the ED for 
a toothache, even with similar levels 
of pain. Nonprivately insured patients 
have lower odds than the privately 
insured to receive opioids for toothache 
pain. A better understanding of the 
etiology of these disparities could lead 
to directed interventions.
Knowledge Transfer Statement: 
This study presents findings novel 
to the body of pain and oral health 
care literature. Because there is an 
increasing reliance on the emergency 
department to address dental pain, 
disparities in how toothache pain 
is treated will be of great interest to 
a growing number of Americans, 
clinicians, and policy makers.

Introduction
Painful conditions account for 
the majority of chief complaints for 
emergency department (ED) visits. 
Among the painful conditions cared 
for in the ED, toothache is increasingly 
common, particularly among individuals 
from low-income and minority groups 
(Lee et al. 2012), who more often lack 
access to professional dental care. From 
2001 to 2008, ED dental visits increased 
among black patients by 86% and by 
42% in uninsured populations (Lee et al. 
2012). Most EDs are not staffed by 
dentists, who can provide definitive care 
for toothaches, which often limits ED 
management to palliation with antibiotics 
and analgesics and a recommendation 
for definitive care at a dentist’s office 
(Lewis et al. 2003; Cohen et al. 2008; 
Cohen et al. 2011).
Treating pain in the ED is complicated 
by the increasing numbers of patients 
presenting for pain-related complaints 
and the practice patterns that result in the 
increasing numbers of pain prescriptions. 
ED opioid prescriptions in the United 
States increased from 1:5 visits in 1997 
to 1:3 visits in 2009 (Jeffrey Kao et al. 
2014). In prescribing opioid analgesics, 
clinicians balance the risks of opioid 
abuse and misuse against the need to

provide appropriate treatment of acute 
severe pain. The subjective nature of 
reported pain is an ongoing challenge 
for clinicians. This is particularly true for 
ED physicians, who generally know their 
patients less well than do primary care 
providers. Pain management for dental 
problems may pose further difficulties for 
ED providers, who typically lack formal 
dental training. Differentiating between 
true dental pain and drug-seeking 
behavior then becomes a matter of trust 
between the provider and the patient and 
thus vulnerable to implicit biases within 
a health care system and/or individual 
providers. Furthermore, a toothache may 
represent an “emergency” for the patient 
experiencing it, but ED physicians may 
not consider a toothache to be a medical 
emergency if no acute intervention is 
required. Such a disconnect between 
clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions about 
whether toothaches require emergency 
care further increases the likelihood for 
systems or provider-level biases in treating 
dental pain for vulnerable populations, 
such as the uninsured, publically insured, 
or racial/ethnic minority groups.
Racial/ethnic disparities in ED pain 
management for medical problems (Todd 
1996, 2001; Sobel and Todd 2002; Mills 
et al. 2011) and surgical problems (Goyal 
et al. 2015; Shah et al. 2015) have been 
described, yet no such differences in 
ED treatment for dental pain have been 
found (Okunseri et al. 2014). Given the 
rise in the ED toothache visit rates in 
populations who tend to have limited 
access to preventive dental care (racial/
ethnic minorities, Medicaid patients, 
and uninsured patients; Lee et al. 2012), 
in conjunction with the limitations of 
treating dental problems in the ED, we 
assessed if there were differences in ED 
pain treatment for toothache among these 
various patient groups. We hypothesized 
that patient-level (race/ethnicity, insurance 
status) characteristics are risk factors for 
how toothache pain is treated in the ED.
Materials and Methods
This study is a cross-sectional 
analysis of data from the National 
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care 
Survey (NHAMCS) from 2008 to 2010. 
The NHAMCS is an annual national 
probability-sample survey of US hospital 
EDs conducted by the National Center 
for Health Statistics. The sample design 
is composed of 3 stages for the ED 
component: 1) geographic primary 
sampling units, 2) hospitals within primary 
sampling units, and 3) patient visits within 
emergency service areas. Sampled EDs 
are located in noninstitutional general and 
short-stay hospitals exclusive of federal, 
military, and Veterans Affairs hospitals in 
the 50 US states and District of Columbia. 
Within an ED, visits are systematically 
selected during a randomly assigned 4-wk 
reporting period. Field representatives of 
the US Census Bureau induct hospitals 
into the NHAMCS. Hospital staff or Census 
Bureau field representatives complete 
a patient record form for each sampled 
visit based on information obtained from 
the medical record. Sampled data are 
extrapolated to population-based estimates 
according to assigned patient visit weights, 
which account for probability of visit 
selection, nonresponse, and ratio of 
sampled hospitals to all hospitals in the 
United States (NHAMCS and National 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 
2009). Up to 3 reason-for-visit codes and 
3 discharge diagnoses are possible for 
each visit. Up to 8 medications delivered 
in the ED, prescribed, or both are 
listed. Diagnoses are coded through the 
International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM; CDC 2011). Details related 
to data collection and survey reports 
are published by the CDC (2012). For 
characterization of ED toothache visits 
in the recent past, we combined 3 y of 
NHAMCS data (2008 to 2010) to improve 
reliability of our estimates—a strategy 
recommended by the National Center 
for Health Statistics. Weighted estimates 
based on <30 unweighted records or 
with relative standard errors ≥30% are 
annotated in the results.
Use of these de-identified data was 
exempt from review by the institutional 
review board of the University of 
Washington. The reporting of this study 
conforms to the STROBE (Strengthening 
the Reporting of Observational Studies 
in Epidemiology) guidelines for 
observational studies (von Elm et al. 
2008).
We selected adult (19 to 64 y) ED 
visits for toothache from 2008 to 2010 
in the NHAMCS because prior work 
has demonstrated that ED visit rates for 
children and the elderly have remained 
constant in this period and, relative to 
other age groups, are quite low (Lee  
et al. 2012).
Visits were identified via the 
NHAMCS “reason for visit” variable for 
toothache (code 1500.1). We chose 
“reason for visit” codes over discharge 
diagnosis ICD-9-CM codes because 
we were particularly interested in the 
phenomenon of patients presenting to 
the ED for a perceived dental problem 
rather than visits precipitated by a 
nondental chief complaint that were 
associated with a dental ICD-9-CM code.
The outcomes reflected 3 potential 
options to manage pain during or after 
an ED visit: 1) no receipt or prescription 
of any pain medicine, 2) receipt or 
prescription of an opioid (reference 
group), or 3) receipt or prescription 
of only a nonopioid pain medicine 
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent or 
acetaminophen).
Our exposures of interest were race/
ethnic group and insurance type. 
We used the NHAMCS race/ethnicity 
variables that were imputed to account 
for missing values: non-Hispanic white 
(“white”), non-Hispanic black (“black”), 
and Hispanic. Race and ethnicity were 
assessed as part of the hypothesis 
that underserved populations receive 
differential treatment in the ED for dental 
problems as compared with whites. 
Insurance status categories were created 
with the “PAYTYPE” variable. NHAMCS 
assigned the primary expected source of 
payment to the “PAYTYPE” variable per a 
hierarchical ranking (in decreasing order: 
Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, 
worker’s compensation, self-payment, 
and no charge). Beginning in 2008, 
dually eligible Medicaid and Medicare 
patients have Medicare classified as their 
primary expected payment source. Using 
this hierarchy, we classified insurance 
 JDR Clinical & Translational Research 
October 2016
228
status as private insurance, Medicare, 
Medicaid, uninsured, and “other.” Our 
uninsured category combined “self-
pay,” “no charge,” and “charity.” The 
“other” category included visits with 
insurance status left as a blank and 
unable to be determined; it also included 
worker’s compensation. The worker’s 
compensation insurance group included 
too few visits to be categorized as its 
own subcategory, and inclusion in the 
“other” category did not change the 
association with the outcomes.
Covariates evaluated for inclusion in 
our multivariable models were based 
on a priori identified factors (based 
on literature and clinical plausibility) 
that might influence ED treatment for 
a toothache and be associated with 
race/ethnicity and/or insurance status: 
age, receipt/prescription of antibiotics, 
sex, pain score, geographic region and 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of the 
hospital, the percentage of residents in 
the patient’s zip code who are living in 
poverty, procedure in the ED, and the 
urban-rural classification of the patient’s 
zip code. All variables studied were 
categorized as presented in Table 1.
This is the third in a series of studies 
that examine trends in ED care for a 
toothache. ED toothache visit patterns 
differ by age. We found that patients 
in the 18- to 44-y age group were 
disproportionately represented in ED 
toothache visits as compared with 
other age groups (Lee et al. 2012). 
Further analysis revealed that within the 
population of patients who visited the ED 
for a toothache, patients in the 20- to 29-y 
age category were distinct from all other 
age groups in terms of their utilization of 
the ED (Lewis et al. 2015). We therefore 
categorized age as follows: 19 to 29, 30 
to 39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 64. We did not 
include adults >64 y old, because there 
were only 12 ED toothache visits in this 
age group. Pain scores were based on a 
pain scale (0 to 10) and categorized into 
mild (0 to 3), moderate (4 to 6), or severe 
(7 to 10), as established by prior work 
(Serlin et al. 1995). Pain scores that were 
not reported or that were recorded as 
unknown were categorized as “unknown.” 
Receipt or prescription for an antibiotic 
was coded yes/no. Broadly, MSAs have a 
core, concentrated large population with 
neighboring communities that are highly 
socially and economically integrated with 
the core area. We categorized hospitals 
according to their location within an 
MSA or non-MSA. Patient-level economic 
indicators are not available through the 
NHAMCS; as a proxy, we relied on a 
variable that categorized the percentage 
of the population living in poverty within 
the patient’s zip code. The NHAMCS 
has categorized the percentage of the 
population living below the poverty 
line within a residential zip code as 
follows: <5%, 5% to 9.9%, 10% to 19.9%, 
and ≥20%). Based on raw numbers, the 
variable was recategorized as follows: 
<10%, 10% to 19.9%, and ≥20%. This 
recategorization did not alter findings 
when compared with analysis with the 
NHAMCS-categorized variable. The 
National Center for Health Statistics 
developed an urban-rural classification 
scheme to be used in studies of health 
disparities by residential zip code. 
Residential categories are population 
based and defined as follows: large 
central metropolitan (central counties 
of ≥1 million), large fringe metropolitan 
(fringe counties of ≥1 million), medium 
metropolitan (counties of 250,000 
to 999,999), small metropolitan 
(counties of 50,000 to 249,999), and 
nonmetropolitan (counties within and 
not within micropolitan statistical areas). 
Because of small numbers of sampled 
visits, small metropolitan counties were 
combined with medium metropolitan 
counties. Receipt of a procedure in the 
ED was categorized per the clinical 
relevance to the management of a 
toothache (related, unrelated, none). 
Related procedures included intravenous 
fluids and/or incision and drainage. 
Unrelated procedures included all 
other listed procedures, such as cast, 
pelvic examination, cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, and endotracheal intubation.
Descriptive statistics (counts and 
percentages) were calculated for 
all variables of interest stratified on 
toothache treatment (opioid, only 
nonopioid, or no pain medicine). 
Unadjusted and adjusted multinomial 
logistic regression models were used to 
estimate odds ratios, 95% confidence 
intervals, and P values of associations 
between sociodemographic factors of 
interest and toothache pain treatment. 
We generated separate models for race/
ethnicity and insurance status. We 
eliminated potential confounders that 
did not change estimates to a meaningful 
degree (generally <10%). Each potential 
confounder was assessed separately and 
in combination with other confounders. 
We then generated a single model 
that included both predictors and all 
confounders. Testing for interaction 
between race/ethnicity and insurance 
status resulted in the Stata output 
“convergence not achieved,” which 
may indicate an inadequate sample 
size in individual cells to conduct this 
analysis. To account for the complex 
sampling design, we used the survey 
capabilities within Stata, which factors 
in the clustered nature of the sample 
in generating population estimates and 
accurate relative standard errors. We 
assessed the extent to which variables 
had counts ≤30 or relative standard 
errors ≥30% and noted these estimates 
(McCaig and Burt 2012).
Results
Between 2008 and 2010, there were 
an estimated 389,676,926 ED visits 
(sampled visit, n = 104,012). There were 
an estimated 5.1 million ED toothache 
visits in this period, with 4.7 million visits 
(sampled visit, n = 1,211) among 19- to 
64-y-olds. This averages to 1.6 million 
toothache visits to the ED per year 
(Table 1). The majority of ED toothache 
visits resulted in receipt/prescription 
of an opioid (59%). Among visits that 
did not result in any pain prescribed or 
dispensed medicine, 57% had a pain 
score ≥7 (severe pain), while 73% of 
visits that resulted in an opioid had pain 
scores in the severe range.
In adjusted analysis, black patients had 
nearly 2 times greater odds than white 
patients of receiving only nonopioid

pain medications rather than an opioid 
(Table 2). Furthermore, there was a 
statistically significant effect of insurance 
on the adjusted odds of receiving only 
a nonopioid for a toothache (Table 2). 
Relative to private insurance, visits by 
patients with another insurance status 
had greater odds of receiving only a 
nonopioid as follows: Medicare (odds 
ratio = 4.8), Medicaid (odds ratio = 2.1), 
uninsured (odds ratio = 2.3), and “other” 
(odds ratio = 4.1).
Discussion
Reliance on the ED to address dental 
pain is increasing (Lee et al. 2012). 
Disparities in ED pain management 
for toothache have implications for 
researchers, policy analysts, and a 
growing number of Americans. Racial 
disparities in ED pain management have 
been well described for acute medical 
and surgical problems (Todd 1996, 
2001; Sobel and Todd 2002; Johnston 
and Bao 2011; Mills et al. 2011; Goyal 
et al. 2015; Shah et al. 2015), as have 
racial disparities in access to dental care 
(Okunseri et al. 2008). We are the first, 
however, to report a disparity by race/
ethnicity and insurance type in the ED 
treatment for dental pain.
Our findings are in opposition to a 
recent study by Okunseri et al. (2014) 
that examined ED visits for nontraumatic 
dental condition. No differences were 
found in adjusted analysis for race/
ethnicity or medical insurance type and 
the outcome of prescription of pain 
medications. The differences in findings 
between our study and Okunseri’s (2014) 
may be due to several variations in 
methodology. First, we selected a more 
narrowly defined patient population. 
We selected ED visits by the variable 
for “reason for visit” rather than the 
ICD-9-CM codes charted in a patient’s 
discharge diagnosis. In relying on the 
“reason for visit” variable, we selected 
ED visits made specifically to address a 
toothache, as declared by the patient. 
Okunseri’s (2014) patient population 
included patients whose reason for visit 
included both dental and nondental 
reasons. Second, the variables included

in the multinomial logistic regression 
models by Okunseri (2014) differed from 
ours in terms of specific variables as 
well as the categorization of variables. 
For example, we included independent 
variables for the percentage of residents 
in the patient’s zip code who are 
living in poverty and the urban-rural 
classification of the patient’s zip code 
based on a priori identified factors that 
might influence ED treatment for a 
toothache and be associated with race/
ethnicity and insurance status. Unlike 
Okunseri (2014), we included ED 
toothache visits made only by 19- to 
64-y-olds because these accounted for 
the majority of such visits, thus allowing 
greater precision in our estimates. Third, 
time trends in our findings may reflect 
secular trends, such as the most recent 
economic recession. It is possible that 
increased unemployment rates in the 
period that we studied influenced the 
population presenting to the ED for 
dental care, relative to that studied by 
Okunseri (2014). Finally, our study was 
able to utilize the NHAMCS-imputed 
race/ethnicity variable, which was not 
available for the entire period in the 
Okunseri study (2014), thus necessitating 
its own imputation analysis for missing 
race/ethnicity values.
We are the first to establish racial/
ethnic disparities in treatment for 
dental pain. The literature on ED pain 
management for other conditions is 
conflicted regarding the role of race/
ethnicity on opioid prescribing. Although 
earlier work documented racial/ethnic 
disparities in type of ED pain treatment 
(Todd 1996, 2001; Sobel and Todd 
2002), more recent studies indicate 
that these differences have decreased 
for complaints such as headache and 
backache (Quazi et al. 2008), where 
diagnosis is more dependent on patient 
report, much like the diagnosis of 
toothache, rather than diagnostic tests. 
Back pain is similar to toothache in that 
its presentation in the ED is common 
(Friedman et al. 2010) and often 
perceived as nonurgent. Our findings, 
however, indicate that racial/ethnic 
disparities in ED pain treatment may be 
ongoing despite reports of diminished 
disparities in pain treatment for other 
conditions. Specifically, we found that 
black patients were less likely than white 
patients to receive opioids for their pain.
Racial/ethnic disparities in pain 
management may in part result from 
implicit biases within providers or health 
care systems. Bias may be influenced by 
trust within a relationship. Mutual trust is 
an important aspect of clinicians’ chronic 
pain management and prescription of 
opioid analgesics (Merrill et al. 2002). 
The phenomenon of provider-patient 
trust can be influenced by a patient’s 
race/ethnicity (Moskowitz et al. 2011). 
Bias may also reflect personal attitudes. 
For example, providers’ attitudes and 
perceptions of race and racism have 
been implicated as factors in disparities 
in pain management for sickle cell 
patients (Nelson and Hackman 2013). 
There may be bias in how different racial 
groups are perceived by clinicians to 
experience pain. For example, Trawalter 
et al. (2012) demonstrated that providers 
perceived black patients to have less 
pain than white patients. Furthermore, 
Trawalter et al. provided evidence that 
biases in pain perception may be more 
influenced by social rather than racial 
status. The latter findings are consistent 
with our results in which we document 
disparities not only by race but also by 
insurance status—an important proxy for 
socioeconomic status.
It is unclear if our findings that both 
race/ethnicity and insurance status 
are associated with disparities in ED 
toothache pain treatment are the 
manifestation of 2 different trends or 
perhaps reflective of the strong influence 
of a patient’s socioeconomic status on 
health care outcomes, which could not 
be adequately distinguished from the 
category of race/ethnicity. Our analysis 
adjusted for race/ethnicity and insurance 
status in examining each effect on 
medication outcome. However, it is 
also possible that race/ethnicity and 
insurance status may be indirect markers 
for other uncontrolled socioeconomic

factors that influence treatment of 
toothache. Our models adjusted for 
variables that indirectly define a patient’s 
income status (percentage poverty by 
residential zip code) but may not fully 
account for how socioeconomic factors 
affect the relationship between race/
ethnicity and insurance status on pain 
management.
To date, there are few studies that 
demonstrate differences in ED pain 
management by insurance status (Shah 
et al. 2015). However, other aspects of 
ED care differ by insurance type (waiting 
time to see a physician; Johnston and 
Bao 2011). There are several potential 
explanations for differences in pain 
management by insurance status—
differences among payers in their 
coverage for pain medication, perceived 
differences in patient accountability 
(privately insured patients are more 
likely to return for outpatient follow-up 
care), or implicit biases based on 
socioeconomic status. Our finding of 
decreased odds of receiving nonopioids 
for toothaches in the western region of 
the United States complements previous 
findings on the geographic variation of 
opioid prescriptions. Specifically, opioid 
prescription rates are disproportionately 
high in western areas of the United 
States compared with the Northeast 
(McDonald et al. 2012). It is not clear 
whether our findings indicate that 
patients in western states are being 
overtreated for dental pain or if patients 
in other areas of the country are being 
undertreated. Factors that influence 
variation in pain management should 
be explored in future studies (e.g., 
fears of overprescribing, state medical 
board variation in regulating opioid 
prescriptions, programs to monitor ED 
opioid prescriptions).
Several study limitations are related 
to the available data in the NHAMCS. 
We were unable to account for several 
factors that may influence disparities 
in utilization and outcomes of care. 
For example, the NHAMCS does not 
contain data at the individual level 
regarding disease severity, such as 
medical and health services utilization 
history. Individuals with a history of 
repeat ED visits or those perceived as 
drug seeking might be less likely to 
receive opioids. However, it is not clear 
if the racial/ethnic distribution of these 
“drug seeking” individuals would be 
disproportionately represented in one 
particular racial/ethnic or insurance-
type category, and the impact of bias 
could be bidirectional. The publically 
available NHAMCS data do not identify 
visits by state; therefore, we cannot 
account for state-specific adult Medicaid 
dental policies, provider availability, or 
variation in opioid prescription patterns. 
However, regardless of whether there 
are state-, hospital-, or provider-level 
prescribing differences, blacks are 
less likely than whites to get opioids, 
and future investigations need to fully 
examine factors based on multilevel 
analysis. Moreover, our results are 
consistent with recent studies that also 
found racial/ethnic disparities in ED 
pain treatment utilizing NHAMCS data 
(Goyal et al. 2015; Shah et al. 2015). 
Future work might rely on qualitative 
methodologies to clarify the role of the 
aforementioned factors in disparities 
in ED pain management. Additionally, 
the NHAMCS data are constructed so 
that the unit of analysis is a visit rather 
than an individual identifiable patient. 
We are therefore unable to distinguish 
whether visits represent unique patients 
or a smaller number of patients who 
are repeat visitors to the ED. A large 
proportion of visits representing a small 
number of black or nonprivately insured 
individuals might result in a positive 
bias and an overestimated association 
between outcomes and race/ethnicity 
and/or insurance type. However, each 
ED contributes only 4 wk of consecutive 
data to the NHAMCS data, which 
limits the number of repeat visits. Our 
study does not explain why black or 
nonprivately insured patients were less 
likely to receive opioids, which is in 
part due to the limitations of available 
data. Future work in elucidating the role 
of social factors in disparities in care 
may rely on qualitative methodologies. 
Further studies may elucidate the degree 
to which systemic racial/ethnic bias or 
other factors influence pain control for 
toothache.
This is the first work to show 
differences in ED pain management 
for a dental problem by race/ethnicity. 
We show that blacks as compared 
with whites and those who are not 
privately insured are more apt to receive 
nonopioids rather than opioids for 
toothache pain. This extends prior work 
indicating that ED toothache visits are 
significantly increasing among black, 
uninsured, and Medicaid patients (Lee 
et al. 2012). Future studies should 
investigate medical provider perspectives 
on dental pain management to identify 
factors that are driving this disparity.
