The 21-gene Recurrence Score assay is validated to predict recurrence risk and chemotherapy benefit in hormone-receptor-positive
(HR+) invasive breast cancer. To determine prospective breast-cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) outcomes by baseline Recurrence
Score results and clinical covariates, the National Cancer Institute collaborated with Genomic Health and 14 population-based
registries in the the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program to electronically supplement cancer surveillance
data with Recurrence Score results. The prespecified primary analysis cohort was 40–84 years of age, and had node-negative, HR+,
HER2-negative, nonmetastatic disease diagnosed between January 2004 and December 2011 in the entire SEER population, and
Recurrence Score results (N = 38,568). Unadjusted 5-year BCSM were 0.4% (n = 21,023; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3–0.6%), 1.4%
(n = 14,494; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7%), and 4.4% (n = 3,051; 95% CI, 3.4–5.6%) for Recurrence Score o18, 18–30, and ⩾ 31 groups,
respectively (Po0.001). In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, tumor size, grade, and race, the Recurrence Score result predicted
BCSM (Po0.001). Among patients with node-positive disease (micrometastases and up to three positive nodes; N = 4,691), 5-year
BCSM (unadjusted) was 1.0% (n = 2,694; 95% CI, 0.5–2.0%), 2.3% (n = 1,669; 95% CI, 1.3–4.1%), and 14.3% (n = 328; 95% CI, 8.4–
23.8%) for Recurrence Score o18, 18–30, ⩾ 31 groups, respectively (Po0.001). Five-year BCSM by Recurrence Score group are
reported for important patient subgroups, including age, race, tumor size, grade, and socioeconomic status. This SEER study
represents the largest report of prospective BCSM outcomes based on Recurrence Score results for patients with HR+, HER2-
negative, node-negative, or node-positive breast cancer, including subgroups often under-represented in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION
Despite unprecedented advances in breast cancer diagnosis and
treatment, health-care quality and outcomes remain variable, with
significant disparities associated with many factors, such as age
and race, and the location of care.1–4 Leading organizations,
including the Institute of Medicine,5 the American Society of
Clinical Oncology,6,7 and the European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer,8 have emphasized the need for new
research models to more precisely identify what works in clinical
practice and encourage appropriate value-based cancer treatment.
In recent years, technologies such as multigene expression
analysis, next-generation sequencing, and liquid biopsy, have
raised the potential to define appropriate patient subgroups for
more precise cost-effective care and improved health outcomes.
The 21-gene assay has been clinically validated in ‘prospective–
retrospective’ studies on archival tumor tissue to provide both
prognostic and predictive information for chemotherapy benefit
in early stage, hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), node-negative, or
node-positive breast cancer.9–12 Recently, the first results from the
Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx), a
multi-center, prospectively conducted trial of 10,253 women
with early-stage breast cancer, were reported.13 For the 1,626
trial participants with Recurrence Score results o11 (TAILORx low-
range stratum) who received hormonal therapy alone without
chemotherapy, 5-year freedom from distant recurrence was 99.3%
(95%
confidence
interval
(CI),
98.7–99.6%).
These
findings
demonstrate that patients with low Recurrence Score results can
be effectively spared from adjuvant chemotherapy. Results from
two other recent studies provide additional evidence of excellent
outcomes for patients treated with hormonal therapy alone based
on low Recurrence Score results. In the Clalit Health Services study,
patients with node-negative or micrometastatic disease and
Recurrence Score results
o18 (standard low-range group),
nearly all of whom (98%) were treated with hormonal therapy
without chemotherapy, had o1% risk of distant recurrence and
0% risk of breast-cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) at 5 years.14 In

 the prospective PlanB trial, patients with 0–3 positive lymph nodes
and Recurrence Score results ⩽ 11, who were treated with
hormonal therapy alone, had 3-year relapse-free survival exceed-
ing 98%.15 As we await results of the TAILORx mid-range stratum
(Recurrence Score results 11–25), it would be desirable to have
additional evidence of the utility of the 21-gene assay in patients
with Recurrence Score result o18, the standard cutoff used in
contemporary
clinical
practice
for
selection
of
hormone
therapy alone.
Initiated in 1973, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute is an
authoritative
population-based
cancer
surveillance
program,
covering ~ 30% of the US population and capturing over 98% of
incident cancer cases in these covered regions.16 SEER Program
registries collect standardized patient information on demo-
graphics, primary tumor site, and characteristics (histology, grade,
stage, and so on), first course of treatment, and survival (survival
time, vital status, and cause of death), as mandated by respective
state laws. SEER has required the collection of breast cancer
multigene test results for cases diagnosed with breast cancer in
2010 and after. To supplement registry data with more complete
and accurate multigene test results, we electronically linked
Recurrence Score results from the Genomic Health Clinical
Laboratory database with each of the SEER registries.
In this first report, we determined the relationship between
Recurrence Score results and prospective BCSM for the large
population in the SEER program with node-negative and node-
positive breast cancer, including subgroups (e.g., racial minorities,
the elderly, and the young) that are often under-represented in
clinical trials.
RESULTS
Population
A total of 379,103 patients were newly diagnosed with primary
invasive breast cancer between 2004 and 2011 in the participating
SEER registries (Table 1; Supplementary Figure S1). These patients
resided in 12 individual SEER states: California (3 registries, 41%),
New Jersey (12%), Georgia (11%), Washington (13 Puget Sound
region counties only, 6%), Connecticut (5%), Kentucky (5%),
Louisiana (5%), Michigan (metropolitan Detroit counties only,
5%), Iowa (4%), Hawaii (2%), New Mexico (2%), and Utah (2%).
Of 379,103 patients, 45,287 (12%) had HR+, nonmetastatic
disease and Recurrence Score results, including 40,134 with node-
negative disease, 4,691 with micrometastates or up to three
positive nodes (N+(mic,1–3)), and 462 with four or more positive
nodes or unknown/missing nodal status. Nearly all patients
(99.5%) who had 21-gene assay testing had fewer than four
positive lymph nodes. Only 165 of 16,202 patients with 4–9

 positive nodes and 41 of 7,320 patients with 10 or more positive
nodes had testing. Demographic characteristics of tested and
untested patients of all ages diagnosed between 2004 and 2011
with node-negative or node-positive (N+(mic,1–3)) are shown in
Table 1. Median follow-up of patients with node-negative disease
was longer than that of patients with node-positive (N+(mic,1–3))
disease (39 months versus 30 months), reflecting later adoption of
the test for use in patients with node-positive disease.
A total
of
38,568
patients
(10%)
were
eligible
for
the
prespecified primary analysis (had HR+, HER2-negative, node-
negative, nonmetastatic disease; had Recurrence Score results;
and were 40–84 years of age; Supplementary Figure S1). Median
age of the prespecified primary analysis cohort was 57 years;
99.4% were female; 84% were white, 29% and 54% had tumors of
histologic grade 1 and grade 2, respectively; 25% and 53% had
tumors of ⩽ 1 cm and 41 to 2 cm in size, respectively. Median
follow-up for the primary analysis cohort was 39 months; 8,239
(21%) patients had 45 years of follow-up.
Recurrence Score result and breast-cancer-specific mortality
(Node-negative)
Of 38,568 patients in the prespecified primary analysis cohort,
21,023 (55%) had Recurrence Score results o18, 14,494 (38%) had
results 18–30, and 3,051 (8%) had results ⩾ 31. BCSM was
significantly associated with Recurrence Score results (Po0.001)
(Figure 1). Unadjusted 5-year estimates of BCSM were 0.4% (95%
CI, 0.3–0.6%), 1.4% (95% CI, 1.1–1.7%), and 4.4% (95% CI, 3.4–5.6%)
for patients Recurrence Score results o18, 18–30, and ⩾ 31,
respectively. Chemotherapy use was reported as ‘yes’ in 7%, 34%,
and 69% of patients in the Recurrence Score o18, 18–30, and
⩾ 31 groups, respectively (the remaining patients in each group
were reported in SEER as ‘no/unknown chemotherapy use’).
Five-year estimates of overall survival and non-breast-cancer-
specific mortality (non-BCSM) were also determined. There was a
significant difference in overall survival among Recurrence Score
groups
(Po0.001),
with
earlier
mortality
corresponding
to
Recurrence Score results ⩾ 31 (data not shown). There was no
significant difference in non-BCSM among Recurrence Score
groups (P = 0.10). Five-year other-cause mortality for the primary
analysis cohort overall was 5.1% (95% CI, 4.8–5.4%), and 5.1%
(95%CI, 4.7–5.6%), 5.0% (95%CI, 4.5–5.5%), and 5.6% (95%CI,
4.6–6.9%) for Recurrence Score o18, 18–30, and ⩾ 31 groups,
respectively. Age was the strongest predictor of non-BCSM
(Po0.001).
Recurrence Score result and breast-cancer-specific mortality
(Node-positive)
A total of 4,691 patients with positive lymph nodes (N+(mic,1–3))
had Recurrence Score results (Supplementary Figure S1). Of these,
2,694 (57%) had Recurrence Score results o18, 1,669 (36%) had
results 18–30, and 328 (7%) had results ⩾ 31. In addition, 50% of
these patients had tumors 410 to 20 mm in size, 55% had
moderate grade tumors, and 78.3% were 50 years of age or older
(Table 1). Among patients with node-positive (N+(mic,1–3))
disease, 5-year BCSM was significantly different for the three
Recurrence Score groups: 1.0% (95% CI, 0.5–2.0%) in the o18
group, 2.3% (95% CI, 1.3–4.1%) in the 18–30 group, and 14.3%
(95% CI, 8.4–23.8%) in the ⩾ 31 group (Po0.001). Chemotherapy
use was reported as ‘yes’ (rather than ‘no/unknown’) in 23%, 47%,
and 75% of patients in the Recurrence Score o18, 18–30, and
⩾ 31 groups, respectively. Excluding patients with micrometastatic
disease, there were 2,617 patients with 1–3 positive nodes. Of
these, 1,487 also had Recurrence Score results o18 with 5-year
BCSM of 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–2.9%).
Subgroups and breast-cancer-specific mortality
Recurrence Score group was significantly prognostic (P ⩽ 0.001) for
5-year BCSM for the node-negative and the node-positive
(N+(mic,1–3)) populations as wholes, in every node-negative
subgroup of age, grade, race, and socioeconomic (SES) status, and
in the node-positive (N+(mic,1–3)) subgroups with substantial
numbers of patients (410 to 20 mm, moderate grade, age 60–69
years, and White; Figure 2a–j Supplementary Table S1). Notably,
5-year BCSM was 1.3% or lower for patients with Recurrence Score
results o18, regardless of nodal status and age group. Similarly,
low BCSM was observed for patients o70 years of age with
Recurrence Score results 18–30. However, for patients with
Recurrence Score results ⩾ 31, 5-year BCSM was substantially
higher and ranged from 2.0 to 21.6%, depending on age group
(Figure 2a). Among patients with node-positive (N+(mic,1–3))
disease, those with Recurrence Score results ⩾ 31 had 5-year BCSM
that exceeded 9.5%, regardless of age group (Figure 2b). For
patients with both node-negative and node-positive (N+(mic,1–3))
disease, reported chemotherapy use generally decreased with
increasing age.
For patients with node-negative or node-positive (N+(mic,1–3))
disease, those with higher Recurrence Score results had higher
5-year BCSM than those with lower results, regardless of race
(White or Black; Figure 2c,d) and regardless of SES quintile (Figure
2e,f). Of note, among patients with node-negative disease and
Recurrence Score results ⩾ 31, 5-year BCSM appeared to decrease
with higher quintiles, despite similar reported chemotherapy use
across SES quintiles (68–70%; Figure 2e). Among patients with
node-positive (N+(mic,1–3)) disease and Recurrence Score results
⩾ 31, 5-year BCSM exceeded 9%, regardless of SES quintile
(Figure 2f).
Among patients with node-negative disease, Recurrence Score
group was significantly prognostic (Po0.05) for subgroups
analyzed by tumor grade (Figure 2g) and tumor size (Figure 2i),
except for patients with very small tumors. For patients with
tumors ⩽ 5 mm in size, the estimated risk is elevated in the group
with Recurrence Score results ⩾ 31, although the estimate lacks
precision (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.3–12.5%). Among patients with node-
negative disease and tumors 44 cm in size, Recurrence Score

 group was significantly prognostic (P = 0.005), but all three
Recurrence Score groups have estimated 5-year BCSM of 2.4%
or higher (Figure 2i). For patients with node-positive (N+(mic,1–3))
disease, those with higher Recurrence Score results generally had
worse 5-year BCSM than those with lower results, regardless
of tumor size (Figure 2j).
With respect to tumor grade, regardless of nodal status, 5-year
BCSM generally increased with worsening grade, as expected
(Figure 2g,h). Within grade categories, however, the group with
Recurrence Score results o18 consistently had low 5-year BCSM
(o1%
for
node-negative
disease;
o2%
for
node-positive
(N+(mic,1–3)) disease), even for patients with high tumor grade.
For patients with node-negative disease and Recurrence Score
results ⩾ 31, 5-year BCSM was 42%, even for patients with low
tumor grade.
Multivariable model with adjustment for baseline covariates
The effects of Recurrence Score results and potential confounding
variables were assessed using a Cox regression model. Compared
with patients with a Recurrence Score result o18 and without
adjusting for other covariates, patients with Recurrence Score
results 18–30 and results ⩾ 31 had higher hazards for BCSM. These
effects were modestly attenuated after adjustment for grade,
tumor size, age, and race (Table 2); however, the Recurrence Score
18–30 and ⩾ 31 groups remain at significantly increased hazards
(Po0.001). Because Recurrence Score results are known to affect
treatment decisions, an additional model was fit with a treatment
interaction. In this model, Recurrence Score results remained
prognostic among both patients for whom chemotherapy was
reported as ‘yes’ and as ‘no/unknown,’ but the strength of the
association was attenuated for those with chemotherapy reported
as ‘yes’ (P = 0.03 for covariate-adjusted interaction). Comparable
models fitted using Recurrence Score result as a continuous linear
variable were also significant for prognosis, with and without
adjustment for covariates (Po0.001 for both).
In the covariate-adjusted model, increases in the hazard
of BCSM were significantly associated with poorly differentiated
tumors (hazard ratio (HR) 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3–3.2), P = 0.002), tumors
44 cm in size (HR 3.4 (95% CI, 1.3–8.7), P = 0.010), age 70–79 years
(HR 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2–5.0), P = 0.014), and age ⩾ 80 years (HR 6.1
(95% CI, 2.6–14.3), Po0.001). Patients with very small tumors
(⩽5 mm) did not have significantly different outcomes than
patients had with tumors 45 to 10 mm in size. The youngest
patients (o40 years) did not have significantly different outcomes
than patients who were 40–49 years or 50–59 years of age. In
contrast, older patients at the time of diagnosis (⩾70 years) had

 significantly worse BCSM in both the unadjusted and adjusted
models.
The multivariable model also demonstrated differences in
outcomes by race. An alternate model, replacing race with Yost
quintile, as a marker for neighborhood SES, also showed
worsening outcomes with lower SES; however, neither race nor
SES were significant when both terms were included in the same
model, and both effects are relatively weak compared to the
genomic and clinical factors.
TAILORx clinical trial cutpoints
Since its initial development, the 21-gene assay results report has
used Recurrence Score cutpoints of 18 and 31, and has provided
individualized risk estimates for the specific Recurrence Score
result for each patient. Alternative cutpoints, however, have been
implemented in clinical trials. The ongoing TAILORx randomized
trial uses cutpoints of 11 and 25 to define Recurrence Score
categories o11, 11–25, and 425.13 Applying these alternative
categories to our study cohort, the 5-year BCSM in the HR+, node-
negative, non-age-restricted cohort were 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2–0.6%)
for 7,281 patients with Recurrence Score results o11, 0.7% (95%
CI, 0.6–0.8%) for 26,462 patients with Recurrence Score results
11–25, and 3.6% (95% CI, 3.0–4.4%) for 6,391 patients with
Recurrence Score results 425 (Po0.001). Considering both the
standard cutpoints and the TAILORx cutpoints, the 5-year BCSM
for 10,589 patients with Recurrence Score results 18–24 and 3,905
patients with Recurrence Score results 25–30 were 1.0% (95% CI,
0.8–1.4%) and 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8–3.2%), respectively.
DISCUSSION
Our prespecified primary analysis of the population-based SEER
database electronically supplemented with Recurrence Score
results showed that the Recurrence Score result was significantly
associated with the likelihood of BCSM (Po0.001). In multivariable
analysis that adjusted for the prognostic baseline covariates of
patient age, tumor size, tumor grade, and race, as well as reported
chemotherapy use, the Recurrence Score result remained strongly
predictive of BCSM (Po0.001).
We showed that patients with node-negative disease in the
SEER program with Recurrence Score results o18, who had low
rates of chemotherapy use reported as ‘yes’ (7%), had 5-year BCSM
of 0.4% (95% CI, 0.3–0.6%), a finding that is consistent with those
of earlier, prospective–retrospective clinical validation studies
performed on archival specimens.9,11,17 For example, 5-year BCSM
for patients with Recurrence Score results o18 was 0.9% (95% CI,
0.3–2.8%) in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project (NSABP) B-14 study and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.5–1.6%) in the
Kaiser study (L. Habel, personal communication). That our results
for patients with Recurrence Score results o18 were similar to
earlier results, despite dissimilar time periods in which each cohort
was enrolled, demonstrates the capacity of the Recurrence Score
result to identify patients with excellent prognosis, regardless of
the era in which they were diagnosed or the specific treatments
they received. Moreover, the favorable outcomes we observed in
patients with node-negative disease and Recurrence Score results
o18 confirm—and extend—findings of the TAILORx trial, the Clalit
Health Services study, and the PlanB trial of the Women’s
Healthcare Study Group in Germany, all of which reported excellent
outcomes for patients with low Recurrence Score results.13–15
For patients with node-positive (N+(mic,1–3)) disease, the
Recurrence Score result was strongly predictive of BCSM, despite
the relatively short-median follow-up. For patients with Recur-
rence Score results o18, 23% of whom had chemotherapy use
reported as ‘yes,’ the 5-year BCSM was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.5–2.0%),
similar to the 5-year BCSM observed for patients with node-
negative disease. These results in more than 4,600 patients with
node-positive disease reconfirm the Recurrence Score results from
the SWOG 8814 and ATAC studies showing that the 21-gene assay
identifies a group of patients with node-positive disease and
Recurrence Score results o18 with favorable outcomes.11,12 The
ongoing Treatment (Rx) for Positive Node, Endocrine Responsive
Breast Cancer (RxPONDER) clinical trial,18 in which patients with
node-positive disease and Recurrence Score results o25 are
randomized to endocrine therapy with or without adjuvant
chemotherapy, should provide more definitive information on

 the effect of chemotherapy. Our SEER results provide prospective
evidence that certain patients with node-positive disease and low
Recurrence Score results have favorable 5-year BCSM, and
reassurance that the randomization in RxPONDER was justified.
Prior to our study, there were relatively little data regarding
Recurrence Score results and outcomes in younger and older
patients with breast cancer. For example, only 3% of patients in
the NSABP B-14 study,19 5% in the ongoing TAILORx trial
(J. Sparano, personal communication), and 0% in the ongoing
MINDACT trial were older than 70 years.20 Our population-based
SEER study is therefore noteworthy for providing the largest
experience to date with patients ⩾ 70 years of age, including 4,647
with
node-negative
disease
and
880
with
node-positive
(N+(mic,1–3)) disease, and with patients o40 years, including
1,480 with node-negative disease and 165 with node-positive
(N+(mic,1–3)) disease. Our study found that regardless of age,
patients with Recurrence Score results
o18 had excellent
outcomes: 5-year BCSM was o1.3% in the node-negative group
and o1.7% in the node-positive (N+(mic,1–3)) group. Importantly,
although younger age is considered an unfavorable prognostic
factor,21 the 5-year BCSM of 0.0% that we observed in 682 patients
o40 years with node-negative disease and Recurrence Score
results o18 indicates that the Recurrence Score assay identified a
subset of very young patients that had excellent outcomes.
We noted that outcomes were especially poor for older patients
with node-negative disease and Recurrence Score results ⩾ 31:
5-year BCSM was 10.4% for patients 70–79 years and 21.6% for
patients ⩾ 80 years. Within this Recurrence Score group (⩾31),
72% of patients o70 years, but only 53% of patients ⩾ 70 years,
had chemotherapy use reported as ‘yes.’ Previous studies have
reported that older women with breast cancer generally receive
less aggressive treatment than younger patients do and are more
likely to die from their disease.22–25 Importantly, practice guide-
lines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network on ‘Older
Adult Oncology’ acknowledge that older women with breast
cancer ‘often do not receive ‘standard of care.26’ Clearly, as
population demographics shift, it is imperative that we under-
stand and take action to lessen BCSM in older patients. A more-
detailed analysis of the older population in SEER is underway to
examine comorbidities, competing risks, and outcomes in patients
with and without 21-gene assay testing.
We further show that the Recurrence Score result was
significantly prognostic for BCSM in every subgroup of race, SES,
and pathology (with the possible exception of tumors ⩽ 5 mm in
size, although the general trend for this subgroup was consistent
with observations made in subgroups with larger tumors). For
several
subgroups
historically
under-represented
in
clinical
studies, including patients of lower SES and patients who identify
as non-White, our results add substantially to the body of
knowledge relating the Recurrence Score results to outcomes.
Finally, Recurrence Score biology at diagnosis was a very strong
predictor of BCSM but, as expected, was not predictive of other-
cause mortality. Age was the strongest predictor of other-cause
mortality. It will be important in future studies to assess in greater
detail BCSM in the context of other-cause mortality and patient
comorbidities.
The availability now of prospective outcomes for over 50,000
patients with Recurrence Score results across multiple studies
carries implications for both clinical practice and breast cancer
staging. Use of clinical and pathologic factors alone (e.g., luminal
A-like or luminal B-like) may be inadequate to select patients for
consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy. The 21-gene Recurrence
Score assay has the capacity to further risk-stratify within any
clinical or pathologic category (including luminal A-like and
luminal B-like),27,28 based on tumor biology. At present, the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is working to revise
the current TNM breast cancer staging system, largely limited to
anatomic information, to incorporate new molecular testing
information. Collaborations between SEER and diagnostic testing
companies, such as the research model pioneered in this study,
can provide evidence from large high-quality datasets to support
updated criteria for cancer staging.
In general, observational studies can provide valuable informa-
tion on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in actual clinical
practice. When very large, observational studies can provide new
information about subgroups of patients that randomized clinical
trials are often not powered to assess. Nonetheless, observational
studies, like ours, have limitations. First, data in the SEER Program
are derived from patients who were not randomized to treatment.
This potentially introduces bias and confounding factors for
estimating treatment effects that cannot be fully controlled. To
enhance the rigor of our large observational study, we applied the
Good Research for Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) Principles
of good study design and implementation to the methodology
and analyses.29 Second, the SEER Program collects no information
on breast cancer recurrence and progression. Third, chemotherapy
use is under-reported in SEER. Although the magnitude of under-
reporting is unknown, one study involving the Medicare popula-
tion suggested a 30% relative under-ascertainment.30 For the
reasons of under-reporting of chemotherapy use and selection
bias in who elected to get chemotherapy, we do not report BCSM
by treatment choice. Although we do report the percent for whom
chemotherapy is reported as ‘yes’ versus ‘no/unknown’ in various
subgroups, the limitations of this variable should be kept in mind
when interpreting these results. At the time of this analysis with
SEER survival follow-up only through 2012, the extent of patient
follow-up beyond 5 years was limited. However, with the large
sample size, the confidence intervals for the 5-year BCSM
estimates are narrow. Moreover, the reported overall benefit of
chemotherapy has been observed by 5 years.31 Finally, other
multigene signatures for breast recurrence risk were not included
in this analysis. It should be noted that the 21-gene assay
accounted for 493% of tests reported to SEER by manual
collection in 2010–2012.
Our study nevertheless had a number of strengths. First, ours is
the largest-to-date study of prospective outcomes based on
Recurrence Score results in node-negative and node-positive
disease. Second, the SEER Program is remarkable for its stringent
ascertainment of population-based patient-specific data at the
time of diagnosis and at the time of death. Third, the population-
based nature of the SEER registries combined with the size of the
database of the Genomic Health Clinical Laboratory (the only
laboratory that performs the 21-gene assay) ensures that study
results reflect real-world practices.
In the future, we plan to conduct additional analyses, including
among others: (a) continued follow-up of the SEER registries to
encompass an ever-increasing number of patients; (b) in-depth
analyses of important subgroups by, for example, race, ethnicity,
SES, and sex; (c) determination of propensity scores for chemother-
apy benefit; (d) assessment of factors that influence assay ordering,
including geography; and (e) comparison of manually collected and
Genomic Health Clinical Laboratory-reported Recurrence Score
results. In addition, we plan to conduct an analogous analysis after
merging with the SEER-Medicare database.
In conclusion, this study represents a new model for collabora-
tion between National Cancer Institute, SEER registries, and
industry to more efficiently and completely capture important
genomic test results to inform understanding of ‘real-world’
oncology practice. Our study results strongly reinforce the
findings of the prospectively designed TAILORx trial, other
prospective outcomes studies, and numerous earlier prospec-
tive–retrospective validation studies.9–15,17 Our SEER study pro-
vides additional evidence in 444,000 patients with node-negative
and node-positive (N+(mic,1–3)) disease that the 21-gene assay
accurately predicts prospective outcomes, independent of patient
age, tumor size, and tumor grade.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The electronic linkage of the 21-gene Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score
assay (Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) results from the
Genomic Health Clinical Laboratory database with the SEER registries
database was based on protected health information included in the these
databases. The linkage was performed by Information Management Services
(IMS, Calverton, MD, USA), a National Cancer Institute contractor that
manages cancer surveillance data for SEER Program registries, using the Link
Plus software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Cancer
Prevention and Control, National Program of Cancer Registries; Atlanta, GA,
USA), a deterministic SAS algorithm, and manual adjudication of partial
matches by registries staff. De-identified data were released to the study
team after SEER approval of a custom data request. This linkage allowed for
the inclusion of Recurrence Score results from 2004 and for more complete
Recurrence Score capture from 2010 forward (manuscript in preparation).
The primary survival analysis cohort, statistical methodology, and study
end point were prespecified before the data linkage was performed. The
primary survival analysis cohort was specified as all patients in the SEER
research database diagnosed between 1 January 2004 and 31 December
2011 who had lymph node-negative, HR+, HER2-negative, primary invasive
breast cancer, and a Recurrence Score result in the Genomic Health Clinical
Laboratory
database. Standard cutoffs that
define risk
groups by
Recurrence Score results are as follows: low (o18), intermediate (18–30),
and high (⩾31). Patients were excluded if they had metastatic disease, any
previous history of invasive cancer (but not prior ductal carcinoma in situ),
or multiple Recurrence Score results for any reason (e.g., multifocal disease
or concurrent primary tumors).
To be more consistent with the patient populations of the NSABP B-14
and Kaiser clinical validation studies,9,17 the primary survival analysis was
restricted to patients with lymph node-negative, HR+ HER2-negative
breast cancer who were 40–84 years of age at diagnosis. Secondary
survival analyses of various subgroups included patients of all ages and
patients with node-positive disease.
Patients were considered HR+ if their tumors were estrogen receptor- or
progesterone receptor-positive (ER+ or PR+) by the SEER-reported ER and PR
immunohistochemistry results (borderline results were considered positive)
and by the 21-gene assay quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
single-gene ER or PR results. Patients were considered node-negative or
node-positive based on the data collected by SEER. According to the AJCC
6th and 7th edition,32 micrometastases were considered lymph node-
positive and isolated tumor cells were considered lymph node-negative. The
SEER database includes no information on HER2 status prior to 2010. Thus,
HER2-negative patients were identified among those with Recurrence Score
results who had 21-gene assay quantitative RT-PCR single-gene HER2 scores
⩽11.5.33–35 Rare cases in which tumors were classified in SEER as
undifferentiated or anaplastic were considered to be poorly differentiated.
Both male and female patients were included in all analyses.
End point
The study end point for all outcome analyses was BCSM. Underlying causes
of death (CODs) were ascertained by the SEER registries through linkages
with state death certificates and the National Death Index from the
National Center for Health Statistics.36 In addition, vital status was
ascertained through linkages with other sources, such as state Depart-
ments of Motor Vehicles, state voter registration databases, and the Social
Security Administration. To correct the known errors with COD attribution,
the SEER program developed a special COD variable that maps underlying
CODs to the primary cancer diagnosis.37 We used this variable to assign a
broad set of CODs to capture deaths from breast cancer among patients
diagnosed with an incident breast cancer in SEER. Patients who did not die
of breast cancer were censored at time of last follow-up (31 December
2011) or at time of death from other causes.
To protect patient confidentiality, time to event in SEER is captured in
months rather than days. Therefore, actuarial methods rather than Kaplan–
Meier methods were utilized for event and freedom-from-event calcula-
tions. Five-year BCSM was selected as the summary outcome measure of
greatest importance based on its importance as a clinically meaningful end
point and limited BCSM follow-up beyond 5 years.
Statistical analysis
The primary survival analysis was prespecified to be performed on eligible
patients in the three categorical Recurrence Score groups based on the
standard 21-gene assay Recurrence Score cutpoints: o18, 18–30, or ⩾ 31.
The continuous Recurrence Score result (0–100) was evaluated in
secondary analyses. Actuarial estimates of survival were computed
through 5 years with 95% CIs. The log-rank test was used to compare
the three Recurrence Score groups. Hazard ratios were calculated using
Cox regression models, which were fit using SAS PROC PHREG (SAS/STAT
version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Proportional hazards
assumptions were assessed and met in the final models. Two sets of
prognostic models were fit: one set used the three-category Recurrence
Score group variable and the second, as a sensitivity analysis, used the
continuous Recurrence Score result.
It is important to note that the Recurrence Score result is provided to
patients and physicians to guide treatment decisions. Although the result
is one of many factors that influence treatment decision-making, the group
with Recurrence Score results o18 has been shown in multiple previous
studies to have a much lower rate of reported chemotherapy use than the
groups with higher Recurrence Score results.38–41 Thus, the difference in
BCSM curves among the three Recurrence Score groups was expected to
be smaller, in percentage terms, than if all patients were treated with
hormonal therapy alone. Adjusting for treatment was not straightforward
because treatment itself is influenced by the Recurrence Score result and
there is a known issue with ascertainment bias for treatment. As a
sensitivity analysis, multivariable models were fit including Recurrence
Score results, treatment, and an interaction in the model; however, these
models should not be used to evaluate comparative effectiveness.
Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, race, tumor size, tumor
grade, and SES Index. The SES Index was created by SEER and is based on
each patient’s census-tract at-diagnosis attributes reflected by the Yost
composite Index. To further protect patients’ privacy, the SES Index is
categorized in quintiles.42
