Abstract
Background
Rates of diabetes in Mexico are among the highest worldwide. In 2014, Mexico instituted a
nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in order to reduce the high level of
SSB consumption, a preventable cause of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We
used an established computer simulation model of CVD and country-specific data on
demographics, epidemiology, SSB consumption, and short-term changes in consumption
following the SSB tax in order to project potential long-range health and economic impacts
of SSB taxation in Mexico.
Methods and Findings
We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model–Mexico, a state transition model of
Mexican adults aged 35–94 y, to project the potential future effects of reduced SSB intake
on diabetes incidence, CVD events, direct diabetes healthcare costs, and mortality over
10 y. Model inputs included short-term changes in SSB consumption in response to taxa-
tion (price elasticity) and data from government and market research surveys and public
healthcare institutions. Two main scenarios were modeled: a 10% reduction in SSB con-
sumption (corresponding to the reduction observed after tax implementation) and a 20%
reduction in SSB consumption (possible with increases in taxation levels and/or additional
measures to curb consumption). Given uncertainty about the degree to which Mexicans will

 replace calories from SSBs with calories from other sources, we evaluated a range of val-
ues for calorie compensation.
We projected that a 10% reduction in SSB consumption with 39% calorie compensation
among Mexican adults would result in about 189,300 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]
155,400–218,100) fewer incident type 2 diabetes cases, 20,400 fewer incident strokes and
myocardial infarctions, and 18,900 fewer deaths occurring from 2013 to 2022. This sce-
nario predicts that the SSB tax could save Mexico 983 million international dollars (95% UI
$769 million–$1,173 million). The largest relative and absolute reductions in diabetes and
CVD events occurred in the youngest age group modeled (35–44 y).
This study’s strengths include the use of an established mathematical model of CVD
and use of contemporary Mexican vital statistics, data from health surveys, healthcare
costs, and SSB price elasticity estimates as well as probabilistic and deterministic sensitiv-
ity analyses to account for uncertainty. The limitations of the study include reliance on US-
based studies for certain inputs where Mexico-specific data were lacking (specifically the
associations between risk factors and CVD outcomes [from the Framingham Heart Study]
and SSB calorie compensation assumptions), limited data on healthcare costs other than
those related to diabetes, and lack of information on long-term SSB price elasticity that is
specific to geographic and economic subgroups.
Conclusions
Mexico’s high diabetes prevalence represents a public health crisis. While the long-term
impact of Mexico’s SSB tax is not yet known, these projections, based on observed con-
sumption reductions, suggest that Mexico’s SSB tax may substantially decrease morbidity
and mortality from diabetes and CVD while reducing healthcare costs.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• The prevalence of obesity and diabetes in Mexico has risen dramatically in recent years,
and the rate of diabetes in Mexico currently ranks among the highest in the world.
• Mexicans consume a large volume of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), a preventable
risk factor for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.
• In order to address the obesity and diabetes epidemic, the Mexican government imple-
mented a 10% excise tax on SSBs in 2014.
• Although consumer data suggest that the tax has resulted in a decrease in SSB purchases,
little is known about the longer-term impact the SSB tax will have on disease burden and
healthcare costs in Mexico.

 What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We conducted a computer simulation study in order to understand the potential impact
of the tax on diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mortality, and healthcare costs associated
with diabetes among Mexican adults 35–94 years of age over a period of 10 years (2013–
2022).
• To do this, we developed a Mexico version of an established model of cardiovascular dis-
ease in the US (the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model) using national-level data from
Mexico wherever possible.
• We found that the 10% tax on SSBs will likely prevent approximately 189,300 new cases
of type 2 diabetes, 20,400 incident strokes and heart attacks, and 18,900 deaths over 10
years among adults 35–94 years of age, and is expected to result in 983 million interna-
tional dollars in savings in healthcare costs because of the prevention of diabetes cases.
• The largest reductions in health burden and healthcare spending are projected to occur
among the youngest adults included in the simulation (those 35–44 years of age).
What Do These Findings Mean?
• The national tax on SSBs in Mexico is projected to have a substantial impact on the bur-
den of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality over 10 years.
• With the largest effects of the tax observedamong the youngest age group modeled, we
expect the impact of the intervention to become more dramatic as the population ages.
• The SSB tax may be an important component in a multifaceted strategy by the Mexican
government to curb the obesity and diabetes epidemic in Mexico.
Introduction
Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has risen rapidly in Mexico in recent years [1,2],
with one-fifth of total daily caloric intake among adults currently estimated to come from SSBs
(including sugar-sweetened soda, coffee, tea, and agua fresca [flavored water]). Observational
and intervention studies have demonstrated that higher SSB consumption is linked to greater
risk of cardiometabolic outcomes [3–5]. Of particular concern in Mexico is the link between
high SSB consumption and obesity and diabetes given the dramatic increase in these conditions
over a short period of time [6]. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes in Mexico now rank
among the highest in the world; approximately 70% of Mexican adults are considered over-
weight or obese, and 14% have diabetes [7]. Diabetes is now the leading cause of death and, in
2011, cost the Mexican government an estimated US$7.7 billion in direct and indirect costs
[8,9]. As a result of recent trends, Mexico is projected to bear an ever increasing burden of
health-related costs from diabetic complications including cardiovascular disease (CVD).
In response to the population’s high consumption of SSBs and the diabetes epidemic, the
Mexican government instituted several initiatives in 2014 guided by recommendations from its
Ministry of Health [10]. Included among these initiatives was a 10% excise tax on SSBs (one

 Mexican peso per liter) levied on manufacturers effective January 1, 2014. Market research sur-
veys have demonstrated that SSB purchases by Mexican households declined by an average of
6% in 2014, reaching a 12% decrease by December 2014 [11]. The expectation is that taxation
will result in sustained population-wide reductions in SSB intake and downstream prevention
of diabetes, CVD, and other negative health outcomes. However, epidemiologic and economic
evidence demonstrating the policy’s impact will take years to emerge and may be confounded
by changes in medical practice and other secular trends. The purpose of this analysis is to build
on current evidencein order to project the longer-term impact of SSB taxation on diabetes, cor-
onary heart disease (CHD), stroke, mortality, and associated healthcare costs in Mexico.
Methods
The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model developed for Mexico
The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model (CVDPM) is a computer-simulation state transition
(Markov) model of CHD and stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and costs and has been
used to forecast trends in CVD in the US and other countries for over 25 y [12–14]. The
CVDPM models the population of adults aged 35–94 y (and excludes children and young
adults under 35 y of age), with new 35-y-olds entering the simulated population each annual
cycle. The CVDPM uses estimates generated from Framingham Heart Study Original Cohort
and Offspring Cohort data [15–18] to predict incident type 2 diabetes, CHD, stroke, and non-
CVD mortality among persons without CVD, based on age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP),
body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level, smoking, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The CVDPM also predicts subsequent
life years, CVD events, coronary revascularization procedures, CVD mortality, and non-CVD
mortality among persons with CVD. The model is written in Fortran 95 and compiled using
the Lahey Fortran 95 compiler V7.2 (Lahey Computer Systems).
The present analysis uses a newly created version of the CVDPM, the CVDPM–Mexico,
adapted for analyses of epidemiologyand policies in the Mexican population. The CVDPM–
Mexico is based on Mexico-specificdemographic and epidemiologic data and is calibrated to
cardiac events and deaths among Mexicans in 2010. The CVDPM–Mexico is summarized
below, and a detailed description is presented in S1 Appendix, which includes a description of
the model’s structure (Figure A in S1 Appendix), data sources for Mexico-specificinputs
(Table A in S1 Appendix), model calibration (Figure B in S1 Appendix), and intervention sim-
ulation assumptions (Tables B and C and Figure C in S1 Appendix).
Mexico-Specific Epidemiologic Inputs
Estimates of the 2010 adult population of Mexico were obtained from the National Institute of
Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía),and projections of the
population through 2050 from the National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Pobla-
ción) [19,20].
Age- and sex-specificmeans and distributions for five of six modeled risk factors (SBP, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, BMI, and diabetes) were
estimated from the 2006 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (Encuesta Nacional
de Salud y Nutrición [ENSANUT]) [21], a nationally representative cross-sectional survey that
used multi-stage cluster sampling of the Mexican population. Data on smoking prevalence was
obtained from the 2009 Adult Smoking Survey (Encuesta Global de Tabaquismo en Adultos)
[22], a nationally representative survey of Mexicans aged 15 y and older. Estimates of CHD
and stroke prevalence were generated from ENSANUT 2006. Data on total and cause-specific
mortality in 2010 are from the National Health Information System (Sistema Nacional de

 Información en Salud [SINAIS]) [23], and deaths were categorized according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes [24].
National in-hospital CHD and stroke events, deaths, and case fatality rates in 2010 were
estimated based on data from three public health institutions that provide health servicesto
73% of Mexico’s population [7]: the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano del
Seguro Social [IMSS]) [25], the State Employee’s Social Security and ServicesInstitute (Insti-
tuto de Seguridady ServiciosSocialesde los Trabajadores del Estado [ISSSTE]) [26], and the
Ministry of Health (data acquired from SINAIS) [27,28]. Deaths occurringin other public
health institutions were obtained from SINAIS 2010 mortality data [29]. The CVDPM–Mexico
was calibrated to within �1% of national estimates of CHD and stroke events and CHD deaths
in 2010 (Figure B in S1 Appendix).
Mexico-Specific Healthcare Costs
We computed age-decile-specificmean annual direct per-patient healthcare costs incurred by
persons with type 2 diabetes in 2012 using methodologydescribedpreviously and detailed in
S1 Appendix [30,31]. We first used national expenditure data from the System of Health
Accounts (Sistema de Cuentas de Salud en Mexico) [32] to determine the total 2011 expendi-
tures separately for generalist outpatient visits, specialist outpatient visits, and hospitalizations
for each of the three primary healthcare institutions (IMSS, ISSSTE, and the Ministry of
Health). We then determined the average cost of each visit type for each institution by dividing
the expenditure total by the count of visits and hospitalization days obtained from utilization
databases [25,26,28]. Utilization data were further used to determine the average number of
servicesused in 2011 by those with diabetes (defined as records with ICD-10 codes E11–E14 in
the first or second code position) for each institution, servicetype, and age stratum; these val-
ues were then multiplied by the institution-specificaverage cost for each serviceand summed
over servicetypes for institution-level annual costs per diabetes patient by age. For our cost
inputs, we then generated an overall mean annual cost per diabetes patient for each age group
(model cost inputs) by taking a weighted average of institution-specificcosts, using as weights
the proportion of diabetes patients receiving healthcare at each institution as measured by
ENSANUT 2012 [7]. Expenditures were converted into 2011 US dollars using a purchasing
power parity rate of 7.67 Mexican pesos = 1.00 international dollar, and inflated to 2012 cur-
rency using a 3.57% inflation rate [33]. The total direct healthcare expenditure calculated for
Mexicans aged 35 to 94 y and living with diabetes in 2011 was approximately 7 billion interna-
tional dollars (54 billion Mexican pesos) (Table B in S1 Appendix).
Base Case Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption in Mexico
Data from ENSANUT 2012 were used to estimate daily caloric intake from SSBs [7]. A one-
time 24-h dietary recall administered to 13% of the ENSANUT 2012 sample assessed the type
and quantity of foods and beverages consumed over the past day during meals and between
meals, occurringboth inside and outside the home, including measurement on weekdays and
weekends [7,34]. The following were included in our definition of SSBs: industrializedflavored
waters, sodas, aguas frescas, horchatas (rice waters), chocolate water, fruit juices, vegetable
juices, and sports and energy drinks. Because interventions simulated in the CVDPM operate
as changes in age- and gender-stratified mean values, we computed the mean and standard
error (SE) of total volume (in milliliters) and number of servings(355 ml [12 fl. oz.] = 1 serv-
ing) of SSBs consumed per day for each sex and age stratum, which were in turn used to gener-
ate model inputs. The number of servingsper day was also converted into average total calories
from SSBs consumed per day (1 serving = 150 calories).

 Effect of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Cardiovascular Disease Risk
Factors
Based on review of epidemiologic studies, we modeled direct and independent effects of SSB
consumption on three factors related to CVD: diabetes incidence, mean BMI, and mean SBP
(Figure C in S1 Appendix) [5,35]. In addition, changes in diabetes incidence and mean SBP
associated with SSB intake were assumed to be partially mediated through BMI [5,36]. Each
additional serving of SSB per day (defined as 355 ml/d) was assumed to be associated with a
1.19-fold (95% CI 1.09, 1.31) increased risk of diabetes independent of changes in BMI [5].
Inputs for the increased risk of diabetes associated with increased BMI were estimated using
Framingham Heart Study data [15–18]. For blood pressure, we assumed that each additional
SSB serving per day is associated with an SBP increase of 0.78 mm Hg (95% CI 0.09, 1.47) in
men and 0.61 mm Hg (95% CI −0.27, 1.48) in women independent of BMI and that each one-
unit increase in BMI is associated with a 1.43–mm Hg and 1.24–mm Hg increase in SBP in
men and women, respectively [35]. Changes in caloric consumption were translated into
changes in weight (using the conversion of 3,500 kcal/lb.), and the average height reported in
ENSANUT 2006 was used to calculate corresponding changes in BMI (weight [kg]/height
[m]2). Because the relationship between caloric consumption and weight loss may be variable
and because it is not precisely known the degree to which calories reduced through decreased
SSB consumption will be replaced by calories from other sources [37,38], we include model
scenarios that assume the broadest possible range in weight change (from no weight change
associated with SSB consumption change to all calories reduced through decreased SSB con-
sumption translated into weight change as describedabove). For a detailed description of our
approach to modeling the relationship between changes in SSB consumption and CVD risk
factors and outcomes, see our previous work on SSBs in the US [39,40].
Model Simulations
The CVDPM–Mexico was used to predict the impact of reductions in SSB intake on type 2 dia-
betes incidence, CVD incidence, CVD mortality, all-cause mortality, and healthcare costs over
10 y (2013–2022). To quantify anticipated changes in CVD risk factors expected from the SSB
tax, two factors were taken into consideration: (1) the change in SSB consumption predicted to
result from the 10% excise tax (price elasticity) and (2) the degree to which individuals would
replace calories consumed through SSBs with calories from other sources (calorie compensa-
tion). SSB purchases by Mexican households declined by an increasing rate over 2014, reaching
a decrease of 12% by December 2014 [11]. This observedeffect corresponds with studies of
Mexico’s consumer soda price elasticity (−0.72 to −1.30), suggesting that the 10% tax on SSBs
in Mexico would result in a 10%–13% decline in SSB consumption [41,42]. Our main analysis
modeled a 10% decrease in SSB consumption starting in year 1 and sustained over the 10-y
simulation. Colchero et al. observedan average increase in purchases of non-taxed beverages
including diet soda, water, and unsweetened dairy and fruit juice in response to the tax, but
whether this shift in consumption resulted in a reduction in calories consumed is unclear [11].
We therefore estimated that 39% of the calories reduced by lowering SSB intake would be
replaced by calories from other sources, yielding a net 61% reduction in total calories from
SSBs, based on prior work in the US context [38]. The sensitivity of results to this assumption
were tested in separate analyses that assumed 0% caloric compensation (all calories reduced
through decreased SSB consumption are translated into weight changes) and 100% caloric
compensation (only the independent effects of decreased SSB intake on diabetes and SBP are
modeled, with no changes in BMI). In addition to assuming a 10% decline in SSB consumption
for primary analyses, additional simulations were performed assuming a 20% reduction in SSB

 intake with 0%, 39%, and 100% calorie compensation in order to evaluate benefits that might
be achieved from additional interventions such as higher levels of SSB taxation or other initia-
tives that have been implemented by the Mexican government, including nutritional guidelines
for school lunches, front-of-package food labeling, and restrictions of food and beverage adver-
tising targeted to children [10,43].
Probabilistic and Deterministic Sensitivity Analyses
We used Monte Carlo simulations to generate 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) around our pri-
mary outcome measures for each intervention scenario. The 95% confidence intervals for esti-
mates of the effect of changes in SSB consumption on SBP and on diabetes risk as well as the
beta inputs for model risk functions defining the relationship between risk factors and incident
diabetes, incident CHD, incident stroke, and non-CVD death are included in Table C of S1
Appendix. There were 1,000 random draws from a standard normal distribution, scaled to the
mean and confidence interval, for each varied parameter. The Monte Carlo program, written
in Python, generated a new set of input parameters drawn from the distributions for each itera-
tion, ran the given iteration base case and reduced SSB consumption simulations with the new
parameters, and stored the outcomes for each iteration. The 95% UIs for each outcome were
then calculated using Microsoft Excel 2010.
We used deterministic approaches to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to assumptions
about the degree of calorie compensation and weight loss associated with reduced SSB intake
(describedabove). To assess the health and economic impacts that could result from higher
levels of taxation and/or additional public health interventions to curb SSB consumption in
Mexico, we conducted a scenario analysis that assumed a 40% reduction in current levels of
SSB consumption. There is a limited body of evidence suggesting that the risk of CHD, stroke,
and non-CVD death may be higher among individuals with diabetes in Mexico compared to
individuals with diabetes in the US [44,45]. We therefore conducted a sensitivity analysis using
betas approximately 2-fold higher than those derived from the Framingham Heart Study and
evaluated the effect on CVD and mortality outcomes.
Results
Mexican men consumed an average of 1.24 (SE = 0.07) servingsof SSBs per day in 2012, and
women consumed an average of 0.86 (SE = 0.04) servingsper day (Table 1). Men and women
consumed a median 0.97 (interquartile range 0–1.68) and 0.64 (interquartile range 0–1.41)
servingsper day, respectively (S1 Table). Overall, younger adults had higher SSB consumption
than older adults. Assuming no change in SSB consumption from that observedin 2012 and
assuming current obesity rates, model simulations project 3.9 million new cases of diabetes and
1.2 million CVD deaths occurringamong adults 35 to 94 y old between 2013 and 2022.
A population-wide 10% reduction in SSB intake (with 39% calorie compensation) is pro-
jected to reduce the number of new cases of diabetes by 189,300 (95% UI 155,400–218,100) for
the time period 2013 to 2022, a 4.9% lower incidence than what is projected when assuming no
change in SSB consumption (Table 2). The resulting reduction in diabetes burden would
amount to a total savings in direct healthcare costs incurred by diabetes patients of about 983
million international dollars (95% UI $769 million–$1.2 billion) over 10 y (Table 2). Varying
the degree of calorie compensation, a 10% reduction in SSBs could decrease the 10-y cumula-
tive incidence by as few as 66,000 cases (95% UI 39,800–91,600), if 100% of calories reduced
through lower SSB consumption were replaced by calories from other sources, or as many as
265,100 cases (95% UI 222,100–304,100), if all calories reduced through lower SSB consump-
tion were translated into weight change. A 20% reduction in SSB intake with 39% calorie

 compensation would result in approximately 9.5% fewer incident diabetes cases than projected
when assuming no change in SSB consumption, for a total savings of nearly 1.9 billion interna-
tional dollars (95% UI $1.5 billion–$2.3 billion).
The effect of decreasing SSB intake on diabetes incidence and associated costs would be
greater for men than women regardless of scenario (S2 Table). The youngest age group

The base case simulation results serve as the comparator for all intervention scenarios and assume no change in SSB consumption from consumption
levels measured in ENSANUT 2012. Six intervention scenarios are presented, with two levels of SSB consumption lowering (10% and 20% decline) and
three levels of calorie compensation: 100%, 39%, and 0% of calories replaced.
aPercent decline is relative to the number of incident cases of diabetes projected by a model simulation that assumes no change in SSB consumption; the
base case simulation projects a cumulative incidence of diabetes totaling n = 3,888,500 for 2013–2022.
bAmount of savings is for direct healthcare costs for diabetes patients expressed in millions of 2012 international dollars.
cPercent decline is relative to direct healthcare costs associated with diabetes projected under the assumption of no change in SSB consumption; the base
case simulation projects a total cost for diabetes for 2013–2022 of 116,213 million international dollars.

 modeled (ages 35–44 y) had the largest absolute and relative reductions in diabetes incidence,
with roughly half of all cases averted over the 10-y simulation occurringin this age group (Fig
1; S3 Table).
In addition to reducing diabetes, declines in SSB consumption would lower the number of
CVD events and deaths (Table 3). A 10% reduction in SSB consumption with 39% calorie com-
pensation would lower incident CHD cases by approximately 46,300 (95% UI 40,900–51,800),
stroke by 6,200 (95% UI 4,600–8,100), CHD and stroke deaths by 10,900 (95% UI 9,400–12,500),
and deaths from all causes by 18,900 (95% UI 15,500–22,700). The projected decreases in CVD
events and deaths over the 10-y simulation were distributed unequally over age groups (Fig 2).
For all CVD and mortality outcomes, the events avoided with reduced SSB consumption were
concentrated among those under 65 y of age (Fig 2A); the percent decrease in events relative to
the base case (which assumes no change in SSB consumption) was highest among individuals
aged 35–44 y and decreasedprogressively with each increasing age group (Fig 2B; S4 Table).
Cardiovascular disease and mortality results were sensitive to assumptions about the level of
SSB reduction and degree of calorie compensation (Tables 3 and S5). For example, depending
on the range of calorie compensation (from 100% [all calories replaced] to 0% [no calories
replaced]), a 10% decrease in SSB consumption may prevent as few as 1,500 myocardial infarc-
tions (95% UI 500–2,300) or as many as 22,200 myocardial infarctions (95% UI 19,800–
24,600) (Table 3). Assuming a higher CVD event rate and mortality rate associated with diabe-
tes for Mexicans compared with rates predicted from Framingham Heart Study data resulted
in somewhat higher estimates for events averted (S6 Table).
Discussion
Mexico’s SSB consumption has increased in recent years such that SSB calories now account
for a substantial proportion of overall caloric intake [2]. Our population modeling of CVD and
diabetes in Mexico suggests that if Mexico’s SSB tax leads to population-wide reductions in
SSB intake, as suggested by declines in SSB purchases already observedsince the initiation of

 the tax [11], the policy will have a profound impact on disease burden in Mexico. We project
that substantial health gains and cost savings are likely to result from reduced SSB consump-
tion stemming from the current 10% excise tax, particularly among younger Mexicans, who
are the highest consumers of these beverages.
The recent acceleration of obesity and diabetes rates among Mexicans—particularly young
Mexicans—has led to a rapid increase in the chronic disease burden associated with diabetes
and its complications. Our main policy simulations estimate that the SSB tax alone could pre-
vent 189,300 cases of diabetes and save about 983 million international dollars in direct health-
care costs attributable to diabetes over the time period 2013–2022, with the overwhelming
majority of the benefit occurringamong adults under the age of 55 y. Because of the high con-
sumption of SSBs and prevalence of obesity, as well as the young population structure, Mexico
can expect a 2.6-fold larger diabetes rate reduction compared to simulations of SSB taxation in
the United States using nearly identical assumptions over the same timeframe [39,40]. In addi-
tion to a reduction in diabetes incidence, we also observedreductions in CVD events and
deaths with SSB tax simulations, with the reduced burden again occurringmost prominently
among the younger age groups. Preventing new cases of diabetes and CVD among young Mex-
icans will yield substantial additional benefits over a life course, as measured by years of life
lived free of these chronic conditions; these health benefits are not fully captured by our 10-y
simulations and highlight that our estimates are likely a conservative description of the true
health benefits of this intervention. Comparisons of similar policy strategies in different popu-
lation contexts highlight the importance of understanding the demographics and epidemiology
of a particular population when choosing a public health strategy for maximal impact. This
comparison also underscores the large anticipated health benefits from policies aimed at obe-
sity and diabetes in Mexico, where the obesity and diabetes epidemic is particularly striking.
Our estimates are likely conservative. We modeled the impact of reduced SSB consumption
for those 35 y of age and older due to limitations in epidemiologic data for CVD for those of
younger ages. Given the high consumption of SSBs and prevalence of obesity in children and

 young adults [1,2], a larger impact might be expected as the younger generation ages. While
our estimate of non-CVD deaths captured deaths from diabetes-related complications like
renal disease, we did not capture changes in event rates for diabetic nephropathy and end-stage
renal disease. These complications may be particularly common in Mexico and represent addi-
tional health burdens that may improve with reduced SSB consumption.
For calculations of healthcare costs, we included direct costs of hospital days and outpatient
consultations for those with diabetes and estimated the savings that can be expected over the
10 y following intervention. Due to data limitations, we did not take into consideration the

 incremental savings from preventing CHD, stroke events, chronic kidney disease, or other con-
ditions not captured in hospital records under diabetes codes. This likely resulted in substantial
underestimation of savings, given that CVD and chronic kidney disease currently rank among
the most prominent contributors to financial burden and causes of mortality in Mexico
[46,47]. We also did not measure the savings that would result from the reduced need for
healthcare infrastructure to deliver prevention and management servicesfor diabetes and asso-
ciated complications. Others have reported on the inadequacy of the current Mexican health-
care system to address the rising rate of diabetes, citing low rates of screening and limited
capacity for chronic disease management [48]. In addition to the direct economic benefits we
project in our modeling, the SSB tax might be expected to yield indirect cost savings associated
with having a healthier workforce and reduced out-of-pocket expenditures absorbed by indi-
vidual households [49,50]. Prior research suggests that indirect social and productivity costs
could represent between 52% and 55% of the total cost of diabetes and CVD [8,49,51]. Finally,
we included only revenue associated with reductions in healthcare utilization, while the reve-
nue generated by the tax itself was not considered. Tax revenue that is invested in additional
efforts to reduce diabetes risk would be expected to additionally increase the health benefits
modeled here. Indeed, the Mexican government has planned to allocate a portion of SSB tax
revenue to programs aimed at preventing and controlling diabetes as well as programs aimed
at increasing access to drinkable water in schools and public spaces (including installation and
maintenance of drinking water fountains) and decreasing undernutrition [52,53], which could
magnify the health benefits describedhere.
The 10% SSB tax is the cornerstone of Mexico’s National Strategy for the Prevention and Con-
trol of Overweight,Obesity, and Diabetes. Though our findings suggest that the tax could bring
considerable health and economic benefits, large and sustained declines in SSB consumption will
likely require a combination of strategies including mass media campaigns, healthy food con-
sumption subsides, nutritional labeling, and marketing restrictions, in addition to taxation [54].
The Mexican government has implemented other initiatives that could enhance the effects of the
tax, including school-basedguidelines for servinghealthy foods and beverages,mandatory front-
of-package labeling, and regulations around marketing foods and beverages to children [43]. We
chose to focus on the SSB tax because it is a national policy of global interest and has a sufficient
research base to define its effects on consumption and health. We conducted additional simula-
tions reflectingdeclines in consumption larger than those expectedfrom the current tax in order
to understand what might be achieved from additional public health interventions.
The strengths of our projections include the use of a validated CVD simulation model
adapted to describe the population of Mexico, using multiple Mexican national data sources to
define inputs on SSB consumption and post-tax change in SSB consumption and the occur-
rence of diabetes and CVD outcomes. However, the study has several limitations. We defined
SSBs according to methods developed by the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 [55]. It is
possible to include or exclude other beverages in this group, and misclassification could have
led us to over- or underestimate average pre-tax SSB consumption in Mexican adults [1,2]. SSB
consumption is based primarily on self-report, a measure that has been shown by others to
likely underestimate consumption, again supporting the likely conservative nature of our esti-
mates of potential health benefits. For our main simulations, we assumed that consumers
reducing their consumption of SSBs would replace 39% of SSB calories with calories from
other beverage types, but this assumption was based on reports from the US and may not apply
equally in the Mexican population. Nonetheless, we tested the sensitivity of our finding and
still found an important health benefit when varying the percentage of caloric compensation
from other beverages and, importantly, found significant health benefits even under the
assumption that all of the calories from SSB consumption are replaced. Only one elasticity

 parameter linking taxation with downstream effects on consumption was considered, an assump-
tion that was validated by Mexican market research surveys [11]. However, as the same study
showed, price elasticity varies by socioeconomicstatus and geographic location, with larger
reductions in purchasing among poorer households [11]. The average effect we report here is
likely to be heterogeneous across population subgroups, with greater effects in cities and among
poor individuals. Importantly, while lower-income populations may bear a disproportionate bur-
den from taxation, they are also likely to accrue the health and economic benefits from preven-
tion of diabetes and CVD [11]. Finally, we model theoretical reductions in consumption based
on taxation; one industry-fundedstudy—limited by the generalizability of the study sample and
interpretation of results—reported minimal impact of the SSB tax in Mexico [56], but a larger
study reporting on a representative population in Mexico found substantial reductions in pur-
chases following the initiation of the tax that are compatible with the effects we model here [11].
In conclusion, our findings suggest that Mexico’s SSB tax has the potential to substantially
cut back SSB consumption, reducing downstream diabetes and CVD morbidity and mortality.
Healthcare savings resulting from reduced SSB consumption could be reallocated toward other
public health promotion programs and toward the augmentation of personnel and infrastruc-
ture to improve care for diabetes, CVD, and other diseases.
