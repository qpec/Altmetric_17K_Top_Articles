BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have attempted to identify the 
association between multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplementation 
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, but the benefits remain 
controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the 
associations between MVM supplementation and various CVD outcomes, 
including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a comprehensive search 
of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published 
between January 1970 and August 2016. We included clinical trials 
and prospective cohort studies in the general population evaluating 
associations between MVM supplementation and CVD outcomes. Data 
extraction and quality assessment were independently conducted by 
2 authors, and a third author resolved discrepancies. Eighteen studies 
with 2 
019 
862 participants and 18 
363 
326 person-years of follow-up 
were included in the analysis. Five studies specified the dose/type of 
MVM supplement and the rest did not. Overall, there was no association 
between MVM supplementation and CVD mortality (relative risk [RR], 
1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97–1.04), CHD mortality (RR, 1.02; 
95% CI, 0.92–1.13), stroke mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82–1.09), or 
stroke incidence (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.05). There was no association 
between MVM supplements and CVD or CHD mortality in prespecified 
subgroups categorized by mean follow-up period, mean age, period of 
MVM use, sex, type of population, exclusion of patients with history of 
CHD, and adjustment for diet, adjustment for smoking, adjustment for 
physical activity, and study site. In contrast, MVM use did seem to be 
associated with a lower risk of CHD incidence (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79–
0.97). However, this association did not remain significant in the pooled 
subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trials (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 
0.80–1.19).
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort 
studies demonstrates that MVM supplementation does not improve 
cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.

T
he use of multivitamin/mineral (MVM) dietary 
supplements is widespread in the United States 
and other developed countries.1,2 This is because 
of the popular belief that MVM supplements may help 
maintain and promote health by preventing various dis-
eases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD).3 Numer-
ous large-scale population-based studies and random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to 
identify the potential benefit of MVM supplementation 
in the general population, but the results have been 
equivocal.4–8 Several population studies have suggested 
that MVM use may be beneficial for certain cardiovas-
cular outcomes, but most other studies showed no sig-
nificant cardiovascular benefit.7,9
Based on the weak and controversial benefit of MVM 
supplements, the US Preventive Services Task Force and 
the National Institutes of Health recommend against 
the routine use of MVM supplements for the purpose 
of chronic disease prevention, including CVD.10,11 How-
ever, the prevalence of MVM supplementation in the 
general population remains high; for example, the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 
to 2012 data showed ≈30% of the population in the 
United States as using MVM supplements.1,12,13 Accord-
ing to projections from 1 financial report, the global 
nutritional supplement industry is expected to reach 
$278 billion USD by 2024.14
There have been multiple efforts to perform a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of the association 
between MVM supplementation and CVD outcomes. 
Most reviews and meta-analyses have focused on RCTs 
and investigated the association between various dietary 
supplements and chronic disease outcomes, includ-
ing cancer.15,16 Those studies have found insufficient 
evidence to support the routine use of MVM supple-
ments, but specific CVD outcomes, such as incidence of 
coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke mortality, were 
not assessed.15,16 In this article, we hypothesized that 
there is a null association between MVM supplement 
use and multiple cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed 
to perform a comprehensive systematic review and 
meta-analysis by pooling the evidence from prospective 
cohort studies and clinical trials on the association of 
MVM supplement use and specific CVD outcomes.
METHODS
Data Sources and Searches
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will be avail-
able on request for purposes of reproducing the results or 
replicating the procedure. We performed a systematic search 
of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials database without language restrictions 
between January 1970 and August 2016. Additional relevant 
studies were retrieved by bibliography review of selected arti-
cles and manual search. Details of search terms and strategy 
are provided in Appendix I in the Data Supplement. This study 
only used data available in published studies and was exempt 
from approval by the University of Alabama at Birmingham 
Institutional Review Board.
Eligibility Criteria
Studies satisfying the following eligibility criteria were selected 
for final review: (1) RCTs and prospective cohort studies inves-
tigating MVM supplementation. Other observational studies, 
such as case series or case-control studies were excluded; (2) 
studies involving ambulatory adults in the community with-
out a disabling condition. Studies only targeting a population 
with specific conditions, such as prior myocardial infarction or 
certain vitamin deficiencies, were excluded; (3) studies report-
ing the adjusted relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular outcomes, 
including cardiovascular mortality, CHD mortality, stroke mor-
tality, incidence of CHD, and incidence of stroke; and (4) stud-
ies meeting the predefined high-quality assessment criteria.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators (J. Choi and S.Y. Kwon) independently 
performed eligible study selection and data extraction. Any 
disagreements were resolved through discussion with a 
third investigator (J. Kim). Data of interest extracted from 
the selected papers included study name (first author and 
year of publication), design, site, characteristics, population, 
outcome, definition of MVM, frequency and duration of 
MVM supplementation, exposure and follow-up assessment 
method, RR with 95% confidence interval (CI), and adjust-
ment for known cardiovascular risk factors.
We evaluated the methodological quality of the included 
RCTs as good, fair, or poor based on the US Preventive 
Services Task Force quality assessment criteria.16,17 The quality 
of prospective cohort studies was evaluated by the prespeci-
fied assessment tool described by Proper et al.18 This tool was 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• The prevalence of multivitamin/mineral supple-
ment use is high in the United States and other 
developed countries.
• Most studies have demonstrated a net neutral 
effect of multivitamin/mineral supplements in car-
diovascular health, but several studies have sug-
gested possible benefit in certain cardiovascular 
outcomes.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• In this systematic meta-analysis of 18 prospective 
cohort studies and randomized controlled trials, 
there was no benefit of multivitamin/mineral sup-
plements on cardiovascular disease prevention in 
the general population.
• Our study supports present guidelines that rec-
ommend against the routine use of multivitamin/
mineral supplements to promote cardiovascular 
health.

validated to evaluate the methodological quality of prospec-
tive cohort studies.18–21 Appendix II in the Data Supplement 
presents further details of the assessment criteria. A study 
was considered high quality if the score based on the validity/
precision criteria was ≥7 of 9.18 We followed the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
guidelines for the meta-analysis of observational studies.
Definition of MVM Use and 
Cardiovascular Outcome
The types and doses of MVM in each study are summarized 
in Table 1. The definition of MVM varied among included 
studies. In this analysis, we followed the National Institutes 
of Health definition, which defined MVM as dietary supple-
ments comprising >3 vitamin and mineral ingredients.10 
Supplements containing herbs, hormones, or drugs were 
excluded from the analysis. We included studies that assessed 
MVM supplement use by a questionnaire or in a follow-up 
office visit. If multiple cardiovascular outcomes were reported 
based on the intensity of MVM use (frequency, duration, or 
number of pills), the result with more intense usage was used 
for the meta-analysis. Multiple cardiovascular outcomes were 
assessed in our meta-analysis. CVD mortality included CHD 
mortality and stroke mortality. Incident CHD events were 
defined as cardiac revascularization and fatal and nonfatal 
myocardial infarction. Incident stroke included fatal and non-
fatal stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis
The analyses of RCT studies were conducted according to the 
intention-to-treat principle. Cohort studies were typically ana-
lyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, and we used 
the hazard ratio and 95% CI from the analytic model adjusted 
for most covariates in each cohort. We pooled RRs and hazard 
ratios of each cardiovascular outcome for MVM users com-
pared with nonusers (we refer to RRs and hazard ratios gener-
ically as RRs in this article). Analyses were conducted under 
the assumption of a common effect across subgroups within 
each study, whereas the true effect could vary across stud-
ies. For studies that only reported the RRs in subgroups (men 
and women in the study by Watkins et al,5 Park et al,30 and 
Iso et al25), we first computed a weighted RR and SE for each 
study using a fixed effects model using the inverse-variance 
approach. Then, we calculated summary RRs across studies 
using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models based on 
log-transformed RRs (metan command in Stata).35
We used univariable meta-regression with restricted maxi-
mum likelihood estimates of between study variance (metareg 
command in Stata) to evaluate whether results were different 
by MVM use (≤5 and >5 years), follow-up period (≤10 and 
>10 years), sex (men and women), mean age (≤60 and >60 
years), population characteristics (healthcare professional and 
nonhealthcare professional), adjustment for vegetable and 
fruit intake, adjustment for smoking, adjustment for physical 
activity, study design (RCTs and prospective cohort studies), 
and study site (United States and others).36
Influence analysis was performed to examine the influence 
of individual studies on the pooled meta-analysis outcome. 
Each study was sequentially excluded from the analysis, and 
a sensitivity plot was created.37 Heterogeneity was quantified 
with the Higgins I2 statistic, which describes the proportion of 
total variation in pooled estimates because of heterogeneity.38 
Begg funnel plot and Egger test were used to evaluate the 
potential bias of publication.39,40 A P value <0.05 was used as 
the threshold for statistical significance. All statistical analyses 
were conducted using Stata statistical software package, ver-
sion 12.0 (2011; StataCorp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Study Selection
A flowchart of the study selection for meta-analysis is 
presented in Figure 1. Initial literature search retrieved 
a total of 3249 articles after removal of duplicated arti-
cles. An additional article was identified through man-
ual search.29 After title and abstract review, 25 studies 
remained for full-text manuscript review. Among these, 
6 studies did not meet the inclusion criteria and were 
excluded.23,30,41–44 One study met the inclusion criteria, 
but the population was duplicated in another study; 
therefore, the study with the longer follow-up data was 
selected for final analysis.45 As a result, 18 studies were 
included in the final analysis.
Study Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the 18 
studies included in the final analysis. A total of 2 
019 
862 
participants were included with a range between 8678 
and 1 
063 
023 participants per each study. The mean 
age of participants was 57.8 years. Eleven studies were 
from the United States, 4 were from Europe, and 3 were 
from Japan. The duration of follow-up varied from 5 to 
19.1 years, with a mean follow-up period of 11.6 years. 
Multiple studies reported >1 cardiovascular outcome, 
including CVD mortality (10 studies), CHD mortality (7 
studies), stroke mortality (4 studies), CHD incidence (8 
studies), and stroke incidence (4 studies).
All included studies targeted the general popula-
tion, and 4 studies investigated a healthcare profes-
sional population specifically. Ten studies excluded sub-
jects with a history of CVD, whereas 8 studies did not. 
One study excluded subjects who had medical condi-
tions with a predicted survival of <3 years.6 Five studies 
reported the type and ingredients of the MVM, where-
as the rest of studies did not specify them. All includ-
ed RCTs tested a single-formulation MVM, whereas 
cohort studies tested a broader range of MVM supple-
ments available in the market. Exposure in the cohort 
studies was assessed by a questionnaire or a follow-up 
office visit.
All of the included authors reported RRs adjusted for 
possible confounding factors, except Iso et al,25 who 
reported RRs adjusted only for age and sex. Ten stud-

Effect of MVM Supplementation on Risk 
of CVD, CHD, and Stroke Mortality
Figure 2 demonstrates the forest plot of RRs (95% CI) 
of the association between MVM supplementation and 
risk of CVD, CHD, and stroke mortality.
Ten studies reported CVD mortality as an outcome 
with a pooled sample of 616 970 participants. Meta-
analysis of those studies revealed that MVM supple-
ment use was not associated with the risk of CVD 
death (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.04). There was no 
evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I2=4.9%; 
Cochrane Q statistic, P=0.39) or publication bias (Begg 
test, P=0.28; Egger test, P=0.053; Figure IA in the Data 
Supplement).
Seven studies with a total of 1 
281 
865 participants 
examined the association between MVM use and CHD 
mortality. The use of MVM supplements was not associ-
ated with the risk of CHD mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 
0.92–1.13). There was little evidence of heterogeneity 
across comparatives, (I2=21.9%; Cochrane Q statistic, 
P=0.26), and no publication bias was found (Begg test, 
P=0.99; Egger test, P=0.52; Figure IB in the Data Sup-
plement).
Four studies involving 1 
255 
473 participants inves-
tigated stroke mortality as an outcome. Across all the 
pooled studies, there was no evidence of an associa-
tion between the use of MVM supplements and the 
risk of stroke mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82–1.09). 
There was significant heterogeneity between compara-
tives (I2=61.8%; Cochrane Q statistic, P=0.049) and no 
publication bias (Begg test, P=0.73; Egger test, P=0.75; 
Figure IC in the Data Supplement).
Effect of MVM Supplementation on Risk 
of CHD and Stroke Incidence
Eight cohort studies with 397 
743 participants exam-
ined the association between MVM supplement use 
and the risk of incident CHD in the ambulatory popula-
tion without a fatal underlying condition (Figure 2).
The pooled analysis demonstrated that subjects 
who use MVM supplements had a reduced risk of inci-
dent CHD (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79–0.97). There was 
evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies 
(I2=55.8%; Cochrane Q statistic, P=0.027), but no pub-
lication bias was detected (Begg test, P=0.71; Egger 
test, P=0.33; Figure ID in the Data Supplement).
Meta-analysis of 4 studies comprising 236 
059 par-
ticipants reporting stroke events as an outcome showed 
that MVM supplementation was not related to stroke 
incidence (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.05). There was no 
evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies 
(I2=0.0%; Cochrane Q statistic, P=0.95), and no pub-
lication bias was observed (Begg test, P=0.73; Egger 
test, P=0.78; Figure IE in the Data Supplement).
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses
Table 2 demonstrates the results of subgroup and inter-
action analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed 
based on mean follow-up period (≤10 and >10 years), 
period of MVM use (≤5 and >5 years), mean age (≤60 
and >60 years), sex, type of population, exclusion of 
individuals with history of CHD, adjustment for fruit 
and vegetable intake, adjustment for smoking, adjust-
ment for physical activity, study design, and study site. 
Overall, there was no association between MVM sup-
plementation and risk of CVD or CHD mortality in all 
subgroups. A significant interaction for CHD mortality 
was observed based on the adjustment for fruit and 
vegetable intake (interaction P=0.02) and adjustment

for physical activity (interaction P=0.02), but no other 
interaction was observed.
The lower risk of CHD incidence with MVM supple-
mentation was observed in studies that did not adjust 
for vegetable and fruit intake (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.68–0.88). The association did not exist in studies that 
adjusted for diet (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82–1.01; interac-
tion P=0.01). A subgroup analysis of studies conducted 
in countries other than the United States demonstrat-
ed an association between MVM supplement use and 
lower risk of CHD (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62–0.89). Stud-
ies conducted in the United States did not have this

DISCUSSION
Our meta-analysis of 18 studies involving 2 
019 
862 
participants demonstrated no association between 
MVM supplementation and risk of CVD, CHD, or stroke 
mortality. MVM supplements were associated with a 
slightly lower risk of CHD incidence in the overall analy-
sis, but no association was found with stroke incidence.
Studies have not demonstrated improved cardio-
vascular outcomes in the general population with a 
therapeutic supplementation of deficient vitamins, 
such as vitamin D.46 Even sparser is the evidence of 
cardiovascular benefit in the general population with-
out a confirmed vitamin deficiency, other than possible 
theoretical benefits suggested in in vitro studies.47,48 
Furthermore, several studies demonstrated that routine 
vitamin and mineral supplementation in certain popu-
lations, for instance in elderly patients, could lead to a 
worse outcome.49–51 Our finding supports the hypoth-
esis that the net effect of MVM supplementation in the 
general population for CVD prevention is neutral.
In our study, MVM supplement use was inversely 
related to the incidence of CHD when all studies were 
considered. However, this association was demonstrat-
ed only in cohort studies and not when subgroup analy-
sis was performed on RCTs. There was significant het-
erogeneity among the cohort studies (I2=67.5%) but 
no substantial heterogeneity among RCTs (I2=0.0%). 
All included RCTs tested a uniform dose and ingredient 
of MVM, but most cohort studies did not specify the 
type and dose because use was assessed by self-report. 
Therefore, the marginal benefit of MVM use on CHD 
incidence seen in the overall outcome is likely because 
of the inherited limitations of prospective cohort stud-
ies, including residual confounding factors and inability 
to identify causation.
It is unclear why MVM supplement use was associ-
ated with lower risk of CHD incidence in studies done 
outside of the United States, whereas no benefit was 
found among studies performed in the United States. 
Nutritional studies have established that fruits and veg-
etables are a good source of many vitamins and are 
associated with a lower risk of stroke and CHD, with 
a strong dose-response relationship.52,53 On the con-
trary, multivitamin supplements have not been shown 
to improve CVD outcomes, regardless of the baseline 
nutritional status.54 A report from the Centers for Dis-

ease Control and Prevention revealed that 87% of the 
population in the United States do not meet the fruit 
and vegetable intake recommendations.55 Multiple 
studies have shown that MVM supplement users also 
have higher intake of vitamins and minerals from their 
diet compared with nonusers.56,57 It can be postulated 
that the marginal inverse association with CHD inci-
dence seen in the studies done outside of the United 
States is because of the more unmeasured confounding 
variables in non-US studies and not because of regional 
benefits of MVM supplementation.
Our study has multiple strengths, including the large 
size of meta-analysis (>2 million participants included), 
with long-term follow-up (average 12 years), rigor-
ous statistical methods examining for heterogeneity 
across studies, examination of associations of MVM 
for specific CVD outcomes, and examination of asso-
ciations among many different subgroup populations. 
We undertook this analysis because, despite numerous 
studies strongly suggesting the neutral effect of MVM 
supplements on CVD prevention, the controversy did 
not end, and the scientific community continued to 
send a confusing signal to the public.58 A fundamen-
tal benefit of meta-analysis is its ability to evaluate the 
body of evidence by combining the results from previ-
ously published studies. This helps to avoid making pre-
emptive conclusions based on a few papers that may 
have type 1 error because of multiple testing and mis-
guided result interpretation. Our findings will hopefully 
serve to dampen the widespread public enthusiasm for 
MVM use by conclusively showing null effects.
Nonetheless, there are potential limitations in this 
study. First, the MVM supplement formulation and dose 
were not uniform in the included studies. Only 5 studies 
specified the dose and type of MVM supplements. This 
lack of standardization reflects the real-world situation. 
The Food and Drug Administration does not review 
MVM supplements before they are marketed, and there 
is a wide variety of MVM supplements available in the 
market.59 Two RCTs included in the analysis tested uni-
form MVM formulas, and the meta-analysis outcome 
of those studies matched the overall negative out-
come. Second, most of the included studies assessed 
the use of MVM supplements by questionnaires and 
were unable to assess the frequency, dose, and compli-
ance accurately. We attempted to perform a subgroup 
analysis of those who used MVM supplements more 
frequently but were unable to do so because of the 
lack of specific data. Third, prospective cohort studies 
were included in the main analysis, which are not free 
of potential confounding biases. However, most of the 
included studies adjusted for major cardiovascular risk 
factors, and our vigorous sensitivity analysis and sub-
group analysis demonstrated a consistent neutral effect 
of MVM supplements on CVD outcomes. Moreover, 
inclusion of the RCTs did not alter the overall outcome.
In conclusion, our comprehensive meta-analysis 
demonstrates that MVM supplement use does not 
improve cardiovascular outcomes. Our study supports 
current professional guidelines that recommend against 
the routine use of MVM supplements for the purpose 
of CVD prevention in the general population.
