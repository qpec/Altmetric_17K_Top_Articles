T
he Wittenoom Gorge in the Hamersley 
Ranges of the remote Pilbara region of 
Western Australia (WA) is about 1,600 
kilometres north-east of Perth. The area is well 
known for the mining of asbestos in the past: 
blue asbestos (crocidolite) was mined and 
milled there by the Australian Blue Asbestos 
Company (ABA) between 1943 and 1966 (and 
earlier in nearby Yampire Gorge). Nearly 7,000 
people, mostly men, worked at the mine 
and mill during this time. More than 300 of 
these former workers have died of malignant 
mesothelioma (MM) and many more have 
developed or died of other asbestos-related 
diseases (ARDs).1,2 The Wittenoom mining 
operation has been classified as a “modern 
industrial disaster”
.3
The town of Wittenoom was about 12 km 
from the mill and was heavily contaminated 
with asbestos tailings, which were used 
extensively for dust suppression in backyards, 
driveways and roads, on the racetrack and 
in the school playground. Exposure to 
asbestos in the town has been responsible 
for many cases of MM and other ARDs among 
people who did not work for the asbestos 
company.4,5 The township of Wittenoom was 
de-gazetted in 2006 and the areas around 
the mine and town-site were classified as 
contaminated sites, not suitable for any 
form of human occupation or land use.6 
Measurements and estimates of dustiness 
of the mine and mill and in the town during 
the period of operation of the industry and 
subsequently have revealed significant 
ongoing contamination.7,8 Furthermore, raw 
asbestos was transported more than 300 km 
from the mill by road to the nearest port, 
contaminating towns such as Roebourne – 
where the asbestos was temporarily stored 
– and Point Samson and Port Hedland, from 
where it was shipped to Perth.
The township of Wittenoom and associated 
mined and contaminated zones lie in 
traditional Banyjima (the local Aboriginal 
people) country and was inhabited by 
these people for tens of thousands of 
years.9 The Wittenoom and Yampire Gorges 
were significant cultural centres due to the 
permanent water supplies, availability of 
game and high number of cultural sites.9 
Despite the mining activity and subsequent 
contamination, the area around Wittenoom 
remains important to the Banyjima 
people, who continue to visit the gorge for 
swimming, fishing, cooking and cultural 
purposes.9 Aboriginal people lived in and 
around the town of Wittenoom, while it

Abstract
Objectives: To describe the incidence of malignant mesothelioma (MM) in Aboriginal people 
in Western Australia (WA) and determine the main routes of exposure to asbestos in this 
population.
Methods: All MM cases in Western Australia, as well as the primary source of asbestos exposure, 
are recorded in the WA Mesothelioma Register. Aboriginal cases up to the end of 2013 were 
extracted from the register and compared with non-Aboriginal cases with respect to the 
primary means/source of exposure. Age-standardised incidence rates for each decade from 
1980 were calculated for both Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals. Age-standardised mortality 
rates were calculated for the period 1994–2008 and compared with international rates.
Results: There were 39 cases (77% male) of MM among WA Aboriginal people. Twenty-six 
(67%) were a direct result of the mining of crocidolite at Wittenoom and the subsequent 
contamination of the surrounding lands. Of the non-Aboriginal MM cases (n = 2070, 86.3% 
male), fewer than 25% can be attributed to Wittenoom. Aboriginals had consistently higher 
10-year incidence rates than non-Aboriginals and, when compared to world populations, the 
highest mortality rate internationally. 
Conclusion: When incidence rates in Aboriginal people are compared with non-Aboriginal 
people, the Wittenoom mining operation has had a disproportionate effect on MM incidence in 
the local Aboriginal population.

existed, and although there were no official 
records of Aboriginal employment in the 
asbestos mining operations, it is well known 
that they did work in the mine and mill10,11 as 
well as in the transport of raw asbestos from 
the mill to the coast.11,12 
By 1995, there had been 12 cases of MM 
documented among WA Aboriginal people. 
All had lived or worked in the Pilbara region.13 
A crude incidence rate of 250 per million 
person-years was estimated, which was 5 to 
10 times higher than any other population-
based rate at the time. This was estimated 
using only the Pilbara Aboriginal population, 
which constitutes about 10% of the entire WA 
Aboriginal population, because all cases were 
considered to be from that area. The aim of 
the current study was to update the number 
of cases and the incidence rates of MM in the 
WA Aboriginal population and assess their 
main routes of exposure. 
Methods
Cases
All cases of MM since the first case in 1960 are 
recorded in the WA Mesothelioma Register. 
Every case has been reviewed at regular 
meetings of the WA Mesothelioma Register 
Committee (WAMRC), whose members are an 
expert pathologist, an occupational physician, 
a respiratory physician, an epidemiologist, 
the Principal Medical Officer of the WA 
Cancer Registry and a research officer. The 
WA Mesothelioma Register entry for each 
case includes age, sex, date and methods 
of diagnosis, histological subtype, site of 
disease, date of death and available history 
of asbestos exposure. Aboriginality is also 
recorded. The written report of the diagnostic 
pathologist responsible for the cytological 
or histopathological diagnosis of each case 
is reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and, 
in difficult cases, the original diagnostic 
material is reviewed by the Register’s expert 
pathologist, together with clinical and 
radiological information. 
Classification of exposure
The method of assessing the main source 
of asbestos exposure of this population 
has been previously reported.9 Exposure 
information has been collected from a 
self-reported questionnaire (up to 1980), 
clinical notes, doctors’ letters and advocacy 
groups. All available information is bought 
together in the WA Mesothelioma Register 
and each case is reviewed by the WAMRC 
to classify the most significant source of 
asbestos exposure. There are 29 exposure 
classifications (22 occupational, five non-
occupational, plus ‘known no exposure’ 
and ‘unknown’ exposures). Occupational 
categories include, among others, asbestos 
mining, asbestos transport, building and 
construction, plumbing and electrical 
work. The codes assigned are, in principle, 
independent of each person’s ‘main’ lifetime 
occupation. Among the non-occupational 
exposure categories are former Wittenoom 
residents, visitors to Wittenoom and home 
renovators. ‘Known no exposure’ is coded if 
the person has been intensively questioned, 
but no source of exposure to asbestos can be 
identified. ‘Unknown’ exposure is coded if the 
person has not been adequately questioned, 
or there is insufficient detail in the exposure 
history. If there has been more than one 
source of asbestos exposure, the committee 
considers the most significant exposure 
for classification, taking account of when 
the exposure occurred, and the amount of 
exposure involved. For example, occupational 
exposure would usually be considered more 
significant than non-occupational exposure. 
Due to the potency of crocidolite for MM and 
the high exposures at both the Wittenoom 
mine and town site, exposure at Wittenoom 
– either as a former worker or ex-resident 
– is usually considered the most significant 
exposure. 
Statistical analyses
Differences between Aboriginal and non-
Aboriginal cases for sex, age at diagnosis, age 
at first exposure to asbestos, MM site (right 
or left pleura, peritoneal, other), histological 
subtype and exposure categories were 
assessed using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square 
tests of statistical significance, as appropriate. 
For internal comparisons, i.e. WA Aboriginal 
and non-Aboriginal cases, directly age-
standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) were 
calculated. For MM, incidence and mortality 
rates are similar, as MM is a universally 
fatal disease with a short survival time. 
However, incidence rates were used as at 
any one time there will be more incident 
cases than deaths. Furthermore, there is 
more diagnostic certainty for incidence 
than mortality. Age-standardised IRs were 
calculated separately for Aboriginal and non-
Aboriginal cases using the 2001 Australian 
population data.14 Due to the small numbers 
for the Aboriginal population, ASIRs were 
calculated over 10-year periods, commencing 
in 1980 (there were only two Aboriginal 
cases in the 1970s) up until 2013. Rates were 
calculated for all cases (males and females 
combined) and males only. Population data, 
for denominators, were obtained from the 
Epidemiology Branch of the WA Department 
of Health, where estimates of the sizes of the 
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations, 
based on census data, were available from 
1983 to 2011. Person-years (py) for the years 
1980 to 1982 were based on the population 
in 1983. Person-years for 2012 and 2013 were 
based on the population in 2011. 
International age-standardised mortality 
rates (ASMRs) for mesothelioma for the 
period between 1994 and 2008 have 
been published.15 For comparison with 
these data, ASMRs for both Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal people, male and female 
combined, for the same period (1994–2008) 
were calculated. To be consistent with the 
published data15 ASMRs were calculated 
using the 2000 World Standard population.16 
Results
Up to the end of 2013, there had been 2,124 
registered MM cases in WA: 2,070 cases were 
non-Aboriginal, 39 cases were Aboriginal 
and racial status was unknown for 15 cases 
(Table 1). The first Aboriginal MM case was 
diagnosed in 1975. Of the 39 cases, 36 were 
pleural MM and three were peritoneal MM, 
which is a similar proportion to the non-
Aboriginal group. There were also similar 
proportions of the various histological MM 
subtypes (epithelioid, sarcomatoid and 
biphasic) in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal 
patients. There were relatively more MM 
cases for Aboriginal women than for non-
Aboriginal women (23.0 v 13.7%), but this 
was not statistically significant (p=0.10). 
Aboriginals were significantly younger than 
non-Aboriginals at diagnosis and at age of 
first exposure. 
Twenty-six of the 39 Aboriginal MM 
cases could be directly related to the 
Wittenoom mining operations (five mine 
and mill workers, 12 transport workers, five 
Wittenoom residents and four Wittenoom 
visitors). A further three (with unknown 
exposure) resided in the Pilbara region at 
time of diagnosis. There were proportionally 
more MM cases from non-occupational 
exposures in Aboriginal people compared 
with non-Aboriginal people (28.0% v 13.9%, 
p=0.02), see Table 2. Most (9/11; 81.8%) 
non-occupational exposures for Aboriginal 
people were a result of living in, or visiting

fibres (30.7% and 4.7%, respectively). The 
most common occupational exposure for 
non-Aboriginal people was in building and 
construction (17.7%), but this only accounted 
for 7.7% of Aboriginal cases.
In most decades, Aboriginals had higher 
age-standardised incidence rates than non-
Aboriginals (Table 3). When compared with 
international mortality rates for the period of 
1994–2008,15 WA Aboriginals had the highest 
rate, more than double the rate of the UK, 
which had the highest country-rate (Table 4). 
Discussion
There have been 39 recorded cases of MM in 
WA Aboriginal people since the mid-1970s 
and most were exposed to asbestos when 
living or working in and around Wittenoom, 
Roebourne and Port Samson. Incidence 
and mortality rates for MM in WA Aboriginal 
people are considerably higher than rates 
in international populations. For most (67%) 
of the Aboriginal cases, asbestos exposure 
was due to the mining of crocidolite at 
Wittenoom, either working at the mine or as 
a result of contamination of the surrounding 
lands. As Aboriginal people still regularly 
visit the Wittenoom area, the risk of further 
exposure and future cases continues.
The age-standardised incidence rates for 
WA Aboriginal people tended to be higher 
than those of WA non-Aboriginal people 
when compared over 10-year periods but, 
due to the small number of Aboriginal 
cases, differences between the two groups 
have varied considerably over the decades. 
When compared with international data 
over an extended period of time, the MM 
mortality rate in WA Aboriginal people 
was considerably higher than all other 
populations. There is no known biological 
reason why Aboriginal people would be 
more susceptible to asbestos, although 
heterogeneity in risk of other cancers 
(such as lung) is recognised with different 
ethnicities.17 The most likely reason for the 
higher incidence/mortality rates is that 
the predominant asbestos exposure for 
WA Aboriginals, both occupationally and 
non-occupationally, has been to crocidolite 
– the most potent asbestos fibre type for 
MM causation.18 For Aboriginals, 74% and 
82% of occupational and non-occupational 
cases, respectively, were associated with the 
Wittenoom mining operations, compared 
with 22% and 31%, respectively, for non-
Aboriginal cases.
There are no official records of Aboriginal 
workers in the Wittenoom mining operations, 
but there is documented evidence that they 
did work there and were more likely to be 
given lower-paid jobs and jobs involving

dusty conditions.11,12,19 One of the lowest 
paid jobs was the loading of crocidolite for 
transport from the mine to the nearby ports, 
either Point Samson or Port Hedland, which 
are more than 300 km from Wittenoom.11,12 
There was a considerably larger proportion 
of occupational exposures among Aboriginal 
cases due to transport and loading of raw 
asbestos, consistent with the anecdotal 
evidence.11,12 Throughout the life of the 
Wittenoom operation, the asbestos was 
transported in bags made from jute fibre, 
even though their use had been prohibited 
for asbestos transport elsewhere as early as 
1931 because of the levels of asbestos dust 
released.20 
The high proportion of Aboriginal cases 
associated with the Wittenoom mining 
operations may also be due to under-
representation of Aboriginal people in other 
asbestos-related occupations. For non-
Aboriginal cases, occupational exposures 
other than mining, milling or transport of 
raw asbestos accounted for 57% of all cases, 
while only six (15%) of the Aboriginal cases 
had an occupational exposure category other 
than asbestos mining, milling or transport. 
Aboriginals have had, and continue to have, 
high levels of unemployment; often four to 
six times higher than the non-Aboriginal 
population.21 Furthermore, up until the 
late 1960s – before Aboriginals were given 
citizenship rights – there were legislated 
restrictions on where Aboriginals could work, 
and they were largely employed during this 
time as indentured workers on the pastoral 
stations, in the pearling industry and in 
alluvial mining.10,22 
On average, Aboriginal cases of MM have 
been diagnosed at a significantly younger 
age than non-Aboriginal cases. There are two 
reasons that may account for this. Firstly, the 
average reported age at first exposure was 
significantly lower for Aboriginal people, 
particularly for women (although this was 
based on information for five cases only). This 
observation probably reflects the increased 
proportion of non-occupational exposures 
in the Aboriginal group who lived in 
contaminated locations. Secondly, Aboriginal 
people have a shorter life expectancy than 
the non-Aboriginal Australian population 
and may therefore die of other causes before 
developing or being diagnosed with MM – 
life expectancy of Aboriginal people is about 
11 years less than non-Aboriginal people 
due to circulatory, respiratory and metabolic 
diseases and neoplasms.23 Because MM is 
principally a disease of old age (by virtue of 
the latency and usual age of first exposure), 
the distributions of age at first exposure, 
age at diagnosis, and latency periods will 
be truncated at higher ages leading to 
lower averages than among the rest of the 
population. 
It is possible that not all cases of MM in 
Aboriginal people have been recorded 
because of the remoteness of residence of 
many Aboriginal people and limited access 
to medical facilities. The under-use of health 
services by Aborigines is a contributing cause 
of the health disparity between Aboriginal 
and non-Aboriginal Australians.24 Distance, 
cost and/or lack of culturally safe services are 
reasons why Aboriginal people may not use 
health services. Furthermore, there may be 
cases of MM in individuals, both Aboriginal 
and non-Aboriginal, who were exposed 
in WA but subsequently left the state and 
were diagnosed elsewhere. Due to the small 
number of Aboriginal cases, this would 
have a greater effect on Aboriginal than 
non-Aboriginal disease rates. It is possible, 
therefore, that the already high incidence 
and mortality rates for the WA Aboriginal 
population are under-estimated.
Calculating the incidence/mortality rates for 
the Aboriginal population may be inaccurate, 
as it is not known if Aboriginality is under- 
or over-reported in the census data.25 The 
number of people identifying as Aboriginal 
in the four censuses between 1986 and 
2001 rose at a rate far exceeding that of the 
total population, and far exceeding that 
expected from natural increase – most likely 
due to a general increased preparedness to 
identify as Indigenous.25 Furthermore, census 
collection in remote Aboriginal Australia 
is a complex cross-cultural exercise and 
interpretation of census categories can be 
difficult.26 The numbers used for this study 
were based on adjusted Australian Bureau 
of Statistics estimates following the 2011 
Census and represent the best possible 
estimates available.27 Similarly, reporting of 
Aboriginality of cases may not always have 
been accurate. Coding of Aboriginality in 
the Cancer Registry data relies principally 
on its capture in two settings: contact with 
publicly funded health services (whence 
it becomes available to the Registry via 
individual cancer-related hospital discharge 
records, or via individual search of the patient 
master index), and death registrations that 
are routinely linked to the Registry. At an 
individual level, it is not possible to determine 
the degree of correspondence between 
Aboriginality determined in these health/
mortality-related settings and that based on 
census information. The determination of 
Aboriginality in both these settings, however, 
is based on report either by the individual or 
relatives.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
determine the effect of misreporting 
of Aboriginality on ASIRs and ASMRs. 
There are very little data on the extent of 
misclassification of Aboriginal status in either 
census or hospital data. A 2001 WA Health 
Department study found that the number 
of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander 
(ATSI) people recorded in hospital inpatient 
data is an understatement of the number of 
ATSI people admitted as patients, on average 
by about 15%;28 a 15% under-reporting 
for either the census data or the cases 
for the sensitivity analyses was therefore 
used. For the ASIRs, the ranges for a 15% 
overestimation (under-reporting of census 
data) and underestimation (under-reporting 
of cases) were not large and were within the 
wide confidence intervals of the estimates. 
The adjusted 1994–2008 ASMR assuming 
15% under-estimation of the Aboriginal 
population (denominator) was 3.6/100,000 
and was still considerably larger than other 
international rates. 
The most significant source of asbestos 
exposure for each case is determined by the 
Mesothelioma Register Committee, which 
takes information from all available sources 
into account, including duration of various 
employment and residential situations. 
This may not reflect all possible sources of 
exposure and exposure types, and we cannot 
be certain that the assigned exposure route 
was the actual cause of the disease. However, 
there is no difference in the method of 
collection of evidence between Aboriginal 
and non-Aboriginal people.
The Wittenoom area is the largest (by 
surface area) asbestos-contaminated site 
in the Southern Hemisphere, covering an 
area of 46,840 hectares.6 In 1994, the WA 
Government determined that no systematic 
clean-up of the mine, town and surrounding 
areas would occur.8 The management of 
public health risks was – and remains – 
confined to raising awareness to limit access 
to the area. However, despite the widespread 
contamination, Aboriginal people today 
continue to use the area for recreational and 
ceremonial activities. A 2010 archaeological 
and anthropological report9 found that,

despite dislocation from the area due to 
the mining activities since the 1940s, the 
Banyjima people’s desire to reconnect and 
rejuvenate cultural connection to the area 
was overwhelmingly evident. The traditional 
owners still frequent the area and do not use 
personal protective equipment during their 
stay.9 The report indicates that ignorance of 
the degree of contamination and subsequent 
health effects has meant Aboriginal people 
have felt quite secure to continue to visit 
and use the area.9 In 2013, a government 
education campaign commenced to warn 
the local people of the dangers of visiting the 
area but, as yet, there has been no evaluation 
of the effectiveness of that campaign. 
The mining of blue asbestos in Wittenoom 
has been the major contributor to the high 
incidence rate of MM in WA Aboriginals. 
Unfortunately, further cases of MM in local 
Aboriginal people may develop because of 
historical exposure and ongoing access to 
highly contaminated lands.
