Abstract
Background: Women have higher rates of obesity than men and develop more pronounced
functional deficits as a result. Yet, little is known about how obesity reduction affects their
functional status, including whether their responses differ when protein intake is enhanced.
Objective: The aim of this study was to confirm the feasibility of delivery of a higher-protein
(balanced at each meal) calorie-restricted diet in obese women and determine its efficacy for
influencing function and retention of lean mass.
Method: Obese community-dwelling women [n = 80; body mass index (in kg/m2), in means 6 SDs:
37.8 6 5.9; aged 45–78 y; 58.8% white] were enrolled in a weight-loss (2500 kcal/d) study and
randomly assigned to either a Control–Weight-Loss (C-WL; 0.8 g protein/kg body weight) group
or a High-Protein–Weight-Loss (HP-WL; 1.2 g protein/kg body weight; 30 g protein 3 times/d)
group in a 1:2 allocation. Primary outcomes were function by 6-min walk test (6MWT) and lean
mass by using the BodPod (Life Measurement, Inc.) at 0, 4, and 6 mo.
Results: Both groups reduced calorie intakes and body weights (P , 0.001), and the feasibility of
the HP-WL intervention was confirmed. The 6MWT results improved (P , 0.01) at 4 mo in the
HP-WL group and at 6 mo in both groups (P , 0.001). Both groups improved function by several
other measures while slightly decreasing (P , 0.01) lean mass (21.0 kg, C-WL; 20.6 kg, HP-WL).
Weight loss was greater in white than in black women at both 4 mo (6.0 6 3.6 compared with
3.7 6 3.4 kg; P , 0.02) and 6 mo (7.2 6 4.8 compared with 4.0 6 4.7 kg; P , 0.04) and tended
to be positively related to age (P , 0.06).
Conclusions: A clinically important functional benefit of obesity reduction was confirmed in both
study groups, with no significant group effect. Our findings of racial differences in response to the
intervention and a potential influence of participant age lend support for further studies
sufficiently powered to explore the interaction of race and age with functional responses to
obesity reduction in women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02033655.

Introduction
The impact of obesity on physical function is keenly felt by women. Their obesity rates sur-
pass those of men at both middle (44.6% compared with 37.2%) and older (39.4% compared
with 37.5%) ages, and their susceptibility to obesity-related functional impairments is height-
ened by a higher proportion of fat to lean mass and lower muscle strength relative to men
(1–3). Age magnifies the negative impact of obesity on function starting in midlife; there is
a steady decline in muscle strength with age, 5% per year between 50 and 60 y of age, and

 3% annually thereafter (4–6). Combined with excessive adiposity, this
can lead to a precipitous decline in functional status (dynapenic
obesity) (7, 8).
Although obesity reduction strongly benefits physical function
(9, 10), the potential for .25% of weight lost during dieting to be
lean mass raises concerns about the long-term impact on muscle
(11). Current reports suggest that enhancing protein intake could
help circumvent this problem (12–14). A “balanced” compared
with a “skewed” daily protein intake has been suggested to prompt
optimal muscle protein anabolism. Thus, increasing protein intake
on a “per meal” or “balanced” basis has been endorsed as a way
to optimize muscle protein synthesis (15–17). Few studies, to our
knowledge, have explored protein supplementation during obesity
reduction and almost all have used exercise along with diet; none
have balanced protein across the day (14, 18–21). Mojtahedi et al.
(18) provided 25 g whey protein 2 times/d in an exercise and
weight-loss intervention for overweight and obese postmenopau-
sal women. The protein increased lean mass relative to body mass,
but did not lead to improvements in function. In contrast, our re-
cent findings in a 6-mo randomized controlled trial of dietary obe-
sity reduction in men and women aged $60 y [Measuring Eating,
Activity, and Strength: Understanding the Response–Using Protein
(MEASUR-UP)8 trial] showed that, relative to a weight-loss control,
a higher-protein diet with 30 g protein consumed 3 times/d robustly
benefited function relative to the control diet, with no group differ-
ence in the preservation of lean mass (22).
The Protein Optimization in Women Enables Results–Using
Protein (POWR-UP) trial tests a balanced higher-protein intake
in obese middle-aged and older women during a 6-mo weight-
loss intervention. The objective was to confirm the feasibility
and fidelity of delivery of the higher-protein diet and to determine
its efficacy for influencing function and retention of lean mass dur-
ing weight reduction in this population. We hypothesized that the
protein-enhanced diet would be superior to the control diet for
impact on function.
Methods
Trial design and participants
This 6-mo randomized controlled trial compared a protein-adequate
diet with a higher-protein diet with regard to effects on the primary
outcomes of function and lean mass during a weight-loss interven-
tion for obese women. The study was approved by the Duke Univer-
sity Health System Institutional Review Board, and written informed
consent was obtained from all participants. Interventions and
assessments were conducted at Duke University Medical Cen-
ter facilities. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02033655.
We used a computerized centralized randomization scheme
blocking by race and marital or partner status. Because many, but
not all, of the participants were functionally frail at baseline, the
treatment groups were also blocked by functional status [#549
or $550 m on the 6-min walk test (6MWT)]. Eligible participants
were randomly assigned in a 1:2 allocation to 1) a Control–Weight-
Loss (C-WL) group or 2) a High-Protein–Weight-Loss (HP-WL)
group.
The 1:2 allocation to the C-WL and HP-WL groups was chosen
because results from a number of published studies of traditional
weight-reduction diets (without protein supplementation) are al-
ready available. Thus, we chose to oversample for the protein
treatment to enhance our ability to make within-group compari-
sons in the protein group in subsequent analyses. This oversam-
pling of the protein group did not cause a substantial loss of
power for the between-group comparisons; the relative power
for a 2:1 split is 0.94 (23). The 6-mo duration was selected to allow
time for safe, gradual weight loss. An interim (4-mo) time point
was also included to determine the trajectory of change in the pri-
mary outcomes and to assess whether a shorter period of treat-
ment might work almost as well as the commonly conducted
6-mo trial (previous findings showed that 3 mo was insufficient
to achieve physiologically important weight loss).
Participants
Community-dwelling women aged $45 y with a BMI (in kg/m2)
$30 were recruited from Durham, North Carolina, and the sur-
rounding areas; recruitment included an emphasis on enrolling
black women. POWR-UP enrolled an all-female population because
women have higher obesity rates and more pronounced functional
frailty than men. We oversampled black women because they
have the highest obesity rates of any demographic subgroup and
yet are understudied with regard to the most effective obesity inter-
ventions (3, 24, 25). Participants aged $45 y were included because
the precise timing of changes in the protein response with age has
not been established. For example, the age at which the anabolic re-
sistance of aging begins to take a clinically detectable toll on function
is unknown (26). Exclusion criteria included dementia, functional
limitations caused by neurological conditions, and unstable or termi-
nal medical conditions. According to our previously established pro-
tocol (27), individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of
$60 mL $ min21 $ 1.73 m22 were eligible for enrollment without
monitoring. Those with a GFR of 45–59 mL $ min21 $ 1.73 m22
were enrolled but monitored with a repeat GFR determination every
2 mo; if GFR decreased by $10% or to ,45 mL $ min21 $ 1.73 m22
the participant was disqualified from the study.
Interventions
Registered dietitians who were experienced in obesity treatment im-
plemented supervised weight-loss interventions in both study groups.
All of the participants were prescribed a hypocaloric (2500 kcal) diet
and met twice with an interventionist to receive individualized kilo-
calorie prescription and meal plans. After the 2 individual sessions,
participants attended weekly group meetings (specific to study group
but equivalent in structure and duration) for diet and health-related
counseling, peer support, and weekly weigh-ins. All of the participants

 were supplied with a low-dose multivitamin supplement (GNC Teen
Multivitamin), along with 400 mg Ca and 600 IU vitamin D (Bayer
Citracal Calcium Supplement +D3) to ensure adequate nutrient intake
and to standardize supplement use (participants were instructed to
discontinue all other nutritional supplements).
C-WL and HP-WL diets
All of the participants were prescribed an energy intake ;500 kcal
below their calculated requirement, as derived from calculations of
estimated total energy expenditure on the basis of weight, height,
sex, age, and activity level with the use of published equations
(28). Participants in the C-WL group were prescribed the RDA for
protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight, with a distribution of calories
of ;15% protein, 30% fat, and 55% carbohydrates. HP-WL partici-
pants were prescribed a protein intake of 1.2 g/kg body weight, with
a target of 30 g protein/meal and a distribution of ;30% protein,
30% fat, and 40% carbohydrates. Because high-quality protein is supe-
rior for promoting anabolism (29, 30), the HP-WL meal plan empha-
sized protein from animal sources, primarily lean meats and poultry,
low-fat dairy, fish, and eggs. To promote achievement of the protein
intake target, participants were supplied with preportioned frozen
or chilled lean meats (lean ground pork, pork tenderloins, pork
chops, and low-sodium ham) sufficient to provide $420 g protein/wk
($30 g for 2 meals/d) for the duration of the trial. To avoid monot-
ony and allow flexibility, participants consumed other complete proteins
(e.g., other lean meats, poultry and fish, low-fat dairy foods, and eggs) at
the third meal of each day according to their prescribed meal plan.
Outcome measurements
Primary outcomes assessed at 0, 4, and 6 mo were function (6MWT)
and lean mass. The 6MWT is commonly used for a wide range of
ages, including older adults (31), and is the test method of choice
for walking speed in clinical research (32). Lean and fat mass
were measured by using the BodPod air-displacement plethysmog-
raphy method (Life Measurement, Inc.) per our established protocol
(22). The BodPod is considered to be as reliable as DXA for a repeat-
measure comparison of changes in fat-free mass within the same in-
dividual over time (33), although, as with any whole-body measure,
it lacks the sensitivity to directly quantify skeletal muscle mass.
Waist circumference was assessed at the minimal waist by using a
Gulick II tape measure. Secondary function measures included the
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the 8-foot up-and-go,
and 30-s chair stands. Isometric hand-grip strength was assessed
for both hands by using the Jamar Hand Dynamometer, with the
higher score being recorded.
Energy and protein intakes were assessed by using 3-d food
records collected at 0, 4, and 6 mo. Records were checked for com-
pleteness, and participants were contacted for any missing infor-
mation. The intake of food and beverages was analyzed by using
Food Processor Nutrition Analysis software (version 10.10, 2012;
ESHA Research) to determine daily intakes of calories and macro-
nutrients, as well as protein intake per meal.
Adherence and safety
The study was conducted under “intent to treat” criteria. Weekly
body weights provided a regular indication of kilocalorie restriction
compliance, and attendance at weigh-ins and group meetings was
also recorded. Interventionists reviewed participants’ daily food
journals each week and adjusted their menus to ensure that the tar-
get kilocalorie intake and, for the HP-WL group, 30 g protein/meal
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were regularly achieved, as previ-
ously described (27). A fasting blood sample was collected to evalu-
ate renal function by GFR at the end of the trial (or every 2 mo as
dictated by the renal function protocol). The estimated GFR was
determined by using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Col-
laboration equation (LabCorp, Inc.) (34). Adverse events were thor-
oughly documented throughout the trial.
Data and statistical analysis
All of the outcome data were double entered, with differences adju-
dicated and treatment codes revealed only after the study statistician
locked the database at the end of the trial. The primary objective of
the trial was to provide information on the efficacy of an enhanced-
protein diet relative to a traditional weight-loss (control) diet on
change in function and lean mass. Measurements were taken at
baseline and at 2 follow-up times (4 and 6 mo). Descriptive analyses
were conducted to summarize the distribution of the covariates and
dependent variables. For the primary and secondary outcomes, we
tested an overall change in both intervention groups and differences
in that change between groups over time. Controlling for baseline
values, a mixed-model repeated-measures approach was used to assess
change from baseline at 4 and 6 mo. The mixed-model repeated-
measures approach extends the standard repeated-measures
ANOVA to allow for missing values, error structures other than
compound symmetry, and measurements taken at nonequal inter-
vals. The main effect of the outcomes was tested by the time effect,
whereas the group difference was assessed by statistical significance
of the group and the group 3 time interaction. Significance was
declared at an a level of 0.05 (2-tailed).
Results
Baseline demographic and functional characteristics
Of 234 eligible individuals identified for screening, 154 were ex-
cluded as shown in Figure 1. Baseline characteristics for the 80 parti-
cipants who qualified and were randomly assigned to C-WL (n = 29)
and HP-WL (n = 51) groups are shown in Table 1. Mean 6 SD age
was 60 6 8.2 y, and 37.5% of enrolled women were black. Partic-
ipants had class II (mean BMI = 37.8) obesity and their baseline
protein intake was 0.83 6 0.2 g/kg body weight.
Efficacy of the interventions
Both groups reduced calorie intakes at 4 and 6 mo, with no group
difference (Table 2). Three-day diet records confirmed achieve-
ment of an average intake of 30 g protein at each meal in the
HP-WL group. At 6 mo, mean 6 SD HP-WL protein intakes
were 31.0 6 11.6 g for breakfast, 34.5 6 8.0 g for lunch, and
40.0 6 8.5 g for dinner, with a total intake of 1.3 g protein $
kg body weight21 $ d21 at 4 and 6 mo. For the C-WL group, in con-
trast, protein intakes per meal and expressed as g $ kg body
weight21 $ d21 were unchanged at 4 and 6 mo. Age was inversely

 associated with calories consumed (r = 20.25, P , 0.05) and total
protein intake per day (r = 20.23, P , 0.05); however, protein intake
per meal did not differ by age.
Weight reduction and primary outcomes
At 6 mo, physiologically important weight losses were achieved
(mean 6 SD: C-WL, 26.3% 6 4.8%; HP-WL, 26.2% 6 5.3%;
P , 0.001; Table 3) and function (6MWT) was improved in both
groups. With regard to within-group improvements in function
(6MWT), a significant change occurred at both 4 mo (P , 0.01)
and 6 mo (P , 0.001) for the HP-WL group and only at 6 mo
(P , 0.01) for the C-WL group. Controlling for baseline, 6MWT in-
creased by 45.2 m (P , 0.001) at 4 mo and by 46.9 m (P , 0.001)
at 6 mo, whereas 6MWT in the C-WL group increased by 46.8 m
(P = 0.01) at 6 mo only. However, there was no significant differ-
ence detected in 6MWT results between treatment groups.
Lean mass decreased in both groups (C-WL: 21.0 6 1.1 kg;
HP-WL: 20.6 6 1.1 kg; P , 0.01; Table 3). The percentage of
body lean mass also decreased in the C-WL group (at 6 mo)
(P = 0.03) but was unchanged in the HP-WL group (P = 0.49).
However, the comparison for changes in lean mass between
treatment groups was nonsignificant.
Secondary outcomes, race, and age
At 6 mo, both the C-WL and HP-WL groups showed clinically
meaningful improvements in SPPB scores (C-WL: 1.2 6 1.0 units;
HP-WL: 1.0 6 1.4 units; P , 0.001). The SPPB subcomponent anal-
ysis showed no change in balance score but an improvement in the
number of chair stands in both treatment groups; however, gait
speed improved (P , 0.01) only in the HP-WL group (Table 3).
The number of chair stands in 30 s increased (P , 0.01) at 4 mo
in the HP-WL group and at 6 mo in both groups (P , 0.001), and
performance of the 8-foot up-and-go test improved in both groups
at both time points (P , 0.01). BodPod results indicated a reduction
in fat mass in both groups. Likewise, waist circumference was
decreased at both time points for both C-WL and HP-WL groups
(P , 0.001). We did not find a significant group effect for
any of these measures of function or for body fat or waist
circumference.
Our analyses of main study outcomes did show differences by
race (Figure 2A). White women lost more weight than did black
women at both 4 mo (6.0 6 3.6 compared with 3.7 6 3.4 kg;
P , 0.02) and 6 mo (7.2 6 4.8 compared with 4.0 6 4.7 kg;
P , 0.04). Black participants also tended (P = 0.07) to have smaller
improvements in 6MWT than white participants (Figure 2B). As
shown in Figure 3A, age tended (P = 0.06) to be positively associ-
ated with the amount of weight lost and there was a time 3 age
interaction, such that middle-aged women lost more weight at 4
than at 6 mo, whereas older women lost more weight at 6 than
at 4 mo [F(1, 48) = 4.71, P , 0.03]. Change in 6MWT did not differ
by age (Figure 3B).
Adherence and safety
Active participants in both groups had good or very good atten-
dance at the weekly group and weigh-in meetings (C-WL = 69.4%;
HP-WL = 77.0%). However, drop-out rates were relatively high:

 55% for controls and 43% for HP-WL participants. There was no
difference in drop-out rate by group (P = 0.30); however, compared
with dropouts, study completers were more likely to be white
(P , 0.05) and to have a higher educational level (P , 0.05).
There were no adverse events related to the protocol and no
serious adverse events occurred during the trial. Two HP-WL
participants were disqualified from study participation when
their GFR fell below the inclusion level; however, both cases

 Discussion
“Physical resilience” is defined as the ability to optimize or recover
physical function when faced with a health stressor (35). For many
women, obesity reduces physical resilience through a negatively re-
inforcing cycle of reduced mobility (3, 36–38). This study explored
the feasibility and efficacy of a hypocaloric regimen with generous,
balanced high-quality protein intake (“protein-centric” meals)
to improve physical resilience in a high-risk population of women.
Our diet approach was founded on reports by Symons et al. (39)
and others (40) that showed that ;30 g high-quality protein/
meal optimizes the anabolic response in aging muscle. A recent
cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 1999–2001 (1081 adults aged
50–85 y of age) found that consuming meals containing 30–45
g protein was associated with greater leg lean mass and strength
(41). Thus, we hypothesized that a protein regimen of ;30 g
high-quality protein/meal would help counteract the ten-
dency to lose muscle mass during weight loss and promote better
function.
Our results support the feasibility of implementation of a meal-
balanced higher-protein diet for obesity reduction. However, the
hypothesis that the HP-WL group would achieve greater improve-
ments in function and lean mass was not confirmed by a significant
group effect. There were earlier and more positive within-group
findings for the HP-WL than for the C-WL group, and this could
hint that higher protein intake led to more robust improvements
in function. However, it is important to note that, due to the 2:1
randomization, the number of completers in the HP-WL group
(n = 29) was more than twice that in the C-WL group (n = 13),
which could explain our ability to detect more changes in the
HP-WL group. In the MEASUR-UP study, our first trial of 30 g
protein/meal, there was a robust protein effect on function (22).
However, several important differences between these 2 trials could
explain the difference in findings. MEASUR-UP included both sexes,
and the participants were older (mean 6 SD age: 68.2 6 5.6 y
compared with 60.0 6 8.2 y in POWR-UP) and achieved greater

6 than at 4 mo [F(1, 48) = 4.71, P , 0.03]. (B) There was no association

 weight loss (;8% compared with ;6% in POWR-UP). The ten-
dency for older participants to achieve more weight loss aligns
with our present results as well as with findings from the Look
AHEAD (42) and Diabetes Prevention Program (43) trials, which
showed that older participants lost more weight than their younger
counterparts. Although we lack sufficient numbers in this trial to an-
swer the question, it could be that the amount of weight lost and/or
age and sex modulates the impact of higher protein intake on
function.
The absence of a group effect on retention of lean mass in
POWR-UP is less surprising and could reflect the reported discon-
nect between changes in muscle mass and changes in muscle
strength and function (44, 45). Moreover, although our measure-
ment conditions were carefully standardized, the BodPod assesses
total lean body mass and may be insufficiently sensitive to assess
group differences in skeletal muscle mass.
It is intriguing that black women in the POWR-UP trial lost less
body weight and showed smaller improvements in 6MWT than
white participants. Although the study was not designed or pow-
ered to conduct a direct race comparison, our findings agree with
reports in the literature of a blunted effectiveness of weight-loss
interventions in black women (46–48). This is particularly unfor-
tunate because black women face the highest obesity rates of any
demographic group (3). Our findings on 6MWT also agree with re-
ports of higher rates of obesity-related disability in black women
than in whites (1, 49, 50). In view of the very limited research to
date, further investigations aimed at understanding these racial
differences are urgently needed, especially in older populations.
Strengths and limitations
The POWR-UP trial was a closely supervised intensive intervention
conducted in a well-characterized population by an experienced
clinical research team and included a battery of robust outcome
measures. Detailed meal plans, supervision by registered dietitians,
and weekly food logs ensured dietary compliance; and weekly
body weight measurements objectively reflected adherence to the
weight-loss regimen. The provision of high-quality protein for 2
of 3 daily meals for the HP-WL group helped ensure compliance
with the protein intake goals, as we have previously shown (22),
and as documented in 3-d diet records. The successful implementa-
tion of the protein regimen has important implications, because a
meal-balanced, higher protein intake is being widely advocated for
older adults for a host of diverse metabolic roles, including biosyn-
thesis of nitrogen-containing compounds and mRNA translation (51).
The most obvious limitation of the trial is the relatively modest
number of participants who completed the study. Drop-out rates
were higher than anticipated, especially in the middle-aged
women. We examined the reasons for dropout to inform future
trials and found that 56% of dropouts had difficulty meeting study
requirements due to family commitments or health issues; another
11% developed new health problems unrelated to the study. In par-
ticular, the tendency for more dropouts among minorities and
those with less education indicates a need for future interventions
to address adherence strategies for these groups. Another limita-
tion concerns the limited ability to measure change in muscle
mass because, as already noted, the BodPod measurement lacks
sensitivity to quantify specific changes in skeletal muscle mass.
Summary
The findings of the POWR-UP trial showed clinically important
functional benefits of weight reduction in middle-aged and older
obese women but failed to conclusively confirm whether or not
the higher-protein regimen provided more benefit to function
than an RDA level of protein intake. Future studies in larger num-
bers of participants are warranted in both men and women, and es-
pecially in older age groups, who find it easier to lose weight and for
whom extra protein at meals is being recommended (41, 52, 53). In
addition, our findings of racial differences in response to the inter-
vention lend strong support for further studies sufficiently powered
to explore the interaction of race with functional responses to obe-
sity reduction in middle-aged and older women.
