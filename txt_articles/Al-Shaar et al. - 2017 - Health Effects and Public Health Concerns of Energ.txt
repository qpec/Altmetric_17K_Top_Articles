As energy drink consumption continues to grow worldwide and within the United States, 
it is important to critically examine the nutritional content and effects on population 
health of these beverages. This mini-review summarizes the current scientific evidence 
on health consequences from energy drink consumption, presents relevant public 
health challenges, and proposes recommendations to mitigate these issues. Emerging 
evidence has linked energy drink consumption with a number of negative health con-
sequences such as risk-seeking behaviors, poor mental health, adverse cardiovascular 
effects, and metabolic, renal, or dental conditions. Despite the consistency in evidence, 
most studies are of cross-sectional design or focus almost exclusively on the effect of 
caffeine and sugar, failing to address potentially harmful effects of other ingredients. The 
negative health effects associated with energy drinks (ED) are compounded by a lack 
of regulatory oversight and aggressive marketing by the industry toward adolescents. 
Moreover, the rising trend of mixing ED with alcohol presents a new challenge that 
researchers and public health practitioners must address further. To curb this grow-
ing public health issue, policy makers should consider creating a separate regulatory 
category for ED, setting an evidence-based upper limit on caffeine, restricting sales of 
ED, and regulating existing ED marketing strategies, especially among children and 
adolescents.

inTRODUCTiOn
Energy drinks (ED) are non-alcoholic beverages marketed to improve energy, stamina, athletic 
performance, and concentration. Categorized as “functional beverages” alongside sports drinks and 
nutraceuticals, the ED industry has grown dramatically in the past 20 years, reaching over $9.7 billion 
in United States (U.S.) sales in 2015, with two brands accounting for nearly 85% of the market (1). 
The target consumer market for ED is adolescents and young adults (1), with one study finding that 
51% of college students report consuming at least one ED each month (2). While annual sales of ED 
remain dwarfed by those of soft drinks and coffee, there are concerns that lax regulation of marketing 
and ingredient labeling is spurring a trend of increased consumption. Since their introduction to the 
U.S. market in 1997, there has been a significant increasing trend in ED consumption among children,

Category of health effects
Major effects observed
Risk-seeking behaviors
• Substance abuse: alcohol, cigarettes, 
marijuana, amphetamines (32, 35)
• Aggressive behavior: fighting, bullying,  
truancy (35)
Mental health effects
• Stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms,  
suicidal ideation, plan or attempt (33, 36, 37)
• Low academic achievement (35)
Adverse cardiovascular effects
• Increased systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (39, 41)
• Increased heart rate (39)
Adverse metabolic,  
dental, or renal effectsa
• Overweight/obesity risk (44, 47–49)
• Risk of metabolic/type 2 diabetes (48)
• Dental decay (51, 52)
• Renal microvascular damage and 
accelerated progression of chronic kidney 
disease (53–55)
Other health effects
• Sleep dissatisfaction, tiredness/fatigue, late 
bedtime, headaches, stomachaches and 
irritation (35, 56–59)
aThe evidence for adverse metabolic and dental effects comes from studies on sugar-
sweetened beverages in general; ED are often classified as such as they contain 
added sugar.

adolescents, and adults, although the proportion of calories attrib-
utable to ED is still marginal compared to other sugar-sweetened 
beverages (SSBs) such as soda and fruit juice (3, 4). The rising 
prevalence of ED consumption is particularly problematic given 
the emerging evidence of association with negative health con-
sequences such as risk-seeking behaviors, adverse cardiovascular 
effects, and metabolic, renal, or dental conditions (5, 6). Updating 
and integrating the findings of some previous reviews (7, 8), this 
mini-review summarizes the current scientific evidence on ED 
health effects, presents relevant public health challenges, and 
proposes recommendations to amend these issues.
COnSTiTUenTS AnD inGReDienTS
Despite the vast array of ED available in the U.S., most ED contain 
similar ingredients including water, sugar, caffeine, non-nutritive 
stimulants (e.g., guarana, ginseng, yerba mate, taurine, l-carnitine, 
 
d-glucuronolactone, and inositol) and certain vitamins and 
minerals (e.g., B vitamins) (1, 9). The caffeine content in ED 
ranges widely from 47 to 80 mg per 8 oz to as high as 207 mg per 
 
2 oz and comes from a number of ingredient sources (10). 
While moderate caffeine intake (up to 400 mg/day) is generally 
considered safe and even beneficial for health among adults (11), 
there has not been extensive research conducted on children and 
adolescents to determine if any tolerable level exists (12). ED also 
contain large amounts of high fructose-corn syrup, sucrose, or 
artificial sweeteners. The amount of sugar contained in one can 
(500 mL or 16.9 oz) of an ED is typically about 54 g (13). Many 
institutions, including the World Health Organization, have 
recommended reducing sugar intake due to the strong evidence 
linking consumption of added sugar to poor health (14).
Reports on other constituents of ED are relatively limited. 
Guarana is a plant extract native to South America which contains 
a significant amount of caffeine, with 1 g of guarana equivalent 
to 40 mg of caffeine (15). Due to this particularly high caffeine 
content, guarana is often included as an ingredient in ED for its 
stimulatory effect (1, 16). Ginseng is an herbal supplement that 
has been used for thousands of years in East Asia and has reported 
health benefits including vasorelaxation, antioxidation, anti-
inflammation, and anticancer (17, 18). Like guarana, yerba mate 
has a high caffeine concentration (78 mg caffeine per cup) (1) and 
is additionally thought to have benefits in the form of antioxidant 
capacity, weight management, and cancer prevention (19). Taurine 
has been reported to have anti-inflammatory actions and has been 
suggested in the treatment of epilepsy, heart failure, cystic fibrosis, 
and diabetes (20). B vitamins refer to a group of eight water soluble 
vitamins which generally play an important role in cell function-
ing, with vitamin B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B6 (pyridoxine, 
pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine), and B12 being the most common 
B vitamins added to ED (1). Despite the importance of B vitamins 
as coenzymes in various metabolic processes, most individuals in 
the U.S. already meet the recommended daily amount and hence 
the additional B vitamins added to ED are often excreted from the 
body with urine, failing to impart any additional health effect (1). 
The literature on the content and function of other additives such 
as l-carnitine, d-glucuronolactone, and inositol is limited, with a 
few studies suggesting moderate benefits (18).
HeAlTH eFFeCTS OF eD
improved Cognitive and Physical 
Performance
Some studies support the temporary health benefits of ED in 
improving mental and physical stamina among both adults 
and adolescents. Several randomized controlled trials among 
adults have shown an association between components of ED 
and improved subjective alertness (21), as well as restoration of 
fatigue (22). Due to its similar structure to adenosine, caffeine 
can inhibit sleep through its competitive binding to the adeno-
sine receptor (23). Studies have also shown the effect of ED on 
improved physical activity performance in young-adult athletes 
(24–27). A recent meta-analysis of acute-effect studies conducted 
among adults found that ED consumption improved muscle 
strength and endurance, performance on endurance exercise 
tests, jumping, and sport-specific actions (28).
In contrast, the vast majority of evidence suggests negative 
health effects of both short- and long-term ED consumption 
(Table 1), with most literature proposing these health disadvan-
tages are attributable to high levels of caffeine and sugar while 
highlighting that more research is needed on the effects of other 
ED constituents.
Risk-Seeking behaviors and Mental  
Health effects
Several studies report a consistent association between ED 
consumption and substance abuse, although the evidence base 
consists primarily of cross-sectional studies, which does not 
allow for establishing directionality of the association (29–34). 
For example, in a nationally representative sample of U.S. mid-
dle- and high-school students, significant associations were 
 3

Health Effects of ED

found between ED frequency and 30-day frequency of use of 
alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, or amphetamines (32). This ech-
oes cross-sectional results among adolescent regular consumers 
(>1 ED/week) in Europe who were more likely to smoke and 
drink alcohol compared to non-consumers (35). Some studies 
have additionally found evidence for an association between 
ED consumption and mental health, including stress, anxiety, 
depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation, plan or attempt 
(33, 36, 37). For example, teenagers in Canada who reported ED 
consumption more than once a month were nearly three times 
more likely to report elevated depressive symptoms compared 
to those who did not report ED consumption (33). A review 
of ED consumption and mental health among adolescents and 
adults supported a positive association between chronic ED use 
and undesirable mental health effects, including stress, anxiety, 
and depression (37). The authors postulate that this association 
may be moderated by dysregulated sleep, such that consuming 
heavily caffeinated ED may result in sleep loss which in turn may 
contribute to poor functioning and mental health.
Adverse Cardiovascular effects
Numerous studies have explored the short-term effects of ED 
on the cardiovascular system, primarily with respect to caffeine 
and sugar (38–40). For example, a recent randomized crossover 
study on healthy subjects found that consumption of 355 mL of 
an ED resulted in increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
heart rate, and cardiac output (39). A 2016 meta-analysis of 15 
studies similarly reported that acute ED consumption resulted in 
increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure across the pooled 
results (41). Although the meta-analysis did not find evidence 
for increased heart rate, the researchers noted the need for well-
designed studies before any conclusions can be made.
Caffeine toxicity is believed to occur above 400 mg/day for 
adults, 100 mg/day for adolescents (12–18 years), and 2.5 mg/kg 
 
of body weight for children (<12 years), with serious symptoms 
often related to cardiovascular effects (42). In the 1-year period 
between October 2010 and September 2011, the U.S. National 
Poison Data System received 4,854 ED-related calls, including 
major adverse events such as seizure, dysrhythmia, and tachyp-
nea (42). Data from Australian poisons centers confirm these 
major symptoms of recreational or accidental ED intake among 
children and adolescents, in addition to palpitations, agitation, 
and tremor (43). Given that these data relies on self-reported 
signs and symptoms and most consumers may not readily iden-
tify ED as a poison, it is likely that ED-related toxicity reports 
are underestimated. It is believed that the potential for caffeine 
toxicity from ED is greater than other caffeine sources such as 
coffee or tea due to inadequate labeling and greater volume of 
consumption driven by heavy advertising promoting “more is 
better,” especially among children and youth (5).
Adverse Metabolic, Dental, or Renal 
effects
Sugar-sweetened beverages, which refer to beverages with added 
sugar such as soda, fruit juice, and many ED, are consistently 
associated with long-term negative health effects particularly 
among children and adolescents (44–46). Primarily, SSBs have 
been linked to overweight/obesity risk and metabolic condi-
tions such as type 2 diabetes (44, 47–49), potentially through 
the low satiety of SSBs and consumers not sufficiently reducing 
total energy intake to account for the additional calories of SSBs 
(50). In addition, consumption of SSBs increases blood glucose 
and insulin levels, contributing to a high glycemic load which 
is associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 
(48). SSBs are also associated with a high prevalence of dental 
caries, wherein bacteria in the mouth utilize the sugars from 
SSBs and produce acid that decays the teeth (51, 52). Finally, 
renal diseases, specifically renal microvascular damage (53) 
and accelerated progression of chronic kidney disease, have 
been shown to be induced by fructose in SSBs in animal-based 
models (54, 55).
Other Health effects
Energy drinks’ consumption is also associated with other com-
monly reported health problems such as sleep dissatisfaction, 
tiredness/fatigue, late bedtime, headaches, and stomachaches 
and irritation (35, 56–59). It is likely that many of these general 
health complaints are attributable to caffeine or sugar content, 
but additional research needs to be conducted to confirm this, 
as well as to assess the potential effect of other constituents. 
 
In a cross-sectional study conducted in Finland, consumers of ED 
had a 4.6 (95% CI: 2.8, 7.7) times greater odds of headaches, 3.6 
(95% CI: 2.2, 5.8) times greater odds of sleeping problems, and 
 
4.1 (95% CI: 2.7, 6.1) times greater odds of having an irritable 
mood compared to non-consumers (57).
limitations of the existing literature
The literature generally suggests that the negative health effects 
of ED outweigh the beneficial effects. However, there are con-
siderable limitations to the existing literature. First, most stud-
ies on ED are cross-sectional, limiting the ability to establish 
temporal relationships and support causality. In addition, many 
articles used small homogenous populations, often consisting 
of healthy, young to middle-aged adults, thus limiting gener-
alizability to the U.S. population. Finally, studies specifically 
examining the effects of other ED constituents are lacking 
 
and thus there is limited knowledge on the potential mecha-
nisms beyond those of caffeine and sugar, for which most of the 
 
literature exist.

energy Drink Marketing
Since 2004, aggressive advertising by ED companies has led to 
substantial market growth, with a more than 240% increase in 
sales in the U.S. and worldwide. ED are now available in more 
than 140 countries (8) and are on track to become a $21 billion 
industry in the U.S. by 2017 (60).
Energy drinks’ marketing strategies pose a significant public 
health threat in the U.S. due to the size of their target adolescent 
market and the marketing strategies they employ. ED face heavy 
competition for market share with SSB corporations that dwarf 
them in size, customer base, distribution capability, and ability to 
 4

Health Effects of ED

invest in advertising (61). To compete, ED companies target the 
approximately 33.5 million 12- to 19-year olds in the U.S. (62). 
The public health implications of targeting adolescents are not 
trivial: adolescents lack maturity in key areas of the brain, are 
biologically predisposed to have poor impulse control, and are 
more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior (63). This not only 
makes them more likely to consume the product on a regular 
basis but also makes them more vulnerable to identifying and 
potentially engaging in sexual and risk-taking behaviors depicted 
in ED marketing.
Adolescents’ vulnerability to the marketing tactics of ED 
companies is particularly serious given that ED are now omni-
present across multiple vending channels with price points widely 
affordable to all strata of the population. There are few signs that 
the scale and targeting of ED marketing will change in the near 
future. A 2014 study on ED marketing conducted by the offices 
of several U.S. Senators found that of the sixteen companies they 
approached, only four agreed to avoid marketing their products 
to children (64).
lack of Regulation and Taxation
Overall, there is a significant lack of ED regulation in the U.S. 
(65). While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces 
a caffeine limit of 71 mg per 12 fluid ounces for soda, ED 
manufacturers can avoid this by classifying their product as a 
“supplement,” regulated under the 1994 Dietary Supplement and 
Education Act and not subject to any caffeine limits (1, 8). That 
said, many ED companies are moving to marketing their prod-
ucts as beverages to address public concerns that their products 
are circumventing labeling requirements and also to enable ED 
to be available to participants of the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program, a U.S. nutrition assistance program provid-
ing low-income individuals with financial support to purchase 
food and beverages.
In 2014, the American Beverage Association published the 
“Guidance for the Responsible Labeling and Marketing of Energy 
Drinks,” which allowed ED companies to voluntarily commit to 
a number of industry goals (66). The companies committed to 
report total quantities of caffeine from all sources, restrict market-
ing to children, and voluntarily report adverse events to the FDA. 
However, an assessment report found that compliance to this 
commitment was staggeringly low (64), with 8 of 12 companies 
still marketing to children and 4 of 10 companies not willing to 
report adverse events voluntarily. Other countries facing similar 
challenge to the U.S. have implemented various approaches to 
regulate ED. For example, Australia and New Zealand created a 
unique regulatory category for ED called “formulated caffeine 
beverages,” and set the upper limit of caffeine from any source to 
be 320 mg/L (65).
In addition to regulation, some countries have implemented 
taxation policies as a deterrent to ED consumption. Mexico 
currently taxes all non-alcoholic beverages with added sugar, 
including ED, at one-peso-per-liter, with recent assessments 
reporting that purchases of taxed beverages have decreased by 
an average of 6% since implementation in January 2014 (67). 
Similarly successful initiatives have been emerging in some 
U.S. cities (68).
Alcohol and energy Drink Mixing
In addition to being consumed alone, ED are frequently mixed 
with alcohol, with one study in the European Union finding that 
71% of young adults report consuming ED with alcohol (69). This 
is problematic because individuals who drink alcohol-mixed ED 
consume more alcohol than if they were drinking alcohol alone 
(70, 71). Researchers attribute this to the fact that consumption of 
ED masks the signs of alcohol inebriation, enabling an individual 
to believe they can still safely consume more alcohol, leading to 
“awake drunkenness” (72). As a result of this increased alcohol 
consumption, those who drink alcohol-mixed ED are more 
likely to experience severe dehydration and alcohol poisoning 
(73). This negative health trend is particularly concerning as it 
disproportionately affects underage individuals and has been 
linked to binge drinking, alcohol-dependence behaviors (70) and 
drunk driving (74).
ReCOMMenDATiOnS AnD FUTURe 
DiReCTiOnS
Public health and policy action must be taken to mitigate the 
negative health effects and public health challenges associated 
with ED. First, the FDA should consider regulation of ED as a 
separate category, requiring clear labeling of total caffeine and 
sugar content in reference to daily recommended amounts, and 
enforcing an upper limit for caffeine based on current evidence. 
Additional consideration should be given to taxing ED and/or 
restricting the sale of ED to children and adolescents. Marketing 
strategies should be also regulated to minimize the promotion 
of ED among adolescent and young adults. Because marketing 
is largely aimed at this segment of the population, exposure to 
ED products could be reduced considerably. In parallel, further 
research should continue to improve the quality of the evidence on 
the health effects of ED with particular attention to observational 
studies with longer follow-up, more heterogeneous populations, 
and the effects of other ED constituents. Finally, adolescents 
and their parents should be educated on the adverse nutritional 
content and subsequent health effects of ED so that they can 
 
make informed decisions about consumption.
Despite some limited beneficial short-term effects, ED 
should be considered a significant public health problem that 
warrants attention. The growing evidence base demonstrating 
associations between ED consumption and negative health 
effects and public health challenges point to the need for close 
surveillance and assessment of this issue by researchers and 
policy makers.
