Abstract  
Substantial evidence supports the increased consumption of high quality protein to achieve 
optimal health outcomes. A growing body of research indicates that protein intakes well above 
the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) help to promote healthy aging, appetite 
regulation, weight management and goals aligned with athletic performance. Higher protein 
intakes may help prevent age-related sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength that 
predisposes older adults to frailty, disability and loss of autonomy. Higher protein diets also 
improve satiety, and lead to greater reductions in body weight and fat mass compared to standard 
protein diets, and may therefore serve as a successful strategy to help prevent and/or treat 
obesity. Athletes can also benefit from higher protein intakes to maximize athletic performance 
given the critical role protein plays in stimulating muscle protein remodeling after exercise. 
Protein quality, per meal dose and timing of ingestion are also important considerations. Despite 
persistent beliefs to the contrary we can find no evidence-based link between higher protein diets 
and renal disease or adverse bone health. This brief synopsis highlights recent learnings based on 
presentations at the 2015 Canadian Nutrition Society conference, Advances in Protein Nutrition 
across the Lifespan. Current evidence indicates intakes in the range of at least 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg/day 
of high quality protein is a more ideal target for achieving optimal health outcomes in adults.

Protein nutrition in the aging population  
Maintaining an independent lifestyle at an advanced age largely defines quality of life. One 
major health challenge in the aging population is to slow the decline in muscle mass and 
strength, i.e. sarcopenia, to prevent functional impairments leading to gradual loss of 
autonomy. Among many other etiologic factors, low protein intake is thought to contribute to 
sarcopenia (Cruz-Jentof et al. 2010). In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study including 
2066 men and women of 70-79 years, the loss of total lean and appendicular muscle mass was 
less in the highest quintile of energy-adjusted protein intake of 1.2 g/kg/d than in the lowest 
quintile of 0.8 g/kg/d (Houston et al. 2008). Likewise, analysis of a subset of the Women’s 
Health Initiative study (n=24,417 women, 65-79 years) determined a 32% lower risk of 
developing frailty over 3 years associated with a 20% increase in calibrated protein intake (as % 
of energy) (Beasley et al. 2010). These data from large cohort studies suggest health benefits 
from ingesting protein in greater amounts than the current RDA.    
Protein requirements for older adults  
The current harmonized USA-Canadian Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 
0.8 g/kg/d for all adults including older ones (Institute of Medicine 2005). The RDA represents 
the estimated average requirement plus 2 standard deviations, determined from selected 
nitrogen-balance studies of which very few were performed in older individuals (Rand et al. 
2003). This approach, which determines the minimal protein intake required to avoid net 
nitrogen losses, is now considered inappropriate for establishing recommendations (Layman et 
al. 2015). This particularly applies to elderly persons experiencing muscle loss, reduced energy

intake and physical activity, and co-morbidities, that all affect nitrogen balance and protein 
anabolism.    
Recent studies using the indicator amino acid oxidation technique, an independent tracer-
based method that circumvents many nitrogen balance limitations, reported greater than 
current protein requirements in elderly women aged ≥65 years and specifically over 80. They 
estimated average requirements of 1.0-1.1 g/kg/d, and thus an RDA of 1.2-1.3 g/kg/d (Raffi et 
al. 2015; Tang et al. 2014). While these costly and labor-intensive studies are small in sample 
size, and would require confirmation in elderly men, they clearly indicate the need for more 
precise ways of determining minimal protein requirements. However, the emerging consensus 
goal is not only definition of minimal needs but also of levels to ensure optimal long-term 
health, including the prevention of sarcopenia (Bauer et al. 2013; Layman et al. 2015; Paddon-
Jones et al 2015; Volpi et al. 2013). 
Surveys and large cohort studies in older adults report wide variations in protein intake with 
considerable proportions (10-35%) of individuals not even meeting the current RDA of 0.8 
g/kg/d (USDA ARS 2014; Dumartheray et al. 2006). The Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition 
as a Determinant of Successful Aging (NuAge), conducted in 1793 community-dwelling men and 
women of 68-82 years at baseline, in Quebec, Canada (Gaudreau et al. 2007), estimated an 
average protein intake (± SD) of 1.0 ± 0.3 g/kg/d with a range of 0.4-3.0 g/kg/d. Thus, half of the 
cohort was consuming less than 1 g/kg/d, and 23% had intakes lower than the current RDA 
(unpublished data).   
Protein distribution

Besides protein quantity, considerable interest currently focuses on patterns of protein intake 
throughout the day. The suggestion to distribute protein intake equally at each meal to favour 
protein anabolism stems from two main concepts (Padddon-Jones and Rasmussen 2009). First, 
because essential amino acids (EAA), leucine in particular, themselves stimulate muscle protein 
synthesis (Volpi et al. 2003), a threshold of high-quality protein intake must be reached at each 
meal. Second, excess dietary amino acids beyond the capacity to maximally stimulate protein 
synthesis are not stored but oxidized, and may therefore be considered “wasted”. These 
concepts warrant special attention when applied to the elderly population. In elderly versus 
young men, lower muscle protein synthesis was reported in response to a small dose of EAA 
(Katsanos et al. 2005), but was normal in response to greater EAA intake corresponding to 25-
30 g of protein (Paddon-Jones et al. 2004). Similarly, the protein anabolic response to 
hyperinsulinemia was blunted in older participants (Chevalier et al. 2006), but normalized by 
supraphysiological insulin (Fujita et al. 2009) or postprandial hyperaminoacidemia (Chevalier et 
al. 2011). These findings led to the notion of anabolic resistance of aging, which, due to several 
possible factors such as insulin resistance, inflammation and inactivity, increases the threshold 
for postprandial protein anabolism (Boirie 2013). This is supported by the recent retrospective 
calculation of more protein required to stimulate myofibrillar protein synthesis in older than in 
young men, equating to approximately 31 g of high-quality protein (whey and eggs) (Moore et 
al. 2015). As well, protein oxidation and synthesis processes are not mutually exclusive. While 
protein oxidation increases linearly with circulating amino acid increments, higher doses of 
protein are required to stimulate protein synthesis (Yang Y et al. 2012). Because higher protein 
intakes may also suppress protein breakdown, net protein anabolism (synthesis minus

breakdown) was shown to be linearly related to protein intake with no apparent plateau (Deutz 
and Wolfe 2013). Thus, amounts that may be considered excessive are not wasted and may 
have an important anabolic role, especially in older adults who have a higher threshold.          
The usual protein intake distribution of US adults is typically skewed with a low intake at 
breakfast, not reaching the threshold of 25-30 g, and exceeding it at dinner (Paddon-Jones et al. 
2015).  The group of Paddon-Jones tested a redistribution of intake providing 30 g at each meal 
for 7 days in a cross-over design versus 11/16/63 g, in young adults (Mamerow et al. 2014). The 
even pattern resulted in greater 24-h muscle protein synthesis than with the skewed 
distribution. In contrast, Kim et al. (2015) found no effect of protein distribution at two levels of 
protein intakes (RDA vs. 2 x RDA) on whole-body balance and muscle protein synthesis in adults 
of 52-75 years, whereas intakes at twice the RDA improved these outcomes. Methodological 
differences and limitations aside, these short-term studies quantify acute effects on protein 
anabolism that remain to be translated into gains of lean mass or function. One longer-term 
study of 42 days was performed in malnourished hospitalized elderly persons consuming on 
average 1.3 g protein/kg/d either as a pulse feeding pattern, with >70% of protein provided at 
lunch, or spread into four meals (Bouillanne et al. 2013). Significant gains in body cell mass and 
lean mass, but not handgrip strength, were found only in the pulse-fed group. Because only two 
of the four meals in the spread pattern provided at least 30 g of protein, it may be that 
amounts were not sufficient at each eating occasion to reach an anabolic threshold that is, 
furthermore, likely elevated in these malnourished, inactive older patients. These findings point 
to probable differences in optimal protein intake in diseased versus healthy older adults and to 
the pressing need for more studies to elucidate this aspect.

Finally, data from the NuAge cohort indicate that protein intake pattern in older adults is not as 
skewed as in younger ones (Figure 1) (Farsijani et al. 2015). Breakfast is also the lowest protein-
containing meal, whereas lunch and dinner provide more similar average amounts of protein, 
reaching the threshold of 30 g only by men, at dinner. Though promising and mechanistically 
sound, the available evidence is insufficient to recommend distributing protein intake evenly 
across meals in order to limit muscle mass and strength decline with age. Rather, reaching an 
optimal total protein intake should be the priority, which translates into increasing intakes for a 
large proportion of the older population. Still, given the limited appetite of most older adults, a 
pragmatic recommendation to ensure an optimal intake would be to include a high quality 
protein source at breakfast, the meal generally containing the least. Not only safe and feasible, 
this recommendation may also provide benefits on satiety and weight control.  
Protein and weight management  
Although the majority of North Americans are meeting the RDA of 0.8 g protein/kg/d to prevent 
protein-related deficiencies, emerging evidence illustrates beneficial effects on health-related 
outcomes when consuming protein at higher quantities (Fulgoni 2008; Leidy et al. 2015). 
Specifically, increased dietary protein may serve as one dietary strategy to improve weight 
management by reducing body weight and fat mass while concomitantly preserving lean mass 
(Leidy et al. 2015). These improvements appear to occur as a result of key modulations in 
appetite control and satiety, leading to reductions in daily intake (Leidy et al. 2015). However, 
several key dietary factors exist which may directly influence these protein-related effects.

Notably, protein quantity, quality and timing of consumption may have effects on the practical 
outcomes and ingestive behavior mechanisms-of-action that influence weight management. 
Protein quantity and weight loss 
Over the past 4 years, there have been 6 meta-analyses performed to assess whether high-
protein diets differentially impact weight loss and changes in body composition over the short- 
and longer-term [Wycherley et al. 2013; Dong et al. 2013; Santesso et al. 2012; Bueno et al. 
2013; Schwingshackl and Hoffmann 2013; Clifton et al. 2014). In the tightly-controlled shorter-
term studies of ≤ 1 year, the high-protein diets, ranging from 16-45% of daily intake as protein 
(i.e., ~1.2-1.6 g/kg/d) illustrated greater weight loss, fat mass loss, and/or preservation of lean 
mass compared to the normal-protein diets containing 5-23% of intake as protein (Wycherley 
et al. 2013; Dong et al. 2013; Santesso et al. 2012). In fact, two of the meta-analyses included 
studies that did not include energy restriction interventions and still reported more weight loss 
with the high-protein versions (Dong et al. 2013; Santesso et al. 2012). Regarding the longer-
term studies (≥ 1 year), the high-protein diets within the meta-analyses again led to greater 
weight loss and fat mass losses compared to the normal-protein versions (Bueno et al. 2013; 
Clifton et al. 2014). It is important to note, though, that the greater preservation of lean mass 
detected in the shorter-term studies was not found with the longer-term studies. One potential 
reason for these conflicting findings might include the lack of dietary compliance to the longer 
term diets. In general, those that were prescribed a high-protein diet reduced their protein 
intake throughout the study, while the normal-protein diet groups increased their protein 
intake (Bueno et al. 2013; Schwingshackl and Hoffmann 2013; Clifton et al. 2014). Thus, it is

possible that the protein-related effects on weight and fat mass losses occur with a smaller 
increase in protein intake, whereas the preservation of lean mass requires a larger protein 
quantity.    
Protein and appetite regulation 
In terms of assessing the effects of increased protein consumption on the ingestive behavior 
mechanisms, the majority of data originate from tightly-controlled, single-meal, acute studies.  
The outcomes typically include subjective measures of postprandial appetite and satiety (i.e., 
hunger, desire to eat, and fullness) as well as the associated peripheral gut hormones that 
potentially modulate these sensations. The hormones include the hunger-stimulating hormone 
ghrelin and the satiety hormones PYY and GLP-1. A recent systematic review critically examined 
23 studies that compared isocaloric high-protein meals (ranging from 20 – 207 g protein) vs. 
normal-protein meals (ranging from 3 – 66 g protein). The majority (71%) of the studies 
included within the review demonstrated improvements in at least one marker of appetite and 
satiety, typically that of increased postprandial fullness and PYY concentrations, following the 
consumption of high vs. normal-protein meals (Leidy et al. 2015). In addition, several of the 
studies that lacked satiety differences between meals included fairly low quantities of protein 
within the high-protein meals (i.e., <20 g protein), raising the question as to whether a specific 
protein threshold exists. A recent retrospective analysis of several previous studies in which 350 
kcal meals were consumed that contained protein quantities ranging from 15 -30 g protein also 
supports this concept (Paddon-Jones and Leidy 2014). Within these studies, 2-h postprandial 
fullness responses were compared between meals. All meals led to an immediate rise in

fullness; however, the 30 g protein meal elicited a larger (and more sustained) increase in 
postprandial fullness compared to the 15, 20, and 25 g versions. In addition, no differences in 
postprandial fullness were observed between the other protein quantities. Thus, these data 
lend support for a specific within-meal, protein-satiety threshold of approximately 30 g protein 
per eating occasion.   
In addition to the appetitive and hormonal responses, several studies have identified the 
effects of increased protein consumption on the neural signals that modulate central food 
cravings and reward-driven eating behavior. The consumption of high-protein meals containing 
at least 30 g of protein led to greater reductions in select cortico-limbic neural responses to 
food stimuli compared to the consumption of normal-protein meals containing between 15-18 
g protein (Leidy et al. 2011a; Leidy et al. 2013). The brain regions identified (i.e., insula, 
hippocampus, parahippocampus) are those regions associated with food cravings and food 
reward (Van Vugt 2010).   
Collectively, these data support the consumption of higher protein diets (~1.2-1.6 g/kg/d), 
including ~30 g protein per eating occasion, to improve appetite control, satiety, and weight 
management.   
Timing of protein consumption 
Most North Americans are meeting the proposed 30 g per meal protein-satiety threshold at 
lunch and are generally consuming more protein at dinner (Rains et al. 2013). However, the 
average consumption of protein at breakfast is well under this quantity (Rains et al. 2013), and 
as many as 60% of certain age groups skip breakfast altogether (Deshmukh-Taskar et al. 2010; 
Page 11 of 38

ADAF 2010; Food Dive 2013). Since the dietary habit of skipping breakfast is strongly associated 
with weight gain and obesity (Brown et al. 2013), it is critical to explore the combined effects of 
breakfast and increased dietary protein for improvements in weight management. A study that 
assessed the satiating effects of protein when provided at different meal occasions further 
supports the concept of consuming more protein at breakfast (Leidy et al. 2009). The 
consumption of a high-protein breakfast led to greater fullness which extended throughout the 
day and into the evening hours compared to a high-protein lunch or dinner. These data suggest 
that the timing of protein consumption directly influences satiety, with breakfast eliciting 
unique effects.   
Several acute studies have examined the addition of normal-protein vs. high-protein breakfasts 
on appetite control, satiety, and food cravings/reward in individuals who habitually skip 
breakfast (Leidy et al. 2013; Leidy and Racki 2010; Leidy et al. 2011b; Hoertel et al. 2014). When 
compared to skipping breakfast, the consumption of breakfast (in general) led to reductions in 
appetite, increases in fullness, reductions in food cravings, and reductions in the neural signals 
controlling reward-driven eating behavior (Leidy et al. 2013; Leidy and Racki 2010; Leidy et al. 
2011b; Hoertel et al. 2014). However, the consumption of the high-protein breakfast led to 
greater modulations in these responses compared to the normal-protein breakfasts. These 
improvements were accompanied by voluntary reductions in high fat and high sugar evening 
snacking behavior (Leidy et al. 2013; Hoertel et al. 2014)]. These findings were recently 
extended to determine whether a 12-wk breakfast intervention, alone, would beneficially alter 
weight management in those who habitually skip breakfast (Leidy et al. In press). Although no 
differences in weight loss were observed between groups, the high-protein breakfast prevented

13 
 
the gain in fat mass (-0.4±0.5 kg) compared to continuing to skip breakfast (+1.6±0.9 kg, 
p<0.03), whereas the normal-protein breakfast did not prevent fat mass gain (+0.3±0.5 kg). 
Collectively, these data suggest a unique benefit of including ~30 g of protein at the morning 
meal for longer-term improvements in weight management.   
Protein quality and weight management 
It is important to note that the meal and/or diet recommendations for increased protein 
consumption are based upon studies that include high quality, animal-based protein sources.  
The practical significance for including animal proteins stems from the high protein density 
accompanied by the lower energy content of these foods in comparison to plant-based proteins 
(Table 1). Thus, when attempting to adhere to specific energy and macronutrient quantities, 
lean animal sources allow for the greatest protein content with fewer calories. In addition, 
although the data are still somewhat limited, increasing evidence suggests that animal proteins, 
particularly whey protein, promote gains in lean mass through increased skeletal muscle 
protein synthesis and improve appetite control and satiety more so than plant proteins, such as 
soy protein (Hector et al. 2015; Volek et al. 2013; Veldhorst et al. 2009).            
Optimizing adaptations to exercise  
The joint statement from the WHO/FAO/UNU committee on dietary protein (2011) states the 
following, “…the protein requirement of adults can be defined as the minimum intake that will 
allow nitrogen equilibrium (zero nitrogen balance), at an appropriate body composition during 
energy balance [italics added] and at moderate physical activity [italics added]. In practice, the 
nitrogen balance studies… involve studies on healthy adults assumed to be in energy balance,

14 
 
usually on the basis of weight maintenance and of an ‘appropriate’ body composition, but 
without specific measurement to ensure that this was the case [italics added].”  It is important 
to understand just how different the current recommendations for protein intake are from 
what many athletes are engaging in as part of their normal training on a regular basis. Athletes 
are not always in energy balance, maintaining weight, and their body compositions can 
fluctuate substantially, depending on their sport, to what would be considered far from 
‘appropriate’. Thus, as opposed to a minimal level of protein to maintain nitrogen balance, 
athletes are seeking protein intakes to optimize adaptations to their training and achieve peak 
competition in performance (Phillips 2012). To this end, a more appropriate target than 
achieving nitrogen balance would be for an athlete to have an optimally functioning 
musculoskeletal system (bone, muscle, and connective tissues), cardiovascular system, immune 
system, and, for all intents and purposes, an optimal physiological function (Phillips 2012). 
Insofar as muscle is concerned, there is evidence that we may be able to begin to define a more 
‘optimal’ level of protein intake (Phillips 2012; Phillips and van Loon 2011) rather than a 
minimal level that offsets deficiency. A conceptual framework is provided here to help 
practitioners understand how athletes might plan their dietary protein intake to achieve an 
optimal muscle mass, which is a contributor to performance (Phillips 2012; Phillips and van 
Loon 2011). 
Optimal protein intakes for athletes 
Fluctuations in muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB) occur 
with ingestion of protein and are amplified, at least in the case of MPS, by muscle contractions; 
Page 14 of 38

 Draft
15 
 
for a review of this framework the reader is referred to several recent reviews (Churchward-
Venne et al. 2012a; McGlory and Phillips 2014). Changes in MPS are several-fold greater than 
changes in MPB (Churchward-Venne et al. 2012b) in healthy persons and thus a focus of 
research has been on this variable as the primary determinant of changes in muscle mass 
(Phillips 2012). Several studies have now defined the dose-response nature of MPS both at rest 
and after resistance exercise (Moore et al. 2009; Witard et al. 2014) and have shown that the 
level of protein intake at which MPS is maximally stimulated is a per meal (dose) protein intake 
of ~0.25 g/kg/meal in young men (Moore et al. 2015). The level for younger women has not 
been experimentally determined, but given that young men and women respond very similarly 
to hyperaminoacidemia and hyperinsulinemia (Smith et al. 2009) and loading (West et al. 2012), 
it is proposed that there would not likely be much difference in that estimate of protein intake 
to maximize the stimulation of MPS in young women. Adding two standard deviations to the 
estimated average intake 0.25 g/kg/meal (Moore et al. 2015) gives an estimated intake of 0.4 
g/kg/meal, which would provide for some margin for inter-individual error and the fact that the 
per meal estimates derived from this work were for isolated proteins. When consumed as a 
mixed meal, protein digestion would be, relative to isolated proteins, delayed (Bos et al. 1999) 
and the ensuing aminoacidemia (Burke et al. 2012) would definitely affect MPS (Bos et al. 
2003).  
The period of time during which athletes would be in negative protein balance would be 
overnight, when no periodic feeding takes place (Groen et al. 2012; Res et al. 2012). One study 
has provided evidence, however, that pre-sleep ingestion of protein (at a dose of ~0.55 g/kg) 
resulted in a greater overnight MPS (Res et al. 2012). While impractical for athletes, it has also

been shown that intra-gastric protein infusion while sleeping stimulated MPS in elderly men 
(Groen et al. 2012). The acute results from these studies have been shown to have some 
relevance in a recently published study from Snijders et al. (2015) in which it was reported that 
habitual consumption of a pre-sleep supplement that provided 27.5 g protein (~0.36 g/kg) and 
15 g carbohydrate versus a non-caloric placebo resulted in greater hypertrophy in the 
supplemented group. The conclusion that it was the pre-sleep timing of the protein beverage in 
that study requires further study, however, since the control group was not supplemented with 
protein and thus the supplemented group had a higher total protein intake of ~0.6 g/kg/d. 
Protein quality and muscle protein synthesis 
The quality of protein has, in some circumstances, been shown to be a factor in determining the 
MPS response after exercise [for review see (Phillips 2014)]. In general, it appears that proteins 
that are higher in leucine content, which are quite rapidly digested, provide a good stimulus for 
MPS (Phillips 2014). Thus, targeting a leucine content on a per meal basis has been suggested as 
a variable beyond simply protein content as being an important consideration for stimulating 
MPS (Layman et al. 2015). There is also the suggestion that more slowly digested proteins such 
as casein or egg may allow for the prolongation of the MPS response by maintaining 
hyperaminoacidemia (Reitelseder et al. 2010). Thus, protein blends containing milk proteins 
(whey and casein) or milk proteins combined with soy proteins (Reidy et al. 2013) for example 
would be expected to be more effective. A claim for superiority of such blends is not possible 
based on the evidence to date, however, which shows that (on a leucine-matched basis) there 
is an equivalent MPS response with isolated versus blended proteins (Reidy et al. 2013).

Meal planning for athletes 
With a per meal dose of protein defined a meal plan can be formulated. Table 2 gives a protein 
per meal plan that targets protein intakes at levels designed to maximally stimulate MPS. While 
the optimal timing between the meals throughout the day is not completely clear at this time 
there is evidence supporting a 3-4 h refractory period, rather than shorter or longer periods of 
time. What is also unknown is how many times a person could consume a meal on a daily basis 
to elicit this optimal pattern of stimulating MPS. However, it is proposed that it would be 
unlikely that more than 3-4 meals per day would be optimal and, admittedly, that less meal 
feedings may also be able to provide an adequate stimulus for MPS. Nonetheless, there are 
considerations for other macronutrients (in particular carbohydrates), workout timing, fuelling, 
and hydration that would have be considered for athletes so pragmatic rules may trump 
optimal recommendations. Considering a breakfast, lunch, dinner, pre-bed pattern Table 2 
provides some guidance for protein intakes in athletes to optimize their MPS response. 
Health Impacts 
The most often-cited/held beliefs regarding higher protein are that higher protein intakes lead 
to renal failure and/or results in reduced bone health. Evidence-based analyses of these beliefs 
shows, however, that neither has a foundation. The response to an increase in dietary protein 
intake in those with normal renal function is actually an increase in glomerular filtration rate 
(Schwingshackl and Hoffman, 2014). In the most recent round of discussions in setting the 
Dietary Reference Intakes, the Institute of Medicine concluded, “Correlation of creatinine 
clearance with protein intake showed a [positive] linear relationship… suggesting that the low

protein intake itself decreased renal function. These factors point to the conclusion that the 
protein content of the diet is not responsible for the progressive decline in kidney function with 
age. (p. 842)” (Institute of Medicine, 2005). In addition, From the WHO/FAO report on protein 
requirements, the following summarizes the views from that expert consultation “… 
symptomatic renal failure does not result from the physiological decrease in glomerular 
filtration rate that occurs with age, because symptoms do not occur until the glomerular 
filtration rate has decreased much more than occurs with ageing. Moreover, protein restriction 
lowers glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that the decline of glomerular filtration rate with 
age is a natural consequence of the decline in protein intake as age progresses, and is unrelated 
to deterioration of renal function. (p. 224)” (WHO Technical Report Series 935, 2011). Thus, 
statements linking a decline in renal function to consumption of a higher protein diet are belief- 
and not evidence-based. 
Simply stated, the acid-ash hypothesis posits that diets with higher protein and grain 
foods, with a low potassium intake, produce a greater dietary acid load (Fenton et al, 2009). 
The increase in net urinary acid excretion, increases urinary calcium excretion, and subsequent 
release of calcium from the skeleton. As Fenton et al (2009) have pointed out, the linear 
association between changes in calcium excretion in response to experimental changes in net 
acid excretion is not evidence that the source of the excreted calcium is bone or that this 
calciuria contributes to the development of osteoporosis. Evidence-based analysis using the 
application of Hill’s criteria for causality showed clearly that, “A causal association between 
dietary acid load and osteoporotic bone disease is not supported by evidence…” (Fenton et al, 
2011). It has in fact been suggested that dietary protein is a nutrient that is supportive of bone

health due, but this is only the case when calcium intakes are adequate (Mangano et al, 2014). 
Thus, we propose, as reviewed in several recent publications recommending greater protein 
intakes (≥ 1.2 g/kg/day) for older persons (Bauer et al, 2013; Deutz et al, 2014), there is no 
evidence supportive of higher protein intakes leading to renal failure and/or poor bone health. 
Conclusion 
Substantial evidence indicates that protein intakes higher than the current RDA can be an 
important strategy to help promote healthy aging, weight management, and athletic 
performance. Protein quality, per meal dose and timing are also important considerations in 
practice. Current evidence suggests that intakes of high quality protein in the range of 1.2-1.6 
g/kg/day is a more ideal target to achieve optimal health outcomes in adults. 
  
Take-home points: 
• Because of anabolic resistance, sedentary lifestyles and common illnesses, older adults 
need higher protein intakes (≥1.2 g/kg/d) to help prevent age-related sarcopenia. 
• Including a high quality protein source at breakfast, the meal generally containing the 
least protein, is a simple and pragmatic approach to increase intakes in older adults, and 
has also been shown to reduce unhealthy snacking behavior in younger individuals.   
• The consumption of higher protein diets (~1.2-1.6 g/kg/d), including ~30 g protein per 
eating occasion, improves appetite control, satiety, and weight management.

• Athletes appear to benefit from protein intakes as much as 2x the RDA, with a per meal 
dose of about 0.4 g/kg/meal consumed 3 to 4 times per day. Meal planning should be 
centred around post-exercise protein provision to amplify the protein synthetic 
response. 
• High quality protein from animal-based sources (e.g. milk, meat, poultry, and eggs) 
provide a concentrated source of essential amino acids, including leucine, to maximize 
muscle protein synthesis, with relatively few calories compared to plant-based protein 
sources.

Table 2. Protein intakes in an athlete (80 kg male swimmer, 1.9 m) consuming the 
recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein in a typical ‘skewed’ fashion versus an 
‘optimal’ protein intake in a ‘balanced’ fashion. 
 
 
This swimmer, based on weekly total volume of 30 km (training 6 d/wk), would have an 
estimated daily energy expenditure of ~14 MJ/d. * Based on available data from Groen et al. 
(2012) and Snijders et al. (2015).
