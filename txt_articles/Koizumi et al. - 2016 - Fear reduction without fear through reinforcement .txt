 disorder (PTSD)2,3. Fear memories can be reduced by counter-conditioning, in which fear 
conditioned stimuli (CS+) are repeatedly reinforced with reward4 or with novel non-
threatening stimuli5. However, this procedure involves explicit presentations of CS+, which 
is itself aversive before fear is successfully reduced. This aversiveness may be a problem 
when trying to translate such experimental paradigms into clinical settings6. It also raises the 
fundamental question as to whether explicit presentations of feared objects is necessary for 
fear reduction1. While learning without explicit stimulus presentation has been previously 
demonstrated7–10, whether fear can be reduced while avoiding the explicit exposure to CS+ 
remains largely unknown. One recently developed approach employs an implicit method to 
induce learning by reinforcing stimulus-specific neural representations using real-time 
decoding of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals11,12,13, in 
the absence of stimulus presentation; i.e. pairing rewards with the occurrences of multi-
voxel brain activity patterns matching a specific stimulus (decoded fMRI neurofeedback: 
DecNef11,13). It has been shown that participants exhibit perceptual learning for a specific 
visual stimulus feature through DecNef, without giving any strategy for induction of specific 
neural representations, and without awareness of the content of reinforced neural 
representations11. Here, we examined whether a similar approach can be applied to counter-
conditioning of fear (Figure 1a–e). We show that we can reduce fear towards CS+ by pairing 
rewards with the activation patterns in visual cortex representing a CS+, while participants 
remain unaware of the content and purpose of the procedure. This procedure may be an 
initial step towards novel treatments for fear-related disorders such as phobia and PTSD, via 
unconscious processing.
In the experiment (Figure 1a), participants first acquired fear response to two visual stimuli 
(Target CS+ and Control CS+) in the Acquisition session, and went through the three daily 
sessions of Neural Reinforcement by DecNef during which only the activation patterns for 
Target CS+ were reinforced to reduce its associated fear, without physical presentations of 
the Target CS+. On the subsequent day, participants were presented with two CS+s and their 
fear response was measured in the Test session. The details of these sessions are as follows:
In the Acquisition session, pavlovian aversive conditioning was performed in 17 healthy 
participants by pairing two visual cues (CS+) with uncomfortable but tolerable electrical 
shocks (Figure 1a). The CS+s were visual stimuli - vertical gratings of different colors (red 
and green), allowing them to be distinguished by multi-voxel pattern decoding in the visual 
cortex, V1/V2. Unbeknownst to the participant, one of the two CS+s was designated as 
Target CS+, meaning we intended to have its associated fear level subsequently reduced via 
DecNef. The other CS+ was designated as the Control CS+, as baseline comparison. The 
choice of stimuli was based on a previous study using similar procedures13. Towards the end 
of Acquisition (Figure 1a–d), both CS+s induced elevated skin conductance responses 
(SCR) in comparison to an unreinforced cue (CS−), indicating successful conditioning of 
fear (Figure 2a, Figure S1).
The activation patterns discriminating the Target and non-target Control CS+s were 
determined by conventional multivariate decoding in another session (i.e., the fMRI session 
for MVPA, see Supplementary Method) before the Acquisition session (mean of decoding 
accuracy estimated with leave-one out cross validation; 72.1% ± 9.2 s.d.), so that the

 likelihood that Target CS+ is represented in V1/V2 activation patterns could be calculated in 
real-time during the subsequent Neural Reinforcement sessions.
In the three daily Neural Reinforcement sessions (Figure 1e), participants viewed achromatic 
visual gratings. They were asked to use any mental strategy they liked to try and increase the 
diameter of a disc on a monitor to earn monetary reward. They were unaware that the 
diameter reflected how the multi-voxel patterns reflected those induced by the Target CS+ in 
the visual cortex. The likelihood of occurrence of Target CS+ pattern was associated with 
magnitude of reward, leading to counter-conditioning for Target CS+4. We hypothesized this 
would reduce the ability of Target CS+ to elicit fear responses, relative to the Control CS+.
On Day 1 of the Neural Reinforcement session, the occurrence of Target CS+ pattern was 
around chance level (50.2± s.e. 4.1%; t(16)=.05, P=.96, two-tailed). Subsequently, Target CS
+ likelihood exceeded chance level on Day 2 (58.9±3.1%) and Day 3 (57.2±3.3%) 
(t(16)=2.89, P=.01, t(16)=2.20, P=.04, respectively), providing evidence of successful 
DecNef of the Target CS+ pattern. The effect of day was significant (ANOVA; F(2, 
15)=3.62, P=.038), which was primarily due to the increase of Target CS+ likelihood from 
Day 1 to Day 2 (P=.089, Bonferroni-corrected). Importantly, although the overall likelihood 
of Target CS+ occurrence was modest, over the 3 days there was a sufficiently large 
variability in the trial-wise induction likelihood within each participant (across-participant 
mean of SD for the likelihood, 45.1%). Therefore participants were exposed to a full range 
of contingency between the induction likelihood and its corresponding reward, which is 
critical for the facilitation of reinforcement learning. More detailed progress of the 
occurrence of Target CS+ pattern is shown in Figure S2.
Post-experimental questionnaire confirmed that participants remained unaware of the 
association between the disc’s diameter and occurrence of Target CS+ representation, and 
did not consciously use strategies related to color or grating (i.e. appropriate imagery-based 
strategies, Table S1). Neither were they able to guess the identity of the Target CS+ vs 
Control CS+ in a forced choice question afterwards (62.5% accuracy, Chi-square test; χ2= .
780, P = .377). This result is in agreement with the previous studies using a similar DecNef 
procedure11,13. Furthermore, there were also no reports of subjective fear during the Neural 
Reinforcement session (Table S1), and SCR responses during these sessions were 
significantly less when compared to those associated with the CS+s at the end of Acquisition 
(t(16)=4.218, P=.001), and did not correlate with induced Target CS+ pattern likelihood 
(Figure 2b&c).
Next, during the Test session, four unsignaled shocks (USs) were presented to reactivate the 
fear memory (i.e., reinstatement. Figure 1a) to assess potential fear reduction for the Target 
CS+14. Given that the Test session was performed several days after Acquisition, this 
reinstatement procedure helped to ensure observable fear responses for the baseline 
condition (i.e. Control CS+), to allow for a meaningful comparison. During the Test session, 
the two CS+s and the CS− were presented alone to evaluate the associated fear response 
(SCR). Critically, we found that the SCR to Target CS+ was significantly reduced when 
compared to the Control CS+ (t(16)=2.630, P=.018, paired t-test, two-tailed) (Figure 2a, 
Figure S1), suggesting that fear towards the CS+ was reduced only when it went through the

 DecNef procedure, where occurrence of the Target CS+ was paired with reward, effectively 
counter-conditioning the previously acquired fear. Interestingly, the magnitude of this effect 
was similar to what was observed following conventional extinction procedures15,16, even 
though the underlying mechanism may be different, not least as participants were unaware 
of the occurrence of Target CS+ representations during Neural Reinforcement.
We also recorded fMRI responses during the Acquisition and Test sessions, focusing in 
particular on responses in the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), 
which have been implicated in acquisition and extinction of fear memory17,18. The 
amygdala showed significant responses after conditioning for both CS+s, but a significant 
reduction in response to the Target CS+ compared to Control CS+ in the Test session (Figure 
3a), mirroring the specific pattern of fear reduction seen in the SCRs. VMPFC responses 
were significantly negative for both CS+s during Acquisition as previously shown16,17,19, 
but significantly less positive during Neural Reinforcement and Test sessions for the Target 
CS+ (Figure 3b). While responses in the amygdala and VMPFC were reduced for the Target 
CS+ following the Neural Reinforcement sessions, during these sessions the trial-wise 
response level in these regions did not correlate with the likelihood of Target CS+ induction, 
suggesting that fear memory was not strongly reactivated by the spontaneous occurrence of 
Target CS+ patterns in the visual cortex (Figure S3). The average responses in V1/V2 were 
similar between Target and Control CS+s both before and after the Neural Reinforcement 
sessions (Figure S4), undermining the possibility that the differential responses in the 
amygdala and VMPFC for the two CS+s during the Test session were merely due to the 
altered visual processing for Target CS+.
Although the likelihood of Target CS+ occurrence was estimated selectively from the 
activation patterns in V1/V2 during the Neural Reinforcement sessions, it remains unclear 
whether such information reflecting Target CS+ was confined to V1/V2 or other brain 
regions were also engaged to act in concert with V1/V2. To examine whether any brain 
regions outside the visual cortex were engaged, we conducted the whole-brain searchlight 
multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)20, which quantitatively measures the degree to which 
the activation patterns of other brain areas could predict the likelihood that the Target CS+ 
patterns were induced in V1/V2. Such predictability of the Target CS+ likelihood in V1/V2 
would reflect the “information transmission” from V1/V2 to other areas11,13. For more 
detailed advantages of this approach, see Supplementary Method. Specifically, the 
searchlight MVPA estimated the degree to which the trial-by-trial induction likelihood of 
Target CS+ in V1/V2 can be reconstructed from the multi-voxel patterns within a spherical 
region of interest (ROI) (radius=15 mm) centered at each voxel (see Supplementary 
Method). The analysis revealed that the Target CS+ likelihood (i.e., likelihood of red or 
green grating) was transmitted to many visual areas during the fMRI session for MVPA 
when the red and green gratings were physically presented (Figure 4a), but it was largely 
confined within V1/V2 during the Neural Reinforcement sessions, with a few exceptions 
(Figure 4b). In particular, the striatal area (caudate nucleus) had significant information 
transmission from V1/V2, in keeping with its possible role in reinforcement learning21,22. 
Such engagement of the striatal area was further supported by a Psychophysiological 
Interaction (PPI) analysis23 showing enhanced functional connectivity between V1/V2 and 
striatum, as a function of the increase of Target CS+ likelihood in V1/V2 (Supplementary

 Method, Figure S6). These results suggest that, besides the visual cortex where Target CS+ 
was induced, the striatal area was engaged to some extent in the Neural Reinforcement 
sessions.
Previous studies with conventional extinction procedures have shown a role of VMPFC for 
successful extinction17,18. Yet, the aforementioned searchlight analysis revealed no 
significant information transmission from V1/V2 to VMPFC, suggesting that VMPFC may 
not be actively engaged in DecNef on average within the participants group. Moreover, 
across participants the degree to which VMPFC patterns predicted V1/V2 patterns 
(‘information transmission’) was negatively correlated with the success of fear reduction 
(Spearman’s rho=−.522, P=.034; Figure 4c), suggesting that there was less VMPFC 
engagement for participants with more successful fear reduction. These results, as well as 
the whole brain analysis examining the correlation between information transmission and 
fear reduction (Figure S5), suggest that VMPFC disengagement may have led to larger 
reduction of fear. Thus, our results are consistent with the view that the fear reduction 
observed here depended on a possibly different mechanism in comparison to that of the 
conventional extinction procedures18 (see Discussion for details).
To summarize, we here provide behavioural and neurophysiological evidence that rewards 
can be directly paired with the patterns of neural activity in visual cortex to facilitate the 
reduction of fear. This DecNef procedure bypasses the requirement for physical visual 
presentation of a CS. As such, the procedure represents direct counter-conditioning of neural 
activity based on the fluctuations of the information content in the visual cortex activity. The 
results show that counter-conditioning of visual cortical-based fear is sufficient to bring 
about the reduction of behavioural and amygdalar fear responses, even in the absence of the 
participants’ awareness of the content of neural induction and purpose of the 
procedure11,13,24.
The pattern of activity in VMPFC contrasts with that observed in conventional studies of 
extinction, whereby it typically exhibits enhanced responses to extinguished fear cues16,17. 
In conventional extinction, fear memory is thought to be inhibited by extinction learning of a 
context-specific ‘safety’ state, mediated by VMPFC, via the exertion of an inhibitory 
influence on amygdala-based fear memories16,17. Similarly, in counter-conditioning, 
presenting rewards in place of previously paired aversive outcomes reduces conditional fear 
by a putatively similar inhibitory mechanism4. The fact that we see reduced VMPFC activity 
in association with reduced fear response for Target CS+ (Figure 3b) suggests that the 
mechanism of fear reduction demonstrated here may differ from conventional extinction 
procedures16,17,19. This is further supported by the fact that greater interaction between the 
visual cortex and VMPFC during the Neural Reinforcement sessions as measured by 
“information transmission” is associated with less fear reduction (Figure 4c, Figure S5).
Given that successful fear reduction requires VMPFC involvement during conventional 
extinction training18, this result hints at the possibility that VMPFC disengagement may be a 
key to the success of our procedure19. Consistent with this view, some previous studies have 
also suggested that disengagement of VMPFC could in some cases counterintuitively lead to 
more robust extinction of fear. For example, a human lesion study has shown that VMPFC

 damage prevents development of PTSD after traumatic experiences25, implying robust fear 
extinction. Similarly, infant rats achieve more robust fear extinction than adult rats despite 
that infant rats do not rely on the medial prefrontal areas including an area homologous to 
the human VMPFC26. Such VMPFC disengagement may have made the effect of DecNef 
robust, potentially making the fear reduction effect to be context-invariant (See Figure S7).
Although the exact neural mechanism underlying this neural counter-conditioning procedure 
still remains to be further elucidated, it is likely to critically involve the striatum, an area 
implicated in reinforcement learning21,22. During the Neural Reinforcement sessions, 
occurrence of Target CS+ in V1/V2 could be predicted from the activation patterns of 
striatum, mainly caudate nucleus (Figure 4b). Similarly, the functional coupling between 
V1/V2 and striatum was modulated by the occurrence of Target CS+ in V1/V2 (Figure S6). 
Activation in striatal areas has been found in previous studies on neurofeedback training27, 
which suggests that neurofeedback procedures in general may rely to some extent on striatal 
reinforcement.
While this is the first human study to show that fear can be reduced by directly pairing 
reward with the induced activation patterns for CS+ in visual cortex, an animal study has 
previously shown that pairing reward with the optogenetically reactivated hippocampal 
traces of a fear conditioned location (i.e., CS+) could reduce the associated fear response10. 
The study further showed that, after the optogenetic reactivation, the hippocampal memory 
trace lost its ability to activate the previously associated amygdala neurons. Similarly in the 
current study, reinforcing the Target CS+ pattern in visual cortex may have weakened its 
previously acquired fear association with amygdala, resulting in reduction of amygdala 
response to the physically presented Target CS+ (Figure 3a).
Overall, the fear reduction effect achieved with the DecNef procedures appears robust, as it 
tolerated the challenge provided by reinstatement to reactivate fear memory14. Tolerance of 
the fear reduction effect to such a challenge is ecologically meaningful as it may capture 
resistance to relapse of fear in real life fear memories14. Here we used reinstatement 
primarily to allow a sufficient magnitude of fear response after the multiple days of training 
period, but in principle it would be interesting to look at the effect on the fear response 
without reinstatement. From a theoretical perspective, showing fear reduction both with and 
without reinstatement would allow better clarification as to whether fear reduction was 
driven primarily by an inhibition of the original memory14. As fear reduction effects are 
often weakened after reinstatement28–31, it is likely that the observed fear reduction effect 
would have been still present even if tested without reinstatement, but future studies could 
directly investigate this.
Our current findings may eventually benefit clinical treatments of fear related disorders. 
From a translational perspective, the traditional application of fear extinction to anxiety-
related disorders faces several challenges. One difficulty in applying traditional associative 
learning concepts to exposure therapy is that some participants may not comply with explicit 
encounters with feared objects in the first place6, because of their intrinsic aversiveness. 
Here, the induction of brain patterns are not accompanied by conscious awareness of the 
relevant content, and so this may alleviate the problem of patient attrition. However, to

 achieve this ultimate goal, one needs to pass several technical hurdles. For instance, for 
ecological validity, one would need to develop procedures to decode images with rich real-
life content, and the learning of the relevant multi-voxel patterns for individual patients 
would also need to be done without conscious presentation to the patients. These may be 
overcome by building decoders with subliminal presentation, or adapting them from other 
individuals’ brain activity32. Despite these challenges, the present results hopefully represent 
an initial step towards a potential new avenue for treatment.
Methods
The entire experiment consisted of the five main sessions (Figure 1a), Acquisition, Neural 
Reinforcement x 3, and Test, which were conducted after the two preparatory sessions, 
Retinotopy, and fMRI session for MVPA. All sessions were conducted on different days 
separated by at least 24 hrs. All of the experiments were conducted with fMRI measurement.
Participants
Twenty-four participants (15 males, 23.2±2.5 years old) were initially enrolled. Seven 
participants were eliminated prior to participating in Neural Reinforcement session because 
six of them failed to show measurable fear response (see Acquisition session) and one 
participant did not complete Acquisition session due to excessive anxiety. The remaining 17 
participants (11 males, 23.5±2.8 mean years old) completed all experimental sessions. We 
predetermined the number of participants to complete all the sessions based on our pilot 
study. Participants gave a written consent prior to participating in each session. The study 
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of ATR, Japan.
Retinotopy session
We first conducted a standard retinotopic mapping experiment to localize V1/V2 in each 
participant33 (see Supplementary Information for complete method).
fMRI session for MVPA
The aim of the fMRI session for MVPA was to obtain fMRI data for constructing a decoder 
to classify the activation patterns in V1/V2 (see Retinotopy session) evoked by isoluminant 
red versus green vertical gratings (Figure 1b), which were to serve as the CS+s in the 
subsequent Acquisition session. The decoder was used in the following Neural 
Reinforcement sessions to evaluate the trial-by-trial likelihood that participants could induce 
brain activation patterns for Target CS+ (red or green grating, counterbalanced across 
participants). During this session each trial consisted of a fixation disc (6 sec), followed by a 
grating which flickered at 0.5 Hz (6 sec total).
The preprocessed fMRI signals from the localized V1/V2 subregions were then used to 
construct a decoder to classify the activation patterns for red versus green grating (see 
Supplementary Information). We used sparse logistic regression (SLR)34 to automatically 
select the voxels that were relevant for classification. We trained the decoder using 192 data 
points obtained from 192 trials (across all 12 fMRI runs).

 Acquisition session
The aim of the Acquisition session was to establish fear memory for red and green gratings 
(conditioned stimulus, CS+) by pairing them with an uncomfortable but tolerable electric 
shock (unconditioned stimulus, US). These two gratings were identical to the fMRI session 
for MVPA. A grating with novel color (blue or yellow) was introduced as CS−, which was 
never paired with US. The choice of color for CS− was counterbalanced across participant in 
orthogonal to the choice of color for Target CS+ (red or green) (e.g., approximately half of 
the participants with green Target CS+ were assigned blue CS−, while the other half 
participants were assigned yellow CS−). With such counterbalancing, we avoided the 
situation where the activation patterns for CS− would be always more similar to one of CS+s 
(e.g., Target) than to the other CS+ (e.g., Control). The experimenter was not blind to the 
color assignments in the Acquisition session and the subsequent sessions, as the handling 
with blindness was difficult due to the complexity of our procedures. Two CS+s were 
presented either with or without US (5 and 8 times, respectively), and CS− was always 
presented without US (8 times)19. Trial order was randomized. Each trial started with a 
presentation of a CS (4 sec) followed by a fixation disc (12 sec). On trials with US, a CS+ 
co-terminated with a burst of electric shocks (36 impulses across 200ms total). Skin 
conductance response (SCR) was recorded using BrainAmp Ag/AgCl sintered MR 
electrodes (Brain Products) attached to the distal phalanges of index and middle fingers of 
right hand. Among twenty-four participants who completed Acquisition session, six 
participants were excluded because no SCR was detected for the CS+s. Another participant 
did not complete Acquisition session due to excessive anxiety. The remaining 17 participants 
proceeded to the subsequent sessions. To estimate fear response in late Acquisition, we 
calculated the mean SCR during the last 2 trials for each CS (Figure 2a, left panel).
Neural Reinforcement session
The Neural Reinforcement sessions were conducted for three consecutive days. The aim of 
the session was to repetitively induce V1/V2 activation patterns for one of the CS+s (red, 
N=9; green, N=8) without participants’ awareness of the induced Target CS+. We reinforced 
participants with monetary reward for inducing the patterns for one of the CS+s, given the 
capacity of reward to reinforce behaviour35 as well as neural activity36. Participants were not 
attached to an electrode for electric shock.
Each trial had a sequence of an induction period (6 sec), a fixation period (7 sec), a feedback 
period (1 sec), and an inter-trial interval (6 sec) (Figure 1e). During the induction period, 
participants were instructed to somewhat regulate their brain activity so as to maximize the 
size of white disc which served as feedback. Feedback was presented after 6 sec of the 
fixation period following the induction period. In the induction period, a gray vertical 
grating was presented. The gray grating flickered at 0.5 Hz (6 sec total; three repetitions of a 
grating (1.5 sec) and a fixation (0.5 sec)). Participants were not informed as to what the 
feedback disc size represented (i.e., Target CS+ likelihood in V1/V2).
V1/V2 activation pattern during the induction period was analyzed online to estimate the 
likelihood that the currently achieved brain activation patterns represented the patterns for

 Target CS+ (red or green) that were previously decoded from the fMRI session for MVPA. 
Hemodynamic delay of 6 s was taken into account.
Test session
A day after the last day of the Neural Reinforcement session, we conducted the Test session 
to measure fear responses to Target CS+, Control CS+, and CS−. Based on our preliminary 
studies, we presented four unsignaled USs before the Test session to activate the fear 
memory (i.e., Reinstatement) in a similar manner as a previous study19. Following 
reinstatement, each CS was presented for 11 times in a semi-randomized order: CS− was 
always presented on the first trial to capture irrelevant SCR due to orienting effect19. Data of 
this first CS− was discarded from the subsequent analyses. A trial sequence was identical to 
Acquisition session, except that there was no trial with US. SCR was recorded in the same 
manner as in the Acquisition session.
MRI parameters
Participants were scanned in a 3T MRI scanner (Trio, Siemens) with a head coil at the ATR 
Brain Activation Imaging Center. See supplementary method for more detailed parameters.
Definition of ROIs
Along with SCR, we measured response in the amygdala and VMPFC to track the fear 
related activity in these areas with fMRI. To determine the amygdala ROI, we first defined 
anatomical boundary of the amygdala with freesurfer segmentation, and selected voxels 
within this anatomical boundary that showed greater response for all US trials and the last 2 
trials of each CS+ (i.e., fear relevant trials) relative to fixation during the Acquisition 
session. To define the VMPFC ROI, we first created an anatomical mask of a sphere with 15 
mm radius centered around previously reported MNI coordinates [0, 40, −12]37, which was 
estimated based on the representative literature16,17,38. We then selected voxels within the 
sphere ROI that showed smaller response for all US trials and the last 2 trials of each CS+ 
relative to fixation during the Acquisition session, which was the expected direction of 
activity based on previous literature19. Caudate and ventral striatum were defined using FSL 
Structural Striatal Atlas40.

 Figure 1. 
Overall experimental design. a) After retinotopy and the fMRI session for MVPA (see 
Supplementary Method), participants went through 5 days of main experimental sessions in 
the MRI scanner. b) The stimuli used as CSs were colored vertical grating patterns, with 
choice of colors (red and green) for Target CS+ and Control CS+ counterbalanced across 
participants. A choice of color (blue or yellow) for CS− was also counterbalanced across 
participants. c) Timeline for a single trial in the Acquisition or Test session. In an 
Acquisition trial, both Target and Control CS+s (red/green) were paired with US (electric 
shock). d) CS+s were paired with the co-terminating US during Acquisition at the 
contingency rate of 38%. e) During a Neural Reinforcement trial, participants were required 
to somehow regulate their brain activity, upon seeing a gray vertical grating (Induction cue). 
The size of the disc during the feedback period indicated the online-calculated likelihood of 
the Target CS+ patterns in V1/V2. The disc size was proportional to the amount of monetary 
reward earned.

 Figure 2. 
Reduction of fear response as measured by SCR. a) In late Acquisition (last 2 trials), 
participants developed positive responses for both Target and Control CS+. During the 
Neural Reinforcement session (middle panel), such responses were lower than those 
associated with the CS+s at the end of Acquisition (t(16)=4.218, P=.001). In early Test (first 
2 trials; see Figure 1a), response to Target CS+ was reduced compared to Control CS+ 
(t(16)=2.630, P=.018, paired t-test, two-tailed). b) During Neural Reinforcement, trial-wise 
correlation between SCR and induction likelihood (i.e. degree to which activity in V1/V2 
resembled the multi-voxel pattern for Target CS+) was negligible, indicating that induced 
Target CS+ did not lead to fear response. Shown are scatter plots of a representative 
participant, where each dot represents a single induction trial. c) Plotted is the Fisher-

Brain activity in the amygdala and VMPFC. Same labeling as in Figure 2a except the 
dependent measure here is the average level of activity (arbitrary unit) in the amygdala (a) 
and VMPFC (b). a) Amygdala activity was reduced for Target CS+ compared with Control 
CS+ (t(16)=2.21, P=.042; two-tailed) in early Test. b) VMPFC activity was reduced for 
Target CS+ relative to Control CS+ (t(16)=2.13, P=.049; two-tailed) in early Test. While 
activity in the amygdala and VMPFC numerically decreased across the three days of the 
Neural Reinforcement sessions (middle panels of a&b, respectively), these decreases were 
not significant (P=.076, P=.329, respectively). Error bars represent standard errors. Please 
also see Figure S3.

 Figure 4. 
Engagement of striatum (b) and disengagement of VMPFC (c) during Neural 
Reinforcement. a) Whole-brain searchlight MVPA quantitatively evaluated information 
transmission from V1/V2 to the whole brain, during the fMRI session for MVPA. 
Information transmission was estimated as the correlation between the Target CS+ 
likelihood in V1/V2 and its reconstructed value obtained from the multi-voxel patterns 
within each searchlight sphere ROI (radius=15 mm). Information was transmitted mostly 
within, although not confined to, many visual areas. This result ensures the sensitivity and 
power of the whole-brain searchlight MVPA to detect information transmission outside 
V1/V2, if there is any. b) Whole-brain MVPA during the Neural Reinforcement sessions. 
Overall, information transmission from V1/V2 was mostly confined to the early visual 
cortex. However, there was a notable transmission to striatum, mostly caudate, consistent 
with its role in reinforcement learning21,22. A white circle highlights the significant 
information transmission in striatum. In a&b, Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient for 
the significant voxels are shown (P<0.05; multiple corrections with permutation 
procedure41). c) Disengagement of VMPFC and successful fear reduction. Less information 
transmission between V1/V2 and VMPFC during Neural Reinforcement was related with 
larger reduction of SCR (Control CS+ - Target CS+) in early Test (Spearman’s rho=−.522, 
P=.034). Each data point corresponds to each participant. Solid line represents a least-square 
regression line. See also Figure S5.
