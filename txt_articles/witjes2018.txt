Abstract
Background: The highly frequent strategy of surveillance for non–muscle-invasive bladder
cancer (NMIBC) involves cystoscopy and cytology. Urine assays currently available have not
shown performance sufficient to replace the current gold standard for follow-up, which would
require a very high negative predictive value (NPV), especially for high-grade tumors. Bladder
EpiCheck (BE) is a novel urine assay that uses 15 proprietary DNA methylation biomarkers to
assess the presence of bladder cancer.
Objective: To assess the performance of BE for NMIBC recurrence.
Design, setting, and participants: This was a blinded, single-arm, prospective multicenter
study. The inclusion criteria were age �22 yr, urothelial carcinoma (UC) being monitored
cystoscopically at 3-mo intervals, all UC resected within 12 mo, able to produce 10 ml of urine,
and able to consent.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The BE test characteristics were calculated
and compared to cytology and cystoscopy results confirmed by pathology.
Results and limitations: Out of 440 patients recruited, 353 were eligible for the performance
analysis. Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value were 68.2%, 88.0%,
95.1%, and 44.8%, respectively. Excluding low-grade (LG) Ta recurrences, the sensitivity was
91.7% and NPV was 99.3%. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with
and without LG Ta lesions was 0.82 and 0.94, respectively.
Conclusions: In follow-up of NMIBC patients, the BE test showed an overall high NPV of 95.1%,
and 99.3% when excluding LG Ta recurrences. With high specificity of 88.0%, the test could be
incorporated in NMIBC follow-up since high-grade recurrences would be instantly detected
with high confidence. Thus, the current burden of repeat cystoscopies and cytology tests could
be reduced.
Patient summary: The Bladder EpiCheck urine test has a clinically relevant and high negative
predictive value. Its use in clinical routine could reduce the number of follow-up cystoscopies,
and thus associated patient and financial burdens.

Introduction
For decades, urinary tests have been studied for the
detection of bladder tumors. However, most of these tests
have not been implemented in clinical practice because of
cost issues, practical aspects, or insufficient sensitivity or
specificity as compared to the gold standard [1]. Conse-
quently, in patients for whom a bladder tumor is suspected,
cystoscopy or ultrasound imaging is usually performed
rather than relying on a urinary test. In follow-up, however,
the situation may be different. Missing an asymptomatic
low-risk recurrence that can be subsequently picked up by
the next cystoscopy appears to be safe and costs-effective,
decreases the patient burden, and meets their requirements
[2,3]. This would require a test with a high negative
predictive value (NPV) at least for high-risk tumors.
In the last couple of years, new markers have been
developed and tested, including DNA methylation markers,
amongst others. DNA methylation alters gene expression
without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Typically,
there is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and
hypomethylation of oncogenes [4]. DNA methylation in
bladder cancer has been described, and validated to be
related to progression of primary pTaG1/2 bladder tumors
to muscle-invasive disease [5]. Methylation was even
reported as being useful in hematuria patients for reducing
diagnostic cystoscopies [6].
The Bladder EpiCheck test analyzes 15 methylation
biomarkers and determines whether this pattern is consis-
tent with bladder cancer presence or absence. The validation
study [7] showed 90% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and NPV of
97% among 222 NMIBC patients undergoing surveillance.
The primary objective of the current study was to
determine
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
Bladder
EpiCheck for patients undergoing surveillance for recurrent
bladder cancer. The sensitivity and specificity of the test
were compared to a prespecified reference standard of
cystoscopy, cytology, and histology.
2.
Patients and methods
This was a multicenter, prospective, blinded, single-arm,
single-visit cohort study. The Bladder EpiCheck result was not
intended to be used in patient management, and investigators
were blinded to the test results. Urine for testing was collected
before standard-of-care cystoscopy at the outpatient urology
clinic. If cystoscopy or cytology was suspicious for recurrence,
histology was performed, histology samples were obtained
via either direct biopsy or a planned transurethral resection of
bladder tumor (TURBT). In defining the reference standard
(cystoscopy, cytology, and histology), pathology was used as
the key determinant; if pathology was available and positive,
then the sample was deemed “positive”. If the cytology was
positive but pathology was negative, the result was consid-
ered inconclusive by the reference standard and was excluded
from the final analysis. If a patient had positive cystoscopy but
the pathology was absent, the reference standard was
considered positive if there was a clinical decision to start
oncologic treatment (ie, only patients for whom TURBT was
planned but refused, and whose physicians stated there was
clear disease present). Patients with positive or equivocal
results
for
either
cystoscopy
or
cytology
who
lacked
confirmatory pathology and a clinical decision to treat were
also classified as having an inconclusive diagnosis by the
reference standard and were excluded from the final analysis.
The inclusion criteria were: (1) incident or recurrent
bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) undergoing cystoscopic
surveillance at 3-mo intervals (adjuvant intravesical thera-
py allowed); (2) all UC resected within the previous 12 mo;
(3) able to provide informed consent; and (4) age �22 yr.
The exclusion criterion was planning to undergo radical
cystectomy or chemotherapy-radiation for UC. All data were
collected
during
one
visit.
Demographic
information
including risk factors, medical history, and relevant family
history was collected. Results for cystoscopy and cytology
were noted, and if a lesion was detected, the date and result
of histological confirmation were recorded. A urine sample
for the Bladder EpiCheck test was collected. Subjects were
free to withdraw from participation for any reason at any
time. Subjects who withdrew from the study were not
replaced. The study was approved by the hospitals’ ethics
committees and all subjects signed informed consent before
any study-related procedure (NCT02647112).
Bladder EpiCheck (Nucleix, Rehovot, Israel) is a urine test
developed to monitor recurrence of bladder cancer accord-
ing to 15 DNA methylation biomarkers. The test was
performed on �10 ml of urine and processed within 5 d in a
central laboratory (Germany or Israel). Processing includes
centrifugation to separate the cell pellet, from which DNA is
extracted. The extracted DNA is digested using a methyl-
ation-sensitive restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA at
recognition sequences if it is unmethylated, while leaving
methylated sequences intact. Digested DNA is then ampli-
fied via real-time polymerase chain reaction with locus-
specific primers and probes (8 wells per sample), and the
resulting data are analyzed using the Bladder EpiCheck
software. The report for each patient contains a quantitative
score (EpiScore) and a positive/negative interpretation. The
EpiScore is a number between 0 and 100, with a higher
score indicating more methylation; an EpiScore �60 is
considered a positive result.
All data complied with the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute biomarker reporting standards.
2.1.
Statistical methods
The primary efficacy endpoint was a binary diagnosis
(negative or positive) for both Bladder EpiCheck and the
reference standard. A secondary endpoint for each subject
was the EpiScore continuous measure. This study had two
co-primary aims; to show that sensitivity is �65% and that
specificity is �65% with 95% confidence. The study plan was
to enroll a sample size of approximately 400 subjects. Given
the prevalence reported, this sample was expected to yield
approximately 22 positive cases. Assuming device sensitiv-
ity of 90% and specificity of 80%, this sample size would

 provide precision of 14% in estimating sensitivity and of 5%
in estimating specificity with the corresponding 95% exact
binomial confidence intervals (CIs). Additional accuracy
statistics were planned, including positive predictive value
(PPV) and NPV, the positive and negative likelihood ratio
(PLR and NLR), and a ROC curve, with the area under the ROC
curve (AUC) presented as a summary measure for the
EpiScore continuous variable. For all accuracy parameters,
both point estimates and 95% two-sided CIs are provided.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary NC, USA).

Data set
Data for 440 subjects attending for routine surveillance
from December 2015 until January 2017 were included in
study. The performance analysis included 353 subjects;
87 subjects were excluded because of inconclusive diagno-
sis according to the reference standard (n = 50), no Bladder
EpiCheck results (n = 30), or both (n = 7). Figure 1 details the
categorization by reference standard to positive, negative,
or excluded on the basis of the cystoscopy, cytology, and
pathology results, and the availability of Bladder EpiCheck
results. Demographics are detailed in Table 1 and are
consistent with the bladder cancer population in Europe.
3.2.
Test results
Forty-six patients were defined as positive according to the
reference standard: 40 based on cystoscopy/cytology and
confirmatory pathology (21 LG Ta, 8 high-grade [HG] Ta,
7 HG T1, 1 T2, 3 carcinoma in situ [CIS]), and another six
based on cystoscopy and/or cytology and the clinical
decision of the treating urologist. Two of the 46 positives
did not have Bladder EpiCheck results (1 LG Ta, 1 HG Ta), so
the total number of positives included in the performance
analysis was 44.
For the 403 patients with a Bladder EpiCheck result,
320 samples (81.1%) were negative and 83 (18.9%) were
positive; the mean EpiScore was 31.2 (standard deviation
26.6).
Bladder
EpiCheck
results
versus
the
reference
standard are presented in Table 2.
The overall sensitivity was 68.2% (30/44) and overall
specificity was 88.0% (272/309). Table 3 lists results for the
primary and secondary endpoints, including overall agree-
ment (85.6%), NPV (95.1%), and PPV (44.8%). Table 3 also
shows subgroup analyses such as the sensitivity and NPV
when LG Ta recurrences are excluded (91.7% and 99.3%,
respectively). The two HG tumors that were missed were
HG Ta and T2. Five cases were excluded because of positive
cytology and negative, equivocal, or no pathology. When
including these cases in the performance analysis, the
overall sensitivity (67.3%) and NPV (94.4%) remained

 similar. When including these cases in the non–LG Ta
performance analysis, the sensitivity and NPV remained
excellent under worst and best case assumptions (sensitiv-
ity 86.2% and 92.6%, NPV 98.6% and 99.3%, respectively). In
total, 38 patients who had positive or equivocal cystoscopy
or cytology results without the confirmatory pathology
were excluded from the analysis. Figure 2 shows the
analysis of specificity and sensitivity (except for LG Ta
recurrences) by various risk factors and by study center. Age,
gender,
treatment
for
recent
recurrence
(stopped
or
ongoing), smoking history, and occupational exposure
had no impact on the test performance. Specificity was
significantly different between two sites, probably because
of the low volume at one of them (n = 9). The test
performance was similar in the presence of hematuria (data
not shown). Figure 3 shows ROC curves for the test; the AUC
is 0.82 when LG Ta recurrences are included, and 0.94 when
LG Ta recurrences are excluded. Sixty-seven patients had a
positive test result, resulting in a PPV of 44.8%. PPV
significantly increased with the EpiScore deciles (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1).

Discussion
High recurrence rates of up to 52% after 5 yr mean that the
prevalence of NMIBC is high, and it is estimated that more
than two million patients worldwide are living with bladder
cancer [8]. This implies a high patient and physician burden,
and a significant economic impact. Bladder cancer costs in
the European Union (EU) were recently reported to be 3% of
EU cancer costs and 5% of total EU health care caner costs
[9]. Considering the high recurrence rate of NMIBC and the
subsequent frequent, costly, and long follow-up, this is an
area that deserves attention.
Standard follow-up tools involve a combination of
cystoscopy and cytology. However, cystoscopy does not
detect all lesions and is subject to experience. Voided
cytology requires trained cytopathologists and has the
potential
for
interobserver variability.
Cystoscopy

 diagnosis (PDD) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) [10–
12]. However, PDD is predominantly carried out with rigid
instruments during resection. By contrast, NBI is easy to
perform during outpatient flexible cystoscopy, but improve-
ments in tumor detection still remain to be proven [12].
Urinary tests instead of or in conjunction with urinary
cytology have been studied for decades. Some of these tests
have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA). The NMP22 point-of-care test, for example, with
overall sensitivity (56%) and specificity (86%) is considered
insufficient to replace cystoscopy [1]. Better results were
reported for the UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion test, which has FDA approval for bladder cancer
detection and follow-up. The overall sensitivity was 74%,
and even 100% in CIS [13]. A false-positive test result was
thought to be predictive for future tumor recurrence, since
close to 90% of patients with a false-positive test were found
to have positive bladder biopsies within a year of their
positive test [14]. However, these two tests are not used
widely.
Results for a multigene urine biomarker were recently
published [15,16]. This test achieved an internally validated
sensitivity of 93%, specificity of �40%, and an NPV of 97%. It
was suggested that this test could be useful in postponing
follow-up cystoscopies, but its low specificity does not
provide a cost-effective solution as the majority of patients
would receive a positive result leading to cystoscopy.
Bladder EpiCheck is an easy test that uses 15 DNA
methylation biomarkers to assess the presence of bladder
cancer. This is the second independent study of Bladder
EpiCheck, and our results are consistent with those from the
first independent study (validation study). Our study
showed a high NPV of 95.1% for the entire cohort, with
overall sensitivity of 68.2%. More importantly, the assay can
exclude the presence of HG tumors with an NPV of 99.3%
and detect their presence with sensitivity of 91.7%. These

 results, and the high specificity of 88.0%, could allow
incorporation of Bladder EpiCheck in NMIBC follow-up
because a HG recurrence would be instantly detected with
high likelihood. Age, gender, smoking history, occupational
exposure, and recent or ongoing treatment since the last
TURBT did not influence the test performance. Such
consistent results make this test attractive for use in clinical
decision-making across a variety of patients and situations
in which existing techniques have a substantial rate of
equivocal results. Application of this test could reduce the
current burden of repeat cystoscopy and cytology tests, for
example,
by alternating
between
the
follow-up
gold
standard (cystoscopy and cytology) and Bladder EpiCheck.
Because most NMIBC recurrences will have the same stage
and grade as the initial tumor, low-risk cases in particular
(approx. 30–40% of the NMIBC cohort in follow-up [17])
could be candidates for an alternating follow-up schedule,
which would be beneficial for both urologists and patients.
Cost savings are also feasible, depending on the health
system and whether the test price is kept in the low
hundreds of euro, considering the costs for the gold
standard (including cytology, cystoscopy equipment and
maintenance, staff time). If LG recurrences are missed, they
can be picked up in the next follow-up cystoscopy. For LG
recurrences, it has been reported that an active surveillance
strategy is safe and cost-effective and can prevent bladder
function deterioration due to multiple resections, although
this still is a concept that should be further studied
[18,19]. There is a substantial unmet need to identify
patients during or after recent instillation therapy whose
cystoscopy is positive or equivocal, but are actually free
from disease. With the Bladder EpiCheck test the chances of
missing a HG recurrence are very low, and the confidence in
a negative result actually being negative is very high.
Therefore, adding the test to routine surveillance in this
patient population could provide an opportunity to reduce
unnecessary work-up and TURBTs.
As a limitation to our study, no follow-up data were
collected. Thus, we were unable to correlate false-positives
with later recurrences. No information was collected on
treatments before the last recurrence. We did not collect
data regarding active UTI, but interference tests for white
blood
cells
showed
no
impact
on
Bladder
EpiCheck
performance [20]. Unlike the specificity and NPV, which
have very narrow CIs owing to the large patient groups they
represent, the sensitivity is based on 46 patients only and
has a wider CI. More follow-up data from these patients are
needed for further substantiation of these results.

Conclusions
In this prospective multicenter study of the Bladder EpiCheck
urine test, we found clinically relevant sensitivity and NPV for
patients undergoing routine cystoscopic surveillance for
NMIBC. When LG Ta tumors are excluded, the test has
sensitivity of 91.7% and an NPV of 99.3%, with high specificity
of 88.0%. Bladder EpiCheck is easy to perform, assessing
changes in 15 DNA methylation biomarkers. This test could
serve as a rule-out test and help to avoid unnecessary
cystoscopic procedures in NMIBC follow-up since HG recur-
rence would be detected with high confidence. Alternating
cystoscopy and cytology with Bladder EpiCheck could reduce
the current burden of repeat cystoscopy and cytology tests,
which would be beneficial for urologists, health care systems,
and patients.
