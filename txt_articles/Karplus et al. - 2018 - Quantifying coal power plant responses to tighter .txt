We evaluate the impact of China’s new air pollution standards
on sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by comparing newly available
data from Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) at
coal power plants with satellite measures. First, we show that
following the July 2014 deadline for implementing tighter emis-
sions standards, stack concentrations of SO2 reported by CEMS
declined by 13.9%. Second, on average the ratios of the declines
of SO2 measures in the satellite data and the CEMS data are
about 0.5. However, the degree of correspondence between the
two data sources varies by policy stringency, with weak corre-
spondence found in key regions facing the toughest new limits.
Third, large plants achieved compliance earlier than small (typi-
cally) power and heat cogeneration plants. To achieve continued
air quality improvement, our results suggest a need for increased
scrutiny of emissions data quality and monitoring practices and
clear long-term targets.

S
everely polluted air has become pervasive in industrializ-
ing economies. While regulations increasingly incorporate
the most stringent international standards, weak and uneven
implementation complicates efforts to reduce emissions and
improve human health (1). Data quality is also a major challenge.
Reliable, high-frequency information on industrial emissions by
source is essential given that acute health effects often depend
on emissions timing (2–6). In developing countries, the present
norm—sporadic, often manually collected, data—provides an
incomplete picture of environmental performance and may be
particularly susceptible to manipulation, as ref. 1 found in India.
There is a growing need for studies that assess the impact of pol-
icy on polluting behavior at the firm level over time with attention
paid to the plausibility of underlying data.
Our study contributes to addressing this gap by using high-
frequency data from Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems
(CEMS) to evaluate how coal power plants responded to an
increase in the stringency of air pollution standards in China.
In 2007, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in
China required that certain (mainly high-emitting) plants install
and operate CEMS (7). Early analysis of data collection efforts
identified several challenges to implementation (8): inadequate
local Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) involvement in
the initial testing of CEMS performance, large variation in the
EPB response to data submitted, and insufficient capacity for
comprehensive field inspections. From the end of 2013, 14,410
firms were required to upload hourly, automatically recorded
pollutant-specific concentration data to a publicly available,
online platform for each province.
Existing coal-fired power plants in China were required to
comply with new emission standards (GB13223-2011) by the
deadline of July 1, 2014. For power plants in relatively less pol-
luted, nonkey regions, the limit on the maximum concentration
of SO2 declined from 400 to 200 mg/m3. This limit was further
reduced to 50 mg/m3 for plants in highly polluted and populous
key regions, including 47 prefecture-level cities in 19 provinces
primarily located in the greater Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area, the
Pearl River Delta, and the Yangtze River Delta.
The CEMS data allow us to study the overall impact of tighter
air pollution standards on plant-level emissions near the policy
deadline and to probe heterogeneity in compliance behavior as
a function of policy stringency and firm characteristics. Further-
more, we compare changes in plant-level SO2 emissions concen-
trations recorded by CEMS with changes in the Ozone Moni-
toring Instrument (OMI) satellite SO2 measures from the US
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) over
an area around each plant following the policy deadline. The
satellite data provide an objective source for assessing changes in
plant-level emissions that is not susceptible to manipulation. The
OMI data have been used in many settings to measure and ver-
ify changes in air pollution emissions from point sources (see, for
instance, refs. 9–13).
We report three primary findings. First, we find a large reduc-
tion (13.9%) in average plant SO2 concentrations in the CEMS
data in the months following the policy deadline. Satellite data
also show a corresponding reduction in SO2 column amounts.
Second, while postpolicy reductions in CEMS and satellite mea-
surements correspond closely in nonkey regions facing less strin-
gent new standards, we find no such correspondence in key
regions where new standards are more aggressive. Third, we
explore heterogeneity in firm responses and find that the firms
that fail to comply after the policy deadline tend to have smaller,
older boilers and may thereby find it technically difficult or costly
to introduce the end-of-pipe controls required for compliance.
Our results suggest steps to improve both the quality of emis-
sions data upon which evaluation must rely and the effectiveness
of policy.
We test for confounding effects due to neighboring point
sources of SO2 and find that our main results are robust. Raising

Significance
We observe large reductions in the concentration of sulfur
dioxide (SO2) from coal power plants in China following the
implementation of a tougher national air emissions standard
using a high-frequency plant-level data source. We find a
corresponding decline in SO2 measures in satellite observa-
tions. However, correspondence between these two measures
is lower in areas that faced a sharper increase in standard
stringency.

isolated does not change our main results. We find no evidence
that our results are driven by the operation of combined heat and
power (CHP) systems during the winter heating season. Finally,
we use the CEMS data to show that the behavior of nearby
nonpower firms likewise does not explain our results.
Methods
Data Sources. We assemble CEMS monitor-level hourly emissions data for
coal-fired power plants in four Chinese provinces: Guangdong, Hubei,
Shandong, and Shanghai. In each province, the provincial EPB provides a
publicly available data platform to disseminate hourly emissions concentra-
tion data from monitored firms. These four provinces provided CEMS data
from November 2013, 9 mo before the July 2014 policy deadline, allow-
ing us to compare plant-level emission performance before and after the
policy deadline. Our data include 256 power plants, with 43 plants whose
generating capacity is larger than 1,000 MW. While plant-level configura-
tions vary, multiple monitors are often installed on stacks associated with
one or more generating units and perform hourly measurements of the
concentration of SO2 (mg/m3) in emitted stack gases. A plant’s average
daily SO2 concentration is measured as the average of all observed hourly
values in a 24-h period from all monitors. Monthly average SO2 concen-
tration data are aggregated from daily measures by plant and are used in
our analysis.
We use SO2
satellite observations from NASA’s dataset OMSO2e:
OMI/Aura Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total Column L3 1 d Best Pixel in 0.25° × 0.25°
V3. For each power plant, we draw a circle with radius of 35 km centered
at the plant. We take the average of the SO2 readings of all of the OMSO2e
grids that are partially or fully covered by the 35-km circle to capture SO2
emissions from the power plant on each day. Monthly SO2 measures for our
analysis are aggregated from daily values. To benchmark the CEMS data to
satellite data, we restrict our analysis to a sample of relatively isolated plants
for which generating capacity represents at least 50% of all surrounding
plants’ total generating capacity within 35 km. (Our definition of relatively
isolated plants is based on the distribution of plant-level capacity shares.
Most power plants are located in dense industrial areas in China, and only
16% of all power plants in the CEMS data have a capacity that represents at
least 50% of all surrounding plants’ total capacity within 35 km.) Additional
description of both the CEMS data and the satellite data are provided in SI
Appendix.
The CEMS records SO2 concentration at the point of emission from a
plant, whereas the satellite column amounts capture local changes in SO2
from all sources. In our analyses below, we test the robustness of our main
results by taking into account SO2 emissions from sources other than power
plants in the CEMS data.
Summary statistics are reported in Table 1. The average stack SO2 concen-
trations reported in CEMS are 93.6 mg/m3 for all 256 plants in our sample.
In key regions (113 plants), the average stack SO2 concentration before July
2014 is 89.4 mg/m3, and it decreases to 64.9 mg/m3 after July 2014, which
is still higher than the new standards at 50 mg/m3. In nonkey regions (143
plants), the average SO2 concentration is 170.3 mg/m3 before July 2014, and
it decreases to 102.4 mg/m3 after the policy deadline, below the new stan-
dard. (Subsequent tables will consider the subset of geographically isolated
and large-capacity power plants.)
Literature. Methods for comparing in situ measurements of air pollutants
with satellite retrievals are well established for a range of air pollutants (see,
for instance, refs. 12 and 14 for SO2, ref. 9 for NOx, and ref. 11 for PM2.5).
Prior studies have compared in situ measures of SO2 from point sources
to satellite observations over North America (12, 14–16), Mexico City (10),
China (13), and globally (17, 18). The methods used here most closely follow
refs. 10, 13, 14, and 17.
This study contributes to prior research in several ways. For the ground (or
other direct, in situ) measures of SO2, this study is the first to use plant-level
SO2 concentration data recorded on an hourly basis by the newly installed
CEMS network in China. This data source distinguishes our study from ref.
13, which did not observe high-frequency SO2 emissions data from monitors
at emitting facilities. (Ref. 13 used information on power plant technology
and operation to estimate monthly SO2 emissions.) For the satellite mea-
sures of SO2, we use the OMI data release described in ref. 14, which allows
detection of smaller point sources of SO2 emissions compared with earlier
editions. Unlike ref. 17, which focused on quantifying long-term changes
in pollutants over industrial areas, our study uses a regression approach to
study correspondence in plant and satellite measurements of SO2 emissions
changes around the July 2014 policy deadline.
Furthermore, because China’s CEMS reports hourly SO2 emissions con-
centration, not emissions amounts, our study also differs from prior studies
in that we estimate the correspondence between plant SO2 concentrations
and satellite measurements. As we control for conditions affecting the plant
operation and any annual variation, plant-level SO2 concentration is a good
proxy for SO2 emission amounts. We discuss the validity of this assumption
in greater detail in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods: Comparing CEMS
SO2 Concentration and Satellite Column Amounts.
We expect that changes in the plant and satellite SO2 measures due to
the policy follow a linear relationship, as discussed in refs. 19 and 13. As a
short-lived pollutant, SO2 is more amenable to such comparisons than ambi-
ent PM2.5 or ozone, which include contributions from substances formed
in the atmosphere from emissions precursors. Our analysis of the satel-
lite data controls for climate conditions from the same satellite source, as
described below.
Econometric Model. We separately estimate changes in CEMS and satellite
SO2 emissions around the July 2014 policy deadline using the following
specification:
Eit = αPt + γiy + θm + Xitβ + �it.
[1]
Depending on the dataset we use, i denotes either the plant in the CEMS
data or the 35 km area surrounding the plant in the satellite data. t denotes
time in months (y calendar year together with m calendar month). The
dependent variable, Eit, denotes the SO2 concentration of plant i in month
t in the CEMS data or SO2 measure of the area i in month t in the satellite
data. The key independent variable is the policy indicator, Pt, which equals
1 starting July 2014 and 0 otherwise. We include plant-by-year fixed effects
γiy to absorb plant or surrounding area-specific characteristics that change
by year. We also include calendar month dummies, θm, to capture seasonal
variation common to all plants/areas. For analysis of the satellite observa-
tions, we also include additional controls Xit, specifically climate controls
and satellite data missing counts. The climate controls include temperature,
precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Our specification
allows flexibility to capture the substantial unobserved heterogeneity in
plant characteristics and circumstances, isolating common changes in the
neighborhood of the policy deadline.

persists after the deadline. To benchmark CEMS data against
the satellite data, in Fig. 2 we focus on emissions measures for
the largest plants (capacity larger than 1,000 MW) because they
would be expected to generate the strongest signal in the satel-
lite observations. The general patterns in both measures are
similar, with substantial declines in the months leading up to
July 2014.
We estimate changes in plant and satellite SO2 measures
around the policy deadline in Table 2. (All changes are esti-
mated in log points.) Column 1 of “The policy” shows that the
average decline in SO2 concentration in the CEMS data after
July 2014 is about 13.9%. In columns 2 and 3, to compare post-
policy reductions in the CEMS and the satellite data, we restrict
the analysis sample to 35 relatively isolated power plants whose
capacity is at least 50% of all power plants’ total capacity within
a 35 km radius of the plant. In this sample, we find that enforcing
the new emissions standards reduces both SO2 measurements.
SO2 concentrations in the CEMS data fell by 36.8% after the
policy, and the SO2 measure from satellite fell by 18.3%. (Omit-
ting the control variable for missing data counts in the satellite
data does not change estimates of postpolicy reductions, reduc-
ing concern about potential bias from an endogenous control.)
The ratio of the estimated declines of SO2 measures in the
satellite and the CEMS data are about 0.5 (0.183/0.368). In
columns 4 and 5, we further restrict the sample to large isolated
power plants (capacity larger than 1,000 MW) and find similar
results.
Falsification Test. To address the possibility that the results in
Table 1 (the policy section) were not due to the policy deadline,
we repeat the analysis using the hypothetical policy timing of July
1, 2015, which serves as a falsification test as this date did not cor-
respond to any changes in standard stringency. We use data from
July 2014 to July 2016 for this test. In the falsification test section
of Table 2, as expected, estimated effects on SO2 concentrations
from power plants are much smaller, have the opposite sign, and
are less precisely estimated. The estimated changes in the SO2
column amount from the satellite are very small and statistically
insignificant.
Heterogeneous Responses in Key vs. Nonkey Regions. Given more
stringent new standards in key regions, power plants may have
used different approaches to adjust their emissions concen-
trations. Plants can alter emissions concentrations mainly by
running end-of-pipe control equipment, changing the opera-
tional profile of the plant, or purchasing higher cost, low sulfur
coal. Plants also differ by size and technology on the extent of
reductions possible at a given cost. To compare plant responses
in key regions versus nonkey regions, we first ensure that the
average share of local power capacity that the isolated plants
represent is very similar between key and nonkey regions:
On average, plants in nonkey regions represent 82% of total
capacity in 35 km, while plants in key regions account for an
average of 81%.
Fig. 3 shows compliance with the prevailing standards in key
regions and nonkey regions before and after the July 2014 pol-
icy deadline. Compliance is defined as the share of nonmissing
hourly observations in a month in which average SO2 concen-
trations measured by CEMS fell below the standard. In key
regions, firms’ compliance rate fell substantially from 100% to
around 50% after the policy due to the stricter new standards.
The fall in compliance after standards were implemented was on
average smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration for larger
plants. Larger plants constructed since 2003 (when prior stan-
dards were issued) tend to be more efficient and installed with
end-of-pipe controls that remove SO2 and other air pollutants.
In SI Appendix, we show that smaller, typically CHP, plants con-
trolled by county governments exhibited the lowest compliance
rates in key regions (see SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2). In con-
trast, in nonkey regions where the new standards were less strict,
the compliance rate decreased only slightly from 90% for a few
months after the policy and then increased to close to 100% in
early 2015.
Table 3 reports estimation results using Eq. 1 for key regions
and nonkey regions separately. The decline in the CEMS data
associated with the policy deadline is statistically significant at
the 1% level. In columns 1 and 2, among all isolated plants, SO2
concentrations in the CEMS data fell by 32.5% after the policy,
and the SO2 measure from satellite fell by 20.8%. The ratio of the
estimated declines in the satellite and CEMS SO2 measures is
0.64 (0.208/0.325). In columns 3 and 4, the ratio of the estimated
declines is greater among plants larger than 1,000 MW, about
0.77 (0.227/0.293). In contrast, in the falsification section, we do
not find such correspondence in key regions. Column 1 shows
that the estimated decline after the policy in the CEMS data is
51%, larger than that in nonkey regions. If plants indeed reduced
emissions as suggested by the CEMS data, we would expect the
satellite data to capture the reduction to some extent. However,
column 2 shows that the estimated change in the satellite data
is close to zero and statistically insignificant. Similar results are
found among large plants.

Estimated changes post-July 2015 are included as a falsification test. Column 1 uses all power plants from November
2013 to July 2016. Columns 2–5 use relatively isolated power plants whose capacity is at least 50% of all plants’ total

founding changes following July 2014). Y, yes. Standard errors are clustered at the plant level. *P < 0.10; **P < 0.05;
***P < 0.01.
A potential explanation for the discrepancy in the two data
sources in key regions is that plants overstated or falsified reduc-
tions. The stricter new standards and greater pressure to comply
may have generated incentives for plant managers to falsify or
selectively omit concentration data. In SI Appendix, we pro-
vide additional evidence suggestive of the potential incentives
to misreport. We investigate plant emissions before and after
an episode of missing data (on average 19 d) in which firms
report that emissions control facilities did not operate properly.
In SI Appendix, Fig. S3, there is little change in concentration
data trends in the 15 d before and after missing data episodes
in nonkey regions. In key regions after the policy, however,
plants improve their reported compliance substantially after a
few weeks of missing data. In addition to the possibility of fal-
sification, plants may have reallocated production across units
in ways that increased operation of dirtier units without CEMS
monitors within the same facility. Both of these possibilities
are consistent with our results. We also investigate alternative
explanations in the next section.
Robustness Tests. We report the results of robustness tests in SI
Appendix. First, because we focus on power plants whose capac-
ity represents at least half of all power plants’ capacity within
35 km, changes in SO2 emissions in surrounding power plants or
heating boilers that are part of CHP plants might generate noise
when we compare changes in emissions in the CEMS data with
those in the satellite data. Second, a potential concern about our
findings in Table 3 is that if SO2 emissions at nonpower firms in
key regions increased after July 2014, it could have offset a possi-
ble decrease in SO2 emissions of power plants nearby in the key
regions, and therefore, little change in the SO2 measure from the
satellite is observed.
To address the issue posed by surrounding power plants, we
further restrict the sample to power plants whose capacity is
at least 70% of all power plants’ total capacity within 35 km.
(Eleven percent of all power plants in the CEMS data have a
capacity that represents at least 70% of all surrounding plants’
total capacity in 35 km.) Confounding changes from surrounding
power plants, if any, should be smaller in this subsample. Results
are reported in columns 1 and 2 in SI Appendix, Table S2. We find
results similar to those in Table 3. Notably, in nonkey regions,
we find a 26.8% reduction in SO2 concentration in the CEMS
data and a 27.0% reduction in the satellite data. The ratio of the
estimated postpolicy declines of SO2 measures from the satellite
data and the CEMS data are nearly proportional (0.268/0.270,
or approximately 1). This represents a much stronger correspon-
dence between the two data sources where possible errors from
surrounding power plants are further reduced.
To address the concern about winter heating, we note that
heating boilers operate only in winter months (November to
March), and the deadline for complying with the new emission
standards was in July 2014. Therefore, we would not expect
the change in emissions before and after the July deadline to
have been affected by emissions from heating boilers. We also
directly examine this concern by dropping winter months in the
sample and report results in columns 3 and 4 of SI Appendix,
Table S2. We find that results are robust to those shown in
Table 3.

Finally, to address the concern about nonpower facilities, we
directly investigate the change in SO2 concentration of non-
power, high-emitting facilities before and after the July 2014
deadline for power plants. For each power plant in our data,
we obtain CEMS data for nonpower firms within 35 km. In
SI Appendix, Table S3, we do not find statistically significant
changes in SO2 concentration at nonpower plants in both key
and nonkey regions, consistent with the fact that the July 2014
deadline did not apply to nonpower facilities. The sign of the
change is negative in key regions, which further reduces the
concern about a potential increase in SO2 concentration at non-
power firms in key regions. Results suggest that the limited
correspondence between CEMS and satellite measures of SO2
cannot be explained by changes in the emitting behavior of neigh-
boring nonpower firms. To summarize, these additional findings
suggest that our main results are robust and that manipulation of
the CEMS data in regions facing the toughest emission standards
is plausible.
Conclusion
We find that tighter environmental standards targeting power
plants’ emissions concentrations prompted substantial SO2
reductions at coal power plants in China. Satellite data cor-
roborate these reductions in nonkey regions but not in key
regions, which faced deeper reduction requirements. Reductions
recorded by CEMS were large: Average SO2 emissions con-
centrations at power plants were 13.9% lower after the policy
deadline. The absence of a change in satellite measurements
at key regions’ plants around the policy deadline is suggestive
of misreporting. Prior studies documenting efforts to improve
SO2 policy enforcement in China have raised questions about
the quality of the CEMS data (see, for example, refs. 7 and 20).
Penalties for falsifying data have historically been lower than
those for violating the standard. Regulations initially offered
neither detailed guidance on CEMS reporting requirements,
instructions on how to identify falsification cases, nor a schedule
of associated penalties for reporting violations (see SI Appendix,
Table S1 for a description of penalties for standard violations
and data falsification). Our findings based on the satellite com-
parison further suggest that manipulation is far from universal
but may have increased as compliance grew more costly or
difficult.
The drop in SO2 concentrations around July 2014 suggests
that the policy deadline prompted a substantial change in the
emitting behavior of most firms, such as increasing utiliza-
tion of end-of-pipe control. However, potential reductions from
these short-term levers are constrained largely by the vintage
of installed equipment. Many plants, especially in key regions,
likely required substantial changes to their pollution removal
technology or operational practices to meet the tighter stan-
dards. Despite a large drop in SO2 emissions concentrations,
many firms ultimately fell short. As of June 2016, nearly half
of the plants in key regions had not complied with the strictest
new standard, and many smaller plants did not have CEMS
installed.
Our results suggest substantial room to strengthen incentives
for accurate and comprehensive reporting as part of China’s
national air pollution control efforts. An important first step
involves clarifying reporting requirements and strengthening
penalties for data inaccuracies or falsification. For instance, offi-
cials could mandate that CEMS measure concentrations in the
stack gases of all (and not just a subset of) operational boil-
ers and that CEMS record emissions during all of a plant’s
operational hours. A second step could involve allowing more
time for emitters to comply with tougher standards but signal-
ing strong enforcement. Emissions trading systems could help
to alleviate high costs for some plants and provide compli-
ance flexibility; however, for these systems to work, high-quality
emissions reporting is essential. As a third step, where feasi-
ble, plants that contribute disproportionately to local pollution
and lack cost-effective pollution control options could be shut
down as part of efforts to reduce substantial existing excess
capacity in China’s power sector. Increasing the reach and
accuracy of CEMS monitoring can help to support air quality
improvement.
The method applied in this paper could be extended to assess
cleanup efforts for other short-lived industrial air pollutants.
NOx was added as a regulatory target during the Twelfth Five-
Year Plan; both CEMS and satellite data are available for NOx.
Comparisons of CEMS and satellite measures could also be used
to alert policy makers to major instances of CEMS data manip-
ulation, extending the growing application of remote sensing
data in a regulatory setting (19). Finally, an approach like ours
could be applied in other developing countries that seek low-cost
