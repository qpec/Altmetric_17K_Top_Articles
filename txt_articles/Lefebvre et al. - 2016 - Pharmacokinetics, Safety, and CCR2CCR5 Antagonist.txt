Cenicriviroc, a dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist, is being evaluated for treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibro-
sis (CENTAUR; NCT02217475). As it is metabolized by the liver, cenicriviroc was investigated in hepatic-impaired participants
for pharmacokinetic changes. Participants with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (HI) (Child–Pugh class A (N = 7) or
B (N = 8)) and matched controls (N = 15) received cenicriviroc 150 mg once daily for 14 days. Serial blood samples were
obtained on Days 1 and 14. Safety, tolerability, and effects on CCR2/CCR5 ligands, cytokines, and bacterial translocation
biomarkers were evaluated. Cenicriviroc exposures were increased by moderate HI (AUC0-τ 55%, Cmax 29% higher) but were
not with mild HI (AUC0-τ 38%, Cmax 40% lower). Cenicriviroc was well tolerated. Rapid and potent CCR2/CCR5 blockade was
observed, not associated with increases in hepatic inflammation or bacterial translocation biomarkers. Study findings suggest
that cenicriviroc 150 mg can be used in patients with mild-to-moderate HI.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE
TOPIC?
✔ Limited data are available on the effects of HI on
CCR2 or CCR5-antagonists PKs. Maraviroc (CCR5 antag-
onist) requires no dosing adjustment for HI, but no
data are available for investigational CCR2 (CCX140-b,
JNJ-41443532) or CCR2/5 (BMS-813160, PF-04634817)
antagonists.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
✔ This study evaluated the effects of mild-to-moderate
HI on cenicriviroc’
s (CCR2/5 antagonist) PKs and safety.
Effects on proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of
bacterial translocation were also explored.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?
✔ Study findings suggest that cenicriviroc 150 mg can be
dosed in subjects with mild-to-moderate HI. The favorable
safety profile and CCR2/CCR5 blockade observed here are
consistent with previously reported findings.
HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOL-
OGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?
✔ Cenicriviroc is currently being evaluated for the treat-
ment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis in the
2-year phase IIb CENTAUR study. As these participants are
at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and some may
eventually suffer from HI, these data provide reassurance
on CVC dosing in the setting of worsening disease.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly
attributable to cardiovascular and chronic liver diseases,1–3
and the prevalence is increasing globally.1–3 While disease
progression for people with liver steatosis is typically slow,
those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; steatosis
with inflammation) and hepatic fibrosis can progress to cir-
rhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.1–5 NASH is the second
indication for liver transplant in the United States and pre-
dicted to become the first by 2020.6,7 There are currently no
approved agents to treat NASH; several classes of medica-
tion (e.g., insulin sensitizers, fatty acid-bile acid conjugates,

antifibrotic agents, and C-C chemokine receptor types 2 and
5 (CCR2/CCR5) antagonists) are currently being investigated
in clinical trials.8
CCR2/CCR5 antagonists disrupt the interactions between
CCR2/CCR5 and their ligands, which mediate the inflam-
matory immune response that can lead to fibrogenesis.9,10
Following hepatocyte injury, hepatic macrophages (Kupffer
cells) secrete C-C chemokine ligand type 2 (CCL2, a.k.a.
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]), driving the
recruitment and migration of proinflammatory monocytes to
the liver.11,12 Here, they mature into macrophages, secret-
ing proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., transforming growth

factor-β [TGF-β], platelet-derived growth factor [a potent
myofibroblast growth factor], interleukin(IL)-1β, and adipose
tissue proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and tumor
necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) that activate hepatic stellate cells
(HSCs) and further aggravate hepatocyte injury.13–16 Acti-
vated HSCs differentiate into myofibroblast-like cells that
produce collagen, the basis of the extracellular matrix that
deposits in the liver, resulting in fibrosis and, eventually,
cirrhosis.14–17 This entire process is further exacerbated by
increased bacterial translocation observed in liver disease.
Bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide enhance hep-
atic inflammation and fibrosis via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-
mediated activation of Kupffer cells and HSCs.18 TLR5 acti-
vation by flagellin (a marker of bacterial translocation) has
also been shown to cause hepatic injury in mice19; flag-
ellin induces CCL4 (a.k.a. macrophage inflammatory protein-
1β) and CCL5 (a.k.a. regulated on activation normal T-cell
expressed and secreted [RANTES]) expression in HIV-1-
infected lymphoid tissue.20
Cenicriviroc is an oral, potent, dual CCR2/CCR5 antago-
nist with a plasma half-life of 30–40 h in humans. It demon-
strated potent antiinflammatory and antifibrotic activity in
animal models of peritonitis, liver, and kidney diseases.21–26
Cenicriviroc showed potent CCR2/CCR5 blockade in HIV-
infected participants in a phase IIb study27 and led to
decreases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet
ratio index (APRI), noninvasive hepatic fibrosis index (FIB-
4), and enhanced liver fibrosis score.27–29 Decreases in both
APRI and FIB-4 correlated with reductions in soluble CD14
(sCD14, a marker of monocyte activation) levels. Evalua-
tion of cenicriviroc in �600 participants to date, including
115 receiving cenicriviroc for 48 weeks,27 supports a favor-
able safety profile. Taken together, these data paved the way
for the ongoing multicenter phase IIb trial, CENTAUR (652-
2-203; NCT02217475), which will evaluate the efficacy and
safety of cenicriviroc 150 mg once daily for the treatment of
NASH and liver fibrosis over 2 years, with a primary end point
at Year 1, in 289 participants with NASH and liver fibrosis at
increased risk of progression to cirrhosis.30
NASH has been shown to be associated with decreased
hepatic-enzyme activity, such as for cytochrome P450
(CYP)3A,31 suggesting that cenicriviroc is likely to be used
in people with hepatic impairment (HI). HI is known to poten-
tially alter a drug’
s pharmacokinetics (PK; i.e., metabolism,
distribution, and elimination) based on differences in liver
blood-flow, CYP and transporter changes, and protein
binding.32 This may create a need for dose adjustment in
patients with HI, so the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) recommends that drugs substantially metabolized or
eliminated by the liver should be evaluated in patients with
HI.33
Cenicriviroc is metabolized by the liver (it is a substrate
of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and P-glycoprotein, and also a weak
inhibitor of CYP3A4), and is >98% bound to plasma pro-
teins. Understanding the impact of HI on the PK and safety
of cenicriviroc is essential to guide future dosing and use,
based on any clinically relevant changes that could alter the
benefit/risk profile. Cenicriviroc has a fairly wide therapeu-
tic range, and modest PK variability, and the impact of HI
on its PK is expected to be minor, based on characteristics
of the molecule, including metabolic profile, and clearance
pathways.
This study aimed to compare the PK of cenicriviroc in par-
ticipants with mild or moderate HI (Child–Pugh A and B) with
those in participants with normal hepatic function. The safety
and tolerability of cenicriviroc and its effects on CCR2/CCR5
ligands, proinflammatory cytokines, and biomarkers of bac-
terial translocation were also evaluated.
METHODS
This study (652-1-121) was registered under clinical trial
number NCT02120547 and conducted in accordance with
the current Declaration of Helsinki (2013). Participants were
enrolled at Clinical Pharmacology of Miami, FL. Written
informed consent was obtained at the screening visit; study
protocol and informed consent were reviewed by the Institu-
tional Review Board (IntegReview IRB, Austin, TX). Cenicrivi-
roc (cenicriviroc mesylate) 150 mg tablets were supplied by
Tobira Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA.
Study design
This phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, single-center
study was conducted in the United States and enrolled
participants with mild (Child–Pugh class A) or moderate
(Child–Pugh class B) HI; healthy participants with normal
hepatic function were matched for age (±5 years), body
weight (±15%), and gender. The study was composed of two
cohorts: i) participants with mild HI and their matched con-
trols with normal hepatic function (“matched controls (mild)”);
ii) participants with moderate HI and their matched con-
trols with normal hepatic function (“matched controls (mod-
erate)”). Both cohorts were conducted in parallel. The study
design was based on the FDA guidelines on HI studies.33
In healthy participants, cenicriviroc has been shown to
reach steady-state plasma concentrations within approxi-
mately 8–10 days of dosing. A treatment period of 14 days
was chosen to allow adequate time to reach steady-state
in the event that changes in cenicriviroc PK were observed
in participants with HI. A cenicriviroc 150 mg single-tablet
formulation was used, as per the ongoing CENTAUR study.
Administration with food has been shown to increase ceni-
criviroc bioavailability; therefore, the tablets were scheduled
to be taken once daily with breakfast (�500–700 kcal and
15–20 g of fat) after overnight fast for 14 days; all participants
had an identical breakfast on Days 1 and 14.
Study participants
Participants 18–65 years of age were enrolled, with a weight
�50.0 kg and a body mass index 18.0–40.0 kg/m2. Those
with stable liver disease (cryptogenic, posthepatic, hepatitis
B or C virus, NAFLD, NASH) also had mild or moderate HI,
assessed according to the Child–Pugh classification (Class
A (5–6 points) or B (7–9 points), respectively). Cirrhosis diag-
nosis was confirmed from medical records (documenting a
definitive diagnostic procedure, i.e., liver biopsy, ultrasound,
computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging)
with physical examination upon study entry.
Exclusion criteria for all participants included average alco-
hol intake of >14 units/week; positive results for drugs of

abuse or alcohol-screening tests; positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2
antibody. Those for participants with HI included: progressive
liver disease within the last 4 weeks; severe ascites or hepatic
encephalopathy; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 × upper
limit of normal (ULN) at screening; biliary liver cirrhosis or
other causes of HI not related to parenchymal disorder and/or
disease of the liver; history of, or candidate for, liver trans-
plantation; hepatocellular carcinoma or acute liver disease.
For matched controls, exclusion criteria included: known his-
tory of porphyria, active liver disease, or an unexplained ele-
vation of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, albu-
min, prothrombin time, or total bilirubin; positive for hepatitis
B surface antigen or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.
Concomitant medication use was kept to a minimum.
Medications necessary for the management of HI or other
chronic conditions were permitted if regimens were sta-
ble for at least 7 days prior to study drug administration.
Use of products altering the activity of CYP450 enzymes
(e.g., specific medications, grapefruit-containing products,
or St John’
s wort), or prolonging the QT/QTc interval were
prohibited.
Study objectives
The primary objective was to compare the multiple-dose PK
of cenicriviroc in adults with mild or moderate HI against
those in matched controls. The secondary objective was
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cenicriviroc in
participants with HI. The tertiary objective was to assess
changes from baseline in CCR2/CCR5 ligands, proinflam-
matory cytokines, and biomarkers of bacterial transloca-
tion in participants with normal hepatic function, or mild-to-
moderate HI.
Outcome measures
Pharmacokinetic assessment
Serial blood samples (5 mL) for plasma cenicriviroc concen-
trations were obtained on Days 1 and 14 at 0 (predose),
0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postdose (i.e., predose
on Day 2 and in the morning of Day 15). PK blood samples
were also obtained predose on Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, and 16.
After collection, blood samples were placed on ice and cen-
trifuged within 45 min of collection at 2,000g for 15 min at
5°C. Plasma was transferred and divided into two aliquots
and kept frozen at –70°C until assayed. Cenicriviroc and the
added internal standard were extracted by protein precip-
itation. The extract was then subjected to reverse-phase,
high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a C18
analytical column; detection of the analytes was achieved
by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using the Sciex
API3000 LC-MS/MS system. The bioanalytical method was
validated over the range 5.00–960 ng/mL.

determined on Days 1 and 14 using a standard noncompart-
mental method with WinNonlin v. 6.3 (Pharsight, Cary, NC)
based on plasma cenicriviroc concentrations. Assumptions
to calculate AUC0–� and AUC0–τ included linear PK and
reaching steady-state by Day 14. Time to steady-state was
determined by evaluating Cmin over the 14 days of dosing.
Steady-state was declared once Cmin were within 10% of
the Day 14 predose concentration.
Safety assessment
Adverse events (AEs) were monitored continuously and
graded by intensity according to the Division of AIDS toxic-
ity scale. Physical examinations were undertaken at screen-
ing (Days –28 to –2), baseline (Day –1), and follow-up visits
(Day 28 for all participants, Day 35 only for those with HI).
Hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and 12-lead elec-
trocardiograms were performed at screening, baseline, and
Days 14 and 28; hematology and clinical chemistry were also
performed at Day 7.
Biomarkers analysis
CCR2 and CCR5 ligands (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5) and
proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β) were
measured on the Luminex platform on plasma samples from
Day 1 and during cenicriviroc treatment at Days 7 and
14 (HCYTOMAG-60K MILLIPLEX (Merck Millipore, Darm-
stadt, Germany) was used for CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, IL-1β,
IL-6; Human RANTES enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (PeproTech, London, UK) for CCL5; Human TGF-
β 1 DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for
TGF-β). Markers of enterocyte death, intestinal fatty acid
binding protein (I-FABP) (R&D Systems), and bacterial
translocation,
flagellin
(MyBioSource,
San
Diego,
CA),
lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) (Hycult Biotech,
Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia, PA), and sCD14 (R&D Sys-
tems), were measured at the same timepoints by ELISA
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Correlation
between flagellin and I-FABP or ALT levels was evaluated in
both cohorts.
Statistical analysis
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters were summa-
rized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. Analy-
sis of variance was performed on log-normal (ln)-transformed
Cmax, Cmin, and AUC0–τ values. The ratios of the least squares
geometric means and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for
these parameters were compared between the cohorts of
hepatic-impaired participants and matched controls. Statisti-
cal analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
Clinical safety data were summarized using descriptive
statistics for the safety population; no statistical analyses
were conducted for the safety end points.
CCR2/CCR5 ligands, cytokines, and biomarkers were
summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., medians,
interquartile ranges) by study day, with changes from base-
line also computed and reported. Wilcoxon tests and Spear-
man correlations were used. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using GraphPad Prism v. 6.0 (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA).

RESULTS
Study population
Forty-six participants were screened and 15 excluded (two
did not meet inclusion criteria, six met exclusion criteria, four
did not present at the clinic, one withdrew consent, two were
reserve participants). In all, 31 participants were enrolled:
eight with mild HI and seven matched controls (mild), eight
with moderate HI and eight matched controls (moderate).
Thirty participants received all doses of study medication
(one withdrew from the mild HI group on Day 1 due to a
mild AE of vomiting, and was excluded from the PK analy-
sis); 29 participants completed the study (one withdrew con-
sent (due to relocation) after the last cenicriviroc dose was
administered on Day 14).
Demographics and baseline characteristics of enrolled
participants are captured in Table 1. The majority of partici-
pants were male (71.0%), 93.6% of participants were White,
and 6.4% were Black/African American. The median age of
participants was 59 years (range 43–64) and median body
mass index was 27.9 kg/m2 (range 18.8–37.9). The major-
ity of participants with HI tested positive for HCV antibody
(75.0% and 62.5% with mild or moderate HI, respectively)
and a large proportion displayed past alcohol abuse (62.5%
and 87.5% with mild or moderate HI, respectively). All but
one participant in the HI groups were diagnosed with cirrho-
sis (15/16). In the moderate HI group, seven out of eight par-
ticipants had ascites.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Day 1 pharmacokinetic results
Following a single dose of cenicriviroc 150 mg on Day 1,
participants with mild HI had numerically lower cenicriviroc
exposures compared with matched controls (mild), based on
Cmin, Cmax, AUC0–�, and AUC0–τ geometric means (Supple-
mentary Table 1). The opposite trend was observed in the
moderate HI cohort, apart from Cmax, which was higher in
matched controls (moderate). The geometric mean (coeffi-
cient of variation (CV), %) t1/2 was 8.4 h (12.7) and 8.2 h
(9.3) in participants with mild HI and matched controls (mild),
respectively, and 10.4 h (30.6) and 8.1 h (9.3) in those with
moderate HI and matched controls (moderate), respectively.
The apparent CL/F geometric mean (CV%) was 27.1 L/h
(32.0) and 22.1 L/h (43.2) in participants with mild HI and
matched controls (mild), respectively; and 25.8 L/h (29.1) and
31.7 L/h (79.9) in those with moderate HI and matched con-
trols (moderate), respectively. The apparent Vz/F geometric
mean (CV%) was 329 L (27.3) and 262 L (40.3) in participants
with mild HI and matched controls (mild), respectively; and
386 L (36.8) and 370 L (76.6) in those with moderate HI and
matched controls (moderate), respectively.
Steady-state pharmacokinetics
Based on predose samples, steady-state conditions were
achieved after 10–13 days of cenicriviroc in participants with
mild or moderate HI, and after 7–10 days in matched con-
trols. HI delayed time to steady-state concentrations.
Day 14 pharmacokinetic results
The geometric mean concentration–time profiles of cenicrivi-
roc on Day 14 are displayed in Figure 1a (mild HI group and
matched controls [mild]) and Figure 1b (moderate HI group
and matched controls [moderate]). Following the last dose
of 150 mg on Day 14, participants with mild HI had numer-
ically lower cenicriviroc exposures compared with those of
matched controls (mild), based on Cmin, Cmax, AUC0–�, and
AUC0–τ geometric means; those with moderate HI generally
had numerically increased cenicriviroc exposures compared
with matched controls (moderate) (Table 2).
The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90% CIs were
calculated for cenicriviroc AUC0–τ, Cmax, and Cmin (Table 3).
Participants with mild HI had cenicriviroc exposures �38%
(AUC0–τ; GMR: 0.62; 90% CI: 0.38, 1.02), 40% (Cmax; GMR:
0.60; 90% CI: 0.37, 0.96), and 27% (Cmin; GMR: 0.73; 90%
CI: 0.43, 1.23) lower than those of matched controls; but
exposures varied substantially among them. However, those
with moderate HI had cenicriviroc exposures �55% (AUC0–τ;

3.21) higher than those of matched controls.
Participants with HI had a numerically prolonged t1/2 and
higher Vz/F compared with matched controls (Table 2). The
geometric mean (CV%) t1/2 was 29.7 h (31.9) and 22.0 h (16.5)
in participants with mild HI and matched controls (mild),
respectively, and 37.6 h (77.7) and 22.4 h (27.3) in those with
moderate HI and matched controls (moderate), respectively.
Apparent CL/F was numerically higher in participants with
mild HI compared with mild controls (mild), while the oppo-
site trend was observed in the moderate HI cohort.
The
geometric
mean
(CV%)
accumulation
ratio
(Day 14 AUC0–τ/Day 1 AUC0–τ) was less than twofold in
participants with mild HI and matched controls (mild) (1.42
(52.4) and 1.84 (33.1), respectively) (Table 2). In those with
moderate HI, a geometric mean (CV%) accumulation ratio
was observed that was numerically higher than in matched
controls (moderate) (2.08 (33.7) and 1.49 (42.2), respectively).
Based on these, the effective half-life (CV%) of cenicriviroc
in participants with mild HI is 13.7 h (52.4), matched controls
(mild) 21.2 h (33.1), moderate HI 25.4 h (33.7), and matched
controls (moderate) 15.0 h (42.2).
Overall, cenicriviroc exposures were not increased in par-
ticipants with mild HI compared with those in matched
controls (mild). In patients with moderate HI, cenicriviroc
exposures were increased, based on Cmin, Cmax, AUC0–τ,
AUC0–�, ratio of the geometric means, compared with those
in matched controls (moderate).
Safety and tolerability
Cenicriviroc was well tolerated, regardless of HI (Table 4). No
safety concerns were identified in participants with HI and
no notable differences in AEs were observed either among
or between cohorts and matched controls. Headache and
gastrointestinal disorders (dry mouth, epigastric discomfort,
flatulence) were the only AEs reported in at least two partici-
pants and were of mild severity.
All AEs were mild (Grade 1) in intensity, except a severe
(Grade 3) AE of “abnormal liver function test” in a moder-
ately impaired participant with a history of cirrhosis and HCV
infection (�18 years since diagnosis). ALT and AST increased
from Grade 2 at baseline (2.8 and 3.2 x ULN, respectively) to
Grade 3 on Day 10 (5.3 and 5.5 x ULN, respectively), and
both returned to Grade 2 the next day. The participant com-
pleted the study without dosing interruption. One participant
in the mild HI group withdrew from the study after the first
cenicriviroc dose, due to an AE of mild vomiting.
Another participant with moderate HI and a history of
HCV infection and cirrhosis (�20 years since diagnosis) had
Grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme abnormalities, which were not
reported as AEs by the investigator (Grade 2 ALT at base-
line (2.9 x ULN) elevated to Grade 3 (5.1 x ULN) on Day 14;
Grade 3 AST at screening (5.9 x ULN) elevated to Grade 4

cenicriviroc dosing. No other clinically relevant changes were
observed in laboratory tests, vital signs, or electrocardiogram

Biomarker analysis
Cenicriviroc CCR2/CCR5 antagonist activity
The effects of cenicriviroc treatment on CCR2 ligand (CCL2)
and CCR5 ligands (CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) were assessed
to determine its antagonistic activity. CCL2 and CCL4
increased rapidly and significantly by Days 7 and 14 across
all groups, suggesting potent CCR2 and CCR5 blockade (all
P < 0.05 vs. Day 1 [predose]) (Figure 2). Compared with Day
1 (predose), CCL2 increased by a median fold-change of 4.4–
5.5 across all groups by Day 7 (all P < 0.05) and 4.8–6.0 by
Day 14 (all P < 0.05). Similarly, CCL4 increased by a median
fold-change of 1.8–2.3 and 1.6–2.5 after 7 and 14 days of
treatment, respectively (all P < 0.05). Higher CCL2 levels
correlated with higher cenicriviroc median Cmax (r = 0.39;
P < 0.05).
CCL5 increased significantly during cenicriviroc treatment
in matched controls (moderate) only (P = 0.008; Day 14 vs.
Day 1), but CCL3 levels did not change significantly in any

CCR2 and CCR5.
Effects of cenicriviroc on proinflammatory cytokines
To determine whether the reciprocal increase in CCL2, CCL4,
and CCL5 levels associated with the potent CCR2 and CCR5
blockade increased systemic inflammation, levels of proin-
flammatory cytokines were measured. IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-
1β levels did not change significantly in any group during
cenicriviroc treatment (Supplementary Figure S1). However,
participants with moderate HI had significantly higher levels
of IL-6 on Day 7 (P < 0.05) and Day 14 (P < 0.01), and sig-
nificantly lower levels of TGF-β on Day 1 (P < 0.05), Day 7
(P < 0.01), and Day 14 (P < 0.05) compared with those

in matched controls (moderate). Although TGF-β levels
increased in the moderate HI group during cenicriviroc treat-
ment (Day 1 vs. Day 14; P < 0.01), levels at Day 14 were not
significantly different from those in the mild HI and matched
controls (mild) groups. Therefore, it was concluded that ceni-
criviroc did not increase systemic inflammatory markers.
Effects of cenicriviroc on biomarkers of intestinal perme-
ability and bacterial translocation
As cenicriviroc decreased sCD14 levels in HIV-positive par-
ticipants (Study 202),27 markers of intestinal permeability
(I-FABP) and bacterial translocation (flagellin, LBP
, sCD14)
were measured in this population. None of these markers
changed significantly within each group during cenicriviroc
treatment (Supplementary Figure S2); however, participants
with moderate HI had higher levels of flagellin, LBP
, and
I-FABP compared with matched controls (moderate). These
differences only reached statistical significance at Day 14
(flagellin: 4.80 vs. 0.40 ng/mL; LBP: 31.1 vs. 23.8 ng/mL;
I-FABP: 2887 vs. 1061 pg/mL; all P < 0.05). Flagellin levels
correlated with I-FABP and ALT at Day 1 (rs = 0.44 and rs =
0.41, respectively; all P < 0.05) and Day 14 (rs = 0.40 and rs
= 0.45, respectively; all P < 0.05) (Figure 3). Thus, cenicrivi-
roc did not have an effect on biomarkers reflecting bacterial
translocation in this 14-day study.
DISCUSSION
This study evaluated the impact of HI on the PK and safety
of cenicriviroc. Following once-daily administration of ceni-
criviroc 150 mg over 14 days, moderate HI, but not mild HI,
increased cenicriviroc’
s exposures. Time to achieve steady-
state concentration was slightly delayed in participants with
HI compared with their matched controls. Over 14 days of
dosing in all participants, single-tablet cenicriviroc 150 mg
(current phase II formulation) achieved mean plasma con-
centrations comparable to or higher than those previously
observed at Day 14 in HIV-positive participants receiving
200 mg (previous formulation; PK substudy of Study 202).34
Exploratory analyses to evaluate pharmacodynamic effects
of cenicriviroc on CCR2 and CCR5 ligands, proinflamma-
tory cytokines, and bacterial translocation biomarkers did not
reveal any meaningful differences between subjects with nor-
mal hepatic function and HI, although effects of cenicrivi-
roc unbound fraction could not be assessed. Furthermore,
cenicriviroc was generally well tolerated, with AEs consistent
with its known safety profile. Of note, most study participants
with HI had a history of viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse. It is
unknown whether disease etiology may lead to differences
in the effects of HI on a drug’
s PK; however, this study fol-
lowed the FDA guidance and used Child–Pugh classification
for categorizing the degree of HI in patients.33

Cenicriviroc treatment resulted in rapid and reciprocal
increases in the ligands CCL2 and CCL4, suggesting potent
and durable CCR2/CCR5 blockade, in participants with HI
and normal hepatic function, similar to the findings observed
in HIV-positive participants (Study 202).27 Of note, the
dose- and concentration-dependent effects of cenicriviroc
on CCL2 levels were sustained throughout the 48-week dura-
tion of Study 202, suggesting that cenicriviroc can provide
long-term blocking of CCR2.27 Despite these increases, no
significant effects on markers of hepatic inflammation, proin-
flammatory cytokines, or biomarkers of bacterial transloca-
tion were observed in any cohort. Soluble CD14 levels did not
change in participants with HI over 14 days, in contrast to the
relative reduction in sCD14 levels observed in HIV-positive
participants treated for 48 weeks.27 The difference in these
findings may be due to the longer “on treatment” time or to
factors specific to the HIV-positive participants.35 The cor-
relation of increased circulating flagellin levels, with raised
I-FABP and ALT levels suggests an association of hepatic
inflammation with impaired gut integrity and increased bac-
terial translocation.36
PK and safety data from this study suggest that cenicrivi-
roc 150 mg can be used in patients with mild or moderate
HI. Although the prevalence of HI in patients with NASH is
unknown, several studies have shown that a substantial pro-
portion of patients with NAFLD or NASH may also be suffer-
ing from liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, and likely HI.5,37,38 Ongoing
studies will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of cenicrivi-
roc in patients with NASH and mild-to-severe liver fibrosis.30
