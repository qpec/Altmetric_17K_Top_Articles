Abstract
Background—QT-interval prolonging drug-drug interactions (QT-DDIs) may increase the risk 
of life-threatening arrhythmias. Despite guidelines for testing from regulatory agencies, these 
interactions are usually discovered after drugs are marketed and may go undiscovered for years.
Objectives—Using a combination of adverse event reports, electronic health records (EHR), and 
laboratory experiments, we sought to develop a data-driven pipeline for discovering QT-DDIs.
Methods—We mined 1.8 million adverse event reports for signals indicating a QT-DDI. Using 
1.6 million electrocardiogram results from 380,000 patients in our institutional EHR, we either 
refuted or corroborated these putative interactions. In the laboratory, we used patch-clamp 
electrophysiology to measure the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) block (the primary 
mechanism by which drugs prolong the QT interval) to evaluate our top candidate.
Results—We found both direct and indirect signals in the adverse event reports that the 
combination of ceftriaxone (a cephalosporin antibiotic) and lansoprazole (a proton-pump 
inhibitor) will prolong the QT interval. In the EHR, we found that patients on both ceftriaxone and 
lansoprazole had significantly longer QTc intervals (up to 12 ms in white men), and were 1.4

 times more likely to have a QTc interval above 500 ms. In the laboratory, we found that these 
drugs block the hERG channel in combination at clinically-relevant concentrations. As a negative 
control, we evaluated the combination of lansoprazole and cefuroxime (another cephalosporin), 
which lacked evidence of an interaction in the adverse event reports. We found no significant 
effect of this pair in either the EHR or in the electrophysiology experiments. Class effect analyses 
suggest this interaction is specific to lansoprazole combined with ceftriaxone, but not with other 
cephalosporins.
Conclusions—Coupling data mining and laboratory experiments is an efficient method for 
identifying QT-DDIs. Combination therapy of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole is associated with 
increased risk of acquired long QT syndrome

Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a ventricular tachycardia that can result in sudden death (1) and 
occurs as an adverse effect of over 40 medications that prolong the QT interval, referred to 
as acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS) (2). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
has established strict guidelines for evaluating the risk of acquired LQTS for new 
compounds when administered individually. Nonantiarrhythmic compounds that increase the 
QT/QTc interval by 20 ms or more are unlikely to be approved, and a compound associated 
with an increase of 10 ms or more would face many challenges (3). Even a 5-ms increase 
would prompt an evaluation of the risks and benefits of the new compound (3). Studies of 
both cardiac and noncardiac compounds found that a QTc interval above 500 ms is 
associated with significant risk of TdP (4,5).
Acquired LQTS is of particular concern when it is not anticipated and occurs as the result of 
a QT interval-prolonging drug-drug interaction (QT-DDI) (2,6). QT-DDIs are not routinely 
evaluated pre-clinically and can go undiscovered for years. For example, quetiapine (an 
antipsychotic agent) was on the market for nearly 10 years before reports of a QT-DDI with 
methadone (an analgesic agent) prompted investigation into a possible mechanism (7). It 
took 3 more years before a label change was made to caution against the use of quetiapine in 
combination with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval.
Large clinical databases, such as electronic health records (EHR), represent an opportunity 
to rapidly detect QT-DDIs and save lives (8,9). Drug safety algorithms could be applied to 
health record data in near real-time, flagging potentially dangerous drug interactions before 
they become widespread. Furthermore, these analyses are in situ, and therefore focus on the 
most important drug combinations: those that are actually used in clinical practice. 
Unfortunately, analysis of medical records is complex, due to issues of missing data, noise, 
and bias (10). This leads to high false positive rates and algorithms that often will mislead 
health care providers. Laboratory experiments, especially if they are high-throughput, can be 
used to screen data-mined hypotheses for plausibility. Following observational analysis with 
confirmatory prospective experiments can remove the spurious signals, enabling clinically 
useful discoveries (11).

 We developed a data science pipeline to mine potential QT-prolonging drug-drug 
interactions from clinical databases. In this pipeline, we combine evidence of QT-DDIs from 
the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the EHR at New York-
Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC-EHR). We identified a putative 
interaction between lansoprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor [PPI]) and ceftriaxone (a 
cephalosporin antibiotic). Importantly, this is an interaction that would not have been 
suspected using current surveillance methods. We used patch-clamp electrophysiology of 
cells stably expressing human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) channels to establish a 
physiological mechanism. We further confirmed the specificity of our pipeline by also 
investigating the combination of cefuroxime (another cephalosporin) and lansoprazole, a 
drug pair that did not have evidence in FAERS of an interaction. In the clinic, patients on the 
combination of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole had 12 ms (95% CI: 7 to 15 ms) longer QTc 
intervals than patients exposed to either drug alone and were 1.4 times as likely to have a 
QTc interval above 500 ms. The negative control showed no significant effect. A QT-DDI 
between ceftriaxone and lansoprazole has the potential for significant morbidity and 
mortality.
Methods
Data Sources
We used 2 independent databases to investigate possible QT-DDIs. The first was a derivative 
of 1.8 million adverse event reports from FAERS mined for evidence of adverse drug-drug 
interactions that could not be explained by the individual effects of the drugs (TWOSIDES) 
(12). The second database was of 1.6 million electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 382,221 
patients treated at New York-Presbyterian/CUMC between 1996 and 2014. To obtain the 
heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) intervals, we wrote a parser to automatically extract the 
patient identifier, laboratory date, and QTc value from the ECG reports. QTc values were 
calculated using Bazett’s formula. We manually checked 50 abnormal ECGs (defined as 
QTc >500 ms) to confirm we were extracting the correct values, and found that the parser 
obtained 100% precision and recall. We implemented the pipeline using Python 2.7.9 and R 
v3.2.2.
Identification of candidate QT-DDIs
We used the side effect reporting frequencies in TWOSIDES to find drug pairs significantly 
over-reported with the 6 adverse events in the standardized MedDRA query for “Torsade de 
Pointes/QT prolongation”; we call this the direct evidence model (12). However, most drug 
pairs are not directly reported with QT prolongation. In addition, we performed latent signal 
detection, a method we have previously validated (13,14), to identify candidate QT-DDIs 
that lacked prior direct evidence. To perform latent signal detection, we used machine 
learning to define and validate a side effect profile of 13 side effects associated with known 
QT-prolonging compounds. Some of these latently identified side effects (such as arrhythmia 
and rhabdomyolysis) are positively correlated with QT interval prolongation, whereas others 
(such as hemorrhage and myocardial infarction) are negatively correlated (Figure 1B). We 
previously validated the method using drug pairs containing a known QT-prolonging drug 
(2), and demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity (Online Figure 1). We then scanned for

 novel drug interactions in the TWOSIDES database that matched the side effect profile; we 
refer to this as indirect evidence. We scored each drug pair for the amount of both direct and 
indirect evidence.
Evaluation of candidate QT-DDIs using EHR
We attempted to corroborate (or refute) each of the candidate QT-DDI hypotheses using the 
heart rate-corrected QTc values from ECGs stored in the CUMC-EHR. For each candidate 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) we defined an exposed cohort and 2 control cohorts. Those 
patients included in the exposed cohort were administered both drugs within a 7-day 
window. Those in the control cohorts had evidence of exposure to only 1 of the 2 drugs ever 
in their records. Only patients who had at least 1 ECG in the following 36 days after drug 
exposure (either combination or single) were included. Corroboration required that we found 
significantly longer heart rate-corrected QTc intervals in patients on combination treatment 
compared with patients on either drug alone. The CUMC-EHR uses Bazett’s formula by 
default; we also evaluated the change in QT interval using the Fridericia, Framingham, and 
Hodges correction formulae (15). Because the distributions of QTc intervals were non-
normal, we assessed significance using a Mann-Whitney U test with a Bonferroni correction 
for multiple hypothesis testing. We further verified that this effect could not be explained by 
concomitant medications (analysis of covariance with concomitant medications modeled as 
categorical variables) (14). This analysis was stratified by sex because QT interval durations 
are known to differ between men and women (16). We evaluated the effects of each drug 
pair both on individual races and on all races combined (Mann-Whitney U test). We also 
performed a post hoc power analysis to estimate our ability to detect a change in QTc 
interval for the sample and effect sizes present in our EHR (17). Only those QT-DDIs 
corroborated by the EHR data (in either men, women, or both) were considered for 
laboratory analysis.
Patch-clamp electrophysiology
QT-prolonging drugs have in common the ability to block the hERG channel (which 
conducts IKr) in the heart. We evaluated the combination of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole by 
performing patch-clamp electrophysiology of cells stably expressing IKr. Using an 
automated patch-clamp system (PatchLiner, Nanion, Delaware) in voltage clamp mode, we 
examined the concentration-dependent block of the IKr current by each drug individually, as 
well as in combination, using dimethyl sulfoxide as vehicle control (Figure 1D). We applied 
a voltage protocol with a step to +40 mV, followed by a return to −40 mV, to elicit the 
inward-rectifying tail current. This protocol was repeated every 20s for the length of the 
experiment and, after 10 consecutive sweeps in each concentration, the concentration is 
increased. We then averaged the current at the end of each drug application and normalized 
it to the control to measure the block by each compound. We assessed significance using a 
test of repeated measures on the log-normalized block percentages.
We performed patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments as described for ceftriaxone 
alone, lansoprazole alone, and ceftriaxone and lansoprazole, and similarly for the negative 
controls of cefuroxime alone and cefuroxime and lansoprazole. We evaluated the ability of 
ceftriaxone or cefuroxime to block the hERG channel at 0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 50 μM, and

 100 μM. For lansoprazole, we evaluated at 0.1 μM, 1 μM, and 10 μM. We performed 3 
combination experiments: for the combination of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole, we held 
lansoprazole constant at either 1 μM or 10 μM and increased the dose of ceftriaxone 
stepwise from 0.1 to 100 μM. To evaluate our negative control of cefuroxime and 
lansoprazole, we held lansoprazole constant at 1 μM and increased the dose of cefuroxime 
stepwise from 0.1 to 100 μM. The concentrations tested were chosen to include the range of 
plasma concentrations usually reached during routine clinical use of the drugs (1.9 to 3.9 μM 
for lansoprazole, 24 to 228 μM for ceftriaxone, and 35 to 428 μM for cefuroxime) (18–21).
Computational mechanistic model
We used a computational model of the human ventricular myocyte (22) to simulate the 
action potential for the hERG block we observed for ceftriaxone, lansoprazole, and the 
combination from our laboratory experiments. We ran the model for a ventricular action 
potential paced at 1 Hz with baseline conditions and 10% or 55% block of hERG current 
(chosen using the current block observed in the electrophysiology experiments). We 
evaluated the APD70, the action potential duration at 70% of repolarization.
Results
Candidate QT-DDI discovery via data science
We detected 889 putative signals in FAERS, of which 34 (1.42× more than expected by 
chance, p = 0.003) were corroborated by the CUMC-EHR, after multiplicity correction. 
Twenty-six were eliminated by confounder analysis for concomitant medications. The 
remaining 8 combinations could not be explained by concomitant medications and were not 
previously associated with acquired LQTS (14). We prioritized the combination of 
ceftriaxone and lansoprazole for experimental validation, as lansoprazole is available over 
the counter and is one of the top 200 most-prescribed drugs (totaling over 2.6 million 
prescriptions in 2010) (23). An interaction with a PPI could therefore have a profound 
impact on patient safety. As a negative control, we chose to evaluate the combination of 
cefuroxime and lansoprazole as, according to our algorithm, it did not match the side-effect 
profile for QT prolongation in FAERS (Figures 1A and 1B).
Comedication of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole is associated with prolonged QT in the EHR
Overall, the QTc intervals (Bazett’s correction) for male patients taking this combination 
were 12 ms (95% CI: 7 to 15 ms; n = 934) longer than patients taking either drug alone (p < 
0.001); for female patients, QTc intervals on the combination were 9 ms (95% CI: 5.2 to 
11.3 ms; n = 1,414) longer than patients taking either drug alone (p < 0.001) (Figure 1C). 
We evaluated QT interval prolongation post hoc, using the Fridericia, Framingham, and 
Hodges correction formulae. In men, all 3 were significant, with p < 0.01 (Online Table 1), 
and, in women, Fridericia and Hodges were significant, with p < 0.01. When stratifying by 
race in addition to sex, the largest effect was observed in white men (12 ms increase; 95% 
CI: 6.5 to 17 ms; p < 0.001) and black women (12 ms increase; 95% CI: 3.7 to 18.5 ms; p < 
0.001). We performed a regression analysis, which confirmed the increased sensitivity to the 
drug pair in white patients (p = 0.049, Online Table 2). In 19% of men taking the

 combination, the QTc was ≥500 ms, an accepted threshold for clinical concern (3), 
compared with 14% (p < 0.001) of patients taking only 1 drug (Table 1).
Applying the same case-control analysis to cefuroxime and lansoprazole showed no 
significant difference in QTc interval for both men (7 ms increase; 95% CI: −4.5 to 17 ms, n 
= 107; p = 0.167) and women (1.5 ms decrease; 95% CI: −9.3 to 4.3 ms; n = 228; p = 
0.155). We observed no significant changes in QTc interval when further stratifying by race. 
See Figure 1C for complete results.
We performed sample-size and effect-size analyses, which demonstrated that with 100 
patients prescribed either combination, we would be able to detect a 10-ms QT interval 
prolongation with 80% power; with 1,000 patients, the same effect size could be detected 
with 100% power (Online Figure 2).
Six hundred and three patients on ceftriaxone and lansoprazole had ECGs both before and 
after they started combination treatment. To control for baseline confounders, we performed 
a paired analysis comparing each of these patient’s highest QTc interval from ECGs 
performed up to 36 days before and after exposure to ceftriaxone and lansoprazole. We 
stratified the analysis by both sex and race. We observed a statistically significant increase in 
QTc interval for both white men (14.0 ± 4.0 ms increase; p = 6.56 × 10−4) and white women 
(12.9 ± 3.3 ms increase; p = 1.03 × 10−4). We observed no significant change in QTc 
interval for patients prescribed our negative control. See Online Table 3 for complete results.
In combination, ceftriaxone and lansoprazole block the hERG channel
Using a test of repeated measures, we found no significant effect from ceftriaxone on the 
hERG channel (p = 0.096). We found a significant effect from lansoprazole alone (p = 1.63 
× 10−4), causing a drop in current to 86.6 ± 16.7% at 10 μM (no effect at 1 μM or 0.1 μM). 
In the presence of 1 μM lansoprazole, ceftriaxone caused a dose-dependent drop in current 
(96.8 ± 13.2% of control at 0.1 μM, 89.3 ± 13.2% at 100 μM; p = 1.07 × 10−4). In the 
presence of 10 μM lansoprazole, ceftriaxone caused a dose-dependent drop in current (63.1 
± 10.9% of control at 0.1 μM, 42.4 ± 11.6% at 100 μM; p < 3.45 × 10−5) (Figure 1D, left). 
For our negative control, we saw a small block in cefuroxime alone (94.0 ± 14.8% of control 
at 100 μM cefuroxime; p = 5.62 × 10−5) but no dose-dependent response of cefuroxime 
combined with 1 μM lansoprazole (p = 0.083) (Figure 1D, right).
Computational model recapitulates clinical observations
Using the hERG current blocks observed in the electrophysiology experiments as input to 
the computational model, the APD prolongation (measured as APD70) was 9 ms for the 
combination of 1 μM lansoprazole and 100 μM ceftriaxone, and 50 ms for 10 μM 
lansoprazole and 100 μM ceftriaxone (Figure 2). For the combination of 1 μM lansoprazole 
and 100 μM cefuroxime, the APD70 was shortened by 2 ms.
No evidence of class effects between cephalosporins and PPIs
Given our identification of a putative drug interaction between a cephalosporin antibiotic 
and a PPI, we systematically evaluated all combinations of cephalosporins and PPIs for

 evidence of a drug interaction in FAERS, EHR, or both (Figure 3). The combination of 
ceftriaxone and lansoprazole in men was the only drug pair that had evidence in both 
FAERS and the EHR that also passed our confounder analysis for concomitant medications.
Discussion
New data sources present new avenues for discovery
Data science and large clinical databases present new opportunities to discover adverse drug 
effects and drug-drug interactions. This is especially true in situations where traditional 
methods are impractical or infeasible, as is often the case for DDIs. There are many 
advantages to taking a retrospective approach for detecting DDIs. The analyses are relatively 
rapid and inexpensive to perform, and, because they are in situ, they focus on drug 
combinations that are actually used together in clinical practice. In particular, our use of 
latent signal detection to mine for DDIs using side-effect profile models allows us to 
circumvent many of the limitations inherent to traditional data-mining approaches that rely 
solely on direct evidence between drug pairs and side effects (13,14). However, there are 
many disadvantages as well. Retrospective analysis, and data mining in particular, are 
notorious for their potential biases and high false discovery rates. There are simply too many 
potentially confounding variables to make strong statements about causal relationships.
Here, we present a novel strategy that couples observational data mining with laboratory 
experiments to identify QT-DDIs (Central Illustration). Our observational analysis 
establishes the presence of a clinically-significant association between comedication and a 
prolonged QT interval. There are many hypotheses that may explain such an association. For 
example, a patient prescribed the putative interacting drugs may also be prescribed a known 
QT-prolonging agent. In fact, this is what we observed. Of 34 drug combinations that were 
associated with increased QT intervals, 26 could be dismissed as likely confounded by a 
known agent. Alternatively, it may be that there is a real drug interaction, in the 
pharmacological sense. The most common physiological explanation would be hERG block; 
therefore, we tested this hypothesis for our top prediction (ceftriaxone/lansoprazole) using 
patch-clamp electrophysiology. This atypical path, going from the clinic into the lab, has 
great potential to increase the efficiency of DDI discovery.
Critical evaluation of data mining using laboratory experiments
We combined data from FAERS with our local EHR to find evidence of QT-prolonging drug 
interactions. Either data source alone provides only weak evidence of a potential DDI 
producing thousands of equivalent hypotheses. By integrating these data, we increase power 
and focus the analysis on only the strongest candidates. Most importantly, we follow up on 
these DDI hypotheses using laboratory experiments to identify a possible mechanism.
An interaction between ceftriaxone and lansoprazole is unexpected
Our top candidate, ceftriaxone and lansoprazole, would not have been suspected using 
current surveillance methods. In the clinical records we found that comedication of these 2 
common drugs is associated with significantly prolonged QTc intervals. This increase was 
highest for white men and black women, where we observed an average increase of 12 ms. It

 is important to note that if this effect size was observed for a single drug, it would be well 
above the threshold for regulatory concern during the approval stage (3). In the laboratory, 
we found that, in combination, lansoprazole and ceftriaxone block the hERG channel up to 
57.6%, corresponding with an APD70 increase of 50 ms. At these higher lansoprazole 
concentrations, it is likely that, if treated as a single entity, the combination would not have 
received regulatory approval.
Molecular mechanism of the interaction between ceftriaxone and lansoprazole
We discovered that ceftriaxone and lansoprazole were significantly associated with 
prolonged QT intervals using clinical data. Our laboratory analysis suggests that this effect 
may be mediated through the hERG potassium channel, the most common mechanism by 
which drugs prolong the QT interval. However, the molecular explanation is not clear. 
Possibilities include a chemical interaction between the 2 compounds, cooperative binding 
to the channel, or an indirect mechanism through proteins that function with hERG. 
Furthermore, we found significantly different effects when our analysis was stratified by 
race and ethnicity. White men and women appear to be sensitive to the interaction, whereas 
black men experience only an intermediate change, and women identifying as “other, 
including Hispanic” experience no detectable effect. This is consistent with the large amount 
of ethnic heterogeneity in cardiac potassium channels (24,25), and may guide a structural 
analysis of the interaction.
Prior evidence of related adverse events
Lansoprazole is a commonly used PPI that is available over-the-counter. In retrospective 
analyses, PPIs were associated with a slight increased risk of myocardial infarction (26). 
Additionally, there have been a large number of deaths reported to the FDA for patients on 
this class of drugs, although this association is not statistically significant. Our discovery of 
a drug interaction with a PPI may explain these observations, although this requires follow-
up study. Notably, evaluation of cefuroxime and lansoprazole, a pair predicted not to interact 
from the FAERS reporting frequencies, suggests that our pipeline is capable of 
distinguishing between safe and unsafe pairs, even within the same drug class.
Conclusion
We present evidence of a novel QT-DDI between lansoprazole and ceftriaxone. This 
interaction was discovered using a combination of data mining and laboratory experiments. 
Our clinical data suggest that patients on this pair of interacting drugs are more likely to 
have acquired LQTS, and the experimental study suggests that this effect may be mediated 
by blocking the hERG channel, the most common mechanism of acquired LQTS. This 
interaction appears to be specific to ceftriaxone, and does not extend to other cephalosporin 
antibiotics in combination with lansoprazole. Follow-up studies are required to confirm our 
findings and should include evaluating the mechanism of the interaction at the hERG 
channel, the effect of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole on other ion channels, and investigation 
of these drugs in combination with other hERG-blockers.

 Clinical Perspectives
Competency in Systems-Based Practice
Data science methodologies may accelerate evaluation of the safety of drug 
combinations. Data from large numbers of patients and ECGs in EHR can corroborate 
clinical event reports of adverse drug interactions and, for those involving QT-interval 
prolongation, laboratory methods can then be used to elucidate the electrophysiological 
mechanisms involved.
Translational Outlook
Further work is needed to systematically extend this paradigm to evaluate the safety of 
commonly used drug combinations in other cardiovascular domains.

 Figure 1. Data Science and Experimental Pipeline for Identifying and Validating QT-DDIs
(A) Chemical structures for ceftriaxone (cephalosporin) and lansoprazole (proton pump 
inhibitor, PPI), which we predicted would have a QT-DDI; we predicted cefuroxime 
(cephalosporin) and lansoprazole not to interact. (B) QT-DDI discovery in FAERS: data-
driven side effect profile containing latent evidence of a QT-DDI (black boxes: positive 
correlation with QT prolongation; white boxes: negative correlation). Each bar represents the 
reporting frequency of a given side effect in FAERS for ceftriaxone (green), lansoprazole 
(blue), cefuroxime (orange), ceftriaxone + lansoprazole (red), and cefuroxime + 
lansoprazole (purple). (C) Retrospective corroboration in electronic health records (EHR). 
Left: Difference in QTc interval (mean ± 95% CI) between cases (patients prescribed the 
drug pair) and controls (patients on only 1 drug). We stratified the analysis by sex (men: 
gray; women: teal) and evaluated all races combined, as well as whites, blacks, and “other, 
including Hispanic” separately. Star indicates the change in QTc intervals is statistically 
significant (Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction). We obtained 95% CIs by 
bootstrapping case and control QTc distributions, and calculating the change in median QTc 
for each iteration. Right: Percentage of patients with a QTc interval ≥500 ms (mean ± 95% 
CI), stratified by sex and race. Star indicates the combination had a significantly greater 
proportion of patients with a QTc interval ≥500 ms than either drug alone (independent-
samples Student t-test, with Bonferroni correction, comparing means of single drug and 
combination therapy percentage≥500 distributions generated using bootstrapping). (D)

 Experimental validation using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Left: Change in hERG current 
from control (mean and SD) for increasing concentrations of cephalosporin alone (dashed 
line), and increasing concentrations of cephalosporin in the presence of a single 
concentration of lansoprazole (solid lines). Right: Representative traces from each patch-
clamp electrophysiology experiment. From top to bottom: hERG-channel current in the 
presence of vehicle only (control), and then cephalosporin at 3 concentrations (0.1 μM, 10 
μM, and 100 μM); hERG-channel current in the presence of lansoprazole and then in 
combination with progressively increasing concentrations of cephalosporin. CI = confidence 
interval; FAERS = FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; hERG = human Ether-à-go-go 
Related Gene; QT-DDI = QT-prolonging drug-drug interaction.

 Figure 2. Results of the Computational Model of Ventricular Epicardial Myocytes
The APD prolongation (measured as APD70) for each case is 9 ms and 50 ms, simulating 1 
μM lansoprazole + 100 μM ceftriaxone and 10 μM lansoprazole + 100 μM ceftriaxone, 
respectively. Briefly, the model was run for a ventricular action potential paced at 1 Hz with 
baseline conditions (black) and 10% or 55% block of peak hERG current (brown and red, 
respectively). APD70 = action potential duration at 70% of repolarization; hERG = human 
Ether-à-go-go Related Gene.

 Figure 3. Analysis of Class Effects Between Cephalosporins and PPIs
We analyzed each cephalosporin and PPI pair for evidence of an interaction in FAERS 
(black box: drug pair matches side effect profile), EHR (red: patients on combination have 
significantly prolonged QT intervals compared with those on either drug alone; blue: no 
significant change between cases and controls; white: no patients on the drug pair in the 
EHR), and that the change seen in the EHR was not due to concomitant medications (red 
star). We stratified the analysis between men and women. Only ceftriaxone and lansoprazole

 Central Illustration. Ceftriaxone and Lansoprazole are Associated With Acquired LQTS
We combined mining of adverse event reports, corroboration in electronic health records, 
and experimental validation using single cell patch clamp to discover and validate a QT-DDI 
between ceftriaxone and lansoprazole. We used a data-driven profile of side effects that are 
predictive of LQTS to prioritize drug pairs pairs in FAERS. We corroborated these findings 
in the electronic health records by comparing the QTc intervals of patients administered the 
prioritized drug pair to patients exposed to either drug alone. We then validated our top 
prediction (ceftriaxone/lansoprazole) by measuring the dose-dependent changes in hERG 
channel current using patch-clamp electrophysiology.
AFib = atrial fibrillation; FAERS = FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; hERG = human 
Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene; LQTS = long QT syndrome; QT-DDI = QT-prolonging drug-
drug interaction; VTach = ventricular tachycardia.
