OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in healthcare cost
trends over 8 years in adults with diabetes and one of four
categories of comorbid depression: no depression, unrec-
ognized depression, asymptomatic depression, or symp-
tomatic depression.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the
2004–2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS) was used to create nationally representative
estimates. The dependent variable was total
healthcare expenditures for the calendar year, in-
cluding office-based, hospital outpatient, emergency
room, inpatient hospital, prescription, dental, and
home health care expenditures. The 2004–2011 di-
rect medical costs were adjusted to a common 2014
dollar value. The primary independent variable was
four mutually exclusive depression categories created
from ICD-9-CM codes and the PHQ-2 depression
screening tool. Healthcare expenditures were esti-
mated using a two-part model and were adjusted
for age, sex, race, marital status, education, health
insurance, metropolitan statistical area status, re-
gion, income level, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Based on a national sample of adults with
diabetes (unweighted sample of 15,548, weighted
sample of 17,465,579), 10.2 % had unrecognized
depression, 13.6 % had asymptomatic depression,
and 8.9 % had symptomatic depression. In the
pooled sample, after adjusting for covariates, the in-
cremental cost of unrecognized depression was
$2872 (95 % CI 1660–4084), asymptomatic depres-
sion increased by $3347 (95 % CI 2568–4386), and
symptomatic depression increased by $5170 (CI 95
% 3610–6731) compared to patients with no
depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted analyses showed that expendi-
tures were $2000–3000 higher for unrecognized and
asymptomatic depression than no depression, and
$5000 higher for symptomatic depression. Higher medi-
cal expenditures persisted over time, with only symptom-
atic depression showing a sustained decrease over time.

INTRODUCTION
The coexistence of depression and diabetes is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity, including higher rates of
complications, increased disability and lost productivity, lower
quality of life, and increased risk of death.1 Compounding this
impact is the high prevalence of diabetes and depression, with
a meta-analysis showing major depression occurring in 11 %
of individuals with diabetes and clinically relevant depression
in 31 %.2 In addition, 45 % of diabetes patients are estimated
to have undiagnosed depression,3 and patients with diabetes
are more likely to be diagnosed with depression than those
without diabetes,4 suggesting that the influence of depression
on the outcomes of patients with diabetes may be greater than
prevalence numbers alone suggest.
Major depression and depressive symptoms in patients with
diabetes are also consistently associated with decreased in-
come, increased healthcare utilization, and higher healthcare
costs.1,5 Studies have shown that healthcare expenditures for
patients with diabetes and depression are 2 to 4.5 times as high
as those of patients without depression.6,7 Differences between
those with and without depression include higher diabetes-
related costs, more time at inpatient facilities, more ambulato-
ry care visits, and more prescriptions.8–10 Patients with diabe-
tes and "probable depression" have also shown increased
healthcare costs compared to patients without depression,11
and a study of depression symptom severity found that
healthcare costs increased as the severity of depressive symp-
toms increased.7
These costs are even more important when considered at a
population level, given the high prevalence and expense of
diabetes to the US population.12 Though the recognition and
treatment of depression for patients with diabetes is consis-
tently recommended, it is less than optimal.13 Studies show
that only 50 % of diabetes patients with depression are recog-
nized in primary care settings, and diagnosis does not change
treatment patterns.13 One study examined the effects of
implementing a depression intervention for diabetes patients
in nine primary care practices, and found a 5-year mean total

 cost reduction of $3907 for patients who received the inter-
vention compared with patients receiving usual care.14 A
systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of psychological
interventions to treat depression in patients with diabetes also
found net savings, though few such studies existed.15
While research has consistently shown increased costs of
depression in patients with diabetes, we are not aware of any
studies investigating national estimates of costs for both symp-
tomatic and asymptomatic patients, or studies providing trends
over time for these costs. The present study used the Medical
Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) to investigate the impact
of depression on healthcare costs in a nationally representative
sample of patients with diabetes. Patients were categorized as
having no depression, unrecognized depression based on a
validated depression screening questionnaire, asymptomatic
depression, or symptomatic depression. This is the first study
of its kind, and it adds significantly to the literature by con-
sidering the healthcare cost differences between patients with
these four categories of depression over a period of 8 years,
using a novel cost methodology to provide national estimates.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The study used data from the 2004–2011 Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS) to estimate the cost of depression
among adults with diabetes (aged ≥18 years).
Data
MEPS provides nationally representative estimates of
healthcare use and expenditure, and is maintained and co-
sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ).16,17 It collects detailed information on indi-
vidual sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions,
healthcare use and expenditures, sources of payment, and
health insurance coverage.16 MEPS has three components:
Household Component (HC), Medical Provider Component
(MPC), and Insurance Component (IC).16,17 Information on
the HC is collected by self-reports, and the MPC requests data
on medical and financial characteristics from hospitals, physi-
cians, home healthcare providers, and pharmacies in order to
validate and supplement information received from the
MEPS-HC respondents.16,18 Diagnoses coded according to
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) are also collected as part of
the MPC.
The panel design of the MEPS survey includes five rounds
of interviews covering two full calendar years.16 Each panel
collects data from different individuals, so merging of panel
data creates a pooled cross-sectional sample. We used 8 years
of MEPS data to create a pooled sample as follows:
2004/2005, 2006/2007, 2008/2009, and 2010/2011. Adults
with diabetes were included based on patient self-reports.
MEPS does not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabe-
tes. Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 5 % of diagnosed cases are type 1 diabetes and
90–95 % of diagnosed cases are type 2 diabetes.12
For each year, we merged data for adults with diabetes from
the household survey of the medical condition files and full-
year consolidated files using the unique person identifier on a
one-to-one match.18 The pooled sample has a common vari-
ance structure necessary to ensure compatibility and compa-
rability of variables within the complex sample design.19
Analytic sampling weight variables were adjusted by dividing
by the number of years pooled. The sum of these adjusted
weights represented the average annual population size for the
pooled period, and reflected an Baverage annual^ basis rather
than the entire pooled period.20 As a result, analyses account
for the sampling weights, clustering, and stratification design
to estimate the nationally representative aggregate and incre-
mental healthcare expenditure for the US population.16,17
Medical Expenditures
The dependent variable was the direct cost calculated as total
healthcare expenditures for the calendar year of each observation.
More specifically, in MEPS, an expenditure is defined as the sum
of direct payments for care provided during the year, including
out-of-pocket payments and payments by private insurance,
Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources.16 The total medical
expenditure comprises office-based medical provider, hospital
outpatient, emergency room, inpatient hospital (including zero
night stays), prescription medicine, dental, home healthcare, and
other medical expenditures.16 The 2004–2011 direct medical
costs were adjusted to a common 2014 dollar value using the
Consumer Price Index provided by the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics (http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl).
Depression
The primary independent variable was four mutually exclusive
depression categories created from ICD-9-CM codes and the
Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) depression screening
tool. Previously validated ICD-9-CM codes 296, 300, 309,
and 311 associated with at least one office-based medical
provider, hospital outpatient, or emergency room visit, inpa-
tient hospital stay, or prescription medication were used to
identify individuals with clinical depression.21,22 Responses to
the PHQ-2 were used to identify depression symptoms. The
PHQ-2 is a two-question self-report scale included in the
MEPS questionnaire. It was designed to inquire about an
individual's depressed mood over the prior 2 weeks by asking
questions about whether the respondent had little interest or
pleasure or felt down/depressed/hopeless. Answer options for
each range from 0 to 3, with total scores of 0 to 6 representing
a summation of the values, and higher values indicating a
greater tendency towards depression.23 The PHQ-2 using a
cutpoint of ≥3 has sensitivity of 83 % and specificity of 92 %
for identifying major depression, and is often used for screen-
ing of depressive symptoms.23 The scale was developed to
indicate the probability of depression, and is not intended to
616

 measure severity or to represent a diagnosis of depression. As
such, in this analysis it is used as an indicator of the presence
or absence of symptoms as measured by the scale. Two
dummy variables were created for each patient using the
ICD-9 diagnosis and PHQ-2 cutpoint of ≥3, below which the
number of symptoms as measured by the scale indicated a low
probability of currently screening for depression.
ICD-9 and PHQ-2 measures for the same calendar year
were used to create four categories:
1.
No depression, defined as individuals with neither
depressive symptoms as determined by the PHQ-2 nor
ICD-9 diagnosis of depression;
2.
Unrecognized depression, defined as individuals with
PHQ-2 depressive symptoms but without ICD-9 diagno-
sis of depression;
3.
Asymptomatic depression, defined as individuals with
ICD-9 diagnosis of depression (diagnostic codes 296,
300, 309, 311) but without PHQ-2 depressive symptoms;
and
4.
Symptomatic depression, defined as individuals with
both PHQ-2 depressive symptoms and clinical depres-
sion by ICD-9 diagnosis (codes 296, 300, 309, 311).
Categories do not represent severity of depression, but
rather the presence or absence of a diagnosis (as defined by
the ICD-9 codes) and/or the presence or absence of symptoms
(as defined by the PHQ-2 scale).
Covariates
Adjusted analyses used covariates collected through self-re-
ports. Covariates were selected based on the literature to
include variables that account for possible variation in medical
expenditures or that address disease burden. Binary indicators
of comorbidities were based on responses to a series of ques-
tions asking whether respondents had ever been diagnosed
with specific diseases. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) thus
indicates a positive response to diagnosis with coronary heart
disease, angina, myocardial infarction, or other heart diseases.
Race/ethnicity, age, education, health insurance, and marital
status were each divided into three categories (see Table 1).
Census region and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) were
based on residence as of the end of the year. Income was
defined as a percentage of the poverty level and was grouped
into four categories.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to determine sociodemographic
and comorbidity variables across the four depression categories
among adults with diabetes over the 8-year pooled dataset.
Unadjusted mean and standard pairwise comparisons were used
to compare the total healthcare expenditures by depression cat-
egories.24 Mean expenditures between the six paired groups
were compared by sociodemographic and comorbidity variables
as well as by year.
Adjusted healthcare expenditures were estimated using a
two-part model.25,26 In the two-part model, a probit model was
estimated for the probability of observing a zero versus posi-
tive medical expenditure. Positive medical expenditure is de-
fined as any healthcare expenditure greater than zero.26
Conditional on having a positive medical expenditure, a gen-
eralized linear model (GLM) was estimated.27,28 GLM was
used instead of log OLS [ordinary least squares] regression,
since it relaxes the normality and homoscedasticity assump-
tions and avoids bias associated with re-transforming to the
raw scale.27 The results of the modified Park test verified that
the use of a gamma distribution with a log link was the best–
fitting GLM for consistent estimation of coefficients and mar-
ginal effects of medical expenditures.28,29 Multicollinearity
was checked for predictors of the two-part model, taking into
account the complex survey design. The variance inflation
factor (VIF) for all predictors used in the two-part model
indicated no multicollinearity problems. The F-test for the
two-part regression models was found to be significant, which
indicated the overall significance of the regression model.
Two-part models have been widely employed in situations
where, due to a large number of non-users of health services,
there are excess zeros in the resource use or cost data, and the
assumption of normality of the error term is not satisfied.30
Marginal effects were then estimated from the combined first
and second parts of the final model.27 To control for confound-
ing, sociodemographic factors including age, sex, race, marital
status, education, health insurance, metropolitan statistical area
status, region, income level, and comorbidities were included in
the fully adjusted model. All analyses were performed at the
individual level using STATA 13 software (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA). Statistical significance of p<0.05
was used.
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
The resulting dataset was an unweighted sample of 15,548
adults with diabetes (weighted sample of 17,465,579). Among
the adults with diabetes in the pooled sample, 10,473 (67.3 %)
individuals had no depression, 1579 (10.2 %) had unrecog-
nized depression, 2117 (13.6 %) had asymptomatic depres-
sion, and 1379 (8.9 %) had symptomatic depression.
Demographic characteristics overall and by depression cate-
gory are shown in Table 1. Unrecognized depression was more
likely in the 65–85 age group, minorities, those with less than
high school education, and low-income individuals.

 with diabetes were $10,016 (95 % CI 9589–10,442) for those
with no depression, $15,155 (95 % CI 13,587–16,723) for
those with unrecognized depression, $16,134 (95 % CI
14,885–17,382) for those with asymptomatic depression, and
$20,105 (95 % CI 18,103–22,106) for patients with symptom-
atic depression. Pairwise comparison tests showed significant
differences in mean expenditures between all paired groups
except those between asymptomatic and unrecognized
depression.
Figure 1 shows the mean expenditures per person per year
by the four depression categories. The no-depression category
showed little change across the years, and remained the lowest
of the four categories. Symptomatic depression showed a
decrease over time, but a higher sustained cost than any of
the other categories. Unrecognized and asymptomatic depres-
sion showed decreases from 2004/2005 to 2006/2007, but
gradual increases towards 2010/2011.
Figure 2 shows the mean expenditures per person per year
by the four depression categories broken down by total, inpa-
tient, outpatient, prescription, office-based, and emergency
room costs. No depression was consistently the lowest cost
category, and symptomatic depression the highest in all cost
types. Unrecognized depression showed costs similar to but
lower than asymptomatic depression, with the exception of
inpatient and outpatient costs. The two highest cost types were
inpatient and prescription costs.
Adjusted Incremental Cost Differences
for Depression Categories Among Diabetes
The results of the adjusted two-part GLM on the incremental
costs associated with the four depression categories,
sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and time trends are
shown in Table 3. In the pooled sample, after adjusting for
sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and time trend co-
variates, the incremental cost of unrecognized depression in-
creased by $2872 (95 % CI 1660–4084), asymptomatic de-
pression increased by $3347 (95 % CI 2568–4386), and
symptomatic depression increased by $5170 (CI 95 % 3610–
6731) compared to patients with no depression.

 Estimated US Burden of Depression Among
Adults With Diabetes
Finally, we estimated the aggregate cost during the period
2004–2011 among adults with diabetes. Based on the unad-
justed mean, the average annual aggregate costs for the US
population with diabetes were estimated at $21.3 billion for
unrecognized depression, $42.9 billion for asymptomatic de-
pression, and $30.3 billion for symptomatic depression. The
adjusted total incremental costs increased by $4.0 billion for
unrecognized depression, $9.2 billion for asymptomatic de-
pression, and $7.8 billion for symptomatic depression, com-
pared to those with no depression.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on a national sample of adults with diabetes, mean
medical expenditures were $5000–6000 higher for those with
unrecognized and asymptomatic depression than with no

No depression describes patients with neither self-reported depression (PHQ-2 ≥3) nor ICD-9 diagnosis of depression; unrecognized depression
describes individuals with self-reported depression (PHQ-2 ≥3) but without ICD-9 diagnosis; asymptomatic depression describes individuals with ICD-
9 diagnosis but without self-reported depression (PHQ-2 ≥3); symptomatic depression describes individuals with both self-reported depression and ICD-
9 diagnosis

 depression, and twice as high for those with symptomatic
depression. Unrecognized depression showed higher expendi-
tures than asymptomatic depression for inpatient and outpa-
tient costs, while asymptomatic depression showed higher
prescription and office-based costs than unrecognized depres-
sion. Adjusted analyses revealed that expenditures were still
$2000–3000 higher for unrecognized and asymptomatic de-
pression than for no depression, and $5000 higher for symp-
tomatic depression. These higher medical expenditures
persisted over time.
This study is the first of its kind, showing the impact of
healthcare costs over time in patients with diabetes and differ-
ent classifications of comorbid depression (unrecognized,
asymptomatic, and symptomatic). The total economic burden
of depression alone among the US population rose to an
estimated $210.5 billion in 2010.31 Results of this study show
the additional impact of unrecognized comorbid depression in
patients with diabetes at the individual and national levels ($4
billion at the population level). Asymptomatic depression also
costs significantly more than patients with no depression ($9
billion for the US population). This economic burden is im-
portant to consider given the high prevalence of depression in
patients with diabetes, the epidemic of diabetes in the United
States, and the persistent costs over time shown by this study.
Estimates in this study show that depression is a costly co-
morbidity, with only CVD and stroke showing increased costs
comparable to any of the depression categories for patients
with diabetes. Recent work on diabetes alone and chronic
kidney disease show that the costs for all individual comorbid
depression categories are higher than those for diabetes alone
($2558 per year), but lower than the costs of chronic kidney
disease ($8473 per year).32,33
These results support the call for improved recognition of
depression through increased screening at the primary care
provider level.1,13,34 Comorbid depression is associated with
decreased adherence to treatment, possibly leading to poorer
glycemic control, higher complication rates, and increased
healthcare use and cost.1 A systematic review of depression
treatment for individuals with diabetes found that interventions
were cost-effective compared to usual care.35 Therefore, in-
creased use of interventions to address depression in patients
with diabetes may result in a reduction in costs over time for
symptomatic patients, but may not be sufficient to remove
symptom load. Unrecognized and asymptomatic depression
costs individual patients nearly $3000 more per year, and are
not as often considered in interventions. While collaborative
care programs have been shown to be moderately cost-effec-
tive, the offset to costs has not been enormous.7,14,15,36 In
addition, increased mental health visits for patients with diabe-
tes and depression were effective in reducing inpatient costs,
but the savings did not offset outpatient and pharmacy costs.37
Based on this study, some costs associated with asymptomatic
depression are the result of receiving treatment (higher for
prescription and office-based visits than unrecognized depres-
sion). While the benefit of treatment to individuals is worth the
offsetting costs, providers and policymakers should strive to
develop alternatives that allow for treatment but also provide
savings to the system overall. Strategies are needed to focus
interventions on identifying patients that are symptomatic and
in need of more aggressive treatment, in addition to identifying
patients with unrecognized depression—for example, co-
located primary care and telemental health.37
This study is strengthened by the use of nationally repre-
sentative data, a large sample size, and a novel cost method-
ology; however, some limitations do exist. As with all pooled
cross-sectional data, this study cannot show causality.
Diabetes prevalence was based on self-reports rather than
medical diagnosis, although previous studies have acknowl-
edged the reliability of self-reporting of diabetes.38,39 In addi-
tion, self-reported comorbidities may not include all relevant
comorbidities, and may include those that are not medically
diagnosed. Finally, the PHQ-2 is a screening tool for major
depression and requires further assessment using a diagnostic
interview. Nevertheless, it a validated screening method, and
has shown high sensitivity and specificity for depression.
In conclusion, using a pooled dataset over 8 years, we found
that unrecognized and asymptomatic depression in patients
with diabetes each resulted in an average of $3000 higher
costs per year compared to patients without depression.
Higher medical expenditures persisted over time, with only
symptomatic depression showing a sustained decrease.
