Epidemiological evidence indicates that high consumption of tomatoes and tomato-based
products reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as CVD and cancer. Such potential bene-
fits are often ascribed to high concentrations of lycopene present in tomato products. Mainly
from the results of in vitro studies, potential biological mechanisms by which carotenoids
could protect against heart disease and cancer have been suggested. These include choles-
terol reduction, inhibition of oxidation processes, modulation of inflammatory markers,
enhanced intercellular communication, inhibition of tumourigenesis and induction of apop-
tosis, metabolism to retinoids and antiangiogenic effects. However, with regard to CVD,
results from intervention studies gave mixed results. Over fifty human intervention trials
with lycopene supplements or tomato-based products have been conducted to date, the ma-
jority being underpowered. Many showed some beneficial effects but mostly on non-estab-
lished cardiovascular risk markers such as lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidative damage,
platelet activation and inflammatory markers. Only a few studies showed improvement in
lipid profiles, C reactive protein and blood pressure. However, recent findings indicate
that lycopene could exert cardiovascular protection by lowering HDL-associated inflamma-
tion, as well as by modulating HDL functionality towards an antiatherogenic phenotype.
Furthermore, in vitro studies indicate that lycopene could modulate T lymphocyte activity,
which would also inhibit atherogenic processes and confer cardiovascular protection. These
findings also suggest that HDL functionality deserves further consideration as a potential
early marker for CVD risk, modifiable by dietary factors such as lycopene.
Lycopene: Cardiovascular health: Intervention trials: Mechanisms
Results from observational studies suggest that high con-
sumption of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of
chronic diseases such as CVD and cancer(1–3). A recent
meta-analysis of sixteen prospective cohort studies in-
cluding over 800 000 participants concluded that a higher
consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with a
lower risk of mortality, particularly from CVD(4). The
results indicated that, for the consumption of up to five
servings/d, the risk of cardiovascular mortality was
decreased by 4 % for each additional daily serving of
fruit and vegetables, and by 5 and 4 % for each addition-
al daily serving of fruit and vegetables, respectively.
However, the actual components of these foods that
confer the protective effect and the mechanisms by
which
they
act
have
yet
to
be
firmly
identified.
Potential candidate chemical compounds include carote-
noids, which represent a large family of over 700 hydro-
phobic red, orange and yellow pigments abundant in
fruit and vegetables. However, only six of them (lyco-
pene, α- and β-carotenes, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin
and lutein) are found predominantly in human serum
and
constitute
over
95 %
of
total
circulating
carotenoids(5).

 prostate cancer(6–8). High consumption of tomato-rich
diets (seven or more servings/week) has also been asso-
ciated with a 30 % reduction in relative risk of CVD(9).
Such potential benefits to vascular health from a
tomato-rich diet are often ascribed to high concentra-
tions of lycopene present in the fruit, as tomato products
usually account for the majority of the dietary intake of
this carotenoid(10,11). Blood lycopene concentrations are
strongly associated with tomato intake(12–14). Lycopene
is the most abundant carotenoid present in serum in
the American population(15) and the second contributor
to total serum carotenoids in Europeans(16). Neverthe-
less, serum concentrations are usually low and below
0·3 mg/ml(15). Based on the results mainly obtained
from in vitro studies and animal models, potential bio-
logical mechanisms by which lycopene could protect
against heart disease and cancer have been suggested.
These include cholesterol reduction, inhibition of oxida-
tion processes, modulation of inflammatory markers,
enhanced intercellular communication, inhibition of
tumourigenesis and induction of apoptosis, metabolism
to retinoids and antiangiogenic effects(17). However,
with regard to CVD, the results from intervention studies
have given mixed results. The present paper reviews the
evidence for the health benefits of high lycopene intake,
and proposes the integration of novel mechanisms by
which lycopene could confer cardiovascular protection.
Lycopene sources, structure, intake and bioavailability
Lycopene is a symmetrical tetraterpene comprising eight
isoprene units. It is non-provitamin A carotenoid with
very potent antioxidant properties due to its ability to
efficiently quench singlet oxygen species(18) and hypo-
chlorous acid(19). Tomato and tomato-based products
are the main dietary source of lycopene and account
for over 80 % of lycopene intake in western countries,
but watermelon, pink grapefruit, apricot, pink guava
and papaya also significantly contribute to lycopene in-
take(5). Dietary intake of lycopene varies greatly depend-
ing on the populations considered. Median intake in the
UK is about 1 mg/d(20,21), while estimated intakes in
American and Italian populations are over 7 mg/d(22,23).
Lycopene occurs naturally mainly as all-trans iso-
mer(24), whereas cis isomers are the most abundant
form in plasma and tissues(13,25). Isomerisation occurs
during food preparation and processing, as well as
physiologically during digestion and absorption, which
could impact on bioavailability(26). However, many un-
certainties remain with regard to lycopene metabolism.
The process of trans-to-cis isomerisation can occur in
the stomach(27), enterocytes(28) and liver(29). Intestinal ab-
sorption of lycopene is facilitated by scavenger receptor
B1(30) and CD36(31). Partial metabolisation can occur in
the enterocyte via the action of two enzymes, β-carotene
15,15′-oxygenase-1, which has been associated with blood
lycopene status(32) and β-carotene-9,10′ oxygenase-2(33).
Due to the difficulty of producing labelled lycopene
molecules, few tracer studies have been carried out to
date.
An
accelerator
MS
study
using
14C-labelled
lycopene (92 % trans lycopene) showed that all trans
lycopene was extensively isomerised (5-, 9-, 13- and
15-cis lycopene isomers) after dosing and rapidly meta-
bolised into polar metabolites excreted into urine(34).
The rapid excretion of 14CO2 found in that study also
suggested that part of the lycopene ingested was quickly
fully oxidised. A recent compartmental modelling study
using 13C-labelled lycopene found no differences between
the bioavailability of cis- and all-trans lycopenes (24·5 v.
23·2 %, respectively). However, the study revealed that
postabsorptive trans-to-cis isomerisation influences tissue
and plasma isomeric profiles(35). The half-life of plasma
lycopene was originally estimated to range between 12
and 33 d(36). However, the latest tracer study showed half-
lives of 5·3 and 8·8 d for all-trans and cis isomers,
respectively(35).
Interindividual variability in lycopene bioavailability
is at least partly genetically controlled and has been
linked to a combination of twenty-eight SNP in sixteen
genes involved in lycopene and lipid metabolism(37).
Another recent study examined the association between
variation across the genome (over seven million SNP
included) and serum concentrations of lycopene in a
multiethnic population involving 2581 post-menopausal
women(38).
The
study
identified
three
novel
loci
(SCARB1, DHRS2 and SLIT3) associated with serum
lycopene concentrations, the last two being specific to
African Americans. These findings could perhaps explain
the interindividual variability in physiological responses
to increased lycopene intake frequently observed in
human subjects.
Observational studies
The majority of epidemiological evidence suggests that
serum lycopene concentration is inversely associated
with CVD risk(39–41). More recently, high serum concen-
trations of carotenoids, including lycopene, have been in-
versely associated in middle-aged men with lower intima-
media thickness, suggesting that high serum lycopene
concentrations could protect against early atheroscler-
osis(42). Results from the same study showed that in
men within the highest quartile of serum lycopene con-
centration, the risk of ischaemic stroke and any stroke
was reduced by 59 and 55 % respectively compared
with the lowest quartile(43). Results from the 2003–2006
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
showed similar associations with biomarkers of CVD
risk such as LDL-cholesterol, homocysteine and C-react-
ive protein (CRP) concentration(44). However, studies
assessing dietary intake of lycopene usually showed no
association
between
dietary
intake
and
CVD
risk(9,45–48). These findings are supported by the results
of a recent meta-analysis of prospective studies on lyco-
pene intake and serum concentrations and the risk of
stroke, which showed that circulating concentrations
of lycopene, but not dietary lycopene, was associated
with a significant decrease in the risk of stroke(49).
Such discrepancy between dietary intakes and serum con-
centrations
could
be
linked
to
genetic
variability

 modifying lycopene absorption. However, it has also
been attributed at least partly to misclassification of lyco-
pene intakes(22). When compensating for this potential
issue by using repeated measures of intake obtained
over a 10-year period, lycopene intake was found to be
significantly inversely associated with CHD incidence(22).
Mechanistic studies
The discovery of mechanisms (Fig. 1) by which lycopene
and derivatives can modulate cellular activity mainly
originated from the extensive work carried out in cancer
cells, and can be partially related to the antioxidant
properties of lycopene(50). Thesemechanismshavebeenre-
cently reviewed(17,51), and include induction of apop-
tosis(52,53) and inhibition of cell proliferation involving the
modulation of the expression of genes involved in the phos-
phatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase
B and mitogen-activated protein kinases signalling path-
ways as well as genes involved in the regulation of the cell
cycle(54–56). The induction of cell differentiation(52) via the
restoration of gap junctions(57) has also been suggested.
Other mechanisms include prevention of oxidative dam-
age(58,59), inhibition of angiogenesis(59,60), induction of
phase II enzymes(61–63), interaction with growth factors
and sex hormones(64) and the induction of nuclear receptors
activation(65–67). Lycopene has also been found to confer
photoprotection(68). Interestingly, it has been recently
shown that lycopene, via bioactive metabolites, possesses
partial pro-vitamin A activity transmitted via retinoic acid
receptor-mediated signalling in mice(69).
Many studies using cellular models relevant to athero-
sclerosis have also been used in recent years, and a
scheme integrating the potential cellular mechanisms by
which lycopene could modulate atherosclerotic processes
has been proposed(70). Vascular endothelial dysfunction
is commonly regarded as a key event in atherogenesis.
Lycopene, at physiological concentrations, can protect
endothelial cells from oxidative damage induced by hydro-
gen peroxide(71). Lycopene also inhibits cytokine-induced
adhesion molecule expression and monocyte–endothelium
interactions(72). Inhibition of agonist-stimulated platelet ag-
gregation have also been observed at physiologically rele-
vant concentrations(73,74). Experiments carried out in
THP-1 (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) macro-
phages showed that lycopene can inhibit cholesterol synthe-
sis as well as scavenger receptor expression, which suggests
that itcould potentially modulatefoamcellformation(75,76).
Lycopene has potent antioxidant chemical properties,
and therefore much interest has focused on its potential
ability to inhibit LDL oxidation, which is central to the
initiation of atherosclerosis. The outcomes of such studies
largely depend on the conditions used to oxidise the LDL
particles. However, considering the very central position
of lycopene within the core of LDL particles, it is unlikely
that lycopene under normal physiological conditions can
effectively protect LDL from oxidation(77).
Atherosclerosis has a strong inflammatory component.
The anti-inflammatory properties of lycopene have been
tested using various relevant cell culture models, includ-
ing macrophages, foam cells and smooth muscle cells and
the outcomes of such studies have been previously
reviewed(70). Overall, results suggest that lycopene can
neutralise reactive oxygen species, as well as reduce the
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and metallopro-
teinases by macrophages(78,79), inhibit smooth muscle cell
proliferation(80) and decrease monocyte proliferation(81).
More recently, work in our group showed that low,
physiological concentrations of lycopene can significantly
inhibit mitogen-activated T lymphocyte activation by
modulating mechanisms involved in early activation(82).
Lycopene
significantly
inhibited
mitogen-activated
lymphocyte proliferation by up to 40 % and also signifi-
cantly inhibited the expression of an early marker of acti-
vation, CD69, as well as IL-2 secretion. However, IL-2

 receptor expression and cell-cycle profile were unaffected
by lycopene. T lymphocytes are an active component of
the chronic inflammatory process during atherogenesis.
A reduction in T-cell activation would reduce the inflam-
matory responses involved in atherosclerotic plaque for-
mation and development.
Whether lycopene acts directly, or indirectly via oxi-
dised metabolites, still remains to be determined. Food
processing-induced or metabolic oxidation of lycopene
can lead to the formation of apo-lycopenoids, a family
of compounds containing a ketone or an aldehyde func-
tion. Particular interest has focused on apo-lycopenals,
which can modulate cellular function viathe antioxidant re-
sponse element transcription system(64) and inhibit tumour-
igenesis(83). Apo-10′-lycopenoic acid can also modulate
adipocyte activity via the retinoic acid receptors(84).
Interestingly, lycopene has recently been found to re-
duce the formation of advanced glycation end products
in HK-2 cells and in rat kidneys, which led to a concomi-
tant decrease in the expression of their receptors and
NF-κB and matrix metalloproteinase 2(85). Advanced
glycation end products and the activation of their recep-
tors lead to oxidative stress and inflammation, and
enhanced generation and accumulation of advanced gly-
cation end products have been associated with increased
risk for cardiovascular complications associated with
atherosclerosis and diabetes(86). The inhibition of these
processes by lycopene could therefore represent addition-
al mechanisms by which lycopene can protect against
CVD and related disorders.
Intervention trials
Human intervention studies related to the cardioprotec-
tive effects of lycopene have given mixed results. The ma-
jority (thirty-five) of fifty-four intervention trials using
lycopene supplements or tomato-based products carried
out between 1998 and 2010 found beneficial effects on
CVD risk markers(87). However, only thirteen studies
included conventional markers of CVD (such as blood
pressure, CRP and serum cholesterol concentrations) of
which only five showed beneficial effects. The majority
of studies (thirty-one out of forty-nine), which included
non-established markers for CVD risk, such as lipid per-
oxidation, DNA damage, LDL oxidation, platelet acti-
vation and inflammatory markers other than CRP,
showed some benefits of increasing lycopene intake.
Unfortunately, the search strategy was not provided
and the quality of the study design was not assessed in
that review. Most of the studies lacked statistical power
as they usually included a relatively low number of
volunteers (below 100). The majority of the trials (forty-
three out of forty-nine) were also of short duration (up to
30 d) and some were poorly controlled. The sources of
lycopene (supplements, tomato juice, soup, puree or to-
mato extract) as well as the daily dose provided (from
5 to 80 mg) also varied considerably between studies,
making comparison between trials difficult.
Comparison of efficacy between tomato intake and
lycopene supplementation in modifying CVD risk factors
was also recently reviewed(26). The authors included stud-
ies reporting effects on LDL oxidation, various markers
of oxidative stress and damage, inflammatory markers,
endothelial function, blood pressure and serum lipid con-
centrations. Overall, and despite the heterogeneity of
results, growing evidence suggests that increasing lyco-
pene intake from tomato products would be more effect-
ive compared with supplements for improving serum
lipids, protein and DNA damage and some inflamma-
tory markers including CRP, whereas lycopene supple-
mentation seems to be more effective in reducing blood
pressure compared with tomato-based foods. The reason
behind this disparity is unclear. Tomatoes contain other
components such as ascorbic acid, potassium and a range
of bioactive phytochemicals such as tomatine, a steroidal
glycoalkaloid and its metabolite, tomatidine, which
could also provide health benefits(17). However, it is pos-
sible that some of these compounds interfere with the
hypotensive effect of lycopene. Only a few trials reported
on blood pressure (five supplementation trials and three
tomato studies), which is insufficient to draw any sub-
stantial conclusion. The mechanisms by which lycopene
could modulate blood pressure remain also to be
elucidated.
A recent pilot study carried out in forty heart failure
patients (twenty-three men, seventeen women) showed
that the daily consumption of 29·4 mg lycopene (one can
daily of V8 juice) for 30 d significantly reduced serum
CRP concentrations in women only, while compliance to
the
intervention
seemed
similar
between
men
and
women(88). The effect of lycopene supplementation (7 mg
daily over 2 months) on vascular function was recently
assessed in healthy volunteers and statin-treated CVD
patients in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind
intervention trial(89). Lycopene supplementation signifi-
cantly improved endothelial-dependant arterial vasodila-
tion by 53 % in patients under optimal secondary
prevention treatment, but had no effect in healthy volun-
teers. These results suggest that lycopene supplementation
could positively modify cardiovascular outcomes in high-
risk populations and could increase the efficacy of second-
arypreventionpharmacologicaltreatmentforheartdisease.
In 144 patients with sub-clinical atherosclerosis, as
assessed by the measurement of carotid artery intima-
media thickness, lycopene supplementation (20 mg/d)
for 12 months significantly improved the efficacy of lu-
tein supplementation (20 mg/d) to decrease carotid artery
intima-media thickness (0·035 mm decrease with lutein
supplementation alone v. 0·073 mm decrease with both
lutein and lycopene supplementation(90)). These results
suggest a synergistic effect between lutein and lycopene.
However, this trial should have ideally also included a
group receiving lycopene only to confirm whether the lar-
ger decrease was due to the combination of lutein and
lycopene or lycopene alone. Whether the magnitude of
reduction
of
carotid
artery
intima-media
thickness
observed is clinically relevant needs to be evaluated
with the inclusion of other risk factors, as meta-analyses
suggest that carotid artery intima-media thickness alone
only minimally improves disease-risk predictive power
beyond traditional risk factors(91).

 The first worldwide comprehensive, well-controlled, ran-
domised trial aiming to determine whether increased lyco-
pene consumption, from supplement or high tomato diet,
can modulate markers of CVD risk was carried out in the
UK a few years ago(21). After a 4-week run-in period with
a low-tomato diet, 225 volunteers (ninety-four men and
131 women) aged 40–65 years were randomly assigned
into one of three dietary intervention groups and asked
to consume a control diet (low in tomato-based foods),
a high-tomato-based diet (35–50 mg lycopene/d), or a con-
trol diet supplemented with lycopene capsules (10 mg/d)
for 12 weeks. Despite excellent compliance in all treatment
groups, none of the systemic markers (inflammatory mar-
kers, markers of insulin resistance and sensitivity, lipid
concentrations) significantlychangedafter the dietaryinter-
vention. Blood pressure and arterial stiffness were also un-
affected by the treatments, indicating that increased
lycopene intake, from supplement or from a tomato
based-rich diet, is ineffective at reducing conventional
CVD
risk
markers
in
the
population
considered.
However, in order to identify novel potential markers for
cardiovascular risk modifiable by lycopene, the authors
examined the effect of the intervention on HDL-functional-
ityand HDL-associated inflammationina subgroup ofpar-
ticipants (eighteenper treatmentgroup).The resultsshowed
that increasedlycopeneintake using supplements orby diet-
ary means over 12 weeks reduced serum amyloid A content
in serum and HDL3
(92). These changes were associated with
a concomitant improvement in HDL functionality, as mea-
sured by the activity of HDL-associated enzymes such as
paraoxonase 1, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase and
cholesterol ester transfer protein, potentially enhancing
HDL-antiatherogenic properties.
Conclusion
The integrated potential mechanisms involved in the anti-
atherogenic effects of lycopene are summarised in Fig. 2.
Despite some discrepancies between observational and inter-
vention studies, the evidence for cardioprotective effects of
lycopeneisincreasing.Therecentdiscoveryofnovelmechan-
isms by which lycopene could exert its beneficial effects also
warrant further research, and also suggest novel biomarkers
for cardiovascular risk such as HDL functionality, suscep-
tible to modification by dietary intervention. The identifica-
tion of specific genetic patterns linked to interindividual
variability in lycopene bioavailability also highlights the re-
quirement for further research to understand how genotype
modifies the cardiovascular benefits of lycopene.
