Perceptual restoration of masked speech
in human cortex
Matthew K. Leonard1,2, Maxime O. Baud3,*, Matthias J. Sjerps4,5,* & Edward F. Chang1,2,6
Humans are adept at understanding speech despite the fact that our natural listening
environment is often filled with interference. An example of this capacity is phoneme
restoration, in which part of a word is completely replaced by noise, yet listeners report
hearing the whole word. The neurological basis for this unconscious fill-in phenomenon is
unknown, despite being a fundamental characteristic of human hearing. Here, using direct
cortical recordings in humans, we demonstrate that missing speech is restored at the
acoustic-phonetic level in bilateral auditory cortex, in real-time. This restoration is preceded
by specific neural activity patterns in a separate language area, left frontal cortex, which
predicts the word that participants later report hearing. These results demonstrate that during
speech perception, missing acoustic content is synthesized online from the integration of
incoming sensory cues and the internal neural dynamics that bias word-level expectation and
prediction.

poken communication routinely occurs in noisy environ-
ments1 such as restaurants, busy streets and crowded
rooms, making it critical that the brain can either
reconstruct or infer the sounds that are masked2,3. Often, the
perceptual system ‘fills in’ those obscured sounds4 without the
listener’s awareness5. This continuity effect is a crucial feature of
speech perception, where relevant contrastive sounds (phonemes)
last only a few hundred milliseconds, on the same temporal scale
as many extraneous masking sounds (for example, clattering
dishes and car horns). The brain mechanisms that give rise to this
striking perceptual experience known as phoneme restoration are
unclear.
To examine the neural basis of perceptual restoration, we
developed a set of stimuli that differed in a single critical
phoneme (‘original’; for example, ‘faster’ [/fæstr/] versus ‘factor’
[/fæktr/]; Fig. 1a,b, other examples include: ‘novel’ versus ‘nozzle’,
’rigid’ versus ridges’, ’babies’ versus ‘rabies’: Supplementary Fig. 1,
see Supplementary Table 1 for all examples), following work by
Samuel6. Auditory neural populations on the human superior
temporal gyrus (STG) discriminate between speech sounds7,
allowing us to compare responses to each of the two original
stimuli. To evoke perceptual restoration, participants also heard
stimuli that had the critical phoneme completely replaced with
broadband noise (‘noise’; /fæ#tr/, /n>#=l/, /rFdW=#/, /#ebiz/;
Fig. 1c). On each trial, participants reported which of the two
original words they heard. Listeners subjectively heard one word
or the other (not both) on each presentation of a given noise
stimulus (Fig. 1d; see also the Methods section for a description of
the behavioural pilot study). As in natural listening conditions,
many factors can influence whether a listener will experience
perceptual restoration, and it is even more difficult to know a
priori whether a particular stimulus will be perceived in a bistable
manner on separate trials. Despite these challenges, we succeeded
in identifying a set of stimuli where each participant perceived the
identical noise stimulus as both possible original words. To
explicitly bias participants to hear the noise stimuli as specific
words, a subset of patients heard the stimuli following sentence
frames (for example, ‘He went to the bookstore to buy the
[/n>#=l/]’; see the ‘Methods’ section; examples of sentence-biased
data are presented in Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).
While participants listened to these stimuli, we recorded direct
cortical activity from a high-density multi-electrode electrocorti-
cography (ECoG) array implanted for the clinical purpose of
seizure localization. Direct neural recordings possess excellent
spatial and temporal resolution with a high signal-to-noise ratio,
allowing the detection of speech signals at the level of individual
phonetic features7. These properties offer a powerful method to
address the cortical representation of subjective perception on a
single-trial basis8. The task and stimuli allowed us to examine
whether neural responses to noise were more, or less, similar to
the perceived phoneme on individual presentations. Specifically,
we
asked
whether
the
speech
auditory
cortex
generates
representations of the missing phonemes in real time.
Results
Single electrode restoration effects. To evaluate whether cortical
responses to noise stimuli (for example, /fæ#tr/) were similar to
responses to the original speech sounds, we examined electrodes
that discriminated the two original phonemes. For example, an
electrode over left non-primary auditory cortex (STG; Fig. 1e;
Supplementary Fig. 1) showed a larger high-gamma response
(increased power at 70–150 Hz) to /s/ compared with /k/ begin-
ning B100 ms after the onset of the critical phoneme (99% CIs
not overlapping; Fig. 1f, solid lines). Therefore, this electrode
differentiates ‘faster’ and ‘factor’ by encoding the difference
between fricative (/s/) and plosive (/k/) speech features B100 ms
after the onset of the critical phoneme7,9.
Next, the noise stimulus trials were sorted according to which
word the participant reported hearing. When /fæ#tr/ was
perceived as /fæstr/, the electrode showed a stronger response
than when the stimulus was perceived as /fæktr/ (99% CIs not
overlapping; Fig. 1f, dashed lines). Critically, during the time
window of maximal neural discriminability between the two
original stimuli, the neural responses to the noise stimulus closely
tracked the neural responses to the original stimuli (B120–
240 ms after critical phoneme onset, consistent with typical STG
response latencies, 99% CIs overlapping for the perceived
phoneme, but not the other phoneme, Fig. 1f). We did not
observe systematic differences in the nature of the online
restoration effect when the stimuli were embedded in sentence
contexts (Supplementary Fig. 1), therefore we combined the data
from the single word and sentence tasks. However, we present
example effects from both tasks in the following sections.
To quantify the magnitude of this effect, we computed a
restoration index (RI) for each electrode, which reflects the
distance between each noise response and each original response.
During the auditory response time epoch immediately following
the critical phoneme, the RI showed that responses to noise were
more similar to the perceived phoneme (an example for the single
electrode is shown in Fig. 1g). Across all participants, word pairs,
and
electrodes
(Supplementary
Fig.
3),
significant
neural
phoneme restoration effects began around the onset of the
critical phoneme. The absolute value of the difference between RI
time-courses shows that neural populations discriminate between
the two perceptions of the noise stimulus with similar timing as
they do between the two perceptions of the two original stimuli
(Fig. 1h). Neural phoneme restoration was strongest B150 ms
after critical phoneme onset (one-sample t test across 131
electrodes Po0.05, false discovery rate corrected for 91 time
points), consistent with the relatively short latency encoding of
acoustic information9, and consistent with online warping of
noise to phoneme percepts.
As discussed above, it is difficult to predict whether and when
listeners will experience bistable perceptual restoration on a given
stimulus. Therefore, we presented participants with many word
pairs to maximize the chances of finding bistable effects. In
addition to our analysis of the bistable stimuli, the subset of
stimuli for which bistable perception did not occur can still be
used to characterize the similarity in neural processing between
the noise stimulus and each of the two originals. This can provide
additional confirmation of the online neural restoration effect.
For example, one participant always heard /w3#=rz/ as ‘waters’,
and not ‘walkers’ (Fig. 2a–e). On electrodes that discriminated the
two original phonemes /t/ and /k/, neural responses to noise
closely tracked neural responses to the original phoneme that was
perceived (Fig. 2f,g). Across all stimuli that did not elicit bistable
perception, the mean RI illustrated the online restoration effect
beginning B150 ms after critical phoneme onset (Fig. 2h;
one-sample t test across 920 electrodes Po0.05, false discovery
rate corrected for 91 time points), consistent with stimuli that
elicited bistable perception.
These results confirm the general timing of neural restoration
that we observed in the important cases of bistable perception.
However, it is difficult to rule out the influences of various
acoustic and perceptual factors in biasing listeners to hear the
noise as only one sound. For example, it is known that the
acoustic similarity between noise and the perceived phoneme
influences the strength of perceptual restoration2,10, as do
coarticulatory cues in the preceding speech sounds (which were
mostly excised from these stimuli, but could still be present in
subtle forms). Therefore, to allow us to examine the mechanisms

 for examining how electrode population neural responses encode
the fine-scale spectrotemporal features of acoustic input. The
stimulus
reconstruction
filters
were
created
using
neural
responses to a natural speech corpus. In the example pair,
‘faster’ versus ‘factor’, the two original spectrograms are distingui-
shed primarily by a high-frequency frication component during
the critical phoneme (Fig. 3a,b, green arrow). The neural
reconstructions of the original stimulus spectrograms clearly
reflected the fricative in ‘faster’, which was absent for ‘factor’
(Fig. 3c,d, green arrow). When the spectrogram of the noise
stimulus (/fæ#tr/) was reconstructed separately for each percept,
the primary distinction that again emerged was the high-
frequency component when the noise was perceived as /s/ but
not /k/ (Fig. 3e,f, green arrow).
Across all word pairs and participants, the mean correlation
between the original and noise reconstructions of a perceived
phoneme was higher compared with the correlation between the
reconstruction of an original phoneme and the other noise
percept (r ¼ 0.58 versus r ¼ 0.37). In particular, the power
spectrum of the critical phoneme was closely matched for
original and restored versions of the same sound (Fig. 3g; see also
Supplementary Fig. 2 for an example from the sentence task;
Mann–Whitney U test on Euclidean distances between critical
phoneme spectra for all word pairs in frequencies that maximally
discriminate originals, z ¼ � 2.14, P ¼ 0.03, n ¼ 24).
To confirm that reconstruction of spectrotemporal features is
driven by auditory cortex, we performed the analyses separately
for STG and frontal electrodes, regardless of whether individual
electrodes in these areas discriminated between the two original
phonemes. We found that for STG electrodes, reconstruction of
the critical spectrotemporal distinction between /k/ and /s/ (high-
frequency frication) is apparent for both original and noise
‘faster’, but not for ‘factor’ (Supplementary Fig. 4c–f). These
results are highly consistent with what we observed using all
electrodes that discriminate original /k/ and /s/ (Fig. 3), and in
fact slightly improve the fidelity of the reconstruction, particularly
in low frequencies. In contrast, reconstruction using only frontal
electrodes was poor, and did not represent any distinctive features
of the stimulus spectrograms (Supplementary Fig. 4g–j). We
observed the same pattern for ‘novel’ and ‘nozzle’ in the sentence
task, where the high-frequency reconstruction is driven entirely
by
STG
electrodes
(Supplementary
Fig.
5).
These
results
demonstrate
that auditory neural population responses to
restored phonemes reflect a processing bias of the noise burst
towards the spectrotemporal acoustic features of the perceived
sound.
Pre-stimulus bias effects. It is remarkable that auditory cortex
processes the noise input as distinctive phonetic information so
rapidly. To understand how online restoration is possible, we
performed several additional analyses. Behaviourally, for items
presented in the single word paradigm, listeners were more likely
to hear whichever original word in the pair they heard previously
during the task (mean ¼ 75.8%±21.1% of trials). For example, in
the sequence of trials, if they heard ‘faster’ before a noise trial,
/fæ#tr/, they were more likely to report the noise as ‘faster’. This
suggests that rapid online restoration is at least partially related to
perceptual, lexical and/or semantic priming12–14.
In addition to priming effects, there is growing evidence that
stochastic fluctuations in ongoing cortical activation can influence
sensory and perceptual processing15. These fluctuations may be
task-irrelevant,
but
can
reflect
attractor
states
that
alter
perception. To explore how such rapid processing of noise as
phonemic percepts is possible, we leveraged single-trial analyses
of neural population dynamics16. We visualized brain states using
principal component analysis (PCA) to represent activity across
electrodes covering both auditory and non-auditory areas over
time as trajectories through a lower-dimensional ‘neural state-
space’. This qualitative analysis provides an opportunity to
examine the temporal evolution of activity through the network
without imposing anatomical priors on which brain regions
should contribute to different effects. The first two principal
components (accounting for 47.1% of the variance across electro-
des; mean±s.d. across subjects ¼ 39.4±12.2%; Supplementary

 participant’s perception beginning around the middle of the
critical phoneme (Supplementary Fig. 7, blue arrow; Supple-
mentary Fig. 8).
Unexpectedly, we also observed a difference between the two
noise
percepts
that
began
before
the
critical
phoneme
(Supplementary Figs 7 and 8, orange arrow). We can better
examine these early brain states using the noise trials alone
because each trial is categorized solely according to the listener’s
subjective perception of the same stimulus. To characterize the
spatial and temporal neural activity patterns that give rise to this
effect, we applied a single-trial linear classification analysis to
quantify the differences in neural activity patterns for each
percept (the previous RI analysis was designed to examine the
similarity of each noise trial to each original stimulus, and
therefore might not be sensitive to non-stimulus-driven differ-
ences between responses to the noise stimuli). In line with the PC
analysis, we observed that noise trials were classified accurately
before critical phoneme onset (one-way t test against 50% chance
level t(5) ¼ 2.73, Po0.035; Fig. 4a, orange arrow; maximum
single subject accuracy ¼ 92.7%, occurring 130 ms before critical
phoneme onset, and B130 ms after word onset, the exact timing
of which was variable across word pairs; Supplementary Fig. 9).
We only observed this effect for noise trials because the pre-
critical phoneme bias is a primary source of information that
determines the eventual percept. In contrast, the percept on
original trials is largely determined by the acoustic differences
between the critical phonemes. Although there are presumably
pre-critical phoneme effects for original trials, they are not
detectable in the present paradigm since the eventual acoustic
cue—typically a much more reliable source of information—will
overcome those biases13.
This pre-critical phoneme separability of noise trials presum-
ably reflects
brain
states
that
bias
subsequent
perception
according to the same phoneme categorization processes that
represent the actual sounds after hearing the critical phoneme.
We trained a classifier on a 110 ms window around the time when
the original stimuli are maximally discriminable, and tested it on
all other time points for both original and noise trials. For noise
trials, the time period from � 300 to � 50 ms before the critical
phoneme still showed a trend for above-chance classification
accuracy (one-way t test t(5) ¼ 2.25, Po0.075, uncorrected),
although it was less than when separate classifiers were trained
over time (Supplementary Fig. 10). This suggests that before
speech input, neural states already reflect predictions about
upcoming speech sounds17, and deeply influence how those
sounds are perceived. Pre-stimulus neural bias explains why
listeners’
perception
of
noise
fluctuates
across
trials,
and
furthermore provides evidence for top–down modulation of
speech representations18,19.
To localize the brain areas that were involved in pre-stimulus
bias, we mapped the classifier weights on the brain. To determine
whether there were significant effects of hemisphere (left, right),
location (supra-Sylvian, sub-Sylvian), and condition (original,
noise), we ran an ANOVA with these factors across all electrodes
for all subjects. There was a significant three-way interaction
(F(1,516) ¼ 6.8, Po0.01), allowing us to test specific post-hoc
hypotheses. During the pre-critical phoneme time period, both
original and noise trials showed strong weights in bilateral STG
and medial temporal gyrus (MTG) that were not significantly
different across conditions (two-sample t test t(60.78) ¼ � 2.21,
P40.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons, n ¼ 34;
Fig. 4b). However, strong weights for noise trials were also
observed in left inferior frontal gyrus, pre-central gyrus and post-
central gyrus to a greater extent than for original trials (two-
sample t test t(34.52) ¼ � 7.40, Po10 � 7, Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons, n ¼ 27; Fig. 4c). Frontal neural
populations are known to be critical for integrating contextual
information20, and here we show that these computations can
manifest as a pre-stimulus bias that predicts how ambiguous
input is subsequently perceived21.
After critical phoneme onset, maximal classification accuracy
was 75% for original trials and 70% for noise trials (one-way t test
t(5)¼ 13.63, Po10 � 4; Fig. 4a, blue arrow). Across participants, the
latency of peak accuracy was not significantly different for original
and noise trials (paired t test t(10) ¼ � 0.96, P ¼ 0.36), consistent
with the online phoneme restoration effects observed in Fig. 1h.
This post-critical phoneme onset restoration effect was mapped
primarily to bilateral STG. Classifier weights in left STG and MTG
were significantly stronger for original than noise trials (two-sample
t test t(54.70) ¼ 4.07, Po10� 4, Bonferroni corrected for multiple
comparisons, n ¼ 34; Fig. 4d,e). This is likely due to auditory neural
populations being strongly tuned for spectrotemporal acoustic
differences, which are not present in the noise condition7.
Discussion
Together, these results demonstrate that auditory speech circuits
in the human brain are remarkably robust to sub-optimal

 listening conditions, even in cases where the acoustic input is not
physically present. The ability to effectively cope with missing
acoustic content22–25
is a critical adaptation for effective
communication26 and for general auditory processing in natural
situations. Finding that auditory neural populations are not only
robust to complete interruptions of the acoustic signal, but
actually generate representations of the missing sound, provides a
powerful demonstration of the disconnect between the true
nature of sensory input and our perception27.
Even under clear listening conditions, the internal dynamics of
speech perception networks are highly influenced by predictions
related to multiple levels and timescales of linguistic and memory
representations17,28,29. Our results suggest a role for left inferior
frontal cortex in generating these predictions and bias signals
during speech perception. Previous work has demonstrated a
top–down modulatory role of these same areas for speech
comprehension14,30,31, which is consistent with a network
hierarchy that is driven by rapid prediction updating mecha-
nisms32. While strongly adaptive for communication, abnormal
processing in these same circuits could provide novel mechanistic
insights into the perceptual nature of auditory distortions
associated with schizophrenia33,34, where sounds are often
misperceived especially in the context of noisy interference.
The unexpected
finding
of
robust
pre-critical
phoneme
classification opens the door for novel investigations of the
interactions between internal neural states and bottom-up
sensory input. In particular, it will be important to disentangle
the independent and interacting contributions of stochastic brain
states13,35,36 that reflect ongoing task-irrelevant activity but
impact perception, and predictive signals15,29,37, which may be
related to learned lexical representations38,39. Our results do not
unambiguously disentangle these two possibilities, however there
is evidence that both may deeply influence perception.
Furthermore, it remains unclear whether these pre-critical
phoneme bias signals are a prerequisite for perceptual restoration.
In our data, there are a small number of examples where
classification accuracy before critical phoneme onset is closer to
chance, yet subjects still report hearing the missing phoneme,
which suggests that the bias signals may simply modulate the
extent or speed of restoration. Among the paradigms that may
help provide more specific interpretations of the bias signals,
previous work has utilized task designs where restored and non-
restored trials can be compared directly24, and have identified left
inferior frontal regions as important in perceptual restoration.
More generally, the observation of a warping of the acoustic-
phonetic representation in STG that is preceded by predictive
effects in a higher-order cognitive region (left inferior frontal
cortex) is inconsistent with models of speech perception that
posit post-perceptual decision processes as the locus of restora-
tion39. Although we cannot unambiguously identify the nature of
these higher-level representations (for example, lexical, semantic
and so on), we propose that our results are more consistent with
speech perception models that allow for online modulation of
perceptual
representations
by
higher-level
linguistic
infor-
mation38. Ultimately, these findings demonstrate that speech
perception at the acoustic level is deeply influenced by neural
processes related to prediction and integration of contextual
knowledge.
Methods
Participants. Five human subjects (4 female, mean age 38.6 years, range 30–47)
underwent the placement of a high-density subdural electrode array (4 mm pitch)
over the lateral surface of the brain. No subjects had a history of any cognitive
deficits that are likely to be relevant to the aims of the present study. All were left
hemisphere language-dominant, and all but one were native English speakers
(one subject was a native Italian speaker, but was completely fluent in English).
Two participants were implanted on the left hemisphere and three were implanted
on the right hemisphere. All participants gave written informed consent before
surgery, and all protocols were approved by the Committee on Human Research
at UCSF.
Stimuli and tasks. We developed a set of word pairs that allowed us to examine
how the brain processes the same acoustic stimulus when it is perceived two
different ways. 130 words were selected by searching an online corpus40 for words
that were five phonemes and two syllables long, and had an English neighbourhood
density of one, meaning that replacing a single phoneme in the word creates only
one other word in the language (for example, /fæstr/ versus /fæktr/). Stimuli were
synthesized using the built-in ‘Alex’ voice in Mac OSX. To create the restoration
stimuli, the critical phoneme was identified in Praat41, and it was excised along
with surrounding coarticulatory cues. The silent gap was then filled with 1/f noise
that was matched to the root-mean-square amplitude of the phoneme it replaced to
provide a plausible masker for restoration. Six subjects participated in a pilot study
modelled on previous phoneme restoration behavioural studies2,3 where they
listened to these stimuli and indicated what word they heard, how confident they
were in their response, and which phoneme had been replaced. Twenty word pairs
with high confidence ratings and a range of accuracy on replaced phoneme
identification were selected for the neural study. We specifically selected stimuli
where pilot subjects heard the noise as both possible words, however, we also
included word pairs that had particularly strong confidence ratings, even though
only one alternative was heard. Since the strength of perceptual restoration can
vary within individuals, we presented ECoG participants with this larger
set of words to ensure that we would capture examples where they experienced
bistable perception.
Three participants (two left hemisphere and one right hemisphere) completed
10–12 blocks of the single word repetition task, where they heard each of the three
versions of the 20 words (for example, /fæstr/, /fæktr/, /fæ#tr/) in a random order
within each block, and were asked to repeat what they heard on each trial. After
each production, the experimenter advanced to the next trial, meaning that there
was a variable inter-stimulus interval. For the right hemisphere patient, 10 stimuli
(appoint/anoint, ethics/epics, option/auction, proper/proffer, safety/safely, service/
nervous, sorrows/borrows, torture/torpor, waters/walkers and woven/woken) were
removed from the task, since they did not produce bistable perception, or the
originals were not perceived correctly in the first two patients (two stimuli were
added for this patient: menu/venue and engage/enrage). For all patients, other
stimuli were excluded from analysis if listeners did not correctly perceive the
originals. There were only a small number of cases in which the originals were not
perceived correctly, mostly due to difficulty in splicing sounds with unnatural
coarticulatory cues, or the relative low lexical frequency of one of the words. Two
right hemisphere participants completed 3–6 blocks of the sentence context task,
where four word triplets were preceded by semantically congruous (‘On the
highway he drives the car much faster’), incongruous (‘On the highway he drives
the car much factor’) or biased (‘On the highway he drives the car much [/fæ#tr/]’)
frames (three repetitions of each critical word in each context per block). They
were asked to indicate with a button press whether the sentence made sense or not
(note that it is possible for listeners to rationalize some incongruous sentence
meanings, which may make the task somewhat difficult). We did not observe any
appreciable differences in either the behavioural or neural results between tasks,
and therefore included data from both tasks in all analyses. However, we present
examples from each task separately (for example, Fig. 1 versus Supplementary
Fig. 1; Fig. 3 versus Supplementary Fig. 2) to demonstrate the similar effects
observed. There were four word pairs on which subjects showed bistable perception
for the noise stimuli, defined as perceiving the noise as each of the possible words
on at least 25% of trials (Supplementary Table 1). Other word pairs did not yield
bistable perception, but still produced robust neural phoneme restoration effects
consistent with participants’ reported perception on each trial (Fig. 2). Every
participant showed behavioural and neural phoneme restoration effects (including
bistable perception).
Data pre-processing. Electrocorticography was recorded with a multichannel
amplifier optically connected to a digital signal processor (TuckerDavis Technol-
ogies). Channels and time segments containing artifacts or excessive noise were
removed before a common average reference across rows of the 16 � 16 electrode
grid. Grid placement was determined solely by clinical considerations, and typically
did not include more dorsal or anterior prefrontal regions. The high-gamma
(70–150 Hz) analytic amplitude was extracted using previously published proce-
dures7, and was z-scored relative to a 500 ms pre-stimulus window. Each trial was
time-locked to the acoustic onset of the word. Since the measures of neural
phoneme restoration were based on reliable differences between the original stimuli
in a word pair, we selected electrodes that distinguished those stimuli using z-score
thresholds for the difference between originals. These z-scores varied across
subjects between 1 and 2.25 (however, see below for confirmation that these
thresholds are not critical for the observed effects). Electrodes that showed these
differences during a time window from the onset of the critical phoneme to the
offset of the word were included in subsequent analyses. This resulted in 6–56
electrodes per word pair (Supplementary Table 1).
To ensure that the results were not an artifact of the electrode selection process,
we performed each analysis with two alternative electrode sets: (1) A less stringent

 criterion for which electrodes showed differences between originals, and (2)
All electrodes on the ECoG grid. In all cases, results were qualitatively similar,
therefore we present the data from electrodes that showed the greatest differences
between originals. We also confirmed our results using anatomical region-of-
interest analyses. For example, we demonstrated that spectrogram reconstruction
was similar when using selective electrodes versus all electrodes over STG (but not
frontal cortex electrodes; Supplementary Figs 4 and 5; note that this includes all
supra-Sylvian electrodes). We ultimately chose to be largely agnostic to functional
anatomy priors because recent results demonstrate that non-auditory cortical
regions are selective to acoustic properties42, and functional clustering of
mesoscopic neural signals often outperforms anatomical region-of-interest
approaches43–45.
For single electrode analyses, phoneme restoration effects were quantified in
the high-gamma evoked responses by calculating 99% confidence intervals with a
bootstrapping procedure with 1,000 randomizations. Time points that satisfied the
following confidence interval criteria were considered to show significant phoneme
restoration effects:
(1) Orig1aOrig2
(2) (Orig1 ¼ Noise1) & (Orig1aNoise2)
(3) (Orig2 ¼ Noise2) & (Orig2aNoise1)
Restoration index. To quantify the degree of neural phoneme restoration on each
electrode, we defined the RI as:
RIi;j ¼ D0

where the RI on electrode i at time point j is a function of the relative distance
between the noise stimulus response and the two original stimulus responses. D1 is
the Euclidean distance between the noise and original 1, and D2 is the distance
between the noise and original 2. D0 is the distance between the two originals.
RI values were calculated on each electrode at each time point for each percept. The
sign of the RI is arbitrary, however its definition ensures that positive values reflect
the similarity of the response to noise with one original word, and negative with the
other original word. This means that each percept in a bistable word pair is
ultimately assigned an arbitrary sign. Therefore, to combine data across word pairs,
we calculated the magnitude of the difference between RI values for a given word
pair. For word pairs that did not produce bistable perception, positive RI values
were arbitrarily assigned to the word participants perceived.
Stimulus spectrogram reconstruction. We used a decoding method that
calculates a linear mapping between electrode population neural activity and the
acoustic spectrogram of each stimulus46. Briefly, this method relates a neural
response R on electrode n at time t to the stimulus spectrogram S at time t and
frequency band f (ref. 11):

Reconstruction filters were learned from data collected during separate testing
sessions for each subject from a natural speech corpus47 with filter time lags from
-300 to 0 ms. These filters were then fit to the phoneme restoration word triplets to
obtain reconstructed spectrograms. Reconstructions were performed on the mean
of the trials for each condition, however similarly robust results were observed with
single trial analyses. To quantify the fit of the reconstructions, 2D correlations were
calculated between all pairwise combinations of original and noise stimuli.
Statistical comparisons on the power spectra of the critical phonemes were
calculated using the frequency bands that best discriminated the two original
stimulus spectrograms (90th percentile of frequencies), and computing the
Euclidean distance between those frequencies for each condition. Since filters were
derived from passive listening to natural speech, the reconstructions are not related
to explicit phoneme decisions, but instead reflect the spectrotemporal sensitivities
of underlying neural populations.
Neural ‘state-space’ analysis. To visualize neural activity patterns across elec-
trodes, we used principal component analysis, an unsupervised dimensionality
reduction method16. For each subject, the data were reshaped into an n time points
x trials by p electrodes matrix. The PCs represent optimal linear combinations of
electrodes along a set of orthogonal bases, and therefore describe the variance
across the neural population. Plotting the activity of each PC against time or
multiple PCs against each other provides visualizations of trajectories through this
lower-dimensional space as each stimulus is processed. To determine the
contributions of each electrode to each PC, we plotted the PC weights on the brain.
Stimulus classification. A series of linear support vector machines were trained to
classify the participant’s reported perception (chance ¼ 50%) from the neural
population responses. Due to relatively small sample sizes, data were augmented at
each time point by concatenating neural responses from a sliding symmetric
110 ms time window. Leave-one-out cross validation was used for each classifier to
prevent over-fitting. Separate classifiers were trained and tested on original and
noise trials, however, identical parameters were used in all cases. To determine
which brain regions contributed to classification, the squared beta values from
Matlab’s fitcsvm function were plotted on the cortical surface across subjects and
word pairs using a 4.5 cm Gaussian smoothing kernel. These values are analogous
to weights in a linear regression model, describing the relative impact of each
electrode on the definition of the support vectors. Weights were statistically
compared across conditions during the pre- and post- critical phoneme time
windows using independent samples t tests with Bonferoni corrected P values.
