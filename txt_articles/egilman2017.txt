INTRODUCTION
Using one of the few data sources publically available,
the
Australian
Mesothelioma
Surveillance
Registry
(AMSR), Leigh and Driscoll [2003] published a retrospec-
tive study of the risks of mesothelioma amongst brake
workers and concluded that workers exposed to asbestos
released from brakes had elevated rates of mesothelioma.
This conclusion provided the basis for the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to reject Canada’s trade complaint
opposing France’s ban on asbestos products [WTO, 2000]. In
response, lawyers representing the automobile manufactur-
ing companies commissioned a reanalysis of the data [Kelsh
et al., 2007].1 We sought to reevaluate the AMSR data to
understand how the company-sponsored research contra-
dicted the independent researchers’ conclusions.
The Original Data Set and Results
In 1980, the National Occupational Health and Safety
Commission of Australia (NOHSC) launched a pilot program

 named the Australian Mesothelioma Surveillance Program to
track the occurrences of histologically confirmed mesotheli-
oma cases in Australia. In 1986, the program was slightly
modified and renamed the Australian Mesothelioma Surveil-
lance Registry (AMSR) by allowing the usage of a
questionnaire in 40% of the cases instead of direct interviews
[Ferguson et al., 1987; Anon, 2002]. In May 2002, the
NOHSC released a report regarding the data it had collected
from 1986 to 2001 [Anon, 2002]. In this report, NOHSC listed
78 cases whose circumstances of exposure were to “brake
linings-made/repaired” (Appendix 1: NOHSC, 2002). These
78 folios produced by NOHSC were identified because they
contained the search term “�brake�” (Witheridge, 2004).
NOSHC also disclosed that “For circumstances of exposure to
asbestos to be reported as ‘brake linings-made/repaired’, it is
not necessary for the patient to have made or repaired brake
linings him/herself but that the exposure was likely to be as a
result of the making or repairing of brake linings, as in the case
of a person working in the vicinity of someone making or
repairing brake linings.”2
The AMSR report concluded there was a ten-fold
increased mesothelioma rate amongst brake mechanics
identifying “58 mesotheliomas among brake mechanics
with no other exposures to asbestos” (p.303) [WTO, 2000].
Leigh and Driscoll Conclusion
In their 2003 article, Malignant Mesothelioma in
Australia, 1945–2002, Leigh and Driscoll [2003] reported
a 0.7% lifetime risk amongst vehicle mechanics, using the 78
individuals with exposure to asbestos through brake linings.3
Leigh followed their published paper with a more conserva-
tive analysis of the data in a letter to the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) seeking to dissuade the EPA from
responding to industry efforts to minimize the risks of
asbestos exposure to brake workers that the EPA had
published in a brochure referred to as the “Gold Book”
[Leigh, 2003]. In his letter, Leigh reported a 0.65% lifetime
risk (RR: 2.96 to all other Australian occupations) amongst
individuals exposed to brake lining repair (n ¼ 73) and a
0.38% lifetime risk (RR: 1.7 to all other Australian
occupations) amongst individuals where brake lining repair
was the only source of asbestos exposure (n ¼ 43).
Kelsh et al. Conclusion
In 2007, Michael A. Kelsh, Valerie A. Craven, Mary
Jane Teta, Fionna S. Mowat, and Michael Goodman
reanalyzed both the WTO’s and Leigh and Driscoll’s
analysis in Mesothelioma in vehicle mechanics: is the
risk
different
for
Australians?
[Kelsh
et
al.,
2007].
DaimlerChrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and
General Motors Corporation funded the study. The authors
claimed there was an alleged discrepancy in the literature
regarding occupational risk conclusions for vehicle mechan-
ics. Kelsh et al. attempted to explain the high risks that Leigh
reported by evaluating differences in exposure character-
istics between Australian motor mechanics and their North
American and European counterparts, the quality of the
AMSR data and its classification, and the method of
calculating risks used by Leigh.
Kelsh et al. did not report any differences in occupational
exposures between Australian and US auto mechanics; they
claimed Leigh’s folio and risk calculation methods were
wrong. Kelsh et al. concluded that the elevated risks Leigh
reported where due to inaccurate assumptions used in
developing
risk
estimates
amongst
Australian
vehicle
mechanics and the misclassification of the 78 folios produced
by NOHSC that contained the search term “�brake�.” Kelsh
et al. concluded that only 38 of the cases were “definite motor
mechanics” and that of these only 18 were “definite motor
mechanics with no other asbestos exposures mentioned.” Of
these 18, they questioned the occupational completeness of 15
cases. Kelsh et al., therefore, stated that Leigh and Driscoll’s
conclusions were unreliable. They concluded that only three
of the 78 folios could be considered mesothelioma cases
whose only exposure was from asbestos containing brakes.
METHODS
For the analysis and categorization of these cases, we
obtained copies of the 78 hard-copy AMSR folios that were
identified with the search term “�brake�” by NOHSC, which
were produced in litigation. We evaluated each file and
categorized them as follows: (1) the number that were
employed as brake mechanics; (2) the number that were
employed as brake mechanics with no other asbestos
exposure besides brake work or repair; and (3) the number
that had no other asbestos exposure besides brake work or
repair. We, then, compared our results to those of Kelsh et al.
and Leigh and Driscoll. We received a spreadsheet that
revealed Kelsh et al.’s classifications. We compared this to
Leigh and Driscoll’s classifications.
RESULTS
In our re-analysis of the 78 folios, we determined that 57
were employed brake mechanics, 35 were employed brake
mechanics with no other asbestos exposure besides brake
work or repair, and 41 of these cases had no other asbestos
exposure besides brake work or repair. Our classifications

 differed significantly from those of Kelsh et al. (see Table I).
We determined that there were 35 brake mechanics which
had no other documented asbestos exposure; 21 brake
mechanics with other asbestos exposure; six non-brake
mechanics with no other exposure to asbestos besides
brake work; 15 non-brake mechanics with other exposures
besides brake work (manufacturing lagging, etc.); and one
motor mechanic where it was unclear if there was other
asbestos exposure. The differing classifications are shown in
Table I. A detailed table of the folios, including their original
descriptions, Kelsh et al.’s rationale, and our rationale are
given in Appendix 1.
DISCUSSION
Kelsh et al. sought to identify occupational motor
mechanics who had no confounding asbestos exposures and a
work history they deemed complete. Kelsh et al. methodi-
cally reduced the relevant cases by following very stringent,
poorly explained criteria for inclusion. An unpublished
protocol for the Kelsh et al. study, revealed in litigation (see
Appendix 2), required that for a case to be classified as a
“motor mechanic,” the folio had to fall under the US
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 4211, which
they deemed to include “motor mechanic,” “apprentice
mechanic,” “diesel motor mechanic,” or an Armed Forces
equivalent of “motor mechanic” (according to the Australian
Standard Classification of Occupations). The protocol notes
that “mechanic’s assistant“ was a different code from “motor
mechanic” (code 9999, which signifies “Nonclassifiable
Establishments”) [US Department of Labor, 2016] but it is
unclear if they would include this classification. Kelsh et al.,
however, excluded two cases that they classified as “trades
assistants” despite clear brake exposure listed in the original
folios: folio 43 states: “Assisted mechanics in the workshop
[. . .] there was generally asbestos about and he also assisted in
the removal of brake linings, threw out the old linings and
brought new lining in”; Folio 59 states: “Trades Assistant
(exposed to asbestos when changing brake linings).”
The protocol excluded other occupations that were listed
under a different SIC code. These included: auto electricians,
panel
beaters,
service
station
attendants,
aircraft
mec
hanics, and “Mechanic (Diesel and Heavy Earthmoving
Equipment).” By relying on the SIC code classifications, Kelsh
et al. excluded individuals who performed non-occupational
brake work, informal brake mechanics, amateur mechanics,
part-time mechanics, and secondary exposure cases.
Kelsh et al. did not provide further information on the
dismissed folios, which included two “trades assistants”
(Folios #43 and 59), aircraft brake mechanics (Folios #2 and
69), heavy machine brake mechanics (Folios #58, 62, 64, and
67), railway brake mechanics (Folios #57 and 68), and others
who described their occupations as mechanics working with
brakes but failed to write “motor mechanic” in their folios
(Folios #1, 3, 4, 24, 27, 59 74, and 75).
Kelsh et al. excluded folios because they allegedly had
other non-brake asbestos exposures. The protocol included a
list of other occupations with asbestos exposure that
determined which cases were removable from the exposed
cohort. The guidelines used to identify such cases as
“possible” or “likely” asbestos exposure where taken from
two tables in Teta et al.’s study, Mesothelioma in
Connecticut, 1955–1977. Occupational and Geographic
Associations [Teta et al., 1983, Kelsh et al., 2007]. Teta
et al. [1983] state that their tables were created ad hoc by
Hilton C. Lewinsohn, MD, who served as the medical
director of both Union Carbide Corporation and Turner &
Newall
asbestos
mining
and
product
companies.
Lewinsohn’s classification was not based on a job analysis,
worker interviews, or industrial hygiene assessment. Teta
et al. [1983] used their classification scheme to develop a
quantified indicator for the duration and severity of
occupational asbestos exposure. A score of one or two
were assigned to job titles under the “possible” and “likely”
asbestos exposure categories, respectively [Teta et al., 1983].
Teta et al. [1983] concluded that individuals with occupa-
tions categorized as “possible” asbestos exposure (a score of
one) under the age of 70 years and individuals with an
occupation
categorized
as
“likely”
asbestos
exposure
(a score of two) under the age of 50 years did not have an
increased risk of developing mesothelioma [Teta et al.,
1983]. Despite the fact that Teta et al. [1983] concluded that
worker’s with scores of one or two did not experience any
increase in asbestos disease, Kelsh et al. excluded cases who

 had worked in these job categories because of alleged
confounding exposure. Additionally, Kelsh et al. explored
whether or not there were differences in exposure character-
istics between Australian and North American vehicle
mechanics, yet they did not extend such scrutiny to
differences in occupational descriptions; they did not
question whether it was appropriate to apply Connecticut
occupational categories to Australian workers.
Moreover, Kelsh et al. deemed that only three of the 18
definite motor mechanics with no other asbestos exposures
mentionedhad“adetailedoccupationalhistorywithatleastthree
jobs recorded” (they report that nine folios had only one listed
occupation and six had only two) (see Fig. 1). The assumptions
here are as follows: (1) their job histories were incomplete, not
just short; and (2) that the hypothetical jobs not listed were
potentially jobs with asbestos exposure. This approach could be
considered conservative or cautious, but this type of caution
shifts the final estimates of risk in favor of asbestos brakes not
causing mesothelioma. A conservative estimate interested in
protecting worker health would want to include folios that might
have the potential of only asbestos brake exposure as opposed to
the potential of additional exposures.
To support their argument that work with asbestos brakes
does not increase the risk of mesothelioma, Kelsh et al.
presented a table that they claimed summarized the epidemio-
logic studies of mesothelioma among vehicle mechanics. They
cite 19 studies. However, four of the authors [Goodman et al.,
2004] had previously stated that six of these studies were
unreliable and excluded them from a meta-analysis of brake
worker risk in 2004. Using a quality scoring system—assessing
for factors such as pathological diagnosis, specific asbestos
exposure, and study design—Goodman et al. [2004] found that
nine studies, six of which were included in Kelsh et al., “had an
overall negative score (i.e., less than 0) and were considered
unreliable. These studies were only mentioned for complete-
ness and were not included in the meta-analysis” [Goodman
et al., 2004]. Kelsh et al. also included three studies [Hansen,
1989; Woitowitz and Rodelsperger, 1994; Agudo et al.,
2000] that Goodman et al. [2004] “considered less useful due to
methodological shortcomings.”

Corporate Corruption of Science—Another Asbestos Example
155
 CONCLUSION
The Kelsh et al. study was commissioned by lawyers
representing automobile companies that desired to develop
scientific manuscripts that could be used in court to defend
lawsuits brought by workers who have developed cancer as a
result of exposure to asbestos brakes.1 Of concern is that this
company-sponsored research was not designed to protect
worker health but rather to defend automobile manufacturing
companies in litigation.
Litigation-generated science for “product-defense” is
part of a greater legacy of corporate-sponsored production of
science. Litigation-generated science can lead to an imbalance
in the scientific literature in cases, such as asbestos brakes,
where independent researchers are not producing literature at
the same rate [Michaels and Monforton, 2007]. Michaels and
Monforton [2007] found that 20 of 26 papers (77%) on
asbestos brakes written by US-based researchers were
litigation-generated. Others have determined that studies
conducted with financial conflictsof interest are more likely to
reach conclusions favorable to the funders over independent
studies [Boden and Ozonoff, 2008]. Asbestos mining and
product manufacturing companies have manipulated medical
literature to avoid paying compensation to injured workers for
over 80 years [Hardy and Egilman, 1991; Egilman and
Reinert, 1995; Egilman et al., 1998, 2011, 2013, 2014;
Egilman and Billings, 2005; Egilman, 2016].
Kelsh et al.’s analysis failed to address the central issue:
Does exposure to asbestos through brake work increase
mesothelioma incidence? At each step, their rationale is
designed to exclude as many cases as possible, not to consider
the possibility that brake work increases mesothelioma risk.
As economist and sociologist Gunner Myrdal noted: “Values
are always with us... There can be no view except from a
viewpoint. Prior to answers there must be questions. In the
questions raised, the viewpoint has (already) been chosen and
the valuations implied.” Kelsh et al. incorporated their
viewpoint in the question they chose to answer and their
findings thus create doubt about the relationship between
brake work and mesothelioma.

Occupations
included
in
code
for
motor
mechanic:
�
In
1996
and
2001
census,
“apprentice
mechanic” is same four-digit code as “motor
mechanic” (4211) so categorize as a motor
mechanic. However, there is also a code for
“mechanic’s assistant” which is a different
four-digit code (9999).
�
It does not appear that a separate census code
exists specifically for motor mechanics of
farm machinery (unless would be coded
under one of the various farming categories
which include maintaining equipment), so
categorize as a motor mechanic.
�
Coding
for
“motor
mechanic”
includes
“Diesel motor mechanic.”
�
In ASCO Second Edition (used in 2001 and
1996 census), jobs held by members of the
Armed Forces are classified together with
their civilian equivalents where these exist
and to a number of other specific occupations.
Thus, motor mechanics working in the Armed
Forces, may be coded as “motor mechanics”
by the census.

If yes to #6, years of employment as motor mechanic
mentioned? Y or N

If yes, specify

If yes or unclear, specify
Notes:
�
If a “mechanic” who worked on brakes ¼ Y
�
If a “mechanic” with no information ¼ U
�
If case worked as a motor mechanic outside
Australia ¼ Y
�
If case mentioned any brake work:
�
But does not specify if associated with being a
mechanic ¼ U
�
But does not specify if occupationally or non-
occupationally performed ¼ U
•
Occupations with unique codes, thus should
not be coded as a motor mechanic equivalent:
�
Auto electricians are coded separately from
motor mechanics in at least the 1986, 1991,
1996, 2001 census.
�
Panel beaters are coded separately from
motor mechanics in at least the 1976, 1981,
1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 census.
�
Service station attendants are coded sepa-
rately from motor mechanics in 1976, 1981,
1996, and 2001 census (not clear how coded
in 1986 and 1991 census).
�
Aircraft mechanics are coded separately from
motor mechanics.
�
Dredges are heavy equipment used to dredge
waterways and “Mechanic (Diesel and Heavy
Earthmoving Equipment)” is a specialisation of
a “Fitter” (code 4112-11) in the 1996 and 2001
census. Therefore, not a Motor mechanic.
�
A case may be coded as both a motor mechanic
(Y for #6) and a motor mechanic equivalent
(Y for #8a). The categories are not mutually
exclusive (e.g., a case may state he was a “motor
mechanic” and a “garage proprietor”).
9a.
