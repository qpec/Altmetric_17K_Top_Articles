Aims
Breast cancer survival has improved throughout the last decades, but treatment-induced cardiotoxicity remains a
major concern. This study aimed to investigate competing causes of death and prognostic factors within a large co-
hort of breast cancer patients and to describe the heart-specific mortality in relation to the general population.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
In this registry-based cohort study, women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011, who were
treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy and followed until 2014, were identified from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results-18 (SEER-18) database. Cumulative mortality functions were computed. To investi-
gate heart-specific mortality relative to the general population, long-term (>
_10 years) standardized mortality ratios
(SMRs) were calculated. Prognostic factors for heart-specific mortality were assessed by calculating cause-specific
hazard ratios (HRcs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the Cox proportional hazards regression.
Subgroup analysis on intermediate-term mortality according to molecular subtypes, for which information was
available since 2010, was performed. In total, 347 476 breast cancer patients were eligible to be included in the
study. Among all possible competing causes of death, breast cancer accounted for the highest cumulative mortality.
Compared with the general population, heart-specific mortality of breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy
or chemotherapy was lower [SMRoverall 0.84 (0.79–0.90)]. In subgroup analysis, human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)-positive subtype was not associated with increased heart-specific mortality relative to
HER2-negative patients [HRcs 0.96 (0.70–1.32)].
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Heart-specific mortality among breast cancer survivors is not increased compared with the general population.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive patients do not have increased heart-specific mortality com-
pared to HER2-negative patients.

Introduction
With 1.67 million cases in 2012, breast cancer is the second most
common cancer worldwide.1 Whereas improvement in treatment
options including radiation and human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2 (HER2)-targeted chemotherapy led to progress in terms of
breast cancer survival, long-term mortality due to persistent decline
in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and incidental cardiac

diseases have remained one of the major concerns in breast cancer
survivors.2 Recent studies found that especially among older breast
cancer patients and those with a concomitant cardiovascular comor-
bidity at time of breast cancer diagnosis, the cumulative mortality due
to a cardiovascular disease was higher than the cumulative mortality
due to the underlying breast cancer disease.3,4
However, most of these findings were analysed within breast can-
cer cohorts only, and not much is known about cardiovascular mor-
tality compared with the general population.5 As increasing age is a
natural driver for the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cardio-
vascular mortality among the general population, this comparison is
crucial in order to disclose associations potentially attributable to
breast cancer therapy such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Moreover, it is of utmost importance that these analyses are per-
formed with careful consideration of competing risks.3,6
In the light of possible treatment-related cardiotoxic effects, we
aimed to investigate long-term heart-specific mortality within a large
breast cancer population including 347 476 US female breast cancer pa-
tients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy both in the presence
of competing risks and in comparison with the general US female
population.
Methods
Data sources
For this registry-based retrospective cohort study, the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results-18 (SEER-18) database was used, which cov-
ers data from 18 regional cancer registries throughout the USA.7 Access to
the data was provided through a standard request to SEER, which was ac-
cepted after filling the required data usage agreement. In total, the SEER
cancer registries draw on a base population of approximately 28% of the
US population and capture comprehensive demographic and cancer-
specific information including the International Classification of Diseases-10
(ICD-10) codes for the underlying cause of death. The reference cohort
representing the general US population was selected from the underlying
cause of death (WONDER) online database of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).8 These county-level national mortality and
population data are based on death certificates for US residents.
Study population
Breast cancer cases were defined as women at age 15years or older with
a first primary malignant breast cancer diagnosis (ICD-10: C50.x) be-
tween 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011. This calendar year interval
was chosen to provide a sufficient minimum follow-up time for all
included patients. Follow-up time was defined as the time from diagnosis
to the date of last contact, death or end of the study period (31
December 2014), whichever occurred first.
Patients without or with unknown status of surgery (8.2%), missing in-
formation on cause of death (0.5%), stage 0 (0.1%), or unknown stage
(3.6%) were excluded in order to perform a complete case analysis. To
check if results hold when the above mentioned variables were imputed,
all main analyses were repeated and estimates from 30 multiple imputed
datasets were combined according to Rubin’s rule.9 Finally, the analysis
cohort was restricted to patients who received either radiotherapy or
chemotherapy or both.
Outcome and covariate assessment
The primary focus of this study was given to mortality due to diseases of
the heart as a potential long-term side-effect of cardiotoxic treatment
such as radiation and chemotherapy. Hence, heart-specific causes of
death were defined according to the SEER recode 50060 (ICD-10 codes
are presented in Supplementary material online, Table S1). Sensitivity ana-
lyses were also conducted including patients dying from primary hyper-
tension and hypertensive renal disease (ICD-10 codes I10 and I12,
respectively).
As potential predictors of mortality, age (categorized as age <35,
35–49, 50–54, 55–64, 65–74, and >
_75years), ethnicity (white, black,
American Indian/Alaska native, Asian/Pacific islander, and other), year of
diagnosis, stage [coded according to the breast cancer adjusted staging
of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition], grade
(I–IV), and tumour site were considered.
Statistical analysis
The distributions of all baseline characteristics were summarized by cal-
culating the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and fre-
quencies for categorical variables, respectively. The median follow-up
time was assessed using the reverse Kaplan–Meier method.10
Crude cumulative mortality functions were calculated and plotted for
cause-specific deaths overall and stratified by age to describe the prob-
ability of experiencing a specific endpoint in the presence of competing
risks among patients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. As
standard Kaplan–Meier analyses treat failures from competing events as
censored, this approach would lead to an overestimation of the absolute
risk of the event of interest because competing events would then violate
the assumption of non-informative censoring.6 Furthermore, the Kaplan–
Meier estimate would reflect mortality from the event of interest in a
hypothetical world without competing events, which is less clinically rele-
vant. Hence, to compute the probability to die from a specific cause of
death (cumulative mortality), breast cancer patients who died due to
competing causes of death were retained in the underlying risk set instead
of being censored.
To investigate if risk factors such as age might be only associated with a
potentially higher heart-specific mortality by the naturally increasing mor-
tality due to aging, overall and age-specific standardized mortality ratios
(SMRs) were calculated with the US female standard population from the
CDC database as reference.8 As potential long-term cardiotoxicity was
of major interest, conditional SMRs (cSMRs) were calculated for the cal-
endar period 2012–2014 restricting the breast cancer cohort to patients
who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2002 to ensure a conditional
survival of at least ten years. Conditional SMRs were calculated by divid-
ing the observed numbers of heart-specific deaths divided by the ex-
pected numbers. Latter were determined by multiplying the cumulative
person-time across breast cancer patients within 5-year age-groups (55–
59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and >
_85) and the calendar
period 2012–2014 with the age- and calendar period-specific mortality
rates from heart diseases in the general female population.
All age-specific and overall cSMRs were calculated for patients aged
55years or older who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The 5-
year age groups described above were chosen for age classification for
two reasons: Firstly, for the aggregated data for the US general female
population only categorizations in 1-year, 5-, and 10-year steps were
available, of which the 5-year categorizations were found best to operate
for the cSMR analyses. Secondly, official mortality statistics of the US
population are categorized in exactly the same 5-year steps, which we
adopted to make comparisons with cSMRs easier. Additionally, stratified
analyses were performed by Stage I–III and for all-cause mortality. Stage-
specific analyses for Stage IV patients were not conducted due to the
very low numbers of 10-year survivors in this group. 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) and P-values were estimated according to the method
by Vandenbroucke et al.11 and Altman et al.,12 respectively.

Additionally, adjusted cause-specific hazard ratios (HRcs) were com-
puted to estimate the relative association of individual risk and prognostic
factors on both heart- and breast cancer related mortality, using the Cox
proportional hazards regression. Potential confounding was addressed
by adjusting all models for the above listed variables. Stratified analyses
by molecular subtype were conducted as a separate analysis on
intermediate-term heart-specific mortality including all eligible breast can-
cer patients for whom this information was available since 2010.13
Table 1 was created using the R package ‘tableone’ (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).14 All other analyses were per-
formed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA) according to an a priori defined study protocol. Statistical signifi-
cance was defined by a two-sided P < 0.05.
Results
Out of 572 341 identified breast cancer cases between 2000 and
2011, 501 547 (87.6%) female breast cancer patients were eligible to
be included in the study, of whom 347 476 (69.3%) received either
radiotherapy or chemotherapy or both (Figure 1).
Compared with patients who did not receive radiotherapy or
chemotherapy, treated patients were on average younger at diagno-
sis (57.5years vs. 65.4), rather diagnosed in later stages (Stage III or IV
18.0% vs. 8.5%) and with higher gradings (Grade III or IV 39.3% vs.
29.1%) (Table 1). The majority of patients were white (81.5% and
83.0%, respectively) and the most common tumour site in both
groups was the upper-outer quadrant of the breast (36.4% and
31.4%, respectively). In general, patients treated with radiotherapy or
chemotherapy were more likely to die due to breast cancer (11.5%
vs. 9.5%), and less likely to die due to a heart-specific disease (2.1% vs.
6.4%). Among all patients for whom the information was available,
treated patients were more frequently diagnosed with a HER2-positive
(HER2þ) molecular subtype (16.4% vs. 9.6%), but less often diagnosed
with oestrogen receptor positive (ERþ) and progesterone receptor
positive (PRþ) molecular subtypes (77.4% vs. 84.7 and 66.3 vs. 72.7%,
respectively).
The median follow-up time for patients treated with radiotherapy or
chemotherapy comprised 8.4years [interquartile range (IQR) 5.5–11.6]
and was slightly higher for untreated patients [8.6 (IQR 5.6–11.2)].
Cumulative mortality
The cumulative mortalities for all causes of death among breast can-
cer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy are illus-
trated in Figure 2. By far the highest cumulative mortality of death was
caused by breast cancer, followed by other non-cancer causes of
death, which were not related to heart diseases. Heart-specific cumu-
lative mortality was marginally lower than cumulative mortality due
to cancers other than breast cancer. These patterns also did not sub-
stantially change when primary hypertension and hypertensive renal
disease were included among the heart-specific causes of death or
when using the imputed datasets (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S1 and S2, respectively).
Stratified by age groups, women aged 50years or younger had the
highest cumulative breast cancer mortality compared with heart-spe-
cific deaths (Take home figure). Nevertheless, it was observed that the
cumulative heart-specific mortality steadily increased with age at diag-
nosis and length of follow-up. In the oldest age group (>
_75years), the
cumulative mortality from heart-specific diseases exceeded the cumu-
lative mortality from breast cancer around 12years after diagnosis.
When using the multiple imputed datasets, however, the cumulative
mortality from heart-specific diseases was close, but did not exceed
the cumulative mortality from breast cancer within the first 15years
after diagnosis (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3).
Conditional standardized mortality
ratios
The comparison of heart-specific mortality between breast cancer
patients and the general population is displayed in Table 2.
When heart-specific mortality among breast cancer patients
treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy was compared to the
general female US population, it was observed that the cSMRs tended
to be slightly decreased for all age groups with an overall decrease by
16% (95% CI 21–10%) in the age standardized analysis. When this
analysis was repeated using the multiple imputed datasets, the cSMRs
varied
marginally
but
still
showed
the
same
patterns
(see
Supplementary material online, Table S2).
In terms of all-cause mortality, breast cancer patients treated with
radiotherapy or chemotherapy showed an over two-fold increased
mortality among younger breast cancer patients [cSMR 2.25 (1.99–
2.53)] in the age group 55–59years), which then steadily decreased
by increasing age. The overall cSMRs suggested a 12% [1.12 (1.09–
1.15)] increased mortality.
When stratified by stage, it was observed that both heart-specific
and overall cSMRs increased by stage.
Cause-specific hazard ratios
The associations between individual prognostic factors and heart-
specific mortality and breast cancer mortality among patients receiv-
ing radiotherapy or chemotherapy are presented in Table 3.
Heart-specific mortality most strongly increased with age, with
hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) as high as 1.89 (1.66–2.15), 5.98 (5.28–
6.76), and 22.78 (20.20–25.70) for patients aged 55–64, 65–74, and
>
_75 relative to patients aged 50–54, respectively. The association
with age was much stronger for heart-related mortality than for
breast cancer related mortality. Moreover, women who were diag-
nosed between 2006 and 2011 tended to have a 17% decreased
heart-specific mortality [HRcs 0.83 (0.78–0.88)] relative to those diag-
nosed between 2000 and 2005.
Heart-specific mortality also increased with stage, even though the
association was less pronounced than for breast cancer mortality
[HRcs 2.90 (2.43–3.46)] for Stage IV relative to Stage I). Compared
with white ethnicities, black breast cancer patients were at higher risk
for heart-specific death [HRcs 1.85 (1.72–1.99)], whereas patients
with an Asian/Pacific island ethnicity were at lower risk [HRcs 0.74
(0.65–0.84)]. None of the results did significantly change when the
multiple imputed datasets were used (see Supplementary material
online, Table S3).
When comparing intermediate-term heart-specific mortality ac-
cording to their HER2/neu status in subgroup analysis, it was
observed that being diagnosed with a HER2-positive receptor status
was not associated with heart-specific mortality [HRcs 0.96 (0.70–
1.32)] relative to HER2-negative receptor status (see Supplementary
material online, Table S4).

Discussion
In this large registry-based cohort study, it was found that within a co-
hort of female breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or
chemotherapy, heart-specific mortality was an important competing
risk, which was observed to steadily increase by age. However, when
comparing long-term heart-specific mortality to the general popula-
tion, mortality was not increased. Moreover, relative to patients with
a HER2-negative subtype, also HER2-positive patients did not show
increased mortality.
To our knowledge, this is the largest registry-based study, which
has been conducted so far on long-term heart-specific mortality
among breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemo-
therapy. In line with previously published literature, also within this
large US-based cohort an improvement of breast cancer-specific sur-
vival on the population level over time was observed, leaving
potentially treatment-induced heart-specific diseases as a major com-
peting risk for mortality among breast cancer survivors.15,16
Potentially relevant systemic treatments include anthracyclines, tax-
anes, alkylating agents, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, and several new tar-
geted therapeutic options, which are known to hold cardiotoxic
profiles.17 The underlying mechanisms have not been well under-
stood yet, but are hypothesized to be caused by impaired stress-
protective signalling mechanisms in cardiomyocytes and damages of
myocardial cells due to reactive oxygen species.18,19 Also radiother-
apy is known as a major risk factor for treatment-induced heart-spe-
cific diseases, particularly if applied to patients affected by left-sided
breast cancer.19 Especially the combination of radiation-induced mac-
rosvascular damages, accelerating age-related atherosclerosis, and
microvascular damages, reducing capillary density, is assumed to lead
dose-dependently to long-term myocardial ischaemias in breast can-
cer survivors.20 Nevertheless, modern imaging and radiation tech-
niques might be promising developments that are likely to reduce
radiation-induced heart-diseases in the future.19
To investigate potential excess heart-specific mortality, which
might be attributable to cardiotoxic treatment, it is crucial to also
take into account the steadily increasing cumulative heart-specific
mortality by age in the general population. In this study, the cSMRs
showed either a slightly lower or comparable heart-specific mortality
for breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy or chemother-
apy relative to the standard US female population. However, these
results have to be carefully interpreted as patients who received
radiotherapy or chemotherapy significantly differed from patients
who did not receive these treatments in terms of their baseline char-
acteristics such as younger age at diagnosis, higher stage, higher grad-
ing, and molecular subtype status. This is consistent with existing
literature, as it was found that breast cancer patients who receive
chemotherapy have in general less comorbid conditions, rather no
cardiovascular diseases and are younger at baseline.21 Hence, we re-
frained from performing additional analyses on patients who did not
receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy as Table 1 showed that these
were on average much older and most probably more frail, which
makes the interpretation of potential analyses much more challeng-
ing. Moreover, additional analyses on this patient subgroup would
have been beyond the scope of this study.
In subgroup analyses, it was found that especially Stage III breast
cancer patients might have a high cardiotoxic burden as they are
most likely to receive both radiotherapy and chemotherapy (55.2%)
(see Supplementary material online, Table S5). Hence, the interpret-
ation of the presented cSMRs is not straightforward but needs to
take into account that patients at higher stages, who receive poten-
tially cardiotoxic treatment, are also more likely to die earlier due to
their underlying breast cancer disease before they might develop a
heart-specific disease in the long term. Furthermore, clinicians might
already have established risk stratification strategies and pre-
treatment screenings in routine care, which might exclude patients at
highest cardiovascular risk from potentially cardiotoxic treatment. It
might also be likely that breast cancer patients with radiotherapy or
chemotherapy treatment might have still developed different adverse
heart-specific diseases but did not necessarily die from these diseases.
While dose-dependent anthracycline administration might cause irre-
versible cardiomyopathy, trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy ap-
pears to be reversible after the end of treatment.17

Considering that targeted therapies for HER2-positive patients
were also found to induce cardiotoxic effects, our results on
intermediate-term survival according to molecular subtypes are
encouraging as they show a decreased breast cancer-specific mortal-
ity while heart-specific mortality did not differ compared with HER2-
negative patients, which was also suggested by another recently
published study.22 However, not every HER2-positive diagnosed pa-
tient might also receive a HER2-targeted therapy and potential high-
risk patients could be less likely to receive HER2-targeted therapy in
the first place. Furthermore, follow-up time for this restricted sub-
group was shorter than for the general cohort.
The results of our study are quite consistent to results from other
studies. For example, in a recently published Canadian study, compar-
ing breast cancer patients and non-cancer population controls, car-
diovascular death was not significantly associated among breast
cancer patients who received anthracyclines only [HR (95% CI) 0.94
(0.41–2.20)], trastuzumab only [1.14 (0.85–1.52)], or a sequential
therapy [0.81 (0.25–2.66)].23
In another study, comparing deaths due to cardiovascular diseases
in a sample of 1413 breast cancer patients who were diagnosed in
1996–1997 and age-matched to women without breast cancer,5 it
was found that an increase in cardovascular deaths among breast can-
cer patients was only evident 7 years after diagnosis [HRcs 1.8 (1.3–
2.5)] and mainly present among women who received chemotherapy
[HRcs 1.7 (1.1–2.6)].
A comparable study to ours from the Netherlands, which investi-
gated in great detail the association of different treatment approaches
and cardiovascular causes of death, reported that especially 5-year
breast cancer survivors who were diagnosed in Stage I–III and had
left-sided radiotherapy after mastectomy or chemotherapy after
1997 were at increased risk to die from ischaemic heart diseases and
congestive heart failure when accounting for other competing causes
of death.24 When comparing this cohort to the general Dutch popu-
lation, the overall results for all cardiovascular causes of death [SMR
0.92 (0.88–0.97)] and cardiovascular disease subgroups tended to be
rather below the null with the exception of valvular dysfunction
[SMR 1.28 (1.08–1.52)]. These analyses are quite conclusive to our
findings from the SMR analysis.
This study has some strengths and limitations. Firstly, the SEER
database contains information about chemotherapy and radiation

therapy with a high specificity. However, as cancer treatments are in-
creasingly administered outside the hospital there might be the possi-
bility that the cancer registries might have missed cases of patients
having received treatment and hence coded them as ‘no/unknown’.
Nevertheless, it was found that the positive predictive value of the
treatment information captured in SEER is reasonably high (>85%),
reflecting sufficient specificity of treatment information for our ana-
lyses as especially just patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy
treatment were examined.25
Furthermore, details of the type, dosage and duration of adminis-
tered chemotherapy or radiotherapy were not available. Also adju-
vant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women would have been
of interest, since it was found that compared with tamoxifen, aroma-
tase inhibitors are associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarc-
tion.26 Nevertheless, it should be noted that despite a decreasing
trend of anthracycline use, studies that investigated the patterns of
chemotherapy use among breast cancer patients, found that 88.6%
(SEER/Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare-linked database) and 92.8%
(Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic medical records
database) of all patients who received chemotherapy received
anthracyclines and 88.8% of HER2-positive chemotherapy-treated
patients received trastuzumab, respectively.21,27 Hence, use of
chemotherapy, which was used as exposure variable in our analysis,
should approximate the relevant exposures reasonably well, which is
supported by the concordance to other smaller studies, that found
an increase in heart-specific events (e.g. hospitalization or major car-
diac events) but not in heart-specific mortality.23,24
Secondly, cSMRs are not adjusted for further confounders as in
multivariable regression analyses and also do not address the time-
to-event temporality as in Cox proportional hazards regressions.
Hence, risk factors other than sex, age and stage might still have still
confounded these results and future multivariable analyses compar-
ing breast cancer patients and non-breast cancer cohorts are highly
desirable. Moreover, mortality data on the general population is just
available on aggregated level in the WONDER database and hence
does not provide the option to exclude women with a diagnosis of
breast cancer. However, due to the good breast cancer prognosis
cSMRs might not substantially change. Thirdly, the SEER coverage
population was found to have a lower socio-economic status and a
greater diversity in the distribution of ethnic minorities and hence
might be not representative for the whole United States (US) popula-
tion.28 Lastly, due to the very long follow-up time, HRcs derived from
regression analysis should be interpreted as average effects over
time. In a sensitivity analysis to assess time-varying confounding, cal-
culating HRcs for each quartile of follow-up time, associations mostly
became stronger with longer follow-up time, but still showed the
same directions and patterns (data not shown).
Nevertheless, unique strengths of this study are the large sample
size, the stratified analyses by molecular receptor subtype and the
long follow-up time. Randomized clinical trails are often limited in
sample size and follow-up time, which leads to challenges in examin-
ing long-term side effects on mortality and hence surrogates such as
LVEF are used which might, due to the above mentioned reasons,
not necessarily reflect long-term heart-specific mortality outcomes
among breast cancer patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study identified some potential prognostic factors
for heart-specific and breast cancer-specific mortality, some of which
were quite consistent with previously published literature. More im-
portantly, however, it was observed that the heart-specific mortality
among breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemo-
therapy is not increased and rather comparable with the general fe-
male population. Further studies with more detailed data on
treatment are strongly desirable and needed to both validate the re-
sults presented in this study and further examine potential prognostic
factors. This might add knowledge for further development of
cardio-oncological risk stratification among breast cancer patients
and help clinicians to make informed decisions about which patient
strata are at highest risk and who would benefit most from prevent-
ive actions.
