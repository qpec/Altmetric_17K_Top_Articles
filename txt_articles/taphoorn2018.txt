IMPORTANCE Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) therapy improves both progression-free and
overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. There is a need to assess the influence of
TTFields on patients’health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of TTFields therapy with progression-free survival and
HRQoL among patients with glioblastoma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis of EF-14, a phase 3 randomized
clinical trial, compares TTFields and temozolomide or temozolomide alone in 695 patients
with glioblastoma after completion of radiochemotherapy. Patients with glioblastoma were
randomized 2:1 to combined treatment with TTFields and temozolomide or temozolomide
alone. The study was conducted from July 2009 until November 2014, and patients were
followed up through December 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Temozolomide, 150 to 200 mg/m2/d, was given for 5 days during each
28-day cycle. TTFields were delivered continuously via 4 transducer arrays placed on the
shaved scalp of patients and were connected to a portable medical device.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary study end point was progression-free survival;
HRQoL was a predefined secondary end point, measured with questionnaires at baseline
and every 3 months thereafter. Mean changes from baseline scores were evaluated, as well
as scores over time. Deterioration-free survival and time to deterioration were assessed for
each of 9 preselected scales and items.
RESULTS Of the 695 patients in the study, 639 (91.9%) completed the baseline HRQoL
questionnaire. Of these patients, 437 (68.4%) were men; mean (SD) age, 54.8 (11.5) years.
Health-related quality of life did not differ significantly between treatment arms except for
itchy skin. Deterioration-free survival was significantly longer with TTFields for global health
(4.8 vs 3.3 months; P < .01); physical (5.1 vs 3.7 months; P < .01) and emotional functioning
(5.3 vs 3.9 months; P < .01); pain (5.6 vs 3.6 months; P < .01); and leg weakness (5.6 vs 3.9
months; P < .01), likely related to improved progression-free survival. Time to deterioration,
reflecting the influence of treatment, did not differ significantly except for itchy skin
(TTFields worse; 8.2 vs 14.4 months; P < .001) and pain (TTFields improved; 13.4 vs 12.1
months; P < .01). Role, social, and physical functioning were not affected by TTFields.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The addition of TTFields to standard treatment with
temozolomide for patients with glioblastoma results in improved survival without a negative
influence on HRQoL except for more itchy skin, an expected consequence from the
transducer arrays.

lioblastoma has a poor prognosis,1,2 and, as tumors
grow, patients often experience a progressive decline
inneurologicfunctionandhealth-relatedqualityoflife
(HRQoL).3-7 The current standard of care is not curative but re-
sults in prolongation of life. However, extension of survival is
meaningful only if patients’ functioning and well-being can be
retained or improved.8-11 Therefore, it is important to deter-
mine the net clinical benefit of each new treatment or treat-
ment modality introduced; possible benefits of a new treat-
ment, in terms of prolonged survival, have to be carefully
weighed against potential negative effects of the treatment on
the patients’ quality of life.
The current standard of care for patients with newly
diagnosed glioblastoma comprises surgical resection
to the extent safely feasible followed by radiotherapy
with concomitant and maintenance chemotherapy with
temozolomide.12Tumor-treatingfields(TTFields)(Optune;No-
vocure Ltd) is an antimitotic physical treatment modality13,14
delivered by a home use medical device with wired trans-
ducerarraysplacedonthepatients’scalp.Whenaddedtostan-
dard maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy, TTFields has
been demonstrated to improve both progression-free sur-
vival and overall survival in a randomized clinical trial
(NCT00916409).15
Treatment with TTFields involves the patient carrying a
mobile electrical device for more than 18 hours per day and
having4arraysoftransducerscontinuouslyfixedtotheshaved
scalp. Concerns regarding the influence of wearing the de-
vice on patients’ HRQoL have therefore been raised.16,17 The
incidence of adverse events was not increased by the addi-
tion of TTFields to temozolomide therapy except for an ex-
pected mild to moderate skin irritation beneath the elec-
trodes in 52% of pateints (severe in 2%). Herein, we report on
the influence of treatment with TTFields on the patients’
HRQoL,whichwasapredefinedsecondaryobjectiveoftheran-
domized clinical trial. The present study was conducted from
July 2009 until November 2014, and patients were followed
up through December 2016.
Methods
Study Population
Patients eligible for this study were aged 18 years or older, had
newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed supratentorial
glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV astrocy-
toma), were progression free after undergoing maximal safe
debulking surgery or biopsy, and had completed standard ra-
diotherapy with concomitant temozolomide. Patients were re-
quired to have a Karnofsky Performance Status score of at least
70 at the time of enrollment, corresponding to at least being
able to perform self-care. Further details on the study popu-
lation are available elsewhere.15 All patients provided written
informed consent, and the study was approved by the insti-
tutional review boards or ethics committees of all participat-
ing centers and the relevant competent authorities (eAppen-
dix1inSupplement1);theparticipantsdidnotreceivefinancial
compensation.
Study Design and Treatment
This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized clini-
cal phase 3 trial recruited 695 patients at 90 medical centers
in North America, Europe, the Republic of Korea, and Israel.
The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2. The trial was
designed to test the efficacy of TTFields in combination with
the best standard of care in the treatment of newly diagnosed
glioblastoma (ie, radiotherapy with concomitant and adju-
vant temozolomide). The primary end point was progression-
free survival, with overall survival as a powered secondary end
point. Health-related quality of life was a secondary end point.
Patients who were progression free after completion of radio-
chemotherapy were randomized within 4 to 7 weeks at a ra-
tio of 2:1 to receive standard maintenance temozolomide che-
motherapy (150-200 mg/m2 for 5 days every 28 days for 6
cycles) with or without the addition of TTFields. If tolerated
well,TTFieldtherapywastobecontinueduntilthesecondpro-
gression or up to 2 years.
Patients in the TTFields plus temozolomide group re-
ceived continuous TTFields combined with maintenance
temozolomide.TTFieldsweredeliveredthroughaportablede-
vice in an outpatient setting. Patients receiving TTFields had
4 transducer arrays with 9 insulated electrodes each placed on
the shaved scalp and connected to a portable device set to gen-
erate 200-kHz electric fields within the brain. Although un-
interrupted treatment was recommended, the patient could
take short breaks if needed; patients were advised to con-
tinue treatment for at least 18 hours a day. More details on the
study design and treatment are published elsewhere.15
HRQoL Assessment
The evaluation of HRQoL was performed using the validated
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Can-
cer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and brain
module (QLQ-BN20).18-20 Questionnaires were completed on
paper at baseline (prior to randomization) and subsequently
every3monthsforupto12months.Ninescalesanditemswere
preselected as important based on relevance for patients with
glioblastoma and hypothesized effects of the TTFields deliv-
ery device on patients’ HRQoL: global health status; physical,
cognitive, role, social, and emotional functioning; itchy skin;
Key Points
Question What is the influence of adding tumor-treating fields to
the standard treatment on health-related quality of life in patients
with glioblastoma?
Findings In this secondary analysis of the EF-14 randomized
clinical trial, the addition of tumor-treating fields did not negatively
influence health-related quality of life except for itchy skin, an
expected consequence from the transducer arrays.
Meaning Tumor-treating field therapy has previously been shown
to prolong both progression-free and overall survival. When
considering the net clinical benefit, improved survival without
a negative influence on health-related quality of life supports the
addition of tumor-treating fields to standard treatment in patients
with glioblastoma.

 pain; and weakness of legs. We hypothesized that any burden
of carrying the device (on physical functioning and itchy skin)
or detriment to social and role functioning due to the visibil-
ity of the therapy may be balanced by patients’ feeling of well-
being (global health status and emotional functioning) re-
lated to active participation of both the patient and the
caregiver in the fight against cancer and increasing patient em-
powerment. Moreover, we hypothesized that treatment with
TTFields would not have an influence on cognitive function-
ing, pain, and weakness of legs.
Statistical Analysis
Calculation of HRQoL Scores
Theitemsonbothquestionnaireswerescaledandscoredusing
therecommendedEORTCprocedures.21Rawscoresweretrans-
formed to a linear scale ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher
score representing a higher level of functioning or higher level
of symptoms. The results of this study are presented in accor-
dance with guidelines for reporting HRQoL in cancer clinical
trials and methods.22-24 Differences of at least 10 points (on a
0-100 scale) were classified as the minimum clinically mean-
ingful change in any HRQoL scale/item.24
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics were used to report HRQoL scores as well
as the sociodemographic and clinical variables for the popu-
lationofpatientswhocompletedatleast1HRQoLscaleatbase-
line separately for both treatment groups. Means and SDs or
medians and ranges were calculated for continuous variables
depending on the distribution of the variable. Frequencies and
percentages were calculated for nominal variables. Differ-
ences between arms were tested using a 2-sided χ2 test or an
independent 2-tailed, unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney test at
an α value of .05 for each variable.
Adherence to HRQoL assessments was calculated as the
number of forms received divided by the number of forms ex-
pectedateveryassessment.Patientswhocompletedtheassess-
ments at the time of progression were included in this analysis.
HRQoL Scores Over Time
Mean HRQoL scores over time were calculated as well as the
mean changes from baseline. A stable HRQoL score was de-
fined as a change of less than 10 points, and a change of 10 or
morepointsindicatedadeteriorationorimprovementdepend-
ing on the scale or item. Mean change from baseline was plot-
ted to evaluate the longitudinal course of patients' experience
of disease and treatment, and a linear mixed-model repeated-
measuresanalysiswasusedtoestimatethetreatmenteffectover
time.Asensitivityanalysisofcompletecasesusingmultipleim-
putations with a predictive mean matching regression model
was used to check the robustness of the treatment effect over
time. An additional sensitivity analysis used a repeated-
measuresmodelthatassumesthereisrandomvariationamong
participants that is related to the time of dropout.
Stable or Improved HRQoL During the Progression-Free Period
The percentage of patients with stable (<10-point change) or
improved (≥10-point change) HRQoL during the progression-
free period, thus excluding the HRQoL assessment at progres-
sion, was determined separately for both treatment arms. This
calculation was based on the total number of patients with a
valid baseline HRQoL assessment and at least 1 additional fol-
low-up assessment. Moreover, the area under the curve of
stable or improved HRQoL for the entire duration of stability
or improvement was determined, and differences between
arms were assessed with the trapezoidal method (eAppendix
2 in Supplement 1).
Deterioration-Free Survival and Time to Deterioration
Deterioration-free survival was defined as the time to a greater
than 10-point deterioration in scores from baseline without a
subsequent 10-point or more improvement in scores com-
pared with baseline, progressive disease, or death in the ab-
sence of a previous definitive deterioration before the next as-
sessment. Disease progression was included as a surrogate
measure.DatawerecensoredatthelastHRQoLassessmentdate
for patients with a change of less than 10 points, patients who
did not progress, or patients who died after 9 weeks since the
last assessment. Data for patients with missing baseline scores
werenotincluded,andpatientsmissingallpostbaselineHRQoL
assessments were censored at randomization. Time to deterio-
ration (TTD) was defined similarly to deterioration-free sur-
vival, with the exception that progressive disease was ex-
cluded as an event (ie, nonmissing HRQoL data beyond
progression were included). Kaplan-Meier methodology was
used to estimate deterioration-free survival and TTD distribu-
tions and median times, and 95% CIs were computed using the
Greenwood formula. The difference between treatment arms

selected HRQoL scales analyses.
Results
Patients
A total of 695 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
TTFields plus temozolomide (n = 466) or temozolomide alone
(n = 229). A total of 639 (91.9%) patients completed at least 1
HRQoL scale at baseline: 437 (93.8%) of those in the TTFields
plus temozolomide arm and 202 (88.2%) patients in temozo-
lomide-alone arm (Figure 1). The baseline demographics of the
patients who provided HRQoL data were comparable to those
of the intention-to-treat population15 and were well balanced
between treatment arms in this subpopulation (Table 1).
HRQoL Completion Rates and Baseline Scores
Adherence to HRQoL assessments decreased from 91.9% at
baseline to 65.8% (431 of 655 patients alive) at 3 months and
dropped to 41.7% (197 of 473 patients alive) at 12 months of fol-
low-up (Figure 1). Mean and median baseline HRQoL scores
were comparable between arms for all preselected scales/
items (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), as well as the exploratory
scalesanditems.ReferencevaluesofHRQoLscoresofahealthy
general population25 were available for 7 of 9 predefined scales
and items (except itchy skin and weakness of legs). Patients
with glioblastoma after completion of radiochemotherapy
showed clinically relevant worse functioning or more symp-
toms compared with the general population on all scales ex-
cept pain, which was similar.25
Mean Changes in HRQoL From Baseline
and the Repeated-Measures Mixed-Effect Model
Mean changes in HRQoL over time for the global health status

sessmentperiod,meanchangesfrombaselinewerestable(<10-
point change from baseline) for all 9 predefined HRQoL scales

ception of itchy skin (Figure 2B). For itchy skin, a clinically rel-

zolomide-alone arm, P = .66, respectively). For all other scales,
there were no statistically significant or clinically relevant dif-
ferences between treatment arms.

treatment arms in HRQoL scores over time in any predefined
scale or item except for itchy skin (P < .001), which was worse
in the TTFields plus temozolomide arm (eTable 2 in
Supplement 1). The sensitivity analyses showed that the re-
sults of the linear mixed model were robust.

 Deterioration-Free Survival and TTD
The addition of TTFields to standard temozolomide chemo-
therapyresultedinstatisticallysignificantlongerdeterioration-
free survival in global health status, physical and emotional
functioning, pain, and weakness of legs (Figure 3A and eTable
2 in Supplement 1); the significant difference remained after
correction for multiple testing. When progression was re-
moved as a deterioration event (TTD), there was no negative
influenceofTTFieldsplustemozolomidetreatmentontheTTD
of HRQoL (Figure 3B) except for itchy skin, which was worse
in the TTFields plus temozolomide arm (8.2 vs 14.4 months).
In contrast, the addition of TTFields to temozolomide re-
sulted in a statistically significant prolongation until deterio-
ration for pain (13.4 vs 12.1 months, P < .01). There were no
other significant differences in TTD between arms (Figure 3B).
Discussion
InourdetailedanalysisofHRQoLduringtherapywithTTFields
in addition to temozolomide, no significant difference was
found between the groups in patients’ HRQoL over time ex-
cept for the skin reaction. As expected, itchy skin was re-
ported more frequently in patients treated with TTFields be-
cause of the transducer arrays that have to be placed on the
scalp of the patient. Consistently, over half of the patients also
reported skin irritation as an adverse event. We had hypoth-
esized that patients treated with TTFields may have better
HRQoL in some domains as a result of active participation in
the fight against cancer and the frequent interactions be-
tween patients and caregivers and device technicians regard-
ing the device. However, on a group level, global health sta-
tus and emotional functioning were not significantly different
between treatment arms. Likewise, our hypotheses that the
addition of TTFields would result in worse role and social func-
tioning (due to the visibility of the device) and worse physi-
cal functioning were not confirmed. In line with our hypoth-
eses, cognitive functioning, pain, and weakness of legs were
not negatively affected by the addition of TTFields to temo-
zolomide treatment. Most relevant for patients, HRQoL was
maintained (in 8 of 9 of the predefined scales/items) over time.
Combining the results of the survival and HRQoL analyses sug-
gests that the addition of TTFields to adjuvant temozolomide
is of value to patients with glioblastoma.
Patients who received TTFields had significantly longer
deterioration-free survival compared with those in the
temozolomide-alone arm for global health status (4.8 vs 3.3
months; P < .01), physical (5.1 vs 3.7 months; P < .01) and

 emotional functioning (5.3 vs 3.9 months; P < .01), pain (5.6
vs 3.6 months; P < .01), and weakness of legs (5.6 vs 3.9
months; P < .01). For the other scales and items, there was
no significant difference in deterioration-free survival
between the 2 treatment arms. The prolonged deterioration-
free survival for these scales is explained by the extended
progression-free survival for patients in the combined
TTFields plus temozolomide arm, as progressive disease is
included as an event in this analysis. Therefore, TTD analy-
ses, excluding progressive disease as an event, is important
to illustrate the influence of a treatment on HRQoL: TTD was
not significantly different across any HRQoL scale or item in
TTFields-treated patients except for pain and itchy skin,
indicating that treatment with TTFields had an influence
only on the level of pain and itchy skin. In patients treated
with TTFields, TTD was significantly longer for pain (13.4 vs
12.1 months; P < .01) and significantly shorter for itchy skin
(8.2 vs 14.4 months; P < .001). The difference between
deterioration-free survival and TTD indicates the impor-
tance of disease progression (rather than treatment) as a key
event driving HRQoL decline, as suggested by previous
studies.26,27 Moreover, in only 1% of patients, regardless of
treatment arm, was a clinically relevant improvement in
HRQoL seen after initial deterioration, supporting this obser-
vation. Taken together, the results of the deterioration-free
survival and TTD analyses support the results of the longitu-
dinal analysis by showing that the addition of TTFields to
the standard of care did not adversely affect HRQoL. In fact,
the delay in TTD for pain seen in TTFields-treated patients
may reflect a delay in the occurrence of tumor-related head-
aches (although not significant, patients in the TTFields plus
temozolomide arm had a longer TTD compared with
patients in the temozolomide-alone arm for headaches: haz-
ard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.54-1.10; P = .16). Future studies are
needed to better understand this finding, as the median TTD
values for pain were longer than the median progression-
free survival for both arms.

ing radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide.

Conclusions
Use of TTFields prolongs progression-free and overall sur-
vival in patients with glioblastoma. The addition of this novel
device-delivered treatment neither negatively affects nor im-
proves functioning and well-being of the patient, including
critical HRQOL issues, such as role, social, and physical func-
tioning.Patientsreportedmoreitchyskin,whichisadirectand

HRQoL data support the addition of TTFields to standard
therapy in patients with glioblastoma.
