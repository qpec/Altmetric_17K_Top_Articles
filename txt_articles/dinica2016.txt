Abstract: The combined toxicities of binary mixtures of veterinary pharmaceuticals active compounds 
(PhACs) were examined using the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri as a test organism 
(Microtox® test). Mixtures were prepared at an equitoxic ratio that corresponded to the IC10 of 
individual PhACs. In addition, we determined the toxicity of a multi-component mixture that contained 
all of the investigated PhACs mixed at the ratio corresponding to their individual values of Predicted 
No Effect Concentrations (PNEC). The experimental results were successively compared with those 
obtained by applying the two most widely used models for predicting mixture toxicity, i.e., the 
concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models. Although the toxicity of the tested 
multi-component mixture was well predicted by the CA and IA models, deviations from the model 
predictions were found for almost all of the binary mixtures. The deviations from the CA and IA 
models were greater at lower concentrations, particularly when diclofenac sodium and amoxicillin were 
present in the mixture. Based on these results, we tested the hypothesis of toxicological interactions 
occurring in binary mixtures (in the direction of synergistic or antagonistic effects) by applying the 
Combination Index (CI) method, which allowed for the computerised quantisation of synergism, the 
additive effect and antagonism. The application of this method confirmed, for at least half of the binary 
combinations, the clear presence of synergistic deviations at the lowest tested concentrations, with a 
tendency towards antagonism at the higher ones. In one case, a relevant antagonistic interaction was 
observed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

INTRODUCTION  
Organisms are typically exposed to a cocktail of chemicals rather than one individual substance. 
This is particularly true in surface water systems, where monitoring studies have generally detected a 
multitude of heterogeneous and potentially toxic substances [1-4]. Hence, the risk posed by the 
presence of mixtures in environmental compartments should be evaluated. During the last decade, the 
EU Commission became aware of the problem of chemical mixtures in the environment [5] and 
defined the challenges that require scientific support in its communication on the combination effects 
of chemicals [6]. However, presently, environmental risk assessment procedures are generally 
developed for single substances, which may lead to a severe underestimation of the real risk facing the 
environment [7-8].  
Understanding the ecotoxicology of mixtures is in the first stages, due to a wide complexity of 
variables that should be taken into consideration [9]. The experimental assessment of the ecotoxicity of 
every potentially occurring mixture is not feasible and is still limited due to the wide temporal and 
spatial variability of compounds in a given area. In addition, obtaining a full prediction of mixture 
effects by using models is not simple work. Two simple component-based predictive models for 
assessing the responses of mixtures are commonly used: Concentration (or Dose) Addition (CA, DA) 
[10] and Independent Action (IA) [11] models. The CA approach is thought to be applicable to 
mixtures of chemicals that share a similar or common mode of action. Conversely IA, which is also 
known as ‘‘response addition’’, is widely held as appropriate for mixtures of agents that show a 
dissimilar mode of action. These concepts are both based on knowledge of the concentration-response 
relationships of the single components. In many cases mixtures in which components had similar or 
dissimilar modes of action were correctly predicted with the concepts of CA and IA, respectively [12-
14]. The results from the IA model usually lead to slightly lower responses than those predicted by CA,

thus CA is often used as the acceptable worst case. However, in some cases, the “prediction window” 
[15-16] is very small, which indicates that both models are able to predict the response of mixtures 
independently based on the mode of action of single components [7,17-18].  
By definition, the CA and IA concepts ignore synergistic and antagonistic effects, and both 
models assume that the components of a mixture do not interact chemically or in 
toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic phases [9] For the quantification of both phenomena, Chou and Talalay 
introduced the Combination Index (CI) method [19]. This approach was historically applied in 
pharmacology to understand the nature of the interactions among pharmaceuticals’ active compounds 
(PhACs) [20], and it was more recently applied in the environmental field to study the interactions 
among chemical contaminants present in environmental mixtures [21-23]. In the first part of a broader 
study, the toxicity of ten different PhACs (both for veterinary and human use) towards Aliivibrio 
fischeri (formerly Vibrio fischeri or Photobacterium phosphoreum) was determined using the 
Microtox® test system [24]. In this companion paper, we focused on PhACs registered for veterinary 
use. In particular, we investigated the effects of a series of their binary or multicomponent mixtures on 
A. fischeri. In the previous study [24], we have demonstrated that almost all the selected PhACs act as 
polar-narcotic compounds towards A. fischeri. The only exception was the antibiotic chlortetracycline 
acting with a specific mode of action. Based on these findings, the mixture responses containing 
narcotic-type PhACs should be well predicted by the CA model. On the contrary, IA approach should 
be more suitable for the prediction of the mixture toxicities containing chlortetracycline. The binary 
mixtures were prepared at an equitoxic ratio that corresponded to the individual IC10 obtained in the 
previous work [24]. The multi-component mixture was prepared in a ratio corresponding to the 
individual value of Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC). The experimental results were 
compared with those obtained by the application of CA and IA models, to assess the additive behaviour 
of chemicals in mixture or the existence of deviations from conceptual expectations. Finally, the nature

of the PhACs interactions was also investigated by applying the CI method to verify the existence of 
possible synergistic and/or antagonistic effects. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Chemicals and testing procedures 
The tested veterinary PhACs compounds were the same as those reported by Di Nica and 
coworkers [24]: amoxicillin [AMX], chlortetracycline [CTC], sulfamethizole [SMT] diclofenac sodium 
[DCF] and acetylsalycilic acid [ASA]. CAS numbers, main physico-chemical properties and individual 
acute toxicity data (IC50 and IC10) on A. fischeri were reported by Di Nica and co-workers [24]. The 
stock solutions were prepared using the method described in Vighi and coworkers [25]. Acute toxicity 
(15 min) towards the bioluminescent bacterium A. fischeri (purchased from Ecotox LDS S.r.l.) was 
measured using the Microtox Model 500 analyser (ECOTOX lds, Milan-Italy). The testing procedure 
was described by Di Nica and coworkers [24]. For binary mixtures, the tested concentrations (from 9 to 
22 experimental concentrations) ranged from 0.02 to 35 toxic units (TUs), where the TUs of the 
mixture correspond to the sum of the ratio between the actual concentration of the chemicals present in 
the mixture and their relative IC10. Solutions were buffered with 0.1 M sodium phosphate and pH was 
adjusted in the range of 6–8.50 (DIN EN ISO 11358-3) using a pH-meter Model 250 (Denver 
Instrument). All tests are referred to nominal (= initial) concentrations of PhACs. Tests were performed 
in four replicates. Stock solutions of SMT, AMX and ASA were prepared by using dimethyl-sulfoxide 
(DMSO). For mixtures containing these PhACs the final test samples contained a concentration of 
DMSO always below 1.5 % (v/v). As reported in the companion paper [24] at this level of 
concentration, the influence of DMSO for low water-solubility compounds is negligible. 
Experimental design for selected mixtures 
Eleven mixtures were prepared by mixing individual chemicals at equitoxic concentrations in 
the saline solution (2% NaCl) that was used for the toxicity test. This concentration ratio was kept

constant, and using a serial dilution, different concentrations of stock solutions were tested (fixed ratio 
design).  
The tested mixtures were as follows: 
• 
10 combinations of binary mixtures of compounds mixed in a ratio corresponding to their 
individual IC10 (ASA-AMX; ASA-CTC; ASA-DCF; ASA-SMT; CTC-AMX; CTC-DCF; CTC-
SMT; DCF-AMX; DCF-SMT; SMT-AMX) The individual IC10 values of the selected PhACs 
are shown in table 1 of the SI. 
• 
1 multi-component mixture of the five compounds mixed in a ratio corresponding to their 
individual value of PNEC (mix-PNEC: CTC-DCF-ASA-SMT-AMX).  
 
In line with the current guidelines on environmental risk assessment pharmaceuticals [26-27], PNECs 
were extrapolated by applying an appropriate Assessment Factor (AF) to the lowest relevant observed 
value within the toxicity data set available in the literature. The calculated PNEC values are reported in 
the Supporting Information (SI) Table S2. 
Concentration-response curve fitting 
To quantitatively describe the concentration response curves (CRC), the observed 
concentration-effect data were fitted to the non-linear regression Weibull model (eq. 1): 
 
I = (c, β) = 1 - exp{- exp{ln(β2(ln(c)-ln(β1))}} 
 
 
[1] 
 
where I is the fractional response (0≤I≤1) in terms of the inhibition of luminescence, c is the chemicals 
concentration and β1 and β2 are the parameters of the model. The Ix (100*Ix%) together with the 
confidence intervals were obtained using the R® software package [28-29]. 
Prediction of mixture toxicities by CA and IA models

Based on the fixed ratio of the mixture components, it was possible to express the concentration 
of single chemicals as a fraction of the total concentration. Therefore, it was possible to apply the CA 
model using equation 2 [15]: 
 
          
  
    
 
   
 
  
 
 [2] 
 
where ECxmix is the total concentration of the mixture that produces a x% of the effect,  pi (Ci/Cmix) is 
the fraction of the component i in the mixture and ECx,i is the concentration of the ith component when 
present individually and elicits the same effect (x%) as the mixture. It was possible to derive the 
predicted concentration-response curve using equation 2. 
The alternative IA model is commonly used to predict the mixture toxicity of substances that have 
different or dissimilar mechanisms of action. It may be applied using equation 3:

where Ci denotes the concentrations of the ith mixture component, E(ci) is its corresponding effect and  
E(Cmix) is the overall effect caused by the mixture [11,15]. 
Application of the Combination Index (CI) - isobologram equation 
To highlight possible synergistic or antagonistic effects, a further analysis of the response of A. 
fischeri to PhACs mixtures was carried out using the CI approach [20, 30-31] (eq. 4):

where n(CI)x is the combination index for n chemicals at x% inhibition, (Dx)1–n is the sum of the dose of 
n chemicals that exerts x% inhibition in combination, {([D]j/∑[D]} is the proportionality of the dose of 
each of n drugs that exerts x% inhibition in combination and (Dm)j {(fax)j /[1 - (fax)j]}1/mj is the dose of 
each drug alone that exerts x% inhibition. Dm is the median-effect dose, fax is the fractional inhibition at 
x% inhibition and m is the slope of the median-effect plot.  
From equation 4, CI < 1, CI = 1 and CI > 1 indicate synergism, the additive effect and antagonism, 
respectively.  
The computer program CompuSyn was used to calculate the CI values for the different mixtures 
at different ranges of effect levels (10, 25, 50, 75 and 90% of inhibition of bioluminescence) [32]. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Experimental mixture toxicities 
Binary mixtures of PhACs. IC10 and IC50 were derived from the concentration-response curves 
of the tested binary PhAC combinations (Table 1). As shown in the table, the obtained IC50 spanned 
over two orders of magnitude.  
In particular, the binary mixture CTC-DCF showed the highest toxicity (IC10 = 0.68 mg L-1 and 
IC50 = 10.1 mg L-1), followed by the DCF-ASA combination (IC10 = 18.2 and IC50 = 111.6 mg L-1). In 
contrast, the binary combinations containing AMX showed the lowest IC50. 
These results were not surprising considering that, in the companion paper [24], CTC and DCF tested 
singly were the most toxic PhACs to A. fischeri (IC10: 2.0 mg L-1 and IC50: 12.1 mg L-1 for CTC; IC10: 
5.9 mg L-1 and IC50: 15.9 mg L-1 for DCF) while the AMX was the least toxic one (IC50: >1702 mg L-
1).

For the majority of the tested binary mixtures, a complete concentration-response relationship 
was obtained (Fig. 1). In 4 cases the maximum percentage of inhibition reached was near the 50% 
(ASA-AMX and SMT-AMX 43%, ASA-SMT and CTC-AMX 48%).  
Multi-component mixtures of PhACs. A complete concentration-response curve was obtained 
for the tested multi-component mixture of veterinary PhACs (mixed at their PNEC ratio). The resulting 
IC10 and IC50 values were 25.0 mg L-1 and 220.7 mg L-1, respectively. The obtained results showed that 
at concentrations corresponding to the sum of individual PNECs (0.16 mg L-1) a very negligible effect 
was measured on A. fischeri; in addition, the IC10 was two orders of magnitude greater than the sum of 
the single-compound safety threshold for aquatic organisms, and at least four order of magnitude above 
their joint measured environmental concentrations in European water bodies that are in the range of ng 
L-1[24]. 
These results are not surprising considering that PNECs have been calculated by applying an 
AF to acute or chronic toxicity data for the most sensitive species and that A. fischeri is not the most 
sensitive for all the tested compounds, as demonstrated in our previous study [24]. 
Predicted mixture toxicity by CA and IA models and comparison with experimental results 
The obtained experimental concentration-response curves were compared with the classical 
models of CA and IA. Some of the obtained results are depicted in Figure 2. In the Figure, for the 
experimental concentration-responses curves, the confidence intervals are also reported. A more 
complete picture of the obtained results can be found in Figure S1 and in Table S3 (IC50 and IC10 
predicted by CA and IA) of the SI. The observed concentration responses are not always sufficiently 
described by the CA and IA models. In fact, with the exception of three binary combinations (CTC-
SMT, DCF-SMT and ASA-DCF) and of the multicomponent mixture, the experimental toxicity data 
deviate from the conceptual expectations of the CA and IA. In one case (the binary mixture ASA-CTC) 
both models clearly overestimate the bioluminescence inhibition response at all the tested

concentrations. In all the other cases, the extent of the deviation is mainly dependent on the mixture 
components and the effect level considered. Particularly, for binary combinations showing greater 
observed toxicities than those predicted by models (e.g. CTC-DCF, DCF-AMX), deviations are 
considerably higher at lower concentrations. Recently, Marx and coworkers [33], by analyzing, from 
literature, the presence of synergistic and antagonistic effects in antibiotic mixtures highlighted a 
potential increase of synergistic effects with decreasing concentrations. Anyway, the authors concluded 
that due to the low number of investigations on the concentration dependency of mixture interactions 
and due to the dependency of this influence on the targeted organism and on the specific combination 
of chemicals, presently, no general statement can be made. 
On the contrary, for ASA-SMT (Fig. 2) and ASA-AMX (Fig. S1) combinations the magnitude 
of deviation increases with the increase of concentrations. However, in both cases, the deviations could 
be an artefact due to the lack of experimental data (as reported above, the maximum percentage of 
inhibition reached was near the 50%). Finally, both models seem to underestimate the effects of CTC-
AMX (Fig. 2) and SMT-AMX (Fig. S1) mixtures at lower tested concentrations.  
Toxicological interactions of the tested PhACs in mixtures 
The above reported results suggested possible interactions among the mixture components. The 
presence of synergism or antagonism in the mixtures of PhACs (particularly in binary mixtures) or 
other pollutants were reported in previous studies [e.g., 14, 21, 23, 34-37] and in a recent review of 
Backhaus [9]. Cleuvers [14] tested combinations of various PhACs on algae and Daphnia. The author 
demonstrated that the evaluated compounds behaved as non-polar narcotic compounds towards both 
organisms. In the algal test, the combination effect of a binary mixture of ibuprofen and diclofenac 
(two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) was well predicted by the CA model (as 
expected for substances with similar mode of action). However, in the Daphnia test, the effect of the 
mixture was stronger than that predicted by concentration addition. In a further study, Cleuvers [34]

evaluated a 4-component mixture of NSAIDs and confirmed that, in the algal test, the effect of 
increasing the number of NSAIDs components in the mixture was well predicted by the CA. In the 
Daphnia test, the results were quite different: at low doses (up to EC20/4), the mixture showed 
practically no effect (much lower than that predicted by the CA model), whereas at the higher 
concentrations, the effect was much higher than that predicted by the model. Rodea-Palomares and 
coworkers [21] found contrasting results when assessing the toxicological interactions of binary 
combinations of fibrates in V. fischeri and Anabaena. In fact, these authors reported that in the Vibrio 
test, the binary mixtures showed antagonism at low effect levels that turned into an additive effect or 
synergism at higher effect levels. However, in the Anabaena test, they found a strong synergism at the 
lowest effect levels that turned into a very strong antagonism at high effect levels. Gonzalez-Pleiter et 
al. [36] studied the toxicity of binary and multi-component mixtures of five antibiotics on the green 
alga P. subcapitata and the cyanobacterium Anabaena CPB4337. The study found a clear 
predominance of synergistic behaviour for most of the antibiotic interactions on these organisms. In 
particular, the amoxicillin-tetracycline combination tested on cyanobacterium was strongly synergistic. 
Conversely, these authors found a dual behavior with rapid changes of interactions (from strong 
synergism to strong antagonism) when the tetracycline in combination with erythromycin was tested 
towards Anabaena. Brezovsek et al. [37] tested the toxicity of three binary mixtures of anti-neoplastic 
drugs on the green alga P. subcapitata and the cyanobacterium S. leopolinensis and compared their 
results with predictive models (CA and IA). The binary combination of 5-fluorouracil and imatinib had 
a synergistic effect for P. subcapitata and an antagonistic effect on S. leopolinensis. Based on these 
results, the authors noted the importance of species-dependent interactions between the 
pharmaceuticals in a mixture.  
Backhaus [9] highlighted that, for pharmaceuticals, the synergisms and antagonisms were 
specific for the tested mixture and the toxicity test. In particular, synergistic mixtures seemed to be

largely confined to mixtures of only a few compounds, usually not more than two or three. On the 
contrary, synergistic or antagonistic mixture effects were rarely observed in toxicity tests for multi-
component mixtures. Backhaus [9] argued that this phenomenon might be explained by the presence of 
a sort of buffering against synergistic or antagonistic interactions when the contribution of the latter are 
no predominant.  
Warne & Hawker [38] in their work on the funnel hypothesis, explained the variation in the 
toxicity of multi-component mixtures of non-specific toxicants (narcotics) and concluded that mixtures 
of this type of toxicants tended to approach additivity (becoming less synergistic or antagonistic) as the 
number of components increased.  
In our study, in order to evaluate the presence and eventually quantify the nature of such 
interactions (e.g., synergism, antagonism) at any effect level, the CI method was applied. Figure 3 
shows a plot of the obtained CI values as a function of effect levels (fa) for all of the tested mixtures. 
The corresponding values of CI at the main representative fa levels (effect level of fraction inhibited 
with respect to the control) are reported in Table 3 of the SI. The fa-CI plots allowed us to observe, at 
any fa levels, the trend of the nature of interactions among PhACs in mixtures. In the Figure, CI values 
up to the effect level (fa) of 0.5 are reported, for those binary mixtures for which the entire 
concentration response curves were not obtained.  
From the analysis of Figure 3 and Table SI-4, the following considerations can be made: 
- 
For almost all the tested mixtures, fa-CI plots and CI values seems to confirm the 
presence of interactions among the components. The only exceptions are the CTC-SMT, 
DCF-SMT and ASA-DCF binary combinations, which are fairly additive (CI  1) at all 
the considered effect levels.  
- 
Synergism or antagonism seem to be independent of the mode of action towards the 
tested organism. As highlighted in the companion paper [24], we demonstrated that with

the exception of CTC, all of the selected PhACs act as polar narcotic compounds to A. 
fischeri. In agreement with the previously reported results of Cleuvers [14] on Daphnia, 
even if these substances share (broadly speaking) the same mechanism of action, we 
found that the effect of the binary mixtures deviates from CA predictions. In addition, 
binary combinations composed of substances with different mechanisms of action (i.e., 
those including CTC) show very different and unpredictable behaviours.  
- 
Clear synergistic effects are present for the CTC-DCF and DCF-AMX combinations up 
to the effect level (fa) of 0.65-0.70. The results obtained for CTC-DCF seems to be in 
line with previous studies. Olajuyigbe and Afolayan [39] tested combinations of 
tetracycline and amoxicillin towards eight different kind of antibiotic resistant bacteria 
(either gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria) and found that they had a synergistic 
effect in many cases. Interestingly the author, also, found that the synergistic effects 
were concentration dependents between the two antibiotics. On the contrary, ASA-CTC 
clearly interacted in an antagonistic way in the whole range of effect levels. 
- 
 For other binary combinations (CTC-AMX, SMT-AMX ASA-SMT, ASA-AMX) a 
somewhat heterogeneous pattern is observed, with interactions changing from synergism 
at low fa ( 0.1 - 0.3) towards a clear antagonism within a narrow range of concentrations. 
The presence of synergism at lower concentrations and the tendency towards additivity, 
or antagonism, at the higher ones is not simple to explain, as the nature of the 
interactions are complex and mostly unknown. Anyway, as above discussed, similar 
results are present in literature [21, 35-36]. For instance, Magdaleno and coworkers [40] 
tested the effects on the growth of P. subcapitata of combinations of several antibiotics; 
these authors found that at low concentrations (< 10 mg L-1) all binary combinations 
 Accepted Preprint

showed synergism. While, in almost all the cases, at the higher tested concentrations the 
response became close to the predictions.  
- 
In some cases, the nature of interactions seems related to the presence of some 
compounds. For instance, at the lower tested concentrations, the presence of the anti-
inflammatory DCF seems to enhance the effects of the antibiotics AMX, CTC (and to a 
lesser extent of SMT). Several studies highlighted that the efficiency of some antibiotics 
(streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and ampicillin) towards bacteria can be 
synergistically enhanced by the presence of DCF [41-45]. These authors, found that 
DCF has the capability to damage bacterial membrane [46], and to favour the alteration 
of the permeability of the microorganism to antibiotics [45, 47-48]. In contrast, in our 
study, the presence of the anti-inflammatory ASA seems to weaken their toxicity.  
- 
Finally, the multi-component mixture showed no strong synergism or antagonism. In 
fact, the CI values ranged from 0.61 (IC10) to 1.37 (IC90) until the tested effect level. Our 
results, obtained in the toxicity test for the multi-component mixtures, seem to support 
the buffering hypothesis proposed by Backaus [9]. 
 
Anyway, as reported by Kortenkamp et al. [49] synergistic cases are very specific for specific 
compounds, their concentrations and mixture ratios. In this study the concentrations of the tested 
mixtures giving synergistic responses are above the environmental relevant concentrations and in 
addition for the experimental purpose, substances were combined in equal ratios accordingly to their 
individual IC10 value, that could be extremely different respect to the real ratio at which toxicants might 
be found in environment. Thus, also, their response from naturally occurring combinations could be 
different.

CONCLUSIONS 
The toxicity of binary and multi-component mixtures of widely used veterinary pharmaceuticals 
was evaluated using the Microtox® test system. For the tested multi-component mixture, the obtained 
results indicated that at concentrations corresponding to the sum of individual PNECs, no effects were 
present towards A. fischeri. This finding suggested that the PNECs values were sufficiently protective 
when the investigated PhACs were contemporaneously present in aquatic environments, at least for 
microorganisms and for short-term exposure. By comparing the experimental toxicity curves with those 
predicted by the CA and IA models, it was possible to hypothesise the presence, in binary mixtures, of 
toxicological interactions between the components, which, in several cases, leads to synergistic effects 
at low concentrations (particularly when diclofenac sodium or amoxicillin were one of the 
components). The subsequent application of the CI method confirmed the presence of synergistic and 
antagonistic interactions. Finally, synergism or antagonism seemed to be independent of the mode of 
action of the tested toxicants. This seems to confirm that for combinations of pharmaceutical active 
compounds the use of the predictive models can to have some limitations in the assessment of the real 
mixture toxicity.
