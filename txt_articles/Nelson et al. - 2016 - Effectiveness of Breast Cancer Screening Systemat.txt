Meta-analysis to Update the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force Recommendation
Heidi D. Nelson, MD, MPH; Rochelle Fu, PhD; Amy Cantor, MD, MPH; Miranda Pappas, MA; Monica Daeges, BA;
and Linda Humphrey, MD, MPH
Background: In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
recommended biennial mammography screening for women
aged 50 to 74 years and selective screening for those aged 40 to
49 years.
Purpose: To review studies of the effectiveness of breast cancer
screening in average-risk women.
Data Sources: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases to 4 June
2015.
Study Selection: English-language randomized, controlled tri-
als and observational studies of screening with mammography,
magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography that re-
ported breast cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, or advanced
breast cancer outcomes.
Data Extraction: Investigators extracted and confirmed data
and dual rated study quality; discrepancies were resolved
through consensus.
Data Synthesis: Fair-quality evidence from a meta-analysis of
mammography trials indicated relative risks (RRs) for breast can-
cer mortality of 0.92 for women aged 39 to 49 years (95% CI,
0.75 to 1.02) (9 trials; 3 deaths prevented per 10 000 women
over 10 years); 0.86 for those aged 50 to 59 years (CI, 0.68 to
0.97) (7 trials; 8 deaths prevented per 10 000 women over 10
years); 0.67 for those aged 60 to 69 years (CI, 0.54 to 0.83) (5
trials; 21 deaths prevented per 10 000 women over 10 years);
and 0.80 for those aged 70 to 74 years (CI, 0.51 to 1.28) (3 trials;
13 deaths prevented per 10 000 women over 10 years). Risk re-
duction was 25% to 31% for women aged 50 to 69 years in
observational studies of mammography screening. All-cause
mortality was not reduced with screening. Advanced breast can-
cer was reduced for women aged 50 years or older (RR, 0.62 [CI,
0.46 to 0.83]) (3 trials) but not those aged 39 to 49 years (RR, 0.98
[CI, 0.74 to 1.37]) (4 trials); less evidence supported this
outcome.
Limitations: Most trials used imaging technologies and treat-
ments that are now outdated, and definitions of advanced breast
cancer were heterogeneous. Studies of effectiveness based on
risk factors, intervals, or other modalities were unavailable or
methodologically limited.
Conclusion: Breast cancer mortality is generally reduced with
mammography screening, although estimates are not statisti-
cally significant at all ages and the magnitudes of effect are
small. Advanced cancer is reduced with screening for women
aged 50 years or older.

I
n 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF)
recommended
biennial
mammography
screening for women aged 50 to 74 years (1) on the basis
of evidence of benefits and harms (2). The USPSTF con-
cluded that screening decisions for women aged 40 to
49 years should be based on individual considerations,
and that evidence was insufficient to assess benefits
and harms for women aged 75 years or older (1).
Mammography screening in the United States is
generally opportunistic, unlike many screening pro-
grams organized as public health services in other
countries. Despite changes in practice guidelines and
variation in clinical practices (3), overall screening rates
in the United States have remained relatively stable for
the past decade (4, 5). Data from the Healthcare Effec-
tiveness Data and Information Set indicate that mam-
mography screening in 2014 in HMOs was performed
for 74% of eligible women covered by commercial
plans, 72% by Medicare, and 59% by Medicaid (6).
This systematic review updates evidence for the
USPSTF on the effectiveness of mammography screen-
ing in reducing breast cancer mortality, all-cause mor-
tality, and advanced breast cancer for women at aver-
age risk; and how effectiveness varies by age, risk
factors, screening intervals, and imaging modalities.
Systematic reviews of harms of screening (7), perfor-
mance characteristics of screening methods (8), and ac-
curacy of breast density determination and use of sup-
plemental screening technologies (9) are provided in
separate reports.
METHODS
Scope, Key Questions, and Analytic Framework
The USPSTF determined the scope and key ques-
tions for this review by using established methods (10,
11). A standard protocol was developed and publicly
posted on the USPSTF Web site. A technical report fur-

 ther describes the methods and includes search strate-
gies and additional information (7).
Investigators created an analytic framework outlin-
ing the key questions, patient populations, interven-
tions, and outcomes reviewed (Appendix Figure 1,
available at www.annals.org). Key questions include the
effectiveness of screening in reducing breast cancer
mortality, all-cause mortality, and advanced breast can-
cer, and how effectiveness differs by age, risk factors,
screening intervals, and modalities (mammography
[film, digital, tomosynthesis], magnetic resonance im-
aging [MRI], and ultrasonography).
The target population for the USPSTF recommen-
dation includes women aged 40 years or older, and
excludes women with known physical signs or symp-
toms of breast abnormalities and those at high-risk for
breast cancer whose surveillance and management are
beyond the scope of the USPSTF'
s recommendations
for prevention services (i.e., preexisting breast cancer
or high-risk breast lesions, hereditary genetic syn-
dromes associated with breast cancer, or previous
large doses of chest radiation before age 30 years).
Risk factors considered in this review are common
among women who are not at high risk for breast can-
cer (12) (Appendix Figure 1, available at www.annals
.org).
Data Sources and Searches
A research librarian conducted electronic database
searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Re-
views, and Ovid MEDLINE to 4 June 2015. Searches
were supplemented by references identified from ad-
ditional sources, including reference lists and experts.
Additional unpublished data were provided by the in-
vestigators of the Canadian National Breast Screening
Study (CNBSS) and Swedish Two-County Trial.
Study Selection
Two investigators independently evaluated each
study to determine inclusion eligibility on the basis of
prespecified
criteria.
Discrepancies
were
resolved
through consensus.
We included randomized, controlled trials (RCTs);
observational studies of screening cohorts; and system-
atic reviews that compared outcomes of women ex-
posed to screening versus not screening. For advanced
cancer outcomes, studies that reported the incidence
of late-stage disease among screened and unscreened
populations were included, whereas those reporting
comparisons of detection methods that did not capture
a woman'
s longitudinal screening experience were not
included (e.g., rates of screen-detected vs. non–screen-
detected cancer).
Studies providing outcomes specific to age, risk
factors, screening intervals, and modalities were pre-
ferred over studies providing general outcomes, when
available. Studies most clinically relevant to practice in
the United States were selected over studies that were
less relevant. Relevance was determined by practice
setting, population, date of publication, and use of
technologies and therapies in current practice. Studies
meeting criteria for high quality and those with designs
ranked higher in the study design–based hierarchy of
evidence were emphasized because they are less sus-
ceptible to bias (e.g., RCTs over observational studies).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Details of the study design, patient population, set-
ting, screening method, interventions, analysis, follow-
up, and results were abstracted by one investigator and
confirmed by a second. Two investigators indepen-
dently applied criteria developed by the USPSTF (10,
11) to rate the quality of each study as good, fair, or
poor for studies designed as RCTs, cohort studies,
case–control studies, and systematic reviews; criteria to
rate other study designs included in this review are not
available.
Discrepancies
were
resolved
through
consensus.
Data Synthesis
We conducted several meta-analyses to determine
more precise summary estimates when adequate data
were reported by trials rated as fair- or good-quality. In
each meta-analysis, the number of included trials was
counted as the number of discrete data sources con-
tributing to the summary estimate using their most re-
cent results. To determine the appropriateness of
meta-analysis, we considered clinical and methodolog-
ical diversity and assessed statistical heterogeneity. All
outcomes were binary (breast cancer mortality, all-
cause mortality, and advanced cancer incidence de-
fined by stage and tumor size). We used a random-
effects model to combine relative risks (RRs) as the
effect measure of the meta-analyses, while incorporat-
ing variation among studies. A profile-likelihood model
was used to combine studies in the primary analyses
(13). We assessed the presence of statistical heteroge-
neity among the studies by using the standard Cochran
chi-square test, and the magnitude of heterogeneity by
using the I2 statistic (14).
To account for clinical heterogeneity and obtain
clinically meaningful estimates, we stratified the analy-
ses by age group whenever possible (39 to 49 years, 50
to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, and ≥50
years). We obtained additional age-stratified data for
the meta-analysis from the investigators of 3 trials (15,
16) (Taba
´r L. Personal communication).
For breast cancer mortality, we used 2 methods of
including cases to help clarify discrepancies between
estimates. The long case accrual method counts all
breast cancer cases contributing to breast cancer
deaths. In this method, the case accrual time is equiva-
lent to or close to the follow-up time. The short case
accrual method includes only deaths that occur among
cases of breast cancer diagnosed during the screening
intervention period, and in some trials, within an addi-
tional
defined
case
accrual
period.
The
longest
follow-up times available for each trial were selected
for inclusion in the initial meta-analyses, and sensitivity
analyses were conducted by using results of short case
accrual methods.
We calculated the absolute rate reduction for
100 000 woman-years of follow-up (i.e., 10 000 women

 followed for 10 years) for each age group on the basis
of the combined RR and the combined cancer rate of
the control group. We estimated combined cancer
rates for each age group for controls with a random
effects Poisson model using data from the trials. All
analyses were performed by using Stata/IC, version
13.1 (StataCorp).
We assessed the aggregate internal validity (qual-
ity) of the body of evidence for each key question as
good, fair, or poor by using methods developed by the
USPSTF that are based on the number, quality, and size
of studies; consistency of results between studies; and
directness of evidence (10, 11).
Role of the Funding Source
This research was funded by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality (AHRQ) under a contract to
support the work of the USPSTF. The investigators
worked with USPSTF members and AHRQ staff to de-
velop and refine the scope, analytic framework, and key
questions; resolve issues during the project; and final-
ize the report. The AHRQ had no role in study selection,
quality assessment, synthesis, or development of con-
clusions. The AHRQ provided project oversight; re-
viewed the draft report; and distributed the draft for
peer review, including to representatives of profes-
sional societies and federal agencies. The AHRQ per-
formed a final review of the manuscript to ensure that
the analysis met methodological standards. The inves-
tigators are solely responsible for the content and the
decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
RESULTS
Of the 12 070 abstracts identified by electronic
searches and other sources, 38 studies met inclusion
criteria for key questions in this report, including 5 sys-
tematic reviews of 62 studies (Appendix Figure 2, avail-
able at www.annals.org).
RCTs of Screening
Eight main trials of mammography screening met
criteria for fair quality: the Health Insurance Plan of
Greater New York (HIP) trial (17); the CNBSS (Canadian
National Breast Cancer Screening)-1 (18, 19) and
CNBSS-2 (20, 21); the Age trial, performed in the
United Kingdom (22); and 4 trials from Sweden, which
were the Stockholm trial (23), Malmo
¨ Mammographic
Screening Trial (referred to separately as “MMST I” and
“MMST II”) (24), Gothenburg trial (25), and Swedish
Two-County Trial (referred to separately as “O
¨ stergo
¨ t-
land” and “Kopparberg”) (26). Updates of the CNBSSs,
the Age trial, and Swedish Two-County Trial provided
new data for this report (15, 16, 27). The Edinburgh trial
(28) was not included because of important baseline
differences between screening and control groups,
suggesting inadequate randomization.
Trials included over 600 000 women and varied in
their recruitment, randomization, screening protocols,
control groups, and sizes (Appendix Table 1, available
at www.annals.org). Breast cancer mortality was the
main outcome measure, and all trials evaluated differ-
ences between screening and control groups on an
intention-to-screen basis. Other important characteris-
tics are described in the technical report (7).
Breast Cancer Mortality Outcomes
Screening Trials
The Swedish Two-County Trial (Kopparberg and
O
¨ stergo
¨ tland [26]), Age trial (27), Gothenburg trial (25),
and CNBSS-1 and CNBSS-2 (15) used long case accrual
methods to report breast cancer mortality by age. The
HIP trial (29), MMST I, MMST II, and Stockholm trials
used only short case accrual (30) to report breast can-
cer mortality by age. Across all trials, the mean or me-
dian screening intervention time ranged from 3.5 to
14.6 years, case accrual time from 7.0 to 17.4 years,
and follow-up time from 11.2 to 21.9 years.
For women aged 39 to 49 years, the combined RR
for breast cancer mortality was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.75 to
1.02) (9 trials [15, 25–27, 29, 30]) (Figure 1). The com-
bined RR for women aged 50 to 59 years was 0.86 (CI,
0.68 to 0.97) (7 trials [15, 25, 26, 29, 30]); for those
aged 60 to 69 years, it was 0.67 (CI, 0.54 to 0.83) (5
trials [26, 29, 30]). Combining results for women aged
50 to 69 years indicated an RR of 0.78 (CI, 0.68 to 0.90).
Only 3 Swedish trials (O
¨ stergo
¨ tland, Kopparberg, and
MMST I) provided outcomes for women aged 70 to 74
years, and the numbers of events in these trials were
much lower than for other age groups (26). A meta-
analysis indicated a combined RR of 0.80 (CI, 0.51 to
1.28) (3 trials [26]).
Results of the meta-analysis were used to deter-
mine absolute rates of breast cancer mortality reduc-
tion per 10 000 women screened for 10 years (Table 1).
The number of deaths reduced (i.e., prevented) was 2.9
(CI, –0.6 to 8.9) for women aged 39 to 49 years; 7.7 (CI,
1.6 to 17.2) for those aged 50 to 59 years; 21.3 (CI, 10.7
to 31.7) for those aged 60 to 69 years; and 12.5 (CI,
–17.2 to 32.1) for those aged 70 to 74 years. Absolute
reduction for the combined group of women aged 50
to 69 years was 12.5 (CI, 5.9 to 19.5).
The effect of screening was diminished, although
the statistical significance of the estimates did not
change, in our sensitivity analysis that included results
of a published combined analysis of the Swedish trials
(MMST I, MMST II, Stockholm, O
¨ stergo
¨ tland, Gothen-
burg, and Stockholm) using a long case accrual
(“follow-up”) method (30) rather than results of individ-
ual trials. In a separate sensitivity analysis, meta-analysis
estimates from trials with short case accrual methods
differed only slightly from those with long case accrual
(Table 1). Across all trials with short case accrual, the
mean or median screening intervention time ranged
from 3.5 to 14.6 years, case accrual time from 5.0 to
15.5 years, and follow-up time from 10.7 to 25.7 years.
Observational Studies
Three good-quality systematic reviews of observa-
tional studies of screening were recently conducted by
the EUROSCREEN Working Group to assess the effec-
tiveness of mammography screening on breast cancer
mortality (31–33). An additional review included many

 groups, indicated a risk reduction of 0.75 (CI, 0.69 to
0.81) (7 studies [42, 47–52]) for women invited to
screening and 0.62 (CI, 0.56 to 0.69) (7 studies [42,
47–52]) for those actually screened. A meta-analysis of
case–control studies (33) indicated an odds ratio of
0.69 (CI, 0.57 to 0.83) (7 studies [53–58]) for women
invited to screening; and 0.52 (CI, 0.42 to 0.65) (7 stud-
ies [53–58]) for those actually screened.
Six additional studies were not included in the pub-
lished systematic reviews because they were published
in 2011 or later (59–63), included women in countries
outside Europe and the United Kingdom (63, 64), or
focused on ages older or younger than 50 to 69 years
(59, 64) (Appendix Table 2, available at www.annals
.org). These studies are generally consistent with the
EUROSCREEN results (61–63), including 2 observa-
tional studies of women in their 40s indicating a 26% to
44% reduction in breast cancer mortality for women
invited to (59) or participating in screening (59, 63).
All-Cause Mortality
All included trials of mammography screening re-
ported all-cause mortality outcomes. However, not all
trials reported them according to age, and the 2 Cana-
dian trials reported combined estimates. For all ages,
the combined RR of 0.99 (CI, 0.97 to 1.002) (9 trials [15,
27, 30, 65]) was consistent with no reduction in all-
cause mortality with screening. Results were similar for
each age group (RR, 0.99 [CI, 0.94 to 1.05] for women
aged 39 to 49 years [7 trials], 1.02 [CI, 0.94 to 1.10] for
those aged 50 to 59 years [3 trials], 0.97 [CI, 0.90 to
1.04] for those aged 60 to 69 years [2 trials], and 0.98
[CI, 0.86 to 1.14] for those aged 70 to 74 years [2 trials])
and when short case accrual methods were used.
Mortality Outcomes by Risk Factors, Screening
Intervals, and Modalities
No trials reported mortality outcomes for women
with specific risk factors besides age, and none com-
pared different screening intervals or modalities. Two
observational studies indicated no differences in breast
cancer mortality after changing from annual to biennial
screening (66) or between annual and triennial screen-
ing (67) (Appendix Table 2).
Advanced Breast Cancer Outcomes
Screening Trials
Trials measured cancer severity in terms of clinical
stage (0 to IV) (23, 24, 68, 69), number of involved
lymph nodes (0, 1 to 3, or ≥4) (18, 20, 25, 26, 70), and
tumor size (mm) (19, 21, 26), and these varied across
trials. Although “advanced” breast cancer is classified
as metastatic disease (stage IV) by the American Joint
Committee on Cancer TNM system based on tumor
size, lymph node involvement, and presence of metas-
tasis (71), most trials defined advanced breast cancer at
much lower thresholds (72).
To combine results, the meta-analysis included the
most severe disease categories available from the tri-
als, recognizing that these definitions do not represent
equivalent disease stages (Appendix Table 3, available
at www.annals.org). These include stage III and IV dis-
ease (i.e., regional and metastatic, respectively), size 40
to 50 mm or greater, or 4 or more positive lymph
nodes. Combining results on the basis of these defini-
tions indicated no difference with screening for women
aged 39 to 49 years (RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.74 to 1.37]) (4 trials
[19, 26, 68, 70]) but reduced risk for those aged 50
years or older (RR, 0.62 [CI, 0.46 to 0.83]) (3 trials [21,
26, 68]) (Figure 2).
Observational Studies
Five case-series studies compared breast cancer
diagnoses in populations of women who had previous
screening versus none (73–77). However most studies
used thresholds indicating early stages of disease (74,
77) or reported proportions rather than incidence rates
(73–77), providing inadequate data to determine the
effectiveness of screening (Appendix Table 4, available
at www.annals.org).

 Treatment-Related Morbidity Outcomes
Screening Trials
A Cochrane review compared treatments between
randomized groups in 5 screening trials: the CNBSS-1
and CNBSS-2, the MMST, and the Kopparberg and
Stockholm trials (78). In this analysis, women randomly
assigned to screening were more likely to have surgical
therapy, analyzed as mastectomies and lumpectomies
combined (RR, 1.35 [CI, 1.26 to 1.44]) (5 trials) or mas-
tectomies alone (RR, 1.20 [CI, 1.11 to 1.30]) (5 trials)
(78). These women were also more likely to have radi-
ation therapy (RR, 1.32 [CI, 1.16 to 1.50]) (2 trials), and
less likely to have hormone therapy (RR, 0.73 [CI, 0.55
to 0.96]) (2 trials). Use of chemotherapy was similar be-
tween groups (RR, 0.96 [CI, 0.78 to 1.19]) (2 trials) (78).
Observational Studies
Four case-series studies compared breast cancer
treatments in populations of women who had previous
screening versus none (73–76) (Appendix Table 5,
available at www.annals.org). Although studies indi-
cated less extensive surgery, such as fewer total mas-
tectomies and more breast conservation therapies
(73–76), and less chemotherapy (73, 74, 76) among
screened women, the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in
situ was included in some studies (74, 76), resulting in
less intensive therapies overall in screened women.
Advanced Breast Cancer and Treatment-Related
Morbidity Outcomes by Risk Factors, Screening
Intervals, and Modalities
Five observational studies based on populations in
the U.S. Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium com-
pared breast cancer diagnoses by screening intervals
(79–83) (Appendix Table 4). Some analyses indicated
no differences between annual and biennial screening
in detecting advanced stage disease (79, 80, 83),
whereas 2 analyses indicated earlier stages of disease
among women aged 40 to 49 years who were screened
annually versus biennially (81, 82); this latter finding
was confined to women with extreme breast density in
one study (82). A randomized trial of annual versus tri-
ennial screening indicated detection of more tumors
larger than 20 mm in size with triennial screening; how-
ever, this threshold indicates early rather than ad-
vanced disease (84). Two observational studies of
women receiving mammography versus mammogra-
phy and tomosynthesis indicated no differences in can-
cer size (85) or node status (85, 86) (Appendix Table 6,
available at www.annals.org).
DISCUSSION
A summary of evidence is provided in Table 2. The
effectiveness of mammography screening in reducing
breast cancer mortality was evaluated by RCTs and ob-
servational studies providing fair-quality evidence. Our
meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials indicates that
breast cancer mortality is generally reduced with
screening; however, estimates are not statistically sig-
nificant for women aged 39 to 49 years and those aged
70 to 74 years, the magnitudes of effect are small, and
results differ depending on how cases were accrued in
trials. These results differ from our previous estimate (2)
because they include updated data from the CNBSS-1
and CNBSS-2, the Swedish Two-County Trial, and the
Figure 2. Effects of screening on advanced cancer outcomes.

 Age trial and incorporate data by using the longest
case accrual methods available from each trial.
Observational studies of population-based mam-
mography screening, limited by inherent biases of non-
randomized studies, reported a wide range of reduc-
tions in breast cancer mortality. Most studies were
conducted in Europe or the United Kingdom and in-
cluded women aged 50 to 69 years. Meta-analyses in-
dicated a 25% reduction based on 7 incidence-based
mortality studies and a 31% reduction based on 7 case–
control studies. These results generally concur with our
meta-analysis of trials for women aged 50 to 69 years
that indicated a statistically significant 22% reduction.
Evidence of breast cancer mortality reduction in
observational studies is inconsistent with randomized
trials of women in their 40s. Two observational studies
indicated 25% to 44% reductions with screening that
differ from the non–statistically significant reduction
from our meta-analysis of trials. This difference may re-
flect dissimilarities between participants and nonpartic-
ipants
of
screening
programs
in
nonrandomized
studies, as well as assumptions underlying mortality
estimates.
All-cause mortality did not differ between random-
ized groups in meta-analyses of fair-quality trials, re-
gardless of whether trials were analyzed in combined
or separate age groups.
Questions about the effectiveness of screening in
reducing breast cancer–specific or all-cause mortality
on the basis of risk factors, screening intervals, and mo-
dalities remain largely unanswered by currently avail-
able research. No studies evaluated breast cancer–
specific or all-cause mortality outcomes on the basis of
risk factors besides age. Although there were no trials
of the effectiveness of different screening intervals, 2
observational studies indicated no differences in breast
cancer mortality after changing from annual to biennial
screening or between annual and triennial screening.

 The effectiveness of breast cancer screening in re-
ducing advanced breast cancer outcomes is supported
by less evidence than for mortality. Studies provided
heterogeneous measures of breast cancer severity and
generally reported early-stage disease. A meta-analysis
of trials indicated a statistically significant reduction in
advanced disease for women aged 50 years or older
who were randomly assigned to undergo screening,
but not for women aged 39 to 49 years. This reduction
in advanced cancer aligns with reductions in mortality
outcomes for women older than 50 years reported in
randomized trials and observational studies, but differs
from studies of population trends that show no reduc-
tions in advanced breast cancer after the introduction
of mass screening (87–89).
In a meta-analysis of 5 trials, women randomly as-
signed to undergo screening were more likely to have
surgical and radiation therapy and less likely to have
hormone therapy than controls; use of chemotherapy
was similar between groups. This finding would be ex-
pected, because screening increases detection of duc-
tal carcinoma in situ and early-stage disease that are
currently aggressively treated. Observational studies of
the impact of screening on diagnosis and treatment of
advanced cancer were inadequately designed to deter-
mine effectiveness because they generally provided
comparisons
between
screen-detected
and
non–
screen-detected cases and between proportions of dif-
ferent
cancer
diagnoses
for
screened
versus
un-
screened women. Comparisons of incidence rates
between screening versus nonscreening populations
would provide more appropriate measures.
The effectiveness of screening in reducing ad-
vanced breast cancer and treatment morbidity on the
basis of risk factors, screening intervals, and modalities
was also unanswered by current research. The analysis
of outcomes based on screening intervals in the U.S.
Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium is limited by the
opportunistic nature of screening in the United States.
Women choosing short screening intervals probably
differ in important ways from those choosing longer
intervals. Consequently, comparisons between out-

 comes of these 2 types of women may not provide valid
measures of effectiveness. Only 2 observational studies
compared imaging modalities and found no differ-
ences in cancer size or node status between women
receiving mammography alone versus mammography
and tomosynthesis.
Our review has limitations. First, we included only
English-language articles; this could result in language
bias,
although
we
did
not
identify
non–English-
language studies that otherwise met inclusion criteria in
our searches. Second, we only included studies that
were applicable to current practice in the United States
in order to improve clinical relevance for the USPSTF,
excluding studies and limiting relevance to other pop-
ulations and settings. Third, studies used heteroge-
neous definitions for advanced breast cancer that did
not consider tumor subtypes, and most trials used im-
aging technologies and treatments that are now out-
dated, limiting their applicability. Finally, studies were
not available for some key questions, specifically for
effectiveness based on risk factors, intervals, or other
modalities; and the number, quality, and applicability
of studies varied widely.
Additional research on the effectiveness of mam-
mography screening with quality-of-life outcomes, as
well as morbidity and mortality outcomes, and using
current imaging technology and breast cancer treat-
ments would provide further understanding of the im-
plications of routine screening. Data for specific groups
of women, particularly older women, or groups based
on racial and ethnic background, access to screening,
or existence of comorbidities, for example, could fur-
ther inform screening practices. New technologies,
such as tomosynthesis, are becoming more widely
used in the United States without definitive studies of
their effects on screening outcomes. Studies on the
role of additional imaging modalities in screening are
required in order to appropriately incorporate these
technologies in the screening process.
In conclusion, breast cancer mortality is generally
reduced with mammography screening, although esti-
mates are not statistically significant at all ages and the
magnitudes of effect are small. Advanced cancer is re-
duced with screening for women aged 50 years or
older.

Appendix Figure 1. Analytic framework and key questions.
Screening
Key questions:
For women aged ≥40 years older*:
1. What is the effectiveness of routine mammography screening in reducing breast cancer–specific and all-cause mortality, and how does it differ by age,
risk factor†, and screening interval?
2. What is the effectiveness of routine mammography screening in reducing the incidence of advanced breast cancer and treatment-related morbidity‡,
and how does it differ by age, risk factor†, and screening interval?
3. How does the effectiveness of routine breast cancer screening in reducing breast cancer–specific and all-cause mortality vary by different screening
modality§?
4. How does the effectiveness of routine breast cancer screening in reducing the incidence of advanced breast cancer and treatment-related morbidity‡ 
vary by different screening modality§?

* Excludes women with preexisting breast cancer; clinically significant BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, Li–Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome,
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, or other familial breast cancer syndromes; high-risk lesions (ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ,
atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia); or previous large doses of chest radiation (≥20 Gy) before age 30 y.
† Risk factors include family history; breast density; race/ethnicity; menopausal status; current use of menopausal hormone therapy or oral contra-
ceptives; prior benign breast biopsy; and, for women aged >50 y, body mass index.
‡ Morbidity includes physical adverse effects of treatment, quality-of-life measures, and other measures of impairment.
§ Screening modalities include mammography (film, digital, tomosynthesis), magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and clinical breast
examination (alone or in combination).
