Irisin is a polypeptide hormone derived from the proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin-type III domain-
containing 5 (FNDC5) protein. Once released to circulation upon exercise or cold exposure, irisin stimulates
browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, leading to an increase
in total body energy expenditure by augmented UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. It is currently unknown
whether irisin is secreted by bone upon exercise or whether it regulates bone metabolism in vivo. In this
study, we found that 2 weeks of voluntary wheel-running exercise induced high levels of FNDC5 messenger
RNA as well as FNDC5/irisin protein expression in murine bone tissues. Increased immunoreactivity due to
exercise-induced FNDC5/irisin expression was detected in different regions of exercised femoral bones,
including growth plate, trabecular bone, cortical bone, articular cartilage, and bone–tendon interface. Exercise
also increased expression of osteogenic markers in bone and that of UCP1 in WAT, and led to bodyweight
loss. Irisin intraperitoneal (IP) administration resulted in increased trabecular and cortical bone thickness and
osteoblasts numbers, and concurrently induced UCP1 expression in subcutaneous WAT. Lentiviral FNDC5 IP
administration increased cortical bone thickness. In vitro studies in bone cells revealed irisin increases
osteoblastogenesis and mineralization, and inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)-
induced osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our findings show that voluntary exercise increases irisin
production in bone, and that an increase in circulating irisin levels enhances osteogenesis in mice.

INTRODUCTION
Adipose tissue is a major endocrine organ that regulates
energy balance and energy homeostasis.1 Two main types
of adipose tissue have been identified, white adipose tissue
(WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT).2 WAT functions
primarily to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides,
whereas BAT is involved in non-shivering thermogenesis,
energy dissipation as heat and determination of insulin
sensitivity.3–4 The oxidation of lipids in BAT is regulated
by direct sympathetic nervous system stimulation via
norepinephrine and is accomplished by expression of the
mitochondrial
protein
uncoupling
protein
1
(UCP1),
which facilitates a proton leak across the mitochondrial
membrane to release energy as heat and increase
energy expenditure. WAT from certain depots contain
“brite” adipocytes that upon stimulation can undergo a
process referred to as “browning” where they take on
characteristics of BAT, including the induction of UCP1 and
the ability to dissipate energy through a thermogenic
response.

 Several reports support the notion that therapeutic
strategies aimed at activating BAT activity or inducing
WAT browning may counteract metabolic diseases such as
obesity or type II diabetes (T2D), and could potentially
ameliorate bone-loss-associated disorders. First, human BAT
activity
correlates
inversely
with
energy
metabolic
impairment seen with aging, T2D, and obesity,5 and
directly with high bone mineral density in healthy young
women6
or
with
total
cortical
bone
cross-sectional
area in young children and adolescents.7 Second, WAT
browning induction or activating BAT activity have been
shown to suppress metabolic symptoms associated with
obesity and T2D,3,8 whereas genetic ablation of BAT in
rodents resulted in diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and
hyperlipidemia.4 In agreement with potentially beneficial
effects of BAT or BAT-like activity for bone health, WAT
browning was shown to be potentially anabolic for the
skeleton
through
in
vitro
studies
in
osteoblasts
and
osteocytes9 and reduced BAT function in Misty mice was
characterized by impaired bone formation and increased
bone resorption.10
Irisin is a peptide hormone of 112 amino acids that was
initially described as a myokine derived from fibronectin-
type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) proteolytic clea-
vage, which induces WAT browning, UCP1-mediated
thermogenesis, and energy expenditure.11–12 Endurance
exercise or muscle-specific overexpression of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α, a
transcriptional coactivator of adaptive thermogenesis and
mitochondrial
biogenesis,13
were
shown
to
stimulate
FNDC5 expression in skeletal muscle and increase circulat-
ing levels of irisin.11 FNDC5/irisin was later described to be
produced by WAT after exercise.14 In addition to exercise,
circulatory levels of irisin can be upregulated in response to
cold exposure in healthy human subjects.15 Detection of
irisin
has
also
been
described
in
cardiac
muscle,16
brain,16–17 and cerebrospinal fluid.18 Different laboratories
attempting to investigate the activation of PGC1α/FNDC5/
irisin signaling by exercise in skeletal muscle or WAT have
obtained results that are difficult to reconcile. These
conflicting results have been attributed to differences in
the animal protocol, or their choice of anti-FNDC5/irisin
antibodies.11,14,19–22 A limited number of studies have
evaluated whether bone tissues can also express FNDC5/
irisin and contribute to increasing irisin levels in circulation
upon exercise or cold exposure.
Irisin levels in circulation have been shown to be lower
than
normal
in
patients
with
T2D,23–24
which
exhibit
increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures,25 as well
as in subjects with previous osteoporotic fractures.26–27
Similar correlation was previously described for patients
with T2D with adiponectin,28 an adipokine produced by
WAT and skeletal muscle.2,29–31 Adiponectin exerts anti-
diabetic effects partly by increasing muscle oxidative
capacity and muscle insulin sensitivity and mediates
anabolic effects in bone.32–33 In agreement with an
anabolic effect for exercise-secreted irisin in the muscu-
loskeletal system, conditioned media from primary cultures
of myoblasts and myotubes established from exercised
muscles, increased osteogenic differentiation of bone
marrow stromal cells in vitro.34 Recombinant irisin at a
cumulative weekly dose of 100 μg·kg − 1 for 4 weeks has
been shown to increase cortical bone mass and strength in
mice.35
In
this
study,
we
demonstrate
that
2
weeks
of
wheel-running exercise induced PGC1α, FNDC5, and irisin
expression in bone. We also found intraperitoneal (IP)
administration of recombinant irisin increased trabecular
and cortical bone thickness and osteoblast numbers,
without significantly affecting osteoclast numbers, and
induced
expression
of
UCP1
in
subcutaneous
WAT.
Furthermore, recombinant irisin induced osteoblastogen-
esis and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in bone cell lines.
Taken together, our findings demonstrate bone tissues
express
FNDC5
and
irisin,
and
a
threefold
increase
of irisin levels in circulation for 2 weeks can recapitulate
part of the anabolic effects of exercise in the murine
skeletal system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant irisin, lentiviral FNDC5, EGFP constructs, and
FNDC5 shRNA lentivirus
Recombinant full-length irisin protein (112 amino acids,
sequence 32–143 of FNDC5) was purchased from Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Burlingame, CA, USA). Lentiviral
FNDC5, control EGFP constructs, FNDC5-set short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) lentivector for specific knockdown of FNDC5
expression, and the scramble control non-specific plasmids
were
obtained commercially from
Applied
Biological
Materials Inc. (Richmond, BC, Canada). Equal numbers
of lentiviral FNDC5, control EGFP constructs, FNDC5 shRNA
lentivector or the scrambled control plus VSV-G, pRSV-REV,
and
pMDLg/pRRE
packaging
plasmids
were
co-
transfected in HEK293T cells in 10 cm culture dishes. Viral
particles were collected from the supernatants at 24, 36,
48, and 60 h after transfection. Thereafter, the virus was
concentrated using PEG8000 for 4 days and adjusted with
saline to a concentration of 109 transducing units per ml.
FNDC5-set shRNAs targeted the following sequences with
over 70% knockdown of gene expression:
187: 5′-GCCATCTCTCAGCAGAAGAAGGATGTGCG-3′;
274: 5′-CTGGAGGAGGACACAGAATATATCGTCCA;
397: 5′-AAAGATGAGGTGACCATGAAGGAGATGGG;
511: 5′-CGCCAGTATGATATCATCAAGGACAACGA-3′.

 Mice, voluntary wheel running, and other in vivo
treatments
Mice were maintained and used in accordance with
recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute on Laboratory
Animal Resources, National Research Council (Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services Publication NIH 86–23,
1985) and by guidelines established by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Tufts University (Boston,
MA, USA). Mice were maintained under standardized
conditions with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and were
provided food (standard laboratory diet) and water ad
libitum.
Five-week-old
male
wild-type
C57BL/6J
mice
(Jax
#000664, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and
5-week-old male APN-KO (Jax # 008195, Jackson Labora-
tory) weighing 17–20 g were randomly housed individually
in empty cages (67 inch2; n = 18) or in cages with a
polycarbonate running wheel (10.16 cm diameter; Colum-
bus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) mounted to the side
of the cage for voluntary running (n = 18). The running
distance and average running speed were saved to a
data file every 30 s by an automated computer monitoring
system (Columbus Instruments). Mice run an average of
5 000 m per day for 2 weeks. Body weight was recorded at
0 and 2 weeks for each mouse. After 2 weeks of voluntary
running exercise or normal cage activity, mice were killed.
Irisin protein (3.24 ng per mouse; n = 6 mice) or saline
(n = 6 mice) was injected IP daily for 2 weeks, and mice
were killed on the day after the last injection. Lentiviral
FNDC5 or control EGFP viral particles (4× 108 transducing
units per mouse) were delivered by IP injection and mice
(n = 5 per group) were killed 4 weeks later. FNDC5 shRNA
lentivirus or scramble shRNA lentivirus (4 × 108 transducing
units per mouse) were delivered by IP and mice (n = 5 per
group) were euthanized after 2 weeks of voluntary running
exercise.
Tissue sampling and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
for irisin
Several tissues were collected for messenger RNA (mRNA)
and protein expression analyses including femur, tibia, red
muscle (soleus), white muscle (gastrocnemius), and sub-
cutaneous
and
epididymal
WAT.
Bone
marrow
was
removed from bone tissues being used for western blot
and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. All tissue
samples were then stored at − 80 °C till further use.
Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture,
kept at room temperature for 30 min, and centrifuged at
3 000 g for 15 min. Serum samples were then stored at
− 80 °C. Serum irisin levels were detected with a commer-
cially
available
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA) kit (#EK-067-16, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) that
recognizes full-length irisin (1–112), following the manufac-
turer’s recommendations.
Micro-computed tomography, histology, and
immunohistochemical staining protocols
Trabecular bone architecture was assessed using a micro-
computed tomography (μCT) system (Scanco μCT40,
SCANCO
Medical
AG,
Brüttisellen,
Switzerland)
as
previously described.33 Bone samples were also processed
for histology as previously described.36 Immunohistochem-
ical staining of bone samples was performed as previously
described.37 Primary antibody to detect irisin (epitope
42–112,
1:500)
and
FNDC5
expression
by
immuno
histochemical
staining
was
purchased
from
Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (#067-17). Digital images of stained
tissues were taken with an Olympus BX53 microscope
and analyzed by Spot Advanced software (Diagnostic
Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI, USA). Bone cells were
quantified as previously described.38
Cell culture experiments
MC3T3-E1
osteoblast
precursor
cells
(American
Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in
α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MC3T3-
E1 were serum-starved overnight and then treated with
50 μg·mL − 1 of ascorbic acid in the presence and absence
of irisin for 7, 10, and 14 days. To induce mineralization,
MC3T3-E1 cultures were treated with β-glycerophosphate
in the presence and absence of irisin. Formation of bone
nodules, used as indicative of mineralization in vitro, was
monitored by alizarin red staining as previously described,39
followed by melting bone nodules with 10% (v/v) cetylpyr-
idinium chloride and determination of absorbance at
562 nm as described.40
RAW264.7 osteoclast precursor cells (American Type
Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin, at 37° in 5% CO2. RAW264.7 cells were serum-
starved overnight and then cultured in the presence and
absence irisin and/or 50 ng·mL − 1 RANKL (PeproTech, Rocky
Hill, NJ, USA) for 1, 3, or 6 days. After 6 days, cells were fixed
and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity
using the K-ASSAY TRACP staining kit (Kamiya Biomedical
Company, Tukwila, WA, USA) as previously described.41
Osteoclast-like cells were identified as red-stained cells with
three or more nuclei and counted in four separate fields at
a magnification of × 200. Data were reported as the mean
number of osteoclast counted from three independent
experiments.

 C2C12 myoblast cells (American Type Culture Collec-
tion) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s med-
ium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transduc-
tions experiments, C2C12 cells were cultured in six-well
plates and treated with 108 transducing units per well of
lentiviral FNDC5 or EGFP viral particles in transduction
medium (Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium in 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) with 5 μg·mL− 1 poly-
brene (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Three days later, cells
were collected for FNDC5 mRNA expression analyses.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). One microgram of total RNA was used
for reverse transcription using the Two-Step RT-PCR Kit
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol using SYBR Green Supermix (Affy-
metrix) on a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories, Hercules, CA, USA). Differences in expression were
evaluated by the comparative cycle threshold method
using GAPDH as a control. The primer sequences are
included in Table 1. RNA samples derived from animal
studies resulted from five mice or more. qRT-PCR results were
obtained from at least three experiments for each gene.
Western blot analyses
Whole protein lysates from all tissues were prepared as
previously described.41 Whole protein lysates from cell lines
were prepared by using RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, Texas, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Nuclear proteins were purified
using a nuclear extraction kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western
blot analyses were performed as previously described.33
Antibodies for nuclear factor of activated T cells c1
(1:1 000) and lamin B1 (1:1 000) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Antibody to detect irisin (epitope 42–112,
1:500) and FNDC5 expression was purchased from Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (#067-17). Antibodies for β-catenin
(1:10 000)
were from Sigma
and those from
P-AKT-1
(1:1 000), calcineurin (1:1 000), P-JNK (1:1 000), and β-actin
(1:1 000) were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA). The
secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-linked
goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were
visualized using Pierce ECL chemiluminescence kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).
Statistics analysis
All data are shown as mean ± s.d. from at least three
different experiments and differences between groups
analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. All statistical
analyses were done using SPSS statistic 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) and values of Po0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
FNDC5/irisin and PGC1α expression are increased in
murine bone upon voluntary wheel-running exercise
We first evaluated whether bone tissue could be a source
of FNDC5 and irisin upon exercise. To that end, a group of
5-week-old mice was subjected to 2 weeks of voluntary
wheel running (exercise group) and compared with a
control
group
under
routine
cage
activity.
qRT-PCR
analyses revealed that FNDC5 and PGC1α mRNA levels
were increased in bone tissue from the exercise group
(Figure 1a). In addition, western blot analysis demonstrated
protein expression of FNDC5 and irisin increased over sixfold
in bone tissue (Figure 1b) and in less extent in articular
cartilage (Figure 1c) after exercise, although protein bands
for FNDC5 and irisin were also detectable in control
samples (Figure 1b and c).
Exercise also increased expression of markers of osteo-
blast differentiation in bone including osterix, bone sialo-
protein, and osteocalcin (Figure 1d).

 Immunohistochemical analysis of femoral bones with an
antibody that recognizes FNDC5/irisin revealed increased
immunostaining in the exercise group compared with the
control group in different regions, including the growth
plate, trabecular bone, cortical bone, articular cartilage,
and muscle–bone interface (Figure 1e).
Figure 1.
Voluntary exercise for 2 weeks increased FNDC5, PGC1α, and irisin expression in bone. Five-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6J mice
weighing 17–20 g were randomly housed individually in empty cages (control group, n = 18 mice) or in cages with a polycarbonate running wheel
for voluntary running (exercise group, n = 18 mice) for up to 2 weeks. Bone marrow was removed from bone tissues before qRT-PCR and western
blot analysis. (a) qRT-PCR analysis of FNDC5 and PGC1-α mRNA expression in exercised and control bone tissue (*Po0.05, vs control). (b, c)

 Taken together, our results demonstrated that FNDC5
and irisin are produced by bone at detectable levels
by western blot analysis, and their expression is signi-
ficantly increased by 2 weeks of voluntary wheel-running
exercise.
Evaluation of irisin levels in serum by ELISA
The impact of exercise on serum levels of irisin was later
investigated by ELISA with an antibody recognizing the 112
amino acids of irisin in several experiments. ELISA results
revealed significantly decreased serum irisin levels in mice
subjected to 14 days of exercise, but levels remained
unchanged as compared with the control group in mice
exercised for 7 days (Figure 2a). When the 14-day exercise
program was performed in mice injected with FNDC5
shRNA, irisin levels in serum were reversed to those in resting
control mice, whereas plasma levels of the scrambled
shRNA-treated group remained as low as for the group of
mice subjected to 14 days of exercise in the absence of
shRNA (Figure 2a).
Because other soluble factors, such as adiponectin, are
also increased upon exercise and could be working along
irisin to mediate biological effects in bone and other tissues,
we determined serum levels of irisin in APN knockout mice
(APN-KO) under routine cage activity and after 14 days of
Figure 2.
Voluntary exercise for 2 weeks increased serum irisin levels in mice lacking adiponectin expression, whereas decreased them in wild-type
mice. Five-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6J mice weighing 17–20 g were randomly housed individually in empty cages (control group, n = 18
mice) or in cages with a polycarbonate running wheel for voluntary running for 1 week (exe7d group, n = 5 mice) and 2 weeks (exe14d group, n = 18
mice). Five-week-old wild-type mice were injected IP with FNDC5 shRNA (exe-FNDC5 shRNA group, n = 5 mice) or scrambled shRNA (exe-
scrambled shRNA, n = 5 mice) and then exercised for 2 weeks. (a) Serum levels of irisin were evaluated by ELISA in wild-type mice subjected to
exercise for 7 and 14 days or subjected to FNDC5 shRNA or scramble shRNA treatments and 2 weeks of exercise. (*Po0.05, vs control; #Po0.05 vs
control; §Po0.05 vs exe14d group). (b) Five-week-old male knockout mice (APN-KO) and wild-type mice (WT) were subjected to 2 weeks of
voluntary wheel running (n = 5 mice for each resting group and n = 5 mice for each of the exercised groups). Serum irisin levels were evaluated and
compared by ELISA between wild-type and and APN-KO groups. (*Po0.05, vs control; §Po0.05 vs APN-KO-resting).
Figure 3.
Voluntary exercise decreased FNDC5 mRNA expression in muscle, increased UCP1 mRNA in subcutaneous WAT (WAT-sub), and
decreased bodyweight in mice after 2 weeks. (a) qRT-PCR analysis of FNDC5 expression in red muscle collected at 3, 5, 7, and 14 days from exercise
and control groups. (*Po0.05 vs control; ▲Po0.05 vs 3 days). (b) qRT-PCR analysis of UCP1 and FNDC5 expression in WAT-sub at day 14 from

 exercise. Our ELISA results revealed increased irisin levels
in serum by exercise in mice lacking adiponectin, but not
in wild-type mice of the same genetic background
(Figure 2b).
Exercise induces UCP1 expression in subcutaneous WAT
and weight loss
As opposed to the robust FNDC5/irisin upregulation in bone
after exercise, FNDC5 mRNA expression was decreased in
red muscle in the exercise group as compared with control
mice (Figure 3a). Furthermore, FNDC5 mRNA expression did
not change significantly in white muscle (data not shown).
In addition, PGC1α mRNA expression was not affected by
exercise in either red or white muscle (data not shown).
UCP1 gene, a browning marker, was increased in sub-
cutaneous WAT of the exercise group as compared with
control mice, whereas FNDC5 expression did not change
significantly after exercise (Figure 3b).

evaluate β-catenin protein expression in nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cultures. Lamin B1 was used as a loading control. All values are expressed as

 In agreement with an increased energy expenditure,
body weight was significantly reduced in the exercise
group as compared with the control group (Figure 3c).
Taken
together,
our
results
suggested
that
exercise-
induced irisin production in bone correlated with increased
expression of UCP1 in WAT and decreased body weight.
Irisin induces osteoblast differentiation, mineralization, and
β-catenin protein expression in the preosteoblastic cell line
MC3T3-E1
We then evaluated the direct effects of recombinant irisin
on osteoblast differentiation in vitro. When pre-osteoblastic
MC3T3-E1
cells
were
treated
with
recombinant
irisin,
mRNA expression of several osteogenic markers was
upregulated, including osterix, Runt-related transcription
factor 2, special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2, bone
sialoprotein, and collagen I (Figure 4a). In addition, irisin
significantly increased mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells at
6 weeks (Figure 4b).
In agreement with irisin-activating bone formation signal-
ing mechanisms, we detected significantly higher β-catenin
protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cultures treated with irisin and
ascorbic acid for 6 h than in control cells (Figure 4c). Irisin also
significantly decreased levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin at 3

 and 6 h (Figure 4d), whereas increased nuclear β-catenin
levels (Figure 4e) at all times investigated.
Taken together, our results suggested that irisin can signal
osteoblasts directly and increase osteoblastogenesis and
mineralization via β-catenin signaling.
Irisin inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in
pre-osteoclastic RAW264.7 cells
We then evaluated the direct effects of recombinant irisin
on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in pre-osteoclastic
RAW264.7 cells. Expression of osteoclast differentiation
markers including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and
cathepsin K, significantly decreased at 3 days by irisin
treatment (Figure 5a). Furthermore, irisin treatment signifi-
cantly
decreased
tartrate-resistant
acid
phosphatase-
positive multinucleated cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 5b), and nuclear factor of activated T cells mRNA
and protein expression levels in RANKL-treated RAW264.7
cells on day 6 (Figure 5c). In addition, irisin inhibited
expression of calcineurin and phosphorylation of JNK at
60 min, and phosphorylation of Akt1 at 10 and 30 min in
RANKL-treated RAW264.7 cells (Figure 5d).
Taken together, our results indicated that irisin signifi-
cantly reduced RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via
downregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1.
Irisin increases trabecular and cortical bone thickness
in vivo
We later investigated whether recombinant irisin could
directly regulate bone metabolism in vivo. IP injections of
irisin for 14 days induced the appearance of irisin-positive
osteoblasts at the edge of the growth plate (Figure 6a)
and led to threefold higher irisin levels in circulation than in
control mice (Figure 6b). μCT analyses of femoral bones
revealed
significant
increases
of
bone
volume/total
volume, trabecular thickness, and cortical thickness in the
irisin-treated group as compared with the saline-treated
group (Figure 6c and d). The irisin-treated group was also
characterized by increased osteoblast numbers (Figure 6e)
and unchanged osteoclast numbers (Figure 6e) as com-
pared with the control group.
FNDC5 increases cortical thickness of bone in vivo
Next, we used a different animal protocol in which
mice were injected IP with FNDC5 or EGFP control viral
particles. Four weeks after the lentiviral injections, the
FNDC5 lentiviral group showed significantly increased
FNDC5 mRNA expression in bone (Figure 7a). FNDC5
lentivirus injection also increased FDNC5 and UCP1 mRNA
levels in epididymal WAT (Figure 7b) and subcutaneous
WAT
(Figure
7c).
However,
differences
of
FNDC5
mRNA levels in red muscle between control and FNDC5
lentiviral group were not statistically significant (Figure 7c).
Most importantly, mRNA of
osteogenic
differentiation
markers including osterix, bone sialoprotein, and ALP was
increased in bones of the FNDC5 lentivirus group as
compared with the control group (Figure 7d). μCT analyses
further revealed significant increases of cortical thickness in
the FNDC5 virus group as compared with the control group
(Figure 7e and f).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have reported that murine bone tissues
express FNDC5/irisin as determined by qRT-PCR, western
blot, and immunohistochemical analyses. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated that 2 weeks of voluntary wheel-
running exercise in mice increased FNDC5/irisin expression
at the mRNA and protein levels in exercised bones as
compared with controls. The exercise protocol used in our
study induced PGC1α/FNDC5/irisin signaling and expres-
sion of osteogenic markers in bone, and concurrently
increased UCP1 mRNA expression in subcutaneous WAT
and decreased average body weight. These results were in
agreement
with
the
notion
of
exercise-induced
irisin
production by bone contributed to WAT browning by
releasing irisin to circulation and increasing osteogenesis by
autocrine mechanisms. Our ELISA results demonstrated
that levels of irisin in circulation did not significantly change
following 7 days of exercise, but significantly decreased
following 14 days of voluntary running. When APN knockout
mice were subjected to the same exercise protocol as
wild-type mice, serum irisin levels were increased following
14
days
of
exercise,
being
the
only
animal
model
investigated in our lab that exhibited a sustained enough
increase
to
be
detected
by
ELISA.
It
is
likely
that
adiponectin and other adipokines upregulated with exer-
cise may work synergistically or antagonistically with irisin to
mediate exercise-induced effects in bone strengthening
and WAT browning. Thus, it has been reported that
adiponectin is increased after 12 weeks of exercise training
in humans42 and bone tissues express adiponectin and its
receptors.43
Most
importantly,
adiponectin
has
been
shown to promote anabolic effects in bone,32–33 partly by
decreasing the sympathetic tone. It is also known that
browning of WAT and bone remodeling are regulated by
the sympathetic nervous system10,44 and reduced BAT
function in Misty mice leads to altered sympathetic nervous
system activity and bone loss.10 In conclusion, the exercise-
induced irisin production in bone may not be the only
mechanism leading to increased osteogenesis and WAT
browning, and some of those effects could be mediated
by other adipokines regulated by exercise.
Several reports in the literature have suggested or
demonstrated that irisin could have a role in bone

 formation or bone fracture prevention. First, irisin levels in
circulation were described to be lower than normal in
patients with T2D,23 which exhibit increased risk of osteo-
porosis and bone fractures,25 and in subjects who suffered
from osteoporotic fractures.26–27 Second, it was suggested
that irisin secreted by exercised skeletal muscle could
induce osteogenesis at the bone–muscle interface. In that
study, authors showed that conditioned media from
primary cultures of myoblasts and myotubes isolated from
exercised muscles increased osteogenic differentiation of
bone marrow stromal cells.34 Recombinant irisin was also
reported to mediate anabolic effects in bone when
2-month-old
mice
received
weekly
injections
of
100 μg·kg − 1 for 4 weeks.35 In our study, we found mice
injected at an 89-fold lower daily dose and for 2 weeks
exhibited a 3-fold increase of irisin levels in circulation,
which correlated with increased osteoblast numbers and
enhanced mRNA expression of osteogenic markers in
bone without significant effects on osteoclast numbers.
Furthermore,
UCP1
mRNA
in
WAT
was
upregulated,
suggesting that irisin promoted the browning response as
well. In agreement with the ability of recombinant irisin to
recapitulate some of the beneficial effects of exercise in
the skeleton by directly signaling on osteoblasts, we found
irisin increased MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic differentiation and
bone mineralization in vitro. Irisin treatment in vivo was
shown by other investigators to decrease Sost mRNA
expression35 and sclerostin-mediated bone response to
mechanical unloading through antagonizing Wnt/β-cate-
nin signaling.45 In our study, we found recombinant irisin
increased nuclear localization of β-catenin in MC3T3-E1
osteoblast precursor cells in vitro. It is, therefore, tempting to
speculate that irisin activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling
could have derived from irisin inhibiting sclerostin, which
would
relieve
the
sclerostin-mediated
suppression
of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling, resulting in its activation. Because
UCP1 mRNA was upregulated in WAT in our in vivo study,
recombinant irisin could have mediated indirect effects on
bone metabolism by promoting WAT browning, which was
reported to be anabolic for the skeleton.9–10,22 Thus, it has
been described that young women with cold-activated
BAT have higher bone mineral density than those without
BAT.22 Furthermore, impaired BAT function in Misty mice
has been correlated with increased sympathetic tone,
impaired
bone
formation,
and
increased
bone
resorption.10 Mechanistic studies have also shown that
brite
cells
can
induce
osteogenesis9
by
releasing
factors including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein
2 and wingless-related mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV) integration site 10 b that decrease sclerostin
expression and increase RANKL expression by osteocytes.
Because sclerostin is a negative regulator of bone forma-
tion that inhibits WNT signaling in osteoblasts,46 and RANKL
enhances osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, it is
plausible that the indirect effects of irisin in bone metabo-
lism through WAT browning could oppose some of the
direct effects of irisin in bone cells in our in vivo study. Our
μCT
experiments
demonstrated
both
trabecular
and
cortical thickness increased in the irisin-treated group
respect to the saline-treated group. As overexpression of
FNDC5 was previously described to induce the browning
response,11 the increased cortical bone thickness observed
in the FNDC5 lentiviral group could be partly resulting from
the brown adipose tissue expansion response in addition to
direct effects of cleaved irisin on bone cells. It is tempting to
speculate that the bone phenotype resulting from FNDC5
lentiviral experiments mostly derived from the WAT brown-
ing response, although direct effects on osteoblast differ-
entiation could not be discounted, as mRNA of osteogenic
differentiation markers including osterix, bone sialoprotein,
and ALP was increased in bones of the FNDC5 lentivirus
group as compared with the control group. In a different
in vivo study by other investigators, mice injected with an
89-fold higher daily dose of recombinant irisin for 4 weeks
exhibited a significantly increased cortical bone mass and
parameters of bone strength,35 decreased osteoclast
numbers, and increased osteoblast numbers. The higher
bone response of irisin in that study could be partly derived
from a lack of induction of the browning response and/or
higher irisin levels being induced in circulation than in our
in vivo studies with either recombinant irisin or FNDC5
lentiviral experiments.
Different
laboratories
attempting
to
investigate
the
activation of PGC1α/FNDC5/irisin signaling by exercise in
skeletal muscle or WAT have obtained results that are
difficult to reconcile. Some of the inconsistencies have
been attributed to differences in the exercise protocol,
animal species, and mouse strains, or their choice of anti-
FNDC5/irisin antibodies.11,14,19–21 Induction of FNDC5/irisin
expression by PGC1α and exercise was initially described
after 3 weeks of free wheel-running exercise in 12-week-old
B6 mice and 10 weeks of aerobic training in non-diabetic
human subjects.11 Other studies replicated the stimulatory
effect of exercise on irisin secretion in humans11,15,47 and
demonstrated that irisin secretion could be induced not
only by exercise but also by cold exposure in healthy
subjects.15 Additional studies using rats have suggested
that there could be a good relationship between the
abundance of PGC1α and FNDC5, and the oxidative
capacity of skeletal muscle. Thus, it was shown that PGC1α
and FNDC5 mRNA expression, and FNDC5 protein levels
were not different after exercise in the soleus, but there was
a significant increase in PGC1α and FNDC5
protein
expression in extensor digitorum longus in high running
capacity rats.20 Another study showed higher FNDC5
expression by rat muscle after 3 weeks of voluntary wheel

 exercise14 without a significant increase of PGC1α expres-
sion in exercised muscles. When a similar study was
performed with murine muscle, mRNA expression levels of
PGC1α different transcripts (resulting from alternative spli-
cing) were slightly increased, decreased, or did not
change depending on the transcript evaluated.19 In the
same study, significant upregulation of PGC1α expression
at the mRNA and protein level, was only detected after
acute exercise and correlated with increased levels of irisin
in skeletal muscle and serum. The same study could not
detect any changes in FNDC5 protein expression after
acute exercise or 3 weeks of voluntary wheel running in
mouse skeletal muscle. In that study, irisin did not increase
in serum or skeletal muscle after 3 weeks of voluntary
exercise, but it did after a bout of acute exercise with a
treadmill. In our mouse study, we found that mRNA levels
were downregulated in a time-dependent manner in red
muscle following 2 weeks of exercise. In addition, FNDC5
mRNA expression in WAT did not change significantly after
exercise,
and
PGC1α
mRNA
was
unchanged
after
exercise in skeletal muscle and WAT (data not shown).
Another study was only able to find a transient increase of
PGC1α in subcutaneous adipose tissue after a week of
exercise
training,
but
not
after
longer
periods
of
exercise
in
rats.14
The
transient
PGC1α
expression
pattern in WAT correlated with increased FNDC5/irisin
secretion at 1 week of exercise, and a significant decrease
of FNDC5/irisin secretion at 3 weeks.14 Some of the
inconsistencies reported by these publications and by our
results can be attributed to differences in the animal
protocol (different exercise program, animal species, or
animal age), but also to the choice of anti-FNDC5/irisin
antibodies. Thus, several studies used antibodies that could
not detect irisin per se, but the C terminus of FNDC5 that
does not include any sequence from the irisin peptide.11,14
However, we and others used antibodies for western blot
and immunostaining
that
can
detect
a
quantifiable
~ 12 kDa protein band due to irisin and a ~ 25 kDa protein
band due to FNDC5 protein.19,21 Furthermore, we used
a
different antibody for
ELISA
experiments
that
was
described to detect serum irisin levels specifically. Taken
together,
our
expression
analysis
results
accurately
represent the complexity of irisin physiology, and therefore
are not artifacts resulting from using the wrong anti-irisin
antibodies or ELISA kits.
Our findings and the existing literature demonstrate that
activation of PGC1α/FNDC5/irisin produced by bone could
have a role in bone metabolism by direct and indirect
mechanisms (Figure 8). Furthermore, expression of FNDC5
and irisin can be upregulated after 2 weeks of wheel-
running exercise in bone, and increased irisin levels in
circulation

Figure 8.
Proposed model of irisin direct and indirect effects on bone metabolism. Exercise, cold exposure, administration with recombinant irisin,
or overexpressing FNDC5 can potentially lead to increased levels of irisin in circulation according to the bibliography. In our study, 2 weeks of
voluntary exercise increased expression of FNDC5/Irisin and osteogenic markers in bone (Figure 1), increased serum irisin levels in mice lacking
adiponectin expression (Figure 2), and upregulated UCP1 expression by subcutaneous WAT while reducing body weight (Figure 3). Recombinant
irisin induced osteoblast differentiation (Figure 4) and inhibited osteoclast differentiation (Figure 5) in bone cells lines. Systemic administration of
irisin (Figure 6) or FNDC5 overexpression (Figure 7) could potentially regulate bone metabolism in vivo by direct mechanisms on bone cells or
indirectly because browning of WAT (mediated by irisin or FNDC5) is anabolic for the skeleton.9–10,22 Recombinant irisin has also been shown to
suppress sclerostin,35 which mediates bone response to mechanical unloading through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.45

 recapitulate part of the beneficial effects of exercise in the
skeletal system. Our results also suggest that irisin may have
a therapeutic potential in strengthening bone in bone-loss-
associated
diseases.
Further
experimentation
will
be
needed to support the promise of irisin’s therapeutic
potential to provide a myriad of health benefits to patients
with obesity and T2D.
In conclusion, exercise-induced FNDC5/irisin may not
only act as endocrine factors capable of promoting WAT
browning but could also regulate bone metabolism by
autocrine mechanisms. Our results provide insight into the
complex regulatory interplay of muscle, bone, and fat
tissues. Further experimentation will be needed to evaluate
the involvement of other soluble factors increased by
exercise and expressed by bone, WAT, and muscle such as
adiponectin in exercise-induced irisin effects.
