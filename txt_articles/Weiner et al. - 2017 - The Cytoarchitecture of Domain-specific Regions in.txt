Abstract
A fundamental hypothesis in neuroscience proposes that underlying cellular architecture (cytoarchitecture) contributes to
the functionality of a brain area. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC)
that contains domain-specific regions causally involved in perception. To fill this gap in knowledge, we used cortex-based
alignment to register functional regions from living participants to cytoarchitectonic areas in ex vivo brains. This
novel approach reveals 3 findings. First, there is a consistent relationship between domain-specific regions and
cytoarchitectonic areas: each functional region is largely restricted to 1 cytoarchitectonic area. Second, extracting
cytoarchitectonic profiles from face- and place-selective regions after back-projecting each region to 20-μm thick
histological sections indicates that cytoarchitectonic properties distinguish these regions from each other. Third, some
cytoarchitectonic areas contain more than 1 domain-specific region. For example, face-, body-, and character-selective
regions are located within the same cytoarchitectonic area. We summarize these findings with a parsimonious hypothesis
incorporating how cellular properties may contribute to functional specialization in human VTC. Specifically, we link
computational principles to correlated axes of functional and cytoarchitectonic segregation in human VTC, in which
parallel processing across domains occurs along a lateral–medial axis while transformations of information within
domain occur along an anterior–posterior axis.

Introduction
Human
ventral
temporal
cortex
(VTC)
contains
functional
regions that are selective for specific domains such as faces
(Puce et al. 1995; Kanwisher et al. 1997; Grill-Spector et al. 2004;
Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010), places (Epstein and Kanwisher
1998), words (Cohen et al. 2000), and bodies (Peelen and
Downing 2005a). These regions are also causally involved in the
perception of domain-specific information (Gaillard et al. 2006;
Parvizi et al. 2012; Megevand et al. 2014; Rangarajan et al. 2014).
Interestingly, the anatomical location of these regions is repro-
ducible across people (Peelen and Downing 2005a,
2005b;
Spiridon et al. 2006; Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010; Nasr et al.
2011; Julian et al. 2012; Grill-Spector and Weiner 2014) and even
predictable from cortical folding alone (Glezer and Riesenhuber
2013; Grill-Spector and Weiner 2014). Recent evidence indicates
that anatomical features such as white matter (Saygin et al.
2012; Yeatman et al. 2012; Gomez et al. 2015; Osher et al. 2016;
Wandell 2016; Weiner et al. 2016) and myelination (Glasser
and Van Essen 2011) contribute to the consistent cortical loca-
tion of functional regions especially for the large-scale posi-
tioning of face-selective regions on the lateral fusiform gyrus (FG)
and of place-selective regions in the collateral sulcus (CoS; Glasser
and Van Essen 2011; Saygin et al. 2012; Gomez et al. 2015).
However, a long-standing and fundamental hypothesis in
neuroscience is that differences in the microarchitecture of
cell bodies across cortical layers (referred to as cytoarchitec-
ture) also contribute to the cortical location and functionality
of brain regions (Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas
1925; Hubel and Wiesel 1977; Van Essen et al. 1992; Zilles and
Amunts 2010; Amunts and Zilles 2015). This hypothesis pre-
dicts that cortical regions in human VTC that process informa-
tion related to different domains would be located within
different cytoarchitectonic areas. This hypothesis has not been
tested for 2 main reasons. First, while the correspondence
between cytoarchitecture and functional regions has been
examined in non-human primates (typically macaques; Gross
et al. 1972; Van Essen and Zeki 1978; Boussaoud et al. 1991;
Zangenehpour and Chaudhuri 2005; Borra et al. 2010), the FG,
which is a large macroanatomical component of VTC (Weiner
and Zilles 2016), is a hominoid-specific gyrus that macaques
do not have. Thus, understanding if and how underlying cyto-
architectonics contribute to the functional organization of the
FG—and human VTC more broadly—necessitates measure-
ments in humans. Second, only recently, observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic techniques have revealed a microstructural
heterogeneity of human VTC consisting of 4 cytoarchitectonic
areas spanning the FG and nearby sulci (Caspers et al. 2013;
Lorenz et al. 2015). The identification of these cytoarchitectonic
areas generates a new opportunity to examine the correspond-
ence between the functional and cytoarchitectonic heterogen-
eity of human VTC for the first time.
Understanding and quantifying the relationship between cyto-
architectonic areas and functional regions of human VTC in indi-
vidual brains requires relating functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data at a macroscale (millimeters to centimeters)
in living participants to cytoarchitectonic data at a microscale
(microns) in postmortem (PM) brains. Prior studies successfully
achieved this goal in early visual cortex by leveraging the tight
relationship between both types of data and cortical folding using
cortex-based alignment (CBA) (Fischl et al. 2008; Hinds et al. 2009).
Since there is a tight relationship between both types of data and
cortical folding in VTC (Weiner et al. 2014; Lorenz et al. 2015), we
applied similar techniques in this study. In brief (Fig. 1; Materials
and Methods), we registered cytoarchitectonic areas defined in
histological slices of PM brains to a common brain using CBA to
generate probabilistic maps of cytoarchitectonic regions of inter-
est (cROIs). Then, we used CBA to register probabilistic cROIs to
functional regions of interest (fROIs) from individual living partici-
pants and quantified the correspondence between cytoarchitec-
tonic areas and functional regions. Crucially, the implementation
of this analysis pipeline in the reverse order also enables the
extraction of cytoarchitectonic profiles from fROIs by registering
and projecting probabilistic fROIs to individual histological sec-
tions of PM brains.
Using this novel approach, we examined the relationship
between domain-specific regions and cytoarchitectonic areas of
human VTC. Our data indicate that there is a consistent rela-
tionship between domain-specific regions and cytoarchitectonic
areas: each functional region is largely restricted to 1 cytoarchi-
tectonic area. However, this relationship is not bidirectional, as

 some cytoarchitectonic areas contain more than 1 domain-
specific region. These findings support a new hypothesis sug-
gesting what computational principles may explain the orderly
but complex relationship between functional regions and cyto-
architectonic areas of human VTC.
Materials and Methods
Definitions of functional regions and cytoarchitectonic areas
were done by independent researchers—researchers defining
functional regions were blind to cytoarchitectonic definitions
and vice versa. Data collection, analyses, and definitions of fROIs
of in vivo data were done by K.W., A.S., M.B., and K.G-.S. at
Stanford University. Data collection, analysis of PM data, and
definition of cROIs were done at the Institute of Neuroscience
and Medicine (INM-1), Research Centre Jülich, by J.C., S.L., K.A.,
and K.Z.
Participants of the In Vivo Study
Twelve right-handed participants (5 female, ages 19–44 years)
with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were recruited from
Stanford University for the functional mapping experiment,
which was used to identify high-level visual regions in human
VTC. Procedures were approved by the Stanford Internal Review
Board on human subjects research.
In Vivo Data Acquisition and Analyses
Anatomical Scans and Analyses
Scanning. A high-resolution anatomical volume of the whole
brain was acquired using a 3 T GE Discovery MR750 scanner (T1-
weighted BRAVO pulse sequence; resolution: 1 mm × 1 mm ×
1 mm, TI = 450 ms, flip angle = 12°, 1 NEX, FOV = 240 mm).
Cortical surface reconstruction. Anatomical volumes were aligned to
the AC-PC plane. Using a combination of automated (FreeSurfer:
http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu)
and
manual
segmentation
tools
(ITK-SNAP:
http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php),
each anatomical volume was segmented to separate gray from
white matter, from which we reconstructed the cortical surface for
each participant (Wandell et al. 2000). These cortical surface recon-
structions were used in both mrVista and FreeSurfer.
Functional Scans and Analyses
Data acquisition. Participants were scanned using a custom-built
phase-array, 32-channel head coil. We acquired 34 slices covering
occipitotemporal cortex (resolution: 2.4 mm × 2.4 mm × 2.4 mm;
one-shot T2*-sensitive gradient echo acquisition sequence: FOV =
192 mm, TE = 30 ms, TR = 2000 ms, and flip angle = 77°).
Functional localizer. Two sessions of fMRI data were collected
from each participant on different days. On the first day, 10
runs of an fMRI functional localizer experiment from Stigliani
et al. (2015) were collected. Each run contained blocks of differ-
ent images from 5 different categories: faces (adult and child
faces), places (corridors and houses), bodies (limbs and head-
less bodies), characters (numbers, pseudowords), and objects
(cars and guitars). Each run contained images presented at dif-
ferent rates (either 1, 2, 4, or 8 Hz). Stimulus trials were counter-
balanced with blank baseline trials. In each run, stimuli were
shown at one rate. The order of runs at different rates was
counterbalanced across participants. The same set of 1440
images was shown across all rates, but images did not repeat
within a rate. Participants conducted an oddball task during
which they fixated on a central dot and detected an oddball
phase scrambled image that occurred randomly in a block. The
incidence of the oddball image was 0, 1, or 2 times per block.
We chose this task as it keeps participants engaged during the
experiment and is frequently used in studies of human VTC
(Kanwisher et al. 1997; Gauthier et al. 2000; Glezer et al. 2009;
Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010, 2011; Stigliani et al. 2015.
Additionally, responses in VTC in the oddball task are similar
to other tasks that require explicit processing of the visual
images such as categorization tasks (Weiner and Grill-Spector
2010; Weiner et al. 2010), 1 or 2-back tasks (Weiner and Grill-
Spector 2010; Weiner et al. 2010; Bugatus et al. 2015), or select-
ive attention (Bugatus et al. 2015, 2016).
On the second day, participants participated in 2 runs total-
ing 11 minutes of the 1 Hz localizer experiment with the same
stimuli and task. The purpose of the second experiment was to
extract response amplitudes from fROIs using independent
data (Fig. 2).
Data analysis. Data were analyzed with MATLAB using mrVista
software (http://github.com/vistalab) as in our prior publica-
tions (Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010; Stigliani et al. 2015).
Time series processing. Functional data of each session were
motion corrected using an affine transformation (Nestares and
Heeger 2000). Time series data were processed with a temporal
high-pass filter using a 1/20 Hz cutoff and then converted to
percentage signal change by dividing the time series of each
voxel by its mean intensity. We estimated blood oxygen level–
dependent (BOLD) response amplitudes for each condition with
a general linear model (GLM) applied to the time series of each
voxel using as predictors the experimental conditions con-
volved with the hemodynamic impulse response function in
SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Data were not spatially
smoothed.
Functional regions of interest. FROIs were defined in individual
participants from the functional localizer using anatomical and
functional
criteria
(Weiner
and
Grill-Spector
2010,
2012;
Stigliani et al. 2015). A common threshold (t > 3, voxel level)
was used to define all regions across all participants. Since the
cytoarchitectonic ROIs (described in the next section) are
located in the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), FG, and CoS, we
restricted our definition of fROIs to these anatomical regions.
As in our prior publications (Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010,
2012; Stigliani et al. 2015), we identified 2 face-selective ROIs
(faces > others) bilaterally on the posterior (pFus-faces, N = 12)
and mid (mFus-faces, N = 12) FG; pFus-faces is often referred to
as FFA-1 and mFus-faces as FFA-2, where FFA refers to the fusi-
form face area (Kanwisher et al. 1997).
Between mFus-faces and pFus-faces, we identified a body-
selective region (bodies and limbs > others) in the OTS (N = 12),
which is also referred to as the fusiform body area (FBA; Peelen
and Downing 2005a, 2005b; Schwarzlose et al. 2005).
As in our prior publications, we also identified 2 character-
selective ROIs (characters > others; Stigliani et al. 2015) within
the left hemisphere on the posterior (pOTS-chars, N = 12) and
mid (mOTS-chars, N = 10) OTS. These ROIs are also referred to as
VWFA-1 and VWFA-2, respectively (Stigliani et al. 2015), where
VWFA refers to the visual word form area (Cohen et al. 2000;
Ben-Shachar et al. 2011; Dehaene and Cohen 2011). In the right
hemisphere, we also report data from pOTS-chars/VWFA-1

 (N = 12), but not mOTS-chars/VWFA-2, as we were able to iden-
tify VWFA-2 in only 2 participants within the right hemisphere.
Finally, we identify a place-selective ROI (places > others)
within the CoS (N = 12), corresponding to the parahippocampal
place area (PPA; Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998). CoS-places/PPA
has been recently parcellated into separate posterior and anter-
ior components based on functional connectivity and weaker
selectivity in the posterior compared with the anterior portion
(Baldassano et al. 2013; Silson et al. 2015). Our analyses focus
on the anterior CoS-places/PPA because this cortical location
is the most consistent across participants and is predictive
of clusters exhibiting the highest place-selectivity in over
500 participants (Weiner et al. Under review). Nevertheless,
additional analyses show weakly place-selective voxels in FG1
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Independent analysis of functional responses. Individual data
from day 2 were aligned to each participant’s high-resolution
anatomical brain volume. Using fROIs defined in day 1, we
extracted
response
amplitudes
to
faces,
objects,
bodies,
places, and characters from day 2. Response amplitudes from
each fROI were averaged across the 12 participants (Fig. 2A,
bottom).

 PM Data Acquisition and Analysis
Histological analyses were performed on eleven PM brains
(ages 37–85, 6 females), which had no history of neurological or
psychiatric disease (with exception of 1 individual with transi-
tory motor disease). These were the same brains used in prior
cytoarchitectonic studies (Caspers et al. 2013; Lorenz et al.
2015). Nine of the PM brains were shared across the Caspers
and Lorenz studies (see table 1 in each of these studies), and
each cytoarchitectonic area was defined in 10 PM brains
(5 females). All PM brains came from the body donor program
of the Institute of Anatomy, University of Dusseldorf; all proce-
dures were approved and in alignment with the program guide-
lines (Amunts et al. 2000).
Scanning
PM brains were scanned on a Siemens 1.5 T Scanner (Erlangen,
Germany). Brains were removed from the subject’s skull 8–24 h
after death and then fixated in 4% formalin or Bodian’s fixative
for at least 6 months. A high-resolution anatomical volume
of the whole fixed brain was acquired using a T1-weighted
3D-FLASH sequence (TR = 40 ms, flip angle = 40°, TE = 5 ms).
Histological Processing
Detailed methods of histological processing have been pub-
lished previously (Amunts et al. 2000; Caspers et al. 2013;
Lorenz et al. 2015). Briefly, the fixated brains were embedded in
paraffin, serially sectioned in coronal sections (20 μm thick),
and cell bodies were stained using the Merker-method (Amunts
et al. 2000). This method yields a high contrast between cell
bodies (black) and the neuropil (unstained). 3D reconstructions
of the histological sections were computed using 1) the 3D-MRI
volume of each brain, 2) images of the paraffin block face for
precise alignment of the histological sections, and 3) digitized
images of the cell body–stained sections.
Definition of Cytoarchitectonic Regions
FG1, FG2, FG3, and FG4. FG1 and FG2 were defined by Caspers
et al. (2013), and FG3 and FG4 were defined by Lorenz et al. (2015)
from 20-μm thick sections of 10 PM brains using a statistically
testable, quantitative, and observer-independent cortical parcel-
lation technique (Amunts et al. 2000; Schleicher et al. 2000;
Caspers et al. 2013). Procedures are described in detail in prior
publications (Caspers et al. 2013; Lorenz et al. 2015). In brief,
gray-level indices (GLIs) were determined in digitized histo-
logical sections as a measure of the volume proportion between
cell bodies and the neuropil. GLI profiles were calculated along
curvilinear trajectories oriented perpendicular to the cortical
layers, thus measuring the GLI from Layer I/Layer II border to
the innermost layer in cortical regions of interest. The shape of
GLI profiles was determined based on 10 features: the mean GLI
value, the position of the center of gravity on the profile curve
(cortical depth), the standard deviation of the mean GLI (indicat-
ing the variability of the GLI throughout all layers), skewness
and kurtosis of the profile curve, and the respective features
from the profile’s first derivative (Amunts et al. 2000; Schleicher
et al. 2000). The borders between areas were determined based
on the cortical position of the greatest difference between neigh-
boring GLI profiles quantified by the Mahalanobis distance and
tested for significance (Hotelling’s T2 test; Bonferroni-corrected).
Areal borders are expected at positions along the cortical ribbon
showing a significant dissimilarity in laminar patterns between
adjacent blocks of profiles. To assure that the areal boundary
was not dependent on the block size, the procedure was titrated
for block sizes ranging from 8 to 24 profiles per block. Cortical
borders were confirmed if they were consistently positioned in
adjacent histological sections and across several block sizes.
As illustrated in Figure 2B, these 4 FG cytoarchitectonic
areas macroanatomically include both the FG and adjacent sul-
ci: the medial cytoarchitectonic areas, FG1 and FG3, include the
medial aspect of the FG and the CoS, while the lateral cyto-
architectonic areas, FG2 and FG4, include the lateral aspect of
the FG and the OTS (Caspers et al. 2013; Lorenz et al. 2015).
Registering cROIs to Individual Cortical Surfaces
After cROIs were defined in the histological sections (Fig. 1A),
they were aligned to the anatomical MRI of each PM’s native
brain volume (Fig. 1B) as described previously (Caspers et al. 2013;
Lorenz et al. 2015). We also generated cortical surface reconstruc-
tions of each PM brain by manually segmenting the anatomical
MRI to differentiate gray and white matter using ITK-SNAP
(http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php). From the bound-
ary between white and gray matter, we reconstructed the cortical
surfaces in both mrVista and FreeSurfer. Each individual’s cROIs
were then projected to their cortical surface (Fig. 1C).
Registration of Functional and Cytoarchictectonic ROIs to the
Freesurfer Average Brain
To examine the correspondence between cROIs and fROIs in a
common anatomical space, we used CBA implemented in
FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to align each sub-
ject’s cortical surface and ROIs to the FreeSurfer average brain,
which is an average of the cortical surface of 39 independent par-
ticipants (Fischl et al. 1999). As both living and PM subjects had
regions of interest defined in the mrVista software package, the
alignment process for fROIs and cROIs was the same. Both cROIs
and fROIs were saved as NIfTI files, imported into FreeSurfer,
and projected to the respective cortical mesh of each subject in
FreeSurfer. Using CBA, each subject’s ROIs were aligned to the
FreeSurfer average brain (Fischl et al. 1999). This CBA uses a
high-dimensional nonlinear registration algorithm, which aligns
the cortical folding patterns of each subject to the cortical folding
patterns of the FreeSurfer average cortical surface. A mapping of
the cortical folding patterns of each subject and the template to
a sphere generate a point-to-point correspondence between sub-
jects on the FreeSurfer average cortical surface.
Maximum Probability Maps of Cytoarchitectonic ROIs
On the FreeSurfer average cortical surface, we generated a max-
imum probability map (MPM) of each cROI using data from 10
PM brains (Fig. 3). We transformed each binary cROI (i.e., 1
where the cROI is present and 0 elsewhere) to the common cor-
tical surface and then averaged them on the common surface
to generate a probabilistic map of each ROI. The value at each
node of the map indicates the proportion of subjects that over-
lapped at that node for a given cROI (Fig. 3A). We then used an
exhaustive, leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to deter-
mine the threshold that produced the most predictive probabil-
istic cROIs (Fig. 3B). We estimated the predictability of the
probabilistic cROIs by calculating the dice coefficient between
the left-out and predicted cROIs:
=
|
∩
| + |
Dice Coefficient
P
A
P
A
2
,
where P are the nodes of the probabilistic cROI and A are the
nodes of the actual cROI of the left-out subject. Since our cROIs
are neighboring, probabilistic cROIs can have shared nodes on
the FreeSurfer average cortical surface. Thus, to ensure that each
node in the common cortical surface is assigned to a single cROI,
we generated an MPM of each probabilistic cROI. The MPMs were

 generated by first finding all overlapping nodes on the cortical
surface among the probabilistic cROIs and then assigning those
nodes to the cROI with the highest overlap across subjects. For
example, if a given node on the cortical surface had a probabilis-
tic value of 0.3 for FG1 and a probabilistic value of 0.6 for FG3,
then this node was assigned to the MPM of FG3 and excluded
from the MPM of FG1. We make these MPM ROIs freely available
for download with FreeSurfer and also directly from this link:
vpnl.stanford.edu/FGcROIAtlas.
Additionally, we also aligned the MPMs of our cROIs to the FS
average_sym template (Greve et al. 2013), which is a cortical sur-
face that enables between-hemisphere comparisons. Aligning
the MPMs of our cROIs to this surface illustrates that the topo-
logical layout of each area relative to cortical folding is largely
similar between the right and left hemispheres. Nevertheless,
there are also slight differences. For example, FG3 and FG4
extend more anteriorly in the left compared with the right
hemispheres. Additionally, FG2 extends more laterally in the
right compared with the left hemisphere (Supplementary Fig.
1). Importantly, these slight topological deviations between
hemispheres are also clearly evident in Figure 3.
Measuring the Correspondence between ROIs and cROIs
We quantified the correspondence between fROIs and cROIs by
calculating the percentage overlap between each individual
participant’s fROIs and the MPM of each cROI (Figs. 4, 7).
Importantly, to assess if these overlap values are meaningful, we
computed the chance proportion overlap between fROIs and
cROIs using permutation testing and then determined if the
overlap values were significantly different than the estimated
chance level. We estimated 2 kinds of chance overlap propor-
tions: 1) the chance proportion overlap between a given fROI and
any of the cROIs and 2) the chance proportion overlap between
any of the fROIs and any of the cROIs. The former was done by
randomly choosing cROIs and calculating the overlap between a
given fROI and a randomly chosen cROI, and the latter was done
by randomly choosing both fROIs and cROIs. Permutations were
done with 400 iterations per fROI per hemisphere and 400 itera-
tions per cROI per hemisphere. Figures 4 and 7 show the latter
estimate of chance overlap. While there were numerical differ-
ences across methods, the range of chance overlap from both
methods was similar ranging between 0.2 ± 0.03 and 0.25 ± 0.03.
Finally, we examined the spatial relationship between fROIs
and cROIs in each participant. Using CBA, we projected the MPM
of each cROI to the individual surface of each individual living par-
ticipant (Fig. 1E). This enabled us to 1) visualize the correspond-
ence between the MPM of the cROI and each participant’s fROIs
and 2) examine the pattern of errors when fROIs were not per-
fectly aligned to cROIs (4 example participants are shown in Fig. 8).
In addition to our single-subject analyses, we also generated
MPMs of fROIs on the FreeSurfer average cortical surface using

dice coefficient was obtained at thresholds of 0.3–0.4. Thus, for subsequent analyses, we used the 0.3 threshold. Line: mean dice coefficient. Shaded area: standard error

 data from all living participants using the same method as
described above for cROIs. We then registered MPMs of all fu-
nctional regions and cytoarchitectonic areas to the FreeSurfer
average cortical surface to generate a group-level summary of
functional–cytoarchitectonic relationships in human VTC (Fig. 9).
It should also be stated that we cannot rule out the possibility
that there are slight imprecisions in our approach because of
individual subject variability in fROIs, patterns of cortical folding,
and their relationship. However, we are confident in the accur-
acy of our approach as the resulting group MPMs of fROIs and
cROIs accurately preserve the topology of each type of ROI and
cortical folding in individual subjects, which indicates the preci-
sion of these alignment techniques as previously shown (Fischl
et al. 2008; Hinds et al. 2009). Errors exist in any study directly
comparing living and PM brains and are unavoidable until there
will be new methods that will enable measuring cytoarchitec-
tonic areas in vivo, which will, in turn, allow the direct compari-
son between cROIs and fROIs within the same individuals.
Examining the Effect of Contrast on the Distribution of Category
Selectivity Values within Each cROI
To complement the analyses described above examining the coup-
ling between fROIs and cROIs, we also assessed the functional–
cytoarchitectonic relationship within VTC by comparing the
distribution of category selectivity values across all voxels within
each cROI. This analysis is hypothesis-free as it 1) does not
necessitate localizing any fROIs and 2) is not dependent on the
threshold or contrast used to define fROIs. To perform this ana-
lysis, each probabilistic cROI was transformed to each living

 participant’s brain. Selectivity in each voxel within each cROI
was then determined by the t-value of the GLM contrast. In
Figure 5, we illustrate the distribution of face- and place-
selectivity across all voxels of FG3 and FG4. We assessed select-
ivity to faces in each voxel using 2 contrasts: 1) preferred versus
other categories and 2) preferred versus places. Selectivity to
places in each voxel was assessed with 2 contrasts: 1) places ver-
sus other categories and 2) places versus faces. We conducted a
non-parametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K-S test) to deter-
mine if the distributions of selectivity values in FG3 and FG4
were significantly different from each other in each subject.
Additionally, we include distributions of selectivity values for all
categories and all FG cROIs in Supplementary Figures 2–5.
Finally, to test if category selectivity significantly differed across
cROIs, we ran a 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the
mean selectivity using category, hemisphere, and cROI as
factors.
Transforming MPMs of Face- and Place-Selective fROIs
to Histological Sections
Using CBA, we registered the MPM of face-selective and place-
selective fROIs to the cortical surface of each PM brain. From the
PM’s cortical surface, we registered both of these MPMs to the
original PM brain volume obtained with an MRI scan. Then, we
registered these MPM fROIs to the reconstructed 3D histological
volume using a nonlinear transformation implemented in ANTS
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/advants/). Code used for this
transformation can be found here: github.com/VPNL/cyto-func-
tional. This procedure localizes the MPM fROIs to the original
histological slices within which the FG cROIs were defined, con-
sequently enabling the extraction of GLI profiles from the prob-
abilistic location of each fROI in histological sections (Fig. 6).
In these analyses, we focused on face- and place-selective
regions because they are located centimeters away from each
other across the cortical ribbon and are identifiable on single
histological sections with distinct macroanatomical landmarks.
As such, we were able to validate the accuracy of the localiza-
tion of fROIs in histological sections using 2 distinct domain-
specific macroanatomical landmarks: 1) the MFS as a landmark
for mFus-faces/FFA-2 (Weiner et al. 2014) and 2) the branching
of the CoS and intersection with the nearby anterior lingual
sulcus as landmarks for the anterior portion of CoS-places/PPA
(Weiner et al. Under review).
Results
Are Face- and Place-Selective Regions
Cytoarchitectonically Dissociable?
We first assessed the correspondence between the cortical loca-
tion of cytoarchitectonic areas within VTC relative to face-
selective (mFus-faces/FFA-2) and place-selective (CoS-places/
PPA) regions as these are 2 of the most widely studied domain-
specific regions in VTC, and their arrangement relative to the
cortical folding is consistent across individuals. Qualitative
assessments of the cortical location of mFus-faces/FFA-2 and
CoS-places/PPA relative to cytoarchitectonic areas indicate that
each of these regions is located within distinct cytoarchitec-
tonic areas. At the group level, mFus-faces/FFA-2 is located
within FG4 (Fig. 4A) and CoS-places/PPA is located within FG3
(Fig. 4D). Quantitative evaluation of the overlap between fROIs
in individual participants and the probabilistic maps of each of
the 4 FG cROIs revealed that 81 ± 24% (mean ± standard devi-
ation) of mFus-faces/FFA-2 is located within FG4 (Fig. 4C) and
75 ± 11% of CoS-places/PPA is located within FG3 (Fig. 4F).
These levels of overlap are significantly above chance (ts > 8.5,
Ps < 10−8, Fig. 4C,F-horizontal line) and show a significant fROI
by cROI interaction (F(3,88) = 380, P < 10−6, 2-way ANOVA with
factors of fROI and cROI). Visualizing the location of fROIs rela-
tive to cROIs in each participant (Fig. 4B,E) shows that the rela-
tionship among fROIs and cROIs is visible at the individual
subject level: mFus-faces/FFA-2 is located within FG4 and rarely
extends medially from FG4 into FG3 (Fig. 4B,C), while CoS-
places/PPA is largely located within FG3. Note that portions of
CoS-places/PPA not in FG3 extend medially into the lip of the
CoS and the parahippocampal gyrus and rarely deviate into
FG1, FG2, or FG4 (Fig. 4E,F). Thus, mFus-faces/FFA-2 and CoS-
places/PPA are located within different cytoarchitectonic areas.
We complemented these analyses by comparing the distri-
bution of face- and place-selectivity values in FG3 and FG4.
This analysis is hypothesis-free because it does not require the
definition of fROIs. Results show that while the contrast quanti-
tatively affects selectivity values, it does not qualitatively
change the pattern of results. Specifically, independent of con-
trast, FG3 and FG4 are differentially selective for places and
faces, respectively (Fig. 5; 2-sample K-S tests comparing the dis-
tributions of selectivity in FG3 and FG4 for all 4 contrasts: all
K-S stats > 0.3, all Ps < 10−6). Likewise, a 4-way ANOVA of mean
selectivity using as factors cROI (FG3/FG4), preferred category
(faces/places), contrast (preferred versus the other category/
preferred versus all categories), and hemisphere, reveals a sig-
nificant cROI x preferred category interaction (F(3,352) = 348.51,
P < 10−6), as well as significant cROI × preferred category × con-
trast interaction (F(3,352) = 5.12, P < 0.002). The former inter-
action
indicates
that
changing
the
contrast
does
not
qualitatively affect the result that FG3 and FG4 exhibit different
category preferences, while the latter (weaker) interaction
reflects that changing the contrast quantitatively affects the
magnitude of the t-values. These results complement our prior
analyses and provide empirical support demonstrating that the

 coupling between face-selectivity and FG4, as well as place-
selectivity and FG3, generalizes across analyses and is not
dependent on the definition of fROIs.
What Are the Cytoarchitectonic Features of Face- and
Place-Selective Regions?
We probed the underlying cytoarchitecture of mFus-faces/FFA-2
and CoS-places/PPA directly by back-projecting the MPMs of these
functional regions to cell body–stained sections and then extract-
ing histological profiles of these regions to examine the distribu-
tion of cells across layers (Fig. 6). This is akin to functional ROI
analyses in which an ROI is localized with one set of data, and
functional properties are determined from independent data. For
the first time, instead of probing functional properties of a region,
we extract cytoarchitectonic properties to reveal the cellular
structure of regions selective for faces and places.
Results show that mFus-faces/FFA-2 and CoS-places/PPA have
distinct cytoarchitectonic features as represented by GLI profiles of
cell body density across layers. The GLI profile of mFus-faces/FFA-
2 is characterized by a prominent sublayer IIIc with medium- to
large-sized pyramidal cells, a moderately dense layer IV, and a
slight overall increase of GLI from layer II to layer VI with several
local maxima and minima, but an absolute maximum in layer VI
(Fig. 6C–E). By contrast, CoS-places/PPA is characterized by a rela-
tively compact, dense layer II, a layer IV with little clusters of
granular cells, and a GLI curve that does not show a trend to
increase towards layer VI as found in mFus-faces/FFA-2 (Fig. 6C–E).
These results reveal the cytoarchitectonic features of face- and
place-selective regions for the first time and show that these
regions have distinct cytoarchitectonic characteristics.

 Regions Selective for the Same Domain are
Cytoarchitectonically Dissociable
As there are multiple face-selective regions in bilateral VTC
(Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010; Fig. 2A), we tested if regions
selective for the same domain are cytoarchitectonically dissoci-
able or not. Finding that regions selective for the same domain
are located within different cytoarchitectonic territories would
provide
empirical
evidence
supporting
that
these
regions
should
be
separated
based
on
different
cellular
features.
However, finding that regions selective for the same domain
are located within the same cytoarchitectonic territory would
provide evidence suggesting a common neural hardware that is
optimized to process stimuli of that domain, and furthermore,
that it is adequate to combine these functional regions.
Our data reveal that functional regions selective for the
same domain are cytoarchitectonically dissociable. Specifically,
functional regions that are situated anatomically posterior in
lateral VTC are cytoarchitectonically distinct from those that
are situated anatomically more anterior. In the domain of face-
selectivity, mFus-faces/FFA-2 is located largely in FG4, while
pFus-faces/FFA-1 is located largely within FG2 (Figs 7A and 8E,
significant fROI by cROI interaction, F(3,88) = 53.4, P < 10−6, 2-
way ANOVA with factors of fROI and cROI). As FG2 and FG4
illustrate cytoarchitectonic differences—for example, FG2 has a
conspicuous layer III with larger pyramidal cells than those in
FG4, as well as a prominent and dense layer IV compared with
FG4, which has a thin and moderately dense layer IV—these
results suggest a different cellular architecture in pFus-faces/
FFA-1 compared with mFus-faces/FFA-2.
In the domain of reading, there are also multiple character-
selective regions in lateral VTC of the left hemisphere (Stigliani
et al. 2015; Fig. 2A). Similar to our findings with respect to the
organization of face-selective regions, the more anterior mOTS-
chars/VWFA-2 is located within FG4 (Fig. 7B, Fig. 8D), while the
more posterior pOTS-chars/VWFA-1 is largely located within
FG2 (significant fROI by cROI interaction F(3,80) = 32, P < 10−6,
left hemisphere, Figs 7B and 8F). Together, these data indicate
that functional regions that are selective for the same domain
in posterior and mid portions of lateral VTC, respectively, are
located in different cytoarchitectonic territories.
There is a Many-to-One Mapping between Functional
Regions and Single Cytoarchitectonic Areas in Human
VTC
The prior analyses not only indicate that regions selective for the
same domain are cytoarchitectonically dissociable but also sug-
gest that multiple fROIs are contained within a single cROI.
Furthermore, as the surface areas of FG4 (957 ± 109 mm2) and FG2
(619 ± 75 mm2), respectively, are 2–3 times larger than that of
face- (268 ± 32 mm2) or character-selective regions (268 ± 32 mm2),
it is likely that there is a many-to-one mapping between multiple
functional regions and single cytoarchitectonic areas in human
VTC. Indeed, quantifying this correspondence reveals that FG4
contains 3 functional regions selective for different domains: 1)
81% ± 24% of mFus-faces/FFA-2; 2) 79 ± 25% of OTS-bodies/FBA,
and 3) 77 ± 25% mOTS-chars/VWFA-2 (Figs 7, 8B–D). This many-
to-one mapping between multiple fROIs and a single cROI is also
observed in the posterior FG, albeit more weakly: 49.5 ± 24% of
pFus-faces/FFA-1 and 40 ± 18% of pOTS-chars/VWFA-1 are both
located within FG2 (Figs. 7, 8E–F). Additionally, there are hemi-
spheric differences: a larger portion of pOTS-chars/VWFA-1 over-
laps FG2 in the right than left hemisphere, and the opposite is
observed for pFus-faces/FFA-1 (3-way fROI × cROI × hemisphere
interaction, F(3,176) = 4.5, P ≤ 0.005).
We also examined the distribution of selectivity across vox-
els for all categories and cROIs as we did for face-selectivity and
place-selectivity in FG3 and FG4. Results replicate the fROI-cROI
comparison, where voxels with substantial character selectivity
are largely located in FG2 and FG4, but not FG1 and FG3
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Body-selective voxels were located in
FG4 but not FG1 and FG3 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Additionally,
while none of our fROIs overlapped with FG1, this analysis
revealed that FG1 showed weak, but positive place-selectivity
(Supplementary Fig. 2), which is consistent with recent findings
of weak place-selectivity posterior to the more anterior CoS-
places/PPA (Baldassano et al. 2013; Silson et al. 2015). Finally, a
3-way ANOVA on the mean selectivity of each of the 4 cROIs for
faces, places, characters, and bodies using cROI, category, and
hemisphere as factors found a strong and significant interaction
between cROI and category (F(9,736) = 146.3, P < 10−6), as well as
a weak but significant interaction between cROI, category, and
hemisphere (F(9,736) = 2.9, P < 0.002). Together, these analyses
indicate differential functional characteristics across cROIs, as
well as illustrate that our results are not analysis-specific or
dependent on the definition of fROIs.
Summary of Functional and Cytoarchitectonic
Organization of Human VTC
To provide a complete group-level summary of the relationship
between the cytoarchitectonic and functional organization of
human VTC, we generated an overlay of the MPMs of the 6
fROIs selective to faces, bodies, characters, and places relative to
the MPM of the 4 FG cROIs (Fig. 9). The group-level visualization
mirrors the organization quantified at the individual subject
level. In summary, 1) CoS-places/PPA is largely in FG3, 2) mFus-
faces/FFA-2,
OTS-bodies/FBA,
and
mOTS-chars/VWFA-2
are
within FG4, and 3) pFus-faces/FFA-1 and pOTS-chars/VWFA-1
are largely within FG2. Altogether, these results suggest that

Discussion
By leveraging recent advancements in understanding the func-
tional and cytoarchitectonic organization of human VTC, we were
able to link functional regions in living participants to cytoarchi-
tectonic areas in PM histological slices within VTC for the first
time. Our findings provide empirical evidence supporting the
hypothesis that cellular features contribute to functional organiza-
tion in human VTC. The finding of a many-to-one mapping
between domain-specific regions and a single cytoarchitectonic
area in human VTC challenges classic theories in the field of
neuroscience proposing that there is a one-to-one mapping
between functional and cytoarchitectonic areas (Campbell 1905;
Smith 1907; Brodmann 1909). We discuss the implications and the-
oretical ramifications of our findings in the subsequent sections.
Beyond BOLD: Linking Cellular Architecture to the
Functional Organization of Domain-specific Regions
These findings provide the first insight into the cellular architec-
ture of domain-specific regions in human VTC. This is an
important advancement for 3 reasons. First, previous fMRI studies
have shown that the functional organization of high-level visual
regions in the FG and surrounding cortex is reproducible across
individuals (Levy et al. 2001; Nasr et al. 2011; Julian et al. 2012;

 Weiner et al. 2014). The findings from the present study show that
these measurements from a blood oxygen–dependent signal,
which is an indirect measure of neural activity, have cellular
underpinnings. Second, fMRI measurements are at a larger spatial
scale than the cortical microstructure. As such, we have improved
our scale of understanding regarding the functional–structural
organization of human VTC from centimeters to microns. Third,
we provide new insights regarding the functional–cytoarchitec-
tonic organization of the FG, which cannot be inferred from prior
research in non-human primate inferotemporal cortex (Gross
et al. 1972; Van Essen and Zeki 1978; Boussaoud et al. 1991;
Zangenehpour and Chaudhuri 2005; Borra et al. 2010) because the
FG is a hominoid-specific structure absent in the macaque brain
(Nasr et al. 2011; Weiner and Zilles 2016).
This study provides the first evidence that cellular differ-
ences contribute to functional segregation of domain-specific
regions in human high-level visual cortex. This segregation on
the cortical sheet occurs for regions selective for different
domains as well as for distinct regions processing information
from the same domain. Specifically, we find that differences in
cellular architecture distinguish 1) human face- and place-
selective regions and 2) regions selective for the same domain
even if they are located on the same macroanatomical territory,
such as face-selective regions on the FG. Regarding the latter
finding, our results show that defining one large face-selective
region on the FG—perhaps due to a less stringent contrast (e.g.,
faces > places) and/or a weak statistical threshold (e.g., t > 2)—
as a single area (e.g., the FFA) would result in a functional
region consisting of 2 distinct cytoarchitectonic components.
As cytoarchitectonic differences are used to parcellate brain
areas (Campbell 1905; Smith 1907; Brodmann 1909; Hubel and
Wiesel 1977; Van Essen 2003), these findings provide strong,
microanatomical evidence to separate these functional regions
in human VTC.
Notably, we also find evidence for cytoarchitectonic similar-
ities among regions processing information from different
domains. Specifically, 1) cytoarchitectonically defined area FG4
contains 3 different domain-specific regions selective for faces,
bodies, and characters and 2) cytoarchitectonically defined FG2
contains 2 different domain-specific regions selective for faces
and characters. This finding of a common cellular architecture
among regions processing stimuli from different domains sug-
gests the possibility that these functional regions share a com-
mon computational need that is implemented by a common
cytoarchitecture (we discuss this hypothesis in detail in the
next section). Alternatively, while the cytoarchitecture of differ-
ent domain-specific regions (e.g., for faces and characters) may
be common, there may be differences in other micron-level fea-
tures, such as connectivity among neurons (Reckfort et al. 2015)
and/or receptor architectonics (Caspers et al. 2015), which are
undetected by the present method and may give rise to specia-
lized
neural
circuitry
for
processing
stimuli
of
particular
domains. These possibilities can be tested in future research.
We recognize that a limitation of the present study is that
individual fROIs are compared to probabilistic locations of cROIs
and
probabilistic
fROIs
are
compared
to
individual
cROIs.
Nevertheless, currently there is no method that enables cyto-
architectonic analyses in vivo. Further, prior studies relating
cROIs and fROIs in human VTC were conducted at the group level
(Van Essen et al. 2012; Abdollahi et al. 2014; Caspers et al. 2014).
Thus, our approach quantifying the correspondence between
MPM cROIs and fROIs in individual participants, and back-
projecting MPM fROIs to individual 3D-reconstructed histological
sections provides the most accurate method to date relating the
functional and cytoarchitectonic organization of human VTC.
A New Hypothesis: Two Computational Axes in
Human VTC
These findings illustrate that cytoarchitectonic and functional
organizational features of human VTC correspond to 2 dimen-
sions on the cortical sheet (Fig. 10). The first is a lateral–medial
axis that differentiates regions across domains. The second is
an anterior–posterior axis that distinguishes regions within a
domain.
We propose that the lateral–medial axis is an axis of special-
ization (Grill-Spector and Malach 2004). The physical segregation
of regions from different domains may enable efficient parallel
processing of domain-specific information either 1) within separ-
ate cytoarchitectonic areas (e.g., face information in FG4 and
place information in FG3) or 2) within the same cytoarchitectonic
area (e.g., character, body, and face information on a lateral–
medial gradient within FG4). The former supports the theory
that domain-specific regions that are cytoarchitectonically dis-
tinct perform different computations. The latter suggests a new
theory that domain-specific regions can be cytoarchitectonically
similar and consequently computationally related. For example,
throughout the visual system, anatomical properties of cells cod-
ing foveal stimuli differ from those coding peripheral stimuli
(Kennedy et al. 1986; Curcio and Allen 1990; Dacey and Petersen
1992). Evidence indicates that this segregation perpetuates into
high-level regions: CoS-places/PPA associated with FG3 shows a
peripheral bias (Levy et al. 2001), while face- (Kay et al. 2015),
word- (Hasson et al. 2002), and body-selective (Weiner and Grill-
Spector 2011) regions associated with FG4 show a foveal bias.
Thus, the cytoarchitectonic differences separating face- from
place-selective regions may reflect different anatomical substrates
supporting foveal and peripheral computations, respectively,

integration across domains. A summary of the relationship between cROIs

 while the cytoarchitectonic similarities shared between face-,
body-, and character-selective regions in FG4 may reflect
similar anatomical substrates supporting foveal computations.
Cytoarchitectonic differences between lateral and medial VTC
may underlie additional computational differences that have
been observed along a lateral–medial axis in VTC (Grill-Spector
and Weiner 2014) including (but not limited to) differences in
temporal dynamics (Gilaie-Dotan et al. 2008) adaptation proper-
ties (Weiner et al. 2010) as well as preferences to rectilinear ver-
sus curvilinear visual features (Nasr et al. 2014).
We also propose that the anterior–posterior axis is asso-
ciated with computational transformations (Grill-Spector and
Malach 2004), which enable a behaviorally relevant representa-
tion to be achieved through a series of sequential computations
across a cortical hierarchy (DiCarlo and Cox 2007). A hallmark
of hierarchical processing is a progressive increase in popula-
tion receptive field size (pRF; Wandell and Winawer 2015).
Accumulating evidence suggests that face-selective regions
constitute a functional hierarchy (Kravitz et al. 2013; Kay et al.
2015; Silson et al. 2015), whereby pRFs become progressively
larger and more foveal (Kay et al. 2015). Therefore, we postulate
that differences in cytoarchitectonics along the anterior–pos-
terior axis reflect computational transformations linked to
pRFs: regions within the same cytoarchitectonic area may have
similar pRF properties irrespective of domain (e.g., mFus-faces/
FFA-2 and mOTS-chars/VWFA-2), while regions located in sep-
arate cytoarchitectonic areas may have different pRF properties
within-domain (e.g., pFus-faces/FFA-1 and mFus-faces/FFA-2).
In this model, the different histological properties reflected
along the posterior–anterior hierarchical axis reflect dedicated
microanatomical hardware optimized for particular computa-
tional transformations such as position and size, which can be
tested in future research.
Conclusion
These discoveries link the organization of domain-specific
functional regions to the cellular heterogeneity of human VTC.
Our findings integrate macroscopic functional properties and
microscopic anatomical properties and show that functional
and cytoarchitectonic organizational features vary along 2 cor-
tical axes, which may reflect 2 computational axes within high-
level visual cortex.
