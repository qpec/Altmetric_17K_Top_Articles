Objective.—To assess the rates and predictors of traversing steps essential to good medical care for chronic migraine,
including: (1) medical consultation, (2) accurate diagnosis, and (3) minimal pharmacologic treatment. Candidate predictors
included socioeconomic, demographic, and headache-specific variables.
Background.—Previous research has established that barriers to effective management for episodic migraine include
the absence of health insurance, lack of appropriate medical consultation, failure to receive an accurate diagnosis, and not
being offered a regimen with acute and preventive treatments.
Methods/Design.—The Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study, a longitudinal web-based
panel study of migraine, included a cross-sectional module focused on patterns of and barriers to medical care. Participants
eligible for this analysis met the study criteria for chronic migraine, had evidence of headache-related disability, and pro-
vided data on health insurance status. The main outcomes in the current analysis included the proportion of respondents
who sought consultation for headache with a designated healthcare professional, self-reported receiving a diagnosis of
chronic or transformed migraine, and received minimal pharmacologic treatment for headache with a focus on prescribed
acute and preventive treatments.
Results.—In the CaMEO Study, 80,783 respondents provided study data, 16,789 (20.8% of respondents) met criteria
for migraine, and 1476 (8.8% of those with migraine) met chronic migraine criteria. In total, 1254 participants (85.0% of
those with chronic migraine) met inclusion criteria for this analysis. Of those, 512 respondents (40.8%) reported currently
consulting with a healthcare professional for headache. Odds of consulting increased with increasing age (OR 1.02; 95% CI
1.01–1.03), body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00–1.03), migraine-related disability (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00–1.04),
and migraine severity (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.11–1.22) and presence of health insurance (OR 4.61; 95% CI 3.05–6.96). Among
those consulting a healthcare professional, 126 (24.6%) received an accurate diagnosis and 56 of those with a correct diag-
nosis (44.4%) received both acute and preventive pharmacologic treatments; odds of a CM diagnosis were higher for
women (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.03–3.61), those with greater migraine severity (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14–1.37), and those cur-
rently consulting a specialist (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.54–3.69). No predictors of receiving appropriate treatment were identified

 among those currently consulting. Among our sample of people with chronic migraine, only 56 (4.5%) individuals success-
fully traversed the series of 3 barriers to successful chronic migraine care (ie, consulted a healthcare professional for
migraine, received an accurate diagnosis, and were prescribed minimal acute and preventive pharmacologic treatments).
Conclusion.—Our findings suggest that <5% of persons with chronic migraine traversed 3 barriers to receiving care for
headache (consultation, diagnosis, and treatment), representing a large unmet need for improving care in this population.
Predictors of consulting a healthcare professional included age, having health insurance, greater migraine-related disability,
and greater migraine symptom severity. Among those consulting, predictors of an appropriate diagnosis included consulting
a specialist, female sex, and greater migraine severity. Public health efforts are needed to improve outcomes for patients
with chronic migraine by a range of interventions and educational efforts aimed at improving consultation rates, diagnostic
accuracy, and adherence to minimal pharmacologic treatment.

 BACKGROUND
Migraine
is
a
chronic
neurological
disorder
broadly classified into episodic migraine (EM) and
chronic migraine (CM) based on the monthly number
of headache days.1–3 EM is characterized by migraine
with headache attacks that occur <15 days per month,
whereas CM is generally characterized by �15 head-
ache days per month with migrainous features �8 days
per month.1 Within the US migraine population, the
majority (93.3%) are classified as having EM, but those
who have CM (7.7%)4 are recognized as the segment
suffering most from the disorder. Supported by clinical
experience, data have demonstrated that compared
with people with EM, those with CM experience sub-
stantially greater headache impact on daily activities,5,6
higher direct medical costs,7–9 greater healthcare
resource utilization,5 reduced health-related quality of
life,5,10 and higher rates of comorbidities.11,12
In both the EM and CM populations, migraine
attacks are frequently unpredictable and disabling.
Since migraine-specific treatments are available only
by prescription in the US, management requires phy-
sician or other prescribing healthcare professional
(HCP) direction. Good care for migraine, particularly
CM, requires that a person seeks care, obtains a diag-
nosis to gain an understanding of their disorder, and
receives an individualized treatment plan that con-
sists of FDA- and guideline-appropriate acute and
preventive
treatment
(including
pharmacologic,
behavioral,
and/or
interventional
treatments)
approaches. Furthermore, poorly optimized treat-
ment is associated with an increased risk of transfor-
mation from EM to CM.13 Previous research has
established that barriers to effective migraine man-
agement include male sex, lack of health insurance,
lack of appropriate medical consultation, failure to
receive an accurate diagnosis, and not being offered a
minimal pharmacologic treatment regimen.14–16 An
analysis from the American Migraine Prevalence and
Prevention (AMPP) Study determined the propor-
tion of the population with EM that overcame all 3
established barriers to reach minimal pharmacologic
management was low (26.3%),15 but that analysis did
not explore barriers among people with CM. The
AMPP Study showed that the majority of individuals
with CM had not received a correct diagnosis (79.8%)
nor specific acute (68.4%) or preventive (60.0%)
medications. These data suggest that most patients
with CM are not crossing the 3-step series of barriers
and thus are not effectively managed.4,17
Developed from key learnings from the AMPP
Study, the Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Out-
comes (CaMEO) Study collected cross-sectional and
longitudinal epidemiologic data using multiple web-
based survey modules. The objectives of this study
were to assess the rates and predictors of traversing
a series of 3 steps judged to be essential to good
care: (1) medical consultation, (2) accurate diagnosis,
and
(3)
a
minimal
pharmacologic
strategy
that
includes acute and preventive treatments. We also
sought to identify socioeconomic, demographic, and
headache-specific variables associated with each step.
METHODS
Study Design.—The CaMEO Study design and
methodology have been reported in detail elsewhere.18
Briefly, the CaMEO Study was conducted over 15
months (September 2012–November 2013), and was
approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
Institutional Review Board. The CaMEO Study
employed unique cross-sectional modules embedded
in a longitudinal design and assessed headache fre-
quency, headache severity and symptoms, headache-
related disability, healthcare utilization for headache,
headache medication use, comorbid health problems,
and family-related burden associated with migraine.
During the first (ie, baseline) of 3 stages in CaMEO,
respondents completed the Screening, Core, and Bar-
riers to Care modules, one immediately after the other.
The current analysis details the results from the Bar-
riers to Care Module in the population within CaMEO
that met the study criteria for CM.
Study Population.—Participants with migraine were
identified from a web-based panel (Research Now,
Plano, TX, USA), which has 2.4 million members nation-
wide, and has a demographic composition broadly similar
to that of the US population.19 A total of 489,537 persons
in the panel were invited to participate, 80,783 (16.5% of
invitees) responded to baseline modules (Screening,
Core, and Barriers to Care modules), and 58,418 pro-
vided valid returns (11.9% of invitees) (Fig. 1).
Headache
823
 The American Migraine Study (AMS)/AMPP
diagnostic module was employed to obtain lifetime
recall of migraine symptoms associated with the
respondents’ most severe headache (eg, unilateral,
pulsating, moderate/severe pain intensity, routine
activity exacerbation of headache pain, nausea,
phonophobia, photophobia). Participants included
in the analysis met AMS/AMPP diagnostic module
criteria for migraine.20,21 This was a modification of
the International Classification of Headache Disor-
ders, 3rd edition, beta version (ICHD-3b) migraine
criteria.1 The diagnostic module did not assess
whether there were �5 lifetime migraine events
(criterion A) and if the duration of an untreated
attack was from 4 to 72 hours (criterion B). CM
classification was derived from Silberstein–Lipton
criteria22,23 and ICHD-3b criteria for CM. CM
respondents were defined as those with �15 head-
ache days per month averaged over the past 3
months, but did not include assessment of ICHD-
3b CM criterion C (ie, �8 days per month fulfilled
migraine criteria), because it is difficult to evaluate
in a large, self-report data-collection paradigm and
requires the use of a diary and physician interview
to accurately determine. The diagnostic module
employed in this study has been demonstrated to
have a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 82%
for the diagnosis of migraine,24 and sensitivity of
91% and specificity of 80% for the diagnosis of
CM25
based
on
modified
ICHD-2
criteria.

Fig. 1.—Defining the analysis sample. In the CaMEO Study, a total of 16,789 respondents met the study criteria and comprised the
migraine sample. Of these, 1476 were classified as having chronic migraine per the CaMEO Study criteria. From the 1476 respondents
classified as having chronic migraine, 1273 had chronic migraine and a MIDAS grade 2, 3, or 4, indicating that these subjects experienced
substantial disability caused by their migraines. Because health insurance coverage is an important predictor of consultation, we
restricted the sample to those who provided information on health insurance status (yes or no to having health insurance); thus our final
sample included 1254 respondents who met the study criteria for chronic migraine, had a MIDAS grade �2, and reported insurance sta-
tus. *N522,365 respondents either (1) abandoned the survey, (2) were over-quota, or (3) had invalid (unusable) data and were removed
during data cleaning. †Met Inclusion Criteria: Agreed to participate, screened positive for modified ICHD-3b migraine, were �18 years

 significant changes occurred between ICHD-2 and
ICHD-3b that are related to the criteria used in this
study. Inclusion criteria required active panel mem-
bership, age �18 years, meeting modified ICHD-3b
migraine symptom criteria, and �1 headache within
the past 12 months. A total of 16,789 respondents
(3.4% of invitees) met inclusion criteria and comprise
the CaMEO Study sample, of whom 1476 respond-
ents met the criteria for CM (8.8%) and 15,313 met
the criteria for EM (91.2%). The current analysis
from the Barriers to Care Module included only those
respondents who (1) met study criteria for CM, (2)
reported mild or greater headache-related disability
(Migraine Disability Assessment Scale [MIDAS] dis-
ability grade �2, score �6) and (3) provided informa-
tion regarding their health insurance status (Fig. 1).
Barriers to Care Cross-Sectional Module.—The
CaMEO Study modules included validated instru-
ments as well as pertinent survey questions devel-
oped based on the results of focus groups, expert
opinion, item analysis, and preliminary survey trials.
The Barriers to Care Module was based on the
AMPP Study barriers to care items and analysis.15
This baseline module had a total of 65 questions that
were generally divided into knowledge about head-
ache and medical care and consulting behavior. The
CaMEO
Study
was
a
web-based
survey,
which
allowed branching logic to direct respondents to
appropriate questions based on their responses.
Questions
were
divided
into
domains
that
included: accuracy of diagnosis among those cur-
rently consulting any HCP; satisfaction with current
treatments; and resources, awareness, outlook, and
behaviors that possibly contributed to the lack of
medical
consultation
among
migraineurs.
For
respondents currently consulting an HCP and diag-
nosed with migraine, the survey investigated the
motivation and modes of healthcare consultation,
accuracy of diagnosis, and medications prescribed
(both acute and preventive). Nonconsulters and
lapsed consulters answered questions about their
motivation for discontinuing or never seeking treat-
ment, and about their headache-related healthcare
experiences. The median duration for a participant
to complete this module was 20 minutes.
Outcomes.—The main outcomes in the current anal-
ysis included the proportion of respondents who trav-
ersed each barrier to care, including: (1) number of
respondents with CM who sought consultation for
headache with a prescribing HCP, as defined by a list of
providers; (2) number of respondents with CM who
self-reported receiving a diagnosis of CM or trans-
formed migraine (TM; subsequently referred to as
CM) from an HCP; and (3) number of respondents
with CM receiving minimal pharmacologic treatment,
which was defined as acute and preventive pharmaco-
logic treatments supported by the best empirical and
clinical data available, including guideline recommen-
dations and supporting literature. Inclusion for each
step was limited to those who had fulfilled the previous
step, so consideration for current treatment was
restricted to those who had traversed the consulting
barrier and had received the correct diagnosis of CM.
Consulting Healthcare Professional.—The CaMEO
definition of “consulting HCP” was modeled after the
definition used previously for the AMPP Study on
barriers to care in EM.15 In the current analysis, con-
sulting HCPs for the diagnosis and treatment of
migraine were defined as primary-care HCPs (ie, gen-
eral practitioners, family physicians, internal medi-
cine
specialists,
nurse
practitioners,
physicians’
assistants, obstetricians/gynecologists) or specialists
(ie, neurologists, pain specialist physicians, headache
specialist
physicians).
“Consulters”
were
those
respondents reporting headache management with
one of the HCPs listed above and “nonconsulters”
were respondents not currently consulting any of the
categories of HCP defined above.
Chronic Migraine Diagnosis.—In the current analysis
of the CM population, the respondent was asked to
self-report whether they had received a medical diag-
nosis of CM or TM from the HCP they were consulting
for management and treatment of their migraine head-
aches; if they reported receiving a diagnosis of CM or
TM, they were categorized as correctly diagnosed.
Minimal Pharmacologic Treatment.—Respondents
were asked about their current use of prescription
acute and preventive medications for headache.
Acute treatment for headache/migraine was based
on the previously published AMPP Study criteria
utilized for the EM barriers to care assessment to
Headache
825
 assess potentially differing trends between EM and
CM.15 Acute treatment for headache/migraine was
considered present if the respondent reported using
a prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID), triptan, or isometheptene (Midrin). Pre-
ventive
medication
was
deemed
in
use
if
the
respondent reported using a prescribed antidepres-
sant medication, antiseizure medication, or blood
pressure or heart medication to prevent or reduce
the occurrence of their headaches/migraine attacks;
additional treatments considered as prescribed pre-
ventives included treatments specific to migraine
prevention, such as onabotulinumtoxinA and inter-
ventional medicine treatments such as nerve blocks,
or trigger point injections. In summary, minimal
pharmacologic treatment for CM was defined as
current use of both prescribed acute and preventive
treatments.
Sociodemographic Variables, Headache Characteristics,
and Psychiatric Comorbidities.—The baseline CaMEO
modules assessed symptoms, headache-related dis-
ability, and psychiatric comorbidities. Data from
these assessments were used in the current analysis
to determine predictors of consulting, diagnosis,
and treatment among those with CM, MIDAS
grade �2, and reported health insurance status.
Sociodemographic data were obtained via self-
report, and included sex, age, current employment
status, body mass index (BMI; calculated using the
standard algorithm taken from self-reported height
and weight measures), annual household income,
and health insurance status (ie, having health insur-
ance or not).
Headache
Symptoms.—The
Migraine
Symptom
Severity Score (MSSS) is a composite score that
computes headache severity through the summed
responses to questions ascertaining the prevalence
of the 7 ICHD-3b criteria symptoms associated
with
a
respondent’s
“most
severe
headaches.”
These symptoms are: (1) unilateral pain; (2) pound-
ing, pulsating or throbbing pain; (3) moderate-to-
severe pain intensity; (4) pain made worse by rou-
tine activities; (5) nausea; (6) photophobia; and (7)
phonophobia. Response values span from “1” (ie,
never) to “4” (ie, half the time or more) producing
a total score ranging from 7 to 28.15 The MSSS has
been used frequently in AMPP Study analyses,
although it is not a validated assessment.15
Headache-Related Disability.—Headache-related
dis-
ability was measured using the MIDAS, a 5-item,
self-administered questionnaire that evaluates days
of missed activity or markedly reduced activity
caused by headache in the preceding 3 months in 3
areas: school work/paid employment, household
work/chores, and nonwork (ie, family, social, lei-
sure) activities.26,27 Responses were summed to a
total score that fell into 4 categories: Grade 1: little
to no disability (score 0–5); Grade 2: mild disability
(score 6–10); Grade 3: moderate disability (score
11–20); and Grade 4: severe disability (score 21–
270). MIDAS grades were used to characterize the
respondent population in the current analysis and
MIDAS scores were included in the logistic model-
ing to assess predictors of care.
Depression
and
Anxiety.—Levels
of
depression
were determined using the PRIME-MDV
R Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a validated mea-
sure of major depressive disorder based on Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria, which scores 9 ques-
tions from “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day)
for
depressive
symptoms
over
the
previous
2
weeks.28,29 PHQ-9 scores �10 indicate moderate to
severe depression (severe score, 20–27). Respond-
ents with a cumulative score �10 were classified
with major depression for the current analysis.
Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the
validated
Generalized
Anxiety
Disorder
scale
(GAD-7), which scores 7 questions from “0” (ie,
not at all) to “3” (ie, nearly every day) for the pre-
vious 2 weeks, for a total severity score ranging
from 0 to 21 (moderate: 10–14; severe: 15–21).30–32
Respondents with a cumulative score �10 were
classified as having generalized anxiety disorder.
Both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were included in
the logistic models.
Consulting a Specialist With Expertise in Headache.—-
Currently consulting a specialist was a covariate
used to adjust for type of HCP that currently man-
ages respondent’s headaches. It was defined using a
single survey item and was considered present if
the
respondent
indicated
that
a
specialist
(ie,
826
May 2016
 neurologist, headache specialist physician, or pain
specialist physician) was currently managing or
treating their headaches.
Statistical Methods.—Both univariate and multi-
variable models were constructed for current con-
sulting
status,
diagnostic
status
among
current
consulters, and diagnosed current consulters who
received appropriate treatment. In the univariate
analysis, binary outcomes (eg, sex, employment sta-
tus, health insurance status, meeting criteria for
depression or generalized anxiety disorder, consul-
tation with an HCP) were modeled using binary
logistic regression and reported as odds ratios (OR;
95% confidence interval [CI]). The mean difference
in age and MSSS were compared using a 2-sample
t-test with equal variances and reported as mean
difference and 95% CI. The distribution of MIDAS
most resembled a negative binomial distribution
and therefore was modeled using a negative bino-
mial regression and reported as rate ratios (RR;
95%
CI).
Income
was
divided
into
sequential
ordered
categories
and
modeled
using
ordinal
regression and reported cumulative ORs. In addi-
tion,
multivariable
binary
logistic
models
were
developed for assessing predictors of consulting an
HCP for headache, predictors of receiving a CM/
TM diagnosis, and predictors of receiving minimal
acute and preventive pharmacologic treatment. P
values �.05 were considered significant for all sta-
tistical tests and models. All analyses were con-
ducted with SPSS Statistics, version 22.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS
Analysis Sample.—The
baseline
stage
of
the
CaMEO Study was initiated during the third quar-
ter of 2012 and completed between September 17
and October 30, 2012. Among 80,783 respondents
who provided study data, 16,789 met criteria for
migraine. Of the respondents who completed the
Screening, Core, and Barriers to Care modules,
1476 met the criteria for CM (8.8%) and 15,313
met the criteria for EM (91.2%). Of the 1476 who
met CM criteria, 1273 had MIDAS grade �2, and
1254 of those also responded to questions about
their health insurance status (possessing or not and
type) (Fig. 1). The 1254 chronic migraineurs with
MIDAS grade �2 and reporting insurance data
(85% of those with CM) comprised the eligible
sample for the analyses presented herein.
Fig. 2.—Defining respondents who traverse all 3 barriers to care. Minimal pharmacologic treatment for persons with chronic
migraine may be achieved if they traverse a 3-step series of barriers to care defined as: (1) seeking care from a healthcare pro-
fessional (current consulters); (2) receiving a diagnosis of chronic migraine or transformed migraine from a healthcare profes-
sional; and (3) using minimal pharmacologic treatment, which in this analysis included both acute and preventive therapies.

 Barriers to Achieving Appropriate Treatment.—Figure 2
summarizes the respondents that traversed each
step in the path leading to minimal acute and pre-
ventive pharmacologic treatment for CM. Of the
1254 respondents with CM eligible for analysis, 512
(40.8%) reported currently consulting with an HCP
for
headache.
Among
current
consulters,
126
(24.6%) received a diagnosis of CM/TM and 56
(44.4%) of those with a correct diagnosis received
both a prescribed acute and preventive treatment.
In aggregate, among people with CM and MIDAS
disability grade �2, only 56 (4.5%) successfully
traversed all 3 barriers (ie, consulted an HCP for
headache, received a CM diagnosis, and reported
receiving
prescribed
acute
and
preventive
treatments).

Differences
for
Consulting,
Diagnosis,
and
Treatment.—Current
Consulters vs Nonconsulters.—Table 1 compares
and contrasts those who did and did not consult an
HCP for headache management. Those who con-
sulted were older by almost 4 years on average
(42.8 years vs 38.9 years; mean difference 3.9, 95%
CI 2.37–5.37), were more likely to have health
insurance (93.6% vs 77.6%; OR 4.18, 95% CI 2.82–
6.20), had a mean MIDAS score that was 21%
higher (77.7 vs 64.3; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08–1.35),
and had a mean MSSS that was 1 point higher
(24.7 vs 23.7; mean difference 1.03, 95% CI 0.71–
1.35). No significant differences were found for sex,
employment status, BMI, household income, or
rates of depression/anxiety.
Diagnosis
of
CM
and
Minimal
Pharmacologic
Treatment.—Among
current
consulters,
24.6%
reported a clinical diagnosis of CM/TM. Those
with a self-reported physician diagnosis of CM/
TM were less likely to be fully employed (43.7%
vs 56.7%; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39–0.89), had a
mean MIDAS score 22% higher (90.2 vs 73.7; RR
1.22, 95% CI 1.00–1.50) and mean MSSS about
1.5 points higher (25.9 vs 24.3; mean difference
1.53, 95% CI 0.98–2.08), and were about 1.5 times
more likely to report currently consulting a spe-
cialist for their headaches (54.0% vs 31.6%; OR
2.54, 95% CI 1.68–3.83). No differences were
found between those diagnosed vs not diagnosed
with CM for sex, employment status, BMI, house-
hold
income,
or
rates
of
depression/anxiety.
Among those consulting an HCP and diagnosed
with CM, 44.4% received acute and preventive
treatment. There were no significant differences
between those who were given minimal pharmaco-
logic treatment vs not given minimal pharmaco-
logic treatment.
Multivariable
Logistic
Models
for
Current
Consulting,

and
Receiving
Minimal
Pharmacologic
Treatment.—Using
multivariable
logistic regression, we modeled characteristics asso-
ciated with (1) consulting behavior, (2) diagnosis
among consulters, and (3) treatment with pre-
scribed acute and preventive treatment use among
diagnosed consulters (Table 2).
Predictors of Consulting an HCP for Headache.—For
each 1-year increase in age, medical consulting for
headache increased 2% (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01–
1.03). For each unit increase in BMI, consulting
increased 1% (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00–1.03). Those
possessing insurance were about 4.6 times as likely
to consult (OR 4.61; 95% CI 3.05–6.96). A 10-point
increase in mean MIDAS disability scores was asso-
ciated with a 2% increase in consultation (OR 1.02;
95% CI 1.00–1.04). A 1-point mean increase in
MSSS was associated with 16% increase in consult-
ing (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.11–1.22).
Predictors of Appropriate Diagnosis.—Among those
with CM consulting HCPs for headache, in compar-
ison with men, women were almost twice as likely
to receive a CM diagnosis (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.03–
3.61). A 1-point mean increase in MSSS was associ-
ated with a 25% increase in odds of getting CM
diagnosis (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14–1.37). Those cur-
rently consulting a specialist were nearly 1.5 times
more likely to receive CM diagnoses (OR 2.38;
95% CI 1.54–3.69) than those consulting other
HCPs.
Predictors of Receiving Prescribed Acute and Pre-
ventive Treatment.—Among those with CM consult-
ing
HCPs
for
headache
and
who
received
a
diagnosis, none of the variables used as predictors
in
this
study
was
significantly
associated
with
increased odds of receiving minimal acute and pre-
ventive pharmacologic treatment.

 DISCUSSION
In this report, we identified people with CM and
unmet
medical
needs
based
on
disability
and
assessed 3 levels of healthcare seeking and delivery,
focusing on consultation, diagnosis, and treatment.
Just 41% of eligible respondents with CM were cur-
rently consulting an HCP regarding their headaches.
Among consulters, only 25% reported receiving an
accurate diagnosis of CM or TM. Among the diag-
nosed, 44% reported receiving both acute and pre-
ventive
pharmacologic
treatments.
Thus,
the
percentage of individuals with CM traversing all 3
barriers is 4.5%, the product of success at each step
(0.41 3 0.25 3 0.44 3 100). This approach has not
been applied to medical care for CM.
In a previous study using similar methodology
we found that 26.3% of people with EM and unmet
medical needs successfully traversed all 3 barriers
to migraine care.15 In contrasting the studies, we
found that consultation rates were lower for people
with CM (41%) than EM (46%). Diagnostic rates
among consulters were also lower for those with
CM (25%) than EM (87%). Finally, treatment rates
among the diagnosed were also lower for those
with CM (44%) than EM (67%).
In the present report, we examined predictors of
accomplishing each step in the initial process leading
to better treatment. The odds of consulting among
those with CM increased with age and BMI as well
as with greater levels of headache-related disability
and symptom severity. Availability of health insur-
ance was also a very powerful predictor of consult-
ing. In the study of barriers to EM care, predictors of
consulting were similar and included indicators of
migraine severity (ie, MIDAS score, MSSS) and hav-
ing health insurance.15 These findings indicate that
seeking healthcare for migraine is determined in part
by treatment needs, as indexed by measures of head-
ache severity, and in part by access to care, as indi-
cated by health insurance status. According to the
US Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 72.2% of out-
patient visits for migraine take place in primary care
settings.33
Efforts
to
improve
consultation
for
migraine are therefore best directed to primary care
settings. People with disabling headache should be
encouraged to discuss their headaches with their doc-
tors, and primary care providers should be encour-
aged to evaluate their patients for migraine and CM.
For diagnosis of CM among those consulting,
the odds of correct diagnosis were greater for

 women, those with severe symptoms, and those
consulting a specialist. Rates of diagnosis among
consulters were far lower for CM (25%) than for
EM (87%).15 This difference suggests an unmet
need for better CM diagnosis, particularly in pri-
mary care settings. Barriers associated with diagno-
sis may be addressed by encouraging HCPs to use
screening tools for migraine and CM, such as the
Identify (ID)-Migraine34 and ID-Chronic Migraine
(ID-CM).35
Rates
of
minimal
pharmacologic
treatment
were greatly reduced in people diagnosed with CM
(44%) compared with EM (67%).15 For CM, we
required both acute and preventive medications,
whereas only acute medication for migraine was
required for EM.15 These requirements were based
on the observation that most people with EM in
the community do not meet criteria for preventive
treatment,37
while
virtually
everyone
with
CM
requires prevention. Although, we were unable to
identify statistically significant predictors of effec-
tive
treatment,
this
remains
a
crucial
barrier.
Healthcare
professionals
should
aim
to
better
understand and implement evidence-based guide-
lines for optimal acute and preventive care of CM.
Of note, the magnitude of effect cannot be
interpreted without examining the structure of the
variable
used
to
compute
test
statistic;
thus,
although reported ORs may have been small, they
represent an incremental change in the scale of
interest (eg, a 1-point change in MIDAS [range 0–
270]).
People with CM, by virtue of headache-day fre-
quency, report high levels of interference in activ-
ities of normal life, including the ability to work,
perform routine chores, and build and maintain
functional family, social, and community relation-
ships.17 Preventive treatment regimens are often
critical to ensuring optimal patient outcomes. The
goals of migraine preventive therapies include: (1)
reduction in attack frequency, severity, and dura-
tion; (2) improved responsiveness to acute treat-
ments;
(3)
decreasing
disability
and
improving
overall function; (4) preventing analgesic overuse
and “transformation” to chronic daily headache;
and (5) reduction of overall cost of treatment.4,37
This study has both strengths and limitations.
We assigned diagnoses of CM and EM based on
validated self-reported measures, without access to
medical assessments. Similarly, patterns of consulta-
tion, diagnosis, and treatment were based on self-
report without verification by medical claims and
pharmacy data. However, this approach is common
in large-scale epidemiologic studies.38,39 In addition,
it is not possible to use medical claims and phar-
macy data to assess people who remain undiag-
nosed and untreated. If diagnosis is unreported,
diagnosis may not have been effectively communi-
cated. Given these inherent limitations, we used
validated
and
widely
used
diagnostic
tools.24,25
Some of our instruments, particularly those that
examined patterns of consultation, diagnosis, and
treatment, were not validated, although they had a
high level of face validity. The items were also con-
sistent with previous analyses examining barriers to
EM care15 and the direction and magnitude of
effect in this CM study were consistent with what
would be expected for a more severe headache
population.
To conduct this study, we made judgments
about types of HCP providing ongoing medical
care for CM. Of the 1254 respondents with MIDAS
grade �2 and reporting health insurance status, 28
reported
consulting
with
a
type
of
HCP
not
included as an eligible provider for this study (eg,
allergist; ear, nose, and throat specialist; emergency
department; urgent care department; psychiatrist).
For example, we judged that emergency depart-
ment consultations represented one-time evalua-
tions
and
not
ongoing
treatment.
Reasonable
clinicians
might disagree
with these judgments,
although the effect was likely small. We acknowl-
edge that among these specialties, there may be
highly qualified headache specialists. Four of these
28 individuals who consulted ineligible providers
received a CM diagnosis and only one received
minimal pharmacologic treatment. In this analysis
of people with CM, we required preventive treat-
ment as part of minimal pharmacologic treatment,
while only acute treatments were required in the
EM analysis. We also did not consider over-the-
counter medications as part of our definition for
Headache
831
 minimal pharmacologic treatment because these
medications may not be sufficient for patients with
persistent
disability,
although
they
may
be
an
appropriate choice for some patients.
In addition, we treated consultation, diagnosis,
and treatment as cascade events. We used this con-
ditional analytic strategy for 2 reasons: (1) we
wanted to separately assess the predictors of each
step among those who had traversed the previous
step, and (2) effective treatment of CM requires an
accurate diagnosis as a prerequisite to patient edu-
cation and behavioral interventions. Nevertheless,
people who never received or reported a diagnosis
of CM might still receive minimal pharmacologic
treatment, and were not captured in this analysis.
Some limitations were imposed by sample size.
Power was limited to identify predictors of minimal
pharmacologic treatment. We could not separately
examine the influence of HCP type on diagnosis and
treatment. In addition, our analyses were not pow-
ered to provide statistical comparisons and multiple
comparisons were analyzed, which under certain cir-
cumstances can increase the likelihood of statistical
significance being attributed to chance outcomes.40
A strength of this study is its large, systemati-
cally recruited sample. In addition, these results may
be generalizable to the US migraine population, as a
comparison of CaMEO and AMPP Study data
yielded
similar
demographic
characteristics,
headache-day frequency, and headache-related dis-
ability among the respondents, despite methodologic
differences.18,41 This study also assigned migraine
diagnosis based on a validated diagnostic module
utilizing modified ICHD-3b criteria, and used vali-
dated instruments to assess headache-related disabil-
ity, depression, and anxiety. Finally this analysis was
able to adjust for multiple confounders.18,41
An important next step toward developing tar-
geted migraine education for both patients and
HCPs (thus reducing the consultation barriers) is to
gain additional understanding of the knowledge and
motivations of patients for seeking care for their
headache disorder and to understand patient satisfac-
tion with care and expectations for treatment among
those with EM and CM. The AMPP Study looked
beyond the current barriers and also identified dissat-
isfaction with current acute treatment options and
care to better understand unmet need within the EM
population and found that among those with �1
unmet need, 37.4% were dissatisfied with their acute
treatment regimen.42 Similar analyses are needed to
understand treatment satisfaction among people with
CM to improve understanding of motivations for
consultation
and
expectations
for
management
among people with migraine. These issues can be
explored in future analyses of the CaMEO data.
