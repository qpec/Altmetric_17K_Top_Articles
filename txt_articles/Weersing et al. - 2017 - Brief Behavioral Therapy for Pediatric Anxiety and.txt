IMPORTANCE Anxiety and depression affect 30% of youth but are markedly undertreated
compared with other mental disorders, especially in Hispanic populations.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether a pediatrics-based behavioral intervention targeting anxiety
and depression improves clinical outcome compared with referral to outpatient community
mental health care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 2-center randomized clinical trial with masked
outcome assessment conducted between brief behavioral therapy (BBT) and assisted referral
to care (ARC) studied 185 youths (aged 8.0-16.9 years) from 9 pediatric clinics in San Diego,
California, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, recruited from October 6, 2010, through December
5, 2014. Youths who met DSM-IV criteria for full or probable diagnoses of separation anxiety
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, major depression, dysthymic disorder,
and/or minor depression; lived with a consenting legal guardian for at least 6 months; and
spoke English were included in the study. Exclusions included receipt of alternate treatment
for anxiety or depression, presence of a suicidal plan, bipolar disorder, psychosis,
posttraumatic stress disorder, substance dependence, current abuse, intellectual disability, or
unstable serious physical illness.
INTERVENTIONS The BBT consisted of 8 to 12 weekly 45-minute sessions of behavioral
therapy delivered in pediatric clinics by master’s-level clinicians. The ARC families received
personalized referrals to mental health care and check-in calls to support accessing care from
master’s-level coordinators.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was clinically significant
improvement on the Clinical Global Impression–Improvement scale (score �2). Secondary
outcomes included the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, Children's Depression Rating
Scale–Revised, and functioning.
RESULTS A total of 185 patients were enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [2.6] years;
107 [57.8%] female; 144 [77.8%] white; and 38 [20.7%] Hispanic). Youths in the BBT group
(n = 95), compared with those in the ARC group (n = 90), had significantly higher rates of
clinical improvement (56.8% vs 28.2%; χ2
1 = 13.09, P < .001; number needed to treat, 4),
greater reductions in symptoms (F2,146 = 5.72; P = .004; Cohen f = 0.28), and better
functioning (mean [SD], 68.5 [10.7] vs 61.9 [11.9]; t156 = 3.64; P < .001; Cohen d = 0.58).
Ethnicity moderated outcomes, with Hispanic youth having substantially stronger response
to BBT (76.5%) than ARC (7.1%) (χ2
1 = 14.90; P < .001; number needed to treat, 2). Effects
were robust across sites.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A pediatric-based brief behavioral intervention for anxiety
and depression is associated with benefits superior to those of assisted referral to outpatient
mental health care. Effects were especially strong for Hispanic participants, suggesting that
the protocol may be a useful tool in addressing ethnic disparities in care.

 A
nxiety and mood disorders in youth are prevalent1
and impairing,2-7 with a high degree of current and life-
time comorbidity in part because of shared etiologic
factors.8 These patients also are markedly undertreated, with
only 1 in 5 anxious youths and 2 in 5 depressed youths report-
ing any lifetime mental health service use for these disor-
ders,thelowesttreatmentratesforanypediatricmentalhealth
disorder.9 Furthermore, there are notable ethnic disparities in
care, with Hispanic youths significantly less likely to receive
mental health services than similarly affected non-Hispanic
white youths,9 despite experiencing similar or higher rates of
anxiety and depression.10-15
To improve access to and quality of care, the current trial
tested the effectiveness of a brief behavioral therapy (BBT) de-
veloped to efficiently target anxiety and depression as a uni-
fied problem area. There is increasing support for the effi-
cacy of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral interventions for
emotional disorders in adults16 and preliminary support for
such interventions in youths.17,18 The BBT trial built on this
work by testing a streamlined behavioral intervention with-
out the cognitive restructuring elements present in other pro-
grams to aid in the dissemination of BBT to active service set-
tings. The intervention was sited in pediatric primary care, a
major focus of public health efforts to improve access to
mental health services19,20 and a setting with low cultural
stigma.21-23
Thus, in the current trial, youths with full or probable di-
agnoses of anxiety, depression, or both were randomly as-
signed to (1) transdiagnostic BBT delivered in pediatric pri-
mary care or (2) assisted referral to outpatient mental health
care (ARC). The ARC was designed to maximize youth partici-
pation in specialty mental health care services and serve as a
public health comparison condition. We hypothesized that,
compared with ARC, BBT would have higher rates of clinical
response (primary outcome), greater reductions in anxiety and
depression symptoms, and higher global functioning after in-
tervention. We planned a priori to test for moderation of BBT
effects by site, Hispanic ethnicity, and presence of clinically
significantdepressioninyouths,givenepidemiologicdatasug-
gesting that anxiety would be widely prevalent in the sample,
with comorbid depression occurring at a lower rate.8,24-26
Methods
Youths (age range, 8.0-16.9 years) were recruited from 9
pediatric clinics in San Diego, California (n = 4), and the Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area (n = 5) from October
6, 2010, through December 5, 2014. Participant flow is shown
in Figure 1. The trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1.
Participantswereclinicallyreferredbypediatricsstaff(n = 620)
or self-referred from flyers in practices (n = 62). Youths were
eligible for randomization if they met the criteria at baseline
for full or probable (Clinical Global Impression–Severity score
[CGI-S] >3) diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, general-
ized anxiety disorder, social phobia, major depression, dys-
thymic disorder, or minor depression; lived with a consent-
ing legal guardian for at least 6 months; and both the youth
Key Points
Question Can a pediatric-based brief behavioral treatment
outperform assisted referral to outpatient mental health for
youths with anxiety and depression?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, 56.8% of youths in
pediatric-based behavioral treatment were clinically improved
compared with 28.2% of youths provided with assisted referral, a
significant difference. Effects were significantly stronger for
Hispanic youths, with 76.5% of those in behavioral treatment
improving compared with 7.1% of referred youths.
Meaning A pediatric-based brief behavioral treatment for anxiety
and depression can produce benefits superior to those of assisted
referral to outpatient mental health care and may address ethnic
disparities in outcomes.

Protection Program, Kaiser Permanente Southern California
Institutional Review Board, and University of Pittsburgh In-
stitutional Review Board approved study procedures; safety
was reviewed by a data safety monitoring board. Written in-
formed consent and assent were obtained from participating
parents and youths before initiation of study procedures.
Analyses were conducted in a deidentified data file.
BBT Intervention
The BBT transdiagnostic intervention was developed to
address youth anxiety, depression, and their comorbid pre-
sentation by integrating the core behavioral elements of
evidence-based treatments for these individual disorders.
Rationalefortreatmentdevelopmentanddetailedsessioncon-
tent are available elsewhere.29 In brief, exposure and behav-
ioralactivationwerecombinedinthecurrentprotocolasgraded
engagement in avoided activities, supplemented by relax-
ation to manage somatic symptoms common among internal-
izing youth in primary care and by problem-solving skills to
aid in stress management. Note that all these techniques had
been tested previously in clinical trials as components of other
treatment protocols. The BBT manual was novel in its simplic-
ity (fewer total techniques than most manuals), the exclusion
of cognitive restructuring in favor of behavioral techniques,
and the integration of psychoeducation and treatment tech-
niques to efficiently address anxious and depressed symp-
toms simultaneously. The BBT consisted of 8 to 12 weekly
45-minute sessions completed within 16 weeks. All sessions
were delivered in the primary care setting by master’s-level
study therapists (4 including M.S.R.). Therapist training con-
sisted of a half-day workshop with the manual developer, re-
view of recordings of 2 training cases, and completion of a ses-
sion-by-session role play. Audio recordings of the first 4 cases
for each therapist were reviewed in detail with the clinical trial
supervisor (V.R.W.); after this training phase, therapists re-
ceived 1 hour of weekly supervision to review their caseload.
ARC Procedures
The ARC procedures were modeled on evidence-based prac-
tices for reducing no-show rates in community mental health
care.30 The ARC included (1) feedback about the youth’s symp-
toms and benefit of services, (2) referrals and education about
obtaining services, and (3) problem-solving barriers to treat-
ment. The master’s-level coordinator (5 during the study pe-
riod, including M.S.R. and M.J.) contacted the youth’s pri-
mary caregiver, implemented an initial ARC session by
telephone, and continued to call the parent at least every 2
weeks to check in and problem solve obstacles to care with
families through the end of the acute treatment phase.
Assessments
Assessments were performed by clinical independent evalu-
ators (IEs), masked to condition. Baselines occurred onsite
in practices; follow-up assessments were conducted over the
telephone. The IEs were required to demonstrate 80% agree-
ment on at least 5 training tapes before conducting study as-
sessments and engaged in weekly supervision.
Measures
Demographic data were collected by parent and youth report.
Parents reported on youth race/ethnicity from US Census
categories.31 The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizo-
phrenia for School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version
was used to assess baseline diagnostic eligibility. The Clinical
Global Impressions scale32 was used to assess global severity
(CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I) across anxiety and depres-
sion. A CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much im-
proved) at the week 16 assessment indicated clinical response.
The IEs rated functional impairment with the Children'
s Global
Adjustment Scale (CGAS),33 anxiety severity with the Pediatric
Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS),34 and depression with the Chil-
dren’s Depression Rating Scale–Revised (CDRS-R).35 Interrater
reliabilitywasgoodacrossalloutcomemeasures(intraclasscor-
relation coefficients = 0.70-0.95).36 The Child and Adolescent
Services Assessment37 was administered to measure health
service use for both conditions and describe ARC services
obtained.
Statistical Analysis and Data Analytic Plan
The primary registered outcome of the trial was clinically sig-
nificant improvement of anxiety and depression (CGI-I score
≤2).SecondaryoutcomesincludedthePARS,CDRS-R,andfunc-
tioning scores; we further analyzed treatment dose and men-
tal health service use. Logistic regression methods and χ2 tests
were used for categorical measures and t tests for continuous
measures.Giventheassociationbetweenchangeinanxietyand
depression in the literature,38 we adopted a doubly multivar-
iate repeated-measures approach to jointly analyze changes in
the PARS and CDRS-R scores. Moderator analysis followed the
standardBarronandKenny39andKraemer40frameworks.With
a functional sample size of 79, we were powered to detect an
effect size in the order of 0.60 for the difference in improve-
ment rate between BBT and ARC. To calculate power for our
moderator analyses of the CGI-I, we conducted simulations
based on work by MacKinnon and colleagues.41 Including 3
moderators (ethnicity, clinically significant depression, and
site), power was adequate (>0.80) to detect medium (0.46) ef-
fects.Allsignificancetestswere2-tailed,andanalyseswerede-
signed as intention to treat; α was set at P < .05 for all tests.
To estimate the effect of missing data, we conducted sen-
sitivity analyses for each outcome by (1) performing the
planned analyses in the unadjusted intention-to-treat sample,

Results
Sample Characteristics and Retention
A total of 185 patients were enrolled in the study (mean [SD]
age, 11.3 [2.6] years; 107 [57.8%] female; 144 [77.8%] white; and
38 [20.7%] Hispanic). At baseline, the enrolled sample did not
significantly differ by group on demographic or clinical char-
acteristics (Table 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 2). As ex-
pected, the sample was broadly anxious, with 114 youths
(61.6%) meeting the criteria for 1 or more anxiety disorders,
60 (32.4%) having anxiety and clinically elevated depres-
sion,and11(5.9%)havingclinicallysignificantdepressionwith-
out current anxiety.
Of the 185 randomized youths, 159 (85.9%) completed the
week 16 assessment (Figure 1). Participants unavailable for fol-
low-up had significantly higher depression and lower func-
tioning scores (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Retention did not
differbysite(PittsburghvsSanDiego:88.9%vs83.3%;χ2
1 = 1.13;
P = .29), although there was a higher retention rate in the BBT
group than in the ARC group (92.6% vs 78.9%; χ 2
1 = 7.23;
P = .01).
Clinical Outcomes
Outcomes Across Anxiety and Depression
As seen in Figure 2, 50 (56.8%) of the 88 BBT youth were
rated as responders on our primary outcome measure (CGI-I
score ≤2) at week 16 compared with only 20 (28.2%) of
71 youths in the ARC group (χ 2
1 = 13.09; P < .001; number
needed to treat [NNT], 4; 95% CI, 2.3-7.2). The rate of
functional improvement in the BBT youths also was signifi-
cantly faster (β = 0.44; SE, 0.10; z = 4.45; P < .001; Cohen
d = 0.50) and the level of functioning higher at week 16
(mean [SD], 68.5 [10.7] vs 61.9 [11.9]; t156 = 3.64; P < .001;
Cohen d = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.26-0.90) than in ARC youths
(Figure 3).
Outcome by Psychopathological Domain
As seen in Figure 3 and Table 2, there was a significant effect
of time, with anxiety and depression scores improving from
baseline to week 16 (F2,146 = 54.03; P < .001; Cohen f = 0.86).
In addition, there was a significant treatment × time interac-
tion, such that youths in the BBT group had a faster rate of
improvement than youths randomized to the ARC group
(F2,146 = 5.72; P = .004; Cohen f = 0.28). These effects appear
to be largely driven by the superior effect of BBT on anxiety

 (F1,147 = 11.47;P = .01;Cohenf = 0.28);thetreatment × timein-
teraction for the CDRS-R was not statistically significant
(F1,147 = 0.78; P = .38; Cohen f = 0.07).
Moderation
Ethnicity significantly moderated response (odds ratio,
19.94; SE, 24.74; z = 2.41; P = .02), with Hispanic youths hav-
ing heightened response to BBT and little response to ARC
(13 [76.5%] of 17 vs 1 [7.1%] of 14; χ2
1 = 14.90; P < .001; NNT,
2; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2) (Figure 2). Ethnicity also significantly
moderated changes in functioning (β = 10.13; SE, 4.12;
t = 2.46; P = .02; Cohen d = 0.49). Hispanic youths in the
BBT group improved by a mean of 15.5 points on the CGAS,
shifting 2 qualitative functioning categories; in contrast, the
mean CGAS score change for Hispanic youths in the ARC
group was less than 1 point. Even when removing these
strong effects for Hispanic youths, in the non-Hispanic white
subgroup, the main effects of treatment on response (BBT vs
ARC: 37 [52.1%] of 71 vs 19 [33.9%] of 56; χ2
1 = 4.20; P = .04;
NNT, 6; 95% CI, 2.8-84.0) and functioning (β = 5.05; SE,
1.89; t = 2.67; P = .01; Cohen d = 0.49) remained statistically
significant and clinically meaningful. Clinically significant
depression in youths at baseline did not moderate the BBT
response on any outcome: depression as moderator of
response (odds ratio, 0.44; SE, 0.31; z = −1.17, P = .24),
depression as moderator of CGAS (functioning) (β = −4.73;
SE, 3.44; t = −1.37; P = .17; Cohen d = 0.23), and depression
as moderator of anxiety and depression scores (F2,144 = 0.90;
P = .41; Cohen f = 0.11). Study site moderated BBT effects on
functioning (β = 7.61; SE, 3.27; t = 2.33; P = .02; Cohen
d = 0.37), with larger effects in San Diego. This site effect
appeared to be accounted for by the higher proportion of
Hispanic youth in the San Diego sample. When Hispanic
youths were excluded from analysis, site effects on function-
ing were no longer statistically significant (β = 4.67; SE, 3.92;
t = 1.19; P = .24; Cohen d = 0.22). In addition, the main effect
of treatment on functioning was robust across both sites
(F1,154 = 18.64; P < .001; Cohen f = 0.35), and site did not
moderate any other outcomes.
Allocation Concealment
As a check on allocation concealment, IEs (masked to treat-
ment condition) were asked to guess participant group assign-
ment after interview completion at week 16. The IEs cor-
rectly guessed participants’ allocation at a rate higher than
chance (64.8%; χ2
1 = 13.89; P < .001). However, correct guess
by the IEs was not significantly associated with ratings of im-
provement (58.4% vs 72.9%; χ2
1 = 3.58; P = .06).

 Treatment Implementation and Service Use
The BBT was administered with high adherence, with a mean
of 96% of manual content delivered (rated from a randomly
selected 10% of sessions). The BBT youth attended a mean of
11.2 sessions, and 85 youths (90.4%) received at least a mini-
mum protocol dose of at least 8 sessions.
TheARCconditionwassuccessfullydelivered,withamean
of 4.2 coordinator calls provided during the 16 weeks to pro-
mote engagement in services and assess youths'clinical sta-
tusandneeds.TheARCcoordinatorsconnected82.2%offami-
lies with specialty mental health care for a mean of 6.5
outpatient sessions (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). We probed
whether youths in the ARC group who received more ser-
vices had outcomes comparable to youth in the BBT group. We
divided the ARC youth into high-dose (≥7 outpatient visits;
n = 34) and low-dose (<7 visits; n = 47) groups. In the ARC
group, high- and low-dose youths did not significantly differ
onanyoutcomemetric:(response:P = .11;functioning:P = .22;
anxiety and depression scores: P = .74). We further compared
high-dose ARC youths with youths enrolled in BBT. Across
analyses, participants in the ARC high-dose group had signifi-
cantly worse outcomes than youths randomized to BBT: re-
sponse (BBT vs ARC: 50 [56.8%] of 88 vs 6 [18.8%] of 32;
χ 2
1 = 13.66; P < .001; NNT, 3; 95% CI, 1.8-4.8), functioning
(β = 8.59;SE,2.06;t = 4.16;P < .001;Cohend = 0.92),andanxi-
ety and depression scores (F2,109 = 4.26; P = .02; Cohen
d = 0.56). Of note, Hispanic ethnicity was not significantly re-
lated to receipt (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic: 15 [88.2%] of 17 vs
58 [92.1%] of 63; Fisher exact test, P = .64) or dose (mean [SD]
visits, Hispanic vs non-Hispanic: 4.4 [5.6] vs 7.0 [5.7]; z = 1.88;
P = .06) of outpatient care in the ARC arm.
Discussion
Anxiety and depression in youth are widely prevalent, highly
impairing, and woefully undertreated.1-7,9 In the current trial,
youths who were randomized to pediatric-based BBT readily
accepted the behavioral treatment (92.6% retained), demon-
strated excellent session attendance (mean of 11.2 sessions),
and achieved high clinical response rates (56.8%) and
substantial functional improvement. The enhanced referral
procedures of the ARC comparison condition also were suc-
cessful in engaging families in community mental health care,
with use rates (82%) and session attendance (mean of 6.5
sessions) notably higher than those reported in the health
services literature.9 However, the success of ARC in linking
youths to services did not produce clinical outcomes compa-
rable to BBT. The ARC response rate was half that of the BBT,
with a corresponding smaller improvement in functioning.
These effects were especially stark for Hispanic youths, who
had heightened response to BBT (76.5% response rate) and
worse outcomes in ARC (7.1%) than did non-Hispanic white
youths. Even for non-Hispanic white youths, the response rate
for outpatient care in the ARC resembled that of clinical trial
control conditions (eg, 24%; Child-Adolescent Anxiety Multi-
modal Study42), adding to a troubling body of evidence sug-
gesting that typical, eclectic community outpatient services
for youths may be of modest effectiveness43 and reliably less
efficacious than evidence-based psychosocial treatment
protocols.44
Of note, these positive BBT effects occurred for a stream-
lined, transdiagnostic behavioral intervention that did not in-
clude cognitive restructuring elements common to disorder-
specific anxiety and depression protocols and to most
transdiagnosticprotocols.Theseresultsjoinanincreasingbody
of work that suggests that behavioral techniques may be es-
sential active ingredients of more complex psychosocial in-
tervention packages45 and that it may be possible to simplify
interventions for some psychiatric conditions to aid in the dis-
semination of evidence-based treatment without a decrease
in efficacy. Indeed, the absolute response rate for BBT in this
pediatric effectiveness trial (56.8%) compares favorably with
results of major efficacy trials of cognitive behavioral therapy
for youth anxiety (59.7%, Child-Adolescent Anxiety Multi-
modal Study42) and depression (43.2%, Treatment for Ado-
lescents With Depression Study46), providing empirical sup-
port for policies aimed at improving youth mental health care
through expanding pediatric behavioral health care.19,20
The superior effects of BBT were robust to site and pres-
ence of clinically elevated depression in youths. Of note, al-
though youths with and without clinically significant depres-
sion received similar benefit from BBT, the intervention did
not have statistically significant effects on depression symp-
toms as measured with the CDRS-R. This may be, in part, at-
tributable to floor effects on the outcome measure; only 38%
of youths had increased depression at baseline. Youth depres-
sion also was associated with study dropout across groups, al-
though sensitivity analyses did not suggest that attrition
skewed results. Alternately, BBT may have been less effective
in treating depression per se despite the positive effects for de-
pressed youths in terms of overall clinical improvement, func-
tioning, and anxiety severity.
In addition, by design, the effects of the BBT arm in-
cluded the effect of the specific BBT treatment protocol and
the effect of colocation of BBT services in primary care. Colo-
cation of behavioral health is not yet the norm nationally but
is becoming increasingly common, with a recent geocoding
analysis of Medicaid data suggesting that 43% of primary care
physicians may be colocated with a mental health counselor.47
Integration of primary care and behavioral health is rarer than
simple colocation.48 The positive effects of BBT thus reflect
the value of successfully bringing these structured behav-
ioral services to primary care compared with the common
option of external referral to community mental health.
Planned future analyses will probe cost-effectiveness of the
colocated BBT arm compared with ARC referral to commu-
nity outpatient care. Future research would benefit from ad-
ditional consideration of workforce development and staff
training, practice and health care system characteristics, and
provision of care in isolated or rural environments where com-
munity mental health resources may be especially minimal.
Limitations
Although the effects of BBT appear to be promising, this trial
represents the first test of the transdiagnostic treatment

 program. It will be important to replicate these outcomes in
larger samples, particularly the strong moderation effects for
the subsample (n = 38) of Hispanic youth. A larger sample also
may have provided the opportunity to test BBT effects on de-
pression more completely. The intervention was designed as
a transdiagnostic protocol for anxiety and depression, and al-
though BBT did positively impact overall response, anxiety,
and functioning in both anxious and anxious-depressed
youths, significant effects were not found for clinician-rated
depression symptoms. The proportion of youths with clini-
cally significant depression in the sample may have been in-
sufficient to observe these effects. In addition, the trial pro-
vided only a limited test of the effectiveness of the BBT
interventioninpractice.ItisunknownwhetherBBTwouldpro-
duce positive outcomes if it had been delivered in a dissemi-
nation trial using nonresearch staff. Long-term effects of BBT
relative to ARC also remain an open question and may be a ca-
veat to the conclusions of the study if ARC youths obtain ad-
ditional, more effective community services (such as the pre-
scribing of serotonin reuptake inhibitors) at a delay, compared
with the quicker initiation of BBT procedures.
