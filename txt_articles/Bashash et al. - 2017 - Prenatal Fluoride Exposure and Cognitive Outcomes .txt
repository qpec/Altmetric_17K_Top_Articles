BACKGROUND: Some evidence suggests that fluoride may be neurotoxic to children. Few of the epidemiologic studies have been longitudinal, had
individual measures of fluoride exposure, addressed the impact of prenatal exposures or involved more than 100 participants.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to estimate the association of prenatal exposure to fluoride with offspring neurocognitive development.
METHODS: We studied participants from the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) project. An ion-selective elec-
trode technique was used to measure fluoride in archived urine samples taken from mothers during pregnancy and from their children when 6–12 y
old, adjusted for urinary creatinine and specific gravity, respectively. Child intelligence was measured by the General Cognitive Index (GCI) of the
McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities at age 4 and full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence
(WASI) at age 6–12.
RESULTS: We had complete data on 299 mother–child pairs, of whom 287 and 211 had data for the GCI and IQ analyses, respectively. Mean (SD)
values for urinary fluoride in all of the mothers (n = 299) and children with available urine samples (n = 211) were 0:90 ð0:35Þ mg=L and
0:82 ð0:38Þ mg=L, respectively. In multivariate models we found that an increase in maternal urine fluoride of 0:5 mg=L (approximately the IQR)
predicted 3.15 (95% CI: −5:42, −0:87) and 2.50 (95% CI −4:12, −0:59) lower offspring GCI and IQ scores, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, higher prenatal fluoride exposure, in the general range of exposures reported for other general population samples of
pregnant women and nonpregnant adults, was associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive function in the offspring at age 4 and 6–12 y. https://

Introduction
Community water, salt, milk, and dental products have been fluo-
ridated in varying degrees for more than 60 y to prevent dental
caries, while fluoride supplementation has been recommended to
prevent bone fractures (Jones et al. 2005). In addition, people
may be exposed to fluoride through the consumption of naturally
contaminated drinking water, dietary sources, dental products,
and other sources (Doull et al. 2006). Whereas fluoride is added
to drinking water [in the United States at levels of 0:7–1:2 mg=L
(Doull et al. 2006)] to promote health, populations with exception-
ally high exposures, often from naturally contaminated drinking
water, are at risk of adverse health effects, including fluorosis.
In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is responsible for establishing maximum permissi-
ble concentrations of contaminants, including fluoride, in public
drinking-water systems. These standards are guidelines for restrict-
ing the amount of fluoride contamination in drinking water, not
standards for intentional drinking-water fluoridation. In 2006 the
U.S. EPA asked the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) to
reevaluate the existing U.S. EPA standards for fluoride contamina-
tion, including the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG, a
concentration at which no adverse health effects are expected) of
4 mg=L, to determine if the standards were adequate to protect pub-
lic health (Doull et al. 2006). The committee concluded that the
MCLG of 4 mg=L should be lowered because it puts children at
risk of developing severe enamel fluorosis, and may be too high to
prevent bone fractures caused by fluorosis (Doull et al. 2006). The
Committee also noted some experimental and epidemiologic evidence
suggesting that fluoride may be neurotoxic (Doull et al. 2006).
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) recently reviewed
animal studies on the effects of fluoride on neurobehavioral out-
comes and concluded that there was a moderate level of evidence
for adverse effects of exposures during adulthood, a low level of
evidence for effects of developmental exposures on learning and
memory, and a need for additional research, particularly on the
developmental effects of exposures consistent with those result-
ing from water fluoridation in the United States (Doull et al.
2006; NTP 2016). Human studies have shown a direct relation-
ship between the serum fluoride concentrations of maternal ve-
nous blood and cord blood, indicating that the placenta is not a
barrier to the passage of fluoride to the fetus (Shen and Taves,
1974). Fluoride was shown to accumulate in rat brain tissues after
chronic exposures to high levels, and investigators have specu-
lated that accumulation in the hippocampus might explain effects
on learning and memory (Mullenix et al. 1995). An experimental
study on mice has shown that fluoride exposure may have
adverse effects on neurodevelopment, manifesting as both cogni-
tive and behavioral abnormalities later in life (Liu et al. 2014).

Research
 Most epidemiologic studies demonstrating associations between
fluoride exposure and lower neuropsychological indicators have
been conducted in populations living in regions with endemic
fluorosis that are exposed to high levels of fluoride in contami-
nated drinking water. The epidemiologic evidence is limited,
however, with most studies using an ecologic design to estimate
childhood exposures based on neighborhood measurements of
fluoride (e.g., drinking water levels) rather than personal expo-
sure measures. Moreover, almost all existing studies of childhood
outcomes are cross-sectional in nature, rendering them weak con-
tributors towards causal inference.
The main objective of this study was to assess the potential
impact of prenatal exposures to fluoride on cognitive function
and test hypotheses related to impacts on overall cognitive func-
tion. We hypothesized that fluoride concentrations in maternal
urine samples collected during pregnancy, a proxy measure of
prenatal fluoride exposure, would be inversely associated with
cognitive performance in the offspring children. Overall, to our
knowledge, this is one of the first and largest longitudinal epide-
miologic studies to exist that either address the association of
early life exposure to fluoride to childhood intelligence or study
the association of fluoride and cognition using individual bio-
marker of fluoride exposure.
Methods
This is a longitudinal birth cohort study of measurements of fluo-
ride in the urine of pregnant mothers and their offspring (as indi-
cators of individual prenatal and postnatal exposures to fluoride,
respectively) and their association with measures of offspring
cognitive performance at 4 and 6–12 y old. The institutional
review boards of the National Institute of Public Health of
Mexico, University of Toronto, University of Michigan, Indiana
University, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and
participating clinics approved the study procedures. Participants
were informed of study procedures prior to signing an informed
consent required for participation in the study.
Participants
Mother–child pairs in this study were participants from the suc-
cessively enrolled longitudinal birth cohort studies in Mexico
City that comprise the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to
Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) project. Of the four
ELEMENT cohorts [that have been described elsewhere (Afeiche
et al. 2011)], Cohort 1 and Cohort 2B recruited participants at
birth and did not have archived maternal-pregnancy urine sam-
ples required for this analysis; they were thus excluded. Mothers
for Cohort 2A (n = 327) and 3 (n = 670) were all recruited from
the same three hospitals in Mexico City that serve low-to-
moderate income populations. Cohort 2A was an observational
study of prenatal lead exposure and neurodevelopmental out-
comes in children (Hu et al. 2006). Women who were planning
to become pregnant or were pregnant were recruited during May
1997–July 1999 and were considered eligible if they consented to
participate; were ≤14 wk of gestation at the time of recruitment;
planned to stay in the Mexico City study area for at least
5 y; did not report a history of psychiatric disorders, high-
risk pregnancies, gestational diabetes; did not report current
use of daily alcohol, illegal drugs, and continuous prescription
drugs; and were not diagnosed with preeclampsia, renal disease,
circulatory diseases, hypertension, and seizures during the index
pregnancy.
Cohort 3 mothers were pregnant women (≤14 wk of gesta-
tion) recruited from 2001 to 2003 for a randomized trial of the
effect of calcium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal
blood lead levels (Ettinger et al. 2009). Eligibility criteria were
the same as for Cohort 2A, and 670 agreed to participate.
Exposure Assessment
By virtue of living in Mexico, individuals participating in the
study have been exposed to fluoridated salt (at 250 ppm)
(Secretaría-de-Salud 1995, 1996) and to varying degrees of natu-
rally occurring fluoride in drinking water. Previous reports, based
on samples taken from different urban and rural areas, indicate
that natural water fluoride levels in Mexico City may range from
0.15 to 1:38 mg=L (Juárez-López et al. 2007; Martínez-Mier
et al. 2005). Mean fluoride content for Mexico City’s water sup-
ply is not available because fluoride is not reported as part of
water quality control programs in Mexico.
Mother–child pairs with at least one archived urine sample from
pregnancy and measures of neurocognitive function in the offspring
were included in this study. In terms of when the archived samples
were collected, the pregnant mothers were invited for assessments
with the collection of samples during trimester 1 (13:6 ± 2:1 wk for
Cohort
3
and
13:7 ± 3:5 wk
for
Cohort
2A),
trimester
2
(25:1 ± 2:3 wk for Cohort 3 and 24:4 ± 2:9 wk for Cohort 2A), and
trimester 3 (33:9 ± 2:2 wk for Cohort 3 and 35:0 ± 1:8 wk for
Cohort 2A).
A spot (second morning void) urine sample was targeted for
collection during each trimester of pregnancy of ELEMENT
mothers as well as the offspring children at the time of their
measurements of intelligence at 6–12 y old. The samples were
collected into fluoride-free containers and immediately frozen at
the field site and shipped and stored at −20�C at the Harvard T.
H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), and then at −80�C at
the University of Michigan School of Public Health (UMSPH).
A procedure for urine analysis of fluoride described elsewhere
(Martínez-Mier et al. 2011) was adapted and modified for this
study. The fluoride content of the urine samples was measured
using ion-selective electrode-based assays. First, 3 M sulfuric
acid saturated with hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) was added to
the sample to allow fluoride to diffuse from the urine for
20–24 hr. The diffused fluoride was allowed to collect in 0.05 M
of sodium hydroxide on the interior of the petri dish cover. Once
the diffusion was complete, 0.25 M of acetic acid was added to
the sodium hydroxide to neutralize the solution and then analyzed
directly using a fluoride ion-selective electrode (Thermo Scientific
Orion, Cat#13-642-265) and pH/ISE meter (Thermo Scientific
Orion, Cat#21-15-001). All electrode readings (in millivolts) were
calculated from a standard curve. Analyses were performed in a
Class 100/1,000 clean room. Quality control measures included
daily instrument calibration, procedural blanks, replicate runs,
and the use of certified reference materials (Institut National de
Santé Publique du Québec, Cat #s 0910 and 1007; NIST3183,
Fluoride Anion Standard). Urinary fluoride concentrations were
measured at the UMSPH and the Indiana University Oral Health
Research Institute (OHRI) as previously described (Thomas et al.
2016). A validation study comparing measures taken by the two
labs in the same samples revealed a between-lab correlation of
0.92 (Thomas et al. 2016).
There were a total of 1,484 prenatal samples measured at
the UMSPH lab. All of these samples were measured in dupli-
cate. Of these, 305 (20%) of them did not meet the quality con-
trol criteria for ion-selective electrode-based methods (i.e.,
RSD <20% for samples with F level <0:2 ppm or RSD <10%
when F level >0:2 ppm) (Martinez-Mier et al. 2011). Of these
305, 108 had a second aliquot available and were successfully
measured at the OHRI lab in Indiana (sufficient urine volume
was not available for the remaining 197 samples). The OHRI lab
in Indiana also measured an additional 289 samples. Of the 397
Environmental Health Perspectives
097017-2
 total samples measured at the OHRI lab in Indiana, 139 (35%)
were measured in duplicate, for which >95% complied with the
quality control criteria above; thus, all 139 values were retained.
The remaining 258 (65%) were not measured in duplicate
because of limitations in available urine volume, but were
included in the study given the excellent quality control at the
OHRI lab. In total, we ended up with 1,576 prenatal urine sam-
ples with acceptable measures of fluoride.
Of these 1,576 urine samples, 887 also had data on urinary
creatinine and were associated with mother–offspring pairs who
had data on the covariates of interest and GCI or IQ in the off-
spring. The urinary creatinine data were used to correct for
variations in urine dilution at the time of measurement (Baez
et al. 2014). Creatinine-adjusted urinary fluoride concentrations
were obtained for each maternally derived sample by dividing
the fluoride concentration (MUF) in the sample by the sample’s
creatinine concentration (MUC), and multiplying by the average
creatinine concentration of samples available at each trimester
(MUCaverage) using the formula: ðMUF=MUCÞ × MUCaverage.
The values of average creatinine concentration used for the
MUCaverage at each trimester were derived from the larger pool
of trimester-1, -2, and -3 samples from Cohorts 2A and 3 exam-
ined in our previous report on maternal fluoride biomarker levels
(Thomas et al. 2016): 100.81, 81.60, and 72.41 (mg/L), respec-
tively. For each woman, an average of all her available
creatinine-adjusted urinary fluoride concentrations during preg-
nancy (maximum three samples and minimum one sample) was
computed and used as the exposure measure (MUFcr). For chil-
dren, as creatinine measurements were not available, urinary fluo-
ride values (CUF) were corrected for specific gravity (SG) using
the formula CUFsg = CUFð1:02 − 1Þ=ðSG −1Þ (Usuda et al.
2007).
After calculating MUFcr for the 887 urine samples noted
above, 10 values of MUFcr were identified as extreme outliers
(>3:5 SDs) and were dropped, leaving 877 measures of MUFcr.
These 877 measures of MUFcr stemmed from 512 unique moth-
ers. Of these 512, 71 participants had measurements from each of
the three trimesters; 224 had measurements from two of the three
trimesters (74, T1 and T2; 131, T1 and T3; and 19, T2 and T3);
and 217 had measurements from only one of the trimesters (159,
T1; 34, T2; and 24, T3).
Measurement of Outcomes
At age 4 y, neurocognitive outcomes were measured using a
standardized version of McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities
(MSCA) translated into Spanish (McCarthy 1991). MSCA evalu-
ates verbal, perceptual-performance, quantitative, memory, and
motor abilities of preschool-aged children, and it has previously
been successfully used in translated versions (Braun et al. 2012;
Julvez et al. 2007; Kordas et al. 2011; Puertas et al. 2010).
For this analysis, we focused on the General Cognitive Index
(GCI), which is the standardized composite score produced
by the MSCA (McCarthy 1991). For children 6–12 y old a
Spanish-version
of
the
Wechsler
Abbreviated
Scale
of
Intelligence (WASI) (Wechsler 1999) was administered. WASI
includes four subtests (Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design,
and Matrix Reasoning), which provide estimates of Verbal,
Performance, and Full-Scale IQ (Wechsler 1999). Both tests
were administered by a team of three psychologists who were
trained and supervised by an experienced developmental psychol-
ogist (L.S.). This team of three psychologists applied all of the
McCarthy tests as well as the WASI-FSIQ tests. At the time of
follow-up visits (age 4 and 6–12 y), each child was evaluated by
one of the psychologists who was blind to the children’s fluoride
exposure. The inter-examiner reliability of the psychologists was
evaluated by having all three psychologists participate in assess-
ments on a set of 30 individuals. For these 30, the inter-examiner
reliability of the psychologists was evaluated by calculating the
correlation in GCI scores by two of the psychologists with the
scores of a third psychologist whom they observed applying
the test in all three possible combinations with 10 participants
for each observers–examiner pair (i.e., psychologist A (applicant)
was observed by psychologist B and psychologist C; psychologist
B (applicant) was observed by psychologist A and psychologist C;
and psychologist C (applicant) was observed by psychologist A
and psychologist B). The mean observer–examiner correlation
was 0.99. All raw scores were standardized for age and sex
(McCarthy 1991). Inter-examiner reliability was not examined
on the WASI test.
Measurement of Covariates
Data were collected from each subject by questionnaire on mater-
nal age (and date of birth), education, and marital status at the
first pregnancy visit; on birth order, birth weight, and gestational
age at delivery; and on maternal smoking at every prenatal and
postnatal visit. Gestational age was estimated by registered
nurses. Maternal IQ was estimated using selected subtests of the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-Spanish (Information,
Comprehension, Similarities, and Block Design), which was
standardized for Mexican adults (Renteria et al. 2008; Wechsler
et al. 1981). Maternal IQ was measured at the study visit
6 mo after birth or at the 12-mo visit if the earlier visit was not
completed.
The quality of the children’s individual home environments
was assessed using an age-appropriate version of the HOME
score. However, the measure was not available for all observa-
tions because it was only added to on-going cohort evaluation
protocols beginning in April 2003, when a version of the HOME
score instrument that is age-appropriate for children 0–5 y old
was adopted, following which a version of the HOME score
instrument that is age-appropriate for children ≥6 y old was
adopted in September 2009 (Caldwell and Bradley 2003). Thus,
we adjusted for HOME score using the measures for 0- to 5-y-old
children in the subset of children who had this data in our analy-
ses of GCI, and we adjusted for HOME score using the measures
for >6-y-old children in the subset of children who had this data
in our analyses of IQ.
Statistical Analyses
Univariate distributions and descriptive statistics were obtained
for all exposure variables, outcome variables, and model covari-
ates. For each variable, observations were classified as outliers if
they were outside the bounds of the mean ± 3:5 SDs. Primary
analyses were conducted with exposure and outcome outliers
excluded. Statistical tests of bivariate associations were con-
ducted using chi-square tests for categorical variables and analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the means of the outcomes
or exposure within groups defined according to the distribution of
each covariate. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to
measure the correlation between MUFcr and CUFsg. Regression
models were used to assess the adjusted associations between
prenatal fluoride and each neurocognitive outcome separately.
Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to visualize the
adjusted association between fluoride exposure and measures of
intelligence [SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute
Inc.)]. Because the pattern appeared curvilinear, and because
GAMs do not yield exact p-values for deviations from linearity,
we used a Wald p-value of a quadratic term of fluoride exposure
to test the null hypothesis that a quadratic model fit the data better
Environmental Health Perspectives
097017-3
 than the model assuming a linear relationship, and thus obtained
a p-value for deviation from linearity of the fluoride–outcome
associations. Residual diagnostics were used to examine other
model assumptions and identify any additional potentially influ-
ential observations. Visual inspection of default studentized re-
sidual versus leverage plot from SAS PROC REG did not
identify potential influential observations. Visual inspection of
the histogram of the residuals did not indicate lack of normality;
however, a fanning pattern in the residual versus predicted value
plot indicated lack of constant variance (data not shown). Hence,
robust standard errors were obtained using the “empirical” option
in SAS PROC GENMOD.
Our overall strategy for selecting covariates for adjustment
was to identify those that are well known to have potential associ-
ations with either fluoride exposure or cognitive outcomes and/or
are typically adjusted for as potential confounders in analyses of
environmental toxicants and cognition. All models were adjusted
for gestational age at birth (in weeks), birthweight (kilograms),
birth order (first born yes vs. no), sex, and child’s age at the time
of the neurocognitive test (in years). All models were also
adjusted for maternal characteristics including marital status
(married vs. others), smoking history (ever-smoker vs. never-
smoker), age at delivery, IQ, and education (itself also a proxy
for socioeconomic status). Finally, all models adjusted for poten-
tial cohort effects by including indicator variables denoting from
which cohort (Cohort 2A, Cohort 3 + Ca supplement, and Cohort
3 -placebo) the participants came. We used 0:5 mg=L, which was
close to the interquartile range of MUFcr for the analyses of both
GCI (IQR = 0:45) and IQ (IQR = 0:48), as a standard measure of
incremental exposure. SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS
Institute Inc.) was used for all data analyses described.
Sensitivity Analyses
Models were further adjusted for variables that relate to relatively
well-known potential confounders (but for which we were miss-
ing a significant amount of data) and variables that were less-well
known but possible confounders. The HOME scores were subject
to sensitivity analyses because, as noted in the “Methods” sec-
tion, they were not added to the subject evaluation protocols until
2003, resulting in a significantly smaller subsample of partici-
pants with this data. Models of the association between prenatal
fluoride exposure (MUFcr) and IQ at 6–12 y old were also
adjusted for the child’s urine fluoride concentration at 6–12 y of
Figure 1. Flowchart describing source of mother–offspring subject pairs, fluoride and cognition study. Cohort 2A was designed as an observational birth cohort
of lead toxicodynamics during pregnancy, with mothers recruited early during pregnancy from 1997 to 2001. Cohort 3 was designed as a randomized double-
blind placebo-controlled trial of calcium supplements, with mothers recruited early during pregnancy from 2001 to 2006. “Ca” denotes subjects who were
randomized to the calcium supplement; “placebo” denotes subjects who were randomized to the placebo. GCI is the McCarthy Scales General Cognitive Index
(administered at age 4 y). IQ is the Wechsler Abbreviated Intelligence Scales Intelligence Quotient (administered at age 6–12 y and age-adjusted).

 age (CUFsg), a measure that was collected in a significantly
smaller subset of individuals, to evaluate the potential role of
contemporaneous exposure. Associations between prenatal fluo-
ride exposure (MUFcr) and GCI at 4 y old could not be adjusted
for contemporaneous fluoride exposure because urine samples
were not collected from children when the MSCA (from which
the GCI is derived) was administered. Maternal bone lead meas-
ured by a 109-Cd K-X-ray fluorescence (KXRF) instrument at
1 mo postpartum, a proxy for lead exposure from mobilized
maternal bone lead stores during pregnancy (Hu et al. 2006), was
included in the model to test for the possible confounding effect
of lead exposure during pregnancy. We focused on the subset of
women who had patella bone lead values because these were
found to be most influential on our previous prospective study of
offspring cognition (Gomaa et al. 2002). Average maternal mer-
cury level during pregnancy was also tested for being a potential
confounder (Grandjean and Herz 2011). Mercury was measured
as total mercury content in the subsample of women who had
samples of archived whole blood samples taken during pregnancy
with sufficient volume to be analyzed using a Direct Mercury
Analyzer 80 (DMA-80, Milestone Inc., Shelton, CT, USA) as
previously described (Basu et al. 2014).
To address the potential confounding effect of socioeconomic
status (SES) we conducted sensitivity analyses that adjusted our
model for SES (family possession score). The socioeconomic
questionnaire asked about the availability of certain items and
assets in the home. Point values were assigned to each item, and
SES was calculated based on the sum of the points across all
items (Huang et al. 2016). Given that the calcium intervention
theoretically could have modified the impact of fluoride, in exam-
ining our results, we repeated the analyses with and without the
Cohort 3 participants who were randomized to the calcium
intervention to omit any potential confounding effect of this
intervention. Another sensitivity test was performed to examine
the potential effect of the psychologist who performed the
WASI test by including tester in the regression model. The in-
formation about psychologists who performed the WASI was
available for 75% of participants, as recording this data was

 added later to the study protocol. We also re-ran models with
exposure outliers included as a sensitivity step. Finally, we ran
models that focused on the cross-sectional relationship between
children’s exposure to fluoride (reflected by CUFsg) and IQ
score, unadjusted; adjusting for the main covariates of interest;
and adjusting for prenatal exposure (MUFcr) as well as the
covariates of interest.
Results
Flow of Participants
Of the 997 total mothers from two cohorts evaluated, 971 were
eligible after removing mothers <18 y old. Of these 971, 825 had
enough urine sample volume to measure fluoride in at least one
trimester urine sample, and of these 825 participants, 515 partici-
pants had urine samples with previously measured creatinine val-
ues, enabling calculation of creatinine-adjusted urinary fluoride
(MUFcr) concentrations. Of these 515, 3 participants were
excluded based on the 10 extreme outlier values identified for
MUFcr (see the “Methods” section, “Exposure Assessment” sub-
section) and not having any other MUFcr values to remain in the
analysis. Thus, we had a total of 512 participants (mothers) with
at least one value of MUFcr for our analyses (Figure 1).
Of these 512 mothers, 312 had offspring with outcome data at
age 4 (i.e., GCI), and 234 had offspring with outcome data at age
6–12 (i.e., IQ). Of these, complete data on all the covariates of
main interest (as specified in the “Methods” section) were avail-
able on 287 mother–child pairs for the GCI analysis and 211
mother–child pairs for the IQ analysis. A total of 299 mother–
child pairs had data on either GCI or IQ, and 199 mother–child
pairs had data on both GCI and IQ (Figure 1).
Number of Exposure Measures per Subject
In terms of repeated measures of MUFcr across trimesters, of the
287 participants with data on GCI outcomes; 25 participants had
MUFcr data for all three trimesters (11 from Cohort 2A and 14
from Cohort 3), 121 participants had MUFcr data from two tri-
mesters (48 from Cohort 2A and 73 from Cohort 3), and 141 par-
ticipants had MUFcr data from one trimester (51 from Cohort 2A
and 90 from Cohort 3). Of the 211 participants with data on IQ
outcomes, 10 participants had MUFcr data for all three trimesters
(6 from Cohort 2A and 4 from Cohort 3), 82 participants had data
from two trimesters (32 from Cohort 2A and 50 from Cohort 3),
and 119 participants had data from one trimester (40 from Cohort
2A and 79 from Cohort 3).

 values of creatinine–corrected urinary fluoride for the mothers
was 0:90 ð0:36Þ mg=L. The distributions of the urinary fluoride,
outcomes (GCI and IQ), and additional exposure variables exam-
ined in our sensitivity analyses (maternal bone lead, maternal
blood mercury, and children’s contemporaneous urinary fluoride)
across the three cohort strata (Cohort 3-Calcium, Cohort 3-pla-
cebo, and Cohort 2A) and all strata combined are shown in Table
1 for the mother–child pairs who had data for the GCI outcome
(n = 287) and the IQ outcome (n = 211). The distributions
showed little variation across the cohort strata except for bone
lead and possibly blood mercury, for which, in comparison with
Cohort 3, Cohort 2A clearly had higher mean bone lead levels
(p < 0:001) and possibly higher blood mercury levels (p = 0:067).
The mean (SD) values of specific gravity–corrected urinary fluo-
ride for the children who had these measures (only available for
those children who had IQ; n = 189) were 0:82 ð0:38Þ mg=L.
In terms of the comparability of the participants across
Cohort 2A and Cohort 3 with respect to our covariates, the distri-
bution of the covariates was very similar with the exception of
age of the offspring when IQ was measured, for which the mean
ages were 7.6 and 10.0 y, respectively; and birth weight in the
GCI analysis, for which Cohort 3 participants were slightly heav-
ier than Cohort 2 participants (see Table S1).
GCI versus IQ Scores
There was a significant correlation between GCI at 4 y and IQ at
6–12 y old (Spearman r = 0:55; p < 0:01). There was no signifi-
cant correlation between prenatal MUFcr and offspring CUFsg
(Spearman r = 0:54, p = 0:44).
Comparisons of Participants in Relation to Missing Data
In comparing the participants who were included for the GCI and
IQ analyses with the participants who were not included (based
on data missing on GCI, IQ or other covariates), the distribution
of covariates were similar except for sex, for which the propor-
tion of females was somewhat higher in the included versus
excluded group for both the GCI and IQ analyses (Table 2).
In terms of the sensitivity analyses, for each sensitivity vari-
able of interest, we compared participants who had data on our
exposures, outcomes, covariates, and the sensitivity variable of
interest (and were thus included in the sensitivity analysis) versus
participants who had data on the sensitivity variable of interest
but were missing data on the exposure, outcomes, and/or covari-
ates of interest (and were thus excluded from the sensitivity anal-
ysis; Table 2). It can be seen that for each sensitivity analysis,
most of the participants with data on the sensitivity variable of in-
terest also had data on the exposures, outcomes, and covariates
and were therefore included in the sensitivity analysis. In addi-
tion, the distributions appeared to be similar comparing those
included with those excluded in each sensitivity analysis (means
were within 10% of each other), with the exception of maternal
blood Hg, for which the mean levels for those included were
28.5% and 24.9% higher than the mean levels for those excluded
in the GCI and IQ analyses, respectively.
Comparisons of GCI and IQ across Covariates
Table 3 shows mean and SD values for MUFcr and offspring cog-
nitive scores across categories of the covariates. In the partici-
pants with GCI data, the offspring cognitive scores were higher
among mothers with higher levels of education, measured IQ,
and HOME scores for both analyses; and scores were higher
among first children and girls. In the IQ analysis a statistically
significant difference was observed in MUFcr as a function of
child sex. No significant differences in MUFcr values across lev-
els of other covariates were observed. A modest difference (not
statistically significant), was observed in MUFcr as a function of
maternal IQ (p = 0:09), and MUFcr as a function of child sex
(p = 0:09). Among other co-variates there were significant differ-
ences in age (p < 0:01) in both analyses.
Regression Models of GCI
Before adjustment, a 0:5 mg=L increase in MUFcr was negatively
associated with GCI at 4 y old [mean score −3:76; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI): −6:32, −1:19] (Table 4). The association
was somewhat attenuated after adjusting for the main covariates

 (model A, −3:15; 95% CI: −5:42, −0:87). The smooth plot of
the association between GCI and maternal prenatal urinary fluo-
ride from an adjusted GAM model suggested a linear relation
over the exposure distribution (Figure 2).
Regression Models of IQ
A 0:5 mg=L increase in prenatal fluoride was also negatively
associated with IQ at age 6–12 y based on both unadjusted
(−2:37; 95% CI: −4:45, −0:29) and adjusted models (−2:50;
95% CI: −4:12, −0:59) (Table 4). However, estimates from the
adjusted GAM model suggest a nonlinear relation, with no clear
association between IQ scores and values below approximately
0:8 mg=L, and a negative association above this value (Figure
3A). There was a nonsignificant improvement in the fit of the
model when a quadratic term was added to the linear model
(p = 0:10).
Sensitivity Analyses
In sensitivity analyses, adjustment for HOME score increased the
magnitude of the association between MUFcr and GCI, though
the difference was less pronounced when associations with and
without adjustment for HOME score were both estimated after
restricting the model to the subset of 138 children with HOME
score data (Table 4). The association of IQ scores with MUFcr
did not substantially change after adding HOME score to the
model (Table 4).
The association between MUFcr and IQ was attenuated
slightly after adjusting for contemporaneous children’s urinary
fluoride (CUFsg) and comparing estimates with [−1:73 (95% CI:
−3:75, 0.29)] and without [−1:94 (95% CI: −4:15, 0.26)] adjust-
ment for CUFsg among the 189 children with this data (Table 4).
In addition, the evidence of nonlinearity was more pronounced,
with no clear evidence of an association for MUFcr <1:0 mg=L
based on the GAM model (Figure 3B), and a significant improve-
ment in model fit when a quadratic term was added to the linear
regression model (p = 0:01).
When we restricted models to subsets of children with avail-
able data for each additional covariate, there was little difference

 between adjusted and unadjusted associations between MUFcr
and GCI or IQ when socioeconomic status (family possession),
maternal bone lead, and blood mercury, were added to models
(Table 4). However, the effect estimates associated with MUFcr
for these analyses appear to be higher in the subsets with avail-
able data for these variables.
Adding tester (psychologist who performed WASI) in the
model did not substantially change the results (data not shown).
In the sensitivity analyses in which we excluded Cohort 3 partici-
pants who received the calcium supplement, we continued to
observe
a

association between MUFcr
and GCI
[0:5 mg=L increase in MUFcr associated with 3.67 lower GCI
(95% CI: −6:57, −0:77), n = 194]; and between MUFcr and IQ
[0:5 mg=L increase in MUFcr associated with 3.23-lower IQ
(95% CI: −5:88, −0:57), n = 136].
In sensitivity analyses in which we re-ran models that
included the 10 outliers with respect to fluoride exposure (for
each of seven participants already in our models, an additional
value of MUFcr [from a different trimester]; for three partici-
pants, a value of MUFcr that then allowed the participants to be
added to our models), the results did not change in any mean-
ingful way (data not shown). There were no outliers with
respect to cognitive outcomes.
Independent Influence of Child Fluoride Exposure
Finally, in models that focused on the cross-sectional relationship
between children’s exposure to fluoride (reflected by their spe-
cific gravity–adjusted urinary fluoride levels) and IQ score and
that contained the main covariates of interest, there was not a
clear, statistically significant association between contemporane-
ous children’s urinary fluoride (CUFsg) and IQ either unadjusted
or adjusting for MUFcr. A 0:5 mg=L increase in CUFsg was asso-
ciated with a 0.89 lower IQ (95% CI: −2:63, 0.85) when not
adjusting for MUFcr; and 0.77-lower IQ (95% CI: −2:53, 0.99),
adjusting for MUFcr (n = 189).
Discussion
In our study population of Mexican women and children, which
accounted for two of the three cohorts included in the
ELEMENT study, higher prenatal exposure to fluoride (as indi-
cated by average creatinine-adjusted maternal urinary fluoride
concentrations during pregnancy) was associated with lower GCI
scores in children at approximately 4 y old, and with lower Full-
Scale IQ scores at 6–12 y old. Estimates from adjusted linear
regression models suggest that mean GCI and IQ scores were
about 3 and 2.5 points lower in association with a 0:5 mg=L
increase in prenatal exposure, respectively. The associations with
GCI appeared to be linear across the range of prenatal exposures,
but there was some evidence that associations with IQ may have
been limited to exposures above 0:8 mg=L. In general, the nega-
tive associations persisted in sensitivity analyses with further
adjustment for other potential confounders, though the results of
sensitivity analyses were based on subsets of the population with
available data.
Overall, our results are somewhat consistent with the ecologi-
cal studies suggesting children who live in areas with high fluo-
ride exposure (ranging from 0.88 to 11:0 mg=L fluoride in water,
when reported) have lower IQ scores than those who live in low-
exposure or control areas (ranging from 0.20 to 1:0 mg=L fluo-
ride in water) (Choi et al. 2012) and with results of a pilot study
of 51 children (mean age 7 y) from southern Sichuan, China, that
reported that children with moderate or severe dental fluorosis
(60% of the study population) had lower WISC-IV digit span
scores than other children (Choi et al. 2015). A distinction is that
our study, which was longitudinal with repeated measures of ex-
posure beginning in the prenatal period, found associations with
respect to prenatal fluoride exposures.
To our knowledge, the only other study that is similar to ours
was only recently published. Valdez Jiménez et al. (2017) studied
the association of prenatal maternal urinary fluoride levels (not
corrected for dilution) and scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant
Development II among 65 children evaluated at age 3–15 mo (av-
erage of 8 mo). The mothers in their study had urinary fluoride
levels of which the means at each of the three trimesters of preg-
nancy (1.9, 2.0, 2:7 mg=L) were higher than the mean MUFcr
in our participants (0:88 mg=L) (Valdez Jiménez et al. 2017).
These levels of exposure were found to be associated with statis-
tically significantly lower scores on the Bayley Scales’ Mental
Development Index (MDI) score after adjusting for gestational
age, age of child, a marginality index, and type of drinking water
(Valdez Jiménez et al. 2017). By comparison, our study had
much longer periods of follow-up and larger sample sizes, con-
trolled for a much larger set of covariates and sensitivity varia-
bles, and used creatinine–corrected urinary fluoride measures
(which, by adjusting for urinary dilution effects, provides a more
reliable measure of internal fluoride exposure).
With respect to understanding the generalizability of our
findings to other populations, there are very few studies that
measured prenatal fluoride levels among women derived from
population-based samples. Gedalia et al. (1959) measured uri-
nary fluoride in multiple samples collected from each of 117
healthy pregnant women living in Jerusalem, where fluoride in
the water was approximate 0:50 mg=L, and reported mean lev-
els per person that ranged from 0.29 to 0:53 mg=L. However,
these analysis were not conducted utilizing modern analytical
techniques. In a study of 31 pregnant women living in Poland,
Opydo-Szymaczek and Borysewicz-Lewicka (2005) measured
urinary fluoride in healthy pregnant women patients of a mater-
nity hospital in Poland, where fluoride in the water ranged from
0.4 to 0:8 mg=L, and found a mean level of 0:65 mg=L for
women in their 28th week of pregnancy, 0:84 mg=L in their
33rd week, and 1:30 mg=L in healthy non-pregnant women of
similar age. This would suggest that the mothers in our study,
who had a mean MUFcr value of 0:90 mg=L, had fluoride expo-
sures slightly higher than prior-mentioned populations.
In terms of comparing our findings with other studies of flu-
oride (using urinary fluoride as a biomarkers of exposure) and
intelligence (i.e., those not involving prenatal exposures), of the
27 epidemiologic studies on fluoride and IQ reviewed by Choi
et al. in their 2012 meta-analysis, only 2 had measures of uri-
nary fluoride. Both were of urinary fluoride measures in chil-
dren (not pregnant mothers), and neither corrected for dilution
(either by correcting for urinary creatinine or specific gravity).
Of these two, in comparison with the urinary fluoride levels of
both our mothers (0:88 mg=L) and our children (0:82 mg=L),
the mean levels of children’s urinary fluoride were higher in
the non-fluorosis (1:02 mg=L) and high-fluorosis (2:69 mg=L)
groups found by Li et al. (1995) as well as the control
(1:5 mg=L) and high-fluorosis (5:1 mg=L) groups described by
Wang et al. (2007).
Among the limitations of our study are that we measured fluo-
ride in spot (second morning void) urine samples instead of 24-hr
urine collections. However, others have noted a close relationship
between the fluoride concentrations of early morning samples
and 24-hr specimens (Watanabe et al. 1994; Zohouri et al. 2006).
Another limitation relates to the potential differences in the distri-
bution of covariates over our study cohorts, raising the issue of
potential bias. In the analyses we conducted across cohorts, we
saw that, in comparison with Cohort 3, Cohort 2A clearly had
Environmental Health Perspectives
097017-10
 higher mean bone lead levels (p < 0:001) and possibly higher
blood mercury levels (p = 0:067). However, we saw no other dif-
ferences and the differences in these measures have a clear likely
explanation: Cohort 2A had bone lead levels measured in 1997–
2001 and Cohort 3 had bone lead levels measured in 2001–2005.
Given that environmental lead and mercury exposures were
steadily decreasing during this time interval (due to the phase-out
of lead from gasoline), this difference likely relates to an expo-
sure–time–cohort effect. We do not anticipate that this phenom-
enon would have introduced a bias in our analyses of fluoride and
cognition controlling for bone lead.
Another limitation relates to the missing data that pertain to
our covariate and sensitivity variables. In the comparisons of par-
ticipants in relation to missing data (Table 2A,B), the proportion
of females was somewhat higher in the included versus excluded
group for both the GCI and IQ analyses, and the mean levels of
maternal blood Hg for those included were 28.5% and 24.9%
higher than the mean levels for those excluded in the GCI and
IQ analyses, respectively. We also note that the coefficients for
the associations between fluoride on cognition varied substan-
tially in some of the sensitivity analyses, particularly with
respect to the subgroups of participants who have data on SES,
lead exposure, and mercury exposure (of which, for the latter,
the effect estimates almost doubled). We do not have a ready
explanation for this phenomenon, given that there is no
obvious way that each of the selection factors governing which
mothers had these measurements (discussed above) could have
influenced the fluoride–cognition relationship. Nevertheless, it
is not possible to entirely rule out residual confounding or in
the population as a whole (that might have been detected had
we had full data on larger sample sizes) or bias (should the
subpopulations that had the data for analysis have a different
fluoride–cognition relationship than those participants who
were excluded from the analyses).
Other limitations include the lack of information about iodine
in salt, which could modify associations between fluoride and
cognition; the lack of data on fluoride content in water given
that determination of fluoride content is not reported as part of
the water quality monitoring programs in Mexico; and the lack
of information on other environmental neurotoxicants such as
arsenic. We are not aware of evidence suggesting our popula-
tions are exposed to significant levels of arsenic or other known
neurotoxicants; nevertheless, we cannot rule out the potential
for uncontrolled confounding due to other factors, including
diet, that may affect urinary fluoride excretion and that may be
related to cognition.
Another potential limitation is that we adjusted maternal uri-
nary fluoride levels based on urinary creatinine, whereas we
adjusted children’s urinary fluoride levels based on urinary spe-
cific gravity; however, these two methods are almost equivalent
in their ability to account for urinary dilution. We also had no
data to assess the inter-examiner reliability of the testers admin-
istering the WASI test; however, the excellent reliability of
these same testers in administering the McCarthy tests provides
some reassurance that the WASI tests were conducted in a con-
sistent manner.
Finally, our ability to extrapolate our results to how exposures
may impact on the general population is limited given the lack of
data on fluoride pharmacokinetics during pregnancy. There are
no reference values for urinary fluoride in pregnant women in the
United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
has not included fluoride as one of the population exposures
measured in urine or blood samples in its nationally representa-
tive sampling. The WHO suggests a reference value of 1 mg=L
for healthy adults when monitoring renal fluoride excretion in
community preventive programs (Marthaler 1999). As part of
the NRC’s review of the fluoride drinking-water standard, it
was noted that healthy adults exposed to optimally fluoridated
water had urinary fluoride concentrations ranging from 0.62 to
1:5 mg=L.
Conclusion
In this study, higher levels of maternal urinary fluoride during
pregnancy (a proxy for prenatal fluoride exposure) that are in the
range of levels of exposure in other general population samples
of pregnant women as well as nonpregnant adults were associated
with lower scores on tests of cognitive function in the offspring at
4 and 6–12 y old.
Community water and salt fluoridation, and fluoride tooth-
paste use, substantially reduces the prevalence and incidence of
dental caries (Jones et al. 2005) and is acknowledged as a public
health success story (Easley 1995). Our findings must be con-
firmed in other study populations, and additional research is
needed to determine how the urine fluoride concentrations meas-
ured in our study population are related to fluoride exposures
resulting from both intentional supplementation and environmen-
tal contamination. However, our findings, combined with evi-
dence from existing animal and human studies, reinforce the
need for additional research on potential adverse effects of fluo-
ride, particularly in pregnant women and children, and to ensure
that the benefits of population-level fluoride supplementation out-
weigh any potential risks.
