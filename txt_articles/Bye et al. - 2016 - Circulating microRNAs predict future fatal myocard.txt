Abstract 
 
Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death, and the number of individuals at risk is 
increasing. To better manage this pandemic, improved tool for risk prediction, including more 
accurate biomarkers are needed. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of circulating 
microRNAs (miRs) to predict future fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in healthy participants. 
We performed a prospective nested case-control study with 10-year observation period and fatal 
AMI as endpoint. In total, 179 miRs were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 
serum of 112 healthy participants (40-70 years) that either (1) suffered from fatal AMI within 10 
years [n=56], or (2) remained healthy [n=56, risk factor-matched controls]. Candidate miRs were 
validated in a separate cohort of healthy individuals (n=100).  
Twelve miRs were differently expressed in cases and controls in the derivation cohort (p<0.05). 
Among these, 10 miRs differed significantly between cases and controls in the validation cohort 
(p<0.05). We identified gender dimorphisms, as miR-424-5p and miR-26a-5p were associated 
exclusively with risk in men and women, respectively. The best model for predicting future AMI 
consisted of miR-106a-5p, miR-424-5p, let-7g-5p, miR-144-3p and miR-660-5p, providing 77.6% 
correct classification for both genders, and 74.1% and 81.8% for men and women, respectively. 
Adding these 5 miRs to the Framingham Risk Score, increased the AUC from 0.72 to 0.91 
(p<0.001). 
In conclusion, we identified several miRs associated with future AMI, revealed gender-specific 
associations, and proposed a panel of 5 miRs to enhance AMI risk prediction in healthy individuals.

1. Background 
 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally, with >8 million deaths 
(16.8%) in 2013 compared to 5.7 million deaths (12%) in 1990 [1]. Although improved treatment 
strategies have reduced the mortality rate in the Western world during the last decade, the number 
of people at risk is continuously growing [2-5]. To better manage this pandemic, improved tools for 
risk prediction, including more accurate biomarkers are needed.  
Over the years, the knowledge of important risk factors has led to the development of several risk 
prediction models for determining 10-year risk of all types of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
more specifically also for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [6-11]. However, the general use of 
risk prediction models has decreased in the primary care setting because current risk prediction 
models only explain a modest proportion of the incidence. For AMI, it is estimated that 15-20% of 
the patients have none of the traditional risk factors and would be classified as “low risk” by the 
current risk prediction scores [12]. There have been several attempts during the last years to 
improve the risk prediction models by incorporating new biomarkers into the currently available 
risk algorithms [13-18]. For instance, incorporation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) into the Framingham risk score were shown to improve risk prediction for 
both genders [19-21]. However, despite extensive studies there are currently no biomarkers that 
adequately predict risk of developing AMI [22]. Thus, there is a clinical need for cardiovascular 
biomarkers that could complement the assessment of traditional risk factors, to identify the 
individuals at risk with greater precision than today. 
Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have emerged as potential biomarkers of disease, as small amounts of 
stable miRs can be detected in the circulation [23]. miRs are short, endogenous, single-stranded, 
non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression [24]. More than 2000 human miRs have 
so far been discovered, and their dysregulation have been associated with different pathologies like 
cancer and CVD [25-28]. miRs have large potential as diagnostic biomarkers in CVD, as studies 
have shown increased serum levels of miR-1 and miR-423 in patients with AMI and heart failure, 
respectively [29-33]. To our knowledge, only one study has previously explored the potential of 
circulating miRs as predictive biomarkers of AMI. In that study, which included participants with 
and without previous CVD (40-79 years old),  incorporation of the circulating levels of miR-126, 
miR-197 and miR-223 into the Framingham Risk Score improved net reclassification with ~ 17% 
[34].  
 
The large biobank established during the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), provides a unique 
opportunity to identify new biomarkers that can predict AMI, and to develop more accurate, 
gender-specific risk prediction models. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to assess the utility 
of circulating miRs to predict future fatal AMI in participants that were apparently healthy at the 
time of blood sampling.

2. Methods 
2.1 Design 
This study has a prospective nested case-control design with fatal AMI as endpoint (I21, ICD-10) 
and with 10-year follow-up. To increase the chance of finding new and independent biomarkers, the 
cases and controls were directly matched for traditional risk factors such as BMI, total cholesterol 
and HDL-C. The study was in conformity with Norwegian laws, the Declaration of Helsinki, and 
was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee (REK, 2011/136-3) and HUNT 
(2011/5014/MCS). 
 
2.2 Subjects 
Data collection in the HUNT studies were carried out in the Nord-Trøndelag County in Norway in 
three waves, the first in 1984–1986 (HUNT1), the second in 1995–1997 (HUNT2) and the third in 
2006–2008 (HUNT3). All inhabitants, ≥20 years in the county were invited to participate, with 
approximate overall participant rates in HUNT1, HUNT2 and HUNT3 of 88%, 70% and 56%, 
respectively. Information on anthropometry, blood pressure, blood lipids and glucose were 
measured. Participants also completed questionnaires about health status, lifestyle variables (e.g. 
physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption) and background variables (e.g. education, 
occupation, marital status) [35].  
In the derivation cohort, we included 112 apparently healthy men and women (40-70 years) 
attending the HUNT2 study, that either (1) suffered from fatal AMI within the 10 year follow-up 
(n=56), or (2) reported no cardiovascular events during the 10 year follow-up (n=56, risk factor-
matched controls). In a separate validation cohort, we included 100 apparently healthy men (n=56) 
and women (n=44) (40-70 years) from the HUNT2 study that either (1) suffered from fatal AMI 
within 10 years [n=50], or (2) reported no cardiovascular events during the 10 year follow-up 
[n=50, risk factor-matched controls]. Exclusion criteria were previous diagnosis of AMI, stroke, 
angina pectoris, diabetes, hypertension, severe obesity (BMI>35), cancer, rheumatic disease, 
hypo/hyperthyroidism, medication for these conditions, or other self-reported chronic medical 
conditions. A link was made between the HUNT2 Registry and the Cause of Death Registry at 
Statistics Norway to select the cases. Self-reported information of current or previous diseases 
reported in the HUNT3 study (collected 10 years after the HUNT2 study) were used to select 
controls that have remained healthy during the 10 years after HUNT2.      
 
2.3 Blood analysis 
Standard biochemical analyses were performed on fresh venous non-fasting blood samples at 
Levanger Hospital, Norway. Non-fasting glucose was analyzed by Hexokinase/G-G-PDH 
methodology reagent kit 3L82-20/3L82-40 Glucose (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA), 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by the Accelerator selective detergent methodology 
reagent kit 3K33-20 Ultra HDL (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA), and triglycerides by

Glycerol Phosphate Oxidase methodology reagent kit 7D74 Triglyceride (Abbott Diagnostics, 
Abbott Park, IL, USA). Serum creatinine was analyzed by Alkaline Picrate methodology kit 7D65-
20 Creatinine (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA). 
 
2.4 RNA isolation from serum 
Total RNA was extracted from serum using the miRCURY™ RNA isolation kit for biofluids 
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). 200 µl of serum was mixed with 60 µl of lysis solution containing 1 
µg carrier-RNA. An RNA spike-in kit was used for quality control of the RNA isolation and cDNA 
synthesis (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). The kit included the following synthetic RNA spike-ins: 
UniSp2, UniSp4, UniSp5, UniSp6 and cel-miR-39-3p, which allows the users to apply only the 
spike-ins needed for the particular study. 1 µL synthetic UniSp2 (2 fmole/µl), UniSp4 (0.02 
fmole/µl), UniSp5 (0.0002 fmole/µl) RNA spike-in mix was introduced per RNA sample. Briefly, 
the samples were vortexed and incubated for 3 min at room temperature, followed by the addition 
of 20 µL protein precipitation solution. The samples were vortexed, incubated for 1 min at room 
temperature and centrifuged at 11.000 rcf for 3 min. The clear supernatants were transferred to a 
new collection tubes with 270 µl isopropanol and the solutions were vortexed and loaded on 
binding columns. The columns were incubated for 2 min at room temperature and emptied using 
vacuum. In a stepwise procedure the columns were washed 3 times with wash solution, before the 
columns were spun at 11.000 rcf to dry completely. The dry columns were transferred to new 
collection tubes and 50 µl RNase free H2O was added directly on the membrane of the spin 
columns. The columns were incubated for 1 min at room temperature prior to centrifugation at 
11.000 rcf. The RNA was stored at -80°C. 
 
2.5 Circulating miR exploration 
2 µl RNA was reverse transcribed in 10 µl reactions using the miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT 
miR PCR, Polyadenylation and cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). 0.5 µl synthetic 
spike-in mix including UniSp6 (0.002 fmole/ µL) and cel-miR-39-3p (0.625 ng/ µl) was added to 
each RT reaction. cDNA was diluted 50 x and assayed in 10 µl PCR reactions according to the 
protocol for miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT miR PCR. Each miR was assayed once by qPCR on 
the miR Ready-to-Use PCR, using ExiLENT SYBR®Green master mix. We included negative 
controls that excluded the template from the reverse transcription reaction in the analyses. The 
amplification was performed in a LightCycler® 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland) in 384 well plates. The amplification curves were analyzed using the Roche LC 
software, both for determination of Cq (by the 2nd derivative method) and for melting curve 
analysis. For exploration, 179 miRs were analyzed using the Serum Focus miR PCR Panels 
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). The panels contain 7 reference genes for normalization and quality 
control, and assays for 5 synthetic RNAs in the RNA Spike-in kit (cel-miR-39-3p, UniSp2, UniSp4, 
UniSp5 and UniSp6) to monitor RNA purification and cDNA synthesis. Each panel also contains an 
inter-plate calibrator in triplicate and an empty negative control. For the validation cohort, 16 miRs 
were analyzed using the miR Pic-and-mix System (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark): 12 candidate miRs

144-3p, miR-148b-3p, miR-151a-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-660-5p), 2 potential endogenous reference 
miRs based on the previous derivation cohort (miR-191-5p, miR-425-5p), and 2 hemolysis miRs 
(miR-23a-3p, miR-451) [36].  
 
2.6 Data analysis 
The amplification efficiency was calculated using algorithms similar to the LinReg software. All 
assays were inspected for distinct melting curves and the Tm was checked to be within known 
specifications for the assay. Furthermore, we only considered miRs that had at least 3 Cq’s lower 
than the negative control and also Cq<37. Raw Cq values for the miRs selected for the validation 
cohort are shown in supplementary Table I. Data that did not pass these criteria were omitted from 
any further analysis. Cq was calculated as the 2nd derivative. NormFinder determined that the best 
strategy for normalization were the global mean. Hence, all data was normalized to the average of 
assays detected in all samples (average – assay Cq). In the validation cohort, we tested 
normalization to both the global mean, and to the levels of miR-425-5p, as the expression levels of 
the global mean and miR-425-5p were almost similar (Supplemental figure I). miR-425-5p has 
previously been found to be a stable expressed miR in other cohorts [36, 37]. After normalization of 
data to miR-425-5p or global mean, a ΔCq value is obtained (ΔCq). Differences in expression levels 
were calculated as ΔCq (cases) - ΔCq (controls) = ΔΔCq. To convert this to fold change, the formula 
2^ΔΔCq was used.  
 
 
2.7 Statistical analysis 
Data were analyzed using the statistical packages IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
USA), STATA version 12IC (StataCorp, Texas, USA) and R (R Development Core Team, USA). 
Paired sample t-tests were used to analyze differences in participant characteristics between those 
who developed MI during follow-up and those who remained healthy. Correlations between miRs 
were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients, and differently expressed miRs between cases 
and controls were identified using paired sample t-tests. Odds ratios were calculated using 
conditional logistic regression, and precision of estimates were reported as 95% confidence interval. 
A significance level of 0.05 was used if not otherwise stated. The set of miRs with the highest 
predictive ability for future MI were identified using best subset regression. Conditional logistic 
regression models were fitted for all possible subsets of the set of miRs found to be differentially 
expressed between cases and controls. The models were compared according to their values of the 
Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the model with the lowest AIC was selected. Classification 
into cases and controls based on the selected model was performed using a cut-off of 0.5 for the 
predicted probabilities. Predictive accuracy for miR-based models and addition of the miR-based 
prediction model to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) were assessed by calculating the area under 
the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) [38]. p values <0.05 were considered significant.

3. Results 
Baseline characteristics of the 212 participants are shown in Table 1. All participants were healthy 
at the time of blood sampling, but the cases suffered from fatal AMI within 1-10 years, whereas the 
matched controls remained healthy. No significant group differences in CVD risk factors were 
detected between the cases and matched controls (Table 1).

The miR isolation and quantification of the samples from the derivation and validation cohort were 
successfully accomplished, as controls and RNA spike-ins (UniSp2 and UniSp6) indicated good 
technical performance. None of the samples showed signs of being affected by hemolysis as 
measured by the miR-23a-3p/miR-451 ratio. Out of the 179 miRs analyzed in the derivation 
cohorts, 123 miRs were detectable in more than 90% of the samples, and 76 miRs were detected in 
all samples. We selected 12 miRs that were expressed in all samples and differed significantly 
between cases and controls (p<0.05) for validation in a separate cohort (Table 2). In the validation 
cohort, we tested two different approaches for normalization of miR levels; global mean 
normalization and normalization to the proposed endogenous reference, miR-425-5p. Both 
normalization strategies provided almost similar results, as the expression levels are highly 
correlated (Supplementary Figure I). In the following section, we chose to present the data 
normalized to the global mean. 
Ten of the 12 candidate miRs from the derivation cohort were found to differ significantly between 
cases and controls in the validation cohort (p<0.05). In addition, miR-144-3p was significantly 
different between women cases and controls. The fold-change difference in miR-level between 
cases and controls are shown in Figure 1. Sub-groups of those suffering from early (AMI within 0-5 
years) or late events (AMI within 6-10 years) are shown in Table 2. For the most significant miRs, 
the odds ratios per standard deviation higher miR level are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Risk estimates for acute myocardial infarction based on single microRNA-level. Odds ratio for fatal 
acute myocardial infarction within 10 years determined per standard deviation higher microRNA concentration with 
95% confidence interval in all participants and men and women separately. Only the most significantly differentially 
expressed microRNAs when comparing all participant or men and women separately are shown in this figure.  
 
There were significant correlations between the circulating levels of several miRs. Moderate 
correlations were observed between miR-106a-5p, miR-151a-5p, let-7g-5p and miR-26a-5p 
(correlation coefficients in the range of 0.42-0.70, p<0.0005 for all, Supplementary Table II). We 
also found significant negative correlations between miR-106a-5p, let-7g-5p, miR-26a-5p and age 
(correlation coefficients -0.22, -0.22, -0.26, respectively, p<0.01). Significant negative correlations 
were also seen between miR-151a-5p, miR-26a-5p and systolic BP (correlation coefficients -0.27, -
0.26, respectively, p<0.01). For the cases, we found correlation between miR-26a and years from 
blood sampling to AMI (0.34, p<0.05). We found no correlations between any miRs and indices of 
renal function (serum creatinine). The only miR that were differently expressed between genders 
were miR-660-5p, showing higher expression in men (p<0.05). 
To find the best combination of miRs for predicting future AMI, we used conditional logistic 
regression, testing all combinations of miRs in Table 2, except for miR-101-3p, that were found 
unrelated to future AMI in all participants, and men and women separately in the validation cohort. 
This resulted in 4095 possible combinations, and the model with the lowest AIC (Akaike 
Information Criterion) was miR-106a-5p, miR-424-5p, let-7g-5p, miR-144-3p and miR-660-5p

(AIC=47.1), providing 78% overall correct classification. The model was better for predicting AMI 
in women, providing 82 % overall correct classification. For men, the model provided 74 % overall 
correct classification. Addition of the 5 miRs identified by the best subset regression approach to a 
conditional logistic regression model that includes the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for hard CHD 
as an endpoint, increased the AUC from 0.72 (95% CI: [0.61, 0.82]) to 0.91 (95% CI: [0.85, 0.96]) 
(Δ0.19, p<0.001). The ROC-curves in Figure 3 illustrates the performance of the FRS alone and for 
a model including the 5 miRs identified in addition to the FRS for all participants, and men and 
women separately.

4. Discussion 
During the last years, several new biomarkers have been suggested as risk indicators of CVD, 
including CRP, natriuretic peptides, homocysteine, interleukin 6, and cardiac-specific troponins. 
However, their incremental predictive value beyond classic risk factors has been minor [15, 39, 40]. 
To increase the chance of identifying new biomarkers that are independent of and may add 
prognostic information to traditional risk factors, we designed this nested case-control study where 
cases and controls were directly matched on traditional risk factors. The nested case-control design 
is generally more efficient than a case-cohort design with the same number of selected controls 
[41]. Interestingly, several circulating miR differed significantly between individuals that 
subsequently suffered a fatal AMI and those that remained healthy during the 10-year follow-up 
period. Common features for several of these miRs are their relevance for the different steps of the 
atherosclerotic process [42-48]. 
miR-106a-5p was found to be a highly significant marker in both genders (p<0.01), and low levels 
were associated with increased risk for AMI. Low serum levels of miR-106a-5p have previously 
been reported in patients with acute heart failure [49]. Furthermore, the level of miR-106a-5p has 
previously been shown to decrease with age, which was also confirmed by our study [50]. A 
previous study has also linked this miR to the atherosclerotic process, as it was shown to be an 
important regulator of the macrophage inflammatory response [45].  
Another miR that was highly associated with risk for AMI in men was miR-424-5p. Interestingly, 
this miR is directly involved in the atherosclerotic development by driving the monocyte-to-
macrophage differentiation process [43]. The cholesterol-lowering drug ezetimibe has actually been 
shown to inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation through down-regulation of miR-424 and 
other miRs in the monocytes [43]. Several studies in experimental models show that miR-424-5p 
also is up-regulated in endothelial cells by vascular injury and by hypoxic conditions, as well as in 
the in the ischemic heart [51, 52]. Upregulation of miR-424-5p promotes down-stream processes 
associated with hypoxia, like angiogenesis and erythropoiesis to overcome perfusion deficits [52]. 
Circulating miR-424-5p has previously also been considered as a marker for inflammation, and 
high levels have been detected after a marathon race [53]. Despite small sub-groups, miR-424-5p 
seems to be more closely associated with early events (AMI that occurs 0-5 years from blood 
sampling) compared to later events (MI that occurs 6-10 years from blood sampling), but this has to 
be further investigated in larger populations.  
Interestingly, gender-specific association were observed between AMI-risk and miR-424-5p and 
miR-26a-5p. Gender differences in miR expression can often be explained by hormonal and genetic 
differences, as hormones and X-linked genes can influence the regulation of miRs [54]. However, 
there are just a few studies highlighting the role of miRs in sexually dimorphic disease [55, 56]. 
miR-424-5p is located at the X chromosome, and may potentially be among the 15% of X-linked 
genes that escape female X chromosome inactivation, causing higher expression in women [57]. 
However, no differences were found in miR-424-5p when comparing serum from men and women 
at baseline, independent of outcome.

Two members of the well-studied let-7 family, let-7d-5p and let-7g-5p, differed significantly 
between cases and controls in the validation cohort. Several studies have shown that let-7 family 
members have athero-protective effects. For instance, circulating levels of let-7i and let-7g-5p are 
decreased in patients with CHD and hypercholesterolemia, respectively [58, 59]. Furthermore, 
decreased let-7g-5p levels have been shown to impair endothelial function and to increase the risks 
of CVD through targeting TGF-β signaling [60].  
 
A common feature for several of the differentially expressed miRs (miR-26a-5p, miR-106a-5p, 
miR-144-3p and miR-148b-3p) are their mutual target, the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, 
member 1 (ABCA1) [46, 61-64]. ABCA1 is the major regulator of cellular cholesterol and 
fundamental to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. In our study, we found increased 
circulating levels of miR-144-3p in the participants that later suffered from fatal AMI. In apoE−/− 
mice increased levels of miR-144-3p in macrophage-derived foam cells inhibited cholesterol efflux, 
decreased circulating levels of HDL and impaired reverse cholesterol transport in vivo, thereby 
accelerating atherosclerosis [46, 48]. Increasing the levels of miR-144-3p, by mimics and agomirs, 
has been shown to enhance the expression of inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-
α, in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that miR-144-3p may be a potential therapeutic target 
of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown a positive correlation between 
circulating miR-144-3p and serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate 
aminotransferase in subjects with AMI [46]. 
Interestingly, we found none of the typically reported atherosclerosis-related miRs, as miR-126, 
miR-21, miR-92a, miR-19a, miR-221 and miR-222 (reviewed in [65]), to be associated with future 
AMI in our study. We believe the reason might, in part, be explained by the platform used for the 
miR analysis and also the choice of normalization method. To our knowledge, there is only one 
other study that previously has explored the value of circulating miRs for the prediction of future 
AMIs and this study showed an association between miR-126, miR-223, miR-197 and disease risk 
[34]. Of note, this study used another platform for miR analysis (Taqman qPCR assay) and 
normalized against U6 [34]. Several studies has in the last years concluded that U6 is not a suitable 
endogenous control for the quantification of circulating miRs [66, 67]. 
Based on the data in this study, we suggest using a combination of miR-106a-5p, miR-424-5p, let-
7g-5p, miR-144-3p and miR-660-5p to predict the risk for AMI. This model provided 77.6% correct 
classification for both genders, and 74.1% and 81.8% for men and women, respectively. When 
adding this miR-based model to the FRS for hard CHD as endpoint, we were able to significantly 
improve the model performance increasing the AUC from 0.72 to 0.91. This indicates that the miR-
model is an independent predictor of future AMI that may add predictive information to the 
traditional risk factors included in the FRS. However, caution should be made when interpreting 
these results due to the small and selected sample size. Further studies in larger populations are 
needed to determine the clinical potential of measure these miR in addition to the classical CVD 
risk factors.

Indeed, the stability of circulating miRs, their non-invasive sampling techniques and their proven 
dysregulation in CVD make them promising candidate biomarkers. An ideal predictive biomarker 
should allow for early identification of individuals at risk for a given outcome, and the biomarker 
should also be relatively easy to measure with acceptable costs. To be able to use miRs as 
biomarkers in the clinical setting, reliable measurement is essential. Since RT-qPCR is highly 
sensitive and specific and has a high reproducibility, this is the gold-standard method to quantify 
circulating miRs. To achieve reliable quantification of circulating miRs, possible processing 
variations between samples have to be corrected by normalization [68]. Many different methods for 
normalization of miR data have been suggested, but currently there is no consensus on the most 
appropriate method [69-71]. The 3 most commonly used normalization strategies include 
normalization to the global mean of all detected miRs, normalization to one or more stably-
expressed endogenous miRs, and the use of a synthetic or biologic spike-in [72, 73]. In this study, 
we tested both normalization using global mean and the endogenous miR-425-5p, since the latter 
has shown stable expression in previous studies [36, 37, 74]. The potential use of miR-425-5p as an 
endogenous miR was replicated in this study, as miR-425-5p was expressed close to the global 
mean in both the derivation and validation cohort. To our knowledge, no study has yet to report that 
circulating miR-425-5p levels are influenced by CVD, thus, miR-425 may represent a potential 
strategy for normalization of circulating miR levels. However, this needs to be further investigated 
in additional studies. Moreover, our results were obtained by the use of LNA-enhanced oligos and 
the platform by Exiqon, and should also be validated in other systems and platforms.   
A potential limitation of the study is that mean time to event were shorter in the derivation cohort 
compared to the validation cohort. However, shorter time to events in the validation cohort should 
mainly make replication more difficult in the validation cohort than lead to false positive 
associations between individual miRNAs and incident AMI in the second cohort. Accordingly, as 
we were able to validate most of the results from the derivation cohort in the validation cohort, we 
do not see that the differences in times to event between the two cohorts are responsible for our 
results. Furthermore, the lack of consensus on the most appropriate method for normalization 
represents a major limitation that may explain some of the confliction data reported in circulating 
miR studies.   
 
5. Conclusions 
Based on blood samples from 212 well-characterized healthy subjects, we identified and verified 
significant associations between the level of 10 different circulating miRs and subsequent fatal 
AMI. These miRs may represent independent new risk markers of future AMI, based on the risk 
factor-matched case-control design. The best prediction of AMI-risk was achieved using a 
combination of miR-106a-5p, miR-424-5p, let-7g-5p, miR-144-3p and miR-660-5p, providing 
77.6% correct classification for both genders, and 74.1% and 81.8% for men and women, 
respectively. When adding this miR-based model to the FRS, the model performance significantly 
improved. However, larger studies are needed to determine if these miRs can provide additional
