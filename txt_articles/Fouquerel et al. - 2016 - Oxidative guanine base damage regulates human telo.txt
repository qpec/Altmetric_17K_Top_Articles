Abstract
Changes in telomere length are associated with degenerative diseases and cancer. Oxidative stress 
and DNA damage have been linked to both positive and negative alterations in telomere length and 
integrity. Here we examined how the common oxidative lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-
deoxyguanine (8-oxoG) regulates telomere elongation by telomerase. When present in the 
deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool as 8-oxodGTP, telomerase utilization of the oxidized 
nucleotide during telomere extension is mutagenic and terminates further elongation. Depletion of 
the enzyme that removes oxidized dNTPs, MTH1, increases telomere dysfunction and cell death 
in telomerase positive cancer cells harboring shortened telomeres. In contrast, a pre-existing 8-
oxoG within the telomeric DNA sequence promotes telomerase activity by destabilizing G-
quadruplex structure in the DNA. We show that the mechanism by which 8-oxoG arises in the 
telomere, either by insertion of oxidized nucleotides or by direct reaction with free radicals,

 dictates whether telomerase is inhibited or stimulated and thereby, mediates the biological 
outcome.
Telomeres cap chromosome ends and are essential for genome stability, cell proliferation 
and human health. Dysfunctional critically short telomeres trigger cell senescence or 
apoptosis, which drives aging-related degenerative pathologies and loss of regenerative 
capacity1,2. Telomeres shorten progressively with cell division due to the “end replication 
problem”. To compensate, telomerase lengthens the telomeres by adding GGTTAG repeats3. 
In humans telomeres consist of approximately 1,600 TTAGGG duplex repeats and terminate 
in a single strand overhang4. Telomerase is expressed in human germ and stem cells, and is 
upregulated in 90% of cancers to enable continued cell proliferation4,5. Thus, telomerase 
regulation is a critical determinant of degenerative diseases and cancer.
Oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases including 
cancer, and results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and cellular antioxidant defenses. The G-rich content of TTAGGG repeats renders 
telomeres highly susceptible to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress accelerates telomere 
shortening6,7. ROS results from normal oxygen metabolism and environmental exposures, 
and is elevated at sites of chronic inflammation8,9. Free radical reaction with DNA generates 
chemical alterations, including the common lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanine (8-
oxoG). Oxidative lesions in telomeric DNA are associated with changes in telomere length 
and integrity6,7,10.
ROS also react with free nucleotide pools, and recent studies underscore the importance of 
oxidized deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) in regulating genome stability and cell 
survival. Free dNTPs are more susceptible to oxidation than duplex DNA11, and insertion of 
oxidized nucleotides into the genome during replication leads to mutations and cell 
death12–14. Nudix hydrolase 1 (NUTD1 or MTH1) converts 8-oxodGTP to 8-oxodGMP to 
prevent utilization during DNA synthesis15. MTH1 upregulation occurs frequently in various 
cancers16,17. Cancer cell lines are addicted to MTH1 due partly to dysfunctional redox 
regulation18,19, and are more sensitive to MTH1 inhibitors than normal cells14,17. However, 
the impact of oxidized dNTPs on telomere maintenance and integrity is unknown.
During base excision repair, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) removes 8-oxoG from 
the genome20 when the damaged base pairs with cytosine, but not when present in single 
stranded DNA or in G-quadruplex structures21. Remarkably, an unbiased screen in yeast for 
genes that alter telomere length revealed that ogg1 deletion strains have longer telomeres 
than wild type22, and this lengthening depends partly on telomerase23. Ogg1−/− mice also 
show longer telomeres in vivo, but culturing cells from these mice in pro-oxidant conditions 
induces accelerated telomere shortening10. Thus, changes in cellular oxidative state 
influence telomere length. This paradox of 8-oxoG in telomeres promoting telomere 
lengthening, whereas oxidative stress causes telomere shortening, suggests a level of 
complexity inherent in ROS-induced DNA damage that remains currently unresolved.
Here we examine how the oxidized base 8-oxoG regulates telomerase activity when present 
in either the telomeric overhang or within the dNTP pool. We show that 8-oxodGTP

 incorporation by telomerase is a chain terminator, thereby preventing telomere restoration 
and promoting cell death. In stark contrast, the presence of a pre-existing 8-oxoG in the 
telomeric overhang enhances telomerase activity by destabilizing the G-quadruplex structure 
in the folded overhang. Therefore, we demonstrate that 8-oxoG has a dual role in inhibiting 
or stimulating telomerase depending on whether the free dNTPs are oxidized and inserted 
during extension, or the telomeric DNA is oxidized directly by free radicals.
Results
8-oxodGTP insertion is a telomerase chain terminator
We tested whether telomerase can introduce an 8-oxoG into telomeric DNA via utilization of 
8-oxodGTP during telomere elongation. The protein component (TERT) catalyzes reverse 
transcription of an integral 11 nucleotide RNA template housed within the RNA component 
(TR) to add repeats to the overhang3. Fig. 1a summarizes the catalytic steps. 1) The 
overhang anneals to the RNA template to form a short DNA-RNA hybrid that primes TERT-
mediated DNA synthesis, 2) telomerase elongates the overhang governed by its template, 3) 
telomerase translocates and realigns with the template to prime synthesis, and 4) cycling 
back to elongation generates the characteristic 6-nt product pattern. The number of repeats 
added prior to telomerase dissociation defines processivity24.
To probe for 8-oxodGTP incorporation we used the standard telomerase substrate of three 
TTAGGG repeats (3R), and examined activity of immunopurified FLAG-tagged telomerase 
overexpressed in human HEK 293T cells. This well characterized super-telomerase extract 
exhibits similar kinetic properties as endogenous telomerase25. Reactions were conducted 
with widely used high dNTP concentrations and with cellular dNTP concentrations26. 
Utilizing cellular concentrations is biologically relevant and important because dNTP pool 
balance and concentrations affect the accuracy of DNA polymerases27. Telomerase was 
similarly processive with both dNTP mixes, but product yield was lower with the cellular 
dNTP mix as observed in reactions with 32P-α-dGTP (Supplementary Fig. 1). We switched 
to radiolabelled dTTP for reaction with 8-oxodGTP. Reactions with the high dNTP mix 
showed aberrant product termination after dTTP incorporation due to the imbalance with 
low dTTP. Never-the-less, increasing substitution of dGTP with 8-oxodGTP dramatically 
inhibited telomerase extension (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). The pattern of hexameric 
repeat addition was restored in reactions with the cellular dNTP mix, and inhibitory effects 
of 8-oxodGTP were even more obvious (Fig. 1b–c). Complete substitution of dGTP with 8-
oxodGTP generated a prominent band representing termination after incorporation opposite 
template U, and a weak band representing incorporation opposite rC. These data suggest that 
telomerase can incorporate 8-oxodGTP opposite rC, albeit poorly, and that further extension 
from an 8-oxodGTP:C base pair is greatly inhibited.
For the 3R substrate the first repeat addition occurs opposite rArArUrC prior to 
translocation, so if 8-oxodGTP is incorporated opposite rC, then further extension requires 
immediate translocation (Fig. 1a, step 3). Therefore, the problem may arise with 
translocation rather than extension. The GG(TTAGGG)2TTAG substrate allows for 8-
oxodGTP incorporation opposite cytosine (rCrCrArArUrC) and extension prior to 
translocation. Increasing substitution of 8-oxodGTP for dGTP led to dramatic telomerase

 inhibition, with no product detected in reactions lacking dGTP (Supplementary Fig. 2). This 
confirms that telomerase extension following 8-oxodGTPincorporation is highly 
unfavorable, and the lack of extension is not due to translocation inhibition.
Telomerase incorporation of 8-oxodGTP is mutagenic
DNA polymerases can insert 8-oxodGTP opposite cytosine or adenine, although steric 
clashes of 8-oxodGTP:C base pair favor insertion opposite A12,28. The accuracy of 
telomerase is not well established raising the possibility that incorporation opposite rC might 
have resulted from erroneous dATP, dTTP or dCTP insertion, rather than 8-oxodGTP. To 
definitively test whether telomerase can incorporate 8-oxodGTP, and whether this 
incorporation is error prone, we radiolabeled the primer and added increasing concentrations 
of only dGTP or 8-oxodGTP. Reaction with a single dNTP type is a well-established method 
for defining polymerase fidelity (i.e. selectivity for correct over incorrect or damaged 
dNTPs) and dNTP affinity29–31. Surprisingly, mutagenic incorporation opposite rA occurs 
even at low 5 μM dGTP, and run-on addition occurs at high dGTP (Fig. 2a). 8-oxodGTP 
shows significantly more (50%) misinsertion opposite rA compared to dGTP at 5 μM, but 
minimal extension to the next template rA even at high amounts (Figs. 2b–c). At low dNTP 
(5 μM) the total primers extended with 8-oxodGTP was statistically similar to extension 
with correct dTTP, but extension to the next rA was significantly higher for dTTP compared 
to mutagenic dGTP or 8-oxodGTP (Figs. 2b–c). All products (one nucleotide added and 
longer) require incorporation opposite the first rA. Next, we tested incorporation opposite 
two adjacent template rCs. Again, we observed run-on addition of dGTP incorporation 
beyond rC, but poor incorporation and extension with 8-oxodGTP and mutagenic dATP 
(Figs. 2d–f). These data indicate that telomerase can utilize 8-oxodGTP during DNA 
synthesis, but that it preferentially misincorporates 8-oxodGTP opposite rA versus rC, and 
that further extension is greatly inhibited.
Telomere dysfunction due to oxidized dNTPs
Elevating oxidized dNTPs via MTH1 depletion or inhibition causes 8-oxoG incorporation 
into the genome and cell death or senescence14,32. Cancer cells are thought to exhibit greater 
sensitivity to MTH1 inhibition compared to normal cells due to a higher pro-oxidant state, 
but another notable difference is that most cancer cell lines depend on telomerase for 
proliferation5. Since 8-oxodGTP is a telomerase chain terminator, we reasoned that cancer 
cells with critically short telomeres would be the most vulnerable to telomerase inhibition. 
To test this, we depleted MTH1 in HeLa LT cells harboring long telomeres (~27 kb) and 
HeLa VST cells possessing very short telomeres (~3.7 kb)33,34 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). 
Transduction of the cells with lentivirus expressing two distinct shRNAs targeting MTH1 
(sh4 and sh5), followed by selection with puromycin, suppressed MTH1 expression by ~80 
to 90% (Fig. 3a). MTH1 depletion increased nuclear 8-oxoG staining in both cell lines 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c) consistent with previous reports14,32. This shows an increase in 
total cellular 8-oxoG levels in nucleotide pools and incorporation into DNA.
While oxidized dNTPs significantly inhibited proliferation of the HeLa VST cells, the HeLa 
LT were largely unaffected (Fig. 3b). The difference in sensitivity was not due to differences 
in expression of the ROS-scavenging enzymes catalase or SOD (Supplementary Fig. 3b).

 Decreased proliferation was due to apoptosis as indicated by elevated annexin V staining 
and caspase 3 cleavage in the MTH1 depleted HeLa VST cells, relative to controls, which 
continued to day 6 post infection (Fig. 3c–e and Supplementary Fig. 4a–b). In contrast, 
MTH1 depletion in HeLa LT cells did not induce apoptosis compared to controls (Fig. 3c–e 
and Supplementary Fig. 4a–b).
Next we examined whether elevating oxidized dNTPs impacts telomere integrity. MTH1 
depletion significantly increased 53BP1 foci formation in HeLa VST cells, as reported for 
other cell lines14,32, but not in HeLa LT cells (Figs. 4a–c). 53BP1 is a DNA damage 
response protein that localizes to DNA double strand breaks or dysfunctional telomeres, 
therefore, 53BP1 foci at telomeres are often referred to as TIFs (telomere dysfunction 
induced foci)35. MTH1 depletion in HeLa VST cells induced a 6-fold increase in cells 
displaying three or more TIFs and in the average TIFs per nuclei, whereas HeLa LT cells 
were unaffected (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 3e). The number of TIFs in HeLa VST is 
likely underestimated given that their very short telomeres are difficult to visualize. MTH1 
depletion did not induce obvious TRF2 displacement from the telomeres compared to 
controls (Supplementary Fig. 3d), consistent with a lack of induced telomere fusions (Fig. 
4d). Rather, MTH1 depletion significantly increased chromatids lacking telomere staining 
(signal free ends) in HeLa VST cells compared to controls, but not in HeLa LT cells (Fig. 
4e). MTH1 depletion also increased fragile telomeres, manifested as chromatid ends 
containing multiple telomeric signals, in the HeLa VST cells (Fig. 4d–e). Interestingly, the 
control HeLa VST cells showed more signal free ends (or critically short telomeres) 
compared to HeLa LT, but the control HeLa LT cells contained more fragile telomeres. The 
latter may be related to reduced occupancy of TRF1 in cells with very long telomeres36, 
since TRF1 prevents telomere fragility by promoting replication37. We passaged survivors 
from MTH1 depletion to test for effects on telomere shortening rates, but found MTH1 
expression recovered to about 30% in both cell lines, and almost completely in the sh5 HeLa 
VST (Supplementary Fig. 3f). This suggests strong selective pressure for MTH1 activity 
upon continued passaging at 20% oxygen. Our results indicate that in telomerase expressing 
cancer cells, the presence of shortened telomeres influences sensitivity to the adverse effects 
of oxidized dNTPs on cell survival and telomere integrity.
To further examine a role for telomerase activity in mediating sensitivity to oxidized dNTPs, 
we compared in side-by-side experiments MTH1 depletion in primary BJ skin fibroblasts to 
BJ-hTERT fibroblasts that express exogenous telomerase. Consistent with previous work, 
we find that MTH1 depletion primarily induces cell senescence in fibroblasts, rather than 
apoptosis32 (Supplementary Figs. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, the BJ-hTERT 
cells were more sensitive compared to the telomerase negative BJ cells, as evidenced by a 
greater induction of senescence associated beta-galatosidase activity and p53 expression, and 
reduction in cell proliferation compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 5). These data 
suggest that telomerase activity modulates cellular sensitivity to oxidized dNTPs.
Telomerase extension from a pre-existing 8-oxoG terminus
8-oxoG can arise in the telomeric overhang by telomerase incorporation of 8-oxodGTP or by 
direct free radical reaction with guanines in the overhang. We tested whether telomerase can

 extend an overhang with a pre-existing terminal 8-oxoG by using substrates of three (3R) 
and four (4R) TTAGGG repeats with a 3′ G or 8-oxoG (Fig. 5a). Telomeric overhangs in 
cells consist of 8–30 repeats, and thus, can fold into G-quadruplex (GQ) structures which 
impede telomerase loading38–41. The 3R substrate lacks sufficient sequence to form GQ and 
allows testing for 8-oxoG effects in the absence of structure, whereas the 4R substrate 
enables testing for 8-oxoG effects in the context of biologically relevant structure. The 
terminal 8-oxoG substitution in 3R minimally impacted telomerase processivity and total 
activity (Fig. 5), in stark contrast to experiments with 8-oxodGTP (Fig. 1). Telomerase also 
extends 3R primers when the terminal 8-oxoG aligns with rA in the template, with no 
significant decrease in efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). These data suggest that a pre-
existing terminal 8-oxoG does not impair telomerase loading. The 4R substrate is poorly 
extended by telomerase due to stable GQ folding (Fig. 5a). Remarkably, the presence of a 
single 8-oxoG caused a dramatic restoration of processivity and activity compared to the 
unmodified 4R substrate (Figs. 5a–c). These data show that a pre-existing terminal 8-oxoG 
minimally affects overhang annealing to the telomerase template in the absence of structure, 
but greatly enhances telomerase loading on the GQ forming substrate.
Use of the 4R substrate revealed a prominent band migrating coincidently with an 
unextended 4R molecule that was not visible for the 3R substrate due to overlap with the 
loading control (Fig. 5a, arrow). This product resulted from telomerase extension of a 
degraded oligonucleotide shortened to (TTAGGG)3TTA. This suggests that with a terminal 
8-oxoG:rC base pair the enzyme is in a non-productive extension complex that promotes the 
reverse polymerase reaction, as described for HIV-RT42. The telomerase preparations lack 
detectable contaminating exonuclease (Supplementary Fig. 7a). However, we observed 
enhanced degradation products on primers terminating in 8-oxoG compared to unmodified 
primers in telomerase reactions containing only dGTP (Supplementary Fig. 7b–c). This 
agrees with our results that extension following 8-oxodGTP incorporation opposite rC is 
unfavorable (Fig. 1). Primer degradation also occurred, but was not enhanced, when the 
primer 8-oxoG aligned with template rA (Supplementary Fig. 6d–e). This agrees with 
increased efficiency of telomerase 8-oxodGTP incorporation opposite rA versus rC (Fig. 2), 
and suggests the 8-oxoG:rC base pair is more distorting in the telomerase active site 
compared to 8-oxoG:rA.
8-oxoG restores telomerase activity by disrupting G-quadruplex structure
Primer degradation and removal of the pre-existing terminal 8-oxoG (Fig. 5), complicates 
interpretation of an 8-oxoG role in telomerase loading and extension. To circumvent this we 
prepared 3R and 4R substrates with 8-oxoG substituted for the middle G of the last repeat. 
Primer degradation products were not observed, indicating the 8-oxoG remained intact and 
the adjacent terminal G:rC base pair was efficiently extended (Fig. 6a, lanes 5 and 8). For 
the 3R substrate, the middle 8-oxoG did not affect processivity, but decreased relative 
activity under cellular dNTP conditions (Figs. 6b–c). Telomerase was less sensitive to 8-
oxoG with the artificially high dNTPs. These studies indicate that a middle 8-oxoG may 
alter optimal telomerase annealing with the 3R overhang, but does not interfere with 
extension from the G:rC base pair.

 Similar to the terminal 8-oxoG, a middle 8-oxoG in the GQ forming substrate (4R) 
dramatically restored processive elongation, and significantly increased telomerase activity 
compared to the unmodified substrate (Fig. 6a–c). We obtained the same result when an 8-
oxoG was inserted in the second telomeric repeat, distal from alignment with the RNA 
template (Fig. 6d). To determine the mechanism for enhanced activity, we used a single 
molecule approach that enables probing of the GQ structure with high spatial, temporal and 
molecular resolution. Bulk phase biochemical studies indicate that telomeric DNA with 8-
oxoG can fold into GQ, but the lesion reduces the GQ melting temperature21,43. We 
prepared a single molecule fluorescence energy transfer (smFRET) reporter of telomeric GQ 
folding39. The two dyes located at both ends of the GQ forming DNA segment with four 
TTAGGG repeats yielded a high FRET peak of 0.8 in 100 mM KCl, indicative of compact 
GQ folds (Fig. 7a)39,44. However, the FRET peaks for the molecules with a middle 8-oxoG 
in the terminal repeat shifted to a lower value, indicating a less tightly folded state (Fig. 7b). 
Representative single molecule traces of the 4R substrate display stable high FRET, whereas 
approximately 25% of the 8-oxoG molecules exhibit FRET fluctuations indicating structural 
dynamics (Fig. 7c). Dwell time based on δt collected from over three hundred smFRET 
traces revealed a t1/2 of 8 seconds (Fig. 7d). To test accessibility of the substrates we applied 
a (CCCTAA)4 complementary oligonucleotide, and found this shifted the FRET histogram 
to a low FRET peak for the 4R 8-oxoG substrate, but not for the unmodified substrate (Figs. 
7e–f). These studies strongly suggest that 8-oxoG restores telomerase activity on GQ 
forming substrates by destabilizing the structure, thereby increasing telomerase accessibility 
and loading.
Discussion
The excess of free radicals under oxidative stress conditions elevates oxidation of DNA and 
of the free nucleotide pools. Here we demonstrate that 8-oxoG can arise in telomeres by 
telomerase incorporation of 8-oxodGTP, in addition to the established mechanism of 
telomeric DNA reaction with free radicals45. Our studies reveal a dual role for 8-oxoG in 
regulating telomerase elongation of telomeres (Fig. 7g). We propose that this duality leads to 
the paradoxical observations that under normoxic conditions unrepaired 8-oxoG lesions 
promote telomere lengthening, whereas oxidative stress and pro-oxidant conditions promote 
telomere dysfunction or shortening6,10.
We demonstrate that 8-oxodGTP promotes chain termination following insertion by 
telomerase. This result infers that perturbations at the primer terminus after damaged 
nucleotide incorporation prevent alignment of the catalytic groups to support subsequent 
insertion and extension. Mechanistic insight into the structural changes within the active site 
can be gained from DNA polymerase studies that utilized 8-oxoG in the template or an 8-
oxodGTP inserted at the primer termini. These crystallographic studies indicate that 8-oxoG 
promotes adverse changes to the nucleoside sugar pucker and phosphate backbone arising 
from the clash at the adducted oxygen (O8). Insertion of 8-oxodGTP leads to an overall 
instability at the primer terminus and a loss of base pairing interactions12. The changes 
likely promote misalignment of the primer terminus following 8-oxodGTP insertion, which 
then inhibits extension. This phenomena is the basis of chain terminating analogs, which 
also inhibit telomerase46.

 The result that telomerase could extend a primer with a pre-existing terminal 8-oxoG (Fig. 
5) was surprising, given that 8-oxodGTP incorporation is chain terminating (Fig. 1). There 
are several explanations. First, previous studies reported a telomerase associated nuclease 
can remove 3′ blocking nucleotides, possibly by the reverse polymerase reaction known as 
pyrophosphoroylsis as described for HIV-RT42,47,48. The appearance of an extended 
degraded primer for substrates containing a terminal 8-oxoG (Fig. 5), suggests removal of 
the blocking nucleotide prior to telomerase elongation in reactions with normal dNTPs. 
However, if this nuclease removes 8-oxodGMP after incorporation, the presence of 8-
oxodGTP in the reaction would allow re-incorporation, setting up a futile cycle. Detection of 
nuclease activity depends on telomerase ability to elongate the substrate47,48 
(Supplementary Figs. 6–7), suggesting these activities are tightly linked. Second, telomerase 
primer utilization may be more flexible than dNTP utilization. Previous work showed 
telomerase elongates a primer with 3′ non-telomeric sequence or a 3′dideoxynucleotide, but 
terminates following ddNTP incorporation47,48. This is highly reminiscent of our result that 
telomerase elongates primers with a 3′ 8-oxoG, but fails to extend following 8-oxodGTP 
incorporation. The earlier studies provide evidence for a conserved telomerase endonuclease 
activity that can cleave primers47,48.
The observation that 8-oxoG incorporation terminates telomerase elongation makes several 
predications about the impact of elevating oxidized dNTPs on telomere integrity. First, this 
should inhibit telomere maintenance. Following MTH1 depletion, the HeLa VST cells 
showed an average of 3.5 telomeric foci colocalized with 53BP1 (Supplementary Fig. 3e), 
which is impressive considering telomeres in these cells are less than 0.005% of the genome. 
The TIFs are likely underestimated given that very short telomeres are difficult to detect. In 
agreement, MTH1 depletion also increased telomere loss in HeLa VST cells (Figs. 4d–e). 
While reliable methods for precisely measuring 8-oxodGTP levels are lacking, even trace 
amounts of 8-oxodGTP (<1% of dGTP) cause DNA polymerase γ to generate mutations49. 
Replicative polymerases have much lower error rates (~10−6) than telomerase (~10−3)50,51, 
and the observation that high fidelity polymerases utilize 8-oxodGTP in cells16,28 predicts 
that telomerase will as well. Second, MTH1 depletion should accelerate telomere 
shortening. Unfortunately, the recovery of MTH1 expression during continued cell culturing 
precluded the ability to determine effects on telomere shortening, and attests to selective 
pressure for MTH1 expression during passaging at 20% oxygen. Third, the deleterious 
effects of MTH1 depletion should depend partly on telomerase activity. BJ-hTERT 
fibroblasts are more sensitive than telomerase deficient BJ cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). 
Previous studies also reported that telomerase deficient primary cells were less sensitive to 
MTH1 inhibitors than cancer cell lines, which were almost all telomerase positive14. Tumors 
frequently have shortened telomeres despite the presence of telomerase52. Whether the 
telomerase negative U2OS cancer cell line, which maintains telomeres by ALT (alternative 
lengthening of telomeres), is sensitive to MTH1 inhibitors is controversial14,53. Collectively, 
these studies indicate that dependence on robust telomerase activity, may partly explain why 
cancer cells are more sensitive to oxidized dNTPs than normal cells.
The finding that cancer cells with short telomeres are more sensitive to MTH1 depletion 
than cells with long telomeres, suggests a difference in the dependence on telomerase 
activity for short-term viability. In agreement, previous studies found that cancer cells with

 short telomeres were more sensitive to telomerase inhibition, compared to cancer cells with 
long telomeres, and that apoptosis induction was rapid within 2–4 days41,54, similar to 
MTH1 depletion in HeLa VST cells. This timing is insufficient to allow enough cell 
divisions for significant telomere shortening, supporting the model that cells with short 
telomeres are replicating with critically short telomeres and require telomerase activity at 
each cycle for viability54. In agreement, control HeLa VST cells have more telomeric signal 
free ends compared to HeLa LT (Fig. 4e). Similar to our results with MTH1 depletion, 
treating telomerase positive cancer cells with the analog 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-
dG) also induces rapid cell death and acute telomere dysfunction55. Normal telomerase 
deficient cells are less sensitive to 6-thio-dG, similar to oxidized dNTPs14,55. Collectively, 
these results indicate that cancer cells with limited telomere reserves are vulnerable to acute 
telomerase inhibition by the incorporation of chain-terminating nucleotides.
Our result that 8-oxoG destabilizes G-quadruplex in the telomeric overhang and enhances 
telomerase accessibility (Figs. 5–7), offers an explanation for the findings that unrepaired 8-
oxoG lesions in OGG1 deficient mice and yeast promote telomere lengthening in vivo or 
cell culturing at 3% oxygen10,23. Although OGG1 cannot remove 8-oxoG in single stranded 
DNA, it can when the overhang pairs with duplex DNA in the t-loop/D-loop structure56. 
Interestingly, culturing the OGG1 deficient cells at 20% oxygen promotes telomere 
shortening and aberrations10, suggesting in pro-oxidant conditions MTH1 levels in normal 
cells is insufficient to sanitize dNTP pools32. Our studies indicate that the elevated oxidized 
dNTPs caused by oxidative stress likely contributes to telomere shortening in the OGG1 
deficient cells cultured under pro-oxidant conditions, and overrides any benefits of 8-oxoG 
destabilization of telomeric G-quadruplex.
Our results indicate that in addition to MTH1 addiction, cancer cells with short telomeres 
may also be highly dependent on telomerase for viability and telomere stability in the short 
term. In contrast, cancer cells with long telomeres are largely insensitive to elevated oxidized 
dNTPs and MTH1 depletion. While incorporation of oxidized nucleotides might also impact 
shelterin binding or t-loop assembly, such effects are inconsistent with the lack of sensitivity 
to MTH1 depletion observed in HeLa cells with long telomeres. Thus, the analysis of 
telomere length in telomerase positive tumors may predict which tumors would be 
responsive to MTH1 inhibition. A recent study reported that human U2OS and SW480 cell 
lines were insensitive to MTH1 depletion53, further suggesting that numerous cellular 
factors influence sensitivity to oxidized dNTPs. For example, MTH1 depletion in cells 
expressing oncogenic RAS suppresses transformation and tumorigenesis17,57. Finally, 
antioxidant therapy promotes metastasis of human melanoma in mouse models, suggesting 
that oxidative stress may inhibit metastatic progression in vivo58. Our studies provide 
evidence that oxidative stress-induced damage of dNTP pools inhibits the ability of 
telomerase to maintain telomeres for sustained proliferation of malignant cells harboring 
critically short telomeres.

 ONLINE METHODS
Cell culture and lentiviral infection
HEK-293T cells, BJ skin fibroblasts (CL-5222) and BJ-5ta skin fibroblasts expressing 
hTERT (CRL-4001) were from ATCC, and HeLa VST and HeLa LT cells were a generous 
gift from Dr. Roderick O’Sullivan (University of Pittsburgh). Cells were cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in humidified 
chambers with 5% CO2 and 20% O2. The Gibco FBS was replaced with characterized FBS 
from Hyclone for culturing BJ and BJ-hTERT cells. Mycoplasma testing is done routinely 
by DAPI staining, and followed up PCR assay when required (VenorTM GeM Mycoplasma 
Detection Kit, Sigma-Aldrich). MTH1 knock down cell lines were established by overnight 
transduction with lentivirus expressing shRNAs (sh4 or sh5) targeting MTH1 transcript or a 
non-targeting scramble shRNA (scr). Selection of transducted cells was performed with 1.5 
μg/ml puromycin (HeLa VST and HeLa LT) or 0.75 μg/ml puromycin (BJ and BJ-hTERT) 
after 24 h recovery. Lentiviral particles were generated by co-transfection of 4 plasmids 
[Control plasmid (pLKO.1-SCRshRNA-Puro) or one of the five different MTH1-specific 
shRNA expressing plasmids, pLKO.1-shRNA-MTH1.1 - MTH1.5) together with pMD2.g 
(VSVG), pVSV-REV and pMDLg/pRRE] into 293-FT cells using TransIT-X2® Dynamic 
Delivery System (Mirus Bio LLC) with support from the University of South Alabama 
Mitchell Cancer Institute (USA/MCI) Gene Expression, Editing and Discovery (GEED) 
Lab. The lentivirus were further concentrated with a Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech) as per 
the manufacturers instructions. Five different shRNAs targeting the MTH1 gene were 
initially screened and Clone IDs (sh#4) NM_002452.3-96s1c1 and (sh#5) 
NM_002452.3-96s21c1 (Sigma) were the most effective (data not shown). The collection 
and isolation of lentiviral particles and transduction of cells described in the text was 
performed as described previously59.
Telomerase preparation
Telomerase was immunopurified as previously described39. Cells expressing hTR and 
3xFLAG-tagged hTERT were harvested 48 hours after transfection and lysed in CHAPS 
lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 5 
mM β-mercaptoethanol, 120 U RNasin plus (Promega), 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, aprotinin, 
leupeptin and chymostatin, and 1 mM AEBSF) for 30 min at 4°C. Sigma Anti-FLAG M2 
affinity gel agarose beads (75 μl of a 1:1 slurry) were pre-washed with 1x human telomerase 
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM spermidine, 5 mM β-
mercaptoethanol) with 30% glycerol and mixed with 500 μl of cell lysate for 3 hours at 4°C 
with rotation. Beads were harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 1 min, washed three 
times with 1x telomerase buffer with 30% glycerol, flash frozen as a 1:1 slurry in 1x 
telomerase buffer with 30% glycerol, and stored at −80°C.
Telomerase activity assay
Telomerase overexpression in HEK-293T cells was achieved by transient transfection with 
plasmids expressing hTR and 3xFLAG-tagged hTERT (gift from Thomas Cech, University 
of Colorado). Cells were grown to 90% confluency and transfected using Lipofectamine

 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen), and telomerase was immunopurified as previously described39. 
Unmodified oligonucleotides were from IDT and oligonucleotides with 8-oxoG were from 
Midland Certified Reagents Company (Supplementary Table 1). The telomerase assay was 
as previously described39,60. Briefly, reactions (20 μl) contained 1x human telomerase 
buffer, 1 μM oligonucleotide substrate, 0.3 μM of 3,000 Ci/mmol 32P-α-dGTP or 32P-α-
dTTP (Perkin Elmer) and dNTP (Invitrogen) mix as indicated in the figure legend. Reaction 
with high dNTPs contained either (500 μM dTTP, 500 μM dATP, 2.9 μM dGTP and 0.3 
μM 32P-α-dGTP) or (500 μM dGTP, 500 μM dATP, 2.9 μM dTTP and 0.3 μM 32P-α-dTTP). 
Reaction with cellular dNTPs contained 37 μM dTTP, 24μM dATP, 29 μM dCTP, 5.2 μM 
dGTP and 0.3 μM 32P-α-dGTP or 32P-α-dTTP as indicated. Reactions containing 8-
oxodGTP (TriLink Biotechnologies) substituted for dGTP are indicated in the figure 
legends. For reaction with end-labeled primers, the primers were labeled with 32P-γ-ATP 
(Perkin Elmer) and 10 U Optikinase (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. 
Reactions contained 1x telomerase buffer, 5 nM of 32P end-labeled primer, and cellular 
dNTP mix or either dGTP, 8-oxodGTP, dTTP or dATP (5.2 μM, or 50 μM or 500 μM) as 
indicated in the figure legend. Reactions were started by adding 6 μl of immunopurified 
telomerase slurry, incubated for 1 hr at 30°C, and then terminated with 2 μl of 0.5 μM EDTA 
and heat inactivated at 65°C for 20 min. For reactions with unlabeled primers, 8.0 fmol 
of 32P end-labeled loading control (LC) was added to the inactivated reaction prior to 
purification with an Illustra microspin G-25 column (GE Healthcare). After adding equal 
volume of loading dye the samples were heat denatured and then loaded onto a 10% 
denaturing acrylamide gel (8M urea, 1x TBE) for electrophoresis. Samples were imaged 
using a Typhoon phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). Telomerase processivity and relative 
telomerase activity was quantitated using ImageQuant and normalized to the LC as 
described60. For reactions with end-labeled primers the products were quantitated with 
ImageQuant by measuring the intensity of each product band and dividing by the total 
radioactivity in the lane.
Annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assay
The assay was conducted using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Abcam) 
according to the manufacturer’s directions. Cells were seeded at 4×105 cells in 60 mm 
dishes at least 24 hours prior to infection with lentivirus. On day three post lentiviral 
infection cells were trypsinized and counted. 3×105 cells were harvested by centrifugation 
for 5 min at 1,200 rpm, and then washed once with PBS. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl 
binding buffer (provided in the kit) containing 5 μl Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of propidium 
iodide (50 μg/ml). Cells were incubated in the dark for 5 min at room temperature. FL1 and 
FL2 emission was measured using a Accuri C6 flow cytometer after applying color 
compensation.
Western blots
Cells were resuspended in 400mM NaCl buffer and whole cell extracts were prepared by 
freeze and thaw cycles followed by 15 min centrifugation at 14000 rpm. Protein amounts 
were measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma). MTH1 (1:5000, Abcam), β-actin (1:10,000, 
Sigma), caspase 3 (1:500, Cell Signaling), SOD (1:2000, Abcam, ab13498), catalase 
(1:2000, Abcam, ab16731) and p53 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, DO-1) antibodies were used.

 Immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization
Cells were grown on Mattek glass bottom dishes and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min 
at room temperature, except for TRF2 immuno-staining cells were fixed on ice in 2% 
formaldehyde. After three PBS washes, cells were washed three times for 5 min each in PBS 
containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked for 1 hour in blocking solution (10% goat 
serum, 1% BSA in PBS). Mouse monoclonal 53BP1 antibody (1:500 dilution, Millipore) or 
TRF2 monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution, 4A794.15, Novus) was added and incubated at 
4°C overnight. For the HeLa VST cells the 53BP1 antibody mix also contained the rabbit 
RAP1 polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Bethyl laboratories), to amplify the telomere 
signal. Cells were washed in PBS three times for 10 min each at room temperature with mild 
shaking and incubated with secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, anti-mouse Alexa 594 for 
HeLa LT, a mix of anti-mouse Alexa 594 and anti-rabbit Alexa488 for HeLa VST, or 1:500 
dilution, anti-mouse Alexa 594 for TRF2 immuno-staining) for 1 hour. After three PBS 
washes, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (v/v) at −20°C for 10 min or in 2% 
formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature for TRF2 immuno-staining, and dehydrated in 
70%, 90% and 100% ethanol for 5 min. 100 mg/ml telomeric PNA probe (H2N-Lys-
(AATCCC)3-FITC, PNA Innovations61) was diluted 1:500 in hybridization buffer (70% 
formamide, 10mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1x Maleic Acid buffer, 1x MgCl2 buffer) and boiled for 
5 min at 95°C. Samples were incubated for 10 min on a hot plate at 75°C and then at room 
temperature for 2 h in the dark. After two washes in hybridization wash buffer (70% 
formamide, 10mM Tris HCl pH 7.5), slides were mounted with antifade gold containing 
DAPI. Imaging acquisition was performed with Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence microscope. 
Z stacks of 0.2 μm thickness were captured and images were deconvolved using NIS 
Elements Advance Research software algorithm. Widefield imaging with deconvolution, in 
this case using blind, interative methods, offered the advantage of minimizing signal loss 
and was critical for imaging the dim shortened telomeres in the HeLa VST cells.
Chromosome metaphase preparation and telomere FISH
Telomere FISH of metaphase chromosome preparations was carried out as described 
previously. Briefly, three days following lentiviral transduction, cells were treated with 0.05 
μg/ml colcemid for 2 hours. Cells (1 × 106 at a density of 1 × 105 cell/ml) were harvested 
and incubated with 75 mM KCl hypotonic buffer for 7 min at 37°C, following by fixation in 
methanol acetic acid (3:1). Samples were stored at −20°C. Lysed cells were dropped onto 
water-coated glass microscope slides and dried at room temperature overnight. The slides 
were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde, washed with PBS and then treated with 0.25 mg/ml 
RNaseA for 15 min at 37°C. Next the slides were incubated with 1 mg/ml Pepsin in 0.01 N 
HCl for 15 minutes at 37 °C. Fixation and washing were repeated. Slides were then 
dehydrated in successive ethanol solutions of 70%, 90%, and 100% for 5 minutes each, and 
allowed to dry over night or for at least 3 hours on at room temperature. Telomere FISH with 
a FITC conjugated telomeric PNA probe was conducted, and images were captured and 
analyzed as described above.

 Measurement of colocalized 53BP1 and telomeric foci
The number of 53BP1 foci and intersection with telomeres were counted per nuclei using 
NIS Element Advanced Research software (Nikon) after deconvolution. Briefly, the 
measurement feature of the software was used to create binary layers based on intensity and 
defining binary objects corresponding to 53BP1 foci and telomere foci. An intensity 
threshold was set up for an image from the control experiment (scr) for each channel 
(threshold FITC for telomeres and threshold Cy3 for 53BP1) and held constant for analyzing 
images from the MTH1 depleted cells (sh4 and sh5). The binary objects corresponding to 
areas smaller than 0.05 μm were discarded. The intersection tool was then used to create a 
third binary layer corresponding to the 53BP1 binary objects overlapping with telomere 
binary objects. Each nuclei were isolated using the region of interest (ROI) identification 
tools, based on DAPI staining, and the number of 53BP1 foci and intersections per ROI were 
exported in excel for data batch analysis.
Immunodetection of 8oxoG by immunofluorescence
Nuclear 8oxoG immuno-detection was performed as described previously62 using 
monoclonal mouse antibody (MAB3560, Millipore) diluted at 1:50 in goat anti mouse IgM.
Southern blot
Measurement of telomere length in HeLa VST and HeLa LT was performed as described 
in63,64 with slight modification. Briefly, 3 μg of genomic DNA were digested with a cocktail 
of 4 restriction enzymes (RsaI, AluI, HindIII, MnlI) for 16 h at 37°C and resolve on 0.8% 
agarose gel for 16 h 30 min (HeLa VST) or 24 h (HeLa LT). The agarose gel was dried for 2 
hours at 50°C and radioactive telomeric probe hybridized over night at 42°C.
Senescence associated beta-galactosidase Assay
The Cellular Senescence Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs) was used to detect of senescence 
associated beta-gal activity in cells three days post lentiviral infection. The staining was 
carried out in 35 mm dishes overnight at 37°C as per the manufacturers instructions. For 
quantification at least 100 cells, spanning 4 to 5 microscopy fields were scored for staining 
using a 20x objective and a light microscope.
Preparation of oligonucleotides for SM FRET
DNA oligonucleotides used in single molecule fluorescence experiments were 5′ TGG 
CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (TTA GGG)4 -Cy3 (oligonucleotide #6, Supplementary Table 
1), TGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC (TTAGGG)3TTAG(8-oxo-dG)G-Cy3 (oligonucleotide 
#7, Supplementary Table 1) and Cy5- GCC TCG CTG CCG TCG CCA-Biotin (18 mer, 
oligonucleotide #12). Cy3 labeled 4R and Cy5 labeled 18 mer were purchased from IDT 
(Coralville, IA). 4R 8-oxoG was purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Company 
(Midland, TX) with an amino modifier C7 at the 3′ end and labeled by reacting with Cy3 
maleimide (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 3.3mM Cy3 maleimide was incubated with 40 μM 
DNA in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate overnight at room temperature. The excess Cy3 was 
removed by ethanol precipitation twice. The partial duplex DNA molecules, 4R and 4R 8-
oxoG, were prepared by mixing a 3′ Cy3 sequence (#6 or #7) with 18mer #12 at a molar

 ratio of 1:1.5 in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl. The mixtures were incubated at 
95 °C for 2 min then slowly cooled to room temperature in a rate of 2 °C per minute.
Single Molecule FRET Experiments
Oligonucleotide preparation are described in Supplemental Material. Single molecule FRET 
measurement were carried out on quartz slides (Finkenbeiner) with glass coverslips, which 
coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The slides and coverslips were cleaned and treated 
with methanol, acetone, potassium hydroxide, burned, treated with aminosilane, and coated 
with a mixture of 97% mPEG (m-PEG-5000, Laysan Bio, Inc.) and 3% biotin PEG (biotin-
PEG-5000, Laysan Bio, Inc). Annealed partial duplex DNA molecules were immobilized on 
the PEG passivated surface via biotin-neutravidin interaction. Excess donor molecules were 
washed away with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl with an oxygen scavenging system 
(0.5% glucose, 10 mM 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic (Trolox), and 1 
mg/ml glucose oxidase and 4 μg/ml catalase). All measurements were carried out at room 
temperature. Widefield prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy 
was used with a solid-state 532 nm laser to generate an evanescent field of illumination. 
Fluorescence signals were separated by a 630-nm dichroic mirror and sent to a charge-
coupled device (CCD) camera. Data were recorded with a time resolution of 100 ms as a 
stream of imaging frames and analyzed by scripts written in Matlab. FRET histograms were 
generated using over 6,000 molecules and were fitted to Gaussian distributions with 
unrestrained peak center position using Origin 2016. Dwell times were measured by the time 
a molecule spends at low FRET state. The dwell time histograms were generated from more 
than 300 dynamic smFRET traces in at least three separated experiments. The first six 
transitions were collected from each trace.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with R statistical computing language and Prism 6 
(GraphPad Software Inc.). For Figures 3b, 4b and 4c, a one-factor ANOVA was used to 
determine whether the differences between cells expressing a scramble (scr) shRNA and an 
shRNA targeting MTH1 mRNA (sh4 and sh5) were significant at a 99% confidence level 
(Tukey’s honest significance test). For Figures 1, 3e, 4e, 5 and 6, statistical significance was 
calculated using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test at a 95% confidence level.

8-oxoG lesion. (e) Schematic of complementary oligonucleotide (C4) binding to the 
unfolded repeat. (f) Frequency count histograms before and after binding of the C4 
olignucleotide to the unmodified 4R and the 8-oxoG containing 4R substrates. (g) Model for 
dual roles of 8-oxoG in regulating telomerase. Oxidation of nucleotide pools generates 8-
oxodGTP, which is a telomerase chain terminator. Conversely, oxidation of the telomeric 
overhang promotes telomerase loading by destabilizing G-quadruplex structure.
