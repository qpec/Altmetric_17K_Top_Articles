BACKGROUND
Pregnancy rates among infertile women have been reported to increase after hys-
terosalpingography, but it is unclear whether the type of contrast medium used 
(oil-based or water-soluble contrast) influences this potential therapeutic effect.
METHODS
We performed a multicenter, randomized trial in 27 hospitals in the Netherlands in 
which infertile women who were undergoing hysterosalpingography were randomly 
assigned to undergo this procedure with the use of oil-based or water-based con-
trast. Subsequently, couples received expectant management or the women under-
went intrauterine insemination. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy 
within 6 months after randomization. Outcomes were analyzed according to the 
intention-to-treat principle.
RESULTS
A total of 1119 women were randomly assigned to hysterosalpingography with oil 
contrast (557 women) or water contrast (562 women). A total of 220 of 554 women 
in the oil group (39.7%) and 161 of 554 women in the water group (29.1%) had an 
ongoing pregnancy (rate ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.61; 
P<0.001), and 214 of 552 women in the oil group (38.8%) and 155 of 552 women in 
the water group (28.1%) had live births (rate ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.64; 
P<0.001). Rates of adverse events were low and similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Rates of ongoing pregnancy and live births were higher among women who under-
went hysterosalpingography with oil contrast than among women who underwent 
this procedure with water contrast. (Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR3270.)

nfertility, which is defined as the 
inability to conceive after 1 year of unprotect-
ed intercourse, affects approximately one of 
every six couples who are trying to get preg-
nant.1 Hysterosalpingography to assess tubal 
patency is part of the infertility evaluation in 
many cases. Although hysterosalpingography was 
introduced as a diagnostic test, it has been sug-
gested that tubal flushing directly increases preg-
nancy rates in the months after hysterosalpingog-
raphy.2
Many studies have shown a fertility-enhancing 
effect of hysterosalpingography with the use of 
oil contrast,3 but few randomized, controlled 
trials have assessed this effect.4-6 A meta-analysis 
of three trials showed higher rates of ongoing 
pregnancy after hysterosalpingography performed 
with oil contrast than after no intervention 
(odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
2.1 to 6.3).7
Five randomized, controlled trials directly 
compared pregnancy rates after hysterosalpingog-
raphy involving oil contrast with those after hys-
terosalpingography involving water contrast.8-12 
Four of these trials showed no significant differ-
ence in ongoing pregnancy rates associated with 
the two contrast mediums used,8-10,12 but one 
trial showed a higher ongoing pregnancy rate 
after hysterosalpingography with oil contrast 
than with water contrast (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% 
CI, 2.0 to 6.0).11 A meta-analysis including all 
five trials did not show significantly higher rates 
of pregnancy among women who underwent 
hysterosalpingography with oil contrast than 
among those who underwent this procedure 
with water contrast (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8 
to 2.5).7 However, the included studies were con-
sidered to be of low quality, the method of ran-
domization9-11 and whether there was blinding 
of treatment assignments8-12 were unclear, and 
some studies indicated that rates of loss to fol-
low-up were as high as 21%.8,10 Moreover, the 
largest trial, which included 533 participants, 
showed no significant difference in live-birth 
rates with the use of oil contrast as compared 
with water contrast.12 In view of this uncertainty, 
we conducted a multicenter, randomized, con-
trolled trial to compare ongoing pregnancy rates 
and other pregnancy outcomes among women 
who underwent hysterosalpingography with oil 
contrast with those among women who under-
went this procedure with water contrast.
Methods
Trial Oversight
The Water versus Oil (H2Oil) trial was approved 
by the ethics committee and institutional review 
board of the Academic Medical Center, Amster-
dam, and by the board of directors of all par-
ticipating hospitals. Trial oversight was provided 
by the ethics committee of the Academic Medi-
cal Center. In each of the participating centers, 
data monitoring in accordance with the Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines was performed by 
dedicated research nurses. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent. The first, sec-
ond, and last authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and analyses and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, which is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
Trial Participants
Participants in the H2Oil trial were recruited 
from 27 hospitals (4 academic, 12 teaching, and 
11 nonteaching hospitals) in the Netherlands. 
Gynecologists in these hospitals collaborate in a 
nationwide consortium for women’s health re-
search (the Dutch Consortium for Healthcare 
Evaluation and Research in Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology; www.studies-obsgyn.nl).
Women were eligible to participate in the 
trial if they were between 18 and 39 years of age, 
had spontaneous menstrual cycles, and had been 
trying to conceive for at least 1 year and if there 
was an indication for evaluation of tubal patency 
by means of hysterosalpingography.13 Exclusion 
criteria were known endocrine disorders (e.g., 
the polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes, hyper-
thyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia), less than 
eight menstrual cycles per year, a high risk of 
tubal disease (as indicated by a history of pelvic 
inflammatory disease, previous chlamydia infec-
tion, or known endometriosis), iodine allergy 
(since the contrast mediums under study both 
contained iodine), and a total motile sperm 
count after sperm wash of less than 3 million 
sperm per milliliter in the male partner (or a 
total motile sperm count of <1 million sperm

Oil or Water Contrast for Hysterosalpingography
per milliliter when an analysis after sperm wash 
was not performed).
Randomization and Trial Intervention
Potential participants were informed about the 
trial by their doctors or dedicated research nurs-
es. After they provided written informed con-
sent, the women were, preferably just before 
hysterosalpingography, randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to the use of oil contrast (Lipiodol Ultra-
Fluid, Guerbet) (the oil group) or water contrast 
(Telebrix Hystero, Guerbet) (the water group). 
Randomization was performed by the doctors or 
research nurses with the use of a secured online 
randomization program (ALEA, FormsVision) 
with random block sizes of 2, 4, or 6, stratified 
according to hospital. This randomization pro-
gram was overseen by an independent data 
manager. Owing to the difference in imaging 
between the use of oil-based contrast and water-
based contrast, and, since our outcome of on-
going pregnancy was objective, the trial was 
not blinded with respect to participants and care-
givers.
Hysterosalpingography was performed accord-
ing to local protocols. The contrast medium 
could be infused into the uterus with the use of 
a cervical vacuum cup, metal cannula (hystero-
phore), or balloon catheter. During the infusion 
of approximately 5 to 10 ml of contrast medium, 
four to six radiographs that were obtained to 
evaluate the patency of both fallopian tubes were 
examined by a gynecologist or radiologist.
Subsequently, couples received expectant man-
agement or the women underwent intrauterine 
insemination. Expectant management was indi-
cated when the predicted likelihood of natural 
conception within 12 months after hysterosal-
pingography, as based on the prognostic model 
of Hunault,14,15 was 30% or greater. Intrauterine 
insemination was offered when this likelihood 
was less than 30%, when mild male infertility 
(defined as a total motile sperm count between 
1 million and 3 million sperm per milliliter) was 
present, or after a period of expectant manage-
ment without natural conception. Intrauterine 
insemination was initiated after a minimum of 
2 months of expectant management after hystero-
salpingography and could be performed with or 
without mild ovarian hyperstimulation, accord-
ing to local protocols. Mild ovarian hyperstimu-
lation, aiming for two or three follicles, was 
achieved with clomiphene citrate or exogenous 
gonadotropins.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was ongoing 
pregnancy, defined as a positive fetal heartbeat 
on ultrasonographic examination after 12 weeks 
of gestation, with the first day of the last men-
strual cycle for the pregnancy within 6 months 
after randomization. Secondary outcome mea-
sures were clinical pregnancy (defined as a ges-
tational sac detected on ultrasonography), live 
birth (defined as a live birth after 24 weeks of 
gestation), miscarriage (defined as the absence 
of a fetal heartbeat on ultrasonography or spon-
taneous loss of pregnancy before 12 weeks of 
gestation), ectopic pregnancy (defined as an 
embryo implanted outside the uterine cavity), 
and pain scores after hysterosalpingography, 
measured by means of the Visual-Analogue Scale 
for Pain (scores range from 0.0 to 10.0 cm, with 
higher scores indicating more severe pain).
Costs were a prespecified secondary outcome, 
but this analysis is not included in this article. 
We also compared the time to pregnancy re-
sulting in an ongoing pregnancy (calculated from 
the first day of the last menstrual period plus 
4 weeks).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that the trial would need to in-
clude 1080 women (540 in each group) to obtain 
a power of 80%, with an alpha error of 5%, to 
detect a difference of 7 percentage points be-
tween the trial groups in rates of ongoing preg-
nancies. This difference was considered by the 
clinical investigators to be clinically meaningful, 
over an anticipated control rate of 18% after 
hysterosalpingography.10,11 Since the trial com-
pared two interventions used routinely in clini-
cal practice and was expected to recruit quickly, 
an interim analysis was not performed.
Categorical data were reported as absolute 
numbers and percentages. Normally distributed 
continuous variables were summarized as means 
with standard deviations, and nonnormally dis-
tributed continuous variables were reported as 
medians with interquartile ranges. Apart from

conventional baseline data, we also compared 
the likelihood of natural conception within 12 
months after hysterosalpingography (calculated 
with the use of the prognostic model of Hu-
nault) in the two trial groups after completion of 
the fertility workup to see whether the chance 
of getting pregnant was similar in the two 
groups.14,15
All data were analyzed according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle. Univariate rate ratios or 
relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were 
calculated for the primary and other binary out-
come measures, and the chi-square test was 
used to assess statistical significance. Continu-
ous outcomes were analyzed with the use of an 
independent t-test or the Mann–Whitney U-test 
as appropriate. We used Kaplan–Meier curves 
with a log-rank test to compare the groups with 
respect to the time to pregnancy resulting in an 
ongoing pregnancy. Two-sided P values of less 
than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical 
significance. No adjustment was made for mul-
tiple comparisons. SPSS software, version 22.0 
(IBM), and R software, version 3.3.1 (R Project 
for Statistical Computing), were used for statisti-
cal analyses.

Oil or Water Contrast for Hysterosalpingography
Results
Trial Participants
Between February 3, 2012, and October 29, 
2014, a total of 1294 infertile women were 
screened for eligibility in the trial, of whom 
1240 met the inclusion criteria and 1119 pro-
vided written informed consent (Fig. 1). Among 
these 1119 women, 557 were randomly assigned 
to hysterosalpingography with the use of oil 
contrast and 562 were assigned to hysterosal-
pingography with the use of water contrast. At 
6 months after randomization, data on the pri-
mary outcome, ongoing pregnancy, were avail-
able for 1108 of 1119 women (99.0%). Since the 
number of missing values was very low, we did 
not impute missing data, and we report on 1108 
women (554 women in each group). A total of 71 
women (38 women in the oil group and 33 in the 
water group) did not meet the inclusion criteria 
after assignment, mostly because of a period of 
infertility of slightly less than 1 year (Fig. 1); 
these women were included in the analyses.
The baseline characteristics were similar in 
the two groups (Table 1). A total of 787 women 
underwent hysterosalpingography on the day of 
randomization; the remaining women underwent 
hysterosalpingography more than 1 day (inter-

Hysterosalpingography showed bilateral tubal 
patency in 477 of 554 women randomly assigned 
to oil contrast (86.1%) and in 491 of 554 women 
randomly assigned to water contrast (88.6%) 
(rate ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.02) (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available at

9 women in the oil group (1.6%) and in 13 
women in the water group (2.3%) (relative risk, 
0.69; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.61).
A total of 58.3% of the women who were 
randomly assigned to oil contrast and 57.2% of 
the women who were randomly assigned to 
water contrast received expectant management 
(Table 2). Similar percentages of women in the 
oil group and the water group underwent intra-
uterine insemination (39.7% and 41.0%, respec-
tively), in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracyto-
plasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (2.3% and 2.2%), 
laparoscopy (6.2% in each group), and hysteros-
copy (4.4% and 4.2%). Indications for IVF or ICSI,

Oil or Water Contrast for Hysterosalpingography
 
Outcomes
The primary outcome, ongoing pregnancy, oc-
curred in 220 of 554 women (39.7%) randomly 
assigned to oil contrast and in 161 of 554 women 
(29.1%) randomly assigned to water contrast 
(rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.61; P<0.001). 
The median time to the onset of pregnancy was 
2.7 months (interquartile range, 1.5 to 4.7) in 
the oil group and 3.1 months (interquartile 
range, 1.6 to 4.8) in the water group (P 
= 
0.44) 
(Fig. 2).
Of the 220 ongoing pregnancies in the oil 
group, 162 (73.6%) were naturally conceived, 15 
(6.8%) were conceived after intrauterine insemi-
nation without mild ovarian hyperstimulation, 
39 (17.7%) were conceived after intrauterine in-
semination with mild ovarian hyperstimulation, 
and 4 (1.8%) were conceived after embryo trans-
fer following IVF or ICSI. Of the 161 ongoing 
pregnancies in the water group, 117 (72.7%) 
were naturally conceived, 16 (9.9%) were con-
ceived after intrauterine insemination without 
mild ovarian hyperstimulation, 26 (16.1%) were 
conceived after intrauterine insemination with 
mild ovarian hyperstimulation, and 2 (1.2%) 
were conceived after embryo transfer following 
IVF or ICSI.
A total of 214 of 552 women in the oil group 
(38.8%) versus 155 of 552 women in the water 
group (28.1%) had a live birth (rate ratio, 1.38;

95% CI, 1.17 to 1.64; P<0.001). The other sec-
ondary outcomes are listed in Table 3. A post 
hoc analysis excluding the 71 women who in 
retrospect did not meet inclusion criteria yielded 
results that were similar to those in the inten-
tion-to-treat analysis for ongoing pregnancy at 
6 months (rate ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.65).
A total of 3 of 554 women (0.5%) randomly 
assigned to oil contrast and 4 of 554 women 
(0.7%) randomly assigned to water contrast had 
an adverse event during the trial period (Table 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the oil 
group, 2 women who had an ectopic pregnancy 
underwent a laparoscopic unilateral salpingec-
tomy. One woman had a molar pregnancy and 
underwent a vacuum curettage. In the water 
group, 2 women had an ectopic pregnancy and 
underwent a laparoscopic unilateral salpingec-
tomy. One woman had a nosebleed after a Puregon 
injection during intrauterine insemination. In an-
other woman, contrast material was seen in the 
urinary bladder during hysterosalpingography, 
and this material disappeared spontaneously. 
Three women (1.4%), all in the oil group, deliv-
ered a child with a congenital anomaly (Table S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this multicenter, randomized trial, we found 
that the rate of ongoing pregnancy within 
6 months after randomization was significantly 
higher among infertile women who underwent 
hysterosalpingography with oil contrast than 
among women who underwent this procedure 
with the use of water contrast. The subsequent 
live-birth rate was also significantly higher 
among women who underwent hysterosalpingog-
raphy with oil contrast.
Our trial has some limitations. The trial was 
not conducted in a blinded manner, since the 
doctor who administered contrast material also 
evaluated the patency of the fallopian tubes dur-
ing the examination, and oil and water contrast 
provide different images on radiographs. How-
ever, our primary end point, ongoing pregnancy, 
was objective, and the number of women who 
underwent intrauterine insemination or IVF or 
ICSI was similar in the two groups, which 
makes it unlikely that a lack of blinding influ-
enced our findings. Also, 38 women in the oil 
group and 33 women in the water group did not 
meet the inclusion criteria. However, the propor-
tion of these women was similar in the two 
groups, and results were similar when we ex-
cluded these women. Our trial involved infertile 
women with a low risk of tubal disease. These 
women were younger than 39 years of age and 
did not have known endocrinologic diseases, and 
our findings should not be generalized to infer-
tile women who do not share these features.
The results of previous studies directly com-
paring the therapeutic effect of oil-based con-
trast with water-based contrast during hystero-
salpingography were conflicting,8-12 with the 
largest and most robust trial12 showing no ef-
fect, but these studies had methodologic limita-
tions. Our trial was more than twice as large as 
the largest previous trial and had a very low rate 
of loss to follow-up (1%).
The underlying mechanisms by which oil 
contrast might enhance fertility are unclear. 
Some studies suggest that tubal-patency testing 
with an oily medium will flush debris and dis-
lodge mucus plugs from undamaged tubes. Two 
previous trials involving women with normal 
fallopian tubes showed significantly higher preg-
nancy rates after tubal flushing with oil contrast 
than with no tubal-patency testing.4,6 Also, the 
oil contrast might have an effect on peritoneal 
macrophage activity and on endometrial recep-
tivity, thereby enhancing fertility by an implan-
tation-mediated mechanism.16,17 Since we observed 
an effect that continued to persist over multiple 
menstrual cycles, we consider a direct endome-
trial effect unlikely.
Tubal flushing with hysterosalpingography 
during a fertility workup is minimally invasive 
and inexpensive, as compared with IVF. The 
10-percentage-point increase in the clinical preg-
nancy rate after the use of oil contrast corre-
sponds with a number needed to treat of 10. 
Data from a formal cost-effectiveness analysis of 
the potential cost advantage are lacking.
The safety of the use of oil contrast must be 
considered. There is a theoretical risk of intra-
vasation of the oil contrast with a subsequent 
allergic reaction or fat embolism. A case report 
has described intravasation of oil contrast with 
a subsequent fat embolism, which resolved with 
supportive measures.18 However, this is a rare 
complication; no cases were observed in our

Oil or Water Contrast for Hysterosalpingography
trial nor in other trials involving hysterosalpin-
gography with oil contrast.19 In our trial, three 
infants in the oil group and none in the water 
group had congenital abnormalities. This find-
ing is probably due to chance; the frequency of 
congenital anomalies with oil contrast was not 
greater than rates reported in the general popu-
lation, and we are unaware of other data sug-
gesting an increased risk of congenital anoma-
lies with oil contrast.
New techniques for outpatient tubal testing 
have been introduced, including hysterosalpingo-
foam sonography.20,21 Data to assess the effects 
of the use of oil contrast for ultrasonography-
based tubal tests or tubal flushing with oil con-
trast after ultrasonographic examination on rates 
of pregnancy and live births are lacking.
