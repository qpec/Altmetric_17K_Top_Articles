OBJECTIVE: To identify smartphone menstrual cycle
tracking applications (apps) and evaluate their accuracy,
features, and functionality.
METHODS: In this systematic evaluation, we searched the
Apple iTunes store for free menstrual cycle tracking apps
for patient use. We considered an application accurate if
menstrual cycle predictions were based on average cycle
lengths of at least three previous cycles, ovulation (when
included) was predicted at 13–15 days before the start of
the next cycle, and the application contained no misinfor-
mation. We modified the APPLICATIONS Scoring System
to evaluate the features and functionality of accurate apps.
RESULTS: Our search criteria yielded 1,116 apps; 108
remained after excluding duplicate, non-English, non-
menstrual cycle tracking, and priced apps. We further
eliminated 88 that did not meet inclusion or accuracy
criteria. Of the 20 accurate, free apps, 80% contained
information for conception and 50% for contraception.
Common features and functionality included password
protection (55%); no requirement for Internet connectiv-
ity (80%); no advertisements (65%); in-application techni-
cal support (70%); medical disclaimers (65%); health
education (55%); tracking of menstrual flow (70%), symp-
toms (70%), and intercourse (75%); alerts for next menses
(65%) and fertility (55%); and cycle length information
(75%). Forty percent were available for Android. Useful-
ness for fertility medications (15%), professional involve-
ment (5%), and cited literature (5%) were rare.
CONCLUSION: Most free smartphone menstrual cycle
tracking apps for patient use are inaccurate. Few cite
medical literature or health professional involvement. We
list accurate apps to aid health care providers in under-
standing the key components they can use to evaluate and
recommend apps for patients.

T
racking of menstrual cycles for self-understanding
and achieving fertility goals is a common form of
self-monitoring that promotes patient empowerment
and informed decision-making.1,2 Nippita et al3 found
68% of women initiating contraception usually track
their menses. Menstrual cycle tracking applications
(apps) are the fourth most popular health app among
adults4 and the second most popular among adolescent
females.5 With approximately 80% of 18–49 year olds
in the United States owning smartphones,6 and 23% of
women smartphone owners using mobile health apps,4
the use of health apps has the potential to promote the
provision of patient-centered, reproductive health care.7
Application overload is a challenge for health care
providers and patients.8–10 The number of health apps in
the U.S. Apple iTunes and Google Play stores exceeds
165,000.10 Of 90,088 health apps in the Apple iTunes
store, 7% are for women’s health and pregnancy.10
Surveyed health care providers believe information
collected in patient apps can promote better understand-
ing of patient health.11 Health care providers express
interest in promoting the use of health apps but seek
guidance about making app recommendations.9,11,12

 Evidence-based, unbiased evaluations of health apps
that address app accuracy are needed.13,14 Chyjek
et al15 thus developed the APPLICATIONS Scoring
System in response to a request for a sustainable app
review model free of conflict of interest.13
The objectives for this study are to identify and
evaluate free menstrual cycle tracking apps using an
adapted APPLICATIONS Scoring System. Our evalu-
ation will serve as a resource for health care providers on
features and functionality common to these apps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study did not require review by the institutional
review boards at the Columbia University Medical
Center and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai based on the prespecified guidelines that this
research did not involve or pose any risks to human
subjects. We conducted a systematic evaluation of free
menstrual cycle tracking apps. We searched the Apple
iTunes store using the terms “menstrual cycle,” “period,”
“fertility,” and “menstrual calendar” between December
15, 2014, and January 9, 2015. We compiled a master
list of apps by reviewing the app store description. We
excluded duplicate apps, those not available in English,
apps for health care providers, and apps no longer avail-
able at the time of review. Exclusions on further review
of content were nonhealth apps; nonwomen’s health
apps; other women’s health apps (eg, fertility, preg-
nancy, contraceptive reminder, menopause); apps exclu-
sively for partners; and apps specific to a medical
practice, program, or device. To eliminate the barrier
of cost, we included only free apps in further analysis,
eliminating all priced (paid) apps, apps requiring a sub-
scription for use, and free apps requiring purchase of
a special commercial device.
Our primary criterion for ongoing inclusion in
this study was accuracy. Ninety-nine percent of
regular menstrual cycles range from 21 to 35 days,
and only one in eight or nine women have 28-day
cycles.16 Because women may not know their average

 cycle length, we decided that the ability to predict the
next menstrual cycle based on averages of past cycles
and not on a default (often 28-day) cycle length would
be an important element of our accuracy criteria. We
eliminated apps that did not allow input of four pre-
vious menstrual periods (three full menstrual cycles).
This is equivalent to the number of tracked cycles
required
for
entry
into
natural
family
planning
research studies.17 An app was considered accurate if
it predicted July 7, 2015, as the date of the next ex-
pected menstrual cycle after entering previous men-
strual periods of April 6, April 27, May 22, and June
14, 2015. We chose to input dates for a 23-day men-
strual cycle average to eliminate apps that work only
for cycles with a 26- to 32-day range; 22% of women
with regular cycles fall outside this narrow range.17
From June 21, 2015, to July 1, 2015, we down-
loaded the latest version of each free, patient-centered
menstrual cycle tracking app from our original search
and checked for accurate prediction of the next
menstrual cycle. We further eliminated apps that
contained erroneous health information such as a pre-
dicted date of ovulation outside 13–15 days before the
start of the next menstrual cycle16 or gender predic-
tions based on conception date.7,18,19
We recorded seller, version, and Android plat-
form availability for each app. The components of the
APPLICATIONS Scoring System were developed
based on existing literature.15 The scoring system en-
hances filtering of irrelevant and inaccurate apps and
has been used to systematically review and evaluate
reproductive health app content.15,20 The five authors
adapted the components of the APPLICATIONS
Scoring System to assess the features and functionality
that other researchers have determined as important for
health care providers and their patients (Table 1).12,14,18,21
All authors then independently reviewed, evaluated,
and scored each app.
We initially downloaded and opened each app in
airplane mode to evaluate the connectivity compo-
nent and determine whether functionality was depen-
dent on Internet access. For free apps with premium
(paid) versions, we assigned points only for features
available in the free version. We determined app
comprehensiveness by assigning 1 point for fertility
tracking for women trying to conceive, 1 point for
containing information on contraception or preg-
nancy prevention, and 1 point for tracking of fertility
medications. We further evaluated each app for
password protection, professional involvement, cita-
tion of scientific literature used, in-app purchases,
third-party advertisements, access to technical sup-
port, and 14 “other” features.
We
tabulated
each
“other”
feature.
These
included a social media feature; medical disclaimer;
health education; option for data backup and e-mail
or export of cycle history; a custom reminder; preg-
nancy mode; tracking of flow amount, symptoms, or
sexual intercourse; alerts for next menses and fertility;
and calculation and display of average cycle length. A
native Spanish speaker (P.M.C.) reviewed each app
for Spanish language availability. We totaled all
points for this component and awarded 0 points if
zero to four features were present, 1 point if five to
nine features were present, and 2 points if 10 or more
features were present. Each reviewer individually
evaluated navigation ease and subjective presentation
using a Likert scale with 15poor, 25below average,
35average, 45above average, and 55excellent.
To account for any interobserver differences, we
reconciled ratings and recorded objective errors. Our
reconciliation process included meetings of all authors

 during which we discussed each feature for each app.
When there was a discrepancy, we determined
whether it was a transcription or misclassification
mistake and arrived at 100% consensus for the
objective components of each app. For navigation
ease
and
subjective
presentation,
we
averaged
reviewers’ scores and awarded 0 points for an aver-
age rating of less than 3 and 1 point for an average
rating of 3 or greater. We calculated a final total
score for each app.
RESULTS
After obtaining a total of 1,116 results with the
search terms, initial exclusions left 650 apps (Fig. 1).
Further screening and review of content eliminated
425 apps, resulting in 225 menstrual cycle tracking
apps. Of the 225 apps, 117 were paid apps or apps
requiring a subscription for use and 108 were free.
One author (M.L.M.) applied the accuracy criteria to
the 108 free apps.
Twenty of the 108 apps (19%) were accurate. A
second author (H.V.N.) confirmed accuracy of these
apps. The 20 accurate apps were then evaluated with
an adapted APPLICATIONS Scoring System by all
authors (Tables 2 and 3). The highest scoring app
earned 13 out of 15 possible points. Twelve apps
scored above the mean score of 7.7. The lowest scor-
ing app earned 2 points.
Evaluated features and functionality are shown
in Figures 2 and 3. Eighty percent contained infor-
mation for conception and 50% for contraception.
Common features and functionality included pass-
word protection (55%); no requirement for Inter-
net connectivity (80%); no advertisements (65%);
in-app technical support (70%); medical disclaim-
ers (65%); health education (55%); tracking of men-
strual flow (70%), symptoms (70%), and intercourse
(75%); alerts for next menses (65%) and fertility
(55%); and cycle length information (75%). Forty per-
cent were available for Android. Usefulness for fertil-
ity medications (15%), professional involvement (5%),
and cited literature (5%) were rare features. The
objective component reporting error rate was 30 out
of 200 (15%), meaning that the authors independently
assigned the same score to a given objective compo-
nent of an app 85% of the time.

 DISCUSSION
Most available menstrual cycle tracking apps are
inaccurate, contain misleading health information, or
do not function. We found only 20 free, English-
language apps that allowed for accurate menstrual
cycle tracking based on cycle length averages. Few
apps cited literature used or were developed or
recommended by reproductive health experts. The
highest scoring app missed points for not having an
option to track infertility treatments and not reporting
health professional involvement. Of the 14 “other”
features, this app missed only a social media feature
and allowing the consumer to designate a pregnancy
and thus temporarily stop menstrual cycle tracking.
Our evaluation contributes to mobile health literature
by identifying free, accurate, menstrual cycle tracking
apps for patients and highlighting their features and
functionality through a modified APPLICATIONS
Scoring System.
Nineteen percent of apps evaluated for accuracy
contained erroneous medical information. Because
content of health care apps is not monitored by any
regulatory agency,13,18,22 health care provider involve-
ment in app content is key. When health care pro-
vider input is impossible, citation of medical literature
legitimizes content. Our review, however, reveals that
only one app reported professional involvement and
one cited literature.
A strength of this analysis is the use of an adapted
version of an existing scoring system endorsed by two
of the original authors who served among the five app
reviewers. We developed strict inclusion and accuracy
criteria to focus on apps that would not mislead
patients or health care providers in any critical way.
The features and functionality assessed have been
cited as important by researchers.12,14,18,21
Another strength is that reviewers were racially and
ethnically diverse male and female reproductive health
nurse practitioners and physicians ranging in age from
their 20s to 40s. The aim of this evaluation was to
provide health care providers with the explicit compo-
nents of the scoring system and results so that they can
better advise their patients in selecting apps. Patient
evaluation of accurate apps is the next natural step.23
A limitation of our study is inclusion of only free
apps from the Apple iTunes store. We restricted our
evaluation to apps that would be most accessible. Cost
contributes to a consumer’s rating of an app.21 We
searched the Apple iTunes and then the Google Play
stores given their dominance in the app market. An
equal proportion of young women use Apple and
Android devices.24 Searching all platforms could have

scope of this study.
Availability, content, features, and functionality
may have changed during our evaluation. Technologic
advances move at a faster pace than research.25 We
carried out our evaluation systematically and during
a limited timeframe to limit variability. We provide
app version information to allow for independent assess-
ment of improvements in subsequent versions.
Menstrual cycle tracking apps are frequently
downloaded, yet challenges exist for both patients
and health care providers when considering which
app to use.4,5,12 We confirmed that the app stores do
not allow for an easy search.9 Some apps have sim-
ilar names; many search results are not menstrual
cycle trackers.
Privacy and security concerns exist with the use of
mobile technologies.2,13,23,26 A health care provider

 recommending apps may advise patients to enter
only that personal information that they would share
with third parties.26 Paper calendars may remain the
best option for some patients until data use is more
transparent.
Information contained in menstrual cycle track-
ing apps should not take the place of medical
advice. In conjunction with other methods, patients
may choose to use apps to help prevent or achieve
pregnancy. Along with the potential for positive
outcomes,
there
is
potential
for
negative
out-
comes,7,18 including unplanned pregnancies. Pa-
tients may not understand the factors that can
affect a menstrual cycle and that predictions by
apps are estimates; alerts for next menses or for
a fertile window require regular cycles. We did
not evaluate for nor do we advocate use of these
menstrual cycle tracking apps as a primary tool to
prevent or achieve pregnancy.
Health care providers may use apps in counseling
and educating patients or, given the importance of the
menstrual cycle as a vital sign,27 to assist with diagnosis
and surveillance of reproductive health problems. The
utility of the 20 evaluated apps for such use merits
further evaluation. Our findings serve to familiarize
busy health care providers with the challenges, risks,
and benefits of menstrual cycle tracking app use by
patients. Only through gaining a better understanding
of these apps will we be able to achieve the goal of safe
and effective use by patients and harness the utility
these apps hold for health care providers.
