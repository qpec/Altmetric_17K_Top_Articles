Pharmacological inhibition of REV-
ERB stimulates differentiation, 
inhibits turnover and reduces 
fibrosis in dystrophic muscle

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating X-linked disorder that is fatal. DMD patients lack 
the expression of the structural protein dystrophin caused by mutations within the DMD gene. The 
absence of functional dystrophin protein results in excessive damage from normal muscle use due to the 
compromised structural integrity of the dystrophin associated glycoprotein complex. As a result, DMD 
patients exhibit ongoing cycles of muscle destruction and regeneration that promote inflammation, 
fibrosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, satellite cell (SC) exhaustion and loss of skeletal and cardiac muscle 
function. The nuclear receptor REV-ERB suppresses myoblast differentiation and recently we have 
demonstrated that the REV-ERB antagonist, SR8278, stimulates muscle regeneration after acute injury. 
Therefore, we decided to explore whether the REV-ERB antagonist SR8278 could slow the progression 
of muscular dystrophy. In mdx mice SR8278 increased lean mass and muscle function, and decreased 
muscle fibrosis and muscle protein degradation. Interestingly, we also found that SR8278 increased the 
SC pool through stimulation of Notch and Wnt signaling. These results suggest that REV-ERB is a potent 
target for the treatment of DMD.
Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, fatal muscle wasting disorder caused by mutations 
within the dystrophin gene that affects 1:5000–10000 boys1. Even with treatment DMD patients have an expected 
lifespan of around 25 years. Boys affected with DMD are ambulatory only until about the age of 12, and become 
wheelchair bound and dependent on mechanical ventilation for respiratory support2. Patients eventually suc-
cumb to either cardiac or respiratory failure3. Dystrophin is a subsarcolemmal protein and a key component 
of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAG) that has both mechanical stabilizing and signaling 
roles in mediating interactions between the cytoskeleton, membrane and extracellular matrix. Loss of full-length 
dystrophin severely compromises myofiber stability and disrupts calcium signaling. As a consequence, normal 
muscle contraction produces excessively high levels of intracellular muscle damage. This results in rapid turnover 
of muscle fibers, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduction in satellite cell numbers, and fibrosis that 
collectively deplete functional muscle mass4,5.
DMD is treated clinically with glucocorticoids, which slow loss of motor function and muscle turnover, 
possibly by inhibiting fibrosis6,7. However, the associated side effects of glucocorticoid use are often at odds 
with their beneficial effects in DMD. Physical therapy also has some proven therapeutic benefits, however, 
like glucocorticoids physical therapy cannot completely stymy DMD progression7. Other targeted approaches 
using anti-inflammatory agents that block NF-κ
B signaling have not advanced past clinical trials8. Cell based 
approaches that either employ CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to repair DMD mutations and repro-
gram SC are still experimental9,10. More radical cell replacement therapies like autologous bone marrow trans-
plant have not been comprehensively tested as clinically viable treatments11. Similarly inuitively appealing 
methods; exon skipping therapies, that attempt to rescue dystrophin protein expression in skeletal muscle (SkM) 
have been tested in patients12–14. These treatments utilize antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to modify mRNA 
splicing of dystrophin transcripts and can potentially yield therapeutic benefits in about 83% of DMD patients. 
One AON, eteplirsen (or exondys 51), a morpholino designed to restore partial dystrophin expression by skipping 
exon 51, has successfully gained FDA approval. Yet in clinical trials involving eteplirsen the correlation between

measured therapeutic outcomes and the degree of rescued dystrophin expression was unexpectedly inconsist-
ent15. Inefficiencies of delivery and poor pharmacokinetics are some of the confounding technical challenges that 
are yet to be fully overcome with these agents. Meanwhile, efforts to eliminate incongruences in patient sorting 
and the manner in which therapeutic effects are measured in clinical trials should allow the therapeutic benefits 
of AONs to be more accurately gauged. The small molecule drug ataluren, which promotes ribosomal skipping of 
premature stop codons has also similarly been successfully used to rescue functional dystrophin expression and 
muscle function in DMD. Still, ataluren has only displayed therapeutic effects in select patient subgroups16–19. 
While all these treatments hold significant promise, they are still essentially palliative as they only delay loss of 
ambulation. Nevertheless, pharmacological therapies that have a favorable safety profile, potently combat muscle 
wasting and inhibit fibrosis with comparable efficacy to that of glucocorticoids are still much needed.
The nuclear receptor REV-ERB (REV-ERBα
 and REV-ERBβ
) are ligand activated transcription factors and 
constituent transcriptional repressors20 encoded by the genes NR1D1 and NR1D2 respectively. REV-ERB is highly 
expressed in SkM and is an important regulatory component of the circadian clock, and a regulator of metabolism 
and cellular differentiation21. The circadian clock activator Brain and Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (BMAL1) is known 
inducer of myogenic and Wnt signaling in SkM and regulates adult SkM repair22. Bmal1 expression has also been 
linked to SkM myosin heavy chain content and shown to be critical to the maintenance of the Pax7+ satellite cell 
population23,24. REV-ERB directly inhibits Bmal1 expression by interacting with REV-ERB response elements 
(ROREs) at target gene promoters25. Interestingly, REV-ERB has been shown to inhibit myoblast differentiation 
by repressing myogenic signaling and cell cycle checkpoint regulators through an RORE-binding independent 
mechanism26. We have also shown that targeted disruption of REV-ERB activity stimulated muscle regeneration 
in response to acute injury26, suggesting that REV-ERB antagonists may be therapeutically beneficial in an assort-
ment of myopathies.
We therefore explored whether disrupting REV-ERB activity using the REV-ERB antagonist SR8278 could 
slow the progression of muscular dystrophy in a model of DMD, the mdx mouse. REV-ERB antagonism improved 
muscle function, reduced fibrosis, stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and induced an oxidative fiber phenotype 
in dystrophic mice possibly through activation of Wnt signaling. These observations suggest that pharmacologi-
cally active REV-ERB ligands should be capable of ameliorating the progression of dystrophinopathies.
Results
REV-ERB antagonism increases lean mass and improves muscle function in mdx mice. 
REV-
ERB is an inhibitor of myogenesis in myoblasts and pharmacological antagonism of REV-ERB stimulates muscle 
regeneration during acute injury27–29. Therefore, we postulated that inhibiting REV-ERB pharmacologically in a 
model of muscular dystrophy could yield some therapeutic benefit. We treated 10-week old mdx mice (n = 10 
per group) with SR8278 or vehicle control for 6 weeks and assessed total body weight, adiposity and lean mass. 
Interestingly, SR8278 treatment increased lean mass and may have improved limb muscle function, as evidenced 
by grip strength assessment, without an overall increase in total mass (Fig. 1A–D). In order to probe the toxicity 
profile of SR8278 we performed clinical chemistry on the plasma samples of treated mice. Mice receiving SR8278 
showed no elevation in the hepatic toxicity markers alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
and urea suggesting that SR8278 was well tolerated and had no hepatotoxic effects (Supplementary Fig. 1A). 
There was similarly no evidence of SR8278 hepatomegaly in wild type C57Bl6J mice dosed with SR8278 for 3 
weeks (Supplementary Fig. 1B). These observations suggest that disrupting REV-ERB activity may have systemi-
cally stabilized SkM in dystrophic mice without overt toxicity.
Antagonizing REV-ERB improves muscle architecture and reduces fibrosis in dystrophic muscle. 
 
In order to further understand the global effects of REV-ERB antagonism in SR8278 treated mice we performed 
histological assessment of the gastrocnemius and thoracic diaphragm muscles. H&E staining of mdx mouse 
muscle showed significant improvements in muscle fiber architecture with reduced basophilic infiltrates in mice

treated with SR8278 (Fig. 2A). In addition, SkM of mice dosed with SR8278, exhibited reduced picrosirius red 
staining for fibrosis compared to vehicle treated mice (Fig. 2B). Similarly, fibrosis in the thoracic diaphragm, a 
major contributor to dystrophic patient mortality, was also significantly reduced in SR8278 treated mice (Fig. 2C). 
These observations indicate that SR8278 reduced intramuscular inflammation, and muscle turnover, and slowed 
the replacement of myofibers with fibrotic tissue; all key factors that drive DMD pathology.
Pro-myogenic factor expression is induced by REV-ERB antagonism. 
Quantification of myogen-
esis expression in the muscle of mdx mice revealed that the myogenic factors myosin D (Myod), myogenic factor 
5 (Myf5), myosin heavy chain 1 (Mhc1) myosin heavy chain 2b (Mhc2b) and embryonic myosin heavy chain 
(Mhc3) were all increased in antagonist treated mdx muscle (Fig. 3A). This induction of myosin heavy chain 
expression was specific to mdx muscle, as SR8278 failed to induce myosin heavy chain expression in wild type 
(C57Bl6J) mouse muscle (Supplementary Fig. 1C). These observations are in accord with that of previous studies 
where REV-ERB antagonists only mediated an effect on myosin gene expression under conditions where muscle 
turnover is actively occurring26. In parallel, immunoblot analysis showed an increase in MHC1, MHC2, MYOD 
and MYF5 protein expression in dystrophic mice treated with SR8278 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, SR8278 appeared 
to stimulate the expression of myosin heavy chain proteins specific to both slow oxidative (MHC1) and fast 
glycolytic (MHC2) muscle fibers (Fig. 3A,B). Interestingly, antagonist treatment did not alter muscle-specific 
MHC protein expression as the drug failed to significantly induce MHC1 expression in the gastrocnemius mus-
cle, where it is not predominantly expressed, but stimulated both MHC1 and MHC2 expression in the soleus. 
With the observed increase in myosin heavy chain expression and stabilization in total lean mass considered, 
we decided to quantify the myofiber cross sectional areas in vehicle and SR8278 treated mice. Antagonist treat-
ment marginally increased cross-sectional area and stimulated regeneration, evidenced by central nuclei, in the 
tibialis anterior specifically, but not the gastrocnemius (Fig. 3C) analogous to what has been observed previously 
in rodent models of acute muscle injury26.These results imply that antagonizing REV-ERB stimulates myogenic 
programs that enhance the expression of structural myosin heavy chains and may selectively stabilize lean mass 
in a muscle specific manner.
REV-ERB antagonists promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative fiber phenotype. 
 
Mitochondrial biogenesis and activity are disregulated in DMD30. As a consequence, the oxidative capacity and 
prevalence of active oxidative fibers is reduced in dystrophic SkM. In order to further elucidate the mechanism 
through which SR8278 was improving muscle function and stabilizing lean mass we decided to assess the influ-
ence of REV-ERB antagonism on mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle fiber type. SR8278 treatment induced 
expression of a number of mitochondrial factors including Tfam, Pgc1a, Nampt, Sirt3 and Nrf1 in dystrophic 
soleus and gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 4A), implying that mitochondrial biogenesis was enhanced by SR8278. 
Immunofluorescent fiber type profiling further revealed that SR8278 specifically increased the ratio of type IIa 
oxidative fibers relative to type IIb glycolytic fibers in SkM (Fig. 4B). In accord with this, the number of muscle 
fibers positive for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, a histological marker for oxidative muscle fibers, 
was also significantly increased by SR8278 treatment (Fig. 4C). Based on these analyses it appears that REV-ERB 
antagonism promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhanced the oxidative fiber content and capacity of 
dystrophic muscle.
REV-ERB inhibition enhances Wnt and Notch signaling in SkM. 
Wnt and Notch control devel-
opmental signaling pathways that have key roles in muscle repair and satellite cell self-renewal. DMD patients 
display altered SkM Notch signaling that has been proven to be essential to satellite cell self-renewal and indis-
pensable for the maintenance of SC quiescence31–33. During muscle repair, the Wnt transcription factor β
-catenin 
(CTNNB1) mediates Wnt target-gene transcriptional regulation during satellite cell, proliferation, differentia-
tion and fusion with myotubes34–41. Previous studies have also shown that activation of canonical Wnt signa-
ling was therapeutic in rodent models of muscular dystrophy and acute injury39,42–45. We examined whether 
REV-ERB antagonism may also be modulating Notch and Wnt signaling activity in SkM. We discovered that 
SR8278 treatment increased both Notch (Numb, Notch) and Wnt target-gene expression (Hes6, Hey1) (Fig. 5A). 
This upregulation of Wnt and Notch target genes in mice receiving SR8278 correlated with enhanced expression 
of the cell cycle progression regulators p21 and cyclin-dependent kinase A2 (Ccna2), which promote myoblast 
differentiation (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, Pax7 expression, a marker for SkM satellite cells, was also significantly 
upregulated in SR8278 treated muscle (Fig. 5B). SR8278 inhibited Ctnnb1 phosphorylation at Ser37 (Fig. 5C), a 
casein kinase 1 binding site that promotes Ctnnb1 proteasomal degradation and suppresses Wnt transcriptional 
activity34,36. SR8278 also promoted stabilization of total Ctnnb1 protein levels and increased protein expression of 
the Wnt target gene Axin2 (Fig. 5C). Immunohistological assessment of Pax7 expression revealed an increase in 
the number Pax7+ cells along the myofibers margins in SR8278 treated mice (Fig. 5D). Collectively these obser-
vations suggest that antagonizing REV-ERB modulates Wnt and Notch signaling to increase Pax7+ populations 
in dystrophic muscle.
Another factor that influences muscle turnover, the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the SkM is involved in 
degrading sarcomeric proteins and myogenic response factors to promote muscle atrophy46. The muscle specific 
E3 ubiquitin ligases MURF-1 and MAF-BX tag proteins for 26 S proteasome mediated degradation and genetic 
ablation of these two factors protected mice from muscular atrophy47. In addition, MURF-1 and MAF-BX specif-
ically are key mediators of the degradation of myosin heavy chains and MYOD48. We found that both MURF-1 
and MAF-BX expression were downregulated by SR8278 treatment in soleus and gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 5E). 
These findings suggest that REV-ERB inhibition slows myofiber protein turnover by reducing expression of 
MURF-1 and MAF-BX.

Rev-Erb regulates Wnt signaling downstream of Wnt receptor activation in muscle cells. 
Based 
on the observed activation of Wnt in response to REV-ERB antagonism, we attempted to identify at which part of 
the Wnt pathway SR8278 may be mediating its effect. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of siRNA-mediated knock-
down of REV-ERBα
/β
 on Wnt transcriptional activity in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. shRNA-mediated 
knock down of REV-ERBβ
 expression induced the Wnt signaling genes Axin2, Ctnnb1, and Tcf3 (Fig. 6A). 
Secondly, we used the REV-ERB agonist SR9011 and antagonist SR8278 to elucidate whether Wnt target gene 
transcription was dependent on REV-ERB transcriptional activity. We observed that the REV-ERB agonist 
SR9011 and antagonist SR8278 reciprocally modulated Wnt activity in myoblasts (Fig. 6B). These observa-
tions coupled with that of mdx mouse muscle confirmed that REV-ERB expression and transcriptional sup-
pression specifically inhibited Wnt signaling in myoblasts. To further probe this relationship between Wnt and 
REV-ERB we attempted to identify if REV-ERB’s influence on Wnt target gene expression could be enhanced by 
Wnt pathway activation and blunted by Wnt inhibition. We co-treated myoblasts with lithium chloride (LiCl), 
which disrupts CTNNB1 proteasomal degradation and enhances Wnt pathway activity and SR8278. As expected, 
SR8278 treatment and LiCl independently induced Wnt-target gene expression (Axin2) (Fig. 6C). In addition, 
co-treatment of myoblasts with SR8278 and LiCl had an additive effect on Wnt target gene expression (Fig. 6C).

The Wnt inhibitor wnt-C59 prevents the palmitylation of Wnt ligands by Porcupine, Wnt ligand secretion and 
receptor mediated pathway activation49. To identify whether REV-ERB suppressed Wnt signaling upstream 
of Wnt receptor activation we assessed the combined effects of the Wnt inhibitor wnt-C59 on Wnt target gene 
expression in the presence or absence of SR8278. We observed that in cells treated with wnt-C59, SR8278 was 
unable to stimulate Axin2 expression (Fig. 6D). These results support the concept that REV-ERB modulates Wnt 
signaling likely through an intracellular mechanism that is downstream of Wnt ligand-mediated activation.
Discussion
Muscular dystrophy is a devastating muscle wasting disease that has no restorative clinical treatment. Previous 
work has shown that the circadian clock influences muscle repair and demonstrated the REV-ERB antagonists 
can be utilized to promote regenerative repair during acute injury22,23,26,50,51. This led us to test the therapeutic 
utility of a REV-ERB antagonist in a mouse muscular dystrophy model. Overall, we found that SR8278 effectively

stabilized lean mass, improved SkM function, reduced fibrosis and stimulated SkM repair and mitochondrial 
biogenesis in dystrophic muscle.
Our investigation also revealed that mdx mice treated with SR8278 displayed lower intramuscular fibrosis. 
Fibrotic tissue deposits, the result of excessive buildup of extracellular matrix components into the bedding of 
muscle fibers, forms a mechanical barrier that restricts the formation of neuronal synapses and blocks myoblast 
expansion to repair damaged myofibers52. Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages are one of the first innate immune 
cells to respond to muscle injury and are considered key to the healing process53. Conversely, anti-inflammatory 
M2 macrophages secrete a variety of growth factors that stimulate fibrogenesis. TGF-β
 is a well characterized 
factor that stimulates the switching of pro-inflammatory macrophages into the M2 anti-inflammatory pheno-
type54. Notably, in pre-brown adipocytes, REV-ERB can promote differentiation by suppressing the TGF-β
/
Smad2 pathway55. REV-ERB is also a well-characterized transcriptional regulator of macrophage activity54,56,57. 
It is however unknown whether TGF-β
 activity in macrophages is influenced by REV-ERB. Based on the inhib-
itory affect SR8278 had on intramuscular fibrosis, our observations suggest that SR8278 inhibition may be pro-
moting pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage activity. However, whether REV-ERB can regulate muscle fibrosis by 
selecting for an M1 macrophage phenotype within the SkM microenvironment should be the subject of future 
investigations.
Muscle degradation is mediated by a collection of exogenous and endogenous factors that stimulate proteol-
ysis. The E3 ubiquitin ligases MURF-1 and MAFbx tag myogenic factors and structural proteins for proteasomal 
degradation. Our investigations revealed that SR8278 decreased the expression of MURF-1 and MAF-BX in the 
soleus muscle. TNFα
 and IL-6 are both known myokines that induce muscle degradation by activating MURF-1 
and MAF-BX. Previously it has been shown that the overexpression of Rev-erbα
 sensitized smooth muscle cells 
to TNFα
 and increased IL-6 expression58. It is not yet known if REV-ERBα
 or REV-ERBβ
 can induce myokine 
secretion, however, ablating CLOCK expression with siRNAs modulates myokine expression including IL-6 in 
human myotubes59. Further studies should be designed to determine if REV-ERB can modulate IL-6 secretion 
from myofibers.
Myogenic response factors are master regulators of SkM regeneration. We observed a robust increase of 
myogenic response factor expression, suggesting REV-ERB antagonism mediated muscle regeneration in mdx 
SkM. Bmal1 expression, a direct REV-ERB target gene has been associated with the stimulation of muscle repair 
through activation of Wnt signaling. We speculated therefore that REV-ERB may also regulate Wnt signaling in 
SkM. Our results suggest that REV-ERB can regulate Wnt signaling by stabilizing CTNNB1 downstream of Wnt 
receptor activation. Whether cross talk between REV-ERB and Wnt signaling pathways in muscle is dependent 
on Bmal or other circadian factors remains to be determined.
In mdx muscle the SC population was also increased by pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERB. 
Investigations by Chaterjee et al. showed that Bmal1 deficient mice displayed a reduction in Pax7+ SC through 
a yet to be described mechanism22,23. As REV-ERB is a repressor of Bmal1 transcription, our results suggest 
that SR8278 may be inducing SC self-renewal through Bmal1. However, in this and other studies, the observed 
effects of REV-ERB antagonism are more pleiotropic than can be accounted for by BMAL1 and CLOCK regulated 
transcription and appear to be directed more by tissue specific factors such as Nuclear Factor-Y and Hepatocyte 
Nuclear Factor 626,60. However, whether the circadian clock is integral to the process of REV-ERB directed muscle

repair is unclear. RNA seq analysis of muscle samples from patients with collagen VI myopathies have linked 
aberrant circadian regulation to deregulation of autophagy genes, with the effect on collagen VI regulation mir-
rored in Bmal1 knockout mice61. While the contributions of diurnal fluctuations to muscle turnover have been 
identified22,23,62 it is uncertain what circadian factors contribute to DMD dystrophinopathy.
Mitochondrial dysfunction, defined by lower energy capacity and high ROS production, are secondary physi-
ological features of DMD that further exacerbate the dystrophic phenotype63,64. Activation of mitochondrial bio-
genesis and a switch to oxidative fiber types have been shown to help ameliorate dystrophic decline in mdx mouse 
models65,66. The effects of a REV-ERB antagonist on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity were previ-
ously unknown. Here, SR8278 increased the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes and ushered a switch 
to enhanced oxidative fiber activity in dystrophic SkM. In contrast, previous studies investigating REV-ERB lig-
ands in SkM found that activating the receptor increased oxidative gene expression and stimulated mitochondrial 
biogenesis in mouse muscle50. REV-ERB expression decreases during muscle differentiation and its expression 
has been shown to inhibit myotube formation26,28. Conversely, Nr1d1 knockout mice have reduced skeletal mus-
cle function and reduced lean mass. It has been demonstrated that REV-ERB promoter occupancy is distinct 
in differentiating and fully differentiated myoblasts26. The regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative 
metabolism by REV-ERBs may therefore be dependent on the dynamics of REV-ERB promoter/enhancing bind-
ing in proliferating versus fully differentiated muscle. It is also important to note that muscle pathophysiology 
is also distinct in normal versus dystrophic mice. Dystrophic muscle undergoes rapid cycles of SkM destruction 
and repair that does not occur in normal differentiated muscle. Considering mitochondrial biogenesis is substan-
tially elevated during muscle differentiation, it is possible that REV-ERB ligands may stimulate mitochondrial 
biogenesis through distinct or context specific mechanisms. Our results certainly affirm that REV-ERB antag-
onists enhance mitochondrial activity by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis factor expression. The underlying 
mechanisms that may drive the varied activity of REV-ERB and its ligands in different models remain undefined. 
Nevertheless, this investigation highlights that targeted inhibition of REV-ERB activity may be a highly effective 
approach for treating muscular dystrophies.
Methods
Mice. 
C57BL/10ScSn-Dmdmdx/J (mdx) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All 
mice were housed in a 12h-12h light-dark cycle and received a standard chow diet. Mice were allowed food and 
water ad libitum. Mdx mice (n = 10) were dosed once a day by subcutaneous injections for 6-weeks. SR8278 
(25 mg/kg) was dissolved in a 5:5:90 DMSO/cremophor/PBS vehicle. At the conclusion of the study mice were 
sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Mouse experimental procedures were approved 
by the Saint Louis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (SLU-IACUC protocol#2474). All 
procedures were performed in accordance with the SLU-IACUC guidelines and regulations.
Body Composition Analysis. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses were conducted once a week 
on mdx mice from 10-week old (n = 10 per group) until 16 weeks of age by utilizing a Bruker BioSpin LF50 Body 
Composition Analyzer (Bruker, Billerica, Massachusetts). Statistically significant differences in lean, fat and fluid 
mass were determined by 2-way ANOVA with an alpha set at 0.05.
Grip Strength. 
Hind limb and forelimb grip strength was tested simultaneously with a digital force instru-
ment (BIOSEB) as described previously67. At 16 weeks of age mdx mice (n = 10) were subjected to 3 grip strength 
tests with a minimum of 10-minute rest intervals between each test. To reduce user-specific bias, each blinded 
researcher (2 total) administered tests on two separate cohorts of mice. Measured values from these experi-
ments were pooled and analyzed. Statistical significance between the respected groups was determined using an 
unpaired, two-tailed student’s t-test with an alpha set at 0.05.
Blood Plasma Chemistry Analysis. 
For all in vivo experiments mouse blood samples were collected 
via cardiac puncture and isolated plasma was analyzed by the COBAS c311 system (Roche) assay kit for liver 
enzymes. Data was subjected to a student’s t-test.
Immunohistochemistry. 
Muscle samples from mdx mice where frozen in OCT. Muscle samples were sec-
tioned at 10 microns and blocked with 5% donkey, 1% BSA, 0.25% Tween20 for 30 minutes at room temperature. 
A rabbit polyclonal anti-Pax7 (dilution1:500; Abcam ab34360, Cambridge, UK) was incubated overnight at 4 °C 
in a humidity chamber. Secondary (anti-rabbit Cy3 1:100) was incubated for 1 hour in a humidity chamber at 
room temperature. The tissues were blocked again with 5% Rabbit serum in 1x PBS with 1% BSA, 2hrs in a 
humidity chamber at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Laminin (dilution1:500; Sigma-Aldrich L9393, 
St. Louis, MO) was incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidity chamber. Secondary AB (anti-Rb 488 1:300) was 
incubated at room temperature for an hour in a humidity chamber. The muscle tissue was then exposed to 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. Prolong gold with DAPI was added and the slides were 
cover slipped. Pax7 + satellite cells where identified by co-localization with laminin. Relative Pax7 + satellite cell 
numbers where quantified by utilizing ImageJ software described previously6.
Masson’s Trichrome. 
Diaphragm muscle samples were fixed overnight in 4% formalin and then embedded 
in paraffin. Muscle samples where sectioned and stained. Paraffin embedded muscle sections where stained using 
a Masson’s trichrome staining procedure. Staining was quantified using ImageJ as described previously6.
H&E Staining. 
Muscle samples (gastrocnemius) were fixed overnight in 4% formalin and then embedded in 
paraffin. Paraffin embedded muscle sections where stained by a standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) protocol

DM750 microscope (Buffalo Grove, IL).
Picrosirius Red. 
Gastrocnemius samples were fixed overnight in 4% formalin and then embedded in paraf-
fin. Paraffin embedded muscle sections where stained by a standard picrosirius red staining protocol (Histowiz, 
Brooklyn NY). Slide images were taken by a Leica MC120 HD (Buffalo Grove, IL) attached to a Leica DM750 
microscope (Buffalo Grove, IL). Staining was quantified using ImageJ as described previously6.
Succinate Dehydrogenase Staining. 
Fresh cryo-sections (10 μ
m) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 
incubation medium (50 mM phosphate buffer, sodium succinate 13.5 mg/ml, NBT 10 mg/ml in water) placed 
in a Coplin Jar and then rinsed section in PBS. After staining, sections were fixed in 10% formalin-PBS solution 
for 5 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed in 15% alcohol for 5 minutes. Slides were mounted with an 
aqueous medium and sealed.
Fiber Type Immunostaining. 
10 μ
m frozen sections were incubated with Mouse on Mouse IgG Blocking 
(Vector Lab) for 1 h at room temperature then washed 2 times in PBS. Sections were then incubated with a mix-
ture of BA-D5 (Myosin Heavy Chain Type I), SC-71 (Myosin Heavy Chain Type IIa), BF-F3 (Myosin Heavy Chain 
Type IIb) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) for 45 min at 37 °C, in PBS-1%BSA. Sections were washed 
3 times in PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature and then incubated with a mixture of the following second-
ary antibodies: anti-mouse IgG2b-Alexa405, IgG1-Alexa488, IgM-Alexa594 (ThermoFisher), all made in goat, 
diluted in PBS-1%BSA, for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Sections were washed for 5 minutes, 3 times with PBS at room 
temperature and mounted with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR. 
Total RNA was isolated from muscle tissue by using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) 
and a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion) for C2C12 and human primary cells. Isolated RNA (1 μ
g) was reverse 
transcribed into cDNA by using qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Inc.). Primer sequences were 
designed using IDT primer design (Coralville, IA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with SYBR Select 
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with select primers. Gene expression for mouse tissue and cells were normal-
ized to Gapdh.
Immunoblotting. 
Cells and muscle tissues were lysed using RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. The 
extracted proteins were flash frozen and stored at −
80 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and trans-
ferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed and incubated with primary antibodies over night at 
4 °C. Primary antibodies utilized for immunostaining were rabbit monoclonal myosin heavy chain 2 (dilution 
1:1000; Abcam ab91506, Cambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal myosin heavy chain 1 (dilution 1:2000; Abcam 
ab11083, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-MURF-1 (dilution 1:1000, Abcam ab77577, Cambridge, UK),

Signaling Technology 2151 S, Danvers, Massachusetts), rabbit polyclonal anti-p-β
catenin ser37 (dilution 1:1000, 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-101651, Dallas, Texas), rabbit polyclonal anti-β
catenin (dilution 1:1000, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology sc-1496R, Dallas, Texas), mouse monoclonal anti-β
-actin HRP linked (dilution1:5000; Abcam 
ab20272, Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-PGC1α
 (dilution 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-1307, 
Dallas, Texas), and rabbit polyclonal anti-TFAM (dilution 1:500, Abcam ab131607, Cambridge, UK). Secondary 
HRP linked antibodies (dilution 1:3000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific) detection was conducted by MP ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad). The quan-
tification of target protein was conducted in Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). The density ratios of target protein 
were normalized to β
-actin levels.
C2C12 Cell Culture. 
C2C12 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, Virginia). Passage 3–7 C2C12 
mouse myoblasts were proliferated in 15% fetal bovine serum in Gibco Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium 
(DMEM) supplemented with GlutaMAX. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 
Cells were split when 50–60% confluent. Before differentiation, 90% confluent C2C12 cells were exposed to 5 μ
M 
of SR8278 or SR9011 for 24 hours in 15% FBS. Cells were then induced to differentiate by exchanging the prolif-
eration media with fusion media (2% horse serum in Gibco DMEM). RNA extraction was conducted by lysing 
the cells with 350uL of Ambion Lysis buffer. Cells were frozen and mRNA extraction and purification conducted 
in accordance to protocol.
Lentiviral Infection and Induction of shRNAs. 
SMARTvector Lentiviral Mouse Nr1d1 (or Nr1d2) 
mCMV-TurboGFP shRNA by Dharmacon RNAi Technologies (Lafayette, CO) were allowed to infect 15,000 
proliferating C2C12 cells for 48 hours. Cells were split and seeded at a density of 15,000 in six-well plates. 
Twenty-four hours later cell selection was conducted by exposing the cells to 4 μ
g/mL of puromyocin. The shRNA 
mediated knock down of Nr1d1 or Nr1d2 in C2C12 cells was induced by doxycycline (1 μ
g/mL) exposure for 
48 hours in select media (fusion or proliferation). Gene expression was utilized to assess targeted knock down 
when compared to a GFP expressing only control cell line.

Wnt Modulators. 
After 48 hours of differentiating, cells where exposed to 5uM of SR8278 in a DMSO vehicle 
with or without the presence of LiCl (10 mM, Sigma Aldrich) or WntC59 (100uM, Bio-Techne) for 48 hours. The 
media with ligand and/or wnt modulators where replenished every 24 hours. The C2C12 cells were then lysed and 
their RNA isolated for future qPCR analysis.
