BACKGROUND: The authors examined racial/ethnic differences in patient perspectives regarding their breast cancer treatment expe-
riences. METHODS: A weighted random sample of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer between 2013 and 2015 in Los
Angeles County and Georgia were sent surveys 2 months after undergoing surgery (5080 women; 70% response rate). The analytic
sample was limited to patients residing in Los Angeles County (2397 women). RESULTS: The pattern of visits with different specialists
before surgery was found to be similar across racial/ethnic groups. Low acculturated Latinas (Latinas-LA) were less likely to report
high clinician communication quality for both surgeons and medical oncologists (<69% vs >72% for all other groups; P<.05). The per-
centage of patients who reported high satisfaction regarding how physicians worked together was similar across racial/ethnic groups.
Latinas-LA were more likely to have a low autonomy decision style (48% vs 24%-50% for all other groups; P<.001) and were more
likely to report receiving too much information versus other ethnic groups (20% vs <16% for other groups; P<.001). Patients who
reported a low autonomy decision style were more likely to rate the amount of information they received for the surgery decision as
“too much” (16% vs 9%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be moderate disparity in breast cancer treatment communication
and decision-making experiences reported by Latinas-LA versus other groups. The approach to treatment decision making
by Latinas-LA represents an important challenge to health care providers. Initiatives are needed to improve patient engagement in
decision making and increase clinician awareness of these challenges in this patient population. Cancer 2017;123:3022-30. V

INTRODUCTION
Efforts to improve cancer care delivery and outcomes have markedly changed the treatment experience for patients.1-3 A
key focus of these efforts has been reducing racial and ethnic disparities in the quality of treatment offered and improving
the patient experience during and after treatment.4 Strategies that have been implemented include multidisciplinary
approaches to treatment management, the use of care navigators to support patient decision making and care coordina-
tion, and a greater focus on patient support into survivorship. Taken together, these initiatives have the potential to reduce
disparities in the treatment experience. However, the main focus has been on reducing disparities between African Ameri-
can and white patients. Indeed, recently published research has suggested that disparities in the initiation of treatment
between these groups are small, perhaps reflecting the successes of these initiatives.5-11 To the best of our knowledge, less
is known regarding the treatment experiences of Latinas, a large and growing segment of the oncology patient population.
Although Latinas represent approximately 15% of patients with breast cancer in the United States,12 understanding
Latina breast cancer treatment disparities is complicated by the fact that the US Latina population comprises individuals
from many countries and diverse levels of acculturation. Furthermore, a large sample is required to disentangle cultural

 factors from socioeconomic status (SES) factors because
the majority of Latinas with low acculturation (Latinas-
LA) also have low levels of education.
Latinas may be uniquely subject to disparate treat-
ment due to language, cultural barriers, or fears of dis-
crimination.13 For example, language limitations may
make it more difficult to communicate with their pro-
viders and cultural values may discourage assertiveness
and engagement, even when language skills are adequate.
This may lead to differences in patient attitudes regarding
treatment, the kind of treatment they receive, or their
appraisal of the treatment experience. We examined
racial/ethnic differences in the perspectives of patients
with breast cancer regarding their treatment experiences,
focusing on those of Latina patients of low and high accul-
turation, including practice factors and physician factors,
attitudes regarding decision making, and appraisal of
communication with clinicians.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Data Collection
The Individualized Cancer Care (iCanCare) Study is a
population-based survey study of women with early-stage
breast cancer and their providers. We identified and
accrued a total of 7810 women aged 20 to 79 years with
newly diagnosed, early-stage breast cancer (AJCC 7th Edi-
tion stages I-II) as reported to the Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology, and End Results (SEER) registries of Georgia and
Los Angeles County (LAC) from 2013 through 2015.
Women were accrued on a monthly basis and Latinas
were oversampled using a novel and valid approach based
on patient surnames that were available at time of accru-
al.14 Patient surnames were compared with a list of names
provided by the US Census Bureau, of whom �50% indi-
cated Hispanic ethnicity on the 2000 US census. All
patients with surnames on the list were selected into the
iCanCare accrued sample. Patients were ineligible if they
had stage III or IV disease, Paget disease, or tumors mea-
suring >5 cm; resided outside of the registry areas; or
could not complete a questionnaire in English or Spanish
(507 patients). Of the remaining 7303 eligible women
who were mailed surveys, 5080 completed the survey,
resulting in a 70% response rate (68%, 67%, 65%, and
73%, for Latina, African American, Asian, and white
women, respectively). We limited the analytic sample for
this study to patients residing in LAC because <3% of
breast cancer cases in Georgia occur among Latinas.
Women with missing data regarding race also were
excluded from the analysis. The details regarding the
analytic sample of 2397 women are shown in Supporting
Information Figure 1.
Patients were identified shortly after diagnosis based
on initial surgical pathology reports derived from a list of
“definitive” surgical procedures (performed with the
intent of removing the entire tumor and obtaining clear
margins). Surveys were mailed approximately 2 months
after surgery, with a median time from diagnosis to survey
completion of 6.5 months (standard deviation, 3.2
months). Women were asked about their treatment expe-
rience, knowledge and attitudes, appraisal of clinician
communication, and their decision-making process. To
encourage response, we provided a $20 cash incentive and
used a modified Dillman approach to patient recruitment,
including reminders to nonrespondents.15 All materials
were sent in English and Spanish to those with Spanish
surnames.14 A native Spanish-speaking project manager
in LAC engaged all patients in follow-up, which included
the offer of a full telephone interview if requested (and 19
completed) and recontact to complete missing data.
Responses to the survey then were merged with clinical
data by the SEER registries and a deidentified analytic
data set was created. The study was approved by the Uni-
versity of Michigan Institutional Review Board and the
state and Institutional Review Boards of the SEER
registries.
Measures
The patient questionnaire content was guided by concep-
tual framework from a larger P01 Program Project sup-
porting this analysis (grant P01CA163233), our prior
work,16 research questions, and hypotheses. The items
used in this analysis were taken from the P01 Program
Project survey, in which we included established measures
when available and developed new measures when neces-
sary,
drawing
from
the
literature
and
our
prior
research.13,17-19 We used standard techniques to assess
content validity, including review by survey design
experts; cognitive pretesting with 50 patients with breast
cancer; and pilot studies in selected clinic populations,
including several with low SES patient populations. Near-
ly 100 instruments were reviewed and considered for
inclusion in the patient survey. Survey measures for the
program project questionnaire were compiled in a com-
prehensive catalogue describing constructs, pilot results,
scoring details, and whether the measure had been previ-
ously developed in both English and Spanish. After ques-
tionnaire development, we posted any newly developed
measures on our team Web site and the National Cancer
Institute’s

 dissemination to other researchers. A Spanish version of
the questionnaire was created using professional transla-
tion services and reviewed again by native Spanish-
speaking project staff.
Practice and management factors
Patients were asked how they found out about the diagno-
sis of breast cancer (radiologist who performed the biopsy,
primary care physician, surgeon or surgeon’s nurse, or
other), which types of specialists they consulted with
before undergoing surgery, and what type of treatment
they received (type of surgical management, radiotherapy,
chemotherapy).
To assess perceived care coordination across clini-
cians, we asked respondents “During your breast cancer
care, how satisfied were you with how your doctors
worked together” (5-point Likert scale from “not at all” to
“extremely satisfied”).
Informal decision support
We asked patients to indicate how frequently family or
friends engaged in treatment decision making by asking
whether they: 1) attended physician appointments when
decisions about treatment plans were made; and 2) took
notes for the respondent during the physician’s appoint-
ment (each on 5-point Likert scales from “never” to “very
often”).
Attitudes and beliefs regarding treatment decision
making
We first assessed patient decision style with a single-item
query: “When it came to getting treatment for breast can-
cer, I wanted my doctor to tell me what do” (5-point Lik-
ert scale from “none” to “all of the time”). Patients with a
low autonomy decision style were defined as those
patients who responded that they wanted their physician
to tell them what to do “all of the time.” We then assessed
the degree to which patients believed that they deliberated
or “thought through” their treatment, using a 4-item
“decision deliberation” scale derived from measures of
public deliberation adapted to apply to cancer treatment-
related decisions.20 Items assessed the extent to which a
patient weighed the pros and cons of a decision, how
much they thought through the issues important to the
decision, how much they talked to others while they were
making the decision, and how much they thought
through and spent time thinking about the decision, and
all had 5-point Likert scale response options (from “not at
all” to “very much”). An overall deliberation score was
created using the mean of the responses to the 4 items
(range, 1-5), with higher scores representing more deliber-
ation (alpha, .87). A score of �3 indicated a less delibera-
tive decision process. We used 3 items to assess a patient’s
perceptions regarding the adequacy of the amount of
information they received concerning specific treatments
using 1 item each for surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic
chemotherapy19 (response categories were not enough,
just right, too much, or not applicable if the physician did
not offer the treatment).
Patient assessment of clinician communication
quality
Clinician communication quality was examined using a
modified version of the Health Care Climate Question-
naire scale,21 a scale specifically developed to assess patient
perceptions of communication with clinicians. The scale
assessed 4 domains by asking patients to report how often
they thought their breast cancer clinicians (surgeon or
oncologist was assessed separately): 1) “Understood how I
saw things with respect to my breast cancer”; 2) “Listened
to how I would like to handle my breast cancer
treatment”; and 3) “Encouraged me to ask questions” (5-
point Likert scale from “not at all true” to “very true”).17
Responses were summed and a cutoff of �4.0 (“quite
true” or “very true”) was used to indicate high versus low
physician communication quality.
Sociodemographic and other covariates
Racial/ethnicity categories were derived from patient
report (white, black, Latina, Asian, and other). Latinas
were divided further into those with low acculturation
(Latinas-LA) and higher acculturation (Latinas-HA)
based on the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics
(SASH), which has been widely used to assess accultura-
tion in Hispanics and previously was validated by our
team in the Latina breast cancer population. The SASH
includes 5 items related to the use of Spanish language in
different contexts (reading, speaking, and thinking). Fol-
lowing methodologies developed and published in prior
work, we summed and dichotomized the measure into
low-score versus higher score groups using a median
split.14 Low scores on the binary measure were an indica-
tion of low acculturation (Latinas-LA). We also assessed
age, educational level, and health literacy using the single-
item validated measure.22 Additional patient-reported
variables included country of origin, well-being at the
time of survey completion (general self-reported health
status ranging from poor to excellent), and number of
medical comorbidities (0, 1, or �2) derived from a list
pertinent to patients with cancer. We also included the

completion.23
Statistical Analysis
We first described the distribution of population charac-
teristics, practice and management factors, attitudes and
beliefs about treatment decision making, informal deci-
sion support, and perceived care coordination by race/eth-
nicity. We then examined the percentage of patients who
reported low autonomy decision style, low treatment
deliberation, and low appraisal of the amount of informa-
tion they received regarding the surgery decision by race/
ethnicity. These are presented as marginal probabilities
based on multivariable logistic models that adjust for age,
education, health status, comorbidities, health literacy,
country of origin, months between diagnosis and survey
completion, and treatments received. All models incorpo-
rated survey and nonresponse weights so that statistical
inference was representative of the target population.
Finally, we evaluated the relationship between patient
reports of the adequacy of the amount of information
received regarding the surgery decision and treatment
decision style controlling for other factors.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows that the population was diverse with regard
to education (approximately one-third of patients with an
educational level of �high school), age (approximately
25% of patients aged �50 years), and health literacy
(approximately one-half of patients with low health litera-
cy). Latinas-LA were found to be much more likely than
other groups to have a lower educational level, to be of a
younger age, to have low health literacy, and to have a
poorer health status. Approximately 66% of the respond-
ents reported they were born in Mexico, 21% in Central
America, 8% in other Latin American countries, and 4%
in the United States. The average number of years in the
United States among first-generation Latinas was 30
(standard deviation, 12 years). The Asian patient popula-
tion was very diverse (43% Filipino, 26% Chinese, 11%
Korean, 11% Japanese, 4% Vietnamese, and 1% Asian
Indian). Approximately 42% of patients found out about
their diagnosis from a radiologist, 25% from their prima-
ry care physician, and 33% from their surgeon or sur-
geon’s office, with no significant differences noted with
regard to the source of diagnosis between Latinas-LA and
other racial/ethnic groups. Rates of breast-conserving
surgery varied from 50% among Asians to 71% among

the complexity of surgical treatment decision making.9,24
Table 2 shows the distribution of practice and deci-
sion appraisal factors by race/ethnicity. Patient reports of
visits with different specialists before undergoing surgery
were found to be very similar across racial/ethnic groups.
Although there was similarly high appraisal regarding
how physicians worked together during the breast cancer
care continuum across racial/ethnic groups, when com-
pared with other racial/ethnic subgroups, Latinas-LA
were found to be less likely to report high clinician com-
munication quality for both surgeons and medical oncol-
ogists (<69% vs >72% for all other groups; P<.05). It is
important to note that patients reported a very high fre-
quency of engagement of informal decision support.
Nearly 75% of patients reported that a decision supporter
often/very often attended visits and approximately one-
half reported that the support person took notes often/
very often. Latinas-LA had particularly high engagement
of a decision support person: for example, 61% of
Latinas-LA had a note taker often/very often compared
with 48% to 57% for other ethnic groups (P 5 .007).
Figure 1 Top and Bottom show the marginal per-
centages of patients who reported a low autonomy deci-
sion style and low treatment deliberation by race/
ethnicity, respectively, from a multivariable logistic
regression analysis controlling for age, education, health
status, comorbidities, health literacy, country of origin,
months between diagnosis and survey completion, and
treatments received. The rates of both low autonomy deci-
sion style and low treatment deliberation varied signifi-
cantly by race (P<.001 and P 5 .008, respectively).
Overall, 34% of patients reported a low autonomy deci-
sion style. Latinas-LA were more likely to have a low
autonomy decision style (48% vs 24%, 36%, 50%, and
33% for white women, African American women, Asian
women, and Latinas-HA, respectively; P<.001). Approxi-
mately one-third of respondents (35%) reported low
deliberation (45% vs 32%, 29%, 38%, and 37% for white
women, African American women, Asian women, and
Latinas-HA, respectively; P 5 .006).
Figure 2 shows marginal distribution of patient
appraisal of the amount of information received regarding
the surgery decision by race and ethnicity from a multivari-
able logistic regression analysis adjusting for the factors
shown above. Latinas-LA were more likely to report receiv-
ing too much information (vs just right or too little) com-
pared with other racial/ethnic groups (20% vs 7%, 10%,
16%, and 12% for white women, African American wom-
en, Asian women, and Latinas-HA, respectively; P<.001).
Patients who reported a low autonomy decision style were
more likely to rate the amount of information received for
the surgery decision as too much (16% vs 8%; P<.001).
DISCUSSION
The findings in this large, diverse, and contemporary sam-
ple of patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer rein-
force the special challenges Latinas-LA face when
engaging health care providers after a diagnosis of cancer.
Latinas-LA were found to have much lower levels of edu-
cation and health literacy. Combined with low English
fluency, these factors represent formidable barriers to
high-quality communication and treatment decision
making after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Nevertheless, we
observed a remarkable lack of disparity in several impor-
tant communication and treatment factors. We observed
no substantial racial/ethnic gradients in multidisciplinary
provider decision management or patient report of how

 well physicians worked together. Furthermore, Latinas
reported similarly high rates of engagement of informal
decision support from family members or friends, such as
attending a physician’s appointment or taking notes dur-
ing the appointment. Finally, rates of different treatments
were found to be similar across the racial/ethnic groups.
Taken together, this is strong evidence of the high quality
of treatment communication and decision making
reported by Latinas-LA, as well as by patients from other
racial/ethnic groups.
However, we did observe some key significant differ-
ences with regard to patient care and patient experiences
reported by Latinas compared with other patient groups.
First, Latinas appear to approach treatment decision mak-
ing differently from other cultural groups; we found that
Latinas were more likely to report low autonomy decision
styles (and thus are more likely to defer to clinicians) and
to report limited deliberation regarding treatment types.
It is interesting to note that Latinas-LA also were much
more likely to report that they received too much infor-
mation related to tests and treatments versus too little or
just the right amount of information. This raises the possi-
bility that a deferential decision style may lead to feeling
overwhelmed by the complexity of treatment decision
making for cancer. Indeed, the fact that Latinas-LA
reported a lower appraisal of surgeon and medical oncolo-
gist quality of communication suggests they do not believe
their providers are responding completely to their individ-
ual needs. This suggest a potential lack of cultural compe-
tency approaches to communication on the part of
clinicians,25 but also could be exacerbated by the lack of
specific interpreter services in some settings. We also not-
ed that Asians reported similar experiences with regard to
low autonomy decision style and potential information
overload. This reinforces that other ethnic groups may be
vulnerable because of cultural or language barriers.
The prior literature focused on Latina experiences
after a diagnosis of breast cancer is surprisingly sparse and
variably executed, and to the best of our knowledge few
studies to date have been population based13,16,26,27 and
these studies are dated. Other studies have been limited by
low response rates, small samples, or inadequate granular
measures of communication and decision making.28-31
Furthermore, these studies have tended to overreach with
regard to conclusions regarding the presence of disparities
based on very small differences between SES subgroups in
a limited number of clinical settings. Nevertheless overall,
the results of the current study identifying areas for
improving the engagement of Latina patients in treatment
decision making and patient-clinician communication are
consistent with prior work that calls for more culturally
tailored and patient-centered communication around
cancer treatment.16,25,32

 Aspects of the current study merit comment. We
oversampled Latinas using an innovative approach previ-
ously validated by our team14 and achieved a very high
response rate that was nearly comparable among Latinas
compared with other subgroups. We used established
granular measures to assess patient perspectives regarding
the treatment context and communication and decision
making. We used sample weights to account for the
sampling design and multiple imputation and sample
weighting to address missing values and differential non-
response. However, there are some limitations. Results are
generalizable to one large metropolitan area of the United
States containing >10 million individuals. As reflected in
the results of the current study, Latinas in LAC predomi-
nantly are from Mexico and Central America. Thus, the
results cannot necessarily be extended to Latinas from oth-
er areas of the world. We cannot exclude the possibility of
response bias due to different interpretations of questions
across cultural groups. We may have underrepresented
patients with very low literacy levels because the dominant
mode of inquiry was a written survey. We did not query
patients about translation services or language fluency of
the providers, although these factors are well-known bar-
riers to care.33-35 Finally, the results of the current study
regarding Asian patients are limited because of the highly
diverse array of ethnic minorities within this group (over a
dozen
different
Asian
populations
in
LAC)
and
translation of the questionnaire for each group was
beyond the scope of the study. Furthermore, our measure
of low acculturation, the SASH, to our knowledge has not
been adopted or validated in other ethnic groups.
Implications for Patient Care
Taken together, the results of the current study suggest
some positive news with regard to the lack of disparities in
some key aspects of breast cancer treatment, including
source of diagnosis, perceived coordination of services,
and type of treatment. Despite these similar patterns,
these results highlight that clinicians may face challenges
in engaging Latinas with low acculturation in optimal
treatment decision-making processes. Breast cancer deci-
sion making is increasingly complex and many patients
feel the burden of decision making after diagnosis. Pro-
viders are increasingly encouraged to achieve patient-
centered communication and shared decision making
with their patients, yet this may be particularly difficult if
patients are reluctant to participate. Latinas-LA may be
particularly vulnerable, given that they desire less engage-
ment in decision making and more often are overwhelmed
with the amount of information. Other groups, including
Asian Americans with low acculturation and language bar-
riers, also may be vulnerable to lower quality decision-
making processes. For these types of patients, cancer clini-
cians have a special responsibility to provide support in

 their navigation of decision making and deliberation
regarding treatment choices. Strategies to increase engage-
ment and address these issues in this patient population
could include communication skills and cultural compe-
tence training for clinicians.25 The fact that many patients
receive news of their diagnosis from nononcology pro-
viders underscores the need for this training even among
providers not directly connected to cancer care.
Another key opportunity is to better involve infor-
mal decision support persons in the decision-making pro-
cess. Indeed, the majority of patients (including Latinas-
LA) reported having someone in the examination room
and Latinas were most likely to have someone taking
notes. This may provide an opportunity for clinicians to
engage support persons to ensure that patients are com-
fortable with the information provided and proactive to
address deficits. Taken together, these initiatives could
ensure that shared decision making is optimally achieved
for this important and growing population of patients
with cancer who may face cultural or linguistic barriers.
