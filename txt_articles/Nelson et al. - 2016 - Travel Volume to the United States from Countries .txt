Introduction: Air, land, and sea transportation can facilitate rapid
spread of infectious diseases. In May 2015 the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika
virus infection in Brazil. As of March 8, 2016, the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had issued travel notices for
33 countries and 3 U.S. territories with local Zika virus transmission.
Methods: Using data from five separate datasets from 2014 and 2015,
we estimated the annual number of passenger journeys by air and
land border crossings to the United States from the 33 countries and 3

U.S. territories listed in the CDC’s Zika travel notices as of March 8,
2016. We also estimated the annual number of passenger journeys
originating in and returning to the United States (primarily on cruises)
with visits to seaports in areas with local Zika virus transmission.
Because of the adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes that have
been associated with Zika virus disease, the number of passenger
journeys completed by women of childbearing age and pregnant
women was also estimated.
Results: An estimated 216.3 million passenger journeys by air, land,
and sea are made annually to the United States from areas with local
Zika virus transmission (as of March 8). The destination states with
the largest numbers of arrivals were Texas (by land) and Florida (by
air and sea). An estimated 51.7 million passenger journeys were
made by women of childbearing age and an estimated 2.3 million
were made by pregnant women.
Conclusion: Travel volume analyses provide important information
that can be used to effectively target public health interventions as
well as direct public health resources and efforts at local, regional,
and country­specific levels.

Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes species
mosquitoes including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus . In
addition, Zika virus can pass from a pregnant woman to her fetus and
be sexually transmitted by a man to his partners . Though not
confirmed, there have also been reports of Zika virus transmission
from blood transfusions . In May 2015, the Pan American Health
Organization issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika virus
infections in Brazil . As of March 8, 2016, the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had issued 36 travel notices
for areas with local Zika transmission . The notices primarily advise

that pregnant women postpone travel to affected countries and U.S.
territories.
As of March 10, 2016, a total of 193 cases of Zika virus disease had
been reported in people in the United States who had recently been to
an area with local Zika virus transmission . In February 2016, CDC
published information on nine pregnant travelers with confirmed Zika
virus disease; 10 additional reports of Zika virus disease in pregnant
women were under investigation. Confirmed cases were reported
among women who had traveled to areas with local Zika virus
transmission .
Air, land, and sea transportation can facilitate rapid spread of
infectious diseases
. In the case of Zika, a travel­associated case
(imported case) could potentially introduce the virus into the local
mosquito population resulting in autochthonous transmission. The risk
of sexual transmission also extends beyond areas with active vector­
borne transmission. Understanding travel volume and demographics
among arrivals into the United States from areas with local Zika virus
transmission can be used to plan health education and risk
communication interventions as well as other response efforts in
potentially impacted communities and at ports of entry within the
United States. We report on the top origins and destinations of
passenger journeys between the United States and areas with local
Zika virus transmission. We present the number of arrivals to the
United States via air, land, and sea from areas with local Zika virus
transmission. We then provide estimates of the number of women,
women of childbearing age (15­44 years), and pregnant women
completing passenger journeys to the United States from areas with
local Zika virus transmission. Given growing evidence of a link
between Zika virus infection and adverse pregnancy and birth
outcomes, these estimates may help identify at­risk populations.
For this analysis, areas of interest include the 33 countries and 3 U.S.
territories with Zika virus travel notices issued by CDC as of March 3,
2016: American Samoa, Aruba, Barbados, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil,

Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala,
Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Marshall Islands, Martinique,
Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Vincent
and Grenadines, Saint Martin, Samoa, Sint Maarten, Suriname,
Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela.
This analysis draws from five separate datasets including Data In,
Intelligence Out, Market Intelligence, Fares and Market Sizes, Global
LLC (Diio Mi FMg, https://www.diio.net); the U.S. Department of
Transportation Origin and Destination Survey data as analyzed by
Diio (O&D); the Bureau of Transportation Statistics Border
Crossing/Entry Data (http://1.usa.gov/1nJpCkg); U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) Cruise and Charter Data; and CBP
Demographics by Mode of Transportation Data.
Using these datasets, we estimated the annual number of passenger
journeys by air and land border crossings to the United States and
U.S. territories from the 33 countries and 3 U.S. territories listed in the
CDC’s Zika travel notices as of March 3, 2016. We also estimated the
annual number of passenger journeys from and returning to the
United States (primarily on cruises) with visits to seaports in areas
with local Zika virus transmission. Because of the adverse fetal and
reproductive outcomes that have been linked with Zika virus disease,
the numbers of passenger journeys completed by women of
childbearing age and pregnant women were also estimated.
Travel to the United States includes travel to all 50 states, the District
of Columbia, and all U.S. territories. Gender and age distributions of
arrivals by geographic region were calculated using fiscal year 2015
data from CBP. The CBP dataset included information on age, gender,
origin, nationality, and mode of transportation for arrivals into the U.S.
from countries with local Zika virus transmission.
All CBP records are aggregated passenger counts; therefore, one
person might be counted and reported multiple times. For example,
arrivals entering the United States from the Mexico border might do so
on a daily basis for work or school.

To estimate the number of passenger journeys taken by pregnant
women, we first separated all of the data by mode of transportation
and then calculated the percentages of women and women of
childbearing age (15­44 years old) by region (i.e. South America,
North America, Caribbean, Central America, Africa, Oceana) for each
mode of transportation. For all modes of transportation, we estimated
that 4.5% of female arrivals between the ages of 15­44 are pregnant
at any time. The rate of 4.5% was determined by using an estimate of
5% of women pregnant at any time and adjusting for restrictions on
travel after 36 weeks gestation
.
Air Travel Data
Air travel data from countries with local Zika virus transmission were
obtained from Diio Mi FMg for January 2015 through December 2015.
For origins in U.S. territories with documented Zika virus transmission
(Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa), we used the
O&D dataset for October 2014 through September 2015. The
timeframes between the two datasets differed because of different
release dates. Reported counts for both datasets exclude crew
members. If an origin or destination city had multiple airports, data
from all airports for the city were pooled. For example, data from John
F. Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia International Airport
were combined into New York, New York data. Final destination
airport city indicates the end of the aviation trip, and does not
necessarily indicate where travelers end their overall journey. We
calculated the percentage of arrivals by women and arrivals by
women of childbearing age by region using CBP data because not all
regions have the same demographics of air arrivals.
Land Travel Data
Land travel data from Mexico into the United States was obtained
from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation
Statistics for January 2014 through December 2014. Arrival counts
included travel by personal vehicle, foot, bus, and train. CBP age and
gender distributions were applied to arrival counts to estimate the
number of arrivals by women and women of childbearing age.

Sea Travel Data
Seaport travel information, which includes cruise and charter data,
was obtained from CBP for October 2014 through September 2015.
This information differs from air and land travel data because seaport
passenger journeys originate at a U.S. seaport, travel to a country or
U.S. territory with local Zika virus transmission, and end in the same
origin U.S. seaport.
Air Travel
For countries with local Zika transmission, Diio FMg data used were
from January through December 2015. For U.S. territories with local
Zika transmission, DOT O&D data was used from October 2014
through September 2015. The data were merged to create an
aggregated 12­month dataset, including information for both countries
and U.S. territories. For the 12­month time period a total of
34,334,355 passenger journeys by air to the United States from 33
countries and 3 U.S. territories with local Zika virus transmission were
reported (Table 1).

Compared with 2014 data (31,992,504 air passenger journeys), the
United States experienced a 2.3 million passenger journey increase.
Mexico was the highest volume origin country, accounting for
12,143,735 (35%) of total air arrivals. The top five origin countries and
U.S. territories were Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Brazil
and Jamaica, which together accounted for 69% of the total air
arrivals (Table 2).

Analysis of CBP demographics data showed between 48­52% of air
arrivals into the United States from countries and U.S. territories with
local Zika virus transmission were women and 21­27% of air arrivals
were women of childbearing age (Table 6).

Applying these percentages, an estimated 17,367,810 (50.6%) of the
air arrivals were women. An estimated 8,635,626 (25.2%) were
women of childbearing age, and 388,603 (1.1%) were estimated to be
pregnant women (Table 1).
CBP demographic data indicated that approximately 50% of all the air
passenger journeys from areas with local Zika virus transmission were
completed by U.S. citizens. These data underestimate arrivals by
people residing in the United States who, in addition to U.S. citizens,
include permanent U.S. residents, long term visitors, students, and
holders of other visa types. Beyond these estimates, we are not able
to determine how many travelers remain in the United States and
seek medical care.
Land Travel
From January through December 2014, a total of 173,260,603
passenger journeys were made to the United States from Mexico by
land. Among these land­crossing arrivals, 129,243,838 (75%) traveled
by personal vehicle, 41,223,292 (24%) were made by pedestrians,
2,782,895 (2%) traveled by bus, and 10,500 (<1%) traveled by train
(Table 1). The top four land border crossings from Mexico to the
United States, regardless of mode of transportation, were San Ysidro,
California, Otay Mesa, California, El Paso, Texas, and Laredo, Texas.

CBP land arrival demographic percentages were applied and among
the 173,260,603 land­crossing arrivals entering the United States from
Mexico, an estimated 82,314,319 (47.5%) were women, an estimated
40,728,656 (23.5%) were women of childbearing age, and 1,832,789
(1%) were estimated to be pregnant (Table 1).
Of the total arrivals by land, an estimated 55% were Mexican citizens,
41% were U.S. citizens, and 4% were of other or unknown citizenship.
Similar to above, because of the limited data, we are not able to
determine how many travelers remain in the United States and seek
medical care.
Sea Travel
From October 2014 through September 2015, a total of 8,767,867
passenger journeys originated at a U.S. seaport and then visited a
seaport in an area with local Zika virus transmission before returning
to the origin U.S. seaport (Table 1). Most passenger journeys
originated from and returned to ports located in Florida; specifically,
Miami and Port Everglades (Table 7).

The top five Zika­impacted countries and U.S. territories visited while
cruising included Mexico, Saint Maarten, Saint Thomas (U.S. Virgin

Applying CBP sea arrival demographic percentages to the total
8,767,867 passenger journeys, we estimated that 4,603,130 (52.5%)
were completed by women, an estimated 2,314,020 (26.4%) were
completed by women of childbearing age, and 105,346 (1.2%) were
estimated to have been completed by pregnant women (Table 1).
Our analysis found that an estimated 216.3 million passenger
journeys (Table 1) are made to the United States each year from
areas with local Zika virus transmission. This represents roughly 60%
of the total annual travel volume (358.8 million passenger journeys)
into the United States from all international destinations. The
destination states with the largest numbers of arrivals from areas with
local Zika virus transmission include Texas (by land) and Florida (by
air and sea). The origin countries with the largest number of air and
land departures include Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic,
Brazil and Jamaica. Mexico, Sint Maarten, Saint Thomas (U.S. Virgin
Islands), Jamaica, and Haiti account for the top five Zika­impacted
countries and U.S. territories visited while cruising. Finally, we
estimated that 51.7 million of the total passenger journeys are
completed by women of childbearing age and 2.3 million by pregnant
women.
At the global level, travel restrictions have an impact on traffic and
trade. Therefore, recommending delay or cancellation of travel must
reflect sensitivity and specificity, particularly when addressing a travel
volume that is a large proportion of a total country’s international
travel, as we presented here. This aligns with the International Health
Regulations (2005) (IHR), a global treaty ratified by the World Health
Assembly. The IHR’s stated goal is “to prevent, protect against,
control and provide a public health response to the international
spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted
to public health risks, and avoid unnecessary interference with
international traffic and trade”
. Our efforts to estimate the proportion
of travelers at higher risk, particularly women of childbearing age
(51.7 million) and pregnant women (2.3 million), have provided an

example of narrowing the focus to decrease potential traffic and trade
burden. Those estimates represent 14.4% and 0.6%, respectively, of
the total annual travel volume (358.8 million passenger journeys) into
the U.S. from all international destinations.
At the state and local level, public health interventions directed
towards travelers can mitigate the spread of emerging infectious
diseases
. Travel volume analyses can help identify geographic and
population targets for effective health interventions. For example,
prevention messaging and health education can be implemented at
high volume ports of entry such as those located in Florida and Texas.
Similarly, efforts to estimate high risk travelers such as women of
childbearing age and those who may be pregnant, can more
effectively target resources and build capacity in focused areas.
Lastly, travel volume provides an input value for estimating the
likelihood and distribution of potential Zika virus emergence and
transmission in the United States.
This study is subject to several limitations. First, travel data are based
on passenger journeys and do not indicate individual passengers.
Origin and final destination city and state do not necessarily indicate
the actual residence of travelers. For aviation estimates, Diio Mi FMg
data as well as Department of Transportation origin and destination
data, do not include passenger demographics. Estimates, therefore,
were based on aggregate CBP statistics by region limiting the
specificity of gender and age groups. This also limits the specificity of
our estimates of pregnant women. We were not able to obtain all
citizenship or residence information on arrivals, limiting our ability to
estimate how many travelers remain in the United States and seek
medical care. Additionally, because information about the age and
gender of sea travelers were not available, we applied the air
estimates for age and gender to determine the sea estimates of
women, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women knowing
that the populations likely differ. We do not have enough information
to indicate in which direction this would bias our findings.
We foresee a continued increase of travel associated Zika virus cases
in the United States. As such, travel volume analyses, such as this

one, can help identify the populations and locations most likely to be
affected by Zika virus; allowing for an anticipatory domestic response.
