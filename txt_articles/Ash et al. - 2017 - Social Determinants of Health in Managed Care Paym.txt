IMPORTANCE Managed care payment formulas commonly allocate more money for medically
complex populations, but ignore most social determinants of health (SDH).
OBJECTIVE To add SDH variables to a diagnosis-based payment formula that allocates funds
to managed care plans and accountable care organizations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using data from MassHealth, the Massachusetts
Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, we estimated regression models
predicting Medicaid spending using a diagnosis-based and SDH-expanded model, and
compared the accuracy of their cost predictions overall and for vulnerable populations.
MassHealth members enrolled for at least 6 months in 2013 in fee-for-service (FFS) programs
(n = 357 660) or managed care organizations (MCOs) (n = 524 607).
EXPOSURES We built cost prediction models from a fee-for-service program. Predictors in the
diagnosis-based model are age, sex, and diagnoses from claims. The SDH model adds
predictors describing housing instability, behavioral health issues, disability, and
neighborhood-level stressors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall model explanatory power and overpayments and
underpayments for subgroups of interest for all Medicaid-reimbursable expenditures
excepting long-term support services (mean annual cost = $5590 per member).
RESULTS We studied 357 660 people who were FFS participants and 524 607 enrolled in
MCOs with a combined 806 889 person-years of experience. The FFS program experience
included more men (49.6% vs 43.6%), older patients (mean age of 26.1 years vs 21.6 years),
and sicker patients (mean morbidity score of 1.16 vs 0.89) than MCOs. Overall, the SDH model
performed well, but only slightly better than the diagnosis-based model, explaining most of
the spending variation in the managed care population (validated R2 = 62.4) and reducing
underpayments for several vulnerable populations. For example, raw costs for the quintile of
people living in the most stressed neighborhoods were 9.6% ($537 per member per year)
higher than average. Since greater medical morbidity accounts for much of this difference,
the diagnosis-based model underpredicts costs for the most stressed quintile by about 2.1%
($130 per member per year). The expanded model eliminates the neighborhood-based
underpayment, as well as underpayments of 72% for clients of the Department of Mental
Health (observed costs of about $30 000 per year) and of 7% for those with serious mental
illness (observed costs of about $16 000 per year).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since October 2016, MassHealth has used an expanded
model to allocate payments from a prespecified total budget to managed care organizations
according to their enrollees’ social and medical risk. Extra payments for socially vulnerable
individuals could fund activities, such as housing assistance, that could improve health equity.

ather than individuals paying for each medical service
they use, health insurance creates a pooled budget to
pay for a population’
s health care; the money can be
used to pay bills directly (fee-for-service [FFS]) or to contract
with managed care organizations (MCOs), with each MCO re-
ceiving a “global payment” to care for its enrolled popula-
tion. Higher-than-average payments are made for needier pa-
tients through risk adjustment; otherwise, MCOs with costlier
patients would go broke. Most risk models account for medi-
cal problems (diagnoses on claims), age, and sex. However,
since social determinants of health (SDH) such as poverty and
limited education also affect the ability to seek medical care,
adhere to medical recommendations1-3 and achieve good out-
comes, risk formulas should consider SDH.4,5 Accounting for
social risk in value-based purchasing addresses root causes of

MassHealth encompasses Massachusetts’Medicaid and
Children’
s Health Insurance Program. Until 2016, MassHealth
relied solely on a refinement of the Department of Health and
Human Services’ Hierarchical Condition Category (HHS-
HCC)modelusedforthefederalHealthInsuranceMarketplace8
and for risk adjusting Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace
payments. We describe MassHealth’
s first-in-nation payment
model to include SDH variables, implemented in October 2016
for MCOs—and for “accountable care organizations” (ACOs)
now being organized.
Inadequate risk adjustment takes money from vulner-
ablepatientsandtheirclinicians,andgeneratesunearnedprof-
its for plans that shun needier patients. Risk adjustment ad-
justs payments to each MCO or ACO to the risk (that is, expected
needs) of the particular individuals it enrolls. Extra SDH-
based dollars can, for example, address a woman’
s repeated
respiratory hospitalizations by housing her if she is home-
less, or by buying an air conditioner or removing allergens at
her home.
Methods
Overview
Risk adjustment has many applications; herein, we use it to
allocate a Medicaid budget among MCOs. We use person-
level data to predict medical spending (“expected cost”). In ac-
tual contracting with MCOs, payments also account for infla-
tion, regional differences in labor and capital costs, and other
factors. This work was an operations project that relied on de-
identified data; thus, it was not considered to be human sub-
jects research, and the University of Massachusetts Medical
School institutional review board was not involved.
From 2010 to 2016, MassHealth calculated risk from a di-
agnosis-based Hierarchical Condition Category (DxCG-HCC)9
relative risk score (RRS); we call this the RRS model. We sought
an expanded SDH model that might better tailor predictions
to costs for SDH-defined subgroups (eg, race, disability, and
factors associated with housing or neighborhood). We mea-
sured how well a model fits a group using the predictive ratio:
the group’
s average actual (observed) cost divided by its av-
erage model-predicted (expected) cost. A predictive ratio
greater than 1.0 indicates underpayment; less than 1.0, over-
payment. Predictive ratios near 1.0 represent good fit.

Population Studied
The Medicare Advantage program and the ACA Marketplace
build MCO payment models on FFS data10 because claims are
considered more accurate than encounter records (dummy
bills) provided by MCOs. Similarly, we used FFS data in 2013
to build the SDH model, then examined its ability to predict
cost in 2013 FFS and MCO populations.
Modeling Approach
We predict total cost on a per-member per-time-enrolled ba-
sis including all inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs, but
excluding long-term services and supports (LTSS), which are
paidforseparately.LTSSincludesnursinghomecare,adultday-
care, home health and personal care services, transportation,
supported employment, family-caregiver assistance, and care
planning and coordination. Following the federal Market-
placeapproach,7weuseda“concurrentframe,
”predicting2013
cost from 2013 patient diagnoses and SDH characteristics. We
annualized cost (eg, letting a person with $3000 of costs over
6 months contribute one-half of a person-year of experience
at the rate of $6000 annually). In practice, MCO payments are
made monthly, based on number of days enrolled, and reca-
libratedquarterlyusingthemostrecent12monthsofdataavail-
able. We top-coded costs at $125 000 (replacing larger spend-
ing with $125 000) to prevent outliers from distorting the
model. Top-coding was used in developing the RRS and the
Key Points
Question Can social determinants of health (SDH) be included in
Medicaid payment formulas so as to pay more equitably for the
care of socially vulnerable individuals?
Findings Using data from more than 350 000 Massachusetts
2013 Medicaid beneficiaries, we developed a payment model that
adds readily available SDH variables to medical diagnoses, age and
sex, eliminating or significantly reducing underpayments for
several vulnerable subgroups: for example, clients of mental
health services, persons with 3 or more addresses during the year,
and those living in distressed neighborhoods.
Meaning Massachusetts Medicaid implemented this SDH model
in 2016, potentially enabling clinicians to better meet the needs of
socially vulnerable patients.

Predictors
The RRS model predicted cost from medical conditions re-
corded as International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9), diagnoses, age, and sex as summarized in a DxCG-
HCC (version 4.2, Verscend) concurrent Medicaid relative risk
score. This score was developed on the MarketScan Medicaid
Managed Care Research Database with individual-level data
from about 10 Medicaid states in 2008 to 2009; the model uses
a comprehensive 394-condition category classification, but

culating expected costs from age, sex, and diagnoses grouped
intoconditioncategorieswithhierarchies.Forexample,chronic
lung disease dominates cough; when both are present, the lat-
ter is ignored. We used existing Medicaid claims and enroll-
ment files to identify potentially useful variables: race/
ethnicity; disability (disability-based entitlement, and clients
qualifying for specialized services for mental health or devel-
opmentaldisabilities);housingissues(unstablehousing,≥3ad-
dresses within a year), homelessness (by ICD code); sub-
stance use disorders; serious mental illness; and 20 age-sex
category indicators.11,12 The substance use disorder and seri-
ous mental illness indicators were based on diagnosis codes
for conditions such as “drug dependence” and “major depres-
sion” (see eAppendix and eReferences in the Supplement).
A key innovation was using enrollee addresses to calcu-
late a “neighborhood stress score” (NSS). We assigned
addresses to US Census block groups with American Com-
munity Survey neighborhood-level variables.13 We then
used principal components analysis to identify 7 indicators
of economic stress (percentage of families with incomes
<100% of the federal poverty level [FPL], percentage
with <200% of FPL, percentage of unemployed adults, per-
centage of households receiving public assistance, percent-
age of households with no car, percentage of single parents
among households with children, and percentage of people
≥25 years with no high school degree). We created the NSS
by standardizing each variable (to have a mean [SD] of 0 [1]),
taking their average, and restandardizing this across the
combined FFS and MCO populations (eAppendix in the
Supplement). We set NSS = 0 for those members (6.0% of
FFS and 5.1% of MCO) with nongeocodable addresses. The
NSS ranged from −1.8 to 3.3 and averaged 0.030 among MCO
members and −0.044 in FFS.
We also examined variables such as race/ethnicity, ex-
treme poverty (family income ≤86% of FPL), homelessness as
identified in administrative records, and problems with the
English language. Reasons for rejecting variables included
many missing values (eg, nearly 40% of values for race were
missing), redundancy with other information (having a coef-
ficient near zero), and potentially subtracting money from pa-
tient populations whose use of additional resources (eg, trans-
lation services for people with limited English) is not captured
in claims or encounter records.
Similar to modeling for the federal ACA Marketplace,8 we
wanted predictors to statistically significantly predict cost; be
reliably measured for nearly all members; and satisfy feasibil-
ity, fairness, and transparency considerations. Hence, for fair-
ness, we set NSS to its average value of 0 rather than use “ad-
dress could not be geocoded” as a predictor (which would have
subtracted about $90 from the annual payment for each such
person).Anotherconsiderationwashowthemodelwouldwork
inadynamicmarketplacewherestakeholderscan“game”vari-
ables to trigger a larger payment than justified. For example,
we considered 3 potentially relevant “flags” for housing-
related risks: a homeless designation in state administrative
records; a “homelessness” ICD diagnosis code during some
medical encounter; and having 3 or more residential ad-
dresses in a year (ie, ≥2 moves). These identified 2.3%, 0.7%,
and 11.5% of FFS members, respectively, and were associated
with radically different incremental costs: about $0, $7000,
and $600, respectively. We discarded the noninformative ad-
ministrative flag. Also, we were reluctant to put $7000 on a
diagnosis code that is currently rarely and inconsistently used.
Reasoning that homelessness conferred at least as much risk
as repeated moves, we used the increment of about $600 for
any member with either 3 or more addresses or an ICD code
for homelessness.
We excluded “persistent use of LTSS” (commonly, nurs-
inghomecare,anddefinedhereasatleast$500ofLTSSineach
of 3 consecutive months), although average costs for such
people were $7000 more than we could otherwise predict.

Estimation
FollowingMedicareAdvantage,PartD,andtheACAMarketplace,
we used simple, weighted, least-squares regression8 to predict
2013 cost from 2013 patient characteristics for MassHealth FFS
members. We then tweaked the regression outputs to conform
topolicyconsiderations,suchassettingaminimumpositivepre-
diction for everyone. Analyses were performed with Stata sta-
tistical software (version 14.1; StataCorp Inc).
Results
In the 2013 modeling population, the FFS program included
more men (49.6% vs 43.6%), older patients (mean age of 26.1
years vs 21.6 years), and sicker patients (mean morbidity score
of 1.16 vs 0.89) than MCO members. See Table 1 and Table 2.
MCO members had higher proportions of children (≤18 years;
54.8% vs 45.5%) and women, but fewer white/non-Hispanic
members (34.5% vs 37.7%). Although both programs had 11.5%
of members with at least 3 addresses during the year, most so-
cial risks were less prevalent among MCO enrollees; fewer had
extremely low family income (69.5% vs 74.5%), were clients
of the Departments of Mental Health (0.4% vs 1.5%) or Devel-
opmental Services (1.1% vs 2.5%), or were flagged for home-
lessness (0.02% vs 0.67%), disability (12.2% vs 21.9%), seri-
ous mental illness (10.2% vs 14.4%), or substance use disorders
(6.2% vs 9.6%). And, among members defined by every single
one of these social risk factors, mean medical risk (RRS) was
lower for those enrolled in MCO programs.

The SDH model’
s explanatory power (R2) for predicting
2013 FFS costs from same-year predictors was 57.2% (vs 53.5%
for the RRS model). When applied to the 2013 MCO data, the
SDH model R2 was 62.4%. However, in practice, the model will
be less accurate when used prospectively—to pay for “next
year.
” We used 2014 data (not shown) to estimate the prospec-
tive R2 as 38%, which is at the high end of best-performing pro-
spective models in US populations.14
Theprincipalgoalofriskmodelsistomakepaymentstrack
large, predictable variations in spending of readily identified
subgroups, such as those seen in Table 4. Thus, examining pre-
dictive ratios (PRs, actual cost/model-predicted cost) for vul-
nerable subgroups is key. Costs in the most expensive groups
exceed 5 times the average, whereas females younger than 18
years cost about half of the average. The RRS model tracks
variationsincostfairlywell(PRsarenear1),especiallyforracial/
ethnic groups. For clients of the Department of Mental Health,
with costs 5 times average, the RRS model has a predictive ra-
tio of 1.72. That is, the RRS model would provide substantial
resources to a plan—on average, $17 567 (= $30 216/1.72)—for
Department of Mental Health clients, but only the SDH model
pays their full ($30 000) cost.
The SDH model’
s payments are close to costs for most sub-
groups shown, but not for people with a homelessness diag-
nosis code, for whom it would pay about $28 000 of their
$35 000 costs ($28 178 = $35 044/1.24). Another seriously un-
derpaid group is persistent users of LTSS, with mean medical
costs of $28 921. Note that the State of Massachusetts addi-
tionally paid about $13 000 per person for LTSS, beyond the
global payment. Thus, the SDH model predictive ratio of
1.36 for persistent users of LTSS means that the global bud-
get includes $21 265 for their medical costs. Thus, it
pays about $34 000 ($21 000 + $13 000) out of about $42 000
(= $29 000 + $13 000) in total costs.
Costs for residents of the most stressed neighborhoods
were more than 23% higher than those in the least stressed
neighborhoods (1.10/0.89 = 1.23). The RRS model mostly cor-
rected this, with costs being just 3% less and 2% more than pre-
dicted for those living in the least and most stressed neigh-
borhoods, respectively. The SDH model eliminated the
remaining difference.
Discussion
We augmented Massachusetts’diagnosis-based Medicaid
payment model with available SDH and other data, modestly
improving overall explanatory power and dramatically

a Analyses are weighted (WGT) (fraction of the year during which the member
was eligible) and include only those enrolled for at least 183 days. Cost was
first top-coded at an annualized rate of $125 000, that is, cost = minimum
(dollars spent/WGT, 125 000); it was then rescaled (from a mean of $5590 to
$6000) for ease of interpretability. Risk is the diagnosis-based Hierarchical
Condition Category (version 4.2, Verscend) concurrent model 312 risk score,
normalized to have mean = 1 in the combined 2013 FFS–managed care
organization population and used to identify medical conditions; NSS is a
standardized measure (mean [SD], 0 [1]) summarizing 7 US Census block–level
(when not available, tract-level) variables. All predictions are bottom- and
top-coded at approximately $15 and $125 000.
bPays $6000, the population mean, for each person.
c Pays $5157 times each person’s RRS.
dThe Social Determinants of Health model assigns “intercept” dollars to 20
age-sex categories; see eTable in the Supplement.
e Unstable housing refers to those with either an International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code for homelessness or at least 3 addresses during
the year. Because ICD coding for homelessness currently flags a small,
nonrepresentative subset of those who are homeless, we used the
model-derived $596 coefficient for those with multiple addresses for the
pooled category.

 improving the match of payments to costs for several catego-
ries of vulnerable members. This model, used by MassHealth
since October 2016, allocates payments within a fixed bud-
get accounting for socioeconomic and psychosocial as well
as medical risk.
Paying about $50 per standard deviation–sized incre-
ment in “neighborhood stress” can give clinicians who serve
1000 or 2000 people in a socioeconomically distressed
neighborhood $100 000 or more per year to support innova-
tions that address social complexity. These might include
finding housing, or making existing houses safer for people
with breathing problems; teaching groups of Caribbean men
to prepare diabetes-friendly dishes that they will enjoy eat-
ing; or creating internet technology infrastructure to link (as
he arrives at the emergency department for the fifth time) a
young man with very little medically wrong with him to a
community health worker to help him address root causes of
his recurrent health emergencies. Such programs could draw
more people with complex problems—those who have the
most to gain from coordinated care—into managed care.
Such incentives seem necessary, since in 2013, the sickest
and most vulnerable members remained underrepresented
in managed care programs.
Asanotherexample,whilepaying$600annuallyforcoded
homelessness is far less than needed for members who re-
ceived this code in 2013, it will both support useful services
now and encourage the more comprehensive coding needed
to accurately price homelessness in the future.
Even when a risk model does not fully match payments
to costs for some subgroups, the model diagnostics illus-
trated here, which compare costs with model-based predic-
tions through predictive ratios, can identify issues that need
addressing. For example, MassHealth will separately reim-
burse MCOs or ACOs for each birth, and subsidize some high

 costs associated with valuable emergent expenses, such as for
curative hepatitis C therapy. We are working on “SDH 2.0.”
Limitations
We modeled only enrollees of at least 6 months. However, in
Massachusetts, such members contribute most person-
years’experience. While global payments should enable sys-
tems of care to allocate money wisely between strictly medi-
cal and other services, we could not reliably measure the need
for those LTSS, and modeled only non-LTSS costs. An SDH
model should probably account for additional important so-
cial risks, such as “social isolation” and “limited English pro-
ficiency.” However, we could use only readily available pre-
dictors. Other states may not be able to identify the exact same
variables—for example, “client of the Department of Mental
Health”(adesignationthatrequiresrigorousvetting),andtheir
risk models will need to reflect the relations between patient
characteristicsandcostintheirowndata.Ourworktakesafirst
step, demonstrating that SDH modeling is feasible and pro-
viding guidance for how to do it.
Conclusions
A payment formula that accounts for medical problems but ig-
nores social risk can underpay for vulnerable populations, po-
tentially exacerbating inequality. MassHealth’
s social deter-
minants of health payment model uses existing Medicaid data
