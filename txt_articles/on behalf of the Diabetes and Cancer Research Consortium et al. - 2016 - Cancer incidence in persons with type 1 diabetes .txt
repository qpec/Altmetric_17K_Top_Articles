Abstract
Aims/hypothesis An excess cancer incidence of 20–25% has
been identified among persons with diabetes, most of whom
have type 2 diabetes. We aimed to describe the association
between type 1 diabetes and cancer incidence.
Methods Persons with type 1 diabetes were identified from
five nationwide diabetes registers: Australia (2000–2008),
Denmark (1995–2014), Finland (1972–2012), Scotland
(1995–2012) and Sweden (1987–2012). Linkage to national
cancer registries provided the numbers of incident cancers in
people with type 1 diabetes and in the general population. We
used Poisson models with adjustment for age and date of
follow up to estimate hazard ratios for total and site-specific
cancers.
Results A total of 9,149 cancers occurred among persons with
type 1 diabetes in 3.9 million person-years. The median age at
cancer diagnosis was 51.1 years (interquartile range 43.5–
59.5). The hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) associated with type
1 diabetes for all cancers combined were 1.01 (0.98, 1.04)
among men and 1.07 (1.04, 1.10) among women. HRs were
increased for cancer of the stomach (men, HR 1.23 [1.04,
1.46]; women, HR 1.78 [1.49, 2.13]), liver (men, HR 2.00
[1.67, 2.40]; women, HR 1.55 [1.14, 2.10]), pancreas (men,
HR 1.53 [1.30, 1.79]; women, HR 1.25 [1.02,1.53]), endome-
trium (HR 1.42 [1.27, 1.58]) and kidney (men, HR 1.30 [1.12,
1.49]; women, HR 1.47 [1.23, 1.77]). Reduced HRs were
found for cancer of the prostate (HR 0.56 [0.51, 0.61]) and
breast (HR 0.90 [0.85, 0.94]). HRs declined with increasing
diabetes duration.
Conclusion Type 1 diabetes was associated with differences
in the risk of several common cancers; the strength of these
associations varied with the duration of diabetes.

 Introduction
Persons with diabetes have an approximately 20–25% higher
cancer incidence compared with persons without diabetes,
though this varies by cancer site [1]. In particular, persons with
diabetes have been shown to have an elevated incidence of
liver, pancreatic, colorectal, endometrial and kidney cancer
[1]. Conversely, a decreased risk of prostate cancer has been
reported in men with diabetes [2–5].
The association between type 1 diabetes and cancer is
not well described. The majority of previous studies
assessing the link between diabetes and cancer have not
made a distinction between the two major types of dia-
betes. As type 2 diabetes is far more prevalent than type
1 diabetes, study populations have been primarily com-
posed of persons with type 2 diabetes, thus hindering the
generalisation of findings to persons with type 1 diabe-
tes. It is possible that the relationship between type 1
diabetes and cancer is different from that observed be-
tween type 2 diabetes and cancer as a result of differ-
ences in the underlying disease characteristics, drug ther-
apies and patterns of risk factors, such as obesity.
The observed excess risk of cancer in persons with
diabetes may, to some extent, be a consequence of anti-
diabetic drug therapies, such as exogenous insulin [6].
There is some evidence that insulin-treated patients have
a higher cancer incidence compared with non-insulin-
treated patients [7]. If exogenous insulin use is associ-
ated with increased cancer risk, then an excess risk of
cancer should be apparent in persons with type 1 dia-
betes, and this excess risk could potentially be larger
than that observed in persons with type 2 diabetes.
Alternatively, hyperglycaemia has also been suggested
as a possible mechanism through which diabetes is as-
sociated with cancer [8, 9]. If hyperglycaemia does con-
tribute to the observed elevated risks of cancer among
persons with type 2 diabetes then similar associations
would be expected for both type 1 diabetes and type
2 diabetes patients.
The small number of existing studies investigating
cancer occurrence among persons with type 1 diabetes
[10–13] have been underpowered to provide accurate
risk estimates for site-specific cancers and have subse-
quently reported heterogeneous findings [14]. Further
limitations of previous studies include unrepresentative
samples, difficulties in defining type 1 diabetes, short
follow up and inadequate evaluation of the potential
influence of ascertainment bias on diabetes duration.
In this large multinational study, we compared cancer inci-
dence among persons with type 1 diabetes and the general
population using population-based registries in five countries.
The effect of diabetes duration on the association with cancer
was also explored.
Methods
Data sources
The data sources for this project were compiled from the fol-
lowing five countries: Australia, Denmark, Finland, Scotland
and Sweden. Details of each country’s source of diabetes,
cancer and mortality data, as well as details of ethical approv-
al, are provided in the electronic supplementary material
(ESM). The study periods for each country were: Australia,
2000–2008; Denmark, 1995–2012; Finland, 1972–2010;
Scotland, 1995–2011; and Sweden, 1987–2012. ICD-10
(www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/) and ICD-7 codes were
used to classify individual cancer diagnoses.
In each country, persons with type 1 diabetes were defined
as persons who were recorded with a diagnosis of diabetes
below the age of 40 years. Follow up time and the number of
cancers in persons with type 1 diabetes were classified by coun-
try, sex, age and calendar time (in 1 year categories) and by
Population size by sex, age and calendar time were obtain-
ed from the respective national statistics and used to estimate
person-years at risk for each country.
Statistical methods
Definition of outcome We followed persons with type 1 dia-
betes from the study start date or the date of diabetes diagno-
sis, whichever was latest, and excluded patients with a pre-
existing cancer diagnosis. All individuals were followed until
the first cancer occurrence, death or study end date, whichever
came first.
The incidence of cancer was defined by the first primary
cancer only and the date of cancer diagnosis was retrieved
from the respective cancer registries.
As the prevalence of type 1 diabetes is low (<1%), we
chose to compare cancer incidence in persons with type 1
diabetes with that in the total background population rather
than in a non-diabetic population. For convenience, we also
chose to measure follow up among persons with type 1 dia-
betes up to the date of death or the end of study, and ignored
the date of cancer diagnosis to avoid the recalculation of
person-years at risk for each cancer type. This approach
overestimated the follow up time for persons with type 1 dia-
betes by <5% for all cancers combined and by much less than
5% for cancer at specific sites (see http://bendixcarstensen.
com/DMCa/T1D/T1D-Ca.pdf (accessed 8 January 2016),
section 8.4.2, for sensitivity analyses). We censored follow
up at cancer diagnosis in the analysis of all cancers and in
the grouping of non-sex-specific cancers.
Statistical models For each cancer site and sex, data were
classified by country, age and period of follow up, date of

 birth (i.e. cohort), and general population vs diabetes patients
(for disease duration). We fitted an age–period–cohort model
to the cancer incidence data separately for each sex and for
each studied cancer site. The models were fitted using cubic
spline terms for age, period (date of follow up) and cohort
(date of birth), and using the events as outcome and the natural
log of person-years as the offset in a Poisson regression model
[15, 16]. Spline knots were chosen so the number of cases
between consecutive knots was the same across each of the
following variables: age, period and cohort.
We assumed a common effect of type 1 diabetes in the first
model and a set of common duration terms in the second
model. Thus, the model for the cancer incidence rate (λnapcd)
was:
log λnapcd
�
�
¼ f n a
ð Þ þ gn p
ð Þ þ hn c
ð Þ þ δd;
where n denotes country, a denotes age, p denotes period
(calendar time), c denotes cohort (date of birth) and d denotes
diabetes duration as evaluated at the start of each small interval.
In the simple model, d only took the values ‘general popula-
tion’ or ‘type 1 diabetic patients’. In the extended analysis, it
took the values ‘general population’ or 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 or
30 years, although the latter values were present in a slightly
smaller dataset because the duration of type 1 diabetes was not
available for prevalent cases at the study start times for
Denmark and Australia. The variable ‘duration of type 1 dia-
betes’ was only incorporated into site-specific models in which
there were at least 200 cancer cases among persons with type 1
diabetes for each sex, with the addition of kidney cancer cases
because of its established association with type 2 diabetes.
The model was thus a proportional hazards model which
assumed that the HR of cancer among persons with type 1
diabetes relative to the general population was constant across
age and calendar time categories. This is the same assumption
that underlies a traditional standardised mortality ratio analy-
sis, but we modelled the population cancer incidence rates
using smooth terms instead of using empirical rates in small
intervals. This was done because a fairly large fraction of the
follow up occurred in age groups in which population rates
were unstable, particularly for rare cancer types. Our approach
stabilised population rates by imposing the reasonable as-
sumption that rates of cancer varied smoothly over time in
both the total population and persons with type 1 diabetes.
We tested whether the specific age cut-off of 40 years was
appropriate by including an interaction between age at diag-
nosis (<30, 30–35, 35–40) and the HR of cancer between
those with type 1 diabetes and the general population. We also
fitted an extended model with separate type 1 diabetes HR for
each country and tested this against the model with a common
HR across countries to assess heterogeneity.
All calculations and plots were carried out in R, version
3.1.2 [17], and using the R Epi package [18]. A complete
account of all data manipulations and analyses is available at
http://bendixcarstensen.com/DMCa/T1D/T1D-Ca.pdf
(accessed 8 January 2016).
Results
Among persons with type 1 diabetes, there were a total of
9,149 first incident cancers in 3.9 million person-years of fol-
low up. The distribution of cancer by country, sex and site are
presented in Table 1 (also included as ESM Table 1 for com-
pleteness). Histograms of events and person-years by age,
calendar time and duration for each country (and the total)
are presented in ESM Fig. 1.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of cancer cases among per-
sons with type 1 diabetes in the five contributing countries. In
this study population, the majority of cancer cases occurred
between the ages of 40 and 60 years. The median age at cancer
diagnosis in this relatively young cohort was 51.1 years
(interquartile range 43.5–59.5).
Basic analyses
We found HRs (95% CIs) for overall cancer of 1.01 (0.98,
1.04) among men and 1.07 (1.04, 1.10) among women
(Fig. 2 and ESM Table 2) in comparison with the general
population. When analyses were restricted to non-sex-
specific cancers (i.e. excluding prostate, testis, breast, cervix,
endometrium and ovary cancer), HRs (95% CIs) of 1.15 (1.11,
1.19) among men and 1.17 (1.13, 1.22) among women were
observed.
The HRs associated with type 1 diabetes for 23 cancer
subsites are shown in Fig. 2. Significantly elevated HRs for
both sexes were observed for cancers of the liver, pancreas,
kidney and stomach. Women with type 1 diabetes had elevat-
ed HRs for cancer of the oesophagus, endometrium, ovary and
thyroid. Among men with type 1 diabetes, elevated HRs were
observed for colon cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Women with type 1 diabetes exhibited significantly reduced
HRs for melanoma, breast cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Men with type 1 diabetes had a 44% lower incidence of pros-
tate cancer than that observed in the general population. In
addition, we found a borderline significant 12% lower risk
of testis cancer in men with type 1 diabetes.
There was no significant interaction between age at diag-
nosis and the HR between type 1 diabetic patients and the
general population for any of the five countries.
Significant heterogeneity was observed between HR esti-
mates from the five countries (p≤0.0001; see ESM Table 2
and ESM Figs 2–4). In particular, there were large differences
by country in the HRs for cancer at all sites in men, e.g. type 1
diabetes was associated with an 18% increased cancer inci-
dence in Finland compared with a 10% reduction in Sweden.

 However, when analyses were performed for cancer subsites
by country, there were no consistent differences. Statistically
significant heterogeneity in the estimated HRs for cancer by
country was found for individual cancer sites, including
cancer of the pancreas, kidney, prostate, brain/central nervous
system and leukaemia in men and colorectal and cervical can-
cer in women.
Analysis by diabetes duration
A total of 7,792 (85.2% of 9,149) patients with type 1 diabetes
who had a verifiable date of diabetes diagnosis were subse-
quently diagnosed with cancer.
High HRs (95% CIs) for overall cancer occurrence were
observed during the first year following the diagnosis of dia-
betes (men, HR 2.28 [1.87, 2.78]; women, HR 2.34 [2.00,
2.74]; Fig. 3 and ESM Table 3). Following the first year after
diabetes diagnosis, the HRs declined to unity (1.03 [0.83,
1.29]) for women and decreased to 1.23 [0.95, 1.60] for
men. After around 5 years, the HR of cancer occurrence in
men with type 1 diabetes increased to 1.34 [1.20, 1.49]. After
15 years, the cancer incidence among men with type 1 diabe-
tes was similar to that of the general population. The 95% CIs
were similar regardless of disease duration because higher
incidence rates in people with a longer duration of diabetes
resulted in total numbers of events similar to those observed in
the larger population with a shorter duration of diabetes.
For most site-specific cancers, the HRs decreased with in-
creasing diabetes duration (ESM Table 4 and ESM Figs 5–8).
However, there was very little variation by duration of diabe-
tes for breast cancer incidence, while the HR for endometrial
cancer remained elevated for approximately 18 years. The

 lower incidence of prostate cancer among men with type 1
diabetes became more apparent with increasing duration of
diabetes.
Discussion
In this large multi-country study, we compared the cancer
incidence in persons with type 1 diabetes with that observed
in the general population, and investigated the influence of
diabetes duration on the risk estimates.
We found that women with type 1 diabetes had a marginally
elevated incidence of overall cancer compared with the general
population. Men with type 1 diabetes did not have an elevated
incidence of overall cancer, although the substantial inverse
association between type 1 diabetes and prostate cancer inci-
dence in men contributed to the overall result and to these sex
differences. When analyses were restricted to non-sex-specific
cancers, the excess cancer incidence was similar in both men
and women with type 1 diabetes: there were elevated HR esti-
mates of about 15% in the first 20 years after diagnosis. We
found that the cancer incidence was substantially higher in
both men and women with type 1 diabetes during the first year
of follow up compared with a longer duration of diabetes. The
cancer incidence subsequently decreased to that of the general
population after approximately 20 years of follow up for men
and after 5 years of follow up for women.
We found that type 1 diabetes conferred an excess risk of
cancer of the stomach, liver, pancreas, endometrium and kid-
ney and a reduced risk of prostate cancer. We also report a
lower incidence of breast cancer in women with type 1 diabe-
tes compared with the general population.
There was evidence of heterogeneity in HRs of some can-
cers by country, though a lack of plausible biological mecha-
nisms leads us to believe these differences are likely to be an
artefact.
Previous studies investigating the association between type
1 diabetes status and cancer incidence have reported mixed
findings [14], with estimates for the overall cancer risk among
persons with type 1 diabetes ranging between 5% lower to
25% higher compared with the general population, although
reported 95% CIs include the estimates reported here [10–13,
19]. The discrepancies in these findings may, in part, be due to
substantial differences in the criteria used to define type 1
diabetes diagnoses. For example, a UK-based cohort study
which identified 214 incident cancers among 23,834 persons
with diabetes diagnosed between 1972 and 1986 and reported
a standardised incidence ratio of 0.95 (95% CI 0.84, 1.08),
used insulin treatment as a proxy for type 1 diabetes [12]. In
contrast, in the Swedish cohort study that identified 258 can-
cer diagnoses among 24,052 persons between 1964 and 2006
and reported an HR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.04, 1.33), ICD codes
from hospital admissions plus age were used to ascertain type
1 diabetes status [11]. The authors acknowledged the lack of
specific type 1 diabetes diagnostic codes in earlier ICD ver-
sions as a possible source of misclassification bias because
persons with type 2 diabetes might have been included in
the type 1 diabetes study population.
Our finding of a significantly elevated cancer incidence
among people with type 1 diabetes in the first year after diag-
nosis of diabetes may be attributable to ascertainment bias (i.e.
earlier detection of pre-existing cancers) and to a lesser extent
to reverse causation (i.e. the cancer itself causing diabetes).
Previous studies investigating the relationship between type 1
diabetes and cancer have provided only sparse information on
the influence of diabetes duration on this association. These
studies typically applied wide intervals of diabetes duration in
the analyses because of their limited sample sizes. As a con-
sequence, they were unable to perform a detailed analysis of
the differences in cancer occurrence according to time since
diabetes diagnosis. In one Swedish cohort study including
data from 29,187 persons who were hospitalised with type 1
diabetes between 1965 and 1999, HR estimates were stratified
within two post-diagnostic periods of 1–14 or ≥15 years fol-
lowing diabetes diagnosis [13]. These analyses yielded
standardised incidence ratios of 1.1 (95% CI 1.0, 1.3) and

which are largely consistent with our results but do not include
rates in the first year after diabetes diagnosis.
HRs for site-specific cancers in persons with type 1 diabe-
tes were similar to those observed among persons with all
types of diabetes and with type 2 diabetes [1, 20]. This finding
suggests a potential common mechanism among persons with
type 1 and type 2 diabetes, for example obesity, insulin treat-
ment or hyperglycaemia.
HR estimates for site-specific cancers were highest for can-
cer types in which obesity is an established risk factor, namely
stomach, colorectal, kidney, endometrial and pancreatic can-
cers [21]. While obesity is less prevalent in persons with type
1 diabetes than in persons with type 2 diabetes, obesity is
increasing among persons with type 1 diabetes and may con-
tribute to an increased risk of certain cancers [22, 23]. Further
research is therefore required to compare obesity prevalence in
people with and without type 1 diabetes.
The influence of glucose-lowering medications on the ob-
served association between diabetes and cancer has been ex-
tensively investigated [24, 25]. Our finding of a smaller excess
incidence of cancer among persons with type 1 diabetes than
was previously observed in persons with type 2 diabetes does
not support the notion that insulin therapies contribute to the
observed elevated incidence. If exogenous insulin did contrib-
ute to the observed association, the strength of the relationship
between type 1 diabetes and cancer incidence would be ex-
pected to be stronger than that observed among persons with

 type 2 diabetes because all people with type 1 diabetes are
treated with insulin and a minority of people with type 2 dia-
betes receive insulin treatment. Furthermore, the absence of an
association between overall or site-specific cancer risk and
increasing duration of diabetes in our study does not support
a dose–response relationship between exogenous insulin use
and cancer incidence. We did not have sufficiently detailed
data to evaluate associations between type 1 diabetes and can-
cer incidence according to specific types of insulin.
Diabetes-specific metabolic deficiencies such as hyper-
glycaemia may provide an alternative explanation for the
observed excess risk of some cancers among persons with
diabetes, given that these deficiencies are common in both
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycaemia may be a plausi-
ble explanation given the identification of a dose–response
relationship between glycated haemoglobin levels and the risk
of certain cancers [8, 26, 27]. However, further work is
required to elucidate whether obesity or hyperglycaemia in
persons with type 1 diabetes is responsible for the observed
association with some cancer types.
We report a 10% lower incidence of breast cancer in
women with type 1 diabetes compared with the general pop-
ulation. Previous studies assessing the influence of type 2 or
unspecified diabetes on breast cancer have displayed a similar
or elevated risk compared with the general population, al-
though these findings are largely limited to post-menopausal
women [28]. Our contradictory finding may therefore reflect
our younger cohort (containing fewer post-menopausal wom-
en) or may be confounded by other breast cancer risk factors
such as parity.
Our finding of an increased incidence of pancreatic and
liver cancer among persons with type 1 diabetes is consistent
with some earlier studies. Results from a meta-analysis based
on nine studies (but with only a total of 39 cases of pancreatic
cancer) indicated that persons with type 1 diabetes were at a
twofold increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared with
persons without diabetes [29]. A Danish study (distinct from
the Danish data in this study) observed an HR of 4.8 (95% CI
2.8, 7.7) of liver cancer among diabetes patients younger than
50 years at diagnosis. Although this definition of type 1 dia-
betes is not strictly comparable with ours, the result is consis-
tent with our findings [19]. However, the associations seen for
pancreatic and liver cancer may be a consequence of reverse
causation.
We found an increased risk of thyroid cancer in persons
with type 1 diabetes compared with the general population,
particularly among women. The worldwide incidence rates of
thyroid cancer have increased steeply in recent decades [30,
31], partly due to enhanced detection through the use of more
sensitive diagnostic equipment. Consequently, our observa-
tion of an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among per-
sons with type 1 diabetes may be a diagnostic artefact because
persons with type 1 diabetes receive considerably higher
levels of medical attention than those without diabetes.
Although a reduced risk of prostate cancer in persons with
type 2 diabetes has been reported in numerous studies [2–5],
only one previous study has identified such an association
among persons with type 1 diabetes (although some of the
latter study data were included in the present study) [10].
The similarity in prostate cancer incidence between type 1
and type 2 diabetic patients suggests a similar underlying
mechanism in both types of diabetes. One proposed mecha-
nism involves the lower testosterone levels present in men
with diabetes, obesity or both [32]. Higher testosterone levels

 were previously shown to lead to an increased risk of prostate
cancer [33], while hyperglycaemia has also been shown to
inhibit testosterone production [34].
Strengths and limitations
This study used five national cohorts of persons with type 1
diabetes, and is therefore the largest study to date to investi-
gate the relationship between type 1 diabetes and cancer inci-
dence. By combining cases across countries we assembled a
sufficiently large sample size to investigate associations with
site-specific cancers. The largest previous study included less
than one-third of the number of cancers in people with type 1
diabetes compared with our study [14]. The population-based
registry approach also minimised selection bias.
A further strength of our study was the inclusion of infor-
mation on duration of diabetes, which enabled us to assess the
influence of ascertainment bias and the potential impact of
reverse causation. For example, it is well established that pan-
creatic cancer can induce diabetes [35].
Possible misclassification of type 2 as type 1 diabetes may
have led to an overestimation of the relationship between type
1 diabetes and cancer because of the higher levels of well-
established risk factors for cancer (including obesity and
smoking) among persons with type 2 diabetes. However, the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes below 40 years of age is low and
we therefore believe that the influence of misclassification
bias is negligible, as shown by our interaction analysis (see
http://bendixcarstensen.com/DMCa/T1D/T1D-Ca.pdf
(accessed 8 January 2016), section 8.5).
Moreover, we compared cancer incidence rates among per-
sons with type 1 diabetes with those of the general population,
instead of only with those of persons with diabetes. This may
have diluted the impact of type 1 diabetes on HR estimates,
although this effect will be small because of the low preva-
lence of type 1 diabetes (1.5–4.8 per 1,000 people) in the study
populations [36].
In addition, the large number of comparisons performed
introduced the potential for chance findings.
Finally, the study population was relatively young. Thus,
we were not able to meaningfully evaluate potential changes
in cancer incidence among older persons with type 1 diabetes.
Implications
Our findings do not support changing the policy for cancer
screening in persons with type 1 diabetes. Similar recommen-
dations for lifestyle approaches to reduce cancer risk such as
weight management, increasing physical activity and avoiding
smoking apply to persons with type 1 diabetes as for the gen-
eral population.
Future work should be directed at ascertaining whether the
increased incidence of some cancers among persons with type
1 diabetes leads to a raised risk of cancer mortality among
persons with type 1 diabetes.
Conclusions
We found that, on average, type 1 diabetes confers an excess
incidence of several cancers. In particular, persons with type 1
diabetes had a higher incidence of cancer of the liver, pan-
creas, kidney, endometrium and ovary and a lower incidence
of prostate cancer than those in the general population.
However, similar to the findings for type 2 diabetes, the HRs
of cancer were highest at time of diabetes diagnosis and de-
clined over time.
