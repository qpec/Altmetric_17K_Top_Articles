Abstract
Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of 
immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis1,2. Transcriptional programming of regulatory 
mechanisms facilitates Treg cell functional activation in the prevention of diverse types of 
inflammatory responses3,4. How Treg cells orchestrate their homeostasis and interplay with 
environmental signals remains poorly understood. Here we show that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) 
programs proper metabolic and functional fitness of Treg cells in the control of immune tolerance 
and homeostasis. Mice with Treg-specific deletion of LKB1 developed a fatal inflammatory 
disease characterized by excessive TH2-dominant responses. LKB1 deficiency disrupted Treg cell 
survival and mitochondrial fitness and metabolism, but also induced aberrant expression of 
immune regulatory molecules including the negative co-receptor PD-1, and TNF receptor (TNRF) 
superfamily proteins GITR and OX40. Unexpectedly, LKB1 function in Treg cells was 
independent of conventional AMPK signaling or the mTORC1-HIF-1α axis, but contributed to the

 activation of β-catenin signaling for the proper control of PD-1 and TNFR proteins. Blockade of 
PD-1 activity reinvigorated the suppressive capability of LKB1-deficient Treg cells in the 
repression of TH2 responses and the interplay with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-primed 
dendritic cells (DCs). Thus, Treg cells employ LKB1 signaling to coordinate their metabolic and 
immunological homeostasis and to prevent apoptotic and functional exhaustion, thereby 
orchestrating the balance between immunity and tolerance.
The tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1, encoded by Stk11) is a bioenergetic sensor 
that controls cell metabolism and growth5. To define the role of LKB1 in Treg cells, we 
crossed mice with loxP-flanked Stk11 alleles (Stk11fl/fl) with Foxp3YFP-Cre (Foxp3Cre) 
mice6 to specifically delete Stk11 in Treg cells (designated Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl) (Extended 
Data Fig. 1a). Compared with Foxp3Cre controls (designated as WT), Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl 
mice had a significantly shorter lifespan (Fig. 1a) and lower body weight (Fig. 1b), and 
manifested a reduced body size, skin ulceration and crusting of ears and eyelids (Fig. 1c). 
Moreover, the mutant mice had splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1d) and 
infiltration of immune cells in multiple organs (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, despite largely normal 
morphology of the colon and cecum in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice (Extended Data Fig. 1b), 
these organs had notable accumulation of interepithelial mucosal mast cells (ieMMCs)7 
(Extended Data Fig. 1c). The development of a fatal inflammatory disease in 
Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice suggests a crucial role of LKB1 in Treg cells.
Among serum cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5 were markedly elevated in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice 
(Fig. 1f). MCP-1, TNF-α and IFN-γ were also increased (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The titers 
of serum IgE and IgG1 (Fig. 1g) were much higher in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice than controls, 
while IgG2a/c, IgG2b, IgA and IgM levels were modestly upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 
1e). Moreover, Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice had an increased frequency of eosinophils in the 
spleen and lung (Extended Data Fig. 1f, g), but normal populations of splenic neutrophils 
and macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 1h, i). Histological analysis revealed markedly 
increased eosinophils and Ym1+ M2 macrophages in the skin of Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 1j, k). Compared to WT controls, T cells in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice 
showed the memory/effector phenotype (CD44hiCD62Llo) (Extended Data Fig. 2a), with a 
large number of CD4+ T cells, including Treg cells, expressing the TH2 cytokines IL-4 and 
IL-5 (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c). IFN-γ and IL-17 expression was also elevated, but to a 
lesser extent (Extended Data Fig. 2d, e). Moreover, CD4+ T cells from the lung and colonic 
lamina propria of Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice upregulated IL-4 (Extended Data Fig. 2f). These 
abnormal type 2 immune responses were observed even in CD4+ T cells from young 
Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2g), while Foxp3CreStk11fl/+ mice 
showed normal immune homeostasis (data not shown). These results reveal an excessive 
TH2-dominant inflammatory disorder in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice.
The Treg cell compartment was reduced in percentage and cellularity in Foxp3Cre-Stk11fl/fl 
mice (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). LKB1-deficient Treg cells showed elevated 5-
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (Extended Data Fig. 3b), but also higher levels of 
caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2b) and expression of Bim (Fig. 2c). The survival defects were 
observed in LKB1-deficient Treg cells from the mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras (Fig. 2d

 and Extended Data Fig. 3c, d), indicating cell-intrinsic effects. Interestingly, 
Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice at 2 weeks old had a largely normal proportion of Treg cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 3e) with normal expression of Bim (Extended Data Fig. 3f). 
Nonetheless, activation of T cells, infiltrations of immune cells into the lung, and elevation 
of serum IgE were appreciable in these mice (Extended Data Fig. 3g–i). Depletion of Bim 
(encoded by Bcl2l11) in LKB1-deficient Treg cells substantially restored Treg cell cellularity 
(Extended Data Fig. 3j), but Foxp3CreStk11fl/flBcl2l11fl/fl mice still had elevated frequencies 
of CD44hiCD62Llo (Extended Data Fig. 3k) and IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2e), 
compared with WT or Foxp3CreBcl2l11fl/fl mice (Extended Data Fig. 3l, m). These results 
identify important roles of LKB1 in mediating both Treg cell survival and function.
The regulatory function is closely associated with signature molecules expressed by Treg 
cells1,2. The negative co-receptor PD-1 and TNFR superfamily proteins GITR and OX40 
were markedly elevated on LKB1-deficient Treg cells from Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a) and mixed BM chimeras (Fig. 2f), indicating cell-autonomous 
effects. In contrast, WT and LKB1-deficient Treg cells had largely comparable or slightly 
altered expression of CD62L, CD44 (Extended Data Fig. 4b), GATA3, IRF4, T-bet, RORγt 
(Extended Data Fig. 4c), Foxp3, ICOS, CTLA-4, and CD25 (Extended Data Fig. 4d, e). The 
co-receptors PD-1, GITR and OX40 have been implicated in the control of Treg cell function 
and generation8–13. To examine whether LKB1 directly regulates these Treg signatures in 
mature Treg cells, we generated Foxp3GFP-Cre-ERT2Stk11fl/flRosa26YFP mice (designated 
Foxp3Cre-ERT2Stk11fl/fl mice) to delete Stk11 in Treg cells upon tamoxifen treatment14 
(Extended Data Fig. 4f). Longer duration of LKB1 loss dimished Treg cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 4g), associated with increased cell death (Extended Data Fig. 4h), while Treg cells with 
acute deletion of LKB1 maintained intact homeostasis (Extended Data Fig. 4i) and Bim 
expression (Fig. 2g). In this setting of inflammation-free environment (Extended Data Fig. 
4j, k), loss of LKB1 upregulated PD-1, GITR and OX40 (Fig. 2g), without affecting Foxp3, 
ICOS and CD25 (Extended Data Fig. 4l) or the distribution of resting and activated Treg 
subsets (Extended Data Fig. 4m). Collectively, LKB1 acts in a cell-autonomous and direct 
manner to suppress a select group of Treg signature molecules.
Continuous T cell receptor (TCR) signaling fuels Treg cell function in maintaining immune 
tolerance15,16. Stimulation of Treg cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (α-CD3-CD28) 
resulted in LKB1 phosphorylation and modestly increased LKB1 expression (Fig. 3a). 
mTORC1 and HIF-1α are important effector pathways aberrantly upregulated in LKB1-
deficient cancer cells and conventional T cells17,18. Unexpectedly, Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl Treg 
cells had slightly reduced mTORC1 activity under steady state (Fig. 3b) and largely normal 
phosphorylation of S6, AKT (S473) and FOXO1 upon α-CD3-CD28 stimulation (Extended 
Data Fig. 5a, b). Additionally, depletion of HIF-1α in LKB1-deficient Treg cells failed to 
rescue the defective Treg cell homeostasis or the inflammatory disorder (Extended Data Fig. 
5c–e). 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a well-documented substrate of LKB15, 
the activation of which was lost in LKB1-deficient Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 5f). 
Nonetheless, deletion of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 in Treg cells did not affect Treg cell 
proportion or immmune homeostasis (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5g, h). Altogether, 
LKB1 is activated by TCR signaling in Treg cells but functions independently of mTORC1-
HIF-1α axis and AMPK signaling.

 In the transcriptome of WT and LKB1-deficient Treg cells from the mixed BM chimeras, 
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that LKB1 deficiency impaired gene 
expression implicated in multiple metabolic pathways (Extended Data Fig. 6a), including 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial protein import (Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). 
Unbiased metabolomic profiling in activated Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl Treg cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 6d and Extended Data Table 1) revealed a profound reduction of metabolic 
intermediates associated with mitochondrial function including TCA cycle and fatty acid β-
oxidation (FAO), as well as those in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, while metabolites in 
glycolysis were not uniformly altered (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). Interestingly, 
histamine was increased in LKB-deficient Treg cells (Fig. 3e). Histidine decarboxylase 
(HDC), an enzyme to convert histidine to histamine, was increased in LKB1-deficient Treg 
cells (Fig. 3f). As histamine has been implicated in suppressing Treg cell function19, an 
increased production of histamine in LKB-deficient Treg cells could contribute to their 
defects in an autocrine manner. Metabolite set enrichment analysis indicated that LKB1 
deficiency in Treg cells downregulated multiple metabolic programs, but upregulated the 
pathway for biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 3g). LKB1-deficient Treg cells had 
defective mitochondrial fitness, indicated by reduced mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial 
membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Extended Data Fig. 6g), associated 
with diminished intracellular ATP (Extended Data Fig. 6h). LKB1 deletion reduced oxygen 
consumption rate (OCR) (Extended Data Fig. 6i) without significantly affecting extracellular 
acidification rate (ECAR) (Extended Data Fig. 6j), further supporting impaired 
mitochondrial function. Furthermore, LKB1-deficient Treg cells showed a notable 
accumulation of lipids (Extended Data Fig. 6k), associated with defective FAO (Extended 
Data Fig. 6l) but normal lipogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 6m). Therefore, LKB1 orchestrates 
proper metabolic rewiring and mitochondrial function in Treg cells.
We next explored the cellular processes underlying excessive TH2 responses in 
Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice. Deletion of IL-4 partly rescued TH2 responses in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl 
mice, as indicated by partially mitigated proportions of IL-13- and IL-5-producing CD4+ T 
cells, accumulation of eosinophils and PD-L2+ DCs that are associated with TH2 
responses20, and production of serum IgE and IgG1 (Extended Data Fig. 7a–e). However, 
Treg cell compartment remained defective in Foxp3CreStk11fl/flIl4−/− mice, as indicated by a 
reduced Treg proportion (Extended Data Fig. 7f) and aberrant PD-1, GITR and OX40 
expression (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Moreover, these mice had increased proportions of 
CD44hiCD62Llo memory/effector cells and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells and extensive 
inflammation in various organs (Extended Data Fig. 7h–j). Collectively, these results 
indicate that IL-4 contributes to amplifying TH2 responses in Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice, but is 
not responsible for the failures in immune tolerance.
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key cytokine produced by epithelial cells, 
polarizes DCs to drive allergic inflammation21. Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice had elevated 
production of TSLP in the lung (Fig. 4a), but normal expression of IL-25 and IL-33 
(Extended Data Fig. 8a). TSLP upregulated expression of PD-L220 (Fig. 4b), CD80 and 
CD86 on DCs (Extended Data Fig. 8b). DCs from Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice had aberrant 
upregulation of PD-L2 (Fig. 4c), suggesting that LKB1-deficient Treg cells fail to control 
maturation of PD-L2+ DCs. In support of this notion, WT Treg cells inhibited the induction

 of PD-L2, CD80 and CD86 on DCs primed with TSLP (TSLP-DCs), whereas LKB1-
deficient Treg cells did not (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8c). Furthermore, TSLP-DCs 
polarized the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into TH2 cells, which was effectively 
suppressed by WT but not LKB1-deficient Treg cells (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8d). In 
contrast, LKB1-sufficient and -deficient Treg cells were equally capable of suppressing TH1 
cell differentiation driven by LPS-primed DCs (Extended Data Fig. 8e, f). Therefore, Treg 
cells require LKB1 to repress maturation of TSLP-DCs and subsequent induction of TH2 
responses.
To test the physiological relevance of LKB1-mediated regulatory mechanisms in TH2 
responses, we examined the expression of PD-1, GITR and OX40 on Treg cells from mice 
challenged with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation. OVA inhalation 
elicited the expression of these factors on Treg cells in the lung (Extended Data Fig. 9a), but 
not those in the spleen (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Given the unique and potent roles of PD-1 
in T cells for immune modulation and therapy22, we hypothesized that aberrant induction of 
PD-1 on LKB1-deficient Treg cells disrupts their function in suppressing TH2 responses. We 
tested this hypothesis using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. First, ectopic expression 
of PD-1 impaired the capability of Treg cells in suppressing TH2 cell differentiation 
(Extended Data Fig. 9c). Second, PD-1 deficiency promoted Treg-mediated suppression of 
TH2 responses (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Third, to examine the function of PD-1-deficient 
Treg cells in vivo, we generated mixed BM chimeras using BM cells from Treg-deficient 
Scurfy mice, together with those from WT or Pdcd1−/− mice. Scurfy:Pdcd1−/− chimeras had 
reduced proportion of lung and spleen eosinophils (Extended Data Fig. 9e) and 
concentration of serum IgG1 (Extended Data Fig. 9f), but normal concentration of IgG2a/c 
(Extended Data Fig. 9f). Finally, blocking PD-1 and its ligands largely reversed the defect of 
LKB1-deficient Treg cells in suppressing TH2 cell differentiation (Fig. 4f). Therefore, LKB1 
restrains PD-1 expression as an important mechanism to ensure the functional integrity of 
Treg cells in repressing TH2 responses.
How does LKB1 regulate PD-1 and other Treg signature molecules? Wnt signaling, which is 
implicated in TH2-mediated inflammation23 and Treg cell survival and function24,25, was 
significantly underrepresented in gene sets from LKB1-deficient Treg cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 10a). Activated WT Treg cells upregulated the expression of β-catenin, a key mediator 
of Wnt signaling, while the induction was attenuated in LKB1-deficient Treg cells (Fig. 4g). 
Aside from the modestly reduced β-catenin (Ctnnb1) mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 10b), 
LKB1-deficient Treg cells had increased phosphorylation of β-catenin that mediates its 
degradation (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Moreover, β-catenin bound to a T-cell factor 3 
(TCF3) motif in the Pdcd1 locus in WT Treg cells, but this binding was lost in LKB1-
deficient Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Expression of constitutively active β-catenin 
by retrovirus (β-cat-RV) restored the aberrant expression of PD-1 and GITR on LKB1-
deficient Treg cells (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 10e), but did not affect CD25 expression 
(Extended Data Fig. 10e) or survival of Treg cells (data not shown). Similar rescue effects 
were observed in β-catenin-expressing Treg cells after acute deletion of LKB1 (Extended 
Data Fig. 10f). Moreover, β-cat-RV substantially rectified the defects of LKB1-deficient Treg 
cells in suppressing DC expression of PD-L2, CD80 and CD86 (Extended Data Fig. 10g) 
and TH2 cell differentiation polarized by TSLP-DCs (Fig. 4i). Collectively, these results

 indicate an important role of the LKB1-β-catenin axis in the control of TH2 responses 
through modulating PD-1 and Treg cell signature molecules.
Emerging studies highlight the importance of metabolic reprogramming in immune cell 
activation and differentiation26, but how metabolism and immune function are integrated and 
especially homeostatic control mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we identify LKB1 
as a crucial checkpoint to maintain Treg cell survival and function through coordinating 
metabolic and functional fitness of Treg cells (Extended Data Fig. 10h). LKB1 connects 
immunological signals and cellular metabolism especially mitochondrion-related functions. 
Furthermore, LKB1 curtails the aberrant induction of PD-1, GITR and OX40 in a β-catenin 
dependent manner, and blockade of PD-1 signaling reinvigorates the ability of LKB1-
deficient Treg cells in the repression of TH2 responses. PD-1 upregulation and metabolic 
alteration have long been observed in exhausted CD8+ T cells27, and increasing eveidence 
reveals the interplay between immune checkpoints and cell metabolism28–30. Our results 
suggest that Treg cells not only exist at a resting or activated state1, but could also undergo 
functional exhaustion. Given the constitutive expression of the epithelial cytokine TSLP and 
the ensuing stimulation of DCs at the environmental interface, Treg cells require LKB1 to 
actively maintain their metabolic and immunological homoeostasis, the loss of which results 
in the apoptotic and functional exhaustion of Treg cells. Our findings point to a previously 
unrecognized mechanism enforcing homeostatic control of Treg cells, and provide a 
framework to further understand integration of metabolic signaling and lymphocyte fate and 
state.
Methods
Mice
C57BL/6, CD45.1+, Stk11fl/fl, Bcl2l11fl/fl, Hif1afl/fl, Prkaa1fl/fl, Prkaa2fl/fl, Rag1−/−, Il4−/−, 
Pdcd1−/−, and ROSA26YFP reporter (a loxP-site-flanked STOP cassette followed by the 
YFP-encoding sequence inserted into the ROSA26 locus) mice were purchased from the 
Jackson Laboratory. Foxp3YFP-Cre and Foxp3Cre-ERT2 mice were gifts from A. 
Rudensky6,14. Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice were used at 3–5 weeks old unless otherwise noted, 
with the age and gender-matched WT mice containing the Foxp3Cre allele as controls. Other 
mice were used at 8–10 weeks old unless otherwise noted. BM chimeras were generated by 
transferring 1 × 107 T cell-depleted BM cells into sub-lethally irradiated (5.5 Gy) Rag1−/− 
mice, followed by reconstitution for at least 2 months. For tamoxifen administration, mice 
were injected intraperitoneally with tamoxifen (2 mg per mouse) in corn oil every other day 
for 6 times, and then analyzed 6–7 days after the last injection (unless otherwise noted). All 
mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free facility in the Animal Resource Center at St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospital, and animal protocols were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee.

(C34C5; Cell Signaling Technology) were analyzed by flow cytometry according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. For detection of phosphorylated signaling proteins, 
lymphocytes were rested in complete medium for 1 h. They were fixed with Phosflow 
Lyse/Fix buffer, followed by permeabilization with Phosflow Perm buffer III (BD 
Biosciences) and staining with antibodies to S6 phosphorylated at Ser 235 and Ser 236 
(D57.2.2E; Cell Signaling Technology), 4E-BP1 phosphorylated at Thr 37 and Thr 46 
(236B4; Cell Signaling Technology). For intracellular cytokine staining, T cells were 
stimulated for 4 h with PMA plus ionomycin in the presence of monensin before being 
stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience). BrdU and active 
caspase-3 staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction (BD 
Biosciences). For measurement of mitochondrial mass, potential and ROS, Treg cells were 
incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 10 nM MitoTracker Deep Red (Life Technologies), 20 
nM TMRM (tetramethyl rhodamine, methyl ester; ImmunoChemistry Technologies) or 5 
μM MitoSOX Red (Life Technologies), before staining surface markers. Neutral lipid 
droplets in Treg cells were stained with HCS LipidTOX™ Deep Red Neutral Lipid Stain 
according to the manufacturer’s instruction (ThermoFisher Scientific). Flow cytometry data 
were acquired on LSRII or LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Flowjo 
software (Tree Star).
Cell purification and culture
Naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+CD62L+CD44loCD25−) and splenic DCs (Lin−CD11c+MHC-II+) 
from C57BL/6 mice and Treg cells (CD4+YFP+) from WT and Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice were 
sorted on a MoFlow (Beckman-Coulter) or Reflection (i-Cyt). Naïve CD4+ T cells, DCs, and 
Treg cells were cultured in Click’s medium (plus β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 
10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin. For cell activation, Treg cells 
were activated with plate-coated anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml; 2C11; Bio X Cell) and anti-CD28 (5 
μg/ml; 37.51; Bio X Cell) for the indicated time points. For T cell differentiation in vitro, 
splenic DCs from C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with TSLP31 (10 ng/ml) or LPS (50 
ng/ml) for 18 h, and then washed with HBSS containing 2% FBS twice before coculturing 
with naïve CD4+ T cells and Treg cells in the presence of 1 μg/ml CD3 antibody for 
additional 5 days. To block PD-1 signaling, control IgG (30 μg/ml) or mixture of blocking 
antibodies against PD-1 (10 μg/ml; J43; eBioscience), PD-L1 (10 μg/ml; MIH5; 
eBioscience), and PD-L2 (10 μg/ml; TY25; eBioscience) were added. At the end of culture, 
viable cells were purified using Ficoll and stimulated for 4 h with PMA plus ionomycin in 
the presence of monensin before intracellular staining of cytokines. Constitutively active β-
catenin constructs32 were generated by PCR and cloned into the mouse stem cell virus 
retroviral vector. Retroviral packaging and transduction were performed as described 
previously33.

Metabolomics analysis
Treg cells from Foxp3CreStk11fl/+ and Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mice (approximately 16 days old) 
were activated with plate-coated anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) for 48 h, 
followed by extensive wash with PBS. Metabolites were extracted from cell pellets and 
culture medium using 80% methanol containing 0.05 ng/μl inosine-15N4 and 0.05 ng/μl 
thymine-d4 as internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury MA). 
The samples were centrifuged (10 min, 9,000 × g, 4ºC) and the supernatants were collected. 
Three liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profile metabolites. 
Negative ion, targeted profiling of polar metabolites was performed using an ACQUITY 
UPLC (Waters Corp, Milford MA) coupled to a 5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass 
spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham MA). Extracts (10 μl) were injected directly onto a 
150 × 2.0 mm Luna NH2 column (Phenomenex, Torrance CA). The column was eluted at a 
flow rate of 400 μl/min with initial conditions of 10% mobile phase A (20 mM ammonium 
acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in water (VWR)) and 90% 
mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium hydroxide in 75:25 v/v acetonitrile/methanol (VWR)) 
followed by a 10 min linear gradient to 100% mobile phase A. The ion spray voltage was 
-4.5 kV and the source temperature was 500°C. Positive ionization mode profiling of polar 
metabolites was performed using a Nexera X2 U-HPLC (Shimadzu, Marlborough, MA)-Q 
Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) LC-MS system. The 80% 
methanol extracts (100 μl) were dried using a nitrogen evaporator (TurboVap LV; Biotage) 
and then resuspended in 10 μl of water and 90 μl of 74.9:24.9:0.2 vol/vol/vol acetonitrile/
methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-labeled internal standards (valine-d8, Isotec; 
and phenylalanine-d8, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA). The samples were 
centrifuged (10 min, 9,000 × g, 4°C) and the supernatants were injected directly onto a 150 
× 2 mm Atlantis HILIC column (Waters; Milford, MA). The column was eluted isocratically 
at a flow rate of 250 μl/min with 5% mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% 
formic acid in water) for 1 min followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B 
(acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 10 min. The electrospray ionization voltage was 
3.5 kV and data were acquired using full scan analysis over m/z 70–800 at 70,000 
resolution. Reversed-phase C18 chromatography/negative ion mode MS analyses of free 
fatty acids and bile acids were conducted using an LC-MS system comprised of a Shimadzu 
Nexera X2 U-HPLC (Shimadzu Corp.; Marlborough, MA) coupled to a Q Exactive hybrid 
quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Medium 
(30 μl) was extracted using 90 μl of methanol containing PGE2-d4 (Cayman Chemical Co.; 
Ann Arbor, MI) and centrifuged (10 min, 9,000 × g, 4°C) and the cell extracts were analyzed 
directly. The samples were injected onto a 150 × 2.1 mm ACQUITY BEH C18 column

 (Waters; Milford, MA). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 450 μl/min 
with 80% mobile phase A (0.01% formic acid in water) for 3 min followed by a linear 
gradient to 100% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.01% acetic acid) over 12 min. MS 
analyses were carried out in the negative ion mode using electrospray ionization, full scan 
MS acquisition over 70–850 m/z, and a resolution setting of 70,000. Metabolite identities 
were confirmed using authentic reference standards. Other MS settings were: spray voltage 
−3.5 kV, capillary temperature 320°C, and heater temperature 300°C. LC-MS data were 
processed and visually inspected using MultiQuant 2.1 (SCIEX; Framingham, MA) and 
TraceFinder 3.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Metabolite set 
enrichment analysis was performed as described previously35.
Metabolic assays
Treg cells were stimulated with plate-bound α-CD3-CD28 for 48 h. To measure de novo 
lipid synthesis, D-[1-14C] glucose (Perkin Elmer) was added to the cells for the final 8 h of 
culture. Cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, and the lipid fraction was extracted by 
addition of chloroform and methanol (2:1 v/v) with vortexing, followed by addition of water 
with vortexing. After centrifugation, the lipid-containing phase was obtained and 14C 
incorporation was measured with a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. OCR and ECAR 
were measured in XF media (non-buffered DMEM containing 5 mM glucose, 2 mM L-
glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate), under basal conditions and in response to 1 μM 
oligomycin, 2 μM fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), 200 μM Etomoxir 
(Eto) and 1 μM Rotenone/antimycin A (Rot/AA) using the XF-24 Extracellular Flux 
Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Intracellular levels of ATP in Treg cells were measured 
using luminescent ATP detection assay kit (Abcam).
Gene expression profiling
RNA samples from donor-derived Treg cells from CD45.1+:WT and 
CD45.1+:Foxp3CreStk11fl/fl mixed BM chimeras (n = 5 each group) were analyzed using the 
Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Signals array. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified by 
ANOVA (Partek Genomics Suit 6.5), and the Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to 
estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was 
performed as described previously36. The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene 
Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE83088.
Serum antibodies
Immunoglobulin subclasses were measured with kits from Alpha Diagnostic International 
(5110) and Millipore (MGAMMAG-300K), respectively36.
OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation
Mice were sensitized with mixture of OVA (50 μg/ml per mouse) and alum adjuvant (1:2 
dilution) injected intraperitoneally (100 μl per mouse), followed by the second sensitization 
12 days later. Eight days after the second sensitization, mice were intranasally challenged 
with OVA for 4 consecutive days. At 18 h after the last challenge, lymphocytes were isolated 
from the spleen and lung and analyzed by flow cytometry.

 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP methodology was performed as described37,38. Briefly, cells were cross-linked for 40 
min using 12.5 μM ethylene glycol-bis(succinimidyl succinate) (ThermoFisherScientific), 
followed by the addition of formaldehyde (1% final concentration) and incubation for 
additional 20 min. After the reactions were quenched with glycine, cell pellets were lysed in 
cell lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.3% NP-40 and 1 
mM DTT) containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were 
pelleted and lysed in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor 
tablet for 10 min on ice, prior to sonication into 500 bp pieces using a Diagenode Bioruptor. 
Sheared chromatin was cleared of debris and incubated with IgG (Santa Cruz) or anti-β-
catenin antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:50) and blocker (Active Motif) rotating overnight at 4ºC. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and subsequent DNA purification were performed using the 
ChIP-IT High Sensitivity Kit (Active Motif) per manufacturer’s instructions. Realtime PCRs 
were performed using the primers spanning the TCF3 motif in the Pdcd1 locus (http://
rstats.immgen.org/Chromatin/chromatin.html): F-GGAAACAGGCACCAAGACAT, R-
CTACTCAATCCGTGGGAGGA, and negative control primer sets (Active Motif #71011). 
Data analysis was performed using the ‘Percent Input’ normalization method.
Statistical analysis
P values were calculated by Mann-Whitney test, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test, one-
way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA as indicated using GraphPad Prism, unless otherwise 
noted. Statistical analysis of mouse survival and respective P values were determined using 
the Logrank test. P < 0.05 was considered as significant. All error bars represent the s.e.m.

 Treg cells establishes metabolic and homeostatic fitness required for preventing undesired 
immune responses through selectively controlling the expression of inhibitory regulators, 
including PD-1, GITR and OX40. Consequently, uncontrolled expression of PD-1 and 
possible other receptors impairs the capability of Treg cells in suppressing TH2 immune 
responses triggered by TSLP-induced PD-L2+ DCs. Although not depicted here, IL-4 
contributes to the induction of PD-L2 on DCs and the amplification of TH2-mediated 
immunopathology.
