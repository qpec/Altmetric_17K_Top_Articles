Laser pointers are low-energy 
light sources that can emit focal 
nonionizing radiation. They are 
used in various situations and are 
inappropriately used as toys for some 
children. Most laser pointer devices 
are red (670 nm wavelength) or green 
diode lasers (532 nm wavelength).
In the United States, the safety level of 
laser devices is categorized according 
to the American National Standard 
Institute Z136.1 and most consumer 
laser pointers fall under class II or class 
IIIA level of safety, which encompasses 
lasers of 1 to 5 mW or less of power. 
Handheld lasers can be more powerful, 
either class 3B (5–500 mW) or class 
4 (> 500 mW), and these lasers may 
cause immediate eye hazard when 
viewed directly. 
1 Previously, laser 
pointers were considered as harmless; 
however, in recent years, there have 
been increasing number of cases of 
retinal injury caused by mishandling 
of laser pointers among in children.

Hence, accidental retinal injury among 
children due to laser pointer exposure 
represents a serious, but preventable, 
public health issue.
We report 4 children with retinal 
injury caused by laser pointer exposure 
to emphasize the significance of 
vision loss due to improper use of the 
devices. Moreover, it is important for 
health professionals to recognize and 
be cognizant of the presentation and 
natural history of retinal injury from 
laser pointer use.
METHODS
A retrospective review of all cases of 
laser pointer induced damage to the 
abstract
This case report describes 4 male children (age, 9–16) who had laser-related 
retinal injury to the macula of 1 eye or both eyes due to the mishandling 
of the laser pointer devices at a single vitreoretinal clinical practice. The 
presenting symptoms associated with laser pointer injury include central 
vision loss, central scotoma, and metamorphopsia. Clinical findings of 
laser-related retinal injury include reduced visual acuity, disruption of 
the photoreceptor ellipsoid zone, retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, 
and choroidal neovascular membrane formation. Disruption of the foveal 
ellipsoid zone (photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment layer) is the 
most common finding on optical coherence tomography imaging. Three 
patients had potential irreversible vision loss. Laser pointers are readily 
available and appropriate use of laser pointers in the pediatric population 
must be emphasized due to the potential irreversible retinal injury. Health 
professionals, school teachers, and parents should raise public awareness of 
this emerging public health issue by educating children about the dangers of 
laser pointers. Laser pointer devices among children should be discouraged 
and limited due to the possibility of permanent harm to themselves and 
others. Legislation and laws may be required to better control the sale and 
use of these devices.

surgery practice.
RESULTS
Case 1
A 12-year-old boy presented with 
bilateral central scotomas and 
decreased vision shortly after he 
directly looked at the green laser 
pointer for ~1 minute. His best 
corrected Snellen visual acuity 
(BCVA) was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS. 
Funduscopic examination identified 
pigment clumping with focal retinal 
pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy 
for both eyes ( 
Fig 1 A and B). Optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) of the 
macula revealed bilateral disruption 
of the foveal photoreceptor ellipsoid 
zone (photoreceptor inner segment/
outer segment;  
Fig 1 C and D). 
At 7-month follow-up, the BCVA 
and macular findings remained 
unchanged.
Case 2
A 9-year-old boy presented with 
a 4-day history of central scotoma 
and vision loss OD. Symptoms 
occurred ~5 to 10 seconds after 
looking at the reflection of a green 
laser pointer into a mirror that was 
directed at his right eye. His BCVA 
was 20/50 OD and 20/25 for OS. 
Funduscopic examination revealed 
macular pigment changes in the 
right eye only ( 
Fig 2 A and B). OCT 
OD revealed subfoveal outer retinal 
hyperreflectivity with disruption of 
the foveal photoreceptors ( 
Fig 2C). 
The patient was treated with 
prednisolone 1% 3 times per day for 
OD for 2 weeks. After 1 month, the 
visual acuity improved to 20/30 OD 
with persistent abnormalities of the 
photoreceptors OD. His examination 
OS was unchanged.
Case 3
A 16-year-old boy presented with 
a 3-day history of bilateral central 
vision loss and central scotoma 
that occurred immediately after

playing with a green laser pointer 
for approximately half minute. On 
examination, BCVA was 20/30 OU. 
Funduscopic examination revealed 
macular chorioretinal scars and 
focal RPE atrophy ( 
Fig 3 A and B). 
The OCT revealed disruption of the 
photoreceptor ellipsoid zone in both 
eyes ( 
Fig 3 C and D). Two weeks after 
presentation, the patient complained 
about worsening central vision 
with enlarging scotomas in both 
eyes. On examination, the maculae 
had significantly worse pigmentary 
changes with increases in RPE 
atrophy ( 
Fig 4 A and B). Visual acuity 
decreased to 20/40 in both eyes and 
did not further improve.
Case 4
A 12-year-old boy presented 
with central vision loss and 
metamorphopsia with a central 
scotoma right eye, which occurred 
immediately after looking directly 
at the light of a red laser pointer 
shown into his right eye for ~15 
seconds. His BCVA was 20/70 OD and 
20/20 OS. Funduscopic examination 
revealed RPE atrophy and a choroidal 
neovascular membrane with 
subretinal hemorrhage. Examination 
of left eye was normal. He received 
an intravitreal bevacizumab 1.25 
mg/0.05 mL OD and his BCVA and 
symptoms gradually improved after 
1 injection. At 1-year follow-up, 
BCVA improved to 20/20 OD with 
significant improvement in his 
subjective metamorphopsia.
DISCUSSION
Over the past 15 years, there has 
been an alarming increase in reports 
of laser pointer induced retinal 
injury among children.

–11 Here, we 
describe 4 cases of retinal injury 
caused by laser pointers among 
children within a 2-year period, the 
youngest of which was only 9 years 
of age. A summary of all 4 cases 
can be found in  
Table 1. Factors 
attributed to eye injury in our series 
include the following: availability

of these devices, lack of awareness 
of the potential dangers associated 
with laser pointers, and the improper 
use of the devices. Currently, laser 
pointers are readily available and, 
owing to various questionable 
online merchants, these devices 
are increasingly more powerful. 
13 
Because retinal injury due to laser 
pointers might be irreversible, we 
feel that this is a significant public 
health issue.
Laser-related retinal injury is 
dependent on both patient-related 
(eg, pupil size, refractive status, 
degree of retinal pigmentation, 
proximity of incident laser beam 
to the fovea) and laser-related 
factors (eg, wavelength, pulsatile 
duration, and energy of the laser 
beam). 
14 Among those, 3 of the 
most important variables include 
the following: the amount of energy 
delivered by the laser, the duration of 
exposure, and location of the retinal 
involvement. 
14 In our case series, the 
retinal injury occurred in 3 children 
who were playing with green laser 
pointers. Green laser pointers are 
becoming increasingly more popular 
and abundantly available, 
 
15 which 
is concerning because experiments 
reveal that green laser pointers 
(490–575 nm) are more harmful to 
the retina compared with red laser 
pointers (630–750 nm).

The most commonly used laser 
pointers have a power output <5 
mW, which are not considered as 
harmful to human eye because of 
the limited exposure aided by innate 
ocular protective mechanisms 
(such as blink reflex and aversion 
response). 
18 However, as shown in 
case series, children increase their 
chance to retinal injury by staring 
at the laser beam without blinking 
or averting the eye for a prolonged 
duration. 
7 In addition, the labeling of 
the power output of a laser point may 
be different from the device’s actual 
specifications. Recent work reveals 
that, after measuring the power of 
122 laser pointers labeled as 1 to 
5 mW, it was found that 90% 
of green laser pointers and 44% of 
red laser pointers tested had power 
outputs >5 mW. 
19
As health professionals, it is 
important to be aware of the 
symptoms of retinal injury caused 
by laser pointers and to emphasize 
the potential irreversible harm of 
laser pointers to retinal injury among 
children. A systematic approach, 
including the history of laser 
exposure, presenting symptoms, and 
physical examination, could facilitate 
an appropriate evaluation and 
referral. Vision loss and persistent 
central scotoma normally occur 
immediately after the laser beam 
exposure. These symptoms can occur 
in 1 eye or both eyes, which can 
be preceded by the perception of a 
bright flash or accompanied by an 
audible “popping” sound. 
18 Although 
eye pain, redness, and/or irritation 
are common complaints, none of 
those symptoms are typically caused 
by the direct laser pointer exposure.
A study suggested various questions 
to help health professionals 
diagnose alleged laser eye injuries: 
whether eye symptoms could have 
been caused by a laser, whether 
they have been documented 
by ophthalmoscopy and retinal 
imaging, and whether any somatic 
complaints are supported by 
scientific evidence. 
18 If decrease 
vision and persistent after-images 
or scotoma are present, and their 
history demonstrates a likelihood 
of significant exposure, one should 
refer the child to an ophthalmologist 
for full ophthalmologic workup 
such as Amsler grid testing, dilated 
funduscopic examination, and OCT or 
fluorescein angiography imaging.

The treatment of retinal injury 
associated with a laser pointer 
is limited and also controversial. 
Current treatment of macular injury 
induced by laser beam is mainly 
limited to systemic corticosteroids, 
which has shown mixed results. 
14 
Observation is an option, as many of 
these patients will have stabilization 
of visual acuity over time. If a 
choroidal neovascular membrane 
forms as a result of direct trauma 
from the laser to Bruch’s membrane, 
a vascular endothelial growth factor 
inhibitor (such as with intravitreal 
bevacizumab) is recommended to 
arrest neovascular growth. Final 
visual recovery is dependent on 
lesion location and size. 
1 In our case 
series, all children suffered foveal 
laser burns and 3 boys had a final 
BCVA 2 lines worse than the 20/20 
line.
To our knowledge, this is the 
largest reported case series of laser 
pointer-induced retinal damage 
in the pediatric population in 
a developed country to date. It 
emphasizes the need for increased 
recognition of the potential dangers 
of retinal injury caused by laser 
pointers. Potential irreversible 
vision-threatening consequences due 
to the mishandling of these devices 
should be communicated to health 
professionals, school teachers, and 
guardians in an attempt to raise the 
public awareness of this emerging 
public health issue. Unsupervised use 
of these laser pointer devices among 
children should be discouraged, 
and there is a need for legislation to 
limit these devices in the pediatric 
population.
