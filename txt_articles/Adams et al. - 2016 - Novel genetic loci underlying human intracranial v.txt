 Novel genetic loci underlying human intracranial volume 
identified through genome-wide association
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Abstract
Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during development, and remains 
stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely 
undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five novel loci 
for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci are also associated with 
adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for 
height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference (ρgenetic=0.748), which 
indicated a similar genetic background and allowed for the identification of four additional loci

 through meta-analysis (Ncombined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to 
childhood and adult cognitive function, Parkinson’s disease, and enriched near genes involved in 
growth pathways including PI3K–AKT signaling. These findings identify biological 
underpinnings of intracranial volume and provide genetic support for theories on brain reserve and 
brain overgrowth.
The intricate genetic control of the human brain, complemented by environmental factors, 
leads to the observed variations in brain size in human populations1. Intracranial volume is 
closely related to brain volume in early life as the brain grows.2,3 However, it becomes 
stable after the brain has fully developed and remains unaffected by later age-related 
changes such as brain atrophy4,5, thus representing the maximal attained brain size. 
Discovering genetic variants that influence intracranial volume can contribute to our 
understanding of brain development and related diseases, but prior studies have only 
identified two influential genetic loci6–9.
Here, we performed genome-wide association studies in populations from the Cohorts for 
Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)10 and Enhancing 
NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA)11 consortia on intracranial 
volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Genotypes were imputed to the 1000 
Genomes reference panel (phase 1, version 3). Meta-analysis revealed five novel loci 
associated with intracranial volume. We also discovered genome-wide overlap between 
intracranial volume and other key traits including height, cognitive ability, and Parkinson’s 
disease. Furthermore, we found relatively enriched patterns of association for certain 
functional categories of variants and near genes that are involved in specific pathways.
RESULTS
Genome-wide association studies
Detailed information on the population characteristics, image acquisition and processing, 
and genetic quality control can be found in the Online Methods and Supplementary Tables 
S1–3.
The discovery meta-analysis (N = 26,577) yielded seven genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 
10−8) loci, five of them novel (Figures 1–2; Table 1). The quantile-quantile plot showed 
inflation (λ = 1.092; Supplementary Figure S1), which we determined to be mainly due to 
polygenicity rather than cryptic relatedness or population stratification using LD score 
regression12. Next we analyzed European samples (N = 2,362; not included in the discovery 
sample) and generalization samples with African (N = 938), Asian (N = 955), and Hispanic 
(N = 1,605) ancestries (Table 1). All variants had the same direction of effect in the 
additional European samples (sign test, P = 0.0078), and three variants replicated, at nominal 
significance. Although sample sizes were generally small for the non-Europeans, here too, 
the direction of effect was generally concordant with the discovery (sign test, P = 0.039). 
Five nominally significant associations were detected across all three ethnicities.
Next we were able to map the association to novel variants for two previously identified loci 
at chromosome 17q21 (rs199525; P = 3.8 × 10−21) and 6q22 (rs11759026; P = 2.2 ×

 10−20)6,7. The five novel loci were on chr 6q21 (rs2022464; P = 3.7 × 10−11), chr 10q24 
(rs11191683; P = 1.1 × 10−10), chr 3q28 (rs9811910; P = 2.0 × 10−9), chr 12q14 
(rs138074335/ rs7312464; P = 6.2 × 10−9), and chr 12q23 (rs2195243; P = 1.5 × 10−8). 
Functional annotation of the variants and those in LD (r2>0.8) can be found in 
Supplementary Table S4.
Height-adjusted analyses
Four of the seven loci for intracranial volume were previously discovered for height (17q21, 
6q22, 6q21, and 12q14), prompting us to investigate genome-wide overlap between the two 
traits. As height and intracranial volume are correlated (weighted average Pearson’s r = 
0.556; Supplementary Table S5) and this could drive association signals, we performed a 
GWAS of intracranial volume adjusted for height in the studies that had measured height (N 
= 21,875). Findings were compared to the corresponding subset of studies without 
adjustment (N = 22,378). Using LD score regression (Online Methods), we found that there 
is considerable genetic correlation between intracranial volume and height (ρgenetic = 0.241, 
P = 2.4 × 10−10), which disappears after adjusting for height (ρgenetic = 0.049, P = 0.21) 
(Table 2). The associations of the seven intracranial volume loci, however, remained 
significant after adjusting for height (Supplementary Table S6). To investigate whether more 
height loci were associated with intracranial volume independently of height, we analyzed 
all 697 genome-wide significant height variants13. An additional 73 variants (10.7%; 14 
variants not available) showed nominally significant associations with intracranial volume 
but were not attenuated after adjustment for height, although none survived Bonferroni 
correction (Supplementary Table S7). For some variants, the direction of effect was 
discordant, i.e. positive for height and negative for intracranial volume. Furthermore, a 
polygenic score of the 697 variants predicted intracranial volume, and this was also the case 
after adjustment for height in a subset of the studies (Supplementary Table S8).
Genetic correlation
In addition to height, we examined the genome-wide genetic overlap between intracranial 
volume and other anthropometric traits, cognitive function, and neurodegenerative diseases 
(Table 2). We found a strong genetic correlation with child head circumference (ρgenetic = 
0.748), which validates intracranial volume as a measure of brain growth during early 
development. Since this high correlation indicates that the genetic determinants of 
intracranial volume and child head circumference are largely shared, we aimed to leverage 
this information by performing a meta-analysis of both traits. The meta-analysis (combined 
N = 37,345) led to the identification of four novel loci (Figure 3; Supplementary Table S9).
Weaker correlations were found with birth length and weight (ρgenetic < 0.3), which 
attenuated after adjusting for height. Additionally, intracranial volume was genetically 
correlated with cognitive function in childhood (ρgenetic = 0.277, P = 2.2×10−3) as well as 
general cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults (ρgenetic = 0.202, P = 6.3×10−4). 
Furthermore, we found a positive genetic correlation with Parkinson’s disease (ρgenetic = 
0.315, P = 6.6 × 10−7), but there was no significant genetic overlap with Alzheimer’s 
disease, white matter lesions, and psychiatric traits.

 Enrichment analyses
Next, we assessed whether particular subsets of genetic variants were enriched for 
association with intracranial volume using partitioned heritability and pathway analyses 
(Online Methods). Overall, we found that common variants genotyped from across the 
whole genome explained 25.42% (S.E. 2.73%) of the variation in intracranial volume. 
Partitioning heritability by chromosome showed that chromosome 22 contributed twofold 
more to variation in intracranial volume than would be expected by its size (Figure 4A), 
which was not seen for any of the other complex traits from the genetic correlation analysis 
(Supplementary Figure S2). Partitioning by functional elements showed an enrichment for 
introns and several histone codes that are found in actively transcribed promoters (Figure 
4B). The enrichment for intronic variants was specific to intracranial volume, whereas the 
other functional classes were also enriched in other complex traits (Supplementary Figure 
S3). We also found that loci associated with intracranial volume cluster around genes 
involved in specific pathways, with 94 pathways significantly enriched (Figure 4C; full list 
in Supplementary Table S10). These pathways included all cell cycle components – the M-, 
G1-, S-, and G2-phases – and various growth factor signaling pathways, including PI3K–
AKT.
Head growth trajectories
Although intracranial volume reflects brain development until maturation, and we identified 
influences of many growth-related processes contributing to its variation, all loci were still 
discovered via cross-sectional associations in adults. Therefore, we tested whether a 
polygenic score of the 7 loci could predict head growth in a longitudinal cohort of 2,824 
children of European ancestry followed prenatally until 6 years of age (Online Methods). 
We found that a higher polygenic score, representing a genetically larger intracranial volume 
in adults, was also associated with a larger child head circumference (β = .031 per SD, P = 
0.010). Furthermore, the effect of the polygenic score was age-dependent and more 
prominent in older children (β = 0.0080 per SD polygenic score per year age, Pinteraction = 
0.0091). When investigating the individual loci separately, both 17q21 and 12q14 showed 
significant associations with child head circumference, but they influenced the trajectories of 
head growth differently (Figure 4A–B). For 17q21, the negative impact of the G allele on 
head circumference becomes apparent postnatally and increases towards six years, whereas 
the 12q14 locus exerts an effect from early pregnancy to one year of age, but is less 
prominent later in life.
DISCUSSION
Genes contributing to variation in the size of the human brain remain challenging to 
discover. In a worldwide project of unprecedented scale, we performed the largest-ever 
meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of intracranial volume. We discovered 
five novel genetic loci associated with intracranial volume, and replicated two known 
signals. The discovery sample included Europeans only, but the direction of effect was 
similar in other ethnicities. The genes in these loci provide intriguing links between maximal 
brain size and various processes, including neural stem cell proliferation (FOXO3), 
neurodegeneration (MAPT), bone mineralization (CENPW), growth signaling (IGF1,

 HMGA2), DNA replication (GMNC), and rRNA maturation (PDCD). On a genome-wide 
scale, we discovered evidence of genetic correlation between intracranial volume and other 
key traits such as height and cognitive function, and also with Parkinson’s disease, 
indicating that the genes underlying brain development have far-reaching effects well 
beyond the initial years of life.
The 17q21 locus tags a 1Mb inversion that is under positive selection in Caucasians14. It 
contains multiple genes including the MAPT and KANSL1. The MAPT gene is consistently 
implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease, 
Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia15,16, and microduplications have been 
reported to cause microcephaly17. KANSL1 causes the reciprocal 17q21.31 microdeletion 
syndrome - a multisystem disorder with intellectual disability, hypotonia and distinctive 
facial features18. The signal at 6q22 is intergenic to CENPW and RSPO3, but now lies 
172kb closer to CENPW. Interestingly, multiple variants at this locus independently 
influence bone mineral density19,20, and our signal particularly overlaps with the variant 
showing high specificity for the skull20.
The significant variants at chr 6q21 span FOXO3, a gene associated with longevity21, 
height13, and serum IGF1 levels22. FOXO3 regulates the proliferation of neural stem cells, 
and knockout mice show larger brains resulting from increased proliferation immediately 
after birth23, followed by a decrease in adult neural stem cell renewal23,24. The rs3800229 
variant in strong LD with our top variant (r2 = 0.84) contains chromatin promoter marks in 
the fetal brain (Supplementary Table S4), and regulates serum IGF1 levels in infants25. This 
provides a link to the genome-wide significant locus on chr12q23 near IGF1, pointing to a 
potential mechanism through which these loci may affect brain growth. Chr12q23 lies 20Mb 
from one of two loci previously detected for head circumference in children26, but that 
region was not associated with intracranial volume in our study (rs7980687; P = 0.06). The 
other reported child head circumference locus, however, corresponded to our chr12q14 
signal, with the top variant lying 14kb downstream of HMGA2, and already showed 
suggestive association with intracranial volume in a previous report7. It has also previously 
been associated with height13 and is essential for growth27. The chr10q24 LD-block covers 
multiple genes, but an intronic variant within PDCD11 is most significant. PDCD11 encodes 
an NF-kappa-B-binding protein required for rRNA maturation and generation of 18S 
rRNA28. A variant in LD (rs7894407) has recently been identified in a GWAS of cerebral 
white matter hyperintensities29. The top chr3q28 variant is located upstream of GMNC, 
which codes for the geminin coiled-coil domain-containing protein essential for DNA 
replication30.
Prior efforts to identify variants affecting intracranial volume were much smaller and 
critically did not adjust for height6–9. We found that 4 out of 7 loci were already discovered 
for height13, but also that over 10% of the known ‘height loci’ actually affect intracranial 
volume, even after regressing out height. Interestingly, some variants showed discordant 
associations for height and intracranial volume - in line with the recent finding that different 
height loci disproportionally affect either leg length or spine/head length31 and may be a 
marker for pathological development32. Also, height might thus serve as a proxy phenotype 
for intracranial volume, with the tenfold larger sample of the height GWAS giving greater

 power to detect associations. Neural genes are also enriched in pathway analyses of height13. 
However, to fully disentangle whether these identified genes are ‘height genes’, ‘brain 
volume genes’, or ‘growth genes’ (i.e., pleiotropic), a large collaborative effort is needed that 
examines the association of these variants with both intracranial volume and height under 
various models.
When investigating genome-wide overlap with other traits, we found a strong correlation 
with child head circumference, underlining that intracranial volume is valid measure for 
maximal attained brain size. We were able to leverage this genetic link by meta-analyzing 
both traits, which led to the identification of four additional loci (2q32.1, 3q23, 7p14.3, 
22q13.2). The correlations with birth length and weight were weaker and decreased further 
after adjusting for height, so a similar phenotypic correlation between head size and body 
size at younger age may drive these correlations. Intracranial volume was also genetically 
associated with cognitive function in childhood as well as general cognitive function in 
middle-aged and older individuals. This indicates that variation in maximally attained brain 
size during development shares a genetic basis with cognitive ability later in life and 
supports intracranial volume as a measure of brain reserve5.
The brain reserve hypothesis states that premorbid brain size can modify resilience to age-
related brain pathology33, but there was no indication of a genome-wide overlap with 
Alzheimer’s disease. However, we found a positive genetic correlation with Parkinson’s 
disease that rather points to a brain “overgrowth” hypothesis. Interestingly, the IGF1 and the 
PI3K–AKT pathways, key factors in both growth signaling and our current study of 
intracranial volume, are neuroprotective in a model system of Parkinson’s disease34. There 
were no correlations with other neurological or psychiatric traits, indicating that this finding 
might be specific to Parkinson’s disease. However, it is important to note that there is a 
certain extent of variation in the sample size and power of these studies, and larger GWAS 
might reveal genetic correlation with other traits as well.
It is not yet known if variance in intracranial volume, within the normal range, contributes to 
disease risk or brain reserve. There is no doubt that in the pathological extremes of the 
distribution, size can matter, as in disorders such as microcephaly or macrocephaly. Here we 
found evidence for a shared genetic background between intracranial volume and cognitive 
function, and risk of Parkinson’s disease. While not definitive, these are novel pieces of 
empirical evidence in the debate on whether or not whole brain size matters.
The pathway analyses highlight cellular growth and proliferation and included all 
components of the cell cycle (M-, G1-, S-, and G2-phase) and various growth factor 
signaling pathways. PI3K–AKT signaling has a well described role in brain overgrowth 
disorders35,36, and was the only significant pathway using a different pathway analysis 
method (Supplementary Table S11). Interestingly, AKT3 intronic variants showed 
suggestive evidence for association with intracranial volume (rs7538011; P = 9.2 × 10−7). 
Deletions of AKT3 cause microcephaly syndromes37, whereas duplications give rise to 
macrocephaly38. Similar to FOXO3, it is part of the IGF1 signaling pathway, which is 
important for human longevity39. The PI3K–AKT signaling pathway seems to have an 
important role in brain growth, not only in pathological extremes, but also for normal

 variation at a population level. Other pathways enriched for association with intracranial 
volume highlight neuronal functions such as neurotransmission and axon guidance.
We identified novel loci all influencing intracranial volume and, at a genome-wide level, 
there seem to be common pathways, but our longitudinal study reveals that their 
developmental effects are complex. The loci influenced trajectories of head growth 
differently; it also would be interesting to investigate whether their spatial profiles of effects 
are distinct, where certain loci promote growth of particular brain regions.
Here we identified key genetic loci implicated in intracranial volume within a global 
collaborative effort, followed by computational analyses to determine the important 
biological pathways and functional elements. While the majority of the genetic variants are 
yet to be discovered, it is clear that these will provide better insight into brain development, 
but also into related neuropsychiatric traits such as cognitive functioning and even for 
neurodegeneration late in life. Uncovering the remaining heritability will advance our 
understanding of the brain’s complex genetic architecture.
ONLINE METHODS
Study population
This study reports data on 32,438 subjects from 52 study sites that are part of the Cohorts for 
Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)10 consortium and 
Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA)11 consortium. 
Briefly, the CHARGE consortium is a collaboration of predominantly population-based 
cohort studies that investigate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of age-related 
complex diseases, including those of the brain. The ENIGMA consortium brings together 
numerous studies, mainly with a case-control design, which performed neuroimaging in a 
range of neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases, as well as healthy normative 
populations. Studies participated in either the discovery cohort of European ancestry, the 
replication in European ancestry, or the generalization to other ethnicities. An overview of 
the demographics and type of contribution for each cohort is provided in Supplementary 
Table S1. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Each study was 
approved by the respective Institutional Review Board or Local Ethics Committee.
Genetics
Genotyping was performed using a variety of commercial arrays across the contributing 
sites. Both samples as well as variants underwent similar quality control procedures based 
on genetic homogeneity, call rate (less than 95%), minor allele frequency (MAF < 0.01), and 
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p-value less than 1 × 10−6). Good quality variants were 
used as input for imputation to the 1000 Genomes reference panel (phase 1, version 3) using 
validated software packages (MaCH/minimac, IMPUTE2, BEAGLE, GenABLE). Variants 
that were poorly imputed (R2 < 0.5) or uncommon (MAF < 0.5%) were removed prior to 
meta-analysis. Full details on the site-specific genotyping and quality control may be found 
in Supplementary Table S2.

 Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained from scanners with a diversity of 
manufacturers, field strengths, and acquisition protocols. Images were used to estimate 
milliliters of intracranial volume from automated segmentations generated by freely 
available or in-house methods that have been described and validated earlier. Most sites 
measured intracranial volume for each participant by multiplying the inverse of the 
determinant of the transformation matrix required to register the subject’s MRI scan to a 
common template by the template volume (1,948,105 mm3), using the FreeSurfer software. 
Visual inspections were performed to identify and remove poorly segmented images. Either 
all scans were visually inspected, or sites generated histogram plots to identify any outliers, 
which were defined as individuals with a volume more than three standard deviations away 
from the mean. Statistical outliers were only excluded if the segmentations were deemed 
improper‥ More site-specific information related to the imaging is available in 
Supplementary Table S3.
Genome-wide association studies
Genome-wide association studies of intracranial volume were performed for each site 
separately, controlling for age, sex, and, when applicable, age2, population stratification 
variables (MDS / principal components), study site (for multi-site studies only), diagnosis 
(for case-control studies only). Studies of unrelated individuals performed a linear regression 
analyses whereas studies of related individuals (ASPSFam, BrainSCALE, ERF, GeneSTAR, 
GOBS, NeuroIMAGE, NTR-Adults, OATS, QTIM, SYS) used linear mixed models to 
account for familial relationships. Summary statistics, including the effect estimates of the 
genetic variant with intracranial volume under an additive model, were exchanged to 
perform a fixed-effects meta-analysis weighting for sample size in METAL40. After the final 
meta-analysis, variants were excluded if they were only available for fewer than 5,000 
individuals. Meta-analyses were stratified by race and done separately for discovery, 
replication, and generalization samples. Beta coefficients were recalculated from Z-scores, 
allele frequencies, and the sample, as described earlier41 Site-specific quantile-quantile plots 
were generated to inspect the presence of genomic inflation. The variance explained by all 
variants in the GWAS was estimated using LD score regression12,42. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed by excluding patients.
Functional annotation
All tracks of the regional association plots were taken from the UCSC Genome Browser 
Human hg19 assembly. SNPs (top 5%) shows the top 5% associated variants within the 
locus and are colored by their correlation to the top variant. Genes shows the gene models 
from GENCODE version 19. The tracks give the predicted chromatin states based on 
computational integration of ChIP-seq data for 12 chromatin marks in various human tissues 
derived from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium43. Additionally, we used HaploReg 
version 3 for annotation of the top variants and all variants in LD (> 0.80) (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg_v3.php).

 Genetic correlation
The genetic correlation analyses were also performed using LD score regression. The 
GWAS meta-analysis of intracranial volume, as well as the height adjusted and height subset 
meta-analyses, were correlated with published GWAS of the following traits: Child head 
circumference26, birth weight44, birth length45, adult height13, childhood cognitive 
function46, adult cognitive function47, Alzheimer’s disease48, Parkinson’s disease49, white 
matter lesions50, psychiatric disorders51, neuroticism52, and extraversion53.
Enrichment analyses
To determine whether the intracranial volume association results were enriched for certain 
types of genetic variants, we employed two strategies: partitioned heritability and pathway 
analyses.
Partitioned heritability was calculated using a previously described method42. This was done 
by partitioning variants by chromosome and by 28 functional classes: coding, UTR, 
promoter, intron, histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac5 and two versions of 
H3K27ac, open chromatin DNase I hypersensitivity Site (DHS) regions, combined 
chromHMM/Segway predictions, regions that are conserved in mammals, super-enhancers 
and active enhancers from the FANTOM5 panel of samples (Finucane et al. page 4)42. 
Multiple testing thresholds were calculated accordingly: Pthresh = 0.05/(22 chromosomes) = 
2.27 × 10−3 for the chromosomes and Pthresh = 0.05/(28 classes) = 1.79 × 10−3 for the 
functional classes.
Pathway analyses were performed using the KGG2.554 and MAGENTA55 software 
packages. LD was calculated based with the 1000 Genomes Project European samples as a 
reference (see URLs). Variants were considered to be within a gene if they were within 5 kb 
of the 3’/5’ UTR based on chromosome positions (hg19) coordinates. Gene-based tests were 
done with the GATES test54 without weighting P-values by predicted functional relevance. 
Pathway analysis was performed using the HYST test of association56. A multiple testing 
threshold accounting for the number of pathways tested resulting in a significance threshold 
of Pthresh = 0.05/(671 pathways) = 7.45 × 10−5.
Head growth trajectories
Head growth trajectory analyses were done within the Generation R study, a longitudinal 
cohort study situated in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. For this analysis we included 2,824 
children of European ancestry followed prenatally until 6 years of age. Head size was 
measured at the following points: prenatally (using echo) during the first, second, and third 
trimester, and postnatally (measuring head circumference) at 0–2 months, 2 months, 3 
months, 4 months, 5–10 months, 10–13 months, 13–17 months, and 5 years of age. We 
tested whether a polygenic score of the 7 loci, as well as the 7 loci themselves separately, 
were related to head growth using linear mixed models and included an interaction term 
between time and the genetic score/variant (SAS software). Next, the predicted values were 
calculated for each person and plotted over time, stratified by genotype (0/1/2 risk alleles) 
using the R software package.

 Figure 1. Common genetic variants associated with intracranial volume
Manhattan plot where every point represents a single genetic variant plotted according to its 
genomic position (x-axis) and its –log10(p-value) for association with intracranial volume 
(y-axis). Variants in blue are genome-wide significant in a previously known locus, whereas 
red variants reach genome-wide significant for the first time in that locus. The dashed 
horizontal line represents a significance threshold of p-value < 10−6 and the full horizontal 
line represents genome-wide significance of p-value < 5 × 10−8. Variants surpassing these 
thresholds are indicated by larger points.

 Figure 2. Regional association and functional annotation of novel genome-wide significant loci
Regional association plots for the five novel genome-wide significant loci of intracranial 
volume with gene models below (GENCODE version 19). Annotation tracks below from the 
Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium57 highlight the genomic region that likely harbors the 
causal variant(s) (r2 > 0.8 from the top SNP). See Online Methods for detailed track 
information. Plots were generated using the LocusTrack software (http://gump.qimr.edu.au/

 Figure 3. Meta-analysis of intracranial volume and child head circumference
A ‘twin’ Manhattan plot shows every variant twice: once for the discovery analysis and once 
for the combined discovery plus replication analysis. The least significant association of the 
variant-pair is plotted in grey (alternating light and dark between chromosomes). The most 
significant association of the variant-pair is plotted in red if is from the combined analysis 
(i.e., the association became more significant after meta-analyzing with the child head 
circumference GWAS) and in turquoise if it is from the discovery analysis (i.e., the 
association became less significant after meta-analyzing with the child head circumference 
GWAS). The dashed horizontal line represents a significance threshold of p-value < 10−6 
and the full horizontal line represents genome-wide significance of p-value < 5 × 10−8. 
Variants surpassing these thresholds are indicated by larger and brighter points.
