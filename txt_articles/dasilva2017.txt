IMPORTANCE There are no prospective cohort studies assessing the incidence and spectrum
of neurologic manifestations secondary to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in adults.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the rates of acute ZIKV infection among patients hospitalized with
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), meningoencephalitis, or transverse myelitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, observational cohort study was
conducted at a tertiary referral center for neurological diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
between December 5, 2015, and May 10, 2016, among consecutive hospitalized adults
(>18 years of age) with new-onset acute parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease. All
participants were tested for a series of arbovirosis. Three-month functional outcome was
assessed.
INTERVENTIONS Samples of serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested for ZIKV using
real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and an IgM antibody-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical, radiographic (magnetic resonance imaging),
electrophysiological, and 3-month functional outcome data were collected.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The detection of neurologic complications secondary to
ZIKV infection.
RESULTS Forty patients (15 women and 25 men; median age, 44 years [range, 22-72 years])
were enrolled, including 29 patients (73%) with GBS (90% Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 (18%)
with encephalitis, 3 (8%) with transverse myelitis, and 1 (3%) with newly diagnosed chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Of these, 35 patients (88%) had molecular
and/or serologic evidence of recent ZIKV infection in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Of
the patients positive for ZIKV infection, 27 had GBS (18 demyelinating, 8 axonal, and 1 Miller
Fisher syndrome), 5 had encephalitis (3 with concomitant acute neuromuscular disease),
2 had transverse myelitis, and 1 had chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
Admission to the intensive care unit was required for 9 patients positive for ZIKV infection
(26%), and 5 (14%) required mechanical ventilation. Compared with admission during the
period from December 5, 2013, to May 10, 2014 (before the Brazilian outbreak of ZIKV),
admissions for GBS increased from a mean of 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions for
encephalitis increased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per month, and admissions for transverse
myelitis remained constant at 0.6 per month. At 3 months, 2 patients positive for ZIKV
infection (6%) died (1 with GBS and 1 with encephalitis), 18 (51%) had chronic pain, and the
median modified Rankin score among survivors was 2 (range, 0-5).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this single-center Brazilian cohort, ZIKV infection was
associated with an increase in the incidence of a diverse spectrum of serious neurologic
syndromes. The data also suggest that serologic and molecular testing using blood and
cerebrospinal fluid samples can serve as a less expensive, alternative diagnostic strategy in
developing countries, where plaque reduction neutralization testing is impractical.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus related to the dengue, yel-
low fever, and West Nile viruses and is transmitted by
the Aedes mosquito species. In July 2015, 76 patients
with neurologic syndromes and recent symptoms suggestive
of ZIKV infection were identified in the state of Bahia, Brazil,
of which 42 (55%) had confirmed Guillain-Barré syndrome
(GBS).1 By July 2016, a total of 165 932 suspected cases of ZIKV
infectionwerereportedtotheBrazilianMinistryofHealth,with
66 180 confirmed cases in 1850 cities and 22 of 26 states (in-
cidence rate, 81.2 cases per 100 000 inhabitants).2 It is specu-
lated that 500 000 to 1.5 million people might have been in-
fected with ZIKV in Brazil since the beginning of the outbreak.3
The first cases of mosquito-transmitted ZIKV in the United
States were reported in July 2016.4 Despite concomitant in-
creases in the incidence of both GBS5 and ZIKV in Brazil, the
links to neurologic complications in adults have been limited
to case series on GBS,6,7 meningoencephalitis,8 transverse
myelitis,9 and ophthalmologic disease.10
We aimed to prospectively evaluate adult patients with
neurologic syndromes consistent with GBS, transverse myeli-
tis, or meningoencephalitis for molecular and serologic evi-
dence of recent ZIKV infection. We also compared radio-
graphic and electrophysiological findings and functional
outcomes between patients positive for ZIKV infection and
thosenegativeforZIKVinfectionwhowereadmittedwitheach
syndrome.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study at a
tertiarycare,academichospital(AntonioPedroUniversityHos-
pital of Universidade Federal Fluminense) in the state of Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil. This hospital specializes in the care of pa-
tients with neuromuscular and neuroinfectious diseases and
receives referrals from the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area.11
This study was approved by the Hospital Universitario Anto-
nio Pedro-Universidade Federal Fluminense institutional re-
view board. All patients or their surrogates provided written
consent to participate in this study.
Consecutive patients who presented between December
5, 2015, and May 10, 2016, were approached for enrollment
(eAppendix in the Supplement for inclusion and exclusion
criteria). Data on demographics, clinical presentation, results
of neurologic examination, hospital course, and 3-month
outcomes were prospectively collected (eAppendix in the
Supplement).12
To assess changes in the incidence of each neurologic syn-
drome, we compared admission rates during a similar period
prior to the outbreak of ZIKV in Brazil (December 5, 2013, to
May 10, 2014). We chose to evaluate admissions during a simi-
lar summer-fall time frame to control for seasonal variations
in mosquito-borne illnesses.
Laboratory Testing
Testing for ZIKV infection followed the algorithm established
bythePanAmericanHealthOrganizationandtheWorldHealth
Organization (WHO).13 First, blood and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) samples collected at admission were tested in dupli-
cate using real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) for ZIKV following published methods.14
All instances of rRT-PCR were performed using the same prim-
ers and cycle times at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation Flavivi-
rus Laboratory, which is the regional flavivirus reference labo-
ratory. All positive and equivocal samples (cycle threshold,
>38-40) were repeated with a second set of primer and probes
for confirmation.
If the results of the rRT-PCR studies were negative, a ZIKV
IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(Zika MAC-ELISA) was performed for both blood and CSF
samples (when adequate CSF samples were available). A ratio
of patient optic density to negative control of greater than 3.0
was considered positive, 2.0 to 3.0 considered indetermi-
nate, and less than 2.0 considered negative for both the se-
rum and CSF samples. If results were positive for ZIKV IgM,
serum dengue IgM for serotypes 1 to 4 was performed to check
for cross-reactivity (negative dengue IgM result defined by op-
ticaldensityratio<9.0;indeterminateresult,9.0-11.0;andposi-
tive result, >11.0). If serum ZIKV and dengue IgM results were
positive, then CSF IgM for dengue virus was tested as well. The
ZIKV in-house MAC-ELISA was performed according to rec-
ommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), with the use of antigens provided by the CDC.
A recent ZIKV infection was diagnosed if serum and/or CSF
ZIKV rRT-PCR results were positive, or if the serum and/or CSF
ZIKV IgM optical density ratio was greater than 3.0 and se-
rum dengue IgM results were negative (optical density ratio,
<9.0). If serum dengue virus IgM results were positive, acute
ZIKV could be diagnosed only if both serum and CSF ZIKV IgM
results were positive and CSF dengue IgM results were nega-
tive. This algorithm incorporating CSF serologic findings is
based on the concept that the IgM pentamer does not cross
the blood-brain barrier owing to its size, and, hence, only
primary intrathecal infection would result in CSF IgM
positivity.15,16 Since December 2016, the CDC no longer rec-
ommends plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) to
rule out cross-reactivity among flaviviruses in countries with
a high prevalence of concurrent flavivirosis owing to its low
Key Points
Question What is the spectrum of neurologic manifestations
in adults with Zika virus infection?
Findings This cohort study evaluated adult patients with
new-onset parainfectious or neuroinflammatory disease for
the presence of acute Zika virus infection in both serum and
cerebrospinal fluid samples using molecular and serological
testing. An increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome
and encephalitis was observed compared with the period before
the outbreak of the Zika virus.
Meaning The Zika virus may be associated with a rapid increase in
the incidence of life-threatening neurologic syndromes; serologic
and molecular testing using blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples
can serve as an alternative diagnostic strategy.

 accuracy in this setting.17 Also, the CDC now considers
MAC-ELISA serologic findings a valid method of ZIKV detec-
tion in CSF.17 Dengue serologic studies were performed using
kits approved by the WHO and the CDC.
Electrophysiological Testing
Electromyography and nerve conduction studies were per-
formedforallpatientswithsuspectedGBSandforpatientswith
other neurologic syndromes as clinically indicated. All stud-
ies were performed by a group of 3 board-certified neurolo-
gists with specialty training in neuromuscular disease using
electrophysiological criteria endorsed by the European Fed-
eration of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society and
the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiag-
nostic Medicine.12,18-22
Diagnostic Definitions
Guillain-Barré syndrome was diagnosed according to interna-
tionalclinical,laboratory,andelectrophysiologicalcriteria.21,22
FollowingWHOrecommendations,theBrightoncriteria12were
appliedtodelineatelevelsofdiagnosticcertaintyforGBS.Clini-
cal subcategories of GBS were diagnosed according to estab-
lished criteria.23 Transverse myelitis, encephalitis, and chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were
diagnosed according to published guidelines.24-26
Statistical Analysis
The 2-sided Fisher exact test was used to compare dichoto-
mous variables, and logistic regression was used to compare
3-month modified Rankin scores between patients who were
positive and patients who were negative for ZIKV infection, ad-
justing for diagnosis type. All analyses were performed using
commercially available SPSS, version 21, statistical software
(SPSS Inc). Significance was set at P < .05.
Results
A total of 40 patients were enrolled during the 5.2-month
enrollment period (Table 1). The median age was 44 years
(range, 22-72 years), and 15 (38%) were women. Figure 1
shows a flowchart of case enrollments. All patients lived in
the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area (which includes the cit-
ies of Rio de Janeiro, Niteroi, and Sao Gonçalo, which are all
within a 16-km [10-mile] radius). Overall, 29 patients were
diagnosed with GBS (90% Brighton level 1 certainty), 7 with
encephalitis, 3 with transverse myelitis, and 1 with new-
onset CIDP (Table 1). Of the patients with GBS or CIDP, 24 of
30 (80%) underwent electromyography in addition to nerve
conduction studies; the median time between onset of neu-
rologic symptoms and undergoing electromyography and
nerve conduction studies was 18 days (range, 10-35 days).
Compared with a seasonally similar time frame prior to the
first documented ZIKV index case in Brazil (December 5,
2013, to May 10, 2014; eTable 1 in the Supplement), admis-
sions to our institution for GBS, transverse myelitis, and
encephalitis increased 4-fold. Admissions for GBS increased
from a mean of 1.0 per month to 5.6 per month, admissions
for encephalitis increased from 0.4 per month to 1.4 per
month, and admissions for transverse myelitis remained
constant at 0.6 per month.
Evidence of acute ZIKV infection was found in 35 pa-
tients (88%), and the median time from onset of viral symp-
toms to testing for ZIKV was 14 days (range, 2-32 days). Re-

 sults of ZIKV rRT-PCR were positive for 3 patients. Of these,
resultsofserumZIKVrRT-PCRwerepositivefor2patientswith
encephalitis and 1 patient with GBS; the median time from vi-
ral symptoms to testing for these patients was 6 days (range,
4-7 days). Results of CSF ZIKV rRT-PCR were positive for 2 pa-
tients (1 patient with encephalitis who also tested positive by
serum rRT-PCR and 1 patient with GBS who tested negative by
serum rRT-PCR); the median time from viral symptoms to test-
ing was 12 days (range, 6-18 days). Results of serum and CSF
ZIKV IgM were both positive for 29 of the 35 patients with ZIKV
infection (83%), and 4 patients (11%) had positive results only
for serum ZIKV IgM (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Cerebrospi-
nal fluid ZIKV IgM was not tested in 3 patients owing to insuf-
ficient quantities of CSF; however, no patient had positive CSF
ZIKV IgM results or negative serum ZIKV IgM results. Among
patientswhohadbothserumandCSFZIKVIgMtested,theme-
dian CSF IgM optic density ratio was higher than that for se-
rum (5.0 vs 4.7; P < .001). All patients underwent serum den-
gue IgM testing. Two patients with classic demyelinating GBS
had positive results for serum dengue IgM; however, both pa-
tients had positive ZIKV IgM results in both serum and CSF
samples and had negative dengue IgM results in CSF samples.
No patient’
s condition was diagnosed based on serum or CSF
ZIKV IgM results alone, without negative serum and/or CSF
dengue virus IgM results. All patients had negative results for
human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2, and results of infec-
tious and inflammatory studies were negative for other etio-
logic causes of disease.
FivepatientstestednegativeforZIKV,including2withclas-
sic demyelinating GBS (1 following a yellow fever vaccine),
2 with encephalitis associated with chikungunya virus infec-
tion, and 1 with idiopathic transverse myelitis. No patient in
the study had a history of yellow fever, Japanese B encepha-
litis, or West Nile virus (none of which are endemic in the study
area) and only the aforementioned patient with GBS who
was negative for ZIKV infection had a history of flavivirus
vaccination.
Among the 35 patients positive for ZIKV infection, a viral
prodrome occurred in 32 patient (91%), compared with 2 of the
5patientsnegativeforZIKVinfection(40%),withthemostcom-
monsymptomsbeingfeverandrash(P = .02;Table2).Theme-
diantimefromviralsymptomstoonsetofneurologicsymptoms
was 10 days (range, 2-22 days), but the time varied based on di-
agnosis (Table 2). Although fever and rash were significantly
more common among patients who were positive for ZIKV in-
fection(fever,31of35patients;andrash,30of35patients)com-
paredwithpatientsnegativeforZIKVinfection(fever,2of5pa-
tients;andrash,0of5patients),andthepositivepredictivevalue
of these symptoms alone or in combination ranged from 94%
to 100%, the negative predictive values were low (43%-50%).
Three patients with GBS without a viral prodrome had positive
results for ZIKV IgM in their serum and/or CSF samples. Of the
27patientswithGBSwhowerepositiveforZIKVinfection,clas-
sicacuteinflammatorydemyelinatingpolyneuropathywasthe
most common type in 15 patients (56%); however, axonal vari-
antswerediagnosedfor8patients(30%;Table3).18,23Although
24patientswithGBSwhowerepositiveforZIKVinfection(89%)
met Brighton level 1 diagnostic certainty, 3 patients diagnosed
with the acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy variant
ofGBS(basedonresultsofexaminationandelectromyography
and nerve conduction studies and with normal magnetic reso-
nance imaging [MRI] findings) had increased reflexes, which
precludes Brighton level diagnostic certainty but has been de-
scribedintheliterature.27Inadditiontothe27patientswithGBS
who were positive for ZIKV infection, 3 of 5 patients with en-
cephalitis who were positive for ZIKV infection also had find-
ings from electromyography and nerve conduction studies
suggestiveofacuteneuromusculardisease(1withacuteinflam-
matory demyelinating polyneuropathy, 1 with acute motor
axonal neuropathy, and 1 with lower motor neuron disease;
Figure2A),andnonemetBickerstaffencephalitiscriteria.23One
patient was diagnosed with CIDP 8 weeks after initial presen-
tation, when he had recurrent symptoms and underwent re-
peated electrophysiological studies consistent with published
CIDP criteria.26,28 One of the 7 patients initially diagnosed with
encephalitis was later found to have primary central nervous
system (CNS) lymphoma by brain biopsy (diffuse, large B cell).
This 26-year-old patient was positive for ZIKV IgM in both the
serum and CSF samples (optic density ratios of 8.8 and 12.5, re-
spectively) and was negative for human immunodeficiency vi-
rusandEpstein-Barrvirus.HisserumandCSFZIKVPCRresults
were both negative; however, the very elevated CSF and serum
ZIKV IgM optic density ratios are consistent with primary CNS
ZIKV infection. Cranial nerve, cauda equina, and/or nerve root
enhancement on results of MRI was only observed among pa-
tientswithGBSwhowerepositiveforZIKVinfection(4of21who
underwentMRI[19%]),whilenoneofthepatientswithGBSwho
were negative for ZIKV exhibited this enhancement on MRI
scans (Figure 2B and C).
Of the 35 patients positive for ZIKV infection, 9 (26%) re-
quired admission to the intensive care unit and 5 (14%) re-
quired mechanical ventilation (Table 2). At 3 months, 2 pa-
tients positive for ZIKV infection (1 with encephalitis and 1 with
GBS) and 1 patient with GBS who was negative for ZIKV infec-
tion died. The patient with ZIKV and encephalitis experi-
enced catastrophic cerebral edema and brainstem herniation
and was placed on palliative care, and the 2 patients with GBS
died of complications secondary to hospital-associated pneu-
monia. The median 3-month modified Rankin scale score was
2 (range, 0-5) among surviving patients who were positive for
ZIKV infection and 0 (range, 0-1) among surviving patients
negative for ZIKV infection (P = .05 after adjusting for diag-
nosis type). At 3 months, 19 of the 27 patients with GBS (70%)
were ambulatory, with 17 (63%) able to walk without assis-
tance. Chronic pain was reported in 18 of the 35 patients who
were positive for ZIKV infection.
Discussion
This is the first prospective study, to our knowledge, that en-
rolled consecutive hospitalized adult patients with new-
onset acute neuroinflammatory disease and evaluated them
for the presence of acute ZIKV infection in both serum and CSF
samples using molecular and serologic testing. We observed
a trend for an increase in the incidence of hospital admis-

 sions for acute neurologic syndromes including GBS, encepha-
litis, and transverse myelitis compared with the pre-ZIKV era
in Brazil, and 88% of these patients (35 of 40) tested positive
for recent ZIKV infection (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
One strength of our study is the concomitant testing of
ZIKV in serum and CSF samples. The fact that IgM serologic
findingswerepositiveintheCSFsamplesofmanypatientssug-
gestsrecentintrathecalantibodysynthesisanddirectZIKVCNS
penetration because the IgM pentamer is considered too large
to cross the blood-brain barrier.16 The ZIKV IgM levels were sig-
nificantly higher in the CSF samples than in the serum samples
in this cohort. The detection of ZIKV by rRT-PCR in the CSF
samples of 2 patients further supports this assertion. The low
overall rates of ZIKV rRT-PCR positivity in our study are likely
because ZIKV rRT-PCR remains positive in the CSF and blood
for around 5 to 7 days29 and most of our patients developed
neurologic complications after the first week of viral pro-
drome. There is currently literature suggesting that rRT-PCR
for ZIKV can remain positive for 2 to 4 weeks in the urine7,29;
however, we did not test urine samples.
Diagnosing acute ZIKV infection is complicated in
regions with endemic dengue virus because cross-reactivity
among flavivirus serologic findings is known to occur.30
Although 2 patients in this cohort tested positive for dengue
IgM in the serum samples, neither had detectable dengue
IgM in the CSF samples and both had positive results for
ZIKV IgM in the serum and CSF samples. Although virus-
specific neutralizing antibody testing using PRNT has been
suggested as a more definitive tool to distinguish between
flaviviruses,31 this testing is expensive and requires cell cul-
ture and specialized, experienced laboratories because no
commercial kit is available. There is, additionally, significant
cross-reactivity among flaviviruses with PRNT, and ZIKV
titers must be 4-fold higher than titers of any other flavivirus
to be considered indicative of ZIKV infection.13 Since Decem-
ber 2016, the CDC no longer recommends PRNT to rule out
cross-reactivity among flaviviruses in countries with a high
prevalence of concurrent flavivirosis owing to its low accu-
racy in this setting.17 We believe that our method of match-
ing CSF and blood serologic findings offers a substantial aid
to minimize cross-reactivity in countries with a high preva-
lence of other concurrent flavivirosis. Also, the WHO consid-
ers that evidence of recent exposure to ZIKV can be inferred
in patients with positive IgM serologic findings for ZIKV,
with negative IgM serologic findings for dengue and chikun-
gunya in the midst of a ZIKV outbreak, and with symptoms
highly suggestive of ZIKV.13 Recently, a study from Brazil
using serum and CSF samples of neonates with ZIKV infec-
tion has shown a 100% correlation between positive IgM in
the CSF samples and PRNT.32 A major limitation of another
cohort study in French Polynesia of ZIKV in patients with
GBS was that 95% of the patients with GBS tested positive

 for serum dengue IgG and 19% of the patients with GBS
tested positive for dengue IgM.6 Although all patients had
PRNT-neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV, only 1 patient had
titers 4 or more times higher than dengue titers, making it
impossible to eliminate the possibility of cross-reactivity.
This study did not evaluate CSF. Another cohort study of
ZIKV-associated GBS in Colombia was only able to defini-
tively diagnose both ZIKV infection and GBS (by Brighton
level 1 criteria12) in 14 of 68 patients (21%) initially
examined.7,33 Although others have detected ZIKV in the
CSF using rRT-PCR7,9,34,35 and MAC-ELISA,7,36 our study is
the first, to our knowledge, to use a paradigm of simultane-
ously testing CSF ZIKV and dengue IgM to exclude flavivirus
cross-reactivity.
Another novel aspect of this study is the identification of
certain unusual neurologic features among patients positive
for ZIKV infection. Among those with GBS, cranial nerve
involvement occurred in 13 of 27 patients (48%), and 3 of 27
patients (11%) had facial numbness and/or dysphagia. Cra-
nial nerve enhancement was observed on MRI scans of 4 of
19 patients. In large studies of non-ZIKV–associated GBS, cra-
nial nerve abnormalities have been described in 36% of
patients,21 and cranial nerve enhancement has primarily
been described in children with GBS.37 Although others have
described the acute motor axonal neuropathy variant of GBS
among patients with ZIKV,6 we found a variety of GBS sub-
types including acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneu-
ropathy, acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute motor and
sensory axonal neuropathy, and a Miller Fisher syndrome
variant. Three patients diagnosed with acute motor and sen-
sory axonal neuropathy had brisk reflexes in weak limbs.
Hyperreflexia has been reported in up to 10% of patients
with GBS,27 and some reports have suggested that axonal
variants of GBS more commonly have preserved reflexes.21
Among patients with encephalitis who are positive for ZIKV
infection, 2 of 4 individuals had concomitant acute neuro-
muscular findings, which have also been described in other
flavivirus-associated encephalitis cases (West-Nile virus38
and Japanese B encephalitis39) but has not been described
before with ZIKV. Finally, 1 patient who was initially diag-
nosed with encephalitis was found to have primary CNS
lymphoma after brain biopsy. Primary CNS lymphoma has
been linked to both human immunodeficiency virus and
Epstein-Barr virus, and it has been hypothesized that the
neoplastic transformation of B cells may occur in the context
of inflammatory or infectious disease.40 Although the CNS
ZIKV infection preceding the primary diagnosis of CNS lym-
phoma may represent a coincidence, we thought it impor-
tant to include this patient in light of the known association
of viruses and primary CNS lymphoma. The rates of admis-
sions to the intensive care unit, disability at 3 months, and
mortality did not differ substantially in our cohort compared
with other published cohorts of ZIKV-associated GBS from
Colombia7 and French Polynesia.6 In addition, our outcomes
were similar to those observed in a large cohort of patients
from Europe with GBS secondary to other causes.21 How-
ever, our cohort had lower rates of mechanical ventilation.
Limitations
Thelimitationsofthisstudybearmentioning.Weselectedneu-
rologic syndromes that we hypothesized had a higher likeli-
hood of being associated with ZIKV because they are histori-
cally associated with other viruses. The study time period
included only 5 months (during the summer season) when
transmission of ZIKV by mosquitoes is more pronounced;
therefore, annual incidence rates of ZIKV-associated neuro-
logic complications may be lower when factoring in winter
months. In addition, this study was limited to a single, ter-
tiary neurologic referral center in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
It is possible that heightened awareness of ZIKV led to in-
creased referrals to our center during the study period com-
pared with the historical period. Finally, we have not per-
formedneutralizingantibodyPRNT,butourprotocoloftesting
CSF and serum samples for ZIKV and dengue may be a more
accurate, affordable, and reproducible approach in most ZIKV-
and dengue-endemic countries.
Conclusions
In this single-center Brazilian cohort, ZIKV appeared to be as-
sociated with an increase in the incidence of a diverse spec-
trum of serious neurologic syndromes among adults. Con-
comitant serum and CSF ZIKV and dengue testing may
constitute a practical algorithm for ZIKV diagnosis in territo-
ries with a high prevalence of flavivirosis.
