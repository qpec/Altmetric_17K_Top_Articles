This study was to examine the influences of manual acupuncture (MA) and electrical heat corresponding to reinforcing methods
on nitric oxide (NO) release over the skin regions in humans. A device with collecting solution was taped to the skin surface
along pericardium (PC) or lung (LU) meridian. Acupuncture needles were gently inserted into PC 4 with reinforcing stimulation
(low force/rate) for 20 minutes in the MA group. LU11 on the finger was heated (43-44‚àòC) by electrical heat for 20 minutes.
Biocapture was consecutively conducted for two 20-minute intervals during and after each treatment. Total nitrite and nitrate
(NOùë•
‚àí) in the collecting samples were quantified using chemiluminescence in blinded fashion. Baseline NOùë•
‚àí levels are higher
and tended to be higher over PC and LU acupoints during the 1st biocapture. NOùë•
‚àí levels over PC regions were consistently
increased by MA during both intervals. NOùë•
‚àí concentrations over LU acupoints were increased and tended to be increased by
electrical heat in the 1st and 2nd biocapture. The results suggest that reinforcing MA and electrical heat induce NO released from
the local skin regions with higher levels at acupoints, which improve local circulation and contribute to the beneficial effects of the
therapies.
1. Introduction
Manual acupuncture (MA) is traditionally used to treat
many symptoms and diseases. Recent clinical trials reported
reduced chronic pain associated with acupuncture and sham
compared to nontreatment [1‚Äì3]. Interest in thermotherapy
to treat diseases increased over the last few decades [4‚Äì
6]. Several reports have demonstrated that acupuncture and
heating cause multiple biological responses in both animals
and humans [5‚Äì9]. These responses can occur locally at or
close to the site of stimulation, or at a distance that is mediated
mainly by the neuroendocrine system [1‚Äì3, 7‚Äì9]. However,
the effects, biochemical changes, and mechanism responsible
for the beneficial effects induced by the therapies are still
unclear.
Acupuncture points (acupoints) are located along merid-
ian lines (channels and collaterals, the jingluo) on the body
surface, described in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM);
and acupuncture comprises a family of procedures involving
various techniques [10, 11]. Heat is considered as a reinforce-
ment method and commonly used to treat a wide spectrum
of syndromes associated with yang deficiency (sensation of
coldness) [7‚Äì9, 11]. A reinforcement MA method involves
slowly twisting/rotating the needle with gentle force/small
amplitude [10‚Äì12]. Anatomical studies have identified that
most acupoints are located intimately at the distribution of
nerve fibers/trunks and blood vessels as well as the hair fol-
licles and sweat glands are enhanced over acupoints [13‚Äì15].
Although acupuncture carries a long history, the biological
effects behind the therapies are unclear. Particularly, the lack

Nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in the genera-
tion of vascular relaxation and can be produced enzymati-
cally by three nitric oxide synthases and nonenzymatically
through the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway in human skin [16‚Äì
18]. Our previous studies demonstrated that NO synthase
protein levels and NO contents are increased in skin tissue
containing acupoints/meridian lines in rats [19‚Äì21]. Recent
studies demonstrated that low-frequency electroacupuncture
induces significant NO release following dermal microdial-
ysis in the acupoint [22], and NO contributes to cuta-
neous vasodilation induced by acupuncture stimulation [23].
Repeated thermal therapy increases immunoreactivity and
expression of endothelial NO synthase in the aortas of ham-
sters [24, 25], and NO level is increased in blood after warm
needling in humans [26]. NO, with a half-life of a few seconds,
rapidly oxidizes into nitrite and nitrate, and measurements of
these stable metabolites adequately indicate changes in NO
activity and production in tissues [27, 28]. Investigators have
developed an NO-scavenging compound, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-
tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), for use in
biological systems [29, 30]. Our recent studies demonstrated,
using a PTIO-infused biocapture device, that total nitrite and
nitrate (NOùë•
‚àí) are increased over acupoints compared to
meridian lines without acupoint (MWOP) and nonmeridian
control region (NMCR) in humans [31‚Äì33], and this was later
confirmed by another group using an alternative approach
[34].
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of
MA and conductive heat on NO release using the biocapture
method over the human skin surface of acupoints of the
pericardium (PC) and lung (LU) meridians, compared to
their corresponding MWOP and NMCR. Local NO release
profile over the skin regions from MA with low stimulating
rate/force was compared to conductive heat in humans.
2. Methods
2.1. Human Subjects. Twenty-five men and women (18‚Äì60
years old) recruited at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center volun-
teered for the studies (Table 1). Some subjects participated in
more than one protocol in a randomized, blind, and non-
crossover fashion. All subjects were healthy, normotensive,
nonsmokers without major surgery in the past 12 months or
history of cardiovascular disease. Subjects with dermatologi-
cal problems, allergic diseases, vascular disorders, infectious
diseases, and prescribed medication were excluded from
study. The protocol was approved by the John F. Wolf, MD
Human Subjects Committee of the Los Angeles Biomedical
Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, and all
experiments were performed in accordance with relevant
guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained
from all subjects. Experiments were performed in a quiet, air-
conditioned room with temperature maintained at 25‚Äì27‚àòC.
2.2. Identification of Acupoints, Instrumentation, and Bio-
capture over Skin. Acupoints, MWOP, and NMCR over PC
and LU meridians were studied in subjects as described in
Figure 1. Locations were identified by an acupoint/meridian
map of the human body [11, 35]. Regions were chosen based
on consistency in identification and sufficient spacing for
NO biocapture tube placement without contacting other
meridians [31‚Äì33]. The biocapture method was described
previously in humans [31‚Äì33]. A biocapture device, developed
by this lab, consists of a semicircular molded plastic tube (0.5
√ó 5 cm) adhered to the acupoints, MWOP, and NMCR by a
double-sided adhesive, as shown in Figure 1. PTIO solution
(100 ùúáM) was injected inside the sterilized tube to absorb NO
from the skin surface for 20 minutes [31, 32]. After incubation,
the liquid was collected from the tubes. Following the 1st
biocapture, the PTIO solution was replaced and collected
after 20 min for the 2nd biocapture [33].
2.3. Manual Acupuncture (MA) and Electrical Heat. Dis-
posable acupuncture needles (0.3 √ó 25 mm) were gently
inserted at 5‚Äì8 mm depth at acupoint PC 4 (Ximen) in MA
groups. PC4 was stimulated by delicately twisting the needles
according to the standard reinforcement technique for 2
minutes or until a sensation of moderate ‚Äúde qi‚Äù (feeling of
soreness, numbness, distension, or pain) was achieved. The
needles were manipulated for 2 minutes every 5 minutes for
20 minutes.
For electrical heating, a heating pad constructed from
zigzag folding of a wire within fire-resistant cloth was
connected to a temperature controller and 6‚Äì12-volt battery
to generate conductive heat as described previously [36].
This pad was placed over LU11 (1 √ó 1 cm) and tied with an
elastic band around the finger. A small sensor over the heated
area was connected to a thermocouple thermometer and
temperature controller (Harvard Bioscience Inc., Holliston,
MA). The temperature was controlled at around 43-44‚àòC by
adjusting the distance between the skin and heat source.
2.4. Quantification of NO Metabolites. Total NOùë•
‚àí concen-
tration was measured in the biocapture solution using an
ozone phase chemiluminescence method (NOA280i, GE
Analytical Instruments, Boulder, CO) as described previously
[31‚Äì33]. Briefly, samples are refluxed in the presence of
1.5 mM vanadium (III) chloride in 2 M HCl which quan-
titatively reduces both NO2
‚àí and NO3
‚àí to NO gas. This

Figure 1: Representation of a biocapture device with a semicylindrical molded tube taped to the skin surface over meridians. The pericardium
(PC) meridian and lung (LU) meridian lines and related acupuncture points are illustrated on left panel and right panel, respectively. The
region from PC4 to PC6 is defined as acupoint (PC-P, 3 acupoints), the distance between PC3 and PC4 is defined as meridian line without
acupoint (PC-WO), and nonmeridian control is the region close to PC meridian (PC-C). The region overlapping LU7 and LU8 is defined
as acupoint (LU-P, 2 acupoints), the distance between LU6 and LU7 represents meridian line without acupoint (LU-WO), and nonmeridian
control is nonmeridian area adjacent to the meridian (LU-C). LU11 denotes the acupoint in which a heat stimuli or moxibustion was applied,
and a small probe sensor was placed on the surface of the heated area, and the temperature was controlled by a temperature controller. The
device was adhered to the skin surface using a custom double-sided adhesive, and NO-scavenging solution (100 ùúáM PTIO) was injected into
the tubing over the skin surface for 20 min in order to directly absorb NO.
can then be quantified by chemiluminescence detection after
reaction with ozone. The quantitative analysis was based on
the standard curve established by measurements of peak
areas of the standard NaNO2 compound. All samples were
measured in duplicate. The lower limit of detection of this
assay was 0.1 pmol NO.
2.5. Research Protocols. Volunteers were randomly asked to
participate in either MA over PC meridian or heat treatment
over LU meridian. A biocapture device was adhered to both
ventral forearms along acupoints, MWOP, and NMCR, as
shown in Figure 1. MA stimulation was performed at PC
acupoints, and electrical heating was applied at LU acupoint
on a randomly selected arm. Two consecutive biocaptures
of NOùëã
‚àí were performed during and after treatments for
20 minutes each, which include cumulative NO on the
skin surface present in the 1st biocapture and de novo NO
synthesis/release in the 2nd biocapture. The opposing arm
served as control for two consecutive biocaptures at 20 min
each as the baseline NOùë•
‚àí concentration without treatment
over corresponding PC or LU regions [22, 33].
2.6. Statistical Analysis. Results were expressed as mean ¬±
standard error of the mean (SEM) of NOùë•
‚àí concentrations
over the skin surface measured in the biocapture solution
(ùúáM) and efflux rate calculated over the surface area during
20 min (nmol/cm2) along the skin surface in contact with
the solution, respectively. The significance of differences was
determined by three-factor repeated Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA), where the three factors are (1) time intervals, 1st
and 2nd biocapture; (2) three sites, acupoints, MWOP, and
NMCR; and (3) treated side and untreated side. ùëÉ values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline NO Releases over PC Regions. Figure 1 is a
representative example of the defined PC and LU acupoints,
MWOP, and NMCR. A biocapture device was adhered to
the skin surface over the PC regions (left panel) and LU
regions (right panel). The characteristics of the participants
are detailed in Table 1. Baseline NOùë•
‚àí concentrations over
PC regions were examined in 12 healthy volunteers for 2
consecutive biocaptures, 20 min each. A two-way ANOVA
revealed that NOùë•
‚àí concentrations biocaptured during the
1st interval over PC acupoints, MWOP, and NMCR were
markedly and consistently higher than the 2nd biocapture
(ùëÉ < 0.05, Figure 2). There is a significant difference among
PC acupoints, MWOP, and NMCR (ùêπ8,48 = 10.5, ùëÉ < 0.01).
NOùë•
‚àí concentration over PC acupoints was higher than
those over MWOP and NMCR in the 1st biocapture (ùëÉ <
0.05).
3.2. Effects of MA on NO Releases over PC Regions. NOùëã
‚àí
concentrations following MA of PC4 were examined over PC
regions in 12 healthy volunteers (Figure 2). ANOVA analysis
of NOùë•
‚àí concentrations biocaptured during the 1st interval
over PC regions in response to MA suggests a significant
elevation of NO metabolites compared to control (ùêπ1,11 = 14.7,
ùëÉ < 0.01). NOùëã
‚àí concentration biocaptured during MA was
increased over PC acupoints and NMCR compared to the
control side (ùëÉ < 0.01) (Figure 2, left).
Figure 2, right panels, shows NOùëã
‚àí concentrations in
the 2nd biocapture at 20 min after MA compared to baseline
control over PC acupoints, MWOP, and NMCR. A two-
way ANOVA revealed significant differences in NOùë•
‚àí con-
centrations between MA and nonstimulated sides over PC
regions (ùêπ2,22 = 4.0, ùëÉ = 0.03). In the 2nd biocapture after
MA, NOùëã
‚àí concentration was markedly increased over PC
acupoints compared to control (ùëÉ < 0.01). NOùëã
‚àí level over
PC acupoints after MA during the 2nd biocapture almost
achieved the level of the 1st biocapture. At 20 min after MA,
NOùëã
‚àí concentration was also significantly increased over
NMCR compared to control (ùëÉ < 0.05). NOùëã
‚àí level over
MWOP suggested an elevation after MA but did not attain
statistical significance (Figure 2, right panels).

were not significant. Following heat stimulation, an overall

4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine two consecutive
biocaptures of NOùëã
‚àí over the skin surface of acupoints,
MWOP, and NMCR along PC and LU meridians. The
influences of MA with low stimulating rate/force on NO
releases over the skin regions were compared to electrical
heat in humans. The major new findings of these studies
are as follows: (1) Baseline NOùë•
‚àí levels are higher over PC
acupoints than MWOP and NMCR during the 1st biocapture
and markedly reduced over all PC and LU regions during
the 2nd consecutive biocapture; (2) baseline NOùë•
‚àí levels
tended to be higher over LU acupoints than MWOP and
NMCR during the 1st biocapture; the values are signifi-
cantly higher following heating over LU acupoints compared
to MWOP and NMCR; (3) NOùëã
‚àí levels are moderately
elevated during MA over the 1st biocapture and markedly
increased after MA over the 2nd consecutive biocapture;
and (4) NOùë•
‚àí levels were increased over LU acupoints and
MWOP regions with a higher elevating level over acupoints
following heating during the 1st biocapture. This is the first
evidence showing that NO is released/generated from the
human skin surface with a higher level over acupoints by
the reinforcing methods using electrical heat. MA with low
rate/force-like reinforcement methods also increases local
NO release over skin regions. NO contents biocaptured
during the 1st interval, containing cumulative NO over
PC and LU skin regions, are almost twofold higher than
the subsequent biocapture, which mainly comprises newly
generated NO. These results are consistent with our pre-
vious data, which reported that NO contents biocaptured
during the 1st interval over PC regions are almost twofold
higher than subsequent biocaptures, which suggest that both
cumulative NO and newly generated NO exist on the skin
surface [32]. NO contents during the subsequent biocaptures
are reduced since the cumulative NO that mainly comes
from nonenzymatic NO generation over skin surface was
already removed by the 1st biocapture. The results demon-
strate that cumulative NO and newly generated NO exist
on the skin surface with higher levels over PC and LU
acupoints especially following the treatments with reinforce-
ment techniques. Enhanced NO over the 2nd biocapture
at 20 min after ceasing treatments suggests de novo NO
production-induced by the therapies, with a higher level over
acupoints.
Based on TCM, reinforcement results in local feeling
of warmness, but reduction causes local feeling of cold-
ness. The findings presented suggest that NO levels bio-
captured over the PC and LU acupoints are consistently
increased by reinforcement methods, heating stimulation.
MA by twisting/rotating the needle with gentle amplitude
and moderate speed also elevates NO release predominantly
over PC acupoints, which are similar to electrical heat. In
contrast, NO levels over the ventral forearm skin regions
are moderately reduced by the high frequency and force
of EA stimulation (data not shown). The reinforcement
methods induced elevations of vasodilator (NO) release over
skin can increase local blood flow/microcirculation, which
contribute to local warmness and their therapeutic effects.
The precise mechanisms of the elevation of NO release
affected by the stimulations applied are still unclear. A
more sophisticated approach would be required to address
this issue. Despite these limitations, our findings would
be consistent with MA with low rate/force and electrical
heat-induced elevations of NO release over PC and LU
regions with a high level at acupoints and demonstrate
a consistent response to NO release during reinforcement
methods.
Recently, a large meta-analysis of patient-level acupunc-
ture data for the treatment of chronic pain conditions has
demonstrated that the effects of verum acupuncture on
pain improvement have statistically significant, but small,
differences compared to sham acupuncture procedures [1‚Äì
3]. A number of acupuncture clinical trial projects mainly
conducted by conventional scientists have generated many
negative results. These have puzzled the acupuncture com-
munity, and published papers questioned whether the correct
proposed acupuncture methods such as reinforcement and
reduction were used in the trials [37]. Our results suggest
that utilizing the appropriate parameters for an investigated
technique and monitoring the quantitative response to the
treatments are worth considering in acupuncture clinical
trials. Moreover, the present data shows that cumulative
NO is higher over acupoints at physiological level and
stimulus-evoked NO release is also with a higher level at
acupoints. Whether the effect of acupoint stimulation has
better local effect than nonacupoint stimulation or how to
select stimulating force/speed for specific diseases/symptoms
requires investigation.
The mechanism responsible for an increase in NO
release over acupoints by reinforcement methods is unclear.
NO can be produced enzymatically by three NO syn-
thases [16‚Äì18] and can also be produced nonenzymati-
cally through the bacteria reduction pathway in human
skin [31]. Present studies show that NOùëã
‚àí concentrations
over PC and LU acupoints are higher and tend to be
higher than those in MWOP and NMCR in the physi-
ological baseline level during the 1st biocapture but not
in the 2nd biocapture. During MA and conductive heat
treatments, NOùëã
‚àí levels are elevated and higher over acu-
points compared to their corresponding MWOP and NMCR
 6

during both biocaptures. Cutaneous vasodilation induced
by acupuncture stimulation in the forearms of humans is
attenuated by application of NO synthesis inhibitor, which
suggest involvement of L-arginine-derived NO synthesis
[23]. The present results support that MA and conductive
heat-induced NO generation/release may be through L-
arginine-derived NO synthesis, since cumulative NO that
mainly comes from bacteria-mediated nonenzymatic NO
generation was removed by the 1st biocapture. Elevation
of NO in acupoints could be achieved through activation
of endothelial and/or neuronal NO synthase. In addition,
these treatments-induced de novo NO generation/release
predominantly over acupoints agree with previous studies
reporting that tissue NO synthase level is higher in acupoints
[19‚Äì21] and suggest that acupoints exist in higher levels
of L-arginine-derived NO synthesis and nonenzymatic NO
generation.
Several reports have demonstrated that MA and heating
cause multiple biological responses in both animals and
humans [7‚Äì10, 38, 39]. These responses can occur locally
at or close to the site of the stimulation, or at a distance
that is mediated mainly by the neuroendocrine system. In
addition, acupuncture stimulation of the acupoint or the
areas located on the ground of the pressure pain sensi-
tive site (Ashi-point) has been often used for treatment
of pain-related syndromes and soft-tissue damage [10, 11,
13]. Acupuncture essentially improves local circulation and
allows for a flush of analgesic or sensitizing substances,
leading to pain relief [38, 40‚Äì42]. Acupuncture-like stim-
ulation affects regional blood flow in skin, muscle, and
various organs [43] and produces reflex responses of various
visceral functions [44]. Our results from MA and con-
ductive heat studies consistently suggest that NO release
at acupoints is induced by the therapies. Enhanced NO
improves local microcirculation and removes pathological
sensitizing substances. All of these contribute to biochem-
ical/physiological improvement and beneficial effects of the
therapies.
In summary, our findings from consecutive biocaptures
suggest that the NO levels biocaptured during the 1st interval
over PC and LU skin regions are almost twofold higher
compared to the subsequent biocapture. Conductive heat
and MA with low force/rate-like reinforcement method
produce elevations of both accumulative and de novo NO
release over local skin regions with a high level at acupoints,
which enrich blood vessels and neuronal components that
may contribute to NO generation. In conclusion, these
reinforcement methods induce an elevation of vasodilator
(NO) release over skin regions predominantly at acupoints,
and elevated NO improves local circulation and allows
for a flush of analgesic or sensitizing substances, which
contribute to local warmness and beneficial effects of the
therapies.
