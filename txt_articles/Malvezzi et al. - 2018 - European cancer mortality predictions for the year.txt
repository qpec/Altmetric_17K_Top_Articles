Background: We projected cancer mortality statistics for 2018 for the European Union (EU) and its six more populous
countries, using the most recent available data. We focused on colorectal cancer.
Materials and methods: We obtained cancer death certification data from stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast,
uterus, ovary, prostate, bladder, leukaemia, and total cancers from the World Health Organisation database and projected
population data from Eurostat. We derived figures for France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the EU in 1970–2012.
We predicted death numbers by age group and age-standardized (world population) rates for 2018 through joinpoint
regression models.
Results: EU total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline by 10.3% in men between 2012 and 2018, reaching a predicted
rate of 128.9/100 000, and by 5.0% in women with a rate of 83.6. The predicted total number of cancer deaths is 1 382 000 when
compared with 1 333 362 in 2012 (þ3.6%). We confirmed a further fall in male lung cancer, but an unfavourable trend in
females, with a rate of 14.7/100 000 for 2018 (13.9 in 2012, þ5.8%) and 94 500 expected deaths, higher than the rate of 13.7 and
92 700 deaths from breast cancer. Colorectal cancer predicted rates are 15.8/100 000 men (�6.7%) and 9.2 in women (�7.5%);
declines are expected in all age groups. Pancreatic cancer is stable in men, but in women it rose þ2.8% since 2012. Ovarian,
uterine and bladder cancer rates are predicted to decline further. In 2018 alone, about 392 300 cancer deaths were avoided
compared with peak rates in the late 1980s.
Conclusion: We predicted continuing falls in mortality rates from major cancer sites in the EU and its major countries to 2018.
Exceptions are pancreatic cancer and lung cancer in women. Improved treatment and—above age 50 years—organized
screening may account for recent favourable colorectal cancer trends.

Introduction
Since 2011, we have published current year estimates for cancer
mortality statistics based on recent data [1–3]. In this work, we
present statistics for 2018 for the European Union (EU) and its
six most populous countries, for the most common sites of cancer
death plus all cancers combined. We also added bladder and
ovarian cancer due to the high number of deaths in the EU [4, 5].
Since reports from outside the EU found increasing trends of
colorectal cancer incidence/mortality below age 50 years, in con-
trast to the favourable trends at older ages [6], a specific focus was
devoted to analysing colorectal cancer mortality by age group.
Materials and methods
We obtained official death certification data from the WHO databases
(WHOSIS) [7] for cancers of the stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung,
breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, bladder, leukaemia, and total cancer mor-
tality. We retrieved resident population estimates from the same WHO
database, and the Eurostat database [8]. We obtained figures from 1970
to 2012 for the EU (28 member states; data for Cyprus were missing) and
up to the most recent available year for the six largest European countries:
France (2013), Germany (2014), Italy (2012), Poland (2014), Spain
(2014), and the UK (2013).
Cancer deaths were recoded according to the tenth ICD Revision
[9]: stomach (C16), colorectal (C17–C21, C26), pancreas (C25), lung

 (C33–C34), breast (C50), uterus (cervix and corpus) (C53–C55), ovary
(C56), prostate (C61), bladder (C67), leukaemia (C91–C95), and total
cancers (C00–D48).
We computed age-specific numbers of deaths and rates for 5-year age
groups (0–4 to 85þ years) and calendar year or quinquennia. We used
the direct method (world standard population) to calculate age-
standardized rates.
We fitted a Poisson count data joinpoint regression model to the loga-
rithm of each 5-year age-specific death number to identify the most recent
trend segment [10]. The model was set to a maximum of six segments (five
joinpoints) and to include at least five data points in the last segment. Age-
standardized rates were also analysed with joinpoint regression models
with up to four trend segments. We estimated predicted age-specific num-
bers of deaths and 95% prediction intervals (PIs) for 2018 by applying a lin-
ear model to the mortality data from each age group over the most recent
trend segment identified by the joinpoint model. We used predicted age-
specific numbers of deaths and the predicted population from Eurostat [8]
to compute the predicted age-specific and age-standardized death rates
(world population) with 95% PIs.
Results
Table 1 shows predicted cancer deaths and age-standardized rates
with 95% PIs for 2018 for the studied neoplasms in the whole EU,
and comparison data for 2012. In men, we predict 765 000 cancer
deaths in 2018, and 617 000 in women, for a total of 1 382 000
deaths, compared with 1 333 362 in 2012, thus increasing by
3.6%. The predicted age-standardized rates for 2018 are 128.9/
100 000 men and 83.6/100 000 women, compared with 143.8/
100 000 men and 88.0/100 000 women in 2012, with falls of
10.3% in men and 5.0% in women.
Figure 1 shows bar plots of age-standardized death rates per
100 000 population for all neoplasms and the 10 considered sites in
2012, and expected rates for 2018 in EU men and women, with
95% PIs. Lung cancer has the highest predicted rates in both sexes,
32.4/100 000 in men and 14.7 in women; however, we registered a
13.0% fall in men since 2012, and a 5.8% rise in women. Expected
deaths in 2018 were 183 100 men and 94500 women (�20% of
total cancer deaths). Colorectal cancer accounts for the second
highest number of deaths for 2018 with 177 400 deaths, with rates
of 15.8/100 000 men and 9.2/100 000 women, declining since 2012
by 6.7% in men and 7.5% in women. Breast cancer has the second
highest predicted rate in women, 13.7/100 000 (92 700 deaths),
with a 9.5% decline since 2012. Prostate cancer has the third high-
est rate in men, 10.1/100 000, and declines by 8.5%. Pancreatic can-
cer shows stable rates in men, 7.9/100 000, but is unfavourable in
women (5.6/100 000 in 2018, þ2.8%). Stomach cancer falls 19.0%
in men and 17.1% in women. Uterine and ovarian cancers display
similar behaviour, with predicted rates around 4.7/100 000, falls
over 6%, and about 30 000 deaths. Bladder cancer rates are 5.1/
100 000 in men (�4.0%; 34 700 deaths) and 1.1/100 000 in women
(�5.0%; 11 100 deaths). Leukaemia represents 3% of total cancer
deaths (14% fall since 2012).
Figure 2 shows cancer mortality rates for EU men and women
in quinquennia from 1970 to 2012, and predicted rates for 2018
with 95% PIs, for all neoplasms (left) and each cancer site for
men (centre) and women (right). In men, the falling rates are
mainly influenced by lung cancer, since the late 1980s, and stom-
ach cancer, which declined over the whole period. In women the
greatest falls were for breast, colorectal and stomach cancer, while
lung cancer steadily increased. Pancreatic cancer shows a steady

 rise for women, while in men rates are predicted to remain stable,
after earlier rises. Male bladder cancer showed unfavourable
trends up to the early 1990s, to then fall and reach a plateau. In
women, rates were stable. Uterine cancer displays strong
declining trends since the 1970s, which recently slowed down.
Ovarian cancer declined since the early 1990s. Further details on
country-specific data and analyses can be found in the
supplementary Appendix, available at Annals of Oncology online
(supplementary Tables S1–S9 and Figures S1 and S2, available at
Annals of Oncology online). In general, they show earlier and
larger declines in Western Europe, and a tendency towards a lev-
elling of rates across the EU.

 Figure 3 shows colorectal cancer quinquennial age-standardized
rates from 1970 to 2012 for men and women for the six studied
countries and the EU, and predicted rates for 2018 with 95% PIs.
In men, trends were favourable for the last two decades, except for
Poland and Spain. Poland had an increasing trend up to 2002, to
then reach a plateau. In 2018 Poland (20/100 000 men) and Spain
(18.1/100 000) display the highest rates. The pattern of trends was
similar in women, with, however, lower rates.

 Table 2 shows age-standardized mortality rates for colorectal
cancer for the six countries in 2005–2009 and 2012, and the pre-
dicted rates for 2018 with 95% PIs. Rates for all ages and truncated
for 30–49, 50–69, and 70þ years age groups for the EU are also pre-
sented. All trends were favourable. In men, France, Germany and
the UK showed the greatest declines between 2012 and 2018
(14%), while Poland the lowest one. In women the greatest decline
is registered for Germany and the lowest one in the UK.
Figure 4 displays joinpoint analysis of colorectal cancer age-
standardized mortality rates for the EU, in both sexes and differ-
ent age groups, along with predictions for 2018 and 95% PIs.
Except for age 30–49 years, male rates rose up to the mid-1990s,
thereafter trends decrease appreciably. Women in all age groups
and men aged 30–49 display steady downward patterns, with fa-
vourable predicted trends.
Figure 5 shows the estimated number of avoided cancer deaths
for the EU from 1989 (light grey area, green online) due to the de-
clines in rates since 1990. We predict 392 000 avoided deaths in 2018
alone (275000 men and 117000 women) and a total of 4 930000
(3288 000 in men and 1642000 in women) over the whole period.
Discussion
The steady declines in overall cancer mortality rates in the EU in
both sexes are predicted to continue up to 2018, with male rates
falling 10.3% and 5.0% in women since 2012. Unlike the United
States [11], cancer death numbers are increasing slightly, mainly
due to population aging. Mortality from major cancer sites is
decreasing, including stomach, colorectum, bladder and leukae-
mia in both sexes, prostate and lung in men; and breast, uterus
(cervix and corpus), and ovary in women. Conversely, lung can-
cer rates in women are increasing, and pancreas mortality rates
are predicted to level off.
Interpretation of the prediction models’ results needs caution.
We updated aggregate mortality data for the EU, and minor
inconsistencies with previous reports are likely. The temporal
length of the projection is also relatively large at 6 years (2012–
2018) and at the limit for short term model reliability. The large
populations under analysis should protect from random vari-
ation, but very recent changes in trends, as well as cohort-like ef-
fects are difficult to detect for this model. In addition, predictions
are less valid for rarer cancers, such as stomach [12].
Colorectal cancer
In the EU, colorectal cancer mortality has been declining since
1993 in men, and over the whole period in women. However, in-
dividual countries followed different trajectories. In the early
1970s there was an over twofold variation between high and low
rates. Rates progressively converged up to the early 2000s (12%
variation in men and 16% in women). Thereafter trends
diverged, particularly in men, with a reversal in country rankings

 compared with the 1970s. The convergence of rates has been
attributed to homogenization of diet and lifestyles across the EU
[4, 13]. Migrant studies showed that colorectal cancer mortality
tends to change faster than for other cancers following lifestyle
and diet modification [14]. The subsequent divergence is difficult
to explain. Identified risk factors for colorectal cancer include al-
cohol and tobacco, obesity and diabetes, sedentariness, and un-
healthy dietary patterns [15]. Oral contraceptive (OC) and
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use may have decreased
risk in women, partly explaining sex differences. The increased
use of aspirin, mainly for cardiovascular disease prevention, likely
reduces colorectal cancer incidence [16]. Substantial progresses
in management and treatment of colorectal cancer have taken
place. Screening is very effective in reducing colorectal cancer
mortality and incidence [17].
Trends in risk factor exposure differed within Europe, with de-
clines in tobacco and alcohol consumption in men and increased
prevalence of obesity, diabetes and sedentariness in several coun-
tries. OC and, until the early 2000s, HRT use increased. Differential
access to effective treatment across Europe can also play a role [18,
19]. Since the early 2000s several European countries have intro-
duced organized screening above 50 years of age [20], and differen-
tial implementation and uptake may influence recent trends.
Since the early 2000s, incidence and/or mortality trends in
the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway have been
decreasing above 50 years of age, but increasing below [6].
Increases in obesity, sedentariness and other unfavourable life-
style habits, not counterbalanced by screening, may explain rises
in early onset colorectal cancer. In the EU, mortality below age
50 years is not increasing, but rates levelled off since 2008 in
both sexes.
Bladder cancer
There is an over fourfold difference between male and female
bladder cancer mortality rates. More frequent exposure in men to
the two major established risk factors [21, 22], i.e. tobacco and
occupational exposure to aromatic amines and other bladder car-
cinogens, can partly explain the wide gender gap. Bladder cancer
incidence rates are highly influenced by changes in classification,
coding, and registration, but these are unlikely to affect mortality
rates and criteria for death certification did not change appre-
ciably over the considered period [4]. Temporal trends in expos-
ure to tobacco and occupational carcinogens can largely account
for bladder cancer mortality trends in EU men. The role of other
risk factors remains undefined [22]. There are similarities in mor-
tality trends from lung and bladder cancers, confirming the im-
portant role played by tobacco in bladder cancer burden. Since
2008, however, trends have become less favourable in men, con-
trary to lung cancer.

observed numbers of cancer deaths from 1970 to 2012 and predicted cancer deaths from 2013 to 2018 (black line); estimated numbers of
total cancer deaths by applying 1988 age-specific peak mortality rate (dark grey line). During the 31 years period 4 930 000 cancer deaths
have been avoided (3 288 000 in men and 1 642 000 in women). In 2018 alone are predicted to be avoided 275 000 in men and 117 000 in
women, for a total of 392 000. ASR, age specific rate.

 Ovarian cancer
Since the late 1980s, ovarian cancer mortality has been falling in
the EU, after earlier increases, and a further 6% fall is predicted
between 2012 and 2018. Falls started earlier in the UK and
Germany, who once had the highest rates, and only later into the
2000s in Poland. OC use decreases the risk of ovarian cancer, and
its spread throughout Europe largely accounts for the favourable
trends and the different timing of onset [5]. A detailed analysis
[5] showed that falls were larger in young women, although in
some countries, including the UK and Germany, earlier spread of
OC use resulted in substantial declines in women aged 70–
79 years. Reductions in HRT use, a risk factor for ovarian cancer,
after unfavourable results [23], may also have contributed. The
role of other risk factors is difficult to evaluate, while improve-
ments in management and therapy may have played a minor role,
since European mean 5-year survival was low and no substantial
gains were observed over time [24].
Other cancer sites
Lung cancer mortality mainly reflects different past smoking pat-
terns in the two sexes. Lung cancer is now the leading cause of
cancer deaths in both sexes in the EU. In spite of decreases in
men, the tobacco death toll remains huge, and abating tobacco
consumption remains a priority.
The marked decreases in breast cancer and leukaemia mortality
are largely due to progress in management and treatment [25, 26].
Stomach cancer steadily declined since the 1970s, mostly be-
cause of reduced Helicobacter pylori infection and tobacco smok-
ing, and improvements in food preservation and diet [27].
The decrease in uterine cancer mortality is largely due to the
decreased incidence of cancer of the cervix uteri, due to the
spreading across Europe of effective screening [20].
