Impaired neuronal processes, including dopamine imbalance, are central to the pathogenesis
of major psychosis, but the molecular origins are unclear. Here we perform a multi-omics
study of neurons isolated from the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
(n = 55 cases and 27 controls). DNA methylation, transcriptomic, and genetic-epigenetic
interactions in major psychosis converged on pathways of neurodevelopment, synaptic
activity, and immune functions. We observe prominent hypomethylation of an enhancer
within the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene in major psychosis neurons. Chromatin
conformation analysis revealed that this enhancer targets the nearby tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) gene responsible for dopamine synthesis. In patients, we find hypomethylation of the
IGF2 enhancer is associated with increased TH protein levels. In mice, Igf2 enhancer deletion
disrupts the levels of TH protein and striatal dopamine, and induces transcriptional and
proteomic abnormalities affecting neuronal structure and signaling. Our data suggests that
epigenetic activation of the enhancer at IGF2 may enhance dopamine synthesis associated
with major psychosis.

1234567890():,;
 S
chizophrenia and bipolar disorder are mental disorders
characterized by periods of psychosis, including hallucina-
tions, delusions, and thought disorder. These diseases have
shared genetic features, peri-adolescent onset, and dynamic
clinical symptoms, and affect 100 million people worldwide1.
Psychotic symptoms are thought to be triggered by dopaminergic
dysregulation, as the efficacy of all actively used antipsychotic
drugs involves an attenuation of dopamine transmission, and the
dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has endured as a neuro-
chemical explanation for disease pathogenesis for over 60 years2.
In addition, neurons of patients with psychosis exhibit numerous
transcriptional, structural (decreases in dendritic spine density),
and signaling abnormalities that disrupt cortical circuitry3–7. The
past decade of genomics research has shown that epigenetic
misregulation of the genome can trigger long-lasting changes to
neurodevelopmental programs, synaptic architecture, and cellular
signaling, and thus may increase the risk of psychotic disorders,
such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder5,8–10. In particular,
abnormalities in DNA methylation have been detected in the
brain of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, and their
involvement in disease pathophysiology could explain the clinical
dynamics observed in these diseases11–13. However, DNA
methylation studies of bulk brain tissue are confounded by
sample-level variation in the proportion of different cell types. In
addition, epigenetic changes occurring within neurons can be
masked by the predominant glial signal; there are ~3.6 times
more glia than neurons in the human frontal cortex gray mat-
ter14. Epigenomic profiling in neurons of affected individuals –
rather than blood or cell mixtures – would provide more accurate
data for a model of neuronal dysregulation in disease; to date, no
such data are available.
In this work, we perform a genome-wide comparison of DNA
methylation in isolated neurons from the frontal cortex of indi-
viduals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, to those in
undiagnosed individuals. We report a strong association in an
enhancer located within the IGF2 locus, using an array-based
approach, and by targeted bisulfite deep sequencing. IGF2 has
been previously been found to be differentially methylated in
populations at risk for schizophrenia15, and affects synaptic
plasticity and cognitive functions like learning and memory16–20.
We then use several functional assays, bioinformatics, and mouse
transgenics to provide evidence that the enhancer at IGF2 reg-
ulates the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene; TH is the rate-limiting
enzyme responsible for dopamine synthesis. We also find that
Igf2 enhancer disruption in mice affects levels of TH protein and
dopamine, as well as pathways involved in synaptic signaling and
neuronal structure. This work suggests a mechanism for epige-
netic regulation of dopamine levels in the brain. Epigenetic
misregulation of an enhancer at IGF2 may underlie the dopa-
minergic abnormalities that drives psychotic symptoms. The
epigenetic regulatory connection between IGF2 and TH may also
help explain the co-occurrence of neuronal structure and synaptic
abnormalities with dopamine dysregulation in major psychosis
patients21–23.
Results
DNA methylome abnormalities in psychosis patient neurons.
We fine-mapped DNA methylation in neuronal nuclei (NeuN+)
isolated by flow cytometry from post-mortem frontal cortex of
the brain of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and controls (n = 29, 26, and 27 individuals, respec-
tively; Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Table 1, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). We performed an epigenome-wide association
analysis (EWAS) using Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays
surveying
812,663
CpG
sites
(Fig.
1
and
Supplementary
Figs. 2–4). In this analysis we controlled for age, sex, post-mortem
interval, as well as genetic ancestry, which was determined by
genotyping
the
same
individuals
(Infinium
PsychArray-24
microarrays and imputed genotypes; 228,369 SNPs; n = 82 indi-
viduals; Supplementary Fig. 5). We identified 18 regions with
significant DNA methylation changes in patients with major
psychosis (comb-p Šidák p < 0.05; Fig. 1a; Supplementary Data 2;
Supplementary Fig. 6a). Differentially methylated regions were
enriched in pathways related to embryonic development, synaptic
function, and immune cell activation (q < 0.05; hypergeometric
test; Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 3). We then determined the
consequences of altered DNA methylation in major psychosis by
profiling transcriptomes in a randomly selected subset of the
same samples, by RNA sequencing (n = 17 cases, 17 controls;
Supplementary Data 4, Supplementary Data 5, Supplementary
Data 6, and Supplementary Figs. 6b and 7a), after adjusting for
age, sex, post-mortem interval, and neuronal proportion. Pathway
analysis revealed consistent alterations with those identified in the
DNA methylation analysis, affecting early development, the
innate immune system, and synaptic transmission (Fig. 1b). We
further examined the developmental regulation of genes tran-
scriptionally altered in psychosis, using the BrainSpan dataset.
Pre- and post-natal transcriptional dynamics of genes differen-
tially expressed in psychosis showed a significantly higher cor-
relation with those of synaptic development genes, relative to
randomly-sampled sets (BrainSpan; p < 0.001; resampling, one-
sided test; Supplementary Fig. 7b). Together, these findings sug-
gests that in neurons of major psychosis patients, DNA methy-
lation and transcriptional changes converge to affect early
development, disrupt neurotransmission, and raise immune
responses.
Genetic-epigenetic interactions in major psychosis neurons.
We then identified genetic-epigenetic interactions at the differ-
entially methylated regions in neurons of patients with psychosis.
For this, we examined genotype information from the same
individuals (82 individuals; Infinium PsychArray-24 microarrays)
and imputed genotypes using 1000 Genomes reference panel,
resulting in 228,369 SNPs (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 5). For
each of the differentially-methylated regions, we performed a cis-
meQTL analysis (which involves univariate SNP-CpG regression
to assess the effect of genotype on base-level DNA methylation).
We found that 13 of the 18 differentially methylated regions
demonstrated significant genetic-epigenetic interactions in cis
(q < 0.05; linear regression; 36 of 56 CpG probes within the 18
regions; 2212 of 13,552 SNPs in cis with differentially methylated
probes) (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary Data 7). Additionally, one
differentially methylated region at the HLA locus demonstrated
significant genetic-epigenetic interactions with known genetic risk
factors for schizophrenia24,25 (q < 0.05; linear regression; 4373
risk SNPs tested; Supplementary Data 8). Therefore, neurons of
major psychosis patients show significant changes in DNA
methylation, some of which may be mediated by genetic state.
Hypomethylation of enhancer at IGF2 in psychosis neurons.
Notably, two of the top differentially methylated regions in major
psychosis neurons were located at the 3′ end of the IGF2 gene
(Šidák p < 10−3; Fig. 2a; Supplementary Data 2a). Both schizo-
phrenia and bipolar patients were consistently hypomethylated at
the IGF2 locus, relative to controls (3–9% probe-level hypo-
methylation in cases relative to controls in IGF2 region; Fig. 2b).
Hypomethylation of the IGF2 locus was also observed in an
analysis limited to individuals with genetic European ancestry (13
controls, 20 bipolar disorder, 19 schizophrenia; Šidák p < 2 × 10−4
for IGF2 locus; Supplementary Data 2b). To assess the impact of

 lifestyle-related variables, we repeated probe-level tests for indi-
vidual differentially methylated sites at the IGF2 locus after
controlling for smoking status (ever/never) and reported anti-
psychotic use (some/none), in addition to age, sex, post-mortem
interval, and the first two genetic principal components. The
IGF2 locus remained significantly hypomethylated in neurons of
patients with major psychosis even after accounting for these

in Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, we did not find evidence
of cis-acting genetic-epigenetic effects for any of the probes in the
differentially methylated IGF2 region (q > 0.05; Supplementary
Data 9).
We also confirmed the reliability of the Illumina Methylatio-
nEPIC array findings by fine-mapping DNA methylation at the
IGF2 genomic area (~161 kb) in neurons, using a targeted
bisulfite sequencing assay (n = 13 cases, 13 controls; array

R = 0.67,
p < 10−19; Supplementary Fig. 9). This analysis also defined the
IGF2 site as being a 1.3 kb region with significant hypomethyla-
tion in neurons of major psychosis cases (7.4% hypomethylation
p < 5 × 10−4; nested ANOVA model; effect of disease after
controlling for age, sex, post-mortem interval, and batch effect;
Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 10). In addition, we performed
targeted bisulfite sequencing of the IGF2 enhancer locus in glial
cells (NeuN-) isolated from the same individuals (n = 10 cases, 12
controls). While we observed a similar trend of disease-specific
hypomethylation in glial cells, this effect was not significant (4%
hypomethylation; p = 0.07; nested ANOVA model; Fig. 2c).
To further verify that our effect is not confounded by sex and
ethnicity, we reanalyzed our dataset examining only males of
European genetic ancestry. Significant IGF2 hypomethylation
persisted in three of four tested CpG probes when samples were
limited to males of European genetic ancestry (n = 25 cases, 11
controls; Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.01; nested ANOVA model;
effect of disease after accounting for age, post-mortem interval,
and first two principal components of genetic ancestry; Fig. 2d).
Dopamine synthesis abnormalities linked to enhancer at IGF2.
The hypomethylated IGF2 locus in major psychosis overlapped
an enhancer in the adult frontal cortex (Fig. 2a; data from NIH
Roadmap Epigenomics Project). Assessment of chromatin inter-
actions in the prefrontal cortex by analysis of Hi-C data revealed
that this enhancer targets the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene
promoter (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 10). TH is the rate-limiting
enzyme for the production of the neurotransmitter dopamine.

 patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is centrally
involved in the cognitive and psychotic symptoms of these
diseases26,27. Reduced DNA methylation at the enhancer in IGF2
was associated with elevated levels of TH protein levels in the
human frontal cortex (R = −0.32, p < 0.05; linear regression;
Fig. 3b, c), supporting the hypothesis that this enhancer mod-
ulates dopamine synthesis. Accordingly, the top differentially
expressed genes from the transcriptomic profiling described
above – namely, NR4A1, NR4A2, and EGR1 – are transcription
factors that affect TH and IGF2 expression28–33 (STRING data-
base interactions, Supplementary Fig. 7c), supporting dysregula-
tion of the TH-IGF2 locus in major psychosis.
Igf2 enhancer loss affects dopamine levels and synapses. We
then examined transgenic mice carrying an intergenic Igf2
enhancer deletion (Fig. 3). Since the intergenic enhancer region
we deleted in mice is near the Igf2 gene but may not be the
ortholog of the human IGF2 enhancer, we first analyzed Hi-C
data of mouse cortical neurons, which showed that this mouse
enhancer does target the promoter of the TH gene as well as the
Igf2 gene (Supplementary Fig. 11). In these mice, we examined
the frontal cortex and striatum, the latter being a major site of
dopamine production in the brain. In the striatum, inactivation of
the Igf2 enhancer led to a decrease in TH protein levels and in
dopamine (p < 0.05; one-way ANOVA; Fig. 3d, e); this effect was
not observed in the frontal cortex (Supplementary Fig. 12). TH
protein levels are 5.6-fold greater in the mouse striatum relative to
frontal cortex (p < 10−11; one-way ANOVA; Supplementary
Fig. 13), which may explain the capacity to detect a decrease in
striatal, but not frontal, TH in mice lacking the enhancer at Igf2.
These data collectively suggest that in schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder, epigenetic disruption of enhancer activity at the IGF2
locus in neurons leads to abnormalities in subcortical dopami-
nergic signaling, which is centrally involved in the development
of psychotic symptoms.
We further examined the widespread consequences of enhancer
disruption at the Igf2 locus in the brain by profiling the
transcriptome. We used RNA-sequencing to assess the transcrip-
tomes of wild-type and Igf2 enhancer deletion mice, examining
the frontal cortex and striatum (Supplementary Data 11; Supple-
mentary Fig. 14). Enhancer deletion resulted in a significant
upregulation of Igf2 expression in both the frontal cortex and
striatum of Igf2enh−/− mice (Fig. 4a; p < 4.3 × 10−3 in frontal

 of synaptosomes from the striatum of wild-type and Igf2enh−/−
mice using quantitative mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figs. 16
and 17). We discovered widespread changes in Igf2enh−/− mice
relative to wild-type mice; 956 of 3619 proteins tested were
significantly different (q < 0.05; one-way ANOVA; Supplementary
Data 16). Synaptic proteins with the highest change were involved
in neurosignaling and structure, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and
synaptic vesicle release (q < 0.01; hypergeometric test; Fig. 4c).
Several proteins altered by Igf2 enhancer deletion had been found
dysregulated in the synaptosomal proteome of schizophrenia
patients36,
including
genes
affecting
synaptic
plasticity
and
neurotransmitter release, such as calcium/calmodulin dependent
protein kinase II alpha (Camk2a), myristoylated alanine-rich C-
kinase substrate (Marcks), and alpha-synuclein (Snca) (Fig. 4c). The
top disease pathways enriched in striatal synaptosomes of mice
lacking the enhancer at Igf2 were related to psychiatric, mental, and
movement disorders (q < 0.05; hypergeometric test; 8 pathways of
715 tested for genes with q < 0.01; Fig. 4d; Supplementary Data 17
and 18). Therefore, loss of the enhancer at Igf2 in mice disrupts
synaptic proteins involved in neurotransmission and associated
with psychiatric disease.
Discussion
In sum, we identified a decrease in repressive epigenetic marks at
an enhancer linked to TH gene regulation in neurons of patients
with major psychosis. Enhancer-mediated upregulation of TH,
promoting higher striatal dopamine synthesis, would augment the
risk for psychosis26. Hence, hypomethylation of the enhancer at
IGF2 may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of
psychotic symptoms.
Interestingly, in patients, the progressive loss of prefrontal
cortex volume closely parallels the development of psychosis21,22.
Imaging studies of at-risk individuals show greater prefrontal
cortical volume loss in individuals that transition to psychosis
compared to those remaining healthy22. The severity of psychotic
symptoms is also associated with structural alterations in the
cortex23. This link between psychotic symptoms and brain
development may involve the molecular regulation of the IGF2
locus identified in this study. In the brain, IGF2 promotes synapse
development, spine maturation, and memory formation16–19,
signifying that normal IGF2 activation is required for healthy
neuronal architecture. Recently, IGF2 was found to be the top
downregulated gene in the schizophrenia prefrontal cortex in the

 large CommonMind consortium RNA-sequencing study37. Loss
of DNA methylation at the IGF2 locus has been associated with
decreased IGF2 mRNA levels in early development38, and risk
factors for schizophrenia; prenatal exposure to famine15 and
reduced brain weight39. Similarly, our transcriptome analysis in
major psychosis patients found a downregulation of genes
affecting synaptic transmission and interacting with IGF2. In
support, mice lacking the enhancer at Igf2 had a decrease in TH
and dopamine levels, along with an Igf2 upregulation as well as
transcriptomic and proteomic alterations affecting synaptic
activity and structure. Therefore, in neurons of major psychosis
patients, epigenetic changes facilitating a recruitment of the
enhancer at IGF2 for activation of TH, may, in tandem, impede
IGF2 regulation. We propose that improper epigenetic control of
an IGF2 enhancer may simultaneously contribute to dopamine-
mediated psychotic symptoms and synaptic structural deficits in
major psychosis.
A limitation to this study is that inter-species differences in
enhancer size and location makes it challenging to demonstrate
equivalence of human and mouse enhancers40. Nonetheless, our
findings demonstrate that altered activity of the enhancer nearest
to the Igf2 gene in the mouse affects TH protein levels and
changes gene expression in pathways affecting neurodevelop-
ment, neurosignaling, and synaptic activity, as was observed in
major psychosis patients with a hypomethylated enhancer at
IGF2. This shared consequence in humans and in transgenic mice
supports the hypothesis that IGF2 enhancer activity is associated
with altered TH regulation and dopamine synthesis. Further
study is required to fully characterize the extent to which
enhancers regulate TH and dopamine signaling in psychotic
disorders.
The multi-omics approach in isolated neurons used in this
study offers a rich dataset for investigating the molecular events
involved in major psychosis. Many of the epigenetic abnormal-
ities identified in major psychosis neurons were associated with
genotype, suggestive of a genetic origin and the potential that
these epigenetic states may be set early in life, before the onset of
disease symptoms. However, our findings do not preclude the
role of, and interaction with, non-shared environmental factors,
particularly during early synaptic development4 and in response
to environmental stressors like inflammation41. It will be also
important to replicate these findings in a second large cohort of
major psychosis and control neurons. Future genome-scale stu-
dies, expanding this dataset to other types of epigenetic mod-
ifications (i.e., non-CG methylation, hydroxymethylation, histone
marks) and to neurons of other brain regions will also be
important for understanding the dynamic interplay between
epigenome, transcriptome, and genetic factors in major psychosis.
Of particular interest will be studies examining whether hypo-
methylation at the IGF2 enhancer extends from a risk factor to a
prognostic marker in peripheral tissues for the development of
psychosis.
Methods
Human tissue samples. Post-mortem brain samples of frontal cortex were
obtained through the NIH NeuroBioBank at the University of Pittsburgh; the
Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center; the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid
Resource Center at Sepulveda; and the University of Miami Brain Endowment
Bank. Patient data is provided in Supplementary Data 1. We obtained sample
information on demographic factors (age, sex), clinical variables (cause of death,
medications at time of death, duration of antipsychotic use, smoking status, and
brain weight), and tissue quality (post-mortem interval, tissue quality/RIN score).
Our analyses controlled for sample age, sex, post-mortem interval, ethnicity, and
the influence of the clinical and technical covariates was examined in our data.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the Van Andel Research Institute
(IRB #15025).
Lifestyle-related factors. Lifestyle factors were coded in the same manner for
cases and controls. To ascertain which patients had a history of antipsychotic
treatment, we used the following approach: FDA-approved antipsychotics were
collected from the literature (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm243903.
htm42), including generic and brand names. Patient medication information was
computationally searched for keyword matches from this list to identify drugs used
by individuals; the mood stabilizers lithium and valproic acid were included in this
list. Where no match was found, antipsychotic status was set to none. Where we
controlled for antipsychotic treatment, patients were divided into those who ever
had antipsychotic use and those who did not. Smoking status was similarly
binarized, so that any lifetime record of smoking resulted in a categorization of the
sample as a smoker or non-smoker (i.e. ever or never). Individuals with missing
information were not included in the analysis examining the effects of lifestyle
factors.
Isolation of neuronal nuclei using flow cytometry. Neuronal nuclei were sepa-
rated using a flow cytometry-based approach, similar to as described43,44. Briefly,
human brain tissue (250 mg) for each sample was minced in 2 mL PBSTA (0.3 M
sucrose, 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Triton X-100). Samples were
then homogenized in PreCellys CKMix tubes with a Minilys (Bertin Instruments)
set at 3,000 rpm for three 5 s intervals, 5 min on ice between intervals. Samples
homogenates were filtered through Miracloth (EMD Millipore), followed by a rinse
with an additional 2 mL of PBSTA. Samples were then placed on a sucrose cushion
(1.4 M sucrose) and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min 4 °
C using a swinging bucket rotor. For each sample, the supernatant was removed
and the pellet was incubated in 700 μl of 1X PBS on ice for 20 min. The nuclei were
then gently resuspended and blocking mix (100 μl of 1X PBS with 0.5% BSA
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% normal goat serum (Gibco) was added to each
sample. NeuN-488 (1:500; Abcam; ab190195) was added and samples were incu-
bated 45 min at 4°C with gentle mixing. Immediately prior to flow cytometry
sorting, nuclei were stained with 7-AAD (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and passed
through a 30 μM filter (SystemX). Nuclei positive for 7-AAD and either NeuN +
(neuronal) or NeuN- (non-neuronal) were sorted using an Influx (BD Biosciences)
or BD FACSAria IIIu (BD Biosciences) at the Faculty of Medicine Flow Cytometry
Facility (Toronto, ON, Canada). Approximately 1 million NeuN+nuclei were
sorted for each sample. Immediately, after sorting nuclei were placed on ice and
then precipitated by raising the volume to 10 mL with 1X PBS and adding 2 mL
1.8 M sucrose, 50 μl 1 M CaCl2 and 30 μl Mg(Ace)2 and centrifugation at 1786 × g
for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed from NeuN+ and NeuN–
samples and pellets were stored at −80 °C. Genomic DNA from each NeuN+ and
NeuN− fraction of each sample was isolated using standard phenol-chloroform
extraction methods.
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Whole-genome DNA methylation
profiling for each sample was performed on Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip
microarrays at The Centre for Applied Genomics (Toronto, Canada). Bisulfite
converted DNA samples (n = 104) were randomized across arrays (8 samples/
array). Data generated from the microarrays were preprocessed with Minfi v1.19.12
(software details listed in Supplementary Note 1). Normalization was performed
with noob45, followed by quantile normalization. We confirmed that the sex of the
individuals, as identified from the genotype data (described below) matched that
inferred from the DNA methylome (minfi getSex() function). Probes that over-
lapped SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05) on the CpG or single-base extension
were excluded (11,812 probes), as were probes known to be cross-reactive46 (42,558
probes) and those that failed detectability (p > 0.01) in > 20% samples (1170
probes). After processing, 812,663 probes were left. Principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed on the matrix of beta values and the first three principal
component projections were examined for all samples; samples were color-coded in
turn by various biological and technical variables (Supplementary Fig. 3). Based on
this PCA co-clustering, one sample, despite being labeled NeuN+ was an outlier;
this sample was excluded from downstream analyses. PCA plots revealed no
sample separation by the array slide on which samples were run. We provided the
surrogate variable analysis47 calculator with the known covariates of age, sex,
diagnosis, and post-mortem interval, and the model identified no additional sur-
rogate variables. Additionally, we did not observe structure in the data exploration
(PCA, hierarchical clustering, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting there is no
major unknown confounder. Therefore, we conclude that there are no major
sources of unexplained variation.
We used the BioConductor package bacon48 to compute lambda for our EWAS,
providing it with t-statistics from the main EWAS reported in our manuscript
(inflation() function; 82 samples; age, sex, post-mortem interval, and first two
genetic principal components were included as covariates). The estimated inflation
factor is 1.03, which is the regime of minimal inflation for an EWAS (<1.1448).
Analysis of differentially methylated regions. The top 50% probes with highest
variance were used to identify differentially methylated probes (406,332 probes).
For each probe, a linear model was fit using the R package limma, with technical
replicates treated as blocking factors and by applying variance shrinkage with an
empirical Bayes approach49; in addition, diagnosis, age, sex, post-mortem interval,

 and the first two principal components of genetic ancestry were used as covariates.
Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction was used to correct nominal p-values.
Principal components of genetic ancestry were computed using plink50,51, using
genotypes from the same patients (see Genotype data processing section below).
Sample identity was confirmed by comparing inferred genotypes from EPIC array
SNP probes, to those of overlapping SNPs in the genotyping arrays (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Genotypes were inferred from EPIC SNP probes by fitting a 3-component
mixture model to SNP beta values (https://github.com/ttriche/infiniumSnps).
Adding to the linear model described above, we also performed a sensitivity
analysis that included microarray slide as a covariate, and found that this variable
did not alter the results. As principal component plots also showed no sample
separation based on array slide, this term was not included in the final model.
Probe-level p-values were grouped into clusters of differentially methylated regions
using the Python module Comb-p52; comb-p groups spatially correlated differ-
entially methylated probes (seed p-value of 0.01 to start a region, at a maximum
distance of 500 bp in each brain tissue, as reported53). The p-values for differen-
tially methylated regions were corrected for multiple testing using Šidák correction.
The Šidák method of multiple correction is proposed as part of the comb-p
algorithm52,54. It is a powerful alternative to Bonferroni correction, as it uses a
corrected alpha value of alpha0 = 1-(1-alpha)1/k (where “alpha” is the alpha for
each test). This increases the alpha0 as the number of tests (k) increases. All
analyses were performed in R v3.3.1 or 3.4.0.
Targeted bisulfite sequencing at IGF2 locus. DNA methylation at the IGF2 and
surrounding genomic area (161 kb) was captured using the SeqCap Epi Enrichment
System (Roche). Biotinylated long oligonucleotide probes targeting 450 sites at the
extended IGF2 locus (unique, non-repetitive genome) were custom designed by
Roche NimbleGen. Library preparation, done in two batches, was performed fol-
lowing manufacturer instructions. Briefly, gDNA (500 ng) of each sample (n = 15
controls and 14 cases, with four technical replicate samples for NeuN+; 12 controls
and 10 cases for NeuN-) were fragmented (~200 bp), end repaired, and ligated to
barcoded adapters using the KAPA Library Preparation kit (Kapa Biosystems) and
SeqCap Adapter Kit A and B (Roche). Bisulfite conversion of the adapter ligated
DNA, followed by column purification, was performed with the EZ DNA
Methylation Lightning kit (Zymo). The bisulfite converted DNA for each sample
was then amplified by ligation mediated PCR (95 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of [98 °C
for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 4 min], 72 °C 10 min, 4 °C hold) followed by
purification with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Sample quality
was verified on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantity was determined with a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equimolar amounts of
each sample were then combined into a single pool. The IGF2 target region was
captured by hybridizing the amplified bisulfite converted DNA pool (1 μg) to the
probe library (Roche), as directed by manufacturer. Enrichment and recovery of
captured bisulfite-converted DNA was completed by binding to magnetic beads
and subsequent wash steps using the SeqCap Pure Capture Bead kit and the
SeqCap Hybridization and Wash kit (Roche). The captured DNA was then
amplified by ligation mediated PCR (98 °C for 45 s, 11 cycles of [98 °C for 15 s, 60 °
C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s], 72 °C for 1 min) followed by purification with Agencourt
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Library quality and quantity was assessed
using a combination of Agilent DNA High Sensitivity chip on a Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies), Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit on a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification qPCR assays
(Kapa Biosystems). DNA sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 on
Rapid Run mode, and on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer.
Data were processed using the pipeline recommended by the manufacturer55.
Trimmomatic56 was used to trim read adapter sequences and BSMAP57 was used
to align reads to the GRCh38/hg38 genome build. The genome index consisted of
reference chromosome sequences (chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, and M) and the
lambda phage genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/215104). Following
alignment, reads were pooled for each sample. The merged set of reads was
separated into those aligning to top and bottom strand, duplicates were removed
with Picard, and then matching read pairs were merged. Samtools58 was used to
exclude reads that were not properly paired or were unmapped. Bamutils were used
to clip overhanging reads that distort methylation estimates. Methratio.py in
BSMAP computed the percent methylation at the base level. Two samples
contained spiked-in lambda phage DNA; these showed that bisulfite conversion
efficiency exceeded 99%.
Only bases with at least 10x coverage were included in locus-level analyses.
Using all bases overlapping a given locus, locus-level methylation was calculated as
the sum of all C counts divided by the sum of all (C+T) counts. Locus-level
methylation was averaged across technical replicates. Locus-level differences were
ascertained using a nested ANOVA model. Statistical significance was ascertained
with an F-test comparing a full model that includes diagnosis, over the null model
explaining effect by age, sex, and post-mortem interval (PMI). Data exploration
showed a batch effect, therefore a batch term was included in the null model.
Null model : M ¼ age þ sex þ PMI þ batch þ error
Full model : M ¼ DX þ age þ sex þ PMl þ batch þ error
Genotype data processing. SNPs in each sample (n = 99 samples, comprising of
83 biological replicates) were determined using the Infinium PsychArray-24 pro-
cessed by The Centre for Applied Genomics (Toronto, Canada). Samples were
randomized across SNP arrays. LiftOver was used to convert genotypes to the
GRCh37/hg19 build. Quality control was performed as described59. SNPs with a
minor allele frequency <0.05, those with HWE p < 10−6 and those missing in > 1%
samples were excluded. Where pairs of individuals had relatedness (Identity By
State; IBS) > 0.185, one was excluded. Samples with < 90% SNPs genotyped and
those with outlier heterozygosity were excluded. 98 samples (82 biological repli-
cates) and 228,369 SNPs passed quality control. Principal components of genotype
data, which represent genetic ancestry and are used as covariates for the EWAS and
meQTL analysis, were extracted using plink50,51 on study samples. Continental
genetic ancestry was ascertained by multidimensional scaling using HapMap3 as a
reference population60. For European-specific EWAS, Europeans were defined as
individuals with MDS 1 and 2 lying within 3 standard deviations of the mean
defined by the CEU population in the HapMap3 reference panel. The biological sex
of samples was confirmed by matching the sex ascertained from the genotype data
to that using control probes on the methylation arrays (minfi getSex() function).
As a measure of the extent of population stratification, we computed lambda
using the genotype data (82 samples, technical replicates excluded) for a plink
logistic regression on case/control status, after adjusting for age, sex, post-mortem
interval, and the first two genetic principal components, and the lambda is 1.07;
this value is in the regime of acceptable values for GWAS studies (~1.0561).
meQTL analysis. 96 samples (82 biological replicates) passed genotype processing
quality control and were used for meQTL analysis. For meQTL analysis, we first
imputed genotype data using Check-bim and the Michigan Imputation Server62
(Eagle v2.3;63 1000G64 Phase 3 v5; Population:ALL). SNPs with a conservative
imputation INFO score of >0.7 were retained (INFO score is a measure of con-
fidence in imputed genotype call). For cis e-QTL inference, SNPs within ±500 kb of
CpG probes in differentially-methylated regions were tested. For trans e-QTL
inference, SNPs from schizophrenia GWAS study24 (SNPs with nominal p < 10−9),
and SCZ credible SNPs were included24,25. Only SNPs with ≥10 individuals per
genotype were tested (each tested SNP has ≥10 samples with AA, ≥10 samples with
AB, and ≥10 samples with BB). This conservative threshold was set to identify
high-confidence SNP-CpG interactions, and is comparable to those previously
described8,53,65. A linear regression was used to assess the effect of genotype on
DNA methylation, with sex, diagnosis, age, and the first two genetic principal
components as covariates. DNA methylation for technical replicates was averaged,
and where technical replicates existed for genotype, the first replicate was used.
Benjamini–Hochberg correction was applied for multiple testing with statistical
significance at q < 0.05.
Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq. We performed RNA-seq on 17 cases and
17 controls (n = 34 human samples) from the total samples analyzed in the DNA
methylation study. These randomly selected samples for RNA-seq had a similar
DNA methylation status at the IGF2 locus in cases relative to controls, as the full
cohort (5–9% hypomethylation in cases). Prefrontal cortex samples were lysed
using QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen) and homogenized with a TissueLyser (Qia-
gen). Total RNA from each sample was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Universal
Mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions and included an
enzymatic DNase (Qiagen) digestion step. RNA quality was measured on a 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantity was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 spec-
trophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA samples had a RIN quality score
>7 and proceeded to RNA-seq library preparation (RIN between 7.1 and 9.4 for all
samples). Libraries were prepared by the Van Andel Genomics Core from 300 ng of
total RNA using the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboseErase (v1.16) (Kapa
Biosystems). RNA was sheared to 300-400 bp. Prior to PCR amplification, cDNA
fragments were ligated to Bio Scientific NEXTflex Adapters (Bioo Scientific).
Quality and quantity of the finished libraries were assessed using a combination of
Agilent DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), QuantiFluor®
dsDNA System (Promega Corp.), and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification qPCR
assays (Kapa Biosystems). Individually indexed libraries were pooled, and 75 bp
paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer, with
all libraries run across 3 flow cells. Base calling was done by Illumina NextSeq
Control Software (NCS) v2.0 and output of NCS was demultiplexed and converted
to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.9.0.
Trimgalore (v0.11.5) was used for adapter removal prior to genome alignment.
STAR66 (v2.3.5a) index was generated using Ensemble GRCh38 p10 primary
assembly genome and the Gencode v26 primary assembly annotation. Read
alignment was performed using a STAR two-pass mode. To match genotypes
between RNAseq and PsychArray-24, GATK Haplotype caller was applied to
extract SNPs from aligned bam files, following the best practices instruction from
the GATK website (https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/3892/
the-gatk-best-practices-for-variant-calling-on-rnaseq-in-full-detail). Plink50,51 was
used to convert VCF files to bed/bim/fam files. LiftOver was used to convert
PsychArray genotype array coordinates from hg19 to the hg38 build used in the
RNA-seq data. SNPs in common with the unimputed genotypes were identified
(~11.4K SNPs) and extracted using plink50,51. SNP call overlap was computed as

 the number of SNPs for which number of minor alleles (0, 1, or 2) was identical
between the genotype and RNA-seq platforms. We found perfect sample matching
between the RNA-seq and genotype platforms (n = 30 samples tested; median of
~5.2K SNPs tested; 93-96% genotype match; Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Gene counts matrix was imported into R (3.4.1) and low expressed genes
(counts per million (CPM) <1 in all samples) were removed prior to differential
expression in edgeR34. Gene counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of
M-values, fitted in a generalized linear model and differentially tested using a
likelihood ratio test. The generalized linear model included age, sex, post-mortem
interval, and neuronal cell composition as covariates. Cell-type compositions for
each sample was accessed using CIBERSORT67 on normalized sample counts
against cell-type specific markers (see below), identifying the proportion of neurons
in each samples. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to adjust for multiple
testing. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to confirm that genetic ancestry
did not alter our RNA-seq findings, and found that analysis of only individuals
with European ancestry (exclusion of 3 non-European individuals) had strongly
correlated results (Pearson correlation = 0.91) and the same top gene hits as the
original analysis.
Our RNA-seq analysis corrected for the proportion of neuronal cells in each
sample. Neuronal cell proportions were determined by CIBERSORT67 (http://
cibersort.stanford.edu), which involved a gene signature matrix derived from single
cell RNA-seq measures in adult human brain cells (signature matrix;68 source69).
Because major psychosis is characterized by a loss of synaptic density, we excluded
genes encoding synaptic proteins (Genes2Cognition database;70 lists L00000009,
L00000016, and L00000012) from the gene signatures. One hundred and thirty-five
synapse-associated genes were excluded, leaving 768 genes in the deconvolution
analysis. CIBERSORT was run (100 permutations), and the inferred proportion of
neurons was used as a covariate for differential expression.
Pathway enrichment analysis. Pathways affected by the DNA methylation and
transcriptomic changes in major psychosis were determined. For DNA methylation
data, probes were mapped to genes if they overlapped between 1 kb upstream of the
transcription start site to the transcription end site. Gencode71 v27 (liftOver to
GRCh37) were used for gene extents. Pathway definitions were aggregated from
HumanCyc72, IOB’s NetPath73, Reactome74,75, NCI Curated Pathways76,
mSigDB35, Panther77, and Gene Ontology78,79. The same pathway sets were used
for the DNA methylation and transcriptomic analysis. For DNA methylation
pathway analysis, only pathways with 10–500 genes were included (6858 path-
ways). For pathway analysis of DNA methylation, a hypergeometric test was
performed comparing the proportion of foreground probes (p < 0.05 from DNA
methylation region analysis) to background probes (all probes tested in DNA
methylation region analysis). Pre-ranked GSEA35 was used for transcriptomic
pathway analysis, as it separates pathways upregulated in disease from those
downregulated in disease (see Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq section for
details). Benjamini-Hochberg correction was performed to adjust for multiple
testing with significance at q < 0.05.
Igf2 enhancer deletion in mice. A 4.9-kb-long DNA fragment (chr7: 149,796,331-
149,801,250 in mm9) was deleted from the intergenic region of H19 and Igf2 by
classical ES cell gene targeting and blastocyst injection in the mouse on the 129S1
genetic background. One loxP site remained at the site of the deletion mutation
after the excision of the Pgkneo positive selection cassette by crossing the targeted
mutant male mouse to an Hprt-CRE transgenic female80. Three oligonucleotide
primers, IGKOCrerecU: CGGAATGTTTGTGTGGAGAGCA; IGKOwtU:
TAGGGGTCCTGAAGACGTCAG; and IGKOCreWTL: TTGGTGTAGCAC
CCTGTAACCC are combined in one PCR reaction to distinguish the mutant from
the wild type allele, as visualized by a 450 bp or a 350 bp long PCR product,
respectively. Notably, the enhancer we deleted in mice was the closest enhancer (as
defined by ENCODE) to the one we found epigenetic misregulated at the IGF2
locus in major psychosis patients. We identified mouse enhancer boundaries using
chromatin marks in the mouse forebrain (ENCODE; ref. 2; Fig. 3) and con-
servatively deleted a ~4.9-kb intergenic region encompassing the full length of the
enhancer.
Mice were bred and housed in ventilated polycarbonate cages, and given ad
libitum sterile food (LabDiet 5021) and water. Adult mice were housed by sex in
groups of 2–5 littermates. The vivarium was maintained under controlled temperature
(21 °C±1 °C) and humidity (50–60%), with a 12-h diurnal cycle (lights on:
0700–1900). Approximately equal numbers of male and female were tested, and no
sex differences were detected (in all Western blotting, HPLC, and transcriptomic
experiments). No animals were excluded from the study. Wild-type (+/+) and
homozygous knock-out (Igf2enh−/−) adult mice (~2.5 months old) were tested, and
sample sizes were comparable to other studies of Igf2 mutant mice17,81. All animal
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the Van
Andel Research Institute and complied with the requirements of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP # PIL-17-10-010).
Chromatin interaction analysis in mice. We analyzed Hi-C data from mouse
cortical neurons (accession: GSE96107)82. Our Hi-C analysis pipeline involved
Trim Galore (v0.4.3) for adapter trimming, HiCUP83 (v0.5.9) for mapping and
performing quality control, and GOTHiC for identifying significant interactions
(Bonferroni p < 0.05), with a 40-kb resolution84 (R package, v1.16.0). GOTHiC is
an effective tool for identifying cis-interactions (interactions at shorter mean dis-
tances)85. Hi-C gene annotation involved identifying interactions with gene pro-
moters, defined as ±2 kb of a gene transcription start site.
Immunoblotting. All tissue preparation procedures were performed on ice. Frozen
tissue samples weighing ~20 mg were sonicated in 500 µl of RIPA buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM
NaCl, protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche, and 1 mM EDTA) and incubated for
1 h on ice with mixing. The samples were then centrifuged at 22,000×g for 30 min.
Protein content of the supernatant was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and then diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Biorad) to yield
20 µg protein per lane. Samples were separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and blotted onto 0.22 µm PVDF membranes (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 2 h at a constant 20 V using xCell II blot module (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Membranes were blocked in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM
NaCl, and 1% tween-20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room
temperature. Membranes were then incubated with blocking buffer containing
primary antibodies: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, Pel-Freez Biologicals, P40101-150),
NeuN (Cell Signaling), internexin neuronal intermediate filament protein (INA,
Sigma, HPA008057), and actin (Millipore, MAB1501) diluted 1:1000 overnight at
4 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min with TBST and probed with
the appropriate HRP-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Cell Signaling, anti-rabbit
IgG#7074 and anti-mouse IgG#7076,) diluted 1:6000 in blocking buffer according
to the manufacturers’ recommended protocol. Blots were then washed three times
for 5 min with TBST and imaged using west pico ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
HPLC-based quantification of dopamine levels. All tissue preparation proce-
dures were performed on ice. Frozen tissue samples weighing between 5 and 20 mg
were sonicated in 100–300 µl of 0.2 M perchloric acid (Sigma). The sample was
centrifuged at 22,000×g for 30 min and the resulting supernatant was filtered using
0.22 µM cellulose acetate filter (Costar). The filtered supernatant was separated
using the HTEC-500 High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
(Eicom) with the SC-30DS reverse phase separation column (Eicom) and elec-
trochemical detector. Samples were separated in mobile phase consisting of 0.1 M
citrate acetate pH 3.5, 20% methanol, 220 g/L sodium octane sulfonate, and 5 mg/L
EDTA-Na. The samples were then compared to known standards of dopamine
(Sigma), homovinillic acid (HVA), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC).
The pellet was dissolved in 0.5 mL of 1 M NaOH for 10 min at 90 °C, and the
resulting protein concentration determined by BCA assay. The final values were
calculated as ng analyte per µg protein.
RNA-seq processing for mice with the Igf2 enhancer deletion. A transcriptomic
analysis of the striatum and frontal cortex of wild-type and Igf2enh−/− mice was
performed. Brain tissue (~25 mg) was homogenized with a ceramic bead-based
homogenizer (Precellys, Bertin Instruments) in 1 mL of Trizol (Life Technologies).
Total RNA was isolated according to the Trizol manufacturer’s instructions, treated
with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) at room temperature for 30 min, and cleaned up
with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA yield was quantified using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RNA integrity was verified via the Agi-
lent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were prepared by
the Van Andel Genomics Core from 500 ng of total RNA and sequenced, as
described in the Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq Methods section above.
Single-end 75 bp reads were generated for the RNA-seq experiment. Trimgalore
v0.5.0 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) was
used to trim low-quality bases. STAR66 was used to align the reads to the genome.
The genome index was generated using STAR using GRCm38.primary_assembly.

Differential expression and pathway analysis in mice. Only genes with ≥1CPM
in all samples were included for differential expression analysis. Transcript counts
were normalized for library size using the Trimmed Mean of M values (TMM)
method. Ensembl Gene IDs were mapped to MGI symbols using Biomart86. To
ascertain differentially-expressed genes, edgeR34 was used to fit a linear model to
each gene, using genotype (wild-type or Igf2enh−/−) as an explanatory variable
and sex as a covariate. estimateDisp() was used to estimate the dispersion of each
gene, and glmLRT was used to identify differentially-expressed genes. Benjamini-
Hochberg was used to correct for multiple-testing (significance at q < 0.05).
For pathway analysis, pre-ranked GSEA was run using the output of differential
expression analysis35 (1000 permutations). Gene sets included those from curated
pathway databases including: HumanCyc72, IOB’s NetPath73, Reactome74,75, NCI
Curated Pathways76, Pathway Interaction database, MSigDB35, Panther77,

Synaptosomal proteome analysis by mass spectrometry. Changes in synaptic
proteins in the striatum of mice with the enhancer deletion at Igf2 was determined
by quantitative proteome analysis. In this study, striatal synaptosomes from wild-
type and Igf2enh−/− mice were compared (2 striatum pools per genotype, 3 mice
per pool; n = 6 wild-type and 6 Igf2enh−/− mice). Synaptosomes were isolated
from frozen striatum similar to a previously-described protocol88. Specifically,
striatum tissue was homogenized in 5 mL isolation buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM
Hepes pH 8.0, and protease inhibitor cocktail) using 16 gentle strokes with a glass
dounce homogenizer. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000×g. The
resultant supernatant was then layered on 1.2 M sucrose and centrifuged at
160,000×g for 15 min using SW-41-Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The interface
between sucrose layers was collected, layered on top of 0.8 M sucrose, and cen-
trifuged again at 160,000×g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was then dissolved in
100 μl RIPA buffer and concentration determined using a BCA assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Purity of synaptosomes was verified by western blotting with
anti-synaptophysin antibody (Cell Signaling, #12270), anti-histone 3 antibody
(Abcam, ab1791), and anti-actin antibody (Millipore, #MAB1501) all diluted
1:1000. Each sample (70 µg per sample) were run 1 cm into a SDS-PAGE gel and
stained using coomassie blue as described89.
Samples were then submitted to the Whitehead Mass Spectrometry Facility
(MIT, Cambridge, MA) for subsequent proteome library preparation, iTRAQ-
labeling, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometry (MS). Briefly,
samples excised from the SDS-PAGE gel were reduced, alkylated, and digested with
trypsin at 37 °C overnight using buffers and reagents that were free of primary
amines. The resulting peptides were extracted, labeled with Sciex iTRAQ 4-plex
isotopic tags, combined, purified, and concentrated by solid-phase extraction and
injected onto a Shimadzu HPLC and fraction collector equipped with a self-packed
Aeris PEPTIDE XB-C18 analytical column (10 cm by 2.1 mm, Phenomenex).
Peptides were eluted using standard reverse-phase gradients and pH = 10
ammonium formate buffers with a total of 16 fractions collected across the
analytical gradient. The resulting fraction were reduced to a total of 8 fractions.
After volume reduction the peptides in these eluents were separated using standard
reverse-phase gradients using a Thermo EASY nLC chromatographic system. The
effluent from the column was analyzed using a Thermo Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid
Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (nanospray configuration) operated in a
data-dependent manner.
Peptides were identified from the MS data using PEAKS Studio 8.5. The Mus
musculus Refseq protein FASTA entries were downloaded from NIH/NCBI and
concatenated to a database of common contaminants. An FDR threshold of 1% for
identification of peptides and protein positive identifications was used, and
quantitation was based on the top three Total Ion Current (TIC) method. Relative
ratios of the iTRAQ 4-plex reporter ions were used for quantitation. Significance
was calculated by ANOVA, and the Benjamini-Hochberg method was used for
multiple testing correction (significance q < 0.05). As a check for purity of
synaptosomal protein content, we performed a pathway analysis on all detected
proteins. A hypergeometric test was performed using pathway genes (10–200
genes) and human-mouse disease genes (total of 1760 test). Foreground was all
proteins detected (1098 unique MGI symbols), and background was all proteins in
all pathways (9593 MGI symbols). Pathways inclusion required ≥1 genes in the
foreground and ≥1 genes in the background set (1422 pathways). Benjamini-
Hochberg correction was used for multiple testing correction. Three hundred and
twenty pathways were significantly enriched (q < 0.05). Main pathway themes
corresponded to synaptic neurotransmission, with minor themes corresponding to
glucose metabolism and immune activity and signaling (Supplementary Fig. 17,
Supplementary Data 19).
To identify pathways of proteins differentially enriched in Igf2enh−/− mice
relative to wildtype, pathway analysis was performed using MetaCore (https://
clarivate.com/products/metacore/). Proteins with differential expression at p <
0.001 (q < 0.01) were used as foreground, and the set of all proteins for which
relative ratio was computed was used as the background.

Author contributions
The study was designed and coordinated by S.P. and V.L. V. L. and P.J. contributed to
the sorting of neuronal nuclei and DNA extraction for epigenetic and genetic experi-
ments. S.P. performed the computational analysis for the epigenetic, genetic, and
transcriptomic datasets. L.M. processed the transcriptomic dataset. B.K. performed
immunoblotting, HPLC experiments, and synaptic proteome study. P.E.S. generated and
J.L. managed the mutant mice with the Igf2 enhancer deletion. P.L. analyzed the
chromatin conformation data and contributed to the DNA methylation analysis. A.P.
helped oversee the project. The manuscript was written by S.P. and V.L., and com-
mented on by all authors.
