Abstract
Neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD) affects a significant number
of neonates receiving mechanical ventilation with oxygen-rich gas
(MV-O2). Regardless, the primary molecular driver of the disease
remains elusive. We discover significant enrichment for SNPs in
the PDGF-Ra gene in preterms with nCLD and directly test the
effect of PDGF-Ra haploinsufficiency on the development of nCLD
using a preclinical mouse model of MV-O2. In the context of MV-
O2, attenuated PDGF signaling independently contributes to defec-
tive septation and endothelial cell apoptosis stemming from a
PDGF-Ra-dependent reduction in lung VEGF-A. TGF-b contributes
to the PDGF-Ra-dependent decrease in myofibroblast function.
Remarkably,
endotracheal
treatment
with
exogenous PDGF-A
rescues both the lung defects in haploinsufficient mice undergoing
MV-O2. Overall, our results establish attenuated PDGF signaling as
an important driver of nCLD pathology with provision of PDGF-A as
a protective strategy for newborns undergoing MV-O2.

Introduction
Positive pressure mechanical ventilation with O2-rich gas (MV-O2)
offers life-saving treatment for respiratory failure due to lung imma-
turity and insufficient respiratory drive in preterm infants. Unfortu-
nately, this therapy significantly increases the risk for an important
number of preterm infants and a subset of newborns to develop
neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD), that is, bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD; Hargitai et al, 2001; Merritt & Boynton, 2009; Jobe,
2011; Konig & Guy, 2014). Characterized by defective alveolar
septation and impaired vascularization, nCLD is associated with
poor pulmonary and neurological long-term outcomes in affected
infants (Ehrenkranz et al, 2005; Doyle & Anderson, 2009). The
adverse effects of positive pressure MV-O2 on pulmonary develop-
ment have been reproduced in experimental models of the disease
(Scherle, 1970; Hamilton et al, 2003; Ehrenkranz et al, 2005; Bland
et al, 2008; Hilgendorff et al, 2011), manifesting as increased lung
apoptosis and disordered matrix elastin characteristic of nCLD.
Because a myriad of developmental signals are perturbed in the
setting of active disease, it is difficult to distinguish primary drivers
of pathology from secondary effectors or compensatory responses.
Yet, if a defect in a specific signaling pathway underlies the suscepti-
bility to developing nCLD and orchestrates the multiple processes
that execute disease pathology, it would be critical to identify this
potential therapeutic target.
An essential role for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signal-
ing in alveolar development was established by the discovery that

 lungs of “knockout” mice lacking PDGF-A failed to form alveoli, with
animals that survived infancy demonstrating an emphysema-like
phenotype of enlarged distal air sacs (Bostrom et al, 1996; Lindahl
et al, 1997). This lung pathology was attributed to failure of migra-
tion of PDGF-Ra-positive alveolar smooth muscle progenitor cells
(also known as myofibroblasts) into the distal embryonic lung.
Because myofibroblasts are believed to drive normal subdivision of
primitive air sacs into mature alveoli (“secondary septation”), their
absence presumably resulted in abnormally large distal air sacs due
to a failure to execute this process. Deletion of the cognate receptor,
PDGF-Ra, resulted in death in mid-gestation before air sac morpho-
genesis initiated (Bostrom & Betsholtz, 2002), but transgenic rescue
of the profound craniofacial abnormalities and spina bifida enabled
survival through birth. Distal lungs in these mutants also lacked
myofibroblasts and failed to undergo secondary septation (Sun et al,
2000).
When the PDGF signaling pathway was examined in the lungs of
animal models of nCLD employing mechanical ventilation (MV-O2),
reduced abundance of PDGF-A and PDGF-Ra proteins or mRNA was
observed (Bland et al, 2003, 2007, 2008), similar to the lungs of neona-
tal rats exposed to hyperoxia (Powell et al, 1992) and preterm infants
developing nCLD (Popova et al, 2014). These findings suggest that
reduced PDGF signaling may be involved in the air sac morphogenesis
defect of nCLD, but a causal role has not yet been demonstrated.
Furthermore, since microvascular defects were not reported in the
lungs of PDGF mouse mutants that failed to undergo secondary septa-
tion, the position of this pathway in the hierarchy of perturbed signal-
ing in nCLD is uncertain. Here, in a case–control study of infants with
nCLD, we discover significant enrichment for SNPs in the PDGF-Ra
gene associated with reduced PDGF-R levels and diminished migration
of lung fibroblasts suggesting that impairment of this pathway might
be a primary driver of disease. We confirm this model using gene-
targeted mice haploinsufficient for PDGF-Ra, showing an interaction
with an established model of MV-O2 that reproduces the multiple
pathologies of nCLD, all of which are ameliorated by exogenous
administration of PDGF-A protein during MV-O2. We also dissect the
molecular crosstalk that mediate nCLD pathology, showing that attenu-
ated PDGF-Ra signaling results in a reduction of VEGF-A expression,
likely responsible for the vasculature phenotype through increased
endothelial cell apoptosis. We also find that increased TGF-b and
mechanical stretch, driving lung injury in the newborn lung, act in
concert to reduce PDGF-Ra signaling, exacerbating the underlying
basal reduction in PDGF-Ra to a level sufficient to result in disease.
Our work implicating attenuated PDGF signaling as a driver of the air
sac and vasculature defects of nCLD, along with our demonstration
that both pathologies can be ameliorated by exogenous PDGF-A
protein, provides a strong rationale for pursuing augmentation of
PDGF signaling as a potential targeted therapy for this serious disease.
Results
Enrichment of PDGF-Ra SNPs associated with reduced protein
levels and migration of lung fibroblasts from ventilated preterm
infants developing nCLD
We confirm reduced PDGF-Ra expression in lung fibroblasts isolated
from
ventilated
preterm
infants.
This
reduction
in
PDGF-Ra
expression was correlated with increased duration of MV-O2, as
quantified
by
immunofluorescence
and
immunoblot
analysis
(Fig 1A). Further, a case–control analysis of PDGF-Ra in 1,061
newborns (n = 492 with moderate or severe BPD) identified 14
SNPs out of 117 with nominal significance (P ≤ 0.05; Fig 1B). Three
of these SNPs were highly statistically significant, with P-values
below 0.001 (Appendix Table S1). The presence of at least one SNP
at these three positions (rs12506783) was associated with reduced
PDGF-Ra gene expression and PDGF-R as well as VEGF-A protein
levels
in
blood
from
ventilated
preterm
infants
(Fig 1C–E,
Appendix Fig S1). In human lung fibroblast, this SNP is associated
with reduced PDGF-Ra protein level in accordance with reduced
migration (Fig 1F and G). Analysis of SNPs cis-regulating gene
expression for genes in the PDGF pathway and its downstream path-
ways showed enrichment of low P-values for SNPs linked to the
MAPKKK-cascade, JAK/STAT-cascade, apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA
metabolism, lipid metabolism, protein metabolism, and actin and
calcium ion homeostasis (Appendix Table S2). Together, these
experiments indicate that MV-O2 in humans results in a reduction of
PDGF-Ra expression by alveolar fibroblasts, and suggests that
genetic risk factors for reduced PDGF signaling in human infants is
associated with an increased risk of developing nCLD.
PDGF-Ra haploinsufficiency drives the air sac pathology of nCLD
in neonatal mice undergoing MV-O2
In order to test whether attenuated PDGF signaling was indeed a
risk factor for the development of nCLD as suggested by our human
SNP data and not restricted to the air sac component, we obtained
gene-targeted mice lacking one allele of PDGF-Ra and subjected
them to MV-O2 using a unique preclinical mouse model. We found
that lungs of PDGF-Ra haploinsufficient newborn mice undergoing
MV-O2 for 8 h showed a significant increase in distal airspace size
and decrease in radial alveolar counts resembling nCLD pathology
as assessed by quantitative morphometry when compared to unven-
tilated controls (Fig 2A–C), whereas their ventilated WT littermates
were unaffected. As expected with this phenotype, there were fewer
secondary septae in PDGF-Ra+/� neonatal mice after MV-O2 for 8 h
as compared to WT mice (Fig 2D), with no significant difference in
lung volumes between the groups (WT control 55.3 � 7.0 ll/g bw;
WT MV-O2 56.2 � 14.2 ll/g bw; PDGF-Ra+/� control 59.7 �
11.9 ll/g bw; PDGF-Ra+/� MV-O2 57.6 � 23.7 ll/g bw; mean and
SD each). Atelectasis, as analyzed using ImageJ, involved 14–18%
of the total lung in both groups undergoing MV-O2 (WT MV-O2
17.2 � 9.6%; PDGF-Ra+/� MV-O2 22.8 � 10.4%; P = 0.61).
Immunoblot and mRNA analysis confirmed reduced pulmonary
PDGF-Ra level (Figs 2G and EV1D), reflected by the reduced
number of myofibroblasts localized on septal crests in ventilated
PDGF-Ra+/� mice lungs compared to WT littermates (Fig 2E and
F). Diminished JAK-2 and STAT-3 in ventilated PDGF-Ra+/� mice
reflects reduced PDGF-Ra downstream signaling (Fig 2H and I).

 histological analysis of PDGF-Ra+/� mice undergoing MV-O2, a
significant reduction in the number of alveolar micro-vessels (20–
100 lm), notably exceeding the effect observed in WT pups
(Fig 3A). This finding was corroborated by immunoblot analysis
showing reduced lung protein levels of the endothelial cell markers,
VEGF-R2 (Fig 3B), and VE-cadherin (Fig 3C) in ventilated neonatal
PDGF-Ra+/� mice, suggesting a net loss of endothelial cells. Co-
staining for apoptosis and endothelial cell markers demonstrated
significantly increased vascular endothelial cell death in the lung
periphery of ventilated neonatal PDGF-Ra+/� mice compared with
WT littermates (Fig 3E and F).
To further explore the link between reduced PDGF signaling
and endothelial cell apoptosis, we focused on VEGF-A, a critical
regulator of pulmonary microvascular development (Nauck et al,
1997; Compernolle et al, 2002; Kamio et al, 2008; Ding et al,

 siRNA-treated mouse myofibroblasts to human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) in culture, and found reduced endothe-
lial cell survival due to an increase in apoptosis (Fig 3G and J) and
a reduction in the permeability factor eNOS (Fig 3K), comparable to
the effect seen with an anti-VEGF-A antibody. These experiments
together with Fig 2G–I indicate that PDGF-Ra signaling in the
myofibroblasts promotes VEGF-A expression, and corroborates that
the microvascular phenotype is downstream of attenuated PDGF
signaling.
Supplemental PDGF-A rescues both the air sac and microvascular
nCLD phenotypes induced by MV-O2 in neonatal PDGF-Ra
haploinsufficient mice
As suggested by the human SNP data and our experiments above, if
the attenuated PDGF signaling drives the pathogenesis of nCLD in all
its manifestations, experimentally augmenting PDGF signaling in the
lungs of ventilated haploinsufficient mice should ameliorate both the
air sac and microvascular phenotypes. To directly test this predic-
tion, we administered exogenous PDGF-A protein by endotracheal
delivery at the onset of MV-O2. The results showed both an increase
in peripheral lung micro-vessel number (20–100 lm) in treated vs.
un-treated PDGF-Ra+/� neonatal mice undergoing MV-O2, as well as
a normalization of air sac defects, with increased alveolar and micro-
vessel number compared with untreated controls (Fig 4A–C). The
reduction in JAK-2, STAT-3, VE-cadherin, and VEGF-A protein
expression in the lungs of ventilated mice was also ameliorated with
PDGF-A treatment, supporting reversal of the endothelial cell apop-
tosis (Fig 4E–H). PDGF-A treatment further enhanced PDGF-Ra
protein, associated with increased levels of AKT, suggesting a feed-
forward mechanism where increased endosomal internalization
leads to PDGF-Ra recycling in lung myofibroblasts with subsequent
increase in receptor expression (Wang et al, 2004; Heldin, 2013)
(Fig 4D and I). The lung periphery of mechanically ventilated PDGF-
Ra+/� neonatal mice also exhibited an increase in (secreted) VEGF-A
protein immunolocalized near myofibroblasts, providing further
support (Fig 4J and M, upper panel). Quantification of immunoflu-
orescent staining confirmed a pronounced reduction in apoptotic
(cleaved caspase-3 positive) surface area and individual cells, with
dramatically increased CD31 surface area in PDGF-A-treated mice
(Fig 4K–M lower panel). A physiological rescue was also observed,
with an improvement in quasi-static compliance by lung function
testing in neonatal mice pretreated with PDGF-A (Fig 4N), with no
significant difference in lung volume (PDGF-A 49.8 � 5.6 ll/g bw
vs. no-PDGF-A 49.3 � 3.9 ll/g bw; mean � SD, P = 0.99, two-
tailed Mann–Whitney test).
Elevated TGF-b levels causally relate with reduced PDGF-Ra
expression in nCLD patients and mice undergoing MV-O2,
reducing downstream signaling and migration in
pulmonary myofibroblasts
Clinical and experimental studies have consistently demonstrated
activation of pulmonary TGF-b signaling with MV-O2 (Assoian et al,
1987; Groneck et al, 1994; Zhao et al, 1997; Yamamoto et al, 2002;
Schultz et al, 2003; Vozzelli et al, 2004; Xu et al, 2006; Wu et al,
2008). We therefore investigated how reduced PDGF signaling and
its demonstrated consequences are provoked in the neonatal lung.
Hence, we characterized the two potential players mechanical
stretch and TGF-b alone and in combination, with respect to their
effect on primary mouse and human lung myofibroblasts.
Immunofluorescent images of tissue sections from nCLD patients
(n = 7) showed reduced expression of PDGF-Ra associated with
increased expression of pSMAD-2 compared with a control lung,
supporting the relevance of the findings to patients suffering from
nCLD (Fig 5A). In parallel, we performed gene expression microar-
ray analysis of blood samples obtained from 20 preterm infants in
the first 72 h after birth, which similarly demonstrated an inverse
correlation between the levels of TGF-b1 and PDGF-Ra in patients
who went on to develop nCLD that was not observed in patients
who did not (Fig 5B). We next analyzed TGF-b signaling activity in
the lungs of ventilated WT mice, which demonstrated increased
pSMAD 2/3 protein with a concomitant reduction in PDGF-Ra+
alveolar myofibroblasts (Fig 5C). To test the impact of TGF-b on
PDGF-Ra promoter activity, we conducted a luciferase assay by
transfecting CCL206 cells with a pGal vector carrying a PDGF-Ra
promoter insert. Administration of TGF-b caused a 50% reduction
in luciferase activity (Fig 5D), indicating that TGF-b affects PDGF-
Ra gene transcription, supporting the inverse relationship observed
in nCLD is causal.

 data, VEGF-A signaling associated with micro-vessel development
was also diminished by 20% in pulmonary myofibroblasts from
neonatal WT mice incubated with TGF-b (Fig 5G). Translating this
finding in human, we demonstrate diminished PDGF-Ra levels and
migration of fibroblasts (Fig 5I). Reduced migration upon TGF-b was
confirmed by Boyden chamber and wound migration assays showing
significantly abrogated velocity and distance travelled by fibroblasts
in comparison to untreated controls (Fig 5J–M).
Pronounced effect of TGF-b on pulmonary myofibroblasts from
PDGF-Ra+/� mice and in concert with mechanical stretch on both
mice and human myofibroblasts
The inhibitory effect of TGF-b on PDGF-Ra level and downstream
proteins JAK-2, STAT-3, and pERK/ERK was dramatic in myofibrob-
lasts isolated from PDGF-Ra+/� mice with more than 30–50%
reduction in the respective proteins (Fig 6A–C and E). This was
accompanied by reduction in vascular marker VEGF-A and dimin-
ished migration (Fig 6D and F).
Mechanical ventilation has been demonstrated to exert signifi-
cant strain forces on the developing lung in infants requiring
invasive and even non-invasive respiratory support (Konig & Guy,
2014). We therefore dissected the contribution of mechanical
stretch and the impact of growth factor exposure on PDGF signaling
in vitro. Here we found that mechanical stretch in combination with
TGF-b significantly reduced PDGF-Ra level in mouse myofibroblasts
together with a matched reduction in VEGF-A expression confirming
our in vivo findings (Fig 6G and H). With respect to myofibroblast
function, we found that mechanical stretch in the presence of single
or repeat doses of TGF-b significantly reduced migration in primary
pulmonary myofibroblasts from WT mice together with a significant
reduction in RAS and downstream pERK/ERK protein level, a signal-
ing downstream of PDGF-Ra with a crucial role in myofibroblasts
migration (Fig 6I–K; Liu et al, 2007; Fuentes-Calvo et al, 2013). In
addition, mechanical stretch in the presence of TGF-b increased
myofibroblast proliferation, together with proteins associated with
proliferation PI3K and PCNA level (Fig EV2B–F). Whereas TGF-b in
the absence of mechanical stretch was able to achieve comparable
effects on myofibroblast migration, PDGF-Ra, and VEGF-A protein
level (Fig 5E, G and H), mechanical stretch alone did not alter the
migratory behavior or protein expression in the lung myofibroblasts
but did increase their proliferative behavior (Figs 6G and H, and
EV2A and C).
Translating these effects to primary human fibroblasts obtained
from tracheal aspirates of preterm nCLD patients, we found a signifi-
cant reduction in PDGF-Ra protein level and migration by TGF-b in
combination with stretch (Fig 6L and M). In line with this, repeat
application of TGF-b in combination with stretch markedly reduced
the migration of human lung fibroblasts (Fig 6M).
Taken together, these results indicate that elevated TGF-b signal-
ing in the setting of MV-O2 contributes to the development of nCLD,
exacerbating the deficiency in PDGF signaling by inhibiting expres-
sion of PDGF-Ra on lung myofibroblasts.
The central role of the PDGF signaling cascade closely inter-
twined with upstream effectors and downstream effects with critical
consequences for cellular functions in the injured neonatal lung as
well as its recue with administration of PDGF-A is depicted in Fig 7.
Discussion
Neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD), formerly known as bron-
chopulmonary dysplasia, has long-term health consequences not
only for pulmonary but also neurologic function. Invasive and non-
invasive mechanical ventilation with oxygen-rich gas (MV-O2) is
necessary for the survival of preterm babies suffering from respira-
tory failure due to lung immaturity and insufficient respiratory drive
after birth. Nonetheless, both treatments are known to contribute to
adverse pulmonary outcome, that is, the development of nCLD
(Konig & Guy, 2014). Hence, it is critical to pursue medical treat-
ments that can prevent or treat nCLD in neonates requiring ventila-
tory support. Here, we provide causal evidence supporting a
surprising cellular and molecular model for the development of
nCLD. As shown in mouse and human, PDGF signaling not only
affects secondary septation but significantly impacts the microvas-
cular structure in close relation with the omnipresent TGF in the
injured neonatal lung (Fig 7A). This close intertwinement of growth
factor signaling in nCLD pathology with PDGF as a central driver
holds promising potential for therapeutic approaches.
The integration of PDGF-Ra haploinsufficient mice with a unique
preclinical model of nCLD, together with tailored biochemical and
in vitro assays of human and mouse primary lung cells, allowed us

Model for how attenuated PDGF signaling and positive pressure ventilation interact to produce the distinct phenotypic manifestations of nCLD.
A
MV-O2 in vivo, a combination of O2, that is, oxygen and stretch (purple arrow) and/or TGF-b alone or in combination with mechanical stretch in vitro (yellow arrow),
reduces platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGF-Ra) levels and its downstream signaling through JAK-2 and STAT-3 in the pulmonary myofibroblast (MFB).
This reduction in turn abrogates vascular endothelial growth factor expression (VEGF-A and VEGF-R2), leading to increased apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells
(EC). Whereas myofibroblast migration is diminished through reduced RAS and pERK/ERK signaling, stretch alone increases their proliferation, hence depicting the
differential effect of the most important denominators of nCLD development in the premature lung undergoing MV-O2.
B
Application of PDGF-A to premature lung increases PDGF-Ra levels in an AKT-dependent manner in turn activating the downstream cascade through JAK-2, STAT-3
signaling. This then activates VEGF-A secretion and VEGF-R2 activity reducing apoptosis in endothelial cells (ECs).

 to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of this disease to an
unprecedented level of understanding. Building upon previous
observations suggesting a role for reduced PDGF-Ra signaling in
lung pathology (Bostrom et al, 1996; Lindahl et al, 1997; Bostrom &
Betsholtz, 2002; Lau et al, 2011; Chen et al, 2012; Popova et al,
2014), we dissected upstream and downstream molecular regulators
of nCLD, including a crosstalk with VEGF-A and TGF-b with
mechanical stretch (Fig 7A).
Our finding that impairment of the PDGF signaling pathway—
previously
associated
only
with
myofibroblast
migration
and
secondary septation of air sacs—is capable to produce both the alve-
olar structural and microvascular pathology of nCLD is surprising.
Is it possible that due to the dynamic intercellular crosstalks
required to generate the highly stereotyped and architecturally
complex arrangement of alveoli, disruption of a single program indi-
rectly disrupts closely coordinated, but distinct, processes? There is
some precedent for this model, since inhibition of VEGF in lung
development has been shown to result in reduced epithelial prolifer-
ation and impaired sacculation (Zhao et al, 2005). However, as we
show in the case of PDGF-Ra, the causal relationship may be more
direct, since VEGF-A is apparently produced not only by lung
epithelial cells, but also by myofibroblasts in response to PDGF and
its downstream signaling through JAK and STAT (Niu et al, 2002;
Yu & Jove, 2004). Perhaps this additional level of patterned VEGF-A
production is important for ensuring proper investment of newly
forming secondary septal walls by the microvascular network. In
any case, our demonstration of the therapeutic activity of exoge-
nously administered PDGF-A (Fig 7B) for rescuing both the air sac
septation and microvascular defects is highly promising, particularly
since previous attempts to improve vascularization by administering
exogenous VEGF-A not only failed to rescue nCLD, but actually
induced capillary leakage (Akeson et al, 2005).

out of this cohort were subjected to PDGF-Ra transcriptome analy-
sis in association with the presence of single nucleotide polymor-

Patient characteristics of this cohort are in Appendix Table S3C.
Sections from human lung were available through the Department
of Pediatric Surgery at the Erasmus Medical Center. Lung samples
were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology of
the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, following approval by the Erasmus
MC Medical Ethical Committee. Patient characteristics of this cohort
are in Appendix Table S3D. According to Dutch law following
consent to perform autopsy, no separate consent is needed from the
parents to perform additional staining of tissues. A group of 20
preterm infants from Giessen was subjected to microarray analysis
(Ethics Approval #File 79/01, Giessen, University of Giessen,
Germany). The clinical course of all infants was comprehensively
monitored. Approval of the local ethics committee and written
informed parental consent was obtained for all samples studied.
All the experiments conformed to the principles set out in the
WMA Declaration of Helsinki and Department of Health and
Human Services Belmont Report. The limitation of human material
to be tested in case of neonatal chronic lung disease is well
known; hence, analysis was performed with samples available in
maximum
capacity.
Samples
were

randomly. Our datasets were obtained from subjects who have
consented to the use of their individual genetic data for biomedical
research, but not for unlimited public data release. Therefore, we

SNP and protein analysis
Cord blood samples of 1,061 preterm infants at or below 32 weeks
of gestational age (n = 492 BPD cases) were collected in ethylenedi-
aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) neonatal collection tubes. Genotypes
of this patient cohort for PDGF-Ra SNPs (single nucleotide polymor-
phisms) were determined using Affymetrix Axiom microarrays
based on the Axiom CEU array supplemented with some custom
content. Matched controls were selected according to gender, GA,
birth weight < 10th percentile, and country of maternal origin. Case–
control analysis adjusted for relatedness; 117 SNPs were measured
in or near the PDGF-Ra. Whole-blood samples collected from a
separate patient cohort (n = 13) that were analyzed for three signifi-
cant SNPs by Eurofins Genomics were subjected to proteomic
screening for PDGF-R and VEGF-A (SOMAscan
TM, SomaLogic, Boul-
der, USA). For a detailed description, please refer to Appendix Sup-
plementary Methods.
Human primary lung fibroblasts
Human primary lung fibroblasts were extracted from serial tracheal
aspirate samples obtained from ventilated preterm infants (mean
GA 24.9 � 1 weeks, n = 6) later developing nCLD, at 4.7 � 1 and
21.7 � 8 day of life (Ethics Approval #195-07, Munich, Ludwig
Maximillian’s university of Munich, Germany). Human lung fibrob-
lasts were cultured until 80% confluency in DMEM medium with
2 mM L-glutamine, Pen/Strep, and 20% FCS (PAN Biotech GmbH).

250–300 ll of whole cord blood was obtained from 20 preterm
infants 72 h after birth and directly transferred to 750–900 ll of the
PAXgene Blood RNA System (PreAnalytiX, Heidelberg, Germany).
RNA was isolated using PAXgene Blood RNA System (PreAnalytiX)
and was subjected to CodeLink Human Whole Genome Bioarrays
(GE Healthcare). PDGF-Ra gene expression in GWAS patient cohort
was measured by the expression of NM_006206 on the human
whole genome bioarray and human 10 k I bioarray by Codelink. For
details of blood sampling and RNA analysis, please refer to

Human lung slides
Human slides were obtained from paraformaldehyde-fixed and
paraffin-embedded autopsy lungs from preterm infants with dif-
ferent BPD grades (n = 7) and an infant that died from a non-
pulmonary cause. Tissue sections were stained for PDGF-Ra and
TGF-b for further quantification. Please refer to Appendix Supple-
mentary Methods for details of patient characteristics.
In vivo studies
All the studies were performed as per ARRIVE guidelines.
Gene-targeted mice
Gene-targeted mice (B6.129S4-Pdgfratm11(EGFP)Sor/J) referred to in
manuscript as PDGF-Ra+/� or PDGF-Ra haploinsufficient mice were
purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
Heterozygous mice are healthy and viable and reported to have no
lung abnormalities (Hamilton et al, 2003). Co-staining for PDGF-Ra
and a-SMA showed a reduction in myofibroblasts (double-positive),
and mRNA and immunoblot analysis confirmed the reduced abun-
dance of pulmonary PDGF-Ra expression in unventilated PDGF-
Ra+/� mice when compared to WT littermates (Fig EV1A–C). For
the study, 5–8-day-old neonatal mice both males and females were
used. The experimental protocols were approved by the Bavarian
government (TVA no. 55.2-1-54-2532-117-2010). The mice were
kept under specified pathogen-free (SPF) conditions in a 12/12-h
light cycle in the fully climate-controlled rooms having set points to
the new conventions 2007/526 EC in our central mouse facility.
Mice had a 2-week adaptation phase to their new environment and
a handling by new nurses before putting them into the experiment.
For each experiment, appropriate sample size (n = 6–12) was esti-
mated considering the effect of MV-O2 on viability of newborn mice.
Mechanical ventilation
We used 5–8-day-old (newborn/neonatal) C57B6 wild-type (PDGF-
Ra+/+) and PDGF-Ra haploinsufficient (PDGF-Ra+/�) mice, all born
at term gestation weighing 4 g [WT 3.98 � 0.55 g; PDGF-Ra+/�
3.93 � 0.66 g bodyweight (bw)] to perform experiments in four
groups of mice (14–16 mice per group). WT and PDGF-Ra+/� pups
received mechanical ventilation with oxygen-rich gas (40% O2)
(MV-O2) for 8 h at 180 breaths/min (MicroVent 848; Harvard Appa-
ratus) after tracheotomy under sedation with ketamine and xylazine
(60 and 12 lg/g bw), as previously described (Hilgendorff et al,
2011). The ventilator setting mimicked the clinical setting to avoid
severe lung injury (mean tidal volume 8 ll/g bw; mean airway pres-
sure (11–12 cmH2O)). Tidal volumes were similar between the MV-
O2 groups (WT 8.3 � 0.5 ll/g bw; PDGF-Ra+/� 7.9 � 0.3 ll/g bw).
The ventilation protocol was designed to avoid severe lung injury
typically occurring in response to MV with very high inflation pres-
sures and extreme hyperoxia. Hence, we used modest tidal volumes
(mean 8.7 ll/g bw) and airway pressures (peak 12–13 cmH2O, mean
11–12 cmH2O), and limited the FiO2 to 40%, thereby simulating the
MV strategy of choice for preterm infants with respiratory failure.
Respective controls spontaneously breathed 40% O2 for 8 h after
receiving sham surgery (superficial neck incision) under mild seda-
tion. During MV-O2, mice were maintained at neutral thermal envi-
ronment; sedation with ketamine and xylazine (10 lg/g bw and
2 lg/g bw, respectively) was repeated as needed to minimize spon-
taneous movement and assure comfort. At the end of each study,
pups were euthanized with an intraperitoneal overdose of sodium
pentobarbital, ~150 lg/g bw, and lungs were excised for various
studies as described below including histological analysis, as well as
protein measurement and RNA expression analysis from frozen lung
tissue. For PDGF-A treatment, 10 ll/g bw of sterile saline containing
25 ng/ml PDGF-A was administered through the endotracheal tube
immediately before the onset of MV-O2 as described previously. In a
subgroup of mice with or without PDGF-A treatment, tidal volume
and maximum tracheal pressure (Ptramax) was measured by whole-
body plethysmography (Pulmodyn, Harvard Apparatus). Stepwise
increase in the tidal volume allowed to assess quasi-static compli-
ance (Hilgendorff et al, 2011).
All animals were viable with response to tactile stimulation and
adequate perfusion at the end of each experiment. All surgical and
animal care procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee (Bavarian Government).
Upon ventilation, both the mouse strains showed similar activation
of pSMAD-2, while neonatal PDGF-Ra+/� mice displayed increased
apoptosis when compared to wild-type mice (Fig EV3A–C). Alloca-
tion of the newborn mice to the groups was performed on the basis
of similarity in weight and age. When newborn mice from more
than one cage were used for the experiments, all pups were random-
ized before distribution in the groups. Investigators were blinded for
the sex of mice during allocation. Further, the analysis of lungs was
performed based on internal serial numbers allotted to mice blind-
ing the investigator for genetic background and treatment (e.g.,
controls or ventilated). All experimental procedures were carried
out in a laboratory-controlled environment during daytime.

Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis
After 8 h of MV-O2, protein extraction from snap-frozen total lungs
was done using high urea buffer (KPO4, Urea, AppliChem) with
Halt
Protease
Inhibitor
(#1861280,
Thermo
Fisher

Primary lung fibroblasts were lysed with RIPA buffer with Halt
Protease Inhibitor (mouse) or sodium vanadate (human) (#S6508,
Sigma) and complete mini (#11836170001, Roche) followed by
sonication. After measurement of protein concentrations (BCA,
#23227, Pierce Scientific), immunoblots were performed using a
Bis-Tris or a Tris-Acetate gel (#NP0321BOX, #EA0375BOX, Life
Technologies) using the following antibodies: PDGF-Ra (C-20,
Santa

#Ab2349), VE-cadherin (H-72, Santa Cruz Biotechnology #28644),
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology #9661), cleaved
caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technologies #7237), eNOS (Cell Signal-
ing Technologies #5880), phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technolo-
gies #4370), total ERK (Cell Signaling Technologies #4695), RAS
(Cell Signaling Technologies #8955), PI3K (Cell Signaling Tech-
nologies #13666), JAK-2 (Cell Signaling Technologies #3230),
STAT-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies #9139). Images were detected
by chemiluminescence (#RPN2232, GE Healthcare) and quantified
by densitometry (Bio Rad). Details of immunoblot analysis could
be found in Appendix Supplementary Methods.
In vitro experiments
Mouse primary pulmonary myofibroblasts
Mouse myofibroblasts (MFBs) were extracted by excising lungs of
5–7-day-old C57BL6 wild-type mice after intraperitoneal overdose of
sodium pentobarbital (~150 lg/g bodyweight). Under sterile condi-
tions, lungs were flushed with PBS after cannulation of the right
ventricle. Flushed lungs were then excised, diced into 1-mm pieces,
and distributed on a petri dish (Corning #430167, Tewksbury, MA,
USA). Attachment to the dish was accomplished by incubation for
15–20 min at 37°C. Afterward, the tissue pieces were gently
submerged in media (Gibco #41966-029, Darmstadt, Germany)
containing Pen/Strep (Gibco, #15140-122) and Gentamycin (Lonza
#BE02-012E, Basel, Switzerland) for 48 h before changing to fresh
media. Experiments were started at 70–80% confluency. Myofibrob-
lasts were characterized with fluorescence-activated cell sorter
(FACS
LSRII)
using
multicolor
staining
technique.
Briefly
myofibroblasts
were
resuspended
in
FACS
buffer
(PBS + 2%
FCS + 10 mM HEPES + 0.1% Na-Azide) and stained with CD90.2
APC FITC (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany #561974), CD 105
PE
(BD
Pharmingen
#562759),
CD45
FITC
(BD
Pharmingen
#553080),
CD11b
V450
(BD
horizon,
Heidelberg,
Germany
#560455), CD11c PerCpCy5.5 (Biolegend, Fell, Germany #117328).
For detection of internal markers, myofibroblasts were fixed with
4% PFA (Alfa Aesar GmbH, Germany #43368) followed by perme-
abilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Carl Roth GmbH + Co.KG, Karl-
sruhe, Germany #3051.2) and blocking with 1% BSA (Sigma) in
PBS. Myofibroblasts were then stained in blocking solution with
PDGF-Ra APC (eBiosciences #17-1401-81), a-Smooth Muscle Actin
PE (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA #IC1420P), and Vimentin
Alexa 488. Stained myofibroblasts were then acquired through BD
TM
LSR II utilizing BD FACSDiva
TM software version 6.0 and analyzed
using Flowjo version 9.6.1. As displayed in Appendix Fig S3B,
myofibroblast culture constituted leukocytes (0.6 � 0.5% CD45+),
mesenchymal-like cells (8.5 � 4.5% CD105+, 32 � 8.6% CD90+),
and
myofibroblasts
(77.2 � 14%
PDGF-Ra+/Vimentin+,
16.7 � 12% Vimentin+, and 77.6 � 27% aSMA+). Antibodies used
were CD45 (BD Pharmingen #553080), CD105 (BD Pharmingen
#562759), CD90 (BD Pharmingen #561974), PDGF-Ra (eBiosciences
#17-1401), Vimentin (Cell Signaling #9854), and a-SMA (R&D
systems #IC1420P).
Mechanical stretch
Myofibroblasts were seeded on flexible-bottomed laminin-coated
culture plates (#BF-3001L, Flex Cell International Corporation) and
stretched at 70–80% confluency (shape/sine; elongation min 0%,
max 8%; frequency 2 Hz; duty cycle 50%; cycles 43216) for 24 h. A
detailed description of mechanical stretch experiment is available in
the Appendix Supplementary Methods.
Protein analysis
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer including Halt Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (mouse myofibroblasts) or sodium vanadate (catalog
#S6508, Sigma) and complete mini (Roche, Penzberg, Germany
#11836170001; human lung fibroblasts). After storage at �80°C, cell
lysates were sonicated and processed for immunoblot analysis (as
described in “in vivo” methods).
siRNA transfection of pulmonary mouse myofibroblasts
Primary neonatal mouse myofibroblasts were transfected with
either
100 nM
specific
siRNA
against
PDGF-Ra
(Santa
Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Germany #sc-29444) or 100 nM control siRNA
B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-44230) suspended in TurboFect
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific,
Waltham,
MA,
USA
#R0531)
or
remained untreated controls in siRNA transfection media (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., #sc-36868). Transfection with siRNA was
repeated after 17 h.

(HUVECs; Commercially obtained from Lonza #CC-2935) were
cultured in EBM-2 Basal Media (#00190860, #cc-4176, Lonza, myco-
plasma free) with EGM-2 Single Quots supplements (Lonza #cc-
4176) on 0.2% gelatin (Sigma Aldrich #G1393)-coated 96-well plates
(5,000 cells/well) or 6-well plates (150,000 cells/well). After obtain-
ing stable culture conditions, HUVECs were incubated with culture
supernatants collected from three groups of mouse myofibroblasts:
(i) untreated myofibroblasts (TurboFect), (ii) control siRNA-treated
myofibroblasts, and (iii) myofibroblasts treated with siRNA against
PDGF-Ra. For caspase activity assay, incubation with 40 lg/ml anti-
VEGF (C-1) antibody (#sc-7269, Santa Cruz) served as a positive
control. Caspase activity was assessed after 6 h using the Caspase-
Glo 3/7 assay kit (#G8091, Promega). After 6 h of incubation,
caspase activity was assessed using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit
(Promega GmbH, Germany #G8091) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Cells plated in 6-well plate were lysed after 6-h
incubation, and lysate was processed for immunoblot analysis with
cleaved caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technologies #9509) and eNOS
(Cell Signaling Technologies #880) protein.
Luciferase assay
PDGF-Ra promoter inserted in a reporter plasmid was transfected in
CCL206 stimulated with TGF-b1. Luciferase activity was assessed
the next day using dual luciferase assay. For generation of reporter,
please refer to Appendix Supplementary Methods.
Functional assays for myofibroblasts
Mouse and human myofibroblasts or lung fibroblasts were subjected
to analysis of proliferation (Cell titer Glo assay and manual count-
ing) and migration (Boyden chamber assay and scratch migration
assay) followed by the application of stretch and TGF-b as shown in
Appendix Fig S3C. Proliferation assay and scratch migration assay
were performed after 48 h of application, while migration assay was
done after 8 h. For detailed description of proliferation, Boyden
chamber and scratch migration assays please refer to Appendix
Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
All datasets are presented as mean � SD. Statistical analysis was
performed using Prism 5 and 6 software package (GraphPad, San
Diego, CA, USA). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post
hoc test with Bonferroni correction were performed to compare
controls
and
mechanically
ventilated
WT
(PDGF-Ra+/+)
and
haploinsufficient (PDGF-Ra+/�) newborn mice. For in vitro experi-
ments, one-way ANOVA and post hoc test with Bonferroni correc-
tion
were performed to
compare more
than
two groups
of
myofibroblasts (immunoblot, migration, and proliferation analysis).
For analysis of caspase activity to HUVECs, nonparametric Kruskal–
Wallis test was performed. To compare datasets from two groups of
either WT or PDGF-Ra+/� mice (immunoblot, migration and prolif-
eration analysis, reporter assays), parametric unpaired Student’s t-
test with Welch’s correction or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney
test (for datasets with a skewed distribution) was performed with
two-tailed or one-tailed analysis. Test groups were always compared
to control group. Differences were considered statistically significant
when the P-value was < 0.05. For microarray, data were analyzed in
a target gene approach using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient to
correlate expression of PDGF-Ra and TGF-b in preterm infants with
and without BPD. Correlation coefficients in preterm infants with
and without BPD were tested using the R-packages psych. Statistical
methods applied for the SNP analysis are outlined above.

The paper explained
Problem
Neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD) exhibits significant structural
alveolar and vascular defects and frequently occurs in susceptible
babies born prematurely and treated with mechanical ventilation with
oxygen-rich gas (MV-O2). Little is known about genetic risk factors or
the hierarchy of molecular and cellular events that drive nCLD, resulting
in serious health consequences for this significant patient population.
Results
This study demonstrates the significant association of SNPs in the
PDGF-Ra gene with the development of nCLD and show the func-
tional relevance of the genetic variants. Our data based on human
studies, our preclinical mouse model and extensive in vitro studies in
primary lung cells confirm that impaired PDGF-Ra and its down-
stream signaling drives alveolar and microvascular injury induced by
MV-O2.
Impact
Findings derived from this study will impact the understanding of
nCLD pathophysiology and at the same time enable the development
of new treatment.
