Summary
Overuse, which is defined as the provision of medical services that are more likely to cause harm 
than good, is a global problem that afflicts rich and poor countries alike. This article reviews the 
definition of overuse, methods for measuring overuse, harms from overuse, and the evidence for 
worldwide overuse of many types of services.

 Introduction
Overuse, which Chassin and Galvin defined as the provision of medical services for which 
the potential for harm exceeds the potential for benefit,1 is increasingly recognized around 
the world. Directly measuring overuse requires a definition of appropriate care, which is 
often challenging. In the United States, estimates of spending on overuse vary widely: 
conservative estimates based on direct measurement of individual services range from 6% to 
8% of total health care spending,2 while studies of geographic variation (an indirect 
measure) put the proportion of Medicare spending on overuse closer to 29%.3 Around the 
world, overuse of some individual services may be as high as 80% of cases (see Figure 2: 
Overuse of Selected Services in Four Countries).4 While overuse has been best documented 
in high-income countries (HICs), low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not 
immune, and evidence suggestive of widespread overuse is accumulating from countries and 
health systems as diverse as Australia,5 Spain,6 Israel,7 Brazil,8 and Iran.9 Overuse can 
coexist with unmet health needs, particularly in LMICs.
The purpose of this paper is to highlight the significance of the problem of overuse and 
explore what is known about its scope and consequences around the world. We draw on five 
systematic reviews 4,10–13 on overuse to help inform this paper, supplemented with pearling 
of reference lists and additional structured searches of scientific and grey literature. 
Subsequent papers in this series examine underuse around the world, the causes of overuse 
and underuse, and potential remedies for both.
What is overuse?
“Though the doctors treated him, let his blood, and gave him medications to drink, 
he nevertheless recovered.”
- Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace
While Chassin and Galvin’s definition of overuse is succinct, and may have broad intuitive 
appeal, it is difficult to operationalize. To directly measure overuse requires a definition of 
appropriateness for a service, based on evidence for the balance of benefits and harms for a 
population or individuals. However, quantifying benefits and harms is often problematic, 
because evidence of benefits is often incomplete; for many services, harms have been poorly 
documented;14 and the threshold between appropriate and inappropriate care may vary 
among patients or groups of patients. In addition, the role of costs in defining low value 
services varies in different settings (see Box 1: The role of cost in defining overuse and low-
value services).
BOX 1
The role of cost in defining overuse and low-value services
Eliminating clearly ineffective services would reduce both potential harm to patients and 
excess costs, since ineffective treatments and tests cannot be cost effective. Unfortunately, 
clearly ineffective services are greatly outnumbered by grey-zone interventions. Many 
grey-zone interventions benefit very few patients or provide only small benefit relative to 
Brownlee et al.

 costs, and thus are not cost effective. Paying for such low-value services poses an 
opportunity cost, leaving less money available for addressing unmet health needs and 
reducing funds to improve the socio-economic determinants of health. While cost-
effectiveness analysis, which can quantify these tradeoffs, is formally considered in 
coverage decisions in some HICs, such as Australia, Canada and the UK 21–23 and in an 
increasing number of LMICs, 24 it is not included in appropriateness determinations in 
the US. 25
Ultimately, overuse can be thought to occur along a continuum of services. At one end lie 
tests and treatments that are universally beneficial when used on the appropriate patient, 
such as blood cultures in a young otherwise healthy patient with sepsis, and insulin for 
patients with Type 1 diabetes. At the other end of the continuum are services that are entirely 
ineffective, futile, or pose such high risk of harm to all patients they should never be 
delivered, such as the drug combination fenfluramine-phentermine for obesity.15 Most tests 
and treatments fall into a more nebulous grey zone, 16,17 which includes: services that offer 
scant benefit to most patients (e.g. glucosamine for osteoarthritis of the knee); those for 
which the balance of benefits and harms varies substantially among patients (e.g. opioids for 
chronic pain, antidepressant medications for adolescents); and the many services that are 
backed by little evidence to help decide which patients, if any, might benefit and by how 
much (e.g. routine blood testing in patients with hypertension). 18 (See Figure 1: Grey Zone 
Services.) Even when robust consensus processes have led to criteria defining 
appropriateness of tests and treatments (such as those developed for cardiology services in 
the U.S.), appropriateness can remain uncertain in many individual cases.19
Chassin and Galvin’s simple formulation is further muddied by the question of whose values 
and preferences should determine the balance between potential benefits and acceptable 
harms. Certainly different patients facing a choice among potentially beneficial treatments 
will vary in their views of the tradeoffs of each.20 Thus individual patients’ values and 
preferences may be critical for defining appropriate care for many conditions in the grey 
zone. Unfortunately clinicians often have poor understanding of patient values, incorrectly 
assuming in some cases that a patient prefers to avoid aggressive or invasive intervention, 
and in others that the patient wants more rather than less care. This “preference 
misdiagnosis” contributes to overuse (and underuse) when clinicians deliver a service that is 
wrong for that individual patient.
Measuring overuse
Overuse can be measured in a variety of ways. Overuse of a specific service can be 
measured directly in a population, using patient registries or medical records. This approach 
requires a reliable definition of appropriateness for a given service, generally using an 
evidence- or consensus-based guideline, or a multidisciplinary iterative panel process (e.g. 
the RAND Appropriateness Method) to define necessary and unnecessary use. Rates of 
overuse are then calculated as either the proportion of delivered services that are 
inappropriate or as the proportion of patients with a disorder who receive the service 
inappropriately. This direct measure is the most reliable indicator of overuse, and a growing

 body of literature, including several systematic reviews, 4,10–13 have employed it. There are, 
however, several challenges inherent in this approach when applied to many health care 
interventions.12 First, as discussed above, evidence for defining appropriate care is lacking 
in many clinical situations, precluding direct measurement of overuse of those services. 
Second, even if evidence is available, guidelines often lack necessary details for defining the 
appropriateness of care in individual patients, while iterative panel processes, which 
incorporate more nuance, are costly and time consuming. Electronic health records (EHR), 
and the development of large datasets informed by clinical information from EHRs has 
facilitated measurement of overuse in some contexts (e.g. the U.S. Veteran’s Affairs 
system26,27) and may have broader applicability in the future. However, EHRs alone are not 
likely to enable widespread direct measurement of overuse.
A growing literature seeks to expand knowledge of overuse through an indirect measure: 
identifying unexpected variations in health care utilization. Variations in utilization which 
are not attributable to differences in patient or population characteristics have been 
documented both within and among countries and health systems.1–5,8,28,29 While these 
variations are often not related to overuse (or underuse) per se, but rather to different rates of 
discretionary care (or services for which the evidence does not point clearly to a right 
answer,16 such as revisit interval for diabetics), unexpectedly high rates of use of a particular 
service can reflect overuse.6,7 In more recent years, investigators have used large databases 
to explore variations in the use of specific services as a method for documenting probable 
overuse.30,31 Table 1 provides examples of both direct and indirect evidence documenting 
overuse of specific services around the world. Some investigators have moved beyond 
individual services to evaluate rates of general overuse in a system by evaluating variations 
in the use of groups of possibly overused services, 5,32–34 but these methods are not yet well 
established.
Related concepts
We use the term “overuse” to refer to any services that are unnecessary in any way and for 
any reason. The related terms, “overtreatment” and “overtesting,” indicate the inappropriate 
delivery of particular types of services.
Another related term, overdiagnosis, is commonly described as the diagnostic labeling of 
abnormalities or symptoms that are indolent, non-progressive or regressive, and that if left 
untreated or treated later will not cause significant distress or shorten the person’s life.35 
This definition can be complicated by the varying natural history of specific diseases, and 
does not entirely encompass the various settings in which overdiagnosis occurs or the role it 
plays in overuse. 36 Overdiagnosis can occur as a consequence of screening (including 
recommended screening). For some screening tests, such as cervical cancer screening,37 the 
small risk of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment are outweighed by the reduction in 
risk of death. For other screening tests, however, the balance is less clear38 and 
overdiagnosis may be a significant driver of overuse in the form of aggressive overtreatment 
of clinically insignificant findings.5,39 (Paper 3 in this series, “Drivers of Poor Medical 
Care,” will discuss in greater detail overdiagnosis and other drivers of overuse, such as 
defensive medicine, which has been associated with aggressive diagnostic testing in the

 U.S.40 and has been identified by physicians in several countries41–43 as an important reason 
for overusing tests and treatments.)
Overdiagnosis can also result when the definition of disease or abnormality is widened, 
leading to populations previously considered “normal” or healthy being labeled as diseased. 
This phenomenon is referred to as overmedicalization (or in some cases disease mongering) 
and can result in treatment of essentially healthy patients in whom potential benefit is small 
and likely to be outweighed by harms. A review of recent US guidelines showed that for ten 
of the 16 guidelines studied, disease definition had been widened, potentially leading to 
overuse.44 Lowering risk thresholds for treating cholesterol has led to a growing proportion 
of populations in many countries being prescribed lipid-lowering drugs with unclear 
benefit.45,46 A broadened definition of chronic kidney disease that is used in many countries, 
while potentially beneficial for ensuring safe drug dosing, has led to large numbers of 
asymptomatic older people being labeled as ill; as many as 30% of older adults diagnosed 
with moderately advanced kidney disease (stage 3A) have no urine markers of kidney 
damage.47 In children, overdiagnosis can occur in such frequently diagnosed conditions as 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), bacteremia, food allergy, 
hyperbilirubinemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and urinary tract infection.48
Worldwide prevalence of overuse
There is increasing recognition that overuse is a problem around the world, but how 
significant the problem is has not yet been defined. A 2012 systematic review of the 
prevalence of the overuse of services in the US noted that the majority of studies that 
directly measured overuse were focused on a relatively small number of services.12 
However, indirect evidence, such as studies of geographic variation, suggests that overuse is 
not limited to these services in the U.S. 71 A more recent systematic review4 of global 
overuse categorized 83 overused or low-value services from studies including large sample 
sizes (more than 800 patients).27,72–95 These authors identified studies from four countries 
(with US studies predominating) and found that rates of overuse of various services ranged 
from about 1 to 80 percent (see Figure 2). For many HICs and for LMICs, the evidence of 
overuse is sparser and largely indirect, though it appears to be growing. (See for example a 
2014 report on geographic variation in health care in 13 countries.51) Below, we describe 
rates of overuse around the world of a selection of clinical services. We focused our 
attention on services that have been most commonly described in systematic reviews and 
other literature, and services whose overuse has the potential for significant impact on 
patients or health systems.
Overuse of Medications
One of the best-documented examples of overuse of medications in both HICs and LMICs is 
the inappropriate use of antibiotics, a worldwide problem with significant consequences for 
antimicrobial resistance. Many studies have addressed inappropriate antibiotic use in 
patients with viral upper respiratory infections. A 2012 systematic review of overuse in the 
US system found 59 studies documenting widely variable rates of overuse of antibiotics for 
upper respiratory infections.12 In Europe, there are high rates of antibiotic prescribing for

 viral URIs in Poland, Sweden, and the UK with half of patients receiving unnecessary 
antibiotics,96–98 and across the continent studies have documented variable rates of 
antibiotic prescribing for patients with acute cough, with no associated differences in rates of 
recovery,99 suggesting overuse.
Evidence of antibiotic overuse in LMICs is largely indirect. Global consumption of 
antibiotic drugs increased by 36% between 2000 and 2010, with emerging economies such 
as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa accounting for 76% of this increase.100 The 
extent to which this increase represents overuse is not known, though a 2015 systematic 
review of medication use in China and Vietnam found evidence for antibiotic overuse in 
both countries13 and a 2005 systematic review 11 of patterns of antibiotic use, which 
included studies from around the globe, found high rates of inappropriate use including 
substantial patient use of “leftover” antibiotics. Similarly, a 2013 Cochrane review of the 
effect of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing for hospitalised patients included 
studies from both HICs and LMICs, suggesting wide recognition of the problem of 
inappropriate antibiotic use, though the review did not directly quantify rates.101
In other clinical arenas, unexpectedly high rates of prescribing of specific drugs in individual 
health systems suggest overuse. Bevacizumab, an expensive and generally ineffective 
treatment for breast cancer, is not recommended by the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK and its US Food and Drug Administration marketing 
authorisation for breast cancer was withdrawn. However, the drug is reimbursed by health 
insurers in Colombia for all (licensed and unlicensed) cancer indications at great expense to 
the country’s health care system.102 Similarly, erythropoiesis stimulating agents such as 
epoetin a and b and darbapoetin have been widely and inappropriately used in Romania to 
treat ribavirin-induced anaemia in patients with Hepatitis C and organ transplantations in the 
absence of supporting evidence.103
Overuse of screening tests
High rates of inappropriate use of screening tests have been documented, often in the context 
of concurrent underuse of the test in appropriate populations. In the US, where there is 
widespread public support for cancer screening,104 there has been documented overuse of 
screening for cervical cancer 105,106 in very low risk women and of mammography in 
women with limited life expectancy who are unlikely to benefit from diagnosis and 
treatment. 107 Inappropriate use of screening colonoscopy has been found in both the US 
and Canada. 108–110
Few studies have evaluated rates of inappropriate cancer screening outside of North 
America. A notable exception is South Korea’s aggressive use of ultrasound screening, 
which has led to a 15-fold increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancers. The death rate 
from this cancer has remained unchanged over the period of increased screening, and it is 
estimated that 99.7–99.9% of screen-detected thyroid cancers in Korea represent 
overdiagnosis.111 Patients then subjected to unnecessary thyroidectomy face an 11% risk of 
hypoparathyroidism and 2% risk of vocal cord paralysis, demonstrating clear downstream 
harms of the inappropriate screening. Despite low levels of appropriate mammography 
screening and general doubts about the cost-effectiveness of mammograms,112 there are

 reports of touring mammography vans in India providing indiscriminate breast cancer 
screening in women as young as 18 years old,113 much of which represents clear overuse.
Overuse of diagnostic tests
Overuse of testing appears to be common, driven by availability, apparent objectiveness, and 
the increasing sensitivity of tests to detect disease. Despite few systematic analyses of 
inappropriate use of diagnostic tests in general, some specific diagnostic services have been 
evaluated around the world. Overuse of endoscopy, for instance, appears to be common 
globally. In primary care practices in Switzerland, 14% of colonoscopy referrals and 49% of 
referrals for upper endoscopy represented overuse.114,115 Elsewhere in Europe, 
appropriateness rates for endoscopy have been reported in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and 
Norway, with overuse accounting for between 13% and 33% of tests, 116–119 and at an 
Israeli center 16% of endoscopies were unnecessary.120 Studies in the US have reported 
overuse rates as high as 60%121. In Saudi Arabia, which has open access to endoscopy, 
nearly half of procedures were inappropriate.122 Interestingly, a Dutch study found that only 
about a quarter of patients received appropriate colonoscopy after removal of colorectal 
adenomas, with both overuse and underuse of needed surveillance observed.123
Overuse of therapeutic procedures
Surgery and other invasive procedures are likely to be commonly overused in high-income 
countries. Though rates of directly-measured overuse were not reported, Elshaug and 
colleagues identified more than 150 “low-value” services in use in Australia,5 and in the US, 
up to 42% of Medicare beneficiaries were found to have received at least one of 26 low-
value treatments, with these low-value interventions accounting for 2.7% of overall 
Medicare spending. 32 Such findings are suggestive of widespread overuse of these services.
There is ample data from around the world on the overuse of several cardiovascular 
procedures, despite clear and broadly accepted appropriateness criteria.124 Inappropriate 
percutaneous coronary intervention has been documented in many countries, with 
prevalence of 4–12% in the US; 55,125 10%–14% in Germany, 126,127 16% in Italy; 128 22% 
in Israel;7 20% in Spain; 6 and 3.7% in Korea. 129 In one second-opinion centre in India, 
55% of recommended cardiac stents or surgery were deemed inappropriate. 58
Site of care delivery
The site of care delivery and the intensity of care provided are relevant to overuse since more 
intense care poses greater risk of complications (and is more costly). If more intense care 
does not improve outcomes for a condition compared with less invasive or intensive care, it 
represents overuse. Hospital care has been found to be overused in both HICs and LMICs. A 
2000 systematic review 10 of the appropriateness of hospital admissions found widely 
varying rates of inappropriate hospitalizations around the world, ranging from 1% to 54% of 
hospitalizations. Rates of overuse of hospital care in specific countries (using established 
criteria to determine appropriateness) were 18–25% in France,130 33% in Germany,131 19% 
among internal medicine admissions in Portugal,132 7.4% at a referral center in Spain,133 
27% in rural hospitals in China,134 and widely variability across three Egyptian hospitals, 
with rates between 0% and 79%.135 In addition, studies have shown wide variations in rates

 of hospital use both within and among countries,136,137 suggesting possible overuse as well 
as underuse of hospital care in different locations. Many of these variations are particularly 
striking with regard to “ambulatory care-sensitive” conditions, or conditions for which high-
quality primary care is likely to prevent the need for hospitalization.138 Overuse of 
hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions demonstrates that overuse of one 
(usually more aggressive) service can result from underuse of another, often less aggressive, 
service.
End of life care
In many countries, evidence exists for the overuse of aggressive care for dying patients and 
simultaneous underuse of appropriate palliative care. Despite evidence that the majority of 
people around the world prefer to die at home, 139–144 about half die in hospital worldwide, 
with considerable variation among countries. 145 Inappropriately aggressive cancer care near 
the end of life has been identified as a common problem in Canada,146 the US,147 and the 
UK 148 with regional variations observed.147 Overuse of aggressive end-of-life care in the 
UK, for example, has included futile insertion of PEG tubes 149 and administration of 
chemotherapy that hastens death, 150 while futile ICU care at the end of life has been 
reported in Canada,151 the US, 152 and Brazil. 153 A study from Korea found that the 
majority of terminal cancer patients received futile intravenous nutrition in the last week of 
life, with discussions of palliation in only 7% of cases. 154
While few systematic assessments of end-of-life care have been performed in LMICs, futile 
care at the end of life is likely not limited to high-income countries. In one study in India, 
nearly half of cancer patients were diagnosed late and received futile radiotherapy.155 In 
Brazil, one in five cancer patients was taking a useless medication, most often a statin.156 
Overall it is likely that overuse of aggressive care and underuse of palliative care at the end 
of life is commonplace in both HICs and LMICs.
Harms to patients and health systems
Overuse is likely to harm patients physically, psychologically and financially, and could 
threaten the viability of health systems by driving up costs and diverting resources. However, 
our ability to collect strong evidence describing the direct consequences of overuse on 
patients and health systems has been impeded by the same factors that challenge our ability 
to document overuse itself, including an incomplete evidence base for effectiveness and little 
reporting of harms from treatments.157 Much of what we know about harms of overuse 
derives from estimates and extrapolations.
Harms to patients
There are few studies directly documenting patient harms from overuse, though some 
estimates of the rate of physical harm to patients from overuse can be inferred from data on 
adverse events and studies of overuse of specific treatments. For example, Cushner et. al 
used outcomes from a global orthopaedic registry for total knee and hip arthroplasty to 
estimate a rate of 7–8% for serious adverse events (including severe infection, revision, 
cardiovascular events and death).158 Other researchers estimate that more than 20% of total 
Brownlee et al.

 knee replacements in Spain and 30% in the US are inappropriate. 50,159 Thus we can 
estimate that 2–3% of patients undergoing arthroplastic surgery in those two countries are 
unnecessarily harmed by an inappropriate procedure, with approximately 14,000 patients 
suffering harm from unnecessary knee and hip arthroplasty per year in the US alone. Other 
examples of documented harm from overuse include high rates of overuse of implantable 
vena cava filters and low rates of appropriate removal,160 with known excess venous 
thrombotic complications in 10% of patients who receive them;161 and continued overuse of 
tight glycemic control in the intensive care unit despite evidence of higher rates of 
hypoglycemic complications without reductions in mortality.162
Psychological harms from overuse have been documented for few clinical situations but may 
be common. Several authors have noted that hospitalized patients may be physically isolated 
unnecessarily,163 with negative consequences including loneliness, feelings of 
stigmatization, and depression.164 Screening for breast cancer is known to lead to diagnosis 
of precancerous lesions such as ductal carcinoma in situ,165 which has been associated with 
anxiety for several years after the diagnosis and patient overestimation of future cancer 
risk.166–168
Patients can also suffer from being inappropriately labeled as “ill” as a result of unnecessary 
testing. As early as 1967, Bergman and Stamm found that among adolescents with heart 
murmurs which had been previously (and possibly unnecessarily) evaluated and deemed 
“innocent,” 40% continued to be subjected to restricted activity and 63% had parents who 
continued to believe their child to be unhealthy. 169 Harm from labeling can also occur in the 
context of mental illness. For example, ADHD is widely acknowledged to be overdiagnosed 
and overtreated in the US and other HICs, and is also overtreated in some LMICs 170 (even 
as some children with ADHD fail to receive appropriate treatment). There is scant research 
on the impact of an ADHD diagnosis on childrens’ sense of self-esteem and ability to 
modulate their own behavior, but the label has been shown to impact teacher expectations 
and peer interactions, which can substantially influence children’s self-perceptions. 171–173
Financial costs represent a potentially important but poorly documented source of harm from 
overuse to patients. In the US, cost has been framed as a known consequence of all medical 
care 174 and of cancer treatment in particular,175 with medical bills contributing to over half 
of personal bankruptcies,176 although the contribution of overuse is not known. Similarly, in 
Australia, parents of children with cancer reported high out of pocket expenses,177 and the 
World Health Organization has decried “medical indebtedness” across the globe. Health care 
is a major source of impoverishment and indebtedness among the poor of India 178,179 and 
15% of rural Vietnamese families with one member with a chronic illness experience 
financial catastrophe.180 Determining the financial burden of overuse on patients requires 
active investigation in the future.
Harms to health care systems
While there are few direct measurements of the proportion of health care spending 
attributable to overuse, evidence is emerging to suggest the cost may be considerable. A 
study of inappropriate use of bone scans for US Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer 
found that 21% and 48% of patients at low and moderate risk of bony metastases underwent

 at least one scan, despite recommendations against scanning in these groups, at a cost of 
$11,300,000 annually.181 High rates of overuse are estimated by experts to contribute 
substantially to health care spending in the US (and to its mediocre quality);182 based on a 
conservative estimate, the US spent at least $270 billion on overuse in 2013 2 (even as 
millions of Americans lack adequate access to basic health care). Overuse may also strains 
health care budgets in other countries.183 In Australia, where many common services are 
believed to be overused,5 the growth in health care expenditure from the rising volume of 
medical services has been identified as the greatest threat to the financial position of the 
government, and a bigger cause of health cost increases than population growth or 
ageing.184
Of particular concern is the potential financial impact of overuse on LMICs. The use of 
expensive advanced technology in HICs, such as new cancer biologics, imaging devices, and 
multi-focal cataract replacement lenses, spreads through globalized markets to LMICs, 
potentially crowding out less technological (and potentially higher value) means of 
promoting population health.185 In India, for example, private health insurance and formal 
sector employees’ insurance programs cover expensive cancer drugs for a tenth of the 
country’s population, even as the general population does not have access to many basic 
health interventions.178 While the extent to which the use of expensive services represents 
true overuse as opposed to lower-value care from a public health perspective is not clear, 
overuse is a potential threat both to the viability of public budgets and to population health 
in LMICs.
Worldwide trends in overuse
Is overuse getting better or worse? It is a difficult question to answer for a number of 
reasons. First, we are only beginning to conceptualize overuse as a general system problem 
and to develop system-level metrics.186 There are no measures in general use. Second, 
health care systems are complex and dynamic;187 reducing or eliminating overuse of one 
service or in one site of care can encourage overuse in another.
We do know that there has been increased attention among health ministers, clinicians, 
policy makers and the public to overuse during the last 5 to 10 years, particularly in HICs 
but also in some LMICs. However, awareness of the problem has not automatically led 
clinicians to deliver the right care. In the US, for example, concerns about caesarean delivery 
rates have existed for decades but rates continued to rise (from 21% in 1996 to 31% in 
2006 188). Despite longstanding concerns about overuse of imaging with CT and MRI, their 
use has increased by 8% to 10% annually between 1996 and 2010.189
In LMICs, overuse appears to be on the rise, at least for certain services. For example, rates 
of caesarean delivery rose from 19% to 49% among low-risk deliveries in Tanzania between 
2000 and 2011,190 with rates also rising over time in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. 191 
Financial incentives and government policies can contribute to dramatic overuse. In China, 
government cuts in subsidies led hospitals to charge patients for care, 192,193 potentially 
contributing to notably high rates of cesarean delivery (46% in one study in a rural area).194

 industry and diagnostic centres, there are reports from India of inappropriate use of drugs, 
diagnostic tests and procedures, 195 including strikingly high rates of hysterectomies.196 
These trends appear to be recent and likely reflect increases in overuse over the last decade, 
but there are few data documenting longitudinal changes.
Wealthy countries are experimenting with specific initiatives to address overuse, such as 
NICE’s “do not do” list, 197 attention to low-value practices in Australia, 5 and the Choosing 
Wisely® campaign, 198 but there are few studies in either HICs or LMICs addressing the 
impact of such initiatives. Additionally, EHRs have been used as tools to reduce overuse 
locally199 and could be employed more broadly in the future. The last paper in this series, 
“Levers for Addressing Medical Underuse and Overuse: Achieving High-Value Health 
Care,” reviews efforts around the world to reduce overuse.
Conclusion
There is strong evidence of widespread overuse of several specific services in multiple 
countries, suggesting that overuse is common around the world and may be growing. 
However, this paper highlights a key challenge: measuring overuse and developing robust 
evidence for its prevalence in health services and patient populations. There is a clear need 
for a research agenda to develop that evidence.14 Given that overuse likely causes harm to 
both patients and health systems, physicians, politicians and policy-makers in both HICs and 
LMICs must understand overuse and act to reduce it.

 Key Messages
1.
Overuse is difficult to measure and has not been well characterized.
2.
Most studies of overuse come from high-income countries, but there is 
growing evidence that overuse is a global problem.
3.
Overuse likely causes patients physical, psychological and financial harm.
4.
Overuse deflects resources from public health and other social spending in 
both poor and wealthy countries.
5.
Overuse occurs across a wide range of medical specialties.

 Figure 1. Grey Zone Services
Some medical tests and treatments are of clear benefit, and some are clearly ineffective and 
therefore offer only net harm. There is clear underuse of effective services, and clear overuse 
of ineffective services. Many services fall into a more nebulous grey zone, where evidence is 
lacking, or the services is delivered to inappropriate patients, or to patients who are poorly 
informed.

 Figure 2. Overuse of Selected Services in Four Countries
Figure 2 explanatory note: Estimates from the literature of the proportion of patients that 
received various low-value services, out of the relevant patient population. The populations 
are based in four locations (US: circle/green, Canada: triangle/orange, Australia: diamond/
purple, Sweden: upside-down triangle/pink). Abbreviations: Patients (pts); with (w); cancer 
(cn); imaging (img); preoperative (preop); total knee arthroplasty (TKA); lower back pain 
(LBP); computed tomography (CT); benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); primary androgen 
deprivation therapy (pADT); bone scintigraphy (BS); positron emission tomography (PET); 
tumour marking studies (TMS); dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); echocardiography 
(ECG); pulmonary function test (PFT); ipsilateral adrenalectomy (IA); radioactive iodine 
treatment (RAI); carotid artery disease (CAD); congestive heart failure (CHF); magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). Figure adapted and updated from Chalmers and Elshaug.4

Direct and Indirect Evidence of Overuse Globally
Clinical Category
Direct documentation of inappropriate 
care
Indirect evidence
Musculoskeletal procedures
Spain: Rates of inappropriate total knee 
replacement of 26% and of total hip 
replacement 25% 49
US: Rate of inappropriate total knee 
replacement 34% 50
International: 4-fold variation across countries and 2–3 fold 
variation within countries in rates of knee replacement 51
England: 13-fold regional variation in rates of arthroscopic 
knee lavage52
US: 5-fold regional variation in adjusted rates of total hip and 
knee replacement 53
Cardiovascular procedures
Italy: Rate of inappropriate percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) 22% and of 
inappropriate coronary angiography 30% 54
US: Rate of inappropriate PCI 1.1% for 
acute indications and 11.6% for non-acute 
indications with variation across hospitals 
(6.0%–16.7%) 55
Brazil: rate of inappropriate coronary 
angiography 20% 56
International 9-fold variation in use of PCI and 5-fold 
variation in use of CABG across OECD countries 28
US: Rates of elective percutaneous coronary interventions 
vary 10-fold within the state of California57
India: A second opinion centre reported recommending 
against cardiac interventions in 55% of patients in whom 
intervention initially recommended58
Hysterectomy
Taiwan59: 20% of hysterectomies 
inappropriate
Switzerland60: 13% of hysterectomies 
inappropriate
US61: rates of inappropriate hysterectomies 
between 16% and 70% across studies
Canada62: 2.7-fold variation in rates of hysterectomy across 
regions within Ontario
Netherlands63: 2.2-fold regional variation in rates of 
hysterectomy of bleeding; 2.3-fold regional variation in rates 
for pelvic organ prolapse
India64: prevalence of up to 9.8% overall, with 1/3 of 
hysterectomies performed in women under age 35 (likely 
inappropriate in this age group)
Antibiotics for acute diarrhea
Italy65: among children hospitalized for 
acute diarrhea, 9% received antibiotics 
inappropriately
China66: 57% received antibiotics 
inappropriately; among those with an 
indication for antibiotics, 21% were NOT 
treated (adults)
Thailand67: 55% of children with acute 
diarrhea received antibiotics inappropriately
US68: 10.4% of patients with diarrhea received antibiotics 
(often likely inappropriate)
India69: 71% of children with acute diarrhea received 
antibiotics (despite recommendation against routine use)
India70: Rates of antibiotic use for acute diarrhea 43% in 
public facilities and 69% in private facilities (despite 
recommendation against routine use)
