Abstract
Objectives: The lifelong health impacts of adverse childhood experiences are increasingly being identified, including
earlier and more frequent development of non-communicable disease. Our aim was to examine whether adverse
childhood experiences are related to increased use of primary, emergency and in-patient care and at what ages such
impact is apparent.
Methods: Household surveys were undertaken in 2015 with 7414 adults resident in Wales and England using random
probability stratified sampling (age range 18–69 years). Nine adverse childhood experiences (covering childhood abuse
and household stressors) and three types of health care use in the last 12 months were assessed: number of general
practice (GP) visits, emergency department (ED) attendances and nights spent in hospital.
Results: Levels of use increased with increasing numbers of adverse childhood experiences experienced. Compared to
those with no adverse childhood experiences, odds (�95% CIs) of frequent GP use (�6 visits), any ED attendance or any
overnight hospital stay were 2.34 (1.88–2.92), 2.32 (1.90–2.83) and 2.67 (2.06–3.47) in those with � 4 adverse childhood
experiences. Differences were independent of socio-economic measures of deprivation and other demographics. Higher
health care use in those with � 4 adverse childhood experiences (compared with no adverse childhood experiences) was
evident at 18–29 years of age and continued through to 50–59 years. Demographically adjusted means for ED attendance
rose from 12.2% of 18-29 year olds with no adverse childhood experiences to 28.8% of those with � 4 adverse childhood
experiences. At 60–69 years, only overnight hospital stay was significant (9.8% vs. 25.0%).
Conclusions: Along with the acute impacts of adverse childhood experiences on child health, a life course perspective
provides a compelling case for investing in safe and nurturing childhoods. Disproportionate health expenditure in later
life might be reduced through childhood interventions to prevent adverse childhood experiences.

Introduction
Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is
strongly related to poorer health across life. ACEs
include being a victim of physical, sexual or emotional
abuse or neglect as a child and exposure to chronic
environmental stressors such as living in a household
affected by domestic violence, substance misuse or
mental illness. Such exposure can: alter early neuro-
logical
development
including
both

and
reward centres and pre-frontal cortical impulse con-

systems contributing to chronic tissue inflammation
and increased allostatic load;5 and increase risks of
adults having poor social adjustment, reduced cognitive
capacity and low mental wellbeing.6 These physio-
logical and psychological changes lead to increased
rates of physical and mental health conditions as well
as poorer educational and employment outcomes.2,4,7,8
Strong relationships between ACEs and ill health
should result in greater demands on health services
amongst those exposed to greater childhood adversity.
However, only a few studies have examined the rela-
tionship between childhood stressors and adult health
service use. Relationships have been identified between
childhood abuse and health service use9 and between
increased
ACEs
and
increased
prescription
drug
use.10,11 One Canadian study found each additional
ACE (from a possible six) increased the risk of high
use of general practitioners by 12%, emergency rooms
by 29% and other services by 19%.12 Little is under-
stood about when during life such increases in use
become evident or about how such use relates to
socio-economic factors such as deprivation. Thus,
while ACEs can increase ill health, service use may
depend on individuals having access to health care
regardless of their socio-economic status13 especially
as ACEs are more prevalent in poorer populations.2
Most countries are facing increasingly unserviceable
demands on health care budgets.14 Savings might arise
from investing in preventing ACEs. Our aim was to
examine the relationship between ACEs and health
care use in England and Wales and to explore this rela-
tionship in different age groups to understand if and
when a legacy of childhood adversity has an impact
on health care use.
Methods
Survey sample
A national representative household survey of adults
resident in Wales (February to May 2015) and locally
representative household surveys in three English
regions
(Hertfordshire,
Luton,
Northamptonshire;
June to September 2015) were undertaken using the
same data collection tools. The surveys aimed to
explore relationships between exposure to adverse
experiences in childhood and a range of outcomes in
adulthood including the adoption of health-harming
behaviours, development of long-term health condi-
tions and use of health care.
We used the national postcode address file to select
respondents on the basis of residence. Households were
selected through random probability sampling stratified
by each of the four areas and then by small area
deprivation using lower super output areas (LSOAs;
geographic areas with a population mean of 1500).
Within each region, LSOAs were categorized into quin-
tiles of deprivation based on their ranking in, for
Wales, the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation
(IMD) 201415 or, for English regions, the English
IMD 2011.16 Both IMDs use a composite deprivation
measure based on domains including income, employ-
ment, health, education, access to services, community
safety and physical environment. However, Welsh and
English IMDs are not directly comparable and there-
fore deprivation quintiles were calculated separately for
England and Wales, with region of residence included
as a potential confounder in all multivariate analyses.
Questionnaire
We used established questions from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention short ACE tool17 with
11 questions measuring childhood exposure to abuse
and family dysfunction experienced by respondents
before the age of 18 years. Responses were reduced to
nine ACE categories: verbal, physical, and sexual abuse;
exposure to domestic violence, parental separation and
growing up in a household with mental illness, alcohol
abuse, drug abuse or with an individual who had been
incarcerated (Supplementary Table 1). Individuals were
then categorized into an ACE count group based on the
total number of ACEs they reported.2,4
Three self-reported measures of health care use in
the last 12 months were collected: number of visits to
GPs, number of emergency department (ED) attend-
ances,
and
number
of
nights
spent
in
hospital
(excluding episodes relating to pregnancy). Responses
were categorized into: higher GP visits (six or more);
ED attendance (at least one in the last 12 months; yes,
no) and overnight hospital stays (at least one in the last
12 months; yes, no). Demographics were age categories,
sex, deprivation quintile and ethnicity (white, or black
and other minority ethnic group (BME)).
Data collection
For selected households in English regions, a letter was
delivered prior to researcher visits that outlined the
study, when researchers might visit and information
on how to opt out. In Wales, potential participants
were presented with a letter upon researcher visits.
Trained researchers visited selected houses on all days
of the week between the hours of 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
Potential participants were given a study information
sheet that outlined the purpose of the study and pro-
vided details of its voluntary, confidential and anonym-
ous nature. Individuals were informed that they could
withdraw at any point and that doing so would not

 affect any aspect of their health treatment or other ser-
vices. After receiving informed consent, the question-
naire was delivered to those meeting the study inclusion
criteria (aged 18–69 years; cognitively able to partici-
pate in a face-to-face interview and resident in the
selected LSOA).
Interviews were conducted by researchers who then
entered responses onto data tablets (computer-assisted
personal interviewing). However, for sensitive ques-
tions, including those measuring ACEs, tablets were
passed to respondents to complete questions directly
(computer-assisted self-interviewing). All data collec-
tion occurred in respondents’ homes and, except
where translators were required, questions were asked
on a one-to-one basis. As well as English language, and
Welsh for those surveyed in Wales, respondents could
opt to be interviewed in French, Spanish, Polish, Hindi,
Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Pashto,
Sindhi, Saraiki and Balochi.
Data analysis
Data input was undertaken in Microsoft Excel with all
statistical analyses completed in SPSS v22. Analyses
used chi squared for bivariate examination of associ-
ations with health care use and subsequent multivariate
modeling employed binary logistic regression to identify
relationships independent of demographics. Modelled
estimates for prevalence of health care use variables
were calculated for ACE count and deprivation quintile
combinations using an estimated marginal mean func-
tion to adjust for other demographic factors. Binary
logistic regression models were repeated for each of
five age categories in order to explore how relationships
between ACEs and health care use varied with age.
Results
Based on ACE prevalence identified in other UK sur-
veys,2 overall sample size was set at approximately 7500.
Overall, 28,349 households were visited during the study
periods. However, 42.8% (n ¼ 12,127) did not result in
contact with a resident (e.g. unoccupied premises at time
of visit). Of occupied households, 20.8% (n ¼ 3371) were
ineligible (e.g. out of age range) including 56 where lan-
guage could not be accommodated. Another 32.1%
(n ¼ 5200)
declined
to
participate
and
47.2%
(n ¼ 7651) completed a questionnaire. Thus, based on
known occupied eligible households, overall compliance
was 59.5%. Here however, any individuals who did not
complete all questions required for analyses were also
removed resulting in a final sample of n ¼ 7414.
The final samples provided coverage of all measured
demographics. Comparison between the sample and
adult general populations (18–69 years) in study areas
identified oversampling of those aged 60–69 years,
females, black and ethnic minority (BME) and more
deprived individuals in the English sample and of
younger (18–29 years), white ethnicity and mid-level
deprivation (deprivation quintile 3) individuals in
Wales (Supplementary Table 2).
The incidence of health care use (GP use, ED attend-
ance and overnight hospital stays) increased with ACE
count. For both ED attendance and overnight hospital
stays, the incidence of health care use more than
doubled between 0 and � 4 ACE categories (Table 1).
Increases in health care use were also seen between the
most deprived and most affluent quintiles but did not
reach statistical significance for ED attendance.
The incidence of higher GP use increased with age
while ED attendance was elevated in the youngest
group and overnight hospital stays in the oldest.
Ethnicity was not significantly related to health care
use. Women reported marginally higher overnight hos-
pital stays and substantially elevated levels of GP use.
Region of residence was also related to higher GP use
but not other health care use (Table 1).
Logistic regression was employed to identify inde-
pendent
relationships
with
health
care
use.
Relationships between ACE counts and higher GP
use, ED attendance and overnight hospital stays all
remained highly significant, with the highest adjusted
odds ratio (�4 vs. 0 ACEs) seen for overnight hospital
stays (Table 2). Deprivation was independently asso-
ciated with increases in both higher GP use and over-
night
hospital
stays
but
not
ED
attendance.
Relationships
between
all
types
of
use
and
age
remained; women were more likely to be higher GP
users and to stay overnight in hospital; and BME eth-
nicity showed a weak relationship with lower ED
attendance (Table 2).
Modelled sample incidence of health care use by
ACE count and deprivation (adjusted to sample aver-
age for age, sex, ethnicity and residence) found higher
GP use in the last 12 months to range from 7.3% of the
most affluent quintile with no ACEs to 23.8% in the
least affluent quintile with � 4 ACEs (Figure 1(a)).
Equivalent figures for ED attendance and overnight
hospital stays were 9.3% versus 21.8% (Figure 1(b))
and 4.1% versus 17.0% (Figure 1(c)), respectively. In
all cases, a greater proportion of the variance was
explained by ACE counts than deprivation (Table 2,
Figure 1(a) to (c)) with increasing ACE counts contri-
buting consistently to levels of all types of health care
use across deprivation quintiles.
Logistic regression by age shows increases in ACE
count are strongly related to higher GP use, ED attend-
ance and overnight hospital stays even in those aged
18–29 years (Table 3). Adjusted odds ratios (�4 vs.
no ACEs) were higher for all categories of use across
170

 all other age groups although the difference was not
statistically significant for overnight hospital stays in
those aged 40–49 years and for both higher GP use
and
ED
attendance
in
those
aged
60–69
years.
Adjusted odds for demographics and other independent
variables included in the model are presented in
Supplementary Table 3. Figure 2 presents the modelled
sample incidence of health care use by age. As young as
18–29 years, proportions reporting higher GP use more
than triple between those with 0 and � 4 ACEs and for
ED attendance and overnight hospital stays more than
double (Figure 2(a) to (c)).

 Discussion
Main findings
ACEs are strongly predictive of higher GP use, greater
use of emergency care and increased hospitalisation.
While GP use and hospitalisation were also related in
part to deprivation, the impacts of ACEs appear inde-
pendent of such deprivation and added to levels of
health care use in a dose response fashion across
socio-economic groups. Thus, compared with individ-
uals with no ACEs living in the most affluent quintile,
levels of higher GP use among those living in the most
deprived quintile rose by two-thirds for those with no
ACEs but threefold for those with 4 þ ACEs.
Critically, the impacts of ACEs on health care use
appear to be established by the beginning of adulthood.
Thus, in those age 18–29 years, the adjusted prevalence
of higher GP use in the last 12 months tripled from
those reporting no ACEs to those reporting �4
ACEs. Marked increases in ED attendance by 18–29
year olds were seen in both those with 2–3 and �4
ACEs with levels more than doubling compared to
those with no history of ACEs. Overnight hospital
stays showed a similar escalation with increases espe-
cially marked in those with a legacy of 2–3 and � 4
ACEs.
Such early increases in health care use may result
from increased unintentional
injury and violence,
mental health conditions, substance use or related som-
atic complaints; all of which have been associated with
ACEs.4,18,19 In the oldest group, there was no inde-
pendent relationship between ACEs and either higher
GP use or ED attendance. In part, this may reflect the

counts.

 in the USA to result in lifetime costs of $10,530 in adult
medical needs and $144,360 in lost productivity.22 In
the UK, the annual costs to adult mental health and
substance use services related to childhood sexual abuse
have been estimated at £178 million.23 Other ACEs,
such as childhood exposure to domestic violence,
have also been linked independently to poor mental
health and the adoption of health-harming behav-
iours.24 While the impacts of these specific ACEs on
health and health care are substantive, results here
and from studies elsewhere12 suggest ACEs have a
cumulative impact with each additional ACE suffered
increasing risks of ill health and health care use.
Limitations
Interpretation of results from this study is limited by an
overall response rate of 59.5%. Further, respondents
may not have reported exposure to ACEs or health
service use accurately. Response rates and levels of
ACEs reported were however similar to other ACE
studies.2 While there were some differences between
population and sample demographics (Supplementary
Table 2), reported levels of health care use were similar
to those reported in national surveys. Thus, 13.1% of
Welsh respondents reported at least one ED attendance
in the last 12 months and 6.7% reported at least one
overnight hospital stay, compared with 17% and 9%,
respectively, in the 2015 Welsh Health Survey.25 The
slightly lower levels in our survey may relate to our
sample being restricted to adults below the age of 70.
No comparable figures were available for GP attend-
ance. Finally, our study design was retrospective.
Therefore, only correlation and not causal relationships
between exposure to ACEs and subsequent health care
use could be established.

 Implications for policy
Despite escalating older populations, non-communic-
able diseases and costs of treatments raising health
care demand, investment in the prevention of ACEs
as a mechanism to improve life course health is rare.
Although programmes to reduce child maltreatment
are available (e.g. home visiting, parenting educa-
tion),26 even in the European region their implementa-
tion
at
scale
is
limited.27

 support parents with substance use or mental health
conditions (e.g. in paediatric primary care)28 is also
far from ubiquitous. However, such programmes have
the potential to reduce exposure to ACEs and conse-
quently associated health harming behaviours, non-
communicable diseases and pressures on health and
social services. Our results demonstrate that individuals
with high ACE counts present at younger ages and
more frequently. A trauma informed health care service
should be equipped to appropriately identify and sup-
port such individuals; both improving their health and
reducing subsequent needs for health care.
