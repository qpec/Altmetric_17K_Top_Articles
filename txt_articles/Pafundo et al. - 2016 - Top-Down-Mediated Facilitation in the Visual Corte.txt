Response properties in primary sensory cortices are highly dependent on behavioral state. For example, the nucleus basalis of the
forebrain plays a critical role in enhancing response properties of excitatory neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) during active explo-
ration and learning. Given the strong reciprocal connections between hierarchically arranged cortical regions, how are increases in
sensory response gain constrained to prevent runaway excitation? To explore this, we used in vivo two-photon guided cell-attached
recording in conjunction with spatially restricted optogenetic photo-inhibition of higher-order visual cortex in mice. We found that the
principle feedback projection to V1 originating from the lateral medial area (LM) facilitated visual responses in layer 2/3 excitatory

Introduction
The rules and conditions governing activity propagation between
reciprocally connected brain regions are poorly understood. Re-
cent studies establish that the visual cortex in mice is hierarchi-
cally arranged into functional areas that have distinct preferences
for visual features (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007; Andermann et
al., 2011; Marshel et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Glickfeld et al.,
2013). These higher-order areas provide top-down feedback to
primary visual cortex (V1), feedback that is well positioned to
convey information regarding context and previously learned
statistical features (Gilbert and Li, 2013; Nassi et al., 2014). V1
response properties are also potently altered by subcortical areas
such as the nucleus basalis of the forebrain, which enhances the
ability to detect sensory stimuli and learn new associations and is
essential for increasing visual responses during locomotion and
arousal (Bennett et al., 2013; Carcea and Froemke, 2013; Pinto et
al., 2013; Fu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014). For example, the visual
responses of excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of V1 become
more reliable and increase in magnitude 2- to 3-fold during basal
forebrain (BF) activation and locomotion. The higher spike rates
in V1 are not associated with changes in selectivity (bandwidth)
and are therefore indicative of a change in response gain (Goard
and Dan, 2009; Polack et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014). Mechanisms
localized within V1 in combination with modulation of anteced-
ent, bottom-up inputs appear to account for arousal-induced
increases in response gain in rodents (Goard and Dan, 2009;
Polack et al., 2013). The extent to which these changes are prop-
agated to higher visual areas has not been examined systemati-
cally. A recent in vivo imaging study raises the possibility that

Significance Statement
Reciprocal connectivity among brain regions is a prominent feature of all sensory cortices. In primary visual cortex (V1), top-
down signals from association areas aid in context-dependent perception of visual scenes by altering the response properties of
individual neurons. Sensory-evoked responses in V1 are also highly dependent on subcortical neuromodulation pathways that
regulate brain state. Here, with cell-type-specific resolution, we addressed how corticocortical and subcortical pathways interact
to regulate responsiveness of V1. Our results provide insight into the rules and conditions governing activity propagation in
reciprocally connected networks.

 increases in both response gain and reliability are propagated to
higher visual areas in a feedforward, supralinear manner (Lecoq
et al., 2014).
Despite the importance of corticocortical and subcortical
pathways in regulating visual responsiveness, how these two
pathways interact during coincident engagement in vivo to opti-
mize vision while maintaining network stability is unk-
nown. To address this, we developed an assay to quantify the
contribution of the most prominent source of cortical feedback,
the lateral medial area (LM) (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007; Wang
et al., 2012), on V1 responsiveness in
combination with subcortical BF activa-
tion. We found LM facilitates visual re-
sponses in L2/3 excitatory neurons by
�20%. As expected, BF stimulation was
associated with widespread desynchroni-
zation of the cortical EEG and improved
response reliability in V1. We found that
the improvement in response reliability,
as well as modulation of other response
properties, was not propagated to higher-
order LM.
In terms of reciprocal connectivity,
cortical feedback from LM was not re-
quired for basal-forebrain-enhanced vi-
sual responsiveness in V1. Furthermore,
LM-mediated facilitation was reduced by
half during nucleus basalis activation. Our
results establish that the impact of top-
down feedback on V1 is gated by BF acti-
vation. We demonstrate that control of
V1 can be internally rebalanced such that
L2/3 excitatory neuron response proper-
ties are more strongly determined by
bottom-up inputs at the expense of LM-
mediated feedback during BF activation.
This rebalancing may be a critical feature
that serves to prevent runaway excitation
in reciprocally connected networks.
Materials and Methods
Animal preparation. All experimental proce-
dures were compliant with the guidelines es-
tablished by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Carnegie Mellon University
and the National Institutes of Health. Experi-
ments were performed in mice expressing
cre-recombinase (cre) and red fluorescence
protein (tdTomato) in parvalbumin (PV)-
positive neurons derived from the cross be-
tween PV-cre knock-in female mice (Jax:
008069, generated by S. Arbor, Friedrich Mi-
escher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel,
Switzerland) and male tdTomato reporter
knock-in mouse (Jax:007908, �Ai14�, gener-
ated by H. Zeng, Allen Brain Institute). Re-
cordings were made in cell-attached mode in
the left hemisphere visual cortex of 28
urethane-anesthetized mice aged 50 � 1.2 d at
the time of recording.
During surgery, mice (28–41 d old) were
anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction,
1–2% maintenance) and eyes were covered
with silicone oil. A stainless steel bar, used to
immobilize the head for recordings, was glued
to the right side of the skull and secured with dental cement. An �2.5-
mm-diameter craniotomy was made over the visual cortex in the left
hemisphere, identified by coordinates and landmarks as described in
Kuhlman and Huang (2008). Expression of channelrhodopsin (ChR) in
PV-positive neurons in the visual cortex was achieved by a single tract
injection of 250–500 nl of the virus AAV9.EF1a.DiO.hChR2(H134R)-
eYFP.WPRE.hGH (UPenn, AV-9-20298P) in the lateral secondary visual
cortex every 50 �m, from 750 to 100 �m below the dural surface using a

 beyond LM in all animals. The area of the craniotomy and the site of
injection were confirmed by intrinsic signal imaging as described below.
The craniotomy was then covered with a double glass assembly in which
the diameter of the inner glass was fitted to the craniotomy and sealed
with dental cement. Fourteen to 23 d after injection, the double glass
window was removed and a circular 2.5 mm glass coverslip was posi-
tioned such that it covered most of the V1 area but allowed access for
recording pipettes to penetrate the brain. A silver chloride ground elec-
trode was implanted over the cerebellum and a recording well was
made out of dental cement and filled with cortex buffer containing the
following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2,
and 2 MgSO4.
Intrinsic signal optical imaging. Mapping of the visual cortex was per-
formed through the cranial window in mice 7–14 d after craniotomy and
injection. Mice were anesthetized with 0.5% isofluorane and sedated
with chlorprothixene (2 mg/kg). The craniotomy window was illumi-
nated with a 630 nm LED (Prizmatix) and imaged with a tandem lens
macroscope. For each stimulus, 6 min movies were acquired at 30
frames/s using a 12-bit CCD camera (Dalsa 1M30), a frame grabber
(Matrox Meteor II/Dig), and custom software. Frames were binned 4
times temporally and 2 � 2 spatially. Two visual stimuli presented in a
LCD monitor (40.5 cm-width, 30 cm-height) positioned 25 cm from the
right eye at 70° to the long axis of the animal, covering �22° to 38° in
elevation and �27° to 35° in azimuthal space were used. The stimuli
presented were a horizontal white bar of 3° in height and a vertical white
bar of 4° in width drifting up or down or left or right on a black back-
ground at 0.135 Hz.
Visual stimulation. Visual presentations were generated using custom
software developed with PsychToolbox in MATLAB and displayed in a
gamma-calibrated LCD monitor positioned as in the intrinsic optical
imaging mapping (25 cm from the right eye at 70° to the long axis of the
animal). To measure the orientation preference during cell-attached re-
cordings before the silencing experiment (presilencing), full-field drift-
ing square wave gratings were presented at full contrast at six orientations
spaced 30° apart at two directions of motion (12 orientations). Stimulus
orientations and direction were randomized and each stimulus was pre-
sented for 3 s, followed by a gray screen of equal duration repeated in 4–9
trials. The preferred spatial and temporal frequency, typically 0.02 cycles
per degree at 1 Hz for PV neurons and 0.04 cycles per degree at 2 Hz for
excitatory (Ex) neurons, were used. After determining the preferred ori-
entation, 6 orientations were presented in control and under LED illu-
mination of LM for the duration of the visual stimulus (3 s). In all
experiments, trials of control and LED were interleaved across repeti-
tions (typically 15–16 repetitions were measured). The 6 orientations
were spaced 30° and spanned from 0° to150° or from 180° to 330°, con-
taining the preferred orientation. Each stimulus was presented for 3 s,
followed by a gray screen of equal duration.
In vivo cell-attached recording. In all cell-attached recordings, mice
were anesthetized with urethane (0.5 g/kg) and sedated with chlorpro-
thixene (5 mg/kg). In vivo imaging was performed on a two-photon
microscope (Scientifica) using a Chameleon ultra 2 laser (Coherent)
running at 930 nm and controlled by ScanImage 3 software (Vidrio
Technologies). Surface blood vessels, the coverslip edge, and the pi-
pette were viewed in visible-light conditions at both low (5� objec-
tive) and high magnification (40� water-immersion objective;
Olympus) using a halogen light source coupled to a fiber optic guide
outfitted with a green filter.
Pipettes had a resistance of 5–9 M� when filled with cortex buffer
containing 20 �M Alexa Fluor-488 hydrazide (Invitrogen). PV neurons
were recognized by td-tomato fluorescence and targeted under two-
photon imaging; putative excitatory (Ex) neurons were recorded blind.
Briefly, 250 mBar of pressure was initially applied to the pipette until the
pipette penetrated both the dura and pia matter diagonally at a 35° angle.
Once penetrated, pressure was reduced to 60 mBar, the pipette was diag-
onally moved through L1, and the pressure was reduced to 20–25 mBar
in L2/3. The pipette tip relative to the cell surface and resistance were
simultaneously monitored during pipette navigation. Contact of the pi-
pette tip with the targeted cell was judged by the concurrence of a sudden
increase in resistance and proximity of pipette tip to the soma and pres-
sure was released to 0 mbar. Occasionally, negative pressure was applied.
Seals of 0.05–1 G� resistance were found to be sufficient to detect and
isolate the spikes of single neurons. Electrophysiological signal was ac-
quired with a Multiclamp amplifier in current-clamp mode, a National
Instruments digitizer, and WinEDR software (J Dempster, Strathclyde
University). Data were analyzed in MATLAB. Signals were sampled at 10
kHz and filtered at 6 kHz. Pipette capacitance was compensated.
The location of the recording site was retinotopically matched to the
location of silencing in LM as determined by the intrinsic signal imaging
maps for each animal. To silence LM, we stimulated local PV-positive
neurons using ChR. Briefly, we modified the two-photon microscope by
adding a dichroic mirror (485 LP; Omega Optical) before the viewing
head, allowing the illumination of the mouse cortex through the objec-
tive with a 470 nm LED light (Mightex). To restrict the size of the LED
illumination, a 4 mm pinhole was introduced in the path of the LED light.
Due to the heterogeneity in the levels of ChR expression between ani-
mals, at the beginning of each experiment, the intensity of the LED light
was calibrated by recording visually responsive Ex neurons in LM and
assessing the effect of different LED intensities on their response. The
minimal LED intensity that produced 100% silencing was used for the
experiment. Of the 25 animals used for ChR dependent LM silencing,
four were discarded because Ex neurons in LM could not be silenced,
presumably due to insufficient ChR expression in LM. Initially, the size
of the area of silencing was estimated by recording the ChR evoked re-
sponse in PV neurons with the LED light centered over the PV neuron
soma and then the center of illumination was translated to different
positions in the x, y plane relative to the soma of the recorded neuron. To
confirm that PV activation maps were consistent with the spatial extent
of silencing Ex neurons, the same procedure was repeated except that Ex
neurons were recorded (Fig. 1). We determined that the area of silencing
had a maximal diameter of 700 �m. In terms of depth, during LED
illumination, visually evoked spike rates were reduced by 97 � 1.9%
through LM L5a (450 �m, Fig 1e). At depths beyond the border of L5a/5b
in LM, silencing was incomplete; the spike rate was reduced by only
33.6 � 17.1% at 650 �m (data not shown). In terms of recovery of
silencing, we determined empirically that cortical activity was recovered

presentations. We did not detect a difference (paired t test, p � 0.29)
between the average evoked rates of L2/3 Ex neurons (n � 16 neurons) at
their preferred orientation during presilencing (2.11 � 0.64 Hz) com-
pared with the control (LEDoff) trials (1.92 � 0.59 Hz), which were
interleaved with LEDon trials.
BF projections and stimulation. The projections of the BF in the frontal
and visual cortex were determined by expression of the fluorescent pro-
tein GFP in the BF neurons in eight mice. Expression of GFP was
achieved by injection of the virus AAV2.CAG.GFP (UNC) through a
small burr hole in the following stereotaxic coordinates from bregma:
AP � �0.7 mm, ML � 1.75 mm, and 4.3 mm below the dural surface in
39- to 48-d-old mice. Then, 150 nl of the virus was delivered using a
nanoject system (Drummond Scientific) at a single depth in 3 injections
of 50 nl separated by 5 min. Twenty to 21 d after injection, mice were
perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were
removed and postfixed for 24 h in the same fixative and sectioned in 60
�m coronal slices using a vibratome. The slices were then stained with
Hoechst to determine the laminar distribution of the cortex. Briefly,
slices were incubated with a permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton
X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and then with Hoechst
33342 at a dilution of 1:10,000 (Life Technologies) for 30 min. Slices were
then washed three times with PBS, mounted, and imaged with an epiflu-
orescence microscope (Olympus). The border between V1 and LM in
visual cortex slices was determined by the pronounced increase in thick-
ness of L4 (van Brussel et al., 2009; Cooke et al., 2015). To quantify the
density of BF projection fibers in LM and V1, the coronal slice corre-
sponding to the midpoint of LM in the rostral–caudal axis was selected
(4 mm caudal to bregma) and fibers were traced manually using Im-
ageJ software (n � 8 mice). Three different focal planes spaced 20 �m
apart were traced and then projected to one image for each slice. LM
was defined as 0.05–0.6 mm lateral from the border of V1–LM esti-
mated by Hoechst stain and V1 was defined as 0.05–1 mm medial
from the border of V1–LM.
We stimulated the BF using a stimulation electrode in 17 mice, nine
of which were used to record the activity of V1 neurons during LM
silencing and BF stimulation (seven mice were used for Ex neuron
recordings and five mice were used for PV neuron recordings, in three
of the nine mice, both types of neurons were recorded), five mice were
used in experiments in which Ex LM neurons were recorded during
BF stimulation and three mice were used in experiments in which PV
LM neurons were recorded during BF stimulation. Before the electro-
physiological recordings, a silver chloride electrode was implanted
over the surface of the left frontal cortex (AP � 1.9 mm, ML � 0.25
mm) to record EEG and a concentric bipolar stimulation electrode
(Plastics1) was stereotaxically implanted in the left BF (AP � �0.7
mm, ML � 1.75 mm, DV � 4.1–4.5 mm). Under urethane anesthesia,
the depth of the electrode was adjusted until the power of the prefron-
tal EEG at 1–10 Hz was successfully reduced by electrical stimulation
(50 pulses of 0.1 ms at 100 Hz, of 100–175 uA) as described previously
(Alitto and Dan, 2012). Briefly, the stimulation electrode was initially
located at a depth of 4.1 mm and 12 repetitions of the electrical
stimulation were performed once every 15 s. Custom-made MATLAB
routines were used to analyze the power of the EEG recorded in the
prefrontal cortex. If no reduction of the power at 1–10 Hz produced
by the stimulation was detected, the electrode was moved 0.05–0.1
mm deeper and the stimulation was repeated. Once a successful re-
duction of EEG power was detected, the intensity of the stimulation
was adjusted to produce maximal reduction in EEG power. The stim-
ulation electrode was then fixed in place with dental cement.

 Data analysis and statistics. Events from the electrophysiological
recordings in cell-attached configuration were detected in WinEDR us-
ing the rate of change of the signal. Custom routines in MATLAB were
used to determine the number of events elicited during the visual pre-
sentations and to calculate the average firing rate in each condition. For
each neuron, the preferred orientation was determined by selecting the
orientation to which the neuron responded with the maximal firing rate.
The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated using the evoked rate at
the preferred orientation. Tuning curves were obtained by measuring the
response at different orientations spaced by 30 degrees. The orientation
selectivity index (OSI) and bandwidth were calculated from the best-
fitting parameters of a Gaussian function fitted to the tuning curves
(Kuhlman and Huang, 2008).
In the experiments in which the BF was electrically stimulated, we
quantified the effect of the stimulation by calculating the desynchro-
nization in the EEG recorded in the frontal cortex of urethane-
anesthetized mice (Alitto and Dan, 2012) as an EEG power index
(1-EEG power Post-Stim1–10Hz/EEG power Pre-Stim1–10Hz). The
power ratio was calculated as EEG power at 10–100 Hz divided by
EEG power at 1–10 Hz.
Intrinsic optical signal image phase maps of retinotopy were gen-
erated as described previously (Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003). Fourier
transforms of each pixel in the image sequence, at the frequency of the
repeated stimulus were computed using custom scripts in MATLAB.
Contour lines indicating iso-elevation and iso-azimuth areas were
hand traced from low-pass-filtered phase maps and the different
functional areas of visual cortex were labeled as described previously
(Marshel et al., 2011). An image of the vasculature at the surface of the
cortex in the same location was also captured and the locations of V1
and LM were mapped to the vasculature.
Data are presented either as individual paired values or as mean �
SEM. All datasets were tested for normal distribution in SPSS and
normally distributed data were compared using t test, paired t test,
ANOVA, or repeated-measures ANOVA as indicated. For cases in
which the data were not normally distributed, a nonparametric test
was used; paired comparisons were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, as indicated.

an optogenetic approach to silence a restricted area of cortex.
Optogenetic silencing of cortex by activating ChR expressed spe-
cifically in locally projecting inhibitory neurons (Kuhlman and
Huang, 2008) has proven to be a reliable and repeatable method
(Li et al., 2013; Lien and Scanziani, 2013; Guo et al., 2014). How-
ever, the LM is a relatively small area (0.8 mm 2) located adjacent
to V1, so to silence this area selectively without modulating the
activity of V1 neurons directly, we needed to adapt optogenetic
silencing to our particular requirements. In our experiments,
ChR was expressed specifically in PV neurons throughout the
visual cortex, including the lateral higher visual areas (Fig. 1a),
and aperture-restricted LED illumination (470 nm) through a
40� objective lens was used to activate PV inhibitory neurons.
Using the aperture-restricted illumination, we determined em-
pirically that cortical silencing was restricted to a 700 �m diam-
eter and, in terms of depth, was effective in silencing Ex neurons
through L5a of LM.
Our method of spatially restricted silencing is sensitive to
ChR expression level, so to control for differences in expres-
sion level across animals, LED intensity was calibrated for each
animal by finding the minimum LED intensity sufficient to
suppress visually evoked spikes in one or two LM Ex neurons.
First, we determined that there was an optimal LED intensity
at which light-induced firing rate in PV neurons was highly
repeatable (Fig. 1b,c). We next confirmed that the minimum
LED intensity required to silence LM Ex neurons effectively
fell within this optimal LED intensity range by recording both
Ex and PV neurons in the same animal using different LED
intensities (Fig. 1d–f). In this manner, we determined that the
minimum LED intensity required to suppress visually evoked
responses in Ex neurons corresponded to stable activation of
PV neurons. To define the spatial limits of silencing, we re-
corded LED evoked spikes from PV neurons centered directly
under the objective and then systematically translated the ob-
jective to various distances from the recorded neuron. We
noted that LED evoked spike rates in PV neurons was highest
at the center of illumination (Fig. 1g). Using this approach, we
demonstrated that the radius of cortical silencing is 350 �m
(Fig. 1g,h).
Based on the above characterization, we conclude that this
method is appropriate for silencing a retinotopically matched
region that is �350 �m from the recording site, as well as �350
�m from the areal border. Given that there is noticeable animal-
to-animal variation in the cortical representation of visual space
(Marshel et al., 2011), before electrophysiological recording,
both the location of LM and positioning of V1 recordings were
determined using intrinsic signal optical imaging to map retino-
topy in each animal used in this study. All V1 recordings were
retinotopically aligned to the center of LM silencing within a 100
�m diameter (Fig. 2). Care was taken to ensure that the 700 �m
diameter of silencing did not cross the V1–LM border. In addi-
tion, retinotopic alignment between LM silencing and V1 record-
ing was confirmed post hoc by projecting the recording and
silencing sites onto an averaged x,y-coordinate space (Fig. 2b,
bottom right).

Using the silencing method described above in conjunction
with cell-attached, extracellular recording of V1 neurons, vi-
sual responses to full-field drifting gratings of varying orien-
tations during trials of LM silencing were compared with trials
without silencing (Fig. 3). LM silencing resulted in a signifi-
cant reduction of visually evoked responses in L2/3 Ex neu-
rons specifically at the preferred orientation (two-way mixed
factorial ANOVA interaction between orientation and LED
state, p � 0.007). We found that LM feedback facilitates the
response of L2/3 Ex neurons by �20%, specifically at their
preferred orientation (Fig. 3c,d). Consistent with this result,
LM silencing corresponded with a slight but significant de-
crease in the OSI (LED off: 0.70 � 0.06, LED on: 0.66 � 0.06;
paired t test, p � 0.020). Bandwidth of the tuning curves was
unchanged (LED off: 18.6 � 2.6°, LED on: 23.4 � 3.3°; Wil-
coxon signed-rank test, p � 0.179).

which, unlike L2/3 Ex neurons, typically do not have elaborate den-

LM had no impact on L4 Ex neuron orientation tuning curves (Fig.
3e, two-way mixed factorial ANOVA interaction between orienta-
tion and LED state, p � 0.907), nor did we detect an effect on either
OSI (LED off: 0.61 � 0.09, LED on: 0.65 � 0.09; paired t test, p �

Similar to L4 Ex neurons, which also do not have extensive
dendritic branching in L1, evoked firing rates of L2/3 PV neurons
were not modulated by LM silencing (Fig. 3f; two-way mixed

orientations are shown in Figure 4. The majority of V1 Ex
neurons showed a reduction in firing rate during LM silenc-
ing, whereas most PV neuron responses were insensitive to LM
silencing.
Response properties of V1 and LM neurons during
BF stimulation
To use our photo-inhibition approach to determine whether
corticocortical and subcortical pathways operate synergistically
or antagonistically to affect visual responses within V1, we next
compared the impact of BF activation on V1 and LM neuron
response properties. First we characterized the reliability to which
we were able to target the BF by labeling neurons with GFP at the
targeted site (coordinates from bregma: ML 1.75 mm, AP �0.7
mm, and 4.3 mm below the dural surface). We found that our
subcortical targeting was highly repeatable across animals (Fig.
5). The BF extends �2.5 mm in the rostral–caudal axis. The
nucleus basalis is contained within this region, spanning �0.035
to �1.35 mm from bregma. The stereotaxic coordinates that we
used targeted the center (rostral–caudal), dorsal region of the
nucleus basils. Next, we examined the pattern of axonal projec-
tion fields. As expected, labeled axons were readily seen through-
out both the frontal and visual cortices (Fig. 5b,c). Within the
visual cortex, we found that the density of axon fibers was evenly
distributed throughout V1 and LM across all cortical layers and
specifically within L2/3 (Fig. 5c–e). In terms of the identity of the
fibers visualized here, cortically projecting neurons in the tar-
geted area are known to include cholinergic as well as gluta-
matergic and GABAergic subtypes (Henny and Jones, 2008;
Hassani et al., 2009). Subcortically stimulated neurons in this
study may also include a newly identified population of cho-
linergic neurons located at the border of the globus pallidus
and BF (Saunders et al., 2015).
Next, using the above coordinates, BF activity was stimulated
with a bipolar electrode positioned in the same hemisphere as the
V1 recording site. As expected (Goard and Dan, 2009; Chen et al.,
2012), BF stimulation induced a transient desynchronization
of the frontal cortical EEG that lasted for a duration of 2.5 s in
our conditions (Fig. 6). The amount of cortical desynchroni-
zation induced by BF activation was calculated as the EEG
power index (Goard and Dan, 2009) and characterized for
each animal (Fig. 6g).
As expected (Goard and Dan, 2009), we found that BF stim-
ulation increased visually evoked spike rates of L2/3 Ex V1 neu-
rons by 2- to 3-fold at the preferred orientation (Fig. 6d) and that
the CV across trials was reduced by 15.29 � 6.7% (Fig. 6e). BF
stimulation did not change the OSI (control: 0.63 � 0.07, BF
stim: 0.54 � 0.06; paired t test, p � 0.162) nor the bandwidth
(control: 25.5 � 3.5°, BF stim: 20.3 � 4.1°; Wilcoxon signed-rank
test, p � 0.182). Therefore, BF stimulation increased response
gain and improved response reliability of V1 L2/3 Ex neurons. In
striking contrast, neither response gain nor the CV of L2/3 Ex
neurons in LM was altered by BF stimulation (Fig. 7). Therefore,
LM and V1 are modulated differentially by BF activity.
Somewhat surprisingly, the increase in V1 responsiveness was
not propagated to LM. We considered the possibility that this
may be due to the presence of feedforward inhibition. It was
previously shown that projections from V1 to LM preferentially
target PV inhibitory neurons compared with excitatory neurons
(Yang et al., 2013). To address whether feedforward inhibition
was responsible for dampening the propagation of a BF-induced

Pafundo et al. • Top-Down-Mediated Facilitation in the Visual Cortex
 increase in V1 gain, we recorded visual responses in PV neurons
in LM during BF stimulation compared with baseline condit-
ions in which BF was not stimulated (Fig. 8). If feedforward in-
hibition were involved, the expected result would be that BF stim-
ulation should increase PV neuron responsiveness in LM. In
contrast to the above possibility, we did not find evidence for
V1–LM feedforward inhibition contributing to the dampening of
propagation. PV visually evoked spike rates in LM were decreased
by 29% at the preferred orientation during BF stimulation com-
pared with baseline (BF stimulation: 14.33 � 2.81 Hz, baseline:
20.12 � 3.25 Hz). BF stimulation had a similar impact at all
orientations, resulting in a significant downward shift of the ori-
entation tuning curve (ANOVA p � 0.033). We next compared
these results with PV neurons in V1. Strikingly, the impact of BF
stimulation on PV neurons in V1 was distinct from that in LM. In
the case of V1 PV neurons, visually evoked spike rates increased
by 50% at the preferred orientation (BF stimulation: 29.86 � 5.26
Hz, baseline: 19.94 � 3.28 Hz) and significantly shifted the ori-
entation tuning curve upward (ANOVA p � 0.008). Therefore,
for both excitatory and PV inhibitory neurons, the impact of BF
stimulation on responsiveness was regionally distinct. We found
a general increase in responsiveness of both PV and excitatory
neurons in V1, whereas in LM, a suppressive effect dominated in
which PV neuron responsiveness was reduced and excitatory
neuron responsiveness did not increase, as would be expected if
propagation from V1 were linear or supralinear.
Impact of LM photo-inhibition on the BF-induced increase in
V1 response gain
Next, we examined the interaction between the LM corticocorti-
cal and BF subcortical pathways in a second group of mice
(Group 2). A within-subject comparison revealed that BF stimu-
lation concurrent with LM silencing (BF stimulation � LEDon)
increased visually evoked spike rates of L2/3 Ex neurons in V1 at
their preferred orientation by 2-fold (Fig. 9a). Furthermore, the
CV across trials was also decreased (Fig. 9b). Therefore, LM feed-
back is not required for BF-induced increases in V1 response gain
or improved reliability.
Further within-subject analysis revealed that, during BF stim-
ulation, silencing LM significantly reduced visual evoked spike
rates in LM at the preferred orientation (LEDoff: 4.20 � 0.43 Hz,
LEDon: 3.8 � 0.36 Hz, p � 0.008). Therefore, similar to the
results shown in Figures 3 and 4 (Group 1), LM exerted a facili-
tatory effect. However, the relative amount of facilitation was
reduced. A cross-subject comparison between Group 1 and
Group 2 revealed that LM-mediated facilitation was reduced by
50% during BF stimulation compared with control conditions
(Fig. 9c). Considering that LM output was unchanged by BF stim-
ulation (Fig. 7) and that BF stimulation induced a 2-fold increase
in V1 responsiveness, the relative reduction in facilitation indi-
cates that LM feedback is linearly combined with V1 activity and
that the 50% reduction can be accounted for by the 2-fold in-
crease in V1 evoked firing rate.
Finally, in a subset of BF-stimulated Group 2 animals, L2/3
PV neuron recordings were obtained. Similar to Group 1, vi-
sually evoked responses of L2/3 PV neurons in Group 2 were
not facilitated by LM feedback (Fig. 9c). Therefore, we fo-
und that cell-type-specific facilitation was maintained in BF-
activated conditions.
Discussion
We found that the impact of top-down feedback on V1 is altered
by nucleus basalis activation. Our results demonstrate that con-
trol of V1 can be internally rebalanced such that L2/3 excitatory
neuron response properties are more strongly determined by
sensory-driven bottom-up inputs at the expense of LM-mediated
feedback. The nucleus basalis of the forebrain is a primary source
of cortical acetylcholine (Ach) and is required for enhanced sen-
sory detection during heightened arousal (Hasselmo and Sarter,
2011; Carcea and Froemke, 2013). Our results are generally con-
sistent with classic studies involving recording from in vitro brain
slices, which concluded that, in the presence of Ach, cortical flow
of activity is altered such that thalamic input is preferentially
enhanced through activation of nicotinic Ach receptors and, si-
multaneously, corticocortical feedback is suppressed by the ac-
tion of muscarinic Ach receptors (Hasselmo and Sarter, 2011).
However, in our in vivo recording conditions, which likely acti-
vated all cell types within the subcortical stimulated area includ-
ing cortically projecting glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons
and cholinergic neurons (Bigl et al., 1982; Eckenstein et al., 1988),
we found no evidence of corticocortical suppression. During
BF activation, LM output was maintained, as well as the abso-
lute contribution of LM-mediated facilitation to V1 re-
sponses. Rather, we found a rebalancing of input such that the
relative contribution of LM was reduced by 50%.

 successfully restrict the area of silencing to
a diameter of �700 �m. To achieve this
restricted area required that we calibrate
the light intensity used for each animal
and use the lowest light intensity that reli-
ably activated PV neurons. We anticipate
that not all methods of expressing ChR in
inhibitory neurons will be amenable to
achieving the above characteristics, par-
ticularly in terms of restricting the area of
silencing. For example, in preliminary
tests using VGAT transgenic mice in
which ChR is genetically expressed in in-
hibitory neurons (Jackson stock number
014548), we were unable to achieve a re-
stricted area of silencing less than �1.2
mm (data not shown). It is important to
note that, in our study, neurons deeper
than L5a in LM were not completely si-
lenced. It is possible that deep LM neu-
rons
could
indirectly
influence
V1
responses through subcortical pathways
involving the superior colliculus and thal-
amus; such indirect influences would not
be detected in our assay.
Areal differences in response to
BF stimulation
Although BF projections are distributed
uniformly across LM and V1, we found
key differences in how LM neurons re-
sponded to BF stimulation compared
with V1 neurons. Despite a 2- to 3-fold
increase in V1 evoked spike rates, LM ex-
citatory neurons failed to show an in-
crease in evoked firing rate during BF
stimulation. Our results suggest that the
mechanisms underlying BF-induced re-
sponse gain in V1 are not present in LM
and that increased V1 responsiveness is
not propagated to LM. A possible mecha-
nism that could account for both phe-
nomena
would
be
that
feedforward
inhibition dominates in the V1–LM path-
way (Yang et al., 2013). However, given
that we found that the visually evoked fir-
ing rate of PV neurons in LM actually de-
creased
during
BF
stimulation,
this
possibility is unlikely. Alternatively, re-
gional differences in the expression of signaling molecules such as
the muscarinic type 2 acetylcholine receptor (m2AChR) may
contribute to response differences and a second, distinct mecha-
nism could be involved in dampening V1–LM propagation.
m2AChR expression is lower in LM compared with V1 (Wang et
al., 2012; Ji et al., 2015) and activation of presynaptic m2AChRs
expressed in PV neuron inhibitory terminals synapsing onto ex-
citatory neurons are known to inhibit the release of GABA (Mu-
n
˜oz and Rudy, 2014). Therefore, the absence of an m2AChR-
mediated boosting effect in LM could explain why, although
present, stimulation of BF fibers does not result in increased ex-
citability within LM. Additional, unidentified mechanisms likely
contribute to the dampening of V1–LM propagation. Consistent
with this interpretation, it was previously demonstrated that in-
creases in V1 responsiveness can be accounted for by muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors in conditions that induced similar levels
of EEG desynchronization used here (Alitto and Dan, 2012).
It has been demonstrated that the modulatory influence of
cholinergic signaling is both spatially and temporally precise in
awake animals performing specific tasks (Carey and Rieck, 1987;
Mun
˜oz and Rudy, 2014). In this study, we established that there
are regional differences in the functional response to BF stimula-
tion in vivo within the visual cortex, specifically between LM and
V1. The differences are robust and evident in the presence of
urethane anesthesia used here. Further studies are needed to
identify the precise mechanisms, as well as their time course of
action, that contribute to regional differences in responsiveness.
It is important to keep in mind that, although using anesthesia

Pafundo et al. • Top-Down-Mediated Facilitation in the Visual Cortex
 has the advantage that experimental variables are tightly con-
trolled, anesthesia does affect ion channel function and may re-
duce the impact of top-down inputs. Therefore, to fully elucidate
the complex interplay between receptor kinetics operating at the
level of individual neurons and regional network response prop-
erties, studies in awake animals will be informative, particularly
when examining temporal dynamics of inhibitory–excitatory
balance as it relates to attention and top-down feedback.
Influence of top-down input on V1 response properties
To address how corticocortical and subcortical pathways interact
during coincident engagement in vivo, first we characterized the
contribution of feedback from LM on the visual responses of
three types of neurons: L2/3 excitatory, L2/3 PV inhibitory, and
L4 excitatory neurons. L2/3 excitatory neurons are unique in that
their dendritic tufts arborize extensively in L1 and possess active
membrane properties that contribute to supralinear summation
of coincidence input (Larkum, 2013). Given that feedback pro-
jections from LM are densest in L1 in combination with the den-
dritic properties noted above, it is predicted that feedback from
higher-order brain areas enhances responsiveness specifically of
excitatory neurons (Larkum, 2013; Yang et al., 2013). Here, we
tested this prediction directly in vivo and found that, indeed,
facilitation was specific to L2/3 excitatory neurons. It is also pos-
sible that top-down metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated
suppression of thalamocortical input (De Pasquale and Sherman,
2013) contributed to masking what would otherwise appear as
facilitation in V1 L4 Ex neurons. Such an interpretation would
be consistent with the finding that, in vitro, stimulation of LM
axons provides excitatory input onto V1 L4 Ex neurons (Yang
et al., 2013).
It is of interest that we found LM-mediated facilitation to be
restricted to the preferred angle of the orientation tuning curve.
These results are consistent with a circuit configuration in which
similarly tuned excitatory neurons are preferentially connected in a
reciprocal manner between V1 and LM, as is observed in primates
(Shmuel et al., 2005). Despite the salt-and-pepper organization of
response properties such as orientation tuning, it is becoming in-
creasingly apparent that the mouse visual system is highly organized
in terms of preferential connectivity between functionally similar
neurons (Ko et al., 2011; Glickfeld et al., 2013). This raises impor-
tant questions regarding how such subnetworks emerge during
experience-dependentdevelopment(Koetal.,2013,2014),aswellas
what rules may govern the routing of activity during periods of
increased response gain. To examine the latter, we designed a
paradigm to quantify the interaction between corticocortical and
subcortical pathways.
Intersection of corticocortical and subcortical pathways on
V1 response properties
Our results demonstrate that LM-mediated facilitation is not
required for BF-induced increases in V1 response gain and im-
provement in response reliability. Moreover, the BF-mediated
increase in L2/3 V1 response gain was selective for bottom-up
inputs compared with top-down LM feedback. We propose that
areal specialization in sensitivity to BF activity, together with
asymmetry within the V1–LM reciprocal loop previously de-
scribed in vitro (De Pasquale and Sherman, 2013; Yang et al.,
2013), results in a rebalancing of V1 control such that L2/3 excit-
atory neuron response properties are more strongly determined
by bottom-up inputs during nucleus basalis activation. The tran-
sient reduction of LM feedback during conditions that activate
the nucleus basalis, such as novel experience (Carcea and
Froemke, 2013), may optimize V1 sensitivity to external stimuli
by reducing the influence of previously learned visual scene
statistics.
