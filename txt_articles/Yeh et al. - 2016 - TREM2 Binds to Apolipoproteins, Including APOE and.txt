In Brief
Yeh et al. show that TREM2 is a receptor
for lipoproteins, including APOE and CLU,
and thereby mediates uptake of
lipoprotein-Ab complexes by microglia.
The study links together three genetic risk
factors of Alzheimer’s disease and offers

SUMMARY
Genetic variants of TREM2, a protein expressed
selectively by microglia in the brain, are associated
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Starting from an unbi-
ased protein microarray screen, we identified a set of
lipoprotein particles (including LDL) and apolipopro-
teins (including CLU/APOJ and APOE) as ligands
of TREM2. Binding of these ligands by TREM2 was
abolished or reduced by disease-associated muta-
tions. Overexpression of wild-type TREM2 was suffi-
cient to enhance uptake of LDL, CLU, and APOE in
heterologous cells, whereas TREM2 disease variants
were impaired in this activity. Trem2 knockout micro-
glia showed reduced internalization of LDL and CLU.
b-amyloid (Ab) binds to lipoproteins and this com-
plex is efficiently taken up by microglia in a TREM2-
dependent fashion. Uptake of Ab-lipoprotein com-
plexes was reduced in macrophages from human
subjects carrying a TREM2 AD variant. These data
link three genetic risk factors for AD and reveal
a possible mechanism by which mutant TREM2
increases risk of AD.
INTRODUCTION
Expected to affect 40 million worldwide by 2020, Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia with no
approved disease-modifying treatment (Anders Wimo, 2010). It
is widely believed that the accumulation of b-amyloid (Ab) pep-
tides, which can deposit in amyloid plaques and form toxic olig-
omers, plays a key role in AD pathogenesis (Hardy and Selkoe,
2002). In familial forms of AD, mutations in amyloid precursor
protein (APP) or APP-processing enzymes result in a relative in-
crease of aggregation-prone Ab species, leading to early-onset
forms of AD (De Strooper et al., 2012; Haass et al., 2012; Kanda-
lepas and Vassar, 2014). In late-onset AD (LOAD), it is thought
that impairment of Ab clearance is a key factor behind disease
progression (Holtzman and Zlokovic, 2007; Mawuenyega et al.,
2010; Wildsmith et al., 2013).
As LOAD accounts for the vast majority of AD cases, large ef-
forts have been made to understand the underlying genetic risk
factors in the disease (Karch and Goate, 2015; Rosenthal and
Kamboh, 2014). In LOAD, apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the biggest
risk factor. In humans there are three isoforms of APOE
(APOE2–4), with APOE2 being a protective allele and APOE4 a
risk allele for AD (Corder et al., 1993; Holtzman et al., 2012; Kane-
kiyo et al., 2014; Saunders et al., 1993; Strittmatter et al., 1993a).
In addition, both protective and detrimental SNPs in clusterin
(CLU; also known as apolipoprotein J [APOJ]), are associated
with AD (Harold et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009). The AD risk
allele of CLU is associated with reduced CLU expression levels
while the protective allele is associated with increased expres-
sion (Allen et al., 2012; Ling et al., 2012). Mouse knockout (KO)
studies have shown that loss of either Apoe or Clu results in
reduced amyloid plaque deposition, perhaps via a decrease in
Ab seeding (Bales et al., 1997; DeMattos et al., 2004; Holtzman
et al., 2012). In addition, APOE influences the clearance and
metabolism of Ab, possibly through competition for the same re-
ceptors or alternatively via APOE acting as a chaperone for Ab
(Castellano et al., 2011; Holtzman et al., 2012; Kanekiyo et al.,
2014). However, the molecular mechanisms and cellular path-
ways by which APOE and CLU affect Ab clearance and influence
the risk of AD remain poorly understood.
With the advent of genome sequencing, many rare genetic
variants have been linked to AD (Del-Aguila et al., 2015; Jonsson
et al., 2012; Karch and Goate, 2015; Tanzi, 2012). Triggering
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a recently
discovered AD risk gene (Guerreiro et al., 2013c; Jonsson
et al., 2013) that encodes a single-transmembrane (STM) protein
expressed by monocytic myeloid cells. In the brain, TREM2 is
selectively expressed in microglia, the innate immune cells of
the CNS (Klesney-Tait et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2014). The
TREM2 R47H allele, which has an odds ratio of �2.9–4.5 (Guer-
reiro et al., 2013c; Jonsson et al., 2013), appears to decrease the
age of onset of AD by �3 years (Jonsson et al., 2013). Additional
TREM2 variants, R62H and D87N, have been linked to AD (Guer-
reiro et al., 2013c; Jin et al., 2014). The R47H mutation has been
suggested to be a loss-of-function mutation (Wang et al., 2015),
while the R62H and D87N variants have not been functionally
characterized. These data imply that microglia play an important
role in the pathogenesis of AD.

 Besides AD, loss-of-function mutants of TREM2 (Q33X, Y38C,
and T66M) in homozygous state cause Nasu-Hakola disease
(NHD), a severe recessive disease characterized by bone cysts
as well as neurodegeneration and white matter loss by the fourth
decade of life. These pathologies are thought to occur due to a
defect in osteoclasts in bone remodeling and dysfunctional
microglia in the brain (Klesney-Tait et al., 2006; Kondo et al.,
2002; Paloneva et al., 2002).
The physiological function of TREM2 in the brain is poorly un-
derstood. Based on earlier experiments, TREM2 has been impli-
cated in anti-inflammatory signaling in monocytes and microglia
by inhibiting Toll-like receptor signaling (Klesney-Tait et al., 2006;
Turnbull et al., 2006) and promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic
cell membranes (Hsieh et al., 2009; Kawabori et al., 2015; Kles-
ney-Tait et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2005). Deficiency of Trem2
in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD increased amyloid accumula-
tion and exacerbated neuronal loss (Wang et al., 2015), while
overexpression of TREM2 in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model
ameliorated neuropathology (Jiang et al., 2014). However, the
mechanism behind the protective function of TREM2 remains
unclear.
We hypothesized that TREM2 has extracellular ligands
whose binding is affected by the AD- and NHD-associated mu-
tations, most of which are amino acid (aa) substitutions in the
extracellular Ig-like V-type domain of TREM2. The extracellular
region of TREM2 has been proposed to bind a variety of mole-
cules, including phospholipids, apolipoproteins, PlexinA1, and
Hsp60 (Atagi et al., 2015; Bailey et al., 2015; Stefano et al.,
2009; Takegahara et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015); but, how
these ligands link TREM2 to AD is unclear. We performed a
large unbiased screen of an extracellular recombinant protein
library representing 1,559 extracellular proteins, and we identi-
fied a set of lipoprotein particles and apolipoproteins as ligands
of TREM2. Importantly, the TREM2 ligands include APOE and
CLU, which are themselves risk genes for AD, and their binding
is impaired by TREM2 mutations that confer AD risk. Moreover,
we provide evidence that, through its interaction with lipopro-
teins, TREM2 can facilitate Ab uptake by microglia and human
macrophages.
RESULTS
Unbiased Identification of TREM2 Ligands by Protein
Microarray Screen
We previously have developed and characterized a human pro-
tein microarray (PM) platform for identifying extracellular protein-
protein interactions (Ramani et al., 2012; Tom et al., 2013). These
arrays consist of purified extracellular domains of STM proteins
and secreted ligands immobilized on epoxy-derivatized glass
slides, and they have been used to identify several novel recep-
tor-ligand interactions (Haddick et al., 2014; Jaworski et al.,
2015; Lobito et al., 2011). The PM library represents 1,559 genes,
encoding �50% of the predicted human STM and secreted
proteins (Table S1).
To identify potential ligands for TREM2 using this platform,
we purified the extracellular domain of human TREM2 (hTREM2,
aa 19–174) fused at the C terminus to the Fc portion of human
IgG1 (TREM2-Fc). The screen with TREM2-Fc identified the
following seven hits that showed clear separation from the
background: apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), low-density lipoprotein
(LDL), malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL), neuritin 1-like
(NRN1L), secretoglobin 2A2 (SCGB2A2), growth hormone 1
(GH1), and unc-5 homolog B (UNC5B) (Figures 1A and 1C–1G).
To confirm the specificity of these hits, we repeated the full PM
screen with the extracellular domain of TREM1, another TREM
family member that also might be linked to AD (Replogle et al.,
2015) but that shares <20% aa identity in the extracellular
domain. The TREM1-Fc screen did not yield any strong hits or
show significant binding to any of the TREM2 candidate ligands
(Figures 1B, 1H, and 1I).
Using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) as an independent orthog-
onal method to measure protein-protein interaction, we con-
firmed that APOA1, LDL, as well as oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and
MDA-LDL, showed robust binding to TREM2-Fc (Figures 2A
and 2B; Figures S1A and S1C), but not to control Fc-fusion pro-
teins (Figures S1B, S2A, and S2B). Other hits from the TREM2-Fc
microarray screen failed to replicate in BLI assays, resulting in
either no binding (NRN1L) or background binding (SCGB2A2,
GH1, and UNC5B) (data not shown).
hTREM2 Binds to Lipoprotein Particles and
Apolipoproteins APOA, APOB, CLU, and APOE
We investigated whether hTREM2 binds to other human lipopro-
tein particles and apolipoproteins. We found that, in addition to
LDL, TREM2-Fc bound to very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL),
high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lipoprotein [Lp(a)] (Figure 2A),
whereas TREM1-Fc did not (Figure S2A). As apolipoproteins are
found physiologically in a lipidated state in the form of lipopro-
teins, we used dimyristoyl-phosphocholine (DMPC) to artificially
lipidate these proteins to test their interactions via BLI. We found
that TREM2-Fc, but not TREM1-Fc, bound to lipidated APOA1
and lipidated APOA2, which are major components of HDL par-
ticles (Figure 2B; Figure S2B) (Calero et al., 1999; Kanekiyo et al.,
2014). We also assayed for binding to APOB, a major apolipo-
protein component of LDL and VLDL particles (Walldius and
Jungner, 2004). By BLI measurements, purified APOB bound
robustly to TREM2-Fc, but not TREM1-Fc (Figure 2B; Fig-
ure S2B). Curiously, our lipidation protocol for apolipoproteins
abolished APOB binding to TREM2-Fc. It is possible, because
of the much larger size of APOB compared to the other apolipo-
proteins tested here (APOB: 515 kDa versus APOA1/2: 28 kDa),
that APOB co-purifies with its required lipids (i.e., purified APOB
is already associated with lipids), while our DMPC lipidation pro-
tocol results in a loss of activity.
HDL-like particles containing APOE and CLU are present in
the brain and are mainly produced by glia (DeMattos et al.,
2001). Both APOE and CLU are genetically linked to AD, so we
tested whether TREM2 interacted with these two apolipopro-
teins. Interestingly, TREM2-Fc interacted with both lipidated
APOE and lipidated CLU, but not with lipid particles made from
DMPC alone (Figures 2C and 2D; Figures S1D and S1E).
TREM1-Fc did not bind to either CLU or APOE, regardless of
their lipidation state (Figures S2C and S2D). APOA2, CLU, and
APOE were represented on the microarray and did not appear
as positive hits in the TREM2-Fc screen, likely because these
apolipoproteins were purified without lipidation.

 TREM2 Disease Mutations Reduce Binding to LDL, CLU,
and APOE
What are the effects of the AD risk variants of hTREM2 on
apolipoprotein and lipoprotein binding? We focused on three
AD-associated variants (R47H, R62H, and D87N), two NHD mu-
tations (Y38C and T66M), and a predicted null mutant K48M,
which was designed by modeling hTREM2 with the TREM1 crys-
tal structure (PDB: 1SMO) (Figure 3A) (Kelker et al., 2004). Bind-
ing was measured by BLI using the same amount of each of the
TREM2-Fc variants (in the form of Fc fusions). Consistent with
complete loss of function inferred from human genetics, the
NHD mutants Y38C and T66M showed no appreciable bind-
ing to LDL, similar to K48M (Figures 3B and 3C). Of the three
AD-associated variants, R47H exhibited the largest relative
reduction (55%) in binding to LDL compared to wild-type
(WT). D87N showed a 47% decrease in LDL binding, while the
R62H variant was more modestly impaired (17% decrease)
(Figure 3C).
The relative binding of lipidated CLU to TREM2-Fc variants
followed a similar trend as LDL (Figure 3D). The NHD mutants
of hTREM2 showed no detectable binding to lipidated CLU.
R47H and D87N both exhibited a 40% reduction in binding to
CLU as compared to WT TREM2-Fc; R62H was slightly, but
nonetheless significantly, impaired (12% reduction) (Figure 3E).
We also tested APOE binding to the variants of hTREM2 and
found the binding profiles were closely matched to those of
CLU (Figures 3F and 3G). The AD mutants R47H (51% reduc-
tion), D87N (52% reduction), and R62H (22% reduction) all ex-
hibited partial loss of function, while the NHD mutants had no
detectable binding to lipidated APOE, similar to K48M.
Expression of TREM2 Is Sufficient to Induce Uptake of
AcLDL, CLU, and APOE in Heterologous Cells
To investigate the functional significance of TREM2 binding
to apolipoproteins and lipoprotein particles, we created stable
HEK293 cell lines expressing WT and mutant forms of hTREM2
Figure 1. Unbiased PM Screen for TREM2-Binding Partners
A PM containing 1,559 genes/proteins (randomly separated into two sublibraries 1 and 2 and spotted on separate microarray slides due to capacity limitations)
was screened for binding to the extracellular domain of hTREM2 fused to IgG Fc.

which is also spotted in duplicate, to help localize sample positions on the microarray. White boxes denote areas around three prominent hits for TREM2-Fc in

positive hits.

 under the control of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoter
(hTREM2-Dox cell lines; Figure S3A). We first compared LDL up-
take between induced and uninduced WT hTREM2-Dox cells,
but we did not see an appreciable change in uptake with
hTREM2 expression (Figure S3B). We hypothesized that high
basal internalization of LDL, due to expression of LDL receptor
(LDLR) in HEK293 cells (Poirier et al., 2009), as well as an inability
to dose higher concentrations of LDL, possibly occluded the
effect of hTREM2 expression.
To circumvent endogenous LDLR expression, we tested acet-
ylated LDL (AcLDL), which does not bind to LDLRs (Weisgraber
et al., 1978) but binds to hTREM2 (Figure S1A). Following Dox in-
duction, cells expressing WT hTREM2 showed a marked increase
inuptake ofDiI-labeled AcLDL when comparedtouninduced cells
(Figure 4A). The extracellular fluorescence signal was quenched
using trypan blue to confirm that the DiI-AcLDL signal was inter-
nalized within the cells. A time course revealed an �2.4-fold in-
creaseintherate ofinternalization ofDiI-labeledAcLDL ininduced
hTREM2-expressing cells versus uninduced cells (Figure 4B).
Dox-induced WT hTREM2-Dox cells also were able to take up
lipidated CLU and lipidated APOE (as measured by western blot-
ting of cell lysates), whereas uninduced cells failed to do so to a
detectable degree (Figures 4C–4E). These data demonstrate that
heterologous expression of hTREM2 is sufficient to mediate
cellular uptake of LDL, CLU, and APOE.
We also investigated whether hTREM2-Dox cells exhibited dif-
ferential uptake of APOE isoforms, and we found that lipidated
recombinant APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4 was taken up with
similar efficiency (Figures S3C and S3D). This finding is consis-
tent with reports that show no difference in binding of TREM2
to APOE2, 3, and 4 (Atagi et al., 2015; Bailey et al., 2015).
Next we tested the effect of AD- or NHD-associated mutations
on the ability of TREM2 to mediate uptake of lipoprotein ligands.
We generated cell lines that expressed each of the five hTREM2
mutant proteins at similar levels to each other and to WT after
Dox induction (Figure S3A). Cells expressing the NHD mutants
Y38C (19% ± 7% of WT) and T66M (9% ± 5% of WT) exhibited
severely reduced uptake of AcLDL compared with WT hTREM2
(Figures 4F and 4G). Among the AD-associated mutants, R47H
was markedly impaired in AcLDL uptake (8% ± 3% of WT),
whereas D87N (58% ± 9% of WT) and R62H (53% ± 5%
of WT) showed a moderate loss of AcLDL uptake (Figures 4F
and 4G).
When we tested uptake of lipidated CLU by induced hTREM2-
Dox cells (Figures 4H and 4I), we found that mutants Y38C
(18% ± 5% of WT) and T66M (12% ± 3% of WT) were greatly
impaired in uptake of CLU. Mutants R47H (48% ± 8% of WT)
and D87N (70% ± 11% of WT) showed a moderate reduction
of CLU uptake, although the D87N result did not reach statistical
significance. In contrast to its impaired uptake of AcLDL, the
R62H mutant was similar to WT in mediating uptake of artificially
lipidated CLU.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that disease-linked
mutations in the extracellular Ig domain of TREM2 not only affect

 binding of certain apolipoproteins and lipoprotein particles but
also have functional consequences on the uptake of these
ligands into cells, with the NHD mutations in general showing
a more severe impairment than the AD-associated mutations.
TREM2 Deficiency in Microglia Reduces CLU and LDL
Uptake
To investigate the role of endogenous TREM2 in lipoprotein bind-
ing and processing, we turned to microglia, the cell type in the
brain that expresses TREM2. We first confirmed using BLI that
mouse TREM2 (mTREM2) could bind human LDL particles (Fig-
ure S4). We then tested whether LDL uptake was affected by the
loss of TREM2. Primary microglia purified and cultured from
Trem2 KO mice showed an �40% reduction in uptake of DiI-
labeled LDL compared with WT microglia (Figure 5A, quantified
in Figure 5B). Analysis of the time course of DiI-LDL uptake by
flow cytometry corroborated a slower rate of LDL uptake by
Trem2 KO microglia (Figure 5C). These findings confirm that
TREM2 is required, at least in part, for the ability of microglia to
take up LDL. Microglia also express known LDLRs, such as
Figure 3. DiseaseVariantsofTREM2Reduce

and such receptors might be responsible
for the residual uptake of LDL into Trem2
KO microglia.
To evaluate whether TREM2 also plays
a role in CLU or APOE uptake, we
assayed microglia uptake of CLU and
APOE from mouse astrocyte-conditioned
medium (ACM). Trem2 KO microglia
showed a significant decrease in CLU
uptake as compared to WT microglia
(Figures 5D and 5E), similar to what we
observed with LDL. We were unable to
detect any uptake of APOE from ACM
even in WT microglia (Figures 5F and 5G), possibly due to the
already high levels of endogenous APOE in microglia (see Fig-
ure 5F, left lanes, no ACM treatment). Thus, we were unable to
evaluate whether APOE uptake was affected by the loss of
TREM2 in cultured microglia.
Trem2 KO Microglia Are Impaired in the Uptake of Ab
Complexed with Lipoproteins
Ab has been reported to bind to apolipoproteins such as APOE
and CLU (Ghiso et al., 1993; Strittmatter et al., 1993b), and
neuritic plaques contain CLU and APOE in addition to Ab (Calero
et al., 2000; Namba et al., 1991). Clearance of Ab plaques
or soluble Ab by microglia is thought to be a major mechanism
for preventing the accumulation of Ab in the aging brain. We
therefore explored whether lipoprotein ligands of TREM2 such
as CLU and LDL—by binding both Ab and TREM2—can
act as a carrier for Ab to facilitate Ab uptake by microglia.
Indeed, when we mixed fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
labeled Ab1–42 (FITC-Ab) aggregates (see the Experimental Pro-
cedures) together with DiI-labeled LDL or lipidated CLU, we
332
Neuron 91, 328–340, July 20, 2016
 found that a substantial proportion of the Ab aggregates floated
with the lipoprotein particles upon step-gradient-density ultra-
centrifugation, implying binding of Ab to LDL or CLU lipoproteins
(Figure 6A). Using this step-gradient-density centrifugation, we
purified the Ab-lipoprotein complexes based on their lower den-
sity, while free Ab aggregates fractionated at the bottom of the
tube (Figure 6A).
When incubated with gradient-purified Ab-LDL complex or
free Ab (at the same total concentration of Ab), WT microglia
were markedly more efficient at taking up Ab in the form of
Ab-LDL complex than as free Ab (Figure 6B) (FITC-Ab uptake
by microglia quantified by flow cytometry [Figure S6]). The up-
take of Ab-LDL complex was substantially impaired in Trem2
KO microglia when compared with WT microglia (Figure 6B; Fig-
ure S7A). Of note, the uptake of Ab-LDL complex by microglia
from Trem2 heterozygous (HET) mice was intermediate between
that of WT and homozygous KO microglia (Figure 6B; Fig-
ure S7A). Thus, normal uptake of Ab-LDL by microglia not only
requires TREM2 but also depends on the gene dosage of
Trem2. Consistent with our hypothesis that TREM2 mediates
uptake of Ab through an Ab-LDL complex, we observed that
DiI-LDL uptake (when we added FITC-Ab-DiI-LDL complex to

compared with WT microglia and to an intermediate degree in
Trem2 HET microglia (Figure 6C; Figure S7A).
We performed similar experiments to test whether lipidated
CLU, a ligand of TREM2 present within the brain, could serve
as a carrier for Ab uptake. Indeed, WT microglia were more effi-
cient in uptake of Ab when incubated with the gradient-purified
Ab-CLU complex than with free Ab at the same Ab concentration
(Figure 6D). Remarkably, the uptake of Ab-CLU complex by mi-
croglia was again dependent on Trem2 gene dosage: uptake of
Ab-CLU was strongly reduced in Trem2 KO microglia compared
to WT microglia, whereas Trem2 HET microglia were impaired to
an intermediate degree (Figure 6D; Figure S7B). Although the dif-
ference of Ab-CLU uptake between Trem2 WT and HET microglia
did not reach statistical significance, there was a trend similar to
what we observed with Ab-LDL uptake. Note that the effect size
was slightly smaller than for the Ab-LDL complex; we hypothesize
this could be due to the use of a synthetically lipidated CLU mole-
cule as opposed to a natural lipid particle, such as LDL. Taken
together, our findings indicate that, by directly binding to lipopro-
teins such as CLU, TREM2 expressed on microglia could play a
role in the uptake and, thus, clearance of extracellular Ab aggre-
gates that are associated with lipoproteins.
We measured the rate of degradation of Ab following uptake
by WT versus Trem2 KO microglia. When fed with free Ab, there
was no difference in the time course of degradation of internal-
ized Ab between these two genotypes (Figure 6E). After uptake
of Ab-LDL complexes, however, Ab degradation was faster in
WT microglia than in Trem2 KO microglia (Figure 6F). These
data suggest that the uptake of Ab-LDL complexes mediated
by TREM2 allows faster degradation of Ab than uptake by
TREM2-independent mechanisms.

 TREM2 R62H Human Macrophages Take Up Less
Ab-LDL Complex
To extend our findings to humans, we screened �1,500 donors
in the Genentech Genotype and Phenotype Registry within our
Employee Blood Donation program and identified six subjects
that had one allele of R62H TREM2 (Table S2). We derived mono-
cyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from these R62H carriers,
and we tested their ability to take up Ab compared to MDMs
from age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched controls (Figures
7A and 7B). Like mouse microglia, human MDMs from all sub-
jects were more efficient in uptake of Ab-LDL complexes as
compared to free Ab of the same concentration. Notably,
MDMs from R62H carriers showed a modest but highly signifi-
cant reduction in uptake of Ab-LDL complexes compared to
matched controls (Figure 7B). These results suggest that human
MDMs heterozygous for the R62H AD mutation have a defect in
Ab-lipoprotein handling, further supporting a role for TREM2 in
the clearance of lipoprotein-associated Ab aggregates.
DISCUSSION
Human genetic data increasingly highlight innate immune cells
such as microglia playing a role in determining the risk of
LOAD. A recent example is TREM2, a risk gene expressed spe-
cifically on myeloid cells, including microglia (Guerreiro et al.,
2013c; Jonsson et al., 2013). TREM2 has been reported to
bind to phospholipids, but the significance of these interactions
in AD biology is not well understood (Poliani et al., 2015; Wang
Figure 6. Uptake and Degradation of Ab Complexed with TREM2 Ligands Is Reduced in Trem2 KO Microglia
(A) Isolation of FITC-Ab complexed with DiI-LDL by step-gradient centrifugation. Ab that was bound to LDL (Ab-LDL) floated to the interface between 0% and 24%
Optiprep because of the lower density of LDL, and it was collected for use in microglial uptake experiments.
(B) FITC-Ab-DiI-LDL complex isolated as shown in (A) or free FITC-Ab (both at 0.1 mM concentration of Ab) was added to microglia for 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr,
3 hr, or 4 hr. The uptake of FITC-Ab or DiI-LDL was measured by flow cytometry based on the mean fluorescence intensity of FITC or DiI, respectively. The
association with LDL greatly boosted the uptake of Ab versus free Ab (measured by FITC fluorescence intensity). Trem2 KO microglia were strongly impaired and
Trem2 HET microglia were moderately impaired in uptake of the complex.
(C) DiI-LDL uptake, from FITC-Ab-DiI-LDL complexes, was also TREM2 dependent, with a similar trend to Ab (n = 8 for WT and Trem2 KO; n = 5 for Trem2 HET;
two-way ANOVA).
(D) FITC-Ab-APOJ complex was isolated by step gradient as in (A). Similar to LDL, Ab-CLU complex was taken up more efficiently by microglia compared to free
Ab (both at 0.1 mM concentration of Ab). Uptake of Ab-CLU complex was TREM2 dependent (n = 5, two-way ANOVA). All points were normalized to WT microglia
uptake of Ab complexes at 4 hr.
(E and F) Time course of degradation of Ab after uptake by WT versus Trem2 KO microglia. Microglia were incubated with either (E) free Ab or (F) Ab-LDL

t = 0 hr (immediately after Ab-containing media were removed and cells were washed) (n = 4, two-way ANOVA). Error bars represent SEM (***p < 0.001).

 et al., 2015). Here, starting from an unbiased screening of �1,500
STM and secreted proteins, we found that TREM2 interacts
selectively and directly with a set of apolipoproteins and lipopro-
tein particles, including two known risk factors for AD, CLU, and
APOE (Harold et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009; Saunders et al.,
1993; Strittmatter et al., 1993a). Independently, a recent study
identified APOE, APOA1, and APOA2 as putative TREM2 ligands
by TREM2-Fc fusion pulldown from cynomolgus cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and serum (Bailey et al., 2015). Using a candidate
approach, Atagi et al. (2015) showed that TREM2 can bind to
APOE, APOA1, and APOB in dot blot binding assays. Our study
confirms and extends TREM2 interactions with apolipoproteins
using high-throughput PM screening, backed by quantitative
BLI measurements. Of note, we find that hTREM2 binds to
CLU as well as APOE and that hTREM2 binding is greatly
enhanced by lipidation of these apolipoproteins, which reflects
their natural state in vivo (Calero et al., 1999, 2000; DeMattos
et al., 2001; Mahley and Rall, 2000). Consistent with this, we
found that hTREM2 interacts with multiple lipoprotein particles,
including LDL. It is possible that TREM2 binding to CLU was
not detected previously due to the lack of lipidation (Bailey
et al., 2015).
We performed a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the
effects of hTREM2 mutations on lipoprotein binding and uptake
into cells. All AD and NHD mutations impaired the ability of
hTREM2 to bind to LDL, CLU, and APOE. Interestingly, there
was a correlation between a complete loss of apo/lipoprotein
binding and the NHD mutants (Y38C and T66M) versus a partial
loss of binding and the AD-associated variants (R47H, R62H,
and D87N). The null-binding phenotype—and the homozygous
nature of the mutation—could explain the severity and early onset
of NHD relative to AD. Among the AD mutants, there is a correla-
tion between LDL and CLU binding (R47H and D87N more
severely impaired than R62H) and the degree of risk conferred
for AD (R47H has an odds ratio of �3 and R62H an odds ratio
of �1.5) (Cuyvers et al., 2014). The D87N variant is too rare for reli-
able estimation of its odds ratio. Importantly, the biochemical
binding data correlate with cellular uptake data: in general, the
NHD mutants of hTREM2 were more severely impaired than the
AD mutants in their ability to take up LDLor lipidated CLU into het-
erologous cells. In addition to disruption of lipoprotein binding
(which was directly tested in our study), TREM2 disease-associ-
ated mutations may also differentially affect cell surface expres-
sion of TREM2 protein (Kleinberger et al., 2014).
We sought to determine how the interactions between TREM2
and lipoproteins might be functionally relevant to the pathogen-
esis of AD, a disease characterized by abnormal Ab accumula-
tion in the brain. Consistent with the direct binding experiments
and heterologous cell uptake data, TREM2-deficient microglia
were defective in uptake of apo/lipoproteins such as LDL and
CLU. As the major phagocytic cell in the brain, microglia are pro-
posed to function in the clearance of Ab (Bradshaw et al., 2013;
El Khoury et al., 2007; Griciuc et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015;
Wyss-Coray et al., 2002). It is notable that oligomeric and aggre-
gated forms of Ab have been found to interact with recombinant
APOE as well as cell-, CSF-, and plasma-derived APOE (LaDu
et al., 1994; Strittmatter et al., 1993b; Tokuda et al., 2000; Wis-
niewski et al., 1993). We show here that Ab aggregates also
bind to lipidated CLU. Additionally, both APOE and CLU are
found in neuritic plaques (Calero et al., 2000; Namba et al.,
1991). Therefore, by binding directly to lipoproteins and internal-
izing them, TREM2 can function to scavenge toxic extracellular
molecules like Ab that associate with lipoprotein particles (esti-
mates range from 5% to 100% of Ab being associated with lipo-
proteins in human CSF) (LaDu et al., 2012; Verghese et al., 2013).
In support of this idea, we found that microglia are much more
efficient in the uptake of Ab aggregates when complexed with
LDL or lipidated CLU than Ab aggregates in the free state.
Remarkably, the uptake of Ab-LDL or Ab-CLU complexes by mi-
croglia depended on Trem2 in a gene dose-dependent manner,
such that even loss of a single copy of the Trem2 gene resulted in
an intermediate impairment of Ab-lipoprotein uptake. This obser-
vation is significant because AD risk is typically conferred by
TREM2 mutations in the heterozygous state (Guerreiro et al.,
2013c; Jonsson et al., 2013). Our data with MDMs from human
subjects support the thesis that a heterozygous mutation in
TREM2 (in this case R62H) can significantly impair microglial
uptake of Ab-lipoprotein complexes.
In addition to binding soluble Ab aggregates (this study; LaDu
et al., 1994; Strittmatter et al., 1993a; Tokuda et al., 2000; Wis-
niewski et al., 1993), the association of APOE and CLU with
neuritic plaques raises the possibility that microglia can attack
amyloid through TREM2 binding to apolipoproteins within the
plaque (Liao et al., 2014). Thus, APOE and CLU could facilitate

average intensity of matched control subjects at 4 hr. Association with LDL greatly boosted the uptake of Ab by human MDMs. TREM2 R62H carriers had reduced
uptake of Ab-LDL. Error bars represent SEM (***p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA).

 microglial Ab uptake and clearance by binding to soluble Ab
aggregates or by associating with Ab aggregates deposited in
amyloid plaques. By either mechanism, impairment or loss of
function of TREM2 would be expected to favor accumulation
of Ab in the brain. The functional significance of TREM2 binding
to lipoproteins and Ab-lipoprotein complexes remains to be
studied in vivo. Previous studies in the 5xFAD mouse model of
AD found that loss of TREM2 exacerbated amyloid pathology
(Wang et al., 2015), consistent with our hypothesis; however,
see Jay et al. (2015) for a conflicting conclusion.
Mild impairment of Ab uptake and clearance by microglia as a
result of reduced ability to bind apolipoproteins may explain why
those with heterozygous TREM2 mutations are predisposed to
amyloid accumulation during aging and hence LOAD. How do
TREM2 mutations cause NHD? We speculate that, in addition
to the binding of extracellular Ab, APOE and CLU lipoproteins
in the brain also bind to other extracellular aggregates and
cellular debris and thereby help TREM2-bearing microglia to
clean up apoptotic cells and other pathogenic protein aggre-
gates (Wyss-Coray, 2006). Indeed, APOE has been reported to
bind to apoptotic N2a cells and enhance the engulfment of
apoptotic N2a cell membranes by microglia (Atagi et al., 2015).
Impaired clearance of cellular and extracellular debris might
explain why severe TREM2 deficiency, such as occurs with
homozygous loss-of-function mutations, causes NHD and fron-
totemporal dementia (Giraldo et al., 2013; Guerreiro et al., 2013a,
2013b; Kondo et al., 2002; Paloneva et al., 2002).
The ability of TREM2 to bind two known AD risk factors (APOE
and CLU) and its strong influence on Ab uptake, via lipoprotein
association with Ab aggregates, could explain the large genetic
influence of TREM2 mutation on AD risk. Previous studies have
implicated other lipoprotein receptors, LDLR and LRP1, in Ab
metabolism, with deficiency of LDLR and a reduction in LRP1
expression increasing amyloid pathology (Basak et al., 2012;
Cao et al., 2006; Van Uden et al., 2002) and overexpression of
LDLR leading to lower plaque load in AD mouse models (Kim
et al., 2009). The interactions between TREM2 and CLU/APOE
biochemically link these three genetic risk factors and function-
ally connect innate immune cells and lipoproteins in AD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for experimental details
relating to materials and animals, protein expression and purification, pro-
tein-binding assays, cell culture, and preparation of Ab aggregates and Ab-li-
poprotein complexes.
PM Screen
Assembly of extracellular protein libraries, construction of PMs, automated
processing of microarrays, and microarray analyses have been described in
detail (Ramani et al., 2012; Tom et al., 2013). Briefly, TREM2-Fc or another
Fc-fusion protein was bound to Protein A-coated nanobeads (Miltenyi Biotec)
along with Cy5-labeled IgG as a fluorescent probe. Beads were incubated with
the microarrays for 45 min and washed with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, dried,
and scanned for Cy5 fluorescence on a GenePix 4000B scanner. Data were
analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). The down-
stream data processing methodology and the scoring system are described
in Tom et al. (2013). The score represents the average intensity of the replicate
spots for each protein on the microarray divided by the square root of the in-
tensity difference, plus a stabilizing factor that is empirically set to a value of 2.
This scoring mechanism penalizes for large differences between replicate spot
intensities, which may not represent robust binding events.
LDL, CLU, and APOE Uptake Assays
HEK293 hTREM2-Dox stable cell lines were grown in 96-well glass-bottom
Matriplates (Brooks) and incubated with 25 mg/ml DiI-AcLDL for the indicated
time before the cells were washed and incubated with CellTracker Green for
30 min at 37�C. Cells were washed and trypan blue was added to the cells
to quench extracellular DiI signal. The samples were imaged using an InCell
2000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Quantification of DiI signal, relative to
cell area (marked by CellTracker Green), was performed using InCell Devel-
oper (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
For DiI-LDL experiments, 80,000 primary microglia cells were seeded in 96-
well glass-bottom Matriplates (Brooks). DiI-LDL (25 mg/ml) was added to the
microglia and incubated for 4 hr. Cells were washed and incubated with
5 mg/ml Hoechst for 5–10 min to mark nuclei. Cells were washed and trypan
blue was added to cells to quench extracellular signal. Plates were imaged us-
ing an InCell 2000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Quantification of the DiI fluo-
rescence, relative to cell number (marked by Hoechst), was performed using
InCell Developer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
For human CLU and APOE uptake, HEK293 hTREM2-Dox cells were grown
in 48-well plates and induced with 1 mM Dox in 0% or 1% serum media over-
night. Cells were incubated for 2 hr with 3 mg/ml lipidated APOE or CLU in the
presence of 1% BSA. Cells were washed extensively with Hank’s balanced
salt solution (HBSS) before cell lysis and analysis via SDS-PAGE.
For CLU and APOE uptake by microglia, ACM was added to microglia cells in
the presence of chloroquine (30 mM) to inhibit degradation. Cells were harvested
at indicated times and lysates were used to perform SDS-PAGE analysis.
Ab Uptake and Degradation
Primary microglia or MDMs were serum starved overnight before the addition of
Ab, Ab-LDL, or Ab-CLU. Following a period of time for Ab uptake, cells were dis-
lodged using enzyme-free PBS-based cell dissociation buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Cells were washed and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer (13
PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% sodium azide) and kept on ice. Sytox blue staining
was used to identify live cells. Flow cytometry was done using LSRFortessa
(BD Biosciences) and the mean FITC/DiI fluorescence intensity was analyzed.
For Ab degradation experiments, microglia cultures were incubated with
free Ab aggregates (0.1 mM) or Ab-LDL complexes (0.01 mM Ab) for 2 hr, after
which they were washed with media and placed back into fresh media. Cells
were lysed at 0, 1, 3, 5, or 7 hr, and the amount of remaining Ab in the cell lysate
was measured by Meso Scale Diagnostics immunoassays.
