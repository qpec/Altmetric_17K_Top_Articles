Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of abortion in Ecuador from 2004 to 2014 and 
compare the prevalence between the public and the private health care systems.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of the overall mortality and morbidity rate due to 
abortion in Ecuador, based on public health records and other government databases.
Results: From 2004 to 2014, a total of 431,614 spontaneous abortions, miscarriage and other 
types of abortions were registered in Ecuador. The average annual rate of abortion was 115 
per 1,000 live births. The maternal mortality rate was found to be 43 per 100,000 live births.
Conclusions: Abortion is a significant and wide-ranging problem in Ecuador. The study sup-
ports the perception that in spite of legal restrictions to abortion in Ecuador, women are still 
terminating pregnancies when they feel they need to do so. The public health system reported 
>84% of the national overall prevalence.

abortion, metrotexate, misoprostol 
Introduction
Every minute there are on average 255 births worldwide1 from around 210  
million 
pregnancies annually. Eighty million of those pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted 
and 1 in 2 of these are terminated before birth, representing more than 41 million 
abortions a year.2–5 About 47,000 women die every year due to complications from 
unsafe abortions, 86% of which occur in developing countries.6–8 Unsafe and clan-
destine abortions represent a great risk for women and therefore are an urgent public 
health matter.
Studies have shown that banning elective termination of pregnancy is associated 
with an increase in clandestine abortion practices and associated medical complica-
tions that arise when abortions are performed under unsafe conditions.6,9 In some 
South American countries, such as Ecuador, Peru and Colombia, elective abortion is 
criminalized under most circumstances.10,11 However, there are a few Latin American 
countries and territories, such as Puerto Rico, Cuba, Uruguay and Mexico, where there 
are legal grounds that allow women to terminate unwanted pregnancies.12,13 In South 
America, the rates of unsafe abortion are one of the highest in the world.14
Restrictive laws for abortion and clandestine and unsafe practices to terminate 
pregnancy become even more relevant in the current Zika virus outbreak. Zika virus 
has been linked to severe neurological malformations in babies born from infected 
mothers. This has increased the demand for pregnancy termination in Latin American 
countries.15–17 Clandestine and unsafe abortions are more common in poor and very

young women who lack access to medical services and, 
unfortunately, these women are also the ones who might be 
most affected by the Zika outbreak.14,15
Ecuador has prohibited any form of induced abortion 
since 1837, when the first Penal Code of Conduct was 
published.18 This code stated that abortions could not be 
requested by women for any economic, social or personal 
reason. Furthermore, abortions were considered illegal 
regardless of fetal wellbeing.19 In January 2014, the Penal 
Code of Conduct was ratified and therapeutic abortion was 
approved under specific circumstances that were limited to 
mentally ill or incompetent women who had been raped or 
cases where the woman’s physical or mental health was in 
direct danger as a result of the pregnancy itself.19,20
A study published in 1990 by The Bull Institute shows that 
there was a notable increase in the overall rate of abortions in 
Ecuador from 1964 to 1988.21 However, the lack of data from 
that period makes it difficult to ascertain whether the increase 
was due to an incremental rise in the number of miscarriages 
or induced abortions, or simply to an improvement in data 
collection. The study identified social determinants that were 
linked to abortion. It showed that most unwanted pregnan-
cies occurred in the rural, mountainous regions of Ecuador, 
typically within low-income families.22 The validity of these 
findings is difficult to prove, due to widespread underreport-
ing of intentionally induced abortions, most likely due to the 
legal consequences previously described.4,6,23
Although there are legal constraints that limit access to 
abortion services in Ecuador, access to some drugs such as 
misoprostol, an off-label abortive pill, is possible. Misopro-
stol is a prostaglandin E1 analog with regulatory approval in 
Ecuador to treat gastroduodenal ulcers but can also be used to 
induce abortion, either as oral pills or by vaginal placement.24 
Misoprostol and its off-label indications as an abortive pill 
works when taken before the 63rd day of gestation, having a 
reported success rate for pregnancy termination higher than 
90% if done within this time frame.24–29
The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of 
abortion in Ecuador from 2004 to 2014 as well as to describe 
its current trends. At the same time, we compared the preva-
lence of abortion between the public and private health care 
systems in Ecuador. Finally, we report the current trends in 
misoprostol marketing in the country in order to find if there 
is any correlation between the annual misoprostol consump-
tion and the annual abortion rate.
Methods
National, provincial and regional data were analyzed from 
the Ministry of Public Health’s national databases of Vital 
Statistics Deaths and Births Databases from 2004 to 2014, 
Hospital Discharges Database from 2004 to 2014 and the 
Population Census of the National Institute of Census and 
Statistics (INEC) from 2010. Data includes annual hospital 
cases, mortality, and number of live births. Demographic 
characteristics of women including age, province of resi-
dency and type of establishment were analyzed. The number 
of units of off-label abortive drugs sold was obtained from 
local purchase of medications retrieved from government 
pharmaceutical company Enfarma EP
, up to 2015.
We used the following terms to retrieve the information 
corresponding to the International Classification of Diseases 
10th revision (ICD-10): Medically Justified abortion (ICD 
O04), spontaneous abortion (ICD O03) and other pregnancies 
that resulted in abortion (ICD O00-O02, O05-O08).
The data used is public, anonymized, thus the local regula-
tory agency does not require an IRB approval or ethics review.
We performed a Pearson correlation in order to find if 
there is any correlation between the use of the misoprostol 
off-label abortive pill with the rate of abortion in Ecuador, 
assuming the distribution of abortion rate and of misoprostol 
were both normally distributed. The raw data was analyzed, 
saved and managed within the Microsoft Excel™ software 
and episheet stat open source statistical software was used 
for descriptive and frequency analyses. References cita-
tion and retrieval were managed by Zotero Open Source 
Software version 4.0.11. Spatial analysis was performed 
using QGIS 2.8. 
Results
Prevalence of abortion in Ecuador
Between 2004 and 2014, a total of 431,614 miscarriages and 
abortions that met any of the ICD-10 abortion classifications 
(spontaneous abortion, justified medical abortion or other 
pregnancies that ended in abortion) were reported in Ecuador 
within the national Hospital Discharges Database (Table 1).
The number of annual spontaneous and induced 
abortion registrations combined ranged from 33,132 in 
2004 (108/1,000) to over 40,256 (124/1,000) in 2013 and 
decreased to 35,711 (112/1,000) in 2014 when the abortion 
ban was ratified.

Overall mortality and morbidity rates due to abortion in Ecuador
From 2004 to 2014, there was an annual average of 
39,236 abortions, and 2011 reported the highest number ever 
recorded, reaching more than 42,500 abortions countrywide.
There is an inter-annual variability in registered abor-
tion rates. The average rate of abortions during the evalu-
ated period (2004 to 2014) was 115 per 1,000 live births 
 
(Figure 1). The rate of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 
was 7.86 in 2004 and 13.43 in 2010. From 2004 to 2014, 
189 abortion-related deaths were reported to the Ministry 
of Health (Table 2), resulting in a maternal mortality rate of 
44 per 100,000 registered abortions.
Geographical distribution of abortion  
in Ecuador
During the evaluated period (2004 to 2014), we found that all 
the provinces in Ecuador reported a considerably high num-
ber of abortions in absolute numbers and abortions to birth 
ratios. A significant geographic difference in the number of 
abortions is reported countrywide. When all the data from the 
last 11 years were plotted, we found the highest numbers to be 
reported in the biggest and most populated province. Guayas 
reported a total number of 696,038 abortions in the last 11 
years, followed by Pichincha (487,344) Manabí (266,348) 
Los Ríos (154,487) and Azuay (130,358) (Figure 2).
When we compared the number of abortions with the 
number of births per province, we found that other provinces 
were at the top of the list. The highest abortion ratios by the 
number of births was found in Pastaza, a province with a 
ratio of 186/1,000 births, followed by Pichincha (174/1,000), 
Guayas (166/1,000), Galapagos Islands (165/1,000), and 
Esmeraldas with (164/1,000), (Figure 3).
Private versus public health system
The results show that 84.3% of abortions were managed 
within the public health system, while 15.7% occurred 
within all the clinics and hospitals from the private for-profit 
and non-profit subsystems. The majority of cases that were 
reported within the public health system came from hospitals 
of the Ministry of Public Health (88%), while the rest were 
seen among hospitals from the Army, Police, some Universi-
ties, local governments and other charitable centers (12%). 
Women who received medical attention within the private 
health care system were distributed among the private for-
profit (87%) and non-profit private centers (13%).

Misoprostol consumption in Ecuador
According to the annual government expenditure on drugs 
and the private pharmaceutical consumption given by 
Enfarma EP database, during the last 9 years, misoprostol 
sold an average of 70,000 tablets per year. We performed a 
Pearson correlation to find if there is any correlation between 
the use of this off-label abortive pill with the rate of abor-
tion in Ecuador. The results show that a weak trend may be

Overall mortality and morbidity rates due to abortion in Ecuador
indicated between abortion rates and units of misoprostol 
sold in Ecuador (r=0.63, p=0.069); however, these results 
were not statistically significant as we set the p-value at 
p<0.05 (Figure 4).
Discussion
Although abortion rates in women of childbearing age have 
shown an important reduction in the last two decades, the 
data in developing countries is not always available.30 In 
countries with similar socioeconomic situation, abortion 
rates per every 1,000 births average 34 to 45 abortions per 
1,000 women of childbearing age.31 Understanding abortion 
rates and demographic distribution among women in South 
America and Ecuador is important in order to establish the 
basis of the problem, to provoke further research, and also 
to encourage deeper analysis with the objective of providing 
good evidence to support policy making. Our findings are 
an important part of demonstrating the basis of abortion in 
Ecuador.
In Ecuador this preventable condition and its impact on 
women’s wellbeing and the entire health system, including 
the economic impact of the disability-adjusted life year and 
the related quality-adjusted life year measurements have not 
being evaluated yet; however, authorities are concerned with 
the increasingly higher numbers being reported to the national 
database.32 According to the data collected, women undergo-
ing a medically justified abortion (ICD O04), spontaneous 
abortion (ICD O03) and other types of pregnancies that 
resulted in abortion (ICD O00-O02, O05-O08) are seeking 
medical care within the public health system rather than the 
private system 333,963 (84%) vs 61,940 (16%). This might 
indicate that poorer women with less education and poorer 
access to health care are the ones seeking medical attention 
if an abortion is inevitable.33
Due to the lack of data, the causes of differences in abor-
tion ratios by province have not been studied yet; however, 
cultural, educational and better health care systems might be 
related to the higher number of abortions among the most 
populated provinces.34 When we compared the number of 
abortions with the number of children born each year, we 
observed that Pastaza, one of the least populated provinces 
with high cultural diversity, reported more abortions than any 
other provinces with numbers totaling 186/1,000 births. This 
trend might support the fact that some places with lower edu-
cation levels and poorer access to health care infrastructure 
have higher rates of abortion among their women, forcing 
them to travel long distances in many cases to obtain the 
procedure.35,36
Although we are unable to distinguish between arbitrarily 
induced or self-induced abortions and miscarriages in this 
study, the data support evidence from prior studies that 
some women in Ecuador are intentionally terminating their 
pregnancies despite the ban on abortions.21,23,34 Interestingly, 
during the analyses, we found that abortion rates had declined 
in 2014. This behavior might correspond to the fact that dur-
ing 2014 the new Organic Penal Code was approved, which 
punished abortion with up to 2 years of jail time either to the 
health care provider or to the woman who was aborting.19 In 
our experience, and partially supported by our results, abor-
tion is intentionally induced in many women countrywide.21

Ortiz-Prado et al
We suspect that this is often accomplished through the use 
of misoprostol to induce cervix dilation.37–39
Despite the fact that the use of these medications for 
the purpose of causing abortions is not indicated for those 
without a physician’s prescription, more than 75% of drugs 
that require a prescription in Ecuador are sold without one.40 
Thus, obtaining misoprostol, might not be that difficult.41,42 
Other medications that are widely used as abortive pills 
(eg, mifepristone) are not publicly available in Ecuador.
The wide availability of potential medicines that can 
cause abortion allows women to affect the course of their 
pregnancies without proper medical assistance or counseling.
We believe clandestine abortions are often documented as 
“spontaneous” or “medically justified abortions”.14,43 Doctors 
are prohibited from performing any procedure that is intended 
to terminate unwanted pregnancy.19 However, when women 
arrive at the emergency room (ER) with vaginal bleeding 
(presumably due to self-induced cervix dilation with misopro-
stol), documentation of the ER service automatically changes 
to “spontaneous abortion” or “medically justified abortion”. 
Thus, causality is extremely difficult to demonstrate.25,44
Once the discussion focuses on rights, evidence, and 
figures, politicians will understand that women who want 
to abort will do so, regardless of where or with whom they 
do it.45
Despite the results, we experienced important limita-
tions that were out of our control, including the informa-
tion available that did not allow for differentiation between 
self-induced abortions and miscarriages. Additionally, we 
do not have any information about a number of unreported 
instrumental or procedural abortions that occur in clan-
destine facilities or those that occurred at home after self-
administration of abortive pills and did not cause significant 
complications.46
Conclusion
In Ecuador, abortion is a public health concern, affecting 
more than 39,000 women every year. Since abortion is a 
highly controversial subject, and due to many sociocultural 
factors that influence public perception of the procedure, 
self-induced abortions might be very difficult to demonstrate 
and quantify in this study.
On the other hand, since demonstrating the presence of 
clandestine abortions is complicated, the relationship between 
misoprostol/abortion rates might offer some clue regarding 
the presence of this health problem, although this issue needs 
to be investigated thoroughly due to the severe health risks 
that these drugs pose to women terminating pregnancies.
The study supports the perception that in spite of legal 
restrictions to abortion in Ecuador, women are still terminat-
ing pregnancies when they feel they need to do so. Experience 
from developed countries shows that legal and open access 
pregnancy termination services reduce mortality related 
to abortion and its complications. Abortion restrictions in 
Ecuador have not reduced the practice of clandestine or 
unconventional pregnancy terminations. Although more 
study is required, it would be wise to encourage discussion 
within the public policy sector regarding access to medically 
controlled termination of pregnancies in order to reduce any 
more unnecessary deaths in women.
