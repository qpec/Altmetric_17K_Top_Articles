Purpose: Treating pain in primary care is challenging. Primary care providers (PCPs) receive 
limited training in pain care and express low confidence in their knowledge and ability to man-
age pain effectively. Models to improve pain outcomes have been developed, but not formally 
implemented in safety net practices where pain is particularly common. This study evaluated 
the impact of implementing the Stepped Care Model for Pain Management (SCM-PM) at a 
large, multisite Federally Qualified Health Center.
Methods: The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework 
guided the implementation of the SCM-PM. The multicomponent intervention included: educa-
tion on pain care, new protocols for pain assessment and management, implementation of an 
opioid management dashboard, telehealth consultations, and enhanced onsite specialty resources. 
Participants included 25 PCPs and their patients with chronic pain (3,357 preintervention and 
4,385 postintervention) cared for at Community Health Center, Inc. Data were collected from 
the electronic health record and supplemented by chart reviews. Surveys were administered to 
PCPs to assess knowledge, attitudes, and confidence.
Results: Providers’ pain knowledge scores increased to an average of 11% from baseline; self-
rated confidence in ability to manage pain also increased. Use of opioid treatment agreements 
and urine drug screens increased significantly by 27.3% and 22.6%, respectively. Significant 
improvements were also noted in documentation of pain, pain treatment, and pain follow-up. 
Referrals to behavioral health providers for patients with pain increased by 5.96% (P=0.009). 
There was no significant change in opioid prescribing.
Conclusion: Implementation of the SCM-PM resulted in clinically significant improvements in 
several quality of pain care outcomes. These findings, if sustained, may translate into improved 
patient outcomes.

Background
There are over 100 million people in the US with chronic pain, costing an estimated 
$635 billion each year for medical treatment and lost productivity.1 The majority of 
these patients seek help for their pain from a primary care provider (PCP),2 account-
ing for up to a third of all visits to primary care.3,4 However, the quality of pain care 
in primary care remains poor.5–7 PCPs receive little education about pain management 
during medical training5–8 and lack confidence in their ability to manage chronic pain 
effectively.3,9–11 Guidelines for the appropriate management of pain have had a limited 
impact as evidenced by low rates of adherence to recommendations for documentation12

and management of pain.13–15 Studies reveal wide variation in 
the levels of prescribing of opioid analgesics among PCPs,16,17 
but overall, there has been a marked increase in their use and 
misuse over the past 10 years.18 Evidence now suggests that 
opioid analgesics are associated with a significant, dose-
dependent risk of serious harm, with limited evidence for 
their long-term benefits.19–21
A comprehensive effort to change the health profession-
als’ performance in pain care that goes beyond the educational 
curricula and focuses on changing culture and systems of 
care is needed.22 The American Academy of Pain Medicine 
advocates the use of the Stepped Care Model for Pain Man-
agement (SCM-PM), with primary care-based screening and 
routine management of most cases of pain, and the addition 
of further resources for more complex cases in a stepwise 
fashion. In 2009, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
called for implementation of the SCM-PM across the VHA 
system.23 Since then, the model has been implemented in 
several VHA centers and shown to improve patient out-
comes for pain.24–27 A large VHA practice in Connecticut 
implemented the SCM-PM (known as Project STEP) and 
described the implementation. Preliminary results suggest 
system-wide benefits.25,28
The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact 
of implementing the SCM-PM on the quality of pain care 
in a large, state-wide multisite Federally Qualified Health 
Center (FQHC).
Methods
Setting
Community Health Center, Inc. (CHCI) is a state-wide 
FQHC providing comprehensive, primary care in 12 primary 
care health centers across Connecticut. CHCI cares for over 
140,000 patients, 68% of whom are racial/ethnic minorities; 
over 90% are below 200% federal poverty level, 70% have 
health insurance provided by Medicaid, and 22% are uninsured. 
Specialist care, including pain-related specialties, is available 
through outside consultation, but many patients face substan-
tial barriers to securing such care. The study sample for this 
project included all PCPs at CHCI who cared for adult patients 
(internists, family practitioners, family nurse practitioners, and 
physician assistants) and were present for the 3-year duration 
of the intervention, and all adult patients with at least one 
medical visit in the previous year who were under the care 
of the providers in the study. Patients with chronic pain were 
identified by a validated algorithm using commonly available 
electronic health record (EHR) data elements (diagnosis codes, 
pain scores, and medication prescribing information).28
Procedures
Project “STEP-ing Out” was a 3-year project implementing 
and evaluating the SCM-PM at CHCI. The intervention took 
place between March 2011 and February 2014. This study was 
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
of CHCI. A waiver of informed consent was granted by the IRB 
due to the large scale, retrospective data that was being evalu-
ated. Results of a comprehensive baseline assessment of pain 
management practices and outcomes throughout the organiza-
tion have been described elsewhere.3 Results of this assessment, 
covering a 1-year period from April 2010 through March 2011, 
revealed that chronic pain was highly prevalent among CHCI’
s 
patients. Providers had low confidence in their knowledge of 
pain, limited adherence to opioid practice guidelines, wide 
variation in the levels of prescribing of opioid medications, 
and poor-quality documentation of pain care. Despite the high 
rate of coexistent behavioral health and addiction disorders, the 
rate of referral to onsite behavioral health providers was low.
Intervention
The SCM-PM calls for an individualized approach to 
managing pain in three steps.29 Step 1 emphasizes the role 
of the primary care clinician in identifying and discussing 
the patient’s pain concerns and developing a treatment plan 
focusing on self-management and primary care-based inter-
ventions. Step 2 involves additional resources and collabora-
tive treatment, including behavioral health assessment and 
intervention, medication, and consultations with specialists 
from appropriate disciplines. Step 3 focuses on patients with 
chronic pain requiring significantly more care and involve-
ment from other members of a pain management team. 
Minor modifications were made to the SCM-PM (Figure 1) 
to account for the limited access to specialty consultation 
in the safety net setting by providing more care on site and 
through videoconferencing. Specifically, greater emphasis 
was placed on the use of onsite and telehealth resources to 
account for the limited access to outside specialty care that 
characterizes the safety net setting. The Promoting Action 
on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) 
framework30,31 was used to guide the process of implementing 
the SCM-PM. This framework defines the critical elements – 
context, evidence, and facilitation – for the successful imple-
mentation of evidence-based practices.31–36 Details on how 
the PARIHS framework was employed for this project have 
been previously published.3 Context was assessed through 
organizational surveys, staff interviews, and queries of the 
EHR. Evidence included guidelines and findings from the 
medical literature, knowledge assessments completed by

The stepped care model for pain care in a community health center 
primary care providers, and patient chart reviews. A detailed 
facilitation plan that included quality improvement strate-
gies, data dashboards, and engagement of front line staff 
across the organization was employed to support project 
implementation.
The project’s interventions consisted of six educational 
and practice support components. The intervention compo-
nents were introduced between 2011 and 2012 (see Figure 2 
for timeline).
• 
Provider continuing medical education (CME): An 
agency-wide grand rounds-style presentation was deliv-
ered in person and through videoconference and was fol-
lowed by subsequent biannual pain CME  
presentations. 
These presentations included  
discussions of pain care 
best practices and review of online CME modules about 
pain management and opioid prescribing.
• 
EHR pain templates: EHR templates for the initial and 
follow-up visits related to chronic pain were created 
to help improve documentation of pain assessment 
and treatment.
• 
Chronic pain and opioid prescribing policy: CHCI 
established a new chronic pain and opioid pre-
scribing policy requiring a signed opioid treatment 
agreement (OTA), a urine drug test (UDT) at least 
once in every 6 months, and a functional assessment

using the Pain Interference Assessment Tool Patient

( 
PROMIS) Pain Interference Short Form 8a (SF8a)37 
every 3 months for all patients receiving chronic 
opioid therapy (COT). COT was defined as receipt 
of 90 days or more of an opioid analgesic in 1 year.
• 
Opioid management dashboard: A new dashboard 
with key metrics for managing patients receiving 
COT was introduced that included the number and 
percentage of adult patients receiving COT in each 
PCP’s panel, as well as the number of patients with: 
1) a signed OTA, 2) an UDT screen within the past 6 
months, 3) a completed pain interference assessment 
questionnaire within the past 3 months, and 4) at least 
one behavioral health visit in the past year. Provid-
ers could also access a list of their individual COT 
patients and determine which patients were due for 
any of these items.
• 
Onsite specialty resources: Additional onsite 
resources, including chiropractic care, pain-focused 
behavioral health interventions, and buprenorphine 
treatment, were added to provide options for collab-
orative, multimodal care for more complex patients 
who failed to improve with routine primary care 
management. As part of the educational intervention, 
medical teams were educated regarding multimodal 
care, the role of chiropractic care, and the importance 
of behavioral health evaluation and treatment for 
chronic pain.
• 
Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes 
(ECHO) pain: To provide virtual access to pain spe-
cialists, Project ECHO for pain care38 was introduced 
at CHCI, providing weekly videoconferences for 
selected PCPs during which they could present com-
plex pain cases to an expert multidisciplinary team 
of pain specialists. One provider from each CHCI 
practice site joined the weekly sessions to serve as 
the onsite pain “champion”.
Measures
To broaden the scope of the evaluation, Moore et al’s 
expanded outcomes framework was used to assess learners 
and evaluate instructional activities.39 Based on this frame-
work, the evaluation included conventional educational 
outcomes such as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs, but 
additionally included outcomes such as clinician’s adher-
ence to guidelines, patient-reported pain scores, and opioid 
prescribing information.
The KnowPain-50 (KP50) survey40 was used to assess 
provider’s knowledge regarding pain management. The KP50 
contains multiple choice questions as well as questions scored 
on a six-point Likert scale with an overall maximum  
possible 
score of 250. In addition, to assess PCPs’ self-efficacy and 
attitudes about pain care, a set of eleven questions taken 
from a VHA-developed survey was used.41 All CHCI PCPs 
included in the study were invited to complete the KP50 
and pain attitudes surveys. The survey administration was 
conducted anonymously at baseline and following the conclu-
sion of the intervention in March 2013, in order to increase 
the response rates and to overcome the reluctance of PCPs 
to have their knowledge formally assessed.
To assess changes in pain care quality, structured data 
from CHCI’s EHR were pulled for patients with chronic pain 
seen during the 1-year period prior to the intervention (from 
March 2010 to February 2011) and compared to data for 
patients with pain seen during the year after the interven-
tion, between March 2013 and February 2014. These data 
were supplemented by a random sample of chart reviews. 
Patients with chronic pain were identified using a validated 
algorithm28 that used data from the EHR, including pain 
scores, medication prescribing, and billing codes. For the 
final analysis, only charts for patients belonging to provid-
ers who were employed at CHCI for the duration of the 
intervention were included. All patients with chronic pain 
were included in the electronic data analysis. Data points 
included patient demographics, medications prescribed, 
pain scores, use of OTA, UDT, functional assessments, 
and referrals to behavioral health, chiropractic, and other 
outside specialists.
Supplemental chart reviews were conducted to assess pro-
viders’ documentation of pain care using the Pain Care Qual-
ity extraction tool.25 The tool contains 12 indicators grouped 
into three domains: pain assessment, pain treatment, and pain 
reassessment. The tool utilizes a dichotomous scoring system 
to indicate whether each indicator was present or absent in 
each progress note.42 Three hundred charts were randomly 
selected for the baseline and postintervention reviews.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with use 
of multiple-group models in Mplus43 that accounts for the 
clustering within provider (using the “complex” type option) 
and “xtmixed” analyses for the clustered data in Stata data 
analysis and statistical software version 14 (StataCorp Stata 
Statistical Software, College Station, TX, USA). All tests 
were two-sided and considered significant at P<0.05.

The stepped care model for pain care in a community health center 
Results
Table 1 shows a cross-sectional analysis of the demographic 
characteristics of participating providers’ patients with 
chronic pain at baseline and postintervention. Characteristics 
of patients did not change significantly over the duration of 
the project, although there was an increase in the total num-
ber of patients with pain, consistent with overall growth in 
patient volume across CHCI during this timeframe. Patients 
with chronic pain were more likely to be female. Nearly half 
were nonwhite, and over 65% had state-funded Medicaid 
insurance. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the 25 PCPs 
who participated in all 3 years of the intervention.
PCPs’ knowledge and attitudes about 
pain care
The anonymous surveys of CHCI providers revealed an aver-
age score of 152.5 on the KP50 in the baseline  
assessment 
period, which increased to 169.5 (P=0.001) in March 2013 
following the intervention. Self-efficacy was higher among 
providers completing the attitudes and beliefs survey 
 
following the intervention, compared to those completing 
it during the baseline period. The average rate of agreement 
with the statement “I am confident in my ability to manage 
chronic pain” was 2.71 at baseline and 4.67 in March 2013 
(on 1–6 scale, where 1 is strongly disagree and 6 is strongly 
agree).
Pain care quality
The quality of pain care improved in several areas following 
the intervention. During the baseline period, only 360 (34%) 
of the 1,309 patients receiving COT had a documented OTA 
in the chart and 680 (64%) had a UDT in the preceding year. 
After implementation, 778 (61%) out of 1,230 patients receiv-
ing COT had an OTA and 1,103 (87%) had a UDT in the past 
year (both differences significant at P<0.05). The quality of 
documentation also improved following the intervention. 
Table 3 shows the results of the review of a randomly selected 
sample of 14 providers’ patients’ charts. While not all provid-
ers routinely used the new EHR templates, documentation 
improved in several areas. Documentation of the presence 
of pain and the source and/or cause of pain increased signifi-
cantly from 64% to 82% (P=0.001) and from 62% to 74% 
(P=0.025), respectively. There were also significant improve-
ments in documentation of functional status from 5% to 19%

(P=0.001), in a documented treatment plan from 92% to 98% 
(P=0.002), and in documentation of pain reassessment from 
17% to 39% (P=0.001).
Table 4 shows the cross-sectional data for all patients 
with chronic pain in the years pre- and postintervention, 
who were cared for by the 25 providers in the intervention. 
Results demonstrate statistically significant increases in the 
percentage of patients with pain who had a visit with an 
onsite behavioral health provider. Referrals to chiropractors 
also increased significantly for both groups, while there was a 
significant decline in referrals to neurosurgery or  
orthopedic 
surgery and to pain specialists. There was no significant 
decline in opioid prescribing.
Discussion
This study demonstrated improvement in knowledge, self-
efficacy, adherence to guidelines, and documentation of care 
for patients with chronic pain, associated with implementing 
the SCM-PM across a large, state-wide safety net health 
system. The intervention was also associated with changes 
in monitoring and follow-up of patients receiving COT for 
pain, and with an overall increase in referrals to behavioral 
health providers and a decrease in referrals to surgical sub-
specialties and pain management. These changes were all in 
the direction predicted by the project model and suggested 
that the combined elements of the intervention were having 
the desired effect and leading to changes in how providers 
treated patients with pain.
While many of the changes observed in the study were 
modest, they were significant both from a statistical and an 
organizational perspective, reflecting positive changes across 
a large organization with 12 practice sites and over 130,000 
medically underserved patients. Given the challenge of stan-
dardizing care and implementing a complex intervention in 
a large, under-resourced environment, the achievement of 
measurable changes in these process measures on such a 
large scale is important. Based on these findings, CHCI has 
fully implemented and committed to sustaining the initiative 
and augmenting the model as needed to achieve more robust 
improvements in pain care across all of its practice locations.
The goal of this intervention was to change providers’ 
behaviors and improve the process of care for patients with 
pain. These results suggest that it did so. Implicit in this goal, 
however, is the assumption that such process changes will 
have an impact, further downstream, on patient outcomes. 
Such patient outcomes are harder to measure and will likely 
take time to realize. Further studies are needed to evaluate 
changes in patient outcomes and to fully assess the impact 
and value of this intervention.
One of the most significant challenges to implementing 
the SCM-PM was providing access to specialty expertise and 
guidance for more complex patients who failed to improve 
with primary care-based treatment and management. Limited 
access to pain care, particularly for racial and ethnic minori-
ties and patients with lower socioeconomic status, has been 
well documented.44,45 Project ECHO, a novel strategy to pro-
vide education and consultation from pain specialists, helped 
overcome this obstacle.46 Further research is underway to 
evaluate the specific impact of Project ECHO, but experience 
suggests that it augmented the ability to effectively manage 
complex patients with pain in primary care.
The baseline assessment identified that staff had sig-
nificant concerns about time and resources available to suc-
cessfully make changes in pain management practices.3 To 
address this, dedicated time was provided for educational 
activities and team-based strategies were developed to help 
share the work of pain management among different members 
of the clinical team. The addition of onsite chiropractors and

The stepped care model for pain care in a community health center 
the strengthening of behavioral health integration through 
colocation and open scheduling provided added resources 
that clinicians could offer to their patients, in addition to, or 
in place of opioid analgesics. Selected providers were given 
the opportunity to join Project ECHO and become local, 
onsite pain experts. Findings suggest that this strategy was 
successful, with referrals to onsite behavioral health providers 
and chiropractors increasing.
One strength of this study was the use of a validated 
identification algorithm to identify patients with chronic pain. 
This allowed for an analysis of the impact of the intervention 
on a broad population of patients with chronic pain without 
relying solely on specific diagnoses such as back pain. The 
diversity of locations and the large scale of implementation 
in a state-wide, multisite delivery system also was an asset. In 
addition, the integrated EHR and data warehouse allowed col-
lection of detailed medical and behavioral health data along 
with medications, laboratory results, and referrals. Use of the 
PARIHS framework also provided a strong implementation 
framework to guide the process.
This project had several limitations. First, the evaluation 
focused on process measures and did not include measures 
of patient outcomes other than pain scores. Subsequent 
work should include more robust patient assessments to help 
determine if such process changes ultimately impact patients. 
Studies of the SCM-PM in the VHA have employed cluster 
randomized designs and applied complex analytics to account 
for lack of randomization.24,25 However, conducting such a 
study in a large, multisite FQHC presented challenges that 
precluded such approaches. The interventions employed in 
this study, such as templates and dashboards, were imple-
mented agency-wide and could not be limited to selected 
practices. As such, randomization was not possible, limiting 
the ability to eliminate unmeasured confounders. Also, the 
use of multiple components in the intervention prevents draw-
ing any inference on the relative impact of each individual 
element. Provider turnover, which ranged from 11% to 20% 
over the project, also limited the number of providers included 
in the analysis. Lastly, the interventions were introduced in 
phases over the 3-year project, limiting the ability to evaluate 
the impact of any one element of the intervention.
There is a compelling need to improve the management 
of pain in primary care, especially in medically underserved 
settings. Pain management must become a core competency 
of primary care, with the providers being well educated and 
trained in the proper assessment, management, and follow-up 
of pain. In light of the growing epidemic of prescription opioid 
abuse and diversion, PCPs need training and support to apply 
appropriate risk mitigation strategies and take a more  
judicious 
approach to the prescribing of opioids for management of 
COT based on the principles of universal precautions.47
This initiative focused heavily on provider education and 
protocol-driven care and demonstrated modest but significant 
improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, and adherence to 
guidelines. In addition, positive changes in referral patterns 
and opioid prescribing suggest that structured improvement 
initiatives based on data and effective conceptual models 
can lead not only to increased knowledge acquisition, but 
also application of that knowledge in ways that have direct 
impact on patient care. These changes are likely to result in 
reduced pain, improved patient safety, and more confident, 
knowledgeable, satisfied health care teams.
