Abstract
Background
Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups tend to experience more harm from the same
level of exposure to alcohol as advantaged groups. Alcohol has multiple biological effects
on the cardiovascular system, both potentially harmful and protective. We investigated
whether the diverging relationships between alcohol drinking patterns and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) mortality differed by life course socioeconomic position (SEP).
Methods and findings
From 3 cohorts (the Counties Studies, the Cohort of Norway, and the Age 40 Program, 1987–
2003) containing data from population-based cardiovascular health surveys in Norway, we
included participants with self-reported information on alcohol consumption frequency (n =
207,394) and binge drinking episodes (�5 units per occasion, n = 32,616). We also used data
from national registries obtained by linkage. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for CVD mortality was estimated using Cox models, including alcohol, life course SEP,
age, gender, smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure,
heart rate, triglycerides, diabetes, history of CVD, and family history of coronary heart disease
(CHD). Analyses were performed in the overall sample and stratified by high, middle, and low
strata of life course SEP. A total of 8,435 CVD deaths occurred during the mean 17 years of
follow-up. Compared to infrequent consumption (<once/month), moderately frequent con-
sumption (2–3 times per week) was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality (HR = 0.78,
95% CI 0.72, 0.84) overall. HRs for the high, middle, and low strata of SEP were 0.66 (95% CI
0.58, 0.76), 0.87 (95% CI 0.78, 0.97), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.64, 0.98), respectively, compared
with infrequent users in each stratum. HRs for effect modification were 1.30 (95% CI 1.10,
1.54, p = 0.002; middle versus high), 1.23 (95% CI 0.96, 1.58, p = 0.10; low versus high),
and 0.96 (95% CI 0.76, 1.21, p = 0.73; low versus middle). In the group with data on binge

 drinking, 2,284 deaths (15 years) from CVDs occurred. In comparison to consumers who did
not binge during the past year, HRs among frequent bingers (�1 time per week) were 1.58
(95% CI 1.31, 1.91) overall, and 1.22 (95% CI 0.84, 1.76), 1.71 (95% CI 1.31, 2.23), and 1.85
(95% CI 1.16, 2.94) in the strata, respectively. HRs for effect modification were 1.36 (95% CI
0.87, 2.13, p = 0.18; middle versus high), 1.63 (95% CI 0.92, 2.91, p = 0.10; low versus high),
and 1.32 (95% CI 0.79, 2.20, p = 0.29; low versus middle). A limitation of this study was the
use of a single measurement to reflect lifetime alcohol consumption.
Conclusions
Moderately frequent consumers had a lower risk of CVD mortality compared with infrequent
consumers, and we observed that this association was more pronounced among partici-
pants with higher SEP throughout their life course. Frequent binge drinking was associated
with a higher risk of CVD mortality, but it was more uncertain whether the risk differed by life
course SEP. It is unclear if these findings reflect differential confounding of alcohol con-
sumption with health-protective or damaging exposures, or differing effects of alcohol on
health across socioeconomic groups.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Individuals with low socioeconomic position tend to consume alcohol less frequently
than individuals with middle or high socioeconomic position but experience more alco-
hol-related hospitalisations and deaths.
• The study was performed to assess whether the relation between drinking patterns and
cardiovascular disease differs by socioeconomic position.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We obtained information on socioeconomic factors throughout the life course of Nor-
wegian adults and categorised them into low, middle, or high position.
• We found that moderately frequent alcohol consumers had a lower risk of dying from
cardiovascular disease than infrequent consumers, and that this was more pronounced
among those with high position. Very frequent consumption was associated with
increased risk of CVD mortality, but only among those with low socioeconomic position.
• We also found that weekly binge drinkers had higher risk of dying from cardiovascular
disease than current drinkers who did not binge drink the past year, but we could not
elucidate whether the risk differed by life course socioeconomic position.
What do these findings mean?
• The study observed socioeconomic differences in risk estimates of CVD mortality asso-
ciated with given alcohol consumption levels. It is unclear if this reflects differential

Introduction
Socioeconomic position (SEP) is relevant to behaviours, exposures, and susceptibilities that
may influence health [1], such as social support, financial resources, or the knowledge, aware-
ness, and determination required to actively follow a healthy lifestyle or consult a physician if
needed. There is an inverse socioeconomic gradient in the exposure to risk factors for cardio-
vascular diseases (CVDs) [2], which translates into a gradient in the risk of clinical CVD events
[3,4]. The majority of heart attacks and strokes occur in late adulthood, but atherosclerosis
development starts in childhood [5]. Socioeconomic disadvantage at different stages through-
out the life course could therefore be relevant to risk factor exposure, atherosclerosis develop-
ment, and the long-term risk of clinical cardiovascular events [6–10].
In contrast to tobacco smoking, which is more frequent among socioeconomically disad-
vantaged individuals and has a clear detrimental effect on health, the relationship between
SEP, alcohol, and health is less clear. Disadvantaged groups tend to report less frequent alcohol
consumption but experience more harm from a given level of alcohol exposure [11–14]. This
is sometimes referred to as the alcohol harm paradox [15]. In terms of CVDs, associations
between alcohol drinking patterns and CVD risk further complicate the situation. A drinking
pattern characterised by more frequent consumption of low to moderate volumes is associated
with a reduced risk in comparison to infrequent drinking or abstainers, while episodic heavy
drinking, also called binge drinking, is associated with an increased risk [16]. Alcohol has mul-
tiple biological effects on the cardiovascular system, both harmful and potentially protective
[17–20], and it has been suggested that differing dose-response relationships of these mecha-
nisms may explain the overall J-shaped risk curve.
Biological effects of alcohol should not differ by SEP, but the noncausal associations could
do so if the lifestyles that accompany a drinking pattern differ according to SEP [21]. When
consuming alcohol, for example, disadvantaged individuals may more frequently co-consume
junk food or smoke cigarettes, while advantaged individuals may be more prone to combine
drinking with advantageous health-related behaviours and characteristics [21]. These potential
differences may be profound and captured by the measurement of important risk factors but
may also be subtle and difficult to measure individually. The assessment of SEP throughout the
life course could be an approach that encapsulates the effect of these potentially subtle differ-
ences over time. In this study, we investigated whether the diverging relationships between
alcohol drinking patterns and CVD mortality differed by life course SEP.
Methods
Study population
The Counties Studies [22], the Cohort of Norway [23], and the Age 40 Program [24] are three
partly overlapping cohorts containing data from Norwegian population-based health surveys
(1974–2003). Participants were recruited to the surveys through their personal identification

 number (PIN), which is unique to each inhabitant of Norway. The surveys assessed CVD risk
factors, and a subset (1987–2003, n = 330,745) assessed the frequency of alcohol consumption.
A further subsample also assessed the frequency of binge drinking episodes. The number of
participants and age distribution in the surveys are provided (S1 Table).
Data linkage
We linked data from the cohorts and national registries (the National Registry, the National
Educational Database, and the Cause of Death Registry) by the use of PINs and a trusted third
party (Statistics Norway). Data were sent from each source to the third party, which substi-
tuted the PIN with dummy numbers and sent the de-identified data to the authors. The
authors then used the dummy numbers to link the data.
Ethical approval and study protocol
This study is part of a larger research project. The data linkage and the research project was
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee South-East (11/1676). The Ethics Committee also
gave exemption regarding consent in older surveys in which consent was not obtained. The
project protocol (S1 Protocol) as well as a description of differences from the protocol and the
study performed (S1 Text) is included. This study is reported as per RECORD guidelines (S1
Checklist).
Participants
Participants were eligible for the study if they were born before October 15, 1960, to 2 Norwe-
gian parents, did not emigrate or die until after September 20, 1990, and if they completed the
mandatory censuses in Norway from 1960 through 1990. These criteria were used to provide a
sample that could be analysed with respect to life course SEP. Because of cohort overlap and
individuals taking part in more than one survey, some participants were represented by multi-
ple observations in the linked data. To optimise sample size, we selected 1 observation per par-
ticipant, conditional on whether the observation had data on alcohol consumption frequency
and placing priority on cohorts with longer follow-up. Eligible participants who had missing
values on alcohol consumption frequency, CVD risk factors or indicators of SEP, or inconsis-
tent follow-up data were excluded. The resulting sample was included in statistical analyses
using the exposure variable alcohol consumption frequency. A subgroup of this sample was
included in analyses of binge drinking episodes, which were available from some surveys.
Alcohol exposure
The assessment of alcohol exposure differed between the source surveys, and we harmonised
the data for use in the current study (S2 Table and S3 Table). Data identifying current and life-
time abstainers were harmonised into current abstainers for the main statistical analyses.
Among current drinkers, alcohol consumption frequency was categorised into ‘Infrequent’,
‘Once per month to once per week’, ‘2–3 times per week’, and ‘4–7 times per week’. In surveys
in which beer, wine, and liquor consumption were assessed separately, we first recoded the
reported ordinal frequency categories into days of alcohol consumption per month, then
summed the days to reflect total alcohol consumption, and finally recoded the sum back into
the ordinal categories for harmonisation. This approach assumes that each beverage type was
consumed on different days of the month. Participants reporting to be an abstainer on one
question and reporting drinking on another question were defined as drinkers.

 We defined a standard unit as 12.8 grams of pure alcohol, corresponding to a small bottle
of beer (33.3 cl, 4.5%, 11.8 g), a glass of wine (15 cl, 12%, 14g), or a small glass or shot of liquor
(4 cl, 40%, 12.6g). The frequency of heavy drinking episodes (5+ units or 60+ g of pure alcohol
on a single occasion), which reflects the intake of high volumes, was categorised into ‘Not last
year’, ‘A few times’, ‘1–3 times per month’, and ‘�1 time per week’. The average amount of
alcohol (g/day) could be assessed and harmonised for a subsample. Three calculations were
applied, depending on which questions were available in each survey. Two calculations com-
bined the average number of units consumed per occasion (0–20; higher values were truncated
to 20) with the drinking frequency reported either per month (0–30) or in ordinal categories
(4–7/week = 286/year, 2–3/week = 130/year, once/week = 52/year, 2–3/month = 30/year,
once/month = 12/year, infrequent = 6/year). The third calculation was based on the total num-
ber of units consumed of beer, wine, and liquor in the course of 2 weeks.
Life course SEP
CVDs tend to develop throughout the life course and manifest clinically in late adulthood. The
manner in which risk factors and protective factors influence disease development may not be
in unison; for example, there could be critical or sensitive time periods. A life course approach
to epidemiology is one that takes this notion of time into account by acknowledging that mea-
suring risk factors only once could be inadequate in order to assess the full impact they may
have through the life course [25,26]. Previous studies have observed that CVD mortality is
related to the number of occasions individuals have been exposed to socioeconomic disadvan-
tage, measured by adding multiple indicators from different periods in the life course together
in a cumulative manner [6,27].
We obtained a cumulative measure of life course SEP by combining indicators on house-
hold conditions from mandatory population and household censuses in 1960, 1970, and 1980
(type of dwelling, apartment block, row or detached house, ownership status, rooms per
household capita, telephone ownership, access to water closet, and bath inside the dwelling),
household income from the census in 1990, and the highest level of obtained education ever
recorded until 2011 (National Educational Database). In contrast to the 1960 and 1970 cen-
suses, which obtained almost complete population and household data, the census in 1980 did
not pursue missing household data to the same extent. The household indicators have previ-
ously been observed to be independently associated with cause-specific mortality, as well as
when combined into cumulative indexes [27,28]. A more detailed description of the role of the
use of household indicators may be found here [1,25]. The household conditions, household
income, and education provided a total of 20 indicators, which were scored (0 or 1) and given
equal weight by summing the scores to construct the cumulative index (range 0–20). A high
score indicated disadvantage and low life course SEP.
Covariates and outcome
The health surveys provided self-reported data on current smoking, physical activity, diabetes,
previous CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or angina pectoris), family history of coronary
heart disease (CHD), objective measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, anthropome-
try, and biochemical nonfasting measurements (mmol/l) of serum triglycerides, total choles-
terol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The Norwegian Cause of Death
Registry provided outcome data on causes of death using the ninth and tenth revision of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The primary outcome was CVD mortality
(1990–1995: ICD-9 390–459; 1996–2014: ICD-10: I00–I99). Three secondary outcomes were
added in response to peer review, including death from ischemic heart disease (IHD) (1990–

 1995: ICD-9 410–414; 1996–2014: ICD–10: I20–I25), death from cerebrovascular diseases
(1990–1995: ICD-9 430–438; 1996–2014: ICD-10: I60–I69), and all-cause mortality. The regis-
try is almost exclusively based on certificates filled out by on-site medical doctors, and in the
few cases in which autopsies are performed, 32% of deaths are reclassified over major ICD-10
chapters [29].
Statistical analysis
We described the study population according to categories of life course SEP (index score
0–5 = high; 6–9 = middle; �10 = low) as well as according to alcohol consumption frequency
within categories of SEP. Continuous variables were presented as mean (SD) and categorical
variables as counts (%). Analysis of variance and chi-squared tests assessed differences between
the groups. In survival analyses, we followed participants prospectively until emigration
(December 31, 2012), death from any cause, or December 31, 2014. Cox Proportional Hazard
Models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Visual inspection of
scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time did not indicate strong deviation from the assumption
of proportional hazard. All analyses were conducted in R statistical software using R studio
1.0.44 [30], with additional use of the packages survival [31] and mice [32]. We did not impose
a p-value cutoff to define statistical significance [33] nor apply survey weights.
To evaluate whether the SEP index was relevant to the outcome, we estimated the risk of
CVD mortality in a model with the SEP index, age, and gender. Potential mediators, such as
smoking, were not included, in order to assess the total effect. The index was first modelled
using a smoothed penalised spline, allowing for a visual presentation of the functional re-
lationship with the outcome, and then as a continuous and categorical variable for a formal
assessment.
The aim was to assess if the relation between alcohol drinking patterns and the risk of CVD
mortality differed by life course SEP. The hypothesis we tested statistically was whether SEP
modified the effect of alcohol drinking patterns on the risk of CVD. We present HRs with 95%
CI for alcohol consumption frequency and for the frequency of binge drinking episodes over-
all, in strata of SEP, and measures of effect modification on a multiplicative scale as HRs with
95% CI and p-values. Both exposures were modelled as ordinal categorical variables, with
infrequent consumers and those who did not binge drink the last year as reference categories,
respectively. Current abstainers were modelled separately as a dichotomous variable, with
infrequent consumers as the reference category. Confounders of the relation between alcohol
and CVD that were adjusted for included age, gender, current smoking, physical activity, body
mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides, diabetes, history of CVD,
and family history of CHD. In the subgroup with data on binge drinking, we adjusted the risk
of CVD mortality according to alcohol consumption frequency for episodes of heavy drinking,
and vice versa. Analyses were performed separately for total CVD, IHD, stroke, and all-cause
mortality. Missing values were handled by list-wise deletion and totalled to 18.4%. We also
performed missing value imputations of CVD risk factors and census data by chained equa-
tions among 245,336 eligible individuals with data on alcohol consumption (n = 38,284 with
data on binge drinking). This reduced the amount of missing values to 3.5%. Alcohol exposure
variables, CVD risk factors, census data, outcome data, and the SEP index were included in the
imputation model and 10 data sets were generated. We then reanalysed the relationships with
total CVD in each data set and report pooled HRs with 95% CIs.
We performed 2 sensitivity analyses in response to peer review. In the subgroup with data
on binge drinking, we reanalysed the relation between alcohol consumption frequency and the
risk of CVD while excluding binge drinkers (‘�1 time per month’). In the subgroup with data

 on lifetime abstaining, we compared the risk of CVD when using lifetime abstainers and infre-
quent consumers as reference categories.
We added analyses while performing planned statistical analyses, which were elaborated
during peer review. Short-term experimental studies show a dose-response relationship
between alcohol intake and levels of HDL-C [17]. Using ordinary least squares regression and
models adjusted for age and sex, we regressed HDL-C on a continuous variable of drinking
frequency (4 categories of current drinkers). In a subsample, we also regressed HDL-C on a
continuous variable of the average amount of alcohol consumed per day (g/day). Changes in
HDL-C were compared to the dose-response relationship in a meta-analysis of experimental
studies [17] to indicate if the main study variable was consistent with an increase in total alco-
hol consumption as judged by HDL-C and to indicate if the self-reported data were underre-
ported. We also reanalysed the relationship between HDL-C and drinking frequency in strata
of SEP to indicate if SEP could influence the ability to report consistently [34]. A formal test
for a difference in slope was performed by including an interaction term between drinking fre-
quency and SEP.
Results
Participants
From 330,700 potentially eligible observations, we selected (Fig 1) 1 observation per participant
(n = 317,171). Participants with an immigration history (n = 24,198), who were born after Octo-
ber 15, 1960 (n = 30,176), or died before September 20,1990 (n = 250), or who did not attend
one or more of the censuses (n = 8,370) were considered not eligible. We further excluded 18.4%
of the 254,177 eligible participants for inconsistent data at follow-up (n = 3) or for missing values
on alcohol consumption frequency (n = 8,841), CVD risk factors (n = 11,940), household data
from the censuses (n = 25,656), and for education (n = 343). The final sample (n = 207,394) was
included in complete case analyses using alcohol consumption frequency, of which 188,603 were
current drinkers and 18,791 current abstainers. From this sample we also selected subgroups
with data available on binge drinking episodes (n = 32,616) and data on lifetime abstaining
(n = 30,455).
Individuals with missing values on household conditions were not different from those eli-
gible and not different from individuals in the final sample. Individuals with missing alcohol
data, and especially those with missing CVD risk factors, were older, more often female, had
lower education, and experienced more CVD deaths during follow-up (S1 Table).
Descriptive analyses
Baseline characteristics differed according to life course SEP for all included variables
(Table 1). Participants with low SEP (n = 29,998) were on average older, more often female,
had a higher prevalence of CVD risk factors, more previous diseases, and were more
often a current abstainer or an infrequent consumer of alcohol. Participants with high SEP
(n = 64,412) had the lowest prevalence of CVD risk factors, were more often frequent consum-
ers of alcohol, and were more likely to binge drink within the subgroup for which these data
were available. Estimates for middle SEP participants (n = 112,984) were mostly between the
other strata.
The distribution of covariates over categories of alcohol consumption frequency followed
comparable patterns within the strata of life course SEP, but with different magnitudes (S4
Table). Notably, frequent consumers of alcohol were consistently more often also frequent
bingers, but the percentage among the most frequent consumers who were also weekly bingers
was 32.8% in the low, 19.1% in the middle, and 16.9% in the high SEP strata.

 Follow-up time and mortality
The mean (SD) follow-up time in the study population was 16.6 (4.0) years. In total, 25,950
participants died—8,435 (4.1%) from CVDs, including 3,837 from IHD and 1,972 from stroke.
In the subgroup of current drinkers with additional data on heavy drinking episodes, 7,274
died during 15.4 (6.2) years of follow-up, 2,284 (7.0%) from CVDs, including 1,028 from IHD
and 553 from stroke. In the subgroup with additional data on lifetime abstaining, the number
of CVD deaths in the course of 12.5 (3.0) years was 2,166 (7.1%).

 (range 0–20) was 1.06 (1.05, 1.07). In comparison to individuals with high SEP, HRs for risk of
CVD mortality were 1.16 (1.11, 1.22) and 1.50 (1.41 1.59) among individuals with middle and
low SEP, respectively.
Alcohol consumption frequency, life course SEP, and mortality
The risk of CVD mortality was lower among frequent drinkers than among infrequent consum-
ers in imputed (Table 2) and complete case analyses (S5 Table), with even lower estimates and
stronger associations when excluding or adjusting for binge drinking (S6 Table). There was no
difference in risk between infrequent consumers and lifetime abstainers when they were used as
reference categories in a subgroup (S7 Table). Compared with infrequent drinkers, HRs among
moderately frequent drinkers (2–3/week) were 0.78 (95% CI 0.72, 0.84) for CVD mortality
(Table 2), 0.70 (95% CI 0.61, 0.79) for IHD mortality (S8 Table), 0.77 (95% CI 0.64, 0.93) for
stroke mortality (S9 Table), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.87, 0.95) for all-cause mortality (S10 Table).
Stratified analyses and tests for effect modification indicated differences in risk by life course
SEP, in which HRs for CVD mortality, IHD mortality, and all-cause mortality were even lower
among moderately frequent drinkers with high SEP than among moderately frequent drinkers
with middle and low SEP. In the high, middle, and low strata of SEP respectively, HRs were 0.66

all-cause mortality. The analyses also indicated differences in risk by SEP for very frequent
consumption (4–7/week). While HRs for very frequent consumption compared to infrequent
consumption in the high and middle strata of SEP were 0.75 (95% CI 0.63, 0.90) and 0.77 (95%
CI 0.64, 0.92) for CVD mortality, 1.08 (95% CI 0.76, 1.52) and 1.03 (95% CI 0.71, 1.48) for
stroke mortality, and 0.93 (95% CI 0.84, 1.04) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.86, 1.06) for all-cause mortal-
ity, HRs for this level of drinking among participants with low SEP were 1.42 (95% CI 1.06,
1.90) for CVD mortality, 1.70 (95% CI 0.82, 3.51) for stroke mortality, and 1.49 (95% CI 1.24,
1.80) for all-cause mortality, respectively. HRs for IHD mortality in the high, middle, and low
strata were 0.56 (95% CI 0.41, 0.77), 0.61 (95% CI 0.45, 0.84), and 0.87 (95% CI 0.50, 1.53),

 Binge drinking, life course SEP, and mortality
Binge drinking (�1 time/week) was associated with a higher risk of CVD mortality in imputed
(Table 3) and complete case analysis (S11 Table) as well as a higher risk of IHD (S12 Table),
and all-cause mortality (S14 Table) compared with no binge drinking the last year. HRs were
1.58 (95% CI 1.31, 1.91) for CVD mortality, 1.62 (95% CI 1.20, 2.17) for IHD mortality, 1.39
(95% CI 0.88, 2.20) for stroke mortality (S13 Table), and 1.36 (95% CI 1.20, 1.53) for all-cause
mortality. HRs for less frequent binge drinking (1–3 times/month) were 1.12 (95% CI 0.98,
1.28) for CVD mortality, 1.09 (95% CI 0.88, 1.34) for IHD mortality, 1.15 (95% CI 0.86, 1.53)
for stroke mortality, and 1.08 (95% CI 1.00, 1.17) for all-cause mortality, compared to no binge
drinking the last year. Stratified analyses and tests for effect modification did not indicate large
differences in risk by life course SEP. Estimates tended to be more robust and consistent in the
larger middle stratum of SEP and less consistent in the low and high SEP strata.

 Additional analyses
The crude distributions of HDL-C according to categories of alcohol consumption frequency
and life course SEP are presented (S4 Table). When adjusted for age and sex, the increase in
HDL-C per increase in drinking frequency (4 frequency categories) was 0.093 (0.090, 0.095)
mmol/l and corresponded to an estimated mean increase of approximately 26.6 g ethanol/day
when we compared it to the estimated dose-response relationship between alcohol and
HDL-C in a meta-analysis of experimental studies [17]. The increases in the high, middle, and
low strata of SEP were 0.095 (0.090, 0.099), 0.090 (0.086, 0.093), and 0.086 (0.079, 0.093)
mmol/l, respectively (P-interaction term = 0.715). In a subsample, the change in HDL-C per
increase in the amount of alcohol consumed per day (grams/day) was 0.009 (0.009, 0.010)
mmol/l. This corresponded to a 0.113 mmol/l increase per unit of alcohol, which is in the
upper range when compared to experimental studies in which 1–2 drinks/day corresponded
to an estimated increase in HDL-C of 0.072 mmol/l (0.024, 0.119) [17].
Discussion
Principal findings
Among adult participants in Norwegian health surveys (1987–2003), alcohol consumption
and episodic heavy drinking were more frequent among individuals with high SEP throughout
their life course. Participants with low SEP were more likely to currently abstain or drink less
frequently, but apart from that, they were more exposed to all other CVD risk factors. Moder-
ately frequent drinking was associated with a lower risk of CVD, IHD, and all-cause mortality
than infrequent drinking, and we observed that this association was more pronounced among
participants with high SEP. Very frequent drinking was associated with a higher risk of CVD
and all-cause mortality compared with infrequent drinking, but only among participants with
low SEP. Frequent binge drinking among current drinkers was associated with a higher risk of
CVD, IHD, and all-cause mortality compared with no binge drinking during the last year, but
it was not possible to determine whether the risk differed by life course SEP. Because of few
events, it was also difficult to make firm inferences regarding stroke mortality.
Interpretation of findings
The higher prevalence of current abstainers and infrequent consumers among those with low
life course SEP is consistent with studies in other countries [35]. Alcohol taxes are particularly
high in Norway, and differences in financial resources to purchase alcoholic beverages could
contribute to this difference [36]. Interestingly, episodes of heavy drinking were somewhat
more common among individuals with high SEP, illustrating the widespread acceptance of this
behaviour in Norwegian society, even in the most health-conscious segment of the population.
Another interesting observation was that individuals with low SEP were overrepresented in the
most heavy drinking category (32.8%) when the frequencies of alcohol consumption and binge
drinking were combined, a tendency that has also been observed previously in Europe [15]. The
comparability to other populations in this regard strengthens external validity.
We observed lower risk of CVD, IHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality among moderately
frequent drinkers in the study population compared with infrequent drinkers, which is in
agreement with the majority of similar studies [16,37]. However, evidence from Mendelian
randomisation studies thus far do not support a protective effect of alcohol on CVD nor pro-
vide support for a causal effect of factors that were considered to mediate a protective effect of
alcohol—in particular, HDL-C and fibrinogen—on CVD [19,38–42]. It is therefore important
to consider whether our findings may have been influenced by unmeasured confounders or

 misclassification of previous heavy drinkers [43]. In our study, we addressed the issue of
reverse causality by choosing infrequent consumers over current abstainers as a reference cate-
gory. We considered that small differences in alcohol consumption could not account for the
difference in risk observed between these groups, unless moderate drinkers were misclassified
as infrequent consumers because of underreporting [34,44]. Although we did not have data on
lifetime abstainers for all participants, their risk of CVD did not differ from that of infrequent
consumers in a subgroup analysis. We addressed the issue of confounding by adjusting for the
uneven distribution of measured confounders, which did not strongly influence the associa-
tions. However, as measured confounders and thus, likely also unmeasured confounders, were
distributed unevenly over categories of alcohol consumption within each stratum, there could
clearly be residual confounding in the within-strata analyses as well. It is therefore unclear
whether the findings reflect differential confounding of alcohol consumption with other expo-
sures or differing effects of alcohol on health across socioeconomic groups.
The stratified analyses and tests for effect modification suggested that the relationship
between alcohol consumption frequency and the risk of CVD mortality differed by life course
SEP. The association between moderately frequent consumption and lower risk of CVD
was more pronounced for participants with high SEP than among participants with low and
middle SEP. Very frequent drinkers in the middle and high strata of SEP had either lower or
comparable risk of CVD, IHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality in comparison to infrequent
consumers, while very frequent drinkers with low SEP had a higher risk of CVD and all-cause
mortality. Alcohol is subjected to first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal system, and
when alcohol is co-ingested with foods, metabolism by enzymes in the stomach is extended
[45]. This reduces bioavailability of ingested alcohol overall and also delays and reduces peak
blood alcohol concentration, which may attenuate the systemic toxic effects of alcohol [46]. If
drinking were more often accompanied by meals in one stratum of SEP, such as those with
high SEP, it could account for a lower risk among binge drinkers compared to those not binge
drinking, but not when considering alcohol as a protective factor. Another possibility, as indi-
cated previously, is that the differences in risk by life course SEP could have arisen or been
influenced by confounders having different effects in each stratum, such as if alcohol con-
sumption is accompanied by a different set of behaviours in each stratum.
We observed higher CVD, IHD, and all-cause mortality among current drinkers who were
frequent binge drinkers compared with current drinkers who did not binge drink during the last
year, possibly mediated by increased blood pressure [19,47], cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhyth-
mias, and disturbances in blood electrolyte status [48,49]. A previous meta-analysis found binge
drinking not to be associated with a higher risk of IHD in comparison to lifetime abstainers [50],
and in that sense this finding sticks out. Findings were strong and consistent in the large middle
stratum but less clear and less consistent in the smaller low and high SEP strata, which likely
resulted in some inaccurate effect estimates and reduced precision when testing for effect modi-
fication. In light of the sample size and number of events, and the heterogeneity in the most
extreme drinking categories, it is difficult to conclude with confidence that there is no socioeco-
nomic difference in the relationship between binge drinking and CVD among adult Norwegians.
Methodological considerations
Multiple measurements of alcohol exposure over time is the best approach to account for vari-
ation in consumption [51], but this study was limited to a single self-reported measurement.
Previous studies found a test–retest correlation for men and women of approximately 0.6
when using data on repeated measurements from the source population [52,53]. Furthermore,
52% of the men and 62% of the women reported consistently in a follow-up postal survey 10

 years later, of which abstainers were the most consistent (68% and 75%, respectively). Abstain-
ers and heavy drinkers, however, appeared to be more prone to dropout than infrequent and
light consumers. The large sample size also accounts for random variation.
We used HDL-C as a biomarker of a change in the magnitude of total alcohol consumption,
and after adjusting for differences in age and sex, we observed an increase in HDL-C of about
0.093 mmol/l for each categorical increase in alcohol consumption frequency. This value cor-
responds to an estimated mean increase of approximately 26.6 g ethanol/day if we compare it
to the estimated dose-response relationship between alcohol and HDL-C from a meta-analysis
of clinical trials [17] and substantiated that increasing consumption frequency accompanied
increased amount of ethanol consumed. The increase in amount of HDL-C was comparable
within all strata of SEP; thus, it seems unlikely that differential exposure misclassification can
explain the differing relationships between alcohol consumption and CVD mortality in the dif-
ferent strata of life course SEP. The dose-response relationship of cardiovascular mortality
with alcohol consumption seemed to nadir at a frequency of 2–3 times per week, or 40 g etha-
nol/day higher intake on average than infrequent consumers, which is comparable to overall
estimates from previous studies when men and women are combined [37]. The increase in
HDL-C per increase in the amount of alcohol consumed was higher in the current study than
in short-term experimental studies. Although the dose-response relationship between alcohol
intake and HDL-C might differ for short-term and long-term intakes, the comparison suggests
that alcohol consumption may be underreported to some extent in the health surveys.
Without information on previous alcohol intake or the cause of alcohol abstaining, we were
unable to identify and exclude previous heavy drinkers. Only a few surveys distinguished
between lifetime and current abstainers, which we combined with current abstainers in order
to harmonise the data. As a result, findings involving abstainers have low generalisability. This
also precluded the combination of infrequent drinkers and lifetime abstainers into a single
comparison group, which has been suggested as the best alternative [51]. However, the sensi-
tivity analysis comparing the use of lifetime abstainers and infrequent consumers did not indi-
cate differences between these groups, which we consider a strength of our chosen reference
category. Combined information on consumption frequency and volume were available for
the subgroup with additional data on current episodes of heavy drinking. Apart from the over-
representation of individuals with low SEP at the more extreme end of intake levels, there was
a consistent increase in episodes of heavy drinking with increasing alcohol consumption fre-
quency in all strata of life course SEP, suggesting that the main exposure variable, alcohol con-
sumption frequency, differentiated individuals according to average alcohol intake.
To reflect life course SEP, we used an index constructed from multiple indicators that, with
the exception of education, we derived from census surveys performed decennially between
1960 and 1990. In order for all participants to have the possibility to obtain a full score, we
imposed selection criteria regarding immigration, birth date, time of death, and census partici-
pation. This resulted in a clearly defined and homogenous sample, but at the expense of sample
size.
Previous studies have assessed the relationship between SEP and the risk of alcohol-related
outcomes [54], and to various degrees, the mediating role of alcohol consumption [55]. Our
study appears novel in the sense that it assesses the relationship between alcohol consumption
and CVD mortality within strata of life course SEP, which appears to be very sparse or nonex-
istent in the current literature, regardless of how SEP is measured [55]. A possible reason
could be the extensive sample size required to test for differences (effect modification) between
groups and the registry linkages required to measure life course SEP, which highlights the
major strengths of this study. For this reason and because of variation in alcohol consumption
patterns, alcohol taxes, and socioeconomic inequalities between countries, it may be difficult

 to repeat the study in detail. The overall findings, however, should be available for replication
in another population using similar study design, albeit with variation in the measurement of
SEP or alcohol consumption.
Conclusions
In this observational study of Norwegian adults, we observed lower CVD risk among frequent
consumers of alcohol compared with infrequent consumers and higher CVD risk among cur-
rent drinkers who reported frequent episodes of binge drinking in comparison to current
drinkers who did not binge drink during the past year. The lower risk of CVD mortality asso-
ciated with frequent consumption appeared to be more profound among those with high SEP
throughout their life course than among those with middle and low SEP. We also observed
higher CVD risk among very frequent consumers compared with infrequent consumers, but
only among participants with low SEP. It was more uncertain whether the association between
binge drinking and CVD mortality differed by life course SEP.
