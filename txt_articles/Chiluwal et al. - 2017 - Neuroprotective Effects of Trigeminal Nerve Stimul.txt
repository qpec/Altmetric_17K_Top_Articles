Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemia and hypoxia play a major role in further worsening of 
the damage, a process referred to as ‘secondary injury’. Protecting neurons from causative factors of 
secondary injury has been the guiding principle of modern TBI management. Stimulation of trigeminal 
nerve induces pressor response and improves cerebral blood flow (CBF) by activating the rostral 
ventrolateral medulla. Moreover, it causes cerebrovasodilation through the trigemino-cerebrovascular 
system and trigemino-parasympathetic reflex. These effects are capable of increasing cerebral 
perfusion, making trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) a promising strategy for TBI management. Here, 
we investigated the use of electrical TNS for improving CBF and brain oxygen tension (PbrO2), with the 
goal of decreasing secondary injury. Severe TBI was produced using controlled cortical impact (CCI) in a 
rat model, and TNS treatment was delivered for the first hour after CCI. In comparison to TBI group, TBI 
animals with TNS treatment demonstrated significantly increased systemic blood pressure, CBF and 
PbrO2 at the hyperacute phase of TBI. Furthermore, rats in TNS-treatment group showed significantly 
reduced brain edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, lesion volume, and brain cortical levels of TNF-α
 and 
IL-6. These data provide strong early evidence that TNS could be an effective neuroprotective strategy.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and has a significant socio-
economic impact1, 2. In particular, TBI represents a third of all injury related deaths, and is associated with signif-
icant disability among survivors. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and 
management of this serious condition, to date, there are no drugs that have shown to improve patient outcomes 
significantly. Therefore, there is a clear need for developing novel therapeutic strategies to maximize recovery 
after TBI.
TBI is classified as either primary or secondary1, 3–6. The immediate mechanical destruction of the tissue and 
blood vessels that happens at the time of impact is the primary injury, and the damage is irreversible. Secondary 
injury develops in a gradual fashion in response to the mechanical damage, and is prompted by a multitude of 
factors, with ischemia playing a central role4, 6, 7. In the critical early hours after trauma, the perilesional area 
becomes hypermetabolic, but at the same time there is a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF)8–13. This mismatch 
of supply and demand leads to an energy crisis at the cellular level, resulting in additional death of neural tissue in 
the ischemic penumbra. This process of secondary brain injury leads to further decline in neurological function 
and poor outcome. Therefore, early augmentation of blood flow to the brain, especially in the perilesional area is 
essential in preventing secondary insult14. In fact, the prevention of secondary brain injury has been the major 
focus of neurotrauma research and clinical practice; however treatment options have been limited to blood pres-
sure and intracranial pressure management.
Neuromodulation is a therapeutic technique that involves modification of neural function via external stim-
ulation, usually in the form of electrical impulses. Prominent examples of neuromodulative therapies are vagus 
nerve stimulation for epilepsy and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease15, 16. Trigeminal nerve stimula-
tion (TNS) has also been an active area of research in a variety of disease processes, and has shown efficacy in the

treatment of epilepsy and depression17, 18. Its role in other pathological conditions such as posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), trigeminal neuralgia, and migraine headaches is ongoing19–21.
The trigeminal nerve (Cranial Nerve V) is the largest cranial nerve, offering a high-bandwidth pathway for 
signals to enter the brain bilaterally and at high frequency. It projects directly or indirectly to several areas of 
the brain, such as the locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitaries (NTS), rostral ventrolateral medullar (RVLM), 
thalamus and the cerebral cortex21, 22. There are two important properties of the trigeminal nerve that make it a 
potentially viable target in TBI management. Stimulation of the trigeminal nerve causes a vasopressor response 
by activating the RVLM, an important brainstem vasomotor center23, 24. Furthermore, TNS has been shown to 
decrease cerebrovascular resistance via the trigemino-cerebrovascular system25. When activated, these pathways, 
via RVLM and trigemino-cerebrovascular system, can lead to significant increase in cerebral perfusion, hence 
making the trigeminal nerve a promising target in TBI management (Fig. 1). However, to date TNS has not been 
investigated for the treatment and prevention of secondary brain injury after TBI.
In this study, we hypothesized that TNS can decrease secondary damage after severe TBI by increasing CBF 
and delivering more oxygen to the injured brain. Using a rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, we demon-
strated that intermittent electrical TNS delivered immediately after CCI for 60 minutes (1-minute stimulation for 
every 11 minutes interval) significantly improved CBF and brain tissue oxygen levels. Moreover, we showed that 
TNS was capable of decreasing brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, lesion volume, and inflamma-
tory response as evaluated by the levels of TNF-α
 and IL-6 in brain tissue.

We examined the effects of direct trigeminal 
nerve branch stimulation (the right and left anterior ethmoidal nerves as shown in Fig. 2) on mean arterial blood 
pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate (HR), and respiration rate (RR) in naïve rats. One direct TNS were

delivered to each rat after 30-min baseline recording. One of the representative recordings is shown in Fig. 3A. 
During the 1-minute direct TNS, MAP significantly increased by 9.2% compared to the baseline (129.5 ± 9.1 vs. 
118.6 ± 10.7 mmHg; p < 0.001; n = 12) (Fig. 3B). PP and HR increased from 52 ± 9 to 57 ± 9 mmHg (p < 0.001 
n = 12), and 340 ± 26 to 351 ± 26 bpm (p < 0.05 n = 12), respectively (Fig. 3C and D). RR decreased by 52% com-
pared to the baseline (27 ± 3 vs. 56 ± 5 bpm; p < 0.001; n = 12) concurrently (Fig. 3E). All the values returned to 
their baseline within 10 minutes.
Effects of Subcutaneous TNS on Hemodynamics in Naive Rats. 
In order to minimize the inva-
sive procedures of direct TNS, we stimulated the terminal branches of trigeminal nerve via minimally-invasive 
subcutaneous electrodes in the distribution of V1 (ophthalmic branch). Stimulation parameters were tuned so 
that subcutaneous TNS results in similar hemodynamic changes as direct TNS. One subcutaneous TNS were 
delivered to each rat after 30-min baseline recording. Figure 4A shows one of representative recordings. During 
the 1-minute direct TNS, MAP increased by 8.1% compared to the baseline (130.6 ± 6.7 vs. 120.8 ± 7.5 mmHg; 
p < 0.001; p = 12), and gradually returned back to baseline within 10 minutes (Fig. 4B). PP and HR increased 
from 56 ± 12 to 62 ± 11 mmHg (p < 0.001 n = 12), and 346 ± 34 to 357 ± 32 bpm (p < 0.001 n = 12), respectively 
(Fig. 4C and D). RR significantly decreased by 46.9% compared to the baseline (29 ± 4 vs. 55 ± 5 bpm; p < 0.001; 
n = 12) (Fig. 4E).
Effects of Subcutaneous TNS on Cerebral Parameters in Naïve Rats. 
1-minute application of sub-
cutaneous TNS triggered significant changes in cerebral parameters. Representative recordings of CBF, PbrO2, 
brain temperature and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) are shown in Fig. 5A. CBF increased from 48.7 ± 5.6 to 
82.9 ± 5.6 ml/100 g/min (p =< 0.001; n = 8), a 70.4% increase compared to the baseline which slowly decreased 
to baseline in 10 minutes (Fig. 5B). There was a lag of approximately 51 ± 33 sec until PbrO2 started to increase 
by 5% over its baseline. From the baseline value of 20.9 ± 3.5 mmHg, it increased to 26.7 ± 3.1 mmHg (p < 0.001; 
n = 8), a 27.4% increase, and again gradually decreased to baseline in 10 minutes (Fig. 5C). TNS caused a 0.4% 
increase in cerebral temperature from 36.08 ± 0.42 °C to 36.23 ± 0.43 °C (p < 0.001; n = 8). There was a lag of 
approximately 26 ± 16 sec until the temperature started to increase by 5% over its baseline and after stimulation

it kept increased for 15 ± 9 sec until it reached its maximum (Fig. 5D). CVR was calculated as a ratio between 
MAP and CBF and expressed as percentage of change relative to the baseline. In parallel with CBF increase, CVR 
decreased to a minimum of 32.8% (p =< 0.001; n = 6) gradually returning to the baseline in 10 minutes (Fig. 5E).
Effects of CCI on Hemodynamics and Cerebral Parameters. 
Representative changes in hemody-
namics and cerebral parameters after CCI-induced severe TBI are shown in Fig. 6A. At the onset of CCI, there 
was a rapid decrease in MAP, CBF, and PbrO2. MAP rapidly decreased to a minimum of 27.9% compared to 
the baseline (87.17 ± 10.83 vs. 120.83 ± 13.04; p =< 0.001; n = 6) in 1 minute and started to increase returning 
to the baseline approximately in 2 minutes. Within 15 minutes, MAP and temperature recovered to their base-
line (Fig. 6B). CBF and PbrO2 however remained decreased at 15, 30 and 60 minutes. Compared to its base-
line value of 49.4 ± 9.1 ml/100 g/min, CBF at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after CCI were 30.9 ± 5.5 (p < 0.05; n = 7), 
34.3 ± 6.3 (p < 0.05; n = 7), 35.1 ± 6.8 ml/100 g/min (p < 0.05; n = 7), 37.4%, 30.5%, 29% decline, respectively 
(Fig. 6C). With CBF decrease, PbrO2 continuously dropped by 14.3% compared to the baseline (19.17 ± 3.30 vs. 
22.37 ± 3.39 mmHg; p < 0.001; n = 7) at 15 minutes, followed by a less steep but prolonged further decrease by 
17.9% (18.35 ± 3.22 vs. 22.37 ± 3.39 mmHg; p < 0.001; n = 7) and 16.2% (18.74 ± 2.42 vs. 22.37 ± 3.39 mmHg; 
p < 0.001; n = 7) at 30 and 60 minutes respectively (Fig. 6D). Brain temperature depends on the bleeding status 
after CCI. If there was no bleeding after CCI, the cortical temperature increased by 0.007 ± 0.002% (p < 0.001; 
n = 6) approximately in 2 minutes. If there was bleeding, the cortical temperature first decreased, and then either 
slightly increased by 0.002% or kept decreasing (Fig. 6E).
Effects of Subcutaneous TNS on CCI-induced TBI. 
At 10 minutes after the CCI, 1-minute TNS in 
every 11 minutes was delivered for 60 minutes (total 5 TNS). Figure 7A shows a representative recording of 
the changes in CBF, PbrO2, brain temperature and MAP after CCI following by TNS. CBF, PbrO2 and MAP 
showed marked improvement. At 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the CCI, the mean CBF of the TNS-treated rats 
was 35.1 ± 3.1, 42.8 ± 4.2, and 51.7 ± 3.5 ml/100 g/min, 20.5% (p = 0.007; n = 6), 26.4% (p = 0.0205; n = 6) and 
51.3% (p =< 0.001; n = 6) increase compared to the TBI rats, respectively (Fig. 7B). The PbrO2 values at 15,

30, and 60 minutes for the TNS-treated rats were 20.8 ± 3.1, 22.9 ± 2.2, and 22.6 ± 2.2 mmHg, 7.7% (p = 0.23; 
n = 6), 24.4% (p = 0.012; n = 6), and 18.5% (p = 0.015; n = 6) increase compared to the TBI rats, respectively 
(Fig. 7C). There was no statistical difference in the brain temperature changes (=[(tx-min −
 t0-min)/t0-min] ×
100%) 
between the 2 groups at 15 and 30 minutes after the CCI (Fig. 7D). However, brain temperature changes 
showed significant increase in the TNS-treated group at 60 minutes compared to the TBI rats (−
0.051 ± 0.8% 
vs. 0.79 ± 0.43%; p = 0.0252; n = 6). MAP was also significantly higher in the TNS-treated group at 30 minutes 
(127.0 ± 6.0 vs. 118.3 ± 7.2 mmHg) and 60 minutes (129.7 ± 8.6 vs. 116.1 ± 10.2 mmHg) compared to the TBI rats 
(119.0 ± 12.9 mmHg), 7.4% (p = 0.015; n = 7) and 11.7% (p = 0.01; n = 7) increase, respectively (Fig. 7E).
Effects of Subcutaneous TNS on Brain Damage. 
CCI caused significant increase in brain edema, BBB 
disruption, and lesion volume at 24 hours post-injury. Animals that received CCI had significant increase in 
edema level compared to the sham-control groups (82.2 ± 1.0 vs. 77.5 ± 0.5%; p =< 0.001; n = 6). Mean edema 
level for TNS-treatment animals was 79.9 ± 0.8%, 6.1% decrease (p =< 0.001; n = 6) compared to TBI animals 
(Fig. 8A). CCI also significantly disrupted the BBB compared to sham groups (2.37 ± 0.60 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04 µg/g; 
p = 0.002; n = 6). Evans blue dye concentration in TNS-treatment group was 1.08 ± 0.28 µg/g, which is a 54.4% 
decrease (p =< 0.001; n = 6) compared to TBI-control animals (Fig. 8B). Mean lesion volume for TNS-treatment 
rats was 7.04 ± 0.75 mm3, 36.1% decrease (p < 0.001; n = 6) compared to the TBI rats (11.03 ± 1.29 mm3) 
(Fig. 8C).
Effects of Subcutaneous TNS on Inflammation. 
TBI initiates a cascade of inflammatory processes 
that can serve to exacerbate the initial injury. As shown in Fig. 9, brain cortical tissue levels of TNF-α
 and IL-6 
increased significantly by 225% and 197% at 4 h after TBI. TNS treatment decreased brain cortical levels of TNF-α

Discussion
Ischemia plays a central role in the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury in the early post TBI period. 
Therefore, in this study we investigated whether augmenting blood flow to the brain via TNS can attenuate injury 
progression. Previous studies have shown that brain tissue around the injured area are prone to ischemia, either 
due to compression from the adjacent traumatic mass lesions or due to hypermetabolic activities from the ini-
tiation of biochemical, physiological and electrical cascades26–28. After the primary insult, damaged neurons, 
astrocytes and microglia release reactive oxygen species, excitatory neurotransmitters and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines1. Initiation of inflammatory cascades lead to further breakdown of the blood brain barrier, causing 
edema and intracranial hypertension. These changes in the cerebral microenvironment in and around the dam-
aged tissue occur in a gradual fashion, starting from the time of the primary injury and continuing for days. There 
is also a reduction of blood flow to the pericontusional area after the initial insult by as much as 50% compared 
to normal levels8. This combination of hypermetabolism and reduction in CBF make the perilesional penum-
bra exquisitely vulnerable to ischemic damage. There is also evidence that ischemia itself induces production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and triggers inflammatory cascades29, 30. In our animal model, we were able to repli-
cate these previously described indicators of secondary damage after severe TBI. CCI caused a sustained decrease 
in cerebral blood flow and oxygen tension in the penumbra of the lesion as the animals were being monitored at

the hyperacute phase of TBI. Furthermore, there were increases in the markers of neuroinflammation at 4 hours 
and in cerebral edema, breakdown of blood brain barrier, and lesion volume at 24 hours post-injury.
In contrast, animals exposed to TNS demonstrated attenuation of these pathological changes. After the initi-
ation of TNS, there was an instantaneous elevation of MAP, and at 60 minutes after the CCI-induced TBI, MAP 
was 11.7% higher in the treatment rats. Similar trends were observed with CBF and PbrO2 with 51.3% and 18.5% 
higher values, respectively in the treatment group. In current clinical practice, elevating MAP using intravenous 
fluids or vasoactive agents is one of the principle tools in TBI management, as it improves cerebral perfusion. As 
such, AANS-Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines recommend maintaining systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at 
least 100 mmHg in patients with severe TBI in order to minimize the chances of secondary brain injury14.
In this study, we were able to show that blood pressure can be elevated with TNS by exploiting existing neural 
pathways via the trigeminal nerve. Viral tracing studies of ethmoidal nerve have shown that these fibers project to 
multiple brainstem nuclei, including RVLM, nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), lateral tegmental field, supe-
rior salivatory nucleus (SSN) and Kolliker Fuse nucleus (KFN)31–33. Of these, the RVLM is most closely associated 
with the systemic vasomotor control. It contains C1 group of cells that are adrenergic, and they play a pivotal role in 
maintaining systemic vascular tone via modulation of intermediolateral column cells and sympathetic output22, 33, 34. 
TNS activates these C1 cells, which ultimately results in peripheral vascular resistance35, 36. With peripheral vaso-
constriction, blood is shunted centrally and directed towards more ischemia prone organs, such as the heart and 
the brain.
One important observation in our study is that while MAP increased by 8.1%, CBF increased by 70.4% in 
the naive rats. Similarly, in TNS-treated rats, MAP increased by 11.7% and CBF increased by 51.3% compared to 
TBI-control rats. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the increase in CBF is not just due to increased MAP. This 
is corroborated by the fact that CVR in the naive rats decreased by 32.8% during stimulation, which indicates that 
there was active cerebral vasodilation with TNS. This observation is consistent with multiple previous studies in 
both animals and humans37–43. The distal trigeminal nerve branches richly innervate cerebral vasculature, and

this entity is often referred to as the trigemino-cerebrovascular system25. The exact mechanism of how activation 
of the trigeminal nerve causes cerebral vasodilation is not fully understood, but there is evidence that the effect 
is primarily mediated by postganglionic trigeminal fibers, principally V1 branches44, 45. In animal studies, it has 
been shown that postganglionic trigeminal fibers play a role in attenuating vasospasm after SAH, and that lower 
density of V1 fibers in the vasculature have been associated with increased incidence of spasm, which is highly 
suggestive of the trigeminal nerve having tonic control of cerebral vessel diameter46–48. These fibers contain cal-
citonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and Substance P at their synaptic terminals, and when stimulated, these 
potent vasodilatory substances are released, resulting in vasodilation41, 49, 50.
There is also evidence that the vasodilatory effect of the trigeminal nerve is mediated in part by the parasympa-
thetic fibers from the sphenopalatine ganglion, with acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as 
mediators51–53. This pathway involves primarily V3 (mandibular nerve) as the afferent arm, and parasympathetic 
fibers via the sphenopalatine or otic ganglion as the efferent arm51. It should be noted that this pathway was not 
specifically targeted in this study. Furthermore, RVLM itself has been shown to cause cerebral vasodilation inde-
pendent of changes in cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) or cerebral glucose utilization (CMRGlc)22, 54, 55. 
All of the different ways that TNS can increase CBF has been summarized in Fig. 1. While this study was not 
specifically designed to determine the relative contribution of increase in CBF from each of these pathways, it is 
reasonable to postulate that the effect was mostly due to the activation of trigemino-cerebrovascular system via 
the distal V1 branches, as the needle electrodes were placed in the V1 distribution.
Enlargement of lesion volume beyond the initial impact size, increased edema and BBB permeability are 
key indicators of secondary brain injury. With improvement in perfusion, our results show that there were sig-
nificant decreases in edema level, BBB permeability and lesion volume. The average edema level, the extent of 
BBB permeability, and lesion volume in the TNS-treatment group were 6.1%, 54.4% and 36.1% less than the 
TBI-control group, respectively. We attribute this difference to the improvements in CBF and PbrO2 secondary to 
TNS treatment. With blood flow augmentation, it is conceivable to think that at the cellular level, both ischemia 
and hypoxia, the two key contributors of secondary damage, are being reduced in the penumbra, which resulted 
in the salvage of vulnerable neuronal tissue.
Besides ischemia and hypoxia, neuroinflammation is another major contributor to secondary brain injury. 
In fact, the use of anti-inflammatory agents, such as minocycline and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
(PPAR) agonists has been shown to induce favorable outcome after TBI in animal models1, 4. After the primary 
insult, resident microglial cells become activated, releasing cytokines56. Mechanical disruption of neurons and 
astrocytes and BBB also lead to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and extravasation of leukocytes in the 
injured area4. Inflammatory cascades further damages potentially salvageable tissue in the perilesional area. An 
interesting finding in our study is that inflammatory markers were significantly decreased in the treatment group. 
The levels of TNF-α
 and IL-6 were reduced by 23.8% and 20.1%, respectively in the TNS-treatment group com-
pared to the TBI-control animals, suggesting that TNS may have anti-inflammatory properties.
At this point, the etiology of this anti-inflammatory effect is unclear, although anti-inflammatory effect of TNS 
has been previously reported by Wang et al.57. In their model of epileptic rats, TNS caused reduced microglial 
activation as well as decreased levels of TNF-α
 and IL-1β
. The exact mechanism of how TNS reduces inflam-
mation has not been elucidated. However, there is evidence of interaction between the trigeminal nerve and 
microglia, especially in disease processes such as trigeminal neuralgia (TN)58, 59. In animal models, chronic con-
striction of the trigeminal nerve has been shown to activate microglia resulting in release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines60. While this indicates that irritation or compression of the nerve activates microglia, it does not explain 
how electrical stimulation of the nerve reduces neuroinflammation. In our model, one possible explanation for 
this reduction in inflammation is that it is a consequence of decreased ischemia and hypoxia at the cellular level. 
Both ischemia and hypoxia can trigger inflammatory cascades29, 30, 61–64. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that 
improved CBF and PbrO2 can dampen ischemia or hypoxia triggered inflammatory cascades. Another hypothesis 
is that TNS suppresses inflammation via the trigemino-vagal connection. Many studies have shown that vagus 
nerve stimulation has profound anti-inflammatory properties65–68. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of VNS 
in disease states such as TBI or hemorrhagic shock have been attributed to its anti-inflammatory effects69–72. 
Vagus nerve is the efferent arm of several reflex pathways that is initiated at the level of trigeminal nerve73. Most 
of these pathways have been studied and described in the context of hemodynamic changes due to trigeminal 
nerve stimulation in diving mammals. For example, bradycardia associated with mammalian diving reflex is due 
to increased vagal output to the heart, but the initiation of this reflex occurs at the level peripheral branches of 
trigeminal nerve, peripheral V1 branches in particular22. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that the decreases 
in inflammatory markers due to TNS may be mediated via this trigemino-vagal connection. Trigeminal nerve 
fibers project to NTS, one of the major parasympathetic centers in the brain stem. Both NTS and trigeminal sen-
sory nuclei project to the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN) of vagus, the major parasympathetic outflow nucleus74. 
Therefore, it is essential to investigate whether TNS does in fact mediate inflammatory cascades via this pathway 
using vagotomized animal models.
It is worth mentioning that percutaneous TNS devices have been approved in Europe, Canada and Australia 
for epilepsy and depression75, 76. If the benefits of TNS in TBI can be replicated in large animals and ultimately in 
human studies, it could have tremendous impact in trauma resuscitation and TBI management. Its utility would 
be particularly relevant in the critical prehospital setting where percutaneous TNS could be initiated as the patient 
is being transported to a trauma center for a definitive care. Furthermore, there are other pathological states 
besides TBI where the brain is at risk for ischemic and/or inflammatory damage, such as stroke or vasospasm 
after subarachnoid hemorrhage. TNS could offer some benefit in these situation as well. In fact, in a recent animal 
study, electrical stimulation of trigeminal nerve was shown to decrease lesion volume after middle cerebral artery 
occlusion, and the authors attributed this to increased CBF45. Further studies are necessary to explore TNS’s effi-
cacy in these pathological processes.

There are several limitations in this study. These experiments were conducted with a rat model. Results from 
large animal studies are needed to strengthen the conclusions of this study. In these experiments, we cannot quan-
tify relative contribution of CBF increase between increased MAP and decreased CVR. It is reasonable to assume 
that the increase in CBF is a sum of these contributing sources, with decrease in the vascular resistance playing a 
major role, since increase in MAP was modest, and yet CBF increase was substantial. In future studies, we plan to 
control blood pressure parameters and measure CBF after TNS in order to determine the relative contributions. 
As mentioned previously, this experiment was not designed to study anti-inflammatory effects of TNS, even 
though the treatment group had lower levels of inflammatory markers. The exact mechanism of the observed 
anti-inflammatory effect is unclear, and further studies are necessary to determine the exact neural pathways 
involved. Another limitation of this study was that the experiments were conducted in anesthetized animals using 
isoflurane. Isoflurane itself can interfere with hemodynamics as it has been reported to blunt cardiac parasym-
pathetic response77. Also, it has been previously reported that isoflurane can have neuroprotective properties78. 
However, these effects are accounted for since we are comparing the results to the control group which is sub-
jected to the same experimental conditions under identical isoflurane exposure.
In this study, we have demonstrated the potential of TNS as an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing 
secondary injury via existing neural pathways. In summary, electrical TNS caused the significant increase in 
systemic blood pressure, cerebral blood flow and brain oxygen tension. Consequently, we observed that TNS fol-
lowing CCI attenuated some of the important consequences of TBI by reducing brain edema, blood-brain barrier 
permeability, lesion volume, and levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. These data provide strong early evidence 
that activation of the trigeminal nerve system affords neuroprotection following brain damage.
Methods
Experimental Animals. 
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. All experiments were performed according to the approved protocol. 
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (325–400 g, Taconic Biosciences Inc.) were randomized three groups: (1) sham group: 
animals underwent surgery like other groups, but no CCI or electrical stimulation was delivered; (2) CCI-induced 
TBI group: similarly prepared animals received only CCI as vehicle group; (3) TNS treatment group: animals 
received both CCI and TNS.
Rat Model of 
TBI. 
Controlled cortical impact (CCI) method was used to induce TBI in male Sprague-Dawley rats79. 
The head of the animal was fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and a craniotomy was performed. During surgery, anes-
thesia was maintained at 2.0–2.5% isoflurane and body temperature was maintained at 37 °C. CCI was delivered 
using electromagnetic-based device set (Impact OneTM Stereotaxic CCI Instrument, Leica Biosystems) at most 
commonly used parameters to produce severe damage: 5 mm flat impact, 3 mm depth of impact at the velocity of 
6 m/s and 100 ms contact time. The “lateral” location of the impact was used: circular craniotomy of 6 mm diame-
ter was made halfway between bregma and lambda in the parietal bone centered at 4 mm lateral from the sagittal 
suture. Circular bone flap was preserved in saline and replaced after the impact.
Direct Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation. 
Hook electrodes (305-SL-2, PlasticsOne) were directly placed on 
the right and left branches of the ophthalmic nerves (V1) to provide bilateral stimulation. The ethmoidal nerves 
were isolated as previously described36. Briefly, the rats were placed in prone position. A curvilinear supraorbital 
incision (2–3 cm) was made, and the orbital contents were gently retracted laterally until the anterior ethmoidal 
nerve was visualized, passing above the inferior orbital nerve. The hook electrodes were placed directly under 
the nerve, ensuring adequate contact, and the electrode was connected to the electrical stimulator (Isolated Pulse 
Stimulator Model 2100, A-M Systems). The same procedure was repeated on the contralateral side. Stimulation 
parameters consist of frequency (25 Hz), intensity (1.0 V), duty cycle (1 sec on and 1 sec off), and pulse width 
(0.5 ms). Ophthalmic nerves were stimulated for 1 minute to investigate the effects of direct TNS on hemody-
namics in naïve rats.
Subcutaneous Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation. 
Electrical stimulation was performed by introducing two 
stainless needles (25 ga) subcutaneously bilaterally parallel to each other at imaginary lines connecting ear and 
eye. Rectangular cathode pulses (0.5 ms) were delivered by electrical stimulator (Isolated Pulse Stimulator Model 
2100, A-M Systems). Stimulation parameters consisted of frequency (100 Hz), intensity (3.0 V), duty cycle (1 sec 
on and 1 sec off), and pulse width (0.5 ms). Subcutaneous TNS was delivered for 1 minute to investigate its effect 
on hemodynamics in naïve rats. Total 5 subcutaneous TNS (1-minute TNS in every 11 minutes) was delivered at 
10 minutes after the CCI to investigate its effects on CCI-induced TBI.
Measurement of Blood Pressure (BP). 
Thin-walled polyethylene catheter (PE 50, BD Intramedic 
Polyethylene tubing) was placed in the left femoral artery for continuous recording of BP (SYS-BP1, World 
Precision Instruments, USA).
Brain Probe Implantation and Monitoring. 
Animals received a 1-mm craniotomy (ML: +2--> + 3 mm; 
AP: −
0-->1.5 mm; DV: −
4.5 mm) next to 6-mm craniotomy (ML: 0--> + 6 mm; AP: −
1.5-->−
7.5 mm) for CCI 
in the same hemisphere to implant multimodal neural probe80, 81. One neural probe that can measure CBF, tem-
perature and PbrO2 was implanted to a depth of 5 mm and fixated with dental acrylic cement. A waiting period of 
60 min followed the neural probe implantation to record the brain baseline signal.
Evaluation of Brain Edema. 
Brain water content, an indicator of brain edema, was measured with the 
wet-dry method at 24 h after CCI-induced severe TBI82. After the animals were killed by decapitation under deep 
anesthesia, their brains were removed and the ipsilateral cortical tissues were dissected and weighed immediately

to get wet weight. After drying in a desiccating oven for 48 h at 100 °C, the tissues were reweighed to yield dry 
weight. The percentage of water in the tissues was calculated according to the formula:
=
−
×
% brain water
[(wet weight
dry weight)/wet weight]

Evaluation of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity (BBB). 
BBB integrity was determined by Evans blue (EB) 
extravasation at 24 h after TBI83. Briefly, at 23 h after injury, 2% Evans blue was injected intravenously at a dose 
of 2 ml/kg. Animals were then re-anesthetized at 24 h and perfused with saline to remove intravascular EB dye. 
Animals were then decapitated, and the ipsilateral cortical tissues were dissected. Each tissue sample was weighed, 
homogenized in 2 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. the supernatant 
was then diluted with solvent (one part 50% trichloroacetic acid to three parts ethanol). Tissue levels of Evans 
blue dye were quantitated using a spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 620 nm and an emission 
wavelength of 680 nm. Sample values were compared with those of Evans blue dye standards mixed with the 
solvent (100–1000 ng/ml).
Quantification of Lesion Volume. 
Animals were euthanized under anesthesia, and then perfused tran-
scardially with 200 ml normal saline followed by 200 ml ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation. Brains were 
stored in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for 3 days for cry-
oprotection. Brains were then sectioned coronally (40 µm) on a freezing microtome with approximately 500 µm 
distance between slices. Sections were mounted onto gelatin coated slides, dried overnight and stained with 0.2% 
cresyl violet for measurement of brain tissue loss. The stained sections were photographed using a digital pathol-
ogy slide scanner (PathScan Enabler IV, Meyer Instruments, USA).
Brain Tissue Preparation and Determination of their TNF-α
 and IL-6 levels. 
At 4 h after TBI or 
sham operation, the brain was rapidly harvested. Brain samples were longitudinally cut along the middle line 
(cortex; 7 cm). The right and left hemispheres were excised, rinsed of blood and homogenized with polytron 
in a homogenization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline solution, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and protease 
inhibitor cocktail; pH, 7.2; 4 °C). After serval round 10 second sonication on ice, homogenates were centrifuged 
at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, supernatant protein concentration were measured and used for cytokine quantification. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits specifically for rat TNF-α
 and IL-6 (BD Biosciences, San 
Diego, CA, USA) were used. These assays were carried out according to the instructions provided by the manu-
facture. Brain levels of TNF-α
 and IL-6 were normalized to the protein concentration in the sample.
Data Collection and Processing. 
All data were digitized at 2 KHz with PowerLab digitizer (Powerlab 
16/SP analog/digital converter, ADInstruments). Data were stored and analyzed with LabChart 7.0 software 
(ADInstruments). To examine the effects of direct and subcutaneous trigeminal nerve branch stimulation on 
MAP, HR, PP, RR, CVR, CBF, PbrO2 and brain temperature, maximum/minimum values were analyzed from 
each TNS.
Statistical Analysis. 
All data are expressed mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by SigmaStat soft-
ware. The MAP, HR, PP and RR were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with simple contrasts when 
applicable. The CBF, PbrO2, brain temperature and CVR were similarly analyzed. The difference between multiple 
groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc test (Student-Newman-Keuls test). Student’s t-test was 
used when only two groups were compared. P values < 0.05 were considered significant, and P < 0.001 was con-
sidered even more significant.
