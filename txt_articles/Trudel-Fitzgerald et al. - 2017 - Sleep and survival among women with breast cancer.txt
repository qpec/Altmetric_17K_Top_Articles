Background: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women. Sleep has been linked with mortality among cancer-free
population; however, its association with survival among women with breast cancer is understudied.
Methods: Breast cancer patients (N ¼ 3682) reported their average sleep duration post diagnosis. Subsamples also provided their
pre-diagnosis sleep duration (n ¼ 1949) and post-diagnosis sleep difficulties (n ¼ 1353). Multivariate Cox models estimated hazard
ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) of all-cause, breast cancer, and non-breast cancer mortality.
Results: At diagnosis, the mean age was 64.9 years and 91.7% were stage I or II. Women sleeping X9 h per night post diagnosis
had a strong higher risk of all-cause (multivariate HRs: MV-HR ¼ 1.37, CI ¼ 1.10–1.71), breast cancer (MV-HR ¼ 1.46, CI ¼ 1.02–2.07),
and non-breast cancer mortality (MV-HR ¼ 1.34, CI ¼ 1.01–1.79), compared to women sleeping 8 h per night. Increased sleep
duration post diagnosis (vs unchanged) and regular sleep difficulties (vs rare/none) were associated with a strong elevated risk of
all-cause mortality (MV-HRincreased duration ¼ 1.35, CI ¼ 1.04–1.74; MV-HRregular difficulties ¼ 1.49, CI ¼ 1.02–2.19) and a moderate
greater risk of breast cancer and non-breast cancer mortality.
Conclusions: Various facets of sleep were associated with higher all-cause mortality risk. If replicated, these findings support
evaluation of breast cancer patients’ sleep duration and difficulties to identify those at risk for poorer outcomes.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide
(Center et al, 2011). In 2016, B246 660 new cases and 40 450
deaths occurred in the USA (American Cancer Society, 2016a).
Regardless of disease stage and position on the cancer trajectory,
from diagnosis, through treatment and survivorship, women with
breast cancer are likely to report poor sleep quality, in a higher
proportion than what is generally reported among the general
population (Savard and Morin, 2001; Fiorentino and Ancoli-Israel,
2006; Colagiuri et al, 2011; Mosher and Duhamel, 2012) and by
patients with other cancer sites (Garrett et al, 2011; Savard et al,
2011). Further, they experience shorter sleep duration compared
with
healthy,
age-matched
women
(Silberfarb
et
al,
1993;
Carpenter et al, 2004; Fiorentino and Ancoli-Israel, 2006).

 emotional response to diagnosis and treatment side effects (e.g., pain,
fatigue; Savard and Morin, 2001; Trudel-Fitzgerald et al, 2013) and
will frequently be reported for several years following diagnosis and
treatment (Savard et al, 2011; Zhou and Recklitis, 2014).
There is increasing interest in better understanding the role of
sleep in carcinogenesis (Erren et al, 2016). For instance, some
studies have suggested that short and long sleep duration are
associated with increased cancer incidence (Jiao et al, 2013; Luojus
et al, 2014; Xiao et al, 2016), though others have revealed null
findings (Sturgeon et al, 2012; Girschik et al, 2013; Vogtmann et al,
2013; Qian et al, 2015) or inverse associations (Sigurdardottir et al,
2012; Zhao et al, 2013). Similarly, the emerging literature on sleep
quality (e.g., difficulties falling/staying asleep, early awakening) and
cancer risk has been mixed (Kripke et al, 2002; Sigurdardottir et al,
2013; Erren et al, 2015; Fang et al, 2015; Sen et al, 2016). With
regard to mortality, self-reported sleep duration (Cappuccio et al,
2010; Shen et al, 2016), changes in sleep duration (Ferrie et al,
2007) and poor sleep quality (Dew et al, 2003) are associated with
increased risk of all-cause death among the general population.
However, less is known about their role in cancer survival. In a
recent research where self-reported sleep characteristics were
collected 7.5 years (median) before cancer diagnosis, short sleep
duration, alone or combined with frequent snoring, was related to
increased breast cancer mortality, whereas sleep quality was
unrelated (Phipps et al, 2016). However, given the role of
cancer-related factors (e.g., psychological distress, side effects of
treatments) in insomnia development (Savard and Morin, 2001)
and the sustained high rates of insomnia among breast cancer
patients in the first year following diagnosis (Savard et al, 2011),
considering the role of sleep characteristics after breast cancer
diagnosis in relation to future mortality risk is warranted.
Preliminary actigraph data from advanced stage breast cancer
patients suggested that poor sleep efficiency assessed up to 7 years
post diagnosis was associated with cancer-specific mortality over a
10-year follow-up period (Palesh et al, 2014). Albeit informative,
these studies have not considered mortality unrelated to breast
cancer, an important outcome on its own. To our knowledge, no
prior epidemiological study has examined the extent to which self-
reported sleep duration or difficulties assessed the first years
following a breast cancer diagnosis, as well as changes in sleep
duration from pre- to post diagnosis are related to all-cause, breast
cancer and non-breast cancer mortality over up to 30 years of
follow-up. Therefore, we investigated these associations in a large
cohort of women with non-metastatic breast cancer. Specifically,
we hypothesised that shorter and longer sleep duration, increase
and decrease in sleep duration, as well as sleep difficulties, would
be related to higher mortality risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants. The Nurses’ Health Study comprises 121 700 female
nurses who were enroled in 1976 (ages 30–55 years; Willett et al,
1987). They completed biennial questionnaires on demographic
characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, and newly diagnosed
medical conditions, with a response rate of 485% per ques-
tionnaire (Bao et al, 2016). All women who reported having a
diagnosis on biennial questionnaires were asked for permission to
review their pathology reports and medical records by a study
physician to confirm the diagnosis and assess tumour character-
istics (e.g., stage). Women who reported their sleep duration within
the
4 years
following
an
invasive
breast cancer
diagnosis
(N ¼ 3767) were eligible for this study; questions were assessed
in 1986, 2000, 2002, and 2008. We excluded participants who
reported a cancer before their breast cancer diagnosis (except non-
melanoma skin cancer; n ¼ 49) or stage IV diagnosis given the low
5-year relative survival (American Cancer Society, 2016b; n ¼ 36),
yielding an analytic sample of 3682 cases. To explore the
association of changes in sleep duration from pre- to post
diagnosis with mortality, a subsample of women was identified
(n ¼ 1949) who completed multiple questionnaires (e.g., 1986 and
2000) assessing sleep and diagnosed with breast cancer between
two time points. Another subsample consisted of women who
completed the sleep difficulties measure, only queried in 2000, in
the 4 years following their diagnosis (n ¼ 1353). The study protocol
was approved by the institutional review board of the Brigham and
Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, and the human investigations
were performed after approval. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
Measures. To assess average sleep duration, participants were
queried about their ‘total hours of actual sleep in a 24-hour period’
with the following responses: p5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or X11 h. In this
cohort, self-reported average time spent sleeping has been found
highly correlated with sleep duration as assessed by sleep diaries
(Spearman r ¼ 0.79; Po0.0001) and reproducible over time
assessments (sleep duration reported in 2000 and 2002 within a
1 h deviation: Cohen’s k statistic ¼ 0.81; Patel et al, 2004). Because
of small numbers, participants who reported p5 or 6 h of sleep
were grouped together for the current analyses, as were those with
X9 h of sleep. When comparing sleep duration before vs after
diagnosis, women were categorised as sleeping either X1 h less
(decrease), X1 h more (increase), or no change. Sleep difficulties
were assessed using the following question: ‘How much of the time
during the past 4 weeks did you have difficulty falling asleep or
staying asleep?’, with responses ranging from ‘all of the time’ to
‘none of the time.’ In this study, categories were collapsed to
regularly (all or most of the time), occasionally (a good bit or some
of the time), and rarely/never (a little or none of the time).
On the basis of similar prior work conducted in this cohort and
other samples (Kwan et al, 2013; Patel et al, 2004; Phipps et al,
2016; Xiao et al, 2016), relevant covariates included demographics
(marital status (married or in a relationship, divorced, separated, or
widowed), highest attained educational level (registered nurse
(RN), bachelor, graduate degree), census tract income (continuous,
in $)), cancer- and health-related variables (year of diagnosis
(continuous), age at diagnosis (continuous), time between date of
diagnosis and report of sleep (continuous)), stage (I, II, III), type of
surgery
(lumpectomy,
mastectomy),
chemotherapy
(yes/no),
radiation therapy (yes/no), hormone therapy (yes/no), prevalent
diabetes or heart disease (yes/no), hormone use and reproductive
history (oral contraceptive use (OC; ever/never), number of
pregnancies (continuous), family history of breast cancer (yes/
no), menopause status (pre-/postmenopausal), postmenopausal
hormone use (PMH, never/past/current user)), and other beha-
vioural variables (body mass index (BMI, kg m � 2; p25, 25.1–28.9,
X29), alcohol consumption (g per day; p6/46; Kwan et al, 2013),
pack-years of smoking (continuous), caffeine (mg per day;
quintiles), calories intake (kcal per day; quintiles), physical activity
(metabolic equivalent task, MET-h per week; 3, 3–8.9, 9–14.9, 15–
23.9, X24)) (Holmes et al, 2005). For exploratory analyses, a
composite binary score of depression was created using a Boolean
OR operator approach (Pan et al, 2011) based on self-reported
depressive symptoms (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992), physician-
diagnosed depression, and antidepressant use whenever these
information was available between 1986 and 2008. Cancer-related
variables (i.e., year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, stage, and
treatments) were extracted from participants’ medical records.
Nurses’ educational level was assessed on the 1992 questionnaire.
All other covariates were self-reported on the same questionnaire
in which women completed the sleep duration measurement (i.e.,
within 4 years post diagnosis).

 Deaths were reported by next of kin and postal authorities or
identified through the National Death Index, leading to 98%
mortality
follow-up
(Rich-Edwards
et
al,
1994).
Physicians
ascertained cause of death from death certificates, supplemented
as needed by medical records. Underlying cause of death was
assigned according to the International Classification of Diseases,
Eighth Revision (ICD-8; World Health Organization, 1967).
Statistical analyses. Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to assess the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) of mortality among breast cancer patients, from date
of diagnosis to the end of follow-up (June 2012) or death,
whichever came first. The relationship of sleep variables (i.e., post-
diagnosis sleep duration, change in sleep duration from pre- to
post diagnosis, and post-diagnosis sleep difficulties) with mortality
was examined in three sets of nested models. An initial model
adjusted for cancer- and health-related variables (listed above).
Given that information on cancer treatment was only available for
54.9–66.5% of the analytic sample (N ¼ 3682), we also included in
this first model a binary missing indicator for each oncologic
treatment (yes/no). We then added demographics and hormone-
related variables including reproductive history and the fully
adjusted model included behaviour-related covariates. To assess
the non-linear association of sleep duration and difficulties with
mortality outcomes, we calculated P-values for non-linear trend
across categories of sleep duration and difficulties, using a
quadratic term for the sleep variables. In the models using changes
from pre- to post diagnosis as the exposure, we further adjusted for
pre-diagnosis sleep duration. Sleep variables were assessed in
relation to all-cause death, breast cancer death, and non-breast
cancer death as distinct outcomes of interest. Because only one
subtype of death could occur for each participant (i.e., breast
cancer vs non-breast cancer death), a competing risks framework
was also used (Wang et al, 2016): using the cause-specific
proportional hazards models, we tested for heterogeneity to assess
whether the associations of sleep with both breast cancer and non-
breast cancer death were statistically different. Kaplan–Meier
curves were also implemented to depict the relation of sleep
duration categories with all-cause, breast cancer, and non-breast
cancer mortality.
Stratified analyses explored potential effect modifiers of the
association between sleep duration and mortality and the like-
lihood ratio tests were performed, when relevant, to verify
statistical significance. Specifically, stratification by age at diagnosis
(n465 years ¼ 1736 vs np65 years ¼ 1946), as well as post-diagnosis
physical activity levels (using the median; np8.5 MET-h per week ¼ 1843

subsample of women who completed both the sleep duration and

duration as the exposure were stratified by sleep difficulties
(nregularly/occasionally ¼ 550 vs nrarely/never ¼ 803) given prior work
suggesting an interaction effect on health-related
outcomes
(Carroll et al, 2015).
In distinct
sensitivity
analyses
we excluded:
(1) women
diagnosed 1 and 2 year(s), before the sleep assessment, separately,
to minimise effects of various oncologic treatments on sleep (n1-year
lag ¼ 1126; n2-year lag ¼ 1971); (2) women who died 1 year following
the sleep assessment to adjust for advanced disease that could
impact sleep and survival and to account for reverse causation (i.e.,
undiagnosed morbidity/advanced disease might influence sleep
subsequently and also directly affect mortality; n ¼ 77); (3) women
categorised as depressed (n ¼ 559). Additional sensitivity analyses
adjusted for sleep difficulties in models using sleep duration as the
exposure and vice versa; supplemental models were further
adjusted for prior history of shift work (Lin et al, 2015), snoring
(Phipps et al, 2016), and sleep/anxiety medication (Kripke et al,
2002). Because results from all sensitivity analyses were largely
similar to our main analyses, for the sake of parsimony only the
main models are presented here. All analyses were conducted using
SAS software version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) with a two-sided P-
value of 0.05.
RESULTS
At the time of diagnosis, women were on average 64.9 years old
(s.d. ¼ 9.3) and almost all (88.3%) postmenopausal. At the time of
sleep measure completion (on average 1.7-year post diagnosis,
s.d. ¼ 1.1), the majority were married (73.2%), had an RN degree as
their highest attained educational level (72.8%), and few reported
diagnoses of diabetes or heart disease (13.3%). Nearly a quarter
reported a family history of breast cancer (22.6%), and most had an
early stage cancer (stages I or II: 91.7%). The distribution of
variables across sleep duration categories is presented in Table 1.
Among the complete sample of 3682 women, there were 976
deaths, including 412 breast cancer and 564 non-breast cancer
deaths, over the follow-up period (median 11 years between
diagnosis and death). Compared to women who reported sleeping
8 h per night on average, those who slept X9 h had a strong higher
risk
of
all-cause
(HR ¼ 1.45,
CI ¼ 1.16–1.80),
breast
cancer
(HR ¼ 1.49, CI ¼ 1.05–2.10), and non-breast cancer mortality
(HR ¼ 1.40, CI ¼ 1.05–1.87) in the initial models adjusting for
cancer- and health-related variables (Table 2). The strength of the
relationship was fairly robust to the inclusion of demographics,
hormone-, and behaviour-related variables in the multivariate
models (MV-HRall-cause ¼ 1.37, CI ¼ 1.10–1.71 (Figure 1); MV-
HRbreast cancer ¼ 1.46, CI ¼ 1.02–2.07 (Supplementary Figure 1);
MV-HRnon-breast
cancer ¼ 1.34,
CI ¼ 1.01–1.79
(Supplementary
Figure 2). No statistical association was observed between the
other sleep duration categories and any cause of mortality
(Table 2), although the estimates mirrored a U-shaped association
with shorter sleep duration being associated with a small elevated
risk of mortality. Accordingly, the P-values for the test of non-
linearity were statistically or marginally significant in all fully
adjusted models (Pp0.12).
Table 3 displays the associations between change in sleep
duration from pre- to post diagnosis and mortality (n ¼ 1949; 381
all-cause, 132 breast cancer, 249 non-breast cancer deaths).

and non-breast cancer death were associated with sleep duration
increases with a similar magnitude (MV-HRbreast cancer ¼ 1.29,
CI ¼ 0.84–2.00; MV-HRnon-breast cancer ¼ 1.32, CI ¼ 0.96–1.82; com-
peting risk analyses, P ¼ 0.97), but power was more limited.
Compared to women who reported no change, those with at least
1 h decrease in sleep duration did not clearly exhibit a greater
mortality risk, except for non-breast cancer mortality (MV-HRall-
cause ¼ 1.26, CI ¼ 0.97–1.65; MV-HRbreast cancer ¼ 0.89, CI ¼ 0.55–
1.45; MV-HRnon-breast cancer ¼ 1.42, CI ¼ 1.02–1.96; competing risk
analyses, P ¼ 0.09).
The relationship of sleep difficulties with mortality was only
strong for all-cause deaths in the subsample of 1353 participants
(Table 4; 366 all-cause, 119 breast cancer, and 247 non-breast
cancer deaths). Specifically, compared to women who reported rare
or no sleep difficulties, those who regularly struggled falling or
staying asleep had a greater all-cause mortality risk (MV-
HR ¼ 1.49, CI ¼ 1.02–2.19). Although breast cancer death was
suggestively related to experiencing regular sleep difficulties (MV-
HR ¼ 1.78, CI ¼ 0.94–3.36), non-breast cancer death was not
associated (MV-HR ¼ 1.38, CI ¼ 0.85–2.26) and these two associa-
tions were not statistically different (competing risk analyses,
P ¼ 0.68). No associations were noted between occasional sleep
difficulties and mortality, and none of the P-values for non-linear
trend were statistically significant (Table 4).
Stratified analyses revealed that neither age at diagnosis, nor
levels of physical activity or snoring post diagnosis were effect
modifiers of the association between sleep duration and mortality;
null results were also noted for the interaction of sleep difficulties
with sleep duration (results not shown). However, among women
with post-diagnosis depression status information (n ¼ 2878),
differences emerged among short sleepers: those with p6 h of
sleep per night who were non-depressed post diagnosis (n ¼ 2319;
152 breast cancer deaths) had a strong reduced breast cancer
mortality
risk
(MV-HRnon-depressed ¼ 0.48,
CI ¼ 0.30–0.76),
whereas those who were depressed (n ¼ 559; 48 breast cancer
deaths) had a suggestively higher risk (MV-HRdepressed ¼ 2.30,
CI ¼ 0.99–5.31, Pinteractiono0.01), compared to their respective
counterparts who slept 8 h per night. The impact of depression
status was only observed with breast cancer death for women who
slept p6 h per night; no statistical interaction effects were found
for sleep duration of 7 or 9 h, nor other causes of death.
DISCUSSION
We found that women with breast cancer who sleep at least 9 h
have a 37, 46, and 34% greater risk of all-cause, breast cancer,
and
non-breast
cancer
mortality,
respectively,
than
those
who
sleep
8 h;
no
associations
were
observed
for
sleep
durations o8 h. An increase in sleep duration from pre- to post
diagnosis, compared to no change, was associated with a 35%
higher risk of all-cause death. Furthermore, women who
reported regular sleep difficulties had a 49% increased risk of
all-cause mortality, compared to women without such frequent
difficulties.
Overall, research has been inconsistent in relating sleep with
incident breast cancer and very limited as it relates to breast cancer
survival. The increased mortality observed among long sleepers is
consistent
with
recent
meta-analyses
that
demonstrated
an
association between sleep duration, and all-cause and cardiovas-
cular death in the general population (Cappuccio et al, 2010; Shen
et al, 2016). However, the elevated breast cancer mortality risk for
longer duration (X9 h) is particularly novel. Various mechanisms
of the long sleep duration–mortality relationship have been
proposed, including sleep fragmentation, lack of physiological
challenge (e.g., exercise), depression, and underlying disease
processes
(e.g.,
sleep
apnoea,
heart
disease;
Grandner
and
Drummond, 2007). Several of these mechanistic factors may
actually serve as confounders/effect modifiers (e.g., depression,
sleep apnoea, fatigue) rather than being true mediators (e.g., lack of
physiological challenge, shortened photoperiod) (Stamatakis and
Punjabi, 2007). In the current study, sleep fragmentation was
indirectly assessed by adjusting for sleep difficulties in sensitivity
analyses, whereas physical activity and prevalent diabetes/heart
disease, and snoring (as a proxy for sleep apnoea) were considered
as confounders and effect modifiers. Further models stratified by
depression status post diagnosis and sensitivity analyses excluded
women who were depressed when the sleep measures were queried.
Thus, the robustness of our findings for all mortality outcomes
supports the possible role of long sleep duration on mortality
among breast cancer patients. Despite adjustment for health
behaviours and cancer-related factors, which tended to be less
favourable among women of this sample reporting X9 h per night

 proportion of ER þ or PR þ receptors), long sleep could duration
could still reflect an underlying health condition. Nonetheless, by
corroborating results obtained from non-cancer/healthier popula-
tions, these results are consistent with prior literature suggesting
that the mechanism of elevated risk among long sleepers is not
limited to a single organ system or condition; rather it may impair
health function globally (Kripke et al, 2002; Patel et al, 2004).
Short sleep duration was not statistically associated with all
mortality outcomes in the overall sample, although the estimates
mirrored the U-shaped association that has been observed among
varied populations (Cappuccio et al, 2010; Shen et al, 2016) and
additional trend analyses suggested such non-linear association.
Unlike recent work (Phipps et al, 2016), snoring did not alter the
relationship of short sleep duration with mortality, which could be
related to the timing of assessment (pre- vs post-cancer diagnosis).
However, a strong relationship for short sleep was noted among
non-depressed vs depressed women. Of note, the number of deaths
per level of sleep duration was relatively small in these stratified
analyses (models with depressed women: ndeaths ¼ 8–36), leading to
less stable estimates with wider CIs. Hence, the moderating impact
of depression in the relationship of sleep duration with mortality
should be interpreted cautiously and warrants replication. More-
over, increased sleep duration from pre- to post diagnosis was
associated with 38% elevated all-cause mortality risk. Such
additional hours of sleep, regardless of pre-diagnosis sleep
duration,

 physiological response to the cancer diagnosis and treatments.
For instance, fatigue is a common side effect of cancer treatment,
thus patients are often told to rest in order to recuperate (Ancoli-
Israel et al, 2001). Although napping seems beneficial in the
short term, such behaviour may disrupt the sleep-wake schedule
over time and serve as a precipitating factor for the development
of insomnia (Savard and Morin, 2001; Trudel-Fitzgerald et al,
2013), a sleep disorder that may continue to impact health
function well after the patient has ended treatment (Zhou and
Recklitis, 2014).
One of the most commonly reported complaints in oncology
is poor sleep quality, seen in up to 70% of non-metastatic breast
cancer patients within the first months following diagnosis
(Fiorentino and Ancoli-Israel, 2006; Savard et al, 2011; Palesh
et al, 2013). Chronically poor sleep may influence cancer
outcomes through impaired immune function (Sephton and
Spiegel, 2003; Lange et al, 2010), metabolic pathways leading to
obesity (Mullington et al, 2009; Buxton et al, 2012), and altered
melatonin release (Blask, 2009). The current results identified a
statistically higher risk of all-cause mortality in women reporting
regular sleep difficulties compared to those who reported little or
none. These novel findings suggest that beyond sleep duration,
sleep difficulties should be considered to fully understand how
patients’ health may be impacted. Two previous prospective
cohort studies documented no association between sleep quality
and breast cancer incidence (Girschik et al, 2013; Vogtmann
et al, 2013), whereas recent work suggested that experiencing
several, but not single, insomnia symptoms was related to
increased risk (Sen et al, 2016). As deficient sleep- and age-
related physical declines are often intertwined (Zee and Turek,
2006), poor sleep may exacerbate underlying diseases processes
leading to worse health outcomes in breast cancer patients,
whereas cancer-free individuals may not be affected to the same
extent.
The current study has some limitations. First, because the
assessment of sleep variables was self-reported, and the study
design is observational, it is impossible to conclude whether sleep
duration and difficulties are causally related to future mortality
risk in breast cancer patients (Stamatakis and Punjabi, 2007;
Kurina et al, 2013). The relationship might also be bidirectional,
where declining health may foster longer sleep, as the individual
is less able/willing to get out of bed (Grandner and Drummond,
2007). However, our sample did not encompass stage IV cancer
cases and our main results were largely unchanged in the
sensitivity analyses addressing reverse causation, thus lowering
the likelihood of this issue. Next, the majority of the sample were
Non-Hispanic White of similar socioeconomic status, limiting
the generalisability of the results. Furthermore, using missing
indicators for each oncologic treatment may yield biased
estimates, although models without such indicators suggested
similar increased risk among the subset of women with treatment
information. Finally, additional confounders/mediators (e.g.,
sleep apnoea, altered immune functioning, shortened light
exposure, fatigue; Grandner and Drummond, 2007) were not
available for these analyses, but should be considered in future
work.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to explore
the effects of self-reported sleep duration, changes in sleep
duration from pre- to post diagnosis, and sleep difficulties, all
assessed within 4 years after diagnosis (mean of 1.7-year post
diagnosis), on future mortality risk in non-metastatic breast
cancer patients. This novel research conducted among a large
sample of women using a prospective design with up to 30 years
of
follow-up
suggests
that
longer
sleep
duration
(X9 h),
increased sleep duration from pre- to post diagnosis, and sleep
difficulties are associated with all-cause mortality. From a
research
perspective,
the
mechanisms
underscoring
these
associations should be explored. If these results are replicated
in future work, it will be important to evaluate breast cancer
patients for long and changing sleep duration, in addition to
sleep difficulties in the clinical setting, to identify patients who
may be at risk for poor outcomes.
