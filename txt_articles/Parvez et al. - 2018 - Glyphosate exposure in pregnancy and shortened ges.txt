Abstract
Background: Glyphosate (GLY) is the most heavily used herbicide worldwide but the extent of exposure in human
pregnancy remains unknown. Its residues are found in the environment, major crops, and food items that humans,
including pregnant women, consume daily. Since GLY exposure in pregnancy may also increase fetal exposure risk,
we designed a birth-cohort study to determine exposure frequency, potential exposure pathways, and associations
with fetal growth indicators and pregnancy length.
Method: Urine and residential drinking water samples were obtained from 71 women with singleton pregnancies
living in Central Indiana while they received routine prenatal care. GLY measurements were performed using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Demographic and survey information relating to food and water
consumption, stress, and residence were obtained by questionnaire. Maternal risk factors and neonatal outcomes
were abstracted from medical records. Correlation analyses were used to assess relationships of urine GLY levels
with fetal growth indicators and gestational length.
Results: The mean age of participants was 29 years, and the majority were Caucasian. Ninety three percent of the
pregnant women had GLY levels above the limit of detection (0.1 ng/mL). Mean urinary GLY was 3.40 ng/mL
(range 0.5–7.20 ng/mL). Higher GLY levels were found in women who lived in rural areas (p = 0.02), and in those
who consumed > 24 oz. of caffeinated beverages per day (p = 0.004). None of the drinking water samples had
detectable GLY levels. We observed no correlations with fetal growth indicators such as birth weight percentile and
head circumference. However, higher GLY urine levels were significantly correlated with shortened gestational
lengths (r = − 0.28, p = 0.02).
Conclusions: This is the first study of GLY exposure in US pregnant women using urine specimens as a direct
measure of exposure. We found that > 90% of pregnant women had detectable GLY levels and that these levels
correlated significantly with shortened pregnancy lengths. Although our study cohort was small and regional and
had limited racial/ethnic diversity, it provides direct evidence of maternal GLY exposure and a significant correlation
with shortened pregnancy. Further investigations in a more geographically and racially diverse cohort would be
necessary before these findings could be generalized.

 Background
Glyphosate (GLY, N-phosphonomethylglycine) is a broad-
spectrum phosphate herbicide. GLY is the active ingredient
in the herbicide Roundup, which is the most heavily used
herbicide worldwide [1–4]. In the United States alone,
nearly 300 million pounds are applied each year [5]. GLY
usage is heaviest in the Midwest due to corn and soybean
production. Agricultural run-off has resulted in high detec-
tion rates of GLY in US streams, rivers, and lakes [6–8]. In
addition, crops that are genetically modified to be GLY re-
sistant (i.e., Roundup-ready) have GLY residue. Over 90%
of corn, soy, and canola grown in the United States are
modified in this way, and these grains are used in most
processed foods [2].
In utero exposure to either Roundup or GLY alone has
been linked to birth defects and fetal loss in chickens,
frogs, and mammals [9–11]. While these studies did not
replicate human exposure in the low dose range, they
found fetal toxicity risks such as dilated hearts and vis-
ceral anomalies in rats and post-implantation loss and
late embryonic deaths in rabbits at doses as low as
20 mg/kg/day. GLY also has been shown to disrupt im-
portant pathways in development, such as retinoic acid
signaling and estrogen biosynthesis [11]. Further, GLY
has been reported to disrupt enzymatic pathways, such
as the cytochrome P450, and to damage DNA structure
in human breast epithelial and placental cells [12–14].
GLY inhibits aromatase (CYP19A1) activity by a direct
interaction with the active site of the enzyme at concen-
trations 100 times lower (0.036 g/L) than the recom-
mended use in agriculture, i.e., 3.6 g/L [12]. Moreover,
GLY induced DNA damage and chromosomal breaks in
vitro and in vivo in mice [15].
Despite evidence of potential genotoxicity and terato-
genic activity of GLY in animal studies, GLY effects on
human pregnancy and fetal development have not been
investigated. Epidemiological evidence of GLY exposure
effects on reproductive and developmental health out-
comes is limited. A systematic review conducted in 2016
found only ten studies that had tested the association
between indirect measure of GLY exposure and adverse
pregnancy outcomes [16]. A California-based study on
a rural pregnant population for their residential proxim-
ity to farmland and exposure during the pre- and post-
conception period (i.e., 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after
conception) reported an increased risk of neural tube
defects (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.0-2.4) [17, 18]. A Minnesota Red River Valley
study reported a significant association between male
perinatal exposure to multiple pesticides including GLY
with increased risk (OR = 3.6; 95% CI, 1.0-4.0) of atten-
tion deficit hyperactivity disorder [19, 20]. In addition, a
few reproductive epidemiological studies have evaluated
GLY association with non-congenital anomalies with
mostly negative results. These include the Canadian Ontario
Farm Family Health Study [21–24], a Columbian Study,
and the Iowa and North Carolina Farm and Nonfarm Fam-
ily Studies [25, 26]. Only the Ontario Farm Family Health
study reported significant association between perinatal
exposure to GLY (and other pesticides) and increased risk
(OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6) of spontaneous abortion later in
pregnancy (12–19 weeks). Thus, most prior epidemiological
studies have been of limited sizes and findings have been
inconclusive due to methodological limitations, lack of dir-
ect measurement of GLY, and without definitive evidence
that GLY exposure harms human fetal development
[17–26]. Despite these inconclusive epidemiological
studies, the prevalence of GLY residues in genetically modi-
fied crops and contaminated drinking water [1–6, 8, 27]
warrants further investigation to determine the risk of
adverse fetal outcomes due to GLY exposure.
North American and European studies that measured
GLY in the urine or serum of individuals reported GLY
levels varied by geographical area and occupation type
[28–32]. Some studies have used an immunoassay meth-
odology to measure GLY levels, which is considered a less
reliable method due to lower sensitivity and higher false
positive rates; the limit of detection (LOD) for immuno-
assay ranged from 0.9 to 7.5 ng/mL [28, 31]. Other studies
that used more sensitive gas chromatography-mass spec-
trophotometery (GC-MS) or high performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrophotometery (HPLC/MS)
techniques reported LOD of 0.15 ng/mL or 2 ng/mL, re-
spectively [29, 30, 33, 34]. However, these studies did not
assess the association between GLY exposure and adverse
pregnancy outcomes.
Current evidence for an association between GLY ex-
posure and elevated risk of adverse reproductive and de-
velopmental
outcomes
is
limited
and
inconsistent.
Studies that relied on indirect estimates of GLY expos-
ure to investigate risks of congenital birth defects or
other developmental outcomes could not reliably esti-
mate the timing or dose of exposure during pregnancy.
GLY exposure was estimated from direct pesticide use
(pesticide user vs. non-user during pregnancy), residen-
tial proximity to areas with pesticide use, and multiple
pesticide use as a proxy for GLY exposure [35].
Despite, the inconclusive epidemiological evidence, the
risk of exposure is predicted to be high due to the preva-
lence of GLY residues in genetically modified crops and
contaminated drinking water [1–6, 8, 27]; thus, further
investigation to determine the risk of GLY exposure and
adverse fetal outcomes is warranted. To address this
need, we designed a prospective birth-cohort study to
test the hypothesis that GLY can be directly measured in
the urine of most pregnant women due to dietary inges-
tion of contaminated food, beverages, and drinking
water, and that higher GLY levels in pregnancy will

 correlate with adverse fetal outcomes. The goals of this
study were 1) to determine the prevalence and exposure
levels of GLY in pregnant women, 2) to assess the con-
tribution of demographic factors, diet, and drinking
water as potential exposure risks, and 3) to evaluate the
association between urine GLY level with pregnancy
length and fetal growth.
Methods
Recruitment of participants
This study was approved by the Indiana University Insti-
tutional Review Board (#1504233705). The participants
were recruited following referral from their obstetrician
at a private obstetrical practice in Central Indiana from
June 2015 to June 2016. Enrollment included 77 preg-
nant women between the ages of 18 and 40 years during
their routine obstetrical prenatal visit. Signed informed
consent and HIPAA authorizations were obtained from
all participants. Six participants were excluded from the
study: two were ineligible due to higher maternal age,
two encountered pregnancy loss during the study period,
and two changed obstetrical care providers. A subset of
(n = 71) pregnant women with a singleton live birth were
measured for urine GLY. The subject selection was ran-
dom within each drinking water source (e.g., public
water supply and private well water). All participants re-
ceived monetary compensation for their participation in
the study.
Study questionnaire
Each participant was asked to complete a questionnaire,
which was administered online using REDCap or in a
paper form at a subsequent prenatal clinical visit. The
questionnaire included dietary and drinking water in-
take, occupation, and demographic characteristics. The
primary variables were: race/ethnicity, maternal age, ma-
ternal education, state of residence, county of residence,
zip code of residence, marital status, occupation, trimes-
ter of sample collection, drinking water source, fre-
quency and volume of water consumption, frequency of
organic food intake, recent application of GLY, stress
levels, caffeine consumption, smoking status, and alco-
hol consumption.
Abstraction of medical records
The participants’ medical charts were reviewed following
delivery of their babies. Each maternal record was reviewed
for pregnancy risk factors, gestational length, and fetal
growth indicators, i.e., birth weight percentile and head
circumference. Gestational length was calculated based on
last menstrual period and obstetrical adjustment by first
ultrasound.
Maternal
records
included:
pre-pregnancy
characteristics, complications during pregnancy, pregnancy
length, and newborn characteristics. Prepregnancy factors
included: maternal age, pre-existing diseases (i.e., diabetes,
hypertension), insurance, substance use, parity, plurality,
and prior adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy factors
included: prenatal care, singleton gestational, and weight
gain during pregnancy, hypertension, diabetes, medications,
substance and/or tobacco use, duration of pregnancy, com-
plications of labor and delivery, and method of delivery.
Neonatal factors included: gender and fetal growth
indicators
(birth
weight,
gestational
adjusted
birth
weight
percentile,
and
head
circumference).
Any
abnormal course in post-delivery of the newborn such
as congenital anomalies, higher level of care, longer length
of stay, and health conditions at discharge were also
recorded.
Specimen collection
Urine specimens were obtained as residual samples from
the pregnant women that were collected as part of rou-
tine prenatal care. A urine sample was collected from
each woman at the initial time of enrollment and at a
subsequent clinical visit between 11 and 38 weeks of
gestation. Upon enrollment, each participant was pro-
vided with a drinking water collection kit and written
and verbal instructions for consistency in drinking water
collection and to avoid contamination. A residential
drinking water sample was collected the same day as the
second prenatal urine sample. On the day of urine col-
lection, all study samples were transported to the study’s
hospital laboratory for processing. All study samples
were de-identified, stored at -70 °C, and then shipped to
the University of California San Francisco Clinical Toxi-
cology and Environmental Biomonitoring Laboratory for
GLY analysis. Although we had two urine samples from
each pregnant woman, GLY measurements were ob-
tained from their second urine sample since it was col-
lected on the same day as their water sample, and both
urine and water were analyzed for GLY.
Analytical method
GLY measurements in urine and drinking water were
obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC-MS/MS) using an Agilent LC 1260 system
(Agilent LC 1260- AB Sciex 5500 Triple Quadrupole
MS, St. Clara, CA) with an Obelisc-N mixed-mode
column (2.1x100mm 5 μm) that was maintained at 40 °
C. A 25 μL sample was injected into the column and
GLY was eluted using a mobile phase of 1% formic acid
in bisphenol-A free water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
The total run time was 6 min. External calibration was
used for drinking water analysis and standard addition
for urine analysis. Mass spectral analysis was performed
using an electrospray ionization source operated in
negative mode. The parameters used for ionization in-
clude curtain gas 20 psi, collision gas 9 psi, ion spray

 voltage -4500 V, temperature 700 °C, and ion source gas
60 psi. GLY was monitored using two transitions: 168.1–
62.9 m/z (qt) and 168.1–81.0 m/z (ql). We used 2-13C-
N-GLY as an internal standard and monitored using the
169.4–63.0 m/z transition. Quantitative analysis of GLY
was done by isotope dilution method. All measured
urine samples were corrected for specific gravity in our
analysis for differences in urinary dilution. The estab-
lished limits of quantification (LOQ) and LOD for GLY
in drinking water were 0.08 and 0.02 ng/mL, respect-
ively, while the LOQ and LOD in urine were 0.5 and
0.1 ng/mL, respectively. These limits are lower than the
two previously reported methods on urine GLY meas-
urement [36, 37].
Statistical analyses
The primary measures, urine GLY, indicators of fetal
growth (e.g., birthweight percentile, head circumference),
and gestational length, were continuous numerical vari-
ables. Continuous numerical variables were assessed for
central tendency, dispersion, and skewness before formal
analyses. GLY levels were summarized as quartiles, mean,
minimum, and maximum. In five cases where GLY was
less than the LOD, 0.1 ng/mL was substituted as the
measured level for subsequent statistical analysis. Since
continuous variables exhibited deviations from normality
(i.e., non-parametric data) upon preliminary examination,
Kruskal Wallis, a rank-based nonparametric test, was used
for group comparisons. The rank-based Kruskal Wallis
test provides a robust non-parametric alternative to trad-
itional linear regression which requires certain underlying
conditions or assumptions to be met, particularly for
smaller sample sizes [38, 39]. Questionnaire-based cat-
egorical variables were summarized as groups (sub-cat-
egories) to
compare
mean urine
GLY
levels
using
nonparametric chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests as
appropriate. The Chi-square test was used to determine
whether there was a significant difference across different
groups for urine GLY levels, while Fisher’s exact test was
used to determine whether there was a significant dif-
ference between any two groups for urine GLY levels
[40].
Nonparametric
Spearman
partial
correlations
were developed to quantify associations between two
continuous variables while controlling for potential
confounders. This includes association between the inde-
pendent variable, urine GLY levels, and a dependent
variable (e.g., birth weight percentile, head circumference,
and gestation length) adjusted for confounders. The
key confounders included in correlation analysis were
maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, tobacco
use, alcohol use, and trimester of pregnancy. All analyses
were performed using R package (R 3.3.3, R Core Team).
Two-sided p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 71 pregnant women with live-born singleton
infants were included in this study; the dropout rate was
less than 1%. Mean maternal age was 29 years (range
18–39 years). Maternal race was Caucasian (94.2%) and
Asian (5.8%). The study population included participants
from nine counties in Central Indiana which represented
a mix of rural, suburban, and urban addresses, as well
as, public and well water supplies.
Maternal urine GLY levels
The maternal population was used to determine the dis-
tribution of measured GLY in urine (Table 1). GLY levels
were estimated as quartiles, mean, standard deviation
(SD), coefficient of variance (CV), minimum, and max-
imum. GLY levels above the LOD > 0.1 ng/mL were
found in 66 of 71 (93%) urine samples. The mean (±SD)
and median GLY levels were 3.40 ± 1.24 and 3.25, re-
spectively. The minimum and maximum concentrations
of urinary GLY were 0.5 ng/mL and 7.20 ng/mL, re-
spectively. The CV was 0.36, which indicated low expos-
ure variability across participants in the study. The
estimated mean GLY concentrations with and without
the five urine samples that were below LOD were not
statistically significantly different (p = 0.43). Therefore,
urine GLY levels for all 71 participants were used for the
correlation analysis.
(a) Relationship between urine GLY levels and survey
variables
The analysis of measured urinary GLY levels in the preg-
nant women was stratified based on the administered
survey variables on demographic determinants, dietary
and drinking water intake, and infant sex (Table 1).
Based on the survey responses, few mothers smoked
(16.9%), consumed alcohol (4.2%), or used drugs (1.4%)
during pregnancy. The majority of participants had body
mass index < 30 (74.6%), a college degree (47.9%), a
household income of $50,000 or more per annum (69%),
lived in suburban and urban areas (80.3%), ate processed
food (69%), drank water from a public water system
(93%), and consumed caffeine (87.3%).
Maternal area of residence and caffeine consumption
were the only two variables that were significantly asso-
ciated with urine GLY measures (Table 1). The urine
GLY levels were substantially higher for women who
lived in rural areas (p = 0.02) or consumed > 24 oz. of
caffeine (p = 0.004) compared to women who lived in
urban or suburban areas, or consumed < 24 oz. of caf-
feine per day (Fig. 1). Though not statistically significant,
there were trends towards lower GLY with increasing pre-
pregnancy BMI, increasing organic food intake, and lower
stress levels reported by participants (Fig. 1). No correla-
tions were found between GLY levels and maternal age

(b) Correlation between urine GLY and parameters of fetal
growth and gestational length
Two infants were born preterm, i.e., < 37 weeks of gesta-
tion. The overall mean (± SD) gestational age of all 71
births was 273.86 ± 7.0 days, mean birth weight was 3412 ±
535 g, and head circumference was 34.4 ± 1.9 cm (Table 2).
The mean maternal age was 29 years, and pre-pregnancy
BMI was 27. Comparison of overall mean with newborn
sex-specific means of maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI,
fetal growth outcomes, and gestational length showed no
statistically significant differences. We did not find an effect
of BMI on urine GLY levels. Some human studies on simi-
lar compounds such as organophosphate pesticides also re-
ported no association with BMI, while others have found
inverse or positive correlations [41, 42]. Therefore, there is
no conclusive evidence that BMI is associated with urinary
excretion of GLY.
Spearman partial correlation analysis was performed
for association between measured GLY level and the
indicators of fetal growth and gestational age in the
presence of key confounders (Fig. 2). A significant nega-
tive correlation was found between urine GLY levels and
gestational length (r = − 0.30, p = 0.01). However, no cor-
relation was found with reduced birth weight (r = − 0.14,
p = 0.27) or head circumference r = − 0.06, p = 0.64).
Discussion
The main finding of this study was that a very high pro-
portion (93%) of pregnant women from a Midwest

 more recently (2015–2016) than the Iowa Study (2001),
and it is likely that GLY exposure has gone up over time
as was reported by Mills et al., 2017 [43]. Another ex-
planation of why the frequency of urine GLY detection
in our study was higher than the reported levels in
the Minnesota Red River Valley and South American
studies is because our LOD was 10 times lower than
in these studies (0.1 vs 1 ng/mL) [31, 32]. In a recent
German study, GLY was detected in a significant num-
ber
of
individuals
who
consumed
meats.
In
that
study, people who consumed conventional (n = 99) vs
organic diets (n = 41) had significantly higher urine GLY
levels (p = 0.0002). Also, people who had chronic dis-
eases (n = 102) vs. healthy subjects (n = 199) had signifi-
cantly higher urine GLY levels (p = 0.03). The reported
mean urine GLY level was 5.4 ± 11.5 μg/mL [33].
In the Indiana birth cohort, all drinking water samples
had no detectable GLY. Thus, it is unlikely that the
source of GLY exposure in these women was drinking
water. Water treatment processes that use alum as a co-
agulant to remove turbidity, also remove GLY [44]. Since
we did not measure GLY residues in participants’ food
and beverages in our study, we relied on participants’ re-
sponse for frequency of organic food intake and caffein-
ated beverages to determine correlations with urine GLY
levels. However, previous studies have suggested that the
likely primary sources of GLY exposure was the diet. For
example, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
database lists soybeans, corn, barley, lentils, linseed,
mustard seed, oats, sorghum, wheat, coffee beans, tea,
beet root, and mushroom as crops with GLY residues
[45]; Bohn et al. (2014) demonstrated that genetically
modified soy beans have significant GLY and metabolite
AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropio-
nic acid) residues (GLY = 3.3 mg/kg and AMPA =
5.7 mg/kg) [46]; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) in 2015–2016 reported GLY residues in 29.7% of
food samples. The foods with the highest residue rates
were beans, peas, lentils, grains, infant cereal and
baby food, followed by juice and other processed forms
of fruits and vegetables [47]. Recently, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) began preliminary testing of
samples of soybeans, corn, milk, and eggs for glyphosate
residues in 2017, which implies that these commodities
may have residual GLY [48].
Contrary to previous studies on GLY residues in dietary
food items, our study showed no correlation (p = 0.62) be-
tween urinary GLY levels with increasing frequency of or-
ganic food consumption (never = 3.86 ng/mL > rarely =
3.37 ng/mL > frequently = 3.25 ng/mL). However, it is diffi-
cult to confirm these findings in our study due to the small
size of the cohort and potential for reporting error and re-
call bias. Similarly, it is difficult to conclude caffeinated bev-
erages contain high GLY residues based on our finding that
urine GLY levels were significantly correlated (p = 0.004)
with the consumption of caffeine containing products (e.g.,
coffee, tea, and soft drinks). It is possible that some
caffeine-containing products have GLY; however, our ques-
tionnaire did not differentiate between caffeine products
and hence the evidence is only suggestive. Alternatively,
our results suggest that high doses of caffeine may alter
urine levels of GLY through a diuretic effect [49, 50].
Pregnant women from rural areas had significantly
higher urinary GLY levels than suburban residents (p =
0.02). Since the majority of rural participants were not
farmers or directly involved in Roundup application, this
suggests the inhalation of contaminated air or dust may
represent another exposure pathway for higher urine
GLY levels in rural areas. However, residential air sam-
ples were not collected in this study so this cannot be
confirmed. While Curwin et al. did not find significant
differences in GLY levels between children in farm vs.
non-farm families [28], other pesticide studies have re-
ported an association between exposure levels and prox-
imity to agricultural fields [30, 51, 52].
This study is the first to correlate direct measures of
GLY exposure in pregnancy with fetal growth indicators
and pregnancy length. Despite a small cohort size, we
found a small negative (r = − 0.30) but significant correl-
ation between urine GLY levels and gestational length
with confounders (p = 0.01). Previous studies have also
linked pesticide exposure with shorter gestation but nei-
ther study specifically measured GLY [53, 54].
This study reinforces a growing body of evidence sug-
gesting that pesticide exposure in pregnancy may be cor-
related with gestational length, as well as adverse fetal

 growth. Reduction in gestational length is now known to
correlate with life-long adverse consequences. Recent
evidence suggests that shortened gestations of one week
at term is associated with a reduction in lifetime cogni-
tive achievement [55]. Barker et al., have shown that
lower birth weight percentile represents an increased
risk for adult metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and
coronary death [56]. Our study showed no correlation of
reduced birth weight percentile (r = − 0.14, p = 0.27) and
head circumference (r = − 0.06, p = 0.64) with increasing
GLY levels. Also, our study did not report any correla-
tions between increasing urine GLY levels and decreas-
ing pre-pregnancy BMI (p = 0.15), decreasing organic
food consumption (p = 0.62), and increasing stress dur-
ing pregnancy (p = 0.2). However, further investigation in
a larger cohort is warranted to confirm these findings.
The majority of participants in our cohort were privately
insured,
Caucasian,
non-obese,
college
educated,
had
household income above the national average, did not con-
sume alcohol or smoke, and lived in urban or suburban
areas. The homogeneity of the cohort made the correla-
tions between glyphosate and adverse pregnancy outcomes
less sensitive to potential confounding by those variables re-
lated to race and socioeconomic factors.
Although this study provides new information about
GLY exposure in pregnancy and birth outcomes, there
are several limitations. The maternal cohort size is small,
and of limited racial, age, and geographic diversity. Al-
though this lack of diversity likely contributed to the
correlations between GLY and gestational length, it lim-
ited our ability to generalize these findings to a more di-
verse population. Many factors (especially race) have
significant effects on gestational length and birth weight
and additional data from ethnically diverse groups would
be required before our findings could be generalized. To
determine correlations between GLY levels and other
adverse pregnancy outcomes such as birth defects, mis-
carriage, preterm births, low birth weight, and small for
gestational age will require much larger cohort sizes
across diverse populations; thus, we did not investigate
these outcomes. Our study did not measure AMPA, a key
metabolite of GLY. GLY exposure estimates might have
been further improved by AMPA measurements but no
well-established and reliable analytical method is known
that can be used to measure AMPA in the urine matrix.
Thus, we were unable to determine whether AMPA is an
independent additive risk factor in pregnancy outcomes.
Conclusions
Glyphosate is found at quantifiable levels in over 90% of
pregnancies in the Indiana cohort. No drinking water
samples had quantifiable GLY levels; thus, the source of
exposure is most likely not drinking water. Women with
higher caffeine intake or living in rural areas were found
to have higher urine GLY levels. Higher GLY levels were
significantly associated with shorter gestational lengths.
The high frequency of GLY exposure (> 90%) found in
this study, combined with supportive evidence of short-
ened pregnancy length, mandates further research. This
study is significant because to our best knowledge, this
is the first US study designed specifically to measure
prenatal GLY exposure in pregnant women to determine
its association with adverse fetal developmental risk.
Additionally, the novel data on urinary GLY exposure in
pregnant women and potential exposure pathways provide
baseline information that is needed for designing future
reproductive toxicological and epidemiological studies.
