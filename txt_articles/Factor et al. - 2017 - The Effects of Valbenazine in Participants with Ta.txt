ABSTRACT
Background: Valbenazine, a highly selective vesicular 
monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment 
of tardive dyskinesia. This is the first report of long-term effects in 
adults with tardive dyskinesia.
Methods: Participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder, or a mood disorder who completed the 
6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of KINECT 3 
were eligible to enter the 42-week valbenazine extension (VE) 
period and subsequent 4-week washout period. The extension 
phase was conducted from December 16, 2014, to August 3, 
2016. Participants who received placebo and entered the VE 
period were re-randomized 1:1 to valbenazine 80 or 40 mg 
while others continued valbenazine at the KINECT 3 dose. Safety 
assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and scales for suicidal ideation/behavior, treatment-
emergent akathisia or parkinsonism, and psychiatric symptoms. 
Efficacy assessments included the Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale (AIMS) and Clinical Global Impression of 
Change-Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI-TD).
Results: 198 participants entered the VE period, 124 (62.6%) 
completed treatment (week 48), and 121 (61.1%) completed 
the follow-up visit after washout (week 52). During the VE 
period, 69.2% of participants had ≥ 1 TEAE, 14.6% had a serious 
TEAE, and 15.7% discontinued due to a TEAE. During washout, 
13.1% of participants experienced a TEAE. No apparent risk for 
suicidal ideation or behavior was found. Long-term valbenazine 
treatment did not appear to induce or worsen akathisia or 
parkinsonism. Participants generally remained psychiatrically 
stable during the study. AIMS and CGI-TD measures indicated 
sustained tardive dyskinesia improvement, with scores returning 
toward baseline after 4 weeks of valbenazine washout.
Conclusions: The long-term safety and tolerability of valbenazine 
were generally favorable, and maintenance of treatment effect 
was apparent with both doses during this long-term study.

T
ardive dyskinesia (TD) is a persistent, often disabling, 
and potentially irreversible movement disorder that has 
been associated with exposure to dopamine receptor blocking 
agents (DRBAs) such as antipsychotics.1–3 Evidence suggests 
that DRBAs up-regulate postsynaptic dopamine receptors, 
resulting in hypersensitivity and increased dopamine 
signaling, which in turn, leads to TD.4 Other pathogenetic 
hypotheses include GABAergic neuron dysfunction, 
synaptic plasticity dysfunction, or neurotransmitter system 
degeneration, which may also contribute to TD by altering 
basal ganglia pathways or neurons.5 Even with the advent 
of atypical antipsychotics, which were developed to lower 
the risk of side effects including TD, TD has remained an 
important clinical problem.6–9 The first practical step for 
treating TD is dose reduction or discontinuation of the 
antipsychotic. Often, however, this is not possible without 
exacerbation of the psychiatric disorder.10 Medications such 
as clozapine, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and benzodiazepines 
have been anecdotally reported to improve TD, but evidence 
for their efficacy is limited.10
Valbenazine, a novel and highly selective vesicular 
monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, is approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment 
of TD in adults. On the basis of its pharmacologic profile,11 it 
is hypothesized that the inhibitory effects of valbenazine may 
diminish monoamine neurotransmitter concentrations in the 
synaptic cleft, thereby reducing the availability of dopamine 
to hypersensitive postsynaptic receptors and reducing TD.12
In two 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) 
clinical trials (KINECT 2, NCT01733121; KINECT 3, 
NCT02274558),13,14 treatment with once-daily valbenazine 
resulted in significant improvement of TD compared to 
placebo. Short-term treatment with valbenazine was generally 
well tolerated, and stable psychiatric status was maintained in 
both DBPC studies. KINECT 3 was designed also to include a 
42-week treatment extension period for evaluating the long-
term safety and tolerability of valbenazine at doses of 40 and 
80 mg/d, along with its long-term effectiveness on TD. The 
current article reports the results from this extension period.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
KINECT 3 included a 6-week DBPC period, followed by 
a 42-week blinded valbenazine extension (VE) period and a 
4-week washout period, with final follow-up at week 52 (see 
Supplementary eFigure 1 at PSYCHIATRIST.COM). Detailed

Factor et al 
methods for the DBPC portion of KINECT 3 have been 
reported previously.14 The study protocol was approved by 
the institutional review board for each site. The study was 
conducted in accordance with International Conference on 
Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, US 
Code of Federal Regulations standards, FDA guidelines, and 
the Health Canada Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors. 
Only individuals with the capacity to provide consent (using 
the University of California, San Diego Brief Assessment of 
Capacity to Consent) were allowed to participate.
Participants who completed the 6-week DBPC period 
and re-consented to entering the VE period received 
valbenazine 40 or 80 mg/d. Participants already receiving 
either valbenazine dose continued the same dose; those 
receiving placebo were randomized (1:1) to valbenazine 40 
or 80 mg/d, with all dosing started at 40 mg/d and increased 
to 80 mg/d after the first week (in the group randomized to 
this dose). Participants were allowed 1 dose reduction during 
the study with blinding maintained, as previously reported.14
Key inclusion criteria for KINECT 3 were as follows: 
medically stable men and women with a Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
(DSM-IV) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder, or a mood disorder; moderate or severe TD 
based on the qualitative assessment of screening Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)15 videos by external 
AIMS reviewers; and stable psychiatric status at screening. 
Stable doses of concomitant medications to treat existing 
psychiatric disorders were allowed throughout the study. 
Exclusion criteria included comorbid movement disorder 
that was more prominent than TD (eg, parkinsonism, 
akathisia, truncal dystonia) and significant risk for active 
suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, or violent behavior.
Safety Analyses
All participants who entered the VE period were included in 
the safety analyses. All safety data were analyzed descriptively. 
Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG), and laboratory assessments. Emergence of suicidal 
ideation or behavior was monitored using the Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The Barnes Akathisia 
Rating Scale (BARS) and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) 
were used to evaluate for treatment-emergent akathisia 
and parkinsonism, respectively. Psychiatric status was 
monitored using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia 
(CDSS) in participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and 
Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in 
participants with mood disorder.
Efficacy Analyses
Although the primary aim of the VE period was to evaluate 
long-term safety, the long-term effects of valbenazine on 
TD were also assessed using the AIMS, the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change-Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI-TD), and 
the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).15 These 
analyses included all participants who entered the VE period. 
All participants, investigators, and central AIMS video raters 
were blinded to dose assignments during the VE period.
As in the DBPC period, all AIMS scoring in the VE 
period was based on the consensus of 2 central AIMS video 
raters who were blinded to study visit (as well as to treatment 
dose), including the week 52 follow-up visit. For the AIMS 
score, defined as the sum of scores from items 1–7, changes 
from baseline were analyzed by study visit (weeks 8, 16, 
32, 48, and 52) using arithmetic means based on observed 
cases. Post hoc analyses were also conducted to calculate the 
mean percent change for the AIMS score from baseline to 
week 48 and to determine whether mean changes in AIMS 
score at week 48 were statistically significant compared to 
the DBPC baseline. Both post hoc analyses were conducted 
in participants with an available AIMS score at the first visit 
in the VE period (week 8) using a last observation carried 
forward approach. Significance for the mean change in 
AIMS score was analyzed using 2-sided P values from a 
1-sample t test.
CGI-TD and PGIC mean scores were also analyzed, as 
were AIMS response (≥ 50% score reduction from baseline), 
CGI-TD response (rating of 1 [very much improved] or 2 
[much improved]), and PGIC response (rating of 1 [very 
much improved] or 2 [much improved]). Worsening was 
also analyzed using the AIMS (≥ 50% score increase from 
baseline) as well as CGI-TD and PGIC (both, rating of 6 
[much worsened] or 7 [very much worsened]). Per the 
approved protocol, this study was not designed to test for 
statistical significance between the valbenazine dose groups, 
partly because participants were allowed 1 dose reduction 
during treatment.
RESULTS
Participants
Of the 205 participants who completed the DBPC 
period, 198 (96.6%) entered the VE period (80 mg/d, n = 101 
[36 from placebo]; 40 mg/d, n = 97 [33 from placebo]) 
(Supplementary eFigure 2). One hundred twenty-four 
(62.6%) participants completed the VE period, and 121 
(61.1%) completed washout and had a follow-up visit at week 
Clinical Points
 
■ Long-term treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) may be 
needed in patients who developed TD while taking an 
antipsychotic medication or other dopamine receptor 
blocking agent.
 
■ Long-term treatment with valbenazine for up to 48 weeks 
was generally well tolerated, and participants continued 
to experience improvements in TD with valbenazine.
 
■ During the 4-week washout phase of valbenazine at 
the end of the study, TD symptoms tended to return to 
baseline, further pointing to the maintenance efficacy of 
ongoing valbenazine treatment for TD.

52. The most common reasons for study discontinuation 
were adverse events (15.7%), withdrawal of consent (8.6%), 
and loss to follow-up (7.1%). Demographic and clinical 
characteristics of participants in the VE period were similar 
between treatment groups (Table 1).
Safety
During the VE period, 69.2% of participants had ≥ 1 
TEAE (Table 2). The only TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation in > 2 participants were somnolence (80 
mg/d, n = 3) and suicidal ideation (80 mg/d, n = 1; 40 
mg/d, n = 2). A description of the 3 participants who were 
discontinued from the study for suicidal ideation, along 
with discontinuations due to suicidal behavior or suicidal 
attempt (1 participant each), is provided in eAppendix 1. 
These cases of suicidal ideation or behavior/attempt all 
resolved with hospitalization/medical management and 
were judged by the site investigators as unlikely related or 
unrelated to valbenazine. Few participants had worsening 
of C-SSRS suicidal ideation (Supplementary eTable 1), 
despite 33.5% (64/191) and 30.4% (58/191) of participants 
having a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior, 
respectively (Table 1).
The incidence of serious TEAEs was 14.6% in the VE 
period. Syncope was the only serious TEAE reported in > 2 
participants (80 mg/d, n = 1; 40 mg/d, n = 2). One death 
occurred in a 59-year-old man (80 mg/d) who experienced 
hyperkalemia, cardiac failure, hepatic failure, diabetes 
mellitus, metabolic acidosis, and pleural effusion. The site 
investigator assessed the death as not related to valbenazine.
During washout (weeks 48 to 52), 16 participants (13.1%) 
experienced a TEAE. The only TEAE reported in ≥ 2 
participants was anxiety (80 and 40 mg/d, n = 1 each). TD 
was not reported as an AE during this period. No participants 
were discontinued during the washout period due to a 
TEAE. Three participants experienced a serious TEAE: 1 
with head injury and limb amputation, 1 with delirium, and 
1 with hypertension; all serious TEAEs were judged by site 
investigators as not related to study medication.
There were no clinically important changes in clinical 
laboratory, vital signs, or ECG parameters during the VE or 
washout periods.
Mean changes from baseline in BARS and SAS scores 
were generally minimal and not clinically significant, 
indicating that valbenazine treatment did not induce or 
worsen akathisia or parkinsonism (Supplementary eTable 2). 
These findings were consistent with the few TEAE reports for 
akathisia (2 participants, both 40 mg/d) and parkinsonism 
(1 participant, 80 mg/d). Mean scores for psychiatric scales 
(PANSS, CDSS, YMRS, MADRS) generally remained stable 
during long-term valbenazine treatment and after washout 
(Supplementary eTable 2).
Efficacy
TD improvement with valbenazine, as measured by 
the AIMS score, was sustained throughout the VE period 
(Figure 1). At week 48, mean changes in AIMS score were 
−4.8 (80 mg/d) and −3.0 (40 mg/d), representing statistically 
significant improvements relative to baseline in both dose 
groups (Figure 1A; P < .001). Similar results were found in 
the analysis based on original DBPC treatment assignment, 
including the groups who were switched from placebo 
to active drug (Figure 1B). At week 48, mean percent 
improvements from baseline in AIMS score were 39.4% 
(80 mg/d) and 23.7% (40 mg/d). AIMS scores increased 
from week 48 to week 52, indicating that TD returned 
toward baseline levels during the 4-week period following 
discontinuation of valbenazine.

J Clin Psychiatry 78:9, November/December 2017
Factor et al 
CGI-TD mean scores demonstrated clinically meaningful global 
improvements during long-term treatment with valbenazine, with lower 
mean scores (ie, more improved) at week 48 (80 mg/d, 2.1; 40 mg/d, 2.4) 
than at week 52 (80 mg/d, 3.5; 40 mg/d, 3.1), suggesting a return toward 
baseline severity of TD during washout (Figure 2). For the PGIC, there was 
a similar pattern of clinical improvement during valbenazine treatment, with 
lower (ie, more improved) mean scores at week 48 (80 mg/d, 2.0; 40 mg/d, 
2.2) than week 52 (80 mg/d, 3.1; 40 mg/d, 2.6).
Response rates during the VE period were generally consistent across 
study visits for AIMS (Figure 3A) and increased steadily across study visits 
for CGI-TD (Figure 3B) and PGIC (Figure 
3C). For AIMS response (≥ 50% score 
improvement from baseline) and CGI-TD 
response (rating of “much improved” or 
“very much improved”), response rates were 
lower after washout (weeks 48 to 52) than 
during the VE period (weeks 8 to 48). For 
PGIC response (rating of “much improved” 
or “very much improved”), the rate was 
lower at week 52 than at weeks 32 and 48. 
Approximately 5% of subjects had > 50% 
worsening in AIMS total score during the VE 
period, although CGI-TD and PGIC scores 
at week 48 indicated that only 1 participant 
was “much worse” or “very much worse” 
(per investigator judgment) after long-term 
treatment (Supplementary eTable 3).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to report the safety 
and effectiveness of long-term valbenazine 
treatment in TD. Results of this extension 
study generally indicated that valbenazine 
was safe and well tolerated, and maintenance 
of treatment effect was apparent for both 
doses (80 and 40 mg/d).
No unexpected TEAEs were found in 
the VE period. The 2 most common were 
headache and urinary tract infection (7.1% 
and 6.6% of all participants, respectively), 
neither of which was dose-related or led to 
premature discontinuation from the study. 
Few participants were discontinued due to 
suicidal ideation (1.5%), suicidal behavior 
(0.5%), or suicidal attempt (0.5%), which 
was consistent with the incidence of serious 
suicidal ideation and behavior (1% each) 
found in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials 
of Intervention Effectiveness study that 
examined the safety and efficacy of various 
antipsychotics in patients with chronic 
schizophrenia.16 In addition, the TEAE 
incidence of any suicidal ideation (5.1% of 
all participants, 5 in each valbenazine dose 
group) and the percentage of participants 
with any worsening from baseline in C-SSRS 
score (6.7%) were similar to the TEAE 
incidence of suicidal ideation in the placebo 
group during the 6-week DBPC period 
(5.3%). Given the fact that approximately 
30% of participants in this study had a 
lifetime history of suicidal ideation and/
or behavior, this 5% incidence of suicidal 
ideation in the long-term valbenazine 
treatment groups was not surprising. As is 
recommended for all patients with increased

aAt week 6 (end of DBPC period), the least squares mean difference between each valbenazine 
group (80 and 40 mg/d) and the placebo group was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures. At week 48 (end of VE period), the difference from baseline was analyzed 
post hoc using 2-sided P values from a 1-sample t test with the last observation carried 
forward. Statistical testing between valbenazine dose groups was not tested. Ns shown in the 
figure represent numbers of participants who had an available assessment at the study visit.
bThree participants in the 80 mg/d group had a dose reduction to 40 mg/d prior to entering the 
VE period. Figure 1A takes this switch into account.

Figure 3. AIMS, CGI-TD, and PGIC Response by Study Visita
aFor AIMS response, CGI-TD response, and PGIC response at week 6, the 
difference between each valbenazine group (80 and 40 mg/d) and 
the placebo group was determined using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel analysis. No statistical testing between valbenazine dose 
groups was conducted for the VE and washout periods.

risk for suicide,17,18 treatment with valbenazine may require 
regular monitoring of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. 
Other VMAT2 inhibitors, tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine, 
carry boxed warnings for depression and suicidality in patients 
with Huntington’s disease.19,20 However, valbenazine is not 
considered to increase the risk of suicidal ideation or behavior 
in patients with TD.21
All participants were deemed psychiatrically stable by the 
site investigator prior to entering KINECT 3. Stable doses of 
concomitant psychiatric medications, including antipsychotics, 
were permitted for management of their psychiatric diagnoses. 
As indicated by mean score changes in the PANSS, CDSS, 
YMRS, and MADRS, the psychiatric status of participants 
generally remained stable during the VE and washout periods, 
indicating that the effects of valbenazine on TD did not 
interfere with the antipsychotic and/or antidepressant effects of 
concomitant medications. Depression was reported as a TEAE 
in 8 participants during the VE period, more commonly in 
the 40 mg/d group (6.2%) than in the 80 mg/d group (2.0%). 
Five of these participants had a primary mood disorder, and 
2 with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder had a history 
of depression. All cases were categorized as mild or moderate, 
and none resulted in premature discontinuation.
Antipsychotic medications have been associated with 
metabolic side effects, ECG and cardiovascular irregularities, 
and treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms,22–24 and 
approximately 85% of participants in KINECT 3 were taking 
at least 1 antipsychotic. Therefore, an important aim of this 
study was to explore whether any of these safety parameters 
worsened during long-term valbenazine treatment. No 
clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital

Factor et al 
consistent with a study of TD (primarily in nonpsychotic 
patients) that found 13% of cases to be reversible after the 
TD-offending medication was discontinued.3 More research, 
however, is needed to better understand the reversibility of 
TD and the potential for symptom remission.
The AIMS analysis of worsening in TD (≥ 50% score 
increase from baseline) showed that some participants did 
not improve during long-term treatment with valbenazine 
(week 48). After the 4-week washout period (week 52), 
however, more participants had demonstrated worsening 
in abnormal movements. Results from the CGI-TD and 
PGIC analyses (score ≥ 6) indicate that in this context of 
an open-label treatment discontinuation at the end of a 
clinical trial, clinician and patient perceptions of worsening 
were corroborated by increases in abnormal involuntary 
movements, as assessed by blinded central video raters using 
the AIMS.
As with most extension studies, interpretation of the 
efficacy results is limited by the absence of a placebo 
control. Interpretation is also limited by the current lack of 
guidelines or standards for clinical relevance (eg, minimal 
clinically important difference for the AIMS; adequate 
thresholds of response for AIMS, CGI-TD, and PGIC) and 
other long-term clinical trials in patients with TD. However, 
a randomized, placebo-controlled, withdrawal study is 
being planned, and the results of this future study should 
provide more definitive information about maintenance of 
treatment effect with valbenazine, as well as loss of effect. 
Results of other ongoing studies (52-week KINECT 4 study 
[NCT02405091], 72-week rollover study [NCT02736955]) 
are also expected to shed more light on the long-term effects 
of valbenazine on TD. Other important topics for future 
research include the time course of treatment response for 
valbenazine; characterization of early responders and time 
to onset of clinically meaningful treatment effect; and the 
effects of stopping, starting, and changing concomitant 
medications (eg, antipsychotics, anticholinergics) during 
real-world treatment with valbenazine.
In conclusion, long-term treatment with once-daily 
valbenazine at 80 or 40 mg/d was generally well tolerated in 
participants with TD regardless of concomitant psychiatric 
medication or underlying psychiatric diagnoses. Results 
indicated that many participants had sustained TD 
improvements during long-term treatment, with some return 
toward baseline severity after valbenazine was discontinued. 
Further research is needed to better understand the long-
term effects of valbenazine on TD and to identify the types of 
patients who might benefit most from this novel medication.

signs, weight, or ECG parameters were found in the VE 
period. Mean changes from baseline in the BARS total 
and SAS global scores, along with the low incidences of 
movement disorder–related TEAEs in all participants 
(dyskinesia, 1.5%; akathisia, 1.0%; parkinsonism, 0.5%; 
extrapyramidal disorder, 0.5%) indicated that valbenazine 
did not aggravate TD or induce other movement disorders.4
The efficacy of valbenazine as compared to placebo was 
demonstrated in the 6-week DBPC period of KINECT 3.14 
The VE period of KINECT 3 did not include a placebo 
group, and the primary aim of the extension period was to 
evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of valbenazine 
in adults with TD. However, mean changes in AIMS score 
during this period indicated that TD improvements were 
sustained. AIMS scores demonstrated significant differences 
at end of treatment (week 48) versus DBPC baseline in both 
dose groups (P < .001) with a clear dose response trend. 
Similar results were found when AIMS score changes were 
analyzed by DBPC treatment assignment (ie, in participants 
switched from placebo and in participants who continued 
on valbenazine). At the follow-up visit that was conducted 
4 weeks after valbenazine washout (week 52), AIMS mean 
scores were found to have increased toward baseline levels, 
suggesting that ongoing valbenazine treatment may be 
required to maintain TD improvements.
Complementary results were found with mean CGI-TD 
and PGIC scores, both of which indicated sustained TD 
improvements during long-term valbenazine treatment 
(week 48) and worsening of TD after valbenazine was 
discontinued (week 52). Both measures suggested a 
progression of improvement over time. Reasons for this 
trend are speculative, but contributing factors may include 
participants dropping out due to lack of efficacy; clinicians 
and participants accounting for factors beyond abnormal 
movements, such as quality of life or improved social 
functioning; clinicians and participants knowing how long 
they had been on valbenazine treatment (as compared to 
central AIMS raters who were blinded to study visit); and 
fewer adverse effects over time (ie, transience of TEAEs). 
It should also be noted that CGI-TD scores were based on 
the qualitative assessment of onsite study investigators who 
were blinded to dose assignment, but not study visit. PGIC 
scores were based on the qualitative assessments of study 
participants. More research is needed to better understand 
how scales like the AIMS might correlate with qualitative or 
global assessments from physicians, patients, and caregivers.
Response analyses for the AIMS (≥ 50% score reduction 
from baseline), as well as for CGI-TD and PGIC (score 
≤ 2 for both measures), were conducted to determine the 
percentage of participants who experienced specific degrees 
of improvement during long-term valbenazine treatment. 
Consistent with analyses based on mean scores, response 
analyses showed sustained improvement during long-
term treatment and a return toward baseline TD severity 
after valbenazine was discontinued. However, 17.4% of 
participants maintained an AIMS response at week 52 (ie, 
4 weeks after treatment was discontinued), which seems

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 
eAppendix 1. Study Discontinuations Due to Suicidal Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt 
Three participants were discontinued from the KINECT 3 extension study due to an adverse 
event of suicidal ideation: a 62-year-old white woman (80 mg/day) with history of depression 
with psychotic features, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior; a 58-year-old black or African-
American man (40 mg/day) with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and comorbid anxiety 
and depression; and a 61-year-old black or African-American woman (40 mg/day) with a mood 
disorder and history of suicidal ideation. Two participants were discontinued due to suicidal 
behavior or aborted suicide attempt: a 36-year-old white man (80 mg/day) with 
schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder who overdosed on clonazepam in an attempt to control 
sexual desires; and a 55-year-old black or African-American woman (80 mg/day) with 
schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and history of intentional overdose who unsuccessfully 
looked for a bridge to jump from after experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. All cases 
were judged by the site investigator as unlikely related or unrelated to valbenazine.

Supplementary eFigure 2. Study Disposition 
 
a Three participants initially randomized to valbenazine 80 mg/day had a dose reduction during 
the 6-week placebo-controlled period and are therefore included in the 40 mg/day group for the 
valbenazine extension period.  
b Attributed to multiple organ failure; judged by Investigator as unrelated to study drug.  
Abbreviations: DBPC, double-blind placebo-controlled; VE, valbenazine extension.
