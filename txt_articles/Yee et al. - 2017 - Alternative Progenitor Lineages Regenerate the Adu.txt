Abstract
An aberrant oxygen environment at birth increases the severity of
respiratory viral infections later in life through poorly understood
mechanisms. Here, we show that alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) 2 cells
(AEC2s), progenitors for AEC1 cells, are depleted in adult mice exposed
to neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia. Airway cells expressing surfactant
protein (SP)-C and ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 3,
alveolar pod cells expressing keratin (KRT) 5, and pulmonary fibrosis
were observed when these mice were infected with a sublethal dose of
HKx31, H3N2 influenza A virus. This was not seen in infected siblings
birthed into room air. Genetic lineage tracing studies in mice exposed to
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia revealed pre-existing secretoglobin 1a11
cells produced airway cells expressing SP-C and ATP binding cassette
subfamily A member 3. Pre-existing Kr51 progenitor cells produced
squamous alveolar cells expressing receptor for advanced glycation
endproducts, aquaporin 5, and T1a in alveoli devoid of AEC2s. They
were not the source of KRT51 alveolar pod cells. These oxygen-
dependent changes in epithelial cell regeneration and fibrosis could be
recapitulatedbyconditionallydepletingAEC2sinmiceusingdiphtheriaA
toxin and then infecting with influenza A virus. Likewise, airway cells
expressing SP-C and alveolar cells expressing KRT5 were observed in
human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These findings suggest that
alternative progenitor lineages are mobilized to regenerate the alveolar
epithelium when AEC2s are severely injured or depleted by previous
insults, such as an adverse oxygen environment at birth. Because these
lineages regenerate AECs in spatially distinct compartments of a lung
undergoing fibrosis, they may not be sufficient to prevent disease.

Clinical Relevance
It is unclear why exposure to low or high amounts of oxygen at
birth increases risk of severe respiratory viral infections later in
life. This study uses mice to show how alternative progenitor
lineages are recruited to repair the respiratory epithelium of
infected mice, the alveolar type II cells of which are depleted by
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia. Because these lineages were
seen in fibrotic lungs, they may not be sufficient to properly
regenerate the injured lung and prevent respiratory morbidity.

453
 Respiratory viral infections can cause
significant pulmonary morbidity and
mortality in susceptible individuals,
including children and the elderly. Growing
evidence indicates that children born
preterm are especially vulnerable to
pulmonary infections (1, 2). Preterm infants
face a 3.6-fold increase in their risk of being
rehospitalized during the first year of life
when infected with respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) (3). Although RSV infections
are the primary cause of readmission (4),
increased morbidity has also been
reported for rhinovirus, human bocavirus,
metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza
virus (5, 6). Children born with cyanotic
congenital heart failure or at high altitude
also have an increased risk of severe
respiratory morbidity after a viral infection.
For example, the odds ratio of being
readmitted for RSV-specific infections
increases 25% among infants younger than
1 year and 50% among children between
ages 1 and 4 years who were living above
2,500 m (1.5 miles) (7). Because children
born preterm are often exposed to excess
oxygen and children born at high altitude
are exposed to less oxygen, an aberrant
oxygen environment at birth may influence
the severity of pulmonary morbidity after
a respiratory viral infection later in life.
We have been using mice to
understand how high oxygen (hyperoxia)
exposure at birth alters lung epithelial
development and changes the response to
influenza A virus (IAV) later in life. In this
model, newborn mice are exposed to room
air or hyperoxia (100% oxygen) between
Postnatal Days (PNDs) 0 and 4. This time
period of oxygen exposure represents the
saccular phase of lung development in mice,
which parallels the developmental stage
when many preterm humans are born. At
8 weeks of age, mild airway hyperreactivity
and alveolar simplification is seen in mice
exposed to neonatal hyperoxia (8–10).
Persistent inflammation and fibrotic lung
disease is seen after these mice are infected
with a sublethal dose of IAV (HKx31,
H3N2) (11, 12). Because this is not seen
in infected siblings exposed to room air
at birth, neonatal hyperoxia may have
disrupted or altered stem cells needed to
properly regenerate the injured lung.
Consistent with this hypothesis, adult
mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia have
significantly fewer alveolar epithelial cell
(AEC) 2 cells (AEC2s) than their siblings
that were birthed into room air (9). This
prompted us to investigate how the oxygen
environment at birth influences postnatal
expansion of AEC2s. By varying the
amount of oxygen at birth, we discovered
that exposure to 12% oxygen (hypoxia) or
60% or greater oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth
stimulates expansion of AEC2s through
both self-renewal and differentiation of
secretoglobin (Scgb) 1a11 progenitor cells
(13). AEC2s expanded during hyperoxia are
slowly depleted when mice are returned to
room air (14). Whether AEC2s expanded
during hypoxia are also depleted during
recovery in room air remains to be
determined.
A reduced number of AEC2s in mice
exposed to an aberrant oxygen environment
at birth could affect how the lung responds
to viral infection or other agents that
damage the alveolar epithelium. AEC2s
express surfactant phospholipids and
proteins that reduce surface tension
along the alveolar surface. They defend
against bacterial and viral infections by
expressing the collectins, surfactant protein
(SP)-A and SP-D, eosinophil-associated
RNAse 1, and many other host defense
molecules, including IFN-g, several CXCL
chemokines, and IL-29 (15–18). AEC2s also
function as adult stem cells capable of both
self-renewal and differentiation into AEC1s
(19). However, AEC1s and AEC2s are also
targets of IAV, and may die during
infection (20, 21). This raises the question
of how AECs are replenished when AEC2s
are depleted or excessively injured, such as
when infected by virus. Genetic lineage
studies using Scgb1a1-rtTA or Scgb1a1-
CreER driver mice indicate that airway
Club cells can serve as progenitors for
AEC2s after infection with IAV or exposure
to bleomycin (19, 22, 23). AECs may also
derive from a small number of epithelial
cells expressing the laminin receptor a6b4
(24). Epithelial cells expressing p63 and
keratin (KRT) 5 have been detected in
alveolar pod structures of mice infected
with a highly pathogenic strain of
IAV (PR8, H1N1) (25). Single-cell
transplantation studies suggest that Krt51
progenitors can regenerate AEC1s and
AEC2s (26). On the other hand, genetic
lineage tracings suggest that KRT51 cells
derive from a lineage-negative epithelial
progenitor cell that rarely produces mature
epithelium unless Notch signaling is inhibited
(27, 28). Hence, there is great interest in
identifying the source of KRT51 cells and
their role in regenerating the injured lung.
Here, we use genetic lineage labeling
and cell depletion studies to investigate how
the oxygen-dependent loss of AEC2s
influences lung regeneration after infection
with IAV. We chose to use HKx31, H3N2
because it is a weak strain of IAV that does
not cause significant morbidity or mortality
in mice exposed to room air (21, 29). We
provide evidence that alternative progenitor
lineages regenerate the alveolar epithelium
when AEC2s are depleted by early-life
oxygen exposures. However, they
unexpectedly fail to restore normal
airway and alveolar epithelial architecture,
implying that this alternative form of
epithelial regeneration is not wholly
effective in preventing fibrotic lung disease.
Our findings help explain how AEC2
injury, or depletion by an early-life insult,
such as an adverse oxygen environment at
birth, might increase the severity of
respiratory viral infections.
Materials and Methods
Additional details for these procedures may
be found in the online supplement.
Mice
Sftpc-CreER mice (23) were supplied by
B. Hogan (Duke University, Durham, NC),
and Scgb1a1-CreER (30), Rosa26R-mT/mG
(31), Rosa26R-StopDTA (32), and Krt5-
CreER (33) mice were purchased from the
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All
studies with mice were performed under
Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines that were reviewed
and approved by the University Committee
on Animal Resources at the University of
Rochester (Rochester, NY).
Oxygen Exposures
Newborn mice were exposed to 12% oxygen
(hypoxia) or 100% oxygen (hyperoxia) as
previously described (8, 13). Littermates
that were maintained in 21% oxygen (room
air) served as controls for all experiments.
IAV Infection and Administration of
Bleomycin
Adult mice were infected intranasally with
120 hemagglutinating units of IAV (strain
HKx31, H3N2) in 25 ml saline (11, 34).
Bleomycin (2.5 U/kg) in 50 ml of PBS was
administered to adult mice by tracheal
instillation (35). Lungs were removed
before treatment and on Post-treatment

 Days 5, 14, 21, or 28. The right lobes were
fixed and processed for histology. The left
lobe was used to assess total soluble
collagen levels using a Sircol collagen
assay kit (Bicolor, Belfast, UK).
Conditional Activation of Genes Using
Tamoxifen
Corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was
sterilized using a steriflip vacuum-assisted
filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
Tamoxifen (T5648; Sigma-Aldrich) was
dissolved in filter-sterilized corn oil to make
solutions of 20 mg/ml.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Lung tissues were inflation fixed overnight
in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded
in paraffin, sectioned, and stained as
described previously (8, 9). Sections were
stained with antibodies against proSP-C or
ATP binding cassette subfamily A member
3 (ABCA3) (Seven Hills Bioreagents,
Cincinnati, OH), T1a (Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA),
enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP),
KRT5, and aquaporin (AQP5) (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), Scgb1a1 (Millipore and
B. Stripp, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los
Angeles, CA), receptor for advanced glycation
endproducts (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN), and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA;
Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were incubated with
fluorescently labeled secondary antibody
(Jackson Immune Research, West Grove, PA),
stained with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA),
and positive cells quantified as previously
described (9). Collagen was detected using
Gomori’s trichrome stain kit (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Sections were
examined and photographed using a Nikon
E800 fluorescence microscope (Microvideo
Instruments, Avon, MA) and a SPOT-RT
digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments,
Sterling Heights, MI).
Ultrastructural Studies
Lungs were inflation fixed overnight at 48C
using 0.1 M sodium cacodylate-buffered
2.5% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde,
postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and
embedded in EPON/Araldite epoxy resin.
Sections were stained with Toluidine blue
to identify terminal airway, and then
stained with aqueous uranyl acetate and
lead citrate before examining on a Hitachi
7,650 Transmission Electron Microscope
(Hitachi High-Technologies Group,
Clarksburg, MD) with an attached Gatan
Erlangshen 11-megapixel digital camera
(Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA).
Human Lung Tissues
Paraffin-embedded human lung tissue
sections were stained after histopathological
confirmation that the tissue was healthy
or was consistent with usual interstitial
pneumonia, the pathology associated with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The
medical records were reviewed to exclude
secondary causes of fibrosis. Biopsies were
reviewed and approved by the University of
Rochester’s Office for Human Subject
Protection.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using JMP11 software
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and graphed as
means (6SEM). A two-way ANOVA was
used to determine overall significance,
followed by Tukey-Kramer honest
significance test.
Results
The Oxygen Environment at Birth
Alters Regeneration of the Adult Lung
Adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia
between PNDs 0 and 4 develop pulmonary
fibrosis when infected with IAV (HKx31,
H3N2), whereas infected siblings exposed
to room air do not (11). We investigated
whether birth into low oxygen also promotes
fibrotic lung disease after infection. Adult
mice exposed to 12% (hypoxia), 21% (room
air), or 100% (hyperoxia) oxygen between
PNDs 0 and 4 were infected with IAV
(Figure 1A). Pulmonary fibrosis was not seen
in any mice before infection (data not
shown). It was also not seen in room air
mice infected with IAV. In contrast,
increased soluble collagen and fibrotic lung
disease were observed on Postinfection Day
14 in lungs of adult mice exposed to neonatal
hypoxia or hyperoxia (Figures 1B and 1C).
KRT51 cells are found in alveolar pods
of mice infected with IAV (PR8, H1N1)
(25–27). We investigated whether they were
also present in mice infected with IAV
(HKx31, H3N2). KRT51 cells were not seen
in distal lungs of any mice before infection
(data not shown). They were also not seen
after room air mice were infected with IAV.
In contrast, KRT51 cells were detected on
Postinfection Day 14 in distal airway and
alveolar pod cells of adult mice exposed to
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia (Figure 1D).
Alveolar KRT51 cells were often found
adjacent to a-SMA1 myofibroblasts. KRT51
cells were initially detected around
Postinfection Day 5, peaking in abundance
around Postinfection Day 14, and declining
by Postinfection Day 28 (see Figure E1 in
the online supplement). We also observed
clusters of SP-C1 and ABCA31 cells in the
distal airways of these mice (Figure 1E).
Approximately 60% of airways within the
lung lobe contained these cells, and they
comprised 30% of cells seen in that region.
SP-C1 airways were often found adjacent
to or terminating in alveoli that were
hypercellular and laden with myofibroblasts.
Airway cells containing lipid-laden
intracellular inclusion bodies, similar to
lamellar bodies of AEC2s, were also detected
by transmission electron microscopy
(Figure 1F). Airway cells expressing SP-C
or ABCA3 were not seen in infected mice
exposed to room air at birth.
To determine whether these changes in
epithelial regeneration were specific for IAV,
mice were administered bleomycin, because
it is a profibrotic chemotherapeutic and
because neonatal hyperoxia enhances its
profibrotic effects in the lung (35). Relative
to room air, neonatal hypoxia and
hyperoxia increased bleomycin-induced
lung fibrosis and levels of soluble collagen
(Figure E2). Although airway cells
expressing SP-C (data not shown) and
KRT51 cells were detected adjacent to
a-SMA1 myofibroblasts in mice
administered bleomycin (Figure E2C), they
were more prevalent in mice exposed to
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia. Taken
together, these results using IAV and
bleomycin show that neonatal hypoxia or
hyperoxia disrupts lung regeneration, as
defined by the presence of airway AEC2-
like cells containing lamellar bodies and
expressing SP-C and ABCA3, presence
of KRT51 cells underlying distal airway
epithelium and in alveolar pod cells, and
the development of fibrotic lung disease.
Conditional Depletion of AEC2s Alters
Alveolar Regeneration in the Adult
Lung
Neonatal hyperoxia stimulates proliferation
of AEC2s that are slowly depleted when
the mice are returned to room air (14).
Because neonatal hypoxia also stimulates
proliferation of AEC2s (13), we investigated
whether excess AEC2s were also depleted
during recovery in room air. The

 proportion of SP-C1 to all DAPI1 cells was
quantified in lungs of adult mice exposed to
12%, 21% (room air), or 100% oxygen at
birth (Figure 2). Adult mice exposed to
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia had roughly
50% fewer SP-C1 alveolar cells than
siblings exposed to room air (Figures 2B
and 2C). This reflects a loss of AEC2s for
several reasons. First, flow cytometry
confirmed that the percent of EGFP1 cells
present in Sftpc-EGFP transgenic mice was
reduced by neonatal hyperoxia (data not
shown). Second, neonatal hyperoxia does
not increase the number of immune cells
recruited to the lung before infection (11).
Third, genetic lineage studies confirmed
that adult mice exposed to neonatal
hyperoxia have fewer AEC2s than siblings
exposed to room air (13, 14). Hence, the
number of AEC2s present in adult lung is
influenced by a U-shaped or hormesis
response to oxygen levels at birth.
To determine how the oxygen-
dependent depletion of AEC2s affects adult
lung regeneration after IAV infection, an
equivalent number of AEC2s was depleted
by overexpressing the diphtheria A toxin
gene under conditional control of the Sftpc
promoter. Adult Sftpc-CreER; Rosa26R-
StopDTA mice were administered
tamoxifen once daily for 1, 2, 3, or 4 days
(Figure 2D). Lungs were harvested on the
seventh day and the proportion of SPC1
to DAPI1 cells was determined by
immunohistochemistry. When compared
with control mice exposed to room air, the
number of SP-C1 AEC2s was modestly
diminished by one dose of tamoxifen
and approximately 50% by two doses
(Figures 2E and 2F). Three doses of
tamoxifen reduced the number of alveolar
SP-C1 cells by roughly 70%; however,
SP-C1 cells were now detected in the distal
airway (Figure 2F). Airway cells expressing
SP-C also expressed ABCA3, but not

 KRT5 (data not shown). Four doses of
tamoxifen were often fatal. Hence, two
doses of tamoxifen were sufficient to reduce
the number of alveolar AEC2s similar to
levels seen in adult mice exposed to
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia.
To investigate how the loss of AEC2s
influences the response to IAV, adult
Sftpc-CreER; Rosa26R-StopDTA mice were
administered tamoxifen once a day for
two consecutive days or corn oil vehicle as
control (Figure 3A); 5 days later, lungs were
harvested from some mice and the rest
were infected with IAV. Before infection
(Day 0), soluble levels of collagen were
low and not different between mice
administered two doses of tamoxifen or
corn oil (Figure 3B). In contrast, increased
collagen was detected on Postinfection Day
14 in mice administered tamoxifen.
Collagen levels were not significantly
increased in infected mice administered
corn oil vehicle (Figures 3A and 3B).
KRT51 cells were also detected in airway
and alveoli of infected mice administered
two or three doses of tamoxifen, but not in
mice administered one dose of tamoxifen or
corn oil vehicle (Figure 3C). Although
airway SP-C1 cells were not seen with two
doses of tamoxifen, they were now seen
after mice administered two doses of
tamoxifen were infected with IAV
(Figure 3D). Some of these cells
expressed SCGB1A1.
As a control, we investigated whether
depletion of airway Club cells affected distal
lung regeneration after IAV infection.
Scgb1a1-CreER; Rosa26R-StopDTA mice
were administered two doses of tamoxifen
or corn oil vehicle control, followed by
5 days of recovery (Figure E3). As expected,
airway cells expressing SCGB1A1 were
partially depleted in mice administered
tamoxifen, but not vehicle control.
Increased collagen and lung fibrosis was
not seen in mice before or after infection
with IAV.
SP-C1 Airway Cells Derive from the
Scgb1a11 Lineage
Because airway SCGB1A11 progenitor cells
can self-renew and differentiate into AEC2s
(22, 23, 36, 37), we investigated whether
they were progenitors of airway AEC2-like
cells found in infected mice exposed to
neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia. Scgb1a1-
CreER; Rosa26R-mT/mG mice were
exposed to 12%, 21% (room air), or 100%
oxygen at birth and then administered four
doses of tamoxifen, followed by 3 days of
recovery as adults (Figure 4A). We first
confirmed that the oxygen environment at
birth did not influence the labeling index of

 SCGB1A11 cells by staining and counting
the percent of cells expressing EGFP and
SCGB1A1 (Figure E4A). We also confirmed
that EGFP derived from the Scgb1a11
lineage was detected in a small number of
SP-C1 cells present at the bronchoalveolar
junction, consistent with bronchoalveolar
stem cells (BASCs). Additional mice were
then infected with IAV. On Postinfection
Day 14, EGFP was detected in most airway
cells of mice exposed to room air and
approximately 50% of airways of mice
exposed to neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia
(Figure 4B). EGFP was also detected in
airway SP-C1 cells of infected mice exposed
to neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia,
suggesting that airway AEC2-like cells
derive from pre-existing Scgb1a11
progenitors (Figure 4C). Airway cells
expressing EGFP did not express KRT5
(Figure 4D). Interestingly, EGFP2 cells that
expressed SCGB1A1 were also seen in
infected mice exposed to neonatal hypoxia
or hyperoxia (Figure 4B). These cells did
not express SP-C or KRT, implying that
they are Club cells derived from a
non–lineage-labeled progenitor cell that
survived infection.
Genetic Lineage Studies Were also

Sftpc-CreER; Rosa26R-mT/mG mice were
exposed to 12%, 21% (room air), or 100%
oxygen at birth and then administered four
doses of tamoxifen, followed by 3 days
of recovery as adults (Figure 5A). We
confirmed that neonatal hypoxia and
hyperoxia does not alter the high labeling
index of AEC2s by counting the proportion
of EGFP1 cells expressing SP-C (Figure
E4B). However, BACSs were not labeled,
because we were unable to detect EGFP in
SCGB1A11 cells at the bronchoalveolar
junction. Additional mice were then
infected with IAV. On Postinfection Day
14, EGFP derived from the SP-C lineage
was detected in cuboidal SP-C1 alveolar
cells of all mice (Figure 5B). It was also
detected in thin squamous cells that express
T1a, with the greatest amount seen in
infected mice exposed to neonatal hypoxia
or hyperoxia (Figure 5C). EGFP derived
from the Sftpc1 lineage was never detected
in KRT51 cells present in infected mice
exposed to neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia
(Figure 5D). It was also never detected in
airway SP-C1 cells (Figure E5A). However,
SP-C1 airway cells could be effectively
labeled with EGFP by administering
tamoxifen on Postinfection Days 9–12
when airway cells express SP-C
(Figure E5B).
Krt51 Cells Regenerate AEC1 in
Alveoli Devoid of AEC2s
Because pre-existing Scgb1a11 and SP-C1
cells do not generate KRT51 cells, genetic
lineage studies were used to determine if
Krt51 progenitor cells generate SCGB1A11
or SP-C1 cells. Krt5-CreER; Rosa26R-
mT/mG mice were exposed to 12%, 21%
(room air), or 100% oxygen at birth and
then administered four doses of tamoxifen,
followed by 3 days of recovery as adults
(Figure 6A). Before infection, EGFP derived
from the Krt51 lineage was detected
uniformly in KRT51 basal cells of all mice,
regardless of oxygen exposure (Figure
E6A). Although EGFP was not detected in
alveolar cells before infection, it was readily
detected after infection in squamous cells of
mice exposed to neonatal hypoxia or
hyperoxia (Figure E6B). Interestingly,
EGFP was not detected in alveolar pod cells
expressing KRT5 (Figure E6C). Instead,

 EGFP was detected in alveolar cells
expressing RAGE, AQP5, and T1a, but not
SP-C (Figures 6B–6E). Close examination
revealed that EGFP derived from Krt51
lineage was predominantly seen in alveoli
severely deficient or completely devoid of
SP-C1 AEC2s.
Airway SP-C1 and KRT51 Cells Are
Present in Human Idiopathic Lung
Fibrosis
Because human idiopathic and familial
forms of pulmonary fibrosis have been
linked to AEC2 dysfunction (38), we
investigated whether aspects of the altered
epithelial regeneration observed in mice
born into an aberrant oxygen environment
were evident in humans with IPF.
Analogous to the findings in mice, KRT51
cells were found in IPF, but not healthy
lung near fibroblast-rich regions expressing
a-SMA (Figure E7). Likewise, SP-C1 cells
were found lining the airspace of IPF
samples, with an occasional positive cell
present in underlying fibroblast-rich
regions. These regions represent remodeled
airway, because SP-C1 cells were found
among SCGB1A11 cells.
Discussion
Mechanisms by which exposure to hypoxia
or hyperoxia at birth increase the risk
of severe respiratory morbidity and
hospitalization of children infected with a
respiratory virus are not well understood.
Here, we show that neonatal hypoxia or
hyperoxia at birth depletes AEC2s by
approximately 50% in adult mice (Figure 7).
Although the oxygen-dependent depletion
of these cells by itself was not sufficient to
cause significant pulmonary disease, it
sensitized the mice to develop fibrotic lung
disease after infection with IAV or
bleomycin. Genetic lineage mapping and
conditional depletion studies revealed how
alternative progenitor lineages were
recruited to replace the lost regenerative
functions of AEC2s. Scgb1a11 progenitors,
presumably pre-existing airway Club cells,
regenerated SP-C1 AEC2-like cells in the
distal airway. A Krt51 progenitor
regenerated squamous AEC1-like cells
expressing RAGE, AQP5, and T1a in
alveoli that were relatively devoid of SP-C1
cells. Interestingly, a nonlabeled progenitor
produced alveolar KRT51 pod cells. We
found no evidence that the Krt51 lineage
contributes to airway or alveolar cells
expressing SP-C. Presumably, generation of
alveoli devoid of AEC2s causes alveolar
collapse and progression to fibrotic lung
disease. Supporting this idea, airway SP-C1
and alveolar KRT51 cells were seen in lung
biopsies of human IPF. Collectively, these
findings suggest that alternative progenitor
lineages for AEC2s can effectively restore
AECs in the short term, but not a normal
healthy lung in the long term. Our findings
help explain how an aberrant oxygen
environment at birth might increase the
severity of respiratory viral infections later
in life.

 Growing evidence indicates that the
lung contains region-specific stem and
progenitor cell niches that serve to protect
and maintain proper lung function (39).
Genetic lineage tracing and 3H-thymidine
labeling studies indicate that AEC2s are
long-lived adult stem cells with a half-life of
1 month or more (19, 40). This low rate
of turnover suggests that the total number
of AEC2s present in the adult lung may be
modified by fetal and postnatal influences
on the developing lung. We recently
showed how exposure to neonatal hypoxia
or hyperoxia at birth stimulates expansion
of AEC2s through both self-renewal and
differentiation of the airway Scgb1a11
lineage (13). AEC2s expanded during
neonatal hyperoxia were slowly depleted
when mice were returned to room air,
resulting in an adult lung containing
approximately 50% fewer AEC2s than
normal (9, 13). Although mild alveolar
simplification and increased compliance
was seen in these mice, it was not severe
enough by itself to perturb surfactant
biophysical activity, or cause respiratory
distress or lung disease (8). In the current
study, we provide evidence that adult mice
exposed to neonatal hypoxia (12% oxygen)
also had approximately 50% fewer AEC2s
than siblings exposed to room air. Although
mild alveolar simplification was again seen,
interestingly, a 50% reduction in the
number of AEC2s still did not cause
obvious lung disease. Likewise, significant
lung disease was not seen when the number
of SP-C1 AEC2s was reduced by 50% using
Sftpc-CreER; Rosa26R-StopDTA mice.
Increasing the dose of tamoxifen caused
greater depletion of AEC2s and mortality of
mice, but still did not cause significant lung
scarring. Other investigators using the same
mice and similar doses of tamoxifen also
reported minimal changes in lung
architecture at 2, 4, 7 and 21 days after
treatment (19). In contrast, pulmonary
fibrosis was seen when transgenic mice
expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor in
AEC2s were administered diphtheria toxin
protein (41). Pulmonary fibrosis was also
seen when gancyclovir was administered to
mice expressing thymidine kinase in AEC2s
(42). Why some models of AEC2 depletion
cause lung pathology and others do not is
presently unknown.
Our findings demonstrate that pre-
existing Scgb1a11 cells produce AEC2-like

 airway cells when alveolar AEC2s are
injured or depleted. AEC2-like airway cells
expressing SP-C or ABCA3 are not detected
when AEC2s are depleted by approximately
50% using neonatal hypoxia and hyperoxia
or conditional depletion of diphtheria toxin
fragment A. They are detected when mice
exposed to neonatal hypoxia or hyperoxia
are infected with IAV or when AEC2s are
depleted below 50% using diphtheria A
toxin. Because AEC2s can be infected by
IAV and may die during infection (43, 44),
neonatal hypoxia and hyperoxia may
reduce the number of AEC2s close to a
threshold where further loss by the virus
activates Scgb1a11 progenitors to produce
airway AEC2-like cells. Whether airway
AEC2-like cells are derived from Scgb1a11
Club cells or Scgb1a11 BASCs remains to
be determined. BASCs are progenitor cells
found at the bronchoalveolar junction that
express both SCGB1A1 and SP-C (37).
Although we were able to label BASCs
using Scgb1a1-CreER mice, we were not
able to label them with Sftpc-CreER mice.
However, we speculate that airway AEC2-
like cells are not derived from BASCs,
because they do not reside solely near the
bronchoalveolar junction. The mouse
models used in our study could not be used
to determine if airway AEC2-like cells
migrate and replenish AEC2s in the
alveolar space. The Sftpc-CreER mouse
would not be able to distinguish between
resident alveolar SP-C1 cells from those
that migrated from the airway. The
Scgb1a1-CreER mouse would also not be
able to distinguish between the two types of
SP-C1 cells, because it expresses reporter
genes in approximately 10% of AEC2s
before infection (30). Regardless, airway
SP-C1 cells may represent a transient
population that eventually dies,
differentiates into another cell type, or
migrates out of the airway, because they are
not easily seen 6 months after infection
even though lung scarring is still evident
(data not shown).
Our research also found that KRT51
cells present in the distal lung after the
number of AEC2s falls below 50%. KRT51
cells were only seen in the distal lung of
infected mice, the AEC2s of which were
depleted by 50% using neonatal hypoxia or
hyperoxia, or by conditional depletion
with diphtheria A toxin. They were also
seen in uninfected mice, but only after
AEC2s were severely depleted below 50%.
Together, this implies alveolar KRT51 cells
are present when the severity of injury to
AEC2s causes more than 50% loss. KRT51
cells have been detected in pod-like
structures of mice infected with a highly
pathogenic strain of IAV (PR8, H1N1) (25),
and can produce some AEC1s and AEC2s
when expanded ex vivo and transplanted in
mice that are then infected (26). It is
unclear why PR8 is so much more
pathogenic than HKx31. It is widely
accepted that PR8 infects distal alveolar
cells, whereas HKx31 primarily infects
upper airways (29, 45–48). PR8 also does
not infect or produce virus from
macrophages, whereas HKx31 can infect
macrophages; however, this is not a
productive infection. Hypothetically,
oxygen-dependent depletion of AEC2s
makes HKx31 act more like PR8, as defined
by presence of KRT51 alveolar pod
structures and regeneration of AEC1s via a
Krt51 lineage. Our studies did not address
how KRT51 cells are recruited to the
injured lung. However, it is interesting to
note that EGFP derived from the Krt51
lineage labeled before infection overlapped
strongly with squamous alveolar cells
expressing RAGE, AQP5, and T1a, but
not KRT5. This suggests that KRT51
progenitor cells, perhaps from basal cells
of the trachea, home to the alveolar space
during infection, where they differentiate
into AEC1s. This conclusion supports
prior findings that distal airway Krt51
progenitors can regenerate AECs when
transplanted into infected lungs (26). On
the other hand, we found that alveolar
KRT51 pod cells present in the distal
lung are not derived from a lineage-
labeled Krt51 progenitor. This conclusion
is consistent with another study showing
that the KRT51 pod cells present in
the distal lung derive from a currently
unknown lineage-negative progenitor
cell (27, 28). In these studies, inhibition
of Notch signaling was required for
lineage-labeled Krt51 cells to regenerate
mature epithelium. Our findings,
therefore, suggest that the loss of AEC2s
mobilizes pre-existing Krt51 cells to
regenerate some AEC1s, but not AEC2s,
whereas a non–lineage-labeled progenitor
produces KRT51 alveolar pod cells,
the functions of which remain to be
determined.
The idea that fibrotic lung disease is
caused by epithelial injury and dysregulated
repair by AEC2s was first proposed in 1979
by Haschek and Witschi (49). Numerous
studies since then have demonstrated the
importance of AEC2s in maintaining distal
lung homeostasis, in part by serving as an
adult stem cell for itself and AEC1s.

infection. Surviving airway Club cells regenerate new Club cells, whereas AEC2s regenerate both new
AEC2s and AEC1s (black arrows). Alternative progenitors that serve to replace the progenitor
functions of AEC2s are recruited when AEC2s are excessively depleted below 50% (red arrows).
Airway AEC2-like cells are now regenerated from an airway Scgb1a11 lineage, whereas AEC1-like
cells are regenerated by a Krt51 lineage of progenitors that do not produce alveolar Krt51 pod cells.
Hypothetically, alveolar collapse and myofibroblast expansion occurs when cellularity of distal airway
and alveoli is not properly restored.

 repair was influenced by excessive injury
to AEC2s is not known. Here, we took
advantage of a weak strain of IAV that
causes minimal distal lung disease to show
how alternative progenitor lineages used to
replace injured AECs were activated when
AEC2s were depleted by an aberrant
oxygen environment at birth or expression
of diphtheria A toxin gene. Although these
lineages successfully regenerated AEC1-
and AEC2-like cells, they occurred in
spatially distinct regions of the lung and
were unable to prevent progression to
fibrotic lung disease. Recruitment of
alternative lineages seen in neonatal oxygen
and viral infections may have broader
implications to the pathogenesis of lung
fibrosis, because similar findings were
seen when oxygen-exposed mice were
administered bleomycin. Likewise, SP-C1
airway cells and alveolar KRT51 cells
among a-SMA1 myofibroblasts were seen
in human IPF. Preserving AEC2s against
excessive injury or early-life insults, such
as an adverse oxygen environment at
birth, may therefore be more effective at
limiting respiratory morbidity than
relying on the recruitment of alternative
progenitor cell lineages to repair the
injured lung. n
