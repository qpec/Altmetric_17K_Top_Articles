Studying complexity in health services
research: desperately seeking an overdue
paradigm shift

Abstract
Complexity is much talked about but sub-optimally studied in health services research. Although the significance of
the complex system as an analytic lens is increasingly recognised, many researchers are still using methods that
assume a closed system in which predictive studies in general, and controlled experiments in particular, are
possible and preferred. We argue that in open systems characterised by dynamically changing inter-relationships
and tensions, conventional research designs predicated on linearity and predictability must be augmented by the
study of how we can best deal with uncertainty, unpredictability and emergent causality. Accordingly, the study of
complexity in health services and systems requires new standards of research quality, namely (for example) rich
theorising, generative learning, and pragmatic adaptation to changing contexts. This framing of complexity-
informed health services research provides a backdrop for a new collection of empirical studies. Each of the initial
five papers in this collection illustrates, in different ways, the value of theoretically grounded, methodologically
pluralistic, flexible and adaptive study designs. We propose an agenda for future research and invite researchers to
contribute to this on-going series.
Keywords: Complexity, Systems thinking, Methodology, Healthcare
Introduction
Medicine’s interest in complexity has, to date, been
largely superficial, both theoretically and empirically. It
is fashionable to talk of complex interventions, complex
systems, complex patients, wicked problems, and the
like. However, with few exceptions, we embrace the
theme of complexity in name only and fail to engage
with its underlying logic.
In 2001, Plsek and Greenhalgh edited a series of
articles in the British Medical Journal, introducing the
topic of complexity [1] and applied complexity principles
to clinical care [2], leadership and management [3] and
lifelong learning [4]. That series was extensively cited,
yet the paradigm shift it heralded did not happen.
Contemporary healthcare is experiencing several im-
portant challenges, including a mismatch between the
‘patient in the guideline’ and the ‘patient in the bed’ due
to multi-morbidity and interacting sociocultural influ-
ences; an inability for ‘marginalised’ patients to access
GP services despite the super-science miracle cures ubi-
quitous in the media; new staff roles, organisational
forms and technologies that sometimes seem to worsen
the very problems they were introduced to solve; and
the policy sacred cow of integrated care repeatedly prov-
ing impossible to deliver in practice. As these challenges
become ever more pressing, it is time to revisit the ori-
ginal question asked by the 2001 British Medical Journal
series: “What is complexity and what are its implications
for clinical practice, research, service organisation and
professional education?”
Today, we launch a new series inspired by an inter-
national workshop “We Need to Talk about Complexity”
held in Oxford, UK, in June 2017 [5], which prompted
an open call for papers by BMC Medicine [6]. The series
begins with five papers [7–11], and more will be added
in the future. We hope that this new series will (1) ex-
plain what complexity thinking is and how it challenges

 some of the deeply-held assumptions held by the med-
ical community about how the world works; (2) illustrate
how complexity-informed research and scholarship can
provide insights and ways forward for some of medi-
cine’s most intractable problems; and (3) outline a future
research agenda for the study of complexity in medicine
and healthcare.
Complexity and complex systems
Complexity is described as “a dynamic and constantly
emerging set of processes and objects that not only interact
with each other, but come to be defined by those interac-
tions” [12]. Complex systems have fuzzy boundaries; their
interacting agents operate on the basis of internal rules
that cannot always be predicted; and they adapt, interact
and co-evolve with other systems [1, 13, 14]. Crucially,
complexity is a feature of the system(s), not merely a
characteristic of interventions [15, 16]. Indeed, whether an
intervention is simple (one active component, unchan-
ging) or complex (multiple interacting components), the
‘system’ in which the intervention is implemented will
almost invariably need to adapt in some way to accommo-
date it [15, 16]. Often, a planned intervention (e.g. a
multi-component public health programme that aims to
prevent type 2 diabetes) and its context (e.g. a deprived,
multi-ethnic inner city community with limited leisure
facilities, multiple fast-food and street-food outlets, and a
variety of existing faith-based community support pro-
grammes) will be inter-related and reciprocally interacting
– the dancer and the dance are intertwined.
Other, less widely discussed, features of complexity are
highly relevant to the study of health services and
systems. The world moves quickly; baselines shift; tech-
nologies crash; actions are (variously) constrained; and
certainty is elusive. The gap between the evidence-based
ideal and the political and material realities of the
here-and-now may be wide. Decisions must be made on
the basis of incomplete or contested data. People use
their creativity and generate adaptive solutions that
make sense locally. The articulations, workarounds and
muddling-through that keep the show on the road are
not footnotes in the story, but its central plot. They
should be carefully studied and represented in all their
richness.
These core characteristics of complex systems suggest
that the randomised controlled trial (in which the effects
of context are ‘controlled for’) will address only a frac-
tion of the unanswered questions relating to healthcare
organisations and systems [12, 13, 17]. Because the
system is dynamic (turbulent, even), the conventional
scientific quest for certainty, predictability and linear
causality must be augmented by the study of how we
can best deal with uncertainty, unpredictability and gen-
erative causality. For this, we need research designs and
methods that foreground dynamic interactions and emer-
gence – most notably, in-depth, mixed-method case stud-
ies that can act as concrete, context-dependent exemplars,
including powerful ethnographic narratives paying atten-
tion to interconnectedness and incorporating an under-
standing of how systems come together as a whole from
different perspectives [12, 18].
The original Medical Research Council (MRC) frame-
work for the development and testing of complex inter-
ventions, published in 2001, defined these as consisting
of
multiple
components
acting
independently
and
inter-dependently, in such a way that made it difficult to
identify the ‘active ingredient’ [19]. This early guidance
proposed a structured approach to developing such in-
terventions and upheld the randomised controlled trial
as the gold standard for testing them. An update to the
MRC framework in 2008 [20] extended the definition of
complexity to include the degree of behavioural change
and level of organisational involvement required to
implement the intervention, the level of variability of
outcomes and the degree of intervention flexibility
needed. Another update in 2015 [21] highlighted the
importance of non-linearity and iterative local tailoring,
and placed substantially more emphasis on the need for
non-experimental, mixed methods and process-based
approaches for studying such phenomena.
The MRC’s approach to complexity has thus shifted
considerably – both in terms of where the complexity is
assumed to lie (from the intervention to the system to
the interaction between the two) and in relation to how
best to study it (from the randomised controlled trial
atop an assumed hierarchy of evidence to a genuinely
pluralistic approach that gives appropriate weight to
real-world case studies). The MRC’s latest position intro-
duces (although does not consistently uphold) an under-
lying philosophical shift from a conventional Newtonian
(linear, cause-effect) perspective to a systems perspective
that embraces non-linear causality (Table 1). However,
many research funders, principal investigators and jour-
nal editors remain wedded to the intervention-focused
approach to complexity as originally mooted by the
MRC. Unfortunately, ‘complexity research’ has come to
be equated in some circles with a highly standardised se-
quence of developing a structured, multi-component
intervention, testing it in a randomised controlled trial
and following a somewhat formulaic and prescriptive
approach to implementation [13, 22–24].
It is time we faced the irony of this situation. There
are no universal solutions to the challenges of complex
health systems, nor is there a set of universal methods
that will bring us closer to the truth. Research protocols
consisting entirely of pre-ordained work packages ar-
ranged around a boxes-and-arrows diagram accompan-
ied by tight milestones and timelines may be the stuff

 that funding panels’ dreams are made of, but when the
focus of inquiry is the health system, such approaches
are – almost by definition – less likely to generate mean-
ingful findings than studies which engage pragmatically
with the multiple uncertainties involved and offer a
flexible and emergent approach to exploring them.
Understanding complexity in health systems:
International perspectives
The initial five articles in this series report on studies of
healthcare delivery and health systems. The empirical topics
are diverse; they cover mental health services, respiratory
conditions, medicines management, hospital-based rapid
response teams, system-level accreditation mechanisms and
digital health solutions (such as video consultations,
assisted living technologies and remote monitoring).
In the first paper, Braithwaite et al. [7] challenge trad-
itional thinking on implementation science as based, to a
greater or lesser extent, on linear and mechanistic (‘pipe-
line’) models of knowledge translation. Drawing on systems
thinking in social and organisational science, the authors
discuss how implementation can be understood as an
emergent and dynamic process. To achieve system-level
change, complexity-informed approaches to implementa-
tion would need to depart from a narrow focus on inter-
vention fidelity to embrace effective adaptation and
tailoring to context, working closely with local stake-
holders, and viewing implementation as an iterative, recur-
sive and long-term process. Taking the example of two
large-scale system transformations in Australia (implemen-
tation of rapid response systems and introduction of qual-
ity standards for health services accreditation), the paper
argues that quality and safety improvement can be
achieved by ‘attending to’
, rather than trying to ‘control for’
,
complexity.
Wolpert and Rutter [8] address what is often seen as
the cornerstone of evaluation and improvement – rou-
tinely collected quantitative datasets. Their paper raises
important questions about the value and usefulness of
such datasets with regards to measuring and represent-
ing change in complex health systems. As the authors
argue, quantitative datasets invariably contain Flawed,
Uncertain, Proximate and Sparse (FUPS) data, which
either become over-interpreted (leading to unwarranted
conclusions) or end up being dismissed as incomplete
and unreliable. The authors propose a third option,
namely to embrace FUPS datasets – warts and all – as a
key contributor in the change effort, recognising that,
whilst they cannot fully capture the complex world they
represent, they still have the potential to expose issues
for interrogation, act as sensitising devices for develop-
ing understanding and mobilise uncomfortable know-
ledge. The paper includes an important list of principles
for analysing and facilitating discussion on the basis of
FUPS data, illustrating these through an empirical
example in UK child mental healthcare.
Greenhalgh et al.’s [10] article addresses complexity as
manifested in technological innovation. Drawing on an
Table 1 Traditional versus new paradigm approaches to researching health services and systems
Traditional approach
New paradigm (complexity-informed) approach
Goal of research
Establishing the truth, universal and enduring;
finding solutions to well-defined problems
Exploring tensions; generating insights and wisdom;
exposing multiple perspectives; viewing complex
systems as moving targets
Assumed model of causality
Linear, cause-and-effect causality (perhaps
incorporating mediators and moderators)
Emergent causality: multiple interacting influences
account for a particular outcome but none can be
said to have a fixed ‘effect size’
Typical format of research question
“What is the effect size of the intervention on
the predefined outcome, and is it statistically
significant?”
“What combination of influences has generated this
phenomenon? What does the intervention of interest
contribute? What happens to the system and its actors
if we intervene in a particular way? What are the
unintended consequences elsewhere in the system?”
Mode of representation
Attempt to represent research in one
authoritative voice
Attempt to illustrate the plurality of voices inherent in
the research and phenomena under study
Good research is characterised by
Methodological ‘rigour’, i.e. strict application of
structured and standardised design, conventional
approaches to generalisability and validity
Strong theory, flexible methods, pragmatic adaptation
to emerging circumstances, contribution to generative
learning and theoretical transferability
Purpose of theorising
Disjunctive: simplification and abstraction;
breaking problems down into analysable parts
Conjunctive: drawing parts of the problem together
to produce a rich, nuanced picture of what is going
on and why
Approach to data
Research should continue until data collection
is complete
Data will never be complete or perfect; decisions
often need to be made in situations of incomplete
or contested data
Analytic focus
Dualisms: A versus B; influence of X on Y
Dualities: inter-relationships and dynamic tensions
between A, B, C and other emergent aspects

 extensive empirical dataset from six contrasting case
studies of technology-supported change in health and
social
care,
they
present
an
evidence-based,
theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to explain
the Non-adoption or Abandonment of technology by in-
dividuals and difficulties achieving Scale-up, Spread and
Sustainability (NASSS) in organisations [25]. The NASSS
framework embraces multiple levels of analysis to help
predict and evaluate programme success. Technology
failures, partial successes and unanticipated problems
are explained by teasing out the multiple aspects of
complexity across interacting domains, including the
condition, technology, value proposition, adopter system,
organisation, wider context and temporal change. The
discussion section includes recommendations for both
reducing the
complexity of a technology-supported
change programme and ‘running with’ aspects of com-
plexity that cannot be reduced.
Long et al. [9] offer a perspective of how to engage
with complexity in practice, based on synergies between
complexity theory and pragmatist philosophy. These au-
thors depict pragmatism as a way of prioritising action-
able knowledge linked to its contexts of use and suited
to address practical questions. Their analysis draws on a
3-year project aimed at developing simulation models to
provide strategic decision support for senior leaders in a
large public mental health service in Australia. Through
a study of simulation modelling to support service
implementation and evaluation, they illustrate how com-
plexity theory and pragmatism can be used as comple-
mentary approaches to guide and iteratively enhance
understanding. Their analysis focuses primarily on the
role of agency (that is, human initiative and action),
emergent outcomes (things that happen as a result of
multiple unfolding events and phenomena), continuous
learning and adaptive use of methods. This paper also
questions prevailing assumptions about complexity and
suggests there is a need to further explore its philosoph-
ical and epistemological underpinnings.
Reed et al. [11] respond to the call for complexity-in-
formed approaches in healthcare by synthesising learn-
ing from an extensive programme of improvement
initiatives in the UK. Their contribution introduces the
empirically-driven and theory-supported framework on Suc-
cessful Healthcare Improvement From Translating Evidence
(SHIFT-Evidence). Through analytical auto-ethnography
and grounded theory analysis on data collected across 22
quality improvement projects over a 5-year period,
the authors foreground the emergent behaviour of
complex systems and the iterative, adaptive nature of
change. Their analysis discusses tensions in embed-
ding evidence-based practices against local constraints
(‘acting scientifically and pragmatically’), the import-
ance of recognising and appreciating the complexity
of systemic issues (‘embracing complexity’), and the
need to facilitate commitment and engagement from
important stakeholders (‘engaging and empowering’).
These three principles are illustrated in two examples of
improvement projects in community-acquired pneumonia
and medicines management. Grounded in the practical
reality of healthcare improvement, the SHIFT-Evidence
framework is also accompanied by 12 ‘simple rules’ to
guide evidence translation.
The articles included in this collection illustrate the
value of iterative research approaches that are theoretic-
ally grounded, methodologically pluralistic, flexible and
ecologically focused. They adopt a range of approaches
to produce grounded explanations of what happened
when someone attempted to achieve change in a com-
plex, fast-changing healthcare environment. None of the
papers offers simple solutions, predictive tools or univer-
sal
formulae
(though
some
submissions
that
were
rejected from this call did purport to ‘solve’ complexity
in this way). This series builds on the creative work of
other research teams who have taken a nuanced and
theory-informed approach to the study of complexity in
healthcare - for example, Dixon-Woods et al. [26] on
ex-post theorising of patient safety initiatives, Nugus et
al. [27] on integrated care in the emergency department,
and Lanham et al. [28] on scale-up and spread in
healthcare.
All these studies engage, in different ways, with what
Tsoukas has called ‘conjunctive theorising’
, that is, avoid-
ing the temptation to simplify and abstract (an approach
which Tsoukas calls ‘disjunctive theorising’), towards an
approach to theory that generates rich pictures of com-
plex phenomena by drawing together different kinds of
data from multiple sources [29]. Conjunctive theorising,
proposes Tsoukas, is characterised by an open-world
ontology (viewing the world as subject to multiple inter-
acting influences, and recognising that it serves no
useful analytic purpose to strip away these layers of
influence in artificial simplifications), a performative
epistemology (that is, a focus on real-world action and on
what becomes possible through action), and a poetic prax-
eology (that is, a way of writing up case studies that values
descriptive detail, apt metaphor and narrative coherence).
The case studies in this series suggest a number of
high-level themes that could be explored further in fu-
ture research calls. First, new research could address the
general proposal that the health services research com-
munity should embrace a richer and more diverse meth-
odological repertoire when researching complex systems.
How, specifically, might that methodological repertoire
be extended? Second, new research could respond to
Tsoukas’ call for a retreat from simplification and
abstraction, and explore how conjunctive theorising
could extend the possibilities of the mixed-method case

 study [29]. Third, research in real-world settings could
generate new ways of working productively with imper-
fect (FUPS) data [8]. Fourth, as Long et al. [9] have
shown, there is much potential still to be explored in
relation to the use of simulation modelling in the study
of complexity in healthcare. Finally, we need to put more
effort into developing theory-driven and empirically
focused frameworks that can guide implementation and
evaluation from a complexity perspective [10, 11].
Conclusion
Law and Mol were right to suggest that “We need other
ways of relating to complexity, other ways for complexity
to
be
accepted,
produced,
or
performed”
[30].
As
researchers, clinicians and lifelong learners, we need to
develop capability and capacity to handle the unknown,
the uncertain, the unpredictable and the emergent [4].
In other words, we need to develop a ‘systems mindset’
that
recognises
changing
interrelationships
between
parts of the system (or even what constitutes a system at
any given time) and adapts to unexpected change [31].
Complexity science will not provide a simple fix for the
inherent tensions and paradoxes in contemporary health
systems, but it will allow us to focus on – and begin to
research – uncomfortable knowledge, to negotiate good
compromises and to embrace creative, reflexive and col-
laborative ways of working and thinking. The organising
vision behind complexity-informed healthcare research
needs to encompass “a commitment to engage in disagree-
ments” [32], making sure that we remain critical about our
assumptions and methods. We invite readers to share this
commitment by continuing to contribute to this thematic
collection. Submissions are open until June 30, 2019.
