Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection poses significant adverse health effects.
Improper use of vials, needles, syringes, intravenous bags, tubing, and connec-
tors for injections and infusions is a current preventable cause of iatrogenic
HCV transmission. Numerous cases have demonstrated the need for continued
vigilance and the widespread nature of this iatrogenic infection risk across a
variety of medical practice settings in the United States. Failure to implement the
evidence-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) infection
prevention guidelines exposes patients to preventable harm. The guidelines
establish the requirement to notify patients in cases of suspected virus transmis-
sion, as well as to screen those patients who would not otherwise have been at
risk for HCV seroconversion and other bloodborne pathogens. Legal and regula-
tory ramifications, including state, criminal, and tort laws, hold physicians and
other health care professionals accountable to use safe injection practices. This
article reviews the major health risks of HCV infection, significant effects of iatro-
genic infection transmission, CDC guidelines for safe injection practices, and
legal regulations and ramifications designed to promote safe injection practices.

H
epatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in the fla-
viviridae family that targets hepatic cells.1-3 This bloodborne pathogen can
acutely lead to nausea, icterus, jaundice, dark urine, clay-colored stool, and
abdominal pain, with laboratory values reflecting elevated alanine aminotransferase
levels.1,2,4-7 Approximately 75% of HCV infection cases become chronic, with serious
health risks, including hepatic carcinoma, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy,
liver cirrhosis, and vertical transmission to an infant.4,6,8-11 Additionally, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that HCV infection is the most common
cause of the need for liver transplantation.4,10 In this article, we describe the risks, epi-
demiology, transmission, treatment, prevention, legal ramifications, and physician
responsibility related to iatrogenic infection of HCV.
Iatrogenic HCV Transmission Risks and Epidemiology
While there is no vaccine for HCV, there are effective treatment options.3,11 Until 2011,
combination treatment with interferon-α and ribavirin was the only available option for
patients with HCV infection.1 Since that time, antivirals and protease inhibitors that are
HCV specific and have fewer adverse effects have become first-line treatment for patients

 with HCV infection, and treatment is based on which of
the 7 HCV genotypes is present in a patient.12-14 The
classic genotype found in the United States is genotype
1, which can be treated in 1 of 4 ways determined by
further classification of the subtype, nonstructural
protein 5A resistance, and a patient’s history of cirrho-
sis. For example, to treat patients with HCV genotype
1A without cirrhosis, a once-per-day combination
tablet of sofosbuvir (400 mg) and ledipasvir (90 mg)
for 12 weeks is a level-A recommendation.12,14 The
presence of liver cirrhosis and other comorbidities not
only indicates the need for aggressive, urgent treatment
but can also indicate different treatments for appropriate
management.14 Use of the recommendations by the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
and the Infectious Disease Society of America to
select the most appropriate therapy based on the
patient’s specific infection genotype, viral resistance,
and symptom profile is highly recommended.14
Identification and treatment does not always occur,
however, because significant adverse health effects
often take decades to develop, leaving a significant
asymptomatic
window
for
disease
transmis-
sion.1,4,6,11,15 In 2009, a review article15 reported that
in 25% of HCV-infected persons, the infection pro-
gressed to display acute hepatitis with symptoms such
as jaundice.
The CDC’s screening recommendations for HCV
infection try to take advantage of the large asymptom-
atic window to initiate effective treatment.15 These
recommendations include screening all patients in any
of the following categories4,10:
▪ Birth between 1945 and 1965
▪ History of injectable drug use
▪ Recipient of clotting factor concentrates before 1987
▪ Recipient of blood transfusions or organ transplants
before 1992
▪ History of long-term dialysis
▪ Infection with HIV
▪ Elevation in alanine aminotransferase level
▪ Known HCV exposure
▪ Born to HCV-positive mother (screening of these
patients must occur at age ≥18 months)
The calculated 130 to 170 million people with HCV
infection globally, representing a 2.2% to 3% global
prevalence (the CDC’s 2014 US estimated prevalence
was 2.7-3.9 million people), represents a serious health
concern.4,15,16 The asymptomatic window of HCV
infection makes it especially important to understand
the potential risk factors that indicate screening and,
potentially, treatment. In the case of an HCV outbreak,
reporting cases of HCV infection to the CDC to prompt
an investigation could help to identify an iatrogenic
source patient and others who may be linked to the
transmission. Although screening and treatment can be
effective for many patients, prevention is of paramount
importance in protecting patients from the health risks
associated with HCV infection.1,4 Implementing safe
injection practices is an important way medical profes-
sionals can take personal responsibility to reduce the
risk of iatrogenic HCV transmission.
Historically, iatrogenic HCV infection proliferated
through blood transfusions and organ transplantations
before 1992, when donations began to be screened in
the United States.9 Abundant improper use of glass syr-
inges for vaccinations, insulin, and antibiotic injections
further contributed to iatrogenic HCV transmission at
the end of the 20th century.9 Currently, injection drug
use has become the major contributor to the epidemic
of HCV transmission.4,9 Similarly, any medical proced-
ure that involves injections during which contaminated
equipment could be used poses a risk for HCV trans-
mission.4 Iatrogenic HCV transmission has been
reported in various outpatient settings, including hospi-
tals and clinics for alternative medicine, cardiology,
dialysis, endoscopy, insulin infusion, pain manage-
ment, oncology, and prolotherapy.5-7,17-23 The known
or suspected mode of transmission includes syringe
reuse, fingerstick device reuse, single-dose vial reuse,
infection control lapses in medication preparation,
drug diversion, and breaches in environmental cleaning
and disinfection practices.17,18 Adherence to injection

 safety procedures would effectively eliminate this trans-
mission risk.
Iatrogenic HCV Transmission: A
Common and Widespread Problem
A report19 released in 2009 documented 16 HCV out-
breaks in the previous decade at a variety of health
care facilities, leading to 275 patients acquiring iatro-
genic HCV infection. Another review article20 cata-
loged 35 reports of injection safety violations between
2001 and 2011 that required patient notification related
to bloodborne pathogen risk. These 35 reports were
from 17 states as well as Washington, DC, and resulted
in notification of an estimated 130,198 patients.20
Look-back investigations like these are conducted on a
case-by-case basis with CDC guidance (Table 1).20,21
Iatrogenic HCV outbreaks can be avoided by adher-
ence to the CDC’s safe injection practices.24 Despite
the best efforts of those involved in these lookback
investigations or notification events, including state
regulatory medical boards, often with help from the
CDC, cases of potential infection with HCV and other
bloodborne pathogens sometimes remain undetected.
Investigations that show a difference between the
number of patients notified and the number of patients
screened demonstrate the presence of unscreened
patients who may be infected with HCV. These patients
are not only at risk for the adverse effects of the virus,
they present a risk to the community because of pos-
sible further viral transmission.8,19-20,23
Guidelines for Safe Injection
Practices: Preventing Iatrogenic HCV
Transmission
A list of evidence-based guidelines for safe injection
practices that were established by the CDC in 2007
and reaffirmed in 2012 is presented in Table 2.24,26,27
These guidelines have been promoted by the Safe
Injection Practices Coalition,2,27,28 started in 2009,
with the associated One & Only Campaign, which
recommends using 1 needle and 1 syringe for only 1
patient.29
Physicians can evaluate their procedures using the
CDC injection safety checklist at https://www.cdc.gov/
injectionsafety/pdf/sipc_checklist.pdf.30 These guide-
lines
have
an
accord
with
the
World
Health
Organization’s (WHO) guidelines for safe injection
practice published in 2010.11 The WHO guidelines
place particular emphasis on the use of an aseptic tech-
nique, including hand hygiene, disinfecting the skin at
the site of venipuncture, and glove use (1 pair of
gloves per procedure or patient). The WHO guidelines
also reinforce the CDC’s injection safety guidelines in
the following areas: the advisement of 1 sharp31 used
per procedure, with immediate disposal of the used
sharp in a designated sharps container with a tamper-
proof lid; encouragement to assume that damaged or
opened medical equipment has been used and cannot
be used again; and recommendation to avoid the use
of multiuse vials and, if used, to discard contaminated
vials immediately.11 Some notable additions in the
WHO guidelines are the recommendation to use
1-handed
methods
whenever
possible,
to
avoid
unneeded injections, such as oral or rectal routes of
medication administration, and to report accidents
immediately.11 For most bloodborne pathogens, it is
recommended to start postexposure prophylaxis within
72 hours. However, HCV is unique because, as the
WHO guidelines point out, there is no postexposure
prophylaxis or vaccine for HCV; the only response to
exposure is to perform baseline testing for antibodies
to HCV and alanine aminotransferase levels so that
appropriate treatment can begin.11
Analysis of a 2014 iatrogenic HCV outbreak in
Tennessee showed how the Tennessee Department of
Health properly used the CDC guidelines to evaluate
the dialysis facility where the suspected source patient
was identified.32 The facility was found to have no
visible blood; sinks were available for hand hygiene,
glove use was observed; dialysis stations were properly
disinfected
between
patients;
medications
were
observed to be prepared for specific patients away

 from patient areas; and multidose vials were not
allowed in treatment areas and were only used in a sep-
arate clean room to maintain sterility. Although 2 cases
of iatrogenic HCV spread were identified as linked to
treatment at this dialysis center, no violation of the
CDC’s injection safety guidelines was detected.32
During a 2007 New York State HCV infection out-
break investigation, 2 distinct groups of iatrogenic
HCV-infected patients were identified.33 This investi-
gation was initiated after a patient from the first group
reported having acute symptoms, which started the
process of notification and screening for bloodborne
pathogens.20,33 Most patients with chronic HCV infec-
tion are asymptomatic, as were all of the patients in
the second group discovered during this investiga-
tion.6,19 This second group of patients would likely
not have been identified if a concurrent local investiga-
tion had not been initiated.20,33 Therefore, a reasonable
medical professional cannot rely solely on using
injection safety guidelines for documented HCV
infection.4,5,19
Step 3 in the Figure shows that replacement of just
the needle does not remove the HCV infection risk
from the contaminated syringe.20,24,28 This concept

 also applies to the use of IV bags, tubing, and connec-

Single-dose vials also cannot be used more than once,
as shown in step 4 in the Figure.24,28 These vials lack
preservatives and are an environment in which bacteria
or viruses have a high potential to multiply and com-
promise the vial,2,26 leading to iatrogenic infection if
that vile is used for another patient.24,28
Patient-to-patient transmission in the health care
environment is the major concern of the CDC guide-
lines, the One & Only Campaign, and the WHO guide-
lines, but preventing transmission to patients from
clinicians is another way to reduce the iatrogenic
spread
of
HCV.
The
Society
for
Health
Care
Epidemiology of America (SHEA) compiled a list of
evidence-based guidelines to reduce the risk of
clinician-to-patient transmission of bloodborne patho-
gens.3,35 Although SHEA states that infected clinicians
pose almost no risk to patients, it also states that this
low risk applies to noninvasive procedures or an
infected clinician whose infection is well controlled.3,35
The SHEA guidelines recommend that if a clinician’s
viral load is greater than or equal to ×104 GE/mL, he
or she should wear 2 pairs of gloves and should not
perform category-3 procedures, during which there is a
high transmission risk.3,35 Category-3 procedures
include general surgery, general oral surgery, cardio-
thoracic surgery, open extensive head and neck
surgery, neurosurgery, emergency surgery, obstetrics
and gynecology, orthopedic surgery, transplantation,
plastic surgery, trauma intervention, and any open
surgical procedure longer than 3 hours, as well as

 situations in which there is a risk of a patient biting a
clinician.3,35
Clinicians who know that they have a bloodborne
pathogen such as HCV are ethically obligated to
monitor
their
own
viral
load
and
submit
to
twice-per-year testing.3,35 It is also recommended that
infected clinicians have the results analyzed by a phys-
ician who can initiate proper viral load-reducing treat-
ment and report the results to a review panel to
regulate the infected clinician’s practice scope.3,35 A
lookback study can be initiated if proactive reporting
identifies a clinician who may have a viral load that
could put patients at risk,3,35 if there is a suspected or
recorded clinician-to-patient transmission event, if a
clinician’s viral infection is linked to a viral burden
beyond the stated limits, or if recommended screening
determines that a clinician was involved in category-3
procedures while having a viral load beyond the stated
limits.3,35 Prevention of iatrogenic clinician-to-patient
HCV transmission additionally involves identifying
clinicians who are impaired owing to the use of
injectable drugs in or outside the workplace.18,20 A
total of 13,162 patients were notified of bloodborne
pathogen risk in notification events associated with
clinician drug diversion of fentanyl in 2004, 2009, and
2010.18,20 Policies that prevent diversion include
locking medications in schedule II through V categories
securely in accordance with the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970,18 using
tamper-resistant syringes, testing wasted drugs to
confirm whether they are narcotics, and labeling pre-
filled syringes with patient identification.18 Drug diver-
sion by clinicians must be reported to regulatory
agencies, and the clinicians need to be referred to the
State Medical Licensing Board’s physician health
program for rehabilitation.18,20
Legal and Regulatory Ramifications
of Iatrogenic HCV Infection
Clinician-focused laws require clinicians, independent
or within medical institutions, to follow CDC infection
prevention procedures, such as the 2007 guidelines for
safe injection practices.2,24,25,36 These guidelines are
part of the standard of care defined legally as the
actions consistent with what “a reasonable provider
would (execute) under the same circumstances.”36
There is a duty to report violations of the CDC’s infec-
tion control guidelines.36 Proactive reporting is import-
ant to limit the negative effects of specific violations of

 infection control guidelines. The notification events
mentioned previously could have been reduced in
scope if the unsafe practices were stopped earlier
through proactive reporting. One review article reported
that 63% of iatrogenic HCV infection cases were dis-
covered after identifying an acute case of HCV infec-
tion, and 37% were discovered by direct observation
and proactive reporting.20 Administrators of health
care facilities need to be aware that legal regulations
define health care facilities as accountable to establish
and maintain programs for patient safety.36 When there
is a violation of safe injection practices, the clinicians
involved need to be reported to their state licensing
board, and they are subjected to 3 types of legal ramifi-
cations: state law, criminal law, and tort law.36
State law establishes the responsibility for practicing
health care and averting preventable harm,36 primarily
through establishing requirements for licensure, such
as completion of accredited medical training and con-
tinuing medical education requirements.32,36 Facilities
can be subjected to inspection to promote safe clinical
settings for medical practice.36 Patient files may also
be accessed to investigate violations of the standard of
care because of the public health exception in the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996.36 Medical license regulation was implemented
after a 2007 investigation of iatrogenic HCV spread at
a New York outpatient endoscopy clinic.32,36 An
anesthesiologist misused single-use medication to treat
several patients and reused the syringes, leading to
patient notifications and bloodborne pathogen screen-
ings.32 This anesthesiologist’s license was suspended
and then revoked in accordance with state laws, which
can be implemented if violations of the standard of
care produce preventable harm.25,36 In addition, the
New York State Department of Health updated its
licensure requirements to include required continuing
medical education on the prevention of bloodborne
pathogen transmission and developed new accreditation
requirements for outpatient clinics that use anesthesia.32
The anesthesiologist filed for bankruptcy during the
progression of this case.36
Criminal law ramifications were brought against a
physician who reused syringes to save money and was
responsible for 9 iatrogenic HCV infections at a
Nevada outpatient endoscopy clinic, resulting in the
death of multiple patients.37 Second-degree murder
was one of the charges brought against this physician,
and a jury found him guilty of this and 26 other crim-
inal charges.37 This physician was imprisoned for life,
with parole eligibility after 18 years.37 Other possible
criminal law repercussions include fines, arrest, or facil-
ity closure, with the magnitude of repercussions based
on established gravity and intent of the criminal act.36
Charges can focus on the medical professional who
committed the crime, but charges can also be brought
against any other health care professionals involved.36
In the Nevada case, charges were also brought against
the assistant, which resulted in a prison sentence for
this person.36,37 Medical institutions that allow or
encourage a crime can also be the focus of criminal
charges.36
Tort law works to provide recompense to victims for
the adverse effects of standard of care violations.36 A
prosecutor must prove all 4 criteria—duty, breach,
causation, and damages—to receive compensation
under tort law.36,38 Duty refers to the standard of care;
breach establishes that a different action was taken com-
pared with the duty established; causation defines that
the defendant caused or is responsible for the breach;
and damages outline or quantify the grievances the
prosecutor endures because of the defendant’s caus-
ation.26,38 Similar to criminal law, clinicians or facil-
ities can be the focus of charges related to tort law.36
Duty can be based on clinical practice-based guide-
lines, such as the CDC’s guidelines for safe injection
practices. Clinical practice-based guidelines themselves
cannot be entered as evidence if the author of the guide-
lines is not available to be cross-examined; they would
be thrown out as hearsay.39,40 The document can,
however, enter as a statement from an expert witness
that asserts the validity of the guidelines as a learned
treatise that can then be evaluated by a jury.39,40 Tort
law repercussions for standard of care violations are

 either compensatory, meaning equal to the damages
established, or punitive, meaning increased beyond the
current damages already established.36 Preventable
harm is thus mitigated by this compensation.
Historically, causation might be difficult to establish,
and a tort law case could be dropped for lack of caus-
ation; however, genetic analysis has objectified the
process of establishing causation.4,9,19,36 Diagnosis of
HCV currently includes an algorithm of screening
with serologic antibody testing followed by HCV
RNA detection using reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis.4,6 Genetic analysis of
the conserved nonstructural protein 5B RNA nucleotide
region using PCR not only acts as a confirmatory diag-
nostic test but is also used to establish the HCV genetic
subtype.4,6,7 Investigation of an HCV outbreak in 2002
at a hematology and oncology clinic in Nebraska used
PCR to show that 95 patients had been infected with
HCV genotype 3a.22 This genotype is geographically
associated with Russia because of an unsafe measles
vaccination program in Russia.9 Genotype analysis of
a 2015 outbreak at an acute-care general hospital in
Texas identified HCV transmission linkage between 2
patients with iatrogenic HCV infections—both with
genotype 4a.21 This genotype accounts for 1% of the
HCV infections in the United States and is geographic-
ally associated with Egypt because of a local antischis-
tosomal therapy campaign.21,41,42 Confirming the
genotype not only guides medical management but
also serves as evidence to support causation for harms
associated with iatrogenic HCV transmission, as well
as prompts further investigation.4,9,19
Polymerase chain reaction can further and more
definitively establish genetic similarity when it is
implemented to analyze HCV RNA hypervariable
regions, such as region E1, also called hypervariable
region 1.4,6,7,19,23,41 To investigate the HCV iatrogenic
outbreak at the Nevada endoscopy clinic, PCR was
used to show 98.6% similarity between the E1 region
of 1 patient iatrogenically infected and a suspected
source patient. The assay also revealed 98.3% to 100%
similarity between E1 and 6 other patients, as well as a
different suspected source patient.6 In North Carolina,
PCR was used to investigate iatrogenic HCV infection
at an outpatient cardiology clinic, showing similarities
of 97.6% to 99.3% among 3 iatrogenically infected
patients and the suspected source patient.7 Genetic
similarity in the hypervariable regions of HCV, as
shown in these examples, objectively established that
iatrogenic HCV infection was related to a common
source patient and a common mechanism of iatrogenic
spread, legally establishing a causality link.4,6,7,19,23
Physician Responsibility for Infection
Prevention
The fact that HCV outbreaks related to failure to imple-
ment safe injection practices have persisted despite
continued efforts to increase patient safety in the clinical
environment shows the critical importance of this issue.
Iatrogenic HCV transmission is an example of a prevent-
able harm resulting in adverse clinical outcomes for
patients, as well as licensure and legal ramifications for
the clinicians involved.1,2,4-7,32,36 It is the physician’s
responsibility to “preserve the health and the life of
[their] patients” and to “pursue lifelong learning to
better care for the sick and to prevent illness.”42,43 The
CDC’s One & Only Campaign continues to promote the
use of 1 needle, 1 syringe, only 1 time.34 Health care
professionals would do well to evaluate their procedures
using the CDC injection safety checklist,30 especially
in outpatient settings in which a dedicated infection
prevention professional may not be available.
Acknowledgment
We appreciate the efforts of the researchers who have partici-
pated in the lookback investigations to identify HCV infection
outbreaks for promoting public health and those who have
helped to define evidence based opportunities to implement
safe injection practices.
