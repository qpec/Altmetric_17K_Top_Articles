 Aspirin Plus Clopidogrel vs Aspirin Alone for Preventing
Cardiovascular Events Among Patients at High Risk
for Cardiovascular Events
Marco P. Donadini, MD, PhD; Marta Bellesini, MD; Alessandro Squizzato, MD, PhD
Introduction
Aspirin is recommended by clinical practice guidelines for prevent-
ing ischemic events among patients at high risk for or with estab-
lished cardiovascular disease (ie, history of peripheral artery dis-
ease, stroke, or coronary artery disease without a coronary stent).1
Adding clopidogrel to aspirin may be associated with additional
benefits,2buttheevidenceremainsunclear.3ThisJAMAClinicalEvi-
dence Synopsis summarizes a Cochrane review on the associations
of aspirin and clopidogrel with the outcomes of mortality, cardio-
vascular events, and major bleeding vs aspirin alone among pa-
tients at high risk for or with established cardiovascular disease.4
Summary of Findings
Clopidogrel plus aspirin was not associated with lower cardiovas-
cular mortality compared with aspirin alone (586/15 939 vs 598/
15 964; relative risk [RR], 0.98 [95% CI, 0.88-1.10], P = .77) or all-
cause mortality (871/16 440 vs 871/16 468; RR, 1.05 [95% CI,
0.87-1.25], P = .62). Aspirin plus clopidogrel was associated with a
reduced risk for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction compared
with aspirin alone (367/8073 vs 470/8102; RR, 0.78 [95% CI,
0.69-0.90], P < .01) and with a reduced risk for fatal or nonfatal
ischemic stroke (127/2010 vs 172/1996; RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.59-
0.91], P < .01).
However, clopidogrel plus aspirin was associated with a higher
risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin alone (494/16 638 vs
344/16 662; RR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.25-1.64], P < .01; Table). The addi-
tion of clopidogrel to aspirin compared with aspirin alone was as-
sociated with 13 (95% CI, 6-19) fewer cases of myocardial infarc-
tion and 23 (95% CI, 7-39) fewer cases of ischemic stroke for every
1000patientstreatedduringamedianperiodof12months,butalso
with an increase of 9 (95% CI, 6-12) cases of major bleeding during
a median period of 10.5 months.
Discussion
The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel was associated with a
lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with aspirin alone
amongpatientsathighriskforcardiovasculareventsandamongpa-
tients with established cardiovascular disease but without coro-
narystents.However,thecombinationofaspirinandclopidogrelwas
not associated with lower mortality but was associated with an in-
creasedriskofbleeding.Theseresultsdonotallowidentificationof

Evidence Profile
No. of randomized clinical trials: 15
Study years: 1998-2014 (conducted), 2001-2017 (published)
Dates of literature search: 1946 to July 4, 2017
No. of patients: 33 970 (men: 67.9%; women: 32.1%)
Race/ethnicity: Chinese, Hispanic, white, black
Age, mean (range): 64 years (18-95 years)
Setting: Hospital
Countries: Global
Inclusion criteria: Acute coronary syndrome, recent ischemic
stroke, peripheral artery disease, coronary disease and undergoing
coronary artery bypass surgery, high risk of cardiovascular events
(eg, metabolic syndrome, multiple cardiovascular risk factors)
Comparison: Aspirin plus clopidogrel vs aspirin plus placebo or
aspirin alone
Primary outcomes: Cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality,
fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal
ischemic stroke
Secondary outcomes: Major bleeding (ie, fatal bleeding,
hemorrhagic stroke, gastric bleeding, any bleeding requiring
blood transfusion, bleeding resulting in a decrease of greater than
2 mg/dL in hemoglobin level, or requiring hospitalization)
CLINICAL QUESTION Among patients at high risk for or with established cardiovascular disease
(ie, history of peripheral artery disease, stroke, or coronary artery disease without a coronary
stent), is the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin associated with lower risk of mortality and
cardiovascular events compared with aspirin alone?
BOTTOM LINE Clopidogrel plus aspirin is associated with a reduced risk for myocardial
infarction and ischemic stroke and an increased risk for major bleeding compared with aspirin
alone among patients at high risk for or with an established cardiovascular disease but
without a coronary stent. However, combined therapy is not associated with lower mortality.

excluded from all trials.
Comparison of Findings With Current Practice Guidelines
The use of clopidogrel combined with aspirin is recom-
mended for up to 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome
event by the joint guideline from the American College of Car-
diology and the American Heart Association5 and by guidelines
from the European Society of Cardiology6,7 and is suggested
for up to 3 months after a minor stroke by the joint guideline
from the American Heart Association and the American Stroke
Association.8
Areas in Need of Future Study
Future research should identify subgroups of patients most likely
to benefit and least likely to experience an adverse event. Future
trials also should define the cardiovascular and bleeding out-
comes in a more uniform manner.
