Abstract
Background
Cycling is a recreational activity and mode of commuting with substantial potential to
improve public health in many countries around the world. The aim of this study was to
examine prospective associations between recreational and commuter cycling, changes in
cycling habits, and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Danish adults from the Diet, Cancer and
Health cohort study.
Methods and Findings
At baseline from 1993 to 1997, 24,623 men and 27,890 women from Denmark, 50–65 y of
age and free of T2D and other chronic diseases, underwent a number of assessments,
including completing a lifestyle questionnaire also addressing cycling habits. Approximately
5 y later, at a second examination, participants completed a new, updated lifestyle question-
naire. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of incident T2D registered
in the Danish National Diabetes Registry, according to recreational and commuter cycling
and changes in cycling habits, with adjustment for a priori known T2D risk factors. During
743,245.4 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up 14.2 y), 6,779 incident cases of T2D
were documented. Multivariable adjusted HRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 1, 0.87
(0.82, 0.93), 0.83 (0.77, 0.89), 0.80 (0.74, 0.86) and 0.80 (0.74, 0.87) (p for trend = <0.001)
for 0, 1–60, 61–150, 151–300, and >300 min/wk of total cycling (recreational and commuter
cycling), respectively. In analysis of seasonal cycling, multivariable adjusted HRs (95% CI)
were 1, 0.88 (0.83, 0.94), and 0.80 (0.76, 0.85) for non-cyclists, seasonal cyclists (those
cycling only in summer or winter), and those cycling during both summer and winter,

 respectively. How changes in total cycling from baseline to the second examination affected
risk was also investigated, and multivariable adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.88 (0.78,
1.01), 0.80 (0.69, 0.91), and 0.71 (0.65, 0.77) for non-cyclists and for those who ceased, ini-
tiated, or continued cycling between baseline and the second examination, respectively.
Lastly, in the analysis of commuter cycling, multivariable HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.72 (0.60,
0.87), 0.83 (0.69, 1.00), and 0.70 (0.57, 0.85) (p for trend = <0.001) for cycling 0, 1–60, 61–
150, and >150 min/wk to work, respectively. The main limitation of the current study is the
use of self-reported physical activity.
Conclusions
Commuter and recreational cycling was consistently associated with lower risk of T2D in
Danish adults. Our results also provide evidence that late-in-life initiation of or continued
engagement in cycling lowers risk of T2D.
Author Summary
Why Was this Study Done?
• Habitual cycling in the general population may have the potential to promote public
health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D).
• A number of previous studies have investigated the relationship between active trans-
port, combining cycling and walking, and T2D; however, previous research investigating
the relationship between cycling for recreation or transport and risk of T2D is sparse.
• Our study was done to investigate whether cycling specifically is valuable in the preven-
tion of T2D among a Danish population with widespread engagement in regular cycling.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Based on information from a large population-based study, we investigated if the risk of
T2D was related to habitual cycling when personal- and lifestyle-related risk factors
were taken into account.
• We found that habitual cycling was related to a lower risk of T2D than no cycling, and
that a longer duration of weekly cycling seemed to be preferable to less weekly cycling.
• We also found that those who took up habitual cycling in middle to old age had a 20%
lower risk of T2D compared to those who remained non-cyclists.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• It seems beneficial to encourage adults of middle and old age to engage in commuter
and recreational cycling to prevent the development of T2D in late adulthood.

increase cycling through promotional activities and infrastructural changes, it may be
suggested that national and local governments prioritize resources to promote cycling.
Introduction
Cycling for transportation and recreation has been emphasized for its great potential for
improving public health [1]. As part of an overall global action plan to prevent and control
noncommunicable disease, the World Health Organization has called for a reduction in the
prevalence of physical inactivity. The promotion of active transport, i.e., commuter walking or
cycling, is a central component of the policy options defined to achieve this goal [2]. Because
cycling may be conveniently incorporated into daily life chores such as commuting to school,
work, or grocery shopping, it may be a mode of physical activity that appeals to a large part of
the population. Additionally, cycling is an environmentally sustainable mode of transport com-
pared to motorized transportation [3]. Although habitual cycling is likely to be health- and fit-
ness-enhancing physical activity [4], its importance for chronic disease prevention in
populations has been scarcely investigated. Habitual cycling has, in prospective cohort studies
of adults, been associated with a lower incidence of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease
[5], less weight gain [6], and lower all-cause mortality [7]. Cycling may be particularly valuable
for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention, since a large body of evidence from observational and
experimental studies shows that regular engagement in physical activity and lifestyle interven-
tion incorporating physical activity substantially decreases T2D risk [8].
The benefits of recreational and commuter cycling for the prevention of T2D are still unclear;
cycling has been associated with a lower risk of diabetes cross-sectionally [9–12], and two pro-
spective studies found no lower risk of incident T2D when comparing cyclists with non-cyclists
who were free of chronic disease at recruitment [13,14]. It remains to be examined in greater
detail whether cycling is valuable in the prevention of T2D. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the prospective association of recreational and commuter cycling with T2D risk
among generally healthy Danish adults in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study. We also
investigated how seasonal cycling and changes in cycling habits were related to incidence of T2D.
We undertook these investigations in a Danish adult population living in cities where cycling
infrastructure is well developed and cycling is common across socio-demographic groups [3].
Methods
Ethics
The Diet, Cancer and Health study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
It was approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee of Copenhagen (no. H-KF-01-345/93),
and the study protocol for the current study was approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency (no. 2015-57-0008). At the study clinic, informed written consent to collect data on
health outcomes in medical registries in the years that followed was gathered from all study
participants [15].
Participants
Between 1993 and 1997, 80,996 men and 79,729 women were invited to participate in the Diet,
Cancer and Health study. Inhabitants of Aarhus, Copenhagen, and surrounding cities were

 invited if between 50 and 64 years of age, born in Denmark, and without a diagnosis of cancer
registered in the Danish Cancer Registry. Nineteen percent of the Danish population within
the eligible age group were invited. Age of eligibility was chosen based on the prospect that new
cases of cancer and other chronic diseases would occur within a relatively short time frame. Eli-
gible persons were identified through the Civil Registration System, and 27,178 men and
29,875 women agreed to participate in baseline examinations [15], which took place between
November 24th, 1993, and May 28th, 1997. In analysis of total cycling (combined recreational
and commuter cycling) and seasonal cycling, which was reported at baseline, the following dis-
ease cases were excluded: diabetes according to the National Diabetes Registry (NDR), the
National Patient Registry, or self-report (n = 1,395); acute myocardial infarction (n = 913);
stroke (n = 597); and cancer (n = 569). This corresponded to exclusion of 3,268 participants
registered with one or more chronic diseases, leaving 53,785 eligible participants. After exclud-
ing missing data in covariates and exposure variables, 52,513 participants were included in the
analyses.
Approximately 5 y later (mean 5.4 y), between 1999 and 2003, participants still alive and
residing in Denmark were invited for a second examination, and 45,264, or 79.3%, of the origi-
nal cohort participated between September 18th, 1999, and March 20th, 2003. In analysis of
changes in total cycling from baseline to the second examination, new disease cases between
the two examinations were excluded, in addition to those listed above: diabetes according to
the NDR, the National Patient Registry, or self-report (n = 1,485); acute myocardial infarction
(n = 463); stroke (n = 368); and cancer (n = 2,206). This corresponded to exclusion of 4,328
participants registered with one or more chronic diseases. When also excluding those regis-
tered with one or more chronic diseases before baseline, a total of 6,094 participants were
excluded, leaving 39,170 eligible participants. When those with missing data in covariates and
exposure variables were excluded, 27,712 participants were included in the analysis. For analy-
sis of commuter cycling, which was reported at the second examination, unemployed individu-
als (n = 1,375) and those who had retired (n = 20,738) were also excluded, leaving 20,874
eligible participants. After excluding missing data in covariates and exposure variables, 15,063
participants were included in the analysis (see Fig 1).
Data Collection
At baseline, a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which was developed
to be compatible with the Danish diet [16–19], was sent by mail and filled out before a visit to a
study clinic. At the clinic, an additional questionnaire was completed, containing lifestyle ques-
tions in general, addressing habits pertaining to, e.g., physical activity, smoking, and alcohol.
Furthermore, a lab technician measured anthropometrics, including weight, height, and waist
circumference, and biological material was collected [15].
At the second examination, a similar dietary survey, which also included questions on foods
that since baseline had been introduced to the Danish diet, was sent by mail and completed in
the participants’ home. An updated lifestyle questionnaire was also sent to the participants,
e.g., introducing questions on social network and self-rated health from the Medical Outcomes
Study 36-item short-form survey. Enquiry of weight according to self-report was included in
the lifestyle questionnaire. A tape measure was sent also to self-assess waist circumference [15].
Assessment of Physical Activity
In the lifestyle questionnaires, physical activity was enquired for both summer and winter,
except for physical activity at work and for stair climbing. Participants were asked to report
total hours per week of physical activity, although at the second examination, frequency of the

 activity was specified, as well as duration per time the activity was performed. This information
was used to calculate total hours per week for each activity. At baseline, the following physical
activities were reported: physical activity at work, walking, total cycling, housework, do-it-
yourself work, gardening, sports participation, and stair climbing. The same physical activities,
except for stair climbing, were reported at the second examination, although sports participa-
tion was divided into light, moderate, and vigorous sport. Importantly, at baseline, cycling was
reported in total, i.e., recreational cycling and commuter cycling combined, whereas at the sec-
ond examination, recreational cycling and commuter cycling were reported separately.
The physical activity questions in the baseline questionnaire have previously been validated
in populations similar to the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort against heart rate monitors to
assess energetic expenditure [20], accelerometers [21], and heart rate and movement censors
[22]. The studies showed that the questions were valid in terms of ranking groups of partici-
pants in large epidemiological studies according to overall physical activity levels. The results
also revealed fair reliability, with a significant weighed kappa statistic of 0.6 [20] and Spearman
correlation coefficients of 0.58–0.73. Fair reliability was also shown for cycling specifically
(Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.65) [21]. An assessment of the reliability and validity of
the questionnaire used at second examination has shown moderate-to-high reliability, with an
intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.76 for physical activity energy expenditure and good
validity for ranking individuals according to their overall physical activity energy expenditure
[23].
Physical activity variables were aggregated to average weekly minutes of physical activity
from winter and summer values. Furthermore, composite leisure time physical activity vari-
ables were created in metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week based on the following: 3
METs for walking or housework, 4 METs for gardening, 4.5 METs for do-it-yourself work, 6
METs for cycling and for general sports, and 4.5 METs, 8.5 METs, and 10 METs for light, mod-
erate, and vigorous sport participation, respectively. One MET is considered equivalent to the
resting metabolic rate, and MET values express intensity levels as multiples of the resting meta-
bolic rate [24]. Leisure time physical activity variables, including leisure time physical activity
other than relevant cycling, were also generated to adjust for these in the analyses.
Total cycling was categorized in 0, 1–60, 61–150, 151–300, and >300 min/wk. When
achieving >150 min/wk, one successfully met international recommendations for aerobic
physical activity [25]. Subjects were also categorized according to seasonal cycling as non-
cyclist, cyclists only summer or winter, or cyclist summer and winter. Because few participants
reported cycling only in winter, it was not possible to create separate categories for winter
cycling only and summer cycling only. Subjects were defined as cyclists if values were above 0
min/wk.
To define changes in total cycling from baseline to the second examination, we first com-
puted total cycling at the second examination by adding recreational and commuter cycling.
Participants were then grouped according to those who did no cycling, ceased to cycle, initiated
cycling, or continued cycling in the period between baseline and the second examination. The
cumulative average of total cycling from the two measurement points was also computed to
represent level of long-term exposure.
Commuter cycling was categorized similarly as total cycling, although because there were
few incident T2D cases in the two highest categories, these were merged to >150 min/wk.
Follow-Up and Identification of T2D Cases
All participants were followed through national disease registries through their unique person
identification number in the Danish Civil Registration System [26]. Cases of diabetes were

 identified based on registration in the Danish NDR. Established in 2006, the NDR identifies
cases based on data from other Danish medical registries. If one of six specific criteria in one of
three registries is met, this person is included. These criteria are: a diagnosis of diabetes accord-
ing to the National Patient Registry; registration of diabetic chiropody, i.e., treatment of feet
when also registered as a diabetic patient, in the National Health Service Register; five annual
blood glucose measurements or two blood glucose measurements per year for five consecutive
years, according to the National Health Service Register; and, lastly, purchase of anti-diabetic
drugs or prescribed insulin, registered in the Danish National Prescription Registry. The regis-
try also contains the date of inclusion [27]. This method of identifying cases of diabetes has
shown to have a sensitivity of 91% and a positive predictive value of 89% [28]. Personal data,
such as vital status from the Danish Civil Registration System, is also included in the NDR.
Although the NDR does not include data on type of diabetes diagnosis [27], incident cases of
diabetes in this study population are, however, interpreted as T2D, as adult-onset type 1 diabe-
tes has been found to be low proportionally to adult-onset T2D [29,30].
Statistical Methods
Due to asymmetric distributions, descriptive data for continuous variables were computed as
medians with interquartile ranges. Categorized data were computed as proportions.
If participants had only answered for one season in physical activity variables, the value for
the unanswered season was imputed based on the means for summer and winter for partici-
pants of the same sex and age (six strata) who had answered the question for both seasons. For
participants included in the analyses of total cycling and seasonal cycling, <0.2% had only
answered for one season in the physical activity variables; among participants in the analysis of
changes in total cycling, this ranged between 0.6% and 5.7%. Lastly, in analysis of commuter
cycling, the proportion who had only answered for one season ranged between 0.5% and 5.4%.
The multivariable analyses performed without imputation of physical activity variables, how-
ever, showed almost identical results as the analyses with imputation, with no differences in
direction of associations or statistical significance.
A few individuals reported unrealistically high values of cycling. Values above 18 hrs/wk
and 21 hrs/wk were considered unrealistic for commuter cycling and recreational cycling,
respectively. Total cycling considered realistic was 28 hrs/wk. Variables were truncated at these
maximum values if the change influenced total and within-category means.
Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing T2D according to
cycling habits were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. Proportionality of
hazards was assessed in adjusted log-log plots, and no systematic deviation from proportional-
ity was found. The underlying time scale was age, and the event was registration in the NDR.
Registrations in NDR prior to January 1st, 1995, have previously been found to be imprecise
[31], and, thus, cases preceding this date (n = 19) were excluded. In analyses of total cycling
and seasonal cycling, participants were considered at risk from age at clinic visit at baseline. In
analysis of changes in total cycling and in analysis of commuter cycling, participants were con-
sidered at risk from age at the second examination. Right truncation was at age of the following:
event, death, emigration, inactivity, or change in the Civil Registration System, or end of fol-
low-up (December 31st, 2011), whichever came first.
Test for trend was computed in analyses of total cycling and commuter cycling by assigning
participants with the median of their respective exposure category and treating this as continu-
ous in the model.
Confounders included in the Cox models were selected based on knowledge a priori. For
each analysis, an age-adjusted and a multivariable-adjusted model was computed. In analysis

 of total cycling and seasonal cycling, the following variables were adjusted for: age at baseline
(years), sex (male/female), years of basic school (<7/8–10/>10), years of higher education (0/
1–2/3–4/>4), alcohol intake (grams/day), dietary energy intake (kJ/day), vegetable intake
(grams/day), fruit intake (grams/day), potato consumption (grams/day), wholegrain cereal
consumption (grams/day), refined cereal consumption (grams/day), glycaemic load of all car-
bohydrates (units/day), coffee consumption (grams/day), polyunsaturated:saturated fat ratio,
physical activity at work (no work/sedentary/standing/manual work/heavy manual work),
smoking status (never/former/<15 g per day/15–25 g per day/>25 g per day), and leisure-time
physical activity other than total cycling (MET�hours per week). In the analysis of changes in
total cycling from baseline to the second examination, the following covariates were included
in the model: age at the second examination (years), sex (male/female), years of basic school
(<7/8–10/>10), years of higher education (0/1–2/3–4/>4), alcohol intake (grams/day), dietary
energy intake (kJ/day), coffee consumption (grams/day), polyunsaturated:saturated fat ratio,
physical activity at work (no work/sedentary/standing/manual work/heavy manual work),
smoking status (never/former/<15 g per day/15–25 g per day/>25 g per day), paternal diabetes
(yes/no/do not know), maternal diabetes (yes/no/do not know), and leisure-time physical
activity other than total cycling (MET�hours per week). Other than sex, years of basic school,
years of higher education, and physical activity at work, these were all based on data from the
second examination. In the analysis of commuter cycling, the adjustment was similar, although
leisure-time physical activity other than commuter cycling was included instead of leisure-time
physical activity other than total cycling. Dietary variables on a continuous scale were catego-
rized into quintiles, although coffee consumption was categorized into quartiles. Leisure-time
physical activity variables were also categorized into quintiles. Age was treated as continuous in
the model, assuming a linear relationship between age and risk of T2D. In all analyses, adjust-
ment for waist circumference was included in addition to the above in separate models, to
investigate the role of waist circumference as a potential mediating factor in the causal link
between cycling and T2D. Analyses with adjustment for body mass index (BMI) were also per-
formed for the same purpose. Importantly, BMI and waist circumference were measured objec-
tively at baseline and subjectively at the second examination, where BMI at the second
examination was calculated based on height at baseline and self-reported weight at the second
examination.
We also statistically evaluated whether there was an interaction between sex and cycling on
risk of T2D in the analyses. This was done by comparing models with an interaction term and
main effects with models containing main effects only, using the likelihood-ratio test. No inter-
action of sex was found in any analyses.
All analyses were conducted using STATA IC V.14 (STATA Corp, College Station, Texas,
USA) with α = 0.05.
Results
The current study included 743,245.4 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up 14.2 years)
from 52,513 participants, in which 6,779 incident cases of T2D were documented. This corre-
sponded to an incidence rate (95% CI) of 9.1 (8.9,9.3) cases per 1,000 years of follow-up.
At baseline, cyclists differed from non-cyclists on most characteristics (Table 1). With
higher weekly time spent cycling, median waist circumference was lower. In relation to physical
activity behaviours, leisure-time physical activity other than cycling tended to be higher with
cycling. Also, for physical activity at work, the proportion reporting sedentary physical activity
at work tended to be lower and the proportion reporting manual work higher. With higher
reported cycling, daily alcohol intake tended to be lower. In several dietary variables, i.e., energy

 intake, vegetable and fruit consumption, wholegrain cereal consumption, and glycaemic load
of all carbohydrates, these were higher with higher reported weekly cycling. Lastly, the propor-
tion who consumed 1–500 g of coffee per day tended to be higher with higher reported cycling.
Risk of T2D associated with level of total cycling is presented in Table 2. In the multivariable
adjusted model, HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.87 (0.82,0.93), 0.83 (0.77,0.89), 0.80 (0.74,0.86), and
0.80 (0.74,0.87) (p for trend = <0.001) for cycling 0, 1–60, 61–150, 151–300, and >300 min/
wk, respectively. A significant trend indicated inverse linear relations. Additional adjustment
for baseline waist circumference attenuated the associations, and HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.97
(0.91,1.04), 0.93 (0.86,1.00), 0.92 (0.85,0.99), and 0.90 (0.82,0.98) (p for trend = 0.005) for
cycling 0, 1–60, 61–150, 151–300, and >300 min/wk, respectively, although significance

 remained in all categories but 1–60 min/wk. Adjustment for baseline BMI also attenuated the
associations, and HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.96 (0.90,1.02), 0.90 (0.84,0.97), 0.89 (0.83,0.96), and
0.85 (0.78,0.93) (p for trend = <0.001) for cycling 0, 1–60, 61–150, 151–300 and >300 min/wk,
although conserving significance in all categories except for the 1–60 min/wk category.
The association of seasonal cycling and T2D was also analysed (Table 2). Multivariable
adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.88 (0.83,0.94), and 0.80 (0.76,0.85) for “no cycling,” “summer
or winter,” and “summer and winter,” respectively. Cycling “summer and winter” was associ-
ated with a significant lower risk of T2D compared to cycling “summer or winter.” When base-
line waist circumference was added to the model, the associations were somewhat attenuated;
HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.97 (0.91,1.04), and 0.91 (0.86,0.97) for “no cycling,” “summer or win-
ter,” and “summer and winter,” respectively, and significance remained for “summer and win-
ter” only. Adjustment for baseline BMI also revealed an attenuation, and HRs (95% CI) were 1,
0.96 (0.90,1.02), and 0.88 (0.83,0.93) for “no cycling,” “summer or winter,” and “summer and
winter,” respectively, where significance was conserved for “summer and winter” only. Nota-
bly, participants who cycled all year were exposed to a threefold higher amount of cycling com-
pared to seasonal cyclists (180 min/wk compared to 60 min/wk). It was investigated if the
estimates changed when amount of cycling during summer and/or winter was adjusted for; the
estimated HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.88 (0.83,0.94), and 0.81 (0.76,0.87) for “no cycling,” “sum-
mer or winter,” and “summer and winter,” respectively. Thus, the associations were almost
unchanged, and all significance was conserved. Furthermore, cycling “summer and winter”
continued to be associated with a significantly lower risk compared to cycling “summer or
winter.”
In a further attempt to limit residual confounding of sports participation in the associations
between cycling and T2D, separate analyses of total cycling and seasonal cycling were per-
formed in which only those who reported no sports participation were included. Multivariable
adjusted HRs (95% CI) in analysis of total cycling when only those who reported no sports

 participation were included (n = 23,765) were 1, 0.86 (0.78,0.94), 0.85 (0.77,0.94), 0.83
(0.75,0.92), and 0.85 (0.76,0.96) (p for trend = 0.001) for cycling 0, 1–60, 61–150, 151–300, and
>300 min/wk, respectively. Similarly, for seasonal cycling (n = 23,765), multivariable adjusted
HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.86 (0.79,0.94), and 0.84 (0.78,0.90) for “no cycling,” “summer or win-
ter,” and “summer and winter,” respectively. Thus, in these models, associations indicating
dose response relation were less evident, although for all exposure levels of cycling, HRs were
significantly lower than no cycling.
The association between changes in total cycling from baseline to the second examination
and T2D risk was then investigated (Table 3). HRs (95% CI) in the multivariable adjusted
model were 1, 0.88 (0.78,1.01), 0.80 (0.69,0.91), and 0.71 (0.65,0.77) for “no cycling,” “cessa-
tion,” “initiation,” and “continuation,” respectively. “Continuation” was associated with a sig-
nificantly lower risk compared to both “no cycling” and “cessation”. Despite lower cumulative
averages of total cycling, those who initiated cycling appeared to have a lower risk compared to
those who ceased to cycle, although the difference was not statistically significant. When
including waist circumference at the second examination in the model, HRs (95% CI) were 1,
0.91 (0.80,1.03), 0.85 (0.74,0.98), and 0.78 (0.71,0.86) for “no cycling,” “cessation,” “initiation,”
and “continuation,” respectively, and, thus, the associations were all moderately attenuated,
although no significance was lost. When adjustment for BMI at the second examination was
performed, the associations were attenuated to a similar extent, and HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.89
(0.78,1.01), 0.87 (0.75,0.99), and 0.77 (0.70,0.84) for “no cycling,” “cessation,” “initiation,” and
“continuation,” respectively, but all significance remained.
Of those eligible for the analysis of changes in total cycling from baseline to the second
examination and risk of T2D, 11,458 were excluded due to being missing in either covariates or
exposure variables. Those excluded were compared to those included in regards to age, cycling
exposure, waist circumference, and T2D hazard. Adjusted for sex, those excluded were margin-
ally, although statistically, older than those included. Adjusted for age and sex, there were no
differences in cycling exposure, waist circumference, and T2D hazard between included and
excluded participants.
Associated risk of T2D according to level of commuter cycling is shown in Table 4. Multi-
variable adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.72 (0.60,0.87), 0.83 (0.69,1.00), and 0.70 (0.57,0.85)
(p for trend = <0.001) for 0, 1–60, 61–150, and >150 min/wk of commuter cycling, respec-
tively. When waist circumference at the second examination was added to the model, the asso-
ciations were attenuated; HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.77 (0.64,0.92), 0.92 (0.76,1.11), and 0.78

Adjustment for BMI at the second examination attenuated the strength of the associations as
well, and HRs (95% CI) were 1, 0.73 (0.61,0.88), 0.91 (0.76,1.10), and 0.79 (0.64,0.96) (p for
trend = 0.023) for 0, 1–60, 61–150, and >150 min/wk of commuter cycling.
Of those eligible for analysis of commuter cycling and risk of T2D, 5,811 were excluded due
to being missing in either covariates or exposure variables. As with the previous analysis, we
compared those excluded with those included in terms of age, cycling exposure, waist circum-
ference, and T2D hazard. Adjusted for sex, those excluded were marginally, but statistically,
older compared to those included. Those who were excluded reported significantly higher
amount of cycling to work, but were not different in waist circumference and did not differ in
T2D hazard compared to those who were included when adjusted for age and sex.
Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study among Danish men and women residing in
cycling-friendly cities, recreational and commuter cycling was associated with lower risk of
T2D, and mostly in a dose-response manner, according to weekly time spent on cycling and
seasonal engagement in cycling. The results of our study also suggest that initiation or continu-
ation of cycling habits from baseline to the second examination was associated with significant
T2D risk reduction compared to no cycling in the same time period. Our investigation sug-
gested that adiposity partly mediated the associations between cycling on T2D risk.
This study expands the large body of evidence showing that physical activity is associated
with a lower risk of T2D [8] by showing an association for cycling specifically. The finding that
increased total cycling was associated with lowered T2D risk adds to evidence from prospective
studies that have compared cyclists and non-cyclists free of chronic disease, which have found
no relationship [13,14], and expands upon evidence from cross-sectional studies that have
reported lower prevalence of T2D associated with total cycling engagement [9,10]. The positive
associations between commuter cycling and T2D builds upon evidence from a Finnish pro-
spective study, which found positive associations between commuter walking and cycling
pooled and T2D [32], and cross-sectional studies that have found a positive association
between commuter cycling and risk of diabetes [11,12]. Specifically, in a sample representative
of the United Kingdom, odds ratio of diabetes (95% CI) when comparing commuter cyclists
and those who reported private transport was 0.50 (0.27, 0.93) [11]. Also, among participants

 in the Indian Migration Study, it was shown that commuter cycling for 0, 1–29, and >30 min/
d was associated with 1, 0.66 (0.44,0.98), and 0.48 (0.23,0.96) lower risk of diabetes, respectively
[12]. Although not systematic, our extensive literature search in PubMed (MEDLINE) and
Embase for this study found no other studies that investigated the association between seasonal
cycling, as well as changes in cycling over time, on T2D risk. Those who cycled all year consis-
tently had a lower risk of T2D compared to non-cyclists and seasonal cyclists, plausibly
explained simply by the observed higher levels of cycling among those cycling all year. How-
ever, the associations did not change substantially after adjustment for amount of cycling dur-
ing summer and/or winter, which indicates a benefit of cycling consistently throughout
summer and winter, compared to cycling in either season only.
In the analyses of changes in total cycling over time, we found that those who took up
cycling later in life had a 20% lower risk of T2D compared to those who consistently were non-
cyclists. This is especially interesting due to the relatively old age of the participants at baseline.
If people in late adulthood could be encouraged to start cycling habitually, the effects in terms
of decreased risk may have enormous public health implications, e.g., by lowering health care
expenses from treatment and care. In light of the global growing elderly population [33], such
encouragement should be a central component in current and future health promotion initia-
tives for this population group. We also found that cycling consistently was associated with the
largest decrease in risk and that ceasing cycling was associated with no decreased risk. Initia-
tives should thus also encourage consistent cycling throughout late adulthood and into elderly
life, as well as aim to prevent cyclists from giving up cycling when approaching elderly age.
Several biological mechanisms may explain the lower risk of T2D from engaging in cycling.
A trial of obese women who commuted to work found that cycling reduced fasting insulin lev-
els after 6 mo [34]. An outdoor bicycle-based intervention in young men cycling 45 min/d for
6 wk found improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion, and a
tendency for decreases in fasting insulin (p = 0.07) [35]. In addition, exercise interventions in
adults with cycle ergometers have found improvements in glucose metabolism [36–40], includ-
ing decreased fasting insulin [36,38], increased insulin sensitivity [36,39], and decreased c-pep-
tide levels [37]. However, such controlled cycling conditions may not perfectly reflect cycling
in natural settings. Furthermore, a cross-sectional study found lower odds of glucose intoler-
ance with higher reported cycling [41]. Therefore, based on findings from interventions that
include either free-living or stationary cycling, as well as the results from a cross-sectional
study, cycling may prevent the development of T2D by improving glucose metabolism and
maintaining blood glucose within normal ranges.
A lower risk of T2D may also be explained by decreases in adiposity as a result of habitual
cycling. This is supported by lower risk of overweightness and obesity among commuter
cyclists observed in cross-sectional studies [11,12] and from findings in randomized controlled
trials of isolated aerobic exercise in which modest reductions in weight and waist circumference
were induced [42]. In the current study, when we included measures of adiposity in the regres-
sion models, the associations were strongly and consistently attenuated, suggesting a mediating
role of adiposity in the relation between cycling and T2D. However, some significance was con-
served even after adjustment for waist circumference or BMI, indicating that some of the asso-
ciations were independent of adiposity. It is also possible that overweightness causes cessation
of cycling, since previous studies suggest that adiposity also determines habitual physical activ-
ity [43], and, as a consequence, cycling exposure level may reflect previous development of adi-
posity. Because the measures of adiposity and cycling engagement were obtained at the same
time point in our study, it is difficult to further explain the directionality of the relationships.
Lastly, it is not clear whether adiposity is a confounder or a mediator in the relationship
between cycling and T2D.

 Several observations in our study support that the current associations are causal: there is a
temporal arrangement, i.e., cycling precedes documentation of T2D; there are observed biolog-
ical mechanisms that may explain the associations; the associations show mostly dose-response
relationships; the lower risk is not maintained when cycling is ceased, i.e., cessation of cycling
is associated with no decreased risk compared to continuation of cycling; and, lastly, similar
findings have been reported previously. More research is needed, however, before a claim
about causality is fully supported.
The current findings have substantial clinical relevance. Those who find difficulty in walk-
ing or jogging, e.g., obese subjects who are at increased risk of musculoskeletal complications
[44], may experience health benefits from cycling, a non-weight bearing activity, despite their
limitations.
In pragmatic intervention studies, summarised in a systematic review from 2010, it has pre-
viously been investigated how to promote cycling. Some studies have intervened by improving
infrastructure, and others have focused on community-wide promotional activities, and mod-
est increases in cycling have been found. Consistent positive findings have been found in stud-
ies that use individualised marketing to promote cycling. However, from a methodological
standpoint, additional and more robust studies are warranted to more clearly establish how to
effectively promote cycling [45]. The positive findings from studies that aim to promote
cycling, combined with results from observational and small-scale experimental studies, which
have shown that cycling may be valuable for chronic disease prevention, may suggest that
national and local government should prioritise resources to promote cycling, e.g., making
improvements in infrastructure to make urban and rural environments more cycling-friendly.
This may be especially important in countries where the built environment is less compatible
with cycling as a mode of transportation and recreation.
Strengths of the current study include using data from a large cohort study with a long
period of follow-up, with many documented cases of T2D gathered objectively by a validated
method. Limitations include use of self-reported physical activity data and, therefore, potential
systematic bias and random error in estimation of exposure levels. Also, we cannot characterise
documented diabetes cases according to type, although they are interpreted as T2D, since
adult-onset type 1 diabetes has been found to be low in similar populations [29,30]. There may
also be some limitations in terms of generalizability; the cohort is composed of Caucasian men
and women 50–65 y of age at baseline, which may limit the extent to which the findings can be
generalized to other ethnicities and younger populations. A limitation in the analyses is that
11,458 and 5,811 participants were excluded due to being missing in either exposure variables
or covariates, in the analysis of changes in total cycling and commuter cycling, respectively.
Although those excluded were significantly, albeit marginally, older, and although those
excluded from the analysis of commuter cycling and T2D risk reported more cycling to work,
there were no differences in T2D hazard in either of the analyses. Concern about bias due to
selection from the exclusion of participants with missing data is therefore not considered a
threat to internal validity. Another limitation in the analyses was the method applied for impu-
tation of data. Multiple imputation is a well-accepted imputation strategy, which would have
allowed for more data in the analyses [46]. Lastly, residual confounding or unknown con-
founding cannot be ruled out, although many known confounders were controlled for, which,
when included in the models, consistently attenuated strengths of the associations.
In summary, in this prospective study in a large cohort of Danish men and women, we
found that recreational and commuter cycling was associated with a lower risk of T2D, and we
observed mostly dose–response relationships. Also, cycling all year was associated with a lower
risk of T2D compared to no cycling and seasonal cycling, even after adjustment for total
amount of cycling. Furthermore, continuation of cycling, as well as initiation of cycling, was

 associated with a substantial lower risk of T2D compared to no cycling. Because positive associ-
ations were found consistently across different approaches to analysing cycling, this adds to the
robustness of the findings. Based on the results of this study, it seems beneficial to encourage
adults of middle and old to engage in commuter and recreational cycling to prevent the devel-
opment of T2D in late adulthood. Future cohort studies should investigate associations
between cycling and T2D risk in other population groups, and experimental studies of cycling
in natural settings should be conducted to further examine the possibility of effectively imple-
menting habitual cycling in T2D prevention.
