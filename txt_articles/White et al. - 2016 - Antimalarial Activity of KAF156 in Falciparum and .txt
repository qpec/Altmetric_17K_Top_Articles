Abstract
Background—KAF156 belongs to a new class of antimalarial agents (imidazolopiperazines), 
with activity against asexual and sexual blood stages and the preerythrocytic liver stages of 
malarial parasites.
Methods—We conducted a phase 2, open-label, two-part study at five centers in Thailand and 
Vietnam to assess the antimalarial efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of KAF156 in 
adults with acute Plasmodium vivax or P. falciparum malaria. Assessment of parasite clearance 
rates in cohorts of patients with vivax or falciparum malaria who were treated with multiple doses 
(400 mg once daily for 3 days) was followed by assessment of the cure rate at 28 days in a 
separate cohort of patients with falciparum malaria who received a single dose (800 mg).
Results—Median parasite clearance times were 45 hours (interquartile range, 42 to 48) in 10 
patients with falciparum malaria and 24 hours (interquartile range, 20 to 30) in 10 patients with 
vivax malaria after treatment with the multiple-dose regimen and 49 hours (interquartile range, 42 
to 54) in 21 patients with falciparum malaria after treatment with the single dose. Among the 21

 patients who received the single dose and were followed for 28 days, 1 had reinfection and 7 had 
recrudescent infections (cure rate, 67%; 95% credible interval, 46 to 84). The mean (±SD) 
KAF156 terminal elimination half-life was 44.1±8.9 hours. There were no serious adverse events 
in this small study. The most common adverse events included sinus bradycardia, 
thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Vomiting of grade 2 or higher 
occurred in 2 patients, 1 of whom discontinued treatment because of repeated vomiting after 
receiving the single 800-mg dose. More adverse events were reported in the single-dose cohort, 
which had longer follow-up, than in the multiple-dose cohorts.
Conclusions—KAF156 showed antimalarial activity without evident safety concerns in a small 
number of adults with uncomplicated P. vivax or P. falciparum malaria. (Funded by Novartis and 
others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01753323.)
EXPANDING ARTEMISININ RESISTANCE and worsening partner-drug resistance in Southeast Asia 
threaten the global control of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.1–5 New drugs are needed. 
KAF156 represents a new class of antimalarial agents (imidazolopiperazines)6 identified by 
high-throughput phenotypic screening. KAF156 has potent in vitro activity against both 
asexual and sexual blood stages and the preerythrocytic liver stages of the malarial parasite.7 
The mechanism of antimalarial action is unknown, but drug resistance, mediated by 
mutations in the P. falciparum cyclic amine resistance locus (PfCARL) gene, which encodes 
a protein of unknown function, can be selected.7 In a study of 70 healthy adult volunteers,6 
KAF156 was rapidly absorbed and had an elimination half-life of between 42.5 and 70.7 
hours, without evident safety concerns. We assessed KAF156 in a phase 2, open-label study 
at five centers in Thailand and Vietnam.
Methods
Study Design and Overview
We evaluated the efficacy and safety of KAF156 in a two-step process. First, 400 mg of 
KAF156 was given once daily for 3 days to patients with uncomplicated vivax malaria 
(cohort 1) or falciparum malaria (cohort 2) in order to assess the safety and initial 
antimalarial efficacy of the study drug. Next, patients in cohort 3, a separate group of 
patients with falciparum malaria, were treated with a single 800-mg dose of KAF156 in 
order to assess the cure rate at 28 days and the potential for a single-dose cure.
The study was sponsored by Novartis and was part of the Wellcome Trust–Mahidol 
University–Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme. The study was approved by the 
ethics committee at each participating institution and by the Oxford Tropical Research 
Ethics Committee. All study participants provided written informed consent. Novartis 
designed the study and collected and analyzed the data. All the authors contributed to the 
design and execution of the study and the analysis and interpretation of the clinical and 
laboratory data. The last author wrote the first draft of the manuscript and, along with the

 Patients
We recruited patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, in Bangkok; the Shoklo Malaria 
Research Unit and Mae Ramat District Hospital, both of which are close to the northwestern 
border of Thailand; Phusing Hospital, in eastern Thailand; and the National Institute for 
Malariology, Parasitology, and Entomology, in Hanoi. Eligible patients were 20 to 60 years 
of age and had a body weight between 40 and 90 kg, with fever or a history of fever and 
microscopy-confirmed P. vivax or P. falciparum monoinfection (asexual-stage parasite count, 
5000 to 60,000 per cubic millimeter in the multiple-dose cohort and 1000 to 70,000 per 
cubic millimeter in the single-dose cohort). Women of childbearing potential were excluded. 
Additional exclusion criteria were severe or complicated malaria,5 infection with mixed 
plasmodium species, a hemoglobin level of less than 9.0 g per deciliter, schizontemia, severe 
vomiting, receipt of antimalarial treatment within the previous 14 days or treatment with any 
investigational drug within the previous 30 days, a history of cancer, chronic liver disease, 
severe malnutrition, or clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormalities (corrected 
QT interval [calculated with the use of Fridericia’s formula], >450 msec for men and >470 
msec for women).
Treatment and Procedures
Patients were admitted to an inpatient facility for close monitoring. For both the multiple-
dose and single-dose regimens, KAF156 was given orally with water. The dose was repeated 
if the patient vomited within 45 minutes after the initial administration. In the multiple-dose 
cohorts, standard antimalarial treatment (artesunate plus mefloquine for P. falciparum 
malaria or chloroquine plus primaquine for P. vivax infection) was started on day 5 (or 
earlier if there was evidence of worsening symptoms) as a precautionary measure because 
this was the first use of KAF156 in patients with malaria. After confirmation of efficacy with 
multiple doses, standard antimalarial treatment was not given in the single-dose cohort, 
unless parasitemia recurred, in order to allow assessment of the cure rate at 28 days.
Clinical observations, vital signs, and symptoms were recorded, and thick and thin blood 
smears were obtained every 4 hours for 24 hours and then every 6 hours, until two 
consecutive negative readings had been obtained. Fever clearance was defined as at least two 
consecutive normal body-temperature measurements. Parasite counts per 1000 red cells were 
reported for thin-film smears, and parasite counts per 200 white cells (or per 500 white cells 
if the count was <10 parasites) were reported for thick-film smears.
Efficacy and Safety Assessments
The primary efficacy measure in the multiple-dose cohorts was the parasite clearance time: 
the interval from the first dose to the first of two consecutive negative blood slides. In the 
single-dose cohort, efficacy was assessed both as the parasite clearance time and as the cure 
rate at 28 days, confirmed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction genotyping. Safety was 
evaluated on the basis of daily assessments of symptoms, as well as clinical examination, 
predose and postdose electrocardiograms, and hematologic, blood chemical, and urine 
testing at screening; on days 2, 3, and 5; and at study completion, defined as day 11 in the 
multiple-dose cohorts and as day 29 in the single-dose cohort. The National Cancer Institute

 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,8 version 4.0, was used for grading the 
severity of adverse events.
Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples for KAF156 plasma concentration measurements were collected before dose 
administration (0 hour); at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dose administration on 
days 1 and 3; and at 36, 48, 96, 144, and 192 hours after the last dose had been administered. 
Urine was collected and volumes were recorded on days 1 and 3 before drug administration 
and then between 0 and 24 hours and again between 24 and 48 hours in the single-dose 
cohort. KAF156 levels in plasma and urine were analyzed with the use of a validated high-
performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry method with a lower limit of 
quantification of 1 ng per milliliter in plasma and 1000 ng per milliliter in urine. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of KAF156 were determined by means of noncompartmental 
methods with the use of Phoenix WinNonLin, version 6.2 (Certara).
Molecular Markers
The P. falciparum isolates obtained at admission and during episodes of recrudescence were 
sequenced fully. The genetic sequences were examined for mutations in the P. falciparum 
gene encoding the propeller region of the kelch protein K13 that are associated with 
artemisinin resistance,9 mutations in PfCRT and PfMDR that are associated with resistance 
to aminoquinolines, and mutations in PfCARL that are associated with resistance to 
KAF156.7
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that in the multiple-dose cohorts, 20 patients (10 per cohort) would provide 
more than 88% power to observe a median parasite clearance time of less than 96 hours, 
assuming a true value of less than 80 hours with a range of plausible coefficients of 
variation. The sample size for the single-dose cohort was not formally calculated to provide 
a specified power but instead was chosen on the basis of a target for the observed cure rate 
of 50% or higher. We estimated that with a sample of 20 patients, the probability of meeting 
this target would be 75% or higher, assuming a true underlying cure rate of 55% or higher, 
and that the probability would be 11% or less, assuming a true cure rate of less than 35%. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, time-to-event end points were analyzed with the use of the 
Kaplan–Meier method. Parasite clearance half-lives, estimated with the Worldwide 
Antimalarial Resistance Network parasite clearance estimator,10,11 were compared with 
those observed after treatment with artemisinin derivatives in studies conducted in Southeast 
Asia, in which six hourly (or more frequent than hourly) parasite counts were performed. 
For the cure rates in the single-dose cohort, 95% Bayesian credible intervals are provided on 
the basis of a noninformative beta prior distribution (meaning that before we recruited any 
patients, we believed that a cure rate above 50% was just as likely as a cure rate of 50% or 
lower).

 Results
Study Patients
From March to August 2013, a total of 21 adults with acute uncomplicated malaria (11 with 
P. vivax malaria and 10 with P. falciparum malaria) were enrolled in the multiple-dose 
cohorts, and 22 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled in the 
single-dose cohort. Baseline characteristics of the patients are provided in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. Baseline parasitemia ranged from 5077 to 
24,160 per cubic millimeter in the patients with P. vivax malaria and from 1901 to 59,405 
per cubic millimeter in those with P. falciparum malaria. Two patients were excluded from 
the efficacy and pharmacokinetic analyses: 1 patient with P. vivax malaria, in whom a mixed 
infection was detected after receipt of 400 mg of KAF156, and 1 patient with P. falciparum 
malaria, who had repeated vomiting within 45 minutes after receiving 800 mg of KAF156; 
two further attempts at dose administration were also unsuccessful because of vomiting.
Fever and Parasite Clearance
The median fever clearance times after receipt of KAF156 were 14 hours (range, 4 to 30) in 
the patients with P. vivax malaria and 6 hours (range, 4 to 24) in those with P. falciparum 
malaria in the multiple-dose cohorts and 4 hours (range, 4 to 66) in the single-dose cohort. 
In one recipient of the single 800-mg dose, parasitemia resolved by 66 hours after dose 
administration but recurred asymptomatically at 84 hours. In all the other patients, 
parasitemia cleared. In the multiple-dose cohorts, the median parasite clearance time was 24 
hours (interquartile range, 20 to 30; range, 16 to 36) in the patients with vivax malaria and 
45 hours (interquartile range, 42 to 48; range, 36 to 66) in those with falciparum malaria; in 
the single-dose cohort, the median clearance time was 49 hours (interquartile range, 42 to 
54; range, 16 to 68) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The mean log10 parasite reduction ratio at 48 hours 
was 3.49 (range, 3.10 to 3.78) among patients with vivax malaria and 3.18 (range, 1.51 to 
3.85) among those with falciparum malaria in the multiple-dose cohorts and 3.17 (range, 
2.27 to 4.06) in the single-dose cohort. Corresponding median parasite clearance half-lives 
in the three cohorts were 1.9 hours (interquartile range, 1.5 to 2.1; range, 0.9 to 2.7), 3.5 
hours (interquartile range, 3.4 to 3.8; range, 2.8 to 5.1), and 3.4 hours (interquartile range, 
3.2 to 4.1; range, 1.4 to 7.2).
Among the 21 patients with P. falciparum malaria who received the single 800-mg dose and 
were followed for 28 days, 1 had reinfection and 7 had recrudescent infections (cure rate, 
67%; 95% credible interval, 46 to 84). Gametocytemia was detected in 2 patients with P. 
vivax malaria at baseline and cleared in both patients by 16 hours after receipt of KAF156. 
Among the patients with P. falciparum malaria, 1 patient had gametocytemia from baseline 
to 54 hours after dose administration and 1 had intermittent gametocytemia from baseline 
until 72 hours after dose administration. In addition, 2 patients had post-treatment 
gametocytemia: 1 had a single positive reading at 24 hours, and the other had positive 
readings from 12 to 96 hours (16 gametocytes per cubic millimeter at the last reading), at 
which time sampling ceased.

 Adverse Events
Most patients had at least one adverse event. A total of 31 of the 43 patients (72%) had grade 
1 events; 35% had grade 2 events, and 14% had grade 3 events (Table 2). No grade 4 or 
serious adverse events were noted. One patient discontinued treatment (because of repeated 
vomiting after receipt of the 800-mg single dose).
In the two cohorts that received multiple lower doses of KAF156, nausea and vomiting 
occurred once each among the patients with P. falciparum malaria, whereas in the cohort that 
received a single higher dose, 4 patients (18%) had nausea and 6 (27%) had vomiting. 
Overall, there were more adverse events after the single 800-mg dose than after multiple 
400-mg doses. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia (heart rate, <60 beats per minute) was the 
most common adverse event and was reported in a total of 13 patients (62%) in cohorts 1 
and 2 and in 14 patients (64%) in cohort 3. Overall, plasma potassium values ranged from 
2.8 to 4.7 mmol per liter. Hypokalemia was recorded as an adverse event in 11 patients 
(50%) in cohort 3 but was not considered to be drugrelated.
Post-treatment elevation of the alanine aminotransferase levels, ranging from 41 to 136 U 
per liter, occurred in seven patients (33%) in the multiple-dose cohorts (grade 1 in six 
patients and grade 2 in one); in two of the patients (one in each cohort), the elevation was 
reported as an adverse event. At the end of the study (day 11), six of the patients continued 
to have elevated levels. In the single-dose cohort, six patients (27%) had post-treatment 
elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels, ranging from 46 to 126 U per liter. In five of 
the patients (23%), the elevation was considered to be a drug-related adverse event (grade 1 
in four patients and grade 2 in one). At the end of the study, three of the patients still had 
elevated levels.
Post-treatment elevations in aspartate aminotransferase levels (all grade 1) occurred in seven 
patients (33%) in the multiple-dose cohorts (range, 41 to 115 U per liter) and in six patients 
(27%) in the single-dose cohort (range, 38 to 49 U per liter). One elevation (cohort 2) was 
reported as an adverse event. At the end of the study, two patients in cohort 2 and four 
patients in cohort 3 still had elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels.
In 1 patient with falciparum malaria who received multiple doses of KAF156, the 
hemoglobin level fell from 9.1 g per deciliter to 6.8 g per deciliter on day 2 (grade 3 event), 
fluctuated during the study, was 6.6 g per deciliter on day 11, but was normal 2 weeks later. 
In 2 patients in the single-dose cohort who had anemia at baseline (hemoglobin level, 10.6 g 
per deciliter and 10.5 g per deciliter), the hemoglobin level fell further after receipt of the 
study drug (hemoglobin level, 8.4 g per deciliter and 7.7 g per deciliter, respectively), 
constituting grade 2 events, but improved by day 11 (11.6 g per deciliter and 10.8 g per 
deciliter, respectively). The 2 patients declined further follow-up. Overall, 12 of 21 patients 
(57%) in the multiple-dose cohorts and 5 of 22 (23%) in the single-dose cohort had anemia.
In all, 60% of adverse events were considered to be drug-related. The percentage was higher 
in the single-dose cohort (65%) than in the multiple-dose cohorts (45%).

 Pharmacokinetics
The median time from the administration of KAF156 to the maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) was approximately 3 hours on both day 1 and day 3, with an overall mean (±SD) 
terminal elimination half-life of 44.1±8.9 hours (Table 3 and Fig. 2, and Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic profiles was 
relatively low for an antimalarial drug, with coefficients of variation of 20 to 30% for Cmax 
and the area under the curve during a 24-hour period (AUC0-24) in all three cohorts. The 
mean accumulation ratios (calculated as the AUC0-24 on day 3 divided by the AUC0-24 on 
day 1) were 2.16 and 2.15 after daily dose administration for 3 days in cohorts 1 and 2, 
respectively; these values were consistent with those predicted from the elimination half-life. 
The pharmacokinetic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24) on day 3 after the administration of 
multiple doses was similar in the two multiple-dose cohorts and was also similar to the 
pharmacokinetic exposure after the administration of a single 800-mg dose. Less than 10% 
of the administered dose was excreted unchanged in urine during the collection intervals.
Molecular Markers of Resistance
In the baseline and recrudescence samples, 14 of 31 P. falciparum infections had 
nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the K13 gene, 10 of which 
were the C580Y mutation strongly associated with artemisinin resistance (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Parasite clearance times and rates were similar in infections with 
and those without these molecular markers (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). For 
28 of the 31 isolates from the patients with P. falciparum malaria, there was sufficient 
coverage of the PfCARL gene. For each of the 28 isolates, there was either one of eight 
distinct, nonsynonymous SNPs or one of three insertions or deletions in PfCARL, as 
compared with the 3D7 reference genome (Table S3 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). None of those polymorphisms overlapped with any of the previously identified 
mutations conferring drug resistance to KAF156,7 and parasite clearance rates did not differ 
according to the PfCARL polymorphisms identified (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Discussion
New antimalarial drugs are needed as artemisinin resistance spreads in Southeast Asia and 
partner-drug resistance follows.12–14 Untreatable falciparum malaria would reverse many 
of the substantial gains in malaria control and elimination that have been made in recent 
years. The imidazolopiperazine KAF156 represents a new class of antimalarial agent with 
both preerythrocytic and blood-stage activity. In this study of the antimalarial activity of 
KAF156 in humans, signs and symptoms of illness resolved and parasitemia cleared rapidly 
in patients with vivax malaria and in those with falciparum malaria, including infections 
with artemisinin-resistant parasites. The rates of parasite clearance after treatment with 
KAF156 were slightly slower than those associated with artemisinin treatment in sensitive 
infections and were substantially slower than the rates associated with spiroindolone 
KAE609 (cipargamin) treatment, which provides the fastest parasite clearance recorded so 
far,15 but they were more rapid than the rates associated with treatment with sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine, atovaquone–proguanil, quinine, or mefloquine in susceptible infections.

 Antimalarial drugs that are eliminated rapidly (terminal elimination half-life, <3 days) 
usually cannot cure falciparum malaria in a single dose,1 so an overall 28-day cure rate, 
adjusted for the parasite clearance rate, of 67% after a single dose of KAF156 suggests 
clinically significant in vivo potency. By comparison, cure rates after short courses of 
artemisinin derivatives (<5 days) are typically less than 80%.16–18 However, as with all 
antimalarial agents, it is expected that KAF156 would become part of a combination 
regimen for the treatment of malaria. Therapeutic responses to KAF156 (assessed as the 
parasite clearance time and 28-day cure rate) were similar in patients with the PfMDR, 
PfCRT, and K13 mutations associated with either aminoquinoline or artemisinin resistance. 
These data suggest that KAF156 should be effective against infections resistant to all 
currently available antimalarial drugs. None of the patients in our study, including those with 
recrudescent infections, had parasite isolates bearing the PfCARL mutations that are 
associated with the selection of KAF156 resistance in experimental studies.
Thirteen of the 21 patients who received multiple 400-mg doses of KAF156 and all 22 
patients who received a single 800-mg dose had at least one adverse event. One patient who 
received the single 800-mg dose had repeated vomiting and was withdrawn from the study. 
Five other patients vomited after receiving the single 800-mg dose, as compared with 1 
patient with P. falciparum malaria in the multiple-dose cohort. Four patients who received 
the single 800-mg dose reported nausea, as compared with 1 patient with P. falciparum 
malaria in the multiple-dose cohort. Between 27% and 33% of all the patients in all three 
cohorts had mild post-treatment elevations in aminotransferase levels (maximum elevation, 
136 U per liter). Overall, the 3-day regimen of multiple 400-mg doses was associated with 
fewer adverse events than the single 800-mg dose. Anemia is common in patients with 
malaria. In our study, anemia that worsened from baseline or that developed during 
treatment had resolved or improved by the end of the study.
The pharmacokinetic properties of KAF156 varied relatively little between patients and were 
similar to the values reported previously in healthy volunteers.6 The therapeutic responses 
were uniformly rapid. No clear relationship between drug exposure (measured as Cmax or 
AUC0-24) and the initial parasitologic response (measured as the parasite clearance time or 
parasite clearance half-life) was established for either the multiple-dose or single-dose 
regimen. Of the 7 patients with recrudescent P. falciparum infections after receipt of a single 
dose, only 2 had total KAF156 plasma concentrations above 58 ng per milliliter (more than 
twice the 99% inhibitory concentration) for 6 days (three asexual cycles), as compared with 
10 of the 13 patients who did not have a recrudescence.
In conclusion, our study showed that KAF156, a new antimalarial drug, has activity against 
vivax and falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant parasites.

 Figure 1. Parasite Counts in the Multiple-Dose and Single-Dose Cohorts.
Shown are individual parasite counts from screening until parasite clearance in patients with 
Plasmodium vivax malaria (cohort 1) or P. falciparum malaria (cohort 2) who received 
KAF156 at a dose of 400 mg daily for 3 days (Panel A) and patients with P. falciparum 
malaria who received a single 800-mg dose (cohort 3) (Panel B). Each line represents an 
individual patient. In each cohort, the solid vertical line indicates the median parasite 
clearance time.

*The multiple-dose regimen, consisting of three 400-mg doses of KAF156, was administered to patients with P. vivax malaria (cohort 1) and those 
with P. falciparum malaria (cohort 2). The single-dose regimen was an 800-mg dose administered to patients with P. falciparum malaria (cohort 3). 
One patient in cohort 1 was excluded owing to a mixed infection, and one patient in cohort 3 was excluded because of vomiting within 45 minutes 
after dose administration.
†The median parasite clearance half-life was estimated in a separate analysis with the use of the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network

*In the multiple-dose cohorts, 14 of 31 adverse events (45%), reported in 7 patients (1 with P. vivax malaria and 6 with P. falciparum malaria), were 
considered by the investigator to be drug-related. All 22 patients with P. falciparum malaria who were treated with a single dose had at least 1 
adverse event that was considered to be related to the study medication. Overall, 60% of adverse events were considered to be drug-related; the 
proportion was higher in the single-dose cohort (65%) than in the multiple-dose cohorts (45%).
†The patient vomited repeatedly during the 45-minute postdose period and was withdrawn from the study after two further attempts at dose 
administration were also unsuccessful because of vomiting.
‡Adverse events are listed according to the preferred terms in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 4.0. The most frequently reported grade 2 or 3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and anemia. 
Patients with multiple occurrences of an adverse event were counted only once in the adverse-event category. No grade 4 or serious adverse events 
were noted.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Pharmacokinetic data were not available for one patient in cohort 1. Four patients in the single-dose cohort 
were excluded from the analysis of pharmacokinetic properties because of vomiting within 3 hours after dose administration. AUC0-24 denotes the 
area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to 24 hours, AUC0-inf the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 
0 to infinity, AUC0-last the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, CL/F the 
apparent clearance of the drug after oral dosing, Cmax the observed maximum plasma concentration after drug administration, CV the coefficient 
of variation, Tmax the time from drug administration to Cmax, and Vz/F the apparent volume of distribution after oral dosing.
†The accumulation ratio is the AUC0-24 on day 3 divided by the AUC0-24 on day 1.
