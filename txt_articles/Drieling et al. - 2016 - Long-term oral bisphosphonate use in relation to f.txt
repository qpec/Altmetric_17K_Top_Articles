Abstract
OBJECTIVE—To examine the association of long-term oral bisphosphonate use, compared with 
short-term use, with fracture risk among postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
METHODS—We studied 887 postmenopausal women who were enrolled to the Women’s Health 
Initiative from 1993 to 1998, diagnosed with breast cancer after enrollment, and reported current 
oral bisphosphonate use of two years or more on a medication inventory administered in 2008–9.

 The outcome of any clinical fracture was ascertained by self-report on an annual study form; a 
subset of fractures was confirmed with medical records. Women were followed from completion 
of the medication inventory until 2014. The association between duration of bisphosphonate use 
reported on the medication inventory and fracture was estimated using multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards survival models that compared 4–7 years and eight or more years of 
bisphosphonate use with 2–3 years of use.
RESULTS—On average women were 76 years of age and were followed for 3.7 (SD: 1.1) years. 
There were 142 clinical fractures. In analysis, multivariate-adjusted for fracture risk factors, eight 
or more years of bisphosphonate use was associated with higher risk of fracture compared with 2–
3 years of use (HR: 1.67 [1.06–2.62]). There was no significant association of 4–7 years of use 
with fracture.
CONCLUSIONS—Bisphosphonate use of eight or more years was associated with higher risk of 
any clinical fracture compared with 2–3 years of use. Our findings raise concern about potential 
harm or decreased effectiveness of long-term bisphosphonate use on fracture risk. The findings 
warrant confirmatory studies.

INTRODUCTION
The risks of breast cancer and osteoporotic fracture both increase with age.1–3 One in eight 
women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime3 and one in two women will 
experience an osteoporotic fracture after age 50.1 Due to some cancer treatments, women 
with breast cancer experience osteoporotic fracture at higher rates than women without 
cancer.4 An estimated 232,670 new cases of breast cancer occurred in 2014 and 90% of 
women with breast cancer survive at least five years after diagnosis.3 Thus, fracture risk 
management is an important aspect of continuing care for postmenopausal women with 
breast cancer.5
Bisphosphonates, the most commonly prescribed osteoporosis medication, have been shown 
in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to increase bone mineral density (BMD) among women 
with low BMD.5–8 A Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of 11 RCTs of alendronate, the 
most commonly prescribed bisphosphonate, concluded that one to four years of therapy may 
prevent fractures in a subgroup of women with higher fracture risk at commencement of 
treatment.9 In 2011, based on findings of harms and lack of evidence for efficacy after 
review of all RCTs of long-term bisphosphonate use (>3–5 years), the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) recommended that long-term bisphosphonate users be routinely 
evaluated for the appropriateness of continued therapy.10–13 The 2011 FDA review included 
women who had used bisphosphonates for up to 10 years and noted that fracture rates were 
similar during earlier and later periods of bisphosphonate use.10 However, the FDA did not 
examine differences in fracture risk by duration of bisphosphonate exposure in many 
subgroups, and called for more research in specific populations at higher risk.10 Specifically,

 there is a lack of information about long-term bisphosphonate use in postmenopausal 
women with breast cancer.9–11,14
The relationship of long-term bisphosphonate use with fracture risk requires specific 
research in the postmenopausal breast cancer population, because many women with breast 
cancer have used endocrine therapy including tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor 
modulator (SERM), and aromatase inhibitors, both of which affect fracture risk.4,5,15,16 
Tamoxifen prevents breast cancer recurrence by blocking estrogen from binding with 
estrogen receptors and has an estrogenic effect in bone, leading to lower fracture risk.17,18 
Aromatase inhibitors prevent recurrence by inhibiting the conversion of androgen to 
estrogen, but also deprive bone of estrogen, which increases fracture risk; however, risk 
following aromatase inhibitor termination rapidly returns to baseline.5,19
To date, the association of long-term bisphosphonate use with fracture has not been studied 
in this high-risk population.20 In 2008–9, 21% of 5,689 postmenopausal Women’s Health 
Initiative (WHI) participants with breast cancer reported current use of oral bisphosphonates. 
Using data from the WHI, we examined the use of long-term compared with short-term 
bisphosphonate therapy in relationship to fracture among postmenopausal women with 
breast cancer.
METHODS
Study Population
The WHI is an ongoing longitudinal research study with primary aims to develop strategies 
that reduce cardiovascular disease, cancer, and bone fracture occurrence in postmenopausal 
women who were aged 50–79 at enrollment. In 1993 to 1998, the WHI recruited 68,132 
women to participate in RCTs and 93,676 women to participate in an observational study 
(OS). The RCTs included studies evaluating estrogen alone, estrogen and progestin, dietary 
modification, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The RCTs and OS were 
conducted between 1993 and 2005.21 The WHI study design and methods have been 
described in detail elsewhere.22–24 Of 150,076 participants who were active at the end of the 
RCTs and OS, 115,407 consented to participate in the WHI Extension Studies that began in 
2005. Breast cancers were initially identified by self-report on an annual health events form 
and confirmed by physician review of medical records.24 In 2008–09, the WHI administered 
a mailed current medication inventory form and a breast health form, which asked about 
history of endocrine therapy for breast cancer, to all active WHI participants with a breast 
cancer diagnosis made following WHI enrollment. A total of 5,689 women completed both 
forms (see Flowchart, Supplemental Digital Content 1, that presents the timeline for 
enrollment, active phase of the studies, and collection of the 2008–9 medication inventory 
and breast health questionnaires).
In the subset of women who completed both forms and reported current oral bisphosphonate 
use of 2 years or more, we analyzed the association of longer duration of use (4–7, ≥ 8 
years) with fracture, using shorter duration of use (2–3 years) as the referent group. We 
included only women who reported at least two years of oral bisphosphonate use to limit the 
analysis to women who persisted in medication use and whom we presume had a clinical

 indication for oral bisphosphonate use. To compare long-term use with short-term use, we 
chose 2–3 years as the referent group because shorter duration of use has been associated 
with lower fracture risk and we chose 4–7 and 8 or more years of use because longer 
duration of use may be associated with higher fracture risk.9,10 We excluded one woman 
who had used parathyroid hormone, a medication that affects bone metabolism. 
Additionally, we excluded 22 women who had stopped and then resumed bisphosphonate 
use prior to the 2008–9 medication inventory. After exclusions, 887 women were included in 
the analysis of long-term bisphosphonate use in relation to fracture.
Exposure Ascertainment
Duration of bisphosphonate use was self-reported on the 2008–9 medication inventory form 
which instructed participants to record information from the labels of all current medication 
prescription labels including the drug name, strength, and type (capsule, tablet, etc.), and to 
report the duration of use (< 1 month, 1–12 months, or number of years).25
Covariates
Covariates were selected a priori based on literature review to include factors that are 
associated with bisphosphonate use or with the risk of fracture. Participants self-reported 
age, race, education level, history of fracture after age 54, diabetes mellitus treated with 
shots or pills, recreational physical activity, general health rating (excellent, very good, 
good, fair, poor),26 parental hip fracture, smoking status, alcohol intake, and rheumatoid 
arthritis diagnosis. Recreational physical activity was assessed by self-report on a validated 
study questionnaire27 and categorized in metabolic equivalents (MET)-hours per week.28 
Medication use and body mass index (BMI [kg/m2]) were collected at clinical exams at 
years 0, 3, 6, and 9 for RCT participants and at years 0 and 3 for OS participants. For OS 
participants, estrogen use was also collected by self-report annually in years 3–9, SERM use 
was collected at years 6, 7, and 8, and calcitonin use was collected at years 6 and 9 after 
enrollment. For participants of the estrogen RCTs, estrogen and calcitonin use was collected 
at annual clinic visits in all study years and SERM use was also collected annually in years 
2005–8. Duration of ever-use of aromatase inhibitors and SERMs was collected on the 
2008–9 breast health form. Calcium supplement use was self-reported on study forms 
annually in 2005–2010. Breast cancer diagnoses were confirmed and tumor characteristics 
(stage, estrogen receptor status, and diagnosis date) were obtained from medical record 
review. As a surrogate for BMD, we included the predicted risk of hip fracture within five 
years calculated as a risk score from an 11-item fracture risk prediction algorithm developed 
and validated in the WHI.29 This analysis used the most recent value collected at or before 
the medication inventory for all characteristics except for medication use (SERMs, 
aromatase inhibitors, calcitonin, estrogens, and glucocorticoids), which used all 
measurements collected at or before the medication inventory.
Outcome Ascertainment
The outcome of interest for this analysis was any clinical fracture. Outcomes were 
ascertained by self-report on a form, administered annually during all years of follow-up, 
which asked women to report new fractures and other medical events that occurred since 
completion of the previous study form.24 Additionally, a subset of fractures was confirmed

 by review of medical records. Per the WHI protocol, clinical fracture excluded fractures of 
the finger, toe, jaw, nose, face, skull, rib, sternum, and cervical spine.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Analysis—We described the 887 women included in the fracture analysis 
grouped by the duration of bisphosphonate use reported on the medication inventory 
categorized in approximate tertiles (2–3, 4–7, 8+ years).
Statistical Analysis of Fracture Incidence
Participants contributed follow-up time from the date of completing the 2008–9 medication 
inventory until the occurrence of fracture, death, loss-to-follow-up, or end of study follow-up 
in 2013–14, whichever occurred first.24 We presented the fracture incidence per 1,000 
person-years during follow-up. The association between duration of bisphosphonate 
exposure and fracture was estimated using three multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
survival models that compared 4–7 and eight or more years of bisphosphonate use with 2–3 
years of use (reference group). Model 1 estimated hazard ratios adjusted a priori for age and 
race. Model 2 estimated hazard ratios adjusted a priori for characteristics associated with 
bisphosphonate use or fracture risk: age, race, BMI, parental hip fracture, smoking status, 
alcohol intake (≥ 3 units/day), rheumatoid arthritis, glucocorticoid use (≥ 3 months), risk of 
hip fracture within five years calculated by WHI hip fracture risk algorithm, diabetes 
mellitus treated with pills or shots, recreational physical activity, general health rating, 
SERM use (ever/never), aromatase inhibitor use (ever/never), stage of cancer, current 
calcium supplement use, calcitonin use (use within 10 years before medication inventory), 
and estrogen use (use within 10 years before medication inventory) and stratified by history 
of fracture after age 54. To develop Model 2, we first tested the model including all the a 
priori variables with the addition of interaction terms for duration of bisphosphonate use 
with use of SERMs, aromatase inhibitors, and calcitonin. The interaction terms were not 
significant (p > 0.05) and, thus, were not included in Model 2. Model 3 was adjusted for the 
variables that were significantly associated with fracture in Model 2 (history of rheumatoid 
arthritis and recreational physical activity) and a priori for age, race, stage of cancer, SERM 
use, and aromatase inhibitor use, and stratified by history of fracture after age 54. Women 
with missing covariate data were excluded from Cox models including that covariate (n=27, 
3% of women). All statistical tests were two-tailed (α=0.05) and performed in Stata version 
13.
Additional Analyses
We also modeled bisphosphonate use as a continuous variable (1-year increments of use) 
with results presented as the predicted hazard ratio associated with a 5-year increase in 
duration of bisphosphonate use, equivalent to the interquartile range of duration of 
bisphosphonate use. To examine fracture risk among women with high fracture risk, we 
conducted a subgroup analysis of women with a predicted 5-year hip fracture risk of 1.5% or 
greater (n=582), calculated using a fracture risk prediction algorithm developed and 
validated in the WHI.29

 RESULTS
Descriptive characteristics
Characteristics of all 5,689 women who completed the medication inventory and breast 
health form are described in a supplemental table (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 
2). We observed a change over time in endocrine therapy use by WHI participants with 
breast cancer. Tamoxifen use decreased while aromatase inhibitor use increased between 
1993 and 2009; by seven years prior to the 2008–9 breast health form, aromatase inhibitor 
use surpassed tamoxifen use (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3, which illustrates 
the change in medication use).
Among the 887 women in the fracture analysis, 270 (31%) had used bisphosphonates for 2–
3 years, 323 (36%) for 4–7 years, and 294 (33%) for eight or more years or more (Table 1). 
The average age was 76.4 years (SD: 6.4) and did not differ by exposure group. White race 
was most common among women who had used bisphosphonates for 4–7 years and least 
common among women who had used bisphosphonates for 2–3 years. Among women with 
eight or more years of bisphosphonate use, BMI was lower and current smoking and history 
of aromatase inhibitor use were less common. Other characteristics including history of 
fracture after age 54 before the medication inventory were similar between groups.
Fracture Outcomes
The average follow-up was 3.7 (SD: 1.1) years; follow-up time did not differ across 
bisphosphonate groups. During all years of follow-up there were 142 clinical fractures 
(Table 2). Women with eight or more years of bisphosphonates use had the highest 
unadjusted fracture rate (76.6 per 1,000 person-years) and women with 2–3 years of use had 
the lowest (47.4); the rate was intermediate among women with 4–7 years of use (51.8). In 
Model 2 after multivariate adjustment for all a priori variables and in Model 3 after 
multivariate adjustment for age, race, history of endocrine therapy use, stage of cancer and 
variables significantly associated with fracture, eight or more years of bisphosphonate use 
was associated with higher risk of any clinical fracture (HR: 1.67 [95% CI: 1.06–2.62] and 
HR: 1.65 [95% CI: 1.07–2.55]). Bisphosphonate use of 4–7 years, compared with 2–3 years, 
was not associated with fracture risk in any multivariate-adjusted model.
In the sensitivity analysis that modeled bisphosphonate exposure as a continuous variable, a 
five-year increase in bisphosphonate use was associated with a 29% (95% CI: 1.00–1.66) 
increase in fracture risk in Model 2 and a 28% (95% CI: 1.00–1.63) increase in Model 3 
(Table 3). In the analysis limited to 582 women at high fracture risk as defined by a 5-year 
hip fracture risk of 1.5% or greater, the hazard ratio for fracture associated with eight and 
more years of bisphosphonate use, compared with 2–3 years, was to the same as the hazard 
ratios for Model 1 and Model 2 in the main analysis, but the confidence intervals were wider 
due to the smaller sample size (HR: 1.67 [CI: 094–2.96] and HR: 1.65 [95% CI: 0.95–2.86]; 
Table 4).

 DISCUSSION
In our analysis of long-term bisphosphonate use and fracture among postmenopausal women 
with breast cancer, eight or more years of bisphosphonate use, compared with 2–3 years, 
was associated with higher risk of clinical fracture after multivariate adjustment for SERM 
use, aromatase inhibitor use, and other characteristics. Additionally, we found an association 
between additional years of bisphosphonate use and higher fracture risk when we modeled 
bisphosphonate exposure as a continuous variable in multivariate-adjusted models. When we 
limited the analysis to women with a high risk of fracture as defined by a 5-year hip fracture 
risk of 1.5% or greater, the point estimate suggested a higher risk of clinical fracture for 
women with eight or more years of bisphosphonate use, compared with 2–3 years, but the 
association was not significant. We found no significant association between 4–7 years of 
bisphosphonate use, compared with 2–3 years, and the risk of clinical fracture.
There are few studies of long-term bisphosphonate use compared to short-term use in the 
general population, and to our review, this is the first study of this type among 
postmenopausal women with breast cancer.10,11,30 Mellstrom and colleagues in an open-
label 2-year extension of an RCT of risedronate found no association with fracture for 6–7 
years of bisphosphonate use compared to 1–2 years of use among women without breast 
cancer.30 Our findings in women with breast cancer for bisphosphonate exposure of less than 
eight years are similar to those of Mellstrom and colleagues, but Mellstrom and colleagues 
did not examine bisphosphonate use beyond seven years. In a case control study of 14,760 
women, Meier and colleagues found 1–2 and 3–4 years of bisphosphonate use were 
associated with lower fracture risk compared with less than one year of use, but that 5–6 
years of use was not associated with lower risk.31 In a study of 1,835,116 patients over age 
45 years, Dell and colleagues found that risk of atypical femur fracture was higher during 8 
to 9.9 years of use than during 0.1 to 1.9 years of bisphosphonate use32 In contrast, Pazianas 
and colleagues studied a large database and found persistence of hip fracture protection 
during up to eight years of bisphosphonate use.33 Our findings of higher fracture risk during 
eight or more years of use suggest the need for more confirmatory studies of long-term 
bisphosphonate exposure that can account for additional indicators of severity of disease, 
such as timing of detection of low BMD, and for lower bisphosphonate adherence, which 
has been associated with more fractures,34 that may further explain the relationship between 
long-term bisphosphonate use and fracture risk. In particular, the long-term users may have 
had earlier onset of severely low BMD.
In the postmenopausal breast cancer population, the relationship of bisphosphonate use with 
fracture risk is complex because of the use of endocrine therapy to help prevent hormone 
receptor positive breast cancer recurrence. Current clinical guidelines for breast cancer 
treatment recommend aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen use to prevent recurrence of 
hormone receptor positive cancer.35,36 Approximately 75% of breast cancers are hormone 
receptor positive and, as the US population ages, clinicians will increasingly provide fracture 
risk management counseling to women with a history of endocrine cancer treatment. 
Although tamoxifen is beneficial to bone17,18 and aromatase inhibitors are detrimental to 
bone,5,19 our findings suggest that eight or more years of bisphosphonate use is associated 
with higher fracture risk or with a decrease in effectiveness irrespective of history of SERM

 or aromatase inhibitor use. Although our analysis was stratified by prior fracture before the 
medication inventory and adjusted for history of aromatase inhibitor use, our analysis did 
not account for whether aromatase inhibitor use commenced before or after bisphosphonates 
or prior fracture.
Beyond the role of bisphosphonates in fracture risk management, continuing care for women 
with breast cancer must consider the potential for bisphosphonates to prevent cancer 
recurrence. Zoledronic acid use compared with placebo among women receiving aromatase 
inhibitors or SERMs was associated with higher disease-free survival in the Austrian Breast 
and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial-12.37 A 2015 meta-analysis of trials of 
bisphosphonates with primary outcomes of cancer recurrence and mortality found adjuvant 
intravenous bisphosphonate use significantly reduced breast cancer recurrence and mortality 
among post-menopausal women with breast cancer.38 Clinical decision-making must also 
consider the elevated risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is higher among women who 
have received intravenous bisphosphonates at high doses for cancer treatment than among 
women who have not used bisphosphonates or used bisphosphonates at lower doses.39,40 
The present study findings should not be generalized to intravenous bisphosphonate users or 
to women with distant stage breast cancer who are more likely to receive intravenous 
bisphosphonates, rather than oral bisphosphonates.
Our study has limitations. While only a subset of fractures was confirmed by medical record 
review, good to excellent correlation between self-reported fracture and medical record 
review has been reported in the WHI with 78% confirmation for hip fracture, 81% for lower 
arm/wrist, 51% for clinical spine, and a 76% confirmation when including adjacent fracture 
sites.41 None-the-less, underestimation of true fracture incidence could have attenuated 
associations and decreased our ability to detect an association. While medication use was by 
self-report, a validity study of the 2008–9 WHI medication inventory found near perfect 
agreement between self-reported duration of current medication use and pharmacy records 
for four chronically used medications, including bisphosphonates.42 Our study also did not 
examine intravenous bisphosphonate use, which was not reliably captured in the WHI. 
While intravenous bisphosphonates are not commonly given together with oral 
bisphosphonates, this study cannot account for intravenous bisphosphonate use initiated 
during study follow-up. Study findings cannot account for pathological fractures or 
progression of the breast cancers. Additionally, the study cohort may be healthier than the 
general population, because participants had survived 7.5 years on average after their cancer 
diagnosis up to the time of the medication inventory. In the US, though, over 90% of women 
diagnosed with breast cancer survive for five years or longer.3 While the analysis was 
stratified by prior fracture, it did not adjust for rates of prior fracture. This analysis lacked 
data on BMD, but incorporated a predicted 5-year hip fracture risk score. There is a 
significant correlation between the fracture risk score and BMD in the WHI that supports its 
use to adjust for potential BMD difference among participants.29, 43 Furthermore, the study 
had limited power to detect small associations.
There are several strengths of this analysis. Age is the strongest predictor of osteoporotic 
fracture and women in this analysis were 76 years of age on average.2 The racially and 
ethnically diverse WHI study population included women with varying durations of

 bisphosphonate use. Additionally, our analyses are adjusted for many characteristics 
predictive of fracture risk and breast cancer diagnosis was confirmed by medical record 
review.
CONCLUSIONS
Among postmenopausal women with breast cancer, after adjustment for history of endocrine 
therapy and fracture risk factors, longer duration of bisphosphonate use was associated with 
higher risk of clinical fracture compared with shorter duration. Study findings should be 
interpreted with caution. Higher fracture risk during long-term use may represent loss of 
effectiveness over time, lower long-term bisphosphonate adherence, or residual confounding 
factors. Thus, further study is needed. Pending the results of confirmatory studies, the FDA 
safety recommendation for periodic reevaluation of long-term bisphosphonate users for the 
appropriateness of continuing therapy would seem particularly important for this population.
