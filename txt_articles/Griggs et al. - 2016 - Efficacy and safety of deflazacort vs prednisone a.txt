Efficacy and safety of deflazacort vs
prednisone and placebo for Duchenne
muscular dystrophy
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess safety and efficacy of deflazacort (DFZ) and prednisone (PRED) vs placebo in
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Methods: This phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evalu-
ated muscle strength among 196 boys aged 5–15 years with DMD during a 52-week period.
In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment with DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d, DFZ
1.2 mg/kg/d, PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d, or placebo for 12 weeks. In phase 2, placebo participants were
randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups. Participants originally assigned to an
active treatment continued that treatment for an additional 40 weeks. The primary efficacy
endpoint was average change in muscle strength from baseline to week 12 compared with pla-
cebo. The study was completed in 1995.
Results: All treatment groups (DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d, DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d, and PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d) dem-
onstrated significant improvement in muscle strength compared with placebo at 12 weeks. Par-
ticipants taking PRED had significantly more weight gain than placebo or both doses of DFZ at 12
weeks; at 52 weeks, participants taking PRED had significantly more weight gain than both DFZ
doses. The most frequent adverse events in all 3 active treatment arms were Cushingoid appear-
ance, erythema, hirsutism, increased weight, headache, and nasopharyngitis.
Conclusions: After 12 weeks of treatment, PRED and both doses of DFZ improved muscle
strength compared with placebo. Deflazacort was associated with less weight gain than PRED.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that for boys with DMD, daily use
of either DFZ and PRED is effective in preserving muscle strength over a 12-week period.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disease that affects approximately 1 in
5,000 live male births.1 The disease presents in boys typically before the age of 5 years.2 Without
treatment, boys require a wheelchair before their teen years due to deterioration of muscle
strength.3 Currently, glucocorticoids (GCs) are the only pharmacologic therapy shown to
increase muscle strength among boys with DMD.2,3 Corticosteroids prolong independent
ambulation, improve pulmonary function, delay the onset of cardiomyopathy, and reduce
the incidence of scoliosis.2–4 While numerous, well-controlled studies had been conducted on
prednisone (PRED) in the DMD population at the time this study was conducted, no such
evidence existed for deflazacort (DFZ).5–7

 DFZ is a heterocyclic GC prodrug belong-
ing to the class of oxazoline steroids, with
demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immu-
nosuppressant effects.8 Previous studies have
suggested that DFZ and PRED are effective
and suggest that DFZ may cause less weight
gain than PRED.9,10 This study examined the
efficacy of DFZ vs placebo and compares the
efficacy and safety of DFZ with PRED. An
abstract
of
this
study
was
presented.11
Although the study was completed in 1995,
the data are being published now due to the
efforts of the authors and Marathon Pharma-
ceuticals since the original sponsor of the study
gave up the rights to the data and compound.
Marathon has submitted a New Drug Appli-
cation in 2016 for US approval of deflazacort
for the treatment of DMD.
METHODS Study design. In a multicenter, phase 3, random-
ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 196 boys (age 5–15
years) with DMD were assigned to groups with a permuted block
system via telephone, and both study personnel and participants
were masked to treatment assignment. The study consisted of 2
phases. In phase 1, eligible participants were randomly assigned to 1
of 4 groups stratified by center and by whether the participant
was classified as ambulatory or nonambulatory and randomized
in blocks of 4: DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d, DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d, PRED
0.75 mg/kg/d, or placebo for 12 weeks of treatment. If
2 brothers participated in the study, they were randomized
together
in
the same treatment group to
prevent
any
confusion in taking their medication. After the initial 12
weeks, in phase 2, placebo-treated participants were randomly
re-assigned to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups and followed
through 52 weeks. Participants originally assigned to 1 of the 3
active treatment groups continued in that study arm for the
additional 40 weeks. All participants in each of the treatment
groups received the same number of tablets to maintain
blinding. The study was conducted between April 26, 1993,
and April 20, 1995.
Participant selection. Eligible participants were boys between
the ages of 5 and 15 years, with onset of weakness before 5 years
of age; increased serum creatine kinase activity at least 10 times
the upper limit of normal; and either genetic analysis of the dys-
trophin gene or biopsy that demonstrated a clear alteration in
dystrophin amount or distribution in the muscle. The protocol
enrolled participants with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)
or DMD, describing differences in dystrophin analysis findings
from muscle biopsy specimens. Differentiation between DMD
and BMD was less definitive at the time of this study than it
is today. Clinical diagnostic criteria were used by the Clinical
Investigation in Duchenne Dystrophy study group to distin-
guish patients with DMD from those with BMD, since DNA
analysis was not always definitive. Emphasis was placed on exam-
ination for clinical differentiation in addition to muscle biopsies.
Patients with BMD characteristically have good neck flexor
strength, clearly in the 4 range, and usually against resistance,
whereas patients with DMD have weaker neck flexors even from
early in the course of their disease. A total of 7/196 (;3.6%)
participants presented with neck flexor grades of 4 or greater at
the screening visit.
Exclusion criteria included prior long-term use (.1 year) of
oral GCs, active peptic ulcer disease or history of gastrointestinal
bleeding or perforation, any use of oral steroids for $l month
within 6 months of study entry, any use of oral steroids for ,1
month within 2 months of study entry, normal muscle biopsy or
muscle biopsy evidence of denervation, glycogen storage disease,
or skin rash suggestive of dermatomyositis.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This trial was designed and monitored in accordance
with the ethical principles of good clinical practice as required
by the major regulatory authorities, and in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was received
prior to study enrollment from at least 1 parent or legal guardian,
as appropriate, and from participants if aged 14 years or older.
The protocol (and any amendments) and the statement of
informed consent were approved by an institutional review board
prior to each center’s initiation.
Procedures. Efficacy assessments. The primary efficacy assess-
ment was the change from baseline to week 12 in average muscle
strength as assessed by modified Medical Research Council
(MRC) scale, used in previous studies with PRED.5–7 The study
was completed in 1995, at which time the 6-minute walk distance
test was not used as an endpoint. The MRC scale was considered
the most relevant efficacy measure based on previous studies
during this time. Participants were asked to perform specific
muscle strength assessments by a trained physiotherapist in var-
ious positions (sitting, prone, side-lying, and supine) at each
study visit to evaluate any change in disease severity during the
study and graded with an 11-point scale.
Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in average
muscle strength from week 12 to week 52 and pulmonary func-
tion testing (i.e., forced vital capacity [FVC] and maximum vol-
untary
ventilation).
Additional
endpoints
included
timed
functional testing: standing from lying position; climbing 4 stairs;
running/walking 30 feet; and propelling a wheelchair 30 feet. In
addition, physicians made a global assessment of each partici-
pant’s disease severity at each visit using the Response Visual
Analog Scale (0 mm 5 no symptoms; 100 mm 5 as bad as it
could be).10
Safety assessments. Safety was evaluated by the incidence of
adverse events (AEs), changes in clinical laboratory findings or
physical examinations, and vital signs (including weight, height,
and body mass index [BMI]). In addition, change in statural
growth percentiles was evaluated.
Statistical analyses. The sample size calculations for this study
were based on a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
PRED in 99 participants that showed a difference of 0.34 units in
average manual muscle strength score after 3 months.5 The SD of
the difference measure was 0.33 units. When translated into the
present study, these findings had adequate power (90%) with 36
participants in each of the 4 groups to detect a difference of 0.25
units (2 sample t test). However, this sample size did not take into
account any adjustment of the significance level. A sample size of
45 participants per group was sufficient to apply the Dunnett test.
This sample size likewise enabled detection of a difference of
1.00–1.25 mo/y with respect to bone age delay and statural age
delay.
Two analysis populations were planned for this study. The
safety population included all participants who received at least
1 dose of study medication. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population
included all participants randomized into the study. The efficacy

 analyses were conducted using the ITT population. All safety
analyses were conducted using the safety population, except for
the analysis on statural growth, in which the ITT population
was analyzed. Least squares (LS) means or odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) are presented for statistical models, as
appropriate. Statistical testing was performed at the 0.05 level
using 2-tailed tests. For efficacy analyses, the baseline value was
defined as the mean of the assessments obtained from visits 1
and 2 when data from both were present. If data from only 1 visit
were present, the values from that visit were used as the baseline
value.
Classification of evidence. This interventional study provides
Class I evidence that DFZ is equivalent to PRED and provides
a significant improvement compared with placebo (DFZ 0.9
mg/kg/d LS mean 0.25 vs placebo LS mean 20.1, p 5 0.017,
95% CI 0.04–0.46; DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d LS mean 0.36 vs placebo
LS mean 20.1, p 5 0.0003, 95% CI 0.14–0.57) in average
muscle strength after 12 weeks of treatment in boys with DMD.
RESULTS Participants. A total of 196 participants
(figure 1) from 4 centers in the United States and 5
centers in Canada were enrolled in the study (table 1).
Most of the participants were white (185 [94.9%])
and all 196 participants were male. Overall mean
(SD) participant age was 8.8 (2.89) years; weight,
30.5 (13.8) kg; height, 131 (18) cm; and BMI,
17.1 (3.7) kg/m2. These characteristics were similar
among all treatment groups.
Efficacy evaluations. The primary efficacy analysis
demonstrated a significant LS mean difference in
favor of DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d (0.25 vs 20.1, p 5
0.017, 95% CI 0.04–0.46), DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d
(0.36 vs 20.1, p 5 0.0003, 95% CI 0.14–0.57),
and PRED 0.75 mg/kg/d (0.37 vs 20.1, p 5
0.0002, 95% CI 0.15–0.59) compared with placebo
in muscle strength at 12 weeks (figure 2A). Signifi-
cant improvements in motor function with the active
treatments occurred with DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d (p 5
0.0018), DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d (p 5 0.0002), and PRED
(p 5 0.0016) in time from supine to standing vs
placebo; time to climb 4 stairs (p , 0.0001 for all
active treatments vs placebo); and time to run or walk
30 feet (p , 0.0001 for all active treatments vs pla-
cebo) at week 12. The absolute time to propel
a wheelchair 30 feet was faster in the 3 treatment
groups compared with placebo; however, these results
were not significant.
Figure 1
Study schematic and patient disposition
Participants enrolled were initially allocated to 1 of the 4 treatment groups (study phase 1). Participants were treated for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, placebo
participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 active treatment groups and all participants were treated until week 52. The intention-to-treat (ITT) pop-
ulation included all participants who were randomized and had at least 1 postbaseline assessment. The safety population included all participants who
received at least 1 dose of study medication. AE 5 adverse event; DFZ 5 deflazacort; PRED 5 prednisone.

 The secondary analysis of change in muscle
strength from 12 to 52 weeks demonstrated continued
improvement in muscle strength in DFZ-treated par-
ticipants vs worsening in PRED-treated participants
(figure 2B). There was a significant improvement in
average muscle strength score from week 12 to week
52 in the DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d group compared with the
PRED-treated group (LS mean 0.29, p 5 0.044,
95% CI 0.08–0.49). The DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d group
had numerical improvement compared to PRED-
treated participants from week 12 to week 52 but it
did not reach significance (LS mean 0.16, p 5 0.18,
95% CI 20.06 to 0.37). From week 12 to week 52,
both DFZ groups demonstrated greater numerical
improvements in time from supine to stand, time
to climb 4 stairs, and time to run or walk 30 feet
compared with the PRED-treated participants, but
these did not reach significance. From baseline to
week 52, participants in the DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d
(p 5 0.0461) and DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d (p 5 0.0012)
groups had significant improvement in the time to
climb 4 stairs compared with PRED. At week 52, the
exploratory efficacy endpoint of change in average
muscle strength from baseline showed positive results
in favor of both doses of DFZ compared with PRED
(figure 2C). Mean 6 SD changes in average muscle
strength score from baseline at all study visits to week
52 are shown in figure e-1 at Neurology.org.
Physician global assessments did not indicate sig-
nificant differences among groups at 12 or 52 weeks.
Pulmonary function assessments showed a signifi-
cantly greater benefit with DFZ 1.2 mg/kg/d over
PRED for the change in FVC from week 12 to week
52. No other differences between treatment groups
were observed in assessments of pulmonary function.
Safety evaluations. There were more AEs, serious AEs
(SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation in
PRED-treated participants vs both DFZ groups.
The most common AEs observed were those
typical of corticosteroids (table 2). The 3 most
commonly reported treatment-related events were
Cushingoid
appearance
(136/196
participants;
69.4%), erythema (82/196 participants; 41.8%),
and hirsutism (77/196 participants, 39.3%) and

 deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/d group than 0.9 mg/kg/d
group. Weight gain–related AEs were also more
likely
to
be
moderate
or
severe
with
PRED
compared with DFZ. The higher incidence of weight
gain–related AEs is consistent with previously reported
data for weight and BMI.5,6,12,13 At week 12, there were
significant increases in weight (figure 3A) and BMI
with PRED vs placebo (weight: LS mean 3.23 vs
1.23, p 5 0.0459, 95% CI 0.03–3.97; BMI: LS
means 1.47 vs 0.16, p 5 0.0041, 95% CI 0.35–
2.29); there were no significant differences between
the DFZ groups and placebo. At 52 weeks, the DFZ
groups showed significantly smaller increases in weight
(figure 3, B and C) and BMI than participants
originally randomized to PRED. Mean 6 SD
changes in weight and BMI from baseline at all
study visits to week 52 are shown in figures e-2 and
e-3, respectively. There was also a nonsignificant result
with participants discontinuing treatment due to
weight gain–related AEs (e.g., weight increased,
central obesity, increased appetite, obesity) on PRED
(4.8%) compared with DFZ (1.5% for DFZ 0.9 mg/
kg/d and 3.1% for 1.2 mg/kg/d).
From baseline to week 12, DFZ 0.9 mg/kg/d had
a significantly greater decrease in forearm length per-
centile compared to placebo (LS mean 24.87 vs
1.04, p 5 0.0317) and both DFZ dose groups had
significantly greater decrease in forearm length per-
centile than PRED from baseline to 52 weeks (DFZ
0.9 mg/kg/d LS mean 28.05, p 5 0.0011; DFZ 1.2
mg/kg/d LS mean 24.96, p 5 0.0491; PRED 0.75
mg/kg/d LS mean 0.85) (table e-1). There were no
differences in changes in height percentile with the
active treatments vs placebo at 12 weeks but DFZ 1.2
mg/kg/d had significantly greater decreases in height
percentile from baseline to 52 weeks vs PRED (DFZ
1.2 mg/kg/d LS mean 217.04, p 5 0.0015; PRED
0.75 mg/kg/d LS mean 27.04) (table e-1).
In addition, psychiatric AEs generally appeared at
a higher rate in the PRED group vs both DFZ groups.
Abnormal behavior, aggression, irritability, and mood
swings were more commonly reported in the PRED
group. Psychotic disorder was reported more fre-
quently in the low-dose DFZ group. Cataract occurred
at a higher rate with daily DFZ (0.9 mg/kg, 4.4%;
1.2 mg/kg, 1.5%) than PRED (1.6%), consistent with
previous literature.14,15 Although no cataracts were
graded as SAEs, 1 participant in the low-dose DFZ

 group discontinued treatment due to cataracts.
Other AEs leading to discontinuation in either
DFZ group included DMD (n 5 1), obesity/central
obesity (n 5 2), Cushingoid appearance (n 5 1), and
increased weight (n 5 2).
DISCUSSION The efficacy of daily DFZ and PRED
for boys with DMD has been demonstrated in ran-
domized controlled trials, showing benefit of both
to muscle strength.5,9,12,13,16 The 0.9 mg/kg/d dose
of deflazacort was chosen based on data demonstrat-
ing that the potency of prednisone to deflazacort was
1:1.2.17 Previous studies had determined PRED 0.75
mg/kg/d to be effective while minimizing side effects
over a 1.5 mg/kg/d dose.5–7 No such study had been
completed for DFZ when this study was conducted.
Thus 2 dose arms of 0.9 mg/kg/d and 1.2 mg/kg/d
were studied to accomplish the same goal. The cur-
rent study showed that both DFZ and PRED were
superior to placebo over 12 weeks in improving
motor strength, consistent with published litera-
ture.13,16 In addition to preservation of muscle
strength, there was improvement in functional meas-
ures of time to rise from supine to standing, climbing
4 stairs, and running or walking 30 feet. However,
since similar efficacy was seen between the DFZ
groups with lower numerical incidence of AEs overall,
the 0.9 mg/kg/d group was the proposed dose sub-
mitted to the Food and Drug Administration.
The AEs observed in the present trial are consis-
tent with known AEs associated with chronic cortico-
steroid therapy. In general, AEs were higher and more
severe with PRED than DFZ, most notably regarding
weight gain. The higher incidence of weight gain–
related AEs with PRED vs DFZ was consistent with
the weight and BMI data that demonstrated signifi-
cant weight gain with PRED over placebo at 12 weeks
and PRED over DFZ at 52 weeks. Most comparative
studies with PRED and DFZ have demonstrated
more weight gain with PRED than DFZ; however,
not all studies have noted a difference between these
treatments in terms of patient weight gain. Over 1
year, PRED-treated participants gained 18% of their
body weight compared with 5% for DFZ-treated par-
ticipants.9 Similarly, a recent Cooperative Interna-
tional Neuromuscular Research Group publication,
which demonstrated the loss of ambulation benefit
with DFZ over PRED, found no difference in weight
gain between DFZ and PRED but PRED-treated
participants were on significantly less of the recom-
mended dose compared to DFZ.18
Weight gain is one of the most common AEs asso-
ciated with corticosteroid use in participants with
DMD. Weight gain has implications on the loss of
patient ambulation due to increased mechanical load
on already impaired muscles.19 In the current trial,

 more participants discontinued treatment due to
weight gain with PRED than DFZ, a result that is
also consistent with earlier data.9 This study found
that DFZ caused reduced growth compared to pred-
nisone over 52 weeks of treatment. It is possible that
the shorter stature with DFZ vs PRED results in
a biomechanical advantage that may lead to pro-
longed ambulation. This finding is consistent with
a study that found that the mean age at loss of inde-
pendent ambulation between boys with short stature
(14.8 6 2.9 years) and those with normal height
(11.2 6 2.4 years) was significantly different (p ,
0.001).20 The CINRG study also showed that AEs for
growth delay, Cushingoid appearance, and cataracts
were higher with DFZ than PRED.18 The higher
incidence of cataracts with DFZ vs PRED has been
reported.21
Behavioral abnormalities, such as aggression and
irritability, are commonly associated with chronic
corticosteroid therapy in patients with DMD and
may necessitate a change in treatment.3 In the current
study, the combined incidence of psychiatric AEs was
higher with PRED than DFZ.
A limitation of this study was the 52-week dura-
tion of treatment, which does not allow for long-
term follow-up to observe the effect of steroids over
longer periods of time within this. A longer, prospec-
tive randomized study comparing prednisone and de-
flazacort is currently in progress (FOR DMD).22
There are also other intermittent prednisone regi-
mens that may have fewer side effects than daily pred-
nisone dosing.23
Overall, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled study demonstrated the effect of DFZ
and PRED on muscle strength and motor function
in patients with DMD. Over 1 year of treatment,
DFZ was better tolerated and resulted in a lower inci-
dence of weight gain and psychiatric AEs, which are
the most common reasons for discontinuing treat-
ment.24 Data from this study should be taken into
account when deciding which GC to start in a boy
with DMD.
