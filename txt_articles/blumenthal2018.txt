IMPORTANCE Public reporting of procedural outcomes has been associated with lower rates
of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and worse outcomes after myocardial infarction.
Contemporary data are limited on the influence of public reporting on interventional
cardiologists’clinical decision making.
OBJECTIVE To survey a contemporary cohort of interventional cardiologists in Massachusetts
and New York about how public reporting of PCI outcomes influences clinical decision
making.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An online survey was developed with public reporting
experts and administered electronically to eligible physicians in Massachusetts and New York
who were identified by Doximity (an online physician networking site) and 2014 Medicare
fee-for-service claims for PCI procedures. The personal and hospital characteristics of
participants were ascertained via a comprehensive database from Doximity and the American
Hospital Association annual surveys of US hospitals (2012 and 2013) and linked to survey
responses. Associations between survey responses and characteristics of participants were
evaluated in univariable and multivariable analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reported rate of avoidance of performing PCIs in high-risk
patients and of perception of pressure from colleagues to avoid performing PCIs.
RESULTS Of the 456 physicians approached, 149 (32.7%) responded, including 67 of 129
(51.9%) in Massachusetts and 82 of 327 (25.1%) in New York. The mean (SD) age was 49 (9.2)
years; 141 of 149 participants (94.6%) were men. Most participants reported practicing at
medium to large, nonprofit hospitals with high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratories
and cardiothoracic surgery capabilities. In 2014, participants had higher annual PCI volumes
among Medicare patients than nonparticipants did (median, 31; interquartile range [IQR],
13-47 vs median, 17; IQR, 0-41; P < .001). Among participants, 65% reported avoiding PCIs on
at least 2 occasions becase of concern that a bad outcome would negatively impact their
publicly reported outcomes; 59% reported sometimes or often being pressured by
colleagues to avoid performing PCIs because of a concern about the patient’
s risk of death.
After multivariable adjustment, more years of experience practicing interventional cardiology
was associated with lower odds of PCI avoidance. The state of practice was not associated
with survey responses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Current PCI public reporting programs can foster risk-averse
clinical practice patterns, which do not vary significantly between interventional cardiologists
in New York and Massachusetts. Coordinated efforts by policy makers, health systems
leadership, and the interventional cardiology community are needed to mitigate these
unintended consequences.

 S
everal states, including Massachusetts and New York,
mandate public reporting of short-term mortality rates
after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Public
reporting has been associated with lower mortality after PCIs1
but may also promote PCI avoidance among physicians treat-
ing ST-elevation myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and
cardiac arrest.2-8
Two prior surveys of interventional cardiologists in New
York found evidence of avoidance of PCI and mistrust of pub-
lic reporting systems.9-11 These studies yielded limited infor-
mationabouthowandwhypublicreportingpromotesriskaver-
sion and whether it facilitates quality improvement and
informed decision making. To build on this work, we sur-
veyed interventional cardiologists in Massachusetts and New
York about their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about pub-
lic reporting of PCIs.
Methods
A survey was administered to a comprehensive cohort of in-
terventional cardiologists in Massachusetts and New York be-
tween November 2016 and February 2017 using Research Elec-
tronic Data Capture, a secure, web-based research database.12
The personal and facility characteristics of all physicians iden-
tified as eligible to receive an invitation for the survey were
obtained from Doximity, an online networking site for physi-
cians; 2014 Medicare fee-for-service claims data; and the 2012
and 2013 American Hospital Association annual surveys of US
hospitals. Physician-level data from Doximity have been pre-
viously validated and shown to be accurate.13,14 The total num-
ber of PCIs performed by each physician was extracted from
the Medicare claims data set via International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 00.66, 36.00, 36.06, 36.07, and
36.09,andCurrentProceduralTerminologycodes92920,92921,

92941, 92943, and 92944.
This study was approved by the institutional review board
atBethIsraelDeaconessMedicalCenter.Surveycompletionwas
regarded as participants’informed consent. Invitees were sent

respective of survey completion, to incentivize participation.
Associations between survey responses and physician and
facility characteristics were evaluated using univariable analy-
sisandmultivariablelogisticregressioninSAS,version9.4(SAS
Institute). Personal and facility characteristics were also com-
pared between participants and nonparticipants. A sensitiv-
ity analysis was performed to test for nonresponse bias. eAp-
pendices 1 through 4 and eReferences in the Supplement
contain the survey instrument and additional explanations of
the methods. Any P value of .05 or less was regarded as sig-
nificant.
Results
The study survey was sent to 456 interventional cardiolo-
gists, of whom 149 participated. The response rate was 32.7%
overall, with 67 of 129 physicians participating in Massachu-
setts (51.9%) and 82 of 327 (25.1%) participating in New York.
The mean (SD) age was 49 (9.2) years; 141 of 149 (94.6%) were
men (Table 1). Participants had practiced interventional car-
diology for a mean (SD) of 18.2 (9.7) years. Most respondents
practiced at medium to large hospitals with high PCI volumes
and cardiothoracic surgery capabilities (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment).
The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of PCIs
among Medicare patients in 2014 was higher among partici-
pants (31 [13-47]) than nonparticipants (17 [0-41]; P < .001)
(Table 1). No other significant differences were observed be-
tween the groups. Additional self-reported characteristics of
participants and their facilities are in Table 2 and eTable 2 in
the Supplement.
Of the 149 participants, 97 (59.1%) reported sometimes or
often being pressured by colleagues to avoid an indicated PCI
because of concern that the patient was at high risk of death
(Figure); 89 of 149 (65.1%) reported avoiding PCIs at least twice
because of concerns of a negative publicly reported outcome,
and 141 of 149 (94.7%) believed that other interventionalists
in their state sometimes or often avoid PCIs because of these
concerns (Figure and eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Among the 149 participants, 77 (51.7%) worried some or
a lot that their superiors would not support them for per-
forming an indicated PCI in a critically ill patient who later
died of a PCI-associated complication (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement); 110 (73.8%) reported sometimes or often
delaying a coronary angiography or PCI procedure in a
patient in cardiac arrest because of concerns about the
patient’
s high risk of death (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Four in 5 participants (121 of 149 [81.2%]) reported knowing
some or a lot about public reporting systems’risk adjust-
ment methods. However, 110 of 149 (73.8%) had little or no
trust in these methods (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Among participants, 118 of 149 (79.2%) believed that public
reporting of PCI outcomes did very little or nothing to help
patients make more informed decisions about whether to
undergo an elective PCI, and 88 of 149 (59.1%) thought that
public reporting of PCI outcomes did very little or nothing to
help patients decide which health care facility to go to for an
Key Points
Question How does public reporting of percutaneous coronary
intervention outcomes influence clinical decision making of
interventional cardiologists in New York and Massachusetts?
Findings In this online survey of interventional cardiologists in
Massachusetts and New York, 65% of participants reported
avoiding percutaneous coronary intervention on at least 2
occasions, and 59% reported sometimes or often being pressured
by colleagues to avoid PCIs because of concerns about public
reporting.
Meaning Despite reforms intended to limit reporting of outcomes
for critically ill and high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous
coronary intervention, current programs continue to promote
risk-averse clinical practice.

 elective coronary angiogram and/or PCI (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement). In the sensitivity analysis, weighting
responses for predicted probability of survey completion did
not meaningfully change the distribution of responses
regarding risk aversion or knowledge and trust of risk adjust-
ment (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Additional findings are
presented in eFigures 5-7 in the Supplement.
In multivariable regression, more experience practicing
interventional cardiology was associated with lower odds of
reporting pressure to avoid an indicated PCI (odds ratio [OR]
per 1 year of experience: 0.94; 95% CI; 0.90-0.98; P = .002);
lower odds of believing that other cardiologists avoid high-
risk PCIs because of public reporting (OR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.83-0.98; P = .02); higher odds of trusting risk adjustment
methods (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .01); and insignifi-
cantly lower odds of reporting worry about being supported
by supervisors for performing an indicated PCI in a critically
ill patient (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00; P = .05) (eTable 3 in
the Supplement).
Interventional cardiologists in Massachusetts had insig-
nificantly lower odds than New York interventionalists of re-
porting avoiding high-risk PCIs at least twice (OR, 0.52; 95%
CI, 0.26-1.04; P = .07) and were more likely to report trusting
risk adjustment a lot or some (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.97-4.76;
P = .06) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
These results suggest that risk-averse attitudes and practice
patterns remain prevalent among interventional cardiolo-
gists in Massachusetts and New York; that some intervention-
alists are skeptical that public reporting improves care qual-
ity and informed decision making; and that some do not trust
risk adjustment methods used by public reporting systems.
This is the third survey examining how public reporting of PCI
outcomes influences the practice of interventional cardiol-
ogy. In 2003, Narins et al9 found evidence of pervasive risk-
averse use of PCIs by New York interventionalists because of
concerns about public reporting, particularly when treating
critically ill patients; mistrust of risk adjustment methods; and
upcoding of comorbidities (ie, coding comorbidities in ways
that make the patient appear more complex or ill). More re-
cently, Fernandez et al10 demonstrated that excluding pa-
tientswithanoxicbraininjuryandcardiogenicshockfrompub-
lic reports increased interventionalists’ self-reported
willingness to perform PCIs in these subgroups but did not
eliminate avoidance of indicated PCIs. We also found that pub-
lic reporting engenders aversion toward high-risk PCIs and dis-
trust of risk adjustment methods among interventional car-
diologists in both New York and Massachusetts.

opposed to patients undergoing PCIs alone, is a promising ap-
proachforfurtherreducingrisk-averseuseofPCIs.Interventions

also help mitigate risk aversion.15
Limitations
This study’
s limitations include a 32.7% response rate, which
could limit external generalizability. However, comparisons of
participantsandnonparticipantsandasensitivityanalysissug-
gest that responses may be broadly representative. Nonethe-
less, our findings should be considered exploratory and hy-
pothesis generating. Additionally, we did not evaluate
cardiologists’knowledge about why public reporting exists or
how risk adjustment methods work in practice.
Conclusions
In summary, this study suggests that avoidance of PCIs
because of concerns about public reporting remains perva-
sive in both Massachusetts and New York, that risk-averse
practice patterns appear similar in Massachusetts and New
York, and that less experienced interventionalists may be
particularly prone to risk-averse use of PCIs. Coordinated
efforts by policy makers, health systems leadership, and the
interventional cardiology community are needed to ensure
that public reporting of outcomes effectively improves
accountability, care quality, and informed patient decision
making.
