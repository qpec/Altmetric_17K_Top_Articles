Recognition of neoantigens that are formed as a consequence of 
DNA damage is likely to form a major driving force behind the 
clinical activity of cancer immunotherapies such as T cell checkpoint 
blockade and adoptive T cell therapy8,14,15,19,20,26,27. Therefore, 
strategies to selectively enhance T cell reactivity against genetically 
defined neoantigens3,8,12,21,25 are currently under development. 
In mouse models, T cell pressure can sculpt the antigenicity of 
tumours, resulting in the emergence of tumours that lack defined 
mutant antigens17,18. However, whether the T-cell-recognized 
neoantigen repertoire in human cancers is constant over time is 
unclear. Here we analyse the stability of neoantigen-specific T cell 
responses and the antigens they recognize in two stage IV melanoma 
patients treated by adoptive T cell transfer. The T-cell-recognized 
neoantigens can selectively be lost from the tumour cell population, 
either by overall reduced expression of the gene or loss of the mutant 
allele. Notably, loss of expression of T-cell-recognized neoantigens 
was accompanied by development of a novel neoantigen-specific 
T cell reactivity within tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. These 
data demonstrate the dynamic nature of cancer–T cell interactions, 
suggestive of T-cell-mediated neoantigen immunoediting, and argue 
for the therapeutic induction of broad neoantigen-specific T cell 
responses to avoid tumour resistance.
Cytotoxic CD8+ 
 T cells can specifically recognize and eliminate 
tumors1,10,16. The clinical activity of antibodies against the T cell check-
points CTLA-4 and PD-1 underscores the notion that in many patients 
a tumor-specific T cell response is present22. Similarly, the clinical 
effects of autologous adoptive cell transfer (ACT) rely on the presence 
of tumor-reactive T cell populations2,4,5. Cancer genome-screening 
strategies to dissect T cell responses in these treated cancer pati-
ents provide strong evidence for a role of neo-antigen recognition. 
 
Neo-antigen-specific CD4+ 
 and CD8+ 
 T cell responses are frequently 
observed in melanoma and GI tract tumors15,20,24,25. T cell responses 
against neo-antigens can be enhanced by CTLA-4 and PD-1 block-
ade19,27, and mutational load correlates with response to checkpoint 
blockade in NSCLC, melanoma, and tumors with mismatch repair 
deficiency14,19,26. Finally, a recent case report provides direct evidence 
for the clinical potential of neo-antigen-specific T cell reactivity25.
These data, and the fully tumor-restricted expression of neo-antigens, 
 
makes them an attractive target for novel cancer immunotherapies. In 
support of this concept, neo-antigen vaccines were effective in mouse 
tumor models and immunogenic when injected in humans3,8,12. 
In parallel, neo-antigen-specific T cell transfer strategies are being 
developed7.
However, loss of a defined neo-antigen resulted in tumor cell resist-
ance in a transplantable tumor model17. Whether loss of neo-antigens 
occurs also in human disease is unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the 
changes in expression and recognition of neo-antigens under attack of 
tumor-specific T cells during the follow-up of two stage IV melanoma 
patients treated with ACT. The first patient (BO) presented with stage 
IV melanoma with multiple (> 
9) subcutaneous, lymph node and lung 
lesions. One subcutaneous lesion was resected to establish melanoma 
line MEL05.18. One year later, disease progressed and the patient 
developed a brain metastasis that was partially resected and used to 
establish both a melanoma line (MEL06.07) and tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL06.07). At this point, ACT treatment was initiated, 
using a tumor-specific T cell product expanded by repeated stimulation 
of peripheral blood with MEL05.18. This treatment led to a complete 
response (CR) that is ongoing for more than 9 years (Figure 1a).
The infusion product comprised 70% of CD8+ T cells. Stimulation 
with MEL05.18 showed that > 
80% of the CD8+ 
 and > 
15% of the 
CD4+ 
 T cells were tumor-reactive28. Analysis of CD8+ 
 T cell-reactivity 
 
using a panel of > 
 200 MHC-multimers containing known shared 
tumor-associated epitopes1,9 demonstrated that only a minor fraction 
of tumor-reactivity could be explained by recognition of these shared 
antigens (1.24% of the CD8+ 
 T cells responded to three different gp100 
epitopes; data not shown). The dominant recognition of private anti-
gens was also suggested by stimulation of the T cells used for infusion 
with a panel of (partially) HLA-matched melanoma lines, showing 
exclusive recognition of the autologous tumor (Figure 1b).
To identify the antigens recognized, we analyzed MEL05.18 for 
non-synonymous somatic mutations within expressed genes and 
found that MEL05.18 expressed 501 non-synonymous mutated genes. 
Autologous APC13 loaded with synthetic 31-mer peptides (SLP) 
 
covering these mutations were used to asses T cell recognition.
Within the infusion product used for treatment of patient BO, we 
observed CD4+ 
 T cell responses against RPS12 p.V104I (RPS12V>I), 
ZC3H18 p.G269R (ZC3H18G>R) (Figure 1c and15) and TNIK p.S502F 
(TNIKS>F)15, and CD8+ 
 T cell responses against KIAA0020 p.P451L 
(KIAP>L) and ribosomal protein RPL28 p.S76F (RPL28S>F) (Figure 1d). 
The combined frequency of CD8+ T cells recognizing these 2 mutant 
epitopes equaled the total tumor-reactive CD8+ 
 T cell pool in the infu-
sion product (Figure 1d and 1e).
To address the stability of the CD8+ T cell-recognized neo-antigen 
repertoire, we compared neo-antigen-reactivity in peripheral blood and 
resected tumor tissue. CD8+ 
 T cell responses against both of the iden-
tified neo-epitopes were ex-vivo detectable in the blood of patient BO 
sampled before ACT. Their frequency increased after ACT (Figure 1f) 
and eventually contracted following complete tumor regression (not 
shown). Surprisingly, while the TIL06.07 culture isolated from the brain 
tumor resected just prior to ACT comprised almost exclusively CD8+ 
 T 
cells, T cell reactivity was only observed against the KIAP>L neo-antigen, 
 
and not against RPL28S>F (Figure 1g). Whereas the mutation and 
expression of the KIA0020 gene was present in both cell lines (Figure 1i 
 
and j), absence of RPL28S>F specific T cells coincided with absence

of the mutant allele encoding the RPL28S>F neo-antigen within the 
MEL06.07 cell line (Figure 1i and k). To assess if the cell lines were 
representative for the corresponding tumor samples, Sanger sequencing 
of the RPL28 mutation was performed in archival formalin-fixed tis-
sues and was consistent throughout (Figure 1i). Loss of heterozygosity 
(LOH) analysis by amplification of polymorphic markers around the 
RPL28 gene confirmed loss of the mutant RPL28 allele in tumor tissue 
06.07, whereas both alleles were present in early tumor tissue 05.18 and 
normal tissue (Figure 1l). The presence of a single detectable RPL28 
allele in 06.07 tumor tissue indicates the clonal outgrowth of a tumor 
subclone with LOH at this locus, and is consistent with absence of 
the RPL28S>F mutation within the MEL06.07 cell line and 06.07 tissue 
(Figure 1i). In line with these findings, T cells enriched for RPL28_S> 
F 
reactivity responded to MEL05.18 but not to the RPL28_S>F loss variant 
MEL06.07 (Figure 1h).
The loss of a neo-antigen recognized by T cells in a sequential tumor 
lesion is consistent with the concept of immunoediting. Furthermore, 
the data suggest that accumulation of neo-antigen specific T cells 
at the tumor site reflects local antigen presence. To address this, we 
investigated neo-antigen expression and reactivity in sequential lesions 
from a second patient. Patient AB was surgically treated for metastatic 
melanoma that spread to the axillary lymph nodes. From the resected 
tumor tissue, melanoma line MEL04.01 was established and used to 
expand tumor-specific T cells from the peripheral blood. Two years 
later, the patient developed a progressive liver lesion that was treated 
by ACT, resulting in disease stabilization (SD) for 3 months accord-
ing to RECIST1.1 and 6 months according to iRC29. Subsequently, the 
liver lesion was resected and used to generate TIL08.10. The patient 
remained disease free for a period of 4 years and then developed 
multiple subcutaneous, lung and bone lesions. Two subcutaneous 
lesions, 12.07 and 12.09, were resected for the isolation of TIL12.07 
and TIL12.09, respectively, and to establish melanoma line MEL12.07 
(Figure 2a).
The infusion product of patient AB comprised 70% of CD8+ 
 T cells, 
and 54% of these CD8+ 
 T cells were reactive against MEL04.01 used 
to generate the infusion product, whereas no reactivity was observed 
within the CD4+ 
 T cell fraction28. Again, dominant recognition of 
private antigens by infused T cells was suggested by the limited CD8+ 
 T 
cell-reactivity against shared antigens1,9 (< 
0.04% of CD8+ 
 T cells 
infused into patient AB recognized a shared PRDX5 or EphA2 
epitope; data not shown) and exclusive recognition of the autologous 
tumor within a panel of (partially) HLA-matched melanoma lines 
 
(Figure 2b).
MEL04.01 of patient AB displayed 226 expressed non-synonymous 
mutations and the infusion product used for ACT comprised CD8+ 
 T 
cells specific for the neo-antigens echinoderm microtubule associated 
protein like 1 p.R64W (EML1R>W), Septin-2 p.R300C (SEPT2R>C), and 
CAD protein p.R1854Q (CADR>Q) (Figure 2c). In all cases, no or only 
weak recognition of the corresponding wild type peptides was observed 
(data not shown).
Independent TIL cultures from tumor lesions of patient AB, resected 
before and after ACT, were screened for recognition of all putative neo-
epitopes present within the original MEL04.01 tumor (Figure 2d-g). 
Interestingly, TIL obtained before ACT (TIL04.01) did not react against 
any of the 3 identified neo-antigens and only weak reactivity against 
the MEL04.01 tumor from which they were derived. To assess the fate 
of the infused neo-antigen-specific T cell populations and the antigens 
they recognize, TIL08.10 obtained 2 years after therapy, and TIL12.07 
and TIL12.09 obtained 6 years after therapy were analyzed. A low-level 
T cell response against the EML1R>W neo-antigen was detectable in all 
3 TIL preparations, although not significantly above background in 
TIL12.07. Strikingly, within the 12.07 and 12.09 TIL preparations, no 
significant T cell reactivity was detectable against the CADR>Q neo-an-
tigen, and reactivity against the SEPT2R>C neo-antigen was absent from 
all post-ACT TIL preparations (Figure 2e-g). Thus, in this patient 
immunity towards defined CD8+ 
 T cell neo-antigens was observed 
after ACT, which was not detected in TIL before therapy, and which 
was again largely absent from subsequent lesions.
To address whether the observed loss of defined neo-antigen- 
specific T cells over time could be compensated by acquisition of novel 
T cell responses, TIL08.10, TIL12.07 and TIL12.09 were analyzed for 
recognition of additional neo-antigens that were encoded by muta-
tions present in the original tumor MEL04.01. This revealed a low-level 
 
T cell response towards the Programmed Cell Death Protein 10 p.P28S 
(PDCD10P>S) neo-antigen in TIL08.10 (Figure 2e) and a pronounced 
 
T cell response towards this neo-antigen in both TIL12.07 and TIL12.09 
(Figure 2f and 2g, respectively).
To assess whether absence of detectable SEPT2R>C, and CADR>Q 
neo-antigen specific T cell reactivity in TIL derived from subsequently 
resected post-ACT lesions coincided with altered neo-antigen expres-
sion, we compared the cell lines derived from the original MEL04.01 
tumor and the recurrent lesion MEL12.07 isolated 8-years later. HLA-
genotyping and flow cytometry revealed that both cell lines showed 
comparable HLA cell surface expression and no loss of HLA alleles 
(data not shown). Notably, while DNA sequencing revealed that the 
mutation in the CAD gene was still present in cells derived from the 
recurring lesion (Figure 3a), RNA expression analysis demonstrated an 
approximately 10-fold reduction in expression of this gene (Figure 3c). 
 
Furthermore, whereas RNA expression of the SEPT2 gene was not 
 
significantly altered in the cell line derived from the recurring lesion 
(not shown), the mutant allele encoding the SEPT2R>C neo-antigen 
that was present in the original tumor, was selectively lost in the tumor 
cell line derived from tumor tissue isolated 8 years later (Figure 3a 
and b). In agreement with these findings, selected SEPT2R>C-specific 
T cells (Figure 2h) responded to MEL04.01 but not to SEPT2R>C 
negative MEL12.07 tumor cells (Figure 2i). Next-generation ampli-
con sequencing revealed that the SEPT2C>T mutation was present in 
approximately 30% of the sequencing reads spanning the mutation in 
both the 04.01 tumor tissue and its corresponding cell line, whereas it 
was already lost in the liver lesion 08.10 resected after ACT, as well as in 
lesion 12.09 (Figure 3d). Of note, the PDCD10 c.82C> 
T and the EML1 
c.190C> 
T mutations were also detected in the 04.01 tumor tissue at 
frequencies (87% and 34% of sequencing reads, respectively) similar 
to those observed within the 04.01 cell line (Figure 3d). Furthermore, 
in contrast to the SEPT2C>T mutation, these mutations were detected 
in a similar proportion of sequencing reads in the subsequent clinical 
samples (Figure 3d), confirming that the different tumor lines were 
representative for the mutation status in the corresponding clinical 
samples. Strikingly, while the mutant PDCD10 allele was already pres-
ent in the first tumor line (MEL04.01), RNA expression of PDCD10 
had increased > 
 40-fold in the recurring MEL12.07 lesion (Figure 3c). 
Competitive allele specific PCR (KASP) analysis confirmed that all 
PDCD10 expression was derived from the mutant allele (Figure 3b). 
Thus, the observed loss of a mutant allele or changes of RNA expression 
in the tumors of patient AB corresponded exactly with the observed 
changes in neo-antigen-specific T cell reactivity.
In depth analysis of the tumor-specific reactivity of PBMC, infusion 
products and TIL revealed neo-antigen specific T cell reactivity in both 
long-term survivors after ACT. All mutations yielding these T cell- 
recognized neo-antigens were absent in the COSMIC cancer gene cen-
sus except SEPT2R>C that was described once11, suggesting that these are 
passenger mutations that do not contribute to cellular fitness. Over time, 
we observed changes in expression of 4 out of 6 detected neo-antigens. 
 
In 2 cases, the mutant allele was lost from a subsequent tumor, in one 
case expression of the mutant gene was substantially reduced, and in 
one case expression of the mutant gene was substantially increased. In 
4 out of 4 cases these changes in neo-antigen expression were paralleled 
by loss or gain of neo-antigen-specific T cell reactivity. The current 
data may both be explained by random clonal variation between tumor 
metastases and by true T cell-mediated selection of antigen-negative 
variants. While we cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses, 
 
support for the latter interpretation is provided by the selective

recognition of the early but not recurring lesions by both RPL28S>F and 
SEPT2R>C-specific T cells of the two patients. Regardless, the current 
data demonstrate that the interaction between human melanoma and T 
cells varies over time, in a way that is similar to the interaction between 
the T cell compartment and viral quasispecies23. We also note that the 
genetic differences and the differences in RNA expression between the 
sequentially obtained tumors characterized here reflect heterogeneity 
that has been observed within many human tumors6. As such, it is 
plausible that a similar drift of the neo-antigen repertoire will also be 
a factor in other human malignancies. Collectively, the data presented 
here demonstrate that under conditions in which a high frequency 
of tumor-specific T cells is present, tumor cell variants with reduced 
or lost neo-antigen expression can emerge, similar to what has been 
observed in mice8. The observation of concurrent acquisition of novel 
T cell reactivity implies that cancer immunotherapies should aim to 
exploit the adaptive capacity of the immune system in order to maintain 
strong immune surveillance over time.

Materials and methods
Subjects
The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the 
Leiden University Medical Center and written informed consent was 
obtained from all patients.
Cell lines and culture
Melanoma cell lines were previously generated from resected lesions 
of patients 05.18 and 04.0128. All other melanoma cell lines were also 
established in the laboratory of Medical Oncology (LUMC, Leiden, 
Netherlands) except for melanoma cell line BLM that was obtained 
from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, Netherlands), 
FM3 and FM6 were provided by P. thor Straten, Copenhagen, Denmark 
and MZ7.4-mel was obtained from J. Gutenberg University (Mainz, 
Germany). Cell lines were authenticated by HLA-genotyping and 
mycoplasma negative. All melanoma cell lines were cultured in tumor 
cell medium (i.e. DMEM (Life Technologies, Breda, The Netherlands) 
with 8% heat inactivated FCS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin 
(100 μ 
g/ml) and L-glutamine (4 mM) all from Lonza Biowhittaker 
(Breda, Netherlands)). HLA-genotyping of the cell lines was per-
formed by the department of Immunohematology and Blood bank of 
the LUMC. Autologous immortalized B cells, obtained by transduction 
with the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-6 and Bcl-XL13 were provided by 
AIMM therapeutics (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and were cultured 
in IMDM (Lonza) with 8% heat inactivated FCS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), 
streptomycin (100 μ 
g/ml) and L-glutamine (4mM). B cells were stimu-
lated twice a week with irradiated (70 Gy) CD40L expressing mouse L 
cell fibroblasts and mIL21 (50 ng/ml; AIMM therapeutics).
TIL were obtained by culturing small tumor fragments in T cell 
medium (IMDM with 7.5% heat-inactivated pooled human serum 
(Sanquin Blood bank, Dordrecht, The Netherlands), penicillin (100 IU/
ml), streptomycin (100 μ 
g/ml) and L-glutamine (4mM) supplemented 
with 1000 IU/ml rhIL-2 (Aldesleukin, Novartis). TIL medium plus 
rhIL-2 was refreshed every two to three days. Tumor-specific T cell 
batches were obtained by MLTC as described28. Briefly, PBMC were 
incubated with irradiated (100 Gy) autologous tumor cells at a 15:1 E/T 
ratio in T cell medium supplemented with rhIL-4 (10 U/ml; Cellgenix, 
Cellgro) to prevent expansion of NK cells. From day 2 onward medium 
was refreshed every two to three days with T cell medium plus rhIL-2 
(150 IU/ml). T cells were re-stimulated weekly with irradiated autolo-
gous tumor cells and cultured for a total of 4 weeks before cryopreser-
vation for further experiments and ACT treatment28.
To test for reactivity of T cells used for ACT against shared antigens 
a panel of (partially) HLA matched melanoma cell lines was used. At 
least one cell line with a matched allele for every HLA class II allele was 
tested. For HLA-class I alleles, 3-8 matched cell lines are tested for each 
allele, except for the heterozygously expressed HLA-A* 
23.01 and HLA-
B* 
49.01 in patient BO, for which no matched cell lines were available.
Neoantigen-identification
Whole exome and RNA sequencing was performed and 31-mer SLPs 
covering the non-synonymous somatic mutations were manufactured 
as previously described15. Importantly, no selection based on in silico 
prediction of MHC binding affinity was used in order not to exclude 
any potential epitopes preemptively. Next, T cells were incubation with 
target cells i.e. tumor cells or Bcl-6/Bcl-XL-B cells either unloaded or 
preloaded overnight with peptide pools or single peptides (10 μ 
g/ml 
per peptide). Reactivity of T cells was measured after 24-48 hours 
co-incubation with target cells by IFN-gamma secretion using ELISA 
(Sanquin, Amsterdam, Netherlands) or intracellular cytokine staining 
for IFN-gamma or expression of the activation marker CD137 by FACS 
analysis, as described28. Were indicated, neo-epitope-specific T cells 
were selected after overnight stimulation of T cells with specific SLP-
loaded Bcl-6/Bcl-XL-B cells using the CD137 MicroBead kit (Miltenyi 
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
Sanger sequencing of DNA samples
Cell line DNA was extracted with the Genomic Wizard DNA purifi-
cation kit (Promega, Leiden, Netherlands). DNA from microdissected 
formalin-fixed archival material was extracted with the NucleoSpin 
FFPE DNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) Primers were 
designed with Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/
primer-blast/) (see below). PCR reactions were carried out in 15 μ 
l with 
10 ng of DNA, 1x iQ Supermix (Bio-rad, Veenendaal, Netherlands), and 
10 pmol of forward and reverse primer. PCR products were purified 
with the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and 
sequenced in both forward and reverse directions at Macrogen Europe 
(Meibergdreef, The Netherlands).
real-time PCr gene expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol (ThermoFisher, Waltham, 
MA USA) method including DNAse treatment in suspension using 
rDNAse (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was synthesized using 2 μ 
g of RNA, 
50 ng of p(dT)15 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 0.3 μ 
g of Random Primers 
(ThermoFisher), 1 mM dNTPs (ThermoFisher), 4 μ 
l 5x AMV-RT 
buffer (Roche), 10 units of AMV-RT (Roche) and 20 units of RNasin 
Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). cDNA syn-
thesis was carried-out at 42 degrees for 1 hour. qPCR primers were 
designed with Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/
primer-blast/) (see below).
qPCR mixes consisted of: 2 μ 
l of 1:25 cDNA solution, 3 pmol of 
primer (Fw and Rv), iQ SYBR Green Supermix in 1 μ 
l for PDCD10 
and CPSF6 (housekeeping gene); 5 μ 
l of 1:25 cDNA solution, 6 pmol of 
primer (Fw and Rv), iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-rad) Amplification 
cycles: 95 degrees, 10 sec; 60 degrees, 30 sec for CPSF6 and PDCD10. 
 
95 degrees, 10 sec; 62 degrees, 30 sec; 72 degrees, 30 sec for EML1, CAD, 
and SEPT2. Melting was performed to confirm the specificity of the 
assays. The delta Ct method was applied to calculate the levels of gene 
expression, relative to the housekeeping gene. At least two independent 
measurements were performed to assess gene expression and the fold-
change in expression in the recurrent cell line relative to expression in 
the original cell line was calculated.
Amplicon next-generation sequencing
Amplicon next-generation sequencing was used to confirm that 
the cell lines were representative for the corresponding tumor 
 
tissue. Two independent primer sets per target were designed (see 
below) to amplify the SEPT2 c.898C> 
T, PDCD10 c.82C> 
T, and the 
EML1 c.190C> 
T mutations in the MEL04.01, MEL12.07, and their 
respective clinical samples. 18-mer, M13 tails were added to the 
5’-end of the forward (TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) and reverse 
(CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) primers. Two multiplex PCRs were 
performed for each sample; each PCR reaction containing one of the 
primer sets for each target. PCRs were performed with the FastStart™ 
High Fidelity PCR System (Roche). Following the pooling of both reac-
tions and purification with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), a 
second PCR was performed in order to integrate A and P1 adaptor 
 
sequences for Ion Torrent and distinct barcodes for each sample. 
Sample libraries were quantified by qPCR, normalized, and analyzed 
by the Ion PGM system in an Ion 318 chip (ThermoFisher Scientific). 
More than 10,000 sequencing reads covering each mutation were 
 
generated.
Allele-specific expression
SNP genotyping was performed using the competitive allele-specific 
PCR (KASPar) assay, following the manufacturer’s protocol (LGC 
Genomics, Berlin, Germany). The oligonucleotides were designed 
using Primerpicker (KBioscience, Hoddesdon, UK) (see below).
After initial denaturation at 94 degrees for 15 minutes, 10 cycles con-
sisting of 94 degrees for 20 seconds and touchdown from 65 degrees 
in 0.8 degrees steps per cycle were run. Subsequently, 30 cycles of 
 
94 degrees for 20 seconds, 57 degrees for 1 minute, and 25 degrees for

ten seconds followed by fluorescent detection were applied. Three inde-
pendent measurements were performed to assess allele specific expres-
sion. The cutoff value for specific expression is set at > 
500 relative 
fluorescence units (RFU based on the corresponding positive control.
loss of heterozygosity
The presence of polymorphic markers around the RPL28 and SEPT2 
genes was investigated with the UCSC genome browser. AFMA357YH1 
and D19S1142, and AFM182YA5 and RH56150, were employed to 
determine the zygosity status around the RPL28 and SEPT2 genes, 
respectively. Primers were designed around these markers (see below) 
and hexachloro-fluorescein label was added to the 5’-end of the 
 
forward primer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were 
performed with 10 ng of DNA in iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, 
CA). PCR products were mixed in a formamide solution containing 
GeneScan 500 TAMRA Size Standard (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, 
MA). Thereafter, samples were loaded in a 4-capillary 3130 DNA 
Analyzer and results were interpreted with the GeneMapper 4.1 
 
software (Applied Biosystems). The only marker that was informative, 
i.e., that presented a heterozygous status in the patient’s germline DNA 
was AFMA357YH1.
