Prescription Opioid Duration, Dose, and Increased Risk 
of Depression in 3 Large Patient Populations
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Recent results suggests the risk of a new onset of depression increases 
with longer duration of opioid analgesic use. It is unclear whether new-onset 
depression related to opioid analgesic use is a function of the dose prescribed or 
the duration of use or both.
METHODS Using a retrospective cohort design, we collected patient data from 
2000 to 2012 from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and from 2003 to 
2012 from both Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH) and the Henry Ford Health 
System (HFHS). Patients (70,997 VHA patients, 13,777 BSWH patients, and 
22,981 HFHS patients) were new opioid users, aged 18 to 80 years, without a 
diagnosis of depression at baseline. Opioid analgesic use duration was defined as 
1 to 30, 31 to 90, and more than 90 days, and morphine equivalent dose (MED) 
was defined as 1 to 50 mg/d, 51 to 100 mg/d, and greater than 100 mg/d of 
analgesic. Pain and other potential confounders were controlled for by inverse 
probability of treatment–weighted propensity scores.
RESULTS New-onset depression after opioid analgesic use occurred in 12% of 
the VHA sample, 9% of the BSWH sample, and 11% of the HFHS sample. Com-
pared with 1- to 30-day users, new-onset depression increased in those with 
longer opioid analgesic use. Risk of new-onset depression with 31 to 90 days of 
opioid analgesic use ranged from hazard ratio [HR] 
= 
1.18 (95% CI, 1.10-1.25) 
in VHA to HR 
= 
1.33 (95% CI, 1.16-1.52) in HFHS; in opioid analgesic use of 
more than 90 days, it ranged from HR 
= 
1.35 (95% CI, 1.26-1.44) in VHA to 
HR 
= 
2.05 (95% CI, 1.75-2.40) in HFHS. Dose was not significantly associated 
with a new onset of depression.
CONCLUSIONS Opioid-related new onset of depression is associated with longer 
duration of use but not dose. Patients and practitioners should be aware that opi-
oid analgesic use of longer than 30 days imposes risk of new-onset depression. 
Opioid analgesic use, not just pain, should be considered a potential source when 
patients report depressed mood.

INTRODUCTION
D
epression co-occurs with chronic noncancer pain1,2 and is known 
to be associated with opioid use. Patients with chronic noncancer 
pain and depression are more likely than those without depression 
to receive opioids,3 have a longer duration of use,4,5 take them at higher 
morphine equivalent doses (MEDs),6 and misuse and or abuse opioids.7,8 
A review of psychopathology in pain9 suggests the opioid epidemic in the 
United States reflects underdetected and undertreated mental illness in 
patients with chronic pain.
Every year more than 200 million prescriptions for opioids are writ-
ten in the United States.10 Known consequences of this opioid epidemic 
include abuse and accidental overdose.11-13 A less understood adverse 
outcome and emerging line of inquiry is the association between opioid 
use and risk of depression. In a study of nearly 50,000 Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA) patients, opioid analgesic use of longer than 180

days, compared with 1 to 90 days, was associated with 
significantly greater risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.51; 95% 
CI, 1.31-1.74) of a new diagnosis for depression.14 In a 
prospective study of chronic pain patients, those who 
increased their MED to more than 50 mg/d, compared 
with nonusers, had a 2.6 times greater probability of 
depression with time.15 These results remained after rig-
orous control for confounding.
Depression may be associated with opioid resis-
tance16 and with opioid misuse.17-19 The large population 
of patients receiving opioid therapy may experience 
a parallel, yet unrecognized, increase in depression. 
Firmly establishing that greater duration, dose, or both 
of opioid analgesic use are associated with a new onset 
of depression, and in diverse patient populations, can 
inform pain management and public health incentives. 
A fuller understanding of opioid-related depression is 
relevant to primary care in light of the increased provi-
sion of pain management in this setting.20
Our prior studies of the link between opioid anal-
gesic use and depression have several limitations,14,15 
including unknown generalizability to other US health 
care populations, and uncertainty as to whether dura-
tion and dose are both associated with depression. In 
addition, our previous study of VHA patients relied 
on diagnosis of painful conditions without patient-
reported pain scores and was conducted using a cohort 
designed for studies of incident heart disease.21
In this study, we expand our previous research14,15 
to determine (1) whether longer duration of opioid 
analgesic use is associated with new-onset depression 
while controlling for dose; (2) whether a higher dose 
is associated with new-onset depression after adjusting 
for duration; (3) whether opioid analgesic use remains 
associated with new-onset depression after control-
ling for pain scores in VHA patient data; and (4) and 
whether results generalize to 2 independent health 
care populations.
METHODS
Electronic medical record data were obtained from 3 
separate health care systems: Veterans Health Adminis-
tration (VHA), Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH), 
and the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS). The latter 
2 systems used data from the HMO Research Network 
Virtual Data Warehouse.22 Data included International 
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes; prescription records, 
laboratory results, and demographic information.
Cohort Eligibility
Samples were restricted to those aged 18 to 80 years at 
baseline and excluded those with a diagnosis of cancer 
or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Patients 
must have had at least 1 visit in each of the 2 washout 
years before the start of follow-up period during which 
cases of depression and opioid use were removed. The 
2-year washout has been applied previously as a con-
servative time frame to remove patients with common 
conditions.21,23 Patients must have had at least 1 visit 
after the follow-up period started. Patients who initi-
ated opioid analgesic use after the onset of depression 
were excluded because they did not provide informa-
tion regarding a new onset of depression. The end of 
the follow-up period was a new onset of depression or 
last known visit in the follow-up period. These criteria 
set up the temporal relationship so that incident opioid 
use occurred in patients without current depression 
and preceded any new-onset depression. The follow-up 
period was 2002 to 2012 in the VHA, and 2005 to 
2012 in BSWH and HFHS. Measures
Duration and Dose of Incident Period of Opioid 
Analgesic Use
Opioids included codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, 
hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine, oxycodone, 
oxymorphone, morphine, and pentazocine. Patients 
were considered continuous users if no gap of more 
than 30 days occurred between the end of one prescrip-
tion and the start of another. Duration was computed 
by summing the days’ supply variable that measures 
the days required to exhaust the medication if taken at 
the maximum dose prescribed. Patients were classified 
into 3 mutually exclusive groups: 1 to 30 days, 31 to 
90 days, and longer than 90 days’ continuous supply. 
Opioid use of longer than 90 days was chosen as the 
upper threshold because too few patients were available 
in private sector samples to model subgroups beyond 
180 days. Duration of use was computed until end of 
follow-up or the start of a longer than 30-day gap.
A morphine equivalent dose was calculated using 
standard equianalgesic conversion tables that provide 
the amount of morphine equivalent to the opioid in 
a given medication (eg, oxycodone). Daily dose was 
computed from days’ supply and total dispensed, 
assuming patients took the maximum dose prescribed 
per day. The MED of opioid on the last day before the 
end of the follow-up period or the last day before a 
longer than 30-day gap was used to assign patients to 
1 of 3 mutually exclusive groups: 1 to 50 mg/d, 51 to 
100 mg/d, and greater than 100 mg/d MED.
Outcome
New-onset depression was defined by 2 or more out-
patient diagnoses (ICD-9-CM codes: 296.2, 296.3 and 
311) within the same 12-month period or 1 or more 
inpatient diagnoses for depression. This diagnostic

algorithm has a 99% positive predictive value for a 
chart-reviewed diagnosis,24 and an 88% positive pre-
dictive value and a 71% negative predictive value com-
pared with self-reported lifetime of depression.25
Covariates
Except for pain scores and marital status, available only 
in VHA data, variables were available and measured 
the same way in each patient cohort. Demographics 
included age, sex, race, marital status, and insurance. 
Insurance was defined as federal coverage only (VHA 
and Medicare) vs other sources. ICD-9-CM codes 
were used to define posttraumatic stress disorder, any 
other anxiety disorder (a composite of panic disorder, 
generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive 
compulsive disorder, or anxiety disorder not other-
wise specified), alcohol abuse/dependence and illicit 
drug abuse/dependence (which includes opioid abuse/
dependence), and nicotine dependence or history of 
smoking. Comorbid health conditions included type 
2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular 
disease, low testosterone levels, sleep apnea, obesity 
defined by body mass index or ICD-9-CM code, and 
cardiovascular disease (a composite of hyperlipidemia, 
ischemic heart disease, disease of pulmonary circula-
tion, other heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, or 
myocardial infarction).
Painful conditions comprised 5 categories: arthritis, 
back pain, headaches, musculoskeletal pain, and neu-
ropathic pain, using previously reported ICD-9-CM 
codes for more than 900 conditions for which an opi-
oid may be prescribed.14,26 In VHA data we adjusted 
analyses for maximum pain scores reported at any time 
before the end of the follow-up period. The pain score 
is collected by a stand-alone clinical instrument used 
in primary care visits. The score is on a 10-point scale, 
with higher scores indicating worse pain.
To adjust for detection bias, we created a health 
care utilization variable defined by quartiles of the 
average number of clinic visits per month.
Propensity Scores and Data Weighting
Bias by indication may confound the association 
between duration or dose of opioid analgesic use and 
new-onset depression. To observe the direct contribu-
tion of opioid use to new-onset depression, potential 
confounders were balanced across levels of duration of 
opioid use and levels of MED using propensity scores. 
The propensity score is a conditional probability that 
a patient will receive a treatment. Covariates described 
above, including MED, were in the duration model. 
These same variables, plus opioid use duration, were 
included in the dose model. After obtaining the pro-
pensity scores, we applied inverse probability of treat-
ment weighting using standard approaches.27-29 Weight-
ing resulted in 2 pseudopopulations within each source 
of patient data, 1 for duration and 1 for dose. In the 
weighted data, survival models are not confounded by 
factors that predict exposure, as detailed elsewhere.27-30
Analysis
Before weighting data, we computed bivariate analyses 
including analysis of variance and t tests for continuous 
variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Bivariate 
analyses were recomputed after weighting to determine 
that variables balanced across levels of opiate use dura-
tion and MED. Observation time was defined as month 
of depression diagnosis since start of the follow-up 
period or right-censoring time. Right-censoring time 
is month of last known visit relative to the start of the 
follow-up period. Hazard ratios for time to new-onset 
depression were estimated using Cox proportional 
hazards models in which opioid use duration and MED 
were time-dependent variables. Fully adjusted Cox 
models included additional, time-dependent control 
variables for painful conditions and, in the VHA cohort, 
pain scores to account for change in pain after opioid 
initiation. The PHREG procedure in SAS 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute), with α set at .05, was used for the Cox regression 
models. Evaluation of hazard trends over time confirmed 
that proportional hazard assumptions were met for 
both duration (P = .33, P = .29, P = .08 in VHA, BSWH, 
HFHS, respectively) and dose (P = .62, P = .36, P = .13 
in VHA, BSWH, and HFHS, respectively). Two-tailed 
tests were conducted to allow for both risk factors and 
protective effects. This project was approved by the 
institutional review boards of participating institutions.
RESULTS
After excluding patients with missing data on any 
covariate, there were 70,997 VHA, 13,777 BSWH, and 
22,981 HFHS patients who were opioid-naive and free 
of depression at the start of follow-up (Figures 1, 2 and 
3). VHA patients were on average older, predominately 
male, and had a higher percentage of longer than 
90 days of opioid use compared with private sector 
patients. The distributions of MED and other patient 
characteristics by health system are shown in Table 1.
Among VHA patients, 11.6% of 1- to 30-day users, 
13.6% of 31- to 90-day users, and 14.4% of longer than 
90-day users had new-onset depression. Among BSWH 
patients, cases of new-onset depression increased from 
8.4% of 1- to 30-day users to 10.6% of 31- to 90-day 
users to 19% among longer than 90-day users. In HFHS 
patients, cases of new-onset depression increased from 
10.7% in 1- to 30-day users to 14.8% in 31- to 90-day 
users to 19.3% in longer than 90-day users.

New-onset depression was significantly associ-
ated with MED in VHA patients (P <.0001) but not in 
BSWH and HFHS patients. In VHA patients new-onset 
depression increased from 11.9% among those using 1 
to 50 mg/d of MED to 14.2% in those using 51 to 100 
mg/d of MED to 20.1% in those using greater than 100 
mg/d of MED. In BSWH patients new-onset depres-
sion occurred in 8.7% of those using 1 to 50 mg/d of 
MED, in 7.7% of those using 51 to 100 mg/d MED, and 
in 9.6% of those using greater than 100 mg/d MED. In 
HFHS patients new-onset depression occurred in 11.3% 
of those using 1 to 50 mg/d of MED, in 10.8% of those 
using 51 to 100 mg/d of MED, and in 12.4% of those 
using greater than 100 mg/d of MED.

The bivariate relationships between opiate analge-
sic users, covariates, and new onset of depression are 
available in Supplemental Appendix 1, Table 1, avail-
able at http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/1/54/
suppl/DC1. In each patient sample, opioid use duration 
and covariates were significantly associated with a new 
onset of depression. The bivariate associations between 
new-onset depression and covariates and duration of 
opioid use are shown in Supplemental Appendix 1, 
Table 2, and the bivariate associations of these vari-
ables by MED are available in Supplemental Appen-
dix 1, Table 3. Propensity scores models and inverse 
probability of treatment weighting were successful in 
removing significant associations between covariates 
and opioid use duration and dose. Balanced covariate 
distributions are shown by opioid use duration (Sup-
plemental Appendix 1, Table 4) and dose (Supplemen-
tal Appendix 1, Table 5). The prevalence of back pain 
across opioid use duration in the BSWH patient sample 
did not balance; however, this variable is included in 
multivariate survival models.
As shown in Table 2, before weighting data (model 
1), VHA patients who were 31- to 90-day users were 
significantly more likely to develop new-onset depres-
sion (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.16-1.31) com-
pared with 1- to 30-day opioid users. Similar results 
were found in BSWH and HFHS patients. Compared 
with 1- to 30-day opioid use, longer than 90 days of 
opioid use was significantly associated with new-onset 
depression in each patient sample.
In all 3 patient samples, after weighting data and 
adjusting further for potential persistent painful con-
ditions (see model 3), 31 to 90 days of opioid use, 
compared with 1 to 30 days of opioid use, was sig-
nificantly associated with new-onset depression (HR 
range = 1.18-1.33), and opioid use longer than 90 days, 
compared with 1 to 30 days, was significantly associ-
ated with new-onset depression (HR range = 1.35-
2.05). Hazard ratios obtained for risk from 31 to 
90 days and longer than 90 days of opioid use were 
significantly different from each other in VHA and 
HFHS patient samples.
As displayed in Table 3, before balancing variables 
in model 1 and without covariate adjustment, higher 
MED was associated with a new onset of depression. 
There were no significant associations between MED 
and new-onset depression in BSWH and HFHS patient 
samples before data weighting (model 1). After weight-
ing data and additional adjustment for pain in model 
3, and also for pain scores in VHA data, MED was not 
significantly associated with new-onset depression in 
VHA, BSWH, and HFHS patients.
DISCUSSION
In 3 separate diverse patient populations, longer 
duration of opioid analgesic use was associated with 
episodes of new-onset depression after controlling 
for pain conditions and daily MED. Hazard ratios 
increased from 1.18 (VHA) to 1.33 (HFHS) for 31- to 
90- day opioid use to a range of 1.35 (VHA) to 2.05

(HFHS) for longer than 90 days 
or opioid use; these point esti-
mates are significantly different 
from each other in VHA and 
HFHS. We observed that higher 
MED (greater than 100 mg/d) 
compared with lower daily MED 
(1 to 50 mg/d) was not associ-
ated with new-onset depression 
in models controlling for pain 
and opioid use duration. This 
finding is not consistent with 
our previous study, which found 
that increased MED is associated 
with greater probability of new-
onset depression. It is possible 
that increasing the MED was a 
proxy for duration in our previ-
ous report.15
Research on the efficacy of 
opioids in depression treatment, 
limited by small samples, short 
follow-up time, and lack of con-
trol groups, does not support 
opioids as effective long-term 
treatments for depression.31 This 
evidence, combined with the 
finding from the present study, 
supports the conclusion that 
opioids may cause short-term 
improvement in mood, but long-
term use is associated with risk 
of new-onset depression.
Limitations
Duration of opioid use did not 
account for intermittent opioid 
administration by patients and 
frequency of dose escalation. 
In preliminary analysis of VHA 
patient data, we found no evi-
dence of a dose-by-duration 
effect and no evidence that 
risk increased with longer use 
at higher doses. The report of 
pain is generated in the clinical 
setting. Thus, self-report bias 
is a possible limitation, because 
patients seeking opioids and 
those with poor mood may 
report more pain. We did not 
have statistical power to model 
use of longer than 180 days in 
private sector data. We speculate

that risk would continue to increase with longer dura-
tions, because our prior study of VHA data found that 
longer than 180-day opioid use compared with less 
than 90-day use was associated with new-onset depres-
sion (HR = 1.51; 95% CI,1.31-1.74).14
New-onset depression may have developed during 
or after opioid use cessation. Post hoc analysis in VHA 
data indicates 93.2% of cases of a new onset of depres-
sion occurred after the end of the incident opioid use. 
Of these patients, 8.7% had new-onset depression 
begin within 30 days, 8.3% within 31 to 180 days, and 
82.9% after 180 days postincident opioid use. The 
mean lag time between end of incident use and new-
onset depression was 3.4 years, (SD = 2.5 years). This 
lag time may be an overestimate, because symptoms of 
depression often begin well before patients seek treat-
ment and receive a diagnosis.
The current body of research contributes some 
evidence toward causality32 in that there is consistency 
of findings for duration of use across samples with 
substantial variation in demographic and disease pro-
files, the association is strong, and the temporal order 
is established. A dose-response relationship, however, 
does not exist for MED and new-onset depression, 
and residual confounding, especially in the case of 
maximum dose, may be present. A contribution of 
dose to new-onset depression should not be ruled out.

impaired functioning, opioid misuse, and family dys-
function is warranted.
There are several potential mechanisms for our 
findings. We speculate that long-term opioid analgesic 
use could lead to hyperalgesia,33 which in turn leads 
to a new onset of depression. Chronic opioid use may 
cause changes in neuroanatomy. Opioid analgesic use 
lasting 9 years vs less than 1 year in humans correlated 
with changes in functional connectivity in the nucleus 
accumbens and amygdala, regions associated with 
mood regulation, impulse control, reward, and motiva-
tion.34 Patients using an average of 78 mg of morphine 
per day had reduced gray matter in amygdala after 
30 days of use, with changes persisting for at least 4.7 
months after opioid cessation.35 These studies support 
the hypothesis that opioid exposure leads to neuroana-
tomical disturbance in brain regions associated with 
reward and pleasure, which could be the mechanism 
underlying new-onset depression. Consequences of 
chronic opioid analgesic use, such as low testosterone 
and opioid misuse, could also be in the causal pathway 
to new-onset depression.
Using the hazard ratio found in the VHA patient 
population, the number of patients exposed to longer 
than 90 days of opioid analgesic use that resulted in 1 
subsequent case of depression during our observation 
period is 12. Depression is a substantial public health 
problem given the magnitude of opioid exposure in the 
United States. The current results highlight additional 
concerns for primary care physicians of whom many 
report frustration and substantial burden in provision 
of optimal pain management.20
Patients should be informed of this association and 
be monitored for depression. Clinicians should con-
sider the pain-independent contribution of opioid use 
when depressed mood develops. Further research is 
warranted to identify which patients are most vulner-
able to opioid-related depression.
