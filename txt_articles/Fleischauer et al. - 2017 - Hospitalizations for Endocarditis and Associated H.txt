Hospitalizations for Endocarditis and Associated Health Care Costs 
Among Persons with Diagnosed Drug Dependence — 
North Carolina, 2010–2015

Opioid dependence and overdose have increased to epidemic 
levels in the United States. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health estimated that 4.3 million persons were nonmedical 
users of prescription pain relievers (1). These users are 40 times more 
likely than the general population to use heroin or other injection 
drugs (2). Furthermore, CDC estimated a near quadrupling of 
heroin-related overdose deaths during 2002–2014 (3). Although 
overdose contributes most to drug-associated mortality, infectious 
complications of intravenous drug use constitute a major cause of 
morbidity leading to hospitalization (4). In addition to infections 
from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), injecting drug users are at increased risk for acquiring 
invasive bacterial infections, including endocarditis (5,6). Evidence 
that hospitalizations for endocarditis are increasing in association 
with the current opioid epidemic exists (7–9). To examine trends 
in hospitalizations for endocarditis among persons in North 
Carolina with drug dependence during 2010–2015, data from 
the North Carolina Hospital Discharge database were analyzed. 
The incidence of hospital discharge diagnoses for drug dependence 
combined with endocarditis increased more than twelvefold from 
0.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons per year over this 6-year period. 
Correspondingly, hospital costs for these patients increased 
eighteenfold, from $1.1 million in 2010 to $22.2 million in 
2015. To reduce the risk for morbidity and mortality related 
to opioid-associated endocarditis, public health programs and 
health care systems should consider collaborating to implement 
syringe service programs, harm reduction strategies, and opioid 
treatment programs.
The North Carolina Hospital Discharge database (processed 
by Truven Health Analytics for the North Carolina State Center 
for Health Statistics) included discharge data from all 128 
hospitals in North Carolina, accounting for approximately 
1 million hospital admissions per year. Patients aged ≥18 years 
who were discharged with diagnosis codes (ninth and tenth 
revisions of Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification 
and Related Health Problems [ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM]) 
for both drug dependence and endocarditis (Supplemental 
Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/45932) were included 
in this analysis. Drug dependence was defined as discharge 
diagnoses indicating drug withdrawal or overdose/poisoning 
from or dependence on any drug, including cocaine, opioids, 
amphetamines, or hallucinogens. Endocarditis outcomes were 
determined using diagnosis codes for acute or chronic endocar-
ditis, and persons with diagnosis codes suggesting coinfections 
with HIV or HCV were identified.
Payer status was categorized as private insurance, Medicaid, 
Medicare, unidentified payer, and other. Patients with unidentified 
payers included those listed as self-pay (e.g., uninsured), unknown,

or missing. Cost was reported as the total cost billed by the 
hospital. Open-source, state-specific data were used to categorize 
counties as rural (<250 persons per square mile [ppsm]), a regional 
city (250–750 ppsm), or urban (>750 ppsm). To calculate 
the incidence rates of hospital discharge diagnoses for drug 
dependence combined with endocarditis among the general North 
Carolina population, census estimates of persons aged ≥18 years 
for 2010–2015 were used for denominators. Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests were used to analyze the hospital charge (cost) data. Incidence 
rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare incidence rates by age. 
Analyses were performed using spreadsheet and statistical software.
During 2010–2015, a total of 505 North Carolina residents 
aged ≥18 years were hospitalized with the two diagnoses of 
drug dependence and endocarditis (Table). Nearly two thirds 
of patients were aged ≤40 years, including approximately half 
who were aged 26–40 years. Patients were mostly white (87%) 
and non-Hispanic (92%), and the majority (60%) were from 
rural counties. Nineteen percent of patients hospitalized for 
endocarditis were uninsured and 23% were on Medicaid. HIV 
coinfections were uncommon (1.4%), but 36% of patients with 
endocarditis had past or current HCV infections.
The incidence of hospital discharge diagnoses for drug 
dependence combined with endocarditis among the 
general North Carolina population sharply increased 
during the study period, particularly beginning in 2013 
(Figure 1). Rates of hospital admissions for drug dependence–
associated endocarditis increased approximately twelvefold, 
from 0.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year in 2010 to

2.7 cases per 100,000 persons in 2015. The sharpest rate of 
increase occurred among persons aged 18–25 years (IRR 2.1; 
95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.4–3.1) and 26–40 years 
(IRR 3.8; 95% CI = 2.8–5.1) compared with rates in persons 
aged >40 years.
The median hospital charge for drug dependence–associated 
endocarditis hospitalization was $54,281; total costs of 
hospitalizations for drug dependence–associated endocarditis 
increased eighteenfold during 2010–2015, from $1.1 to 
$22.2 million (Figure 2). In 2015, 42% of patients with drug 
dependence–associated endocarditis were either uninsured or 
on Medicaid, accounting for a total $9.3 million in health 
care costs compared with only $481,000 in 2010 (p<0.01).
Discussion
The incidence of hospitalizations for drug-associated 
endocarditis is increasing rapidly, particularly among drug users 
who are younger, white, non-Hispanic, and from rural areas 
(7–9). Approximately one third of patients hospitalized with 
drug dependence–associated endocarditis in North Carolina 
during 2010–2015 were coinfected with HCV; this finding 
was not unexpected because injection drug use is a recognized 
risk factor for both endocarditis and HCV infection (5,7–9).
Among patients hospitalized for drug dependence–associated 
endocarditis, 42% were uninsured or had Medicaid coverage, 
suggesting that the health care system and public payers 
could share a larger proportion of the cost of the increasing 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Injection drug use and opioid dependence have increased to 
epidemic levels in the United States, and evidence suggests that 
bacterial complications of injection drug use, such as endocar-
ditis, are increasing.
What is added by this report?
In North Carolina, analysis of hospital discharge data identified 
an approximately twelvefold increase in hospitalizations for 
endocarditis combined with drug dependence during 2010–
2015. Consistent with overall trends in the U.S. opioid epidemic, 
the majority of patients were non-Hispanic, white, aged 
<40 years, and from rural areas; in addition, approximately one 
third were infected with hepatitis C virus. On average, the cost 
for each hospitalization for endocarditis exceeded $50,000, and 
42% of hospitalizations were among persons on Medicaid or 
without insurance. The total hospital costs of hospitalizations 
for drug dependence–associated endocarditis increased 
eighteenfold during 2010–2015.
What are the implications for public health practice?
As the U.S. opioid epidemic continues to grow, hospitalizations 
for infectious complications associated with injection drug use 
are likely to increase. Effective and cost-saving public health 
interventions, such as syringe service programs and harm 
reduction strategies, are needed to reduce disease burden and 
save health care costs. Collaboration between public health, 
health care systems, and policy makers is important to reduce 
the risks associated with injection drug use.

incidence of endocarditis, particularly if the costs of infectious 
complications of injection drug use, including endocarditis and 
HCV, continue to rise. These findings suggest a need to focus 
preventive interventions on harm reduction strategies such as 
syringe service programs, safe injection education, and treatment 
programs offering opioid agonist and antagonist therapies (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for 
drug use are subject to coding errors and misclassification (e.g., 
historic use versus current use). Only hospitalizations with 
drug dependence listed as a diagnosis were included in this 
analysis, but patients might not have disclosed drug use; thus, 
hospitalizations for drug dependence–associated endocarditis 
might have been under-ascertained. Second, administrative 
codes do not provide sufficient information to identify a 
causal association between current drug use and developing 
endocarditis. Third, administrative codes are nonspecific and do 
not identify the mode of drug dependency (e.g., injection, oral, 
or inhalation). Finally, the charge data do not reflect the actual 
cost to the health system or to the payer, but rather the initial 
charge billed by the hospital. Therefore, the cost data might be 
overestimated because of insurance-negotiated pricing.
In North Carolina, the incidence of hospitalizations for 
endocarditis among drug-dependent patients has increased 
twelvefold since 2010. Simple and cost-effective public health 
interventions such as syringe service programs and harm 
reduction strategies that include the use of fact-based drug 
education, drug-related illness and injury prevention, and drug 
treatment could lead to decreased morbidity as well as potential 
cost savings for the health care system in North Carolina. 
Coordination among public health providers, health care 
systems, and policy makers is essential to address the growing 
U.S. opioid epidemic and its consequences.
