neuroinflammation induced by neurotropic H7N7 and infection of the lung with a non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV result in long-term

trigger neuroinflammation and associated chronic alterations in the CNS.

Significance Statement
In the acute phase of influenza infection, neuroinflammation can lead to alterations in hippocampal neuronal morphology and
cognitive deficits. The results of this study now also provide evidence that neuroinflammation induced by influenza A virus (IAV)
infection can induce longer-lasting, virus-specific alterations in neuronal connectivity that are still detectable 1 month after
infectionandareassociatedwithimpairmentsinspatialmemoryformation.IAVinfectioninhumansmaythereforenotonlylead

 also been reported (Ekstrand, 2012; Shah et al., 2014). However,
the mechanisms and consequences of neuroinflammation caused
by influenza A virus (IAV) are only partly understood. Neurotropic
IAV strains are indeed able to enter the CNS through the blood–
brain barrier (BBB) or microvascular endothelial cells (Tomonaga,
2004). For instance, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
(H5N1) can infect the CNS and subsequently lead to neuronal
cell death in the substantia nigra pars compacta (Kristensson,
2006; Jang et al., 2012) induced by neuroinflammation through
the activation of glial cells and altered proinflammatory/inflam-
matory cytokine expression (Jang et al., 2009, 2012). Interest-
ingly, neuropsychiatric complications were not only reported
after infection with neurotropic IAV variants, but also after non-
neurotropic H1N1 virus infection, especially in children (Surana et
al., 2011). Neurodevelopmental problems were shown to be a risk
factorforasevereoutcomeafterinfluenzainfection,includingdeath
in children (CDC, 2012; Ekstrand, 2012). In this scenario, activation
of the peripheral innate immune system can induce the production
of proinflammatory/inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1�
(IL-1�),IL-6,andtumornecrosisfactor-�(TNF-�)withinthebrain
(Thomson et al., 2014; Riazi et al., 2015), thereby severely affecting
cognitionandemotionalbehavior(Raisonetal.,2006;Camaraetal.,
2015).
The hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and
memory processes (Korte and Schmitz, 2016), is especially sensitive
toneuroinflammation(Vitkovicetal.,2000;Lynch,2002;Henekaet
al., 2014). Inflammatory cytokines can impair hippocampal long-
termpotentiation(LTP)(PickeringandO’Connor,2007;Riazietal.,
2015) and inhibit neurotrophic factor signaling, thereby nega-
tively influencing synaptic plasticity and memory formation
(Tong et al., 2008, 2012). Furthermore, a decrease in hippocam-
pal dendritic spine density and impairment in synaptic plasticity
could be observed after activation of peripheral and central im-
mune responses (Jurgens et al., 2012; Vasek et al., 2016). Indeed,
it is now well established that a peripheral immune stimulation
can affect the intact CNS (Richwine et al., 2008) via the activation
of microglia during a secondary, mirror inflammatory response
in the brain (Riazi et al., 2015). Microglia, CNS-resident macro-
phages, are usually the first to be activated in response to brain
infections or damage. In contrast to this, nonactivated or “rest-
ing” microglia perform housekeeping functions within the
healthy CNS, including synapse turnover and synaptic plasticity.
Therefore, long-term microglial activation might interfere with
these processes (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Yirmiya and Goshen,
2011; Hristovska and Pascual, 2015).
Whereas a short-term influence of IAV infection on hippocam-
pal neuron morphology and cognition was shown recently in
mice for non-neurotropic PR8 (H1N1) IAV (Jurgens et al., 2012),
long-termeffectshavenotbeenstudiedsofar.Here,we investigated
the impact of three different IAV variants on hippocampal neu-
ron morphology and hippocampus-dependent behavior. First,
we used the well characterized PR8 (A/PuertoRico/8/34) non-
neurotropic virus (Majde et al., 2007; Hodgson et al., 2012). The
second non-neurotropic virus belonged to the H3N2 subtype,
maHK68 (mouse-adapted A/Hong-Kong/1/68) (Haller et al.,
1979). As a model for neurotropic IAV infection, the polybasic
rSC35M (recombinant A/Seal/Mass/1/80 mouse-adapted, H7N7)
was used (Gabriel et al., 2005). The long-term consequences of in-
fections with these viruses on CNS function and morphology have
not been investigated in detail.
Here, we describe impairments in spatial learning associated
with alterations in hippocampal structure and function and an
increased number of activated microglia as long-term consequences
of IAV infection. These findings point toward long-term hip-
pocampal neuroinflammation as the cause of the neurological
symptoms that lasted for 1 month after the infection.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement. The experiments performed with mice were approved
according to the animal welfare law in Germany. All protocols used in
this project have been reviewed and approved by the local committees at
the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and TU Braunschweig
and the authorities (LAVES, Oldenburg, Germany; permit number: 3392
42502-04-13/1234) according to the national guidelines of the animal
welfare law in Germany (Tierschutzgesetz in der Fassung der Bekannt-
machung vom 18, Mai 2006, BGBl. I S. 1206, 1313; das zuletzt durch
Artikel 20 des Gesetzes vom 9, Dezember 201, BGBl. I S. 1934 gea

worden ist). The virus was prepared by infection of 10-d-old embryo-
nated chicken eggs obtained from a commercial vendor (Charles River
Laboratories).

¨lsah Gabriel, Heinrich-Pette Institute, Hamburg
[rSC35M, mouse-adapted A/Seal/Mass/1/80 (H7N7); Gabriel et al.,
2005]. Virus stocks were propagated by infection of 10-d-old embryo-
nated chicken eggs (PR8M, maHK68) or in MDCK (Madin–Darby Ca-
nine Kidney) cell culture (rSC35M) as described previously (Wilk and
Schughart, 2012). Female inbred mice of the strain C57BL/6J were ob-
tained from Janvier and maintained under specific pathogen-free condi-
tions according to the German animal welfare law.
Mouse infections. Female C57BL/6J mice (Janvier) at the age of 8–10
weeks were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl
(Merck) ketamine–xylazine solution [85% NaCl (0.9%), 10% ketamine
(100 mg/ml), 5% xylazine (20 mg/ml); 10 ml per 1 kg body weight] and
then infected intranasally with a dose of 10 (H3N2 and H7N7) or 2 � 10 3
(H1N1) focus forming units (FFUs) of the respective virus in 20 �l of
sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Body weight was monitored for 2
weeks after infection. Mice showing �30% of body weight loss were
killed.
Viral load in the brain. To detect low amounts of virus in brain of
infected mice, egg infection was used as a more sensitive method to
determine viral load. For this purpose, brains were homogenized in PBS
with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) using the Fast Prep instrument.
Debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 rpm. The
samples were stored in aliquots at �70°C. In a first test, 50 �l of undi-
luted samples were given per embryonated egg (three replicates per sam-
ple). After 48 h of incubation at 37°C, allantoic fluid was harvested and
tested using the hemagglutination assay (Wilk and Schughart, 2012) for
virus positivity. Samples identified to be positive for the virus were
further quantified by the 50% egg infectious dose assay as described
previously (Szretter et al., 2006). Titers were calculated using the Reed–
Muench method.
Histology. Brains from infected mice on indicated days after infection
were extracted in toto and immersion fixed for 24–72 h in 4% buffered
formaldehyde solution, pH 7.4. After fixation and before embedding, the
brains were separated in transverse sections using a coronal matrix sys-
tem following standard guidelines (Morawietz et al., 2004). In addition
to the recommended planes, the nasal part was divided within the sagittal
median to include the olfactory bulbs (OBs) in the histological analysis.
Sections of brains (0.5 �m) were cut with the microtome and stained
with H&E or immunostained with mouse-anti-IAV nucleoprotein (NP),
cloneHb65,mouselgG2a(Kerafast,catalog#FCG013,RRID:AB_2716646).In-
flammation in the infected brain was evaluated using a semiquantitative
scoring system for perivascular mononuclear cuffing (0 � normal, � �
single inflammatory cells, �� � 2–3 layers of infiltrates, and ��� �
�3 layers of infiltrates). In addition, immunohistochemistry for the virus
was analyzed using a semiquantitative scoring system from 0 � no, 1 �
few, 2 � multiple, to 3 � numerous infected cells (Gerhauser et al.,
2007). Several brain regions, including the OB, cerebral cortex, corpus

 striatum/basal ganglia, thalamus/hypothalamus, hippocampus, mesen-
cephalon, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, were evaluated separately
and a mean value determined for each animal.
Behavioral assays. For behavioral evaluation, 4 groups of 8- to 10-
week-old female C57BL/6J mice were treated intranasally with PBS as
control and H1N1, H3N2, and H7N7 IAV strains and then assigned to
two different time points of the experiment, including 30 and 120 dpi
(n � 7–10). All behavioral experiments were performed the same time of
day during the light period by an experimenter blinded to all types of
treatment groups.
Open-field test. To investigate influenza-induced illness behavior and
willingness of the mice to explore, the open-field test was performed as
described previously (Walsh and Cummins, 1976). Briefly, mice were
placed along one side of a white PVC open-field apparatus (40 � 40 �
40 cm) for 5 min. The central area of the arena was specified as the center
part (30 � 30 cm). Between each session of experiments, the apparatus
was cleaned with Bacillol. Movement data, including total distance trav-
eled, average speed, and percentage of activity in the periphery and in the
center part of the arena, were collected by ANY-maze behavioral tracking
software (Stoelting, RRID:SCR_014289).
Elevated plus maze test. To investigate influenza-induced anxiety-like
behavior, the elevated plus maze test was performed as described previ-
ously (Hogg, 1996). In this test, the apparatus is composed of a cross with
two opposed open arms (25 � 5 cm) and two opposed closed arms (25 �
5 cm, surrounded by 20-cm-high walls). The arena was made of white
PVC and was elevated 50 cm above the floor. Mice were placed in the
central part of the arena (5 cm � 5 cm) facing toward an open arm and
permitted to move freely in the arena for 5 min. Locomotion data,
including the percentage of time spent in open and closed arms, were
collected by ANY-maze behavioral tracking software (Stoelting, RRID:
SCR_014289).
Morris water maze test. To investigate the effects of IAV infection on
cognitive function, spatial learning and memory formation were assessed
using the initial training and the reversal learning phase of the Morris
water maze paradigm (Morris, 1984; Vorhees and Williams, 2006). The
maze is comprised of a circular pool 150 cm in diameter and 19–20°C
water temperature. The platform was 10 cm in diameter and hidden 1 cm
underneath the surface of the opaque water (Titaandioxide; Euro OTC
Pharma). Before the training, a visible platform task was performed as
a pretraining and was used to ensure that swimming ability and visual
acuity were intact in control and treated animals. During this phase, the
animals had two trials (maximum of 60 s each) per day for 3 consecutive
days to reach the visible platform; the position was altered during the
trials (data are not shown). Subsequently, training in the Morris water
maze test was performed for 8 d with the invisible platform located in the
NE quadrant. Each day, animals were placed in the water for four trials
with different starting points (SE, S, W, and NW) randomly. The animals
were permitted to swim freely for 60 s or until the platform was reached.
Otherwise, they were guided to the platform and allowed to sit on it for
20 s. A detailed analysis of the swimming path allows for a qualitative
assessment of learning in mice. Progressively, over time, healthy animals
switch from egocentric (hippocampus-independent: chaining, scanning
and random swimming) to allocentric (hippocampus-dependent: di-
rected search) strategies to navigate to the hidden platform while a spatial
map of the maze is formed (Garthe et al., 2009; Garthe and Kemper-
mann, 2013). The pathway map to find the platform was analyzed as
follows: searching strategies including scanning characterized by �60%
and �10% surface coverage, chaining characterized by �80% time in a
doughnut-shaped annulus zone, and random swimming characterized
by �60% surface coverage of the whole pool area in a directed search
characterized by �80% time in Wishaw’s corridor (Whishaw, 2004;
Garthe et al., 2009; Garthe and Kempermann, 2013).
To evaluate memory retrieval, two probe trial tests were performed at
the third and sixth day of the acquisition training before starting the four
trials of training at that day. Another reference memory test was per-
formed 24 h after the last day of acquisition training. During the probe
trial, the platform was removed and the animals were allowed to swim
freely for 45 s. After the third probe trial test, the platform was moved to
the opposite quadrant of the pool (SW) to test the ability of the animals to
form a new memory. The task consisted of 3 training days. On the fourth
day, one single probe trial was performed (D’Hooge and De Deyn, 2001).
All data, including the escape latency (time to reach the platform),
percentage of searching time spent in the four quadrants of the pool,
percentage time spent in the border (thigmotaxis), annulus (chaining),
central circle (scanning) zones, and Whishaw’s corridor (directed search) of
the pool, and occupancy plots of the presence in the quadrants for the
animals groups were collected by ANY-maze behavioral tracking soft-
ware (Stoelting, RRID:SCR_014289).
Electrophysiological experiments. To investigate the function of CA1
hippocampal neurons, electrophysiological recording experiments were
performed at 30 and 120 dpi. At 30 dpi, a total number of 45, and at 120
dpi, a total of 38 acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 14 and 12
female mice in three groups which were inoculated by PBS as control and
H3N2 and H7N7 influenza virus 8–10 weeks after birth. Briefly, mice
were deeply anesthetized with 100% CO2, killed, and then brains were
quickly removed and transferred into ice-cold carbogenated (95% O2
and 5% CO2) artificial CSF (ACSF) containing the following (in mM):
124 NaCl, 4.9 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.0 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 24.6 NaHCO3,
and 10 D-glucose, pH 7.4. Afterward, the hippocampus was dissected and
transverse hippocampal slices (400 �m) were obtained using a manual
tissue chopper. The whole procedure was done in 2–3 min. The hip-
pocampal slices were transferred to an interface recording chamber
(Scientific System Design), where they were incubated at 32°C with a
constant flow rate (0.5 ml/min) of carbogenated ACSF for 2 h before the
start of recordings. Field EPSPs (fEPSPs) were recorded in the stratum
radiatum of the CA1 region in hippocampal slices. Responses were
evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway using two mo-
nopolar, lacquer-coated stainless-steel electrodes (5 M�; AM Systems).
These stimulation electrodes (S1 and S2) were positioned equidistantly
on both sides of the recording electrode and, by this means, two inde-
pendent stimulation pathways could be used for the same CA1 recording
region. For recording fEPSPs (measured as the first slope function), the
recording electrode (5 M�; AM Systems) was placed in the CA1 apical
dendritic layer (at least 20 �m away from the stratum pyramidale) and
signals were amplified by a differential amplifier (Model 1700; AM Sys-
tems). The signals were digitized using a CED 1401 analog-to-digital
converter (Cambridge Electronic Design). An input–output curve (af-
ferent stimulation vs fEPSP slope) for assessment of basal synaptic trans-
mission was generated after the preincubation period. Test stimulation
intensity was modified to be adjusted to extract fEPSP slope as 40% of the
maximal fEPSP response for both synaptic inputs S1 and S2. To investi-
gate short-term plasticity, a paired-pulse stimulation protocol was used
with two consecutive stimuli with equal intensity from one of the stim-
ulating electrodes in each hippocampal slice. Paired-pulse facilitation
(PPF) could be extracted from the fEPSP slopes as a response to the
second stimulation over the first one at different interpulse intervals of
10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ms. To investigate LTP, 20 min after baseline
recording, LTP was induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) including
four bursts at 100 Hz repeated 10 times in a 200 ms interval. This stim-
ulation was repeated three times in a 10 s interval. Only healthy sections
with a stable baseline were included in the electrophysiological data anal-
ysis. The slope of fEPSPs was measured over time and normalized to the
baseline. Data acquisition and offline analysis were performed using In-
traCell software (version 1.5, LIN).
Golgi–Cox staining. To investigate the long-term effects of IAV infec-
tion on hippocampal neuron morphology, 4 groups of 2-month-old
female C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intranasally with PBS as control
and the H1N1, H3N2, and H7N7 IAV strains. Mice were deeply anesthe-
tized with CO2 and killed via decapitation at 30, 60, and 120 dpi (n �
4–5). The whole brain was removed rapidly. The left hemisphere was
prepared for further immunohistochemical experiments, whereas the
right one was incubated in FD rapid Golgi stain kit (FD NeuroTechnolo-
gies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Afterward, hemispheres
were blocked in 2% agar and 200-�m-thick coronal sections were cut
with a vibratome (Leica, VT 1000 S) and mounted on gelatin-coated glass
slides. Subsequently, the sections were processed for signal development
before being dehydrated through graded alcohols and mounted using
Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Hosseini et al. • Long-Term Neuroinflammation Induced by IAV Infection
 Immunohistochemistry. To determine the inflammatory response in
the hippocampus after influenza infection, the left hemisphere was iso-
lated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h and then cryo-
protected in 30% sucrose solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 24 h
and stored in Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature compound
(Hartenstein Laborversand) at �70°C. For fluorescence immunostain-
ing, 30 �m sections were cut using a freezing microtome (Frigomobil; R.
Jung). Afterward, 10 successive sections (5 for IBA-1 staining and 5 for
GFAP staining) were washed with PBS 1� and blocked in PBS 1� solu-
tion containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% goat serum, and 1% BSA for 1 h
at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with
the following primary antibodies: anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor
molecule 1 (IBA-1) (1:1000; rabbit polyclonal; Synaptic Systems, catalog
#234 003, RRID:AB_10641962) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) (1:1000; mouse monoclonal; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #G3893,
RRID:AB_477010) were diluted in PBS 1�, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10%
goat serum. Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated AffiPure goat
anti-rabbit IgG (H�L) (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories,
catalog #111-165-144, RRID:AB_2338006) and Cy3-conjugated Affi-
Pure goat anti-mouse IgG (H�L) (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, catalog #115-165-068, RRID:AB_2338686), which were di-
luted in PBS 1�. Sections were mounted using Fluoro-gel mounting
medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences).
Imaging and image analysis. To survey the hippocampal neuron mor-
phology, second- or third-order branches of apical dendrites within the
CA1 and CA3 and dendrites within the dentate gyrus (DG) superior and
inferior subregions of the hippocampus (10 cells per animal, 40–50 den-
drites per group) were imaged in 3D (z-stack thickness of 0.5 �m) using
an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an ApoTome
module (Zeiss) with a 63� [numerical aperture (NA), 1] oil objective
and a digital camera (AxioCam MRm; Zeiss). In all selected neurons,
spine density per micrometer dendrite was calculated using Fiji software
(BioVoxxel, RRID:SCR_015825) on the segments of dendritic branches
with a length of �60–70 �m located at least 50 �m away from the soma.
The total number of spines along the segments of dendritic branches was
determined manually by an investigator blinded to the type of treatment.
The IBA-1- and GFAP-stained images from hippocampal subregions
including CA1, CA3, and superior and inferior blade of DG (n � 2–5
mice per each group and 5 frames per each animal, 10–25 frames per
group) were taken in 3D (z-stack thickness of 1 �m) using an Axioplan 2
imaging microscope (Zeiss) microscope equipped with a 20� objective
(NA, 0.8) and a digital camera (AxioCam MRm; Zeiss). To quantify the
density of microglia and astrocytes, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn
in each frame of the hippocampal subregions, the total number of IBA-1-
and GFAP-positive cells with clearly visible nuclei by DAPI were deter-
mined manually with Fiji software (BioVoxxel, RRID:SCR_015825), and
the sampled volume was calculated. Results are expressed as the number
of cells per cubic millimeter of tissues and then normalized to control.
For morphometric analysis of IBA-1 positive cells, at least 30 microglial
cells (6 cells per each ROI) were randomly selected per hippocampal
subregions of IBA-1 stained images from each animal (n � 4–5 per
group, 120–200 microglial cells per each group). The total primary
microglial cell processes were counted using Fiji software (BioVoxxel,
RRID:SCR_015825). For the immunohistochemical experiments, all
slides were coded and analysis was performed blindly.
Evaluation of BBB permeability. To determine BBB integrity after IAV
infection, spectrophotometry was used. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6J
mice (n � 3–4 per each group) were infected by H3N2 and H7N7 IAV;
then, at 4, 8, and 10 dpi, they were injected with a 2% Evans blue solution
(Sigma-Aldrich) in normal saline (4 ml/kg body weight) intraperitone-
ally. The dye was allowed to distribute by the circulatory system for 5 h (4
and 8 dpi) to 20 h (10 dpi). Afterward, the mice were killed and the brain
was isolated, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at �70°C until further
use. The preparation of tissue for assessing the presence of Evans blue
stain in the brain as an indicator of a compromised BBB was performed
as described previously (Manaenko et al., 2011). Evans blue absorbance
was detected at 610 nm using a spectrophotometer (Denovix, DS-11 fx).
ELISA. To quantify the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, in-
cluding IFN-� and TNF-�, in the blood serum and supernatant of
homogenized hippocampi or brain hemispheres of influenza-infected
mice, an ELISA experiment was performed. For this purpose, 8-week-old
female C57BL/6J mice (n � 3–4 per each group) were inoculated with
IAV strains and PBS as a control. Body weight was monitored and the
samples were collected at 8 dpi (before, the maximum body weight loss
was observed at this time). Mice were deeply anesthetized with CO2 and
killed via decapitation. Blood was collected using a pipette and incubated
for at least 30 min at room temperature. To separate the serum from the
cellular blood components, the samples were centrifuged at 2000 � g for
20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen. For protein isolation, the tissue was homogenized using
an Eppendorf-fitting pestle in 400 �l of STKM lysis buffer containing the
following (in mM): 250 sucrose, 50 Tris-HCl, 25 KCl, and 5 MgCl2, along
with a protease inhibitor mixture (cOmplete). The samples were centri-
fuged at 4°C for 10 min at 13,000 � g. The supernatant was collected and
stored at �70°C. To determine cytokine level, a mouse IFN-� and TNF-�
ELISA kits (R&D Systems) were used according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a Tecan
Sunrise microplate reader with a wavelength correction at 680 nm con-
nected to Magellan software. Finally, the measured optical density of the
reaction was compared with the optical density of the known standard
samples to determine protein concentration in the samples.
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis by microarray. At 18 and
30 dpi, mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and the hippocampus was
removed. Immediately after dissection, the tissue was placed into RNAl-
ater solution (Qiagen), incubated overnight at 4°C, and stored at �20°C.
For each group, hippocampi from at least three mice were prepared as
independent biological replicates. Tissues were homogenized with
FastPrep-24 instrument placing them in a 2 ml of lysing matrix tube
(MP Biomedicals) containing 1 ml of QIAzol lysis reagent. Homoge-
nization was performed with 6.0 m/s speed for 1 min. Isolation of
RNA was performed with the Rneasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen).
The quality and integrity of the RNA was controlled on the 2100 Bioana-
lyzer (Agilent Technologies). For DNA microarray hybridization, 100 ng
of total RNA was applied for the Cy3-labeling reaction using the one
color Quick Amp Labeling protocol (Agilent Technologies). Labeled
cRNA was hybridized to Agilent Technologies mouse 4x44k microarrays
for 16 h at 68°C and scanned using the Agilent Technologies DNA Mi-
croarray Scanner.
Microarray data were analyzed using the R software package (R Core
Team, 2013; R Project for Statistical Computing, RRID:SCR_001905).
Preprocessing steps included background correction, quantile normal-
ization, and annotation using the MmAgilentDesign026655.db (Carlson,
2014), LIMMA (Smyth, 2004) and Agi4x44PreProcess (Gentleman et al.,
2004) packages. Multigroup comparisons and identification of differen-
tially expressed probesets (DEPs) were performed with the LIMMA package
(Smyth, 2004) using Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple test-
ing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). DEPs between two groups were
identified based on an adjusted p-value of �0.1 and exhibiting more than
a 1.4-fold (log2 of 0.5) difference in expression levels. KEGG pathway
enrichment analysis and cluster profiling was performed with the pack-
age clusterProfiler (Yu et al., 2012). The raw data have been deposited in
the GEO expression database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under
the accession number GSE106620.

Infection of C57BL/6J mice with different IAV variants:
establishing mouse models to study the long-term effects of
influenza infection on CNS function
Female C57BL/6J mice at the age of 8–10 weeks were infected
with IAV by intranasal instillation with three different mouse-
adapted viruses. Earlier studies demonstrated that female mice
are more susceptible and produce more neutralizing antibodies
and higher levels of chemokines and cytokines than males during
infection with influenza viruses (Geurs et al., 2012), so only fe-
male mice were used in this study. Here, we investigated three
different IAVs. We chose the well characterized non-neurotropic
mouse-adapted human PR8 (H1N1) virus (Blazejewska et al.,
2011), which is known to enter the olfactory nerves and the glo-
merular layer of the OB within 4 h after intranasal infection, but
without further replicating in the brain or inducing neuropathol-
ogy (Majde et al., 2007; Hodgson et al., 2012). This specific IAV
variant was also used by Jurgens et al. (2012) to demonstrate
altered hippocampal neuron morphology and impaired cogni-
tion during the acute phase of the infection (7 dpi). In addition,
we included another non-neurotropic mouse-adapted human
IAV strain, the maHK68 (H3N2) (Haller et al., 1979) in our studies,
for which we established a well characterized mouse model (Leist
et al., 2016). Furthermore, we included the neurotropic virus
rSC35M (H7N7), which was isolated from seals and adapted to
mouse (Gabriel et al., 2005). The advantage of using this virus is
that most infected mice survive the infection. This allowed us to
study the long-term effects of a neurological IAV infection. Such
studies cannot be performed with the highly pathogenic H5N1
virus that is often used as model for neurotropic IAV infections
because all infected mice will die within 5–10 dpi. Avian H7N7 vi-
ruses are able to infect humans and represent a potential future pan-
demic threat (Lang et al., 1981; Banks et al., 1998; Fouchier et al.,
2004; Shinya et al., 2005).
The infection doses for all three viruses were adjusted to sub-
lethal concentrations, allowing us to study long-term effects of
IAV infections. Using these doses, 100% of H1N1- (100 � 0%,
n � 37), 84% of H3N2- (84.12 � 4.60%, n � 63), and 76% of
H7N7 (76.34 � 4.40%, n � 93)-infected mice survived the infec-
tion. Infection with all three viruses resulted in comparable body
weight losses (Fig. 1A). The maximum weight loss in H3N2- (n �
13) and H7N7 (n � 18)-infected mice occurred at 9 dpi and in
H1N1-infected animals (n � 11) at 8 dpi.
First, the brains of IAV-infected mice were analyzed for the
presence of infectious virus particles (Fig. 1B). For this, we used
the highly sensitive egg-infectious dose assay. Consistent with
previous studies, we did not detect any infectious virus particles
in the brains of H1N1-infected mice, whereas infectious particles
were found in different regions of the brain (mesencephalon,
thalamus, medulla oblongata, cerebellum, cortex, OB, and hip-
pocampus) after H7N7 infection. In the brains of H3N2-infected
mice, no or only very low amounts of infectious virus particles
could be detected, confirming that it is not able to replicate effi-
ciently in the CNS (Fig. 1B).
To investigate in detail the pathological alterations caused by
infections with the three viruses, histological sections of the brain
were analyzed. In the brains of H7N7-infected mice, many cells
stained positive for viral NP. Moderate infiltration of meningeal
and perivascular immune cells (B cells, T cells, and macrophages)
and several foci of gliosis (astrocytes and microglia) were also
detected (Fig. 1C–F). However, no lesions and only few single
NP-positive cells were observed after H3N2 infection (Fig. 1C,E,F).
In the case of H1N1, we did not observe any pathological changes.
Additional analysis of other organs by PCR and immunohisto-
chemistry verified that H3N2 was detectable, but did not replicate
in organs other than the lung.
IAV infection causes cognitive impairment
Because influenza infection can be accompanied by neurological
symptoms (Ekstrand, 2012), we were interested in determining
whether infection with different virus strains would affect mouse
behavior in a virus-specific manner. We chose the well estab-
lished Morris water maze task as a paradigm to investigate the
long-term consequences of IAV infection influence on learning
and spatial memory formation (Morris, 1984; Vorhees and Wil-
liams, 2006). Before the learning paradigm, general locomotor
activity and exploratory behavior were tested in the open-field
test to exclude that phenotypes observed in the water maze task
would be purely attributable to hyperactivity in infected individ-
uals. Neither control nor IAV-infected mice showed any sickness
behavior or deficits in locomotors activity (Fig. 2A–D). Con-
versely, the outcome of the Morris water maze task can be influ-
enced by anxiety; for example, when the animals avoid the open
water part of the maze and rather show thigmotaxis behavior,
staying close to the pool walls. We therefore tested for a potential
increase in anxiety-related behavior at 30 and 120 dpi using the
elevated plus maze test. Neither control nor infected mice re-
vealed significantly elevated anxiety levels (Fig. 2E,F).
To investigate the effects of IAV infection on cognitive func-
tion, training in the Morris water maze task was performed start-
ing at 30 and 120 dpi (Figs. 3, 4, 5). During 8 d of acquisition
training, the escape latency reduced significantly in control and
in infected mice (Fig. 3A,B), thereby indicating that all groups
showed hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory for-
mation [repeated-measures one-way ANOVA: FControl-30dpi(7,49) �
11.21, p � 0.000 (n � 8), FH1N1-30dpi(7,63) � 12.99, p � 0.000
(n�10),FH3N2-30dpi(7,42)�9.50,p�0.000(n�7),FH7N7-30dapi(7,49)�
7.19, p � 0.000 (n � 8), FControl-120dpi(7,42) � 18.11, p � 0.000 (n � 7),
FH3N2-120dpi(7,42) � 5.61, p � 0.000 (n � 7), and FH7N7-120dpi(7,49) �
10.11, p � 0.000 (n � 8)]. However, the escape latency in H7N7-
infected mice at 30 dpi was significantly increased compared with
control, non-neurotropic H1N1- and H3N2 IAV-infected mice
(Fig. 3A), pointing out an impairment in memory formation
after infection with this neurotropic virus (two-way ANOVA
FTreatment(3,1024) � 57.85, p � 0.0001, both factors fixed). Three
months later, at 120 dpi, analysis of the escape latency in control
and IAV-infected mice during the training did not reveal any
significant differences (two-way ANOVA FTreatment(2,680) � 0.35,
p � 0.70, both factors fixed; Fig. 3B). To assess memory retrieval,
reference memory tests (probe trials) were performed at days 3, 6,
and 9 of the training phase (Fig. 3C,D). The results revealed that
the percentage of time spent in the target quadrant by H1N1 and
H3N2-infected mice at 30 dpi increased over the training time
similar to control mice (one-way ANOVA: FDay3(2,22) � 2.48, p �
0.10; FDay6(2,22) � 1.04, p � 0.37; and FDay9(2,22) � 3.23, p �
0.058). H7N7-infected mice showed an impairment in memory
retrieval indicated by a significantly reduced preference for the
target quadrant on day 6 and 9 compared with the other groups
tested (one-way ANOVA: FDay3(3,29) � 3.22, p � 0.03; FDay6(3,29) �
5.78, p � 0.003; and FDay9(3,29) � 3.91, p � 0.01; Fig. 3C). At 120
dpi, the quadrant preference was comparable between all groups
regardless of the previous infection (FDay3(2,19) � 0.27, p � 0.76;
FDay6(2,19) � 1.38, p � 0.274; FDay9(2,19) � 0.20, p � 0.81; Fig. 3D).
A detailed analysis of the swimming path allows for a qualita-
tive assessment of learning in mice (Fig. 4). All groups of control

 and IAV-infected mice showed an augmentation of hippo-
campus-dependent searching during the training. However, this
progression was clearly decreased for IAV H3N2- and H7N7-
infected animals 30 dpi (day 4: control: 40.62 � 8.09%; H1N1:
42.50 � 8.37%; H3N2: 21.42 � 6.52%; and H7N7: 18.75 �
4.09%; two-way ANOVA FTreatment(3,232) � 11.29, p � 0.0001,
both factors fixed; Fig. 4A). No significant differences in the rel-
ative percentage of strategies used between IAV-infected and
control mice were observed during the training at 120 dpi (two-
way ANOVA FTreatment(2,152) � 1.32, p � 0.26, both factors fixed;
Fig. 4B).
In the reversal Morris water maze paradigm, which is de-
pendent on cognitive flexibility, the hidden platform was
moved to the opposite quadrant (SW) (Fig. 5). During 3 d of

creased significantly in control (repeated-measures one-way

infected mice, at 30 dpi (FH3N2-30dpi-R(2,12) � 2.59, p � 0.08, Fig.
5A). H7N7-infected mice showed a significantly increased escape
latency compared with control and H1N1-infected mice. There-
fore, both the H3N2 and H7N7 viruses led to a reduced ability to
memorize the new location of the hidden platform 30 dpi (two-
way ANOVA FTreatment(3,384) � 9.30, p � 0.0001, both factors
fixed; Fig. 5A). IAV-infected mice tested at 120 dpi revealed no
significant differences in escape latency compared with control
animals (two-way ANOVA FTreatment(2,255) � 2.85, p � 0.059,
both factors fixed; Fig. 5B). Subsequently, a single probe trial 24 h
after the last day of reversal training was performed (Fig. 5C,D).
At 30 dpi, both control and H1N1-infected mice spent signifi-
cantly more time in the new target quadrant (T) in comparison
with the average time spent in nontarget quadrants (control: un-
paired t test p � 0.0001, df � 30 and H1N1: unpaired t test p �
0.0001, df � 38), whereas H3N2-infected (unpaired t test p �
0.062, df � 26) and H7N7-infected (unpaired t test p � 0.79, df �
30) animals showed no preference for the new target quadrant
(Fig. 5C). No differences between tested groups were detected at
120 dpi (control: unpaired t test p � 0.004, df � 26, H3N2:
unpaired t test p � 0.0001, df � 26, H7N7: unpaired t test p �
0.048, df � 30; Fig. 5D).
IAV infection leads to long-term alterations in the function
and morphology of hippocampal neurons
Given the observed impairment in cognitive function after H3N2
and H7N7 influenza infection, we were interested in determining
whether hippocampal network function would be compromised
on a long-term timescale by the IAV infection. For this purpose,
we analyzed synaptic plasticity at the Schaffer collateral pathway
connecting the CA3 with the CA1 subfield, one of the most ex-
tensively studied synapses in the CNS (Fig. 6). First, the depen-
dence of the fEPSP slope on stimulation intensity was assessed
from input–output curves. Similar input–output relations of CA1
neurons in hippocampal slices from control and IAV-infected
mice were found for both time points after infection (two-way
ANOVA F30dpi(2,27) � 2.53, p � 0.09, and F120dpi(2,27) � 0.40, p �

 short-term synaptic potentiation of CA1
neurons were investigated at 30 and 120
dpi (Fig. 6B). IAV infection did not alter
PPF because fEPSP2/fEPSP1 in hip-
pocampal slices at 30 and 120 dpi were
not significantly different between con-
trol
and
infected
animals
(two-way
ANOVA F30dpi(2,30) � 0.06, p � 0.93, and
F120dpi(2,28) � 1.48, p � 0.24, both factors
fixed, number of brain slices in each
group � 9–11; Fig. 6B). These results in-
dicate that basal synaptic transmission at
individual synapses and short-term syn-
aptic plasticity in the CA1 region were not
affected by IAV infection.
In addition, long-term synaptic plas-
ticity was investigated. LTP at the Schaffer
collateral CA3 to CA1 pathway was in-
duced by TBS after 20 min of baseline
recording (Fig. 6C–F). At 30 dpi, the in-
duction phase of LTP (T 0–5 min after
TBS) was significantly reduced only in
hippocampal slices derived from H7N7-
infected mice (one-way ANOVA F(2,42) �
3.92, p � 0.02, number of brain slices in
each group � 13–17). However, the stable
phase of LTP (T 55–60 min after TBS) was
significantly decreased in both slices from
H3N2- and H7N7-infected mice, thereby
revealing a significant impairment in synaptic
plasticity compared with control hippocam-
pal slices (one-way ANOVA F(2,42) � 5.74,
p � 0.006; Fig. 6C,D). At 120 dpi, the in-
duction (one-way ANOVA F(2,35) � 0.30,
p � 0.74, number of brain slices in each
group � 11–15) and maintenance phase
of LTP in both H3N2 and H7N7 were
comparable to control slices (one-way
ANOVAF(2,35)�0.84,p�0.43;Fig.6E,F).
As a next step to investigate the poten-
tial cellular basis underlying the reduction
in LTP and memory impairment, hip-
pocampal neuronal morphology was ana-
lyzed at 30, 60, and 120 dpi (Fig. 7). Spines
are tiny, dendritic protrusions that carry
the majority of excitatory synapses in the
hippocampus and changes in spine den-
sity can provide information about alter-
ations in the connectivity of hippocampal
subregions. Spines were therefore counted
separately on apical dendrites of CA1 and
CA3 pyramidal neurons and on dentate
granule cells located in the superior and
inferior blade of the granule cell layer in
the hippocampus (Fig. 7A). A significant
reduction in dendritic spine density was
found in H3N2-infected (CA1: �17.08%,
CA3: �19.24%) and H7N7-infected (CA1:
�22.13%, CA3: �15.02%) mice 30 dpi,
whereas H1N1 infection had no sig-
nificant effect compared with control
(CA1: �2.28%, CA3: �3.46%) (one-way
ANOVA FCA1(3,186) � 18.97, p � 0.0001,

Analysis of learning strategies reveals a spatial learning impairment for both neurotropic and non-neurotropic
virus subtypes. With regard to the different searching strategies to locate the hidden platform during the acquisition phase
of the Morris water maze experiment, hippocampus-independent searching strategies including random swimming,
chaining, and scanning decreased over time, whereas the hippocampus-dependent strategy-directed search increased.
The searching strategies (directed search, chaining, scanning, and random swimming) were color coded and the relative
contributionoftherespectivestrategyispresentedforeachdayoftheMorriswatermazetask.A,Hippocampus-dependent
strategy was decreased after H7N7 infection compared with the other groups and H3N2-infected mice showed a reduction
in the usage of direct search at 30 dpi. B, No significant differences in searching strategies between IAV-infected and
control mice were observed at 120 dpi. Data are presented as mean � SEM (n � 7–10), two-way ANOVA of data and post
hoc Bonferroni’s multiple-comparisons test were performed. *p � 0.05 and **p � 0.01 compared with control; �p �

 and FCA3(3,196) � 16.40, p � 0.0001; Fig. 7A–C). The extent of the
phenotype differed between the hippocampal subregions as
both in the superior and inferior DG; only infection with H7N7
IAV led to a significant reduction in dendritic spine density (DG-
superior: �17.08%, DG-inferior: �21.95%) (one-way ANOVA
FDG-superior(3,186) � 18.15, p � 0.0001, and FDG-inferior(3,184) �
33.65, p � 0.0001; Fig. 7D,E). Further assessment of H3N2- and
H7N7-infected animals showeda partial recovery of the reduced
spine density at 60 dpi predominantly for the DG and CA3 sub-
regions and more pronounced for H3N2-infected animals (CA1:
H3N2, �10.59%; H7N7, �15.16%; CA3: H3N2, �7.12%; H7N7,
�15.66%; DG-superior: H7N7, �3.78%; DG-inferior: H7N7,
�4.88%; Fig. 7B–E). At 120 dpi, spine density in H7N7- and
H3N2-infected mice was indistinguishable from control animals
in all subregions of the hippocampus (p � 0.0001 vs 30 dpi; Fig.
7B–E).
IAV infection enhances glial cell density and activation status
within the hippocampus
Because processes of prolonged neuroinflammation after IAV
infection might be the underlying cause for the alterations ob-
served in this study ranging from single synapses to neuronal
plasticity and eventually affecting mouse behavior, the effects of
IAV on microglia density and activation status in the hippocam-
pus were analyzed. For this purpose, IBA-1 staining was performed
(Fig. 8A–C). IBA-1-positive cells were counted and analyzed sep-
arately in the CA1, CA3, and DG superior and inferior blade of
the granule cell layer in the hippocampus. Whereas microglia
density was not affected 30 dpi with H1N1 (CA1: �4.55%, CA3:
�7.67%), microglia density in the CA3 region (�30.25%) and
inferior blade of the DG (�27.40%) was increased after H3N2
infection (Fig. 8B). The neurotropic H7N7 IAV infection in-
duced a robust increase in microglia density for all hippocampal

Infection with neurotropic and non-neurotropic virus subtypes impairs memory formation for a new platform position. A, During 3 d of training, the escape latency to a new position
of the hidden platform (SW) decreased significantly in control, H1N1-infected, and H7N7-infected mice over days, however, not in H3N2-infected mice. H7N7-infected mice had a significantly
elevated escape latency compared with control and H1N1-infected mice. B, At 120 dpi, the IAV-infected group did not show any significant differences in the escape latency compared with the
control. A single probe trial test 24 h after the last day of reversal training was performed. C, Only control and H1N1-infected mice spent significantly more time in the new target quadrant (T) in
comparison with the average time spent in nontarget quadrants (NT). D, All tested groups spent more time in T compared with NT at 120 dpi. Data are presented as mean � SEM (n � 7–10).

49.18%, DG-inferior: 55.96%) (one-way ANOVA FCA1(3,76) � 5.13,
p � 0.002, FCA3(3,76) � 9.90, p � 0.0001, FDG-superior(3,76) � 17.57,
p � 0.0001, and FDG-inferior(3,76) � 22.16, p � 0.0001; Fig. 8B).
To determine the activation status of microglia cells in in-
fected individuals compared with control animals, the number of
primary processes per cell was quantified (Fig. 8C). For both the
H3N2 and H7N7 virus types, the number of primary processes
per cell decreased in all subregions of the hippocampus 30 dpi
(one-way ANOVA FCA1(3,636) � 178.90, p � 0.0001, FCA3(3,701) �
259.00, p � 0.0001, FDG-superior(3,706) � 155.5, p � 0.0001, and
FDG-inferior(3,641) � 203.20, p � 0.0001; Fig. 8C), indicating in-
creased activation levels. The strongest reduction was found in
the superior and inferior blade of the DG upon H7N7 infec-
tion (p � 0.001 vs control and H3N2-infected mice). A partial
recovery of microglia density (CA3: H3N2, �4.80% and
H7N7, �12.32%; DG-superior: H7N7, �18.14%; DG-inferior:
H3N2, �10.30%; H7N7, �24.27%; Fig. 8B) and activation
status occurred in the DG and CA3 subregions at 60 dpi,
especially in H3N2-infected animals (Fig. 8C). At 120 dpi,
microglia cell density and activation status in infected mice
were comparable to control levels (p � 0.001 vs 30 dpi; Fig.
8B,C).
In addition to the effect of IAV infection on microglia, we
investigated the density of astrocytes in hippocampal subregions
using GFAP staining (Fig. 8D,E). Astrocyte density in all subre-
gions of the hippocampus was increased 30 d after infection with
H7N7 (CA1: �44.87%, CA3: �45.78%, DG-superior: �14.90%,
DG-inferior: �22.60%), whereas only the CA1 (�29.47%) and
CA3 (�29.29%) subregion were affected in H3N2-infected ani-
mals (Fig. 8E). As was the case for spine density and microglia,
H1N1 did not affect astrocyte number in the hippocampus (CA1:
�2.73%, CA3: ��7.42%) (one-way ANOVA FCA1(3,36) � 16.07,
p � 0.0001, FCA3(3,36) � 14.10, p � 0.0001; FDG-superior(3,35) �

was the case for microglia, on the level of astrocytes, a partial and
a full recovery comparable to control numbers could be found at
60 dpi (H7N7: CA1, �8.19%; CA3, ��7.45%; DG-superior,
��7.42%; DG-inferior, ��1.80%) and 120 dpi, respectively
(p � 0.05 vs 30 dpi; Fig. 8E).
IAV infection increases BBB
permeability and cytokine level
As a next step, we examined the integrity
of the BBB after H3N2 and H7N7 infec-
tion (Fig. 9). For this purpose, animals
were injected with 2% (w/v) Evans blue
intraperitoneally at 4, 8, and 10 dpi. The
results of spectrophotometry showed that,
upon infection with H3N2 and H7N7 IAV,
an increased Evans blue absorbance and
therefore a compromised BBB could be
detected on 8 dpi with H3N2 and H7N7
(one-way ANOVA F(2,19) � 8.67, p �
0.002, Fig. 9A). At 10 dpi, only H7N7-
infected mice showed an Evans blue stain-
ing visible already macroscopically in the
brain, whereas in the CNS of H3N2-
infected mice, it was only weakly visible
around the ventricles (Fig. 9B).
We were furthermore interested whe-
ther the cytokine level would be increased
as well in the periphery and especially also
in the CNS. Therefore, TNF-� and IFN-�
levels were assessed in the periphery and
the CNS via ELISA at 8 dpi (Fig. 9C–H).
An earlier study suggested that IFNs and
TNF-� have a significant role in priming
immune cells for higher cytokine and
chemokine production during IAV infec-
tion (Veckman et al., 2006). Cytokine lev-
els were quantified in the blood serum,
CNS in general, and hippocampus of
IAV-infected mice. Our data revealed that
the levels of IFN-� and TNF-� were sig-
nificantly elevated in the all three areas in
H7N7-infected mice (Fig. 9C–H). Inter-
estingly, infection with the two non-
neurotropic influenza virus subtypes also
led to significantly increased levels of
TNF-� in the hippocampus of infected
mice compared with control (IFN-�: one-
way ANOVA FSerum(3,10) � 22.37, p �
0.0001, FBrain(3,24) � 14.96, p � 0.0001,

FHippocampus(3,22)�9.67,p�0.0003;Fig.9H).
IAV infection affects gene expression
differentially in the hippocampus
We performed whole genome expression
analysis at 18 and 30 dpi to study changes
in gene expression in the hippocampus
after IAV infection. Because we did not
detect long-term alterations in brain mor-
phology, function, or cognitive behavior
after H1N1 infection, we performed these
studies only in H3N2- and H7N7-infected mice. Furthermore,
we focused our analysis on the hippocampus, where we described
functional and morphological alterations (see above). Mock-
infected mice (PBS), killed at the same days after treatment, were
used as controls. We identified 487 differentially expressed probe
sets (DEPs) in the hippocampus of animals at 18 dpi with H3N2

 virus compared with mock-treated animals. However, no DEPs
were found at 30 d after H3N2 infection. After infection with H7N7,
174 DEPs were observed at 18 dpi and also 250 DEPs at 30 dpi
compared with mock controls (Fig. 10A). Most of the H3N2-
induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 342) did not overlap
with H7N7-induced DEGs, indicating a virus-specific response in
the hippocampus (Fig. 10B).
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
analysis of DEGs revealed a significant induction of immune
responses and inflammatory processes at 18 d after H7N7 IAV
infection, which continued until 30 dpi, and at 18 d after H3N2
IAV infection (Fig. 10C). In particular, genes involved in antigen
processing and presentation were found to be among the most
strongly upregulated genes after H3N2 and H7N7 IAV infection,
indicating activation of an immune response in the CNS. Fur-
thermore, KEGG analysis of DEGs in both H3N2- and H7N7-
infected mice compared with mock-infected controls (Fig. 10C)
revealed DEGs belonging to cell adhesion molecule (CAM) path-
ways that play a critical role in a wide array of biological processes
including hemostasis, the immune response, inflammation, and
development of neuronal tissue (Joseph-Silverstein and Silver-
stein, 1998). Moreover, cell–cell adhesions are important for syn-
aptic function (Bailey et al., 2015).
Our analysis also revealed a significant adverse regulation of
microglia-related genes after IAV infection. For instance, an in-
creased expression of microglia signature genes such as Olfml3
(H3N2: t � 3.60, p � 0.04 and H7N7: t � 5.42, p � 0.03) and
Tmem119 (H3N2: t � 2.49, p � 0.1 and H7N7: t � 3.44, p � 0.09)
and downregulation of the microglia-neuron crosstalk gene
(Cx3cr1) (H3N2: t � �4.39, p � 0.02 and H7N7: t � �2.04, p �
0.1) were observed after both H3N2 and H7N7 IAV infection
(Fig. 10D). Furthermore, the analysis of genes reflecting micro-
glia activation and in particular the major histocompatibility
class 2 family (MHCII) family (antigen processing and presenta-
tion), microglial-mediated phagocytosis (Fcgr4, Dap12 and Ctsz)
(Fcgr4: t � 4.68, p � 0.05, Dap12: 4.54, p � 0.05 and Ctsz: t �
4.73, p � 0.04), and complement system genes (C1qa, C1qb,
C1qc, and Vwf) (C1qa: t � 6.31, p � 0.03, C1qb: 5.16, p � 0.04,
C1qc: t � 3.28, p � 0.1, and Vwf: t � 4.27, p � 0.06), revealed a
significant upregulation especially in the group of H7N7-infected
animals (Fig. 10D). In addition to microglia, an increased expres-
sion of astrocyte signature and activation genes such as Gfap
(H3N2: t � 2.94, p � 0.08, and H7N7: t � 3.16, p � 0.1) and
Psmb8 (H3N2: t � 3.65, p � 0.04, and H7N7: t � 4.44, p � 0.05)
(Table 1) was observed in the hippocampus of H3N2- and H7N7-
infected mice.
Rbfox3 (NeuN) (H3N2: t � �4.07, p � 0.03 and H7N7: t �
�3.94, p � 0.07), Nrcam (neuronal cell adhesion molecule)
(H3N2: t � �5.99, p � 0.01 and H7N7: t � �4.98, p � 0.04), and
Cacna1c (voltage-dependent calcium channel) (H3N2: t � �3.75,
p � 0.04 and H7N7: t � �6.61, p � 0.03) were diminished
similarly in the H3N2- and H7N7-infected groups at 18 dpi (Ta-
ble 1). Dysfunction of these genes has been identified in several
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as au-
tism, schizophrenia, and cognitive impairments (Demyanenko et
al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016). In addition, Rbfox3
knock-out mice show deficits in synaptic transmission and plas-
ticity in the DG (Wang et al., 2015). Moreover, downregulation
of the neurotrophic factors Bdnf (H3N2: t � �3.52, p � 0.05 and
H7N7: t � �3.66, p � 0.08) and Ntf3 (H3N2: t � �6.88, p �
0.009 and H7N7: t � �3.91, p � 0.07) and a number of impor-
tant solute carriers such as Slc4a7 (bicarbonate cotransporter,
H3N2: t � �4.87, p � 0.02, and H7N7: t � �5.03, p � 0.04),
Slc30a5 (zinc transporter, H3N2: t � �4.78, p � 0.02, and H7N7:
t � �3.56, p � 0.09), Slc2a1 (glucose transporter, GLUT-1,
H3N2: t � �3.27, p � 0.06 and H7N7: t � �3.69, p � 0.08) and
Slc1a2 (glutamate transporter, H3N2: t � �4.70, p � 0.02 and
H7N7: t � �3.43, p � 0.05), and synapse-associated protein
genes including Grm5 (glutamate receptor, H3N2: t � �3.87,
p � 0.03, and H7N7: t � �2.49, p � 0.1) and Dlg3 (SAP102,
H3N2: t � �4.79, p � 0.02, and H7N7: t � �3.67, p � 0.08) were
observed regardless of the virus subtype (Table 1). It is known
that SAP102-null mice exhibit impaired spatial learning along
with defects in synaptic plasticity (Cuthbert et al., 2007). It is also
worth noting that after both H3N2 and H7N7 IAV infection,
upregulation of interferon-response related genes including
Psmb9 (H3N2: t � 3.04, p � 0.08 and H7N7: t � 4.62, p � 0.05),
Lgals3bp (H3N2: t � 3.67, p � 0.04 and H7N7: t � 4.51, p �
0.05), Oas2 (H3N2: t � 6.24, p � 0.01 and H7N7: t � 5.28, p �
0.04), and especially Ccl5 (H3N2: t � 4.46, p � 0.02 and H7N7:
t � 3.93, p � 0.07) were observed; the latter has been associated
previously with cognitive decline (Laurent et al., 2017) (Table 1).
Discussion
Influenza is primarily considered as a respiratory disease. How-
ever, evidence accumulates that an infection with IAV may also
be associated with neurological complications in humans (Surana et
al., 2011; Ekstrand, 2012; Shah et al., 2014). Because influenza
viruses can be either neurotropic or non-neurotropic, it is impor-
tant to discriminate between alterations mediated directly by the
fact that the virus is actually able to replicate in the brain and,
conversely, CNS complications as a result of the host immune
response in the periphery. Here, we investigated the long-term
neurological impact of an infection with either neurotropic or
non-neurotropic IAV subtypes. The long-lasting consequences
of an influenza infection on the brain have not been studied
before. Our findings provide evidence that neuroinflammation
caused by non-neurotropic and neurotropic influenza viruses
induces long-lasting impairments in hippocampal neuronal
morphology and synaptic properties and cognitive function in
adult animals.
A comparison of the two non-neurotropic viruses, H1N1 and
H3N2, revealed that infection with H1N1 did not lead to any
long-term alterations in spatial memory formation and neuron
morphology. In a previous study, H1N1-infected mice showed
impairment in the reversal task in the Morris water maze, sug-
gesting influenza-induced cognitive deficits during the acute

 phase of the infection (Jurgens et al., 2012). Although our results
showed that recovery from the infection with this variant seems
to be fast, the infection with the non-neurotropic H3N2 subtype
and neurotropic H7N7 caused long-lasting cognitive deficits in
infected animals. We therefore concentrated on a detailed com-
parison between infection with H3N2, which is not able to
replicate in the brain, and H7N7, in which we indeed could de-
tect replicating virus in the CNS.

Hosseini et al. • Long-Term Neuroinflammation Induced by IAV Infection
 Infection with both virus subtypes led to a compromised BBB
8 dpi. This is consistent with an elevation of cytokine levels in the
CNS detected here. Although the concentration of IFN-� and
TNF-� was highest in the case of H7N7 infection both in the
serum and in the CNS, infection with H3N2 also led to signifi-
cantly elevated levels of TNF-� in the hippocampus. Indeed, sev-
eral studies indicate that, after different types of infection in the
periphery or the brain, an increased inflammatory gene expres-
sion (e.g., IL-1�, IL-6, TNF-�, and IFN-�) can be observed across
multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus (Howe et al.,
2012; Elmore et al., 2014; Heneka et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2017).
The cytokines generated during peripheral inflammation can
activate a secondary, mirror inflammatory response (indirect,
immune response-mediated pathways) in the brain that is char-
acterized by activation of microglia and production of proinflam-
matory cytokines, most importantly, TNF-�, IL-1, and IL-6
(Riazi et al., 2015). Indeed, we were able to detect an increase in
the number of microglia in the hippocampus of H3N2- and
H7N7-infected mice that could at least in part be attributable to
the leaky BBB after influenza infection. Although activated
microglia are crucial for the host defense against pathogens, pro-
longed or aberrant activation can have damaging effects on neu-
rons and can adversely affect synaptic transmission and structure
(Hanisch, 2002; Block et al., 2007; Pickering and O’Connor,
2007; Riazi et al., 2015). It was shown previously that microglia
can also play a role in synaptic remodeling and plasticity in the
healthy brain (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Parkhurst et al., 2013),
for example, via neuron–microglia crosstalk through the Cx3cr1
signaling axis, which we found to be downregulated indepen-
dently of the virus subtype. The observed long-term alterations in
spine number, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function after
IAV infection might therefore indeed result in part from a general
virus-subtype-independent hyperactivation of microglia cells in
the hippocampus triggered through the immune response to the
influenza virus in the periphery. It was shown previously that
proinflammatory mediators produced during the infection af-
fected neuronal morphology, synaptic structure, and function
(Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011; Estes and McAllister, 2015). In par-
ticular, chronic inflammation in vivo and exposure of cultured
brain cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro led to a loss of spines
reminiscenttochangesfoundinmanyneurologicaldiseases(Chang
et al., 2015). Furthermore, manipulation of individual cytokines can
modulate learning, memory formation, and synaptic plasticity
(MarinandKipnis,2013;DonzisandTronson,2014).Theincreased
production of inflammatory mediators from brain immune cells
might indeed disrupt the delicate balance in the neuro–microglia
crosstalk (Tanaka et al., 2006; Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011).
The number of astrocytes was increased as well after infection
withneurotropicandnon-neurotropicIAVsubtypes.Wedetecteda
downregulation in the levels of the astrocyte-specific glutamate
transporter Slc1a2, which plays an essential role in the mainte-
nance of normal excitatory synaptic transmission, protection of
neurons from the excitotoxicity of excessive glutamate, and reg-
ulation of glutamate-mediated neuroplasticity (David et al.,
2009). Interestingly, in both H3N2- and H7N7-infected mice,
elevated numbers of astrocytes recovered faster than the number
and activation status of microglia cells, suggesting that an astro-
cyte–microglial interaction might be a key mechanism for the
regulation of brain inflammation during influenza infection. Pre-
vious findings suggest that astrocytes can regulate microglial ac-
tivity by stimulating their antioxidant gene expression, perhaps
providing a negative feedback response to titrate the inflamma-
tory reaction induced by proinflammatory mechanisms, thus
modulating microglial resting status versus activation state (Shih
et al., 2006).
In addition to the striking similarity of the phenotypes on the
generallevelofglialcellandsynapsenumberandthegeneexpression
profiles after infection with non-neurotropic and neurotropic IAV
subtypes pointing toward immune response-mediated indirect
pathways,wewereabletorevealalsocharacteristicdifferencesinthe
long-lasting outcome after infection with these two viruses. In-
fection with the neurotropic virus led to synapse loss in all three
hippocampal subregions together with a robust impairment in
spatial map formation, whereas H3N2 infection was associated
with synapse loss only in the cornu ammonis region and a re-
duced ability to update the new platform position in the reversal
phase, but almost normal learning in the initial water maze task.
It was indeed shown previously that the progressive nature of
neurotropic virus-induced damage in the dentate gyrus (DG),
such as during Borna virus infection, is associated with impaired
performance in the Morris water maze (Rubin et al., 1999).
Moreover, there is evidence that the plain water maze task can be
solved efficiently despite LTP impairments in either the CA1 or
the CA3 region (Nakazawa et al., 2002; Bannerman et al., 2012).
Our data therefore show that hippocampal subregions might in-
deed exhibit a different sensitivity to inflammation-induced
damage, with the DG being more resilient. Moreover, our results
indicate that the neuronal representation of behavioral flexibility
to decide between competing memories in the reversal task may
reside more in the CA1 and CA3 subfield than in the DG.
In case of the neurotropic virus H7N7, we observed a much
stronger reaction that was consistent throughout all hippocam-
pal subregions, including the DG. It is interesting that the
interferon-responsive gene Ifit3, which is reported to be involved
in cognitive decline in aged mice (Bordner et al., 2011), was spe-
cifically upregulated in the hippocampus of H7N7-infected mice
and is mainly expressed in granule cells (Cho et al., 2013). This
indicates that the direct presence of the virus in the brain leads to
even more detrimental effects (direct, virus-mediated pathways).
The gene expression profile analysis revealed that the increase in
microglia activation markers was even stronger in H7N7-infected
individuals compared with H3N2-infected mice. In particular,
the levels of genes belonging to the MHC II were strongly in-
creased, indicating direct contact of microglia and the IAV.
Evidence now accumulates that chronic neuroinflammation
may be a central mechanism contributing to the generation and
progression of a number of neuropsychiatric and neurodegen-
erative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (Frank-Cannon
et al., 2009; Heneka et al., 2014). Interestingly, the dopamine
neurotransmitter transporter gene Slc6a3, which has been asso-
ciated with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders
(Sinanan and Hillary, 1981; Uddin et al., 2011), was among the
most strongly upregulated genes especially after H7N7 infection.
Therefore, our findings have significant implications for the
clinical consequences of IAV infections. An influenza infection
withneurotropicviruses,butalsoinfectionswithanon-neurotropic
virus, can initiate inflammatory cascades via microglia and astro-
cyte activation in the brain and therefore increase the likelihood
to develop neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
The host immune response triggered by a lung infection with
H3N2 was able to impair hippocampal function. More strikingly,
replication of an influenza virus in the brain resulted in a stronger
and more prolonged activation of microglia with detrimental
outcome for cognitive functions. In our study, we only worked
with younger animals. It will thus be important to study whether
similar or even more pronounced impairments would be ob-

 served in aged mice and if the developing brains in newborn and
juvenile individuals could also be affected. Approaches to regu-
late glial cell activity may provide a future strategy to prevent
deleterious long-term effects on the brain, especially in highly
vulnerable patient groups.
