Abstract
Background: Smartphone manufacturers offer mobile health monitoring technology to their customers, including apps
using the built-in camera for heart rate assessment. This study aimed to test the diagnostic accuracy of such heart rate
measuring apps in clinical practice.
Methods: The feasibility and accuracy of measuring heart rate was tested on four commercially available apps using both
iPhone 4 and iPhone 5. ‘Instant Heart Rate’ (IHR) and ‘Heart Fitness’ (HF) work with contact photoplethysmography
(contact of fingertip to built-in camera), while ‘Whats My Heart Rate’ (WMH) and ‘Cardiio Version’ (CAR) work with
non-contact photoplethysmography. The measurements were compared to electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry-
derived heart rate.
Results: Heart rate measurement using app-based photoplethysmography was performed on 108 randomly selected
patients. The electrocardiogram-derived heart rate correlated well with pulse oximetry (r ¼ 0.92), IHR (r ¼ 0.83) and HF
(r ¼ 0.96), but somewhat less with WMH (r ¼ 0.62) and CAR (r ¼ 0.60). The accuracy of app-measured heart rate as
compared to electrocardiogram, reported as mean absolute error (in bpm � standard error) was 2 � 0.35 (pulse oxim-
etry), 4.5 � 1.1 (IHR), 2 � 0.5 (HF), 7.1 � 1.4 (WMH) and 8.1 � 1.4 (CAR).
Conclusions: We found substantial performance differences between the four studied heart rate measuring apps. The
two contact photoplethysmography-based apps had higher feasibility and better accuracy for heart rate measurement
than the two non-contact photoplethysmography-based apps.

Introduction
Mobile electronic devices such as smartphones or tablets
are gaining increasing popularity worldwide. Recent
estimates suggest 7.7 billion mobile broadband subscrip-
tions in 2020, while the number of smartphone subscrip-
tions is expected to equal about 70% of the world’s
population.1
The
ubiquitous
use
of
smartphones
coupled with expanding mobile broadband connectivity
could change the way healthcare is accessed, monitored
and delivered (‘mobile health technologies’, mHealth).
mHealth is defined by the practice of medicine sup-
ported by portable diagnostic devices.2 For healthcare
systems, the importance of mHealth strategies has been
demonstrated as they may play an important role in the
control of epidemic disease such as cholera3 or Ebola.4
On an individual patient level, mHealth technology can
be
used,
for
example,
to

 adherence5,6 or control of blood glucose levels and insu-
lin doses in patients with diabetes.7 For cardiac patients,
a wide array of smartphone-connected cardiac monitor-
ing devices and health apps for the diagnosis and pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease is available.8
Overall, it is estimated that the number of health-
related wearable sensors will reach 80 million in
2017.9
To
reach
the
transformative
potential
of
mHealth, validation of the technical capabilities and
accuracy as well as the clinical impact of these technol-
ogies is needed.10 As heart rate monitoring is an essen-
tial component of almost all clinical situations, in the
present study we evaluated the usability and accuracy
of four different heart rate measuring apps. The accur-
acy of the apps was compared to the electrocardiogram
(ECG) and pulse oximeter-derived heart rate using
medically approved professional devices.
Methods
Basic principles
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is based on the principle
that blood absorbs more light than the surrounding
tissue. In addition, variations in blood volume (i.e. in
systole and diastole) affect the transmission or reflect-
ance of light.11 These two principles can be used to
detect blood flow. The PPG technique is commercially
used in pulse oximeters for the determination of arterial
blood oxygen saturation (SaO2), achieved by comput-
ing the differences of light absorption in the red and
infrared
range
by
oxygenated
and
deoxygenated
haemoglobin.12 In contrast, heart rate detection (but
not SaO2 measurement) based on PPG is feasible
using only light in the visible range.11
Two different concepts of measuring heart rate by
PPG are known: contact and non-contact PPG. In
contact PPG, the subject places a finger on the built-
in camera of the phone. The camera is placed directly
on the skin and the built-in flash provides the necessary
light source in the visible range for reflection by blood
cells (Figure 1(a)). In non-contact PPG, the camera is
used in the classic way by holding the camera in front of
the patient’s face (up to 1.5 m away) without the need
for direct skin contact (Figure 1(b)). There is no need
for a dedicated light source, ambient light is sufficient.
Technology
Applications (apps). Overall, four commercially available
apps have been tested (downloaded from iTunes store).
For contact PPG, we used ‘Instant Heart Rate’ (IHR)
(version 3.0.1; Azumio Inc., USA) and ‘Heart Fitness’
(HF) (version 2.0.3; Senscare SAS, France). For non-
contact PPG, we tested ‘Whats My Heart Rate’
(WMH) (version 2.0; Vitrox Technologies, Malaysia)
and ‘Cardiio’ (CAR) (version 2.0; Cardiio Inc., USA).
Mobile devices. We tested the four different apps on two
different portable phones (iPhone 4, iPhone 5). The
exact camera specifications of the phones are shown
in Table 1. The primary camera was used for the con-
tact PPG-based measurements, while the secondary
camera was used for all non-contact measurements.
Study population
From April to December 2013 we randomly included
adult patients requiring heart rate monitoring on the
chest
pain
unit
or
the
emergency
room
of
the
University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. All patients
willing to participate in the study were eligible; how-
ever, patients in critical medical conditions were
excluded from this study. Patients participating in this

camera of the phone directly on the skin and the built in flash provides the necessary light source in the visible range for reflection by

without the need for direct skin contact (Figure 1b). (a) Contact photoplethysmography; (b) non-contact photoplethysmography.

 study gave written informed consent. The study was
approved by the ethics committee of the Canton of
Zurich, Switzerland (KEK-ZH-NR: 2012-0524).
After recruitment, initial heart rate and rhythm was
measured using a 12-lead ECG (Schiller AT-104 PC/SDS
101 and Schiller AT 102 Plus; Schiller AG, Baar,
Switzerland). Heart rate was then measured simultan-
eously by pulse oximetry (Draeger Infinity Delta XL;
Draegerwerk AG & Co. KG, Luebeck, Germany), an
ECG-based monitor (Philips Intellivue X2; Koninklijke
Philips NV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and by each
app. The patient history was taken from medical records,
and additional clinical characteristics were collected
(age, body temperature, blood pressure and blood
oxygen saturation). The graphic conceived by Jubran13
was used for grading of the pulse oximetry curve quality.
Statistics
Continuous data are expressed as medians and inter-
quartile ranges (IQRs) or as mean � standard deviation
(SD) as appropriate, and categorical data as number and
percentage (%). Categorical data were analysed using
the chi-square test. To compare the values provided by
the four apps to the ECG and oximeter-derived heart
rate we used Pearson’s correlation and Bland–Altman
analysis. To assess the level of agreement between meth-
ods we computed the mean absolute error.14 Linear and
multiple regression analyses were performed to test the
influence of the defined factors on the mean absolute
error of the four different apps. A P value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata SE, version 13.
Results
Clinical characteristics
We included a total of 108 patients. In total, 432
datasets
(each
consisting
of
an
app-based
measurement, a simultaneous ECG-based measure-
ment and simultaneous pulseoxymetry-based measure-
ment for each patient) were obtained. Nineteen datasets
were excluded due to missing values (due to either the
app-based measurement or ECG being unable to give a
value). Median patient age was 65 years (range 19–99
years, IQR 52–76 years); 31% of patients were women.
During
the
measurements,
median
systolic
blood
pressure was 126 mmHg (range 76–189 mmHg, IQR
112–142 mmHg),
body
temperature
ranged
from
35.0�C to 37.5�C (median 36.0�C). Median arterial
oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was
96% (range 62–100%, IQR 94–98%). Sinus rhythm
was present in 85 patients (79%), atrial fibrillation in
11 patients (10%), ventricular pacemaker stimulation
in five patients (5%) and atrial tachycardia/third-
degree AV-block/junctional escape rhythm each in
one patient (1%). The baseline characteristics of the
study population are given in Table 2. In a total of
413 measurements by ECG we recorded a wide heart
rate range from 31 to 124 bpm (median 75 bpm,
IQR
62–90
bpm).
The
quality
of
the
oximetry
pulse curve was judged to be satisfactory in 86%

ECG measurements compared to pulse oximetry
measurements with approved medical devices
ECG-based measurements compared to heart rate
measurement using the pulse oximetry device showed
a very high level of agreement (Figure 2, Table 3).
Pearson correlation r between the ECG determined
heart rate and the oximetric heart rate was 0.92
(P < 0.001),
showing
a
mean
absolute
error
of
2 � 0.35 bpm.
ECG measurements compared to app-based
measurements
The accuracy of heart rate measured by apps as com-
pared to ECG, reported as mean absolute error
(in
bpm � standard
error)
was
4.5 � 1.1
(IHR),
2.0 � 0.5
(HF),
7.1 � 1.4
(WMH)
and
8.1 � 1.4
(CAR). The ECG-derived heart rate correlated well
with
IHR
(r ¼ 0.83)
and
HF
(r ¼ 0.96),
but
less
with
WMH
(r ¼ 0.62)
and
CAR
(r ¼ 0.60)
(see
Table 3). The Bland–Altman plots (Figure 3) show
considerable
differences
between
the
tested
apps.
Non-contact PPG measurements performed signifi-
cantly worse compared to fingertip-based (contact)
measurements.
Both
non-contact
PPG-based
apps
performed significantly worse at higher heart rates.
They also have a tendency to underestimate higher
heart rates.
Influencing factors in app-based measurements
Using multiple regression analyses, we were unable to
demonstrate any relationship between influencing fac-
tors and mean absolute error for the contact PPG apps
IHR and HF (Table 4). However, the two non-contact
PPG apps performed worse, with declining body tem-
perature
and
increasing
heart
rate.
Furthermore,
camera technology tended to influence the performance
of the non-contact PPG apps.
Discussion
The widespread use of smartphones, expanding mobile
broadband connectivity and the emergence of new
mHealth technologies will result in an increase of collec-
tion (and transmission) of individualised health-related
data. The potential to increase patient engagement, to
reduce healthcare costs and to improve outcomes is

 remarkable. Nevertheless, establishing reliable and clin-
ically meaningful digital health data is problematic: in
the present study, the performance of different apps for
heart rate measurements by smartphone (without any
external connectable sensor device) was very heteroge-
neous. While one app (HF) measured heart rate with
comparable accuracy to pulse oximetry, other apps did
not perform as well. In some apps, absolute differences
of over 20 bpm (or even more) occurred in more than
20% of all measurements (see Table 5). The precise
reason for WMH and CAR performing slightly worse
is unclear. Theoretically they should be performing simi-
larly. We could not reliably identify an influencing
factor. The two non-contact PPG apps performed sig-
nificantly worse compared to fingertip-based (contact
PPG) apps. This may be to due to inferior camera tech-
nology (in both apps the front camera with less
advanced specifications was used) as well as generally
a
more
demanding
measurement
environment.
Uncontrolled ambient light may make it more difficult
to discriminate between two distinct peaks in the pulse
wave. Furthermore, the accuracy of non-contact PPG
apps was significantly worse at higher heart rates,
which is in line with previously published data.15,16 In
a different more recent study comparing the accuracy of
wrist-worn heart rate monitors using contact PPG tech-
nology, no such effect was observed.16 One possible
explanation for the worse accuracy of non-contact
PPG could be the inferior resolution of the secondary
camera. The trend to more reliable performance in next
generation devices (iPhone5 vs. iPhone4) observed in the
present study could prognosticate better performance in
the future using more advanced camera technology.
While some apps are developed using evidence-based
guidelines and are continuously evaluated,17 most
remain unevaluated. The sheer number of unregulated
apps can lead to consumer confusion, reluctant promo-

 consumption of healthcare resources. It is largely unclear
how we should develop the resources necessary for
administrating digital health services and the require-
ment for healthcare personnel to monitor the wave of
incoming patient-generated data. Besides these logistic
aspects, several other issues are problematic and need to
be addressed (medico-legal liability, personal data
safety, health insurance collaborations, reimbursement,
incorporation in governmental healthcare systems/pro-
grammes, etc.).
Nevertheless, mHealth technologies potentially offer
amazing opportunities for patients, healthcare pro-
viders, researchers and healthcare delivery systems.
To identify the most effective and robust technologies
for clinical use it is mandatory to create an evidence
base
that
validates
generated
measurements
and
assesses the impact of specific mHealth products and
concepts on healthcare quality, cost and outcomes.
Conclusion
We found substantial performance differences between
the four studied heart rate measuring apps. The two
contact PPG-based apps had higher feasibility and
better accuracy for heart rate measurement than the
two non-contact PPG-based apps. Careful analysis of
app accuracy is warranted before using these apps in
clinical practice.
