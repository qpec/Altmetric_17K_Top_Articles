Abstract
Poor coordination of care across providers and birth settings has been associated with adverse
maternal-newborn outcomes. Research suggests that integration of midwives into regional
health systems is a key determinant of optimal maternal-newborn outcomes, yet, to date, the
characteristics of an integrated system have not been described, nor linked to health disparities.
Methods
Our multidisciplinary team examined published regulatory data to inform a 50-state data-
base describing the environment for midwifery practice and interprofessional collaboration.
Items (110) detailed differences across jurisdictions in scope of practice, autonomy, gover-
nance, and prescriptive authority; as well as restrictions that can affect patient safety, qual-
ity, and access to maternity providers across birth settings. A nationwide survey of state
regulatory experts (n = 92) verified the ‘on the ground’ relevance, importance, and realities
of local interpretation of these state laws. Using a modified Delphi process, we selected 50/
110 key items to include in a weighted, composite Midwifery Integration Scoring (MISS) sys-
tem. Higher scores indicate greater integration of midwives across all settings. We ranked
states by MISS scores; and, using reliable indicators in the CDC-Vital Statistics Database,
we calculated correlation coefficients between MISS scores and maternal-newborn out-
comes by state, as well as state density of midwives and place of birth. We conducted hier-
archical linear regression analysis to control for confounding effects of race.
Results
MISS scores ranged from lowest at 17 (North Carolina) to highest at 61 (Washington), out of
100 points. Higher MISS scores were associated with significantly higher rates of spontaneous

lated with density of midwives and access to care across birth settings. Significant differences
in newborn outcomes accounted for by MISS scores persisted after controlling for proportion of
African American births in each state.
Conclusion
The MISS scoring system assesses the level of integration of midwives and evaluates
regional access to high quality maternity care. In the United States, higher MISS Scores
were associated with significantly higher rates of physiologic birth, less obstetric interven-
tions, and fewer adverse neonatal outcomes.
Introduction
The Lancet Series on Midwifery (2014) concluded that “national investment in midwives and in
their work environment, education, regulation, and management . . . is crucial to the achieve-
ment of national and international goals and targets in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and
child health” [1]. In countries where midwives are integrated into the health care system, the
benefits of midwifery care are well-documented [2]. Global health experts recommend scaling
up midwifery to improve maternal and newborn outcomes, reduce rates of unnecessary inter-
ventions, and realize cost savings [3,4]. However, access to midwifery care in the United States
(US) is markedly lower than in most other “Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development” (OECD) countries, with approximately 10% of US births attended by midwives
compared to 50–75% in other high-resource countries [5]. In addition to low density of mid-
wives per state, all midwives are not universally licensed to practice or integrated into regional
health care systems. American midwives face multiple challenges to practice, including numer-
ous regulatory barriers and inability to secure third party reimbursement [6]. As a result,
women in many states cannot access midwives because of legal or payor restrictions [7,8].
Regulation has been identified by the International Confederation of Midwives as one of the
pillars of a strong midwifery profession [9]. Regulation refers to a set of criteria and processes aris-
ing from the legislation that describes the scope of midwifery practice (activities which midwives
are educated for, competent in, and authorized to perform, consistent with the ICM Definition of
the Midwife) [9]. On a global scale, maternal and perinatal outcomes are better in jurisdictions
where midwives are regulated and have the legislative authority to practice to their full scope
across birth settings, including collaborating with or referring to other health professionals [2]. To
date, it has been difficult to examine the impact of variations in midwifery regulation and integra-
tion across the United States on perinatal outcomes or on consumer access to maternity care. To
address these gaps, a panel of maternity care and health policy experts who were delegates to the
Home Birth Summit III [HBS] in 2014 (http://www.homebirthsummit.org/) designed The Access
and Integration Maternity Care Mapping (AIMM) Study. The aim of this transdisciplinary,
national research project was to examine the impact of state regulatory environments on access to
midwives and association with perinatal outcomes across populations in the United States.
Why does integration matter?
There are very few jurisdictions in the United States (US) where all types of midwives, irrespec-
tive of practice site, are fully integrated as regulated health professionals into interprofessional

 care provider networks. However, interprofessional teamwork is essential to the provision of
high-quality maternity care [10]. For example, research indicates that, when professionals col-
laborate on decision-making and when coordination of care is seamless, fewer intrapartum neo-
natal and maternal deaths occur during critical obstetric events [11]. Poor communication,
disagreement, and lack of clarity around provider roles are identified as primary determinants
of these adverse outcomes [10–12]. Beliefs about risk, beneficence, non-maleficence and patient
autonomy are often discipline-specific and divergent [13,14]. Rates of intervention, and labour
management options that facilitate normal, physiologic birth are known to differ by type of pro-
vider [15], by birth setting [16,17], and by provider education. When differences around defin-
ing risk and responsibility exist among providers, interprofessional cooperation and access to
options for care are reduced [18–20]. Moreover, when patients perceive interprofessional con-
flict, the culture of safety is diminished [21–23].
Conversely, collaboration among health professionals can improve safety and quality, par-
ticularly when care is transferred from low to high resource settings [10]. For example, when a
woman plans to give birth in a community setting (home or birth center) she benefits when
her midwife can facilitate access to specialized hospital personnel, equipment, or medications
when necessary. The ability of midwives to function autonomously to their full scope of prac-
tice in community settings, in collaboration with other members of the health system, can
enhance cost-effectiveness of maternity care [24,25]. Regardless of birth setting, midwife-led
care has been linked to significantly improved perinatal outcomes, and maternal experience,
in both healthy and at-risk populations [26–28]. In the US, current evidence suggests that
scope of practice laws, as well as other aspects of state policy and regulation, may be reducing
the maternity care workforce and access to services [26]. An integrated maternity care system
facilitates the full exercise of scope of practice, autonomy, self-regulation, and collaboration
across disciplines.
The diverse context for American midwifery practice
Over 15 years ago, the American Public Health Association issued a position statement, calling
for increased access and integration of midwifery services in the United States. [29](29) Yet,
consistent U.S. standards for regulation, scope of practice, and access to reimbursement for
midwives are still lacking, resulting in a fragmented system of care.
There are three professional designations for midwives in the United States: Certified
Nurse-Midwife (CNM), Certified Midwife (CM) and Certified Professional Midwife (CPM).
CNMs/CMs obtain their basic education in midwifery through university-based nursing pro-
grams and obtain a master’s degree. Both CMs and CPMs are direct-entry midwives without a
prior nursing credential. CPMs have a median of three years of education before attending
deliveries as a primary midwife; half gain certification via portfolio review, 40% graduate from
an accredited school and others report blended education pathways [7]. CNMs can obtain
licensure in all 50 states and DC, and their scope includes well-woman gynecology and pri-
mary care, as well as maternity care. They are prepared for practice in any birth setting, but
they almost exclusively practice in hospitals [6,30]. CMs are currently licensed in 5 states, and
are prepared for an identical scope of practice and settings for care as CNMs. CPMs can cur-
rently obtain licensure in 30 states. They provide antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum/
newborn care in community based settings, but typically cannot obtain hospital practice privi-
leges and often have difficulty establishing reliable systems for referral and collaborative care.
[7,31]
Wide variations in state regulatory conditions for midwifery practice, especially with
respect to birth place, have created an environment of interprofessional hostility in some

 jurisdictions and interprofessional cooperation in others. Given the emerging evidence on the
adverse impact of interprofessional disarticulation on maternal experience and outcomes
[31,32], it is important to understand the connections between different regulatory environ-
ments and differences in health outcomes, especially when significant disparities exist across
populations. Differences in adverse perinatal outcomes between Caucasian women and
women of colors are well-documented [33–36], and persist even when controlling for socio-
economic status and access to quality prenatal care [33,37]. There is a dearth of information
about whether health disparities can be attributed to differences in health insurance coverage,
or access to providers, or quality of care [36,38,39].
In 2015, 89.8% of US births were attended by physicians, 8.5% by CNMs/CMs, 0.8% by
other midwives (including CPMs), and 0.8% by other providers [40]. In 2014, methods of pay-
ment varied by place of birth: 44.2% of hospital births were paid for by Medicaid, 48.0% by pri-
vate insurance, 3.4% were self-pay, and 4.4% via other sources. In contrast, 16.4% of
community births (birth center or home) were paid for by Medicaid, 29.4% by private insur-
ance, 50.0% through self-pay and 4.2% via other sources. Most community births are attended
by midwives and half are not covered by insurance [41]. The regulatory environment for pay-
ors has been shown to significantly impact the extent of midwifery practice in a state and
autonomy of midwives [42].
Such systems-level deficits may have significant, negative impacts on the health and well-
being of maternal-newborn populations. Rates of obstetric interventions are on the rise in the
United States and adverse maternal and newborn outcomes are high, compared to other
OECD countries [43]. Black Americans experience substantially higher rates of maternal and
neonatal mortality, preterm birth, and low birth weight [33,34,44]. However, one study found
that in states where CNMs have greater professional autonomy (i.e. physician supervision not
required), there were lower rates of surgical birth, preterm birth and low birth weight, even
when adjusted for maternal age, parity, race, education, marital status, cigarette use and prena-
tal care utilization [26].
In the Access and Integration Maternity Care Mapping (AIMM) Study, we went beyond
CNM autonomy to create an evidence-based scoring system to rank the level of integration of
all types of midwives into health systems. We then examined the relationships between state
Midwifery Integration Scores, density of midwives, access to midwives across practice settings,
rates of obstetric interventions, and maternal and newborn outcomes.
Methods
We convened a multi-disciplinary Task Force with expertise in maternity services research,
public health, midwifery, obstetrics, epidemiology, consumer advocacy, and/or roles in mid-
wifery regulation, legislation, and law. They identified the key variables needed to populate a
database of published regulatory data across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, detail-
ing rules regarding scope of practice, and requirements for licensure of CNMs, CPMs, and
CMs and practice across birth settings. We then employed a formal, process (see Table 1),
modeled on the Delphi method [45,46], best practices for transdisciplinary research, and legal
epidemiology [47], to identify and validate the most important items for inclusion in a com-
posite measure of midwifery integration.
Round 1 –Concept generation
The Task Force self-organized into two teams, one with regulatory, law, and consumer access
expertise, and another with expertise in public health, legal anthropology, and perinatal epide-
miology research methods, including instrument development. Both teams included

 clinicians, and consumers. Over three rounds of drafts, edits, and consensus-based discus-
sions, Team 1 identified seven relevant domains that were important to identify in state regula-
tions on midwifery. Four domains describe midwifery practice: scope of practice, provider
autonomy, governance, access to referral and medications; and three domains describe patient
safety, quality, and access to maternity providers across birth setting. The team identified 110
indicators that differentiate the regulatory environment by domain for each type of midwife
(CM, CPM, or CNM), and assigned numeric values to describe the diverse conditions, permis-
sions, or restrictions delineated in the state laws (see Table 2).
We then widened the consultant pool to include experts from national regulatory, legal,
payor, professional and perinatal surveillance bodies. These policy leaders noted that the statu-
tory language does not always accurately represent the realities of how rules and laws are inter-
preted and implemented. Language used in rule-making may be interpreted in more or less
restrictive ways, and some rules are not actionable given infrastructure constraints and sys-
tems-level limitations. For example, in one state, CPMs have statutory authority to access
emergency medications for the management of complications, such as maternal hemorrhage;
however, pharmacists in that state are restricted from furnishing these medications to
Table 1. Development of an evidence-based Midwifery Integration Scoring System (MISS).
Delphi Round 1 –Concept generation
• HBS Regulation and Licensure Task Force (Team 1) reviews source documents and identifies 7 domains of
midwifery integration
• Database populated with state regulations on scope of practice and restrictions
• Team 1 agrees by consensus on 110 key items describing midwifery regulation
Delphi Round 2 –Expert content validation
• HBS Research and Data Task Force (Team 2) defines optimal regulatory conditions that support patient access
and collaborative practice–informed by a review of the evidence, and consultation with Team 1
• Database and rubrics translated into format to allow for a ranked composite scoring and comparison across
states
• State regulatory content experts (N = 92, 1-2/state) review items and scoring rubrics for accuracy and relevance
to local implementation of the law
• Team 2 harmonizes data and adapts scoring rubrics to reflect state realities
• Final scoring system reviewed and confirmed by consensus among Teams 1 and 2, and national midwifery
regulators and clinical leaders
Delphi Round 3 –Development and application of composite measure
• Team 2 selects 50 key indicators of midwifery integration indicating level of autonomy, ability to practice to full
scope, and collaboration across birth settings.
• Teams 1 and 2 convene to rank order answer options in each of the 50 items (higher scores indicated more
favourable access and practice conditions)
• Team 1 develops a weighted scoring system based on patient safety and quality. Item level scores are weighted
and summed for a total optimal score of 100.
• MISS tool generates State Integration Scores (range = 17 to 61 across the US).
• Density of midwives (per 1000 state births) and access to midwives across settings (home, birth center, hospital)
correlated to MISS scores and outcomes.
• Correlation and regression analyses link state MISS scores to selected perinatal outcomes that are reliably
reported by CDC Vital Statistics
Delphi Round 4 –Development of the AIMM report card
• Teams 1 and 2 meet to reach consensus on interpretation and key messages
• Creation of Interactive AIMM Maps:
� MISS scores categorized into four quartiles (very low, low, moderate, high)1
� Perinatal outcomes linked to MISS scores and displayed by highest and lowest quartiles
� 4 base maps to display: level of integration, density, proportion of midwife-attended births in 3 settings, and
proportion of black births by state
1: We categorized MISS scores and outcomes into four equal categories: Values between the 1-24th percentile, the
25th-49th percentile, the 50th to 74th percentile and the 75th to 100th percentile.

 practitioners who are not affiliated with hospitals. Because CPMs cannot gain access to hospi-
tal privileges, they must find alternate ways to exercise their authority to carry these lifesaving
medications.
Round 2 –Expert content validation
Hence, to verify the realities of implementation of the law within each state, Team 2 identified
and recruited state and national regulatory experts (n = 92) to complete an online survey. Par-
ticipants included 75 state-specific regulatory board representatives; the presidents, regional
and chapter chairs for state midwifery associations, state legislative and policy chairs for the
American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM) and National Association of Certified Profes-
sional Midwives (NACPM). They evaluated the connections and discordances between theory
and practice for each of the identified indicators within the state regulatory environment. In
poorly integrated states our national experts (ACNM, NACPM legislative directors) referred
us to local midwifery or consumer experts who could reliably speak to ‘on the ground’ condi-
tions. When two state experts disagreed on an indicator or experts did not know the answer,
we further consulted with 17 state or national regulators, to resolve discrepancies.
We harmonized expert responses with our regulatory database through a systematic line-
by-line comparison. We validated and/or deferred to the statutory language when there were
no discrepancies between statutes and local interpretation or implementation. When state
experts provided evidence of local interpretation that differed from the apparent intent of laws
or rules, we added or adapted response options to reflect the realities of midwifery practice,
consumer access, and/or the interprofessional environment.

 Round 3—Development and application of composite measure
A final Delphi process (see Table 1), involving both multidisciplinary teams, led to selection of
50/110 indicators of midwifery integration, and the development of a weighted Midwifery Inte-
gration Scoring System (MISS) (50 items, maximum summary score 100) that quantifies the
potential impact on patient access to high-quality maternity care across birth settings. Both teams
reviewed the 110 items and only retained those that were deemed, by consensus, important or
very important to the assessment of midwifery integration. In some cases, 2–3 items were com-
bined into one stem query, and response options expanded. Some items were excluded because
team members felt that the items were not directly pertinent to midwifery integration. For exam-
ple, one item (Does informed consent language in statute and/or regulations allow for informed
refusal by client?) was excluded because the item relates more to human rights issue rather than
quantifying the level of midwifery integration. To create the weighting system, using a scale of 0
(not important), 1 (somewhat important), 2 (important), 3 (very important), 4 (essential), the
teams assessed each item for its potential impact on patient access to high-quality maternity care.
They assigned higher item-level scores to indicators of greater integration, more interprofessional
collaboration, and/or wider consumer access across birth settings. The final list of items describe
the range of possible options for scope of practice, regulatory body, prescriptive authority, require-
ments for physician supervision, access to Medicaid, etc. that vary in both statutory language and
implementation across states. See S1 Table for a full list of the indicators and scoring system.
Ranking states by MISS scores and outcomes
We used the MISS composite summary scores to rank states by degree of integration. Then,
using the 2014 CDC-Vital Statistics Database, we calculated Spearman’s rho correlation coeffi-
cients between the continuous MISS integration scores and selected maternal-newborn out-
comes in each state. We used Spearman’s rho because the MISS scores were normally
distributed as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk Test (0.960, p = 0.08), but the outcomes data were
not. We selected indicators that represent cost-effectiveness and quality in perinatal care (e.g.
rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, exclusive breastfeeding, cesarean, induction, VBAC, pre-
term birth, low birth weight, neonatal mortality) [43,48], and were available and reliable in the
CDCs Vital Statistics database [47]. Finally, based on data from the Area Health Resource File,
and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we calculated correlations between MISS
scores; state density of midwives (per 1000 births); and consumer access to midwives across
birth settings, defined as the proportion of all births at 1) hospital, 2) home and 3) birth centers
for two categories of midwives a) CNMs/CMs and b) CPMs and other direct entry midwives
as reported on the birth certificates for each state.
In addition, we calculated the correlations between 1) CM and 2) CPM licensure and peri-
natal outcomes, to examine the differential effects of licensure versus integration scores by
state for all outcomes. We also identified states with the highest increases in community births
(at home and birth centers) over the past 8 years and examined correlations with MISS scores.
Finally, appreciating the complex nature of health disparities, to understand the relative
importance of midwifery integration on perinatal outcomes, we conducted hierarchical linear
regression modelling, to control for the proportion of Non-Hispanic Black births in each state,
when examining the relationship of MISS scores with rates of five outcomes: caesarean, pre-
term birth, neonatal death, low birth weight, and breastfeeding at birth.
Results
State MISS scores ranged from 17 in North Carolina to 61 in Washington State, with notable
regional variation (see Figs 1 and 2). Higher MISS integration scores were correlated to a

 higher density of midwives per state and higher proportion of midwife-attended births across
settings (see Table 3). Higher MISS scores, and improved access to midwives in all settings,
were associated with significantly higher rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery, vaginal birth
after cesarean (VBAC), and breastfeeding at birth and at six months; and significantly lower
rates of cesarean section (CS), preterm (PTB), and low birth weight (LBW) infants (see
Table 4). Higher MISS scores were correlated strongly with lower rates of neonatal mortality
(see S1 Fig) and race-specific neonatal mortality (see S2 Table).
Between 2004 and 2014, community birth rates increased significantly (p< 0.05) in all
states, except Vermont, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Maine and DC. The average increase over
the time period was 72%. [41] The states with the largest increases were Montana, Oregon,
Washington, Utah and Wyoming. States with higher MISS scores had significantly higher
rates of community births in 2014 (rs = 0.445, p = 0.01) and significantly larger increases in
community birth rates from 2004–2014 (rs = 0.328, p = 0.02).
Our regulatory data described conditions for 2014–2015, when CPMs had regulatory
authority to practice in 27 states and CMs in 5 states. CPM licensure significantly correlated to
access to midwifery care in community settings (rs = 0.440, p = 0.001). Licensure alone was not
synonymous with integration, and did not confer the same benefits on outcomes or interven-
tions (see S4 Table).
MISS scores were significantly lower in states with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic
Black births (rs = - 0.370; p = 0.007). Access to midwives across settings and density of mid-
wives were also significantly lower in states with a higher proportion of black births (rs = -
0.375, p = 0.007 and rs = - 0.298, p = 0.04). To determine the amount of variance that is
accounted for by integration of midwives, when taking into account disparities in neonatal
mortality by race, we undertook further analysis. Differences in the percent of Non-Hispanic
black birth across states accounted for 38.5% of the differences in neonatal mortality scores,
and MISS scores explained another 11.6% of variance (see Table 5). This change was signifi-
cant (p = 0.002) meaning that the level of integration can explain differences in neonatal

 mortality rates, above and beyond the percent of black births. These two factors, state-level
percent of black births and level of midwifery integration, can predict half of the variance
(50.1%) in neonatal mortality rates. MISS scores also explained significant additional variance
in rates of preterm birth and breastfeeding at birth scores (see Table 5). Integration scores did
not add significant explanatory power to disparities in cesarean and low birth weight rates.

 Discussion
Our analyses showed that a state regulatory environment that supported greater integration of
midwives into the health system was associated with a greater number of midwives and

Regression specifications: Hierarchical linear regression. The proportion of black births was entered in block 1 of the model and integration scores in the second block;
outcomes were: Neonatal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, CS and breastfeeding at birth. For each model we found that the relationship between standardized
predicted values and standardized residuals was linear and that the observed standardized residuals were normally distributed. A p value < 0.05 was deemed as
significant.

 midwife-attended births in a state. This greater integration was significantly associated with
higher rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, VBAC and breastfeeding at birth and at six months,
as well as lower rates of obstetric interventions, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, and
neonatal death. These findings are especially significant in the light of increased costs to any
health care system associated with high cesarean and preterm birth rates, and low breastfeed-
ing rates. This is a pathognomonic example of the current global public health focus on, “too
much too soon, too little too late” [48].
While the associations illustrated do not imply causation, the MISS scores nonetheless can
be a tool for generating testable hypotheses on the effects of midwifery integration on key out-
comes. The observed relationships may help us identify states where childbearing women are
at increased risk for poor outcomes and experience reduced access to high quality maternity
care due to poor integration of midwives across birth sites (e.g. North Carolina, Alabama).
Model states (i.e. states with the highest MISS scores) can inform mechanisms to enhance
integration of midwives in other states. However, it is important to note that no state enjoys
regulatory conditions that are optimal to support quality and safety for families during preg-
nancy, birth and the postpartum period. The most integrated states now achieve scores that
represent less than two thirds (61/100) of condition requirements for a fully integrated system
for care.
Can integration of midwives reduce health disparities?
African American mothers, in particular, are affected by adverse maternal and newborn out-
comes; they experience a two to four times higher risk than White women for both maternal
and infant mortality [44,49]. Some policy makers and public health experts attribute this to
concomitant disparities among African Americans in wages, housing, and safe environments.
Other researchers have proposed that outcomes such as LBW are due, in part or wholly, to
experiences of discrimination across the life span of African-American mothers [50,51]. Gis-
combe and Lobel [52] hypothesized that racism functions as a severe stress trigger, and have
explored biologic explanations for how stress influences adverse neonatal outcomes.
Nonetheless, Rossen et al. [53] describe considerable variation in county-level and race-spe-
cific infant mortality rates between black and white mothers. They suggest that this variation
might be partly a result of contributing factors that are common to both white and black
infants, including differential access to specialized care, perinatal regionalization, and overall
patterns in health care delivery. Since data suggest that institutional racism is a contributing
factor, place of birth, or model of maternity care, may also modulate these outcomes [41]. A
recent population-level analysis in Canada described associations between midwifery care of
at-risk populations and significantly reduced incidence of pre-term birth, low birth weight,
and other adverse outcomes [54]. In our study, lower MISS scores were associated with signifi-
cantly higher rates of neonatal mortality among Hispanic, black and white babies when exam-
ining race-specific outcomes. Density of midwives and access to midwives across birth settings
were also significantly lower in states where more black babies are born. The additional vari-
ance explained when MISS scores were added to the equations suggests that, with greater inte-
gration of midwives in these states, the associated reduced rates of neonatal mortality, preterm
birth, and increased breastfeeding success could confer important long term health benefits
[55,56] for African American mothers.
Does midwifery integration affect outcomes across birth settings?
Some investigators have suggested that poor neonatal outcomes may rise with increased access
to midwives who attend home and birth center births [57,58]. In our state-by-state

 comparison, however, the best outcomes for mothers and babies occur in states where all types
of midwives are regulated and integrated into the health care system regardless of birth setting.
Nonetheless, significant interprofessional conflict persists around recommendations for safe
birth care. For example, despite the emergence of high quality prospective observational studies
supporting the safety and cost-effectiveness of planned home birth [16,24], leading maternity
providers in North America have been in conflict about birth at home and birth centers, debat-
ing issues related to safety, access, the value of obstetric intervention, and patient autonomy
[57–59].These debates are reflected in widely varying state regulatory environments that may,
in turn, influence conditions for maternity practice and public access to choice of birth place.
Differences in community birth rates across regions may simply represent the influence of pre-
existing provider philosophies and attitudes [60], which in turn affect informed consent discus-
sions with patients as well as comfort with collaboration across disciplines [20].
Rates of planned home and birth center birth in the US and Canada remained at less than
1% for several decades, but current data suggest that American women are increasing their
interest in this option [41]. Midwives are the only maternity care providers who currently offer
choice of birth setting. However, because not all types of American midwives can legally prac-
tice in all birth settings, choice of birth place is functionally quite limited for a majority of US
women. In some regions, women who plan to deliver at home or in a birth center, will (along
with their midwives) encounter hostility, judgment, and, reprimand when they transfer across
birth settings [31,61]. Person-centred maternity care should define quality and safety within a
multi-faceted context that includes patient choice, access, experience, and cost-effectiveness.
Policy implications: Improving access to high quality maternity care
Our ranking system highlights discrepancies in integration and related outcomes and could
inspire political will, and guide legislative reform. The Midwifery Integration Scoring System
can help to identify states where childbearing women and newborns might benefit from
improved integration of midwives. In communities where access to any maternity provider is
scarce [62], our findings suggest that expanding access to midwifery care may be an important
part of the solution to both public health and human health resource challenges. All three
types of midwives share a model of maternity care that has been associated with optimal out-
comes and cost-effectiveness [1,63]by prioritizing person-centered care; promoting of normal,
physiologic birth; judicious evidence-based use of obstetric interventions and procedures; and
collaborating with and/or referring to obstetric specialists when indicated [7,64]. Our results
align with this evidence suggesting that increased reliance on midwives could reduce the costly
overuse of obstetric interventions, reduce rates of preterm birth and neonatal loss, and
improve breastfeeding and vaginal birth rates, thereby helping to address serious maternal-
newborn health deficits in the United States.
The US precedent of health systems restricting access to qualified attendants across birth
settings, and placing high value on institutional birth, has been very influential in low and mid-
dle resource countries. [65,66]Unfortunately, the system of incentivizing institutional birth
and physician management of healthy pregnancies has exacerbated the gaps between demand
and available health human resources both in the US and in low resource settings. [66,67]
Skilled midwives can assist a woman to assess her birth site options according to her health sta-
tus and facilitate access to appropriate resources. Ideally, they would practice in a legal envi-
ronment that allows them to practice to full scope, and collaborate seamlessly with other
health professionals, across birth settings.
To enable midwives to work autonomously within their full scope of practice, the Interna-
tional Confederation of Midwives has identified standards for regulatory mechanisms that

 protect the public by ensuring that midwives provide high quality midwifery care to every
woman and baby [68]. Based on these ICM Standards, the US Midwifery Education, Regula-
tion and Association (USMERA) workgroup has described Principles for Model Midwifery
Legislation [69]that include many of the same components that comprise the MISS scores. If
applied to state regulatory reform, they could contribute to state scores that are closer to the
ideal (i.e. 100).
A recent Lancet analysis of maternal health policy revealed that countries with a sustained
20-year decrease in maternal mortality had increased country-wide access to health care
through targeted investment in midwifery services. [4] In countries like India, Mozambique,
Uganda, and Nepal skilled birth attendants are scarce in all settings and the consequences are
disastrous–“too little too late” [48]. In high resource countries that are experiencing the phe-
nomena of “too much, too soon”, expanding availability of midwives across health systems
also has important implications for quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness [43,48].
Limitations and opportunities
While this analysis represents a significant step forward, it has some limitations. We are using
aggregated state measures and hence potentially subject to the ecological fallacy of making
inferences concerning individual behavior, based on group data [70]. However, our goal is to
measure systems of care at the state level rather than the relationship between individual pro-
viders and specific neonatal outcomes. We cannot conclude that a more integrated system of
midwifery directly causes improved outcomes. It may simply reflect a state culture of better
interprofessional cooperation that affects patterns of practice. Variations in access to any
maternity care at the local level may have more impact on outcomes, and data derived from
Area Resource maps on provider availability may be more informative. Functional levels of
integration may vary by the interpretation of statutes by providers or referral institutions at
the local level.
Our analysis captured relationships as relevant to the regulatory environment in the US in
2014–2016. As regulatory and practice conditions change, MISS scores will also change, so ongo-
ing revisions of the source database will be necessary. Our team plans to partner with NACPM,
ACNM, and regulatory boards to tri-annually update the data-informed AIMM maps.
Our findings could inform site selection for a national prospective cohort study, such that
studies of midwifery outcomes can be restricted to states with high MISS scores or can control
for level of integration. Cohort studies that take into account the level of midwifery integration
could inform state regulatory language that supports increasing access to high quality care
across settings and jurisdictions.
Finally, the MISS scoring system is based on evidence-based metrics that are relevant to
midwifery regulation and practice globally. This composite scoring system could be adapted to
country-level realities where items describe the domains according to the available maternity
providers and regional conditions for practice, restrictions, and state of collaboration. It is
likely that other high resource countries would achieve scores that represent a more fully inte-
grated system, consistent with their reported improved outcomes.
The 2014 Lancet Series on Midwifery, in collaboration with the WHO, identified the top 11
research priorities needed to improve quality maternal and newborn care. [71] Global experts
recognized that it is critical to ask “different questions” if we are to understand which out-
comes are most important to track and which factors most contribute to those essential out-
comes. To fully understand the relationships between health systems, model of care, access to
care, and childbearing outcomes, more investigations on the impacts of the regulatory envi-
ronment at the local, regional, and country level is needed.

 The AIMM Report Card
To make our findings more accessible to policy makers and consumers, Team 2 worked closely
with a GIS specialist to create the AIMM “Report Card”, a visual representation of the data via
a series of color-coded, interactive maps. The maps illustrate the range of midwifery integra-
tion across the United States by quartiles, as well as density and access to midwives in different
settings. The AIMM Report Card displays how integration, access, and density of midwives
link to outcomes by distinguishing states that are in the highest and lowest quartiles for indica-
tors of optimal health according to global health agencies (e.g. WHO-recommended rates for
cesarean). For example (see Fig 3A & 3B), on each map, upon selection of outcomes, green
outlines appear for states that report the highest rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, vaginal
birth after cesarean (VBAC), and breastfeeding. Red outlines appear for states in the highest
quartile for rates of cesarean, induction, neonatal mortality, prematurity, and low birth weight
infants.

and lighter shades represent lower integration of midwives. Green outlines show where rates of neonatal mortality are
lowest and red outlines show where rates are highest. 3B: Percent of black births per state by quartiles. Deeper shades
of orange represent a higher proportion of black births and lighter shades represent a lower proportion of black births.
Green outlines show where rates of neonatal mortality are lowest and red outlines show where rates are highest.

 The maps also show race-specific outcomes by MISS scores, and display outcomes by the
proportion of Black women giving birth in each state. Fig 3A displays that, in most states
where black women give birth, they do not have access to midwives who are well integrated
into the system. These states also report the highest rates of neonatal mortality. New York
State is a notable exception, reporting a high density of black births, among the lowest rates of
neonatal mortality in the country, and a MISS score in the highest quartile.
Through the AIMM Report Card, the viewer can visualize how perinatal outcomes, inter-
ventions, and access to choice of birth place differ in states where midwives are well inte-
grated, compared to states where disarticulations exist. Similarly, pop-up bar and pie graphs
display state-level data for the proportion of women giving birth by settings, proportion of
births attended by midwives that are covered by Medicaid, and state level rates of perinatal
outcomes.
The data maps are available at http://birthplacelab.org/maps. State-specific report cards can
be viewed at http://www.birthplacelab.org/how-does-your-state-rank.
These tools may be valuable to advocates, policy makers and other key stakeholders who
seek to identify regions with reduced access to collaborative practice and options for maternity
care.
Conclusions
The Midwifery Integration Scoring System (MISS) is a powerful new tool to track the impact
of the regulatory environment on patient access to health care, as well as choice of provider
and birth place. The Access and Integration Maternity care (AIMM) Maps illustrate effective
health human resource allocation in maternity care, based on population-level health out-
comes data. Higher MISS Scores were associated with significantly more access to midwives,
significantly higher rates of physiologic birth outcomes, lower rates of obstetric interventions,
and fewer adverse neonatal outcomes. Race is associated with significant differences among
states in neonatal outcomes; and the level of integration of midwives accounts for additional
differences that persist after controlling for African American births. Our findings can inform
health policy to improve regional access to high quality maternity care across populations and
birth settings.
