Abstract
Objective To develop and externally validate risk prediction equations
to estimate absolute and conditional survival in patients with colorectal
cancer.
Design Cohort study.
Setting General practices in England providing data for the QResearch
database linked to the national cancer registry.
Participants 44 145 patients aged 15-99 with colorectal cancer from
947 practices to derive the equations. The equations were validated in
15 214 patients with colorectal cancer from 305 different QResearch
practices and 437 821 patients with colorectal cancer from the national
cancer registry.
Main outcome measures The primary outcome was all cause mortality
and secondary outcome was colorectal cancer mortality.
Methods Cause specific hazards models were used to predict risks of
colorectal cancer mortality and other cause mortality accounting for
competing risks, and these risk estimates were combined to obtain risks
of all cause mortality. Separate equations were derived for men and
women. Several variables were tested: age, ethnicity, deprivation score,
cancer stage, cancer grade, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index, family history
of bowel cancer, anaemia, liver function test result, comorbidities, use
of statins, use of aspirin, clinical values for anaemia, and platelet count.
Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in both
validation cohorts at 1, 5, and 10 years.
Results The final models included the following variables in men and
women: age, deprivation score, cancer stage, cancer grade, smoking
status, colorectal surgery, chemotherapy, family history of bowel cancer,
raised platelet count, abnormal liver function, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
prescribed aspirin at diagnosis, and prescribed statins at diagnosis.
Improved survival in women was associated with younger age, earlier
stage of cancer, well or moderately differentiated cancer grade, colorectal
cancer surgery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50), family history of bowel
cancer (0.62), and prescriptions for statins (0.77) and aspirin (0.83) at
diagnosis, with comparable results for men. The risk equations were
well calibrated, with predicted risks closely matching observed risks.
Discrimination was good in men and women in both validation cohorts.
For example, the five year survival equations on the QResearch
validation cohort explained 45.3% of the variation in time to colorectal
cancer death for women, the D statistic was 1.86, and Harrell’s C statistic
was 0.80 (both measures of discrimination, indicating that the scores
are able to distinguish between people with different levels of risk). The
corresponding results for all cause mortality were 42.6%, 1.77, and 0.79.
Conclusions Risk prediction equations were developed and validated
to estimate overall and conditional survival of patients with colorectal
cancer accounting for an individual’s clinical and demographic
characteristics. These equations can provide more individualised
accurate information for patients with colorectal cancer to inform decision
making and follow-up.
Introduction
Traditional estimates of cancer survival provide important
information for guidelines, planning treatment, follow-up, and
ongoing surveillance for different types of cancer. Relative
survival estimates are traditionally used to cancel out changes
in competing causes of death so that changes in prevention and
treatment strategies can be compared over time and between
populations.1 The relative net survival essentially removes the
competing cause of death, comparing survival in patients with
cancer with the expected survival in people without cancer.
Relative survival estimates are usually based on analyses of
cancer registry data alone and presented as a series of tables
taking account of one or two factors (eg, the patient’s age and
sex, or the stage of cancer at diagnosis).2 While such estimates
are useful for researchers and policy makers, they are less
relevant for patients and clinicians, who tend to be interested

 in individualised absolute survival to support treatment decisions
and make informed and meaningful choices.
Several prognostic models exist, which predict overall mortality
or survival for colorectal cancer.3-6 Although these models
incorporate additional clinical variables and show improved
performance compared with the Tumour Nodes Metastases
(TNM) system, they tend to be limited to specific patient groups
(such as those with stage 3 disease5 or those undergoing curative
intent surgery6), be based on selected populations of patients
recruited to clinical trials5 6 or attending specialist centres, and
have relatively poor discrimination5 6 or are not published.4 None
of these models can be applied to all patients with colorectal
cancer, incorporate family history or specific comorbidities,
predict survival over periods longer than five years, or update
predictions based on the number of years survived since
diagnosis.4-6
Realistic estimates of overall survival are particularly important
for patients with a diagnosis of cancer who need to make
decisions about the risks and benefits of active versus supportive
treatment (eg, whether to have surgery, chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, or palliative care).7 Current evidence suggests that
issues around survival are only discussed properly in
approximately 30% of cases.8 This may reflect a lack of robust
information on survival, which takes account of patient
characteristics and the likely effect of different treatments.9
Therefore, we decided to develop and externally validate a set
of prediction equations to quantify absolute survival for patients
with colorectal cancer. We accounted for other clinical factors
available through routine linkage of cancer registry data to
primary care electronic health records. We decided to include
estimates of conditional survival since this provides a more
relevant measure of survival among those surviving the first
year, especially when the initial prognosis is poor (ie, advanced
stage colorectal cancer).10 Such estimates can be used to provide
better information for patients and clinicians to help inform
treatment and other life decisions.1
Methods
Study design and data source
We undertook a cohort study to derive and validate the risk
equations in a large population of primary care patients with
colorectal cancer using the UK QResearch database (version
41, www.qresearch.org). A second external validation was
undertaken using a separate cohort of patients included on the
national cancer registry. QResearch is a continually updated
patient level pseudonymised database, with data extending back
to 1989. It includes data from over 1200 general practices
covering a population of more than 22 million patients, collected
during the course of routine healthcare. The data includes
demographic information, smoking status, alcohol consumption,
diagnoses, prescriptions, referrals, laboratory test results, and
clinical values. QResearch has been used for a wide range of
clinical research, such as the development and validation of risk
prediction models,11 including risk of existing but undiagnosed
cancer12 and future cancers.13
QResearch is linked at individual patient level to national cancer
registry data supplied by Public Health England (PHE) and the
mortality register supplied by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS).1 The mortality register includes information on the date
of death as well as the primary and underlying cause of death.
The PHE cancer registry currently includes all cancers registered
in England between 1990 and 2014, with follow-up for mortality
until 31 December 2015. The PHE cancer registry includes
information on year of birth, age at diagnosis, date of death,
sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation fifth, date of cancer
diagnosis, binary variables for cancer treatments such as surgery
and chemotherapy undertaken within a year of diagnosis, tumour
location, tumour growth behaviour, cancer grade, cancer stage,
and whether the cancer diagnosis was only present on a death
certificate. The PHE cancer registry, however, does not include
the cause of death or other variables such as smoking status,
alcohol consumption, body mass index, comorbidities, or
prescribed drugs.
Cohort selection
We included all QResearch practices using the Egton Medical
Information Systems (EMIS) for at least one year during the
study period. We randomly allocated three quarters of these
practices to the derivation dataset and the remaining quarter to
a validation dataset. In both datasets we identified open cohorts
of patients registered with eligible practices between 1 January
1998 and 31 December 2014.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included patients registered with QResearch with a first
recorded diagnosis of colorectal cancer on the linked cancer
registry data between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2014.
To identify cases of colorectal cancer we used ICD-10
(international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes
(C18, C19, and C20).14-16 The analysis was restricted to patients
aged 15 to 99 years at diagnosis who had a first diagnosis of
colorectal cancer during the period of registration with the
practice, ensuring that each patient was registered with the
practice for at least one year before cancer diagnosis. We used
the date of cancer diagnosis from the linked cancer registry data
as the index date for entry to the cohort, and patients were
followed up until the earliest of the date of death or 31 December
2015 to ensure a minimum of 12 months’ follow-up after
diagnosis.
We excluded patients where the growth behaviour for the index
cancer diagnosis was coded as benign and those where the
diagnosis was made on or after death, because the duration of
survival is unknown.14 15
External validation cohort
For the separate external validation cohort, we identified patients
aged 15 to 99 years with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer
recorded on the PHE cancer registry who were not registered
with QResearch practices at the time of diagnosis, excluding
those where the growth behaviour of their cancer was coded as
benign and those with a death certificate only diagnosis.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was all cause mortality. Our secondary
outcome was colorectal cancer mortality. We used the primary
and underlying causes of death on the linked ONS record to
identify deaths from colorectal cancer.
Predictor variables
Box 1 lists the predictor variables we examined, based on
established factors affecting mortality after a diagnosis of cancer
and those affecting all cause mortality. We did this so that the
absolute risk estimates will be able to reflect these factors.
For body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption,
we used the most recent value before cancer diagnosis. For
blood tests, we used the values recorded closest to the date of

diagnosis, selecting from those recorded within 12 months either
side of the diagnosis date. For comorbidities, family history,
use of statins, and use of aspirin we used values recorded before
diagnosis. We also included the Townsend deprivation score,
which is an area level score based on the patients’ postcode.23
Originally developed by Townsend,23 it includes unemployment
(as a percentage of those aged 16 or more who are economically
active), non-car ownership (as a percentage of all households),
non-home ownership (as a percentage of all households), and
household overcrowding. These variables are measured for a
given area of approximately 120 households, using the 2011
census, and combined to give a Townsend score for that area.
A greater Townsend score implies a greater level of deprivation.
Derivation of the predictive models
We developed the risk models using cause specific hazard
models to account for competing risks such as death from other
causes. Firstly, we used multiple imputation with chained
equations to replace missing values for continuous values (body
mass index) and categorical variables (smoking status, alcohol
consumption, cancer stage, and cancer grade).24-26 We carried
out five imputations and included all potential predictor variables
in each imputation model along with the outcome variables, the
Nelson-Aalen estimator of the baseline cumulative hazard,27
and the interaction terms.
Secondly, we fitted two separate cause specific Cox models:
one for deaths from colorectal cancer and one for deaths from
other causes. To allow for clustering of patients within general
practices, we used robust variance estimates. We used fractional
polynomial terms28 to model non-linear risk relations for age
and body mass index. We used Rubin’s rules to combine the
regression coefficients across the five imputed datasets.29
Variables were retained in the prediction models if they had a
hazard ratio of <0.85 or >1.15 (for binary variables) and were
statistically significant at the 0.01 level. We tested for two way
interactions between age and each predictor; cancer stage and
each predictor; and combinations of cancer grade, surgery, and
chemotherapy. We included significant interactions (where
P<0.01). A formula30 was used to derive the cumulative
incidence function for colorectal cancer mortality accounting
for competing risk of death from other causes using estimates
obtained from the two Cox models. This formula multiplies the
hazard contribution for colorectal cancer mortality at a given
time by the probability of death from other causes at that time
and then sums these values across the time period of interest.
We used the same method to derive the cumulative incidence
function for deaths from other causes, accounting for competing
risk of death from colorectal cancer. We added these two
cumulative incidence functions to give estimates of the risk of
death from all causes. We obtained values of these estimates at
1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis and hence derived estimates
of absolute survival probabilities at 1, 5, and 10 years after
diagnosis.
Conditional survival
Overall survival
We calculated overall survival estimates conditional on having
survived a given number of years after diagnosis (X) for patients
who had already survived Y years since diagnosis by dividing
the absolute survival at X years by the absolute overall survival
estimates at Y years.31

 Cause specific mortality
To calculate cause specific mortality estimates at a given number
of years after diagnosis (X) for patients who had already
survived Y years since diagnosis, we calculated the cumulative
risk at X years minus the cumulative risk at Y years and divided
this difference by the overall survival at Y years (ie,
((cumulative risk at X years)–(cumulative risk at Y
years))/overall survival at Y years). In this way it is possible to
calculate predictions for overall survival as well as cause specific
mortality conditional on survival for any number of years for
each year until 10 years.
Landmark analysis
Patients were recorded on the PHE cancer registry as having
received chemotherapy or colorectal surgery if this was
undertaken within a year of the date of diagnosis of cancer but
the precise date of treatment was unavailable. As a further
analysis we therefore undertook a landmark analysis32 to avoid
immortal time bias (which would tend to overestimate the
benefit of treatment)33 and compared hazard ratios for cancer
treatments with the main analysis. We assigned a landmark date
that was 365 days after cancer diagnosis. Deaths that occurred
between the diagnosis date and landmark date were excluded
from these analyses.
Validation of the predictive models
We used multiple imputation in the QResearch validation cohort
to replace missing values using the same imputation model as
in the derivation cohort. In the PHE validation cohort, we used
multiple imputation to replace missing values for cancer stage
and grade only. The risk equations were applied to both the
QResearch and the PHE validation cohort. We assumed zero
values for variables in the model that were not recorded on the
PHE dataset (these variables were family history of bowel
cancer, raised platelet count, abnormally raised liver function
test result, statin use, aspirin use, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, renal disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease). A value of 25 kg/m2 was assumed for body mass index.
We calculated R2 values (explained variation in time to death34),
D statistics35 (measure of discrimination, where higher values
indicate better discrimination), and Harrell’s C statistics over
1, 5, and 10 years. Harrell’s C statistic36 is a measure of
discrimination that is similar to the receiver operating
characteristic statistic but takes account of the censored nature
of the data. Using Rubin’s rules we combined these model
performance measures across imputed datasets. We assessed
calibration for all cause mortality by comparing the observed
risks at 1, 5, and 10 years with the mean predicted risks by 10th
of predicted risk using Kaplan-Meier estimates of observed risk.
Calibration of the colorectal mortality estimates was assessed
by comparing non-parametric estimates of cumulative incidence,
which approximate observed risk accounting for competing risk
of death from other causes,37 with the mean predicted risks across
10ths of predicted risk. A model is well calibrated if predicted
risks closely approximate the observed risks.
Survival rates
In each of the three cohorts we calculated the age standardised
observed survival and the relative net survival for patients from
the date of diagnosis for comparisons with other studies.14 38
Relative survival is the ratio of the overall survival for a cohort
of patients with cancer to the expected survival in the general
population matched by age, sex, and calendar year. We used
background rates obtained from ONS. We also calculated
survival estimates for patients, conditional on the patient
surviving for each year after diagnosis.14 39
Decision curve analysis
We used decision curve analysis in the QResearch validation
cohort (accounting for competing risks) to evaluate the net
benefits of the new risk equations for deaths from colorectal
cancer and from other causes.40-42 This approach assesses the
benefits of correctly detecting people who will have an event
compared with the harms from a false positive classification
(which could lead to unnecessary treatment). The net benefit of
a risk equation at a given risk threshold is calculated by
calculating the difference between the proportion of true
positives and the proportion of false positives multiplied by the
odds of the risk threshold. We calculated the net benefits across
a range of threshold probabilities and compared these with
alternative strategies such as not treating anyone or treating
everyone. In general, the strategy with the highest net benefit
at any given risk threshold is considered to have the most clinical
value.
To maximise power and generalisability we included all the
eligible patients in each database. All analyses were done using
STATA (version 14.1). We adhered to the transparent reporting
of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or
diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement for reporting.43 Further details
can be found in the study protocol.44
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in setting the research question. A
patient representative reviewed the study protocol and advised
on the design and outcome measures and the lay summary.
Patient representatives from the QResearch advisory board have
written the information for patients on the QResearch website
about the use of the database for research in general. They have
also advised on dissemination, including the use of lay
summaries describing the research and its results.
Results
Overall study population
Overall, 1252 practices in England participating in QResearch
met our practice inclusion criteria, of which 947 were randomly
assigned to the derivation dataset with the remaining 305
practices assigned to the validation cohort. Overall we identified
525 416 patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer on the
Public Health England (PHE) cancer registry between 1998 and
2014. We excluded 475 patients who were aged less than 15
years or more than 99 years, two patients where the behaviour
of the tumour was benign, and 18 248 patients where the
diagnosis was made on or after death. Of the remaining 497 180
patients, 44 145 were registered with QResearch practices in
the derivation cohort and 15 214 were in the QResearch
validation cohort, leaving 437 821 patients for inclusion in the
PHE validation cohort.
Baseline characteristics
Table 1⇓ shows the baseline characteristics of men and women
with colorectal cancer for each cohort using data from the cancer
registry. Table 2⇓ shows additional data available from the
general practice record. For the 44 145 patients in the derivation
cohort, the mean age at diagnosis was 71.6 years. In total, 28
220 (63.9%) had colon cancer, 12 674 (28.7%) had rectal cancer,
and 3251 (7.4%) had rectosigmoid cancer; 32 237 (73.0%) had
cancer stage recorded and 34 370 (77.9%) had grade recorded;

 33 268 (75.4%) were treated with colorectal surgery and 13 567
(30.7%) had chemotherapy. Of the 13 567 patients who had
chemotherapy, 327 (2.4%) had stage 1 cancer, 2235 (16.5%)
had stage 2 cancer, 5717 (42.1%) had stage 3 cancer, and 2277
(20.4%) had stage 4 cancer, and in 2516 (18.5%) stage was not
recorded. Smoking status was recorded in 41 449 (93.9%) of
patients, ethnicity in 38 544 (87.3%), and body mass index in
36 979 (83.8%). In the derivation cohort, 17 642 (40.0%) had
complete data for all the variables compared with 5716 (37.6%)
in the validation cohort. Table 1 in the web appendix shows
summary statistics of predictor variables for patients with
complete data compared with those with one or more missing
values.
Baseline characteristics of both men and women were similar
in the derivation and validation cohorts. However, there were
some differences in baseline characteristics between the sexes.
For example, in the QResearch derivation cohort, 69.1% of
women had colon cancer compared with 59.7% of men. Use of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy was higher in men than in
women (33.0% v 27.9% and 16.8% v 11.8%, respectively). Men
were more likely than women to be former smokers (table 2⇓,
40.1% v 24.9%), have cardiovascular disease (23.3% v 15.5%),
and have type 2 diabetes (14.8% v 11.2%). Men were also more
likely to be prescribed statins (29.7% v 21.6%) and aspirin
(24.5% v 17.0%) at diagnosis. Women were more likely than
men to be anaemic at diagnosis (28.3% v 20.3%) and have raised
platelet count (11.85 v 6.6%).
Table 2 in the web appendix compares baseline characteristics
of men and women with and without a family history of bowel
cancer. Women with a family history tended to be more affluent,
have a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and were more likely to
have surgery than women without a family history. These
differences were less noticeable in men.
Primary outcomes
In the 44 145 patients in the derivation cohort, there were 26
887 deaths during follow-up, and of these, 13 588 (50.5%) were
recorded as due to colorectal cancer. Of the 15 214 patients in
the QResearch validation cohort, there were 9404 deaths, and
of these, 4770 (50.7%) were recorded as due to colorectal cancer.
Of the 437 821 patients in the PHE validation cohort, there were
277 628 deaths. Information on cause of death for patients in
the PHE validation cohort was not available.
Table 3⇓ shows the 5 and 10 year age standardised observed
and relative net survival values for each cohort. Table 3⇓ also
shows the observed and relative net survival since diagnosis
conditional on surviving the first year, which shows a noticeable
improvement.
Models
Colorectal cancer mortality
Table 4⇓ shows the adjusted hazard ratios for deaths from
colorectal cancer for variables in the final model for men and
women in the derivation cohort. Details of the fractional
polynomial terms for age and body mass index and statistically
significant interactions are shown in the footnote of table 3⇓
and figure 1⇓. The final models included several variables: age,
deprivation, cancer stage, cancer grade, smoking status,
colorectal cancer surgery, chemotherapy, family history of bowel
cancer, raised platelet count, abnormal liver function test result,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and prescribed aspirin and
statins at diagnosis. In women, increased survival was associated
with younger age, colorectal cancer surgery (adjusted hazard
ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.51), family history
of bowel cancer (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74), and prescriptions for statins
(0.72, 0.66 to 0.78) and aspirin (0.86, 0.77 to 0.96) at diagnosis.
The results for men were comparable except for family history
where the adjusted hazard ratio for men was 0.82 (0.67 to 0.98).
Poorer survival in men and women was associated with a later
stage of cancer, a poorly differentiated grade, increasing
deprivation, heavy smoking, raised platelet count, abnormally
raised liver function test result, diagnosis of cardiovascular
disease, and type 2 diabetes. There were statistically significant
interactions in men and women between age and cancer stage
and between chemotherapy and cancer stage (table 4⇓) and in
women between age and aspirin use (fig 1⇓). In women, cancer
stage was strongly associated with colorectal cancer mortality.
For example, in those who did not have chemotherapy the risk
of death from colorectal cancer in those with stage 4 cancer was
35 times higher (adjusted hazard ratio 35.6, 26.5 to 47.9) than
women with stage 1 cancer. These hazard ratios were lower in
women who had chemotherapy. In men and women with stage
1 and 2 cancer those receiving chemotherapy had an increased
risk of colorectal cancer mortality compared with those not
receiving chemotherapy, in patients with stage 3 or 4 cancer,
chemotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal
cancer mortality. For example, in women with stage 1 cancer
the risk of colorectal mortality was 3.2 times higher in those
who had chemotherapy than in those who did not have
chemotherapy (3.21, 1.95 to 5.31). For women with stage 4
cancer, chemotherapy was associated with a 44% lower risk of
death from colorectal cancer (0.56, 0.49 to 0.63).
Other cause mortality
Table 5⇓ shows the adjusted hazard ratios for mortality from
other causes. The hazard ratios for fractional polynomial terms
are shown in figure 1⇓. The model included all the predictors
in the colorectal cancer mortality model as well as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic renal disease. The
direction of the hazard ratios was similar to that for the
colorectal mortality model, although the magnitude of the hazard
ratios was less for cancer grade and stage. In women there was
an interaction between age and aspirin use. In men and women
there were interactions between age and cancer stage,
chemotherapy and cancer stage, cardiovascular disease and
cancer stage, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
cancer stage. For example, in women with stage 1 cancer, those
with cardiovascular disease had a 39% increased risk of other
cause mortality compared with those without cardiovascular
disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval
1.07 to 1.80). Similarly, in women with stage 1 cancer, those
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a 111%
increased risk of other cause mortality compared with those
without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.11, 1.54 to
2.89). The interactions between chemotherapy and cancer stage
showed a reduced risk for chemotherapy in people with stage
3 and stage 4 disease. For example, in women with stage 4
cancer those who had chemotherapy had a 49% lower risk of
other cause mortality compared with those did not have
chemotherapy (0.51, 0.44 to 0.60).
Landmark analysis
We undertook a landmark analysis, restricted to the 13 926
women and 17 935 men who survived the first year after
diagnosis. The results for colorectal mortality are shown in table
3 in the web appendix. The adjusted hazard ratio for colorectal
surgery in women was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to
0.71) and for chemotherapy (stage 1 cancer) was 1.97 (1.40 to
2.75). The corresponding figures in men were 0.62 (0.56 to

and 4 cancer, chemotherapy was not associated with a reduced
risk of death from colorectal cancer.
Validation—discrimination and calibration
Table 6⇓ shows the performance of each equation in both
validation cohorts for five year survival estimates. Table 4 in
the web appendix shows the corresponding results at 1 and 10
years. For example, in women the five year equation for
colorectal cancer mortality explained 45.3% of the variation in
the QResearch validation cohort; the D statistic was 1.86 and
Harrell’s C statistic was 0.80. The corresponding results for all
cause mortality were 42.6%; 1.77 and 0.79. Performance for
one year risk estimates was marginally better and those for 10
year estimates were marginally worse (see table 4 in the web
appendix). Overall, performance in the QResearch validation
cohort was marginally better than that in the PHE cohort for all
comparisons in both men and women and at all time points.
Figure 2⇓ shows the mean predicted risks and observed risks
by 10th of predicted risk at 1, 5, and 10 years for men and
women for all cause mortality in both validation cohorts as well
as the corresponding graphs for colorectal cancer mortality in
the QResearch validation cohort. The correspondence was close
between the mean predicted risks and the observed risks,
indicating that the equations were well calibrated for each of
the time points and across both validation cohorts and for both
outcomes.
Decision curve analysis
Figure 3⇓ displays the net benefit curves for both colorectal
cancer mortality and other cause mortality equations at five
years in men and women. The prediction equations for colorectal
mortality and for other cause mortality had higher net benefit
than strategies based on considering either no patients or all
patients for intervention across a range of risk thresholds.
Web calculator
Figures 4 and 5⇓ show a clinical example of the implementation
of the equations as a web calculator (http://qcancer.org/
colorectal-survival/index.php), illustrating how the number of
years since diagnosis affects survival estimates. The example
in figure 4⇓ is for a 38 year old woman with grade 1, stage 4
colorectal cancer who has had a hemicolectomy and
chemotherapy. Her initial five year survival estimate at diagnosis
is 45.0% (white bar), risk of death from colorectal cancer is
35.6% (blue bar), and risk of death from other causes is 19.4%
(dark blue bar). Having survived for 12 months since diagnosis,
her five year survival estimate is 57.1%, her five year risk of
death from colorectal cancer is 25.8%, and her five year risk of
death from other causes is 17.0% (fig 5⇓).
Figures 6 and 7⇓ show a second example, illustrating how the
general practice derived variables affect survival estimates. The
example in figure 6⇓ is for a 65 year old woman with grade 3,
stage 2, colorectal cancer who is a non-smoker. Her five year
survival estimate at diagnosis is 63.1% (white bar), five year
risk of death from colorectal cancer is 21.6% (blue bar), and
risk of death from other causes is 15.3% (dark blue bar). If she
is a heavy smoker, has stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, an abnormal
liver function test result, and raised platelet count, her five year
survival estimate is 24.9%, her five year risk of death from
colorectal cancer is 39.5%, and her five year risk of death from
other causes is 35.6% (fig 7⇓).
Figure 8⇓ shows a third example, illustrating how the competing
risk of death from other causes (dark blue bar) becomes the
predominant factor over time, especially in elderly people. The
example in figure 8⇓ is for an 80 year old woman with stage 1,
grade 1 colorectal cancer who is a light smoker and has angina.
Her estimated overall survival at one year (white bar) is 75.1%,
at five years is 32.2%, and at 10 years is 10.8%. Her risk of
death from colorectal cancer (blue bar) at corresponding time
points is 6.2%, 13.5%, and 14.3%. Her mortality from other
causes (dark blue bar) at these time points is 18.4%, 53.9%, and
74.5%. The web calculator can then be used to show the risks
if she has colorectal surgery and/or chemotherapy to help inform
her decisions about treatments.
Discussion
We have developed and externally validated equations to predict
the absolute risks of both all cause mortality and colorectal
cancer specific mortality for men and women with colorectal
cancer over 1, 5, and 10 years. The equations are well calibrated
and have good discrimination, with Harrell’s C statistics at least
0.76 in both validation cohorts for both outcomes (all cause
mortality and colorectal cancer mortality). These models are
designed to provide better information on survival for individual
patients, taking account of their profile, including both
conventional factors (age and cancer stage) and deprivation
index, smoking status, common comorbidities, prescribed drugs,
and cancer treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy. These
models, based on information likely to be available at the point
of diagnosis, have been designed to help improve the
management decisions by patients and clinicians in primary and
secondary care.
We have provided a web based calculator (http://qcancer.org/
colorectal-survival/index.php) to illustrate how the risks vary
with the different predictors and over different time periods.
The equations to predict absolute risk of death from colorectal
cancer account for competing risk of death from other causes.
This is useful for identifying patients with a high risk of death
from colorectal cancer but with an otherwise low risk of death
from other causes for whom more aggressive treatment may be
appropriate. Equally they can identify patients with a low risk
of death from colorectal cancer and a high risk of death from
other causes for whom palliative care may be more appropriate.
However, management plans would need to be based on joint
decisions between clinicians and patients, reflecting individual
thoughts around risks and benefits of treatment or concerns
about side effects, living circumstance, or support available,
rather than prespecified cut-offs.
We have also provided conditional survival estimates, which
incorporate how risks change over time. These are particularly
important among patients where the initial prognosis is poor
owing to late stage disease. For example, a 38 year old woman
who has just received a diagnosis of stage 4 well differentiated
colorectal cancer may want to know her estimated survival with
and without a hemicolectomy and chemotherapy to help her
assess the potential value of surgery. Using the web calculator,
her five year survival estimate would be 5.9% without either
colorectal surgery or chemotherapy. With colorectal surgery
alone it would be 22.6% and with both treatments it would be
44.8%. This compares with the published five year survival
estimate of 66% based solely on her age (which is an
overestimate) or the 8% based solely on her cancer stage (which
is an underestimate if she receives treatment).2 Assuming she
has both colorectal surgery and chemotherapy and survives for
a year after diagnosis, her five year conditional survival after
diagnosis would have increased to 57.1%. Instead of the
currently available static prediction based on one or two

 variables, she would be able to obtain dynamic predictions,
which can be updated for each successive year after her original
diagnosis.31 More accurate dynamic survival estimates are
particularly valuable for patients who need to make important
life decisions and whose quality of life may be affected by
uncertainty about the future. For treating doctors, dynamic
conditional survival could help with planning the optimum
duration and intensity of follow-up.10 Conditional survival
estimates could also be used to stratify patients on entry to
clinical trials. The time at which the conditional survival plateaus
has been advocated as a potentially important endpoint in
clinical trial design (eg, the survival for head and neck cancer
plateaus at three years, leading to suggestions that three year
clinical trial data may provide a valid endpoint).46
Comparisons with the literature
Our study builds on several original studies that have developed
colorectal cancer prognostic models to predict overall survival
based on patients recruited to clinical trials in USA5 or US cancer
registries.4 6 In contrast with other studies, our model predicts
both overall survival and colorectal cancer specific survival. It
also predicts survival over a longer period (10 years rather than
five years). Our model provides conditional survival predictions
that can be updated for each additional year of survival since
the original cancer diagnosis. It does not, however, predict
recurrence-free survival unlike other models,4 5 as the date of
recurrence is not well recorded on our dataset.
Our model takes account of more variables than other models.4-6
The model by Renfo et al5 includes age, sex, race, body mass
index, performance status, cancer grade, cancer stage, ratio of
positive lymph nodes to nodes examined, number and location
of primary cancers, and chemotherapy. It can only be applied
to those with stage 3 cancer. The model by Weiser et al includes
cancer stage, cancer grade, number of lymph nodes examined,
number of positive lymph nodes, age, and sex.6 It can be applied
to patients who have curative intent surgery. A third model,
Adjuvant online4 includes cancer stage, cancer grade, 10 year
age band, sex, and comorbidity (perfect health, minor problems,
average for age, or major problems). It can be applied to patients
with stage 2 or 3 colon cancer. It has been validated although
the results focused on calibration rather than on discrimination.3
The Adjuvant online model itself has not been published and
the website is currently unavailable.
Our models have been developed using a large, representative
population based cohort and can be applied to all patients with
a first diagnosis of colorectal cancer including all stages of
disease and those who have or have not had chemotherapy. Our
model has better discrimination than previous models, with
Harrell’s C statistic of 0.76 to 0.78 compared with 0.665 to 0.68.6
As with the Weiser’s model, our model was well calibrated,
whereas the Adjuvant online model tended to overestimate
survival for patients with stage 2 disease.3
We included established predictors in our equations and report
hazard ratios similar in both magnitude and direction to those
reported elsewhere, increasing the clinical validity. For example,
the 17-18% reduced all cause mortality for patients prescribed
aspirin at diagnosis of colorectal cancer is consistent with studies
from Norway and the Netherlands.20 21 Similarly, the 23-29%
reduced mortality among those prescribed statins at diagnosis
is similar to that reported in a Danish study.19 The observed and
relative net survival rates overall and by cancer stage are
comparable to those reported elsewhere.14 38 For example, the
relative net five year survival in the Public Health England
(PHE) validation cohort was 51.2% and the conditional value
was 71.1% after one year. Coleman et al reported corresponding
values for England (2005-07) of 53.7% and 71.8%.14
We found some evidence of a beneficial effect of chemotherapy
for patients with stages 3 and 4 disease, with reductions in
colorectal cancer mortality of between 32% and 49%, which is
broadly consistent with observational studies47 and meta-analyses
of clinical trials.48 However, we found no clear evidence of a
beneficial effect of chemotherapy for patients with stages 1 and
2 disease, although the numbers of patients receiving treatment
were relatively small and our study was an observational one
rather than a randomised controlled clinical trial so subject to
residual confounding. However, our model could also be used
to risk stratify patients recruited to clinical trials, as has been
proposed by Weiser et al for similar US based algorithms.6 For
example, if higher risk groups can be identified, then the sample
size needed to show a defined benefit could be reduced. This
could be useful for trials of chemotherapy in patients with stage
1 and 2 disease where the benefit of chemotherapy is less certain.
Methodological considerations
The statistical methods we have used to derive and validate
these models are similar to those for other risk prediction tools
derived from the QResearch database, the strengths and
limitations of which have been discussed in detail.11 49 In
summary, key strengths include cohort size, duration of
follow-up, representativeness, and lack of selection, recall, and
respondent bias. UK general practices have good levels of
accuracy and completeness in recording clinical diagnoses and
prescribed drugs.50 The QResearch database has comprehensive
linked cancer and mortality records for virtually all patients and
is therefore likely to have picked up most cases of colorectal
cancer and related deaths, thereby minimising ascertainment
bias.
We decided to present separate models for men and women in
our protocol since there were likely to be important differences
in baseline characteristics between the sexes. Our analysis
showed differences for tumour location (women were more
likely to have colon cancer than men), uptake of chemotherapy
and radiotherapy (which was lower in women than men), and
baseline characteristics (men were more likely to smoke, have
cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and be prescribed aspirin
and statins at baseline). We also found that in women a family
history of bowel cancer was associated with improved survival,
but this was less so in men. Women with a family history of
bowel cancer tended to be more affluent and also to receive a
diagnosis at an earlier stage than women without a family history
of bowel cancer (table 2 in the web appendix). A possible
explanation for these findings may be that women with a family
history are more aware of red flag symptoms and present sooner
to their general practitioner and are referred more quickly.
However, we did include both deprivation and cancer stage in
our multivariate model.
We undertook two validations, one using a separate set of
practices and patients contributing to QResearch and the other
using patients not registered with QResearch practices but
included on the PHE cancer registry. The results of both
validations were similar, suggesting that the results are likely
to be generalisable to the population of England. The QResearch
validation cohort included all the variables for men and women
used to derive the scores (age, body mass index, Townsend
score, cancer stage, cancer grade, colorectal surgery, family
history, raised platelet count, abnormal liver function test result,
statin use, aspirin use, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal
disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The fully

 external NCRAS cohort was limited to the following variables:
age, cancer grade, cancer age, Townsend score, colorectal
surgery, and chemotherapy. This may explain why the
performance was marginally worse in the NCRAS validation
cohort (table 6⇓).
Other limitations of our study include the lack of formal
adjudication of diagnoses, although the accuracy of cancer
diagnoses is likely to be good given the development and utility
of the underlying NCRAS dataset and its use for national
statistics, as well as for multiple international research
studies.14 38 Our primary outcome was death from all causes and
we are confident that the date of death will be reliable since we
have used national death certification information. Our
secondary outcome was death from colorectal cancer and this
may be susceptible to misclassification bias since not all patients
will have a post-mortem examination. Hence it is possible that
some patients died of colorectal cancer but had another cause
of death recorded and vice versa, which could lead to some bias
in estimates of cancer specific survival.51
There is also potential for bias for predictor variables owing to
missing data for cancer stage, cancer grade, smoking status, and
body mass index, although this was addressed using multiple
imputation. Dates of colorectal surgery and chemotherapy were
unavailable on our subset of the NCRAS dataset, other than
whether they occurred within 12 months of the date of diagnosis.
This could lead to a survival bias,32 33 making colorectal surgery
appear to be unduly effective, although our additional landmark
analysis suggests this is likely to be marginal. Other potential
variables that we have not incorporated include the timeliness
of treatments and the availability of surveillance lower
endoscopy examinations. Geographical accessibility of medical
service providers may also impact on regular treatment and
surveillance of patients with colorectal cancer.
While we have derived and validated the equations using English
datasets, the equations could apply internationally by using
alternative deprivation scores relevant to the setting.
Alternatively the postcode (and hence deprivation scores) can
be omitted in the web calculator in which case a value of zero
will be assumed in the calculations. The result of this will be to
overestimate survival among deprived patients and
underestimate it for more affluent patients. Local validation
should be done to ensure good calibration and discrimination
in the applicable population.
Conclusions
We have developed and validated new risk prediction equations
to quantify overall and cancer specific survival of patients with
colorectal cancer, taking account of an individual’s clinical and
demographic characteristics. A more individualised approach
to prognosis will help improve the accuracy of information for
patients and hence decision making. It could also assist with
informing follow-up schedules.

 What is already known on this topic
Realistic estimates of overall survival are important for patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer who need to make decisions about
the risks and benefits of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or palliative care
There is a lack of robust information on survival that takes account of patient characteristics and the likely effect of different treatments
Prognostic models that include more variables tend to produce more accurate predictions than those simply based on stage of cancer
at diagnosis
What this study adds
New prognostic models for colorectal cancer that predict both overall survival and colorectal mortality were developed and validated
The models include the facility to update the survival estimates conditional on the number of years of survival since diagnosis
Compared with other models, they predict survival over a longer period and have better discrimination

NS=Not sufficient. Too few events occurred in the QResearch validation cohort to calculate 95% confidence intervals or 10 year survival for stage 4 cancer.
*Relative survival is the ratio of the overall survival for a cohort of patients with cancer to the expected survival in the general population matched by age, sex, and
calendar year. Background rates were obtained from the Office for National Statistics. Rates were directly age standardised using standard weights proposed by
Corazziari et al
45: 15-44 (7%), 45-54 (12%), 55-64 (23%), 65-74 (29%), >75% (29%).
†Sample too small to calculate 95% confidence interval.
