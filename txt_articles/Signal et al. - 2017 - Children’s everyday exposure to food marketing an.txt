Abstract
Background: Over the past three decades the global prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased
by 47%. Marketing of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods and beverages contributes to this worldwide increase.
Previous research on food marketing to children largely uses self-report, reporting by parents, or third-party observation
of children’s environments, with the focus mostly on single settings and/or media. This paper reports on innovative
research, Kids’Cam, in which children wore cameras to examine the frequency and nature of everyday exposure to
food marketing across multiple media and settings.
Methods: Kids’Cam was a cross-sectional study of 168 children (mean age 12.6 years, SD = 0.5) in Wellington, New
Zealand. Each child wore a wearable camera on four consecutive days, capturing images automatically every seven
seconds. Images were manually coded as either recommended (core) or not recommended (non-core) to be marketed
to children by setting, marketing medium, and product category. Images in convenience stores and supermarkets were
excluded as marketing examples were considered too numerous to count.
Results: On average, children were exposed to non-core food marketing 27.3 times a day (95% CI 24.8, 30.1) across all
settings. This was more than twice their average exposure to core food marketing (12.3 per day, 95% CI 8.7, 17.4). Most
non-core exposures occurred at home (33%), in public spaces (30%) and at school (19%). Food packaging was the
predominant marketing medium (74% and 64% for core and non-core foods) followed by signs (21% and 28% for core
and non-core). Sugary drinks, fast food, confectionary and snack foods were the most commonly encountered non-
core foods marketed. Rates were calculated using Poisson regression.
Conclusions: Children in this study were frequently exposed, across multiple settings, to marketing of non-core foods
not recommended to be marketed to children. The study provides further evidence of the need for urgent action to
reduce children’s exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods, and suggests the settings and media in which to act.
Such action is necessary if the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity’s vision is to be achieved.

 Background
Over the past three decades the global prevalence of
childhood overweight and obesity has increased by 47%
[1]. Excess adiposity during childhood and adolescence
is associated with an increased risk of many serious
health conditions and has lifetime consequences for chil-
dren’s health, well-being, and productivity [2–4].
Marketing
of
energy-dense
nutrient-poor
(EDNP)
foods and beverages contributes to the worldwide in-
crease in childhood obesity [5] by encouraging the re-
peat purchase and consumption of foods that do not
meet nutritional guidelines [6–8]. Internationally, it is
estimated that 60% to 90% of food marketing to children
is for pre-sugared breakfast cereals, soft drinks, savoury
snacks, confectionery and fast foods [8]. The World
Health Organization (WHO) Commission on Ending
Childhood Obesity (ECHO) recommends reducing chil-
dren’s exposure to, and the power of, marketing of un-
healthy foods [5]. ECHO states that “settings where
children and adolescents gather (such as schools and
sports facilities or events) and the screen-based offerings
they watch or participate in, should be free of marketing
of unhealthy food and sugar-sweetened beverages” [5,
p.18]. According to the WHO Regional Office for Eur-
ope Nutrient Profiling Model [9], foods not recom-
mended
to
be
marketed
to
children
include
confectionery, sweet snack food, ice-cream, iced confec-
tionery and sugar-sweetened and artificially-sweetened
beverages. In New Zealand, the industry self-regulating
Children’s Code for Advertising Food states that “food
advertisements should not undermine the food and nu-
trition policies of Government, the Ministry of Health
Food and Nutrition Guidelines nor the health and well-
being of children” ([10], p.21.)
Previous studies quantifying children’s exposure to
food and beverage marketing have concluded that pro-
motions encouraging the consumption of EDNP prod-
ucts are ubiquitous in children’s environments [6, 11–
15]. Yet, despite this important work, little is known
about children’s actual daily exposure to food marketing.
This knowledge gap exists because previous research has
largely used self-report, reporting by parents, or third-
party observation of children’s environments. Further, it
often focuses on single settings [16–18] (outdoors) and/
or media (television) [11, 14, 19, 20]. This paper reports
on innovative research, Kids’Cam, which used wearable
cameras to examine the frequency and nature of New
Zealand (NZ) children’s everyday exposure to food and
non-alcoholic beverage marketing (hereafter food mar-
keting) across multiple media and settings [21]. Market-
ing exposure was examined by socioeconomic status and
ethnicity (including whether the magnitude of any ethnic
differences varied with socioeconomic status), as child-
hood obesity is strongly patterned by these factors [21].
Methods
Study design
Kids’Cam was a cross-sectional study of 168 Year 8 chil-
dren (typical age range 11 to 13 years) in the Wellington
region of NZ. Children were asked to wear a camera
around their neck from when they got up in the morning
until going to bed for four consecutive days (Thursday to
Sunday, to capture both weekday and weekend expo-
sures). They were advised to remove the camera in situa-
tions where privacy could be expected (e.g. toilet or
shower facilities), if they felt uncomfortable, when swim-
ming or playing vigorous sport, or if requested. The cam-
era automatically captured a 136° image of the front-
facing scene approximately every seven seconds. Data
were collected over a 12-month period from July 2014 to
June 2015 to allow for seasonal variations. Full details of
the study methods (including sample size calculations) are
published elsewhere [22]. The study protocol is available
at https://diet.auckland.ac.nz/content/kidscam
Sampling and recruitment
Sampling and recruitment were conducted in two stages,
first at school level and then child level. The number of
Year 8 children enrolled across all schools in the
Wellington region was collated using aggregate school
enrolment data from the Ministry of Education, and
schools were sampled with probability-proportional-to-
size stratified random sampling by school decile1 (low
decile = 1–3, medium decile = 4–7, high decile = 8–10)
and student ethnicity Māori (indigenous population), Pa-
cific (mostly second generation migrants from Pacific
Islands), and NZ European (NZE). This sampling strat-
egy facilitated comparisons of marketing exposure by so-
cioeconomic status and ethnicity, and gave a total of
nine sampling strata. Randomly selected schools were
invited to participate.
In consenting schools, a maximum of 20 Year 8 chil-
dren were randomly selected from the class list, strati-
fied by ethnicity, using R 3.2.4 (R Institute, Vienna). The
school principal or lead teacher reviewed the list of stu-
dents to identify children who did not meet the study
criteria (n = 5 over the study period). The first 15 eli-
gible children were invited to participate, and the first
six children on the list who returned signed consent
forms (including parental consent) were selected to par-
ticipate. The number of children invited exceeded the
number of participants required in order to achieve re-
cruitment of four to six children per school (as per the
sampling strategy), and reduce the burden on the
schools from multiple rounds of invitation.
Data collection and management
Written consent was gained from children and their par-
ents and basic demographic data were collected via
Signal et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:137 
Page 2 of 11
 parental questionnaire. A briefing session was held with
participating children the day before the cameras were
first worn to explain the project. Following data collec-
tion, cameras were collected and images downloaded,
with children given the opportunity to review and delete
any photos before the researchers viewed them. At this
review, height and weight were measured to determine
age- and gender-specific BMI, using the extended inter-
national body mass index cut-offs [22]. Approved images
were downloaded to a password-protected server, saved
in secure cloud storage, and backed up to a password-
protected external hard drive. Approximately 1.3 million
images were recorded that could be coded for the pres-
ence of food marketing.
Coding of image data
Image coding was performed using a coding protocol to
guide content analysis [23]. Customised software en-
abled manual coding of each image. Marketing was de-
fined as “any form of commercial communication or
message that is designed to, or has the effect of, increas-
ing recognition, appeal and/or consumption of particular
products and services” ([24], p.9). A three-tiered frame-
work was used to code each relevant image for setting,
marketing medium and food product category, based on
the WHO food marketing framework [9]. Key settings
codes were home, school, food venues, recreation venues
and other public spaces. Key marketing media codes
were product packaging, signs, in-store marketing, print
media, screen and merchandise.
MB, TC and four other health science students under-
took the coding. A half day training workshop was held
with all coders and coders were then given access to the
dataset for a number of days to become familiar with it.
Once coders felt comfortable, reliability testing was con-
ducted, with each coder achieving 90% concurrence with
model answers on a test dataset of 115 images before
coding commenced. Coders were supervised by MS, MB
and TC to ensure consistency. Uncertain codes were
noted as such and checked by MB or TC.
All foods were classified as either recommended (core)
or not recommended (non-core) to be marketed to chil-
dren based on the WHO Regional Office for Europe Nu-
trient Profiling Model [9], with some modifications (e.g.
a ‘fast food’ category was added which included all com-
mercially prepared food products sold at quick service
restaurants). All fast food was classified as not recom-
mended to be marketed to children as it is typically high
in saturated fat and sodium and low in fiber [25]. Mar-
keting in convenience stores and supermarkets was too
extensive to code individually and was therefore ex-
cluded from this analysis. Codes were only assigned to
an image where 50% or more of a brand name or logo
could be clearly seen by the coder. Individual images
could be coded for multiple marketing media and prod-
uct categories.
Further processing of the coded data included deter-
mining the number of marketing exposures for each
unique exposure code (defined as the combination of
setting, medium and product type for that code). A mar-
keting exposure was defined as starting on the first in-
stance of an image with a particular setting/medium/
product code; subsequent images were counted as part
of the same exposure. An exposure was considered to
have ended when 30 s had elapsed since the last re-
corded code of that setting/medium/product code (de-
fined using the image timestamps). Any subsequent
code for that same combination after this 30 s limit was
counted as the start of a new exposure sequence.
The number of exposures was summed for each unique
exposure code by child; aggregate counts were determined
for each child to estimate total exposures to core and
non-core foods, and exposure by setting, medium, and
product type. Cleaning and aggregation of coded data was
completed in R version 3.2.3 (R Institute, Vienna).
Data analysis
All statistical analysis was conducted in Stata 12 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Data analysis for study
outcomes accounted for the complex sampling by using
inverse sampling weights to account for over- and
under-sampling of groups by ethnicity and school decile
relative to their share of the Year 8 population in the
Wellington region, and inferential statistics incorporated
elements to handle sample stratification and clustering
of children within schools (95% confidence intervals, p-
values) [26] using Stata’s svy prefix commands and asso-
ciated weighting options.
Descriptive analysis of the overall cohort was under-
taken to describe children by ethnicity, school decile
group, age, gender, individual deprivation (NZiDep) [27]
and BMI status. Schools participating in the study were
described by sub-region within the greater Wellington
area and school decile group.
Descriptive analysis of rates of core and non-core food
marketing exposures for each child was undertaken by
taking the total number of exposures (by core and non-
core foods) and dividing by the total number of photos for
that child, with this number subsequently re-scaled as an
exposure rate for a ten hour day. These were summarised
within the major sampling groups (ethnicity and school
decile stratum) as median and interquartile ranges of the
daily rates, weighted for the sampling design.
Subsequent analysis of rates of marketing exposures
used Poisson regression methods, as appropriate for
count-based numerator data, analysed separately for
core and non-core food marketing exposures. Rates and
rate ratios were presented with 95% confidence intervals
Signal et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:137 
Page 3 of 11
 (95% CI). Results were reported as rates per day of pho-
tos (i.e. per 10 h of photographs). Each photo was speci-
fied as contributing seven seconds of exposure time
(seven seconds being the median interval between im-
ages) for the Poisson regression.
Rates of core and non-core exposures per day were
analysed using Poisson regression models. Separate
models were constructed for core and non-core food ex-
posures. For each, an initial model looked at differences
by ethnicity, adjusted for child gender and age (treated
as a linear covariate); a second model added school de-
cile group (area level socioeconomic position) to this
first model. A third model examined our primary re-
search question of whether ethnic group differences in
overall rates of marketing exposures differed across
school decile group, by including interaction terms be-
tween these two variables. P-values are reported for hy-
pothesis tests of these interaction terms and fully
stratified results are presented when these hypothesis
tests were significant. These results are presented in the
additional files as rates within each ethnicity/school de-
cile stratum, and as rate ratios comparing exposure rates
between ethnic groups, as calculated separately within
each school decile stratum.
Results
Participating schools and children
Sampling and recruitment of schools and children are
summarised in Fig. 1. All 93 schools with Year 8 stu-
dents in the Wellington region were eligible to be sam-
pled. Twenty-eight schools were approached across the
nine sampling strata and 16 consented to participate
(57%). Of the 443 children invited to participate, 192
gave consent (43%) and 168 participated (38%). Sociode-
mographic information for participating children is pre-
sented in Table 1. Most children were 12 years old (75%:
mean = 12.6 years, SD = 0.5) with approximately equal
numbers of girls and boys (52.7% female). Just over half
the children were of normal weight or underweight
(57.5%);
with
the
remainder
overweight
or
obese
(42.5%). The lower part of Table 1 shows location and

of photos available for analysis within each stratum.
Rates of marketing exposures
Rates of marketing exposures per day for core and non-
core foods are presented in Table 2. The mean rate for
core food was 12.3 marketing exposures per day; for
non-core foods, the mean rate was 27.3 marketing expo-
sures per day, more than twice that for core foods. Add-
itional file 2 reports the median and interquartile range
of daily exposure to core and non-core food marketing:
the interquartile range spread from 15 to 34 non-core
exposures per day.
Most core food marketing exposures occurred at home
or school (5.5 and 5.3 exposures per day, making up
45% and 43% of all core exposures respectively) (see
Table 2 and Fig. 2, top panel); for non-core food market-
ing exposures, the majority happened either at home
(33% of all non-core exposures) or in public spaces other
than food or recreation venues (30% of all non-core ex-
posures). One-fifth of non-core food marketing expo-
sures occurred at school (19%). Additional file 3 gives
further detail regarding the settings in which marketing
exposures occurred: for example, most exposures in
other public spaces were on the street or on shop fronts.
The majority of marketing exposures were in the form
of food packaging (see Table 2 and Fig. 2, bottom panel),
at a mean rate of 9.1 exposures per day for core foods
(74% of core exposures) and 17.4 exposures for non-core
foods (64% of non-core exposures). The remaining mar-
keting exposures were mostly signs (21% and 28% of
core and non-core food marketing exposures, respect-
ively) (see Fig. 3 for images of marketing).
Types of non-core food product marketing exposures
Marketing exposure rates for specific non-core food
product categories are presented in Table 2. The largest
share was for sugary drinks (mean rate of 9.1 exposures
per day, 33% of non-core exposures) followed by fast
food (22% of non-core exposures), confectionery (11%
of non-core exposures) and snack foods (10% of non-
core exposures). Foods making up the remainder of
non-core marketing exposures (24% of exposures) are
listed in Table 2.
Rates of marketing exposures by child ethnicity and
school decile stratum
The mean exposure rates for core and non-core foods
are presented in Additional file 4, stratified by ethnicity
and school decile stratum. The rate of exposure for non-
core foods was higher than for core foods in all strata.
Initial analysis for core foods compared exposure by
ethnicity, adjusted for gender and age (Table 3, model
1). Māori children had non-significantly higher rates of
exposure compared to NZE (RR = 1.55, 95% CI 0.68,
3.56); and Pacific children had similar rates of exposure
to NZE (RR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.59, 1.61). Adding school
decile group into the model did not appreciably change
ethnic differences (Table 3, model 2). Compared to
middle-decile children, children at higher decile schools
had higher exposure to core foods (RR = 1.60, 95% CI
1.03, 2.48); while children at lower decile schools had
non-significantly
higher
rates
of
such
exposure
(RR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.80, 1.73; reference is middle decile
group).

 interaction test between ethnicity and school decile
group, which was non-significant, suggesting that ethnic
patterns were similar across school decile groups (F 4,
15 = 1.99; p = 0.1481).
Analysis of ethnic differences in non-core exposures
(adjusted for child gender and age; Table 3, right hand
column, model 1) showed non-significantly higher rates
of exposure to non-core foods for Māori children rela-
tive to NZE (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 0.90, 1.55) but not for
Pacific children (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.84, 1.16). Differ-
ences in exposure by school decile group appeared
minimal (Table 3) and adjustment of ethnic differences
for school decile group did not appreciably change
estimates from those in the initial model. A third model,
incorporating interaction terms, suggested that ethnic
differences in non-core exposures differed across the
three school decile groups (F 4, 15 = 4.58, p = 0.013).
These results are presented in Additional files 4 and 5.
In brief, there was reasonably strong evidence for ethnic
differences in the lowest school decile group (Māori
RR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.97, 1.47; Pacific RR = 1.50, 95% CI
1.19, 1.89; both relative to NZE).
Discussion
Children in this study were exposed to non-core food
marketing, food not recommended to be marketed to
children, 27.3 times a day on average across all settings,
excluding

 Exposure to non-core food marketing was more than
twice that of exposure to core food marketing (12.3
times a day). Most non-core exposures occurred at
home, in public spaces and at school. Food packaging
was the predominant marketing medium, followed by
signs. Product packaging is commonly used to attract
attention, provide information about product attri-
butes and encourage purchase at point-of-sale [16].
Product packaging is particularly salient as children
are the population group most vulnerable to such
food marketing [20].
Children were most exposed to non-core marketing
for sugary drinks, fast food, confectionary and snack
foods, a finding consistent with previous research [11,
14,
28–31].
A
notable
exception
is
exposure
to
marketing for high-sugar, low-fibre breakfast cereals
which comprised only 2.5% of all non-core marketing.
Research in the UK and Australia found high rates of
such marketing on television [11, 30].
Although televisions, smart phones, tablets and com-
puters often appeared in the images, screen-based mar-
keting is likely under-reported in the current study as
content on screens was often not clear enough to meet
coding criteria in the images. Research across 11 coun-
tries in 2010 reported five food advertisements per hour
of television. A 2014 national survey of NZ children
aged 6–14 found 88% watch television each day, 44% of
whom watch more than an hour a day [32] thus poten-
tially seeing five food advertisements daily on television
alone, considerably more than the 0.2 exposures per day

 identified across all screen types in the current study.
Food marketing on new media is also of concern (e.g.
websites, social media and apps) and may have even
greater impact than traditional media e.g. television [33].
NZ children engage with the internet frequently, with
66% accessing it daily [32].
Exposure to non-core food marketing was higher than
for core foods in all school decile strata. Core exposures
were more common in the high school decile groups;
while for non-core exposures, there were no significant
differences in exposure by these school decile groups.
Similarly, while Māori children had higher exposure to
both core and non-core marketing than NZE children,
these results were not statistically significant in the ad-
justed models. The more complex model incorporating
interaction terms suggested that ethnic group differences
were somewhat varied across school decile group, with
stronger evidence in the lowest school decile group for
Pacific and Māori children.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to objectively
measure children’s exposure to food marketing in their
everyday environments across multiple settings and in
multiple media. The use of automated wearable cameras
enabled unprecedented access to children’s worlds, re-
cording their exposures with food marketing as they
occurred. This methodology overcomes many of the
limitations inherent in using self-report or proxy report
data
[34].

 environmental observation studies, particularly in private
contexts such as the home.
While this research provides some of the most robust
data yet analysed on children’s exposure to food market-
ing, it does have limitations. First, the images do not de-
termine if a child actually sees the marketing in the
image. For example, the child could be looking away, al-
though given the extent of food marketing in children’s
environments they may still see marketing. Secondly, the
decision to only code an image if 50% or more of a
brand name or logo could be clearly seen is likely to
underestimate the exposure to marketing, as does the
exclusion of marketing in convenience stores and super-
markets, where marketing is likely to be extensive [35].
Further, the use of still photography may have missed
some exposures. However, excluding screens, conveni-
ence stores and supermarkets, the ratio of more than
two non-core food marketing exposures for every one
core exposure is likely to be consistent, despite these
limitations. The participation rate (n = 192 or 43% of in-
vited children consenting to participate; with space for
168 participants, or 38% of the full invitation list partici-
pating) was reasonable for a study that required ongoing
engagement by the children over several days. It remains
possible that those children and families consenting to
participate were systematically different from children
who did not participate. Finally, while the sample size
was determined prior to the study commencing, the
number of participants was limited by the study budget
and timeframe. This meant that some analyses (e.g.
comparisons of exposure rates by ethnic group) might
have had sub-optimal power to detect differences be-
tween groups, which is reflected in the relatively wide
confidence intervals for these estimates. These specific
estimates should be interpreted with caution.
Further real time research is needed on children’s ex-
posure to marketing in convenience stores and super-
markets and on screens to complement this research.
Further exploration of potential ethnic differences ap-
pears warranted, but will require a substantially larger
sample size to improve statistical precision and power.
Use of photo elicitation [36] with children who wore
cameras would likely elicit valuable data on the meaning
of food marketing and enable exploration of effective
means
for
intervention
from
children’s
perspective.
Manual data coding was resource intensive, taking a
total of 1440 person-hours. While this was an extensive
undertaking, the richness of the resulting dataset made
it worthwhile: the children collected 2553 h of image
data from their perspective, giving insight into settings
that would have been difficult to study as a participant
observer. Ancillary studies also benefitted from this ini-
tial coding, as settings and other image characteristics
were already available to researchers, which reduces
processing times in these subsequent studies [37, 38].
Further, automated image recognition has the potential
to aid analysis and reduce manual coding time require-
ments [39, 40]. The Kids’Cam method has the potential
to validate other methods, e.g. surveys of school food
policies, with in-depth analysis of the actual food envir-
onment [41]. Comparative research of children’s expos-
ure to food marketing in other jurisdictions would
further strengthen the global body of evidence.
This research suggests that children live in an obeso-
genic food marketing environment that promotes obesity
as a normal response to their everyday environment
[42]. Children are more than twice as likely to be ex-
posed to non-core food marketing, not recommended to
be marketed to children [9], than core food marketing,
and to be exposed multiple times a day across various
settings and via multiple media. All children, regardless
of socio-economic position, were exposed to more non-
core than core food marketing, and there appears to be
some ethnic patterning.
Particularly concerning is the amount of exposure in
school, an environment where children’s health is re-
quired to be protected under NZ law [43], and which
the ECHO Commission states should be free of such
marketing [5]. Exposure in public places is an arena for
central and local governments globally. Given that over
two-thirds of marketing is in the form of food packaging,
consideration should be given to plain packaging in
some specific cases (e.g. sugar sweetened beverages) as a
highly effective intervention in this arena [44].
Conclusions
The ECHO Commission is right to call for the reduction
of children’s exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods [5].
This research provides further evidence of the need for ac-
tion and suggests both settings and media in which to act.
Urgent action is required if the vision of the Commission
on Ending Childhood Obesity is to be achieved.
