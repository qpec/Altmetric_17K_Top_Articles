Abstract
Background—There is a relative paucity of information on both empirical and subjective 
treatment strategies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), especially in late life. This paper 
reviews the findings from two 2016 surveys conducted through the American Psychiatric 
Association publication the Psychiatric Times and via a member survey by the American 
Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP).
Methods—We present the results of the two surveys in terms of descriptive frequencies and 
percentages and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to late-life TRD.
Results—The Psychiatric Times survey received 468 responses, and the AAGP survey received 
117 responses, giving an overall sample of 585 responses. The majority (76.3%) of respondents 
from both groups believed that a large randomized study comparing the risks and benefits of 
augmentation and switching strategies for TRD in patients aged 60 years and older would be 
helpful, and 80% of clinicians believed their practice would benefit from the findings of such a 
study. Of the treatment strategies that need evidence of efficacy, the most popular options were 
augmentation/combination strategies, particularly augmentation with aripiprazole (58.7%), 
bupropion (55.0%), and lithium (50.9%).
Conclusions—Late-life TRD constitutes a large proportion of clinical practices, particularly of 
geriatric psychiatry, with lacking evidence of efficacy of most treatment strategies. These surveys

Depression is a major public health issue, and is associated with significant mortality, 
morbidity, and economic burden. It is the third-greatest contributor to global disease burden1 
and affects both low- and high-income countries with a 12-month prevalence of 5.9% and 
5.5%, respectively.2 Depression is projected to hold the greatest illness burden in high-
income countries by 2030,1 and it is therefore paramount to develop a coordinated strategy 
for its treatment. The economic cost of depression in the United States is estimated to be 
$210.5 billion, with 45% attributable to direct medical costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 
50% to indirect workplace costs (i.e., loss of productivity through absenteeism and 
presenteeism3).
Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is defined as failure to achieve disease remission with 
adequate trials of two or more pharmacologically dissimilar antidepressants, and accounts 
for 12%–20% of depression cases.4,5 It is believed to arise from biological incompatibility 
between the molecular basis of an individual's depression and the antidepressant used to 
treat it, and/ or due to a comorbidity hindering antidepressant effect, such as psychiatric co-
morbidity, childhood trauma, or personality disorder.6 Fewer than 55% of patients achieve 
remission with first and second trial of antidepressants, meaning a significant portion of 
depression does not respond to conventional treatment guidelines.7
There is a relative paucity of information on treatment options and efficacy in TRD, 
especially in late life. This paper reviews the findings of a clinician survey on TRD, 
conducted by the Psychiatric Times and the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry 
(AAGP), and discusses both strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to TRD.
Methods
A brief online survey on clinician attitudes towards TRD was composed by the OPTIMUM 
co-investigators and edited by the editors of the Psychiatric Times and the AAGP research 
committee. Both surveys used identical questions. The surveys were both conducted in 
January 2016. The Psychiatric Times distributed the survey through an e-blast to 100,000 
Web subscribers. A notification of the survey was also in the printed journal, which has a 
subscribership of 40,000. The AAGP distributed the survey through an e-mail to 1,355 
subscribers. The survey sought information about practice location, work setting, years in 
practice; proportion of treatment-resistant patients in practice, including those 60 years and 
older; and the need to acquire evidence of efficacy for a variety of augmentation or 
switching strategies was obtained from both groups of clinicians. Half of the questions had 
set answers to choose from, and half were free-text. Data were pooled from both surveys 
unless otherwise stated.

 Results
The Psychiatric Times survey received 468 responses (0.47% response rate), and the AAGP 
survey received 117 responses (8.63% response rate); the overall sample size was 585. 
Those participating in the surveys represented a variety of clinical backgrounds and work 
settings, as detailed in Table 1.
The United States was well represented in the surveys, contributing 80.1% of responses from 
across the Northeast (26.1%), Southeast (16.7%), Midwest (18.1%), Southwest (7.5%) and 
West (12.5%) regions of the country. The remaining 19.1% of responses came from 41 
countries, including Australia, the UK, Canada, and India. Both sides of the experience 
spectrum were represented, with 33.8% of respondents in their first decade of practice, and 
35.8% having practiced for more than 25 years. The balance of genders was marginally in 
favor of female respondents. The respondent demographics are broken down further in Table 
2.
Two-thirds of respondents reported that TRD accounted for up to one-quarter of their 
practice, and an additional 20.8% reported that it accounted for up to one-half of their 
practice (Table 3). Patients aged 60 years or over accounted for 10%–25% of the TRD 
workload in 32% of practices, and this was the mode response. General psychiatrists 
responding to the Psychiatric Times survey responses indicated a lower proportion of older 
TRD patients in their practices compared with the AAGP survey responses, indicating that 
geriatric psychiatrists carry the heaviest load of treating these patients. The aggregate results 
are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.
The majority (76.3%) of respondents in both groups believe that a large randomized study 
comparing the risks and benefits of augmentation and switching strategies for TRD in 
patients aged 60 years and older would be helpful, of which more than one-third would find 
it extremely helpful, as outlined in Table 4. Importantly, four in five clinicians believe that 
their practice would benefit from the findings of such a study.
When offered a choice of treatments to be studied, the most popular options were 
augmentation strategies—namely, augmentation with aripiprazole (58.7%), bupropion 
(55.0%), and lithium (50.9%). Switching to bupropion and nortriptyline were less popular, 
as seen in Table 4.
The Psychiatric Times offered respondents an opportunity to suggest an alternative treatment 
to be studied, and just less than one-third of survey takers took this opportunity. The most 
common suggestions were psychotherapy, augmentation with antipsychotics, transcranial 
magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, addition of a 
second antidepressant both typical (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], serotonin 
noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors) and atypical (mirtazapine) as well as newer agents (vortioxetine), use of 
methylphenidate and other stimulants, ketamine, and lamotrigine. Several respondents 
suggested supplementation of thyroid hormone, and less frequently, folate and omega 3. 
Other drugs named were memantine, pramipexole, pindolol, nefazodone, buspirone, and

 glutaminergic treatment. Finally, lifestyle measures such as exercise and various 
complementary and alternative practices, including acupuncture, were also suggested.
Discussion
The findings of this survey support reported rates of TRD of 10%–25% in community 
samples. In older adults, depression is more likely to follow a chronic or relapsing course,8 
and 55%–81% of older adults with major depressive disorder fail to respond to an SSRI or 
SNRI.9 Depression in older age is an important risk factor for all-cause dementia,10 and is 
associated with higher utilization of health care services, caregiver burden, and suicide 
rates.11,12
The findings of our survey support TRD being a significant unresolved issue in practices of 
general and geriatric psychiatrists. Previous studies, including STAR*D, VAST-D, PReDICT 
and iSPOT-D, have explored treatment of TRD in young adults, yet there is a relative paucity 
of research in the management of TRD in older adults (also known as TRDOA).13 Global 
aging of the population brings this undertreated population to the forefront of the attention 
of both clinicians and researchers. This view is shared by 76.3% of our survey respondents.
In general TRD populations, a meta-analysis reviewing 48 trials of augmentation agents 
found that quetiapine, aripiprazole, thyroid hormone, and lithium were significantly more 
effective than placebo in treatment, notwithstanding tolerability issues with antipsychotics 
and lithium, and safety issues with thyroid hormone supplementation.14 In TRDOA, a 
double-blind randomized control trial of aripiprazole to augment venlafaxine therapy 
achieved 12 weeks of sustained remission in almost half the participants assigned to the 
intervention group, with a number needed to treat of 6.6.9 The use of aripiprazole in older 
adults was associated with mild and transient akathisia and Parkinsonism, typically tremor, 
but not associated with cardiometabolic side effects, QTc prolongation, or increased suicidal 
ideation.9 In this same study, severe baseline anxiety and cognitive inflexibility were 
associated with reduced remission rates.15 These findings demonstrate that aripiprazole has 
good outcomes, tolerability, and safety in TRDOA.
Conclusions
TRD is clearly a major burden to communities and health services. In the general adult 
population, there are a number of promising treatment strategies for TRD in development 
including ketamine, novel compounds, somatic treatments and brain stimulation treatment 
options, complementary and integrative treatment modalities, and pharmacogenetics 
guidance. There is a clear need for more randomized studies that explore novel treatments, 
and compare risks and benefits of different combination strategies.
