IMPORTANCE Depression is frequent in patients with heart failure and is associated with
adverse clinical outcomes. Long-term efficacy and safety of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors in these patients are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether 24 months of treatment with escitalopram improves
mortality, morbidity, and mood in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression.

INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive escitalopram (10-20 mg) or
matching placebo in addition to optimal heart failure therapy. Study duration was 24 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The composite primary outcome was time to all-cause
death or hospitalization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included safety and depression
severity at 12 weeks of treatment (including the titration period), which were determined
using the 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (total possible score, 0 to 60;
higher scores indicate more severe depression).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction and depression, 18 months of treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo
did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality or hospitalization, and there was no significant
improvement in depression. These findings do not support the use of escitalopram in
patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression.

C
ompared with the general population, depression is
2- to 3-times more common in patients with cardio-
vascular disease.1 Patients with depression have
worse outcomes after myocardial infarction,2 and physically
healthy individuals with depression are at increased risk of
developing coronary disease.3 Meta-analysis indicates that
depression prevalence in patients with heart failure is 10%
to 40%, depending on disease severity.4 Depression has
been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality and
rehospitalization in patients with heart failure,5,6 with inci-
dence rates increasing in parallel with depression severity,6
and was found to be associated with poor quality of life,7
increased costs,8 and low treatment adherence.9
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely
used to treat depression. According to meta-analysis data,
sertraline and escitalopram have better efficacy and patient
acceptability than other new-generation antidepressants.10 In
patients with coronary disease, randomized studies showed
that SSRIs were safe and might improve depression, but had
no beneficial effect on prognosis.11-13 However, post hoc
analyses from the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart
Disease trial12 indicated that prolonged SSRI treatment might
reduce mortality and morbidity.14
Until now the Sertraline Against Depression and Heart
Disease in Chronic Heart Failure (SADHART-CHF) study is the
only randomized trial evaluating SSRIs in patients with heart
failure.15 Compared with placebo, sertraline did not improve
depression or cardiovascular status, but treatment duration
was only 12 weeks. Assessment of the effects of SSRIs over a
longer period seemed required to detect possible effects of
these agents on long-term clinical outcomes in patients with
heart failure.
Therefore, the Effects of Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibition on Morbidity, Mortality and Mood in Depressed
Heart Failure Patients (MOOD-HF) study was designed to
investigate long-term efficacy and safety of escitalopram in
patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression.
We hypothesized that pharmacotherapy with this antide-
pressant would reduce the increased mortality and morbid-
ity risk associated with comorbid depression in patients
with heart failure.5,6
Methods
Study Design
MOOD-HF was a double-blind, placebo-controlled random-
ized clinical trial conducted at 16 tertiary medical centers in
Germany. Study design information has been reported,16 and
thefullstudyprotocolappearsinSupplement2.Thestudypro-
tocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee at
eachstudysite.Allparticipantsprovidedwritteninformedcon-
sent prior to inclusion in the study. Patients were not com-
pensatedforstudyparticipationexceptfortravelexpenses.The
trial was conducted according to the guideline for good clini-
cal practice17 and the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki 2002.18 The principal investigators oversaw the con-
duct of the trial and data analysis. The trial was reviewed by
an independent data and safety monitoring committee. The
eMethods in Supplement 1 provides more details.
Study Population
Adult attendees at heart failure outpatient clinics with an es-
tablished diagnosis of heart failure (New York Heart Associa-
tion class II-IV) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
of less than 45% documented within the last 3 months were
screened for depression using the 9-item Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire (PHQ-9).19 Those with a score of 12 points or higher
(or ≥9 points by protocol amendment on June 30, 2011;
Supplement 2) underwent a Structured Clinical Interview20
based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders (German version of the Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) (SCID)
with a psychiatrist or psychosomatic specialist, which was
scheduled at least 2 weeks later to exclude transient mood
swings (eMethods in Supplement 1). Patients diagnosed with
current major depression according to DSM-IV criteria21 dur-
ing the SCID were then invited to participate in MOOD-HF and
askedtoprovidesignedinformedconsent.Otherinclusionand
exclusion criteria have been reported previously16 (and ap-
pear in the eMethods).
Study Treatments and Follow-up
The study design is shown schematically in eFigure 1 in
Supplement 1. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive
either escitalopram (10-20 mg once daily) or matching placebo
for up to 24 months in addition to optimal heart failure care.
Randomization strata were age, sex, depression severity, and
timesincethelasthospitalization(eMethods).Thestartingdose
was 5 mg once daily, increasing to 10 mg/d and 20 mg/d after 3
and 6 weeks; slower uptitration was permitted for tolerability
reasons. The dose at 12 weeks was considered the mainte-
nance dose. From December 5, 2011, the maximum dose was
limited to 10 mg/d in patients aged 65 years or older based on
the pharmaceutical manufacturer’
s recommendation.
Tolerance-guided uptitration of heart failure pharma-
cotherapy22 and patient counseling and empowerment
(with modules addressing heart failure signs and symptoms,
lifestyle modifications, drug adherence, self-care, and self-
supervision skills) occurred in parallel during telephone con-
tacts and personal visits using previously reported effective
care strategies.23,24 Maintenance therapy and the clinical sta-
tus of patients were evaluated every 6 months.
After the final visit, patients were tapered off study medi-
cation and underwent a psychiatric closeout examination to
clarify the need for continued antidepressant pharmaco-
therapy. The first patient was randomized on March 11, 2009,
and the last on February 24, 2014. Final patient follow-up took
place on September 2, 2014.
Psychometric and medical safety assessments were per-
formed at each follow-up visit (eMethods in Supplement 1).
Cardiologists used the 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depres-
sion Rating Scale (MADRS)25 to assess depression. Each item
of the 10-item MADRS yields a score of 0 to 6 resulting in an
overall score from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating
more severe depression. Commonly used cutoff ranges are
0 to 6, normal; 7 to 19, mild depression; 20 to 34, moderate

depression; and greater than 34, severe depression.26 Addi-
tional safety measures included weekly telephone monitor-
ing of depressive symptoms and cardiac status during upti-
tration, and then bimonthly monitoring. Specialized nurses
applied the 2-item PHQ27 during telephone calls, and imme-
diately involved a psychiatrist or psychosomatic specialist if
he/she suspected significant worsening of depression or sui-
cidal ideations. Prescription of open-label antidepressant
therapy was permitted only after consultation with the psy-
chiatric core laboratory. After database closure, serum esci-
talopram levels were measured28 from serial serum samples
stored at –80°C (eMethods).
Study End Points
The primary efficacy outcome was time to a first event of
the composite of all-cause death or hospitalization (exclud-
ing planned hospitalization for noncardiac causes). Pre-
specified psychometric secondary outcomes included the
MADRS sum score25 at 12 weeks, anxiety as assessed with
the 7-item PHQ for generalized anxiety disorder,29 and
health-related quality of life (assessed using the Kansas City
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]).30 Other prespeci-
fied secondary outcomes were time-to-event variables as
the individual components of the primary outcome, time to
cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure,
escitalopram serum levels, heart failure pharmacotherapy,
and parameters describing heart failure severity, cardiac sta-
tus, and safety. In addition, various subgroup analyses of
the primary outcome were performed.
Adjudication of time-to-event outcomes was performed
by an independent end point adjudication committee using
prespecified criteria. Committee members were blinded to ini-
tial treatment assignment and had no information on whether
patients were taking study medication, taking an open-label
antidepressant therapy, or not taking antidepressant drugs.
Sample Size
We estimated an annual rate for the primary outcome of 36%
with placebo, and hypothesized a 25% relative reduction in
primary outcome events with escitalopram, corresponding to
a hazard ratio (HR) of ln(0.73)/ln(0.64) = 0.705 (eMethods in
Supplement 1). Accordingly, 257 adjudicated end points were
required to achieve 80% power with a type I error of .05.
Total event rates after recruitment of 240 patients indicated a
considerably higher than anticipated hospitalization rate
(60%). Therefore, we recalculated that data for 414 patients
(instead of the planned 70018) would be sufficient to achieve
80% power while also maintaining the HR (protocol amend-
ment of August 6, 2012; eMethods).
Early Termination
On February 28, 2014, the steering committee stopped enroll-
ment based on futility after a recommendation from the data
and safety monitoring committee. The decision was made dur-
ing the regular data review process and not based on a pre-
specified futility rule. After that date, the next scheduled ap-
pointmentconstitutedthefinalstudyvisitforpatientswhohad
participated in MOOD-HF for at least 6 months. Patients with
shorter study participation continued until completing 6
months. Follow-up was completed on September 2, 2014.
Statistical Analysis
The full statistical analysis plan appears in Supplement 3.
Analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat ba-
sis,whichincludedallpatientswhotookatleast1doseofstudy
medication.Baselinecharacteristicsweresummarizedasmean
and standard deviation (median and interquartile ranges if ap-
propriate) for continuous variables and as counts (percent-
ages) for categorical variables.
Time-to-event end points were analyzed by Cox regres-
sion. Results are presented as HRs with 95% CIs. Analyses
were performed for each end point, both unadjusted and
after adjusting for stratification at randomization. The pre-
specified primary hypothesis test was the adjusted modified
intention-to-treat analysis of all-cause death and hospitaliza-
tion. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event curves were generated.
Changes in MADRS sum scores from baseline to 12 weeks
were assessed by analysis of covariance. Generalized estimat-
ing equations were used for repeated measurement analyses
of all consecutive MADRS assessments.
Analysis of covariance and ordinal or binary logistic
regression models were used to analyze other quantitative
ordinal and binary outcomes as appropriate. In each of these
models, the follow-up measurement was the dependent vari-
able, and treatment group and the respective baseline
variable were predictors. For each of the tests, the binary
subgroup variable and subgroup × treatment interaction
term was added to the Cox model used in the primary analy-
sis. Subgroup HRs and 95% CIs are reported from these mod-
els in which the respective subgroup category was defined as
the reference category. P values for the interaction terms
were reported (null hypothesis was equal HRs in the sub-
groups). Analyses of serious adverse event frequencies were
adjusted for time alive and under observation. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp).
Significance tests were 2-sided. P values <.05 were defined as
statistically significant.
Results
Study Population
Screening using the PHQ-9 was performed on 11 086
patients; 2872 qualified to be further assessed using the
SCID and 773 consented to be interviewed. Of the 508
patients with SCID-confirmed major depression, 376 met all
inclusion criteria and were randomized; however, 4 with-
drew consent prior to receiving any study medication. These
4 patients were prospectively excluded from all analyses
(eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Therefore, 372 patients (185 in the escitalopram group
and 187 in the placebo group) who took at least 1 dose of
study medication constituted the modified intention-to-treat
population (Figure 1). Study treatment dosages were compa-
rable at 12 weeks (mean [SD], 15.8 [6.4] mg of escitalopram
and 14.9 [7.6] mg of placebo). The median participation times

were 18.4 months in the escitalopram group and 18.7 months
in the placebo group. No patient was lost to follow-up.
Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups
(Table 1). Patients were predominantly male and on average
62 years of age with impaired LVEF and enlarged cavity
size; the average MADRS sum scores at baseline indicated
mild to moderate depression severity.25,26 Kansas City Car-
diomyopathy Questionnaire assessment30 demonstrated
substantial symptom burden and impaired disease-specific
quality of life. The 7-item PHQ for generalized anxiety disor-
der and the Mini-Mental State Examination sum scores indi-
cated moderate anxiety but no cognitive impairment.29,31
Most patients were receiving guideline-recommended heart
failure medication regarding substance classes.22
Efficacy Outcomes
A primary end point event occurred in 116 patients (63%) in
the escitalopram group and in 119 patients (64%) in the pla-
cebo group (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.27], P = .92; Figure 2
and Table 2). No significant between-group differences were
found for any time-to-event outcomes in the unadjusted or ad-
justedanalyses(Table2).Additionalsubgroupanalysesshowed
no significant treatment × subgroup interactions (eFigure 2 in
Supplement 1).
The mean (SD) baseline MADRS sum score changed from
20.2 (8.6) at baseline to 11.2 (8.1) at 12 weeks with escitalopram
and from 21.4 (8.8) to 12.5 (7.6) with placebo (between-group
difference, –0.9 [95% CI, –2.6 to 0.7], P = .26; Figure 3). Mean
(SD) daily dosages of study medication were comparable in the
2 groups (15.8 [6.4] mg in the escitalopram group and 14.9 [7.6]
mg in the placebo group). The overall between-group treat-
ment difference across all MADRS assessments was –0.9 (95%
CI, –2.3 to 0.4; P = .16).
Changes in the PHQ-9, the KCCQ, the 7-item PHQ for gen-
eralized anxiety disorder, and the Mini-Mental State Exami-
nation scores from baseline through 12 months appear in
eTable 2 in Supplement 1. The PHQ-9 results confirmed com-
parable remission of depressive symptoms with both escita-
lopram and placebo. The KCCQ scores suggested clinically
relevant improvements in health status and quality of life
within groups. However, between-group differences did not
reach statistical significance except for the KCCQ Symptom
Scale, which was significantly higher in patients in the pla-
cebo group at 12 months. Anxiety decreased in both groups
and there was no difference regarding the extent of improve-
ment in anxiety between groups. Mini-Mental State Exami-
nation scores did not change.
Secondary and Exploratory Outcomes
The median escitalopram levels were in the therapeutic
range of 15 ng/mL to 80 ng/mL28 throughout the trial. Treat-
ment adherence was satisfactory; 86% of patients in the

escitalopram group had serum levels of escitalopram above
the lower detection limit of 6.3 ng/mL at study visit 3, 88%
at study visit 4, 85% at study visit 5, and 73% at study visit 6
(eTable 3 in Supplement 1). At 12 weeks, 95% of patients
were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin-receptor blockers and β-blockers. The propor-
tion of patients receiving guideline-recommended target
doses22 increased during the first 12 weeks of the study
(eTable 4). Uptitration of heart failure medication did not
differ between groups.
Changes in heart failure severity and cardiac status from
baselineto6and12monthsappearineTable5inSupplement1.
In both groups, LVEF improved comparably. However,
there was a faster decrease in N-terminal pro-B-type natri-
uretic peptide levels in the placebo group, and only patients
in this group showed a reduction in left ventricular end-
diastolic diameter, resulting in significant between-group dif-
ferences at 6 and 12 months.
Exploratory analysis suggested that irrespective of treat-
ment allocation, remission of depression symptoms, or
marked improvement after 6 weeks did not decrease the
HR for the primary outcome (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).
Furthermore, higher baseline MADRS scores appeared to be
associated with worse outcomes in patients in the escitalo-
pram group compared with those in the placebo group
(eFigure 4 and eFigure 5).
Tolerability and Safety
In the escitalopram group, the proportion of patients discon-
tinuingtreatmentafter6weekswas11%andafter12weekswas
15% compared with 5% and 7%, respectively, in the placebo
group (P = .04 at 6 weeks and P = .02 at 12 weeks). Through-
out the study, participation was comparable in the 2 treat-
ment groups; the HR for study withdrawal, discontinuation of
study medication, and open-label antidepressant therapy was
similarinbothgroups(eTable6inSupplement1).Overall,there
were no between-group differences in safety parameters and
serious adverse event rates except for worsening depression,
which occurred more often in patients in the placebo group
(eTable 7 and eTable 8).
Discussion
This study involving 372 patients with chronic systolic heart
failure and depression showed that escitalopram was well tol-

According to a modified intention-to-treat analysis (4 patients who were
randomized but did not take at least 1 dose of study medication were excluded).
Median follow-up times were 560 days (interquartile range, 201-747 days) in
the escitalopram group and 573 days (interquartile range, 306-747 days) in the
placebo group. The median times at risk for the primary end point (all-cause
death or all-cause hospitalization) were 148 days (interquartile range, 46-386
days) in the escitalopram group and 162 days (interquartile range, 42-377 days)
in the placebo group. There were 116 patients in the escitalopram group with an
event and 119 in the placebo group.

These results are similar to those of the Sertraline Antide-
pressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial11 and the Enhancing
Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease study,12 both of which en-
rolledpatientswithcoronarydiseaseanddepressionandfound
no beneficial effects with 6 months of antidepressant treat-
ment. Although the efficacy of escitalopram for treating pri-
mary depression is considered superior to that of sertraline,10
and although the treatment duration in the current trial was
extended to 24 months compared with only 12 weeks in the
SADHART-CHFtrial,15treatmentwithescitalopramhadnoben-
eficial effect in our patients who were diagnosed as having a
major depressive disorder according to the DSM-IV but had
baseline MADRS scores indicative of only mild to moderate
depression.26
To our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate
the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization in a
population with heart failure treated with escitalopram. Al-
though the trial was terminated early, mean treatment dura-
tion was more than 18 months in each group, and the results
are based on a sizable number of adjudicated outcome events.
Furthermore, the lack of overlap between the HR for the pri-
mary end point in the trial and the HR used in the sample size
calculation suggests that if escitalopram did have any thera-
peutic efficacy, this effect was significantly smaller than the
effect postulated in the trial hypothesis.
The concordant changes in MADRS and PHQ-9 sum scores
observed in both groups in this study are in line with
SADHART-CHF,15 but are contrary to evidence from patients
with coronary disease,11-14 in whom SSRI therapy was (com-
pared with placebo) associated with significantly greater im-
provement in depressive symptoms. Given that escitalopram
levels were always in the therapeutic range28 in our study, the
results are likely to indicate an absence of therapeutic effi-
cacy. In addition, the exploratory analysis suggested that re-
mission or improvement of depressive symptoms was not as-
sociatedwithbetterclinicaloutcomes.Therefore,theincidence
rates of the composite primary outcome appeared to be inde-
pendent of the response to escitalopram or placebo. Contrary
to expectations, other exploratory analysis findings showed
that the frequency of the primary composite outcome might
even increase with escitalopram treatment in patients with
heart failure in whom higher MADRS scores indicate more se-
vere depression.
These observations support the concept of alternative
pathophysiological mechanisms for mood disorders in so-
matic illnesses, with depressive symptoms less responsive or,
as in both SADHART-CHF15 and our study, unresponsive to ser-
traline or escitalopram. Placebo-controlled trials of antidepres-
sants tended to exclude patients with severe somatic illnesses.
These observations suggest that the efficacy results of these
studies may not necessarily be transferable to all individuals in
whom antidepressants are prescribed in clinical practice.
Improved LVEF, decreased N-terminal pro-B-type natri-
uretic peptide levels, lower New York Heart Association class,
and higher KCCQ scores (as observed in both groups during the
study) predict better survival.22,33-35 In this study, mortality
rateswerelowinbothgroups,particularlycomparedwiththose
reported from SADHART-CHF,15 and within the range re-
ported from the Heart Failure-A Controlled Trial Investigat-
ing Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) study or the
Patient-Centered Disease Management for Heart Failure trial,
which both enrolled unselected patients with or without
depression.36,37
In contrast, hospitalization rates in this study were high,
possibly as a result of recruiting patients from heart failure out-
patient clinics at tertiary care centers, the majority of whom
had experienced at least 1 hospitalization for heart failure dur-
ing the year before randomization and were thus at high risk
of recurrent adverse outcomes.22 We found in a previous
study38 evaluating enhanced heart failure care (similar to that
offered to all participants in MOOD-HF) that even though mor-
tality decreased significantly more in patients who were de-
pressed compared with those who were not depressed, hos-
pitalization rates remained comparably high. Possible
mechanisms by which mortality could have been reduced in-
clude (1) tolerance-guided uptitration of heart failure medi-
cation, (2) practical training in self-care, and (3) regular moni-
toring of treatment adherence by nurses specialized in the care
of patients with heart failure. Interestingly, the psychosocial
support provided in the SADHART-CHF study did not appear
to be associated with comparable clinical effects.15
More recently, Freedland et al39 demonstrated that inte-
grative cognitive behavior therapy effectively improved de-
pression in a younger population with heart failure, but not
self-care and physical functioning. This finding is remark-
able in view of the present and previous15 negative results with

The error bars indicate 95% CIs. The group sizes at baseline refer to all patients
who had at least 1 MADRS follow-up assessment. Each item of the 10-item
MADRS questionnaire yields a score of 0 to 6 resulting in an overall score from
0 to 60, with higher values indicating more severe depression. The effect of
escitalopram vs placebo at 12 weeks was –0.9 (95% CI, –2.6 to 0.7; P = .26). The
overall effect of escitalopram vs placebo across all MADRAS assessments was
–0.9 (95% CI, –2.3 to 0.4; P = .16). The cutoff points are 0 to 6, which indicates
normal; 7 to 19, mild depression; 20 to 34, moderate depression; and greater
than 34, severe depression.26 Regression of an elevated MADRS sum score to a
value of 10 or less has previously been proposed as a reasonable indicator of
depression remission.24,32

SSRI therapy and the Patient-Centered Disease Management
for Heart Failure study, in which multidisciplinary patient-
centered disease management did not improve patient health
status;however,mortalitywaslowerandmoodimprovedmore
in participants who were depressed.36 Telephone-based col-
laborative care strategies have been shown to enhance health-
related quality of life, physical functioning, and mood symp-
tomsinpatientswithcardiovasculardiseaseandheartfailure.40
Given that sample size and observation time were lim-
ited in most of these trials, clinical outcomes could not be stud-
iedandthetypeandintensityoftheinterventionsvaried.More
research is needed to identify efficacious combinations of care
modules for patients with depression and heart failure. Cur-
rently available evidence suggests that a good approach could
be to combine classic collaborative disease management strat-
egies to optimize heart failure pharmacotherapy, self-
supervision, and drug adherence with physical training, which
reducedmortalityanddepressionintheHF-ACTIONtrial,37and
with cognitive behavior therapy, which favorably affects pa-
tients with depression.39
Adverse effects at the initiation of SSRI therapy11 led to
higher early withdrawal rates in patients in the escitalopram
group in our study; however, overall tolerability was compa-
rable between groups. There were no between-group differ-
ences in additional safety parameters. However, there was a
nonsignificant trend toward a greater risk of primary out-
come events in patients in the escitalopram group who were
older or had more severe heart failure, depressive symptoms,
or cognitive impairment. In an exploratory analysis, increas-
ingly higher event rates were observed with increasing base-
line MADRS scores in patients treated with escitalopram. Fur-
thermore, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels
decreased more slowly while patients were taking escitalo-
pram, left ventricular cavity size did not decrease as it did in
patients in the placebo group, and there was a trend toward
lower health-related quality of life as assessed by the KCCQ.
Interpretation of these secondary and exploratory findings re-
quires great caution, but the possibility of unfavorable ef-
fects with longer-term escitalopram therapy on cardiac sta-
tus and health-related quality of life cannot be ruled out.
Limitations
An important limitation of this study is its lack of generaliz-
ability. Numerous patients were not randomized because of
contraindications, ethnicity was predominantly white, and all
study centers were located in Germany. Furthermore, pa-
tients seen at heart failure outpatient clinics of tertiary care
centers typically belong to a higher risk category, but at the
same time receive the best possible heart failure care.22 In ad-
dition,manypatientscouldnotberandomizedbecauseofcon-
traindications, and only patients with heart failure and re-
duced LVEF were eligible. Therefore, these results cannot be
extended beyond the patient population studied.
The results also do not provide information on the use of
escitalopram in important subgroups that have been identi-
fied as being particularly resistant to antidepressant pharma-
cotherapy, such as women, black adults, and older persons
(aged ≥65 years). Excellent adherence in patients in the esci-
talopram group suggests that they may also have been par-
ticularly motivated to follow other treatment recommenda-
tions. Furthermore, our study did not assess escitalopram
alone. Participants likely benefited from the enhanced heart
failure care provided in both treatment groups.
There were also extensive safety measures incorporated
into the trial design, such as psychometric and medical as-
sessments at each visit, telephone monitoring, and psychiat-
ric or psychosomatic expertise (readily available on request).
All of these, plus the allowance for open-label antidepressant
therapyandunscheduledpsychiatricconsultationsinthestudy
protocol,couldhavebluntedbetween-groupdifferencesinout-
comes by diminishing treatment effects. However, the con-
sultation rates and the proportion of patients taking open-
label antidepressants were low and similar in patients in the
escitalopram and placebo groups. In addition, it seems pos-
sible that both groups in this study showed regression to the
mean (ie, their depressive symptoms improved without any
treatment).
Conclusions
Inpatientswithchronicheartfailurewithreducedejectionfrac-
tion and depression, 18 months of treatment with escitalo-
pram compared with placebo did not significantly reduce all-
causemortalityorhospitalization,andtherewasnosignificant
improvement in depression. These findings do not support the
use of escitalopram in patients with chronic systolic heart fail-
ure and depression.

Funding/Support: The study was funded by the
German Ministry of Education and Research and
Lundbeck AS Denmark. The Departments of
Cardiology, to which investigators enrolling patients
in the Effects of Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake
Inhibition on Morbidity, Mortality, and Mood in
Depressed Heart Failure Patients (MOOD-HF) were
affiliated received case payment from the German
Ministry of Education and Research and cofunding
from Lundbeck AS Denmark, which was distributed
by the Administrative Office of the Würzburg
University Hospital. Case payments were calculated
ex ante based on the expected net costs for 24
months of study participation per patient and data
entry into the central data base. Case payments
included funds for performing the Structured
Clinical Interview based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth
Edition) for the diagnosis of depression and for
psychiatric emergency interventions, which were
transferred to the partnering Departments of
Psychiatry or Psychosomatic Medicine. The
Institute of Clinical Epidemiology and Biometry,
University of Würzburg, and the Clinical Trial
Centre, University of Leipzig, received funding for
biometry, statistical analyses, and study
management.
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The German Ministry
of Education and Research and Lundbeck AS
Denmark had no role in the design and conduct of
the study; collection, management, analysis, and
