 Volunteering Is Associated with Lower Risk of Cognitive
Impairment

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether psychosocial factors
that can be a target for interventions, such as volunteering,
are associated with risk of cognitive impairment.
DESIGN: Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data from
1998 to 2012, a nationally representative longitudinal
panel survey of older adults assessed every 2 years, were
used.
SETTING: The HRS interviews participants aged 50 and
older across the contiguous United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60 and older in 1998
(N = 13,262).
MEASUREMENTS: Personal interviews were conducted
with respondents to assess presence of cognitive impair-
ment, measured using a composite across cognitive mea-
sures.
RESULTS: Volunteering at the initial assessment and vol-
unteering regularly over time independently decreased the
risk of cognitive impairment over 14 years, and these find-
ings were maintained independent of known risk factors
for cognitive impairment. Greater risk of onset of cognitive
impairment was associated with being older, being female,
being nonwhite, having fewer years of education, and
reporting more depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Consistent civic engagement in old age is
associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment and
provides impetus for interventions to protect against the
onset of cognitive impairment. Given the increasing num-
ber of baby boomers entering old age, the findings support
the public health benefits of volunteering and the potential
role of geriatricians, who can promote volunteering by
incorporating
“prescriptions
to
volunteer”
into
their
patient care. J Am Geriatr Soc 64:2263–2269, 2016.

t is estimated that more than one in five U.S. adults aged
71 and older has deficits in cognitive functioning but
does not yet have dementia.1 The rapid growth of the
number of older adults over the next 15 years in devel-
oped nations will exacerbate this.2 The consequences of
cognitive impairment without dementia include poorer
quality of life and greater risk of dementia, neuropsychi-
atric symptoms, disability and inability to live indepen-
dently, demands on families and informal caregivers, and
higher healthcare costs.3–10
There is mounting evidence that physical, social, and
cognitive activities in old age delay cognitive impairment
and declines in health.11,12 These findings support the “use
it or lose it” hypothesis, which postulates that, by staying
physically, socially, and cognitively active, older adults can
reduce the likelihood of cognitive impairment.12 It has
been proposed that organizational or formal volunteering
increases the level of physical, social, and cognitive activ-
ity, which in turn, reduces the risk of cognitive impair-
ment.11 However, empirical evidence that examines the
extent to which initiating organizational volunteering and
maintaining organizational volunteering are independent
predictors of the onset of cognitive impairment is lacking.
The present study used longitudinal panel survey data
from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine
whether volunteering at a specific point in time and
changes in volunteer status over time are associated with
risk of cognitive impairment in old age.
Organizational volunteering is an unpaid activity that
involves “taking actions within an institutional framework
that potentially provides some service to one or more other
people or to the community at large.”13 There is emerging
literature showing that volunteering is associated with
greater well-being and better physical health in later
life.14–17 For example, a recent meta-analysis focusing on
prospective cohort studies of older adults showed that,
after adjusting for known risk factors for mortality, volun-
teering reduced the risk of mortality by 24% on average.18
Initial research on the salutary effects of volunteering
in older adults has focused on health outcomes, with little
attention to the association between volunteering and cog-
nitive impairment,11 but research from the Experience
Corps randomized clinical trial found that older adults

 who volunteered had larger gains in executive functioning
over a period from 4 to 8 months.19 In addition to repli-
cating the beneficial effects of volunteering on enhancing
executive functioning, participants in the active treatment
group exhibited greater increases over 6 months in activa-
tion of the prefrontal cortex than control participants.20
Given the increasing number of baby boomers entering
old age, it is imperative to identify psychosocial factors that
can be the focus of low-cost interventions designed to delay
or decrease the risk of cognitive impairment in old age. Vol-
unteering is one such psychosocial factor. Conferences have
been held in recent years, and legislation designed to
enhance opportunities for older Americans to volunteer has
been enacted.21,22 Between September 2012 and September
2013, the rate of volunteering by adults aged 65 years and
older was 24.1%, which was slightly lower than the rate of
volunteering those aged 35 to 44 (28.2%) and 45 to 54
(26.0%). At the same time, median hours devoted to volun-
teering per year was greater for older adults (86 hours/yr)
than for those aged 45 to 54 (52 hours/yr) and 55 to 64
(52 hours/yr).23 As the baby boomers age, volunteer oppor-
tunities are increasing, and volunteering as a productive
later-life role is receiving increased attention.24
Organizational volunteering by older adults can be
viewed as a win-win-win endeavor. First, from the per-
spective of the recipient of volunteer services, older adults
are a critical human resource for addressing community
needs in the United States,25 and the benefits that recipi-
ents of volunteer services derive have been well docu-
mented.26–28 Second, from the volunteer’s perspective,
research indicates that they are have an advantage over
non-volunteers with respect to emotional health,14 physical
health,16 and longevity.18 Third, from a societal perspec-
tive, volunteer work is valuable work. In 2013, each hour
of volunteering was valued at $22.55.29 According to the
NGA Center for Best Practices (2008), through their vol-
unteer work, older adults contribute approximately $162
billion annually toward the U.S. economy.30
The present study examined whether levels of volun-
teering at a specific point in time and changes in volunteer-
ing (initiation, maintenance, or stopping of volunteering)
are associated with the onset of cognitive impairment. The
use of a single assessment of volunteering, which assumed
that engagement or lack of engagement in volunteering was
consistent across time, limited previous research. Engage-
ment in volunteering by older adults is dynamic over time.27
Longitudinal analyses yield information on whether the
maintenance of volunteering is associated with lower risk of
cognitive impairment, which in turn can inform public
health interventions aimed at promoting cognitive and phys-
ical health in old age. Adjusting for numerous known risk
factors for cognitive impairment, two hypotheses were
tested: volunteering at a specific point in time and mainte-
nance of volunteering over time will be associated with
lower risk of cognitive impairment in older adults.
METHODS
Participants
Data were used from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), a nationally representative sample of households in
the contiguous United States of noninstitutionalized adults
aged 50 and older.31–33 Participants were assessed on a
wide range of measures, including economic, sociological,
psychological, mental, and physical health information.
Since its inception in 1992, more than 30,000 individuals
have participated in the HRS. The current study included
HRS data collected from 1998 to 2012.
For the present study, data were analyzed from the
13,262 participants who, in 1998, participated, were aged
60 and older, were not cognitively impaired, and provided
data on all of our measures of interest. The 1998 wave
was used because the volunteering item was introduced
into the study at this wave and assessed at each wave
thereafter. Participants aged 60 and older in 1998 were
included
because
they
were
administered
all
of
the
measures used to create the cognitive impairment score.34
Figure 1 illustrates participant selection for the present
study and the number who became cognitively impaired.
The average time between observations was 2 years, and
participants had to provide data only in 1998; 1,178 pro-
viding data only in 1998. Participants had an average age
of 71.3 � 8.3 in 1998 and an average 11.8 � 3.4 years of
education; 58% were female, 85% were white, 62% were
married or partnered, and 21% were working.
Measures
Volunteering
Volunteering was first assessed in 1998 using a single item,
“Have you spent any time in the past 12 months doing
volunteer work for religious, educational, health-related,
or
other
charitable
organizations?”
(yes = 1,
no = 0).

 Binary measures of volunteering have frequently been used
to predict mortality risk and have been shown to distin-
guish between older adults who survive and those who
die.18 On average, participants contributed 5.5 � 2.5 lon-
gitudinal observations. Six thousand eight hundred three
participants did not volunteer, 1,782 volunteered one,
1,093 twice, 825 three times, 655 four times, 544 five
times, 521 six times, 431 seven times, and 608 eight times.
On average, participants indicated that they volunteered
during 1.7 � 2.4 of the eight possible waves included in
the study.
Cognitive Impairment
A short cognitive battery was administered that included
tests of memory (immediate and delayed recall), serial 7
subtractions, and naming and orientation from the Tele-
phone Interview for Cognitive Status,35 which has shown
validity in predicting cognitive impairment.1 A score of 8
or less (out of 35 points) indicates cognitive impairment;35
over the duration of this study (14 years) 1,884 partici-
pants (14%) became cognitively impaired.
Covariates
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic factors and covari-
ates included in the statistical models to examine whether
levels and changes in volunteering predict the onset of cog-
nitive impairment in addition to known risk factors for
cognitive impairment. Physical exercise was assessed using
a single item, “On average, over the last 12 months have
you participated in vigorous physical activity three times a
week or more?” (yes = 1, no = 0) (mean 0.41 � 0.49).
Smoking was assessed by combining items ascertaining
whether someone currently smoked or smoked during the
course of their life (0.24 � 0.43). Functional limitations

Each measure was assessed in the self-reported questionnaire.
Education level is the number of years of formal schooling that individuals received.
Physical exercise was assessed according to the answer to the question, “On average, over the last 12 months have you participated in vigorous physical
activity three times a week or more?” (yes = 1, no = 0).
Functional limitations were measured by asking participants if they had any difficulty using the telephone, managing money, taking medications, shopping
for groceries, preparing hot meals, walking several blocks, climbing several blocks, climbing one flight of stairs, lifting or carrying 10 pounds (4.53 kg),
picking up a dime, and pushing or pulling large objects (yes = 1, no = 0). Higher scores indicate a greater number of functional limitations.36,37Self-rated
health was assessed according to the answer to the question, “How would you rate your health at the present time?” using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = ex-
cellent to 5 = poor) and reverse coded so that higher scores reflect more-positive assessments of one’s health.
Cardiovascular-related illnesses were assessed with a sum index of the number of self-reported physician-diagnosed medical conditions (high blood pres-
sure, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, heart condition, stroke).
Depressive symptoms were assessed according to eight items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Participants were asked whether
they had experienced feeling depressed, everything was an effort, restless sleep, was (not) happy, felt lonely, (did not) enjoy life, felt sad, and could not get
going “much of the time during the past week” (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0).38

(1.06 � 0.99). Depressive symptoms were assessed with
eight items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale.38 Participants were asked whether they
had experienced each symptom much of the time during
the past week (yes = 1, no = 0) (1.64 � 1.93). Data from
the 1998 assessments were included in the statistical model
as covariates for physical exercise, functional limitations,

illnesses,
and
depressive symptoms.
Data Analyses
After bivariate analyses (1) comparing participants who
did and did not exhibit cognitive impairment on study
variables and (2) linking patterns of volunteer engagement
over
time
to
onset
of
cognitive
impairment,
shared
growth–survival models were applied that simultaneously
model longitudinal changes in volunteering and the sur-
vival process for cognitive impairment.39,40 Changes in
volunteering were modeled using a linear growth model,
which has two latent variables: the intercept, which was
centered at the 1998 assessment and represents likelihood
of
volunteering
in
1998,
and
the
slope
representing
changes in the likelihood of volunteering over time. A logit
link was used because volunteering was measured dichoto-
mously. The onset and timing of cognitive impairment,
defined as the first measurement occasion at which a score
of 8 or below was observed, was modeled using a discrete
time survival model. In the shared growth–survival model,
the intercept and slope for volunteering and the covariates
mentioned above were used as predictors of the occurrence
and timing of cognitive impairment.
Two models were then fit to examine whether and
how level and maintenance of volunteering were associated
with cognitive impairment. In Model 1, only the intercept
and slope for volunteering were included as predictors of
cognitive impairment. In Model 2, sociodemographic char-
acteristics and health behavior and status variables were
added to Model 1.
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
First, the characteristics included in the present study from
the 1998 assessment of participants who became cogni-
tively impaired over the course of the study were com-
pared with those who did not. T-tests were used for
continuous dependent variables and chi-square tests for
categorical dependent variables (Table 2). The cognitively
impaired and noncognitively impaired groups differed sig-
nificantly on all variables except smoking status. Partici-
pants who became cognitively impaired during the study
were older; had more functional limitations, more cardio-
vascular-related illnesses, and more depressive symptoms;
were more likely to be female and have fewer years of
education and lower self-rated health; and were less likely
to be white, married, working, exercising on a regular
basis, and volunteering in 1998 than those who did not.
Cohen’s d was used as the index of effect size for con-
tinuous variables and phi (/) as the index of effect size for
categorical variables. The d’s ranged from 0.15 to 0.75,
and the /’s ranged from 0.03 to 0.46, indicating that the
magnitude of the relationships between subsequent cogni-
tive impairment and baseline status on the study variables
was small to large.
Second, the likelihood of cognitive impairment for
individuals in the study who initiated or stopped volun-
teering was examined in relation to the baseline assessment
in 1998. Table 3 shows that 6,803 of the 13,262 partici-
pants included in the study did not volunteer over the
course of the study (1998–2012) and that 17.3% of them
became cognitively impaired. Focusing on participants
who did not volunteer in 1998 but who subsequently

 volunteered, as engagement in volunteering increased, a
smaller
proportion
of
individuals
exhibited
cognitive
impairment (7.6% of those who volunteered three or more
times). Focusing on those who volunteered in 1998, those
who stopped volunteering altogether after 1998 were more
likely to have cognitive impairment (16.1%) than those
who volunteered at least once more (11.7%). These pre-
liminary results highlight that volunteering and mainte-
nance of volunteering may be associated with lower risk of
cognitive impairment and provide further evidence as a
precursor to the analyses that simultaneously examine
changes in volunteering and onset of cognitive impairment
(the shared growth–survival framework).
Table 4 shows results from two models examining
whether level of and changes in volunteering predict cogni-
tive impairment. On average, the likelihood of volunteer-
ing declined over time, at a rate of �0.30 logits per year.
The
variances
for
level
and
changes
in
volunteering
(Table 4) were significant, indicating that participants var-
ied in likelihood of volunteering in 1998 (volunteered in
1998 = 14.99, standard error (SE) 0.57) and in rate of
change in volunteering over time (change in likelihood of
volunteering = 0.07, SE 0.003). Model 1 in Table 4 shows
that both volunteering in 1998 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.76,
95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72–0.79) and mainte-
nance
of
volunteering
over
time
(OR = 0.73,
95%
CI = 0.70–0.77) were associated with lower risk of cogni-
tive impairment. A 1–standard deviation increase in volun-
teering level was associated with 24% less likelihood of
cognitive impairment and maintenance over time with
27% less likelihood.
Sociodemographic factors and health behavior and
status covariates that are known risk factors for cognitive
impairment were included in Model 2. The effects of
volunteering
in
1998
and
changes
in
volunteering
remained statistically significant, indicating that higher
levels of and maintenance of volunteering over time are
protective against onset of cognitive impairment, indepen-
dent of known risk factors. Based on Model 2 (Table 4), a
1–standard deviation increase in volunteering level was
associated with 17% less likelihood of cognitive impair-
ment and maintenance over time with 23% less likelihood.
DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether initiating
and sustaining volunteering were associated with lower
risk of cognitive impairment in older adults. In a nation-
ally representative sample of adults aged 60 and older,
being a volunteer at a single point in time and mainte-
nance and initiation of volunteering over time were associ-
ated with lower risk of cognitive impairment, independent
of known risk factors for cognitive impairment. In con-
trast, neither smoking nor physical exercise was found to
reduce the likelihood of the onset of cognitive impairment.
Although physical exercise was negatively related to the
likelihood of cognitive impairment in the bivariate analysis
(Table 2), physical exercise was positively related to the
risk of cognitive impairment in the multivariate analysis
(Table 4). Several covariates were significantly associated
with cognitive impairment. More specifically, the onset of
cognitive impairment was positively associated with non-
white race, being female, low educational level, and more
depressive symptoms. Age was unrelated to onset of cogni-
tive impairment from 60 to 85 years old, but the risk of
cognitive impairment increased from age 85 to 100.
Given the number of baby boomers entering old age,
an important concern is how to encourage them to start
and sustain volunteering.41 To this end, it has been sug-
gested that geriatricians are well positioned to play an
important role by writing “prescriptions to volunteer” for
their patients.42 A feasibility study was conducted in a
large health maintenance organization in which physicians
recommended volunteering to their patients during an
office visit, office staff provided patients with information
on how to contact a nonprofit organization that matches
potential volunteers with opportunities for volunteer work,
and office staff followed up with patients.42 They con-
cluded that geriatricians should incorporate prescriptions
to volunteer into their medical tool box as an additional
tool for enhancing the health of their patients.
The current study findings have implications for public
health efforts that target older adults and for geriatricians;
51% of the sample did not report volunteering at any
wave, and another 13% reported volunteering at only one
of the eight assessments. At the same time, the findings
indicate that the level, initiation, and maintenance of vol-
unteering affect the risk of cognitive impairment. More-
over, other studies have provided evidence of the benefits
that older adults derive from volunteering with respect to
cognitive, emotional, and physical health.11,43 This corpus
of research suggests that volunteering is a viable health-
promotion strategy for older adults. Volunteerism has
advantages over other health promotion strategies for soci-
ety, including fostering civic society by addressing social
problems, expanding the fund of older adults’ human

VOLUNTEERING AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT

 capital through lifelong learning and skills training, and
making a substantial economic contribution.44
The results of the present study suggest at least two
directions for future research. One direction is to identify
the mediators of the association between volunteering and
cognitive impairment. According to the “use it or lose it”
hypothesis, volunteering reduces the likelihood of cognitive
impairment through the cognitive, social, and physical
activities that it engenders.12 It also has been proposed
that prosocial behaviors such as volunteering often evoke
compassionate motives.45 Compassionate motivation, in
turn, attenuates the stress response, which has salutary
downstream effects on the immune system. Inflammation,
an indicator of poor immune functioning, is posited to be
an antecedent of cognitive impairment.46 The second direc-
tion for future research is to examine moderators of the
association between volunteering and onset of cognitive
impairment. For example, resource-disadvantaged older
adults have been shown to benefit more from volunteering
than resource-advantaged older adults.47 Thus, the reduc-
tion in risk of cognitive impairment associated with volun-
teering may be greater for older adults with lower rather
than higher levels of education.
The
present
study
has
several
limitations.
First,
because of selection effects associated with volunteering, it
is particularly important to consider alternative models.
Although the study focused on level of and changes in vol-
unteering as predictors of cognitive impairment, it may
also be that level of and changes in cognitive functioning
influence whether older adults engage in volunteer work.
Second, it was not possible to assess important contextual
variables related to volunteering, such as type of volunteer
work and hours volunteered. It is likely that the type of
volunteer work, how many hours a week it is done, and
interactions involved while volunteering play a role in
determining how much benefit an older person derives
from volunteering. It is likely that there are differential
benefits of volunteering for older people who volunteer,
for example, as receptionists and those who volunteer by
leading exercise classes or tutoring children in schools.
Third, although a validated measure of cognitive impair-
ment was used,34 it did not permit analysis of the compo-
nents
of
cognitive
functioning
or
provide
a
clinical
diagnosis of dementia. Fourth, this observational study did
not establish a causal relationship between volunteering
and cognitive impairment. In an effort to exclude third-
party variables that might account for the relationship
between volunteering and cognitive impairment, certain
health variables were controlled for, and it was found that
volunteering was associated with lower risk of cognitive
impairment regardless of these variables.48 Finally, to the
extent that participants who would have exhibited cogni-
tive impairment at a later wave died before that wave, the
magnitude of the effects of volunteer levels and change on
cognitive impairment may have been underestimated.
Despite these limitations, to the best of the authors’
knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that
patterns of volunteering over time are associated with risk
of developing cognitive impairment. These findings provide
evidence that volunteering should be incorporated into
behavioral health interventions to help reduce the preva-
lence of deficits in cognitive functioning in older adults.

Of the 13,262 participants, 1,884 exhibited cognitive impairment over the 14-year follow-up. Estimates are standardized (1–standard deviation change).
A short cognitive battery was administered that included tests of memory (immediate and delayed recall), serial 7 subtractions, and naming and orientation
from the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status,35 which has shown validity in predicting cognitive impairment.1 Participants were determined to be
cognitively impaired when they received a score of 8 and below (out of 35 points).35
