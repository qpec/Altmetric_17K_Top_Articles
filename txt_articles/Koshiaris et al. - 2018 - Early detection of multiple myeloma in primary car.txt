 INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma is a rare malignancy, 
characterised 
by 
clonal 
proliferation 
of plasma cells. These cells secrete 
immunoglobulins (paraproteins), which can 
lead to plasma hyperviscosity and renal 
damage. Proliferation of plasma cells 
can lead to bone marrow suppression, 
and may cause hypercalcaemia. These 
various features of myeloma give rise to 
different symptoms, such as bone pain from 
direct skeletal involvement, fatigue from 
anaemia, or headache from hyperviscosity. 
Presentation with complications from 
hypercalcaemia or renal failure is also 
common. 
Diagnosis of myeloma is often difficult. 
Patients with myeloma have the longest 
intervals from initial symptom reporting to 
diagnosis of all common cancers, with the 
most consultations in primary care before 
referral.1,2 Longer diagnostic intervals in 
myeloma are associated with more advanced 
disease stages and more complications at 
diagnosis.3,4 Patients who are not referred 
to the appropriate department generally 
experience a longer diagnostic process.5 A 
large proportion of patients are diagnosed 
through emergency presentations, with 
concomitant worse survival.6,7 A recent study 
reported that 77% of all myeloma emergency 
presentations had at least one primary care 
consultation before the emergency and 56% 
of these had at least three.8
This prolonged diagnostic process 
probably represents the non-specific 
nature of myeloma symptoms, with 
positive predictive values for symptoms 
<1%, even in combination.9 Guidance from 
the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) uses an urgent cancer 
threshold for referral of 3%.10 In myeloma, 
symptoms need to be combined with 
abnormal blood results such as full blood 
counts (FBC), calcium, and inflammatory 
markers to reach that threshold. The 
inflammatory markers C-reactive protein 
(CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
(ESR), and plasma viscosity (PV), when 
considered together, have been used for 
diagnosing myeloma but have not been 
reported individually.11–13 
The aims of this study are to identify 
the best inflammatory marker for initial 
investigation of possible myeloma, useful 
blood tests for ruling out symptomatic 
myeloma, and how to distinguish early and 
late features of the disease. Symptoms 
can occur up to 2 years before diagnosis in 
other cancers, but little is known about the 
timing of symptoms and abnormal blood 
test results before diagnosis in myeloma.14,15 
The latter can explain why some features 
have better rule-out properties than others 
as features that manifest very late in the 
diagnosis can be useful for ruling in the 
disease but not as useful for ruling it out.

Abstract
Background
Multiple myeloma is a haematological cancer 
characterised by numerous non-specific 
symptoms leading to diagnostic delay in a large 
proportion of patients.
Aim
To identify which blood tests are useful 
in suggesting or excluding a diagnosis of 
myeloma.
Design and setting
A matched case–control study set in UK 
primary care using routinely collected data from 
the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. 
Method
Symptom prevalence and blood tests were 
analysed up to 5 years before diagnosis in 2703 
cases and 12 157 matched controls. Likelihood 
ratios (LR) were used to classify tests or their 
combinations as useful rule-in tests (LR+ = ≥5), 
or rule-out tests (LR– = ≤0.2). 
Results
Raised plasma viscosity (PV) had an LR+ = 2.0, 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7 to 2.3; 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 1.9, 
95% CI = 1.7 to 2.0; and C-reactive protein 
(CRP) 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.4. A normal 
haemoglobin had an LR– = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.39 
to 0.45; calcium LR– = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.78 to 
0.83; and creatinine LR– = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.77 to 
0.83. The test combination with the lowest LR– 
was all normal haemoglobin with calcium and 
PV, which had an LR– = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.02 to 
0.18, though the LR– for normal haemoglobin 
and PV together was 0.12 (95% CI = 0.07 to 
0.23). 
Conclusion
Plasma viscosity and ESR are better for both 
ruling in and ruling out the disease compared 
with C-reactive protein. A combination of a 
normal ESR or PV and normal haemoglobin 
is a simple rule-out approach for patients 
currently being tested in primary care.

Early detection of multiple myeloma in primary 
care using blood tests:
a case–control study in primary care
e586  British Journal of General Practice, September 2018 
 METHOD 
Study design 
This is an extension of a 2015 study that 
quantified the risk of multiple myeloma 
from symptoms reported in primary care 
using records from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CRPD).9 Briefly, the 
study had a case-control design with 2703 
cases and 12 157 matched controls based 
on age, sex, and general practice. Cases 
were selected if patients were >40 years 
of age with a myeloma diagnosis between 
January 2000 and December 2009. Date 
of diagnosis was defined as the first 
myeloma Read code, which was also used 
as the index date for the controls. Exclusion 
criteria included cases or controls with 
<1 year of records, cases without controls, 
controls with myeloma, and controls that 
did not seek medical care after registration. 
The study identified eleven symptoms (back 
pain, chest pain, chest infections, shortness 
of breath, nausea, fracture, joint pain, bone 
pain, weight loss, rib pain, and nosebleed) 
and five abnormal blood investigations 
associated with myeloma (cytopenia, raised 
inflammatory markers, raised creatinine, 
raised mean corpuscular volume, and 
hypercalcaemia). 
Variable definitions 
Symptoms 
and 
investigations 
were 
identified using libraries of Read codes. 
Abnormal blood test results were defined as 
results above or below the local laboratory’s 
normal range. Implausible test values were 
excluded. Combinations of blood tests, 
such as FBC and calcium, were defined as 
positive if at least one of the test results was 
abnormal. For the combination to be defined 
as negative, all tests in the combination were 
required to be normal. For the FBC, which 
has multiple constituent parts, for example, 
white cell count (WCC), haemoglobin, and 
platelets, a result was defined abnormal if 
at least one of the parts indicated cytopenia 
(low haemoglobin, WCC, or platelets).
Analysis
Symptom prevalence and blood tests 
were analysed up to 5 years before 
diagnosis. Each inflammatory marker was 
examined separately using conditional 
logistic regression in order to examine 
its association with myeloma compared 
with matched controls, its predictive 
performance was quantified using positive 
likelihood ratios (LR+). To identify the best 
combinations for ruling out myeloma, 
the negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 
estimated for each test individually and 
in combination. Positive likelihood tests 
indicate how many times more likely a 
positive test occurs in individuals with the 
disease compared with individuals without 
the disease, and negative likelihood tests 
represent how much less likely a negative 
result will occur in individuals with the 
disease compared with a healthy individual. 
A useful rule-in test was defined as one 
with an LR+ >5 and a useful rule-out test 
one with an LR– <0.2.16,17 
Each combination included a different 
inflammatory marker. The constituent 
parts of the FBC were examined either 
separately or altogether
. The analysis was 
restricted to patients who had been tested 
or had a combination of tests. 
To examine when symptoms and 
investigations start to indicate symptomatic 
myeloma and to distinguish between the 
early and late features, the 5-year period 
before diagnosis was broken down into 
90-day intervals, and symptom occurrence 
and blood test results in these periods 
were identified. The results for each 
90-day interval were summarised using 
proportions for binary variables (symptoms) 
and means for continuous variables (blood 
test results). 
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the population 
under investigation can be found in the 
original report,9 but, briefly, total number 
of patients was the same as the 2015 
study, N = 14 860, and the median age was 
73 years with 53% being male.
Within the year before diagnosis 55% 
(8221/14 860) participants had at least one 
blood test (either FBC, calcium, creatinine, 
or one of the inflammatory markers) with 
testing being more prevalent in cases (78%, 
How this fits in
Patients with myeloma experience some 
of the longest diagnostic intervals, which 
could be due to the non–specific nature 
of their symptoms. The results of this 
study suggest that the best inflammatory 
markers to supplement symptoms 
of myeloma are plasma viscosity and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while 
C-reactive protein is unhelpful. In addition, 
the combination of a normal haemoglobin 
and plasma viscosity can be used to rule 
out the disease on patients currently 
being tested in primary care. These 
results further demonstrate that the full 
blood count components and especially 
low haemoglobin are among the earliest 
presentations of the disease, which may 
allow the diagnosis to be expedited.

 2097/2703) compared to controls (50%, 
6124/12 157). The most common tests were 
creatinine (50%, 7407/14 860) and FBC 
(40%, 5934/14 860); the least common test 
was calcium (19%, 2809/14 860). Among the 
inflammatory markers the most common 
tests included ESR, followed by CRP and 
PV. The most common test combination 
was FBC with creatinine and ESR (13%, 
(1864/14 860).
At 3 years before diagnosis, 84% 
(2270/2703) of patients with myeloma had 
at least one blood test compared with 
66% (8058/12 157) in the controls, and at 
5 years before diagnosis 85% (2307/2703) 
of the cases had a test compared with 70% 
(8524/12 157) of the controls.
Rule-in tests
Associations between raised inflammatory 
markers and a myeloma diagnosis are 
shown on Table 1. During the year before 
diagnosis 85% (844) of patients with myeloma 
had an abnormal ESR compared with 
46% (546) of controls (odds ratio [OR] 5.7; 
95% CI = 4.1 to 8.0; P<0.001; LR+ 1.9, 95% 
CI = 1.7 to 2.0), 81% (162) had an abnormal 
PV compared with 41% (95) of controls (OR 
4.4; 95% CI = 2.2 to 8.8; P<0.001; LR+ 2.0, 
95% CI = 1.7 to 2.3), and 46% (294) had an 
abnormal CRP compared with 37% (238) 
of controls (OR 1.5; 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.2; 
P = 0.05; LR+ 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.4). The 
rule-in properties for the rest of the tests that 
are published in the original report included 
cytopenia (OR 5.4, 95% CI = 4.6 to 6.4), raised 
creatinine (OR 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.2), raised 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (OR 3.1, 
95% CI = 2.1 to 4.1), and hypercalcaemia 
(OR 11.4, 95% CI = 7.1 to 18).
Rule-out tests
No single blood test was able to rule out 
myeloma (Table 2), though confidence 
intervals for each marker approached the 
pre-specified cut-off of LR 0.2. A normal 
haemoglobin performed much better as 
a rule-out test (LR– 0.42, 95% CI = 0.39 to 
0.45) compared with calcium (LR– 0.81, 
95% CI = 0.78 to 0.83) and creatinine 
(LR– 0.80, 95% CI = 0.77 to 0.83). For 
inflammatory markers, the best ones for 
ruling out the disease were ESR (LR–  0.28, 
95% CI = 0.24 to 0.33) and PV (LR–  0.32, 
95% CI = 0.24 to 0.44). Ruling out is achieved 
by most of the test combinations, with 
the lowest LR– being when haemoglobin, 
calcium, and PV are all normal (LR– 0.06, 
95% CI = 0.02 to 0.19). For two test 
combinations the lowest LR- was achieved 
by normal haemoglobin and normal PV 
(LR- 0.12, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.23). Details of 
negative likelihood ratios for when whole 
FBC is used are available from authors upon 
request, but results were very similar to 
using just haemoglobin. A table illustrating 
how the post-test probability is affected 
depending on the background prevalence 
and the estimate of the likelihood ratio is 
also available from the authors.
Timing of symptoms and investigations
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the mean values for 
blood tests for each 3-month period in the 
5 years leading up to the date of myeloma 
diagnosis. In patients with myeloma, but 
not in control patients, haemoglobin values 
started to decrease approximately 3 years 
before diagnosis in both males and females, 
and the mean haemoglobin value met the 
WHO criteria for anaemia throughout the 
final 24 months in males (13 g/dL) and 
final 15 months for females (12 g/dL).18 
Mean corpuscular volume started to rise 
approximately 1.5 years before diagnosis, 
though the increase was minor
. WCC and 
platelets remained stable and within the 
normal range at all time points. The mean 
calcium and creatinine values rose rapidly 
in the last 3–6 months before diagnosis. 
ESR and PV values started to increase 
at approximately 2 years before diagnosis. 
Importantly, CRP showed no difference 
between cases and controls at any point.

 Some symptoms, back pain, rib pain, 
chest infections, chest pain, and nosebleed, 
become more common in patients with 
myeloma compared with controls at 
approximately 2 years before diagnosis 
(result figures for symptoms are available 
from the authors). Symptoms suggesting 
advanced disease, such as fractures, weight 
loss, and nausea, are more common up to 
1 year before diagnosis, especially within 
the last 3 months. 
DISCUSSION
Summary
Myeloma is a difficult disease to identify, 
especially in its early stages. The combined 
use of FBC, ESR, or PV and calcium in 
certain cases on patients currently being 
tested in primary care appears to be 
sufficient to select those who may have the 
disease. Those with test abnormalities can 
proceed to more specific primary care blood 
testing, and if these tests are abnormal they 
warrant haematology expertise. In contrast, 
if the initial tests are normal, myeloma, 
which was unlikely in the first place, as it 
is so rare, becomes extremely unlikely, and 
another cause should be sought for the 
patient’s symptoms. 
This study demonstrates that ESR and 
PV have better diagnostic performance 
for myeloma, both as rule-in tests when 
abnormal, and rule-out tests when normal 
in contrast to CRP, which has very little 
value in myeloma diagnosis. Both calcium 
and creatinine rise before a diagnosis 
of myeloma, but a negative calcium or 
creatinine result alone should not be used 
to rule it out because they only start to rise 
late in the disease process. Conversely, 
haemoglobin starts to decline much earlier, 
subsequently making the FBC a more 
useful rule-out test. In the year before 
diagnosis, 95% of patients with myeloma 
having PV and FBC tests have at least 
one abnormality (95% CI = 90 to 97%). In 
practical terms, the combination of normal 
ESR or PV and normal haemoglobin can 
be used to rule out myeloma in patients 
presenting with symptoms potentially 
associated with myeloma, such as back 
pain. Non-specific symptoms occur up to 
2 years before diagnosis, with more specific 
symptoms occurring in the last year before 
diagnosis.

generalisability of the results. Limitations 
include 
potential 
overestimation 
of 
diagnostic accuracy measures with the 
case-control design.19 Another limitation 
is missing data, as not all patients have 
been tested. If patients who have been 
tested differ systematically from those who 
were not tested with respect to the test 
(one potential reason might be that sicker 
patients are more likely to be tested), this 
may lead to under- or overestimation of 
the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood 
ratios reported here. The authors, therefore, 
suggest exercising caution in extrapolating 
their findings to patients not currently being 
tested in primary care. As with most clinical

 databases, there will be some under-
reporting or under-recording of symptoms, 
which can influence association measures.20
Comparison with existing literature 
A Scandinavian study of 167 blood donors 
who developed myeloma has previously 
identified declining haemoglobin for 3 years 
before diagnosis, similar to the results 
presented here.21 No similar reports could 
be found for the timing of hypercalcaemia 
or reduced kidney function, though 
hypercalcaemia is common in patients with 
advanced cancer stages.22 Similarly, no 
reports in which myeloma symptoms were 
investigated over time could be found. 
NICE guidelines currently recommend 
the use of PV or ESR when myeloma is 
suspected.23 Results from this current study 
strongly support this recommendation. ESR 
has been reported as a good prognostic 
marker for myeloma with higher values of 
ESR associated with a more advanced cancer 
stage.24 In contrast, CRP is not useful as an 
initial investigation if myeloma is suspected: 
previous reports have concentrated on its 
use in prognosis rather than diagnosis. 25,26
Implications for practice 
Myeloma diagnosis could potentially be 
expedited by the use of simple blood tests 
in patients with back pain, rib pain, chest 
pain, and recurrent chest infections, which 
have been identified as early presentations 
of myeloma. With a sensitivity value ≥93% of 
normal haemoglobin and an inflammatory 
marker (PV or ESR), the possibility of 
myeloma is extremely low. Adding CRP or 
creatinine adds little additional sensitivity. 
Conversely, in a patient reporting relevant 
symptoms, with abnormalities in one of these 
two tests, it is reasonable for the clinician

 to request protein electrophoresis and 
urinary Bence Jones protein tests urgently. 
This should expedite myeloma diagnosis, 
without increasing haematology referrals. 
Hypercalcaemia is a high-risk marker of 
possible myeloma. Normal calcium levels 
do not make myeloma sufficiently less likely 
for calcium to be used as a safe ‘rule-
out’ test alone. This represents the fact 
that hypercalcaemia and reduced renal 
function are late features of the disease. 
The researchers recommend the addition 
of calcium tests in the above combination 
in the presence of certain symptoms like 
back pain, rib pain, joint pain, and fracture, 
which have a relatively high rule-in potential 
(PPV >10%) when combined with abnormal 
calcium.9 
Other symptoms appear to represent 
more advanced disease, and thus are only 
reported late in its course. Nausea is one of 
these, possibly arising from hypercalcaemia 
or kidney failure; similarly, breathlessness 
may relate to severe anaemia; and weight 
loss may suggest advanced multifocal 
disease. 
It would be possible to integrate a system 
within the electronic health record that 
identifies relevant symptoms or changes 
in blood parameters over time to alert 
the clinician to the (small) possibility of 
myeloma.27 Patients identified in this way 
could be tested with PV or ESR, FBC, and 
calcium in some cases; if these tests were 
normal, myeloma could be ruled out.
