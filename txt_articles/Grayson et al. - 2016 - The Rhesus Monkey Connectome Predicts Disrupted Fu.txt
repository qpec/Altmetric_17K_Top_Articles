In Brief
Grayson et al. (2016) show that
inactivating a single region, the
amygdala, disrupts communication
throughout the cortex and alters global
brain network behavior. Simulated
amygdala lesions produced similar
network effects, suggesting that focal
neuropathology can be inferred from
distributed brain activity.

SUMMARY
Contemporary research suggests that the mamma-
lian brain is a complex system, implying that damage
to even a single functional area could have wide-
spread consequences across the system. To test
this hypothesis, we pharmacogenetically inactivated
the rhesus monkey amygdala, a subcortical region
with distributed and well-defined cortical connectiv-
ity. We then examined the impact of that perturbation
on global network organization using resting-state
functional connectivity MRI. Amygdala inactivation
disrupted
amygdalocortical
communication
and
distributed corticocortical coupling across multiple
functional brain systems. Altered coupling was ex-
plained using a graph-based analysis of experimen-
tally established structural connectivity to simulate
disconnection of the amygdala. Communication ca-
pacity via monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways,
in aggregate, largely accounted for the correlational
structure of endogenous brain activity and many of
the non-local changes that resulted from amygdala
inactivation. These results highlight the structural
basis of distributed neural activity and suggest a
strategy for linking focal neuropathology to remote
neurophysiological changes.
INTRODUCTION
Modern neuroscience continues to shift its focus from an
emphasis on the function of individual brain regions toward
understanding brain function in terms of complex network dy-
namics. Functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging methods,
which measure the temporally correlated nature of activity in
different brain regions, are now being exploited to understand
how large-scale network-level activity associated with healthy
cognition is impacted by brain injury (Fornito et al., 2015) and
neurodegeneration (Seeley et al., 2009). Lesion-induced func-
tional pathology frequently manifests in a distributed and com-
plex manner (Gratton et al., 2012; He et al., 2007), and the pre-
cise relationship between function and structure at the network
level is incompletely understood. Consequently, establishing
a framework to relate disorders of brain communication to spe-
cific neuroanatomical underpinnings remains a critical and unre-
solved challenge.
The analysis of how anatomical connectivity supports func-
tional interactions between distinct brain areas has emerged
as a fertile area of research (Honey et al., 2009; Miranda-Domi-
nguez et al., 2014). It is now evident that correlations in sponta-
neous activity measured via resting-state functional connectivity
MRI (rs-fcMRI) can be reasonably well predicted in the healthy
brain with knowledge of the mono- and polysynaptic pathways
between regions and the manner in which those pathways are
topologically embedded within the whole-brain network (Gon
˜ i
et al., 2014). Multiple related approaches at modeling FC from
whole-brain structural connectivity (SC) have recently been vali-
dated in healthy human brains (Hansen et al., 2015; Messe
´ et al.,
2014). These advances raise the possibility that complex, global
disturbances in function might quantitatively predict focal brain
pathology underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Despite theoretical support for this view (Alstott et al., 2009; Hon-
ey and Sporns, 2008), structurally based models of FC have not
yet been validated through experimental perturbations.
The advent of designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs) provides a new, minimally invasive

 means to manipulate brain activity in vivo (Armbruster et al.,
2007; Eldridge et al., 2016; Michaelides et al., 2013). DREADDs
provide systemic pharmacological modulation of specific neuro-
anatomical circuits, allowing the influence of local circuit activity
on global functional network organization to be revealed.
Furthermore, DREADDs provide an avenue to empirically re-
examine the relationship between structural and functional con-
nectivity. As part of a long-term research program investigating
the structure and function of the nonhuman primate amygdala,
this study was carried out to examine functional imaging conse-
quences of transiently inhibiting the amygdala. We used the
inhibitory DREADD hM4Di (Armbruster et al., 2007) in a cohort
of rhesus macaque monkeys and assessed changes in distrib-
uted region-to-region communication using rs-fcMRI.
We hypothesized that DREADD-induced transient deactiva-
tion of the amygdala would degrade FC between the amygdala
and areas that anatomically connect strongly and reciprocally
with the amygdala, particularly the medial and orbital prefrontal
cortices, the cingulate cortex, and the temporal lobe (Amaral
and Price, 1984; Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002). Given that there
might be variable expression of the hM4Di receptor across ani-
mals, we hypothesized that the magnitude of FC disruption in
each animal would correlate with the number of amygdala neu-
rons that demonstrated DREADD expression. Due to the depen-
dence of FC on polysynaptic communication, it was also hypoth-
esized that FC would change within the distributed systems
in which these cortical regions participate. We report on a
previously established graph analytic measure, communicability
(Crofts and Higham, 2009; Estrada and Hatano, 2008), as a
means for approximating FC in the primate brain. We apply
this measure to a previously published SC dataset representing
a collation of experimental literature of tract-tracing studies (Bez-
gin et al., 2012), in order to assess whether simulated structural
lesions of the amygdala could explain empirical FC changes
across the connectome.
RESULTS
An overview of experimental procedures is provided in Figure 1.
Distribution of DREADD Expression
The amygdala was transfected bilaterally with the inhibitory G
protein coupled hM4Di receptor containing a pan-neuronal syn-
apsin promoter. Immunoreactivity of the mCherry reporter pro-
tein was carried out to identify the locations of transfected neu-
rons (Figure 2 and see Figure S1 available online). Stereological
analyses confirmed substantial populations of transfected cell
bodies within the amygdala bilaterally in all cases, although there

(A) First, the amygdala (labeled in red) was trans-
fected with a viral vector construct containing the
inhibitory DREADD gene hM4Di. The DREADD
ligand, CNO, selectively deactivates DREADD-
transfected cells when administered peripherally.
(B) Second, rs-fcMRI scans were acquired on each
animal 6–12 months later. One scan was acquired
using CNO injection i.v. and the other with saline
i.v. Scans are divided into five consecutive 12 min
blocks with injections performed between the first
and second block.
(C) Third, functional connectomes are built for each
block using the RM parcellation scheme. Con-
nectomes comprise pairwise Pearson correlations
(z-transformed) between time series of all region
pairs, illustrated as a whole-brain network. This
allows assessment of baseline functional connec-
tivity (FC) or FC change due to CNO injection
relative to saline (DFC).

 was considerable variability in the number of labeled neurons
and in their distribution across amygdala subnuclei from case
to case (see Tables S1 and S2 and Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). We also observed substantial labeling of monosyn-
aptic anterograde projections and almost no retrograde labeling
(with the exception of the rostral entorhinal cortex), indicating
little or no transynaptic spread of mCherry (see Figure S1 and
Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
MRI Analysis of Amygdala Functional Connectivity
Four

macaques
were

anesthetized
and
scanned using a 60 min, iron contrast-enhanced functional
sequence divided into five blocks lasting 11.7 min. The synthetic
DREADD-activating ligand Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO, 10 mg/kg)
or saline was administered after the first block (the baseline). At
baseline, the amygdala demonstrated significant FC (z-trans-
formed correlations of temporal activity) with numerous cortical
and subcortical areas (Figure 3A). The cortical and subcortical
FC patterns are in general agreement with the known patterns
of neuroanatomical connectivity in the macaque monkey
amygdala (Amaral and Price, 1984). The strongest cortical
FC appeared in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortices
(vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortices, and throughout the tempo-
ral cortices. Strong FC also appeared in the frontal polar cortex,
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and ventral portions of the insula.
Weaker, but significant, connectivity was observed in the poste-

rior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex,
and medial parietal cortex. In subcortical
areas, strong FC appeared in the nucleus
accumbens (NAcc), head of the caudate
nucleus, midline thalamus, hypothalamus,
and midbrain. Overall, FC was substan-
tially bilateral for both left and right amygdala and was strongly
homotopic.
Given the lack of background parametric data on DREADD
alterations of brain activity in the primate brain, we first evalu-
ated the time course and spatial extent of FC changes resulting
from DREADD inactivation of the amygdala. Administration of
CNO versus saline significantly reduced amygdala FC in all
post-injection blocks (Z > 2.3, cluster-corrected p < 0.05; Fig-
ures 3B–3E). No consistent increases occurred. Reduced FC
appeared in most cortical areas showing positive baseline
connectivity, but was seen most consistently in the vmPFC,
subgenual cingulate cortex (CCs), inferior temporal cortex
(TCi), superior temporal sulcus (TCc), and NAcc. Reduced
subcortical FC was also apparent in the caudate nucleus and
thalamus. Across all blocks, changes were noticeably stronger
for the left amygdala than the right. This was likely a conse-
quence of the generally higher number of transfected neurons
in the left amygdala compared to the right side (see Figures
4B and 4C and Table S1).
Figure 4 shows the association between FC changes in the
amygdala and post-mortem DREADD immunoreactivity. For
reference, the known anatomical connectivity of the amygdala
(collated in Bezgin et al., 2012) is shown in 4A. To reduce statis-
tical noise, post-injection blocks were collapsed together and
compared against baseline. For each subject, and within each
hemisphere separately, changes in amygdala FC due to CNO

 or saline injection (DFC-amyg) were averaged across regions
of interest (ROIs) with known amygdala SC. Averaged DFC-
amyg correlated negatively with the estimated population of
DREADD-transfected cells after CNO (r = �0.87, p = 0.005),
but not after saline (r = �0.32, p = 0.44). A weaker but significant
negative association was also detected using DFC-amyg
averaged over ROIs without amygdala SC (CNO: r = �0.77,
p = 0.025; saline: r = �0.23, p = 0.58). In summary, greater
numbers of DREADD-transfected cells in the amygdala were
associated with more substantial degradation of FC between
the amygdala and regions with which it is, or is not, monosynap-
tically connected.

Network Connectivity Changes
We next assessed the effects of amyg-
dala inactivation across the brain, within
the context of the brain’s modular organi-
zation (Figure 5). Modules are defined as
partitions of the whole-brain network
that maximize the within-module connec-
tivity, providing a view of the brain’s
intrinsic functional organization. At base-
line, seven modules were identified (see
Experimental Procedures), including the
limbic (orange), default mode (red), visual
(blue), dorsal attention (green), insular/
opercular (pink), auditory (yellow), and so-
matomotor (cyan) (Figure 5A). The limbic
module included the amygdala, PFCoi,
PFCol, TCpol, and TCi. As community
detection is non-deterministic, we repli-
cated all modularity-based results using
an alternative modularity algorithm (see
Experimental Procedures). The alterna-
tive partition is highly similar (variation of
information = 0.174) and implies a strong
functional relationship between the limbic
and default mode modules, and between
the somatomotor and dorsal attention
modules (see Figure S2).
In order to distinguish between network
effects
that
were
topologically
near
versus distant from the amygdala, ana-
lyses were stratified according to modules with high versus
low baseline amygdalar FC. The amygdala was functionally con-
nected most strongly to other nodes in the limbic module and in
the default mode module, while it was most weakly connected
with somatomotor nodes (Figures 5B and S2B). In the limbic
and default mode modules, FC decreased between regions
such as the medial prefrontal cortices (PFCm, PFCdm) and orbi-
tofrontal cortices (PFCom, PFCol, PFCoi), CCs, CCr, TCi, TCc,
and TCpol (Z < �2.6 for each edge, FDR-corrected p = 0.031;
see also Figure S2). No significant increase in FC (Z > 2.6) was
found in these modules. On the other hand, FC increased be-
tween somatomotor nodes, particularly S1 and M1 (Z > 2.6 for
456

 each edge, FDR-corrected p = 0.011; see also Figure S2), while
no decreased FC (Z < �2.6) was found.
For additional validation, all FC changes jZj>2.6 (p < 0.01
uncorrected) are shown in Figure S3 unrestricted by modules
and uncorrected for multiple comparisons across edges. The
network of reduced FC was almost entirely contiguous and high-
lighted the left amygdala as the crucial hub. The nodes in this
network overlapped significantly with the known anatomical
connections of the amygdala (c2(1) = 8.14, p = 0.0043), while so-
matomotor nodes showed the largest increase in FC. Without
statistical thresholding, the left amygdala exhibited the most
substantial change in correlation values pre-inactivation versus
post-inactivation relative to all other nodes (see Supplemental
Information).
Brain-wide Visualizations
Qualitative observations in the graph visualizations seen in Fig-
ure 6 are reflective of statistical effects and provide additional
context. Examining the block graphs in Figures 6A and 6B,
reduced FC was most extreme within the limbic module, though
it was also apparent between the limbic and default mode
modules and within the default mode. Increased FC was most
apparent within the somatomotor module.
Force-directed graph layouts (Figures 6C–6F) highlight more
regionally specific effects. At baseline (Figure 6C), the amygdala
is attached to the CCs (default mode), TCpol (limbic), and PFCoi
(limbic). The TCpol and PFCoi have the strongest baseline amyg-
dala FC (0.821 and 0.788, respectively). After amygdala inactiva-
tion, the amygdala decouples from the network (Figure 6D),
highlighting that the bilateral amygdala (and particularly the
left) are central to the changes observed. The TCpol and PFCoi
also noticeably decouple (Figures 6E and 6F; see statistical
effects in Figures 5, S2, and S3).
The weak FC between the limbic and somatomotor modules
(Figure 6A), particularly between the amygdala and somatomo-
tor nodes (Figure 5B), is reflected in their topological distance
in the baseline graph layout (Figure 6C). Increased somatomo-
tor FC post-inactivation (statistical effects in Figures 5, S2,
and S3) is seen as denser clustering of somatomotor nodes
post-inactivation versus pre-inactivation (Figure 6D versus Fig-
ure 6C, and Figure 6F versus Figure 6E). S1 has the weakest
amygdala FC of all nodes (0.053) and shows the largest in-
crease in FC (Figure S3), which mirrors effects seen in Figures
6C and 6D.
Structure-Function Relationships
Overview
We investigated the relationship between structural and func-
tional brain connectivity using graph-based metrics of mutual
communication. The initial goal was to establish whether FC be-
tween a given pair of regions in the baseline functional network
was associated with their topological position within a corre-
sponding structural connection (SC) matrix. After this initial vali-
dation, we tested whether FC changes due to amygdala inacti-
vation could be explained by simulated structural lesion of
the amygdala. We use an ‘‘unenhanced’’ tract-tracer (TTu) matrix
for SC, representing a collation of experimentally established
neuroanatomical connections from the CoCoMac database
(see Stephan et al., 2001 and Bezgin et al., 2012), between the
80 ROIs used in the current study. Connection weights in the
TTu take values of 0 (non-existent), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3
(strong). We also use an ‘‘enhanced’’ version of this matrix
(denoted TTx), produced in a recent study that optimized the
simulation of BOLD FC by iteratively reweighting the TTu links
to be more continuous and exponentially distributed (for details,
see Deco et al., 2014).
Baseline FC
In order to establish a biologically plausible link between struc-
tural and functional connectivity, we consider the communica-
bility metric (Estrada and Hatano, 2008) as a proxy for FC.
Communicability (denoted G) is a graph theoretic measure that
describes the ‘‘ease of communication’’ between two regions

 across the combination of direct (i.e., monosynaptic) and all
indirect (i.e., polysynaptic) structural pathways. G takes the
weighted sum of these pathways where shorter paths with stron-
ger connections are weighted more heavily (see Supplemental
Information for calculations). It was hypothesized that G would
strongly correlate with FC, implying a structural basis for endog-
enously coupled activity.
Figure S4 shows the relationship between within-hemisphere
G and baseline FC. G and FC were strongly correlated across
amygdalocortical ROI pairs (r = 0.737, p < 10�6, 95% CI [0.55,
0.854] for TTx; r = 0.613, p < 10�4, 95% CI [0.369, 0.778] for
TTu; p values estimated at 10�6 max precision) and across all
corticocortical ROI pairs (r = 0.6, p < 10�6, 95% CI [0.552,
0.645] for TTx; r = 0.523, p < 10�6, 95% CI [0.469, 0.574] for
TTu). Correlations were driven by the inclusion of walk lengths
between 1 and 3 in the communicability metric (Figures S4,
S5A, and S5B). Other predictors (e.g., shortest path length,
Euclidean distance between ROI centroids) were tested and
described in Table S3. A multiple linear regression model pre-
dicting FC using (1) TTx communicability, (2) TTu communica-
bility, and (3) Euclidean distance, as joint predictors, demon-
strated that TTx contributed most to model performance, while
Euclidean distance contributed minimally (see Supplemental
Information).
FC Changes
We next sought to explain empirical FC changes (DFC) due to
DREADD inactivation of the amygdala through simulated discon-
nection of the amygdala in the SC networks. Specifically, we
tested whether simulated changes in G would correlate with
the distributed functional changes observed after DREADD inac-
tivation. In concrete terms, this hypothesis assumes that loss of
signal spread through monosynaptic and polysynaptic amygda-
locortical pathways can account for the primary changes
observed (i.e., amygdalocortical DFC). It is assumed that loss
of signal spread through the polysynaptic cortico-amygdalo-
cortical links can account for the secondary changes observed
(i.e., corticocortical DFC).
Simulated lesion of the amygdala produced DSC-communica-
bility (DG) values that correlated strongly with DFC across within-
hemisphere amygdalocortical ROI pairs (r = 0.696, p < 10�6,
95% CI [0.488, 0.829] for TTx; r = 0.647, p < 10�5, 95% CI
[0.416, 0.799] for TTu) and moderately strongly across within-
hemisphere corticocortical ROI pairs (r = 0.456, p < 10�6, 95%
CI [0.397, 0.512] for TTx; r = 0.427, p < 10�6, 95% CI [0.367,

up to, but not greater than, 4 or 5 in the
communicability metric (Figures 7C and
7D, S5C and S5D, and S6C and S6D).
Correlations across both hemispheres
and within individual hemispheres are
listed in Table S4. Qualitatively, simulated
DG and empirical DFC show notable sim-
ilarities with regard to the topological
alterations to functional modules. For
instance, amygdalocortical G and FC
are both disrupted most prominently
within the limbic and default mode modules (Figure 7E), while
amygdala-somatomotor interaction is least impacted. The stron-
gest negative changes to corticocortical G and FC both occur

 within the limbic and default mode modules (Figure 7F). Cortico-
cortical G appears to be least affected among the somatomotor
nodes, coinciding with increased FC.
Lesions were then simulated for each cortical ROI separately
in order to examine the specificity of DG-DFC correlations.
Results are shown for the TTx in Figures 7G and 7H and for the
TTu in Figures S6E and S6F. Across primary region pairs (i.e.,
those including the lesioned region), lesions of the amygdala in
the TTx produced stronger correlations than did lesions to any
other region. Lesioning the TCpol, to which the amygdala has
substantially more SC than any other region, produced the
next strongest correlation (r = 0.637, p < 10�4). Overall, regions
with the most amygdala SC tended to show the strongest
positive correlations, and regions with the least amygdala SC
produced the most negative correlations. DG-DFC correlations
across secondary region pairs (i.e., those excluding the lesioned
region) were slightly less specific but still show the amygdala and
TCpol (r = 0.446, p < 10�6) as the second and third best predic-
tors in the TTx, respectively. The subgenual cingulate (CCs),
which is topologically quite close to the amygdala (Figure 6D),
had the strongest correlation (r = 0.522, p < 10�6). The overall
trend relating each region’s amygdala SC to the strength of
DFC prediction was maintained as well. Simulated lesions in
the TTu connectome also gave similar top rankings (Figures
S6E and S6F). Overall, these results demonstrate that simulated
disconnection of the amygdala, and its topologically closest
neighbors, is substantially associated with FC changes.
Changes in nodal signal variance and pairwise covariance are
additional ways to examine the impacts of inactivation, by taking
into account changes in the amplitude of signal fluctuations.
To relate changes in variance to simulated amygdala lesions,
we computed the total change in each region’s input G (DGinput),
which can be calculated separately from output G since SC
weights are directed. Figures 8A–8C, S6G, and S6H show that
alterations in variance were both positive and negative but signif-
icantly correlated with DGinput (using raw Dvariance: r = 0.461, p <
0.005 for TTx and r = 0.443, p < 0.01 for TTu; using %Dvariance:
r = 0.757, p < 10�6 for TTx and r = 0.627, p < 10�4 for TTu). Next,
we examined covariance as an alternative measure of coupling.
Figures 8D, 8E, S6I, and S6J show that changes in covariance
networks had even higher correlations with DG than did changes
in correlation-only (i.e., FC) networks. For amygdalocortical
pairs, DG-Dcovariance correlations were r = 0.719, 95% CI
[0.522, 0.843] for TTx, and r = 0.695, 95% CI [0.486, 0.829] for
TTu (both p < 10�6). For corticocortical pairs, correlations were
r = 0.547, 95% CI [0.495, 0.596] for TTx, and r = 0.517, 95% CI
[0.462, 0.568] for TTu (both p < 10�6). DG-Dcovariance correla-
tions were also specific to the amygdala and TCpol lesions
(Figures 8F and 8G for TTx and Figures S6K and S6L for TTu).
In the TTx, the TCpol and amygdala lesions were the top two

 predictors of primary effects; the TCpol, TCi, and amygdala
were the top three predictors of secondary effects (all p <
10�6). In the TTu, the amygdala was the top predictor of both
primary and secondary effects, followed by the TCpol and TCv
(all p < 10�6). These results emphasize that changes in signal
amplitude are also associated with simulated lesions and are
concomitant with positive and negative changes in coupling.
DISCUSSION
The present study has achieved two fundamental and novel
goals. First, we combined a focal DREADD manipulation with
rs-fcMRI to identify changes in local and global network organi-
zation in vivo. The integration of these experimental tools carries
significant potential for basic comparative neuroscience and
translational research. Rs-fcMRI has been widely applied to
study large-scale distributed networks in humans and homolo-
gous networks in the macaque (Grayson et al., 2014; Hutchison
and Everling, 2012; Miranda-Dominguez et al., 2014). DREADDs
offer the ability to measure the influence of specific circuits on
network organization, and on behavior, without the restriction
of chronic implants or the complications arising from lesion-
induced compensatory changes.
Second, a novel application of graph theory was used to link
structure and function in order to explain baseline FC patterns
and distributed FC disruptions. These findings provide a proof
of principle regarding the potential to reverse engineer patholog-
ical features of neuroanatomical circuitry from resting-state
functional networks.
Amygdala Functional Connectivity
We have first delineated an amygdalocentric FC map with
detailed spatial specificity, whichagrees strongly with the primate
amygdala’s known pattern of extrinsic anatomical connectivity to
cortical (Aggleton et al., 1980; Amaral and Price, 1984; Stefanacci
and Amaral, 2002) and subcortical (Mehler, 1980; Russchen et al.,
1985) regions. Anatomically, the primate amygdala connects
extensively throughout the temporal cortex in a high-to-low
gradient along the rostral-to-caudal direction. The amygdala
also connects with medial and ventral prefrontal cortices, with
anterior cingulate cortices, and with anterior and ventral insular
cortices (Aggleton et al., 1980; Amaral and Price, 1984; Stefa-
nacci and Amaral, 2002). These observations are all reflected in
thedistribution ofFCinthisstudy.Ontheotherhand, theposterior
cingulate, medial parietal, and retrosplenial cortex were also
functionally connected to the amygdala despite evidence against
the existence of direct anatomical linkage (Aggleton et al., 2012;
Amaral and Price, 1984; Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002). These
FC patterns may reflect the presence of indirect structural path-
ways between the amygdala and these areas. The fact that amyg-
dala FC was correlated much more strongly with communicability
(which representsmonosynapticandpolysynapticlinks) than with
monosynaptic SC lends strong support for this view.
DREADD Activation Causes Primary and Secondary
Loss of FC
As expected, activation of the inhibitory DREADD robustly
decreased amygdala FC. In order to understand the effects of
focal disruption, it is necessary to consider not only the primary
loss of neuronal function but also the physiological changes to
regions remote from the damage. For instance, loss of FC be-
tween regions anatomically distinct from the lesion is a frequent
and clinically significant consequence of a variety of stroke and
injury disorders (Carrera and Tononi, 2014; Gratton et al.,
2012), in some cases correlating with behavioral deficits much
more strongly than functional changes in the damaged region it-
self (He et al., 2007). In parallel, structural connectivity studies
demonstrate that communicability helps to identify network al-
terations subsequent to stroke (Crofts and Higham, 2009; Crofts
et al., 2011), emphasizing the importance of lesion-induced
changes in interaction across indirect paths. Existing simulation
studies predict that focal insult should directly cause changes in
function to remote regions which depend sensitively on the
lesion site (Alstott et al., 2009; Honey and Sporns, 2008). The
current study lends empirical support for these predictions
by demonstrating extensive degradation of links between the
medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior
temporal cortices. Critically, functional network changes were
correlated with the effects of simulated amygdala lesion within
the structural connectome, suggesting that losses in corticocort-
ical coupling are linked to losses in indirect communication
mediated via the amygdala. These results corroborate the notion
that focal lesions inhibit the spread of oscillatory activity between
topologically neighboring nodes (Joyce et al., 2013) and offer a
plausible structural basis.
Effects of DREADD Activation on Non-Local Network
Topology
The primate amygdala has been characterized previously as
having low centrality in the context of the brain’s structural con-
nectome (for instance, a relatively small number of the brain’s
shortest paths run through it) (Goulas et al., 2014). These con-
clusions are supported by our functional graph layouts. While
previous studies have ascertained that certain topological fea-
tures of global brain organization are more resilient to damage
inflicted upon nodes that are less central (Gratton et al., 2012;
Joyce et al., 2013), it is nonetheless clear that amygdala inacti-
vation led to large and differential changes in network dy-
namics. The organization of the limbic and default mode mod-
ules fragmented, while FC increased between nodes that
were structurally and functionally distant from the amygdala
(i.e., the somatomotor complex). These data support the long-
standing theory that distributed increases in FC should accom-
pany patterns of degradation due to focal lesions (Alstott et al.,
2009). In the present study, effects can be interpreted in the
light of recent applications of control theory to large-scale brain
networks. Alterations to low-centrality nodes, also known as
modal controllers, are theoretically capable of steering the brain
into difficult-to-reach functional states (Gu et al., 2015). Tran-
sient damage to the amygdala (low centrality) causes differen-
tial effects to distant systems, potentially corroborating such
predictions. More speculatively, given that S1 (also low-central-
ity; Goulas et al., 2014; see also our graph layouts) showed
the largest positive change in FC, it could be that distant low-
centrality nodes exert competing attractive forces on network
dynamics.

 Structure-Function Relationships
Our method of relating structure to function corroborates a
similar report that FC in the human brain is analytically predicted
by a linear combination of communication metrics (Gon
˜ i et al.,
2014). In Gon
˜ i et al., however, FC predictions relied on identifica-
tion of the shortest communication path between node pairs.
The notion that signal flow occurs preferentially along the short-
est path is potentially a tenuous assumption within biological
networks, since regions cannot ‘‘know’’ where to distribute infor-
mation. Communicability, by contrast, makes no assumptions
about the primacy of the shortest path by allowing contributions
from all walks of reasonably short length. In addition, the
directionality of these walks meaningfully influences the metric.
Our observations show a stronger correspondence between
communicability and FC when the directionality of SC is incorpo-
rated, in line with previous structure-function studies (Shen
et al., 2012). Interestingly, FC may also be modulated by
common efferent versus afferent pathways in ways that are
potentially inconsistent with serial relay patterns (Adachi et al.,
2012), which form the basis of the communicability measure.
Thus, there is clearly room for further exploration regarding com-
plex network-level effects that give rise to correlated activity.
One of the most novel aspects of this study was the applica-
tion of communicability toward identifying the loci of inactivation
that best explain functional effects (i.e., the amygdala and
TCpol). Current trends in translational research emphasize the
goal to exploit network FC data in neurological patients with
focal damage in order to predict outcomes (Gratton et al.,
2012; Warren et al., 2014) or pinpoint potential pathways for
targeted intervention (Carrera and Tononi, 2014; Fornito et al.,
2015; He et al., 2007). Demonstrating that accurate deduction
of neuroanatomical connectopathy is achievable opens the
door
for
continued
application
and
development
of
this
approach in multiple contexts of atypical brain function.
Limitations and Future Directions
The present study bridges the gap between functional distur-
bance and circuit-level pathology by simulating lesions at the
level of individual nodes. Several limitations can be stated
about this approach. First, while DREADD injections were fairly
circumscribed to the amygdala, variability of nuclei-specific
transfection could have led to a more heterogeneous pattern of
amygdalocortical disruption than accounted for by node-lesion
simulation. Second, the lack of subcortical SC data, aside from
the amygdala, might also limit the model. Current literature sug-
gests that the best performing predictions of corticocortical FC,
which have generally been based on corticocortical SC alone,
are limited to roughly the strength observed here (0.6 < r < 0.7)
(Gon
˜ i et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2015; Honey et al., 2009; Messe
´
et al., 2014), highlighting the need to evaluate the influence
of subcortical pathways as additional mediators of cortical
coupling. Third, the model used here is not generative in the
sense that brain activity is explicitly simulated. Rather, commu-
nicability is a static measure that appears to provide reasonable
association with FC. In principle, generative models could
be applied to the present data and combined with simulated le-
sions to gain more detailed mechanistic insights via parameter
exploration.
Other limitations concern the construction of the FC networks
themselves. Averaging individual subject matrices together is an
important limitation, since group-averaged matrices can theo-
retically be non-representative of the individual constituents
(Simpson et al., 2012). In addition, the use of anesthesia is
known to alter resting-state FC networks by limiting their ability
to dynamically reconfigure between different states over time
(Barttfeld et al., 2015). Here we have only attempted to describe
static FC patterns, but future experimental research in awake
animals could explore how circuit-level function influences
global temporal dynamics.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee at the University of California, Davis, and carried out at the California
National Primate Research Center (CNPRC).
Subjects
Subjects were four adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) averaging
5.25 years of age (SD = 0.49) and weighing, on average, 9.51 kg (SD = 0.94)
at time of surgery. Prior to surgeries, each subject’s serum was assayed
in the Immunology Core at the University of Pennsylvania and confirmed
negative (below the detectable limit) for the presence of AAV5 neutralizing
antibodies.
Transfection Procedures
The Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provided the
rAAV5/hSyn-hM4D-mCherry vector. Lot AV5373B was used for subjects M1
and M2 at a concentration of 1.3 3 1013 virus molecules per ml. Lot AV5373
was used for M3 and M4, at a concentration of 2.4 3 1012 virus molecules
per ml. Each animal underwent a 3D T1 weighted MRI to determine stereotac-
tic coordinates of the amygdala. Craniotomies were made over the left and
right amygdala, and the vector was injected bilaterally in a cubic matrix of eight
injection sites per hemisphere. Each site received 5 ml of the vector, adminis-
tered using 10 ml Hamilton syringes (26-gauge beveled needles) at a rate of
0.2 ml/min.
Histological Evaluation of Transfection
Animals were sacrificed and perfused on average 356.5 days following
surgery (SD = 28.36). Procedures for perfusions, sectioning, and NissL staining
followed our standard laboratory protocol (see Supplemental Information).
Briefly, coronal sections were cut in seven series at 30 mm. Nissl staining
was performed with thionin. Sections adjacent to the Nissl-stained section
were immunostained using antibodies against mCherry. Avidin-Biotin Block
(Vector Laboratories SP-2001, Burlingame, CA) was used to reduce non-
specific background. Sections were then placed into Primary antiserum
containing 1:1,000 anti-mCherry (Abcam #ab167453; RRID:AB_2571870)
and amplified through diaminobenzidine peroxidase reaction.
The basic description of the morphological characteristics of the amygdala
nuclei have been described in detail previously by Pitka
¨ nen and Amaral (1998)
for the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). We used these descriptions
to determine the boundaries of four main nuclei (lateral, basal, accessory
basal, and central) and of the amygdala in the Macaca mulatta. Boundaries
were determined in the Nissl-stained sections and applied to the adjacent
immunostained sections for stereological sampling. The total number of trans-
fected neurons in each nucleus was estimated using the optical fractionator
method (West et al., 1991).
Imaging Procedures
MR imaging was performed an average of 258 days after transfection (see Ta-
ble S1) on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner with a custom built eight-channel head
coil optimized for monkey brain scanning. Animals were sedated with an initial
dose of ketamine (5 mg/kg), intubated, placed in an MR-compatible stereo-
taxic apparatus, and maintained under 1.3%–1.7% isoflurane. Scanning
Neuron 91, 453–466, July 20, 2016

 included acquisition of a 3D T1-weighted image followed by a 60 min func-
tional scan sequence.
The functional scan was divided into five consecutive analysis blocks, each
lasting 305 frames (11 min, 42 s). Between the first and second block, CNO
(10 mg/kg in a 5 mg/ml solution) was delivered and allowed 1 min to equilibrate.
CNO promotes selective inhibition of hM4Di-expressing cells in the rodent and
rhesus monkey brain (Armbruster et al., 2007; Eldridge et al., 2016; Michae-
lides et al., 2013). Each of the final three blocks began immediately after the
previous. To control for time-dependent changes in signal across blocks,
each animal was scanned again within 2–3 weeks using a saline injection of
equal volume to the prior CNO injection. All other scanning and anesthetic pro-
tocols were maintained.
The raw fMRI data was preprocessed to reduce artifacts and spatially trans-
form ROIs into native fMRI space (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for full details). While we have used global signal regression (GSR) in previous
rs-fcMRI investigations to remove global artifact (Grayson et al., 2014;
Miranda-Dominguez et al., 2014) such as motion effects, the current report rep-
resents a special case. Movement was minimized by the anesthesia and ste-
reotactic head restraint, and exogenous contrast was utilized in order to boost
sensitivity relative to BOLD (see Figure S7). We found that GSR had distinct ef-
fects depending on data acquisition procedures, such that GSR improved
structure-function relationships in standard BOLD acquisitions, but weakened
them in the current dataset (see Figure S8). Thus, GSR was not used in the cur-
rent report, although it is likely recommended in more conventional scenarios
(see Supplemental Information for a full and detailed analysis).
Functional Connectivity Analyses
Amygdala Seed-Based FC
Time series were computed for each scanning block for the left and right
amygdala separately by averaging the time series across all voxels within
the ROI. Pearson correlations (r values) were computed between the ROI
and all other voxels in the brain. The r value at each voxel was Fisher’s z-trans-
formed to yield z values (denoted z) that are theoretically normally distributed
across conditions and across subjects. Statistical significance was computed
using fixed effects (FFX) analyses. For each subject, individual z values were
converted to Z scores by dividing by the square root of the expected variance
(EV; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures regarding calculation of the
EVs). Z scores were combined across subjects using FFX (summed and
divided by the square root of the sample size).
To generate significance maps of baseline amygdala FC, the pre-injection
period (i.e., block 1) of both CNO and Saline conditions were collapsed across
subjects and thresholded at jZ scorej>6, providing sufficient correction for
multiple comparisons across voxels using a stringent Bonferroni correction
(p < 0.001). To test for changes in connectivity due to CNO, the FC maps
(i.e., z values) computed for each post-injection block (2, 3, 4, or 5) were
compared to block 1, and the difference was compared across CNO and sa-
line conditions. Specifically, the contrast [z(post-CNO) – z(pre-CNO)] – [z(post-
Saline) – z(pre-Saline)] was converted to Z scores using FFX. Analysis was
restricted to areas of significantly positive baseline FC, then thresholded at
jZ scorej>2.3 and corrected for cluster size (122 contiguous voxels, p <
0.05; 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations using Gaussian Random Field theory).
Network Connectivity
All cortical ROIs (see Table S5) were predefined with a parcellation of the
rhesus macaque brain known as the regional map (RM) (Bezgin et al., 2012).
The RM consists of 82 regions covering the entire cortical mantle and the
amygdala. In this study, the hippocampus was excluded and the amygdala
was redrawn manually. The RM parcellation is paired with a matching anatom-
ical connectivity matrix collated from the Cocomac database of tract-tracer
(TT) studies (Bezgin et al., 2012).
To assess changes in connectivity across the network, z-transformed
correlations were first computed between all ROI pairs, yielding a unique
80 3 80 symmetric matrix (78 cortical ROIs plus the left and right amygdala)
for each block in each subject. The pre-injection block here was compared
against all post-injection blocks. Specifically, we computed the contrast C =
[z(block2) + z(block3) + z(block4) + z(block5)]/4 – z(block1), for CNO and saline
conditions separately. The final contrast was taken as CCNO – CSaline, denoted
hereafter as DFC. The same contrast was also used to assess changes in the
variance of regional time courses and their pairwise covariances, averaged
across subjects (denoted Dvariance and Dcovariance). DFC was combined
across subjects and tested for significance using FFX analysis.
Community Detection and Graph Layouts
The baseline FC network was obtained by averaging z-transformed correla-
tions across subjects and across block 1 of CNO and saline runs. Modular par-
titions of the network were obtained using the community detection algorithm
for undirected, weighted matrices adapted from Newman (2006) and improved
upon with the additional ‘‘final-tuning’’ algorithm described in Sun et al. (2009).
This algorithm recursively bisects a given adjacency matrix into non-overlap-
ping groups of nodes (communities, or modules) in a way that maximizes
the modularity index, or the fraction of edge weights within module partitions
relative to the expected fraction of such weights in an equivalent randomized
network. Modularity was computed after thresholding the baseline FC matrix
at the minimum connection density that preserved full connectedness (the
ability to traverse from one node to any other node in the network; 28%). How-
ever, due to the increased interest in studying fully weighted networks we also
repeated all modularity-based analyses on the unthresholded network using a
community detection algorithm for weighted, signed matrices (Rubinov and
Sporns, 2011) (Figure S2). This weighted approach offered fewer modules at
the default resolution, therefore it should be interesting for future studies to
study finer scale structure by tuning the resolution parameter of the algorithm,
as per Bassett et al. (2013) and Lohse et al. (2014).
Force-directed graph layouts also provide an intuitive way to visualize
networks. In these layouts, connections serve as attractive forces between
nodes such that well connected groups of nodes are pulled closer together.
The algorithm by Fruchterman and Reingold (1991) was used to visualize the
baseline FC matrix and the FC matrix accounting for the effect of DREADD
activation (computed by adding DFC to the baseline network). Visualizations
are provided at two thresholds, using the minimum density that preserved
full connectedness across both matrices, including the amygdala (31%) and
excluding the amygdala (16%).
Relating Structural to Functional Connectivity
Baseline FC
The general approach taken to predict baseline FC from SC networks is
described in the Results. In summary, theoretic communication between
each ROI pair in the structural connectomes (the TTu and TTx matrices) was
quantified using the communicability metric (denoted G), which is used as a
proxy for FC. G is computed for weighted networks via the matrix exponential
of Wn, where Wn is the connectivity matrix after normalizing each connection
weight by the geometric mean of the two node strengths (Crofts and Higham,
2009). See Supplemental Information, Figures S4 and S5, and Table S3 for
further details.
FC Changes
Changes in FC due to DREADD activation were compared against predictions
derived from the TTu/x connectomes using the general framework of matrix
communicability. Simulated disconnection lesions of the amygdala were
carried out as follows. Given Wn, as described above, the matrix exponential
(eWn) computes the pre-lesion G values. Separately, all links incident to the
amygdala in Wn were removed to simulate disconnection. The matrix expo-
nential was computed on this separate matrix to generate post-lesion G
values. The difference post versus pre (DSC-communicability, or DG) was
calculated and log-transformed.
Correlations were assessed between DFC and DG across the connectome
(i.e., across node pairs). Because G incorporates all possible paths between
two regions, simulated lesion of any one region generated DG values for all
ROI pairs. Lesions were first carried out on the amygdala and DFC-DG corre-
lations were examined across primary (amygdalocortical) and secondary (all
corticocortical) ROI pairs. To examine the specificity of these correlations,
this process was then repeated across all ROIs, simulating disconnection of
the region and examining DFC-DG correlations across primary ROI pairs
(those including the lesioned region) and secondary ROI pairs (all others). Cor-
relations are reported separately for primary and secondary effects on each
simulated region. This entire process was then repeated using Dcovariance
as the empirical measure of coupling (rather than DFC), in order to examine
the influence of potential alterations in signal variance.

 In order to simulate amygdala-lesion effects that relate to regional changes
in signal variance, the total change in input (DGinput) was calculated on each
ROI, by summing all pairwise DGinput values incident to the ROI. Since TTx
and TTu are both asymmetric matrices, the DG matrix is also asymmetric,
allowing input and output effects to be summed separately.
