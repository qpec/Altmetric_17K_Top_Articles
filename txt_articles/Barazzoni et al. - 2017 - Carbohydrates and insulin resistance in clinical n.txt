Abstract 
47 
Growing evidence underscores the important role of glycemic control in health and recovery from illness. 
48 
Carbohydrate ingestion in the diet or administration in nutritional support is mandatory, but carbohydrate intake 
49 
can adversely affect major body organs and tissues if resulting plasma glucose becomes too high, too low, or highly 
50 
variable. Plasma glucose control is especially important for patients with conditions such as diabetes or metabolic 
51 
stress resulting from critical illness or surgery. These patients are particularly in need of glycemic management to 
52 
help lessen glycemic variability and its negative health consequences when nutritional support is administered. 
53 
Here we report on recent findings and emerging trends in the field based on an ESPEN workshop held in Venice, 
54 
Italy, 8‐9 November 2015. Evidence was discussed on pathophysiology, clinical impact, and nutritional 
55 
recommendations for carbohydrate utilization and management in nutritional support. The main conclusions 
56 
were: a) excess glucose and fructose availability may exacerbate metabolic complications in skeletal muscle, 
57 
adipose tissue, and liver and can result in negative clinical impact; b) low‐glycemic index and high‐fiber diets, 
58 
including specialty products for nutritional support, may provide metabolic and clinical benefits in individuals with 
59 
obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes; c) in acute conditions such as surgery and critical illness, insulin resistance 
60 
and elevated circulating glucose levels have a negative impact on patient outcomes and should be prevented 
61 
through nutritional and/or pharmacological intervention. In such acute settings, efforts should be implemented 
62 
towards defining optimal plasma glucose targets, avoiding excessive plasma glucose variability, and optimizing 
63 
glucose control relative to nutritional support.

1. Introduction: carbohydrates, insulin resistance, and clinical 
67 
nutrition 
68 
Carbohydrates in the diet provide an essential metabolic fuel, commonly in the form of glucose. While necessary 
69 
for life, excess or rapidly changing levels of glucose in the blood can lead to several health problems and contribute 
70 
to the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Furthermore, poorly 
71 
controlled glucose levels in critically ill patients or in those recovering from surgery can lead to glucose variability 
72 
with hyper‐ and hypoglycemia, conditions that can impede recovery and can be fatal. In order to summarize recent 
73 
research findings, share ideas, and discuss how emerging avenues of research may shape clinical nutrition 
74 
recommendations and guidelines in the future, the authors of this manuscript participated in a workshop hosted 
75 
by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) on November 8th and 9th 2015, in Venice, 
76 
Italy. In this manuscript about glucose and glycemic control in clinical nutrition, we report on key concepts from 
77 
workshop presentations. This report was prepared from a first draft based on summaries provided by each 
78 
speaker, professionally edited, and further reviewed and revised in multiple rounds by all Faculty members. In this 
79 
summary paper, we review how major metabolic organs use glucose and regulate its levels within the body, 
80 
explain conditions that disrupt glycemic control, and discuss dietary and clinical nutrition guidelines for the 
81 
treatment of conditions that feature dysglycemia.  
82 
Common digestible carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose), 
83 
disaccharides (sucrose, lactose), or polysaccharides (starches, glycogen), based upon chemical structure [1]. 
84 
Alternatively, carbohydrates are grouped based upon their digestibility and nutritional effect: the alpha bonds 
85 
between glucose molecules in starch are easily broken down in digestion, whereas beta bonds in fibers are 
86 
resistant to human digestive enzymes. Digestible carbohydrates break down and provide the body with 
87 
monosaccharides for energy, while those that resist digestion are non‐glycemic, but instead provide energy 
88 
through fermentation in the colon by the gut microbiota. Carbohydrate quality and digestibility can influence post‐
89 
prandial plasma glucose concentration and the inflammatory response, which is now known to underlie the 
90 
development of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and T2D [2]. Foods with high glycemic index (GI) and 
91 
glycemic load (GL) are associated with increased risk of such diseases [3‐5]. Conversely, lowering dietary GI and GL 
92 
  
4
can improve metabolic control [6‐11]. Furthermore, increasing the protein‐to‐carbohydrate ratio can reduce 
93 
glycemia [12], and inflammation can be tempered through dietary modification [13]. 
94 
2. Glucose metabolism in the organs 
95 
Advances in research have shed light on the ways in which glucose interacts with a number of organ systems. 
96 
Excess exposure of these organs to glucose as a result of hyperglycemia, as well as uncontrolled spiking of glucose 
97 
levels after meals, can contribute to the deterioration of an individual’s condition by causing metabolic 
98 
derangements such as oxidative stress, tissue and systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance. This section 
99 
summarizes the impact of glucose on major organs involved in substrate metabolism and utilization. 
100 
Central Nervous System 
101 
The relationship between glucose and the brain is important for the whole body. Glucose is the major physiological 
102 
source of energy for the brain, and the brain senses glucose and carbohydrate levels throughout the body (Figure 
103 
1A, B). The brain utilizes hormones to signal to other organs (Figure 1B‐E), communicate glucose status, and 
104 
influence whole‐body glucose homeostasis [14‐16]. The impaired glucose homeostasis that occurs in T2D may be 
105 
caused in part by early defects in central nervous system glucose sensing mechanisms [16]. 
106 
Skeletal muscle 
107 
Skeletal muscle is a major contributor to whole‐body glucose utilization, as glucose is a relevant fuel for the 
108 
maintenance of skeletal muscle energy homeostasis (Figure 1A, D). However, excess glucose exposure can lead to 
109 
muscle damage [17], which in turn has health and clinical consequences for the individual. Mechanisms of glucose‐
110 
induced tissue damage are complex and may vary in acute and chronic conditions. Common fundamental 
111 
pathways causing muscle damage following exposure to excess glucose however include oxidative stress, 
112 
inflammation, and insulin resistance, and it may alter tissue cell proliferation and differentiation [18]. Elevated 
113 
glucose has been shown to cause mitochondrial damage and dysfunction in muscle cell culture experiments [19], 
114 
thereby potentially leading to impaired tissue energy metabolism and substrate utilization. Through these 
115 
  
5
combined mechanisms, hyperglycemia may enhance muscle protein catabolism leading to reduced lean body mass 
116 
and strength [20‐22]. In agreement with the above observations, people with T2D demonstrated activation of pro‐
117 
inflammatory signaling pathways [23] and substantially enhanced protein breakdown [24] in skeletal muscle 
118 
compared to healthy individuals. Muscle alterations are likely to become more clinically relevant when diabetes‐
119 
induced hyperglycemia is associated with synergistic oxidative, pro‐inflammatory, and insulin‐desensitizing 
120 
conditions such as aging or chronic and acute disease.  
121 
 
122 
Adipose tissue  
123 
Adipose tissue plays a major 
124 
role in maintaining whole‐
125 
body metabolic homeostasis 
126 
[25], but its accumulation is 
127 
associated 
with 
adverse 
128 
outcomes such as metabolic 
129 
syndrome 
and 
diabetes, 
130 
cardiovascular events and several chronic diseases [26]. In recent years, research findings have revealed that 
131 
qualitative changes in metabolic and endocrine characteristics of adipocytes (adiposopathy) mediate aspects of 
132 
human disease. Metabolic research breakthroughs have uncovered ways that adipose tissue has substantial impact 
133 
on energy balance, insulin resistance, inflammation and obesity‐associated complications. Recently, differences 
134 
between white and brown adipocytes have been described. White adipose tissue is the most abundant type of 
135 
adipose tissue in human adults, and it 
136 
functions as an energy store as well as a 
137 
modulator of whole‐body substrate utilization 
138 
FIGURE 1: Summary overview of whole‐body metabolic homeostasis. A. 
Digestible carbohydrate (CHO) provide glucose from the gut, which also hosts 
microbiota that may process otherwise indigestible complex CHO. B. Glucose is 
the major energy source for the brain, which provides cues to the body about 
glucose availability. C. The liver produces glucose from non‐glucose sources 
during fasting for tissue energy needs and may store glucose as glycogen. D. 
Skeletal muscle may provide amino acids to other organs for energy and 
functional needs during fasting as well as in catabolic and disease conditions. E. 
Adipose tissue mass may be enhanced by excess glucose availability; excess lipid 
substrates may conversely infiltrate skeletal muscle and liver tissues thereby 
contributing to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism.

and metabolism through its endocrine functions [27]. Brown adipose tissue has an increasingly recognized 
139 
metabolic importance due to its higher mitochondrial content with high levels of uncoupling. These features lead 
140 
to generation of heat (thermogenesis) associated with energy dissipation that may favor resistance to obesity and 
141 
diet‐induced weight gain [28]. Lower brown adipose tissue content has been described in people with obesity or 
142 
T2D than in healthy individuals [29]. Experimental research has indicated that white adipose tissue can be 
143 
converted into its more beneficial, metabolically active brown counterpart, and this process has become the target 
144 
of intensive research [27, 30‐33]. Irisin, an exercise‐induced myokine, is thought to underlie the observed 
145 
browning of adipose tissue in experimental models [30]. Although controversy surrounds the role of irisin in 
146 
humans [34], this process may further underscore the potential importance of loss of muscle mass and function in 
147 
the onset of obesity‐associated metabolic complications. 
148 
Glucose modulates adipose tissue metabolism and mass both directly and indirectly by increasing insulin 
149 
secretion and plasma concentration. Hyperinsulinemia is a key inducer of lipogenesis and adipose tissue 
150 
expansion, and selective adipose tissue insulin receptor knockout may protect from fat tissue accumulation [35, 
151 
36] (Figure 1E). In agreement with the emerging view of inter‐organ cross‐talk to regulate metabolism, 
152 
experimental models have demonstrated that glucose is able to re‐direct stem cells derived from non‐adipose 
153 
tissues such as skeletal muscle to differentiate into ectopic adipocytes [37].  
154 
Liver 
155 
Interactions between carbohydrate and fat substrate availability may affect non‐adipose tissues in the body by 
156 
favoring ectopic lipid deposition [38]; non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis 
157 
(NASH) represent a relevant example of this negative interplay. NAFLD is an early indicator of insulin resistance 
158 
and metabolic syndrome in people with obesity [39], triggered by inflammatory processes induced by overfeeding. 
159 
Carbohydrates play a key role in the onset of NAFLD, with a negative impact for both excess glucose and fructose, 
160 
whereas complex and non‐digestible carbohydrates may be protective [40, 41]. High glucose contributes to the 
161 
onset of NAFLD also by enhancing circulating insulin, which in turn contributes to hepatic lipogenesis. 
162 
Inflammation and pro‐inflammatory signals are generated by excess fat accumulation [26, 42, 43] and are also 
163 
  
7
directly triggered by endotoxin translocation from the gut to the liver, with fructose being a major regulator of this 
164 
process [44]. Underlying molecular mechanisms of liver damage are not fully understood but may involve the 
165 
immune response and activation of immune signaling pathways that can cause liver damage and fibrosis [45‐48]. 
166 
Steatosis is reported to be ameliorated by intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [49] and complex 
167 
carbohydrates [50, 51]; elements of the Mediterranean diet [52, 53] and the Asian diet [54, 55] may therefore 
168 
prevent metabolic liver disease. NAFLD can also be combatted by the fostering of a healthy and diverse population 
169 
of gut microbiota, as discussed below [44, 56‐59].  
170 
Gut and gut microbiota 
171 
The gut plays central roles in the processing of carbohydrates and thereby influences glucose balance in the body 
172 
(Figure 1A). Gut endocrine functions and the gut bacterial population (microbiota) are emerging key players in the 
173 
regulation of intermediary metabolism. Unfavorable microbiota may contribute to the onset of obesity and 
174 
metabolic syndrome mainly by triggering pro‐inflammatory responses, and by favoring efficient nutrient 
175 
absorption [60, 61]. On the other hand, beneficial bacterial strains may result in protection from metabolic 
176 
disease, and interaction with non‐digestible dietary carbohydrates contributes to this effect. In particular, dietary 
177 
fibers interact with the gut microbiota and may reduce inflammation and unfavorable metabolic responses, 
178 
thereby also reducing hepatic steatosis [41, 62]. Gut microbiota‐driven fermentation of non‐digestible 
179 
carbohydrates or prebiotics can decrease carbohydrate‐induced blood glucose spikes that occur after a meal [63]. 
180 
Probiotics may further modulate release of gut peptides including glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1), also potentially 
181 
contributing to limit obesity and its metabolic complications (45, 82). Fermentation of non‐digestible 
182 
carbohydrates also results in production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that may play protective roles and 
183 
reduce the risk for systemic and local disease including cancer. Obese individuals are reported to display 
184 
metabolically unfavorable populations of gut microbes, and weight loss after gastric bypass surgery may shift this 
185 
pattern towards one resembling normal weight individuals [64, 65]. The possibility of harnessing microbiota to 
186 
treat obesity and metabolic disease is under intensive investigation. Small‐scale clinical studies of probiotic 
187 
supplementation have found favorable changes to glucose and fat metabolism [61, 66‐68]. Research has identified 
188 
metabolically beneficial bacterial strains in the gut microbiota, like Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium, or 
189 
  
8
Akkermansia, though their role as modulators of the host metabolism is still debated [69, 70]. Larger and longer‐
190 
term human trials are still necessary before tailored probiotic use can be incorporated into official guidelines for 
191 
the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome [61, 71]. 
192 
Fructose 
193 
Glucose is the body’s key form of energy and the most clinically relevant carbohydrate employed in patient 
194 
nutritional support. For these reasons, glucose is the main focus of the current review. However, glucose is not the 
195 
only simple sugar available through the diet. Fructose (as a monosaccharide or in the disaccharide sucrose) is also 
196 
found in a variety of foods, but is processed differently by the body. Fructose has also been a focus of research, as 
197 
it not only enters the diet through fruits but also is added to juices and other food products as a sweetener, and 
198 
therefore is widely consumed. After absorption, fructose is metabolized by the liver and can be converted into 
199 
glucose, lactate, and fatty acids. Fructose‐induced hepatic lactate release is a unique feature and opposite to 
200 
extrahepatic lactate flux to the liver for de novo glucose production. High‐fructose diets have been reported to 
201 
decrease insulin‐mediated suppression of glucose production and to increase hepatic lipogenesis and plasma 
202 
triglyceride concentrations [72], although recent meta‐analyses have failed to confirm associations between 
203 
fructose intake and several metabolic alterations potentially due to additional adaptive changes [73]. As 
204 
introduced above, a stronger link has been established between fructose and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease 
205 
(NAFLD), involving stimulation by fructose ingestion of pro‐inflammatory signals reaching the liver from the gut 
206 
[44, 46, 74]. Ingestion of a fructose‐free diabetes‐specific nutrition supplement formula (DSF) was shown to cause 
207 
lower blood glucose concentrations in patients with diabetes than formulas with fructose [75], and physical activity 
208 
has been shown to attenuate its deleterious effects on glycemic control [76]. However, as these effects of fructose 
209 
are still debated [73], additional trials to determine whether fructose in particular should be avoided in the diet are 
210 
necessary.

212 
support 
213 
Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes 
214 
Diet and lifestyle 
215 
Obesity and excess adiposity can lead to the development of glucose insensitivity, impaired insulin action, and 
216 
inability to properly regulate glycemic variations. Although dietary recommendations aimed at weight loss have 
217 
recently emphasized the importance of inducing energy deficits, at least in part independently of diet composition, 
218 
high GI and GL foods are associated with metabolic disease risk and health complications [3‐5]. Lowering dietary GI 
219 
and GL may conversely improve these outcomes and benefit patients with obesity and diabetes [6‐11]. Non‐
220 
digestible carbohydrates may also provide beneficial metabolic effects. Soluble fiber is reported to decrease 
221 
postprandial plasma glucose concentration and it may additionally decrease blood LDL‐cholesterol concentration 
222 
[7, 77]. Insoluble fiber, especially cereal fiber, decreases the risk of T2D and cardiovascular disease [78]. High fiber 
223 
intake is therefore recommended for people with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes, including people with 
224 
obesity and metabolic syndrome (i.e. the cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors including high waist circumference, 
225 
high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose and dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and low HDL‐cholesterol). 
226 
Such nutritional recommendations (Tables 1, 2) have been increasingly introduced by several health care 
227 
organizations and are currently included in guidelines for patients with or at risk of developing T2D, and they are 
228 
also appropriate for the management of plasma glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes (T1D) [79‐81].

Nutritional support can cause or exacerbate hyperglycemia, especially in obese and diabetic patients, and 
247 
hyperglycemia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality [91, 92]. In the clinical nutrition setting, a 
248 
burgeoning field of research is dedicated to designing nutritional support products for people with diabetes. Such 
249 
products aim to limit glycemic variation after administration [93]. Diabetes‐specific formulas (DSF) have many of 
250 
the following ingredients in common: a) lower carbohydrate content than standard formulas (SFs); b) higher 
251 
proportion of complex carbohydrates that are slowly digestible to reduce blood glucose spiking; c) modified 
252 
maltodextrin, starch, fructose, isomaltulose, and sucromalt, rather than the maltodextrin, starch, and sucrose 
253 
found in SFs [94]; d) fat content enriched in unsaturated fatty acids, especially monounsaturated fatty acids, in 
254 
higher proportion than in SFs [87]; e) fiber content higher than in SFs [95]. 
255 
Based on this available evidence, the ESPEN expert group endorses the utilization of DSFs for nutritional support of 
256 
people with obesity and diabetes. When parenteral nutrition must be used, the risk of hyperglycemia in obese and 
257 
diabetic patients can be reduced if the initial amounts of glucose provided in the TPN bag are limited to less than 2 
258 
g/kg/day until proper glycemic control is observed [96]. With the use of enteral nutrition, the risk of hyperglycemia 
259 
can be decreased by modification of the total amount and of the quality of carbohydrates used. Numerous short‐ 
260 
and mid‐term studies prove that enteral DSFs are associated with reduced postprandial blood glucose, 
261 
postprandial blood insulin, mean blood glucose values, glycemic variability, short‐acting insulin requirements, and 
262 
changes in HbA1c [75, 97‐102]. As with any other treatment decision, the individual patient features, different 
263 
clinical settings, and various combinations of insulin therapy may influence the choice between an enteral SF or 
264 
DSF for patients with obesity or diabetes. Additional randomized controlled studies are desirable to identify 
265 
optimal formula composition for different clinical conditions. 
266 
Recovery from surgery and critical illness 
267 
Acute states of metabolic stress often occur in the presence of disease. Such alterations may occur in individuals 
268 
with otherwise normal weight and glucose metabolism, or in patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or 
269 
  
13
diabetes for reasons related or unrelated to the illness causing the metabolic stress. Critical illness and recovery 
270 
from surgery are common clinical conditions requiring specific consideration. 
271 
Nutrition for enhanced recovery in surgical patients  
272 
Conventional thinking about the nutritional support of surgical patients has been challenged in recent years by a 
273 
body of evidence demonstrating the relevant negative impact of metabolic complications on outcome, as well as 
274 
the importance of nutrition to limit acute metabolic derangements. In particular, it has been clearly established 
275 
that insulin resistance is a key mechanism behind developments of complications and delayed recovery in surgical 
276 
patients [103]. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) is a multi‐modal perioperative care pathway shown to 
277 
lead to major improvements in outcomes in patients undergoing abdominal surgery; many ERAS elements reduce 
278 
insulin resistance, as summarized in recent guidelines [104]. Nutritional intervention may focus on overcoming the 
279 
traditional concept of fasting as well as on the general indication for immune‐nutrition to reduce morbidity. 
280 
Traditional surgical practices have emphasized the importance of fasting overnight before the procedure, but new 
281 
research has exposed this protocol as harmful to recovery [105]. Studies had originally indicated that a fixed 
282 
amount of mixed complex carbohydrates can be administered orally as a drink on the evening before surgery and 
283 
in the morning up to two hours before anesthesia, resulting in lower insulin resistance following surgical stress 
284 
with a positive impact on recovery and length of hospital stay [106]. In general, as reflected in fasting guidelines for 
285 
the past 20 years, evidence shows that clear fluids can be taken up to two hours before and that solids can be 
286 
ingested up to six hours before surgery [107]. Efforts should be made to perform surgical procedures under the 
287 
best attainable nutritional conditions, which may include nutritional support in combination with exercise before 
288 
intervention [108]. Finally, the health care provider can prescribe pharmaco‐nutrient support, including arginine 
289 
and omega‐3 fatty acids, to positively modulate immune response and limit inflammation to reduce morbidity, 
290 
with particular regard to infectious complications. These can attenuate the inflammation and improve immune 
291 
responses that may be impaired by surgery [105, 107], thereby lessening the risk for infection as well as insulin 
292 
resistance and hyperglycemia [109].  
293 
  
14
Glucose and nutritional support in critically ill patients 
294 
Glucose is the preferential physiological substrate for the production of energy in emergency conditions, including 
295 
the acute phase of critical illness. However, in the intensive care unit (ICU), acute metabolic stress commonly leads 
296 
to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Avoiding high blood glucose concentrations with insulin infusion improves 
297 
the outcomes (morbidity and mortality) of ICU patients in some studies, but not in others [110‐112]. The optimal 
298 
glycemic target is hence undefined and could differ between patients, time from injury, and setting. A strong 
299 
association has also been reported between high glucose variability as well as hypoglycemia and poor outcomes in 
300 
the critically ill [113‐116]. There is, however, consensus on the importance of effectively and closely monitoring 
301 
plasma glucose during critical illness to reduce variability. To this aim, automated systems for glucose control and 
302 
near‐continuous glucose monitoring may provide more reliable tools to stabilize glycemia, and their 
303 
implementation is therefore recommended. 
304 
Glucose control may become more problematic while implementing effective nutritional treatment in acute critical 
305 
illness. Enteral nutrition (EN) support has been shown to increase hyperglycemia risk in hospitalized patients. 
306 
However, this increase is less important than for parenteral nutrition, as enteral feeding triggers an elevation of 
307 
insulin known as the incretin effect [117‐119]. When EN cannot be tolerated and parenteral nutrition (PN) is 
308 
necessary, the high dextrose delivered by standard PN formulas can further exacerbate the stress‐related 
309 
hyperglycemia, even in non‐diabetic critically ill patients [91, 92, 96, 115, 120]. Thus both calorie and glucose 
310 
administration, particularly in early phases of critical illness, also commonly lead to higher insulin requirements to 
311 
control glycemia, with higher risk for glycemic variability and potential stimulation of lipogenesis. Additional care 
312 
should be taken to minimize these risks.  
313 
Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the optimal carbohydrate amount to administer to critically ill patients for 
314 
several reasons. These include difficultly in assessing energy requirements, altered enteral absorption, and 
315 
impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production. One study compared glucose‐based energy to lipid‐
316 
based energy provision in ICU patients and found that glucose was associated with trends for hyperglycemia, 
317 
higher insulin requirements, enhanced lipogenesis, and no improvement in protein sparing [121]. DSFs containing 
318 
higher proportions of fat and modified carbohydrates have not been extensively assessed in ICU patients, but 
319 
  
15
recent data suggest that the use of these formulas improves glycemic control, and, in at least one study, this was 
320 
shown to provide clinical benefit [100]. Further studies should address interactions between glucose, lipid, and 
321 
protein substrates, as well as the potential metabolic impact of higher utilization of lipid substrates for energy 
322 
provision. 
323 
Guidelines for nutritional strategy and composition of nutritional supplements have been published for practical 
324 
indications to achieve glucose control in critically ill patients [79, 87‐90] (Tables 1, 2). Suggestions from these 
325 
published studies include: 1) intervene with EN support as soon as possible to limit caloric debt [122]; 2) minimize 
326 
glycemic variability in patients who must take PN, with a target blood glucose of 90‐150 mg/dl (5‐8 mM) [123]; 3) 
327 
avoid hypoglycemia as a result of these approaches. For the avoidance of hyperglycemia, predisposing factors 
328 
should be identified [124‐126], and administration of intravenous insulin to critically ill patients should be 
329 
restricted when appropriate. 
330 
Based on the above considerations and the impact of calories on glucose metabolism and plasma concentrations, 
331 
the issue of limiting calorie administration to critically ill patients, particularly those with obesity, has been 
332 
considered [89]. Moderately hypocaloric feeding with high‐protein content aimed at counteracting protein 
333 
catabolism and muscle loss has been suggested in recent guidelines for critically ill obese patients (22‐25 kcal/kg of 
334 
ideal body weight per day, 2 g/kg protein of body weight if BMI is less than 40 kg/m2, or 2.5 if BMI is greater than 
335 
40 kg/m2) [89]. It should be pointed out that such recommendations are mainly aimed at minimizing metabolic 
336 
abnormalities such as glucose variability and potential hyperlipidemia, rather than directly inducing weight loss. 
337 
Additional research is desirable on optimal calorie provision for obese hospitalized patients with acute disease 
338 
conditions requiring nutritional support.

4. Summary and conclusions 
341 
While carbohydrates, which provide glucose to the body to support metabolism, are crucial to the diet, 
342 
inappropriate intake can lead to hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic fluctuations that are harmful to 
343 
health outcomes (Figure 2).  
344 
Excess glucose ingestion interacts with the gut and its microbiome and ultimately affects a number of organs 
345 
including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. Excess glucose availability may induce expansion of adipose 
346 
tissue and may favor ectopic fat deposition into liver and muscle tissues, which further exacerbates insulin 
347 
resistance and glycemic imbalances. Insulin resistance is associated with, and can promote progression of, 
348 
metabolic syndrome and eventually T2D, and it represents a factor contributing to hyperglycemia, glucose 
349 
variability, and poor outcomes in the critically ill or those recovering from surgery.  
350 
Optimal nutritional support for patients with obesity and T2D should limit glucose provision, and plasma glucose 
351 
should be carefully monitored in order to avoid harmful glucose fluctuations. In the surgical situation, preoperative 
352 
fasting should be avoided as part of ERAS protocols to optimize outcomes, particularly in abdominal surgical 
353 
patients. In critical illness, limiting glucose content in enteral and parenteral nutrition formulas may provide 
354 
benefits, although safety of higher lipid administration should also be assessed. It should be finally recognized that 
355 
more high‐quality trials specifically addressing optimal enteral and parenteral nutrition compositions aimed at 
356 
avoiding or minimizing clinical consequences of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are needed for optimal 
357 
clinical recommendations in these important areas of patient treatment.
