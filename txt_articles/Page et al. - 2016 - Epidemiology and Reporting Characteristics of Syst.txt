Abstract
Background
Systematic reviews (SRs) can help decision makers interpret the deluge of published bio-
medical literature. However, a SR may be of limited use if the methods used to conduct the
SR are flawed, and reporting of the SR is incomplete. To our knowledge, since 2004 there
has been no cross-sectional study of the prevalence, focus, and completeness of reporting
of SRs across different specialties. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the
epidemiological and reporting characteristics of a more recent cross-section of SRs.
Methods and Findings
We searched MEDLINE to identify potentially eligible SRs indexed during the month of Feb-
ruary 2014. Citations were screened using prespecified eligibility criteria. Epidemiological
and reporting characteristics of a random sample of 300 SRs were extracted by one
reviewer, with a 10% sample extracted in duplicate. We compared characteristics of
Cochrane versus non-Cochrane reviews, and the 2014 sample of SRs versus a 2004 sam-
ple of SRs. We identified 682 SRs, suggesting that more than 8,000 SRs are being indexed
in MEDLINE annually, corresponding to a 3-fold increase over the last decade. The majority
of SRs addressed a therapeutic question and were conducted by authors based in China,
the UK, or the US; they included a median of 15 studies involving 2,072 participants. Meta-
analysis was performed in 63% of SRs, mostly using standard pairwise methods. Study risk

 of bias/quality assessment was performed in 70% of SRs but was rarely incorporated into
the analysis (16%). Few SRs (7%) searched sources of unpublished data, and the risk of
publication bias was considered in less than half of SRs. Reporting quality was highly vari-
able; at least a third of SRs did not report use of a SR protocol, eligibility criteria relating to
publication status, years of coverage of the search, a full Boolean search logic for at least
one database, methods for data extraction, methods for study risk of bias assessment, a pri-
mary outcome, an abstract conclusion that incorporated study limitations, or the funding
source of the SR. Cochrane SRs, which accounted for 15% of the sample, had more com-
plete reporting than all other types of SRs. Reporting has generally improved since 2004,
but remains suboptimal for many characteristics.
Conclusions
An increasing number of SRs are being published, and many are poorly conducted and
reported. Strategies are needed to help reduce this avoidable waste in research.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Decisions in health care, such as which treatment to recommend or which test to order,
should be based on evidence from all available research studies, rather than the results of
the largest or most recent study.
• Systematic reviews, which explicitly use methods to identify, select, critically appraise,
and synthesize the results of all existing studies of a given question, are considered the
highest level of evidence for decision makers.
• We wanted to know how many systematic reviews of biomedical research are being pub-
lished, what questions they are addressing, and how well the methods are reported, since
information of this sort has not been collected since 2004.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We looked for all systematic reviews added to the main bibliographic database for bio-
medical literature during one month (February 2014), and recorded the characteristics
of these reviews.
• We found 682 systematic reviews—a 3-fold increase over the last decade—that
addressed a wide range of topics.
• In many cases, important aspects of the methods used were not reported (for example,
at least a third of the reviews did not report how they searched for studies or how they
assessed the quality of the included studies), unpublished data was rarely sought, and at
least a third of the reviews used statistical methods discouraged by leading organizations
that have developed guidance for systematic reviews (for example, Cochrane and the
Institute of Medicine).

 What Do These Findings Mean?
• We conclude that systematic reviews have become increasingly popular and that, similar
to a decade ago, the quality of conduct and reporting varies widely; therefore, readers
should not accept the findings of systematic reviews uncritically.
• We recommend a number of strategies to improve the value of systematic reviews, such
as the development of software to facilitate better reporting, certified training for journal
editors in how to implement the use of reporting guidelines such as PRISMA (http://
prisma-statement.org/), and formal training of biomedical researchers in research design
and analysis.
Introduction
Biomedical and public health research is conducted on a massive scale; for instance, more than
750,000 publications were indexed in MEDLINE in 2014 [1]. Systematic reviews (SRs) of
research studies can help users make sense of this vast literature, by synthesizing the results of
studies that address a particular question, in a rigorous and replicable way. By examining the
accumulated body of evidence rather than the results of single studies, SRs can provide more
reliable results for a range of health care enquiries (e.g., what are the benefits and harms of
therapeutic interventions, what is the accuracy of diagnostic tests) [2,3]. SRs can also identify
gaps in knowledge and inform future research agendas. However, a SR may be of limited use to
decision makers if the methods used to conduct the SR are flawed, and reporting of the SR is
incomplete [4,5].
Moher et al. previously investigated the prevalence of SRs in the biomedical literature and
their quality of reporting [6]. A search of MEDLINE in November 2004 identified 300 SRs
indexed in that month, which corresponded to an annual publication prevalence of 2,500 SRs.
The majority of SRs (71%) focused on a therapeutic question (as opposed to a diagnosis, prog-
nosis, or epidemiological question), and 20% were Cochrane SRs. The reporting quality varied,
with only 66% reporting the years of their search, 69% assessing study risk of bias/quality, 50%
using the term “systematic review” or “meta-analysis” in the title or abstract, 23% formally
assessing evidence for publication bias, and 60% reporting the funding source of the SR.
The publication landscape for SRs has changed considerably in the subsequent decade.
Major events include the publication of the PRISMA reporting guidelines for SRs [7,8] and SR
abstracts [9] and their subsequent endorsement in top journals, the launch of the Institute of
Medicine’s standards for SRs of comparative effectiveness research [10], methodological devel-
opments such as a new tool to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials included in SRs [11],
and the proliferation of open-access journals to disseminate health and medical research find-
ings, in particular Systematic Reviews, a journal specifically for completed SRs, their protocols,
and associated research [12]. Other studies have examined in more recent samples either the
prevalence of SRs (e.g., [13]) or reporting characteristics of SRs in specific fields (e.g., physical
therapy [14], complementary and alternative medicine [15], and radiology [16]). However, to
our knowledge, since the 2004 sample, there has been no cross-sectional study of the character-
istics of SRs across different specialties. Therefore, we considered it timely to explore the

 prevalence and focus of a more recent cross-section of SRs, and to assess whether reporting
quality has improved over time.
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiological and reporting
characteristics of SRs indexed in MEDLINE during the month of February 2014. Secondary
objectives were to explore (1) how the characteristics of different types of reviews (e.g., thera-
peutic, epidemiology, diagnosis) vary; (2) whether the reporting quality of therapeutic SRs is
associated with whether a SR was a Cochrane review and with self-reported use of the PRISMA
Statement; and (3) how the current sample of SRs differs to the sample of SRs in 2004.
Methods
Study Protocol
We prespecified our methods in a study protocol (S1 Protocol).
Eligibility Criteria
We included articles that we considered to meet the PRISMA-P definition of a SR [17,18], that
is, articles that explicitly stated methods to identify studies (i.e., a search strategy), explicitly
stated methods of study selection (e.g., eligibility criteria and selection process), and explicitly
described methods of synthesis (or other type of summary). We did not exclude SRs based on
the type of methods they used (e.g., an assessment of the validity of findings of included studies
could be reported using a structured tool or informally in the limitations section of the Discus-
sion). Also, we did not exclude SRs based on the level of detail they reported about their meth-
ods (e.g., authors could present a line-by-line Boolean search strategy or just list the key words
they used in the search). Further, we included articles regardless of the SR question (e.g., thera-
peutic, diagnostic, etiology) and the types of studies included (e.g., quantitative or qualitative).
We included only published SRs that were written in English, to be consistent with the previous
study [6].
We used the PRISMA-P definition of SRs because it is in accordance with the definition
reported in the PRISMA Statement [7] and with that used by Cochrane [19], by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality’s Evidence-based Practice Centers Program [20], and in the
2011 guidance from the Institute of Medicine [10]. Further, the SR definition used by Moher
et al. for the 2004 sample (“the authors’ stated objective was to summarize evidence from mul-
tiple studies and the article described explicit methods, regardless of the details provided”) [6]
ignores the evolution of SR terminology over time.
We excluded the following types of articles: narrative/non-systematic literature reviews;
non-systematic literature reviews with meta-analysis or meta-synthesis, where the authors con-
ducted a meta-analysis or meta-synthesis of studies but did not use SR methods to identify and
select the studies; articles described by the authors as “rapid reviews” or literature reviews pro-
duced using accelerated or abbreviated SR methods; overviews of reviews (or umbrella
reviews); scoping reviews; methodology studies that included a systematic search for studies to
evaluate some aspect of conduct/reporting (e.g., assessments of the extent to which all trials
published in 2012 adhered to the CONSORT Statement); and protocols or summaries of SRs.
Searching
We searched for SRs indexed throughout one calendar month. We selected February 2014, as it
was the month closest to when the protocol for this study was drafted. We searched Ovid
MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE 1946 to Present
using the search strategy reported by Moher et al. [6]: (1) 201402$.ed; (2) limit 1 to English; (3)

 2 and (cochrane database of systematic reviews.jn. or search.tw. or metaanalysis.pt. or medline.
tw. or systematic review.tw. or ((metaanalysis.mp,pt. or review.pt. or search$.tw.) and meth-
ods.ab.)).
This search strategy retrieved records that were indexed, rather than published, in February
2014. An information specialist (M. S.) ran a modified search strategy to retrieve records in
each of the 3 mo prior to and following February 2014, which showed that the number of rec-
ords entered into MEDLINE during February 2014 was representative of these other months.
Screening
Screening was undertaken using online review software, DistillerSR. A form for screening of
titles and abstracts (see S1 Forms) was used after being piloted on three records. Subsequently,
three reviewers (M. J. P., L. S., and L. L.) screened all titles and abstracts using the method of
liberal acceleration, whereby two reviewers needed to independently exclude a record for it to
be excluded, while only one reviewer needed to include a record for it to be included. We
retrieved the full text article for any citations meeting our eligibility criteria or for which eligi-
bility remained unclear. A form for screening full text articles (see S1 Forms) was also piloted
on three articles. Subsequently, two authors (of M. J. P., L. S., L. L., R. S.-O., E. K. R., and J. T.)
independently screened each full text article. Any discrepancies in screening of titles/abstracts
and full text articles were resolved via discussion, with adjudication by a third reviewer if neces-
sary. In both these rounds of screening, articles were considered a SR if they met the Moher
et al. [6] definition of a SR. Each full text article marked as eligible for inclusion was then
screened a final time by one of two authors (M. J. P. or L. S.) to confirm that the article was con-
sistent with the PRISMA-P 2015 definition of a SR (using the screening form in S1 Forms).
Data Extraction and Verification
We performed data extraction on a random sample of 300 of the included SRs, which were
selected using the random number generator in Microsoft Excel. We selected 300 SRs to match
the number used in the 2004 sample. Sampling was stratified so that the proportion of
Cochrane reviews in the selected sample equaled that in the total sample. Data were collected
in DistillerSR using a standardized data extraction form including 88 items (see S1 Forms).
The items were based on data collected in two previous studies [6,15] and included additional
items to capture some issues not previously examined. All data extractors piloted the form on
three SRs to ensure consistency in interpretation of data items. Subsequently, data from each
SR were extracted by one of five reviewers (M. J. P., L. S., F. C.-L., R. S.-O., or E. K. R.). Data
were extracted from both the article and any web-based appendices available.
At the end of data extraction, a 10% random sample of SRs (n = 30 SRs) was extracted inde-
pendently in duplicate. Comparison of the data extracted revealed 42 items where a discrep-
ancy existed between two reviewers on at least one occasion (items marked in S1 Forms). All
discrepancies were resolved via discussion. To minimize errors in the remaining sample of SRs,
one author (M. J. P.) verified the data for these 42 items in all SRs. Also, one author (M. J. P.)
reviewed the free text responses of all items with an “Other (please specify)” option. Responses
were modified if it was judged that one of the forced-choice options was a more appropriate
selection.
Data Analysis
All analyses were performed using Stata version 13 software [21]. Data were summarized as
frequency and percentage for categorical items and median and interquartile range (IQR) for
continuous items. We analyzed characteristics of all SRs and SRs categorized as Cochrane
Epidemiology and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews

 therapeutic (treatment/prevention), non-Cochrane therapeutic, epidemiology (e.g., prevalence,
association between exposure and outcome), diagnosis/prognosis (e.g., diagnostic test accu-
racy, clinical prediction rules), or other (education, psychometric properties of scales, cost of
illness). We anticipated that these different types of SRs would differ in the types of studies
included (e.g., therapeutic SRs would more likely include randomized trials than epidemiology
SRs). However, we considered nearly all of the other epidemiological and reporting characteris-
tics as equally applicable to all types of SRs (i.e., all SRs, regardless of focus, should describe the
methods of study identification, selection, appraisal, and synthesis). We have indicated in
tables when a characteristic was not applicable (e.g., reporting of harms of interventions was
only considered in therapeutic SRs). We also present, for all characteristics measured in the
Moher et al. [6] sample, the percentage of SRs with each characteristic in 2004 compared with
in 2014.
We explored whether the reporting of 26 characteristics of therapeutic SRs was associated
with a SR being a Cochrane review and with self-reported use of the PRISMA Statement to
guide conduct/reporting. The 26 characteristics were selected because they focused on whether
a characteristic was reported or not (e.g., “Were eligible study designs stated?”) rather than on
the detail provided (e.g., “Which study designs were eligible?”). We also explored whether the
reporting of 15 characteristics of all SRs differed between the 2004 and 2014 samples (only 15
of the 26 characteristics were measured in both samples). Associations were quantified using
the risk ratio, with 95% confidence intervals. The risk ratio was calculated because it is gener-
ally more interpretable than the odds ratio [22]. For the analysis of the association of reporting
of characteristics with PRISMA use, we included only therapeutic SRs because PRISMA was
designed primarily for this type of SR, and we excluded Cochrane SRs because they are sup-
ported by software that promotes good reporting.
The analyses described above were all prespecified before analyzing any data. The associa-
tion between reporting and self-reported use of the PRISMA Statement was not included in
our study protocol; it was planned following the completion of data extraction and prior to
analysis. We planned to explore whether reporting characteristics of non-Cochrane SRs that
were registered differed to non-Cochrane SRs that were unregistered, and whether reporting
differed in SRs with a protocol compared to SRs without a protocol. However, there were too
few SRs with a registration record (n = 12) or a SR protocol (n = 5) to permit reliable
comparisons.
We performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis to see if the estimated prevalence of SRs was
influenced by including articles that met the definition of a SR used by Moher et al. [6] but not
the more explicit PRISMA-P 2015 definition.
Results
Search Results
There were 2,337 records identified by the search (Fig 1). Screening of titles and abstracts led to
the exclusion of 738 records. Of the 1,599 full text articles retrieved, 917 were excluded; most
articles were not SRs but rather another type of knowledge synthesis (e.g., narrative review,
scoping review, overview of reviews).
Prevalence of SRs
We identified 682 SRs that were indexed in MEDLINE in February 2014. This figure suggests
an annual publication rate of more than 8,000 SRs, which is equivalent to 22 SRs per day and is
a 3-fold increase over what was observed in 2004 [6] (see calculations in S1 Results). One hun-
dred (15%) of the SRs were Cochrane reviews. We identified 87 articles that were not counted

 in the final sample of 682 SRs but that would have met the less explicit definition of a SR used
by Moher et al. [6] for the 2004 sample. In a sensitivity analysis, adding these to the final sam-
ple raised the SR prevalence to 769 SRs indexed in the month of February 2014, which is equiv-
alent to more than 9,000 SRs per year and 25 SRs per day being indexed in MEDLINE.

 Epidemiological Characteristics of SRs
Data were collected on the random sample of 45 Cochrane and 255 non-Cochrane SRs
(Table 1). The 300 SRs were published in 185 journals, most of which published only one SR
during the month (141/185 [76%]) and had an impact factor less than 5.0 (187/300 [62%]).

 Only 5/300 (2%) SRs were published in journals with a high impact factor (i.e., Thomson ISI
Journal Impact Factor 2012 > 15.0). Most of the SRs (250/300 [83%]) were published in the lat-
ter half of 2013. The median number of authors was five (IQR 4–6), and only 5/300 (2%) SRs
were conducted by one author. The corresponding authors were based most commonly in
China, the UK, or the US; corresponding authors from these three countries were responsible
for 155/300 (52%) of the examined SRs. Just over half of the SRs (164/300 [55%]) were classi-
fied as therapeutic, 74/300 (25%) as epidemiology, 33/300 (11%) as diagnosis/prognosis, and
29/300 (10%) as other. All Cochrane SRs focused on a therapeutic question. There was wide
diversity in the clinical conditions investigated; 20 ICD-10 codes were recorded across the SRs,
with neoplasms, infections and parasitic diseases, and diseases of the circulatory system the
most common (each investigated in >10% of SRs). All SRs were written in English.
Most SRs (263/300 [88%]) were published in specialty journals (Table 2). Only 31/300
(10%) were updates of a previous SR. The majority of these were Cochrane SRs (25/31 [81%]);
only one diagnosis/prognosis SR and no epidemiology SRs were described as an update. Of the
therapeutic SRs, 76/164 (46%) investigated a pharmacological intervention, 75/164 (46%)
investigated a non-pharmacological intervention, and 13/164 (8%) investigated both types of
intervention. A median of 15 studies involving 2,072 participants were included in the SRs
overall, but the number of studies and participants varied according to the type of SR.
Cochrane SRs included fewer studies (median 9 versus 14 in non-Cochrane therapeutic SRs),
and epidemiology SRs included a larger number of participants (median 8,154 versus 1,449 in
non-epidemiology SRs). Only 4/300 (1%) SRs were “empty reviews” (i.e., identified no eligible
studies). Meta-analysis was performed in 189/300 (63%) SRs, with a median of 9 (IQR 6–17)
studies included in the largest meta-analysis in each SR that included one or more meta-analy-
ses. Harms of interventions were collected (or planned to be collected) in 113/164 (69%) thera-
peutic SRs. Few SRs (23/172 [13%]) considered costs associated with interventions or illness.
Reporting Characteristics of SRs
Here we summarize a subset of the characteristics of the SRs about which data were collected
in this study (Table 3; data for all items are presented in S1 Results). Many SRs (254/300
[85%]) included the term “systematic review” or “meta-analysis” in the title or abstract. This
percentage increased to 94% (239/255) when Cochrane SRs, which generally do not include
these terms in their title, were omitted. A few SRs (12/300 [4%]) had been prospectively regis-
tered (e.g., in PROSPERO). In rather more SRs, authors mentioned working from a review pro-
tocol (77/300 [26%]), but a publicly accessible protocol was cited in only 49/300 (16%). These
figures were driven almost entirely by Cochrane SRs; a publicly accessible protocol was cited in
only 5/119 (4%) non-Cochrane therapeutic SRs and in no epidemiology, diagnosis/prognosis,
or other SRs. Authors reported using a reporting guideline (e.g., PRISMA [7], MOOSE [23]) in
87/300 (29%) SRs. The purpose of these guidelines was frequently misinterpreted; in 45/87
(52%) of these SRs, it was stated that the reporting guideline was used to guide the conduct, not
the reporting, of the SR (S1 Results). In 93/255 (36%) non-Cochrane SRs, authors reported
using Cochrane methods (e.g., cited the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter-
ventions [19]).
Reporting of Study Eligibility Criteria
At least one eligibility criterion was reported in the majority of SRs, but there was wide varia-
tion in the content and quality of reporting. In 116/300 (39%) SRs, authors specified that both
published and unpublished studies were eligible for inclusion, while a quarter restricted inclu-
sion to published studies (80/300 [27%]). However, in 103/300 (34%) SRs, publication status

 criteria were not reported. Language criteria were reported in 252/300 (84%) SRs, with more
SRs considering all languages (129/300 [43%]) than considering English only (92/300 [31%]).
Study design inclusion criteria were stated in 237/300 (79%) SRs. Nearly all Cochrane SRs (40/
45 [89%]) restricted inclusion to randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials, whereas
only 64/119 (54%) non-Cochrane therapeutic SRs did so. Epidemiology, diagnosis/prognosis,
and other SRs included a range of study designs, mostly observational (e.g., cohort, case–
control).

 Reporting of Search Methods
A median of four electronic bibliographic databases (IQR 3–5) were searched by review
authors. Only 28/300 (9%) SRs searched only one database, and nearly all of these were non-
Cochrane therapeutic (n = 11) or epidemiology (n = 13) SRs. Years of coverage of the search
were completely reported in 196/300 (65%) SRs, and a full Boolean search logic for at least one
database was reported in 134/300 (45%). Authors searched a median of one (IQR 1–2) other
source, of which reviewing the references lists of included studies was described most often
(243/300 [81%]). Sources of unpublished data were infrequently searched, for example, grey lit-
erature databases such as OpenSIGLE (21/300 [7%]) or drug or device regulator databases such
as Drugs@FDA (2/164 therapeutic SRs [1%]). Searching of trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.
gov) was reported in 58/300 (19%) SRs, more often in Cochrane therapeutic SRs (28/45 [62%])
than in non-Cochrane therapeutic SRs (24/119 [20%]).
Reporting of Screening, Data Extraction, and Risk of Bias Assessment
Methods
There was no information in approximately a third of SRs on how authors performed screen-
ing (87/300 [29%]), data extraction (97/296 [33%]), or risk of bias assessment (76/206 [37%])
(i.e., number of SR authors performing each task, whether tasks were conducted independently
by two authors or by one author with verification by another). Of the SRs that reported this
information, very few (<4%) stated that only one author was responsible for these tasks. Risk
of bias/quality assessment was formally conducted in 206/296 (70%) SRs, more often in thera-
peutic SRs (129/160 [81%]) than in epidemiology, diagnosis/prognosis, or other SRs (77/136
[57%]). Many different assessment tools were used. The Cochrane risk of bias tool for random-
ized trials [11] was the most commonly used tool in both Cochrane (37/42 [88%]) and non-
Cochrane therapeutic SRs (36/87 [41%]). Author-developed tools were used in 38/206 (18%)
SRs overall and were used more commonly than validated tools in epidemiology SRs (16/44
[36%] used a tool developed by the review authors, while 8/44 [18%] used the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale [24]). Risk of bias information was incorporated into the analysis (e.g., via sub-
group or sensitivity analyses) in only 31/189 (16%) SRs with meta-analysis.
Reporting of Included/Excluded Studies and Participants
A review flow was reported in the majority of SRs (226/300 [75%]) and was most often pre-
sented in a PRISMA/QUOROM-like flow diagram (206/300 [69%]). Reasons for excluding

 studies were described in 211/300 (70%) SRs overall but were described less often in epidemiol-
ogy (42/74 [57%]) and other (13/29 [45%]) SRs. At least one type of grey literature (e.g., confer-
ence abstract, thesis) was stated to have been included in 26/300 (9%) SRs. In many SRs, it was
difficult to discern the total number of participants across the included studies, as this figure
was described in the full text of only 194/296 (66%) SRs and in the abstract of only 147/296
(50%) SRs. Such information was infrequently reported in the SRs classified as other (4/29
[14%] in the full text and 3/29 [10%] in the abstract).
Reporting of Review Outcomes
Authors collected data on a median of four (IQR 2–6) outcomes; however, no outcomes were
specified in the methods section of 66/300 (22%) SRs. An outcome was described in the SR as
“primary” in less than half of the SRs (136/288 [47%]). Given that we did not seek SR protocols,
it is unclear how often the primary outcome was selected a priori. Most primary outcomes
were dichotomous (91/136 [67%]). Of the 99 therapeutic SRs with a primary outcome, a p-
value or 95% confidence interval was reported for 88/99 (89%) of the primary outcome inter-
vention effect estimates. Of these estimates, 53/88 (60%) were statistically significant and
favourable to the intervention, while none were statistically significantly unfavourable to the
intervention.
Reporting of Statistical Methods
Meta-analysis was performed in 189/300 (63%) SRs. The random-effects model was used more
often than the fixed-effects model (89/189 [47%] versus 34/189 [18%]), and statistical heteroge-
neity was examined in nearly all of these SRs (175/189 [93%]). In a third of SRs (72/189
[38%]), it was stated that a heterogeneity statistic guided the choice of the meta-analysis model
(e.g., random-effects model used if I2 > 50%). Methods commonly used to infer publication
bias (e.g., funnel plot, test for small-study effects) were used in approximately a third of SRs
(93/300 [31%]). Of these, only 53/93 (57%) SRs had a sufficient number of studies for the anal-
ysis (i.e., a meta-analysis that included at least ten studies [25]). It would have been inappropri-
ate to use such methods in 169/300 (56%) SRs due to the lack of meta-analysis or insufficient
number of studies. Authors discussed the possibility of publication bias (regardless of whether
it was formally assessed) in 141/300 (47%) SRs. In just under half of the SRs with meta-analysis,
authors reported subgroup analyses (87/189 [46%]) or sensitivity analyses (92/189 [49%]).
Advanced meta-analytic techniques were rarely used, for example, network meta-analysis
(7/300 [2%]) and individual participant data meta-analysis (2/300 [1%]).
Reporting of Limitations, Conclusions, Conflicts of Interest, and Funding
Few SRs included a GRADE assessment of the quality of the body of evidence (32/300 [11%]);
nearly all of those that did were Cochrane SRs (27/32 [84%]). Limitations of either the review
or included studies (or both) were stated in nearly all SRs (267/300 [89%]), although in 67/300
(22%) no review limitations were considered. Study limitations (including risk of bias/quality)
were incorporated into the abstract conclusions of only 99/164 (60%) therapeutic SRs. Most
review authors declared whether they had any conflicts of interest (260/300 [87%]). In contrast,
only 21/296 (7%) reported the conflicts of interest or funding sources of the studies included in
their SR. Almost half of the SRs were funded by a non-profit source (142/300 [47%]), while
only 8/300 (3%) were clearly funded by for-profit sources. However, the funding source was
not declared in a third of SRs (109/300 [36%]); this non-reporting was more common in non-
Cochrane therapeutic (53/119 [45%]), epidemiology (30/74 [41%]), and diagnosis/prognosis
SRs (17/33 [51%]) than in Cochrane therapeutic SRs (2/45 [4%]).

 Influence of Cochrane Status and Self-Reported Use of PRISMA on
Reporting Characteristics
Nearly all of the 26 reporting characteristics of therapeutic SRs that we analyzed according to
Cochrane status and self-reported use of the PRISMA Statement were reported more often in
SRs that were produced by Cochrane (Fig 2) or that reported that they used the PRISMA State-
ment (Fig 3). The differences were larger and more often statistically significant in the
Cochrane versus non-Cochrane comparison.
Comparison with 2004 Sample of SRs
The SRs we examined differed in several ways from the November 2004 sample. In 2014,
review author teams were larger, and many more SRs were produced by Chinese authors (up
from <3% of all SRs in 2004 to 21% in 2014) (Table 4). The proportion of therapeutic SRs
decreased (from 71% to 55% of all SRs), coupled with a rise in epidemiological SRs over the
decade (from 13% to 25%). Five ICD-10 categories—neoplasms, infections, diseases of the cir-
culatory system, diseases of the digestive system, and mental and behaviour disorders—were

 the most common conditions in both samples, while two other categories were common in
2014: diseases of the musculoskeletal system and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic dis-
eases. The proportion of SRs that were Cochrane reviews slightly decreased (from 20% to 15%
of all SRs).
There were more updates of previous Cochrane therapeutic SRs in the 2014 sample (38% in
2004 versus 56% in 2014) (Table 5). Also, more SRs included meta-analysis (52% in 2004 ver-
sus 63% in 2014). In contrast, there was a reduction in the median number of included studies
in SRs in 2014, and in the percentage of therapeutic SRs considering harms (75% in 2004 versus
69% in 2014) or cost (24% versus 13%).
Many characteristics were reported more often in 2014 than in 2004 (Fig 4); however, the
extent of improvement varied depending on the item and the type of SR (Table 6). The follow-
ing were reported much more often regardless of the type of SR: eligible language criteria (55%
of all SRs in 2004 versus 84% in 2014), review flow (42% versus 78% of all SRs), and reasons for
exclusion of full text articles (48% versus 70% of all SRs). Risk of bias/quality assessment was
reported more often in 2014 in non-Cochrane therapeutic (49% in 2004 versus 74% in 2014),

 epidemiology (30% versus 59%), and diagnosis/prognosis (13% versus 67%) SRs but less so in
other SRs (42% in 2004 versus 38% in 2014). A primary outcome was specified more often in
2014 in non-Cochrane therapeutic SRs (37% in 2004 versus 48% in 2014) and epidemiology
SRs (25% versus 40%) but much less often in other SRs (24% in 2004 versus 3% in 2014).

 Despite the large improvements for some SR types, many of the 2014 percentages are less than
ideal. Further, there was little change or a slight worsening in the reporting of several features,
including the mention of a SR protocol in non-Cochrane SRs (14% in 2004 versus 13% in
2014), presentation of a full Boolean search strategy for at least one database (42% versus 45%
of all SRs), and reporting of funding source of the SR (59% versus 64% of all SRs).
Discussion
We estimate that more than 8,000 SRs are being indexed in MEDLINE annually, correspond-
ing to a 3-fold increase over the last decade. The majority of SRs indexed in February 2014
addressed a therapeutic question and were conducted by authors based in China, the UK, or
the US; they included a median of 15 studies involving 2,072 participants. Meta-analysis was
performed in 63% of SRs, mostly using standard pairwise methods. Study risk of bias/quality
assessment was performed in 70% of SRs, but rarely incorporated into the analysis (16%). Few
SRs (7%) searched sources of unpublished data, and the risk of publication bias was considered
in less than half of SRs. Reporting quality was highly variable; at least a third of SRs did not
mention using a SR protocol or did not report eligibility criteria relating to publication status,
years of coverage of the search, a full Boolean search logic for at least one database, methods
for data extraction, methods for study risk of bias assessment, a primary outcome, an abstract
conclusion that incorporated study limitations, or the funding source of the SR. Cochrane SRs,
which accounted for 15% of the sample, had more complete reporting than all other types of
SRs. Reporting has generally improved since 2004, but remains suboptimal for many
characteristics.

 Explanation of Results and Implications
The increase in SR production from 2004 to 2014 may be explained by several positive changes
over the decade. The scientific community and health care practitioners may have increasingly
recognized that the deluge of published research over the decade requires integration, and that
a synthesis of the literature is more reliable than relying on the results of single studies. Some
funding agencies (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health Research and the Canadian Insti-
tutes of Health Research) now require applicants to justify their applications for research fund-
ing with reference to a SR, which the applicants themselves must perform if one does not exist
[26]. Further, some countries, particularly China, have developed a research culture that places
a strong emphasis on the production of SRs [27]. Also, the development of free software to per-
form meta-analyses (e.g., RevMan [28], MetaXL [29], R [30,31]) has likely contributed to its
increased use.
There are also some unsavory reasons for the proliferation of SRs. In recent years, some
countries have initiated financial incentives to increase publication rates (e.g., more funding
for institutions that publish more articles or cash bonuses to individuals per article published)
[32]. Further, appointment and promotion committees often place great emphasis on the num-
ber of publications an investigator has, rather than on the rigor, transparency, and reproduc-
ibility of the research [4]. Coupled with the growing recognition of the value of SRs,

 investigators may be strongly motivated to publish a large number of SRs, regardless of whether
they have the necessary skills to perform them well. In addition, the proliferation of new jour-
nals over the decade has made it more likely that authors can successfully submit a SR for pub-
lication regardless of whether one on the same topic has been published elsewhere. This has
resulted in a large number of overlapping SRs (one estimate suggests 67% of meta-analyses
have at least one overlapping meta-analysis within a 3-y period) [33]. Such overlap of SR ques-
tions is not possible in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, which may explain why
the proportion of Cochrane SRs within the broader SR landscape has diminished.
The conduct of SRs was good in some respects, but not others. Examples of good conduct
are that nearly all SRs searched more than one bibliographic database, and the majority per-
formed dual-author screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. However, few SRs
searched sources of unpublished data (e.g., trial registries, regulatory databases), despite their
ability to reduce the impact of reporting biases [34,35]. Also, an appreciable proportion of SRs
(particularly epidemiology and diagnosis/prognosis SRs) did not assess the risk of bias/quality
of the included studies. In addition, the choice of meta-analysis model in many SRs was guided
by heterogeneity statistics (e.g., I2), a practice strongly discouraged by leading SR organizations
because of the low reliability of these statistics [19,20]. It is therefore possible that some system-
atic reviewers inappropriately generated summary estimates, by ignoring clinical heterogeneity

 when statistical heterogeneity was perceived to be low. Further, a suboptimal number of thera-
peutic SRs considered the harms of interventions. It is possible that review authors did not
comment on harms when none were identified in the included studies. However, reporting of
both zero and non-zero harm events is necessary so that patients and clinicians can determine
the risk–benefit profile of an intervention [36]. To reduce the avoidable waste associated with
these examples of poor conduct of SRs, strategies such as formal training of biomedical
researchers in research design and analysis and the involvement of statisticians and methodol-
ogists in SRs are warranted [4].
Cochrane SRs continue to differ from their non-Cochrane counterparts. Completeness of
reporting is superior in Cochrane SRs, possibly due to the use of strategies in the editorial pro-
cess that promote good reporting (such as use of the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane
Intervention Reviews [MECIR] standards [37]). Also, word limits or unavailability of online
appendices in some non-Cochrane journals may lead to less detailed reporting. Cochrane SRs
tend to include fewer studies, which may be partly due to the reviews more often restricting
inclusion to randomized trials only. However, fewer studies being included could also result
from having a narrower review question (in terms of the patients, interventions, and outcomes
that are addressed). Further research should explore the extent to which Cochrane and non-
Cochrane SRs differ in scope, and hence applicability to clinical practice.
It is notable that reporting of only a few characteristics improved substantially over the
decade. For example, the SRs in the 2014 sample were much more likely to present a review
flow and reasons for excluded studies than SRs in the 2004 sample. This was most often done
using a PRISMA flow diagram [7], suggesting that this component of the PRISMA Statement
has been successfully adopted by the SR community. However, 2014 SRs were slightly less
likely than their 2004 counterparts to identify an outcome as “primary” and to report both the
start and end years of the search, and the number of SRs reporting the source of funding
increased only marginally. We do not believe that the smaller changes in reporting of some
characteristics is due to their receiving less emphasis in the original paper by Moher et al. [6] or
the PRISMA Statement [7], because neither emphasized any characteristic over others. There-
fore, more research is needed to determine which characteristics authors think are less impor-
tant to report in a SR, and why.
Mention of the PRISMA Statement [7], perhaps a surrogate for actual use, appears to be
associated with more complete reporting. However, reporting of many SRs remains poor
despite the availability of the PRISMA Statement since 2009. There are several possible reasons
for this. Some authors may still be unaware of PRISMA or assume that they already know how
to report a SR completely. The extent to which journals endorse PRISMA is highly variable,
with some explicitly requiring authors to submit a completed checklist at the time of manu-
script submission, others only recommending its use in the instructions to authors, and many
not referring to it at all [38,39]. Also, some PRISMA items include multiple elements (e.g., item
7 asks authors to describe the databases searched, whether authors were contacted to identify
additional trials, the years of coverage of the databases searched, and the date of the last
search). Some authors may assume that they have adequately addressed an item if they report
at least one element. Also, authors may consider PRISMA only after spending hours drafting
and refining their manuscript with co-authors, a point when they may be less likely to make
the required changes [40].
Our findings suggest that strategies other than the passive dissemination of reporting guide-
lines are needed to address the poor reporting of SRs. One strategy is to develop software that
facilitates the completeness of SR reporting [41]. For example, Barnes and colleagues recently
developed an online writing tool based on the CONSORT Statement [40]. The tool is meant to
be used by authors when writing the first draft of a randomized trial report and consists of
Epidemiology and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews
PLOS Medicine | DOI:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002028
May 24, 2016
26 / 30
 bullet points detailing all the key elements of the corresponding CONSORT item(s) to be
reported, with examples of good practice. Medical students randomly assigned to use the tool
over a 4-h period reported trial methods more completely [40]; thus, a similar tool based on
the PRISMA Statement is worth exploring. Also, journal editors could receive certified training
in how to endorse and implement PRISMA and facilitate its use by peer reviewers [42]. Fur-
ther, collaboration between key stakeholders (funders, journals, academic institutions) is
needed to address poor reporting [26].
More research is needed on the risk of bias in SRs that is associated with particular methods.
We observed that a considerable proportion of therapeutic SRs (40%) had potentially mislead-
ing conclusions because the limitations of the evidence on which the conclusions were based
were not taken into consideration. This is a problem because some users of SRs only have
access to the abstract and may be influenced by the misleading conclusions to implement inter-
ventions that are either ineffective or harmful [9]. We have not explored in this study the extent
to which the results of the SRs we examined were biased. Such bias can occur for several rea-
sons, including use of inappropriate eligibility criteria, failure to use methods that minimize
error in data collection, selective inclusion of the most favourable results from study reports,
inability to access unpublished studies, and inappropriate synthesis of clinically heterogeneous
studies [43]. Determining how often the results of SRs are biased is important because major
users of SRs such as clinical practice guideline developers tend to rely on the results (e.g., inter-
vention effect estimates) rather than conclusions when formulating recommendations [44].
We only recorded whether methodological characteristics were reported or not, rather than
evaluating how optimal each method was. Further, exploring whether non-reporting of a
method is associated with biased results is problematic, because non-compliance with report-
ing guidelines is not necessarily an indicator of a SR’s methodological quality. That is, some
review authors may use optimal methods but fail to clearly specify those methods for non-bias-
related reasons (e.g., word limits). In future, investigators could apply to the SRs in our sample
a tool such as the ROBIS tool [45], which guides appraisers to make judgements about the risk
of bias at the SR level (rather than the study level) due to several aspects of SR conduct and
reporting.
Strengths and Limitations
There are several strengths of our methods. We used a validated search filter to identify SRs,
and screened each full text article twice to confirm that it met the eligibility criteria. Screening
each article provides a more reliable estimate of SR prevalence than relying on the search filters
for SRs, which we found retrieved many non-systematic reviews and other knowledge synthe-
ses. We did not restrict inclusion based on the focus of the SR and, thus, unlike previous studies
[14,15], were able to collect data on a broader cross-section of SRs.
There are also some limitations to our study. Our results reflect what was reported in the
articles, and it is possible that some SRs were conducted more rigorously than was specified in
the report, and vice versa. Our findings may not generalize to SRs indexed outside of MED-
LINE or published in a language other than English. Two authors independently and in dupli-
cate extracted data on only a 10% random sample of SRs. We attempted to minimize data
extraction errors by independently verifying data for 42/88 “problematic items” (i.e., those
where there was at least one discrepancy between two authors in the 10% random sample). We
cannot exclude the possibility of errors in the non-verified data items, although we consider
the risk to be low given that the error rate for these items was 0% in the random sample. Also,
our results concerning some types of SRs (e.g., diagnosis/prognosis, other) were based on small
samples, so should be interpreted with caution. Further, searching for articles indexed in
Epidemiology and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews
PLOS Medicine | DOI:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002028
May 24, 2016
27 / 30
 MEDLINE, rather than published, during the specified time frame means that we examined a
small number of SRs (8/300 [3%]) with more than a year’s delay in indexing after publication.
However, inclusion of these few articles is unlikely to have affected our findings.
Some terminology contained within the PRISMA-P definition of a SR may be interpreted
differently by different readers (e.g., “systematic search” and “explicit, reproducible methodol-
ogy”). Hence, it is possible that others applying the PRISMA-P definition may have reached a
slightly different estimate of SR prevalence than we did. We tried to address this by also report-
ing a SR prevalence that included articles consistent with the less explicit definition used by
Moher et al. [6]. Also, any observed improvements in reporting since 2004 may partly be attrib-
uted to our use of a more stringent definition of SRs in 2014, which required articles to meet
more minimum reporting requirements. Hence, we may have slightly overestimated the
improvements in reporting from 2004 to 2014 and underestimated the true scale of poor
reporting in SRs.
Conclusion
An increasing number of SRs are being published, and many are poorly conducted and
reported. This is wasteful for several reasons. Poor conduct can lead to SRs with misleading
results, while poor reporting prevents users from being able to determine the validity of the
methods used. Strategies are needed to increase the value of SRs to patients, health care practi-
tioners, and policy makers.
