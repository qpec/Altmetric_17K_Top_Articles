background/objectives Walking pace is associated 
with risk of premature mortality. However, whether 
this relationship is independent of total volume of 
physical activity and highest physical activity intensity 
remains unclear. We examined the associations between 
walking pace and cause-specific mortality, investigating 
the potential modifying effect of factors such as total 
physical activity volume, highest physical activity 
intensity, age, sex and body mass index (BMI).
Methods Prospective pooled analysis of 11 population-
based baseline surveys in England and Scotland 
between 1994 and2008 that were linked with mortality 
records. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards 
models examined associations between walking pace 
(slow, average, brisk/fast) and all-cause, cancer and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
results 50 225 walkers were entered in the core 
analyses. Among participants who did not experience 
an event in the first 2 years of follow-up (n=49 731), 
walking at an average or brisk/fast pace was associated 
with a reduced risk of all-cause (20% (95% CI 12% to 
28%) and 24% (95% CI 13% to 33%), respectively) 
and CVD mortality (24% (95% CI 9% to 36%) and 
21% (95% CI 1% to 38%), respectively), compared 
with reporting walking at a slow pace. In stratified 
analyses, such associations were evident among those 
over 50 years, those not meeting the physical activity 
recommendations and those who did not undertake 
vigorous-intensity activity. There were no interactions by 
sex or BMI. No associations were seen between pace 
and cancer mortality.
Conclusion Walking benefits health. Assuming 
causality, these analyses suggest that increasing walking 
pace could reduce risk for all-cause and CVD mortality. 
Walking pace could be emphasised in public health 
messages, especially in situations when increase in 
walking volume or frequency is less feasible.
InTrOduCTIOn
Increasing population level walking remains a key 
focus of physical activity (PA) promotion. Regular 
walking is known to confer many physical, mental 
and social health benefits.1 Meta-analyses of cohort 
studies have sought to quantify the association 
between regular walking and reduction in risk for 
all-cause mortality (ACM).2–4 Kelly et al estimated 
that after adjustment for other PA, walking at a 
volume equivalent to PA guidelines was associated 
with an 11% reduction in risk for ACM compared 
with no walking.5 
Considering specific health endpoints, cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) and cancer are the two most 
common avoidable causes of mortality in the UK.6 
Hamer and Chida conducted a meta-analysis of 13 
cohort studies and found a 31% reduction in risk 
of CVD mortality in the highest walking categories 
compared with the lowest walking volume/intensity 
category.2 A recent large analysis of over 250 
000 
adults in the UK found walking to work was associ-
ated with a 36% reduction in risk of CVD mortality 
compared with non-active commuting.7 The results 
for cancer mortality are less clear, with, for example, 
Matthews et al8 and Celis-Morales et al7 finding no 
significant associations between walking volume 
and cancer mortality in large cohort studies.7 8
According to principles of overload, a higher 
relative activity intensity achieved by a faster pace 
of walking would provide the stimulus to produce 
a greater physiological response, and more substan-
tial or even additional health benefits. Acute studies 
have shown that walking at a faster pace results in 
greater physiological responses.1 However, while 
total volume of walking, for example, by distance 
or time has been frequently studied,2–5 less is known 
about the long-term health effects of habitual 
walking pace.
A Copenhagen City Heart Study analysis9 
reported reduced risk of heart failure for moderate 
and high walking speed compared with slow speed. 
The authors also suggested that walking pace may 
have a stronger association with heart failure than 
total duration of walking. Manson et al10 found that 
among 73 
743 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 
years, walking pace was associated with reduced 
incidence of CVD in a dose–response fashion. In a 
40-year follow-up of the Whitehall study of 6981 
British civil servants, Batty et al11 compared slow 
walking pace with high walking pace and found a 
reduced risk of all-cause, coronary heart disease 
and total cancer mortality. None of these studies 
adjusted for total volume of PA and it is therefore 
unclear if the reported effects were partly attribut-
able to the higher overall activity levels of brisk/fast 
walkers.
A recent analysis of 420 000 UK Biobank partici-
pants found significant associations between higher 
walking pace and reduced risk of all-cause and 
CVD mortality, but inconsistent findings for cancer

mortality.12 However, the UK Biobank had a response rate of 
5.5% and concerns have been raised about the generalisability of 
non-genetic associations from very unrepresentative cohorts.13
In summary, walking pace has been found to be associated 
with reduced risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a 
number of cohort studies but the literature on the whole has not 
addressed independence from total PA robustly. There remains 
a knowledge gap about the independence of the relationships 
between walking pace and mortality outcomes in large popula-
tion cohorts.
Our aim was to examine the associations between self-re-
ported walking pace with all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality 
in a population representative sample of 11 pooled population 
British cohorts. A secondary aim was to better understand the 
role of total and total PA, sex, age and body mass index (BMI) as 
potential moderators of these associations.
MeThOds
sample
The Health Survey for England (HSE)14 and the Scottish Health 
Survey (SHeS)15 are established household-based population 
surveillance studies running since 1991 and 1995, respectively. 
Each year, samples are selected using a multistage, stratified 
probability design aimed at recruiting a nationally represen-
tative sample of adults living in private households. Trained 
interviewers visited the selected households, and the recruited 
participants were administered the study questionnaires. 91.6% 
of survey participants gave written consent to have their death 
flagged on the NHS Central Mortality Register. For this analysis, 
we used data from HSE 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 
2006 and 2008 and SHeS 1995, 1998 and 2003. As population 
mortality rates increase evidently from the fourth decade of life, 
we included individuals aged ≥30 years old who reported at least 
one occasion of walking in the last 4 
weeks, had no doctor-diag-
nosed or self-reported (long-standing illness module) ischaemic 
heart disease, angina or stroke, and no prevalent cancer through 
cancer registration records or self-reported (long-standing illness 
module). 
Mortality outcomes
Participants 
were 
followed 
up 
for 
mortality 
until 
31 December 2009 (SHeS) or 31 March 2011 (HSE). Diagnoses 
for primary causes of death were recorded according to the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and 
Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Cancer deaths were identified using 
ICD-9 140.0–239.9 and ICD-10 C00.0–D48.9 codes; CVD 
deaths were identified using ICD-9 390.0–459.9 and ICD-10 
I01.0–I99 codes.
Assessment of walking and other PA
PA was assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire 
that inquired about walking, domestic PA and participation in 
sports and exercises in the 4 
weeks prior to the interview. An occa-
sion of walking was variously defined as at least   10     
min     or at 
least   15     
min     or at least   30     
min     in the different baseline 
 
 
surveys 16 Walking was assessed using a question on number of 
days walked in the last 4 weeks, the average amount of time spent 
walking on each day and the usual walking pace (‘which of the 
following describes your usual walking pace: slow pace, average 
pace, fairly brisk pace, fast pace—at least 4 mph’).  Because 
some baseline surveys (HSE 1994/1999/2003/2004; SHeS 1995) 
did not enquire about walking duration per reported occasion, 
we imputed this information based on the age and sex-specific 
estimates of HSE 1997/1998 (that included duration questions) 
using methods described elsewhere.16. All PA variables were 
summarised to reflect weekly averages for easier comparison 
with currently recommended amounts. The criterion validity 
of the walking-related questions is unknown. In a convergent 
validity study of over 2000 adults, the Spearman’s correlation 
coefficients between accelerometry counts and walking of brisk/
fast pace were 0.35 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.40) for women and 0.28 
(95% CI 0.23 to 0.34) for men.17 The equivalent coefficients 
for total weekly questionnaire derived metabolic equivalents 
(MET)-min were 0.41 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.46) for women and 
0.32 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.38) for men.17
The PA compendium18 was used to assign the MET for all 
activities to calculate total MET-hours/week. We estimated 
adherence to the general guideline19 as accumulating weekly at 
least 150 
min of moderate intensity or 75 
min of vigorous inten-
sity or equivalent combinations of moderate and vigorous PA.19 
We also calculated the highest PA intensity reached on at least 
one occasion over the last 4 
weeks that the PA questionnaire time 
frame covered (light/moderate/vigorous).
Covariates
Height and weight were measured by the interviewers using stan-
dard protocols14 15; BMI was calculated as weight (in kilograms) 
divided by height (in metres) squared. Additional questions 
assessed age, educational attainment (age completed full-time 
education), presence of long-standing illness, weekly frequency of 
alcohol consumption, smoking habits (never smoker, ex-smoker, 
currently smoking 1–9 cigarettes/day, currently smoking 10–19/
day, currently smoking ≥20/day), psychological distress/depres-
sion (12-point General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score), 
total (non-walking) leisure time PA volume (MET-hours/week) 
and total walking volume (MET-hours/week), and highest PA 
intensity reached on at least one occasion.
statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using SPSS V
.22 (SPSS). Cox propor-
tional hazards models with time in study as the time scale were 
used to examine the associations between walking pace and 
all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality with ‘slow pace’ as the 
reference category. Walking pace was originally entered in its 
original four-category format but the low number of events in 
the ‘fast pace’ category resulted in unstable estimates and broad 
95% CIs; for this reason, all main analyses were carried out with 
‘fairly brisk’ and ‘fast’ pace categories collapsed into one group. 
In a supplemental analysis, we entered walking pace in its orig-
inal format.
Kaplan-Meier log-minus-log plots were used to examine 
the proportional hazards assumption and no violations were 
observed. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and all covariates 
listed above. Occupational PA could not be used in the calcu-
lation of PA volume because of its non-quantitative nature (it 
was reported as very/fairly/not very/not at all physically active). 
Also, we chose not to adjust for occupational PA level in the 
main Cox models because of the large number of missing values 
(n≈27 000) due to the corresponding question missing from 
SHeS 1995 and for responses being dependant on employment 
status.
We examined effect modification by sex, age and total PA 
level using type 3 Wald Χ2 statistics for the interaction term in 
the partially adjusted (for age, sex and cohort/year) model. For 
interactions with p<0.010 
we performed stratified analyses.19 To

disease we ran a sensitivity analysis where we both included 
and excluded participants who died in the first 24 months of 
follow-up. This manuscript adheres to the Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology standards 
for reporting of observational studies (STROBE).
resulTs
In total, 65 
381 participants were initially considered; 4811 
participants (8.4% of total eligible) did not consent to follow-up 
and were excluded. The variables with the highest number of 
missing data were BMI (n=6346), GHQ score (n=2444) and 
smoking (n=151). In total, there were 3617 deaths from any 
cause including 1014 from CVD and 1276 from cancer causes. 
The mean follow-up was 9.2 (SD=4.6) years, corresponding to 
469 
235 person-years. Table 1 presents the sample character-
istics for the 50 
225 individuals in the core analytical sample. 
Slower walking pace was associated with older age, female sex, 
higher BMI scores, reporting a long-standing illness at baseline 
and psychological distress. Faster walking pace was associated 
with being a smoker, high frequency of alcohol consumption, 
finishing education after age 19 years, meeting the PA recom-
mendations, participating in higher intensity PA, high volumes 
of total non-occupational PA, and higher frequency and total 
walking volume. Walking pace (in its original four-group format) 
showed low magnitude correlations with total leisure time PA 
volume (Spearman r=0.25) and total walking volume (r=0.20).
Table 2 presents the associations between walking pace and the 
three mortality outcomes with all participants who had an event 
in the first 24 months of the follow-up excluded (n=49 
731). In 
the fully adjusted models, walking at an average pace was asso-
ciated with a risk reduction for ACM of 20% (95% CI 12% to 
28%) compared with those walking at a slow pace. The respec-
tive risk reduction for those walking at brisk/fast pace was 24% 
(13%–33%). For CVD mortality, walking at an average pace was 
associated with a 24% (9%–36%) risk reduction and walking at 
a brisk/fast pace was associated with 21% (1%–38%) risk reduc-
tion compared with those walking at a slow pace. There was no 
evidence to suggest walking at an average or brisk/fast pace was 
associated with a significant risk reduction in cancer mortality 
(HR=1.08 (0.89–1.31) and HR=1.02 (0.81–1.29), respec-
tively). The results were similar in direction and magnitude when 
those who had an event in the first 24 months were included 
(online supplementary table 1). When the walking pace variable 
was entered in its original four-group format (online supple-
mentary table 2) associations were similar in magnitude and 
direction but likely due to lower number of events, the 95% 
CIs 
of the fast pace group were very wide and included one for all 
three outcomes. Repeating all above analyses with the models 
adjusted for total duration of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) 
and light-intensity activity (instead of average MET-hours/week) 
produced almost identical results, for example, the HR (95% 
CI) 
for ACM in the average pace group changed from 0.80 (0.72 to 
0.88) to 0.80 (0.73 to 0.88); in the brisk/fast group it changed 
from 0.76 (0.67 to 0.87) to 0.77 (0.68 to 0.88) (data available 
on request).
There were statistically significant interaction effects of 
walking pace and total PA volume (eg, p=0.038 for ACM) and 
highest intensity reached (eg, p=0.004 for ACM). Significant 
interaction effects were also found for walking pace and age (eg, 
p=0.005 for ACM) but not for sex or BMI.
Stratified analyses by age in two and three groups are 
presented in figure 1 and online supplementary figure

1, respectively, and by compliance with the PA recommenda-
tions in figure 2. Figure 1 shows clearer evidence of a relation-
ship between walking pace and all-cause and CVD mortality, 
but not cancer mortality, in the over 50s compared with the 
results for the whole sample. There was little evidence of 
association in the under 50s. Online supplementary figure 1 
showed clearer evidence for a relationship of walking pace 
with ACM in those aged 45–59 and ≥60 years and with CVD 
mortality in those aged ≥60 years.
Figure 2 shows clearer evidence of a relationship between 
walking pace and all-cause and CVD mortality, but not cancer 
mortality, among those that did not meet the PA guidelines 
compared with the results of the whole sample. For those 
meeting the guidelines, the direction of effect for all-cause and 
CVD mortality was protective for increasing pace, but very low 
number of events caused low power and wide CIs.
Figure 3 shows the stratified analyses of walking pace and 
all-cause and CVD mortality by highest intensity reached; anal-
yses were not performed for cancer mortality due to the low 
number of events in some cells and the apparent violation of the 
proportional hazards assumption. There was evidence of a rela-
tionship between walking pace and ACM in both the light and 
moderate-intensity groups. There was some evidence for a rela-
tionship with CVD mortality in these groups although CIs were 
wider and there was no dose–response. There was no evidence 
of a relationship between walking pace and all-cause or CVD 
mortality among the group that reported reaching vigorous 
intensity.
dIsCussIOn
In adults in Scotland and England, walking at average or brisk/
fast pace was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD 
mortality compared with walking at slow pace. However, there 
was no evidence of a similar relationship with cancer mortality. 
Our findings are in agreement with previous studies which have 
reported that a higher pace of walking was associated with a risk 
reduction for ACM between 19%20 and 42%.11 Our estimates 
are within this range, and adjusted for total volume of both 
walking and non-walking PA (MET-hours/week), and highest PA 
intensity reached. We found that the associations between pace 
and ACM persisted after controlling for total leisure time PA, 
which is consistent with studies that controlled for total walking 
energy expenditure21 and MVPA.12 Batty et al reported a 20% 
reduction in cancer mortality for walking fast.11 Similar to Yates 
et al,12 we did not find any evidence of this effect.
Possible explanations
The association between pace on all-cause and CVD mortality may 
be explained by the increased relative exercise intensity elicited by 
a faster pace providing a greater stimulus for physiologic adapta-
tions22 in functions known to influence CVD mortality. This may 
be further confirmed by the observation that the associations of 
walking pace with ACM and (in particular) CVD mortality were 
considerably weakened for the subsample of participants who have 
achieved vigorous intensity in non-walking PA.
We did not find an effect of pace on cancer mortality. 
Volume may be more important than pace for cancer mortality.

Alternatively, we know that different cancers have different 
relationships with PA, and that if we had examined mortality 
from specific malignancies, for example, breast and colon 
cancers, a relationship may have been observed. 23
We did not find evidence for associations for the younger 
participants, the physically active or for those reaching 
vigorous intensity, but recommend caution when interpreting 
these findings as low number of events in some strata increased 
uncertainty. It is possible that older age and lower PA status 
(total or intensity) predict lower aerobic fitness (maximal 
oxygen consumption). As such, that the relative intensity of 
walking at faster pace may be equivalent to the upper end 
of moderate intensity or even vigorous intensity, and there-
fore provides a greater physiological stimulus for maintaining 
cardiovascular function and promoting health.
Separating the effect of one specific aspect of PA and under-
standing its potentially causal association with mortality is 
complex. Our analyses suggest that participants who usually 
walk at a brisk/fast pace are overall the most active and 
probably the healthiest. Although it is biologically plausible 
that walking at a higher pace leads to better health overall 
and cardiovascular health specifically, it is also likely that 
walking at a faster pace is a marker for better health, fitness 
and physical function, which predicts the risk for mortality in

the following years. In other words, walking pace may be a 
predictor of lower mortality risk, a causal factor, or both.
strengths and limitations
The strengths of the present study include the large sample 
comprising a series of baseline surveys that were roughly repre-
sentative of the population in England and Scotland, the very high 
response rates and the relatively long follow-up. The results can 
be generalised to the UK population with more confidence than 
previous estimates. T
o our knowledge, this is the first such study to 
report associations between walking pace and all-cause, CVD and 
cancer mortality and adjust for total (walking and non-walking) PA 
volume and highest intensity reached. We also present novel anal-
ysis of associations stratified by age, total PA and highest intensity 
reached to investigate important potential effect modifiers.
Limitations include the exposure ‘walking pace’ and all other 
PA variables were self-reported and therefore subject to misclas-
sification and other biases. Further misclassification may have 
been introduced by the imputation of walking duration for a 
number of baseline surveys,16 and this may be partly the reason 
why adjustments for total walking volume had negligible impact 
on the estimates. The repeated cross-sectional nature of HSE and 
SHeS meant we could not assess or account for temporal changes 
in walking behaviour within individuals. The analyses controlled 
for a comprehensive set of covariates in addition to PA, although 
we cannot discount the possibility of residual confounding. Some 
stratified analyses had too few events and therefore may not have 
been powerful enough to detect associations or lack of association 
with confidence.
Implications and future research
The additional protective effect demonstrated from higher walking 
pace may have implications for public health messaging. Walking 
is a cornerstone of PA promotion for public health, but volume 
of walking (steps per day) has often been emphasised.24 Given 
the perceived time barrier cited by those who fail to meet current 
PA guidelines, a pace change may be more feasible (for those with 
adequate physical capacity) than increased volume or duration. We 
encourage the Chief Medical Officers’ Physical Activity Guidelines 
Committee to consider this in their upcoming revision of the PA 
Guidelines. Further experimental research is warranted to establish 
if a randomised intervention based on pace elicits important phys-
iological change.25

Walking is known to benefit health. Assuming causal relation-
ships, these analyses suggest that increasing walking pace could be 
linked with lower risk for all-cause and CVD mortality. Walking 
pace should be emphasised in public health messages, especially in 
circumstances when increase in walking volume or frequency is less 
feasible.
