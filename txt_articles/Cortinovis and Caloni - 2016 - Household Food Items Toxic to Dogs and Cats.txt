Several foods that are perfectly suitable for human consumption can be toxic to dogs and 
cats. Food-associated poisoning cases involving the accidental ingestion of chocolate 
and chocolate-based products, Allium spp. (onion, garlic, leek, and chives), macadamia 
nuts, Vitis vinifera fruits (grapes, raisins, sultanas, and currants), products sweetened with 
xylitol, alcoholic beverages, and unbaked bread dough have been reported worldwide in 
the last decade. The poisoning episodes are generally due to lack of public knowledge 
of the serious health threat to dogs and cats that can be posed by these products. The 
present review aims to outline the current knowledge of common food items frequently 
involved in the poisoning of small animals, particularly dogs, and provides an overview of 
poisoning episodes reported in the literature.

iNTRODUCTiON
Several foods, while safe for humans, may pose a serious threat to the health of dogs and cats. Food-
associated poisoning cases involving the accidental ingestion of chocolate, onions, macadamia nuts, 
Vitis vinifera fruits (grapes, raisins, sultanas, and currants), xylitol, and ethanol have been recorded 
worldwide in the last decade (1–3). Foods accounted for 14.8% of hazardous exposure cases reported 
to the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Chocolate- and cocoa-based products were 
most commonly involved, followed by products sweetened with xylitol, onions and garlic, grapes 
and raisins, macadamia nuts, and ethanol (3). In general, the poisoning episodes resulted from a 
lack of public knowledge of the health hazard to small animals that may be posed by these products. 
Dogs and cats may be fed harmful foodstuffs by owners unaware of the danger or given the wide 
occurrence of these products in the home, pets may easily have accidental access to them. Dogs are 
undiscriminating in their eating habits and will readily ingest potentially harmful foodstuffs, thus 
being far more commonly affected than cats (4). While some foodstuffs, such as chocolate, have 
long been known to cause poisoning in dogs and cats, others such as grapes had previously been 
considered unlikely to cause problems and have emerged as a potential concern only in the last few 
years (5). As a consequence, cases of significant exposure had been wrongly diagnosed for many 
years (5). This review aims to outline the current knowledge of common household foods frequently 
involved in the poisoning of small animals, particularly dogs, and provides an overview of poisoning 
episodes reported in the literature.
ALLIUM SPP.
Onion (Allium cepa), garlic (Allium sativum), leek (Allium porrum), and chives (Allium schoenopra-
sum) are all members of the genus Allium (Amaryllidaceae family). These bulbous plants are strongly 
aromatic, producing a characteristic odor when crushed, and are commonly used (fresh, cooked,

or dehydrated) as ingredients in many dishes. The components 
responsible for their toxicity are organosulfoxides. Chewing the 
plant converts organosulfoxides to a complex mixture of sulfur 
compounds. The primary toxicological mechanism of Allium-
derived sulfur compounds is oxidative hemolysis characterized 
by the development of methemoglobinemia and Heinz body 
formation in the erythrocytes (6, 7). Cooking, drying, and 
processing do not eliminate the toxic effect of Allium spp. (7, 8). 
Dogs and cats are highly susceptible to Allium toxicosis and the 
ingestion of 5 g/kg of onions by cats and 15–30 g/kg by dogs is 
enough to cause clinically important hematologic changes (8). In 
the case of dogs, hereditary high erythrocyte-reduced glutathione 
and potassium concentrations observed in certain breeds (e.g., 
Akita, Shiba, and Jindo) lead to greater susceptibility to onion-
induced oxidative damage (9). Clinical signs of Allium toxicosis 
may appear 1 day or several days after consumption depending 
on the amounts ingested. Common clinical signs initially include 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and depres-
sion. Due to the developing anemia, pale mucous membranes, 
weakness, rapid respiratory and heart rates, jaundice, and dark 
urine (reddish or brown) indicating hemoglobinuria are sub-
sequently observed (7). Several cases of dog and cat poisoning 
by Allium spp. have been reported in the literature. Poisoning 
has been reported to occur after the ingestion of Catalan spring 
onion commonly known as “calcot” (10), baked garlic (11), onion 
soufflè (12), butter-cooked onions (13), and Chinese steamed 
dumplings containing Chinese chives (Allium tuberosum) and 
garlic (14). A case in which a dog was intentionally fed a large 
quantity of raw onions by the owner has also been reported (15). 
From 1994 to 2008, 69 cases of canine poisoning and 4 cases of 
feline poisoning by Allium spp. ingestion (16) were recorded by 
the Veterinary Poisons Information Service (VPIS). In the case 
of dogs, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and, less frequently, 
anemia, hematuria, and convulsions were reported. Two cases of 
death occurred and two dogs were euthanized. In the case of cats, 
gastrointestinal signs, lethargy, and polydipsia occurred in one 
case, while anemia and icterus were observed in the second case. 
One cat remained asymptomatic without treatment, and the other 
cat died from hemorrhage into the pleural and abdominal cavi-
ties (16). Recently, hypertension associated with garlic-induced 
hemolytic anemia has been reported in the case of a dog (11). 
No specific antidote is available for Allium toxicosis. Inducing 
vomiting should be considered in asymptomatic dogs and cats, 
provided there are no complicating factors and not more than 2 h 
have elapsed since ingestion (8). The administration of activated 
charcoal is indicated after vomiting has stopped. Once clinical 
signs have manifested themselves, treatment should consist of 
supportive care. Severely anemic animals may require a blood 
transfusion (8).
eTHANOL
Ethanol or ethyl alcohol is a two-carbon alcohol found in a variety 
of products, such as alcoholic beverages, paint and varnish, medi-
cation, perfume, mouthwash, certain types of thermometers, and 
certain forms of antifreeze. It is also used as a disinfectant, a fuel 
substitute, and if administered intravenously, as a competitive 
substrate in the treatment of dogs and cats poisoned by ethylene 
glycol. Ethanol toxicosis in small animals generally occurs as 
a result of accidental ingestion of alcoholic beverages (17–20). 
Ethanol intoxication has also been reported in the case of dogs, 
following ingestion of rotten apples (21), sloe berries used 
to make sloe gin (22), and uncooked bread and pizza dough 
(23–25). The latter contains the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
which metabolizes carbohydrate substrates to ethanol and carbon 
dioxide (26). Once ingested, ethanol is rapidly absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract and crosses the blood–brain barrier (27). The 
mechanism of action of ethanol is not completely clear. Ethanol 
is suspected of inhibiting N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate recep-
tors in brain cells and the related production of cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (27). Clinical signs usually develop within an 
hour of ingestion and include central nervous system (CNS) 
depression, ataxia, lethargy, sedation, hypothermia, and meta-
bolic acidosis (27). Animals may become comatose and develop 
severe respiratory depression. A distended and painful abdomen 
due to excessive gas production may be noted in animals that 
ingest uncooked bread dough (25). Emesis should be induced 
with extreme caution and only in cases of very recent ingestion 
by animals that prove to be asymptomatic (27). Recently, hemo-
dialysis has been shown to be beneficial for the rapid removal of 
ethanol in patients with severe toxicosis (20). Yohimbine, an alpha 
2-adrenergic antagonist which readily crosses the blood–brain 
barrier, has been recommended as an arousal agent in the treat-
ment of ethanol intoxication (25). In previous case reports, most 
patients recovered when monitored closely and given supportive 
care (22, 24, 28). Fatal ethanol intoxication was reported in the 
case of a dog, following the massive ingestion of rotten apples. The 
dog developed vomiting, ataxia, tremors, and dehydration, and 
died 48 h later. However, liver damage secondary to the chronic 
ingestion of rotten apples (presumed to reflect chronic ethanol 
toxicity) was suspected as a factor in the death of this dog (21).
GRAPeS AND THeiR DRieD PRODUCTS 
(RAiSiNS, SULTANAS, AND CURRANTS)
Grapes, the fruits of Vitis vinifera, and their dried products (raisins, 
sultanas, and currants) have been reported to cause renal failure 
in dogs. The fruits may be ingested raw or cooked as ingredients 
of fruit cake, mince pies, malt loaf, snack bars, scones, and other 
baked goods (28). The toxic syndrome has also been observed 
with consumption of marc (the residue of grapes after pressing) 
(29). The toxic principle(s) and the exact mechanism of grape-
induced nephrotoxicity are still unknown. The latter appears to 
involve a nephrotoxic agent or an idiosyncratic reaction, leading 
to hypovolemic shock and renal ischemia (30). There is consider-
able variation in the susceptibility of dogs to grapes and their dried 
products. In a recent study that reviewed 180 reports recorded by 
the VPIS between August 1994 and September 2007 on the inges-
tion of Vitis fruits by dogs, some animals were reported to remain 
asymptomatic after ingesting up to 1 kg of raisins while others 
died following the ingestion of just a handful (28). Published case 
reports have identified renal failure in dogs following the inges-
tion of estimated doses of raisins as low as 2.8 mg/kg (31) and as

little as four to five grapes in a dog weighing 8.2 kg (32) (Table 1). 
Therefore, ingestion of any quantity of these fruits should be con-
sidered as a potential clinical problem. Vomiting within 24 h of 
ingestion is the typical clinical sign observed. Diarrhea, anorexia, 
lethargy, and abdominal pain have also been reported (28, 31). 
Partially digested grapes and grape products may be present in 
the vomit, fecal material, or both (31–33). This is followed by 
signs of renal insufficiency or failure (oliguria, anuria, polydipsia, 
proteinuria, and elevated serum concentrations of creatinine and 
urea) within a short period (28, 31, 32). In cases of dogs with 
oliguria or anuria, the prognosis is generally poor (30, 34). The 
time taken to administer treatment may also play a significant role 
in the outcome (28). Given the large variability in the tolerance 
exhibited by dogs, the ingestion of any quantity of grapes or grape 
products by dogs should be handled aggressively (28). Following 
recent ingestion, prompt decontamination using emetics and 
repeated doses of activated charcoal is highly recommended (28, 
30). All dogs should receive aggressive intravenous fluid therapy 
for a minimum of 48–72 h, and their renal function should be 
monitored for at least 72 h (28, 30).
HOPS
Hops, the inflorescences of the female plant of the species Humulus 
lupulus, are used for beer brewing to add a bitter taste and hoppy 
aroma to beer and to stabilize the beer foam. As home brewing 
becomes increasingly popular, companion animals may be at risk 
of exposure. The ingestion of both fresh and spent hops has been 
associated with the development of malignant hyperthermia in 
dogs (41). Any breed of dog may be affected, but breeds predis-
posed to malignant hyperthermia (e.g., Greyhounds, Labrador 
Retrievers, Saint Bernards, Pointers, Dobermans, Border Collies, 
English Springer Spaniels, and northern breeds) appear to be par-
ticularly susceptible (42). Hops contain a variety of compounds, 
including resins, essential oils (hycrocarbons and oxygenated 
compounds), phenolic compounds (tannins), and nitrogenous 
compounds (43). These compounds or their metabolites may 
uncouple oxidative phosphorylation resulting in malignant 
hyperthermia (6, 42). Clinical signs may be seen within hours 
of consuming hops and include marked hyperthermia, anxiety, 
tachycardia, tachypnea, panting, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
seizures. Dark brown urine suggesting muscle necrosis may be 
observed (6, 42). Mortality can be high despite the aggressive 
therapy for hyperthermia (6). Duncan et al. (44) reported five 
cases involving dogs (four of which were Greyhounds) that 
exhibited marked hyperthermia, restlessness, panting, vomiting, 
signs of abdominal pain, and seizures, after the ingestion of hops. 
Four of the five dogs died despite intensive care treatment (44). 
Dogs suspected of recent ingestion of hops should be treated 
aggressively to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract. Cooling 
measures, such as ice baths and cold IV fluids, should be used to 
lower the high body temperature. If available, dantrolene sodium,

a skeletal muscle relaxant that has been used in humans to reverse 
malignant hyperthermia, may be administered (6, 41, 42).
MACADAMiA NUTS
Macadamia nuts are produced by trees of the genus Macadamia 
(Proteaceae family). Only two species, Macadamia integrifolia 
and Macadamia tetraphylla, are plants of commercial impor-
tance as sources of food. All Macadamia spp. accumulate 
cyanogenic glycoside (proteacin and durrin) in their seeds but 
in very low concentrations in the case of commercial seeds 
(45). Macadamia nuts are very popular as snacks for human 
consumption, both as plain nuts or when used in cakes, cook-
ies, or candy (46). They are considered to be a valuable food 
for their low cholesterol and sodium content and as an excel-
lent source of manganese and thiamine (45). Macadamia nut 
toxicosis has only been reported in dogs to date (1, 47–49). 
The mechanism of action of their toxicity in the case of dogs 
is currently unknown and the dose required to induce toxicity 
has not been established precisely (46). The ingestion of as little 
as 0.7 g/kg of nuts has been associated with the development 
of clinical signs in dogs (48). In another case, a series of toxic 
doses ranging from 2.2 to 62.4 g/kg was reported (49). Clinical 
signs generally develop within 12 h of ingestion and may include 
weakness (particularly hind limb weakness), depression, vomit-
ing, ataxia, tremors, hyperthermia, abdominal pain, lameness, 
stiffness, recumbency, and pale mucous membranes (47–49). 
Although macadamia nut poisoning is relatively infrequent, 83 
cases were reported in Queensland, a major area for Macadamia 
spp. cultivation in Australia, over a period of 5 years (1). No 
deaths have been reported to date, and animals are expected to 
fully recover within 24–48 h with minimal veterinary interven-
tion (46). The induction of emesis should be considered in cases 
of recent ingestion of macadamia nuts by dogs that prove to be 
asymptomatic (46).
MeTHYLXANTHiNeS (CAFFeiNe, 
THeOBROMiNe, AND THeOPHYLLiNe)
Methylxanthines, including caffeine, theobromine, and theophyl-
line, are plant-derived alkaloids that are commonly found in a 
variety of foods, beverages, human medication, and other products 
in the home. Caffeine is found in coffee (from the fruit of Coffea 
arabica), tea (from the leaves of Thea sinensis), guarana (from the 
seeds of Paullinia cupana), and as an additive in many soft drinks. 
Theobromine occurs in cacao seeds (Theobroma cacao) and in 
products manufactured from these seeds, such as chocolate. 
Theophylline is found in tea along with caffeine. Moreover, caf-
feine is used in human medication to increase mental alertness, 
and theophylline is widely used as a bronchodilator in anti-asthma 
drugs (50). Methylxanthines antagonize cellular adenosine recep-
tors and inhibit cellular phosphodiesterases, causing an increase 
in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (50). Moreover, 
methylxanthines enhance the release of catecholamines and 
increase cellular calcium entry while inhibiting intracellular 
sequestration of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading 
to increased muscular contractility (51). These combined actions 
result in the stimulation of both the CNS and cardiac muscle, the 
relaxation of smooth muscle, most notably bronchial muscle, and 
diuresis (50). Methylxanthine poisoning cases have been reported 
after the ingestion of herbal supplements containing guarana 
(52), garden mulch made of cacao bean shells (53, 54), caffeine 
tablets (55, 56), and caffeine-containing bait (57). However, 
most poisoning cases occur as a result of chocolate ingestion (4, 
58–62). Though the intoxication of cats may also occur, dogs are 
most commonly affected because of their indiscriminate eating 
habits (4). The presence of chocolate was noted in the 10 most 
common cases of toxicosis involving dogs reported to the VPIS 
and to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals (ASPCA), Animal Poisons Control Center (APCC) in 
the past few years (60, 63). Poisoning episodes frequently occur 
around holidays when there is a higher occurrence of chocolate 
products in the home (4, 60). In addition to theobromine, 
chocolate contains caffeine but in much lower concentrations. 
Theobromine and caffeine concentrations vary according to the 
type of chocolate (4). Unsweetened baking chocolate and cocoa 
powder usually contain more than 14 mg of theobromine per 
gram. Semisweet dark chocolate and milk chocolate often contain 
around 5 and 2 mg of theobromine per gram, respectively, while 
white chocolate is considered to be an insignificant source of 
theobromine (50). According to the ASPCA APCC data, mild 
clinical signs appear in dogs after ingesting 20 mg/kg of theo-
bromine and caffeine, while severe clinical signs are observed at 
40–50 mg/kg and seizures occur at 60 mg/kg (4). Dogs with 
CYP1A2 deficiency polymorphism 1117C > T may be more at 
risk of poisoning due to reduced metabolism (64, 65). In dogs, 
caffeine is absorbed rapidly after ingestion while theobromine is 
absorbed 10 times slower, reaching peak plasma levels at approxi-
mately 10 h (50). Initial clinical signs are generally observed within 
2–4 h after ingestion and include restlessness, polydipsia, urinary 
incontinence, vomiting, and perhaps diarrhea. Dogs can be in 
an excited state and show marked hyperthermia and tachycardia. 
As intoxication progresses, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, 
premature ventricular contractions, muscular rigidity, ataxia, 
seizures, and coma may be observed. Death may occur from 
cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory failure (50). Decontamination 
via emesis or gastric lavage, administration of multiple doses of 
activated charcoal, and meticulous supportive care should be 
the mainstay of treatment (4, 60). Prognosis is usually good, if 
effective decontamination is obtained within 2–4 h of ingestion 
(50, 60).
XYLiTOL
Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol primarily used as an 
artificial sweetener in many products, including sugar-free 
gum, candy, bread, cookies, and other baked goods. It can also 
be purchased as a granulated powder for cooking and baking. 
Because of its antibacterial activity and palatability, xylitol is also 
included in a variety of medical and dental care products. An 
additional concern is that the use of xylitol is not just confined 
 5

to products intended for human use. Xylitol is also an ingredi-
ent in drinking water additives developed to help maintain dog 
and cat dental health (66). The increased marketing and use of 
xylitol as a sweetener in recent years has led to increased risk 
of pet exposure to this agent (66, 67). Dogs are the species at 
the risk of developing severe, life-threatening clinical signs. In 
dogs, xylitol is a potent stimulator of insulin release, leading to 
dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels (66, 67). Doses, as low 
as 0.03 g/kg, have resulted in hypoglycemia in this species (68). 
Moreover, xylitol ingestion has been associated with liver failure 
in dogs. The mechanisms responsible for hepatic injury are not 
clear yet. It is thought to be related to either adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP) depletion secondary to xylitol metabolism, leading 
to hepatic necrosis or the generation of hepatocyte-damaging 
reactive oxygen species or both (69). According to the ASPCA 
APCC data, the lowest dose associated with xylitol-induced liver 
failure in dogs is 0.5 g/kg (70). Clinical signs of xylitol toxicity 
in dogs may be related to hypoglycemia or hepatopathy or both. 
Vomiting is usually the initial clinical sign. Clinical signs of 
hypoglycemia, including lethargy, ataxia, collapse, and seizures, 
may develop within 30–60 min after ingestion or may be delayed 
up to 12 h after ingestion (66, 70). In dogs developing hepatopa-
thy, lethargy, icterus, vomiting, and coagulopathic signs, such as 
petechiae, ecchymoses, and gastrointestinal hemorrhages, may 
be observed (67, 69). Several cases of xylitol ingestion have been 
reported in the last decade (69, 71–75). Table 2 summarizes the 
cases of xylitol-induced acute hepatic failure reported in the lit-
erature. Recently, a retrospective study of the 192 cases of xylitol 
ingestion by dogs, reported to three American university teach-
ing hospitals from December 2007 to February 2012, has been 
performed (68). The median estimated dose ingested was 0.32 g/
kg (range 0.03–3.64 g/kg). Clinical signs developed in 41 (21%) 
dogs and primarily included vomiting and lethargy, followed by 
diarrhea, ataxia, seizures, restlessness, and anorexia (68). Thirty 
dogs (15.6%) became hypoglycemic and no significant differ-
ence was observed between hypoglycemic and euglycemic dogs 
with regards to the estimated dose of xylitol ingested. No dogs 
developed clinical signs or showed biochemistry values consist-
ent with liver failure. All dogs survived and were discharged, 
suggesting an excellent prognosis for dogs that receive prompt 
veterinary care and evade liver failure (68). Supportive care 
and monitoring are the mainstay of xylitol toxicity treatment. 
The induction of emesis should only be attempted early and 
in asymptomatic animals. Activated charcoal is not recom-
mended because of its poor ability to bind to xylitol (68, 70). 
Blood glucose levels and liver function should be monitored. If 
hypoglycemia develops, intravenous dextrose should be admin-
istered (69, 70). Xylitol ingestion should always be considered 
by veterinarians as a differential diagnosis for any unexplained 
hypoglycemic presentation with or without accompanying liver 
dysfunction (76).
CONCLUSiON
The present review highlights the issue of exposure of small 
animals, particularly dogs, to potentially harmful foodstuffs com-
monly present in the home. A noticeable trend in exposure has 
emerged due to the increasing popularity of xylitol as a sweetener 
in several products. Obtaining an accurate history of exposure, 
early recognition of clinical signs, and rapid establishment of 
appropriate therapy can greatly improve the prognosis of food-
related poisoning cases. Large gaps still exist in public knowledge 
of the hazard that certain foodstuffs may pose to the health of 
dogs and cats. Preventing exposure is the key to reducing the 
incidence of these poisoning episodes. Therefore, it is important 
to increase the knowledge of pet owners with regard to foodstuffs 
that must not be fed to dogs and cats and should be stored outside 
their reach.
