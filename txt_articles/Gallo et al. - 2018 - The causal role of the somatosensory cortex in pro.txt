Abstract Witnessing another person’s suffering elicits vicarious brain activity in areas that are
active when we ourselves are in pain. Whether this activity influences prosocial behavior remains
the subject of debate. Here participants witnessed a confederate express pain through a reaction
of the swatted hand or through a facial expression, and could decide to reduce that pain by
donating money. Participants donate more money on trials in which the confederate expressed
more pain. Electroencephalography shows that activity of the somatosensory cortex I (SI) hand
region explains variance in donation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) shows that altering
this activity interferes with the pain–donation coupling only when pain is expressed by the hand.
High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) shows that altering SI activity also
interferes with pain perception. These experiments show that vicarious somatosensory activations
contribute to prosocial decision-making and suggest that they do so by helping to transform
observed reactions of affected body-parts into accurate perceptions of pain that are necessary for
decision-making.

Introduction
Prosocial behavior — actions intended to benefit others despite costs to self (Batson, 1981) — is
important in social animals but poorly understood. The role of empathy in motivating prosocial
behavior is intuitive but also intensely debated (Bloom, 2017; Zaki, 2017). Some researchers
have shown that people are more likely to engage in prosocial behaviour when they feel empathy
for the person in distress (Batson, 1981) and that self-reported emphatic concern is related to pro-
social behaviour (FeldmanHall et al., 2015). Others have shown that empathy is a poor predictor of
prosociality (Vachon et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2016), with prosocial decisions often driven by
other motives (e.g. status; Bloom, 2017). Unfortunately, experiments that specifically manipulate
brain activity in empathy-related regions and that measure prosociality are missing, limiting our neu-
roscientific understanding of whether and how empathy is mechanistically linked to prosociality
(Keysers and Gazzola, 2017; Zaki et al., 2016). Here, we use a combination of electroencephalog-
raphy (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS) to explore whether altering somatosensory activity that vicariously represents the pain of

 others would alter the decision to donate money to alleviate that pain, and whether alterations in
pain perception mediate this effect.
Witnessing somebody in pain activates two networks, depending on the nature of the stimulus
(Keysers et al., 2010; Lamm et al., 2011). If the pain of the other is deduced from abstract symbols
or facial expressions alone, a network involving the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior cingulate cor-
tex (ACC) is activated. The AI and ACC activity correlates with personal distress (Singer et al.,
2004), perceived unpleasantness (Rainville et al., 1997) and perceived pain intensity (Lamm et al.,
2011), and is therefore thought to code for the unpleasantness of the pain of the other
(Lamm et al., 2011). This network is often referred to as the affective path. If the injured body part
is visible and in the focus of attention, the somatosensory cortices (SI and SII) are also recruited
(Bufalari et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2008; Keysers and Gazzola, 2009; Lamm et al., 2011;
Nummenmaa et al., 2012; Morrison et al., 2013; Ashar et al., 2017; Christov-Moore and Iaco-
boni, 2016) and consequently included in the network of regions participating in human empathy
(Keysers et al., 2010; de Waal and Preston, 2017).
The affective and somatosensory networks are also active when experiencing pain (Mel-
zack, 2001; Iannetti and Mouraux, 2010; Lockwood et al., 2013). Because of that, many interpret
vicarious activation while witnessing the pain of others as the neural correlate of emotional conta-
gion, feeling vicariously what we see someone else experience, a core component of empathy
(Koban et al., 2013; Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2006; Lamm et al., 2011;
eLife digest When we experience physical pain, certain areas in our brain that process bodily
sensation and emotions switch on. If we see someone else in pain, many of the same regions also
get activated. In contrast, convicted criminals with psychopathic traits have less activation in these
areas of the brain when witnessing someone’s pain; they also show less empathy and disregard the
needs of others. This suggests that a lack of this ‘shared activations’ may lead to problems in
empathy. In fact, many scientists believe that shared activations are why we feel empathy for people
in pain, and why we are driven to help them. Yet, there is little direct evidence about how the
activity in the pain processing parts of the brain actually influences helpful behavior. As a result,
some scientists now argue that empathy-related processes may actually contribute very little to
helping behavior.
Gallo et al. designed an experiment where participants watched videos of someone having their
hand swatted with a belt, and showing different levels of pain as a result. The volunteers could
decide to reduce the amount of pain the person received by donating money they could have taken
home. The more pain the participants thought the victim was in, the more money they gave up to
lessen it. During the study, the activity in the brain region that processes pain in the hand was also
measured in the participants. The more active this region was, the more money people donated to
help.
Then, Gallo et al. used techniques that interfered with the activity of the brain area involved in
perceiving sensations from the hand. This interference changed how accurately participants assessed
the victim’s pain. It also disrupted the link between donations and the victim’s perceived pain: the
amount of money people gave no longer matched the level of pain they had witnessed. This
suggests that the brain areas that perceive sensations of pain in the self, which evolved primarily to
experience our own sensations, also have a social function. They transform the sight of bodily harm
into an accurate feeling for how much pain the victim experiences. The findings also show that we
need this feeling so we can adapt our help to the needs of others. In the current debate about the
role of empathy in helping behaviors, this study demonstrates that empathy-related brain activity
indeed promotes helping by allowing us to detect those that need our assistance.
Understanding the relationship between helping behavior and the activity of the brain may
further lead to treatments for individuals with antisocial behavior and for children with callous and
unemotional traits, a disorder that is associated with a lack of empathy and a general disregard for
others.

 Cui et al., 2015; Singer et al., 2004). In this perspective, the emotional states of others are under-
stood through personal, embodied representations that allow empathy and accuracy in perceiving
other emotions to increase on the basis of the observer’s past experiences (Preston and de Waal,
2002; de Waal and Preston, 2017). Pharmacological studies provide causal evidence for the
involvement of our own experience of pain, via the insula and anterior cingulate cortex, in perceiving
the pain of other individuals (Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015, 2017). This evidence pin-points to the opioidergic
circuit, which might code representations of aversive outcomes that are derived through both direct
and indirect experiences (Haaker et al., 2017). Much like the original proposal of Adam Smith
(Smith, 1759), the pain vicariously felt because of the recruitment of these pain-related regions while
viewing the pain of others is then thought to motivate prosocial behavior, which then simply serves
to reduce the vicariously felt pain (Batson, 1981; Hein et al., 2010, 2016; Ma et al., 2011;
Tomova et al., 2016).
Testing the causal contribution of mapping the pain of others onto our own pain representations
in social decision-making has remained poorly explored in neuroscience because most scientists
focus on the affective network (AI, ACC), which lies too deep in the brain to allow its selective tar-
geting with traditional non-invasive neuro-manipulation tools (Keysers and Gazzola, 2017). Here,
we leverage the less investigated hand representation of SI, which is superficial and reachable with
TMS, to address two questions: does activity in the somatosensory cortex (measured using EEG)
explain prosocial behavior on a trial-by-trial basis and does disturbing (with TMS) this activity alter
decision-making? We explore prosocial behavior using a costly helping paradigm (Figure 1A), in
which participants make a moral decision between two conflicting motives: maximizing their financial
gains and minimizing the pain of another (see FeldmanHall et al. [2015]) for use of a similar
tradeoff scenario). We then measure and alter brain activity in the hand region of SI to explore the
impact of this activity on the decision-making.
If somatosensory activity contributes to our decision to help, does it do so by being necessary for
an accurate perception of how much pain other people experience? Whether somatosensory activa-
tion levels reflect the intensity of the pain experienced by others remains unclear (Lamm et al.,
2011; Morrison et al., 2013), and we therefore use data from a third experiment in which high-
definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) is used to alter SI activity to measure whether an SI perturbation also
alters the accuracy of pain perception.
As mentioned above, somatosensory cortices are mainly involved when the injured body parts
are visible. In addition, ventral regions of SI have been reported to be involved in emotional facial
perception (e.g Adolphs et al., 2000; van der Gaag et al., 2007; Preston and de Waal, 2002; but
see Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015 for absence of SI activity in the perception of facial expression of pain).
Given its somatotopic organization, SI activity could therefore be involved in pain perception in two
ways. If we only see the painful reaction of a hand, the hand region of SI could reflect the intensity
of the observed reaction by simulating the movements of the hand and/or the somatosensory conse-
quences of the harm (Keysers et al., 2010). If we know that the painful stimulation originates from
the hand, but the intensity of the pain has to be inferred from the facial expressions, somatosensory
activation in the hand region could still reflect the intensity of the stimulation, through an indirect
route in which information derived from the facial expression is referred back onto the hand region
through a process akin to somatosensory imagery, or activation could instead fail to reflect pain
intensity. Either way, we could expect the more ventral representation of the face in SI to be
involved in representing the intensity of the facial expression (Adolphs et al., 2000; van der Gaag
et al., 2007), but less involved in representing the intensity of a painful hand movement when the
face is not visible.
To shed further light on the properties of the hand region of SI in the decision-making task pre-
sented in this study, we therefore designed two types of input stimuli that probe the above-men-
tioned scenarios, both showing different intensity of pain (Videos 1, 2, 3 and 4) in order to look at
quantitative relations between brain activity, perception and behavior (Wager et al., 2013). Specifi-
cally, participants witnessed a confederate receiving a noxious stimulation of randomly selected
intensity (InputMovie) delivered as (a) a swat with a belt on the right hand, with only the hand reac-
tion visible (Hand condition, Videos 1 and 2) or (b) an electroshock on the right hand with a visible
facial expression and no hand movement (Face condition, Videos 3 and 4). In both kinds of videos,
the confederate’s right hand receiving the painful stimulation was clearly visible on the screen, but in
the case of the belt (Hand condition) the reaction of the hand itself was the only cue for the

 participants to deduce the painfulness of the stimulation. By contrast, when receiving the electro-
shock (Face condition), the hand did not show any reaction and the painfulness was deduced only by
the confederate’s facial expression. At each trial, participants then received an endowment of 6e
and could reduce the intensity of the next noxious stimulation (OutputMovie) by giving up some of

 that money, knowing that the remainder would
be part of their compensation (Figure 1A and
Videos 1–6).
First, we investigated whether activation of
the hand region of the left SI, as measured with
EEG, explains prosocial behavior. The SI hand
region was identified in an independent pool of
participants by correlating fMRI BOLD responses
within SI with subjective experience of pain eli-
cited by electrical stimulations on the partici-
pant’s
right
hand.
We
hypothesized
that
activation of the hand region of SI would corre-
late with the donation given by the participants
in the Hand condition, when the intensity of the
stimulation had to be deduced from the hand
movement. In the Face condition, we predicted
that activity more ventrally in SI, where facial
expressions are represented, would correlate with the donation. We were able to make this predic-
tion because the relevance of facial mimicry has been highlighted in many studies (Oberman et al.,
2007; Hess and Fischer, 2013; Fischer and Hess, 2017; Wood et al., 2016b), because we know
that the ventral somatosensory cortex causally contributes to emotion perception from facial expres-
sion (Adolphs et al., 2000; Paracampo et al., 2017) and because we know that the emotions from
visually presented facial expressions requires ventral somatosensory-related cortices (Adolphs et al.,
2000). As mentioned above, for the hand region of SI during the Face condition, we had less
defined predictions: the presence or absence of correlation of SI hand region activity with the dona-
tion while perceiving facial expressions will inform whether facially deduced pain intensity is re-repre-
sented in the SI locations reflecting the inferred origin of that pain.
In a second experiment, we then perturbed the SI activity of the hand region with repetitive TMS
(rTMS) to test whether disturbing SI vicarious activity altered prosocial behavior. We expected TMS
over the hand-region of SI to disrupt the accuracy with which participants can transform the
observed kinematics of the belt and hand into an accurate perception of how painful this particular
stimulation was for the other. We had this expectation because disrupting SI activity using TMS or
neurological lesions has been shown to alter the accuracy with which participants perceive some
emotions (Adolphs et al., 2000; Paracampo et al., 2017) and hand actions (Valchev et al., 2017),
and because, in the nociceptive literature, SI has been associated more with perceptual than
with motivational processes (Keysers et al., 2010; Lee and Tracey, 2010). We thus expect decision-
making to become noisier, and less attuned to the level of pain experienced by the other on a trial-
by-trial basis, particularly when the reaction of the hand is the only source of information on which
the decision is based (Hand condition). This effect would be weaker or absent when information is
derived from the Face, where alternative sources of information are available.

 Finally, we used data from a third experiment
to explore whether a disruption of the percep-
tion of pain intensity does indeed mediate how
disrupting
SI
activity
alters
decision-making.
Brain activity in SI was altered using high-defini-
tion tDCS while participants had to rate how
much pain the person in the Hand and Face
movies
experienced
on
a
trial-by-trial
basis.
Because the specific montage used in this exper-
iment was expected to facilitate brain activity
under the anode placed over the SI hand region
and to inhibit brain activity under the return
cathodes, one of which was placed over the face
region of SI, we expected the accuracy of the
ratings to increase in the Hand stimuli and
to decrease in the Face stimuli.
Results
Experiment 1: EEG study
Participants (Table 1) donated on average the same amount in the Face and Hand conditions (Face:
M = 2.14e, SD = 1.2; Hand: M = 2.16e, SD = 1.2; dependent sample t-test t(28)=–0.2, p=0.8), but
comparing the standard deviation in donation within each participant showed more variability in
donation for the Face condition (Face: MSD = 1.47, SDSD = 0.44; Hand: MSD = 1.22, SDSD = 0.40;
dependent sample t-test t(28)=4, p=0.0004). To avoid this confound in further analysis, we Z-trans-
formed the donation of each participant separately for the two conditions.
To assess whether participants’ donation was driven by the intensity of the reaction shown in
the InputMovie, for each participant, we performed a robust linear regression (Holland and Welsch,
1977) between the intensity attributed to the movies by an independent pool of participants and
the Z-donation. The analysis confirmed that participants’ Z-donation closely followed the pain inten-
sity shown in the InputMovies (Figure 2A). In the Face condition, all participants had regression
slopes that were positive and significantly different from zero (Face slope: M = 0.48, SD = 0.6, aver-
age t value for Face slope = 21.9, SD = 17, all p<0.05; group one-sample t-test on Face slopes t
(28) = 37.9 p=0.0006E-21). In the Hand condition, one participant had a negative slope but the
regression was not significant (t = �0.17, p=0.8), a second participant had a positive but not signifi-
cant slope (t = 1.89, p=0.06), whereas the remaining participants all showed positive and significant
slopes (all p<0.05). We considered the former two as normal variation along the population spec-
trum and kept them in the analysis (Hand slope:
M = 0.45, SD = 1.4; average t value for Hand
slope = 7.4, SD = 5.4; group single sample t-test
on Hand slopes t(28) = 16.3 p=0.0001E–11).
Importantly, the average slope did not differ
between the two conditions (paired t-test t(28)=–
1 p=0.3).
To interrogate the electrical activity originat-
ing from the primary somatosensory cortex, we
used a linear constrained minimum variance
beam-forming
approach
(Van
Veen
et
al.,
1997), in which spatial filters were designed to
isolate brain electrical activity from the specified
locations of interest. To identify regions of SI
that reflect perceived pain intensity while partici-
pants experience pain on their own bodies, we
performed an independent fMRI experiment in
which participants received electrical stimulation

 at different intensities on their right hand and
reported how painful each stimulation was. We
then identified voxels in the left SI where the
BOLD signal correlated with reported painful-
ness (see ’Supplementary information, Pain local-
izer
experiment’),
and
used
the
following
clusters as ROIs for the EEG beam-forming anal-
ysis: a dorsal (dSI-L; peak at MNI(x,y,z) = �30,–36,
62) and a ventral (vSI-L; peak at MNI(x,y,z,) =
�54,–19, 32) somatosensory cluster (Figure 2B;
Maldjian et al., 1999; Mancini et al., 2012). The
ventral cluster has a dorso-ventral extent similar
to the face representation in SI but seems unusu-
ally posterior (Figure 2B; van der Gaag et al.,
2007). This suggests that the ventral cluster
could
originate
from
the
posterior
parietal
region PF or could represent the facial reaction
to the pain in SI. We focused on the left hemi-
sphere, because electrical stimulation was always
delivered to the right hand of both the confederate shown in the movies, and of the participants in
the pain localizer study.
For each participant and ROI, beam-forming returned activity time-courses along three standard
dipole directions. Given the low spatial resolution of EEG, the mixed orientation of cells in the
somatosensory cortex (encompassing gyri and sulci), and the fact that we use videos, for which the
dipole capturing most of the variance could change over time, we included all three dipole direc-
tions in multivariate analyses.
To assess whether EEG activity explained variance in participants’ donations, we used a random
effect, summary statistics approach routinely used in fMRI analysis (Holmes et al., 1998). First, at
the single subject level, we modelled the relationship between SI ROI activity and donation by calcu-
lating a robust regression between brain activity at a given time-point and the Z-donation for all the
trials of that participant (Figure 3A, left). Repeating this analysis for each time point generated a
time-course of the slope separately for each participant, condition and dipole (Figure 3A, right).
Second, at the group level, we analyzed the group distribution of these slopes: if EEG activity in an
ROI does not carry systematic information about the donation, the slopes would be randomly dis-
tributed around zero. To test this null hypothesis, we used the Hotelling’s t-squared statistic, a

all participants in a given condition and time-point. We controlled for multiple time point testing
using a cluster-based randomization test implemented in Field-Trip (Oostenveld et al., 2011), which

p=0.002) and between 458 and 476 ms (cluster-statistic = 91.4 ms, p=0.006) after the belt hits the
confederate’s hand. Activity in dSI-L also related to Z-donation in Face condition but later in time,
between 516 and 602 ms (cluster-statistic = 602.5 ms, p=0.0009), between 608 and 754 ms (cluster-
statistic = 333.8 ms, p=0.0009), and also between 808 and 880 ms (cluster-statistic = 330 ms,
p=0.0009) after the noxious stimulation was delivered. vSI-L brain activity explained Z-donation but
only in the Face condition in the time window between 402 and 430 ms (cluster-statistic = 102 ms,
p=0.005; Figure 3B).
To visualize this effect, we categorized the trials into low and high donation categories (median
split per participant) and calculated grand-averages voltage time courses during the InputMovie
(Figure 3C) for each dipole. The grand averages along Y and Z present a negative deflection after
the InputMovie onset independently of condition and donation, which probably reflects general
attentional processes. For the Hand condition, the dipoles further present a positive peak some milli-
seconds after the slap, which is sustained along Z and transient along X and Y. No clear peak is rec-
ognizable after the shock (time 0) during the Face condition. Differences between low and high

There is evidence for a bilateral receptive field in the Brodmann 1 and 2 sub-regions of SI
(Iwamura et al., 2002), and for the involvement of the right hemisphere in the perception of emo-
tion (not including pain) from facial expressions (Adolphs et al., 2000); bilateral activation reported
by Ashar et al., 2017; Lamm et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2015; Carr et al., 2003), and from hand move-
ments (Christov-Moore and Iacoboni, 2016). Figure 3D shows the signal originating from mirroring

 donation. For the hand region of SI (d-SI), results for the two hemispheres are very similar, suggest-
ing a lack of clear hemispheric specificity (Figure 3D and ’Supplementary Information’). For the
more ventral, putative face region of SI (v-SI), responses appear stronger on the right hemisphere, in
line with previous findings (Adolphs et al., 2000).
Our EEG findings therefore suggest that while witnessing the pain of another person, the magni-
tude of brain activity in the hand region of SI (d-SI) could inform decision-making. To examine
the causal contribution of this region to decision-making, in a second experiment, we used TMS to
disturb the activity of the SI hand region. We targeted the left hemisphere because it is contralateral
to the hand that is stimulated in the confederate.
Experiment 2: TMS study
A separate group of participants (Table 1) performed the costly helping paradigm for the Face and
Hand conditions under both active and sham rTMS over the left SI hand region.
The within-subject ANOVA with two factors, Condition (Face and Hand) and TMS (Active and
Sham), on the standard deviation calculated across the donation of each participant reveals that par-
ticipants varied their donations from trial-to-trial more in the Face than in the Hand condition (main
effect of condition F(1,14) = 98, p=0.001E–4), but there was no variance difference between the two
TMS protocols (main effect of TMS F(1,14) = 0.2, p=0.65, interaction between Condition and TMS
F(1,14) = 0.2, p=0.7). Therefore, the same Z-transformation of the donation was used as in Experiment
1, standardizing separately all of the donations of the Hand and Face conditions of each participant
(but without separating Active and Sham to preserve TMS effects).
TMS had no effect on the average Z-donation in either task, as indicated by the repeated ANOVA
with factor Condition (Face and Hand) and TMS (Active and Sham): TMS F(1,14) = 2.3, p=0.15, TMS x
Condition F(1,14) = 0.5, p=0.56. To test whether TMS interferes with the relationship between the
intensity of the movie and the donation, for each participant we calculated the slope between
the intensity of the movie and the Z-donation by means of a robust regression, separately for the
Condition (Face and Hand) and the TMS protocol (Sham and Active).
We then performed a two-factor repeated ANOVA on these slopes, using the above-mentioned
two-level summary statistic approach. The analysis showed that the slopes for the Face condition are
steeper than those for the Hand (Face: M = 0.56, SD = 0.06; Hand: M = 0.49, SD = 0.14; Main effect
of Condition: F(1,14) = 7, p=0.02). TMS did not have a general effect common to the two conditions
(Main effect of TMS: F(1,14) = 1.9, p=0.19). Interestingly, the ANOVA showed a significant interaction
effect (F(1,14) = 4.8, p=0.04, partial h2=0.25; Figure 2C) with a larger TMS effect in the Hand com-
pared to that in the Face condition. A Newman-Keuls post-hoc test indicated that active rTMS on SI
significantly flattened the relationship between intensity and donation only for the Hand condition
(Hand Sham M = 0.54, DS = 0.1; Hand TMS M = 0.45, DS = 0.2; p=0.02). There is no evidence for
such an effect in the Face condition (Face Sham M = 0.55, SD = 0.06; Face TMS M = 0.56,
SD = 0.06; p=0.6). To test whether the lack of effect in the Face condition was due to limited statisti-
cal power or whether it provides evidence for the null hypothesis (H0) of no (sizable) effect of TMS,

 we used Bayesian statistics. We calculated an index of TMS effect for each participant in the Face
condition as follows: slope in the Active session – slope in the Sham session. We then performed a
Bayesian one sample t-test using JASP with default priors (https://jasp-stats.org) that showed
that the null hypothesis is 5.7 times more likely than the alternative H1 (Bayes factor p[H0:index �0|
data]/p[H1:index <0|data]=5.7), providing positive evidence for the absence of a sizable effect in the
Face condition (Kass and Raftery, 1995).
The effect on the Hand condition did not correlate with any of the TMS side effects perceived by
the participant while performing the experiment (measured by questionnaire, all p>0.05). This sug-
gests that TMS on the SI hand representation interferes with the process that normally couples a
person’s donation to the needs of the other person (i.e. the observed pain intensity) when this need
is perceived through the movements of the affected body part (Hand condition), but this is less the
case when the need is perceived through facial expressions. To test whether the impact of TMS is
mediated by an effect on pain perception, we used data from a third experiment.
Experiment 3: HD-tDCS study
In this experiment, participants (Table 1) had to rate how much pain they perceived while watching
the Face and Hand videos under the effect of tDCS centered over left SI. The high density 4 � 1
electrodes tDCS montage that we used would be expected to have a facilitatory effect on the hand
region of SI under the anode (Figure 2D), and a weaker inhibitory effect on ventral SI, including the
face representation, under one of the four return cathodes. To control for unspecific effects on inten-
sity rating processes unrelated to pain in this experiment, we introduced a new type of video in
which participants needed to rate color saturation intensity (Color condition, Figure 1B).
A 2 Stimulation (tDCS and Sham) x 3 Condition (Face, Hand and Color) repeated measures
ANOVA on the standard deviation calculated for the participants’ rating reveals that participants did
not use the rating scale differently in the three conditions (main effect of condition F(1,24) = 0.4,
p=0.5), nor between the two tDCS sessions (main effect of Stimulation F(1,48) = 2, p=0.1, interaction
between Condition and Stimulation F(1,48) = 0.6, p=0.5). To be consistent between our studies,
we applied Z-transformation of the ratings separately for the three conditions but while pooling the
two tDCS conditions. A Stimulation (tDCS and Sham) x Condition (Face, Hand and Color) ANOVA
on the average rating revealed that average rating remained stable across conditions (Stimulation
F(1,24) = 0.5, p=0.5; Condition F(1,48) = 0.8, p=0.5; Interaction F(1,48) = 0.3, p=0.7). For each condition
and session, we then correlated the intensity assigned to the movies during the validation process
and the Z-rating given by the participant. The correlation values were normalized using the Fisher
z-transformation. We then performed a two-factor repeated ANOVA on the correlation coefficients
obtained. The analysis showed that the correlation coefficients differed between conditions (Face:
M = 1.3, SD = 0.2; Hand: M = 1, SD = 0.2; Color: M = 1.2, SD = 0.3; Main effect of Condition:
F(2,48) = 17, p<0.002E–3). A post-Hoc Newman-Keuls test revealed that the Hand condition had a
lower correlation coefficient than both the Face and Color conditions, while the latter did not differ
from each other. tDCS had no main effect on the correlation coefficients (main effect of tDCS
F(2,48) = 0.5, p=0.5). Interestingly, tDCS had a different effect depending on the conditions (Interac-
tion: F(2,48) = 3.4, p=0.04, h2=0.12). Planned paired t-test comparison between sham and tDCS ses-
sion for each condition indicated that the tDCS on SI significantly improved the relationship
between intensity and rating for the Hand condition (Hand Sham: M = 1, DS = 0.2; Hand tDCS:
M = 1.1, DS = 0.2, t(24) = –2, p=0.04), while it showed a trend for reduction in the Face condition
(Face Sham: M = 1.3, DS = 0.2; Face tDCS: M = 1.2, DS = 0.2; t(24) = 1.8 p=0.07), and no appreci-
able change in the Color condition (Color Sham: M = 1.3, DS = 0.2; Color tDCS: M = 1.2, DS = 0.3;
t(24) = 1, p=0.3). Again, to test whether the lack of effect in the Color condition supports the null
hypothesis, we calculated an index of the stimulation effect by subtracting the z-transformed correla-
tion score calculated in sham from the one calculated in the real tDCS session. As Hand and Face
conditions showed opposite effects, we performed a 2-tailed one sample Bayesian t-test on the
Color condition. The Bayes factor indicated that the H0 was 3.1 times more likely than the H1, con-
firming that the Color condition does not change after HD-tDCS. The Hand and Face effects did not
correlate with any of the tDCS side effects perceived by participants while performing the experi-
ment (all p>0.05).

 Discussion
We used a helping task in which brain activity could be related to prosocial behavior on a trial-by-
trial basis, and concentrated on measuring and altering activity in the hand region of SI, to shed light
on the contribution of this region to prosocial decision-making.
Specifically, we localized regions in the left SI that encode the intensity of pain experienced by a
group of participants using fMRI. This evidenced two clusters in the left SI: a dorsal cluster corre-
sponding to the hand representation of SI and a ventral cluster that had a dorso-ventral extent simi-
lar to the face representation of SI. These ROIs served as the ROIs for our EEG experiment, which
showed that the magnitude of brain activity originating from the dorsal cluster had a significant rela-
tionship with helping. This was true whether victims expressed their reaction through their afflicted
body part or through their face. Figure 3 shows how the timing of that activity followed the timing
of the information in the movies: the hand immediately retracts at the moment the belt hits the
hand, and SI activity had a sharp and sudden peak in explanatory power, whereas the facial expres-
sion develops more slowly after the shock is delivered, and SI activity showed a more progressive
and sustained explanatory power. Figure 3 also shows that the ventral and dorsal sector of our func-
tionally localized SI nociceptive representation behave differently in our task, with the dorsal (hand)
ROI explaining donation for either source of information (Face or Hand) and the ventral (face) ROI
being explanatory only for facial expressions.
The choice to interrogate the signal during pain observation within regions coding the intensity
of pain during self-pain experience was, as mentioned in the introduction, dictated by the theoretical
framework of emotional contagion and vicarious activity. In this framework, the activation of cells
involved in experiencing pain during the observation of other people’s pain would help someone to
‘feel’ what another person is experiencing by inducing a psychological state similar to that to which
these neurons contribute during the experience of pain. FMRI overlaps between the experience and
observation of pain have been widely documented, and taken as support for such a framework
(Keysers et al., 2010; Lamm et al., 2011). This notion was recently in the focus of debate because
of mixed results from multi-voxels pattern analyses (Zaki et al., 2016; Corradi-Dell’’Acqua et al.,
2016; Krishnan et al., 2016). The logic of these analyses is to identify a pattern across voxels that
discriminates different intensities of experienced pain from fMRI signals. If pain observation triggers
a neuronal representation of felt pain, the logic goes, the same pattern should discriminate different
intensities of observed pain — so-called above-chance cross-modal classification. Some scientists
find this to be true (Corradi-Dell’’Acqua et al., 2016), others not (Krishnan et al., 2016). It is impor-
tant to realize, however, that a region may have neurons involved in experiencing and observing
pain, as our framework predicts, without significant cross-modal classification of fMRI signals
(Zaki et al., 2016): decades of work on mirror neurons for actions show that only 10% of neurons
involved in performing an action become recruited while observing that action (Gallese et al., 1996;
Keysers et al., 2003; Mukamel et al., 2010). If the same is true for pain, only 10% of neurons
involved in pain experience may also be recruited during pain observation. This low percentage
means that a pattern classifier trained on pain experience would be dominated by the signals origi-
nating from the 90% of neurons that are not involved in pain observation, and would then fail to
interrogate the 10% involved in observation reliably when tested with pain-observation data.
Until we have systematic single-cell data during the experience and observation of pain
(Hutchison et al., 1999), it will not become clear whether neurons represent felt and observed pain
reliably (Zaki et al., 2016). Accordingly, our finding that signals from a region of SI involved in actual
pain experience explains variance in helping in our paradigm is compatible with the notion that this
signal originates from neurons also involved in pain experience. Alternatively, the signal could origi-
nate from neurons not involved in pain experience that are simply spatially intertwined with those
involved in pain experience (Zaki et al., 2016; Keysers and Gazzola, 2009). In this manuscript,
when we speak of vicarious pain activations, we therefore mean activations of regions involved in
pain experience during the observation of the pain of others, without having the means to assess
whether this activation originates from the neurons that are involved in actual pain experience.
When pain is expressed by the reaction of the hand, the dorsal SI hand region activation corre-
lates with decision-making (EEG). In addition, altering this activity changes (TMS) decision-making,
suggesting that the SI hand region activation feeds into the decision-making process. When pain is
expressed by the face, the SI hand region activation correlates with decision-making (EEG) but

 altering this activity influences decision-making less. This latter finding is compatible with three inter-
pretations. (i) Activity in the hand-region of SI is an epiphenomenon, representing an imagination of
what the painful stimulation would have felt on the hand (Fairhurst et al., 2012), which is not used
in decision-making. (ii) The SI hand region activity is used for decision-making in the sham condition,
but can be substituted by alternative sources of information derived from the face elsewhere in the
brain in the active TMS condition. Both of these interpretations are reminiscent of the notion that
pain information takes different paths depending on the stimulus it is derived from (Keysers et al.,
2010; Lamm et al., 2011). (iii) Information in the SI hand region has a higher signal to noise ratio in
the Face condition than in the Hand condition, making it less susceptible to TMS interference.
Our results show that trial-by-trial amplitude of the EEG activity from ventral SI significantly
explains changes in donation in the Face condition only. This effect could be driven by a covert inter-
nal simulation of the other’s facial expression or by overt facial mimicry. Interfering with facial mim-
icry has been shown to impair visual recognition of expressions (Oberman et al., 2007; Wood et al.,
2016a) and interfering with activity in ventral somatosensory cortex alters the recognition
of emotion from faces (Adolphs et al., 2000; Paracampo et al., 2017). Future research should
neuro-modulate brain activity in ventral SI in addition to the hand representation we targeted here,
while measuring the willingness to help in order to further investigate the dissociation suggested by
our
results.
The

as
a
focal
neuro-modulation
method
(Mueller et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015, 2016) could enable such studies without the muscle artefacts
that are inevitable with TMS. HD-tDCS, as used in our third experiment, also has the advantage
of not causing muscle twitches, but lacks the focality needed to allow a confident argument that one
can disentangle the contributions of the face and hand regions that are located only 2 cm apart.
In the Hand movie, movements are displayed both in the first half of the video by the agent
wielding the belt and in the second half by the victim’s hand being compressed by and reacting to
the swat. Activity in SI has been shown to have the potential to encode all of these (Keysers et al.,
2010). Interestingly, SI activity significantly predicted the donation only during the second half, in
which the victim’s hand is compressed by the belt and reacts to it. This suggests that it is SI’s ability
to represent the impact of the belt on the hand or the reaction of the victim to the stimulation on
the hand that induced the prosocial decision-making.
Furthermore, we addressed the issue of how SI contributes to decision-making, leveraging a third
HD-tDCS experiment that allowed us to discriminate between perceptual or motivational contribu-
tions. Our results suggest that SI activation in the hand region contributes to prosocial decision-mak-
ing by transforming the sight of hand-movements caused by a swat into a perception of pain-
intensity, which then serves as an input to a decision-making process elsewhere. If this trial-by-trial
perception is perturbed, our decision to help no longer optimally follows the trial-by-trial variance in
pain experienced by others. This function is similar to the function that SI has during the observation
of actions. For instance, disturbing the activity of the SI hand region with TMS makes ratings of the
weight of an object seen lifted noisier than in a sham condition, suggesting that the region is neces-
sary for transforming observed hand kinematics into an estimate of the forces that have been acting
on the hand (Valchev et al., 2017). Similar kinematic analysis may underpin the transformation of
the observed hand kinematics following the swat into a painfulness estimate in our Hand condition.
Affective social reactions, be they personal distress or empathic concern, would be informed by this
kinematic analysis in SI, but require additional processes that the pain experience literature would
ascribe to the anterior insula and cingulate (Lee and Tracey, 2010). In this interpretation, a neural
network including SI informs the participant on how intense the swat was on a given trial, and deter-
mines the ability of the participant to adjust the donation to the circumstances of a specific trial. By
contrast, the mean donation could reflect trait differences in empathic concern (measured by the
Interpersonal Reactive Index [Davis, 1983]) and money attitude (Yamauchi and Templer, 1982)
(’Supplemental analysis — Correlation with self-reported questionnaires’). A more in-depth under-
standing of what emotional feelings (pain-like personal distress vs. more positively valenced
empathic concern) accompany the motivational effect of SI activation on high-pain trials remains
unclear from our data, and could be studied in future research by asking participants to provide spe-
cific ratings of their own affect on a trial-by-trial basis.
In summary, we provide evidence that activity in the hand region of SI that occurs while witness-
ing the bodily reactions of a victim to a painful stimulation is not only correlated with the willingness
to help but significantly influences prosocial decision-making. Our data further constrain the

 mechanisms through which SI influences prosocial decision-making by showing that altering SI activ-
ity also influences the perception of other people’s pain intensity. This suggests that the role of SI is
to help us transform the kinematics of affected body-parts into a perception of pain, which is then a
significant input to a decision-making process that occurs elsewhere in the brain. If pain is not
expressed through the affected body part but communicated through facial expressions, SI activity
in the somatotopic representation of the initially affected body-part no longer seems to be a neces-
sary input to this decision-making. These neuromodulation findings support the notion derived from
neuroimaging literature that multiple networks, depending on the nature of the stimulus, can be
recruited during the perception of the pain of others (Keysers et al., 2010; Lamm et al., 2011).
Future studies will be needed to isolate and characterize the causal contribution and interaction
across the nodes of these networks, and to further characterize the conditions under which each net-
work is necessary. An empirical foundation for the intuitively attractive and often suggested causal
links between the ability to represent what other people feel and prosocial actions is provided by
the evidence that SI vicarious activations directly influence prosociality.
Methods and material
Participants
A total of 169 healthy, right-handed volunteers, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, (mean
age = 25 +/– 5 SD) were recruited for our studies (Table 1). Because previous studies reported that
racial biases modulate empathy (Xu et al., 2009; Avenanti et al., 2010; Cikara et al., 2014) and
our videos showed a Caucasian confederate, only Caucasian individuals were recruited. All partici-
pants received monetary compensation and gave their informed consent for participation in the
study. None of the participants reported neurological, psychiatric, or other medical problems or any
contraindication to fMRI, TMS or tDCS (Rossini et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 2009). No discomfort or
adverse TMS effects were reported by the participants or noticed by the experimenter. Table 1 sum-
marizes the number and characteristics of the participants for each study.
All studies have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Amsterdam, The
Netherlands (project identifiers: 2016-BC-7394, 2016-BC-7130, 2017-EXT-8467, 2016-PSY-6485,
2014-EXT-3476, and 2014-EXT-3432). All participants received monetary compensation and gave
their informed consent for participation in the study. Consent authorization for the publication
of images has been obtained.
Costly helping experimental set-up
Central to our task was the aim of inducing an effective, naturalistic moral dilemma, in which the
state induced by witnessing the distress of another individual is pitched against financial rewards.
The other person’s distress was elicited by delivering electroshocks or slaps on the right-hand dor-
sum. To limit the total number of shocks or slaps delivered throughout the experiments and to avoid
uncontrollable variance in the reactions of the victim, we developed a cover story. Each participant
was made to believe that she/he would be paired to another participant, with whom she/he will
draw lots to decide who would play the role of the observer and who of the pain-taker. The observer
and the pain-taker will be allocated to separate adjacent rooms, connected through a video camera.
While the pain-taker would receive the electroshocks and slaps, the observer would have an EEG
recorded while they witnessed the reaction of the pain-taker to the stimulations (Experiment 1) or
while brain stimulation was delivered over SI (Experiment 2). In reality, the lots were manipulated in
such a way that the confederate would always be selected as the pain-taker and the participant as
the observer. In addition, participants were misled to think that the noxious stimulations were deliv-
ered to the confederate in real-time, and that what the participants saw on the monitor was a live
feed from the pain-taker’s room. In reality, we presented prerecorded videos of face and hand reac-
tions to noxious stimuli previously delivered to the confederate (Videos 1, 2, 3 and 4). The confeder-
ate’s appearance during the experiment was carefully matched to the pre-recorded videos. The
exact setup shown in the videos was recreated at every session, including the belt and electric stimu-
lator used, and shown to the participants. Face and Hand videos were shown in separate sessions
(order randomized across participants), with a long break in between. During the break, participants

 could move, leave the experimental room and, importantly, briefly interact with the confederate.
This short break helped to maintain the cover story.
The choice to use a cover story was dictated by (i) pilot data showing that relaxing the cover-
story, for instance by acknowledging that the confederate was in fact an experimenter, led to a nota-
ble reduction in donation, and (ii) the effort to keep the variance introduced by having different vic-
tims at a minimum, facilitating group analyses. In addition, our initial piloting also revealed that
testing participants over multiple days led to increased skepticism, which was why we decided to
use different pools of participants for each experiment, and why we had to limit the number of trials
in the TMS study to what could fit a within subject design.
At the end of the costly helping paradigm, participants answered the question ‘Do you think the
experimental setup was realistic enough to believe it’ on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree). Five was used as cut off to discriminate participants who believed in the cover story
from those who did not, and participant’s who reported four or less were excluded from the analy-
ses. The credibility values for the whole sample of participants are shown in Figure 1—figure Sup-
plement 1.
Costly helping visual stimuli
Two types of 2 s long videos were generated (Figure 1A). The Hand-videos depicted the confeder-
ate’s right hand reactions to a slap delivered by a brown leather belt (procedure adapted from
Meffert et al. [2013]). The hand, right arm and shoulder are the confederate’s only visible body
parts. While the belt was visible, the hand holding it only entered the field of view marginally at
times, and was covered by a black glove to blend in with the black background. The videos started
with the belt laying on the hand dorsum. The slap occurred at the end of the first second, during
which the belt would be lifted and prepared to hit. Videos ended one second after the slap, after
showing the hand and shoulder reaction. A total of 200 Hand-videos were recorded by varying the
intensity of the slap at every trial, with 30 s between each trial. The Face-videos showed the actor’s
facial expressions in response to an electroshock delivered to the right-hand dorsum. The upper
part of her body was clearly visible on a black background. Even though the stimulation was given to
her hand and the hand was visible, the hand did not move in response to the shock making the face
the main source of information about the stimulation intensity. The videos started with the face in a
neutral expression. During the first second, the expression was kept neutral until the stimulation
occurred.
Both the hand and face movies were centered not on the moment in which the noxious stimula-
tion was delivered but on the reaction of the actor to them. In the Hand videos, the central frame
was the one in which the belt hit the hand with consequent immediate reaction of the hand. In the
Face videos, the central frame was the one in which the facial expression began to change (i.e. at +1
s from the beginning of the movie).
A total of 392 Face videos were recorded. The electrical stimulation was a 100 Hz train of electri-
cal pulses of 2 ms pulse duration (square pulse waveform) delivered via a bipolar concentric surface
electrode (stimulation areas: 16 mm2). The electrodes were attached to the skin with tape, which
was also left in place during the Hand-video recording. A black ‘X’ was drawn on the tape to clearly
show the electrode’s position. Each stimulation lasted 1000 ms and varied in current intensity, which
ranged from 0.2 mA to 8.0 mA. Thirty seconds were left between stimulations. Current intensity was
determined prior to video recording, by following a procedure well established in the literature
(de Vignemont and Singer, 2006; Cui et al., 2015): starting from 0.1 mA, the current was gradually
increased until reaching a maximum of 8.0 mA in increments of 0.2 mA. The actor was instructed to
evaluate how painful each stimulation was on a 10-point scale, and the current intensities to be used
during video recording were chosen according to a maximum perceived intensity of 8. The actor
was the same Caucasian woman for all of the videos and experiments: author SG who played the
confederate role. The videos were recorded using a Sony DSR-PDX10P Camcorder (Sony, Minato,
Tokyo, Japan), and were edited using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA).
The 392 videos that were generated were validated by an independent group of 40 participants
who did not participate in the other experiments (Table 1). Hand and Face videos were presented
(OkazoLab Ltd, 2012) in separate blocks, counterbalanced across participants. Participants were
instructed to observe them and to report the perceived pain intensity that the person in the video
felt, using the same 10-point scale employed in the pain-threshold assessment. Average ratings

 were computed and rounded off. The results yielded six different movie categories with average
pain intensities perceived as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 out of 10. Of those, we selected different subsam-
ples for each experiment on the basis of the following two criteria: (a) a low standard deviation in
rating across participants ensuring that a specific pain intensity was communicated reliably, and (b)
maximized the statistical power of the regression (i.e. privileging movies at the extremes of the
intensity range). For the EEG task, we privileged the criterion (b) and included a larger number of tri-
als to reduce neural habituation (95 trials in total). For the TMS experiment, we privileged criterion
(a) to maximize the sensitivity to small changes in perceptual accuracy, and only used those movies
in which ratings were most concordant (Table 2). In both the EEG and TMS experiments, the Face
and Hand conditions did not differ in average perceived intensity (EEG: MFace = 3.7, SD = 1.7; MHand
= 4, SD = 1.4; t(93) = 0.88, p=0.4. TMS: MFace = 3.8, SD = 1.6; MHand = 3.9, SD = 1.2; t-test t(118) =
�0.26, p=0.9) or standard deviation (EEG: F(42,51) = 1.49, p=0.09; TMS: F(14,14 ) = 1.67, p=1.17).
Because the intensity of the OutputMovie depended on the participant’s donation, it was impos-
sible to precisely predict the number of videos needed for each intensity and participant. This means
that in some cases, the number of recorded videos was lower than the number of actual presenta-
tions of a particular intensity, and few videos had to be shown more than once. Care was taken to
maximize the distance between repetitions of the same stimulus. The number of repeated videos is
low and it was never the case that a participant saw all of the movies twice. During debriefing, we
asked our participants to indicate on a seven step scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly
agree) how well the following statement applied to them: ‘You think you saw the same movie twice.’
On average, participants in the EEG experiment reported a value of 6.1 (Figure 1—figure Supple-
ment 1), whereas those in the TMS experiment reported a value of of 6.3, suggesting that movie
repetition was not easily recognized by our participants.
Costly helping paradigm
For the participant, each trial of the costly helping paradigm started with a 1 s red fixation cross, fol-
lowed by a video showing the actor’s reaction to the first stimulation (InputMovie, Figure 1A), the
intensity of which was randomly determined by the computer. Participants then received an endow-
ment of 6e, and had to decide whether to donate all or part of this money to reduce the intensity of
the following stimulation. Participants knew, that every 1e donated reduced the intensity by one
unit, and that money was not donated directly to the confederate, who did not have monetary bene-
fit from the donation. Instead, 10% of the money not donated was added as a ‘bonus’ to partici-
pants’ compensation for taking part in the study. InputMovie intensity varied from trial to trial to
cover the entire range from 2 to 7, and was randomly chosen. Participants’ implicit task was to infer
the intensity of the stimulation from the confederate’s reaction. Participants selected the donation
amount by moving a rectangle along a bar with possible donations (0e to 6e). The starting position
of the cursor was randomized to avoid motor preparation of the response. Participants were

 instructed to use a two-pedal controller with their right foot to select the donation (USB Double
Foot Switch II, Scythe Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). We used a foot-pedal rather than a traditional but-
ton-box because SI activity in the hand region, critical for this experiment, may otherwise have been
contaminated by the planning/performance of the button-presses. After three seconds without
pressing any pedal, the software would select the current position of the rectangle as the chosen
donation and move to the following black screen, which had a random duration from 1.5 to 3 s.
Finally, depending on the donation, 2 s feedback video (OutputMovie) showed the confederate’s
response to the second stimulation. OutputMovie would represent the end of a trial. A 5 s black
screen separated consecutive trials.
EEG study
For the entire duration of the costly helping paradigm, electrophysiological brain signals were
recorded from 64 active channels (10–20 positioning) by an ActiCHamp Brain Vision system. The
ground electrode was placed on Fz. Electrode impedances were kept below 5 kW, and all signals
were digitized (rate of 500 Hz) and stored for off-line processing. All data analyses were performed
using the FieldTrip Toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011) and customized MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA) scripts. The signals were low-pass filtered at 60 Hz and band-stop filtered within
the range of 49.5–50.5 Hz, and harmonics were used to eliminate the electrical line noise. The data
were re-referenced to a common average and segmented in epochs of 7 s, containing 5 s before
InputMovie onset and lasting until InputMovie end. The segmented signals were visually inspected
across all channels. Trials containing muscular and other non-ocular movement artifacts were dis-
carded. The artifact rejection procedure resulted in 41.9 ± 1.7 artifact-free trials in the Hand task and
50.6 ± 1.9 in the Face task. Blinks and eye movements were corrected using Independent Compo-
nent Analysis (Jung et al., 2000). Each trial was then baseline corrected using the average of the sig-
nal from 400 to 200 ms before the appearance of the fixation cross.
We used a linear constrained minimum variance beam-former approach (Van Veen et al., 1997).
We used a three-layer BEM volume conductance model of 1 cm3 resolution as the forward model
(Figure 2B, Oostenveld et al., 2003). For each participant, we used the BEM model together with
the covariate matrix of the ERP (entire trial length, obtained by averaging all of the videos belonging
to each condition) to create an adaptive spatial filter such that its inverse applied to the sensor level
representation would reconstruct the source power with maximum strength at the location of the
source of interest, and would suppress the output from the sources of no-interest. To derive the
complex source estimates, the time-course of each trial was multiplied with the real-valued filters.
The procedure resulted in three orthogonal dipoles within each ROI, oriented in the three spatial
dimensions. We constructed our filters separately for the Face and Hand sessions to account for the
possibility that the noise structure changed during the long pause (~20 min) separating the two ses-
sions. This maximized our ability to compare different trials from the same session to establish
whether donation and brain activity are related within a condition, but reduced our ability to com-
pare the two conditions directly.
To test whether brain activity in the ROIs while watching the videos could explain the Z-donation,
we first conducted a mass-univariate robust regression analysis (within subjects) with the brain activ-
ity as the predictor variable and Z-donation as the observed variable. This was done separately for
each time point, dipole, task, subject and ROI. Robust regression was chosen to be less sensitive to
outliers in the data (Wager et al., 2005). The regression slopes of this subject level analysis were
then subjected to Hotelling’s T-Squared test (Ht2) at the group level. This is a multivariate test
that examines whether the average slopes for the three dipoles are all zero. This test was repeated
for each time point, condition and ROI. The family-wise error rate arising from multiple comparison
of time-points was dealt with by using a cluster-based non-parametric Monte-Carlo correction.
Neighboring values exceeding the cluster-cutting threshold (corresponding to Ht2 >4.675 and
punc <0.01) were combined into a single cluster. Cluster-level statistics were computed by compar-
ing the summed Ht2 values of each cluster against a permutation distribution. The permutation dis-
tribution was constructed by randomly flipping the sign of all of the slopes of randomly selected
participants (1000 iterations) and by calculating the maximum group cluster statistic for each itera-
tion. The null distribution of the cluster-based test statistic was obtained by taking the most extreme
value of the statistic in each permutation. The cluster-based test statistic in the observed data was
then associated with a corrected pseudo-p value based on its percentile in the null distribution for

 each cluster. Furthermore, we corrected for four ROIs (two left and two right mirror ROIs) and two
conditions tested using a Bonferroni correction of 6 (Figure 3), leading to a pseudo-p-value of
0.0063 as the cut-off for the cluster-based test statistic.
TMS study
Sample size for the TMS experiment was determined though a power analysis conducted using
G*Power 3 (Faul et al., 2007), with power (1 – b) set at 0.95 and a = 0.05. The effect size was cho-
sen on the basis of the work of Paracampo et al. (2017) (Cohen’s d = 0.94), because this work was
conducted by the experimenter who was also responsible for the TMS part of the work described in
the current manuscript (RP), and because the Paracampo et al. (2017) study involved a task that
made similar cognitive demands, used an equivalent rTMS protocol, and targeted the same brain
region (SI). A comparable effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.89) was found when taking into account TMS
studies in which participants are required to observe others and understand their behavior
(Paracampo et al., 2017, 2018; Valchev et al., 2017; Tidoni et al., 2013). In our within subjects
study, we hypothesed a perturbation of the activity in SI, and therefore a reduction in performance
as a consequence of the perturbation, so we conducted a power analysis to compare performance
in active stimulation with performance in sham stimulation using a matched paired one-tailed t-test
at the second (group) level. This analysis yielded a required sample size of 15 participants.
TMS was administered using a figure-of-eight coil (diameter: 70 mm) connected to a Magstim
Rapid2 stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, Dyfed, UK). To set rTMS intensity and to determine coil loca-
tion, the resting motor threshold (rMT) was estimated for all participants in a preliminary phase of
the experiment using standard procedures (Rossi et al., 2009). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)
induced by stimulation of the left motor cortex were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous
(FDI) by means of a Biopac MP-35. EMG signals were band-pass filtered (30–500 Hz) and digitized
(sampling rate: 5 kHz). Pairs of Ag-AgCl surface electrodes (Ø35mm) were placed in a belly-tendon
montage with a ground electrode on the wrist. The intersection of the coil was placed tangentially
to the scalp with the handle pointing backward and laterally at a 45˚ angle away from the midline.
The rMT was defined as the minimal intensity of stimulator output that produces MEPs with an
amplitude of at least 50 mV in the FDI with 50% probability (Rossini et al., 2015). After the rMT pro-
cedure, the optimal scalp location for the hand representation in the left motor cortex was marked.
A large body of evidence shows that the hand area in the somatosensory cortex can be success-
fully targeted by positioning the coil 1–4 cm posterior to the motor hotspot (Harris et al., 2002;
Balslev et al., 2004; Merabet et al., 2004; Fiorio and Haggard, 2005; Tegenthoff et al., 2005;
Bufalari et al., 2007; Azan
˜o
´n and Haggard, 2009; Jacquet and Avenanti, 2015; Valchev et al.,
2017). This approach is based on the close correspondence between the motor and somatic homun-
culi (Buccino et al., 2001; Yang et al., 1994; Schulz et al., 2004; Nakamura et al., 1998;
Amunts and Zilles, 2015; Kuehn et al., 2014). In line with this, we identified our region of interest
using a two-step procedure. First, we localized the hand region in the primary motor cortex, corre-
sponding to the optimal scalp position (OSP) for evoking MEPs in the FDI muscle. After that, we
moved the coil 2 cm backward following a parasagittal plane, assuming that this displacement would
not produce effects on M1. We tested this assumption directly by checking that TMS pulses applied
at 105% rMT with the coil in the final target position did not elicit any detectable MEPs. To rule out
any possible interference with the primary motor cortex, intensity for the rTMS was set at 90% of the
resting motor threshold. Moreover, before the rTMS session, the position of the coil over the SI-L
was verified by applying single pulses of TMS to ensure that no muscle activity was associated with
our repetitive stimulations. While performing the costly helping paradigm, a time-locked single train
of subthreshold 6 Hz rTMS (12 pulses, 2 s) was delivered (Tidoni et al., 2013; Paracampo et al.,
2017), starting at the onset of the movie and thus covering its entire duration. During active rTMS
blocks, the intersection of the coil was placed tangentially to the scalp directly above the scalp loca-
tion of the target region with the handle pointing backward and laterally at a 45˚ angle away from
the midline. Sham rTMS blocks were performed by tilting the coil by 90˚ over the same target
region, to provide some scalp sensations and TMS sounds comparable to active stimulation but with-
out inducing a current in the brain.
The general procedure of the experiment was the same as that for Experiment 1, except for
changes in the number of trials and in the video presented, which were necessary to adapt the task
to the TMS (sham vs active) set-up. Participants underwent a total of 60 trials for Face Condition and

 60 trials for Hand condition. The conditions were presented in four blocks (two blocks for the Face
and two for the Hand condition), separated by a long break in the middle in which participants fur-
ther interacted with the confederate. Each block was equally divided into two parts, which were
assigned to active and sham TMS in a pseudo-randomized order (e.g. for one participant: Active-
TMSFaceBlock1part1, ShamTMSFaceBlock1part2, ShamHandBlock1part2, ActiveHandBlock1part2,
long break, ActiveHandBlock2part1, ShamHandBlock2part2, ActiveFaceBlock2part2, ShamFace-
Block2part1). Although some videos might have been shown twice within block1 or block2, videos in
block1 were different from those in block2. At the end of the experimental session, participants had
to rate from 1 to 4 how much headache, neck stiffness, itching on the skin, pain on the skin below
the stimulation site, sleepiness and mood-swing they experienced, and whether it was difficult to
concentrate. Answers were then compared with the TMS effect in the two tasks by calculating the
difference in slopes between the Active and the Sham Condition and by correlating this difference
with the answer to these questions across participants. Results were corrected for multiple compari-
son and found to be non-significant.
HD-tDCS study
For this experiment, in addition to the Face and Hand movies, a new set of videos was created, in
which no pain was depicted but the color saturation changed over time (Figure 1B, and Videos 5–
6). To match the temporal dynamic of the Hand and Face videos, the saturation change started after
1 s from the beginning of the videos and reached its peak 0.5 s afterwards. Videos were created
with three different levels of saturation changes. An independent group of 20 participants (Table 1)
watched Color, Face and Hand videos (presented using EventIDE; OkazoLab Ltd., 2012), and rated
from 1 to 10 how painful the stimulation was for the person in the Face and Hand videos, and how
much the saturation changed in the Color videos. Using their left hand, they moved a rectangle
along a bar with possible ratings, from 0 to 10. The starting position of the cursor was randomized
to avoid motor preparation of the response. The validation procedure resulted in a total of 32 videos
per category matched for average rating (F(2,93)=0.2, p=0.8) and accuracy, calculated as the square
of the difference from the expected value (F(2,93)=0.4, p=0.6).
Sample size for the tDCS experiment was determined though a power analysis conducted using
G*Power 3 (Faul et al., 2007), with power (1 – b) set at 0.95 and a = 0.05. We expected a small
effect size on the basis of recent transcranial electrical stimulation experiments (Bolognini et al.,
2013; Avenanti et al., 20172018). In these studies, the somatosensory cortices were targeted, and
similar design and task requirements were used. This analysis yielded a required sample size of 26
participants (Table 1).
1.5 mA was delivered to the left primary somatosensory cortex for 18 min through a 4 � 1 ring-
electrode set-up consisting of a central active anode and four surrounding return electrodes
(Kuo et al., 2013); Figure 2D), which were connected to a battery-operated tDCS MXN-9 High-Defi-
nition (HD) Stimulator (Soterix Medical Inc., USA). The HD-tDCS electrodes were fixed to a cap by
means of HD-tDCS electrode holders, with the central anode placed over the primary somatosensory
cortex, between the EEG electrode sites C3 and CP3. The HD-tDCS electrodes’ impedance was
kept below 10 kW. Throughout the stimulation, the participant was sitting comfortably in an arm
chair.
Participants received both real and sham stimulations on two different days, separated by an
average of 7.8 days (SD = 3). After the sham and real stimulations, participants performed the rating
task as in the validation procedure. Each trial started with the presentation of a white fixation cross
(1 s), which was followed by the video clip (2 s), and finally the visual analogue scale. Using their left
hand, participants moved a rectangle along the scale using two keys (one for moving the rectangle
to the right, one to the left). A third key was pressed to confirm the intensity selection. A variable
interval of between 2800 and 3200 ms separated the trials. Videos were presented in six blocks (two
per task) containing multiple intensities. Block presentation order was randomized among partici-
pants and among sessions.
After both the real and the sham sessions, participants rated from 1 to 4 how much headache,
neck stiffness, itching on the skin, pain on the skin below the stimulation site, sleepiness and mood-
swing they experienced, and whether it was difficult to concentrate.

Pain localizer and region of interest definition
An fMRI experiment (Pain Localizer) was performed to identify areas of the somatosensory
cortex that encode the subjective intensity of pain stimulation. These regions were then
interrogated via beamforming during the costly helping paradigm. Twenty-five participants
(age mean = 24, SD = 5.6, nine males) with no reported neurological, psychiatric or other
medical problems, and no contraindication to fMRI, participated in the experiment. No
discomfort was reported by participants or noticed by the experimenter. All participants were
paid for their participation. The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the
University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Participants underwent a total of 40 electrical and
40 mechanical stimulations, split into eight runs (four electrical and four mechanical) of ten
(five high intensity and five low intensity) stimulations each, while BOLD changes were
recorded. High and low stimulations were delivered in a pseudo-randomized order (with no
more than two consequential stimulations of the same intensity) on the participant’s right hand
using a MRI-compatible stimulation system (DS7A stimulator - Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden
City, Hertfordshire, UK). After a random interval ranging from 2 to 5 s, a question mark
appeared on the screen and participants were asked to report their pain intensity by selecting,
with their left hand, 1 of 4 available buttons. Each button corresponded to a double step on a
scale from 1 to 10, in which one corresponded to a non-painful stimulation and 10 the most
intense imaginable pain. Because we were not allowed to deliver intensity higher than a
reported value of 8, the fifth button (9–10) was not given as a possible option (1–2 index
finger, 3–4 middle finger, 5–6 ring finger, 7–8 little finger). The question mark disappeared as
soon as a button was pressed. A variable interval of 8–12 s separated the rating period from
the next stimulation. Electrical stimulations lasted 0.5 s and current intensity was delivered and
chosen for each participant as described in the description of the video recording procedure.
We selected current intensity consistently rated as 2 and 6 prior to scanning, and used
these intensities as low and high stimulation currents during data collection. The mechanical
stimulation was delivered through a rubber band mounted on a plastic tube cut longitudinally:
the participant’s hand was resting inside the tube and the experimenter would snap the
rubber band on the participant’s hand following auditory instructions. Also in this case,
participants underwent a threshold-like procedure similar to that described for the electrical
stimulation.
A Phillips Achieva 3.0 T MRI scanner was used to acquire T2*-weighted echo-planar (32
interleaved 3.5 mm thick axial slices, 0.35 mm gap, TR = 1700 ms, TE = 27.6 ms, flip
angle = 73˚, FOV = 240 mm�240 mm, 80 � 80 matrix of 3.5 mm isotropic voxels), and whole
brain T1-weighted anatomical (1 � 1 � 1 mm) images. Each stimulation block lasted a
minimum of 3.8 min to a maximum of 6.5 min. FMRI data was pre-processed using SPM12
(www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk). All echo planar images (EPIs) were slice-time corrected and realigned to
the participant’s mean EPI. The T1 image was co-registered to the mean
EPI and segmented. The estimated normalization parameters were applied to all EPIs.
Normalized (2 � 2 � 2 mm) EPIs were smoothed with a 6 mm isotropic FWHM Gaussian
kernel. A general linear model (GLM) was applied at the single-subject level. Predictors were
modelled using a standard boxcar function convolved with the hemodynamic response
function (HRF). For each of the eight runs of the pain localizer, we included: a 5 s-length
predictor modelling the instruction screen at the beginning of each run, a 500 ms predictor
aligned to the electrical stimulations, a 200 ms predictor aligned to the mechanical
stimulations, and a predictor aligned to the appearance of the question mark until the
participant’s button response. For both of the predictors aligned to the stimulations,
the participant’s rating was included as a linear parametric modulator. If a participant pressed

 two or more different buttons after the stimulation, it was not possible to assign a subjective
painfulness to the event and so this stimulation was excluded the main
predictor. Such events were included in a separated predictor of no interest, as were button
presses outside the rating period. Six additional regressors of no interest were included to
account for head movements (none of the included participants had frame-wise displacement
along x, y or z exceeding the acquired voxel-size). The modulators of the mechanical and
electrical stimulation were added and this sum was tested against zero at the second level by
means of a t-test. The contrast identified a number of clusters surviving voxelwise FDR at
q < 0.05 (t > 2.23). Because the uncorrected threshold at p<0.001 led to more conservative t
values (t > 3.5), we used this threshold to draw our ROIs. ROIs were defined by calculating
(ImCalc) the voxels common to the cytoarchitectonic maximum probability maps of SI Left (BA
3a, 3b, 1 and 2) from the Anatomy toolbox for SPM (Eickhoff et al., 2005) and
were modulated by perceived pain intensity (t > 3.5). This analysis revealed a dorsal (dSI-L)
and a ventral (vSI-L) cluster. Given the spatial resolution of the forward model used in the EEG
beamforming (1 cm), we rounded the MNI coordinates of the activation peak of each cluster
(dSI-L X,Y,Z = �30,–40, 60 and vSI-L X,Y, Z = �50,–20, 30) to guide the EEG source
reconstruction procedure (Figure 2 main text). Mirror ROIs were created by flipping sign of
the coordinate of the Y axis (dSI-R X,Y,Z = �30, 40, 60 and vSI-R X,Y, Z = �50, 20, 30).
EEG experiment: mirror ROIs results
We replicated the procedure described in the main test to test whether brain activity
originating from the mirror ROIs (dSI-R and vSI-R) also predicts donation. Results show that
activity in dSI-R predicts Z-donation in the Hand condition in the time window between 402
and 484 ms (cluster-statistic = 318.5, p<0.0001) after the belt hits the confederate’s hand and
predicts Z-donation in Face between 522 and 562 ms (cluster-statistic = 161.0, p<0.005). vSI-R
brain activity predicted Z-donation but only in the Face condition in the time window between
444 and 676 ms (cluster-statistic = 804.3, p<0.0001), and between 706 and 738 ms (cluster-
statistic = 804.3, p<0.0063; Figure 3C). Results survive multiple comparisons.
Correlation with self-reported questionnaires
At debriefing, participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire (IRI,
Davis, 1983) and the Money Attitude Scale (MAS, Yamauchi and Templer, 1982) to measure
empathy related traits and attitude towards money, respectively.
To assess whether these personality traits explained the participants’ differences in average
donation we performed, in the costly helping experiment with the highest power (EEG, 28
participants) a multiple regression with the four IRI subscales (Empathic Concern, Perspective
Taking, Fantasy Scale and Personal distress), and the MAS score as predictor of the average
donation. In line with the notion that average donation reflects a trait, individuals that gave
high average donations in the Face condition also gave high average donations in the Hand
condition (r(Hand,Face)=0.85). We therefore used the grand average donation across both
conditions as the dependent measure in the regression. The regression that resulted
was significant (F(5,22)=3.5, p=0.02, r2 = 0.45). In particular, Empathic Concern and the MAS
significantly explained the average donation: the more participants rated themselves as having
high empathic concern towards others and the less they affirmed to value money, the more
they donated during the Costly Helping Paradigm (EC: b = 0.4, p=0.02; MAS: b = �0.5,
p=0.02; all others p>0.4).
Examining individual differences in the slope that links the intensity of pain in the
InputMovie (as judged by an independent sample) with the trial-by-trial donation led to very
different results. First, the slopes in the Face and Hand condition were not strongly correlated
(r(Hand,Face)=0.23), and multiple regressions performed separately for the Face and Hand
slopes revealed that none of the scales significantly explained variance in the slopes (all
p>0.1).

 The results described above are not replicated within the smaller group of participants for
the TMS study (N = 15) and should therefore be considered tentative.

Exploring gender differences
There is some evidence in the literature that shows gender differences in empathic behavior in
a broad range of measures, not only in humans but also in other animals (see Christov-
Moore et al. [2014] for a recent overview). Particularly relevant for the present studies are the
differences regarding face processing. Women are more accurate and/or efficient in
processing facial expressions of emotions in general (Hoffman, 1977; Hall and Matsumoto,
2004; Korb et al., 2015; Proverbio, 2017) and of pain in particular (Keogh, 2014). Women
show more facial mimicry than men (Dimberg and Lundquist, 1990), and are also better than
men at recognizing pain when it is expressed by the body posture (Walsh et al., 2017). In this
section, we therefore explored the effect of gender in our data. Given the low number of
participants of each gender, these analyses should be interpreted in the light of their low
statistical power. Detailed analyses are presented below, but in summary, we found no
significant evidence for gender effects in either our EEG studyor in our neuromodulation
studies.
Experiment 1: EEG study (15 males, 13 females)
Behaviorally, there was no evidence for gender differences in average donation or slopes:
Hand Condition average donation — males mean = 2, SD = 1.2; females mean = 2.3,
SD = 1.2; independent groups t-test t(26)=0.7, p=0.4; Face Condition average donation —
males mean = 2, SD = 1.3, females mean = 2.2, SD = 1.2; independent groups t-test t(26)=0.4,
p=0.7; Hand Condition average slope — males mean = 0.5, SD = 0.1; females mean = 0.4,
SD = 0.2; independent groups t-test t(26)= –1.2, p=0.2; Face Condition average slope —
males mean = 0.5, SD = 0.05; females mean = 0.5, SD = 0.07; independent groups t-test t
(26) = –1.7, p=0.1.
To explore potential gender effects in the relationship between given donation and brain
activity recorded in dSI-L and vSI-L, we first averaged together the slopes belonging to all the
significant time-points in each task. Then using a t-test for independent groups for each
cluster, we compared the average in the genders. Supplementary file 3 summarized the
results. There is no evidence for gender difference in any of the cluster averages.
Supplementary file 3. Mean and standard deviation of the average of all the significant
time-points belonging to a cluster, divided for tasks, ROI and dipole orientation and gender.
t-values and p-values of the t-tests for independent groups (gender) are reported.
Experiment 2: TMS study (nine males, six females)
We performed the same analysis on the slopes described in the main text adding ‘gender’ as
a group factor. This new mixed ANOVA with two repeated factors (Condition and TMS) and
an among participants factor (Gender) did not reveal any gender effect: main effect of Gender
F(1,13)=0.008, p=0.9; Condition X Gender interaction F(1,13)=0.02, p=0.9; TMS X Gender
interaction F(1,13)= 0.9, p=0.3; Condition X TMS X Gender interaction F(1,13)= 0.06, p=0.8.

Neuroscience
 Experiment 3: HD-tDCS study (13 males, 13 females)
As in experiment 2, we repeated the ANOVA described in the main text adding ‘Gender’ as a
group factor. This new mixed ANOVA with two repeated factors (Stimulation and Condition)
and an among participants factor (Gender) showed no significant interaction with between
Gender and Condition or Stimulation factors (Interaction Stimulation X Gender F(1,23)=0.3,
p=0.6; Condition X Gender F(1,23)=1.5, p=0.2; Stimulation X Condition X Gender F(1,23)
=0.03, p=1), suggesting that the effect of our experimental manipulation does not depend on
gender. However, the ANOVA shows a main effect of Gender (F(1,23)=10, p=0.004): females
had on average a steeper slope then males in all the tasks, independently of Condition and
Stimulation. This result does not seem to be related to differences in empathic ability, because
in the control task females also showed a steeper slope. Instead, the result might reflect a
general and unspecific difference in involvement in the task.
Correlation with self-reported questionnaires
Participants from Experiment 1: EEG study completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index
questionnaire (IRI, Davis, 1983) and the Money Attitude Scale (MAS, Yamauchi and Templer,
1982) to measure empathy-related traits and attitude towards money, respectively.
To assess whether these personality traits explained participants’ differences in
performance in the Costly Helping Paradigm, we performed a multiple regression with the
four IRI subscales (Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, Fantasy Scale and Personal distress)
and the MAS score as predictor of the average donation given by the participants on average
to the Face and Hand conditions. For both conditions, the regression was significant (Face: F
(5,22)=3.8, p=0.01, r2 = 0.5; Hand: F(5,22)=2.6, p=0.05, r2 = 0.4). In particular, Empathic
Concern and the MAS were significant predictors of the average donation both in the Face
and the Hand condition: the more participants rated themselves as having high empathic
concern towards othesr and the less they affirmed to value money, the more they donated
during the Costly Helping Paradigm (Face-EC: b = 0.4, p=0.03; Face-MAS: b = �0.5, p=0.02;
Hand-EC: b = 0.4, p=0.3; Hand-MAS: b = �0.4, p=0.03).
