Alzheimer’s disease is a multifactorial dementia disorder characterized by early amyloid-b, tau deposition, glial activation and
neurodegeneration, where the interrelationships between the different pathophysiological events are not yet well characterized. In
this study, longitudinal multitracer positron emission tomography imaging of individuals with autosomal dominant or sporadic
Alzheimer’s disease was used to quantify the changes in regional distribution of brain astrocytosis (tracer 11C-deuterium-L-depre-
nyl), fibrillar amyloid-b plaque deposition (11C-Pittsburgh compound B), and glucose metabolism (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose) from
early presymptomatic stages over an extended period to clinical symptoms. The 52 baseline participants comprised autosomal
dominant Alzheimer’s disease mutation carriers (n = 11; 49.6 � 10.3 years old) and non-carriers (n = 16; 51.1 � 14.2 years old; 10
male), and patients with sporadic mild cognitive impairment (n = 17; 61.9 � 6.4 years old; nine male) and sporadic Alzheimer’s
disease (n = 8; 63.0 � 6.5 years old; five male); for confidentiality reasons, the gender of mutation carriers is not revealed. The
autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease participants belonged to families with known mutations in either presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or
amyloid precursor protein (APPswe or APParc) genes. Sporadic mild cognitive impairment patients were further divided into 11C-
Pittsburgh compound B-positive (n = 13; 62.0 � 6.4; seven male) and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-negative (n = 4; 61.8 � 7.5 years
old; two male) groups using a neocortical standardized uptake value ratio cut-off value of 1.41, which was calculated with respect
to the cerebellar grey matter. All baseline participants underwent multitracer positron emission tomography scans, cerebrospinal
fluid biomarker analysis and neuropsychological assessment. Twenty-six of the participants underwent clinical and imaging follow-
up examinations after 2.8 � 0.6 years. By using linear mixed-effects models, fibrillar amyloid-b plaque deposition was first
observed in the striatum of presymptomatic autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease carriers from 17 years before expected
symptom onset; at about the same time, astrocytosis was significantly elevated and then steadily declined. Diverging from the
astrocytosis pattern, amyloid-b plaque deposition increased with disease progression. Glucose metabolism steadily declined from 10
years after initial amyloid-b plaque deposition. Patients with sporadic mild cognitive impairment who were 11C-Pittsburgh com-
pound B-positive at baseline showed increasing amyloid-b plaque deposition and decreasing glucose metabolism but, in contrast to
autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease carriers, there was no significant longitudinal decline in astrocytosis over time. The
prominent initially high and then declining astrocytosis in autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease carriers, contrasting with
the increasing amyloid-b plaque load during disease progression, suggests astrocyte activation is implicated in the early stages
of Alzheimer’s disease pathology.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is a multifactorial dementia disorder
with a long preclinical phase characterized by a cascade
of pathophysiological events (Braak and Braak, 1991;
Holtzman et al., 2011; Zlokovic, 2011; Heneka et al.,
2015a). The study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (ADAD), caused by mutations in the presenilin 1
(PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor
protein (APP) genes, has allowed the age of symptom
onset for a specific mutation to be predicted and facilitates
investigation of the evolution of pathology in ADAD from
presymptomatic stages. The value of ADAD as a model for
predicting the time course of neuropathological changes in
the much more common and complex sporadic Alzheimer’s
disease forms remains under discussion (Bateman et al.,
2011;
Fleisher,
2014).
A
recent
cross-sectional
study
found similarities in functional connectivity as related
to
cognitive
symptoms
between
ADAD
and
sporadic
Alzheimer’s disease (Thomas et al., 2014); however, to
our knowledge no previous study has yet compared the
longitudinal progression of in vivo biomarkers in ADAD
versus sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. Recent PET imaging
studies of ADAD (Bateman et al., 2012; Fleisher et al.,
2012, 2015; Benzinger et al., 2013; Fleisher et al., 2015)
and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (Villemagne et al., 2013)
have shown that the earliest observed pathological changes
related to amyloid-b plaque deposition can be measured 15
to 20 years before the onset of clinical symptoms, and that
changes in glucose metabolism develop later in the pre-
symptomatic stages (Scho
¨ll et al., 2011a; Benzinger et al.,
2013). The various findings on the evolution of biomarkers
in Alzheimer’s disease have contributed to the establish-
ment of models of the temporal evolution of amyloid-b
and tau deposition, metabolism and atrophy (Jack and
Holtzman, 2013), the increased incorporation of bio-
markers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (Dubois
et al., 2014), and the inclusion of biomarkers as endpoints
in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents.
Nonetheless, there is increasing evidence that pathological
processes independent of amyloid-b plaque deposition may
contribute to the initiation of Alzheimer’s disease (Hyman,
2011; Che
´telat, 2013). Glial activation and neuroinflamma-
tion are increasingly recognized as early events in the dis-
ease, even preceding amyloid-b plaque deposition (Heneka
et al., 2015a, b), potentially making glia a promising thera-
peutic target (Barres, 2008; Fuller et al., 2009; Thal, 2012).
Astrocytes, the most numerous brain cell type, can be clas-
sified into a diversity of subpopulations (Zhang and Barres,
2010; Oberheim et al., 2012). Activated astrocytes, which
have been investigated most often in post-mortem neuro-
pathological studies, have wide phenotypic heterogeneity
(atrophic/hypertrophic)
(Barres,
2008;
Anderson
et
al.,
2014); astrocytic markers, including glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP), glutamine synthetase, vimentin, nestin (mea-
sured by immunohistochemistry), and monoamine oxidase-B
(MAOB) [primarily located in activated astrocytes (Ekblom
et al., 1993; Saura et al., 1994) and measured by 3H-L-
deprenyl autoradiography (Verkhratsky et al., 2015)], dis-
play varying levels of expression.
Post-mortem analyses of astrocytosis in human Alzheimer’s
disease brain tissue have reported conflicting findings. While
GFAP-positive activated astrocytes have been found next to
fibrillar amyloid-b plaques in some studies (Yu et al., 2005;
Gulya
´s et al., 2011), others (Kadir et al., 2011; Marutle
et al., 2013) found no regional correlations between activated
astrocytes as measured by 3H-L-deprenyl (MAOB tracer) and
fibrillar amyloid-b plaques measured by 3H-Pittsburgh com-
pound B. These results suggest that activated astrocytes as-
sessed using GFAP may be different or have a different type

 of activation from those assessed using 3H-L-deprenyl, de-
pending on the stage of disease progression. Astrocyte acti-
vation, including the overexpression of MAOB, is associated
with the release of reactive oxygen species, potentially leading
to excessive oxidative damage, neuroinflammatory changes,
more amyloid-b plaque deposition, and other pathological
changes in Alzheimer’s disease (Miller, 2005). These studies
demonstrate the complexity of the functions of activated
astrocytes; little is known about their in vivo relationships
with other disease biomarkers. While there is an increasing
interest in the in vivo molecular imaging of glial activation
and neuroinflammation, most studies have focused on acti-
vated microglia (Jacobs et al., 2012; Zimmer et al., 2014;
Varley et al., 2015).
The
PET
tracer
11C-deuterium-L-deprenyl
(11C-DED)
binds specifically to MAOB (Fowler et al., 1987, 2005)
and has been applied to investigate astrocytosis in neurode-
generative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (Johansson
et al., 2007; Santillo et al., 2011). Significantly increased
11C-DED
binding
was
found
in
prodromal
stages
of
Alzheimer’s disease in comparison to healthy controls or to
patients with Alzheimer’s disease dementia (Carter et al.,
2012). Additionally, 11C-DED PET binding was negatively
correlated with grey matter density in prodromal Alzheimer’s
disease (Choo et al., 2014). These findings indicate that fur-
ther investigation of the early progressive brain changes in
both the autosomal dominant and sporadic forms of the
disease is warranted. The aim of this multitracer PET
imaging study was to investigate in detail the comparative
regional and temporal patterns of in vivo brain astrocytosis,
fibrillar amyloid-b deposition, and glucose metabolism in
patients with ADAD or sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.
Materials and methods
Study design and participants
Individuals from families with known ADAD mutations were
recruited along with sporadic patients referred for memory
problems
to
the
Department
of
Geriatric
Medicine,
Karolinska
University
Hospital
Huddinge
(Stockholm,
Sweden). A total of 52 participants were included at baseline,
and 26 of these were followed-up 2.8 � 0.6 years after base-
line (Table 1). This study is a continuation of a cross-sectional
multivariate analysis study performed on a subset of partici-
pants at baseline (Scho
¨ll et al., 2015). All participants under-
went a comprehensive clinical and imaging examination at
baseline and follow-up, including medical history, neurological
and psychiatric examination, electroencephalography, MRI,
CSF,
apolipoprotein
E
(APOE)
genotyping
from
blood
sample, and neuropsychological assessment. Details on the
CSF and neuropsychological assessment methods are included
in the Supplementary materials.
The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) followed the
criteria by Petersen (2004), and Alzheimer’s disease dementia was
diagnosed according to the criteria of the National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, and the

(NINCDS-ADRDA) (McKhann et al., 1984). Diagnoses were
made during a consensus meeting where a geriatrician/neurolo-
gist, a neuropsychologist and a nurse discussed the outcome of
the assessment of the patients. All participants provided written
informed consent to participate in the study, which was con-
ducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent
revisions. Ethical approval was obtained from the regional
Human Ethics Committee of Stockholm and the Faculty of
Medicine and Radiation Hazard Ethics Committee of Uppsala
University Hospital, Sweden.
Autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s
disease family members
The ADAD participants in this study are part of an ongoing
research study at Karolinska Institutet involving families car-
rying one of four mutation types, each with a different aver-
age age of onset. For a given participant, the age of symptom
onset is defined as the age at which the first clinically relevant
cognitive symptoms appear, either as experienced by the pa-
tient or by near relatives. The PSEN1 Ile143Thr mutation
(Keller et al., 2010) has the earliest average age of symptom
onset at 36 � 2 years, while the other three mutations have
similar average age of symptom onset: PSEN1 His163Tyr at
52 � 7 years, APPswe KM670/671NL at 54 � 5 years, and
APParc Glu693Gly at 56 � 3 years (Thordardottir et al.,
2014). These values were estimated as averages based on
the medical records of individuals from each of the families
(five, nine, 24 and 12 individuals for the four mutation types,
respectively). This method of estimating average age of symp-
tom onset has been validated by a recent meta-analysis
(Ryman et al., 2014). Participants in our study were non-
carriers, presymptomatic mutation carriers (pMC), or symp-
tomatic mutation carriers (sMC). sMC patients were either
clinically diagnosed as having MCI (Petersen, 2004) or
Alzheimer’s disease dementia (McKhann et al., 1984), and
are receiving medication. Individuals from the pMC group
had no cognitive complaints and did not fulfil the criteria
for MCI or Alzheimer’s disease dementia. To preserve confi-
dentiality, individual mutation statuses are not provided. All
clinicians and researchers in contact with and examining the
ADAD-family members as well as the research subjects were
blind to the mutation status.
Subjects with sporadic Alzheimer’s
disease
Patients in the sporadic group either had MCI (Petersen, 2004)
or probable Alzheimer’s disease dementia (McKhann et al.,
1984). MCI patients were further divided into Pittsburgh com-
pound B (PiB)-positive (PiB+ ) and PiB-negative (PiB�) groups
using a cut-off value of 1.41 neocortical standardized uptake
value ratio (SUVR) with reference to the cerebellar grey matter,
as previously described (Nordberg et al., 2013). The subgroup
of PiB + MCI patients fulfils the current diagnostic criteria for
prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (Dubois et al., 2014).
Healthy control subject recruitment
Two control groups were used in this study. A group of 14
healthy control subjects with a mean age of 64.7 � 3.6 years
and no family history of Alzheimer’s disease underwent MRI
and 11C-DED PET imaging alone. This group was obtained
from a previously published study (Carter et al., 2012), which
provides further information about recruitment details. The
group of 14 healthy subjects was used as control group for
11C-DED binding. A second control group composed of the
ADAD-family non-carrier subjects (n = 16) was used as control
for 11C-PiB retention and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)
uptake. For simplicity, we have referred to both groups as
Control groups throughout this study.
PET and MRI image acquisition and
processing
Participants underwent PET examinations with
11C-DED,
11C-PiB, and 18F-FDG at the Uppsala PET Centre, Uppsala
University (Sweden) on ECAT EXACT HR + (Siemens/CTI)
and GE discovery ST PET/CT scanners. The tracers were pro-
duced and the PET and MRI image acquisition and processing
methods were set as previously described (Carter et al., 2012);
further details are included in the Supplementary material.
Briefly, for each participant, a T1 MRI image was acquired
at baseline and co-registered onto the individual’s 11C-DED
late-sum (10–60 min) image in native 11C-DED space using
SPM8;
11C-PiB and
18F-FDG late-sum images (40–60 and
30–45 min,
respectively)
were
co-registered
onto
the
T1
MRI image (which had been previously co-registered to
native 11C-DED space). This T1 MRI image was segmented
and a binary grey matter mask was created from the resultant
probabilistic grey matter map (threshold = 0.5). Using the in-
verse non-linear transformation from this segmentation, a
simplified probabilistic atlas (Hammers et al., 2003) consisting
of 12 bilateral regions of interest was registered from the
MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space back into the
subject’s native 11C-DED space, and masked using the individ-
ual binary grey matter mask. Registered 18F-FDG and 11C-
PiB PET images for each participant were sampled using the
created individual cortical atlas; the whole pons was used as a
reference as it was found to be preserved from pathology
in both ADAD and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (Minoshima
et al., 1995). For 11C-DED quantification, a modified reference
Patlak model (Johansson et al., 2007) was applied to the 20–
60 min dynamic
11C-DED PET images using the cerebellar
grey matter as the modified reference region (Gulya
´s et al.,
2011) to generate individual 3D parametric Patlak slope
images (units: min�1). The model assumed a cerebellar grey
matter slope value of 0.01 min�1. 11C-DED binding was then
expressed as the ratio of the 11C-DED slope value in the target
region of interest to that in the cerebellar grey matter, as pre-
viously reported (Johansson et al., 2007). This processing was
applied to baseline and follow-up PET images.
Statistical analysis
Group comparisons of all variables were performed using two-
tailed Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by post hoc Mann-
Longitudinal multitracer PET in Alzheimer

 Whitney non-parametric pair-wise comparisons. The Mann-
Whitney effect size was calculated using r = z/(ˇN), where z
is the Mann-Whitney z-score and N the sum of individuals
from the two groups being compared. All group comparisons
were performed, separately for 12 regions of interest, and
across four diagnostic groups: pMC, Control group, PiB +
MCI and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease groups. A multiple com-
parisons procedure controlling for false discovery rate as im-
plemented in the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) using pplot software (Turkheimer et al.,
2001) was applied to correct for multiple regional tests. The
post hoc pair-wise Mann-Whitney comparisons were further
corrected
for
multiple
comparisons
using
the
Dunn-
Bonferroni method (Dunn, 1964). Among the seven pMC sub-
jects, one was an APParc carrier and thus had low 11C-PiB
retention (Scho
¨ll et al., 2012), and was removed from statis-
tical analyses of
11C-PiB PET. Another pMC subject had
passed the age of onset, and showed no penetrance of the
mutation, and hence this subject was removed from all statis-
tical analyses. Pair-wise associations between regional 11C-PiB,
11C-DED and 18F-FDG within diagnostic groups were tested
using Spearman’s correlation (rS). Significance level was set at
P 5 0.05; a multiple comparisons procedure controlling for
false
discovery
rate
as
implemented
in
the
Benjamini-
Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) using
pplot software (Turkheimer et al., 2001) was applied to cor-
rect for multiple regional tests. The above analyses were per-
formed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 22.0), unless
otherwise noted.
Voxel-wise PET group comparisons were performed using
the SPM8 two-sample t-test model. A threshold was set at
P = 0.001 (uncorrected); for this threshold, clusters greater
than 20 voxels were considered significant.
The estimated years to symptom onset was calculated for
both carriers and non-carrier participants
by subtracting
each participant’s age from the average age of symptom
onset for the corresponding mutation type in the respective
family. To assess regional differences in the longitudinal tra-
jectories of PET retention in mutation carriers and non-
carrier subjects, PET tracer retention was modelled separately
for each region of interest using a linear mixed-effects model
(LMM) implemented in the non-linear mixed-effects (NLME)
package in R (version 3.0.1, The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, http://www.r-project.org/). The model incorpo-
rated estimated years to symptom onset as a linear fixed-
effect variable, and a random intercept at the subject level to
account for longitudinal within-individual correlations. The re-
stricted maximum likelihood estimation option was used to
fit all models. The time point at which the longitudinal
trajectories of mutation carriers versus non-carriers started to
diverge was conservatively determined as the estimated years
to symptom onset after which the two 95% confidence bands
no longer overlapped. An LMM (NLME package in R) was
also applied to assess the longitudinal evolution of regional
PET tracer retention in sporadic PiB + MCI patients using a
fixed effect for time (number of years since MCI clinical diag-
nosis) and a random intercept at the subject level. The signifi-
cance level for all model intercept and slope values was set at
P 5 0.05. In addition, a multiple comparisons procedure con-
trolling
for
false
discovery
rate
as
implemented
in
the
Benjamini-Hochberg
method
(Benjamini
and
Hochberg,
1995) using pplot software (Turkheimer et al., 2001) was
applied to correct for multiple regional tests.
Results
Demographic and clinical information on the participants is
provided in Table 1. All groups were matched for age,
except for the pMC group, which was significantly younger
than the sporadic patient groups (P = 0.001 versus PiB +
MCI,
and
P = 0.005
versus
Alzheimer’s
disease).
The
Alzheimer’s disease and sMC groups showed significant
impairment (z 5 �1.645) in both global cognition and epi-
sodic memory. In addition, the PiB + MCI group had poor
episodic memory performance, as measured by a z-score of
�1.36 (SD 0.72), close to the threshold of abnormality.
Neuropsychological profiles at
baseline and follow-up
Global cognition and episodic memory performance re-
mained stable in the pMC, non-carrier, and PiB� MCI
groups from baseline to follow-up examination. The only
sMC subject who was retested at follow-up showed some-
what declining performance in both global cognition (from
z = 0.06 to �0.94) and episodic memory (from z = �1.21 to

MCI group was significantly worse at follow-up than at
baseline, decreasing from z = �1.36 (SD 0.72; n = 13) to

Table 3).
The 11C-PiB retention values differed significantly across the
groups (pMC, PiB+ MCI, Alzheimer’s disease and Control
group) in all regions of interest except in the hippocampus,
and they remained significant after correction for multiple
comparisons (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 2). In post
hoc pair-wise comparisons, 11C-PiB retention was significantly
higher in the pMC group than in the Control group for all
regions of interest except the parahippocampus, with the lar-
gest effect sizes in the frontal (r = 0.67, P = 0.003) and tem-
poral (r = 0.63, P = 0.005) regions. In contrast,
11C-PiB
retention was significantly lower in the pMC group than in
PiB+ MCI patients for all regions of interest except subcor-
tical regions. Both PiB+ MCI and Alzheimer’s disease groups
had significantly higher 11C-PiB retention than the Control
group, with large effects sizes in all regions (r4 0.80).
Figure 1A also shows some degree of variability of 11C-PiB
retention in pMC carriers and, in particular, the typical 11C-
PiB-negative profile of Arctic mutation carriers in all regions.

groups
(pMC,

(P = 0.036)
and
thalamus
(P = 0.017)
(Fig.

and

lobe and the thalamus remained significant after multiple-
comparisons correction. Post hoc pair-wise statistical com-
parisons showed that the pMC group had higher 11C-DED
binding (astrocyte activation) than any other group. The
effect sizes were largest for the comparison between pMC
and Alzheimer’s disease patients, in particular in the anter-
ior cingulate cortex (r = 0.73, P = 0.008) and thalamus
(r = 0.69, P = 0.013). 11C-DED binding was also higher in
the pMC than in the Control group, with large effect sizes

(r = 0.64,

five subjects who were younger than the average age of onset. Two
symptomatic Arctic mutation carriers are represented by separate
symbols (triangles), as subjects with this mutation have very low
11C-PiB retention. Groups represented are pMC (n = 5), sMC
(n = 4), PiB � MCI (n = 4), PiB + MCI (n = 13), sporadic Alzheimer’s
disease (n = 8), and the Control group, composed of non-carrier
members of ADAD families (n = 16) for 11C-PiB and 18F-FDG PET,
and healthy subjects (n = 14) for 11C-DED PET. Horizontal bars

 cingulate cortex (r = 0.51, P = 0.026) regions.
11C-DED
binding was also significantly higher in the pMC group
than in PiB +
MCI patients in the thalamus (r = 0.50,
P = 0.034) and tended to be higher in the anterior cingulate
cortex (r = 0.043, P = 0.068).
In patients with sporadic disease, 11C-DED binding was
significantly higher in the PiB + MCI group than in the
Control group in the parietal region (r = 0.46, P = 0.017)
and tended to be higher in the frontal cortex (r = 0.35,
P = 0.073). There was also a trend for higher 11C-DED
binding in the PiB + MCI group than in the Alzheimer’s
disease group in the thalamus (r = 0.38, P = 0.082). 11C-
DED binding in the Alzheimer’s disease group was not
statistically different from that in the Control group,
except for a trend for higher binding in the frontal region
(r = 0.39, P = 0.065).
For 18F-FDG uptake (Fig. 1C), all regions of interest were
statistically significant at the group level (Supplementary
Table 2); results in all regions of interest except for the
putamen remained significant after multiple-comparisons
correction. The pMC and Control groups had significantly
higher 18F-FDG uptake in most brain regions than seen in
either PiB + MCI or Alzheimer’s disease patients. There
were no significant differences in 18F-FDG uptake between
the pMC and Control group, or between the PiB + MCI
and Alzheimer’s disease patients, in any region of interest.
The correlations between the three tracers were assessed
within each group for the 12 regions of interest. In the
sporadic PiB + MCI group, a significant positive correlation
was found between 11C-PiB retention and 11C-DED bind-
ing values in the frontal lobe (rs = 0.57, P = 0.042), which
did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. No
significant correlations were found between
11C-PiB and
11C-DED in the Alzheimer’s disease, pMC or Control
groups. Nor were significant correlations found between
18F-FDG and 11C-PiB, or 18F-FDG and 11C-DED in the
pMC, PiB + MCI, Alzheimer’s disease or Control groups.
Presymptomatic mutation carrier
PET imaging profiles at baseline and
follow-up using voxel-wise analysis
The individual PET imaging profiles for the three tracers
are shown for the five pMC participants who were younger
than the expected age of onset and for the only followed
sMC patient in Fig. 2A, while whole brain comparisons for
the pMC versus Control groups, and the pMC versus PiB +
MCI groups, are shown in Fig. 2B (statistical results are
shown in Supplementary Table 4). On 11C-PiB PET ima-
ging, retention was significantly higher in the pMC group
than in the Control group at baseline, predominantly in the
frontal lobe and the insula bilaterally, but also in all other
lobes in the right hemisphere and in the right thalamus.
Similar results were observed at follow-up, with greater
extent. Contrariwise, the pMC group had significantly
lower
11C-PiB retention than the PiB +
MCI group at
baseline in the right temporal and bilateral frontal lobes,
as well as in the left anterior cingulate cortex, although the
comparison did not reach significance at the cluster level.
Significantly lower
11C-PiB retention was also found at
follow-up, involving the bilateral frontal, temporal and par-
ietal regions.
The binding of 11C-DED PET was significantly higher at
baseline in the pMC than in the Control group in the par-
ietal regions (inferiolateral region, postcentral gyrus), the
posterior cingulate cortex, the right frontal regions (anter-
ior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus), the left occipital re-
gions, and the bilateral thalamus. At follow-up, binding
remained higher in the pMC group in the fronto-parietal
regions, including additional frontal regions. The pMC sub-
jects also had significantly higher 11C-DED binding at base-
line than the PiB + MCI patients in the anterior cingulate
cortex and the right thalamus, as well as in temporal clus-
ters. Clusters in the temporal lobe also had significantly
higher binding at the peak level. At follow-up, the signifi-
cant regions were distributed across other frontal regions as
well as the left thalamus.

PET
uptake was lower in the left parietal region at baseline in
the pMC group than in the Control group, with signifi-
cance reached at the peak level only (postcentral gyrus,
superior parietal gyrus). This difference spread to the left
posterior cingulate cortex and other parietal regions (re-
mainder of the left inferiolateral region, bilateral superior
parietal gyrus) and to the left middle frontal gyrus and the
bilateral cuneus at follow-up. When compared to sporadic
PiB + MCI patients, the pMC group had higher 18F-FDG
uptake at baseline in the frontal and temporal regions, and
in the right thalamus. Similar results were found at follow-
up.
Of note, none of the opposite contrasts showed signifi-
cant clusters in any of the mentioned comparisons, for any
of the three PET tracers.

A LMM was used to estimate the temporal evolution of
PET tracer retention in the ADAD group (including both
pMC and sMC groups) and the non-carrier group in the
different regions of interest (Figs 3–5) with respect to esti-
mated years to symptom onset, resulting in positive rates of
change in 11C-PiB retention and negative rates of change in
both 11C-DED binding and 18F-FDG uptake in mutation
carriers, which remained significant in the majority of re-
gions of interest after multiple-comparisons correction.
There was no statistically significant change in the non-
carrier group for 11C-PiB retention or 11C-DED binding.

includes all significant regional rates of change in PET
tracer retention in the ADAD carrier and non-carrier
groups.
The longitudinal progression of
11C-PiB retention in
ADAD carriers demonstrated a significant linear increase
in every region of interest except the thalamus, hippocam-
pus and parahippocampus (Table 2 and Fig. 3). The point
of separation between the 95% confidence bands of the
linear fits for carriers versus non-carriers was used as a
conservative estimate of the time point after which the
11C-PiB retention in carriers started to diverge from that
in non-carriers. The earliest occurrence of this was at
estimated years to symptom onset � �17 years in the puta-
men and ��15 years in the caudate nucleus, anterior and
posterior cingulate cortices, closely followed temporally at
an estimated years to symptom onset � �14 years in the
frontal cortex and subsequently other cortical regions. The
regional rates of increase in 11C-PiB retention ranged from
0.021 [standard error (SE) 0.006] to 0.036 (SE 0.006)
SUVR per year, with the steepest increases observed in
the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices, and the puta-
men. Some individuals in the sMC group showed markedly
higher
11C-PiB
retention
than
those
in
the
sporadic
Alzheimer’s disease group, especially in regions such as
the striatum (Fig. 3).

 The longitudinal change in 11C-DED binding in muta-
tion carrier and non-carrier groups showed more inter-
subject variability than seen with 11C-PiB (Fig. 4). The
LMMs showed that 11C-DED binding in ADAD carriers
steadily declined with disease progression (estimated
years to symptom onset), displaying the highest values
in the pMC group from the earliest time before symptom
onset. The 11C-DED decline rates in ADAD carriers were
significant in every region of interest except the frontal,
occipital and the hippocampus regions, with the steepest
decline rates reaching �0.030 (SE 0.005) per year in the
caudate nucleus and �0.022 (SE 0.007) per year in the
thalamus. Most of the individuals in the sMC group
showed lower
11C-DED binding than in the sporadic
Alzheimer’s disease group at baseline (Fig. 4).
The longitudinal
18F-FDG uptake showed significant
linear decreases with estimated years to symptom onset
in ADAD carriers in all regions of interest except in the
parahippocampus (Table 2 and Fig. 5), and significant
linear decreases in the non-carrier group in the frontal
cortex and caudate nucleus. 18F-FDG uptake in carriers
started to diverge from that in the non-carrier group at
estimated years to symptom onset � �7 years in the par-
ietal and temporal regions. The respective separation
point in subcortical regions including the caudate nu-
cleus, thalamus and hippocampus was at an estimated
years to symptom onset � �2 years. The rates of 18F-
FDG decrease in ADAD carriers were most pronounced
in the caudate nucleus [–0.022 (SE 0.003) SUVR per
year], the posterior cingulate cortex [–0.017 (SE 0.005)
SUVR per year] and the parietal cortex [–0.016 (SE
0.003) SUVR per year]. Some of the sMC participants

Discussion
In this study, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, over a
mean period of 2.8 � 0.6 years, of the regional distribution
of brain astrocytosis, amyloid-b plaque deposition and glu-
cose metabolism in patients with ADAD compared to those
with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. Previous longitudinal PET
imaging studies in ADAD (Benzinger et al., 2013; Yau et al.,
2015) reported amyloid-b plaque deposition as the earliest
neuropathological change observed in vivo, thus supporting
the amyloid cascade hypothesis (Hardy and Higgins, 1992).
In this study, we showed evidence of very early astrocyte
activation in presymptomatic stages of ADAD, observed at
least as early as amyloid-b plaques started to accumulate.
The presymptomatic group demonstrated high levels of
astrocytosis in comparison with both the Control group
and the sporadic symptomatic groups. Overall, initially ele-
vated
then
declining
astrocytosis,
increasing
amyloid-b
plaque
deposition,
and
decreasing
glucose
metabolism
characterized the disease evolution as modelled by ADAD.
The time courses of amyloid-b plaque deposition and glu-
cose metabolism in sporadic patients were overall compar-
able to those in ADAD participants. While astrocytosis was
elevated in sporadic PiB + MCI patients compared to the
Control group and the Alzheimer’s disease group, confirm-
ing previously reported results (Carter et al., 2012), the lon-
gitudinal evolution in this group did not show a significant
rate of change.
We observed high fibrillar amyloid-b plaque deposition
in the putamen of ADAD carriers as early as 17 years
before expected symptom onset, closely followed by the
caudate nucleus and other cortical regions. The observed
early striatal
11C-PiB retention in the pMC group con-
firmed our cross-sectional findings comparing pMC with
the Control group, and is consistent with previous reports
(Klunk et al., 2007; Koivunen et al., 2008; Villemagne
et al., 2009; Benzinger et al., 2013). This early striatal
amyloid-b plaque deposition in ADAD is also consistent
with the observed higher binding of amyloid-b plaque tra-
cers
3H-PiB and
3H-AZD2184 in post-mortem striatal
ADAD compared to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease brain
tissue (Ni, 2015) and provides evidence of pathological

ease (Shinohara et al., 2014), possibly related to aberrant
APP processing caused by the mutation (Potter et al., 2013;
Ringman et al., 2014).
Our longitudinal 11C-PiB retention results are also con-
sistent with longitudinal PET imaging in an ADAD cohort
(Benzinger
et
al.,
2013)
and
sporadic
populations
(Villemagne et al., 2013), both studies showing fibrillar
amyloid-b plaque deposition starting from around 15 to
20 years before symptom onset. The results are in contrast
with a recent longitudinal PET imaging study in an ADAD
cohort, which showed 11C-PiB retention starting 7.5 years
before expected symptom onset (Yau et al., 2015); the dif-
ferent timing of initial amyloid-b plaque deposition among
studies could be due to differences in mutation types, or to
methodological discrepancies regarding definition of symp-
toms or of age at symptom onset.
Our study allowed obtaining regional rates of change of
PET tracer retention. The regions of early 11C-PiB retention
in ADAD carriers (including the putamen and the anterior/
posterior cingulate cortices) were also those showing the
maximum rates of 11C-PiB increase. Consistent with the
observed rates of increased 11C-PiB retention in ADAD,
the sporadic PiB + MCI group showed similar rates in the
putamen and insula. No significant rates of
11C-PiB in-
crease were measured in cortical regions in the sporadic
PiB + MCI group, probably because of the limited time
span investigated, which was restricted to symptomatic
stages, as well as a possible plateau effect on the amyl-
oid-b plaque load, as has been reported in late stages of
Alzheimer’s disease (Jack and Holtzman, 2013).
The cross-sectional and longitudinal results on 11C-DED
binding in ADAD participants in our study have revealed
two main findings: an elevated 11C-DED binding in pMC,
and diverging temporal patterns of steady 11C-DED decline
concomitant with increasing 11C-PiB retention. It is plaus-
ible that the initial high 11C-DED binding reflects MAOB
elevation in the presence of soluble amyloid-b forms.
Several studies have shown that the presence of amyloid-
b peptides results in upregulation of gene and protein ex-
pression in astrocytes (Mulder et al., 2012; Thal, 2012),
including elevated MAOB expression in cultured rat astro-
cytes (Song et al., 2000). Recent studies have supported the
hypothesis that astrocytes have a beneficial role contribut-
ing to amyloid-b clearance (Furman et al., 2012), but also
that excess amyloid-b can lead to oxidative stress and dam-
age, and as a consequence to reduced astrocyte functional-
ity, leading to reactive changes and decreased neuronal
support, and thereby contributing to neurodegeneration
(Allaman et al., 2010; Mulder et al., 2012; Thal, 2012).
Decreasing MAOB expression in astrocytes with the pro-
gression of the disease may be an indication of a reduction
in a certain type of astrocyte activation or functionality, a
change of astrocyte activation phenotype, or possibly
‘astrodegeneration’ and astrocyte cell loss itself, as has
been reported towards the late stages of Alzheimer’s disease
(Smale et al., 1995; Gulya
´s et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Arellano
et al., 2015).
Interestingly, MRI studies in presymptomatic ADAD car-
riers have shown unexpected early grey matter changes
(Fortea et al., 2010; Ryan and Fox, 2013; Ryan et al.,
2013; Quiroz et al., 2015; Sala-Llonch et al., 2015), and
hypermetabolism
preceding
hypometabolism
(Benzinger
et al., 2013), which were interpreted as possibly reflecting
glial and neuroinflammatory processes. In our study, al-
though with statistical power limitations, the voxel-wise ana-
lyses of pMC data suggested that local astrocytosis could
already be high very early, in the presymptomatic stages,
when local fibrillar amyloid-b plaque deposition increases.
Our
longitudinal investigation
supports
previous
cross-
sectional findings of presymptomatic astrocytosis from multi-
variate analysis performed in a subset of participants (Scho
¨ll
et al., 2015). Similar time courses of astrocytosis and amyl-
oid-b plaque deposition have been observed by in vivo PET
imaging in an APPswe mouse model (Rodriguez-Vieitez
et al., 2015).
The pMC group had greater 11C-DED binding in the an-
terior cingulate cortex and thalamus than sporadic PiB +
MCI patients. These two regions might represent the sites
of earliest astrocyte activation in the course of ADAD.
Future research on earlier stages in at-risk sporadic cohorts
would help elucidate whether sporadic Alzheimer’s disease
has a similar regional pattern of early brain astrocytosis to
that observed in ADAD. The longitudinal investigation of
11C-DED binding in PiB + MCI patients did not reveal a
significant rate of change with time. Possible explanations
for this finding include the heterogeneity of disease stage
in MCI patients, the shorter time span investigated in the
sporadic patients compared to the ADAD participants, or a
possibly different progression of astrocyte activation in the
sporadic compared to the autosomal dominant forms.
Glucose metabolism declined significantly in both carriers
and non-carriers. The observed metabolic decline in the
frontal cortex and caudate nucleus in non-carriers is in
agreement
with
findings
in
healthy
ageing
adults
(Yoshizawa et al., 2014). The decline in glucose metabol-
ism in ADAD carriers started to deviate significantly from
that in non-carriers at estimated years to symptom onset �
�7 years in the parieto-temporal cortex, which is typically
hypometabolic in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (La Joie
et al., 2012), about a decade after the start of amyloid-b
plaque deposition. The pMC group showed preserved me-
tabolism in most subcortical regions including the putamen,
which, however, showed amyloid-b plaque deposition. Our
results are largely consistent with previous studies where
hypometabolism in ADAD carriers was first observed
from ��10 to �5 estimated years to symptom onset in
cortical regions, while subcortical metabolism was pre-
served in the presymptomatic stages except in the hippo-
campus (Benzinger et al., 2013). In contrast, a recent
longitudinal study in ADAD reported that the earliest
hypometabolism was observed only in temporal coinci-
dence with the onset of symptoms (Yau et al., 2015),

 which could be partly due to methodological differences.
Some of the sMC patients in our study showed more pro-
nounced hypometabolism than seen in sporadic Alzheimer’s
disease (Fig. 5), confirming previous findings (Scho
¨ll et al.,
2011b). In our sporadic PiB + MCI patients, we observed
longitudinal decline rates similar to those in ADAD car-
riers, although in fewer brain regions, probably because
of the relatively shorter time span investigated.
Different mutations result in variations in pathology and
disease progression (Shinohara et al., 2014). One limitation
of our study was that all the mutation types were com-
bined, except for the Arctic carriers, who were excluded
from the 11C-PiB PET group analyses. In addition, while
the progression of PET tracer retention in pMC partici-
pants is probably different from that in sMC patients, the
limited number of sMC patients did not allow for statistical
comparisons, and LMMs were applied to the combination
of pMC and sMC data. Therefore, the predictions of the
LMMs should be interpreted with some caution. However,
the observed low values of 18F-FDG uptake and 11C-DED
binding in individual sMC patients suggests a somewhat
more aggressive neurodegeneration pattern in ADAD than
in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. For future research, add-
itional follow-up examinations per patient will allow more
suitable non-linear modelling of the neuropathological time
courses with disease progression.
In conclusion, the longitudinal examination of ADAD
and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease participants with an aver-
age follow-up time of 2.8 � 0.6 years showed the diverging
regional and time courses of Alzheimer’s disease-related
biomarkers as measured by PET imaging. Prominent initial
and then declining astrocytosis, increasing fibrillar amyloid-
b plaque pathology and decreasing glucose metabolism
characterized ADAD evolution. Similar time courses of
amyloid-b plaque deposition and glucose metabolism were
observed in patients with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease and
ADAD.
Although
higher
levels
of
astrocytosis
were
observed in the presymptomatic ADAD group than in the
sporadic PiB + MCI and Alzheimer’s disease groups, astro-
cytosis was still observable early on in the sporadic forms
of the disease. Studies of larger cohorts would be useful for
further investigating the earlier stages to elucidate whether
the presymptomatic astrocytosis observed in ADAD is also
found in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. Future longitudinal
in vivo studies including, in addition to astrocytosis, also
imaging of other neuroinflammatory components and tau
deposition in brain would be useful for further advance-
ment of imaging biomarkers and contribute to development
of disease-modifying therapies.
