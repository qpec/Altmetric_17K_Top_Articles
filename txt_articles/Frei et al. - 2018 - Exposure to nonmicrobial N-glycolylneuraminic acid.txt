 Background: Childhood exposure to a farm environment has
been shown to protect against the development of inflammatory
diseases, such as allergy, asthma, and inflammatory bowel
disease.
Objective: We sought to investigate whether both exposure to
microbes and exposure to structures of nonmicrobial origin,
such as the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc),
might play a significant role.
Methods: Exposure to Neu5Gc was evaluated by quantifying
anti-Neu5Gc antibody levels in sera of children enrolled in 2
farm studies: the Prevention of Allergy Risk factors for
Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and
Anthroposophic Lifestyle (PARSIFAL) study (n 5 299) and the
Protection Against Allergy Study in Rural Environments
(PASTURE) birth cohort (cord blood [n 5 836], 1 year
[n 5 734], 4.5 years [n 5 700], and 6 years [n 5 728]), and we
associated them with asthma and wheeze. The effect of Neu5Gc
was examined in murine airway inflammation and colitis
models, and the role of Neu5Gc in regulating immune activation
was assessed based on helper T-cell and regulatory T-cell
activation in mice.
Results: In children anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels correlated
positively with living on a farm and increased peripheral blood
forkhead box protein 3 expression and correlated inversely with
wheezing and asthma in nonatopic subjects. Exposure to
Neu5Gc in mice resulted in reduced airway hyperresponsiveness
and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung. Furthermore,
Neu5Gc administration to mice reduced the severity of a colitis
model. Mechanistically, we found that Neu5Gc exposure
reduced IL-171 T-cell numbers and supported differentiation of
regulatory T cells.
Conclusions: In addition to microbial exposure, increased
exposure to non–microbial-derived Neu5Gc might contribute to
the protective effects associated with the farm environment. (J
Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;141:382-90.)
Key words: Farmers’ children, nonmicrobial, N-glycolylneuraminic
acid, airway inflammation, colitis, anti-inflammatory
The hygiene hypothesis suggests that children growing up in an
environment rich in microbes or microbial components have less
allergy, autoimmune disease, and colitis.1-4 Asthma, hay fever,
and colitis are less prevalent in farmers’ children.5-7 The microbi-
al load in the child’s environment has been proposed to be the crit-
ical factor influencing the child’s developing immune system and
to confer protection against atopic diseases.8-11 However, a
farming lifestyle not only implicates increased exposure to mi-
crobes but also to nonmicrobial molecules potentially influencing
the developing immune system.12,13
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is a sialic acid specif-
ically expressed on nonhuman mammalian cells and glycopro-
teins and not present in bacteria.14 In contrast to many other
mammals, including primates, human subjects lack the enzyme
CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) because of a genetic muta-
tion and are therefore not able to synthesize Neu5Gc from the
precursor N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac).15,16 As a conse-
quence, human subjects mount a humoral immune response by
producing anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, which can be used as a surro-
gate marker for exposure to Neu5Gc.14,17,18
In the present study we investigated the role of exposure to
Neu5Gc in the development of airway inflammation and colitis.
We determined the levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in children’s
serum samples and correlated them with farm exposure. More-
over, we associated anti-Neu5Gc levels with the incidence of
asthma and wheezing. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of
Neu5Gc on the development of airway inflammation in a CMAH
(Neu5Gc)–deficient murine model mimicking the human situa-
tion and examined the immune mechanisms in primary dendritic
cells and T helper cells.
METHODS
Study design and population
The European cross-sectional Prevention of Allergy Risk factors for
Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle
(PARSIFAL) study aimed to study the determinants of childhood asthma and
allergies in farming and anthroposophic populations in 5 European countries, as
described previously.19 Parents of participating children were invited to fill out a
questionnaire about farming lifestyle, farm exposures, child’s diet, and allergic
diseases.20-22 Written informed consent was obtained from the children’s par-
ents for questionnaires, blood sampling, and environmental exposure assess-
ment, and the research ethics committee of canton Basel approved the study.
In the present study data of a sample of Swiss children (5-14 years old) with
available blood samples were used (n 5 299). Questions on health outcomes
and farm exposure were derived from the internationally validated International
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood II23 questionnaire and the Allergy
and Endotoxin Study (ALEX).7 Children with reported doctor-diagnosed
asthma once or obstructive bronchitis more than once in their lifetime were re-
garded as having asthma. Obstructive bronchitis is commonly used to define the
first occurrence of asthmatic symptoms. Reported wheezing during the past
12 months was considered wheeze. A child who lived on a farm and whose fam-
ily ran the farm was coded as being a farmer’s child.24
The Protection Against Allergy Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE)
birth cohort is a prospective birth cohort involving children from rural areas in
5 European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland)
designed to evaluate risk factors and preventive factors for asthma and atopic
diseases.25 Pregnant women were recruited during the third trimester of preg-
nancy between August 2002 and March 2005 and divided into 2 groups.
Women who lived on family-run farms where any kind of livestock was
kept were assigned to the farm group. Women from the same rural areas but
not living on a farm were in the reference group. In total, 1133 children
were included in this birth cohort. All available serum samples of cord blood
(n 5 836) and samples at 1 year (n 5 734), 4.5 years (n 5 700), and 6 years
(n 5 728) were included in the study.
The research ethics committee of canton St Gallen approved the study, and
written informed consent was obtained from all parents. Questionnaires were
administered in interviews or self-administered to the mothers within the third
trimester of pregnancy and when the children were 2, 12, 18, and 24 months of
age and then yearly up to age 6 years. Information on parental atopic status,
sex, and the duration of breast-feeding was recorded in questionnaires during

 pregnancy, 2 months after birth, and at 1 year of age. Positive parental history
of allergies was defined as ever having asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic
dermatitis by one of the parents. Children were defined as having asthma when
the parents reported in the 6-year questionnaire that the child had either a
doctor-diagnosed asthma or at least 2 doctor-diagnosed episodes of obstruc-
tive bronchitis. In this birth cohort 5 phenotypes of wheeze could have been
determined by using latent class analysis, similar to previous epidemiologic
studies.26 We used the phenotypes ‘‘intermediate,’’ ‘‘late-onset,’’ or ‘‘persis-
tent’’ to define wheeze, and the phenotypes ‘‘no/infrequent’’ or ‘‘transient’’
wheeze were used as the reference group. Gene expression of forkhead box
protein 3 (Foxp3) and IL10 were measured with quantitative PCR in peripheral
blood leukocytes.
Anti-Neu5Gc antibody quantification
Serum levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies were determined by means of
ELISA, as previously described.27 Five hundred nanograms per well of
Neu5Ac-polyacrylamide or Neu5Gc-polyacrylamide (GlycoTech, Gaithers-
burg, Md) were coated on a 96-well microtiter plate. After washing and block-
ing of the plate, 100 mL of a 1:10 dilution of sera was incubated in duplicateson
the plate. Bound antibodies were detected by using a horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland).
Measured values were normalized to a standard curve of normal human serum
(Sigma-Aldrich) measured on the same plate. For background correction of
anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels, anti-Neu5Ac IgG levels were subtracted.27
Animals
CMAH knockout mice28 were a kind gift from Ajit Varki (University of
California, San Diego, Calif) and were bred at AO Research Institute in Davos,
Switzerland. Female C57BL/6 mice, C.B17 severe combined immunodefi-
ciency (SCID) mice, and BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were obtained
from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) and housed at the AO Research Insti-
tute Davos. Mice were housed at 4 to 6 animals per cage in individually venti-
lated cages in a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle, with vegetarian food and
water available ad libitum. Mice of different genotypes were cohoused for
at least 2 weeks before the start of the experiments. All experimental proced-
ures were carried out in accordance with Swiss law and approved by the ani-
mal experiment commission of the canton Grisons, Switzerland.
Allergic airway inflammation mouse model
Ovalbumin model. Mice were sensitized by means of intraperitoneal
injection of 20 mg of grade VI ovalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich) emulsified in 500 mg
ofAlum(Pierce,Rockford,Ill)in200mLofsterile0.9%isotonicsodiumchloride
(NaCl) on days 0, 7, and 21, followed by 20 minutes of 1% grade Vovalbumin
(Sigma-Aldrich) aerosol treatments on days 26, 27, and 28. In addition, mice
received 50 mg/kg/d LPS-free Neu5Gc (Inalco Pharmaceuticals, San Luis
Obispo, Calif) by means of gavage starting 5 days before the first ovalbumin
injection. Analysis of mice occurred 24 hours after the last aerosol challenge.
House dust mite model. Micewere treated at day 0 with 1 mg and
on days 7 to 11 with 10 mg of house dust mite extract (GREER Laboratories,
Lenoir, NC) administered intranasally. Mice were analyzed on day 12. The
mice received 50 mg/kg/d Neu5Gc by means of gavage starting 3 or 14 days
before the first house dust mite application. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
was performed with 1 mL of PBS containing 13 protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The total number of leukocytes was counted
with a Neubauer counting chamber. For differential cell counts, cytospin
preparations were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Merz & Dade AG,
Dudingen, Switzerland). Macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neu-
trophils were identified by using standard morphologic criteria, and 100 to
200 cells were counted per cytospin preparation.
SCID colitis
More information on SCID colitis can be found in Kjellev et al.29 To induce
colitis, CD41CD252CD45RB1 cells were applied to SCID mice. These cells
were isolated from total spleen cells of BALB/c mice by using 2 rounds of Au-
toMACS separation with reagents from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). Three hundred eighty thousand cells were injected intraperitone-
ally into C.B17 SCID mice. Control animals were injected with sodium chlo-
ride. The severity of the disease was assessed by loss of body weight and a
symptom score comprising the injection site, breathing, activity, fur condition,
movement, body weight, and condition of the feces.
Lung tissue and lymph node cell isolation and flow
cytometric analysis
Dissociation kits for mice and gentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) were used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol to prepare single-cell suspensions
from lung tissue or lymph nodes. All flow cytometric analyses were performed
on the Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif). Anti-CD3
(145-2C11), anti-Helios (22F6), anti–IL-5 (TRFK5), and anti-CD4 (RM4-5)
antibodies were obtained from BioLegend (San Diego, Calif). Anti-CD25
(PC61.5), anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16s), anti–IL-10 (JES5-16E3), anti–IL-17A
(eBio17B7), anti–IFN-g (XMG1.2), anti–IL-13 (eBio13A), anti-CD127
(A7R34), and anti–IL-4 (11B11) antibodies were obtained from eBioscience
(Vienna, Austria). Cells were stained with the fixable viability dye eFlour780
(eBioscience). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated with
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (50 and 500 ng/mL) for 4 hours at
378C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in the presence of Brefeldin solution (eBio-
science) to inhibit cytokine secretion. Cells were permeabilized with reagents
from eBioscience.
Immunoglobulins
Total IgE levels were assessed with a Milliplex kit (Merck Millipore,
Billerica, Mass). Ovalbumin/house dust mite–specific IgE/IgG1 levels in sera
were measured by means of ELISA coated with ovalbumin/house dust mite
and detected with anti-IgE/IgG1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Lung function measurements
Mice were intubated after achievement of anesthesia, and airway resistance
was assessed with the flexiVent system (SCIREQ, Montreal, Quebec,
Canada). Airway resistance was measured in response to increasing concen-
trations of methacholine (Sigma-Aldrich).
Primary cell isolation
CD141 monocytes were isolated from healthy human PBMCs by using
AutoMACS and reagents from Miltenyi Biotec. CD141 monocytes were
differentiated into monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro with IL-4 and
GM-CSF for 5 days. Cells were stimulated with 3 mmol/L Neu5Gc (Inalco
Pharmaceuticals). Murine dendritic cells and T helper cells were isolated
from spleens of nontreated mice by using AutoMACS and reagents from
Miltenyi Biotec. Cells were cocultured for 5 days in a 1:30 ratio. For
intracellular
cytokine
staining,
cells
were
stimulated
with
phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (50 and 500 ng/mL) for 24 hours at
378C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in the presence of Brefeldin solution
(eBioscience). T helper cell differentiation was assessed by means of flow
cytometry.
Statistical analysis
Anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels showed a skewed distribution and were therefore
log-transformed, resulting in an approximately normal distribution. The
proportions of nondetectable values in the PARSIFAL study were 14.7%
less than the lower detection limit and 7.5% greater than the upper detection
limit. In the PASTURE birth cohort sera were frequently less than the lower
detection limit (cord blood, 45.5%; 1 year, 63.8%; 4.5 years, 45.4%; and
6 years, 42.0%; corresponding to the lowest tertile in the analyses) and less
frequent above the upper detection limit (cord blood, 1.4%; 1 year, 0.8%;
4.5 years, 2.1%; and 6 years, 2.8%). To take these relevant proportions of
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL

 nondetectable values into account, Tobit regression was used with anti-
Neu5Gc IgG levels as the dependent variable.30 Geometric mean ratios along
with 95% CIs were computed to describe the association between anti-
Neu5Gc IgG levels and exposures. Logistic regression was used to explore
the association between binomial health outcomes and anti-Neu5Gc IgG
levels, and effects were expressed as odds ratios along with 95% CIs. In these
models anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels were introduced as a categorical variable (ter-
tiles) to avoid data loss because of nondetection.
To assess potential confounding for the association between anti-Neu5Gc
IgG levels and asthma predefined variables (being a farm child, sex, age, body
mass index, number of older siblings, parental history of allergies, parental
education, and maternal smoking during pregnancy) were introduced into the
regression models one by one. Variables that changed the odds ratios for anti-
Neu5Gc IgG levels on asthma by more than 10% were used in the final models.
Two-sided P values of less than .05 were considered significant. In the
PASTURE birth cohort all analyses were adjusted for farming status and cen-
ter. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata/SE 10.1 software (StataCorp,
College Station, Tex) and SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Mouse and in vitro experiments were graphed and analyzed statistically
with Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif). Data were ex-
pressed as means 6 SEMs and analyzed for significance by using the Mann-
Whitney test. Samples or animals were only excluded because of technical
problems.
RESULTS
Anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels are increased in farmers’
children and inversely associated with nonatopic
wheeze and asthma
To assess whether farmers’ children are exposed to Neu5Gc,
we measured anti-Neu5Gc antibody levels in the context of the
PARSIFAL study and the PASTURE birth cohort (see Table E1 in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). At all
time points, farmers’ children had higher levels of anti-Neu5Gc
IgG compared with nonfarmers’ children (Table I). To assess
whether exposure to Neu5Gc might affect the children’s
development
of
asthma
and
wheezing,
we
associated
anti-Neu5Gc antibody levels with asthma and wheeze. Higher
anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels were inversely associated with asthma
and wheezing in a dose-dependent manner in the PARSIFAL
study population (Fig 1, A).
In the longitudinal PASTURE birth cohort the sample size
allowed us to divide the children into those with and without atopy
(defined as allergic sensitization to any allergens at 6 years of
age). We found a significant inverse association between anti-
Neu5Gc IgG levels and wheezing among nonatopic children and a
trend for an inverse association between anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels
and asthma (Fig 1, B).
Next, we investigated potential associations between anti-
Neu5Gc IgG levels and gene expression of regulatory T (Treg)
cell marker in children’s peripheral blood leukocytes. Increasing
anti-Neu5Gc IgG levels were associated with increased gene
expression of Foxp3, and a positive nonstatistically significant
trend was shown with IL10 gene expression in 6-year-old children
of the longitudinal study (Table II). No other significant associa-
tions were found between anti-Neu5Gc IgG and gene expression
of immunologic markers (see Table E2 in this article’s Online Re-
pository at www.jacionline.org).
In summary, farmers’ children had increased anti-Neu5Gc
IgG levels, which correlated with less wheezing and asthma
in nonatopic children and increased expression of Treg cell
markers.
Airway inflammation severity in CMAH-deficient
and wild-type mice is reduced by oral
administration of Neu5Gc
To further investigate the functional role of Neu5Gc in the
development of inflammatory airway diseases, we used a murine
model with Neu5Gc deficiency.28 CMAH-deficient mice lack
Neu5Gc because of a mutation in the synthesis pathway resem-
bling the human situation. Because murine inflammatory airway
disease models do not cover all immunologic aspects compared
with human disease, we applied 2 different models with
CMAH-deficient mice, one with ovalbumin as the allergen and
aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant and one with house dust
mite extract as the allergen. We assessed whether the severity
of airway inflammation in CMAH-deficient mice could be
reduced by long-term exposure (beginning 14 days before sensi-
tization) to a dose of Neu5Gc that was comparable with the calcu-
lated exposure of a child living on a farm.31 We found that airway
resistance in response to methacholine and total cell, eosinophil,
and neutrophil numbers in BAL fluid were reduced by Neu5Gc
administration in both models (Fig 2, A and B). Furthermore, in-
flammatory cell infiltration and mucus production in tissue sec-
tions from the lungs of mice administered Neu5Gc were
reduced (Fig 2, C and D). Shorter-term exposure (beginning
3 days before sensitization) to Neu5Gc did not significantly
reduce total cell, eosinophil, and neutrophil numbers in BAL
fluid, suggesting that a longer exposure time is required to
achieve protection (see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org).
To investigate further the underpinning mechanisms induced
by Neu5Gc administration, we analyzed levels of cytokine
production by lung T helper and lung Treg cells and immuno-
globulin levels in sera. Flow cytometric analyses of lung
CD31CD41 cells revealed that Neu5Gc application reduced the
percentage of IL-17–producing T helper cells in both murine
models (Fig 2, E). The percentage of IL-4–, IFN-g–, IL-10–,
IL-13–, and IL-5–producing T helper cells was not altered (see
Figs E2, A, and E3, A, in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org). Although the percentage of CD251Foxp31
Treg cells was not significantly increased in lung tissues through

more IL-10 (Fig 2, F). In the house dust mite model we observed
more CD251Foxp31 and CD251Foxp31CD1272 Treg cells af-
ter Neu5Gc application (Fig 2, F, and see Fig E3, B). Neu5Gc
administration did not have an effect on immunoglobulin levels
in sera (see Figs E2, B, and E3, C).

 To investigate whether exogenously added Neu5Gc had an
effect only in the absence of endogenously produced Neu5Gc, we
applied Neu5Gc to wild-type mice and investigated whether it
was able to reduce the severity of house dust mite extract–induced
airway inflammation. Similar to the findings of CMAH-deficient
mice, we found in wild-type mice reduced airway resistance in
response to methacholine; reduced total cell, eosinophil, and
neutrophil numbers in BAL fluid; less IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13
production by lung T helper cells; and more lung CD251Foxp31
Treg cells producing IL-10 (see Fig E4 in this article’s Online Re-
pository at www.jacionline.org).
In summary, administration of Neu5Gc to both CMAH-
deficient or wild-type mice ameliorated the symptoms of airway
inflammation, enhanced Treg cells, and reduced IL-17 production
by T helper cells in lungs.
Colitis severity is reduced by oral administration of
Neu5Gc
Next, we assessed whether the severity of another inflamma-
tory disease was ameliorated by exposure to Neu5Gc. Therefore
we applied daily Neu5Gc orally to SCID mice that received
CD41CD252CD45RB1 cells to induce colitis and assessed the
severity of the disease by scoring symptoms, assessing body
weight, and measuring the ratio between weight and length of
the colon. We found that an increase in symptom score and
body weight loss was prevented by Neu5Gc administration
compared with that seen in nontreated mice (Fig 3, A and B).
Furthermore,
the
weight/length
ratio
of
the
colon
was
significantly improved (Fig 3, C). Additionally, we found that
mesenteric lymph node T helper cells produced less IL-17 and
that the percentage of CD251Foxp31 Treg cells was enhanced
in response to Neu5Gc administration (Fig 3, D and E).
However, the percentage of IL-4–, IFN-g–, IL-10–, IL-13–, and
IL-5–producing T helper cells was not influenced by Neu5Gc
administration, whereas assessment of total inflammatory cell
infiltration in the gut by means of hematoxylin and eosin staining
was also not significantly changed by Neu5Gc (see Fig E5 in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).
In summary, administration of Neu5Gc during induction of
colitis in mice ameliorated symptoms, enhanced Treg cells, and
reduced IL-17 production by T helper cells in mesenteric lymph
nodes.
Neu5Gc induces a regulatory phenotype in
dendritic cells, and coculture of Neu5Gc-expressing
T helper cells with dendritic cells leads to less IL-17–
producing T helper cells and induction of Treg cells
Because the murine studies suggested a direct effect of Neu5Gc
on immune cells, leading to less IL-17 production of T helper
cells and enhanced Treg cells, we examined the effects of Neu5Gc
on primary human and murine immune cells. We measured
expression of regulatory molecules in human monocyte-derived
dendritic cells that were stimulated with Neu5Gc. Indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase and retinaldehyde
dehydrogenase 2 gene
expression, as well as IL-10 secretion, were increased. All of
these molecules are known to be involved in Treg cell differen-
tiation (Fig 4, A).32
Next, murine dendritic cells and naive T helper cells were
isolated from either wild-type or CMAH-deficient spleens and
cocultured. Cocultures of wild-type cells led to lower levels of IL-
17–producing T helper cells and higher levels of CD251Foxp31
Treg cells compared with cultures of cells isolated from
CMAH-deficient mice (Fig 4, B and C). Cocultures of
wild-type T helper cells or dendritic cells with CMAH-deficient
dendritic cells or T helper cells showed intermediate IL-17 pro-
duction by T helper cells and medium-level CD251Foxp31
Treg cell polarization (Fig 4, B and C).
DISCUSSION
Our data show that environmental exposure to Neu5Gc is
associated with less nonatopic asthma and wheezing in children
and has anti-inflammatory effects in murine models of airway and
gut inflammation, regardless of whether Neu5Gc is endogenously
present. Human subjects are able to take up Neu5Gc through fluid
pinocytosis and specific lysosomal transporters and incorporate it
in newly synthesized glycoproteins.27,28,33 Therefore Neu5Gc
administration in human subjects might be protective, indepen-
dent of whether diet-derived Neu5Gc is already present on cells.
This suggests that not only microbial but also nonmicrobial

 components in the environment have anti-inflammatory effects,
adding a new aspect to the hygiene hypothesis.
Various environmental exposures have been shown to reduce
the child’s risk of atopic disease and asthma.2 The microbial di-
versity and load in a child’s environment has been suggested to
be the principal factor in driving maturation of the child’s immune
system toward a nonatopic phenotype.8-10 The relevance of such
exposures is supported by the observation that farmers’ children
express higher levels of CD14 and TLR (ie, innate immune recep-
tors

Neu5Gc can be regarded as an example of a non–microbial-
associated molecular pattern. The beneficial effect of Neu5Gc
seems to be anti-inflammatory and anti-TH17. Treg cell numbers
were increased and IL-17 secretion of T helper cells was
decreased after Neu5Gc administration. Moreover, epidemio-
logic data showed positive associations between anti-Neu5Gc
IgG levels and expression of the Treg cell markers Foxp3 or IL-
10 in children’s white blood cells. TH17 and Treg cell subsets
have a dichotomous character influenced by several cytokines.
TH17 cells are critical for the immune response against bacterial
and fungal infections, and increased levels in peripheral blood and
lesions are associated with pathology in patients with multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn disease, and ul-
cerative colitis.36 Treg cells are known to control several inflam-
matory diseases without influencing the immune response against
pathogens.37,38 Finally, Neu5Gc treatment of dendritic cells
induced a regulatory phenotype. Regulatory dendritic cells have

 been described to play a role in resolution of chronic inflamma-
tion.32 The anti-inflammatory effects of Neu5Gc resemble the ef-
fects previously described for short-chain fatty acids, anti-
inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids, or certain biogenic
amines.39-42 Whether the effects of Neu5Gc are also mediated
by G protein–coupled receptor signaling or epigenetic mecha-
nisms needs to be investigated in future experiments.
Several studies have previously shown that dietary exposure to
Neu5Gc in combination with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies was
associated with inflammation and cancer.31,43-45 In contrast, the
results of our murine models show a significant protective effect
on airway and gut inflammatory responses. The contrasting find-
ings could be related to the fact that we applied Neu5Gc in a high-
ly purified form, which did not induce an antibody response in
CMAH-deficient mice, which was also previously shown by
others.14 Because of the lack of an antibody response in mice
and the absence of antibodies in the in vitro dendritic cell and
lymphocyte models, we propose that it is the Neu5Gc molecule
itself and not the antibody response to the sialic acid that is
anti-inflammatory. Indeed, the influence of anti-Neu5Gc anti-
bodies on tumor progression is dose dependent, with low levels
promoting and high levels inhibiting tumor growth.46 To our
knowledge, there is no study showing that farmers’ children
have an increased risk of cancer.47
Our data suggest that not only immunologic danger signals
derived from microbes but also non–microbial-associated mo-
lecular patterns can be protective environmental exposures.
Key messages
d Anti-Neu5Gc antibody levels correlate with living on a
farm and increased peripheral blood Foxp3 expression
and are inversely associated with nonatopic asthma and
wheezing in children.
d Exposure to Neu5Gc reduces the severity of airway and
intestinal inflammation in mice.
d Exposure to Neu5Gc induced Treg cells and reduced IL-
171 T helper cells in the lungs of mice.

Linear and logistic (*) regression for the association between immunologic markers
(target variable) and exposure variables is shown. Average odds ratios across tertiles of
anti-Neu5Gc levels are shown.
_1 and _2, Isoforms of the respective gene; aGMR, adjusted geometric mean ratio;
aOR, adjusted odds ratio.
*Geometric means ratios/odds ratios adjusted for being a farmers’ child, sex, and age.
CIs adjusted for multiple testing by using the Bonferroni method.
�IL-13 and IL-4 were dichotomized because of the high proportion of nondetectable
values.
