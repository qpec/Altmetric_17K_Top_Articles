IMPORTANCE Clinical trials have documented that lowering blood pressure reduces
cardiovascular disease and premature deaths. However, the optimal target for reduction
of systolic blood pressure (SBP) is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of mean achieved SBP levels with the risk of
cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in adults with hypertension treated with
antihypertensive therapy.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to December 15, 2015,
supplemented by manual searches of the bibliographies of retrieved articles.
STUDY SELECTION Studies included were clinical trials with random allocation to an
antihypertensive medication, control, or treatment target. Studies had to have reported a
difference in mean achieved SBP of 5 mm Hg or more between comparison groups.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted from each study independently and
in duplicate by at least 2 investigators according to a standardized protocol. Network
meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled randomized results comparing the association of
each 5–mm Hg SBP category with clinical outcomes after adjusting for baseline risk.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS Forty-two trials, including 144 220 patients, met the eligibility criteria. In general,
there were linear associations between mean achieved SBP and risk of cardiovascular disease
and mortality, with the lowest risk at 120 to 124 mm Hg. Randomized groups with a mean
achieved SBP of 120 to 124 mm Hg had a hazard ratio (HR) for major cardiovascular disease
of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60-0.83) compared with randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP
of 130 to 134 mm Hg, an HR of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.48-0.72) compared with those with a mean
achieved SBP of 140 to 144 mm Hg, an HR of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.34-0.63) compared with those
with a mean achieved SBP of 150 to 154 mm Hg, and an HR of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.26-0.51)
compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 160 mm Hg or more. Likewise,
randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 120 to 124 mm Hg had an HR for all-cause
mortality of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.93) compared with randomized groups with a mean
achieved SBP of 130 to 134 mm Hg, an HR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45-0.77) compared with those
with a mean achieved SBP of 140 to 144 mm Hg, an HR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.36-0.71) compared
with those with a mean achieved SBP of 150 to 154 mm Hg, and an HR of 0.47 (95% CI,
0.32-0.67) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 160 mm Hg or more.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that reducing SBP to levels below
currently recommended targets significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and
all-cause mortality. These findings support more intensive control of SBP among adults
with hypertension.

ypertension is the leading global preventable risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature
death.1,2 Observational epidemiologic studies have
shown a strong, independent, and log-linear association be-
tween usual systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality from
CVD and all causes, with no evidence of a threshold down to
at least 115 mm Hg.3 Randomized clinical trials have docu-
mentedthatloweringbloodpressure(BP)withcommonlyused
regimens reduces the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.4,5
However,posthocanalysesbasedonachievedBPinsomeclini-
cal trials, in which the results were not analyzed according to
the randomized treatment assignment, identified a J-shaped
association between achieved BP and risk of CVD and all-
cause mortality, especially between achieved BP and coro-
nary heart disease (CHD).6,7
The uncertainty of optimal goals for treatment for pa-
tients with hypertension has resulted in inconsistent recom-
mendations for BP targets in clinical practice guidelines.4,8,9
For example, compared with the 2003 Seventh Report of the
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure,4 the 2014 Evi-
dence-BasedGuidelinefortheManagementofHighBloodPres-
sure in Adults8 raised the recommended SBP treatment goal
from less than 130 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg for patients
with type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease and from less
than 140 mm Hg to less than 150 mm Hg for individuals 60
years of age or older. Recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure In-
tervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that intensive treatment
(targeting an SBP of <120 mm Hg), as compared with stan-
dard treatment (targeting an SBP of <140 mm Hg), signifi-
cantly reduced CVD and all-cause mortality among adults
with hypertension who were at high risk for CVD, but with-
out diabetes or stroke.10 The data from SPRINT support a
more intensive SBP treatment goal, although concerns re-
main regarding its generalizability to populations at large with
hypertension.
Finding the optimal SBP target could have far-reaching im-
plicationsforthereductionofCVDandprematuredeathingen-
eral populations. By using a network meta-analysis to com-
bine available data from randomized clinical trials, we
compared the association of different levels of SBP reduction
with the risk of major CVD, stroke, CHD, CVD mortality, and
all-cause mortality.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
WesearchedMEDLINEandEMBASEusingthefollowingsearch
terms as medical subject headings and key words: (antihyper-
tensive agents OR blood pressure lowering OR antihypertensive
treatment) AND (cardiovascular disease OR coronary disease OR
myocardial infarction OR stroke OR heart failure OR mortal-
ity). The searches were conducted without language or date
restriction, from inception to December 15, 2015. We limited
searches to randomized clinical trials in human adults. Addi-
tional trials were identified by hand-searching bibliographies
from included studies, reviews, and meta-analyses.
Study Selection
Titles and abstracts of retrieved articles were independently
screened by at least 2 of us (J.D.B., C.L., P.S., and X.B.). Ar-
ticles deemed potentially eligible by either reviewer were
retrieved for full-text review. Disagreements on full-text re-
view were resolved by discussion and consensus.
Studies were included if they met the following criteria:
(1) participants were randomly allocated to an antihyperten-
sive medication, control, or treatment target; (2) the alloca-
tion to antihypertensive treatment was independent of other
treatment regimens; (3) the sample size was 100 patients or
more in each treatment group; (4) trial duration was 6 months
or more; (5) one or more events for an outcome of interest were
reported in each treatment group; (6) mean achieved SBP level
was reported for each treatment group, and the difference in
mean achieved SBP between the comparison groups was 5
mm Hg or more; and (7) outcomes included major CVD, stroke,
CHD, CVD mortality, or all-cause mortality. Clinical trials with
mean achieved SBP of 160 mm Hg or more in both compari-
son groups were excluded because they do not contribute in-
formation to the optimal target for SBP treatment. For stud-
ies with multiple publications, data from the article with the
longest trial follow-up time were included.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Data abstraction was conducted by 2 of us (J.D.B., C.L., P.S.,
and X.B.) who independently used a predefined, standard-
ized protocol and data collection instrument. Information was
recorded on sample size, demographic characteristics, and
medicalhistoryofthetrialparticipants;BPmeasurementmeth-
ods; mean achieved BP during treatment; follow-up time; out-
come ascertainment methods; and number of events for each
outcome. The predefined outcomes were major CVD events
(including CHD, stroke, heart failure, and CVD deaths), stroke,
CHD, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality.
Risk of bias was assessed by 2 of us (J.D.B., C.L., P.S., and
X.B.) using the Cochrane Collaboration’
s risk of bias tool, based
on 7 domains11: random sequence generation, allocation con-
cealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessment,
incomplete data, selective reporting, intention-to-treat analy-
sis, and other sources of bias. Disagreement was resolved by
consensus.
Key Points
Question What is the optimal target for reduction of systolic
blood pressure among patients with hypertension?
Findings In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of
42 trials, including 144 220 patients, linear associations were seen
between mean achieved systolic blood pressure and risk of
cardiovascular disease and mortality, with the lowest risk at a
systolic blood pressure of 120 to 124 mm Hg.
Meaning Reducing systolic blood pressure below currently
recommended targets with commonly used antihypertensive
medications may significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease and all-cause mortality.

 Data Synthesis and Analysis
Network meta-analysis allows pooling of results derived from
direct and indirect evidence across multiple different treat-
ments while preserving the benefits of randomized compari-
sons within each trial.12 We constructed network diagrams
for each outcome and the overall network to visualize direct
andindirectcomparisonsbetweenSBPtreatmentlevels.Treat-
ment nodes were defined by categorizing SBP into the follow-
ing 10 separate treatment levels: less than 120, 120 to 124, 125
to 129, 130 to 134, 135 to 139, 140 to 144, 145 to 149, 150 to
154, 155 to 159, and 160 mm Hg or more. We used a Bayesian
hierarchical random-effects model with a binomial likeli-
hood and complementary log-log link function to model the
probability of events.13 Hazard ratios (HRs) for each possible
comparison were calculated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulation.
For an individual trial, each randomization group was as-
signed to 1 category of achieved SBP according to the group’
s
mean SBP level during the trial, irrespective of medications
used or initial treatment target. Thus, each trial contributed
to 2 distinct achieved SBP categories based on randomization
groups. Hazard ratios comparing the lower vs higher achieved
SBP categories from each trial using intention-to-treat analy-
sis results within specific SBP comparison groups (eg, 120-
124 vs 130-134 mm Hg) were pooled. Therefore, randomized
comparisons within each trial were preserved. The pooled HR
for a given comparison is composed of direct evidence ob-
tained from trials comparing the 2 SBP randomization groups
and indirect evidence obtained from the association of all ran-
domized SBP comparisons in the network. In addition, we con-
ducted the following 2 sensitivity analyses: the first exclud-
ingSPRINT10toassessitsinfluenceontheresults,givenitslarge
sample size and treatment effects, and the second excluding
trials with 4 or more categories deemed at “high” or “un-
clear” risk of bias.
To account for trial heterogeneity in the intervention du-
ration and baseline risk of CVD or mortality, we adjusted for
triallengthandeventrate(ormortality)ofthereferencegroups
for each trial in the model.14 The median of the posterior dis-
tribution was selected as the point estimate, bounded by the
2.5th and 97.5th percentiles to form a 95% CI. Heterogeneity
was assessed by monitoring the posterior between-trial SD. We
used inconsistency models, design-by-treatment interaction
models, and the node-splitting method to evaluate the differ-
ences between direct and indirect comparisons.15,16
Finally, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots
and the Egger test for direct comparisons with 4 or more stud-
ies. All analyses were conducted using WinBUGS, version 1.4.3
(Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit), R, version 3.2.1
(R Project for Statistical Computing), and Stata, version 12.1
(StataCorp LP). A detailed description of the methods is avail-
able in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Results
Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE yielded 2721 records, and
manual searches of bibliographies of reviews, meta-
analyses, and other trial publications identified an additional
26 articles (Figure 1). After removal of duplicates, 2371 titles
and abstracts were screened for eligibility, and 449 article texts
were reviewed in full.
Atotalof42trialswereincludedintheanalyses,withacom-
binedsamplesizeof144 220individuals(eTable1intheSupple-
ment). The mean achieved SBP levels ranged from 114 to
171 mm Hg among treatment groups. The trials were con-
ducted in diverse study populations with various comorbidi-
ties,and30trialsincludedparticipantswithtype2diabetes.Trial
duration ranged from 6 months to more than 8 years, with a
meanfollow-upof3.7yearsacrossalltrials.Mosttrialsusedstan-
dardized BP measurement methods (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment) and had a low risk of bias (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The network of included trials was well connected, with
manydirectcomparisonsacrossthecategoriesofmeanachieved
SBP levels (Figure 2; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The group
with an SPB of 130 to 134 mm Hg defined the center of the net-
work, with 21 trials directly comparing a mean achieved SBP of
130 to 134 mm Hg with 7 other mean achieved SBP groups. A
total of 31 trials contributed to network comparisons for major
CVD, 27 trials for stroke, 27 trials for CHD, 41 trials for all-cause
mortality, and 33 trials for CVD mortality. Descriptions of out-
comes are available in eTable 4 in the Supplement.
In general, there were linear associations between mean
achieved SBP levels and the risk of major CVD, stroke, CHD,

 mm Hg. A second sensitivity analysis excluding trials with 4
or more categories deemed at “high” or “unclear” risk of bias
did not substantively change the results compared with the
main analyses (eTables 11-13 in the Supplement).
Model fit for all outcomes was adequate according to the
Bayesian deviance information criterion, and the baseline risk
covariate did not significantly alter the models (eTables 14-18
in the Supplement). Heterogeneity was present for each out-
come, with random-effects models fitting better than fixed-
effects models according to the Bayesian deviance informa-
tion criterion. The magnitude of heterogeneity was low to
moderate, with a between-trial SD of 0.081 for major CVD and
an SD ranging from 0.103 to 0.248 for the other outcomes
(eTables 14-18 in the Supplement).
There was no network-wide evidence of inconsistency
between direct and indirect comparisons in any of the out-
comes based on inconsistency models and design-by-
treatment interaction analyses (eTables 19-23 in the Supple-
ment). However, inconsistency was present in a few individual
comparisonsbasedonnode-splittinganalyses(majorCVD,125-
129 vs 130-134 mm Hg; CHD, 125-129 vs 130-134 mm Hg; and
CVD mortality, 120-124 vs 130-134 mm Hg, and 120-124 vs 135-
139 mm Hg). There was no evidence of publication bias.
Discussion
This network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials docu-
mented significant and linear associations between mean
achieved SBP and the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. The
lowest risks for CVD and all-cause mortality were among ran-
domizedgroupswithameanachievedSBPof120to124mmHg.
ThesefindingssupportrecentlypublishedresultsfromSPRINT10
and suggest a benefit of reducing SBP below the currently rec-
ommended target among adults with hypertension.8
The SPRINT trial randomly assigned 9361 persons 50 years
of age or older with an SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg who had an
increased risk of CVD, but without diabetes or stroke, to re-
ceiveintensivetreatmentorstandardtreatmentofSBP.10Blood
pressurewasmeasuredinaccordancewithaprespecified,stan-
dardized protocol. The mean achieved SBP was 121.5 mm Hg
in the intensive-treatment group and 134.6 mm Hg in the stan-
dard-treatment group during the intervention. During a me-
dian follow-up of 3.26 years, a significant 25% reduction in the
primary composite outcome of CVD events (HR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.64-0.89; P < .001) and a 27% reduction in all-cause mortal-
ity (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.90; P = .003) were reported.
In our network meta-analysis, compared with random-
ized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 130 to 134 mm Hg,
CVD was reduced by 29% (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83), and
all-causemortalitywasreducedby27%(HR,0.73;95%CI,0.58-
0.93), among randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP
of 120 to 124 mm Hg. This agreement persisted even after ex-
cluding SPRINT in a sensitivity analysis. The findings from
SPRINT10 and our network meta-analysis suggest that a more
intensive treatment target than currently recommended
(eg, SBP of 120-124 mm Hg) provides additional benefits for
prevention of CVD complications and all-cause mortality.
Our study contributes additional information on SBP
management strategies beyond SPRINT.17 First, our study
included 42 clinical trials conducted for 144 220 patients
with various comorbidities (including diabetes and stroke),
age ranges, and mean BP levels at baseline. Therefore, these
results are generalizable to populations at large with hyper-
tension. Second, our study compared multiple levels of
achieved SBP on the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality and
found positive and linear associations between achieved
SBP and clinical outcomes. Our findings do not support the
existence of a J-shaped association between achieved SBP
and the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. Furthermore,
our study indicates that there is a linear association between
the magnitudes of SBP reduction and the risk of CVD and
all-cause mortality. For example, by lowering SBP by 10
mm Hg to achieve the treatment goal of 120 to 124 mm Hg,
the risk of CVD was reduced by 29% (95% CI, 17%-40%), by
lowering SBP by 20 mm Hg, the risk of CVD was reduced
by 42% (95% CI, 28%-52%), by lowering SBP by 30 mm Hg,
the risk of CVD was reduced by 54% (95% CI, 37%-66%),
and by lowering SBP by 40 mm Hg or more, the risk of CVD
was reduced by 64% (95% CI, 49%-74%). These data support
a more intensive SBP management approach to achieve a
lower SBP goal.

 Severalmeta-analyseshaveexaminedtheassociationwith
CVD and mortality of more intensive vs less intensive treat-
ment of BP.18,19 Recently, Xie and colleagues18 reported an up-
dated meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials, including 44 989 par-
ticipants,ontheassociationofintensiveBPreductionwithCVD
outcomes. The mean achieved SBP was 133 mm Hg (range,
118-144 mm Hg) in the more intensive treatment group and 140
mm Hg (range, 124-154 mm Hg) in the less intensive treatment
group. Intensive BP-lowering treatment was associated with a
reduction of 14% (95% CI, 4%-22%) for major CVD, 13% (95%
CI, 0%-24%) for myocardial infarction, and 22% (95% CI, 10%-
32%)forstroke.However,moreintensivetreatmenthadnosig-
nificant association with CVD mortality (9%; 95% CI, –11% to
26%) or all-cause mortality (9%; 95% CI, –3% to 19%). Another
recent meta-analysis conducted by Ettehad and colleagues19
suggested that every 10–mm Hg reduction in SBP, including to
levelslessthan130mmHg,significantlyreducedtheriskofma-
jor CVD and CHD. Our network meta-analysis results comple-
ment and expand on the findings from these traditional meta-
analyses.Ouranalyses,basedonmanyachievedSBPcategories
while maintaining randomized treatment assignments, show a
beneficial linear association between more intensively re-
duced mean achieved SBPs and clinical outcomes, and iden-
tify the lowest risk at a mean SBP of 120 to 124 mm Hg.
The association of intensive treatment in subgroups of pa-
tientswithcertaincomorbidities,especiallytype2diabetes,have
been of particular interest.18,20-23 The Action to Control Cardio-
vascular Risk in Diabetes trial examined the association of an
intensive SBP target (<120 mm Hg) compared with a standard
SBP target (<140 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes, finding a
nonsignificant benefit on reducing risk for CVD events, which
could be a consequence of reduced statistical power or use
of a factorial design.20,21 A 2012 meta-analysis conducted by
McBrien and colleagues22 reported a small reduction in the risk
of stroke associated with more intensive BP reduction in adults
with type 2 diabetes but found inconclusive results for mortal-
ity and CHD. Another recent meta-analysis by Brunström and
Carlberg23 reported increased risk of CVD mortality among
patients with diabetes who had a baseline SBP of less than 140
mm Hg and reduced their level of SBP via treatment, suggest-
ing a J-shaped association. We were able to include many trials
of patients with diabetes and other comorbidities. Our find-
ings do not support the existence of a J-shaped association
among populations at large with hypertension.
Strengths and Limitations
There are several strengths in this network meta-analysis com-
pared with the previous meta-analyses that used traditional
analysis methods. Network meta-analysis methods offer a
unique advantage compared with traditional meta-regression
techniques by allowing the simultaneous comparison of mul-
tiple achieved SBP levels on clinical outcomes while preserv-
ing trial-level treatment randomization and its associated pro-
tection against bias. Our study allowed for comparisons of a
wider range of mean achieved SBP levels than has been pos-
sible in traditional meta-analyses, with a spread from less than
120 mm Hg to more than 160 mm Hg, and identified the lowest
risks for CVD and all-cause mortality at a mean achieved SBP
of 120 to 124 mm Hg. Another strength of our network meta-
analysis is that it uses all available information (direct and in-
direct comparisons) to compare the association of each mean
achievedSBPlevelwithclinicaloutcomes.Therefore,itwaspos-
sible to base the comparisons between various SBP levels on a
much larger number of clinical trials compared with similar
meta-analyses limited to trials examining more intensive com-
pared with less intensive therapy; our study included 42 trials
compared with the traditional analysis from Xie et al18 that in-
cluded 19 trials. Our data indicate that there was no significant
difference between direct and indirect comparisons at the net-
work level. In addition, we used a systematic and comprehen-
sive search strategy to identify a wide coverage of available an-
tihypertensiveclinicaltrials.Mostoftheincludedtrialshadlow
risk of bias; a sensitivity analysis indicated that trials with un-
clear risk of bias did not substantially influence our results. Fi-
nally, our analyses included a large number of trials conducted
in diverse patient populations and were adjusted for differ-
ences in intervention duration and baseline risk among trials,
which increases the generalizability of our findings.
Our findings should be interpreted in light of several limi-
tations, most of which have been common to all meta-
analyses conducted in this topic area. First, we had limited
sample size in some mean achieved SBP comparisons. For
example, only 3 trials achieved mean SBP levels below 120
mm Hg, with a combined sample size of 7333. Thus, most of
the evidence in our analyses is based on trials treating partici-
pantstoachieveSBPlevelsabove120mmHg.Second,fewtrials
reported heart failure outcomes, which resulted in an insuf-
ficiently connected network to analyze this outcome. Simi-
larly, we were unable to assess the association of intensive SBP
reduction with kidney disease outcomes, dementia, or ad-
verse events such as hypotension or falling, which have been
concerns with intensive treatment of BP.18 Furthermore, we
were unable to conduct subgroup analyses by age, race/
ethnicity,historyofCVD,stroke,chronickidneydisease,ordia-
betes owing to insufficient data. Finally, we defined treat-
ment nodes according to the mean achieved SBP in each
randomization group, which does not consider the distribu-
tion of individual SBP levels within groups. Thus, mean
achieved SBP groups may represent a range of SBPs. In addi-
tion, analysis of mean achieved SBP does not guide treat-
ment decisions regarding diastolic BP.
There are several implications for clinicians based on find-
ings from SPRINT,10 other meta-analyses, and our network
meta-analysis. First, data suggest that treatment to achieve an
SBP below currently recommended guidelines reduces the risk
for major CVD and all-cause mortality in adults with hyper-
tension. However, there may be a tradeoff between these ben-
efits and potential adverse effects of intensive SBP reduction,
including hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and kid-
ney injury.10,18 Thus, clinicians should continue to monitor
acute adverse effects in individual patients and make treat-
ment decisions based on accurate BP measurements, accord-
ing to standardized protocols similar to those used in clinical
trials. Second, although our analysis suggests that intensive
SBP reduction reduces risk for major CVD and all-cause mor-
tality in populations at large with hypertension, including in

 those with diabetes, the outcomes of intensive SBP reduction
for patients with diabetes warrant further exploration. Clini-
ciansshouldbeparticularlyvigilantwhentreatingpatientswith
comorbidities, including diabetes. Finally, the most effective
strategies for implementing more intensive SBP reduction in
general clinical practice remain to be established. Future re-
search should consider the best practices for treating patients
to reduce SBP levels below current guidelines in the routine
clinical management of hypertension.
Conclusions
Our study indicates that treating patients to reduce SBP be-
low currently recommended targets may significantly reduce
risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. These findings support
more intensive SBP control among adults with hypertension
and suggest the need for revising the current clinical guide-
lines for management of hypertension.
