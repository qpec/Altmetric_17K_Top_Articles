Abstract
Background—Excess energy intake from meals consumed away from home is implicated as a 
major contributor to obesity, and ~50% of US restaurants are individual or small-chain (non–
chain) establishments that do not provide nutrition information.
Objective—To measure the energy content of frequently ordered meals in non–chain restaurants 
in three US locations, and compare with the energy content of meals from large-chain restaurants, 
energy requirements, and food database information.
Design—A multisite random-sampling protocol was used to measure the energy contents of the 
most frequently ordered meals from the most popular cuisines in non–chain restaurants, together 
with equivalent meals from large-chain restaurants.
Setting—Meals were obtained from restaurants in San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA; and Little 
Rock, AR, between 2011 and 2014.
Main outcome measures—Meal energy content determined by bomb calorimetry.
Statistical analysis performed—Regional and cuisine differences were assessed using a 
mixed model with restaurant nested within region×cuisine as the random factor. Paired t tests were 
used to evaluate differences between non–chain and chain meals, human energy requirements, and 
food database values.
Results—Meals from non–chain restaurants contained 1,205±465 kcal/meal, amounts that were 
not significantly different from equivalent meals from large-chain restaurants (+5.1%; P=0.41). 
There was a significant effect of cuisine on non–chain meal energy, and three of the four most 
popular cuisines (American, Italian, and Chinese) had the highest mean energy (1,495 kcal/meal). 
Ninety-two percent of meals exceeded typical energy requirements for a single eating occasion.

 Conclusions—Non–chain restaurants lacking nutrition information serve amounts of energy that 
are typically far in excess of human energy requirements for single eating occasions, and are 
equivalent to amounts served by the large-chain restaurants that have previously been criticized for 
providing excess energy. Restaurants in general, rather than specific categories of restaurant, 
expose patrons to excessive portions that induce overeating through established biological 
mechanisms.

Rates of obesity are at epidemic levels in most countries and continue to worsen.1 Excess 
energy intake is strongly implicated as an underlying contributor of obesity in the United 
States, based on the 217 to 491 kcal/day increase in per capita food consumption and self-
reported energy intake during the past 40 years.2,3 However, the reasons for this change are 
poorly understood. A detailed understanding of the specific sources of excess dietary energy 
is likely to lead to more nuanced approaches to obesity reduction, and the potential role of 
different types of restaurants requires further examination.
Meals consumed away from home have been proposed as a major contributor to rising 
energy intake, and previous research has noted the high energy contents of fast food and 
meals from large-chain restaurants,4,5 the increasing frequency of eating out,6 and the 
correlation between the frequency of fast-food consumption and high body mass index.7–12 
Fast food has been a particular focus of study because of its low cost and the availability of 
nutrition information. Furthermore, some,11 but not all,8 work has suggested that fast food 
may be particularly obesogenic.
In theory, eating out does not need to lead to overeating if consumers are able to practice 
restraint, but large portions typical of many restaurants appear to consistently override 
restraint and result in overeating.13–15 Almost all research on portion size to date has 
focused on restaurants providing nutrition information,13,16–18 and to our knowledge only 
one study has measured the energy content of foods prepared by restaurants that do not 
provide nutrition information.19 Moreover, that study was conducted in a single city, and the 
extent to which excess energy in restaurant food is a ubiquitous problem or a problem 
specific to particular classes of restaurants is uncertain. Such information is needed for the 
design of more targeted and, hopefully, more effective, public health interventions.
Therefore, previous work19 was extended to conduct a multisite investigation of the energy 
contents of the most frequently ordered meals from the most popular types of individual and 
small-chain (non–chain) restaurants in different regions of the United States. Results were 
compared with both normative data on human energy requirements and data for equivalent 
meals from large-chain restaurants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The energy contents of a representative sample of meals were measured from randomly 
selected non–chain restaurants in three geographically diverse cities (Little Rock, AR; 
Urban et al.

 Boston, MA; and San Francisco, CA) together with data for matching meals from large-
chain restaurant meals. Four hundred twenty meals were collected between 2011 and 2014, 
which to our knowledge makes this the largest study of its kind. A subset of the Boston data 
was published previously.19 This study was deemed exempt under federal regulation 45 CFR 
§46.101(b).
Selection of Restaurants and Food
Five non–chain establishments (ie, independent restaurants and small chains with fewer than 
20 outlets) in each of the nine most popular cuisines20 in three geographical regions were 
targeted for random selection from a comprehensive list of restaurants generated by Internet 
searches of regional restaurants. Restaurants had to be within 25 miles of downtown Boston 
or Little Rock, or 10 miles of downtown San Francisco, to ensure a robust pool of 
restaurants within each region. Random selection was achieved by assigning a number to 
eligible restaurants, generating a random order of numbers, and selecting the first five for 
each category in each region. Restaurants that did not have all eligible meals were excluded, 
and the next restaurant on the list was selected. Due to a shortage of eligible restaurants in 
some regions, 364 meals from 123 non–chain restaurants were collected.
Large-chain restaurants in the top 400 for sales21 were also targeted that had ≥1 outlet in ≥2 
regions and offered the same entrées targeted in the non–chain restaurants. Matching meals 
were collected from the same chains in all regions where possible, and there were 56 
equivalent meals from 21 large chains (9, 5, and 7 restaurants in Boston, San Francisco, and 
Little Rock, respectively).
Within cuisines, targeted meals were the three most frequently ordered entrées and 
accompanying side dishes, as described previously (entrées and side dishes are the most 
frequently ordered items19,22). The same entrées were ordered by researchers from each 
targeted restaurant to examine variability between restaurants and regions. Dinner-sized 
portions of the target meals were ordered as takeout by researchers, who did not identify 
themselves as such. Restaurants were asked to separately package individual food items.
Energy Determination
Purchased meals were transported to the local team’s laboratory and weighed. Meals 
collected in San Francisco and Little Rock were packaged in freezer-safe bags and shipped 
on dry ice to Boston. The energy contents of meal components were determined using a 
validated bomb calorimetry method accurate to 2%.19,23 In brief, foods were blended, 
freeze-dried, and ground into a homogenous powder, and the heat of combustion was 
quantified in duplicate samples using benzoic acid as a standard. The total (gross) energy of 
each food was determined as the product of total dried food weight and the mean heat of 
combustion of the duplicates.
Statistical Analysis
Meal gross energy content was the primary outcome, and portion size (in grams) and energy 
density (kilocalories per gram) were also examined. Descriptive statistics of both individual 
meals (entrées plus sides) and entrées by themselves were obtained, and meal values were

 compared with normative values for human energy requirements.24 Regional and cuisine 
differences were assessed using a mixed model with restaurant nested within region times 
cuisine type as the random factor, and American cuisine and the Boston region were used as 
references. Separate mixed models were fit to examine the effects of portion size, energy 
density, and gross energy on each other across all regions, cuisines, and meals. The same 
random factor above was the only covariate in these models. Mean paired differences of 
non–chain and chain meals were compared with zero using a paired t test and were 
compared by cuisine type using analysis of variance with least square means and the Tukey 
post hoc test.
Restaurant foods in the current Nutrient Database for Standard Reference at the time of the 
study (SR-27) (US Department of Agriculture [USDA]) with independently measured 
nutrient information for items that matched study foods were identified and extracted for 
comparison with equivalent meals from non–chain restaurants using a paired t test. Standard 
Atwater factors were used to revert the SR-27 energy values to gross energy values using the 
equation: gross energy=(fat g×9.4)+(protein g×5.65)+(total carbohydrates g×4.15) as 
previously described.19,23 Thus, measured energy from foods in this study could be directly 
compared to equivalent energy values in SR-27. Before analyses (conducted by LEU) (SAS 
for Windows, version 9.3, 2011, SAS Institute Inc), data with nonnormal distribution were 
transformed. Values are presented as means±standard deviation unless noted.
RESULTS
Meals from non–chain restaurants contained 1,205±465 kcal energy, which is ~55% of the 
typical daily energy requirement of 2,000 kcal/day for an adult woman and ~44% of the 
typical daily energy requirement of 2,500 kcal/day for an adult man after accounting for 
typical energy losses in digestion.24 Variability in meal energy content was very high (±465 
kcal; range=113 to 3,008 kcal/meal) (Table 1, available online at www.andjrnl.org), and 92% 
contained more than 570 kcal, which can be used as a benchmark for the energy requirement 
of a typical adult woman at a single lunch or dinner meal, as justified below. Mean portion 
weight of meals was 689±261 g, and mean meal energy density was 1.87±0.68 kcal/g. The 
entrées provided most of the meal energy content (1,000±430 kcal, data not shown), and 
sides came with 49% of meals (398±26 kcal). The energy contents, portion sizes, and energy 
density of specific cuisines within regions are given in Table 2.
Figure 1 summarizes meal energy content, portion size, and energy density by cuisine and 
region, and Tables 3 and 4 (available online at www.andjrnl.org) show the statistical model 
predicting meal energy content, portion size, and energy density from region, cuisine, and 
restaurant, using American cuisine and Boston as the references for comparison. There was 
substantial difference in mean meal energy content among cuisines. Specifically, Italian, 
Chinese, and Indian meals were not significantly different in energy content from American 
meals (1,556±492, 1,478±525, and 1,250±324 kcal/meal vs 1,451±400 kcal/meal, 
respectively), but Greek, Japanese, Vietnamese, Mexican, and Thai contained less energy, by 
20% to 38%, and Greek meals had the lowest mean value (904±413 kcal). Overall the three 
cuisines with the highest mean energy (American, Italian, and Chinese) averaged 1,485 kcal/
meal. In addition, there were some regional differences in meal energy content of modest

 magnitude. Specifically, compared with meals from Boston, meals from Little Rock and San 
Francisco contained significantly less energy (1,268 vs 1,179 and 1,166 kcal/meal, 
respectively; P=0.03 for both) and had smaller portions (737 vs 644 and 679 g/meal, 
respectively; P≤0.03); however, after adjusting the alpha to .003 for multiple comparisons, 
none of the differences remained significant, and 64% of between-meal variability in energy 
content was not accounted for by cuisine and region. There were no significant differences 
among regions in meal energy density (P≥0.69).
To further evaluate predictors of meal energy content, relationships between meal portion 
weight, meal energy density, and meal energy content were explored across all cuisines, 
regions, and meal types. As shown in Figure 2, both portion weight and meal energy density 
significantly predicted meal energy content, and portion size was also inversely correlated 
with energy density. Individually, both portion size and energy density were only weakly 
predictive of meal energy content (partial R2≤0.25).
In addition to the analysis comparing data within non–chain restaurants, the non–chain data 
were evaluated against comparable data for meals from large-chain restaurants. For this 
analysis, 56 meals from large-chain restaurants were identified that matched 171 meals from 
non–chain restaurants, and a comparison was made both for total meals and for entrées 
alone. The matching large-chain meals contained 68 fewer kilocalories than non–chain 
meals (P=0.41) (Table 5). Comparisons of large-chain and non–chain meals by cuisine type 
were also not significant (P≥0.10). In addition, no site differences were found for the large-
chain meals (data not shown, P=0.73).
The data for non–chain meals were further compared with equivalent data from the current 
national USDA database. The database contained independently measured energy values for 
only nine items that matched foods in our study, although the study measured the most 
frequently ordered items (Table 6). On average, the database values were 15 kcal/food 
(2.3%) less than measured values (P=0.44). It should be noted that the SR-27 database used 
here is an updated USDA database; our previous study indicating underestimation of 
restaurant meal energy contents was performed with release 24, which had only four food 
matches for comparison.
DISCUSSION
Meals consumed away from home are recognized to be an important contributor to the 
increase in energy intake since 1970.25 Recent legislation requiring restaurants with ≥20 
outlets to disclose nutrition information26 may help increase selection of menu items with 
lower energy, but only ~50% of restaurant outlets will be affected by the new legislation. To 
our knowledge, only one previous study has measured the energy content of meals from 
restaurants that do not disclose nutrition information,19 and that study was conducted in a 
single city. This multisite study provides the most comprehensive information to date on the 
energy contents of the most frequently ordered meals from the most popular non–chain 
restaurant categories in the United States. Ninety-two percent of all measured meals 
contained amounts of energy that were in excess of human energy needs at a single meal, 
and amounts were comparable to those provided by the fast-food and large-chain restaurants

 that have previously been criticized for their role in the obesity epidemic.27 These new 
results suggest that restaurants in general, rather than specific types of restaurant, may 
facilitate high energy intake and obesity via excessive portion sizes. Based on this 
observation, new public health approaches to obesity reduction that include restaurants in 
general may be appropriate.
The primary finding of this study conducted in three geographically dispersed cities with 
very different socioeconomic profiles was that a wide range of non–chain restaurants lacking 
nutrition information served meals averaging 1,205 kcal/meal of gross energy for just a 
single entrée plate without appetizers, desserts, or energy-containing beverages, and that 
there is very large variability in energy between individual meals (range=113 to 3,008 kcal/
meal). Moreover, three of the four most popular cuisines (American, Italian, and Chinese) 
contained even more energy, averaging 1,495 kcal/meal. There was a significant effect of 
cuisine on meal energy content, but variability between meals was substantial and the 
relationships between meal energy content and portion size and energy density were weak, 
making it likely impossible for consumers to use visual cues such as portion size to 
accurately estimate the energy content of provided meals. These results confirm and extend 
our previous observation of extremely high energy values and high meal variability in one 
city,19 and in addition now demonstrate comparably high energy values to those served in 
large-chain restaurants providing nutrition information.
Interpreting portion sizes requires an understanding of both human energy requirements and 
cultural norms for meal frequency. Studies using gold-standard methodology show that adult 
women living in the United States require ~2,000 kcal/day to maintain weight (range=1,500 
to 2,500 kcal/day depending on age, height, and activity), whereas men require ~2,500 
kcal/day (range=2,000 to 3,000 kcal/day). It should be noted that these values are not low by 
the standards of human beings who are far more physically active; for example, modern-day 
subsistence farmers and hunter-gatherers,28,29 because energy expenditure for non–activity 
energy needs such as basal metabolism is the major determinant of energy requirements. 
Concerning eating patterns, national surveys indicate that three meals and one or more 
snacks per day is typical in the United States,30 with 57% of daily energy consumed at lunch 
plus dinner.31 For an adult woman requiring 2,000 kcal/day, the average energy content of a 
restaurant meal measured in this study provides the equivalent of two full meals. For an 
older, shorter woman requiring only 1,500 kcal/day, the same meal would provide 2.6 full 
meals, whereas for a tall young man it would be 1.3 full meals. These theoretical 
calculations underestimate the contribution of restaurants to excess energy, because, as noted 
above, three of the four most popular cuisines (American, Italian, and Chinese) also provide 
substantially more energy than average, and the meals tested in this study did not include 
drinks or additional courses. Nevertheless, they do illustrate that amounts of energy in 
typical restaurant meals can cause weight gain in large segments of the population unless 
there is compensation at other times of the day, which several studies indicate does not 
occur,14 and are consistent with data for restaurants providing nutrition information.32 It is 
also important to note that, in addition to their direct effect on energy intake, large restaurant 
portions may set up normative expectations regarding excessive portion size that may further 
increase energy intake at home.17

 Sixty-three percent of obese adults try to lose weight each year,33 and self-monitoring food 
intake is nationally recommended.34 Therefore, one interpretation of the results obtained 
here is the suggestion that the new mandatory disclosure of calorie information35 should be 
extended to non–chain restaurants. It is anticipated that this measure will be insufficient as a 
sole strategy to reduce obesity because, to date, the measured effects of calorie labeling on 
food choice and consumption have been nonexistent or small,35–38 which may be due to 
consumers’ limited ability to predict their own needs.39 This is not surprising when viewed 
from the biological perspective that exposure to large portions causes greater activation of 
the neurologic reward system and the autonomic nervous system than small portions 
(because the food exposure period is extended), which in turn results in persistent desire for 
food while food exposure exists and increased desire to eat.40,41 These biological 
mechanisms explain why large portions are consumed in amounts proportional to portion 
size.6,14,42 Mandatory menu labeling in all restaurants would help provide information, but 
based on these observations would not address the basic problem that human neurobiology, 
rather than lack of willpower, is a primary driver of overeating restaurant meals when 
excessive portions are served.
Because large portions encourage overeating, and restaurants provide large portions, there 
has been much interest in policies that might help nudge consumers to reduced-calorie 
choices in restaurants. Previous proposals to address this issue have included taxation of 
calories,43 mandatory restriction of portion sizes,44 and restriction of locations where fast 
food can be sold.45 Such policies are not mutually exclusive, but are likely to face 
substantial barriers in acceptance and implementation both from consumers and restaurant 
owners. Based on our finding that restaurants in general, rather than specific types of 
restaurants, serve excessively large portions, an alternative policy that could also be tested 
for effectiveness would be to give consumers the right to request half or one-third portions at 
proportional pricing. Such a policy, which does not exist today, would not restrict what 
restaurants offer or what consumers eat, but could allow additional choice by permitting 
people to choose portion size at the time of ordering, before the presentation of large 
portions triggers overeating. Because the same rules could be applied to all restaurants in a 
given area, this approach could nudge competitors toward innovation and business practices 
that improve quality and pricing in every dimension except large portions. Somewhat similar 
laws currently do this for some unit pricing requirements.45–50 For example, municipal 
ordinances and state laws that establish a consumers’ right to order smaller portions at 
proportionally lower prices would give restaurant consumers the same control they enjoy 
over food consumed at home, and eliminate restaurants’ incentives to offer the excessively 
large portions observed in this study. Future research should also explore what additional 
behavior-based nudges might be required for success if this new approach is adopted.
Limitations
Although to our knowledge this is the largest study of its kind, it was not possible to study 
all types of foods purchased in restaurants or all times of day. To be able to compare data 
across sites with sufficient power, collections were restricted to dinner-size portions of 
entrées and the sides that came with them, ordered as a takeout, and did not order breakfast 
items, café items, appetizers, desserts, or drinks. Pizza was also excluded because of the

 uncertainty over portion size. For these reasons, although the results indicate that restaurants 
substantially over-provide dietary energy to customers, they undoubtedly underestimate the 
full extent to which this occurs. Another study limitation is that only the energy content and 
energy density of foods were measured. Future studies will ideally add macronutrient 
contents and dietary fiber as well.
CONCLUSIONS
This multisite study found that non–chain restaurants provide amounts of dietary energy that 
are far in excess of human energy requirements, and are similar to amounts provided by the 
fast-food and large-chain restaurants that have previously been associated with promoting 
obesity. This study extends previous work and indicates that restaurants in general, rather 
than specific types of restaurants, can facilitate obesity by exposing patrons to portion sizes 
that induce overeating through established biological mechanisms that are largely outside 
conscious control. Based on these observations, new regulatory approaches to preventing 
involuntary overeating of restaurant meals may be appropriate, which may reduce the 
current incentive for restaurants to provide excessive portions.

aValues are from mixed multivariate models with either gross energy, portion size, or energy density as the dependent variable.
bGross energy and portion size values were transformed (square root) to achieve a normal distribution. Energy density values were normally distributed without transformation.
cBeta values describe the change in the dependent variable (square root of gross energy, square root of portion size, or energy density) for every 1 unit of change in the fixed effects holding all other effects 
equal.
dThe alpha is adjusted to <.00017 for multiple comparisons.
eSee Table 4 for beta estimates of specific meals.
