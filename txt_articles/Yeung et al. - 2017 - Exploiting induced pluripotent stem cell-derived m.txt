Chlamydia trachomatis remains a leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections and
preventable blindness worldwide. There are, however, limited in vitro models to study the role
of host genetics in the response of macrophages to this obligate human pathogen. Here, we
describe an approach using macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSdMs) to study macrophage–Chlamydia interactions in vitro. We show that iPSdMs support
the full infectious life cycle of C. trachomatis in a manner that mimics the infection of human
blood-derived macrophages. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the macrophage
response to chlamydial infection highlighted the role of the type I interferon and interleukin
10-mediated responses. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated biallelic knockout
mutations in host genes encoding IRF5 and IL-10RA in iPSCs, and confirmed their roles in
limiting chlamydial infection in macrophages. This model can potentially be extended to other
pathogens and tissue systems to advance our understanding of host-pathogen interactions
and the role of human genetics in influencing the outcome of infections.

 C
hlamydia trachomatis is a leading cause of bacterial
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide, with
more than a hundred million new cases of STDs caused
by
this
pathogen
annually.
These
Gram-negative
obligate
intracellular bacteria cause genital infections leading to pelvic
inflammatory disease and infertility1. Chlamydia are also a
leading cause of preventable blindness due to trachoma, as well as
being the aetiological agents responsible for non-gonococcal
urethritis, and Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis. During
arthritis, C. trachomatis likely reaches the joint from the
urogenital system through circulating monocytes and macro-
phages. Indeed, although C. trachomatis preferentially infects
epithelial cells, within the synovial tissues of reactive arthritis
patients, viable, metabolically active Chlamydia predominately
reside and persist within macrophages2–5. Although macrophages
are not always a permissive environment for Chlamydia, their
capacity to infect macrophages varies between strains, the source
and subtype of macrophages and the
multiplicity of infection
(MOI) used for infection6. For example, Chlamydia does not
grow in inflammatory M1 macrophages but grows well in M2 and
M0 (resting) macrophages7,8.
Consequently, macrophages play critical roles in defence
against chlamydial infections. For example, upon recruitment to
sites of infection, the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and
kill Chlamydia is crucial to limiting the progression of the
infection.
Moreover,
the
infiltration
of
macrophages
into
infected
tissues
can
lead
to
inflammation,
a
phenotype
commonly associated with Chlamydia infections1. Conversely,
chlamydial persistence in macrophages can also contribute to
chronic inflammation and delays in the efficacy of antibiotic
treatment. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms
that
control
chlamydial
survival
in
human
macrophages
could
have
major
implications
for
the
development
of
therapeutic strategies.
Despite the importance of human genetics in the complex
interactions
between
Chlamydia
and
human
macrophages,
the availability of cell-based human systems to study this
interplay is limited. Most in vitro models currently used to study
Chlamydia–macrophage
interactions
involve
macrophages
derived from other mammals, immortalized macrophage-lineage
cell lines or primary monocytes/macrophages, predominantly
from mice9,10. Aside from clear differences in the bacterial
response of macrophages from humans and mice, immortalized
cell lines are also far removed from the normal genetic state,
including
harbouring
extensive
genome
rearrangements11.
Moreover, primary monocytes and macrophages are inherently
difficult to genetically manipulate, thus limiting the ability to
study
how
macrophage
genetics
impact
on
Chlamydia
pathogenesis.
Induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) derived macrophages
(iPSdMs) can potentially overcome some of the drawbacks of
classical cell lines and can be used as an alternative source of
primary human macrophages, providing a more personalised and
tractable
genetic
approach.
Human
iPSCs
can
be
readily
genetically manipulated, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, or
isolated from individuals with common or rare disease-associated
genotypes.
Here we differentiated human iPSCs into macrophages and
showed, through a combination of flow cytometric analyses,
microscopy, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling that human
iPSdMs respond to C. trachomatis in a similar manner to
macrophages derived from human blood monocytes. Using
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach12, we generated human
iPSC mutations in candidate genes identified from the functional
genomic studies, to validate and identify novel mechanisms
involved in limiting Chlamydia growth in macrophages.
Results
Formation of chlamydial inclusions inside infected iPSdMs.
We investigated whether human iPSdMs could support the
productive growth of Chlamydia infection. To differentiate
human iPSCs into macrophages, we adapted and modified the
approach from Hale et al.13 (Methods, Fig. 1a). Human iPSdMs
derived from both the KOLF2 and FPS10C iPSC lines were
generally
morphologically
indistinguishable
from
primary
human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and expressed
high levels of macrophage markers, including CD11b, CD14,
EMR1 and CD68, while the stem cell pluripotency markers,
including SSEA-4 and OCT-3/4, were correspondingly low
(Fig. 1a–c). Transcriptomic analysis of naı
¨ve human KOLF2
iPSdMs compared to primary human blood monocyte-derived
macrophages revealed 495% of genes were similarly expressed in
both cell types, in accordance with previous studies14.
To facilitate visualization of the infection of human iPSdMs
with Chlamydia, we used a C. trachomatis serovar F SWFP �
derivative, harbouring plasmid pGFP::SW2 that directs the
constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)15. At
1 h post infection of human iPSdMs and blood monocyte-derived
macrophages
with
C.
trachomatis/pGFP::SW2),
the
GFP
fluorescence generated by the bacteria was too weak to detect
by the Cellomics CellInsight NTX but transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) revealed small inclusions containing single or
a few Chlamydia elementary bodies (EBs) inside the infected
macrophages (Fig. 2a). After 24 h of Chlamydia infection,
Cellomics identified generally 5–7% of both human iPSdMs and
blood monocyte-derived macrophages were infected. These
infected macrophages revealed, via TEM, single or multiple
large inclusions (Fig. 2b). Formation of the inclusions distorted
the morphology of the macrophages, which had increased
substantially
in
size
compared
to
equivalent
uninfected
macrophages. By 48 h post infection, the infected macrophages
had rounded up with some macrophages lysed, releasing EBs into
the extracellular medium (Fig. 2c). Using Cellomics technology,
we observed the average GFP intensity from C. trachomatis
infected human iPSdMs and human blood monocyte-derived
macrophages increased to a maximum at 48 h. After this
time point, the GFP intensity gradually decreased (Fig. 2d).
C. trachomatis progeny released at 48 h were infective, as the
released EBs were able to re-infect uninfected macrophages and
McCoy epithelial cells (Fig. 3a–c).
Human iPSdM responses to C. trachomatis infection. We next
determined how human iPSdMs responded to C. trachomatis
challenge using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics.
Prior to infection, investigation of the expression of key macro-
phage differentiation markers indicated that (unstimulated)
iPSDMs expressed low to very low levels (0.1–5 counts per
million (c.p.m.)) of M1 markers (CXCL10, CXCL11 and TAP1)
and also modest levels (10–1,000 c.p.m.) of M2 markers (CCL13,
CD209, F13A1, MRC1 and TGM2). This was consistent with
previous studies on iPSDM with another cell lineage which
concluded that iPSDMs are fully mature but can be differentiated
into M2 or M1 polarized cells13. Thus these cells were considered
M0 macrophages that, like M2 macrophages but not M1
macrophages, are permissive for Chlamydia growth7,8.
At 24 h post infection, the genes dysregulated by Chlamydia in
infected cf. uninfected iPSdM cells were compared to those
observed in blood-derived macrophages. A total of 2,029 genes
repeatedly changed expression after Chlamydia infection in both
iPSdMs and blood-derived macrophages, with 1,194 genes
upregulated and 835 gene downregulated (fold change of Z1.5,
Pr0.05; see Supplementary Data 1 for list of selected DE genes

 with the full data set provided as described in the ‘Data
availability’ section in Methods). The promoters of these
dysregulated genes frequently included, according to oPossum
(http://opossum.cisreg.ca/oPOSSUM3/; z score 44), binding sites
for the immune system transcription factors NFKB subunits p65,
p50 and C-Rel, AP1, IRF1, IRF2, STAT1 and STAT3.
Pathway analysis of dysregulated genes in iPdSMs and blood
macrophages following Chlamydia infection was undertaken
using Sigora16 that limits the repetitive assignment of the same
genes to multiple overlapping pathways. As shown in Table 1
(more complete version in Supplementary Data 2–4, including
separate Reactome pathway analysis of up and downregulated
genes), there was a strong over representation in infected cells
of major immune-related pathways reflecting a strong interferon
a, b and g response. Dysregulation of pathway gene expression
was also evident for various Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-6, RIG-I
and TRIF (MyD88-independent) pathways, the endosomal/
vaculolar pathway, inhibition of translation, energy metabolism

 and
metabolism
of
amino
acids
(especially
tryptophan;
Supplementary Data 2–4) and nucleotides. Consistent in part
with this, at 24 h post Chlamydia infection, human iPSdMs were
shown, using Luminex bead-based multiplex assays, to express
high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFa, as
well as IL-1b, chemokine IL-8 and the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 (Fig. 4).
RNA-Seq revealed that genes associated with Type I interferon
signalling were the most significantly upregulated including key
transcription factors such as the interferon regulatory factors
IRF-1 and 7 (upregulated by 2- and 5-fold), signal transducer and
activator of transcription genes (STAT)-1 and -2 (4- and 2-fold),
and interferon stimulated genes such as ISG15 (6-fold). In
addition IRF5 was significantly upregulated and qRT-PCR
confirmed
that
the
extent
of
upregulation
was
3.4±0.2.
Consistent with these observations being functionallly important,
the use of an anti-IFNAR1 antibody to block IFN a/b receptor
resulted in an 85.5±6.8% increase in C. trachomatis infection as
compared to untreated cells (Fig. 5a).
Interestingly, we observed very substantial upregulation of
IDO1 by 4800-fold in infected human iPSdMs. IDO1 has been
recently shown to play an important role in defense against
Chlamydia pneumoniae17 and consistent with this, treatment of
human iPSdMs with INCB024360 (ref. 18) (a competitive
inhibitor of IDO1) resulted in an 83.6±20.9% increase in
C. trachomatis infection as compared to untreated cells (Fig. 5b).
A variety of cell surface receptors were also upregulated
including ICAM-1 (7-fold) and CD44 (7-fold)19,20, integrin
family members including a2, a6, aM, b2, b3, b7 and b8
(2- to 14-fold)21 and syndecan SDC2 (4-fold)22, also indicating
that Chlamydia changes the intrinsic interactions of macrophages
with other host elements.
Of the 835 genes downregulated in human iPSdMs at 24 h post
Chlamydia infection, the top hits (Supplementary Data 4)
were associated with gap junction trafficking and regulation
(as observed previously23), as well as nonsense mediated decay
and various translation processes, which might be involved in
either the host cells attempting to control Chlamydia intracellular
growth (as occurs with other pathogens24), or Chlamydia
diverting cellular resources to its own growth. Pathway analysis
also revealed the downregulation of other cellular processes
during macrophage infection related to tubulin, and gap junction
trafficking pathways.
We also observed a substantial number of uniquely expressed
genes in both iPSDM and MDM, consistent with previous
observations by others14 and likely related in part to the different

 derivation and culture methods (Supplementary Data 5–8). Many
of these genes had modest read counts and/or did not fit into
pathways, but Sigora enrichment analysis identified a number of
iPSDM-unique
pathways
including
extracellular
matrix
organization, collagen degradation, cell surface interactions at
the vascular wall (Supplementary Data 5 and 6). Amongst MDM
specific pathways (Supplementary Data 7 and 8), we observed
certain cellular metabolic processes, including mitochondrial
protein import, pyruvate metabolism, gluconeogenesis, as well as
antigen processing and cell cycle regulation (G2/M transition and
DNA repair).
To
study
the
post-transcriptional
host
response
during
C. trachomatis infection of human iPSdMs at 24 h, we performed
a detailed whole cell proteome study. At 24 h post infection,
comparing infected to uninfected cells, proteomics revealed
significant changes in 307 proteins with 229 upregulated and
78 downregulated (fold change (FC) of 42.0 or o � 2.0 and
P valueo0.05) (Supplementary Data 9 for a full list of DE
proteins). The lower number of proteins found to be dysregulated
may relate to the lower sensitivity of the proteomic methodol-
ogies. Up and downregulated proteins were separately submitted
to the innate immunity interactome database and analysis
platform
InnateDB, and over-representation
(OR) analyses
carried out. Of the 229 upregulated proteins, 79 pathways were
found to be significantly over represented (Bonferroni corrected
P valueo0.05) (Table 2 for selected OR upregulated pathways).
The top upregulated pathways showed similarity to those
identified by transcriptomics (indicated by an asterisk in
Table 2), including interferon signalling and the inflammatory
response, but several pathways were unique implying possible
post-transcriptional regulation. Upregulated pathways identified
through proteomics but not transcriptomics included lipoprotein/
cholesterol metabolism (APOA1, APOE), and the complement
and coagulation cascades (C4BPA, C7).
Roles of IRF5 and IL10RA in Chlamydia–macrophage interaction.
To identify key host genes involved in macrophage–Chlamydia
interactions, we used CRISPR/Cas technology to generate biallelic
knockouts in human iPSCs (Methods, Fig. 6). To validate this
methodology and uncover new insights, we explored the role
of two candidate genes, not previously studied in human
Chlamydia pathogenesis, based on our RNA-Seq/proteomics
analyses, namely Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and

(IL10RA).
Human
iPSCs
lines
harbouring homozygous mutations in each gene (two indepen-
dently derived clones per gene to minimize the potential for
off-target effects) were generated and subsequently differentiated
into
macrophages
to
investigate
whether
the
candidate
genes played roles in C. trachomatis infection. The bi-allelic
mutation was validated for each mutant by PCR and sequencing
(Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). Both mutant human iPS lines
were able to differentiate into similar numbers of macrophages
as the parental iPS line and expressed macrophage markers
(CD11b, CD14, CD16, CD68 as measured by flow cytometry;
Supplementary Fig. 1C). Moreover, all of the mutant iPSdMs
showed an ability to phagocytose (Supplementary Fig. 1D).
Due to the apparent importance of the Type I interferon
response, we targeted the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family
transcription factor IRF5 that was 3.4-fold upregulated by
Chlamydia infection. IRFs are a family of transcription factors
involved in Type I interferon responses following infection
with viruses or intracellular bacteria including Mycobacterium
tuberculosis25. In particular IRF5 has known roles in virus-
mediated activation of interferons, as well as modulation of cell
growth, regulation of macrophage polarization, apoptosis, and
immune system activity26. Infection of IRF5 � / � human iPSdMs
with C. trachomatis led to a 45.4±11.1% increase in bacterial
load as compared to the parental KOLF2 iPSdMs (Fig. 7a).
Cytokine expression by IRF5 � / � human iPSdMs infected with
C. trachomatis revealed decreased production of the type I
interferon
IFN-b
(0.35±0.05
fold),
and
pro-inflammatory
cytokines, IL-1b (0.16±0.03 fold), IL-6 (0.24±0.02 fold) and
TNF-a
(0.14±0.01
fold),
while
production
of
the
anti-
inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was increased (1.28±0.03 fold)
compared to the parent KOLF2 iPSdMs (Fig. 7b). This indicated a
significant role for IRF5 in macrophages in mediating type I
interferon
and
pro-inflammatory
responses
to
Chlamydia,
potentially as a mechanism to limit intracellular growth of
the bacteria.
To further analyse the impact of knocking out IRF5, we
performed RNA-Seq on uninfected and infected macrophages
derived from this mutant compared to the parent KOLF2 cells.
A total of 1,046 genes were dysregulated when comparing mutant
and wild-type uninfected cells, representing 246 upregulated
genes and 800 downregulated genes, while comparing mutant and
wild-type infected cells the numbers were 995 dysregulated genes
comprising 210 upregulated genes and 785 downregulated genes
(Supplementary Data 10). Comparing the effect of infection on
IRF5 � / � iPSdM with that on parent KOLF2 cells, this reflected
21 different pathways (largely downregulated genes), including
interferon a/b and g signalling (adjusted P values 8.8E � 162 and
1.7E � 12),
negative
regulators

Figure 6 | Schematic diagram for the generation of biallelic knockout
mutants. Strategy for the generation of biallelic knockouts is to replace a
critical exon of one allele of the target gene with a drug selection cassette
by homologous recombination and to screen clones for damage to the
second allele induced by error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).
Since only one copy of the target exon will be present in correctly targeted
clones, NHEJ-induced damage to the non-targeted allele can be simply
assessed by Sanger sequencing of PCR products from the target exon.

RNA-Seq analysis on the dysregulated genes in macrophages
after Chlamydia infection (Supplementary Data 1), indicated
a threefold upregulation of interleukin-10 receptor subunit
alpha (IL-10RA) during C. trachomatis infection of iPSdMs.
IL-10RA is structurally related to the interferon receptors
and mediates the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. IL-10,
upregulated 150-fold by Chlamydia infection (Fig. 4), is a key
immune regulator during infection with various pathogens,
including bacteria, viruses and protozoa; evidence here also
indicated a prospective regulatory role in Chlamydia infection of
iPSDMs (Figs 4 and 7c). Human iPSdMs derived from an
IL-10RA � / � mutant iPS did not respond to IL-10 stimulation
(Fig. 7c), consistent with the important role of IL-10RA in
mediating
IL-10
signalling.
Interestingly,
the
IL-10RA � / �
mutant iPSDMs were more susceptible to Chlamydia infection
in vitro with a 64.9±12.5% increase in bacterial load compared to
parent KOLF2 iPSdMs (Fig. 7c).
Discussion
Due to the inherent difficulty in genetically manipulating
primary monocytes/macrophages, the existing model systems
for
studying
macrophage
genetics
are
largely
limited
to
immortalized cell lines. However, immortalized cells are far
removed from the normal genetic state, whereas iPSdMs can be
generated from diverse human genetic sources (HipSci project)27.
We
overcame
this
challenge
by
using
human
iPSCs
in
combination
with
CRISPR/Cas9
gene
editing
technology.
Here, we reported that macrophages derived from human
iPSCs support the entire life cycle of C. trachomatis. We
show, through a combination of flow cytometry analyses,
microscopy and transcriptomic/proteomic profiling, that human
iPSC-derived macrophages (iPSdMs) respond to C. trachomatis
in a similar manner to macrophages derived from human
blood monocytes, when both are differentiated in such a way as to
yield permissive7,8 M0/M2-like macrophages. Importantly, the
diverse omic-analyses led us to the identification of a number of
host factors potentially involved in macrophage–Chlamydia
interaction.
Macrophages
can
mediate
protection
against
Chlamydia
infections by phagocytosis, leading to the destruction of the
bacteria. However, some pathogenic Chlamydia can infect and
avoid lysosomal fusion to survive in macrophages6. Here we
showed in vitro infection of human iPSdM with C. trachomatis.
Those bacteria that managed to evade lysosomal fusion continued
to replicate and developed mature inclusions inside the human
iPSdM (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the chlamydial progeny released
from infected iPSdM were highly infectious (Fig. 3). Our results
thus support the capability of Chlamydia to exploit circulating
monocytes/macrophages
as
vehicles
for
dissemination
of
infection from the primary infection site to distant sites in the
body28. Nevertheless our functional genomics studies revealed
insights into factors and pathways that may be involved in
Chlamydia growth in macrophages.
We and others have shown that Chlamydia infection induces a
Type I interferon (IFN) response in macrophages29,30. Activation
of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF)s play crucial roles in
transcriptional activity of Type I IFN genes and numerous
IFN-stimulated genes31. The IRF family of transcription factors
comprises nine members (IRF1-9). Three of the transcription
factors, namely IRF1, 3 and 7 have been characterized as crucial
contributors in the regulation of type I IFNs during Chlamydia
infection32,33. Here we explored the contribution of another key
member of the IRF family, IRF5, a critical immune regulator.
Intriguingly, it has been shown that during viral infection, IRF5
induces overlapping and distinct sets of genes compared to IRF7
(ref. 34). IRF5 not only induces the transcription of IFNa and
IFNb, but also plays a key role in polarizing macrophages towards
a pro-inflammatory phenotype and has been associated with
susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases35,36.
However, the role of this transcription factor in Chlamydia
infection has not been investigated to date.
After generation of a human iPS knockout mutant in the IRF5
gene, it was demonstrated that the IRF5 � / � mutant human
iPSdMs
showed
increased
susceptibility
to
C.
trachomatis
infection compared to the parent KOLF2 human iPSdMs.
RNA-Seq analysis of the IRF5 � / � mutant versus KOLF2 human
iPSdMs revealed the dysregulation of a variety of other factors
involved in interferon signalling, including STAT1, IRF7 and
IFITs. This provides additional evidence that elements of the
Type I interferon pathway are essential for anti-chlamydial
defence. Overall we can conclude that IRF5 likely controls critical

 mechanisms that limit the excessive growth of Chlamydia in
macrophages, enabling macrophages more time to exert their
role in defence against Chlamydia. In this regard, in infected
IRF5 � / � macrophages, we observed substantial downregulation
of cytoskeleton components ((FN), the most evident hub, and
tubulin (TUBA1)), required for macrophage function, and
extracellular matrix, especially collagen, required for extrinsic
interactions with other cells and tissues.

IL-10 with Chlamydia disease pathogenesis have been reported37.
The role of IL-10/IL-10R signalling in Chlamydia infection is
likely to be complex. While studies have shown that IL-10
supressed expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules that
might be involved in immune responses against Chlamydia
infections38, we and others39 have shown that Chlamydia also
induces the expression of IL-10 and IL-10R. In this study we
report that blocking IL-10 signalling by a homozygous knockout
of IL-10RA in human iPSdMs led to increased susceptibility to
C. trachomatis infection. This supports a role for IL-10 in limiting

 Chlamydia infections of macrophages. Chlamydiae have evolved
a number of strategies to promote their survival inside host cells,
one of which is modulation of programmed cell death pathways
in infected host cells40. A previous study showed that Chlamydia
inhibits apoptosis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
through induction of IL-10 (ref. 41). Therefore, we speculate that
the absence of IL-10/IL-10R signalling might inhibit apoptosis in
macrophages to promote growth of Chlamydia in these cells. We
are currently investigating this mechanism experimentally.
In conclusion, we have provided evidence that we can use the
human iPSdM Chlamydia infection model to study the complex
interplay beween the host and the pathogen.
Methods
Ethical approval. All experiments were approved by and carried out in accordance
with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and UBC Research Ethics Board
approved guidelines.
Human iPSC culture and differentiation to macrophages. The human iPS lines
used in this study, KOLF2 and FPS10C, were generated by the Sanger Institute’s
Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci) project. Briefly, the
HipSci Initiative used the CytoTune 1 Sendai method to reprogram dermal
fibroblast obtained from healthy adult volunteers into iPSCs. The Certificate of
Analysis for the human iPSCs and more detailed methods on the generation of
iPSCs are available on the project website (www.hipsci.org). Undifferentiated
human iPSCs were grown under feeder-free TeSR-E8 conditions (StemCell
Technologies) on tissue culture plates coated with Synthemax II-SC substrate
(Corning) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Interestingly it has been shown that
in vitro human embryonic stem cell hematopoiesis mimics MYB-independent yolk
sac hematopoiesis42. We compared iPSdMs with human blood-derived
macrophages since the latter are derived in an analogous manner from progenitor
cells and represent the most common model for studying ex vivo macrophage
biology. To differentiate human iPSCs to macrophages, we adapted and modified
the approach of Hale et al.13 (Fig. 1a). Briefly, upon reaching confluency, the
human iPSCs were collected and transferred into iPS base medium (DMEM/F12
supplemented with 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement, 2 mM L-Glutamine,
0.055 mM b-mercaptoethanol) with 10 ng ml � 1 BMP-4 (R&D) for 4 days to
generate Embryoid Bodies (EBs). On Day 5, EBs were used for generation of
myeloid precursor cells in the presence of 25 ng/ml IL-3 (R&D) and 50 ng ml � 1
M-CSF (R&D) followed by terminal differentiation and maturation of myeloid
precursors into matured macrophages (iPSdMs) in the presence of higher
concentrations of M-CSF (100 ng ml � 1). For experiments, macrophages were
detached using Lidocaine solution (4 mg ml � 1 lidocaine-HCl with 10 mM EDTA
in PBS), and seeded at 2 � 105 cells per well (24-well plate) or 1 � 106 cells per well
(six-well plate).
C. trachomatis propagation and infection of macrophages. C. trachomatis
strains Sweden F plasmid minus (SWFP � ) and SWFP � transformed with
plasmid pGFP::SW2 used in this study were kindly provided by Ian Clarke15,
propagated in McCoy fibroblasts (ATCC) and purified using a Gastrografin step
gradient, as described previously43. Purified EBs were stored in sucrose/phosphate/
glutamate buffer in aliquots at � 80 �C until use.
Macrophages were seeded into 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 media (Sigma)-
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma) and 2 mM L-Glutamine
(Sigma) and allowed to settle overnight. On the day of infection, cells were washed
and replaced with fresh RPMI-supplemented media. C. trachomatis were added to
the macrophages at MOI of 1 and the plates were centrifuged at 1,800 r.p.m. for
30 min at 37 �C. Cells were washed, replaced with fresh media and incubated at
37 �C and 5% CO2 for the indicated time point. At the time point, supernatants
were harvested, filtered and stored in � 80 �C for cytokine/chemokine analysis.
Cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained with
Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The average intensity of GFP
expressed by internalized C. trachomatis was measured using the Target Activation
BioApplication in a CellInsight NXT High Content Screening (HCS) Platform
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). All HCS experiments were performed
at resolution of � 10 magnification. Alternatively for electron microscopy, cells
were fixed with a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA on ice for 1 h and
processed as described44. As indicated, macrophages were also treated with a
competitive inhibitor of IDO1 (INCB024360, Selleckchem) at 500 nmol for 24 h
prior to C. trachomatis infection.
Cytokine/chemokine multiplex bead assays. Supernatants from C. trachomatis
infected macrophages were analysed for production of human tumour necrosis
factor a (TNF-a), interleukin 1b (IL-1b), 6 (IL-6), 8 (IL-8), 10 (IL-10) and
interferon b (IFN-b). TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were measured
using a Millipore customised Milliplex anti-human cytokine kit and data acquired
on a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D system (Millipore). Data analysis was carried out
using the xPONENT Multiplex Assay Analysis software (Millipore). Production of
IFN-b was measured using the human IFN-b ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Flow cytometry. Macrophages were lifted off from the surface of culture wells,
fixed with 1% PFA and stained with specific conjugated antibodies, including
CD11b (FITC mouse anti-human CD11b, BD Pharmingen catalog no. 562793, 5 ml
per 106 cells), CD14 (APC mouse anti-human CD14, BD Pharmingen catalog no.
561383, 5 ml per 106 cells), CD16 (Pacific Blue mouse anti-human CD16, BD
Pharmingen catalog no. 558122, 0.2 mg ml � 1), CD68 (Alexa Flour 647 mouse anti-
human CD68, BD Pharmingen catalog no. 562111, 5 ml per 106 cells), SSEA-4
(Alexa Fluor 488 mouse anti-SSEA-4, BD Pharmingen catalog no. 560308, 5 ml per
106 cells) and OCT-3/4 (PE mouse anti-Oct3/4, BD Pharmingen catalog no.
561556, 5 ml per 106 cells). For intracellular markers, cells were permeabilized with
saponin buffer. Isotype matched antibodies conjugated to the same fluorophores
were used as negative controls. Samples were analysed using the BD LSRFortessa
(BD Biosciences). Data were analysed using FlowJo v10.1.
RNA and protein isolation for RNA-Seq and Proteomics. Gene expression
was measured by RNA-Seq at 1 and 24 h post infection and protein expression
was measured by Proteomic Mass Spectrometry at 24 h post infection. Briefly,
total RNA and proteins from three independent samples of uninfected and
C. trachomatis infected human iPSdMs at the indicated time points were isolated
using the AllPrep Mini Kit (Qiagen).
For RNA-Seq, the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit was used
and poly-A tailed RNA (mRNA) was purified via oligo dT magnetic bead pull
down. The mRNA was then fragmented using metal ion-catalysed hydrolysis.
A random-primed cDNA library was synthesized and the resulting double-
stranded cDNA was used as the input for library preparation. Overhangs were
repaired with a combination of fill-in reactions and exonuclease activity to produce
blunt ends. Adenylation of blunt ends was followed by ligation to Illumina Pair-end
Sequencing adapters containing unique index sequences. cDNA enrichment was
carried out by 10 cycles of PCR amplification. Samples were quantified and pooled
based on post-PCR analyses with an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Pools were size-selected
using the LabChip XT Caliper. The multiplexed library was then sequenced on the
Illumina HiSeq 2000, 75 bp paired-end read length.
Sequenced data was then analysed and quality controlled (QC and individual
indexed library BAM files were produced). Tophat2 version 2.1.1 was used to align
the reads to the reference human genome GRCh37 and indexed with Samtools
version 0.1.19. Read counts were computed from the read alignments to the coding
sequence using HTSeq version 0.6.0. Differentially expressed genes were calculated
by the DESeq2 version 1.12. 3 and R version 3.3.1. Pathway analysis was performed
using SIGORA version 2.0.1, which identified pathway enrichment based on
statistically over-represented Pathway Gene-Pair Signatures16. Network analysis of
expression changes were performed using NetworkAnalyst45 which is based on
curated protein:protein interactions from InnateDB (www.innatedb.ca).
For proteomics, protein pellets were dissolved in 0.1 M triethylammonium
bicarbonate, 0.1% SDS. Total proteins were reduced with tris-2-carboxymethyl
phosphine and cysteine residues were blocked with iodacetamide. Samples were
digested with Trypsin (Pierce, MS grade) and the resultant peptides were labelled
with TMT6plex (Thermo Scientific), and pooled. Offline peptide fractionation
based on high pH Reverse Phase (RP) chromatography was performed using the
Waters, XBridge C18 column on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped
with autosampler. Signal was recorded at 280 nm and fractions were collected in a
time dependent manner. LC-MS analysis was performed on the Dionex Ultimate
3000 UHPLC system coupled with the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific). Each peptide fraction was reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid
and loaded to the Acclaim PepMap 100 and subjected to a multi-step gradient
elution on the Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 capillary column (Dionex) retrofitted to
an electrospray emitter (New Objective, FS360-20-10-D-20). Precursors between
400 and 1,500 m/z were selected with mass resolution of 120 K, AGC 3 � 105 and
IT 100 ms were isolated for CID fragmentation with quadrupole isolation width
0.7 Th. MS3 quantification spectra were acquired with further HCD fragmentation
of the top 10 most abundant CID fragments isolated with Synchronous Precursor
Selection (SPS) excluding neutral losses of maximum m/z 30. The HCD MS3
spectra were acquired with resolution of 15 K. Targeted precursors were
dynamically excluded for further isolation and activation for 45 s with 7 p.p.m.
mass tolerance.
The acquired mass spectra were submitted to SequestHT search engine
implemented on the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software for protein identification
and quantification. The precursor mass tolerance was set at 20 p.p.m. and the
fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 0.5 Da. Spectra were searched for fully
tryptic peptides with a maximum of two mis-cleavages and a minimum length of
six amino acids. TMT6plex at N-termimus, K and Carbamidomethyl at C were
defined as static modifications. Dynamic modifications included oxidation of M
and deamidation of N, Q. A maximum of two different dynamic modifications
were allowed for each peptide with maximum two repetitions each. Peptide
confidence was estimated with the Percolator node. Peptide FDR was set at
0.01 and validation was based on q-value and decoy database search. All spectra
were searched against a UniProt fasta file containing 20 K human reviewed entries.

Generation of biallelic knockouts in human iPSCs. Due to limitations in our
ethics certification that did not allow for genetic manipulations in the FPS10C iPSC
line, only the KOLF2 human iPSCs was utilized for mutant generation. KOLF2
cells were adapted to feeder-free culture and several sublines were isolated by single
cell cloning. The subline KOLF2-C1 was used for this study and these cells showed
a stable, normal karyotype (46;XY) for up to 25 passages. Biallelic knockouts in
KOLF2 human iPSCs were generated using a method that was found to minimize
the potential for off-target effects12. Briefly, the intermediate targeting vector for
each gene was generated by GIBSON assembly of the four fragments: puc19 vector,
50 homology arm, R1-pheS/zeo-R2 cassette and 30 homology arm. The homology
arms were amplified by PCR from KOLF2 human iPSC genomic DNA
(PCR primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1). pUC19 vector and
R1-pheS/zeo-R2 cassette were prepared as gel purified blunt fragments (EcoRV
digested) while the PCR fragments were either gel purified or column purified
(QIAquick, QIAGEN). The resultant GIBSON assembly reactions (Gibson
Assembly Master Mix, NEB) were transformed into NEB 5-alpha competent cells
and clones resistant to carbenicillin (50 mg ml � 1) and zeocin (10 mg ml � 1) were
analysed by Sanger sequencing to verify all junctions (sequencing primers are listed
in Supplementary Table 1). Subsequently, the intermediate targeting vectors were
turned into donor plasmids via a Gateway exchange reaction. LR Clonase II Plus
enzyme mix (Invitrogen) was used as described by Skarnes et al.46 with the
difference that it was a two-way reaction exchanging only the R1-pheSzeo-R2
cassette with the pL1-EF1aPuro-L2 cassette. The latter had been generated by
cloning synthetic DNA fragments of the EF1a promoter and puromycin into one
of the pL1/L2 vectors as described by Skarnes et al.46. Following Gateway reaction
and selection on YEG þ carbenicillin (50 mg ml-1) agar plates, correct donor
plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all junctions. Plasmids carrying
single guide (sg) RNA sequences were generated by cloning forward and reverse
strand oligos into the BsaI site of either U6_BsaI_gRNA or p1260_T7_BsaI_gRNA
vectors (kindly provided by Sebastian Gerety, unpublished) (CRISPR sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table 1). Kanamycin resistant clones (50 mg ml � 1) were
isolated and cloning of the correct sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing.
Human iPSCs were dissociated to single cells and nucleofected (Amaxa2b
nucleofector, LONZA) with Cas9 coding plasmid (hCas9, Addgene 41815), sgRNA
plasmid and donor plasmid. Following nucleofection, cells were selected for up to
11 days with 0.25 mg ml � 1 puromycin. Individual colonies were picked into 96-well
plates, grown to confluence and then replica plated. Once confluent, the replica
plates were either frozen as single cells in 96-well vials or the wells were lysed for
genotyping.
To genotype individual clones from a 96-well replica plates, cells were lysed and
used for PCR amplification with LongAmp Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB). Insertion
of the cassette into the correct locus was confirmed by visualising on 1% E-gel
(Life Tech) PCR products generated by gene specific (GF1 and GR1) and cassette
specific (ER and PF) primers for both 50 and 30 ends (Supplementary Table 1). We
also confirmed single integration of the cassette by performing a qPCR copy
number assay. To check the CRISPR site on the non-targeted allele PCR products
were generated either from across the locus, using the 50 and the 30 gene specific
genotyping primers (GF1-GR1), or from around the site using primers 5F-3R
(Supplementary Table 1) that would amplify a short, around 500 bp, amplicon. In
both cases the PCR products were treated with exonuclease and alkaline
phosphatase (NEB) and Sanger sequenced using primers SF and SR
(Supplementary Table 1). Sequence reads and their traces were analysed and
visualized using a laboratory information management system (LIMS)-2. To
minimize the potential for off-target effects, two independently derived clones with
different specific mutations were isolated for each of the targeted genes and studied
further here.
Statistical analyses. Statistical significance was performed with GraphPad Prism
software. Student’s t-test was used for two-group comparisons, and ANOVA was
used for comparisons involving three or more groups.
Data availability. The RNA-seq data have been deposited in the European
Nucleotide Archive with accession code ERP006216. The mass spectrometry
proteomics data have been submitted to the ProteomXchange Consortium via the
PRIDE partner respository with the data set identifier PXD005858. The authors
