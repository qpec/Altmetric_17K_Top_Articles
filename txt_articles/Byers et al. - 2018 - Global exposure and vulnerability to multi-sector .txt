Abstract
Understanding the interplay between multiple climate change risks and socioeconomic development
is increasingly required to inform effective actions to manage these risks and pursue sustainable
development. We calculate a set of 14 impact indicators at different levels of global mean temperature
(GMT) change and socioeconomic development covering water, energy and land sectors from an
ensemble of global climate, integrated assessment and impact models. The analysis includes changes
in drought intensity and water stress index, cooling demand change and heat event exposure, habitat
degradation and crop yield, amongst others. To investigate exposure to multi-sector climate impacts,
these are combined with gridded socioeconomic projections of population and those ‘vulnerable to
poverty’ from three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) (income <$10/day, currently 4.2 billion
people). We show that global exposure to multi-sector risks approximately doubles between 1.5 ◦C
and 2 ◦C GMT change, doubles again with 3 ◦C GMT change and is ∼6x between the best and worst
cases (SSP1/1.5 ◦C vs SSP3/3 ◦C, 0.8–4.7bi). For populations vulnerable to poverty, the exposure is an
order of magnitude greater (8–32x) in the high poverty and inequality scenarios (SSP3) compared to
sustainable socioeconomic development (SSP1). Whilst 85%–95% of global exposure falls to Asian
and African regions, they have 91%–98% of the exposed and vulnerable population (depending on
SSP/GMT combination), approximately half of which in South Asia. In higher warming scenarios,
African regions have growing proportion of the global exposed and vulnerable population, ranging
from 7%–17% at 1.5 ◦C, doubling to 14%–30% at 2 ◦C and again to 27%–51% at 3 ◦C. Finally,
beyond 2 ◦C and at higher risk thresholds, the world’s poorest are disproportionately impacted,
particularly in cases (SSP3) of high inequality in Africa and southern Asia. Sustainable development
that reduces poverty, mitigates emissions and meets targets in the water, energy and land sectors has
the potential for order-of-magnitude scale reductions in multi-sector climate risk for the most
vulnerable.

1. Introduction
The 21st century will see the global population increase
from 7.5 billion in 2017 to an expected 8.5–10
billion in 2050 [1], with much of this growth in low-
and middle-income regions. Future populations will
be exposed to a range of climate change-related haz-
ards of varying intensities and locations, with some
‘hotspots’ exposed to more risks than others, com-
pounding the challenges [2–4]. Risks are not just
dependent on the severity of climate change and subse-
quent hazards but critically depend on the population’s
spatial distribution (exposure) and their vulnerabil-
ity and capacity to prepare for and manage changing
risks [5]. Increasingly studies are showing that the
world’s poorest are disproportionately exposed to
changes in temperature extremes [6, 7] and challenging
hydro-climatic complexity [8–10]. In the water sec-
tor, between 8%–14% of the global population are
expected to face severe reductions in available water
resources between 1.7 ◦C–2.7 ◦C [11] and in the energy
sector, more than 70% of a ‘business as usual’ 2050s
population could expect climate sensitive changes in
energy demand of +/− 5%, with negative impacts over-
whelmingly in low and middle income countries [12].
Following ratification of the 2015 Paris Agreement,
more work is required to understand the potential
range of benefits of a 1.5 ◦C climate, what higher
degrees of warming are projected to entail for differ-
ent sectors [13] and to what extent people of different
vulnerabilities will be impacted.
Along with other factors such as institutional gov-
ernance, education, social structures and safety nets
[14], vulnerability is strongly associated with wealth,
although the wealthy in volatile climates are not
immune [2]. Accounting for those that are ‘vulnerable
to poverty’ were they to suffer a shock, like loss of
employment or a climate hazard, is critical because
much larger fractions of society exist in this pre-
carious and transient state. In 2011, there were an
estimated 767 million people living in extreme poverty
with incomes of less than $1.9 USD/day, with a total of
4.2 billion (bi) classified as vulnerable to poverty liv-
ing on $1.9–10 USD/day [15]. Escaping (or not falling
back into) poverty, can be particularly difficult as the
frequency of natural and climate hazards prevents asset
accumulation [16] and impacts negatively on health,
prices, productivity and opportunities [17]. The most
optimistic scenarios, for example, project up to an 85%
reduction in this vulnerable population to 616 million
by 2050, with very good and sustained progress on
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).However
in a high inequality scenario, the vulnerable population
could remain as high as 4.0 billion in 2050 [18].
To understand the scale of this problem in the
future, our objective is to assess the potential exposure
of global and vulnerable populations to overlapping
multi-sectoral hotspots. This work investigates how
multi-sector risk changes with higher levels of warming
and to what extent climate mitigation, socioeconomic
development and poverty reduction can reduce risks.
We use established methods [2, 4, 19] for aggre-
gating climate risks, using 14 indicators across the
water, energy, and land sectors (table 1, figure 1).
We combine these indicators to produce multi-sector
risk hotspot maps, compared for 1.5◦, 2.0◦ and 3.0◦
changes in Global Meant Temperature (GMT) above
pre-industrial conditions (figure 2). Critically, we
investigate the exposure of the global and vulnera-
ble population (income <$10USD/day) using three
socioeconomic projections from the Shared Socioeco-
nomic Pathways (SSPs 1–3) [20]. Our central scenario
of sectoral risks is based on a 2 ◦C climate with 2050
population from SSP2. For the multi-sector hotspots,
we assess the global and vulnerable exposure across
SSPs and GMT change dimensions for 2050, to present
insights in to the dynamics between socioeconomic
development and risks at different levels of warming
and to better understand the uncertainties.
1.1. Background on previous methods and assess-
ments
Integrated assessment and impacts models use physi-
cal output variables from General Circulation Models
(GCMs) to study specific sectors in more detail,
for example in hydrology, land use and vegetation,
energy and fisheries. [11, 12] GCMs and impacts
models are frequently and consistently compared in
model inter-comparison exercises, such as the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) [21] and the
Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
(ISIMIP) [22, 23]). Growing sectoral coordination
meansthatmodelperformance,resultsanduncertainty
are more easily assessed within sectors, however there
have been few multi-sectoral assessments to date [4,
24]. Research has brought together multiple indica-
tors at different levels of GMT change, assessing the
fraction of global land area impacted, for extremes of
physical impacts [25] and for a wider range of impacts
for multiple sectors [26]. Others have [27–29] simi-
larly assessed risks, over various sectors with multiple
indicators, but with little explicit analysis of where risks
are projected to overlap.
To assess the severity of overlapping climate change
risks, climate change indices and metrics on regional
and national and gridded scales have been used using
GCM variables such as precipitation, air temperature
and sea-level rise [2, 19, 30–32]. And increasingly
studies frame their results in terms of global mean
temperature change as opposed to emissions scenar-
ios. For example, Sedl´
aˇ
cek and Knutti [33] assessed
6 CMIP5 seasonal variables of the hydrological cycle
for robust change [34], over 1 ◦C, 2 ◦C and 3 ◦C of
GMT change, finding that over half of the world’s
current population will experience robust changes in
precipitation, evaporation and relative humidity in
a 2 ◦C climate. Similarly, Piontek et al [4] identi-
fied geographical overlaps of multisectoral exposure

water, agriculture (four crop yields), ecosystems and
malaria using sectoral thresholds to identify locations
of ‘severe’ change.
Including different socioeconomic development
pathways, which may be co-dependent
on cli-
mate change mitigation, adds additional insight to
future societal exposure and vulnerability. The Shared
Socioeconomic
Pathways
[35–37]
offer
a
com-
prehensive framework for joint consideration of
socioeconomic
development and climate change
mitigation and adaptation challenges. New, socioe-
conomic projections with consistent 21st Century
narratives are available for the SSPs for population
[38], urbanization [39] and gross domestic prod-
uct [40]. Additionally downscaled spatial population
projections[41]andrecentincomedistributionprojec-
tions [18] enable new angles of climate impacts analysis
that better represent exposure and vulnerability.
2. Methods
2.1. Framework overview
Buildingontheaforementionedapproaches,thisstudy:
(i) developed indicator datasets at transient levels of
GMT; (ii) applied score ranges to transform indi-
cators onto common scoring scales; (iii) aggregated
sectoral indicators to make sectoral score maps for
water, energy and land; (iv) aggregated sectoral score
maps to make multi-sector risk maps; and (v) com-
bined multi-sector risk maps with population and
vulnerable population projections to assess exposure
and vulnerability to multi-sector risks.
We aim to examine simultaneously the change
in physical exposures with projected evolution of
population distribution and vulnerability to identify
multi-sector vulnerability hotspots. This allows some
evaluation of the three components of risk: hazards,
exposure, and vulnerability [63].
The indicators are assessed across a range of global
mean temperature rise relative to pre-industrial levels
(1.5 ◦C, 2 ◦C and 3 ◦C), and population and eco-
nomic activity trajectories consistent with the Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1, 2 and 3). The nine
combinations thus span a wide range of potential out-
comes but should not be viewed as equally likely or
compatible. For example, it will be more difficult to
reach ambitious climate targets in SSP3 as opposed
to SSP1 and 2 because increased mitigation challenges
are expected to accompany the slower development
narrative of SSP3 [36, 64]. Thus, the sectoral results
are mostly presented using the central scenario of 2 ◦C
GMTwithSSP2in2050,whilstsensitivitiesofGMTand
SSP are explored in the multi-sector exposure results.
2.2. Selection of indicators and subsectors
Water,
energy
and
land
sectors
were
assessed
across a set (S𝑖) of 4–6 representative indicators
(SI
table
S1
available
at
stacks.iop.org/ERL/13/
055012/mmedia). Each indicator was processed to rep-
resent the change in hazard between future climatic
conditions and the historical baseline (section 2.3).
An exception is for the lack of clean cooking access
indicator, as the availability of traditional biomass is
not expected to change with climate change and any
changes would be insignificant compared to the poten-
tial socioeconomic changes across SSPs. It is included
as a key indicator of vulnerability (see SI table S2).
Although not demonstrated in this study, the frame-
work allows for the substitution and weighting of
indicators, both within and between sectors, according
to preferences of the analyst.
2.3. Climate forcing
Most indicator datasets in this analysis use as inputs
the ISIMIP ‘Fast Track’ model database ensemble of
five general circulation models (GCMs) from CMIP5
[21]: GFDL-ESM2M; HadGEM2-ES; IPSL-CM5A-
LR; MIROC-ESM-CHEM; NorESM1-M. The GCMs
were consistently downscaled to spatial resolution
of 0.5◦, bias-corrected [65] to observed data [66],
and were selected for coverage of the uncertainty
range in temperature and precipitation variables from
the CMIP5 models [23].
We assess the climate hazards at three levels
of global mean surface temperature (GMT) change:
1.5 ◦C, 2 ◦C and 3◦C above the pre-industrial con-
ditions (PiC), compared to a baseline period of
1971–2000, of ∼0.6 ◦C above PiC (and acknowledg-
ing the importance of the PiC temperature choice
[67]).These temperatures, possible at multiple time-
frames within this century [68], do not represent
climate stabilization scenarios, but are used to rep-
resent the risks at different levels of warming in a
transient climate.
We follow the established time-sampling approach
[4, 26, 69] of selecting a 30 year temperature times-
lice, centred on the year at which the GCM passes the
relevant GMT. GCM model runs are forced by the
greenhouse gas and radiative forcing trajectories from
theRepresentativeConcentrationPathways(RCP)[70,
71], using RCP8.5 in the majority of cases and RCP4.5
and RCP6.0 in a few cases where the SSP-RCP com-
bination is endogenous to the impact model (see SI
table S1 for exact details). For example, HadGEM2-
ES RCP8.5 passes 2 ◦C in 2028, so the 30 years
selected to represent a 2 ◦C climate, were 2014–2043
inclusive.
To make meaningful and consistent comparison
between the three GMT scenarios and three SSP
socioeconomic projections, the year 2050 was cho-
sen for the SSPs for scenario comparison. In this
year, the three levels of GMT change (which are not
stabilization scenarios) are all possible with varying
probability, due to the range of emissions scenarios
and geophysical response uncertainty [72, 73]. This
was verified for consistency using the IPCC Working
4
 Environ. Res. Lett. 13 (2018) 055012
Group III scenario database (available online at:
https://secure.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/ene/AR5DB/) [74]
(SI 1.2). This allows for a more consistent compari-
son of exposure, than a time-varying alternative, for
example, which would be comparing 1.5 ◦C GMT
change with a 2040s population and 3 ◦C with a 2080s
population.
2.4. Indicator and sectoral aggregation
Theindicatorsarecombinedinaconsistentwaytofacil-
itate comparisons, impacts aggregation and to identify
overlapping locations of risk. Whilst some studies use
a single thresholds or discrete intervals [2, 4, 19, 30]
for each sector, this binary approach potentially misses
at-risk areas that may fall just under the threshold.
Other studies used discrete intervals.
Our approach maps the sectoral impact indica-
tors onto a continuous risk-indicator scale, ranging
between no negative impact to high negative impacts
and scored between 0 and 3. Intervals on the scale are
specified by the sectoral modelling teams at [0, 1, 2, 3]
to represent no, low, moderate and high levels of risk,
as judged through interrogation of the original data,
incorporating expert judgement, for which we test
the sensitivity (section 2.5). The continuum between
0 and 3 can be linear or any other line (SI fig-
ures S4–5). Every gridsquare in each spatial indicator
dataset is subsequently scored, S𝑖, using the continu-
ous scale. The scores are then aggregated to quantify
a sectoral score, 𝜃𝑠, for water, energy, and land,
respectively.
For example, for the water stress index, it is
commonly agreed that an index of between 0.2–0.4
represents water stress [42]. Thus, our central estimate
uses 0.4 for a score of 3 (high risk), 0.3 for a score of 2
(moderate risk), 0.2 for a score of 1 (low risk) and 0.1
as threshold to get a score above 0.
For the aggregation of sectoral and multi-sector
scores, in principle, either averaging or summation can
be used. We use averaging for the calculation of the
sectoral scores such that different numbers of indi-
cators can be combined. Summation is applied then
to the multi-sector risk calculation because using this
aggregation to represent cumulative of risk is more
intuitive.
Sectoral scores are defined following two rules:
first, the average score of all indicators per sector,
̄
𝑆𝑖, is calculated. Second, in grid squares where a
minimum number of sectoral indicators present at
least a moderate or high risk, sectoral scores are
assigned a minimum value. This is done to avoid
the problem whereby moderate and high risk indi-
cator scores get lost through averaging over multiple
indicators.
Let 𝛾 be an operator that sums the number of indi-
cators in the indicator function 𝟙 with a score S𝑖> 𝜏.
𝛾(
𝑠,𝜏)=
∑
𝑠𝑖∈𝑆 𝟙𝑠𝑖⩾𝜏
(1)
The sectoral score 𝜃 is adjusted following:

2 if 𝛾(
s,3)= 2 and s < 2
3 if 𝛾(
s,3)> 2 and s < 2
𝑠 otherwise
.
(2)
To calculate the aggregation of risk over multiple sec-
tors, the sectoral scores (figure 1, central column) are
summed (∑𝜃) to give the multi-sectoral risk score (M)
that combines all indicators on a scale of 0–9. In this
way, we assess the aggregation of risk over multiple
sectors.
2.5. Indicator score ranges and uncertainty
Given disagreement and uncertainty on how to
determine the score scales, score ranges specify low
(precautionary), central and high (conservative) esti-
mates for each point on each indicator scale (SI table
S4). Each sectoral modelling team from the IIASA
Water, Energy and Ecosystems Services and Man-
agement research programs reviewed and justified
the score ranges for each indicator. Our sensitivity
analysis ran 100 realisations, where for each indicator,
the interval was sampled randomly from the uni-
form distribution of the score ranges (SI figure S5).
Percentiles of these expert-informed score-ranges are
subsequently used in the uncertainty analysis (figure 5,
also evident in figure 3(a)).
2.6. Component uncertainty analysis
Our uncertainty analysis [75] determines the variabil-
ity (through coefficient of variation) across the key
uncertaintycomponentsofGCM,ImpactModel,Score
Range,GMTandSSP(figure5).Thiswassystematically
assessed using all available model variants and scenar-
ios (290 in total, hereafter variants) by counting the
number of gridsquares with a score above the mod-
erate risk threshold (in all cases S𝑖 ≥ 2, apart from the
hotspot score Ms𝑖 ≥ 4), with the coefficient of variation
calculated across that component. This assessment was
carried out at three exposure subsets (SI figures S25–
27): all land gridsquares (∼65 000); gridsquares with
population density > 10 people km−2 (∼21–23 000,
depending on SSP); gridsquares with vulnerable pop-
ulation density > 10 people km−2 (∼5–12 000).
2.7. Socioeconomic pathways, income projections
and gridded vulnerability
Gridded projections of population and GDP for
SSPs 1–3 spanning 2010–2050 [41] at 0.125◦ res-
olution are used to identify the distribution and
numbers of exposed and vulnerable populations. We
use recently compiled datasets of global income dis-
tributions and inequality [18] to estimate vulnerable
populations using an income threshold. These datasets
are generated for each scenario using machine-learning
regression tree techniques for urban and rural income,

which are downscaled using urbanization and migra-
tion patterns to give gridded projections of vulnerable
population (SI section 3.1, figure S15).
This analysis uses definitions from the World
Bank for categorising population as vulnerable. Whilst
income level of $1.9 USD/day (2011 purchasing power
parity) commonly defines extreme poverty, those
living on <$10 USD/dayare considered vulnerable to
poverty. This category and income level is appro-
priate because it specifically captures the population
fraction that lack ‘economic stability and resilience
to shocks that characterizes middle-class households’
[76, 77]. These shocks can be natural hazards, loss of
income, illness or conflict, for example.
2.8. Multi-sector hotspot threshold analysis
Whilst the hotspot analysis uses a continuous distri-
bution of impacts scoring, thresholds are used to cut
the population exposure according to multi-sector risk
(MSR) severity and population vulnerability.
Specifically, we consider that MSR ≥ 4.0 defines
a multi-sector risk (see 3.2 for explanation). The
total exposed and exposed and vulnerable popula-
tions decrease with higher MSR thresholds. For the
centralcase,weuseMSR ≥ 5.0toindicateamulti-sector
hotspot,withsensitivityresultsatMSR≥4.0andMSR≥
6.0 in the SI. The additional population exposed at 2 ◦C
and 3 ◦C, above the 1.5 ◦C reference case, is presented
in SI figure S24.
3. Results
We first present the sectoral indicator results, followed
by the multi-sector risks, and finally the exposure and
vulnerability assessment on global and regional basis.
3.1. Sectoral results
Water sector indicators have a wide range of risks of
varying spatial coverage. Results are driven both by
small areas of concentrated, high score indicators (w1,
w2, w4) and widespread areas of moderate risk (w3, w5,
w6). Water stress (WSI) and groundwater stress indices
are substantially demand driven and thus are spatially
concentrated in population centres and intense water
demand regions. The more bio-physical indicators of
drought intensity, inter-annual variability, and sea-
sonality have more widespread risks and affect larger
areas of land, including cropland and less populated

areas. Arid areas for indicators w3 to w6 were masked
out. Areas of particular concern include southwestern
North America, southeastern Brazil, northern Africa,
the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and western,
southern and eastern Asia.
The energy sector indicators are strongly driven by
locations of higher air temperatures and population
density, due to the expected increases in air temper-
ature changes that drive cooling energy demands and
heat event exposure, particularly in the tropics. The
hydroclimatic risk to power plants indicator is con-
fined to a very small proportion of land grid squares
(6%); however, high correlation of power plants with
population density means the effects are not lost when
accounting for population exposure. Few locations
by spatial extent present high levels of risk, aside
from the Middle East, pockets of sub-Saharan Africa
and Southeast Asia, driven by low clean cooking access,
more heatwaves and higher cooling demands. Large
areas present consistently medium levels of risk, such
as sub-Saharan Africa, central, South and Southeast
Asia and central America.
Land sector impacts are widespread and cover
large portions of all continents except Australia.
Nitrate leaching is most widespread with many loca-
tions exceeding sustainable levels due to agricultural
input intensification. Reductions in crop yields and
habitat degradation also drive the sectoral score. Loca-
tions of agricultural water exploitation that would
violate environmental flow requirements, increases
in areas already dependent on irrigated agriculture:
North America, South Asia, and China. Overall,
Midwest United States, southeastern Brazil, Ethiopia
and South Sudan, the Mediterranean and most of
South and Southeast Asia, all present moderately
high impacts.
3.2. Multi-sector climate risks and global exposure
Multi-sector risk (MSR) occurs at locations where two
or more sectors surpass a tolerable level of risk. In
this study, we consider that the minimum MSR to
define a multi-sector risk is 4.0. It represents, for exam-
ple, two sectors at moderate risk (2 + 2), one sector
at high risk and another at low levels (3 + 1), three
sectors at low-moderate risk (e.g. 3 × 1.34), or a simi-
lar combination. MSR ≥ 6.0 represents moderate risk
across 6+ indicators in three sectors, or high risk in
4+ indicators in two sectors. An MSR of 9 is the the-
oretical maximum score for any grid square, which
following the hotspot scoring would indicate at least
two indicators in every sector at high risk, fortunately
not observed in these results. Here, we present results
at an MSR ≥ 5.0, with sensitivity at 4.0 and 6.0 (SI
figures S12–14, S16–21).
For the multi-sector risk scores two main trends
emerge as global mean temperature rises (figure 2).
First, the area of land affected by climate risks grows
in area, particularly populated areas (figure 2, fig-
ure 3(a)). At 1.5 ◦C risks are predominantly in South
Asia. Secondly, the risks intensify in some locations,
with more MSR heterogeneity and more pronounced
differences between the 1.5 ◦C and 3 ◦C scenarios,
as shown by the wider distribution in figure 3(a).
For example, at 1.5 ◦C, MSR scores between 4–6 are
fairly uniform across small areas, whilst a 3 ◦C GMT
results in hotspots of high MSR, interspersed with
wider areas of moderate risk. High risks occur pri-
marily in Central America, East Africa and West Asia,
the Mediterranean, the Middle East, most of South
Asia and East China.
Although the fraction of global land area exposed
to MSR ≥ 5.0 is 3%–16% across GMT scenarios, the
equivalent fraction of exposed population is sub-
stantially larger and rises more rapidly with GMT
increases (figure 3(a)). For example, whilst at 1.5 ◦C
only 16% (1.5bi) of the population faces MSR ≥ 5.0,
29% (2.7bi) and 50% (4.6bi) are similarly exposed in
2 ◦C and 3 ◦C climates, respectively. These impacts also
scale with latitude, noticeably between 40◦N and 10◦S
(SI 3.4).
Comparing the macro-regions (figure 3(b)), Latin
America, Africa and Southeast Asia and Australasia
include at least one region with worse population expo-
sure than the global median (Caribbean, West Africa,
Southeast Asia). The exceptions are Asia, where most
regions are above the global median exposure, and
North America and Europe, where all have lower than
median exposure. The least exposed region is Alaska
and the most exposed regions are Southeast Asia, South
Asia and Tibetan Plateau.
3.3. Global exposure and vulnerability
Considering the total global population exposure
(MSR ≥ 5.0), global mean temperature rise has a
considerably stronger effect than the differences in
population between the SSPs. Between 1.5 ◦C and
2 ◦C, the total population exposure to multi-sector
risks increases by 69%–113% (SSP3-SSP1), whilst the
level of exposed and vulnerable population (E&V)
(black shaded areas figure 4(a)) increases by 60%–
258% (with large differences in absolute numbers
between the SSPs (SI figures S16–18, tables S6–7)).
At 3 ◦C, whilst impacts are more severe, the number
of E&V increases by similar absolute numbers, but
less in relative terms. This is largely because the spa-
tial extent of risks does not increase as much between
2 ◦C–3 ◦C as it does from 1.5 ◦C–2 ◦C (figure 2). Fur-
thermore, whilst at 1.5 ◦C, locations may experience
only moderate-high impacts in one sector, at 2 ◦C
there is a strong emergence of multiple, moderate-high
risks.
Thebenefitsofpovertyandinequalityreductionare
made clear when E&V population numbers are com-
pared for different SSPs (figure 4(b)). Whilst SSP1,
and to a large extent SSP2, project widespread poverty

growing poor populations in Africa and South Asia.
South, East and West Asia, have both some of the high-
est MSR scores and vulnerable populations (figure 3).
Subsequently, in SSP3 there are between 8–32x more
E&V population compared to SSP1, concentrated in
the African and Asian regions with between 25%–
100% more E&V in 2050 than compared to the 2010
demographic.
Thelargestco-benefitsofpovertyreductionandcli-
mate mitigation are for Africa and South Asia. Overall,
there are approximately factors of ∼30–190x differ-
ence of total E&V population between the best case
(SSP1/1.5 ◦C) and worst case (SSP3/3 ◦C) scenario
combinations: with more severe impacts (i.e. MSR =
6.0) the differences are accentuated (SI figures S16–
21, tables S6–7). This growing scale factor with MSR
threshold indicates that in worst case scenarios, higher
fractions of a larger vulnerable population will be living
in areas of particularly high risk.
Latitude also plays a role in the distribution of
impacts (SI figure S23), consistently across a number
of metrics. Whether assessed by mean score per pixel,

weightedimpact,latitudesbetween40◦Ntotheequator
fare worst; southern hemisphere quite poorly; and

Figure 3. Distributions of global population and land area exposure to multi-sector risk score in 2050 with SSP2 population. Top
panel (a) shows the exposure aggregated for the whole world by population and land area. Shaded areas around the lines represent the
indicator score ranges uncertainty (Methods 2.5, and SI 1.4). Lower panel (b) is the population exposure for over 27 IPCC land regions
(SI table S4 for three letter region codes). Noticeably, the differences in MSR on population, according to GMT, are most pronounced
when MSI ≈4.0. At this level, population exposed in 1.5 ◦C is less than half that of a 3 ◦C climate. Land area exposure differences are
smaller, as some of the impacts indicators are more driven by population. The differences between regions (b) are substantial, for
example all North American subregions are below the global median exposure, whilst almost all Asian regions are above.
4. Discussion
Sustainable development that actively reduces socioe-
conomic inequality, poverty and population growth in
Africa and Asia is ultimately the most effective way
of reducing the total number of people categorized as
exposed and vulnerable to climate change risks. An
SSP3 future, with which low emissions scenarios are
technically incompatible, results in order of magni-
tude higher exposed and vulnerable populations than
SSP1. However, keeping population and inequality
levels as low as projected in SSP1 is extremely ambi-
tious and only possible if SDG targets for mortality,
reproductive health and female education are achieved
and sustained long-term [78].
Even still, the huge absolute numbers of peo-
ple exposed to multi-sector risks (∼1–5 billion), even
in high income countries, underscore the benefits of
climate mitigation. Most strikingly, the differences
between 1.5 ◦C and 2 ◦C are substantial, strongly indi-
cating the compounding risk with higher levels of
warming. Efforts to meet the SDGs and low temper-
ature targets of the Paris Agreement will substantially
reduce global exposure to multi-sector risks, especially
if recognized co-benefits are targeted [79]. Energy sec-
tor targets will facilitate achievement of other SDGs,
particularly climate [80–82]. Without action on cli-
mate change (SDG13), including slowing the rate
of warming, achieving the goals for water, energy,
food and land (SDGs 6, 7, 2 and 15), amongst oth-
ers [83], will be more difficult. Similarly, almost all
the SDGs are likely to contribute to poverty eradica-
tion (SDG1) and climate action (SDG13). Additionally
the work may support other multi-lateral environ-
mental agreements, such as the Sendai framework
on disaster risk reduction and the Addis Ababa
Agreement on finance and investment for sustainable
development.

shaded central segments are the exposed and vulnerable (E&V) population. For global exposure, GMT is the dominant driver over SSP population. However, the lower panel (b) shows how important socioeconomic development
is for reducing the E&V population. It compares, for a 2 ◦C climate, the E&V population in 2010 (background circle, currently 4.2billion), compared with the projected E&V population in 2050 in the foreground. Whilst poverty
reduction in SSP1 almost eradicates the E&V population in most regions by 2050, SSP3 results in substantial increases compared to 2010 in Asia and Africa due to high levels of inequality.

Figure 5. Contributions to uncertainty, measured as coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation, RSD), on proportional and
absolute basis for gridsquares with exposed (indicator/sectoral/MSR scores ≥ 2/2/4, respectively).
Hotspots with high multi-sector risk, such as in
WestAfrica,SouthandSoutheastAsia,theMiddleEast,
and north east Brazil, indicate where vulnerable pop-
ulations will benefit most from targeted actions and
further modelling exercises [85]. Further assessment
could also include a broader coverage of sectors and
indicators, for example, coastal and marine environ-
ments and health, or analysis at river basin and country
scales.
In selecting indicators, understanding both their
correlation (SI figure S28) and uncertainty structure
(figure 5) has contributed to important analytical
improvements and interpretation of the results. Whilst
model and internal uncertainties (from GCM, Impact
Models (IM) and Score Range (SR)) contribute most
to impact uncertainties over land, irreducible scenario
uncertainty (GMT and SSP) becomes significantly
more important in every indicator when assessing
exposed and vulnerable populations. Notwithstand-
ing,improvingmodelperformance in highlypopulated
regions is critical. Whilst the uncertainty analysis
indicates that uncertainties in the water indicators
are largest, it was also the sector with the largest
model ensembles, with up to 25 GCM x IM com-
binations. The covariance analysis revealed generally
very low correlation between indicators, particularly
in populated areas, indicating that the resulting chal-
lenges will need multiple strategies, as opposed to
tackling key pairs of highly co-dependent indicators.
Further work could consider the risks of specific
combinations of dependent variables, such as for
heat events, drought and crop-yields, using multi-
variate approaches for compound extremes, because
univariate approaches can underestimate these risks
[86].
It is not just extremes that result in the most severe
impacts. Average events can have extreme impacts
because of high vulnerability, antecedent conditions
and low coping capacity [14]. Low incomes, infor-
mal employment and low property values are poorly
represented by traditional loss accounting approaches
and indicators like loss in GDP [87], cost-benefit anal-
ysis and damage functions. This can result in gross
underestimates of the economic and social impacts
on the most vulnerable in society. Whilst the use of
a global income level to represent vulnerability is a
simplification, nonetheless, this assessment is the first
to use gridded projections of income distribution to
indicate future vulnerability at the global scale. Analysis
usingdifferentincomelevels,ornationalandprovincial
poverty lines and at urban-rural gridded disaggrega-
tion will soon be possible and will provide even better
insights on how risks could be spatially distributed in
the future.
5. Conclusions
Although global exposure to multi-sector risks (fig-
ure 3) will affect a relatively small fraction of global
land area, the risks to human populations will be
large. Between 1.5 ◦C–3 ◦C, the increase in exposed
population to multi-sector risks almost doubles from
1.5 ◦C–2 ◦C, and similarly again at 3 ◦C (1.5:2.7:4.6
bi). The differences between the socioeconomic pro-
jections are smaller, but not insignificant and are due
to different population numbers. Both the scale of and
the differences between these numbers underlines the
multi-dimensional risks of climate change that will be
experienced across the world regardless of wealth.

Exposure in Asian regions is the most severe, on
proportional and absolute terms, due to the high con-
centrations of population and the high multi-sector
risks of those regions. Asian and African regions face
high proportions (>75%) of exposed population com-
pared to their total population.
For populations exposed and vulnerable to poverty
(E&V), i.e. daily income<$10/day, the importance
of socioeconomic development potentially alters the
number of E&V by an order of magnitude (∼0.1–1.5bi,
SSP1–3). Whilst approximately 85%–95% of global
exposure falls to Asian and African regions, they have
91%–98% of the E&V population, approximately half
of which in South Asia.
As the most undeveloped region, Africa fares worse
than most regions (particularly East Africa), especially
in high inequality socioeconomic scenarios and high
warming climate scenarios. In higher warming scenar-
ios, African regions have higher fractions of the global
E&V population, ranging from 7%–17% at 1.5 ◦C,
doubling to 14%–30% at 2 ◦C and again to 27%–51%
at 3 ◦C.
The results also indicate that the poorest are
also disproportionately impacted by multi-sector risks.
Compared to a 1.5 ◦C baseline, the number of exposed
and vulnerable scales faster than the exposed pop-
ulation, driven by both the warming level and the
inequality levels. Further assessments to understand
the distributional risks of climate change to different
levels of vulnerability are required.
Climate mitigation alone is not enough to reduce
exposure to the world’s poorest, who will still be vul-
nerable to impacts at 1.5 ◦C. Action to rapidly reduce
inequality, eradicate poverty and promote proactive
adaptation through mechanisms such as the SDGs,
would greatly reduce the size of exposed and vulner-
able population, especially if co-benefits for climate
mitigation also accrue.
