Objectives To estimate the potential impacts of different 
Brexit trade policy scenarios on the price and intake of 
fruits and vegetables (F&V) and consequent cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) deaths in England between 2021 and 2030.
Design Economic and epidemiological modelling study 
with probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
setting The model combined publicly available data 
on F&V trade, published estimates of UK-specific price 
elasticities, national survey data on F&V intake, estimates 
on the relationship between F&V intake and CVD from 
published meta-analyses and CVD mortality projections for 
2021–2030.
Participants English adults aged 25 years and older.
Interventions We modelled four potential post-Brexit 
trade scenarios: (1) free trading agreement with the EU 
and maintaining half of non-EU free trade partners; (2) free 
trading agreement with the EU but no trade deal with any 
non-EU countries; (3) no-deal Brexit; and (4) liberalised 
trade regime that eliminates all import tariffs.
Outcome measures Cumulative coronary heart disease 
and stroke deaths attributed to the different Brexit 
scenarios modelled between 2021 and 2030.
results Under all Brexit scenarios modelled, prices of 
F&V would increase, especially for those highly dependent 
on imports. This would decrease intake of F&V between 
2.5% (95% uncertainty interval: 1.9% to 3.1%) and 11.4% 
(9.5% to 14.2%) under the different scenarios. Our model 
suggests that a no-deal Brexit scenario would be the 
most harmful, generating approximately 12 400 (6690 
to 23 390) extra CVD deaths between 2021 and 2030, 
whereas establishing a free trading agreement with the 
EU would have a lower impact on mortality, contributing 
approximately 5740 (2860 to 11 910) extra CVD deaths.
Conclusions Trade policy under all modelled Brexit 
scenarios could increase price and decrease intake of F&V, 
generating substantial additional CVD mortality in England. 
The UK government should consider the population health 
implications of Brexit trade policy options, including 
changes to food systems.
IntrODuCtIOn
Trade policy exerts a powerful influence on 
risk factors for non-communicable disease 
and thus for population health.1 One promi-
nent mechanism is the effect of trade on food 
environments, through changes in the avail-
ability and affordability of food commodities.2 
Evidence suggests that entering new trading 
blocs and opening domestic markets to 
international trade has been associated with 
increased imports, sales and intake of highly 
processed foods.3–6 However, there is a lack 
of evidence on the effect of trade on healthy 
food commodities, while no previous studies 
have investigated the potential impacts of 
exiting a large trading bloc.
Brexit—the impending exit of the UK 
from the European Union (EU)—will have 
profound implications across a range of 
sectors. One of the main changes will involve 
the introduction of a new trade regime that 
will redefine the trade relationships between 
the UK and the EU and non-EU countries. 
This is likely to affect food environments in 
the UK, given its high dependency on imports 
to meet its dietary needs.7 This is particularly 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This study uses nationally representative dietary 
intake data, robust mortality projections and both 
own-price and cross-price effect estimates to eval-
uate the impact of different Brexit scenarios on the 
price and intake of disaggregated fruit and vegeta-
ble subgroups and associated CVD outcomes.
 
► Fruit and vegetable imports were approximated 
using the latest available data, assuming import 
shares will not change after Brexit.
 
► Trade transaction costs due to technical regulations 
are based on published estimates that might also 
reflect costs attributed to demand changes, thus 
overestimating real transaction costs.
 
► Response to price increases of fruits and vegeta-
bles were estimated using historical purchase data 
and might not reflect consumer response to price 
change post-Brexit.
 
► The scenarios modelled are not exhaustive and 
more trade policy options might arise as Brexit ne-
gotiations continue.

the case for fruits and vegetables (F&V). For example, 
in 2017, 84% of fruits and 43% of vegetables in the UK 
were imported.8 Thus, changes to the UK trade regime 
are likely to affect prices of F&V by increasing costs of 
trade. With price being one of the main determinants of 
consumer behaviour in the UK,9 Brexit could affect F&V 
intake with significant implications for UK diets.
Low F&V intake is a major risk factor of many non-com-
municable diseases, including cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Approximately 1.3 million CVD deaths could 
have been prevented globally in 2013 if intake of F&V was 
higher than 500 grams/day (g/day).10 The UK performs 
poorly in terms of F&V intake; only 27% of adults aged 
19–64 years and 35% of those above 65 years achieve daily 
recommended intakes.11 Thus, Brexit trade scenarios that 
change the price and availability of F&V are likely to have 
substantial impacts on CVD outcomes in the UK. This 
analysis aimed to quantify the potential impacts of F&V 
price changes due to Brexit on CVD deaths in England 
between 2021 and 2030.
MethODs
We extended the previously validated IMPACT Food 
Policy model12–14 to estimate the effect of different Brexit 
scenarios on the price and intake of F&V in England. We 
then modelled consequent impacts on cumulative coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality in English 
adults aged 25 years and above, stratified by age and sex, 
over a 10-year period in order to capture medium-term 
effects.
Data sources
We used import and tariff data from the World Trade Orga-
nization (WTO)15 and the HM Revenues and Customs16 
to estimate the effect of different Brexit scenarios on 
price of F&V. We describe these data in more detail in 
online supplementary appendix A.
The effect of price changes on intake of F&V products 
was estimated using published UK-specific price elastic-
ities.17 Price elasticities measure the change in demand 
of a good as a response to a change in its own price 
(own-price elasticity) or the price of another good (cross-
price elasticity). Price elasticities for five fruit (apples and 
pears; bananas; citrus fruit; grapes; and other fruits) and 
seven vegetable (brassica, such as cabbages, cauliflower 
and broccoli; legumes, such as beans and peas; lettuce; 
onions; other vegetables; root vegetables; tomatoes) 
subgroups were available. We used conditional uncom-
pensated own-price and cross-price elasticities to take 
into account the differential effect of Brexit on the prices 
of different F&V. Conditional price elasticities, usually 
recommended at this level of product disaggregation, 
assume that food expenditure available to all other prod-
ucts remains constant, and uncompensated price elastici-
ties assume that consumer income is held constant.17
We estimated total F&V intake in English adults by sex 
and age (25–44, 45–74, 75+ years) using data from the 
National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme 
(2008/2009 to 2015/2016).18 This is a nationally repre-
sentative survey of UK adults and children that uses a 
4-day food diary to evaluate dietary intake. As the effect 
of the different Brexit scenarios varies across different 
F&V products, we used household purchase data (in 
grams/person/week) for England from the Family Food 
Module of the Living Costs and Food Survey 2016/201719 
to approximate intake of F&V subgroups. The survey uses 
a 2-week diary to identify purchases and expenditures of 
foods in UK households. We adjusted the overall F&V 
intake using the ratio of purchases of F&V subgroups 
with overall F&V purchases. We assumed a constant ratio 
across all sex and age groups.
Changes in F&V intake were translated into mortality 
changes using relative risk estimates of CHD, ischaemic 
stroke and haemorrhagic stroke with fruit intake and 
vegetable intake, derived from meta-analyses of longitu-
dinal studies and further adjusted for an effect modifica-
tion by age.20 Employing age-specific relative risks allowed 
us to incorporate the declining effect of age on the rela-
tionships between risk factors and CVD, which has been 
previously described.21 The authors assumed a linear 
relationship between risk and mortality of the outcomes, 
that is, associations with incident CVD and CVD mortality 
were used interchangeably. The relative risk estimates are 
presented in online supplementary table 1.
Finally, this model employed sex and age (10-year groups 
from 25 to 34 years until 85+ years) specific CVD mortality 
projections between 2021 and 2030, which were estimated 
using a Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model and historic 
CVD mortality and population data from the Office for 
National Statistics. The methodology is described in more 
detail in online supplementary appendix B.
The data and data sources used in this model are 
summarised in table 1.
Modelled scenarios
The UK, as an EU Member State, is part of the EU Single 
Market and Customs Union. As a result, trade between 
the UK and the EU is tariff free and frictionless with no 
tariff or non-tariff trade barriers in place.22 Trade between 
the UK and non-EU countries is also regulated by the EU, 
with common preferential trade agreements and external 
tariffs across all EU Member States. At an international 
level, trade is regulated by the WTO, which is used as a 
platform for its members to negotiate and ratify trade 
agreements.
Following the referendum in June 2016, the UK 
government has announced its intentions to leave the EU 
Single Market and Customs Union and negotiate a new 
trading relationship with the EU and third countries.23 
The current intention from both the UK and the EU is 
that this will happen 2 years after Brexit, following a tran-
sition period that will maintain the trade status quo while 
allowing the UK to negotiate a future permanent trading 
position.

For this analysis, we modelled four post-Brexit trade 
scenarios commencing in 2021 when the transition 
period will end:
1. Free trading agreement with the EU and third coun-
tries (S1).
In this scenario, the UK establishes a zero-tariff free 
trading agreement with the EU, while it also maintains 
half of its non-EU tariff-free F&V importers.
2. Free trading agreement with the EU (S2).
Under this scenario, the UK establishes a zero-tariff 
free trading agreement with the EU but loses all pref-
erential access to markets of non-EU F&V importers.
3. No-deal Brexit (S3).
Under a no-deal scenario, the UK falls back into a 
WTO default position, having no preferential arrange-
ments with the EU or non-EU importers.
4. Liberalised trade regime (S4).
Under a liberalised trade regime, the UK trades under 
WTO regulations with no specific trade arrangements 
in place but eliminates all its F&V import tariffs. This 
is an extreme case scenario that shows the impact of 
non-tariff trade barriers on F&V trade.
Under each scenario, we assumed two main drivers of 
F&V import price change. First, we expect an increase in 
transaction costs when trading with the EU due to a rise 
in post-Brexit border controls. We assumed a 5% increase 
in transaction costs due to rules of origin checks24 in the 
scenarios that a free trading agreement is applied and 
an additional 4.5% increase due to checks for technical 
regulations in the scenarios that no preferential trade 
arrangements are in place.25 We describe these esti-
mates and its sources in detail in online supplementary 
appendix C. Second, we assumed changes in F&V import 
tariffs15 that vary under the different Brexit scenarios. 
Specifically, import tariffs were assumed to be zero under 
a free trading agreement or a liberalised regime and 
equal to the EU tariffs otherwise. Table 2 demonstrates 
the change in tariffs and transaction costs that would 
occur to F&V imports from the EU, non-EU countries 
under a preferential arrangement with the EU and other

non-EU countries, under each Brexit scenario. Calcula-
tions for each scenario are described in more detail in 
online supplementary appendix C. The estimated change 
in price of F&V imports was translated into change in 
wholesale F&V price using an estimate of imports as a 
percentage of overall F&V supply in the UK, obtained 
from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural 
Affairs26 (see online supplementary appendix A for more 
details).
the IMPACt Food Policy model
The IMPACT Food Policy model has been previously used 
to estimate the effect of different policies on dietary intake 
and CVD in the UK12 and elsewhere.27 We extended the 
model to estimate the effect of different Brexit scenarios 
on prices of F&V subgroups as described above. We then 
translated changes in prices into changes in intake taking 
into account potential substitution between subgroups. 
We allowed the price of each F&V subgroup to change one 
by one until final equilibrium was reached, that is, when 
prices of all F&V subgroups had changed. The intake 
change was the difference between intake at final equilib-
rium and baseline. Finally, the model translated changes 
in intake into changes in mortality using appropriate rela-
tive risks. We assumed common relative risks for all fruit 
and all vegetable subgroups. The risk reduction effect of 
overall F&V was estimated using a cumulative risk-reduc-
tion approach.28 Changes in mortality were expressed 
as number of deaths attributed to each Brexit scenario. 
CVD mortality was estimated as the sum of CHD, isch-
aemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke. Based on recent 
evidence,29 we assumed a lag time of less than a year for 
changes in F&V intake to impact CVD outcomes, thus lag 
time was not explicitly incorporated in the model. Calcu-
lations are described in more detail in online supplemen-
tary appendix D and a schematic representation of the 
model is shown in online supplementary figure 1.
uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to take 
into account uncertainty of model inputs. We employed 
Monte Carlo simulations to repeatedly draw random 
values of the inputs from their statistical distributions and 
run the model across multiple iterations. The estimates 
and their respective statistical distributions are presented 
in online supplementary table 2. The median and 2.5 and 
97.5 percentiles of 1000 iterations were used to produce 
estimates and their 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs).
As a response to an increase in the price of F&V, 
consumers may shift to other F&V alternatives. We 
performed an additional sensitivity analysis to take into 
account possible substitution between fresh F&V and 
canned, dried and frozen F&V. The effect of the different 
Brexit scenarios on price of canned, dried and frozen 
F&V was estimated following the same methodology as 
the main analysis. Then, cross-price elasticities were used 
to identify the effect of change in the price of canned, 
dried and frozen F&V on fresh F&V. Finally, the effect 
of change in intake of fresh F&V on CVD mortality was 
calculated. As the import and purchase data used in this 
analysis did not allow for disaggregation of canned, dried 
and frozen F&V based on their content in additives, such 
as salt or sugar, we conservatively assumed that canned, 
dried and frozen F&V were not associated with CVD 
outcomes. Details about data sources and calculations are 
presented in online supplementary appendix E.
Finally, we performed a second additional sensitivity 
analysis that allows domestic production of F&V to 
increase as a response to the increase in price of imported 
F&V. We assumed a 2% increase per year for all F&V 
subgroups except bananas, citrus fruits and grapes, which 
have currently no domestic production in the UK.

F&V prices
The estimated effect of Brexit scenarios on price of F&V 
subgroups are presented in figure 1. Price effects varied 
among different F&V subgroups, depending on the 
origin of imports, the applied tariffs and the percentage 
of supply that is imported.
The no-deal Brexit scenario (S3) would affect prices of 
F&V the most, especially for F&V that are highly depen-
dent on imports. For example, the model suggested that 
under a no-deal Brexit scenario, prices would increase 
by 16.9% (95% UI 16.6% to 17.1%) for bananas, 14.3% 
(7.6% to 27.2%) for citrus fruit and 14.9% (13.2% to 
16.6%) for tomatoes. In contrast, prices of root vege-
tables, whose imports contribute only 5% to their total 
supply, would increase between 0.3% (0.1% to 0.5%) and

1.1% (0.6% to 1.7%) under different Brexit scenarios. 
While a liberalised trade regime (S4) will eliminate all 
import tariffs, it would still increase prices of F&V due to 
the effect of non-tariff trade barriers on EU trade. Thus, 
it would mostly affect prices of F&V that are primarily 
imported from the EU, like citrus fruits and tomatoes 
with an estimated 4.2% (3.0% to 5.6%) and 6.0% (4.4% 
to 7.7%) increase in price, respectively. More detailed 
price effects are presented in online supplementary table 
3.
F&V intake
We estimated that mean intake of F&V at baseline was 
111 g/day and 190 g/day, respectively (online supplemen-
tary table 4). The most consumed fruits were bananas 
(26% of fruit intake) and apples and pears (19% of fruit 
intake), while root vegetables were the most consumed 
vegetables (17% of vegetable intake) (online supplemen-
tary table 5).
We estimated that intake of F&V would reduce under 
all Brexit scenarios (table 3). The no-deal Brexit scenario 
(S3) would have the largest effect, reducing intake of 
fruits by approximately 11.4% (9.5% to 14.2%) and 
vegetables by approximately 9.1% (7.8% to 11.0%). If a 
free trading agreement with the EU is established (S2), 
vegetable intake would reduce by 2.7% (2.2% to 3.3%), 
whereas intake of fruits would reduce by 7.0% (5.9% to 
8.4%). Intake effects on F&V subgroups are presented in 
online supplementary table 6.
CVD mortality
The number of deaths attributable to each Brexit 
scenario are presented in table 4 and figure 2. The 
no-deal Brexit scenario (S3) would be the most impactful, 
contributing approximately 12 400 (6690 to 23 390) extra 
CVD deaths or a 1.7% increase in CVD mortality over 
the modelling period of 2021–2030. Establishing a free 
trading agreement with the EU (S2) would have lower 
impacts on mortality contributing approximately 5740 
(2860 to 11 910) extra CVD deaths or a 0.8% increase 
in CVD mortality over the 10-year period. Free trading 
agreements with both the EU and half of the UK’s F&V 
importers (S1) would have more attenuated impacts, 
contributing approximately 4110 (2130 to 8100) extra 
CVD deaths or a 0.6% increase in CVD mortality. Even 
under a liberalised regime that eliminates all import 
tariffs (S4), Brexit would contribute approximately 4160 
(2330 to 7380) extra CVD deaths or a 0.6% increase in 
CVD mortality between 2021 and 2030 due to an increase 
in transaction costs of EU imports. Online supplementary 
table 7 provides the estimated effects on CVD mortality 
for a single year of the modelling analysis.
sensitivity analyses
Our model suggested that prices of canned, dried and 
frozen F&V would increase by approximately 10.3% 
(5.7% to 20.0%) for fruits and 6.8% (3.9% to 16.7%) for 
vegetables under a no-deal Brexit scenario (S3), as shown 
in online supplementary table 8. Incorporating cross-
price elasticities between fresh and canned, dried and 
frozen F&V in the model only slightly increased the effect 
of Brexit scenarios on intake of fresh F&V by up to 0.5% 
(online supplementary table 9). This would result to 
approximately 12 990 (7000 to 24 790) extra CVD deaths 
between 2021 and 2030 under a no-deal Brexit scenario 
(S3) (online supplementary table 10).
Our model that examined potential increases in the 
domestic production of some F&V did not substantially 
change our findings. The estimated effect on intake was 
0.7% lower for fruits and 1.5% for vegetables in the last 
year of the modelling period compared with the first 
year, under a no-deal Brexit scenario (S3) (online supple-
mentary table 11). Over the study period, this would 
contribute to between 210 and 720 fewer CVD deaths

analysis for which domestic production was assumed to 
be stable (online supplementary table 10).
DIsCussIOn
This is the first study to exclusively quantify the poten-
tial impacts of post-Brexit trade scenarios on F&V prices, 
intake and consequent CVD outcomes. Estimates from 
all modelled scenarios suggested that F&V prices would 
increase, hence reducing intake and contributing to 
additional CVD mortality. A no-deal Brexit scenario 
could be the most harmful, increasing CHD and stroke 
deaths by approximately 0.9% (4110 deaths) and 2.9% 
(8290 deaths), respectively, between 2021 and 2030. 
The least disruptive scenario modelled, which assumes a 
free trading agreement with the EU and half of non-EU 
F&V importers, could increase CHD and stroke deaths 
by approximately 0.3% (1360 deaths) and 1.0% (2740 
deaths), respectively.
Our findings are consistent with previous preliminary 
analyses that suggest likely increases in F&V prices post-
Brexit. A report from the House of Lords notes the vulner-
ability of F&V to price changes post-Brexit.30 An empirical 
estimation showed that the cost of consuming five F&V 
per day as per governmental guidelines will increase by 
£2.20 a week for a household of four under a no-deal 
Brexit scenario, after considering price inflation and an 
increase in import tariffs.31 Analysis using a partial equi-
librium model, which uses supply-and-demand curves to 
examine the effect of policy actions on single markets, 
has also shown that a no-deal Brexit might increase prices 
of fruits by 3.1% and vegetables by 4.0% although disag-
gregated effects on F&V subgroups were not further 
investigated.32 These analyses did not compare a no-deal 
Brexit scenario with other potential post-Brexit trade 
options. Furthermore, they did not account for the poten-
tial effect of non-tariff trade barriers that are likely to be 
an important driver of price change post-Brexit.
This study has several strengths. It estimates the effect 
of different Brexit scenarios on the price of disaggregated 
F&V subgroups, taking into account both own-price and 
cross-price effects to estimate changes in F&V intake. 
Sensitivity analysis also incorporated the additional effects 
of substitution with canned, dried and frozen F&V. This 
study uses nationally representative data on F&V intake 
and purchases. It also employs CVD mortality projec-
tions using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model, which 
has been shown to produce more robust predictions 
compared with conventional methods.33
However, it also has some limitations. We used the 
most recent import data from 2015 to approximate F&V 
imports post-Brexit, assuming that F&V import shares will 
not change. This assumption might overestimate the price 
effects of scenarios that involve free trading agreements 
(S1 and S2) as the UK could shift towards importers that 
trade under these free trading agreements. There might 
be some discrepancies in the definition of F&V subgroups 
across different datasets. We explicitly describe each 
definition in online supplementary appendix A. Trade 
transaction costs due to technical regulations are based 
on published estimates derived using non-tariff measure 
data from 65 countries.25 These estimates might overesti-
mate the real costs as they might also reflect a price effect 
attributed to an increase in demand after complying with 
quality improving technical regulations in some coun-
tries. In this analysis, we conservatively omitted the poten-
tial impact of inflation on F&V price to minimise model 
uncertainty, which might underestimate price effects. We 
used robust estimates of UK specific price elasticities.17 
However, these elasticities were estimated using histor-
ical purchase data (2000–2009) and might not reflect the 
consumer response to price change after a potential wider 
economic shock of Brexit. Our model assumes a linear 
association between price, intake and CVD outcomes 
under the different Brexit scenarios. However, real-life 
associations in the medium-term and long-term may be 
characterised by feedback mechanisms in response to 
system disruptions, such as Brexit. This can be addressed 
using computational general equilibrium models, which 
have been widely used to estimate Brexit effects on trade, 
productivity and welfare34 35 but are more appropriate 
when modelling wider economic impacts across various 
sectors. Although this study includes a sensitivity analysis 
that investigates a potential increase in domestic produc-
tion of F&V as a feedback response to an increase in price 
of imports, it does not provide a comprehensive investi-
gation of the economic feedback effects of our modelled 
Brexit scenarios. Finally, we modelled four post-Brexit 
trade scenarios reflecting governmental and expert 
consensus.36 However, ongoing negotiations within the 
British government and the Conservative party37 and

between the British government and the EU38 means that 
the political space around Brexit is continuously changing 
and more trade policy options might arise.
F&V intake in the UK is suboptimal with less than 
half of the population consuming daily recommended 
levels.11 Our analysis suggests that all modelled Brexit 
trade policy scenarios could increase price and reduce 
intake of F&V. The UK government needs to develop a 
comprehensive policy response against this potential 
detrimental impact by aligning domestic nutrition and 
agricultural policies and future trade policy with public 
health aims. At the same time, the wider implications of 
Brexit to the UK food system should also be considered. 
For example, approximately 80 000 seasonal workers are 
employed in the UK every year to harvest F&V, with the 
majority of them recruited from EU countries.39 Abolish-
ment of the free movement of labour guaranteed by EU 
regulations is likely to reduce available workforce for the 
horticulture sector with potential implications to prices of 
domestically produced F&V. Brexit may also affect food 
quality and safety in the UK by potentially relaxing risk 
prevention requirements, like the precautionary prin-
ciple for food, which is currently eliminated from the EU 
(Withdrawal) Act 2018,40 in order to increase competi-
tiveness in international markets. Moreover, Brexit is 
likely to affect prices and intake of other food groups with 
potential implications for health. For example, a previous 
analysis has shown that a no-deal Brexit scenario would 
increase prices of all food products, with higher impacts 
on dairy, oils and fats and meat.32 Finally, the wider effects 
of Brexit on the UK economy could affect the whole food 
supply chain, including packaging, distribution and retail 
of both fresh and processed foods. Future work should 
monitor and evaluate the population health implications 
of these potentially important changes in the UK food 
system.
In summary, post-Brexit trade policy could increase 
price and decrease intake of F&V, thus increasing CVD 
mortality in England. The UK government should there-
fore carefully consider the population health implications 
of Brexit during upcoming negotiations and post-Brexit 
planning, particularly adverse changes to food systems.
