The effect of a transition into poverty on child and maternal 
mental health: a longitudinal analysis of the UK Millennium 
Cohort Study
Sophie Wickham, Margaret Whitehead, David Taylor-Robinson*, Ben Barr*
Summary
Background Whether or not relative measures of income poverty effectively reflect children’s life chances has been the 
focus of policy debates in the UK. Although poverty is associated with poor child and maternal mental health, few 
studies have assessed the effect of moving into poverty on mental health. To inform policy, we explore the association 
between transitions into poverty and subsequent mental health among children and their mothers.
Methods In this longtitudinal analysis, we used data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a large nationally 
representative cohort of children born in the UK between Sept 1, 2000, and Jan 11, 2002, who participated in five survey 
waves as they progressed from 9 months of age to 11 years of age. Our analysis included all children and mothers who 
were free from mental health problems and not in poverty when the children were aged 3 years. We only included 
singletons (ie, not twins or other multiple pregnancies) and children for whom the mother was the main respondent 
to the study. The main outcomes were child socioemotional behavioural problems (Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire) at ages 5 years, 7 years, and 11 years and maternal psychological distress (Kessler 6 scale). Using 
discrete time-hazard models, we followed up families without mental health problems at baseline and estimated odds 
ratios for subsequent onset of maternal and child mental health problems associated with first transition into poverty, 
while adjusting for confounders, including employment transitions. We further assessed whether or not change in 
maternal mental health explained any effect on child mental health.
Findings Of the 6063 families in the UK Millennium Cohort study at 3 years who met our inclusion criteria, 844 (14%) 
had a new transition into poverty compared with 5219 (86%) who remained out of poverty. After adjustment for 
confounders, transition into poverty increased the odds of socioemotional behavioural problems in children (odds 
ratio 1·41 [95% CI 1·02–1·93]; p=0·04) and maternal psychological distress (1·44 [1·21–1·71]; p<0·0001). Controlling 
for maternal psychological distress reduced the effect of transition into poverty on socioemotional behavioural 
problems in children (1·30 [0·94–1·79]; p=0·11).
Interpretation In a contemporary UK cohort, first transition into income poverty during early childhood was associated 
with an increase in the risk of child and maternal mental health problems. These effects were independent of changes 
in employment status. Transitions to income poverty do appear to affect children’s life chances and actions that 
directly reduce income poverty of children are likely to improve child and maternal mental health.

Introduction
Child mental health is poor in the UK.1,2 Roughly one in 
eight children in the UK aged 10–15 years reported 
symptoms of mental ill health between 2011 and 2012.3 
Maternal mental health is an important determinant of 
child physical and mental health outcomes.4 Maternal 
depression and anxiety is experienced by around 10–15% 
of women in the UK and other high-income countries.5 
The public health consequences of poor mental health in 
childhood are complex and far-reaching. Poor child 
mental health is associated with absence from school, 
poor 
educational 
attainment,6 
impaired 
cognitive 
development, social isolation, low self-esteem, dis-
crimination, poor mental and physical health in 
adulthood, and a shortened lifespan.4,7,8 Child and 
subsequent adult mental health problems were estimated 
to cost £105 billion in 2009–10 in England, incorporating 
human costs, output losses, and health and social care 
costs.9
Child poverty is an important risk factor that might 
partly explain poor mental health outcomes in UK 
children.10,11 19% of children in the UK are living in 
poverty (below 60% of the national median household 
income before housing costs), and this proportion is 
projected to rise substanitally up to 2020,12 with 
200 000 additional children moving into poverty in 
2014–15.13 Findings from a systematic review14 have 
shown how socioeconomically disadvantaged children 
and adolescents were two-times to three-times more 
likely to develop mental health problems than were

non-disadvantaged children and that low socioeconomic 
status that persisted over time was strongly related to 
higher rates of mental health problems.
Very few studies have investigated the effect of 
transitions into poverty on child or adult mental health 
in particular.15–17 Authors of two systematic reviews4,18 
have suggested that improvements in household 
financial resources are associated with improved 
children’s outcomes and adult mental health. The 
studies to date that have examined poverty transitions 
have predom 
inantly been based in the USA and assessed 
specific so-called natural experiments in the reverse 
direction—ie, looking at the effect on health of 
movement of people out of poverty.15 Findings from 
these studies are not necessarily generalisable to other 
contexts outside of the USA, such as the UK, and do not 
address the question of the effect on health of moving 
into poverty.
Policy debate in the UK has focused on use of child 
poverty measures for policy purposes and on whether or 
not they meaningfully reflect children’s life chances. 
Early in 2016, the UK Government proposed replacing 
its statutory child poverty targets based on income with 
indicators of child disadvantage that were not specifically 
related to income, namely living in workless house 
holds, 
low educational attainment, family instability, and 
addiction.19 In particular, the Government has argued 
that strategies to improve children’s life chances should 
focus on an increase of parental employment rather 
than welfare cash transfers, which can reduce income 
poverty without changing employment status.19 We 
therefore assess whether or not movement into poverty 
during a child’s early life is relevant for children’s and 
mothers’ mental health, independent of any effect of 
employment status, using the UK Millennium Cohort 
Study (MCS).20 
Methods
Study design and population
In this longtitudinal analysis, we used data from the 
MCS, a large nationally representative cohort sample of 
children born in the UK between Sept 1, 2000, and 
Jan 11, 2002, who have been followed up through five 
survey waves, when the children were aged 9 months 
(wave 1), 3 years (wave 2), 5 years (wave 3), 7 years (wave 4), 
and 11 years (wave 5).21 The study oversampled children 
living in disadvantaged areas and in those with high 
proportions of ethnic minority groups by means of a 
stratified cluster sampling design. Our analysis included 
all children and mothers who were free from mental 
health problems and not in poverty when children were 
aged 3 years (wave 2), the first wave when child and 
maternal mental health data were collected. We only 
included singletons (ie, not twins or other multiple 
pregnancies) and children for whom the main respondent 
to the study was the mother to ensure reliable and 
consistent comparisons over time. This analysis did not 
require additional ethical approval.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Three previous systematic reviews have assessed the effect of 
poverty and income on child and adult mental health outcomes. 
The authors did extensive searches of databases (EconLit, the 
International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, MEDLINE, 
PsychInfo, SocIndex, the British Education Index, PubMed, 
Embase, the Social Science Citation Index, and Psyndex), 
including published and grey literature between 1988 and 2013, 
for all studies using validated measures of both income or 
financial resources and mental health. Two of the reviews 
focused on studies designed to establish a causal link between 
income and mental health. These reviews suggest a causal 
relationship between child poverty and adverse health 
outcomes. We updated the search using PubMed up to 
Oct 31, 2016, searching for articles published in English, with 
the search terms (“socioeconomic” OR “socio-economic” OR 
“disadvantage” OR “poverty” OR “social class” OR “SES” OR 
“poor” OR “deprivation”) AND (“mental health” OR “wellbeing” 
OR “well-being” OR “socioemotional” OR “socio-emotional” OR 
“behaviour*” OR “depression” OR “anxiety”). We found that 
investigators of studies to date that have examined poverty 
transitions have predominantly been based in the USA and 
assessed specific so-called natural experiments in the reverse 
direction—ie, looking at the effect on health of movement of 
people out of poverty. No studies included in these reviews or in 
our updated search have investigated the effect of transitions 
into poverty during the early life of children on their and their 
parents’ mental health.
Added value of this study
In a contemporary UK cohort, we assessed the effect on mental 
health of a first transition into poverty in a nationally 
representative sample of mothers and children who did not have 
pre-existing mental health problems and were not previously in 
poverty. First transition into income poverty was associated with 
a significant increase in the risk of child and maternal mental 
health problems. The effect of poverty on child mental health was 
partly explained by increases in maternal psychological distress.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study has strengthened the argument for a causal 
relationship between poverty and adverse mental health 
outcomes. Findings from our study indicate that predicted 
increases in child poverty in the UK and elsewhere are likely to 
negatively affect child and maternal mental health. Our findings 
reinforce the need to maintain income-based measures of child 
poverty to monitor trends and effects on health of policies that 
affect children’s lives.

Procedures
The main outcomes were child socioemotional behavioural 
problems and maternal psychological distress. We 
assessed children’s socioemotional behaviour using the 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the 
children were aged 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 11 years on 
the basis of maternal report. The SDQ is a 25 item measure 
that asks parents to rate their child’s behaviour over the 
previous 6 months using five subscales, each with 
five items: peer problems, conduct disorders, hyperactivity, 
emotional problems, and prosocial behaviour. We used the 
total difficulties score (which excludes the prosocial 
behaviour items) using validated cutoffs widely used in 
previous studies22 for which a score of 0–16 indicates 
normal to borderline behaviour and 17–40 indicates 
socioemotional behavioural problems.23 The SDQ has 
good internal consistency (Cronbach α 0·77) in the study 
sample. We used the Kessler 6 (K6) scale to identify 
psychological distress in mothers. This measure asks in 
the last month how often respondents felt depressed, 
hopeless, restless or fidgety, worthless, or that everything 
was an effort. Respondents answered on a five-point scale 
from 1 (all the time) to 5 (none of the time). We reversed 
and rescaled all items from 0 to 4 for analysis purposes, so 
that high scores indicate high levels of psychological 
distress. We used validated cutoffs, contrasting normal 
(0–5) and distress (6–24) scores.24 The K6 scale has good 
internal consistency (α 0·81) in the study sample.
The main exposure of interest was relative income 
poverty, defined as household equivalised income of less 
than 60% of national median household income 
equivalised according to the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development household equivalence 
scale (appendix pp 1–2).25 We were able to capture first 
transition into poverty by comparing children and 
mothers (who were not previously in poverty) who moved 
into poverty at ages 5 years, 7 years, or 11 years (coded 
as 1) with those who remained out of poverty (coded as 0). 
Once participants have transitioned into poverty we 
subsequently considered them to be exposed.
Statistical analysis
We considered the following baseline variables as potential 
confounding factors associated with the exposure of 
interest (poverty)26 and outcomes (child and maternal 
mental health):22 child and maternal ethnicity (white or 
non-white), child sex, age of the mother at cohort child 
birth, household setup (whether living in a single-parent 
or single-carer household or in a two-parent or two-carer 
household), and previous diagnosis of depression or 
anxiety. We included the number of children (siblings 
plus cohort child) in the household and employment 
status as potential time-varying confounders as birth of an 
additional child will affect the equivalised household 
income and might influence the mental health of the 
mother. We controlled for employment to distinguish the 
effects of transitions into income poverty from those of 
employment transitions. We modelled the duration that 
the mother and child were free from mental health 
problems on the basis of the child’s age.
We estimated discrete time hazards survival models27,28 to 
follow up families that were free of mental health problems 
at baseline (as measured by the SDQ and K6 scale) and 
investigate whether or not first transition into poverty was 
associated with onset of new mental health problems 
conditional on being free of mental health difficulties up to 
that time. Mothers and children that were free of mental 
health problems at baseline are included in the dataset 
until they either develop a mental health problem, reach 
the end of the time period of the study, or were lost to 
follow-up. Logistic regression in this context provides a 
discrete time equivalent to a continuous time survival 
model,27,28 estimating the relative risk of development of 
mental health problems associated with first transition 
into poverty (appendix p 3). Initially, we estimated survival 
curves showing the proportion of children and mothers 
remaining free of mental health problems at each wave. 
We also estimated survival curves indicating the proportion 
of children and mothers entering poverty at each wave.
We then estimated three regression models. First, we 
assessed the unadjusted relationship between first 
transition into poverty and new-onset mental health

outcomes for mothers and children separately (model 1); 
second, we included confounders in this model 
(model 2); and third, we included maternal psychological 
distress in the adjusted model to test if this attenuated 
any effect of poverty transitions on child mental health 
(model 3).29 Further statistical analysis detail is given in 
the appendix (pp 3–5). We did all analyses in Stata 
version 14. We compared the study sample characteristics 
with the total possible sample on the basis of our 
inclusion criteria.
To test the robustness of the main analysis, we repeated 
these models under different specifications: first, using 
longitudinal weights to account for attrition and 
response bias; second, excluding maternal employment 
from the model; third, lagging the exposure (poverty) by 
one wave; and fourth, using a linear random-effects 
model with continuous SDQ and K6 scale scores as 
outcomes. We further analysed the level of attrition from 
the MCS to investigate whether or not development of 
mental health problems was associated with loss to 
follow-up (appendix p 15).

Results
Of the 15 590 familes in the MCS at 3 years, 7059 (45%) 
met our inclusion criteria (figure 1). 6063 (86%) of this 
sample had complete data and the minimum number of 
two observations required for comparison and were taken 
forward for analysis. The analysis sample is broadly similar 
to the total possible inclusion sample (appendix pp 6–7). 
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the population 
stratified by first transition into poverty over the course of 
the study. All variables of interest for the analysis showed 
significant differences between those who did and did not 
have a first transition into poverty, with the exception of 
child sex. 844 (14%) children had a new transition into 
poverty compared with 5219 (86%) who remained out of 
poverty. 217 (4%) children and 888 (17%) mothers who did 
not transition into poverty experienced new onset of 
mental health problems compared with 70 (8%) children 
and 255 (30%) mothers who did transition into poverty.
Figure 2 shows survival curves for our two outcomes 
indicating the proportion of mothers and children who 
remain free of mental health problems over time. 
Alongside these curves we have plotted the proportion of 
families that remained out of poverty over time 
(exposure). Of the families with no problems at age 
3 years, 82 (1%) of 6063 had developed socioemotional 
behavioural difficulties by age 5 years, an additional 
106 (2%) had by age 7 years, and a further 99 (2%) had by 
age 11 years.  467 (8%) of 6063 mothers had developed 
psychological distress by the time their child was 5 years 
old, an additional 327 (5%) had by the time their child 
was 7 years old, and a further 349 (6%) had by the time 
their child was 11 years old. 844 (14%) of 6063 children 
had entered poverty at some point by the age of 11 years. 
These children comprised 546 (9%) who had transitioned 
into poverty by age 5 years, 261 (4%) who had by age 
7 years, and 37 (1%) who had by age 11 years.
The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for movement into 
poverty between the ages of 3 years and 11 years compared 
with remaining out of poverty on children’s socioemotional 
behavioural difficulties was 1·84 (95% CI 1·37–2·47; 
p<0·0001; table 2, figure 3). Adjustment for baseline 
confounders reduced the odds to 1·41 (1·02–1·93; p=0·04).

Male sex, young maternal age, the mother not being in 
employment, and the mother having a previous diagnosis 
of depression were associated with greater odds of child 
socioemotional behavioural difficulties. The unadjusted 
OR for movement into poverty compared with remaining 
out of poverty on maternal psychological distress was 1·84 
(1·57–2·16; 
p<0·0001). 
Adjustment 
for 
baseline 
confounders reduced the odds to 1·44 (1·21–1·71; 
p<0·0001). Non-white ethnicity, not being in employment, 
being a single carer, and having a previous diagnosis of 
depression were associated with increased odds of 
psychological distress in mothers, whereas being an older 
mother at the child’s birth and having a female child were 
protective (table 2, figure 3). Addition of maternal 
psychological distress into the model for children’s 
socioemotional behavioural difficulties rendered the 
association between transitions into poverty and child 
socioemotional behaviour non-significant and attenuated 
the OR by 27% from 1·41 (1·02–1·93; p=0·04) to 1·30 
(0·94–1·79; p=0·11; calculated as ([OR – adjusted OR]/
[OR – 1])*100).30 Maternal distress was highly associated 
with child socioemotional behavioural difficulties in this 
model (OR 4·26 [95% CI 3·27–5·55]; p<0·0001; table 2).
We tested the robustness of our estimates using 
alternative assumptions and model specifications. We 
found similar point estimates when using longitudinal 
weights to account for attrition and response bias 
(appendix p 9). When we excluded maternal employment 
from the model, effect sizes were larger (appendix p 11). 
In models estimated with the exposure (transition into 
poverty) lagged by one wave, we found that initial 
transition into poverty increased the risk of the child 
developing mental health problems in the subsequent 
wave by a similar amount as it did in the original wave 
(appendix p 13). The effect on maternal mental health in 
the subsequent wave was reduced slightly but remained 
significant. Linear models assessing the association 
between transitions into poverty and continous SDQ and 
K6 scale scores showed similar results (appendix pp 
14–15). This analysis is, however, more succeptible to 
reverse causation (mental health affecting poverty) than 
is the main analysis since we could not select out the 
population free from mental health problems in previous 
waves as in our main analysis. We explored the potential 
effect of attrition from the cohort by investigating factors 
associated with attrition from the cohort and found that 
although movement into poverty was associated with 
dropout, neither child nor maternal mental health were 
significantly associated with dropout (pp 15–16).
Discussion
Using the MCS, a contemporary dataset of UK children 
born between 2000 and 2002, we found that a first 
transition into income poverty was associated with a 
deterioration in child and maternal mental health. The 
impact on maternal mental health was large; however, 
the 95% CIs for the effect on child mental health were 
wide, indicating some uncertainty concerning the size of 
the effect on child mental health. When we adjusted for 
maternal psychological distress, the increased odds of 
child socioemotional behavioural problems associated 
with movement into poverty was reduced by about 27% 
and became non-significant. To our knowledge, this 
research is the first to assess the effect of movement into 
poverty during a child’s early years on family mental 
health problems. This research extends previous 
work,4,14,18,31,32 which has been predominantly US-focused 
and based on assessment of natural experiments in 
which populations have moved out of poverty. Our 
analysis has strengthened the argument for a causal 
relationship between poverty and adverse mental health 
outcomes using data from a longitudinal observational 
study with robust confounder adjustment.
We used a large contemporary birth cohort study, 
representative of the UK population, with rich data for 
family income, childhood circumstances, and mental 
health outcomes. Our results are likely to be generalisable 
to populations in high-income countries who have a new 
transition into poverty in the first 11 years of their child’s 
life. Our study design reduces the possibility that our 
results reflect reverse causation (ie, that mental health 
affects poverty) as we selected families without mental 
health problems at baseline and followed them up until 
the end of the study or until they developed mental 
health problems. This conclusion was strengthened in 
the lagged analysis showing similar effects of transitions 
into poverty on risk of mental health difficulties in the 
subsequent survey wave.

Missing data and attrition are ubiquitous problems in 
cohort studies. Repetition of our analysis with attrition 
weights did not alter our conclusions and our analysis of 
attrition showed that neither child nor maternal mental 
health were significantly associated with dropout, suggesting 
that this factor was unlikely to bias our results. Although 
mental health status was assessed with validated tools 
(SDQ23 and K6 scale24), they could be susceptible to reporting 
bias and shared variance. Both the K6 scale and SDQ were 
reported by mothers, and a change in the mother’s mental 
health could possibly lead them to report a deterioration in 
their child that does not reflect an objective decline in the 
child’s mental health. Studies have, however, reported good 
inter-rater agreement between parent and teacher versions 
of the SDQ, suggesting that maternal mental health does 
not have large effects on SDQ score reporting.33 Furthermore, 
measurement error affecting maternal and child mental 
health is likely to attenuate any associations. Additionally, 
employment status and number of children in the household 
might reflect how a parent responds to these questions, but 
we have adjusted for these factors in the analysis. In our 
main analysis, we used dichotomised mental health 
outcome measures with validated cutoffs, as commonly 
used in other studies, which entailed some loss of 
information.22 Nevertheless, when repeating the analysis 
using continuous scores, we found similar results.
Our primary aim was to assess the effect of a first 
transition into income poverty in the context of discussions 
in the UK about the relevance of this measure as an 
indicator of children’s life chances.34 Transitions to and 
from income poverty are a simplication of complex 
underlying income trajectories that we have not sought to 
investigate in this study. We did not have information for 
poverty status between waves and thefore our analysis 
cannot include short periods of poverty that occurred 
between waves and might only be generalisable to enduring 
periods of poverty. We were unable to investigate the effect 
of movement out of poverty (the reverse transition) as the 
sample size was insufficient for this analysis.
Mental health problems, many of which have their 
origins in childhood, are a substantial cause of morbidity 
globally, and improvement of child mental health is a 
policy priority.10 Findings from our study indicate that 
increases in child poverty in the UK are likely to 
negatively affect child and maternal mental health, 
independent of employment transitions and other 
important confounders. This finding is important in the 
UK policy context because use of income-based poverty 
measures have been the subject of debate and child 
poverty levels are predicted to rise by 50% by 2020.12,35
Receipt of tax credits in the UK, which operate below 
the 60% household income threshold, could have 
possibly minimised the fall in income experienced by 
people entering poverty during this time and declines in 
income and mental health effects could have been greater 
in the absence of this policy than with this policy. The 
Government plans to replace tax credits with a new 
benefit—Universal Credit—reducing payments to low-
income families.12 Future research should investigate 
whether or not these changes in welfare policy modify 
the relation between poverty transitions and mental 
health observed in this study.
Our findings reinforce the need to maintain an income-
based measure of child poverty and use it to monitor 
trends and the effects on health of policies that affect 
children’s lives. A switch to a non-income measure of child 
disadvantage, as proposed by the UK Government,19,36 
could hinder development of effective strategies for 
tackling child poverty and health. Policy action is needed to 
address the upstream determinants of child mental health, 
with a focus on parental income, employment,37 and high-
quality early childcare.
