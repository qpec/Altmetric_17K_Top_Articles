Aims
The efficacy of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for cryptogenic stroke has been controversial. We undertook
a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing device closure with medical therapy to prevent
recurrent stroke for patients with PFO.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We systematically identified all RCTs comparing device closure to medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke in pa-
tients with PFO. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent stroke, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The
primary safety endpoint was new onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Five studies (3440 patients) were included. In all,
1829 patients were randomized to device closure and 1611 to medical therapy. Across all patients, PFO closure
was superior to medical therapy for prevention of stroke [hazard ratio (HR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (95%
CI) 0.13–0.82; P = 0.018, I2 = 73.4%]. The risk of AF was significantly increased with device closure [risk ratio (RR)
4.68, 95% CI 2.19–10.00, P<0.001, heterogeneity I2 = 27.5%)]. In patients with large shunts, PFO closure was associ-
ated with a significant reduction in stroke (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.72; P = 0.005), whilst there was no significant
reduction in stroke in patients with a small shunt (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.60; P = 0.712). There was no effect from
the presence or absence of an atrial septal aneurysm on outcomes (P = 0.994).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In selected patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure is superior to medical therapy for the prevention of fur-
ther stroke: this is particularly true for patients with moderate-to-large shunts. Guidelines should be updated to re-
flect this.

Introduction
The incidence of stroke in the United States is approximately
800 000 per year, 30% of which are cryptogenic.1 In up to 40% of
these patients, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is present.2 In the pres-
ence of a PFO, a clot in the venous circulation can travel across the
PFO and lead to arterial occlusion; this paradoxical embolism can
lead to a stroke. Subclinical episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) could be
a further mechanism for stroke.
Observational studies have suggested an association between the
presence of PFO and cryptogenic stroke.3 Percutaneous closure of
PFOs using catheter-based systems has been available since the
1990 s. The superiority of device closure over medical therapy for
the prevention of recurrent strokes in patients with cryptogenic

stroke and a PFO has not been established. Three previously pub-
lished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not demonstrate su-
periority of device closure over medical therapy.4–6 Meta-analyses of
these trials have also not conclusively proven any significant benefit
of device closure when analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.7,8
Existing guidelines, written before recent trial data was available,
do not recommend routine closure of PFOs for patients with crypto-
genic stroke. Advisory committees have recommended restricting
the closure of PFOs to ongoing clinical trials. Nevertheless, many pa-
tients continue to be treated ‘off-label’.9
Two recent RCTs comparing PFO closure to medical therapy have
been published,10,11 along with updated long-term results from a previ-
ous RCT.12 We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of RCT data
including the most recent trials to formally evaluate the benefit of per-
cutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale after a cryptogenic stroke.
Methods
We carried out a meta-analysis of RCTs that evaluated device closure for
patients with a PFO and cryptogenic stroke.
Search strategy
We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases from October 2000
to October 2017 for all studies of PFO closure. Our search strings
included ‘(PFO or “patent foramen ovale”) AND Closure’; and ‘crypto-
genic stroke’, respectively. We also hand-searched the bibliographies of
relevant selected studies, reviews and meta-analyses to identify further
eligible studies. Abstracts were reviewed for suitability and articles ac-
cordingly retrieved. Two independent reviewers performed the search
and literature screening (Y.A. and M.S.S.), with disputes resolved by con-
sensus following discussion with a third author (S.S.).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We considered all randomized studies of PFO closure. Studies were eli-
gible if they randomized patients to device closure or medical therapy,
and reported outcome data with regards to recurrent stroke.
Observational studies were not considered.
Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent stroke and the primary
safety endpoint was risk of AF. Non-fatal and fatal ischaemic strokes were
included together as stroke in endpoint definitions across trials. We con-
sidered major bleeding as a secondary safety endpoint.
Data extraction and analysis
Two authors (Y.A. and A.A.) independently abstracted the data from
included trials, verified by a third author (J.H.). We analysed efficacy on an
intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome measure was the hazard
ratio (HR) of recurrence of stroke.
We extracted the HRs with their associated 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) and P-values. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed of
the natural logarithm of the HRs and their associated standard errors using
the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator. The standard error
was calculated by dividing the difference between the natural logarithms of
the upper and lower 95% CIs by 2� the appropriate normal score (1.96).
Where the lower 95% CI approached zero, the standard error was calcu-
lated using only the difference between the natural logarithm of the upper
95% CI and the natural logarithm of the point estimate. Interactions
between subgroups were assessed using a mixed effects meta-analytical
model, with both the trial and subgroup in question as moderators. We
used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity.13 Mean values are expressed
as mean± SD unless otherwise stated. The statistical programming envir-
onment R14 with the metafor package15 was used for all statistical analysis.
Included studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.16
Tests for publication bias would only be performed in the event of at least
10 trials being included for analysis.17
Results were reported in accordance with the PRISMA guideline.18
Subgroups
We specified the size of shunt and presence of an aneurysmal atrial sep-
tum as subgroup analyses. The definition of small shunt, where stated,
was less than 10 microbubbles seen in the left atrium on bubble study in
all trials. The definition of substantial/large shunt varied, where stated.
Therefore, we compared moderate-large shunt to small shunt.
Results
Five studies,4,6,10–12 enrolling 3440 patients met the inclusion criteria
(Figure 1). In all, 1829 patients were randomized to device closure
and 1611 to medical therapy, with a weighted mean follow-up of
4.01 years in the device group and 4.07 years in the medical therapy
group. Across the five studies, the mean age was 44.9 years. The full
characteristics of included studies are shown in Table 1. All trials en-
rolled patients with a prior ischaemic stroke and no identifiable cause
apart from a PFO; three specified within the prior 6 months and one
within the prior 9 months, with one trial not specifying a timescale.
The primary endpoint varied across trials including ischaemic stroke
in one trial, and various composites of stroke, transient ischaemic at-
tack, and peripheral embolism in other trials (see Table 1). The defin-
ition of stroke across all trials was typically an acute focal neurological
event that is positive on neuroimaging, or lasting greater than 24h
without neuroimaging. One trial mandated magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) as the imaging modality whereas the remainder allowed
computed tomography (CT) or MRI. Two trials used the Amplatzer
device, one the Gore sepal occluder, one the Starflex device (which
is no longer available) and one trial used multiple device types. In
terms of medical therapy, one trial left this open to physician discre-
tion (specifying at least one agent); one allowed warfarin, aspirin, or
both; and the remaining three trials allowed combinations of aspirin,
clopidogrel, dipyridamole, or anticoagulation (see Table 1).
Trial quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and
is shown in Table 2. All five trials were conducted with bias-resistant
features such as randomization and reporting of all pre-specified out-
comes. Each trial was specified to be open-label so there was no
blinding of patients. Three trials (CLOSE, CLOSURE, and REDUCE)
did not specify independent, blinded adjudication of clinical events
and, as such, were judged to be of intermediate quality since blinded
assessment of outcomes is the most important potential bias in trials
where the primary endpoint is often a physician-determined clinical
syndrome. The remaining two trials (PC and RESPECT) specifically
reported independent adjudication of clinical events by assessors
unaware of treatment allocation. They were judged to be of high
quality.

Efficacy of closure vs. medical therapy
Closure of PFO resulted in a significant reduction in recurrent stroke
(Figure 2; HR 0.32 95% CI 0.13–0.82; P = 0.018), though with signifi-
cant heterogeneity (I2 = 73.4%). Across all trials, 37 of 1829 patients
had a recurrence of stroke in the active arms, compared with 72 of
1611 in the control arms. Overall, the annual weighted risk of recur-
rent stroke was low in both in the closure (0.61%) and the medical
therapy (1.17%) group.
Safety of closure vs. medical therapy
Device closure significantly increased the risk of AF (Figure 3; risk
ratio (RR) 4.68, 95% CI 2.19–10.00, P<0.001, heterogeneity
I2 = 27.5%). Across all trials, 76 of 1784 patients had a recurrence of
stroke in the active arms, compared with 12 in the control arms.
Overall, the annual weighted risk of AF was low (1.38% per year in
the device arm and 0.21% per year in the control arm).
Across the four studies which reported major bleeding in both the
device and control arms, there was no significant difference between
the groups (Figure 4, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33–2.09; P = 0.691, hetero-
geneity I2 = 41.8%).
Procedural-related events were low across the five trials, occur-
ring in 3.2% of patients in CLOSURE-1, 5.9% in CLOSE, 2.5% in
REDUCE, 1.5% in PC, and 2.4% of RESPECT.
Impact of shunt size and atrial septal
aneurysm
Three trials reported outcomes stratified by shunt size and presence
of an atrial septal aneurysm (CLOSURE I, PC, and RESPECT). The
CLOSE trial only enrolled patients with either a large shunt or an
atrial septal defect (ASD) and therefore there was no appropriate
comparator group for either variable.
In patients with a large shunt, PFO closure was associated with a
significant reduction in stroke (Figure 5; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.72;
P = 0.005), whilst there was no significant reduction in stroke in pa-
tients with a small shunt (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.60; P = 0.712).
Across all trials, 7 of 478 patients with a large shunt had a recurrent

stroke in the active arm, compared with 13 of 275 patients with a
large shunt in the control arms. In patients with large shunts the an-
nual risk of stroke was 0.53% in patients undergoing PFO closure and
1.56% in those treated medically. There was a statistically significant p
value for interaction between shunt category and the risk of recur-
rent stroke (P = 0.031).
There was no effect from the presence or absence of an atrial sep-
tal aneurysm on outcomes (see Figure 6).
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis excluding the CLOSURE-1 trial (which used the
Starflex device which is no longer used in clinical practice) showed
similar results to the primary analyses for efficacy and safety (see
Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2).
We also performed a full jack-knife analysis excluding each trial in
turn, for both the primary efficacy and primary safety outcomes. The
results are shown in Supplementary material online, Figures S3–S10.
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that: (i) the risk of recurrent stroke is
low in RCTs for patients with PFO who have suffered a cryptogenic
stroke (annual risk of 1.16% in patients treated with medical therapy
in trials); (ii) this risk can be reduced by two-thirds by device closure
of a PFO in addition to medical therapy (HR 0.32 with device closure,
95% CI 0.13–0.82; P = 0.018); (iii) the benefit from PFO closure de-
pends on shunt size (P = 0.031), with patients with large shunts bene-
fitting from device closure (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.72; P = 0.005), in
contrast to those with small shunts (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.60;
P = 0.712); (iv) there is no impact of the presence or absence of an
aneurysmal atrial septum on outcomes with device closure; and (v)
AF is rare but significantly increased with device closure vs. medical
therapy (annual risk 1.38% in device arm, RR 4.68, 95% CI 2.19–
10.00, P<0.001 with device closure).
Superiority of device closure to medical
therapy
Previous RCTs and meta-analyses have failed to show the superiority
of device closure to medical therapy for the prevention of stroke in
patients with a PFO. With the publication of two new RCTs, we have
robust data to show that device closure is associated with a significant
reduction in recurrent stroke. Furthermore, we now have data to
support PFO closure with multiple device types (previously the only
positive data was for the Amplatzer device). Our primary analysis,
which included all RCTs published in this field, showed clear super-
iority of PFO closure; this was reinforced in a sensitivity analysis
excluding the CLOSURE-1 trial which used the now defunct Starflex
device, where the margins of superiority for stroke prevention were
greater and the margins of inferiority for risk of AF were smaller.
The significance of PFO in the aetiology of cryptogenic stroke has
been debated.19,20 This analysis demonstrates that interventional
strategies can significantly reduce risk of recurrent stroke and sup-
ports the underlying mechanistic plausibility for causation of stroke
via paradoxical embolism. With this combination of factors, we can
now state that, in selected patients with a cryptogenic stroke and a
PFO, device closure reduces future events.

The benefit from patent foramen ovale
closure depends on shunt size
Given the suspicion that larger shunt sizes could be associated with
a higher risk of paradoxical flow and hence stroke, several trials
in this meta-analysis provided HRs stratified by shunt size. This
meta-analysis reveals a statistically significant interaction between
shunt size and the reduction in hazard of stroke (P = 0.031).
Therefore, shunt size should be considered in our clinical decision-
making when evaluating patients for potential device closure.
Conversely, this analysis did not show a statistically significant inter-
action between the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm and the re-
duction in the hazard of stroke (P = 0.994). This may be because in
patients with an aneurysmal septum it is harder to achieve complete
closure of the defect with device therapy. These associations require
further investigation.
Magnitude of benefit
For all patients included in this analysis, the absolute risk reduction
per year with device closure over medical therapy is 0.56, translating
to a number needed to treat of 178 when dichotomized over this
short-term basis. When considering patients with large shunts, the
number needed to treat to prevent one stroke in 1 year is 96.
This may appear a large number to recommend adoption of this
procedure, but PFO closure is a single intervention with a low rate of
complications. Furthermore, patients consider a stroke a worse out-
come than death,21 and the patients enrolled in these trials—and
who should be considered for device therapy in clinical practice—
will be young and all have made a good recovery from their index
stroke. Finally, this number needed to treat quoted is per year. Given
the Kaplan–Meier plots in the analysed trials demonstrate propor-
tional hazards it is likely valid to assume the reduced risk of stroke
will continue beyond the follow-up times analysed in the trials.
Therefore, the number needed to treat at a single time-point does
not reflect the large number of disease-free life years that will be
gained from device closure.
Guidelines
Current guideline recommendations are against device closure for
patients with a PFO and cryptogenic stroke. The most contemporary
guidance, from the American Academy of Neurology in 2016,22
states that ‘clinicians should not routinely offer percutaneous PFO
closure to patients with cryptogenic ischaemic stroke outside of a re-
search setting’. Joint guidance from the American Heart Association
and American Stroke Association in 201423 also did not endorse de-
vice closure, while The American College of Chest Physicians gave a
Class II recommendation24 only in patients who experience recur-
rent events despite aspirin therapy. All existing guideline recommen-
dations are summarized in Table 3.
The results of this meta-analysis should inform an update in the
guideline recommendations and suggest that in patients with large
shunts the recommendation for device closure is strong.
Implications for clinical research
In 2009, the ACC/AHA and ASA published a statement docu-
ment25,26 calling for ‘the completion of randomized clinical trials’
studying device closure of PFOs for secondary stroke prevention.

The context of this statement was the slow recruitment and high
drop-out rates observed in RCTs. Factors underpinning this may in-
clude a reluctance from clinicians to randomize their patients owing
to belief in the effectiveness of device closure; young patients who
had suffered a stroke also felt committed to choosing their own
treatment rather than having it left to chance. This led to increasing
off-label use of closure devices and the aforementioned difficulty in
completing RCTs in a timely manner, with increased drop-out rates
observed in the medical therapy groups compared to the device
groups. Furthermore, the expected event rates in the medical
therapy arm used to power earlier studies were generally double
the event rates observed in the trials. This combination of factors

perhaps goes some way towards explaining the negative results re-
ported in earlier RCTs of PFO closure. During the time-windows of
all RCTs reported in this analysis, 20 times as many patients under-
went device closure outside a trial setting than within it.
If clinicians and patients were more willing to participate in
randomized trials, the answer shown by the more contemporary
RCTs—and this meta-analysis—may have been available many
years ago. This would have led to an earlier adoption of an
efficacious
herapy,
with
consequent
benefits
to
patients.
Furthermore, it could have prevented expending research re-
sources answering a question which might have been resolved
much earlier.

Limitations
Two recent abbreviated analyses have been published as Letters show-
ing benefit of PFO closure.26,27 Our analysis provides additional insights
in several regards. First, we have used HR rather than RR as our primary
endpoint, which is more appropriate for time-to-event data. Secondly,
we have performed sensitivity analyses examining the effect of each indi-
vidual trial on both the overall results and the heterogeneity. Thirdly, we
have performed subgroup analyses for the effect of large shunts and the
presence of an aneurysmal atrial septum. Finally, we have reported add-
itional safety endpoints for bleeding and device complications.
We could only report the available data, and cannot account for
unpublished trials. There were differences in methodology and re-
porting across the studies. Follow-up duration varied across the stud-
ies, and there were differences in the entry criteria and primary
endpoints. The definitions of clinical events and subgroups (including
shunt size) were not uniform across trials, but this problem is com-
mon to all meta-analyses. Clinical researchers should endeavour to
standardize definitions of events and subgroups across trials to better
permit synthesis of their results.
The variations in endpoint definitions likely contributed to the het-
erogeneity observed in results for the primary outcome. REDUCE
and RESPECT shared eligibility criteria with regard to thrombo-
embolism: including patients with cryptogenic ischaemic strokes with
a requirement for CT or MR infarct if the symptoms lasted for less
than 24 h and explicitly excluding lacunar strokes. Their definitions of
the stroke endpoint were also identical to each other: stroke with re-
quirement for CT or MR infarct if symptoms lasted less than 24 h.
The inclusion criteria and endpoint stroke definition for CLOSE were
similar, except there was no explicit mention of excluding lacunar
strokes. CLOSURE included the same patients but also included pa-
tients whose symptoms lasted less than 24h without evidence of in-
farct but the stroke endpoint definition excluded such events
(transient ischaemic attack was only included if there was an associ-
ated radiological infarct, as for CLOSE, REDUCE, and RESPECT).
Lacunar strokes were not explicitly excluded. PC included the same
population as CLOSE, REDUCE, and RESPECT but also included pa-
tients with peripheral thromboembolism and did not explicitly ex-
clude lacunar strokes. However, the stroke endpoint in PC excluded
any event lasting less than 24h, regardless of the presence of radio-
logical infarct (these were considered to be TIAs). As such, the more
lenient criteria of CLOSURE may have resulted in a lower risk status
of patients in this trial, including TIAs without radiological infract and
potentially including lacunar strokes. The stricter stroke definition in
PC may have reduced its event rate for this endpoint.
Furthermore, there was variation in the type of device used for
PFO closure, and one included trial used a device that is no longer in
clinical use; our sensitivity analysis, however, showed the results
were similar whether or not we included this trial.
Medical therapy was also not uniform across studies, with some
using antiplatelet therapy (which could be aspirin, dipyridamole, or
clopidogrel in various combinations), and others anticoagulant ther-
apy. These differences may explain the significant heterogeneity seen
between trials assessing the hazard of stroke following PFO closure
(I2 = 73.4%, P = 0.02).
During stepwise omission of each trial, heterogeneity reduced
with the omission of CLOSE (46.8%), CLOSURE I (65.3%), and
RESPECT (74.6%), but increased with the omission of PC (82.3%)
and REDUCE (81.2%). This heterogeneity was most heavily influ-
enced by the CLOSE trial, which was the most strongly in favour of
device closure. Potential reasons for this are that only patients with a
large shunt or aneurysmal atrial septum were included; the require-
ment of confirmation of cerebral infarction on neuroimaging as part
of the definition of stroke; or the fact that enrolled patients had a
very low burden of vascular risk factors. Importantly, in the sensitivity
analysis excluding the CLOSE trial there was still a statistically signifi-
cant benefit of device closure (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.91; P = 0.025).
Future trials may wish to investigate the role of new oral anti-
coagulants in this setting rather than antiplatelet therapy. However,
we note that the recent NAVIGATE-ESUS trial, comparing aspirin to
rivaroxaban for secondary prevention of stroke and systemic embol-
ism, was stopped early due to futility: there was no difference in effi-
cacy between the two groups, and an excess of bleeding with
rivaroxaban. Therefore, antiplatelet therapy is currently the more ap-
propriate comparator to device therapy for these patients.
Conclusions
In selected patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure is superior
to medical therapy for the prevention of further stroke: this is par-
ticularly true for patients with moderate-to-large shunts. Guidelines
should be updated to reflect this.
