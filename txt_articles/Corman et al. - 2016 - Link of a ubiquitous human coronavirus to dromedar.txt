The four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are globally endemic respiratory
pathogens. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus
(CoV) is an emerging CoV with a known zoonotic source in dromedary
camels. Little is known about the origins of endemic HCoVs. Studying
these viruses’ evolutionary history could provide important insight into
CoV emergence. In tests of MERS-CoV–infected dromedaries, we found
viruses related to an HCoV, known as HCoV-229E, in 5.6% of 1,033
animals. Human- and dromedary-derived viruses are each monophy-
letic, suggesting ecological isolation. One gene of dromedary viruses
exists in two versions in camels, full length and deleted, whereas only
the deleted version exists in humans. The deletion increased in size
over a succession starting from camelid viruses via old human viruses
to contemporary human viruses. Live isolates of dromedary 229E
viruses were obtained and studied to assess human infection risks.
The viruses used the human entry receptor aminopeptidase N and
replicated in human hepatoma cells, suggesting a principal ability to
cause human infections. However, inefficient replication in several
mucosa-derived cell lines and airway epithelial cultures suggested lack
of adaptation to the human host. Dromedary viruses were as sensitive
to the human type I interferon response as HCoV-229E. Antibodies in
human sera neutralized dromedary-derived viruses, suggesting popu-
lation immunity against dromedary viruses. Although no current epi-
demic risk seems to emanate from these viruses, evolutionary inference
suggests that the endemic human virus HCoV-229E may constitute a
descendant of camelid-associated viruses. HCoV-229E evolution pro-
vides a scenario for MERS-CoV emergence.

C
oronaviruses (CoVs) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae,
subfamily Coronavirinae) are enveloped viruses with a large
positive-strand RNA genome that infect a broad range of verte-
brates, including mammals (1). Four human CoVs (HCoV-HKU1,
HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) are globally en-
demic, causing mild to moderate respiratory tract disease. Two
novel CoVs have emerged in humans during the past decade,
causing outbreaks with high case fatality proportions. The severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV is thought to have been
acquired by humans from carnivores, which, in turn, acquired the
virus from rhinolophid bats (1–4). SARS-CoV is considered
eradicated but SARS-related viruses carried by bats may still pose
risks of human infection (5). The other emerging CoV, termed the
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, is acquired as a
zoonotic disease from dromedary camels, and is thought to have
ancient ancestors in Old World vespertilionid bats (6–9).
Studying the origins of endemic HCoVs may provide retro-
spective insight into CoV emergence. Little is known about the
ecological history of these ubiquitous human pathogens. How-
ever, the similarity of HCoV-OC43 to the bovine CoV suggests a
primordial zoonotic acquisition from cattle (10, 11). No obvious
intermediary hosts are known for the other HCoVs.
The human common cold agent HCoV-229E is an alpha-CoV
that was first isolated in 1967 and has been circulating in the
human population for long time with little sequence variation
(12). We have recently discovered and characterized several
groups of related alpha-CoVs in African bats of the genus Hip-
posideros, sharing ancient common ancestors with HCoV-229E
(13, 14). Crossley et al. (15, 16) isolated a virus similar to HCoV-
229E from a single captive alpaca (Vicugna pacos) that had died
in a limited outbreak of respiratory disease among farmed alpacas
in California. The biogeographic origin of this alpaca-derived co-
ronavirus (ACoV) has remained unclear, because the virus has
never been observed in feral alpacas and has only occurred from
October to December 2007 in farmed alpacas linked to a single
trade show in Monterey, California. Because alpacas are New
World camelids, the ecological connection to ancestral viruses
carried in Old World bats is difficult to explain (14).
In the context of several studies on MERS-CoV, we took sam-
ples from dromedary camels on the Arabian Peninsula and Africa
(17–19). Screening of these samples by generic CoV RT-PCR
Significance
Our results raise a scenario for the natural history of a ubiquitous
respiratory coronavirus (CoV) that has established itself in humans
after it was likely acquired from camels. This scenario reminds us
of the pandemic potential of the Middle East respiratory syndrome
CoV, an agent that is thought to be acquired from camels without
presently causing sustained human-to-human transmission.

 yielded initial evidence for diverse HCoV-229E–related viruses in
dromedary camels. Similar sequences have meanwhile been found
by other authors (20). Here, we provide a temporally, geographi-
cally, and genetically comprehensive study of dromedary-associated
229E viruses with the aim to clarify origins of HCoV-229E. Live
viruses were isolated and virologically studied to provide an esti-
mate of human infection and epidemic risks.
Results
HCoV-229E–Related CoVs Are Endemic in Arabian and African Camels.
For a targeted screening by RT-PCR, nasal swabs were obtained
during 2014–2015 from 1,033 dromedary camels in the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Kenya. All specimens were tested for
HCoV-229E–related CoVs by a real-time RT-PCR assay capable of
detecting HCoV-229E, ACoV, and genetically distant 229E-related
bat CoVs (14). The RNA detection rate in dromedaries was similar
in sampling sites [4.0% in KSA, 6.7% in Kenya (χ2, P = 0.06)]. Mean
virus concentration in respiratory specimens was 3.1 × 107
(range: 1.6 × 103–7.2 × 108) copies per milliliter of swab suspension.
Fecal samples from 387 Arabian dromedaries were tested, all with
negative results. Exact age information was available for 272 ani-
mals. RT-PCR–positive animals (n = 16, mean age = 4 mo, range:
1–24 mo) were significantly younger than RT-PCR–negative animals
(n = 246, mean age = 23 mo, range: 0–108 mo; t test, P < 0.001).
To investigate the temporal and geographic range of HCoV-
229E–related CoV in dromedaries, we tested 364 sera sampled
during 1983–2014 in six different countries on the Arabian
Peninsula and in Africa for antibodies by an indirect immuno-
fluorescence assay (IFA) (Table 1). The oldest antibody-positive
sera had been taken in 1997. Older sera from Sudan and Somalia
that had previously been tested positive for MERS-CoV did not
show antibodies against HCoV-229E–related CoV (18). The
seroprevalence in dromedary camels from the Arabian Peninsula
was significantly higher than in samples taken during the same time
in Kenya (86.3% vs. 16.0%; χ2, P < 0.001), and was also higher than
the average of all positive-testing sample collections from Africa
(86.3% vs. 25.8%; χ2, P < 0.001). Younger animals had lower
seroprevalence rates compared to older animals (Kenya: 6.6% vs.
33% in 15 calves and 15 adults tested; KSA: 66% vs. 73% in 39
calves and 15 adults tested).
Because HCoVs can sometimes occur as coinfections, all 58
dromedaries testing positive for HCoV-229E–related CoV were
tested additionally for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR (21).
Two dromedaries from KSA tested positive for both CoVs (3.5%),
demonstrating that coinfection with these CoVs is possible.
Isolation of HCoV-229E–Related CoV from Dromedaries in Cell Culture.
Because samples from Kenya had been stored in denaturing
preservation buffer, virus isolation was only attempted on fresh
specimens from KSA. RT-PCR–positive samples were inoculated
on human hepatoma (HuH-7), VeroE6 (monkey kidney), Caco-2
(human colon carcinoma), Caki-3 (dromedary kidney), HEF (pri-
mary human esophageal fibroblast), and LGK-1-R.B (alpaca
kidney) cells, followed by daily microscopic inspection for cyto-
pathic effects (CPEs). Four of 17 samples produced a CPE 2–3 d
postinoculation on HuH-7 and Caki-3 cells. CPE formation and
complete cell death were consistently observed 1 d earlier on
Caki-3 cells than on HuH-7 cells. Isolation was successful down
to viral RNA concentrations of ca. 1 × 106 copies per milliliter,
which is comparable to results obtained for MERS-CoV iso-
lation (22) (Fig. S1). Virus growth in cell culture is described in
more detail in Fig. S2.
Serum Antibodies Do Not Prevent Virus Infection. Because drome-
daries can be infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of high
antibody titers in sera (23), all sera from dromedaries yielding
virus isolates were tested by IFA using HEK-293 cells that express
the HCoV-229E spike protein from a eukaryotic expression plasmid.
All but one serum sample showed high end-point titers against
the HCoV-229E spike protein (range: 1:800–1:3,200) that did not
interfere with successful virus isolation in cell culture, suggesting
similarities between MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E–related viruses
in dromedaries (Table S1).
Genomic and Phylogenetic Comparison of Bat-, Dromedary-, and Human-
Derived 229E-Related CoVs. The full genomes of five HCoV-229E–
related dromedary CoVs (four from KSA and one from Kenya), as
well as a contemporary primary cell culture isolate taken from one
of the authors (I.E.) during an episode of acute rhinitis in 2015
(designated HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015), were determined by
combined next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing
approaches. Full-genome alignments included all major genetic
lineages of HCoV-229E–related bat CoVs (14) and ACoV (15, 16).
Human viruses included strains isolated 46 y ago (reference strain
inf-1), 23 y ago (strain USA/993-50/1993), 6 y ago (strain 0349/
NED/2010), and 1 y ago (HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015).
The dromedary viruses differed from ACoV by 1.2% and from
HCoV-229E by 7.8–8.7% of their genomic sequence, which was
consistent with these viruses forming part of the same CoV species
(14). Within dromedaries, HCoV-229E–related CoVs from Kenya
differed by 1.4% from viruses found in KSA. Of note, while this
study was finalized, Sabir et al. (20) presented a study on MERS-
CoV in dromedaries from KSA, wherein HCoV-229E–related
sequences were observed but not virologically characterized.
All sequences presented in that study fell within the diversity of
novel HCoV-229E–related viruses described here. The most mu-
tually distant viruses from Sabir et al. (20) are included in Fig. 1A.
In phylogeny, all dromedary- and human-associated viruses
clustered with high statistical support, sharing a common ancestor
with one of the three known phylogenetic lineages of bat-associated
viruses (Fig. 1A). Camelid- and human-associated viruses fell into
two well-supported clades. The Kenyan dromedary virus clustered
in a basal sister relationship to all Arabian viruses. This result
suggests a phylogenetic history similar to the history of MERS-CoV,
in whose phylogeny the deepest nodes can be projected to African
dromedaries, whereas higher nodes are projected to dromedaries
on the Arabian Peninsula (8, 14, 24, 25). The alpaca-associated virus
fell within the known diversity of dromedary viruses, consistent with
a viral spillover from dromedary camels to Alpacas, potentially in a
husbandry context as hypothesized earlier (14). Within the HCoVs,
the tree topology reflected the different times of isolation of viral
strains, with older viruses branching from older nodes, suggesting
a correct representation of the evolutionary process by the ap-
plied phylogenetic algorithm.
A schematic representation of dromedary-associated 229E-
related CoVs is shown in Fig. 1B. We have shown previously that
229E-related CoVs from bats have an additional ORF8 com-
pared with HCoV-229E (14). An intact ORF8 was found in all
HCoV-229E–related dromedary viruses sequenced in this study,
except the Kenyan virus, which is phylogenetically distinct from
Table 1.

 Arabian viruses and contains a small in-frame deletion (I in Fig. 1 C
and D, details are provided in Fig. S3). At this position (I), the
alpaca-associated virus shows a slightly larger deletion that is further
extended in size in the human viruses (Fig. 1C). A parsimonious
model for the acquisition of the deletion suggests that the initial
deletion event occurred in a virus lineage that was ancestral to
HCoV-229E, the alpaca virus, and the Kenyan virus (Fig. 1D). The
Arabian viruses might stem from another part of the pool of African
viruses wherein ORF8 is intact. Expression of an ORF8 was dem-
onstrated by RT-PCR and sequencing of a typical subgenomic RNA
(sgRNA) with fused message leader and body elements (Fig. S4).
Three other ORF8 deletions are only present in human viruses
and may have occurred de novo in humans, because they were
enlarged in plausible chronological sequence via older to con-
temporary human strains (Fig. 1D). A putatively recent timing of
the spillover of ACoV from dromedaries into captive alpacas is
consistent with the presence of the largest of all ORF8 deletions
among camelid viruses in ACoV.
The spike protein S1 domains of all camelid-associated viruses
were similar to those domains in human viruses, and contained
deletions as opposed to bat viruses (14). According to phylogeny,
the deletion would have occurred in a common ancestor to all
dromedary and human viruses (Fig. 1B).
The nucleocapsid genes of HCoV-229E–related CoVs differ
per host and geographic region in a pattern that suggests African
and Arabian virus lineages to have been in isolation from each
other, as well as from human viruses, for a considerable time
(Fig. S5).
Dromedary-Derived Viruses Use the HCoV-229E Entry Receptor. Viral
receptor use is a major barrier against cross-host transmission.
The exact receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-229E is
unknown (26–28), but its location can be mapped to the C terminus
of the spike S1 subunit. As shown in Fig. 1D, camelid viruses are
highly similar to human HCoV-229E strains in this genomic region
(five to seven different sites, 94.7–96.2% identity).
The receptor for HCoV-229E is human aminopeptidase N
(hAPN). A comparison of human, dromedary, feline, and por-
cine aminopeptidase N (APN) sequences yielded no immediate
insights into receptor compatibility, except that the degree of
sequence identity was highest between hAPN and dromedary
APN (Fig. S6). The putative spike-interacting domain was not
conserved between human and dromedary APN genes. To assess
the ability of the dromedary-related viruses to use the HCoV-
229E receptor functionally, infection experiments with HEK-293
cells expressing hAPN were conducted. In contrast to unmodified
HEK-293 cells, which were susceptible to neither HCoV-229E nor
the dromedary-derived viruses, HEK-293-hAPN cells enabled rep-
lication of HCoV-229E and dromedary viruses, demonstrating that
both viruses use hAPN (Fig. 2A). To confirm these findings, we
infected HuH-7 cells in presence of a polyclonal hAPN antibody to
block the RBD on the cell surface. Infection with both tested
HCoV-229E–related dromedary viruses was inhibited by hAPN an-
tibodies, whereas untreated cells showed virus replication (Fig. 2B).
Dromedary-Derived Viruses Are Sensitive to the Interferon Response
in Human Cells. In addition to receptor-mediated cell entry, the
type I interferon (IFN) response may constitute an important bar-
rier against human infection with HCoV-229E–related camel CoV.
In HuH-7 cells pretreated with pan-species IFN at low (100 IU/mL)
and high (1,000 IU/mL) concentrations, all tested viruses showed
reduced production of viral RNA in comparison to untreated cells
(Fig. 2C). The cell culture-adapted strain HCoV-229E inf-1 showed
the strongest suppression of replication compared with the con-
temporary HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015 and both dromedary-
derived viruses. Greatest inhibition by IFN pretreatment was
observed for all viruses 24 h postinfection (hpi). After high IFN dose
preincubation, the dromedary viruses were inhibited ca. 50-fold
and the wild-type human virus HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015 was
inhibited ca. 80-fold, which we do not consider a significant dif-
ference (Fig. 2C). By 48 hpi, the human virus had recovered its
replication level in cells pretreated with even high IFN concen-
tration, whereas replication of both dromedary viruses was still
reduced by up to 15-fold after pretreatment with high IFN doses.
Dromedary-Derived Viruses Do Not Replicate Efficiently in Cell Culture
Surrogates of Mucosal Infection. Because permanent cell cultures show
differences and defects in organ-specific gene expression, we con-
ducted replication experiments in cell cultures derived from mucosal
tissues: Caco-2 cells from human colon carcinoma, as well as A549
cells derived from human lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we used
polarized human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures derived from
primary lung cells whose phenotype is maintained in such a way that

 cilial and mucus-producing functions are recovered in an in vitro
mucosal model. HAE, Caco-2, and A549 cells are known to be
susceptible to infection with HCoV-229E inf-1. Infection experiments
were conducted with the dromedary-derived viruses and HCoV-
229E, using high virus concentrations (multiplicity of infection = 0.1).
For HAE cells, we used increasing virus infection doses up to 50,000
plaque-forming units and assessed different growth temperatures,
resembling the temperatures in the upper and lower airways. Al-
though HCoV-229E replicated efficiently, none of the dromedary-
associated viruses replicated in any of the used culture models (Fig. 3
A and B). To begin to understand the nature of the replication block,
the intracellular occurrence of sgRNA transcripts was tested by RT-
PCR (Fig. 3 C and D). In A549 cells and HAE cultures, sgRNA was
transcribed by all viruses, suggesting that replication was not pre-
vented in the stage of viral entry and initial stages of replication.
Dromedary-Derived Viruses Are Neutralized in Vitro by Human Anti–
HCoV-229E Serum Antibodies. To assess the capability of human
antibodies to neutralize the HCoV-229E–related dromedary viruses,
a microneutralization assay was established. Human neutralizing
antibody titers against HCoV-229E are known to be very low in
general (29). We screened our serum archive for human sera that
had measurable neutralization titers against HCoV-229E. Among
96 antibody-positive sera, eight were identified that were able to
neutralize HCoV-229E at titers of at least 1:20, which, according to
our experience and according to Miyazaki et al. (29), is considered a
high neutralizing titer against HCoV-299E. Three of these sera
neutralized infection by the dromedary-derived 229E CoVs ACN4
and JCN50 at measurable titers of at least 1:10, consistent with a
close antigenic relatedness of HCoV-229E and dromedary-derived
229E CoVs (Table S2).
Discussion
Here, we characterize a diverse group of alpha-CoVs related to
HCoV-229E with regard to evolution, history of host associa-
tions, and potential to cause infections in the human system.
The presence of 229E antibodies in dromedaries over a large
geographic area suggests widespread and long-established viral
circulation. This observation matches the greater genetic diversity
of dromedary-associated viruses compared with human viruses.
Seroprevalence rates were generally lower in Africa as opposed
to the Arabian Peninsula, pointing at population density effects
associated with intense husbandry in Arabia. The absence of anti-
bodies in older samples taken in 1983 and 1984 should not be
regarded as evidence against the presence of the virus in drome-
daries at that time, because the size and geographic coverage of
these samples were limited. The density and connectivity of

 African flocks sampled in 19983/1984 may have been too low to
ensure widespread infection.
Comprehensive assessment of genetic diversity provides new
implications regarding the putative evolutionary history of HCoV-
229E. Camelid-associated viruses are likely to have diverged from a
larger viral diversity in bats as shown previously (14). The habitat
ranges of the involved bat species suggest a geographic origin on
the African continent (8, 9, 13, 14). Because camels were not in-
troduced to Africa earlier than 5,000 y ago (30), the acquisition and
zoonotic spillover to camels would have taken place after this time,
providing an important biogeographic reference for studies of the
evolution of human CoVs. Emergence of these viruses in camelids
would have coincided with a deletion in the spike S1 subunit.
Because human- and camelid-associated viruses are monophyletic,
phylogeny does not allow differentiation between an ancient ac-
quisition of human viruses from camelids and an acquisition by
both hosts from a common source (e.g., bats). However, the ORF8
gene of HCoV-229E–related CoVs from African dromedaries
contains a signature deletion around nucleotide positions 27–38
that reoccurs in an enlarged version in all human viruses. It also
occurs in an enlarged version in ACoV. Whereas human viruses
carry only the deleted version, dromedary viruses contain at least
two different ORF8 versions (full and deleted). Among the pos-
sible explanations, it seems most likely that the ancestral human
virus would have been sampled from a larger viral diversity existing
in camelids. The transmission may or may not have involved ad-
ditional hosts. Two alternative hypotheses for this gene’s derivation
in human viruses can largely be excluded. First, a direct acquisition
from a bat reservoir is unlikely because ORF8 genes with the sig-
nature deletion have not been found in bats. Second, acquisition of
a deleted ORF8 gene from camelid viruses at a later point is largely
excluded by the monophyly and chronologically ordered internal
branching of human viruses, suggesting ecological isolation and
absence of opportunities for recombination. The gradual expansion
of the ORF8 signature deletion in human viruses and the acqui-
sition of additional ORF8 deletions are ongoing from old through
recent isolates, suggesting a host transition that is not ancient and
still involves genetic change. Of note, a gradual deletion of an
accessory gene of unknown function was also observed for the
SARS-CoV after transition to humans during the middle and late
phases of the SARS epidemic (31).
It remains to be determined whether the loss of gene function in
SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E has involved an attenuation of
pathogenicity during circulation in humans. As a general concept, it
has been hypothesized that viruses that are long associated with
their hosts develop an attenuated pathogenicity during adaptation
(32). In dromedary camels, the MERS-CoV seems to cause no or
only mild disease (33–36). In the present study, all samples were
collected from healthy-looking animals, suggesting low pathoge-
nicity in camels for HCoV-229E–related viruses as well. Also, other
aspects, such as the higher rate of infection in calves versus adult
animals, point to an infection pattern similar to MERS-CoV. The
observation of severe respiratory disease and abortion in alpacas
from which ACoV was originally isolated could reflect a lack of
adaptation to alpacas (15, 16). Because ACoV was observed only in
one spatiotemporally restricted outbreak and not in feral alpacas, it
seems possible that alpacas acquired the virus in captivity (e.g., in
husbandry together with dromedary camels). Experimental in-
fection studies will be necessary to understand the symptoms
caused by 229E infection in camelids and alpacas better.
Considering the high infection prevalence, as well as the high
virus concentrations in the dromedary respiratory tract, it appears
likely that humans in Africa and the Middle East are frequently
exposed to HCoV-229E–related dromedary viruses. The observed
virus concentrations are in the same range as concentrations ob-
served for MERS-CoV (33, 37), which should suffice to infect hu-
mans. Because 229E viruses endemic in humans and dromedaries
are distinct on the genome level, discriminative molecular and se-
rological markers might enable epidemiological laboratory studies
to confirm or exclude the sporadic acquisition of HCoV-229E–
related dromedary viruses by humans. ORF8 and the nucleo-
capsid gene may constitute appropriate markers for this purpose.
Because ORF8 might affect virulence, dromedary-associated
229E viruses could pose a threat to humans. The availability of
live-virus isolates in the present study has enabled a provisional
assessment of indicators of virulence and transmissibility. Our
data show that HCoV-229E–related viruses are able to use the
same cell entry receptor as HCoV-229E (i.e., hAPN), suggesting
a principal capability of infecting human cells. However, failure
to replicate in mucosa-derived cell cultures and differentiated
HAE cultures predicts a low overall capability of the novel viruses
to replicate in the human respiratory or enteric tract. Furthermore,
the novel viruses were at least as sensitive as wild-type HCoV-229E
against type I IFN in cell culture, predicting the existence of a
relevant level of innate immunity. Finally, the demonstration of
serological cross-neutralization points to the existence of popu-
lation immunity, which predicts limited epidemic risks associated
with these viruses in contemporary human populations. The pri-
mordial virus acquisition in humans would have met an immu-
nologically naive human population in which limited onward
transmission may have been established easier, leading to adaptive
changes and an optimization of viral traits facilitating transmission.
In summary, these findings provide important implications on the
origin of a human respiratory virus. Phenotypic assessment of live
viruses suggests an existing but limited epidemic risk for humans.
Our findings raise a scenario for the emergence of MERS-CoV,
which also represents a dromedary-associated virus that has limited
potential to infect humans but has not as yet established sustained
human-to-human transmission. Livestock species, including species
that are of regional importance such as camels, should be system-
atically tested for viruses capable of infecting humans.
Methods
Respiratory swabs from dromedaries were sampled in Kenya and KSA in 2014
and 2015. Stored sera from KSA as well as the United Arab Emirates, Kenya,
Somalia, Sudan, and Egypt were available from previous studies (17–19). Sera
were sampled between 1983 and 2015. Viral RNA was purified using the
MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche). Testing for 229E-CoV RNA was done as
described previously (14). Sequences were deposited under GenBank acces-
sion nos. KT253324-27 and KU291448-49. Serology by recombinant HCoV-
229E spike protein IFA has been described previously (38, 39). Sampling of
dromedaries, usage of stored biological specimens, and international ship-
ment thereof were done under governmental research clearances or approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (reference no. 2014.05.15)
at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Nairobi. Details on an-
imal handling, sampling, cell culture methodology, and virus and antibody
detection are provided in SI Methods.
