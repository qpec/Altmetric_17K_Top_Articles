Intravascular catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are a leading cause of
hospital-acquired infections worldwide, resulting not only in the burden of cost and
morbidity for patients but also in the over-consumption of medical resources for hospitals
and health care organizations. In this study, a novel auranofin releasing antibacterial
and antibiofilm polyurethane (PU) catheter coating was developed and investigated
for future use in preventing CRBSIs. Auranofin is an antirheumatic drug with recently
identified antimicrobial properties. The drug carrier, PU, acts as a barrier surrounding
the antibacterial agent, auranofin, to extend the drug release profile and improve its
long-term antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy and potentially the length of catheter
implantation within a patient. The PU+auranofin coatings developed here were found
to be highly stretchable (exhibiting ∼500% percent elongation), which is important for
the compliance of the material on a flexible catheter. PU+auranofin coated catheters
were able to inhibit the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for
8 to 26 days depending on the specific drug concentration utilized during the dip coating
process. The PU+auranofin coated catheters were also able to completely inhibit MRSA
biofilm formation in vitro, an effect that was not observed with auranofin or PU alone.
Lastly, these coatings were found to be hemocompatible with human erythrocytes and
maintain liver cell viability.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 150 million intravascular catheters are implanted annually in the United States
alone (Shah et al., 2013). Intravascular catheters are used for hemodynamic monitoring, renal
replacement therapy, nutritional support, and administration of medications (Alberti et al.,
2014). With the use of these intravascular devices comes a risk of catheter-related bloodstream
infections (CRBSIs). Over 250,000 CRBSIs are diagnosed annually in the U.S. (Maki et al.,
2006), making CRBSIs the most prevalent source of nosocomial bacteremia (Abebe et al., 2014).
These infections can prolong hospital stays by ∼10–20 days and increase the cost of care from
$4,000 to $56,000 per patient; more importantly, CRBSIs are associated with mortality rates of
12–25% (Maki et al., 2006).
 Liu et al.
Auranofin Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Coatings
CRBSIs are predominantly caused by Gram-positive bacteria
including species of Staphylococcus aureus (Abebe et al., 2014).
Intravascular catheters can become infected by microorganisms
in several ways: the catheter lumen can be contaminated prior
to use, the catheter tip and cutaneous tract can be contaminated
by the skin microbiome during insertion, contaminated infusate
can deliver bacteria, and inserted materials can be exposed
to microbes due to an existing systemic infection (Pugach
et al., 1999; Abebe et al., 2014). Once bacteria are introduced
to the catheter material, they can adhere and begin the
process of forming a biofilm, playing a significant role in
CRBSI pathogenesis (Donlan, 2002; Raad et al., 2007). Biofilms
are complex, surface-attached, three-dimensional microbial
colonies, consisting of bacteria embedded within a self-secreted
matrix containing proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular
DNA (Donlan, 2002). Once biofilms develop on medical device
surfaces they can lead to device failure (Danese, 2002) and
may also spread infection by releasing planktonic cells, which
can colonize downstream sites (Costerton, 1999; Stewart, 2002;
Lewis et al., 2005). Eradication of biofilms is a formidable
challenge due to the many sophisticated mechanisms bacteria
develop to protect against host defense mechanisms and the
prevalence of increased resistance against traditional antibiotic
treatments (Stewart, 2002; Flemming et al., 2016; Koo et al.,
2017). The biofilm matrix forms a physical barrier hindering
penetration and diffusion of antimicrobial agents (Costerton,
1999; Stewart, 2002), while the low metabolic state of biofilm
bacteria make them less susceptible to antibiotics (Brown
et al., 1988; de la Fuente-Núñez et al., 2013). Additionally,
bacteria also coordinate their physiological processes through
quorum sensing (Donlan, 2002; Li and Tian, 2016), allowing
the cells to communicate by releasing and responding to small
molecules aiding in colonization, defense against antimicrobials,
and adaptation to the microenvironment (Li and Tian, 2016). The
accumulation of biofilm within the catheter can lead to the need
for implant removal.
Several methods have been utilized to prevent microbial
colonization of catheters. The most common methods involve
the use of antimicrobial loaded or antimicrobial coated catheters.
Antimicrobial agents such as cefazolin (Kamal et al., 1991),
minocycline, rifampin (Raad et al., 1996), chlorhexidine, and
silver sulfadiazine (Maki et al., 1997) have been deposited
directly on catheter surfaces using dip coating or solvent
casting methods (Darouiche et al., 1999). However, these coating
strategies often lead to rapid release of the entire antimicrobial
payload (Danese, 2002). In order to provide sustained drug
release and long-term therapeutic efficacy, antimicrobials can
be incorporated on catheters within polymeric surface coatings.
Pugach et al. developed a gelatin hydrogel coating encapsulating
ciprofloxacin liposomes on silicone Foley catheters, which
significantly delayed bacteria colonization in vivo compared to
uncoated catheters (Pugach et al., 1999). Fischer et al. coated
polyurethane catheters with silver nanoparticles embedded in
star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)-heparin hydrogels, achieving
catheter hemocompatibility and antimicrobial functionality for
up to a week in vitro (Fischer et al., 2015). Hook et al. identified
a group of polymers capable of reducing bacterial attachment up
to 30-fold when compared to a commercial silver hydrogel and
successfully coated catheters with these polymers demonstrating
in vivo antibacterial efficacy (Hook et al., 2012). Fu et al. and
Curtin et al. loaded bacteriophage into Lubri-sil R
�, a neutral
hydrogel coating, on silicone French Foley catheters. They
observed a significant reduction in viable biofilm formation by
Staphylococcus epidermidis on the catheters over a 24 h in vitro
exposure period (Curtin and Donlan, 2006; Fu et al., 2010).
The antimicrobial efficacy of these previously reported catheter
coatings has been limited to a maximum of 2 weeks.
Despite the progress that has been made, the development
of
drug
resistance
remains
a
significant
concern
while
utilizing traditional antibiotic therapeutics in available catheter
technologies (Danese, 2002). Thus, we sought to incorporate
and examine a recently identified antimicrobial agent with
therapeutic potential in a new catheter coating. Auranofin is an
FDA approved antirheumatic therapeutic that is a particularly
promising antimicrobial candidate, having shown antibacterial
and antifungal efficacy (Cassetta et al., 2014; Harbut et al.,
2015; Fuchs et al., 2016; Thangamani et al., 2016) along with
potent antibiofilm efficacy (Torres et al., 2016; AbdelKhalek
et al., 2018). Auranofin exhibits effective antimicrobial activity
primarily against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria including
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus
faecalis, drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Enterococcus faecium,
and S. aureus (Harbut et al., 2015). The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of auranofin against these bacteria is as
low as 0.25 µg/mL (Hassanein et al., 2017). Auranofin has a
unique mechanism of action that relies on its potent inhibition
of bacterial thioredoxin reductase, an important protein in
thiol based redox metabolism essential in maintaining cellular
processes including protection against reactive oxygen species,
protein folding, and DNA synthesis (Lundstrom and Holmgren,
1990; Ritz and Beckwith, 2001; Lu and Holmgren, 2014).
Inhibiting the bacterial thioredoxin reductase and disrupting the
redox balance results in cell death (Bonilla et al., 2008; Debnath
et al., 2012; Tejman-Yarden et al., 2013). This antibacterial drug
target has been shown to highly limit the development of drug
resistance (Lin et al., 2016; Sweeney et al., 2017).
Localized delivery has the potential to provide rapid
antimicrobial activity, while minimizing offsite toxicity and
lowering susceptibility to resistance (Brooks and Brooks, 2014).
Auranofin has previously been incorporated into polymeric
particles for the localized treatment of bacterial infections
(Pearson et al., 2015; Díez-Martínez et al., 2016). In this work,
we report the development and in vitro characterization of an
auranofin containing polyurethane (PU) catheter coating that
may have the potential to lower the incidence of CRBSIs. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an auranofin
containing device coating. PU is an FDA approved polymer that
has been used extensively in biomedical devices for over 45 years
due to its biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility (Ding et al.,
2012; He et al., 2012), and low protein fouling properties (Xue
and Greisler, 2003; Wilson, 2004; Maki et al., 2006). Specifically,
we utilized a commercially available aromatic polyether-based
PU, Texin RxT85A, to develop the auranofin encapsulating
coatings reported in this work. Texin RxT85A has been used in a

wide range of medical products including anesthetic connectors,
flexible tubing and films, and catheters. It has also been used
to fabricate drug delivery materials including nanocomposite
films and nanofibers that can encapsulate and control the release
of antiseptic drugs (Saha et al., 2014). Here, we demonstrate
the sustained release capabilities of auranofin containing PU
catheter coatings, leading to antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy
against MRSA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Aromatic polyether-based PU (Texin RxT85A) was supplied
by Covestro AG (Leverkusen, Germany). The antibacterial
drug, auranofin, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX). All solvents, chemicals, and media, unless
otherwise noted, were purchased from MilliporeSigma (St. Louis,
MO). Bacto agar was obtained from BD Biosciences (San
Jose, CA). Ultrapure deionized water (18.2 M�.cm, Milli-Q,
EMD Millipore, Taunton, MA) was used in all experiments.
Surflo fourteen-gauge Teflon intravenous catheters [2.15 O.D.
(1.73 I.D.) × 51 mm] were supplied by Patterson Veterinary
(Devens, MA). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheets (AMS
3651) measuring 30 cm by 30 cm with a thickness of 0.38 mm,
were obtained from Amazon (Seattle, WA). Tryptic soy broth
(Remel), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco),
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), and precleaned microscope
glass slides were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
(Waltham, MA). MRSA USA300 engineered to express luciferase
(USA300 Lac::Lux) was supplied by Dr. Michael Hamblin at
Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) (Dai et al., 2013).
For cytotoxicity testing, human red blood cells (hRBCs) and
human hepatoma cells (ATCC HB-8065 HepG2) were obtained
from Rockland Immunochemicals (Limerick, PA) and Dr.
Bryan Fuchs at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA),
respectively. Cell proliferation reagent, WST-1, was obtained
from Roche (Mannheim, Germany).
Development of PU Coatings
Auranofin containing PU coatings were developed by first
dissolving PU in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at a concentration of
50 mg/mL at 20◦C for 24 h. Auranofin was then added to
the PU solution and thoroughly mixed. This PU+auranofin
mixture was then used to produce films for: (1) thickness
measurement, (2) tensile testing, or (3) catheter coating for drug
release and in vitro efficacy and cytocompatibility testing. For
thickness measurements, flat PTFE substrates measuring 16 mm
by 16 mm by 0.38 mm were coated via drop casting 1 mL of
the PU+auranofin mixture with 0, 3, or 10 mg/mL auranofin;
coatings were dried at 20◦C until complete THF evaporation
was noted, resulting in a dry PU+auranofin coating. For tensile
testing, standalone PU+auranofin films were developed similarly
to the coatings on PTFE but instead, 2 mL of the PU+auranofin
mixture was drop cast onto glass slides measuring 25 mm by
75 mm. These coatings were readily peeled off of the glass and
cut into rectangles measuring 12 mm by 38 mm for subsequent
testing. For the catheter coatings, catheter segments measuring
10 mm in length were dipped into the PU+auranofin solution
(1 catheter segment per 1 mL of PU+auranofin mixture) at
auranofin concentrations of 0, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/mL for 24 h
at 20◦C. The catheters were removed from this mixture and the
solvent in the coatings was allowed to evaporate at 20◦C for 24 h.
All coatings were stored at 4◦C prior to use. Films with 0 mg/mL
auranofin were denoted “PU only” coatings.
Characterization of Coating Morphological
and Mechanical Properties
The thicknesses of PU+auranofin and PU only coatings on PTFE
were evaluated using a Dektak3 profilometer (Bruker, Santa
Barbara, CA). Average step height was measured at three random
locations on the coated material. Tensile testing of the standalone
films was carried out using an Instron Series 5942 Universal
Testing System (Norwood, MA) equipped with a 500 N load
cell. An extension rate of 0.1 mm/s was employed until material
failure was noted. The pre-yield elastic deformation region (up
to 15% extension) of the engineering stress vs. strain curve
was used to determine the tensile elastic modulus of the film.
The interior and outer coating surfaces on the coated catheters
along with non-coated catheters were imaged using a LEO
Gemini 1530 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). Prior to SEM imaging, the catheters
were sputter coated with gold and palladium. Coated and non-
coated catheters were also imaged using an inverted tissue culture
trinocular microscope (AmScope, Irvine, CA) equipped with an
AmScope MU500 eyepiece camera (5.1 MP Aptina Color CMOS)
and 4× objective lens.
Quantifying Auranofin Release in vitro
Auranofin release from PU+auranofin coated catheters was
monitored by incubating each coated catheter in 1.98 mL of
tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.25% glucose (TSBG) at
37◦C with shaking at 110 rpm. Glucose supplementation of
TSB has previously been shown to promote biofilm formation
(Heilmann et al., 1996; Lim et al., 2004). Every 24 h, the
release solutions were collected and completely replaced with
fresh medium. A microdilution assay, as described previously
(Shukla and Shukla, 2018), was used to determine the amount of
auranofin contained in the media release samples by comparing
the antibacterial activity to that of known concentrations of non-
coating incorporated auranofin. Briefly, 150 µL of each TSBG
release sample was transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate
and serially diluted 1:1 (v/v) with TSBG. Controls of non-
coating incorporated auranofin were treated similarly. MRSA
USA300 (10 µL) at a final concentration of 105 CFU/mL in the
exponential growth phase (as determined by optical density) was
added to these wells. Negative controls of media with no bacteria
and positive controls of TSBG with USA300 in the absence of
drug were included. Plates were incubated at 37◦C with shaking
at 110 rpm for ∼18 h. Subsequently, the optical density (OD) of
the samples was read at 600 nm using a Cytation3 microplate
reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The normalized bacteria density

was calculated using Equation (1).
Normalized bacteria density
=
sample OD − negative control OD
positive control OD − negative control OD
(1)
The MIC of the auranofin control against USA300 was
determined as the concentration range of auranofin needed
to observe a statistically significant transition of normalized
bacteria density from zero to greater than zero. The amount of
auranofin in the PU coating release media was then estimated
by determining how many dilutions of the release media were
required to reach this MIC transition point and computing a high
and low estimate for the concentration of auranofin in the release
solution (set by the MIC concentration range of non-coating
incorporated auranofin).
Auranofin release was also monitored in water (pH 6) at 37◦C
for PU+auranofin coated catheters formulated with auranofin
at 3 and 10 mg/mL. These coated catheters were incubated in
1 mL of water at 37◦C with shaking at 110 rpm. Every 24 h,
the release solutions were collected and completely replaced
with fresh water. Auranofin in the water release samples was
quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). ICP-
OES can detect the presence of the gold (Au) atom in the
auranofin molecule. Briefly, the release samples were diluted
1:4 (v/v) with water for a total sample volume of 5 mL. This
sample was injected into the ICP-OES with a radial plasma
view configuration for concentrations above 1 ppm of auranofin
and with an axial plasma view configuration for concentrations
below 1 ppm. The concentration of auranofin in the release
solutions was calculated by comparing the intensity of the
signal obtained at the characteristic wavelength range of Au
(242.79–242.80 nm) against that of a known auranofin standard
examined concurrently.
Assessing Coating Antibacterial and
Antibiofilm Efficacy in vitro
Antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of PU+auranofin catheter
coatings was examined against USA300, a community-associated
MRSA strain. Kirby-Bauer and broth bacteria survival assays
on the coated catheters and on their release solutions were
conducted, respectively. For the Kirby-Bauer assay, USA300 in
its exponential growth phase at a concentration of 108 CFU/mL
was spread on tryptic soy agar plates. PU+auranofin coated and
uncoated catheters were cut in half lengthwise using a scalpel.
Both the inner and outer surfaces of the catheters were placed
in direct contact with the bacteria seeded agar and incubated for
24 h at 37◦C. These plates were then photographed using a Canon
PowerShot S110 digital camera (Tokyo, Japan).
Long-term antibacterial activity of the coated catheters was
confirmed using MRSA microdilution assays as described in
the section Quantifying Auranofin Release in vitro. The efficacy
of these coatings against a greater MRSA challenge than a
standard microdilution assay (2 x 106 CFU/mL vs. 105 CFU/mL,
respectively) was investigated. Coated catheters were incubated
in 1.98 mL of TSBG medium with shaking at 110 rpm at 37◦C.
The release medium was collected every 24 h and replaced with
fresh TSBG medium. A 20 µL suspension of USA300 was added
to the release solution to obtain a final bacteria concentration of
2 × 106 CFU/mL. This bacterial suspension was incubated with
shaking at 110 rpm at 37◦C for 24 h. The OD of the samples was
measured at 600 nm using a Thermo Scientific Spectronic 2000
Visible Spectrophotometer (Waltham, MA). Negative controls
of media with no bacteria and positive controls of TSBG with
USA300 in the absence of drug were included. A normalized
bacteria density was computed using Equation (1) for all test
samples. Additional release samples were tested for bacterial
growth inhibition until no inhibition of bacterial growth was
observed. An identical assay was conducted to examine the effect
of coating time on antibacterial activity over time. For this study,
coatings were formulated as described in section Development of
PU Coatings, except that coating times were varied (5 s, 1 h, 1 day,
or 7 days).
The antibiofilm activity of PU+auranofin coatings was also
examined. PU+auranofin coatings with 3 or 10 mg/mL auranofin
utilized in the coating process, along with PU only coatings
and variations of these coatings, in which vancomycin replaced
auranofin, or only auranofin (3 mg/mL) was used without any
PU, were examined in these studies. Vancomycin coated catheters
were first dip coated in an ethanol solution containing the drug
at either 3 or 10 mg/mL for 24 h at 20◦C. These catheters were
then removed from the ethanol solution and allowed to dry for
24 h at 20◦C. The catheters were subsequently dip coated in 50
mg/mL PU in THF for 24 h at 20◦C, followed by a complete
drying of these coatings at 20◦C. Coated or uncoated catheter
segments were placed in 1 mL USA300 bacterial suspensions
at a concentration of 104 CFU/mL in TSBG at 37◦C with
shaking at 110 rpm for 2 h. The samples were then removed
from this suspension and rinsed 3 times with fresh TSBG to
remove any unattached bacteria. The rinsed catheter segments
were placed in new sterile vials containing 5 mL of fresh TSBG
every 12 h. After 2 days, the bacterial burden on the catheters was
evaluated by examining the level of bacterial bioluminescence
on the catheters using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS Lumina
III, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Following IVIS imaging, the
biofilms were disrupted by placing the catheter segments in
5 mL of 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to
sonication at ∼40 kHz for 7 min (Fisher Scientific FS30) followed
by vortexing for 1 min. The samples were serially diluted in
TSBG, plated on tryptic soy agar, and the colony forming units
(CFUs) were counted.
Examining Coating Biocompatibility in vitro
The biocompatibility of PU+auranofin coatings and controls was
evaluated by examining erythrocyte lysis and human hepatoma
cell (ATCC HB-8065 HepG2) viability upon exposure to coated
catheters or catheter incubated media, respectively. Hemolysis
was examined as previously described (Gwisai et al., 2017;
Zhou et al., 2017) by incubating hRBCs with PU+auranofin
coated catheters (3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL auranofin coating
concentration), PU only coatings, auranofin only coatings
(3 mg/mL coating concentration), and uncoated catheters.
Catheters were incubated with 1 mL of 2% (v/v) hRBCs in 24-well

plates for 1 h at 37◦C. Negative controls containing no catheter
and only hRBCs were also included. Positive controls of the 2%
hRBCs suspension incubated with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 were
included. After incubation, the plates were centrifuged at 500
× g for 5 min. A 50 µL aliquot of the supernatant from each
well was transferred to a 96-well plate. Absorbance at 540 nm
was quantified using a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular
Devices, San Jose, CA) to measure hemolysis. Normalized
hemolysis was calculated using Equation (2).

The viability of HepG2 cells exposed to PU+auranofin coating
release solutions was assessed using a colorimetric assay with
WST-1. HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS at 37◦C with 5% CO2. PU+auranofin coated
catheters (3 mg/mL auranofin coating concentration), PU only
coatings, and uncoated catheters were incubated in HepG2
culture media for 24 h at 37◦C. HepG2 cells were seeded at a
density of 3.125 × 106 cells/cm2 in polystyrene tissue-culture
treated 96-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY) and immediately
incubated with 100 µL of the different catheter incubation
medias at 37◦C with 5% CO2. Non-coating incorporated
auranofin was also included at concentrations of 0.5–32 µg/mL.
After 20 h, 10 µL of WST-1 was added to each well and the plates
were incubated for 4 h at 37◦C with 5% CO2. The absorbance
(abs) of each well was measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax
M2 UV-Vis microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA).
Normalized cell viability was calculated using Equation (3).

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were conducted in triplicate at minimum.
All data is reported as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism with either
a two-tailed t-test or one- or two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey’s post-hoc analysis, as appropriate. Data
was considered statistically significant for p < 0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In vitro Auranofin Release From Coated
Catheters and Antibacterial Efficacy
In this work, PU+auranofin catheter coatings were developed to
combat complications such as bacteria attachment, infection, and
biofilm development that can occur with extended catheter use
(Trautner and Darouiche, 2004). To the best of our knowledge,
auranofin has not previously been used in device coatings.
We sought to determine if auranofin was released from PU
coatings at concentrations effective against planktonic MRSA.
Initial investigations were performed with PU+auranofin coated
catheters formulated from four concentrations of auranofin
coating solution (3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL). Auranofin, unlike
many other antimicrobial agents such as vancomycin, which
has a measurable absorbance (Shukla and Shukla, 2018), is not
readily detectable via absorbance or fluorescence spectroscopy
without modification. Therefore, MRSA growth inhibition in a
microdilution assay was utilized to estimate the concentrations
of auranofin present in coated catheter release solutions. In this
technique, serial dilutions of the release samples are made and
incubated with MRSA. The most diluted solution able to inhibit
bacterial growth is considered the upper range of the MIC of the
drug in the release sample. By multiplying the dilution factor used
to reach this concentration with the measured MIC of the drug, a
concentration of drug in the release solution can be estimated.
Figure S1 shows normalized MRSA density over a range
of concentrations for non-coating incorporated auranofin. The
MIC of non-coating incorporated auranofin against USA300
was determined to be 0.063 µg/mL, consistent with previous
reports (Harbut et al., 2015; Fuchs et al., 2016; Thangamani et al.,
2016). We observed a transition of MRSA growth to no growth
between auranofin concentrations of 0.031 and 0.063 µg/mL.
Using this concentration range for non-coating incorporated
auranofin and assuming no change in auranofin activity caused
by the coating process, the auranofin release profile from
the PU+auranofin catheter coatings was determined. Figure 1
shows the release profile of all PU+auranofin coatings tested
as a range estimated by the dilution factor required to reach
MIC values. Catheters with coatings formulated using 3 and
10 mg/mL auranofin solutions exhibited effective drug release
above MIC values over a period of 8 days. Raising the drug
concentration in the coatings during formulation to 30 or 60
mg/mL extended auranofin release from 8 days to 11 and 26
days, respectively. A large auranofin release was observed for all
coating formulations in the first 24 h followed by a slow extended
release. As shown in Figure 1, for the 3 mg/mL auranofin coating
concentration, ∼90% of the total auranofin eluted by 8 days was
released in the first day. Interestingly, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL
PU+auranofin samples all had similar percentages of auranofin
released in the first day (∼65, 66, and 62% of the total auranofin
released by 8, 11, and 26 days, respectively). The similar burst
release for the higher auranofin coating concentrations suggests
that at these concentrations, the burst release of auranofin is
independent of the amount of auranofin loaded on the catheters.
The cumulative release of auranofin was increased from ∼7
µg for a 3 mg/mL auranofin coating concentration to ∼37 µg
for a 10 and 30 mg/mL auranofin coating concentration and
78 µg for a 60 mg/mL auranofin coating concentration. Given
that the bacterial MIC is reached with the lowest auranofin
formulation concentration, it is perceivable that this formulation
could be effective in inhibiting bacterial accumulation on the
implant material.
It is possible that the final auranofin release values do
not represent the total auranofin loading in a single 10 mm
catheter segment and that some auranofin may still release
below MIC values which are not readily detectable. ICP-OES,
which is capable of detecting the gold atom in auranofin
molecules in non-complex solvents (e.g., water rather than
PBS or media), was utilized to evaluate auranofin release in
deionized water (pH 6) at 37◦C from PU+auranofin catheters

Auranofin Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Coatings
FIGURE 1 | In vitro release profile of auranofin in TSBG medium for
PU+auranofin coated catheters formulated at 4 different auranofin coating
concentrations (3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL). Release was evaluated by
examining MRSA USA300 inhibition. Data is represented as a range set by the
upper and lower limits of the auranofin MIC for each day at which the release

formulated using 3 and 10 mg/mL auranofin solutions. At
8 days, 95 ± 31 µg of auranofin had released from the 3
mg/mL auranofin coatings and 319 ± 62 µg of auranofin was
released from the 10 mg/mL coatings. As with the media release
studies quantified using bacterial microdilution methods, a
greater cumulative release was observed from the PU+auranofin
coatings formulated using 10 mg/mL auranofin compared to
3 mg/mL auranofin at 8 days. However, the values quantified
for water release were significantly greater than those observed
in media. These differences may arise from the differences
in the release environment for the two methods used. Media
components may adsorb onto or absorb into the catheter coating
over time and potentially form interactions with auranofin or
PU, slowing drug release. The water environment lacks these
interactions and may therefore enable a greater release. The
differences in pH (pH 7.4 for the media vs. 6 for the water) may
also factor in, as has previously been observed for polyurethane
materials (Chen et al., 2014).
The in vitro auranofin release profile studies confirmed
planktonic bacterial inhibition by individual catheter release
samples at PU+auranofin coating compositions formulated
using 3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL auranofin. Given the potent
activity of auranofin at low concentrations, we examined whether
auranofin release from these coatings was also able to inhibit the
growth of MRSA at a 20 times greater bacterial concentration
than the standard microdilution assay. Figure 2 shows the
efficacy of MRSA growth inhibition for this greater bacterial
challenge (2 × 106 CFU/mL) upon bacterial incubation with
PU+auranofin coating release solutions collected over time. We
found that the coating release samples were able to completely
inhibit bacterial growth for samples collected at time points
identical to the microdilution assays conducted at lower bacteria
concentrations. Namely, PU+auranofin coatings formulated
with the 3 and 10 mg/mL auranofin were effective over 8 days,
while those formulated with 30 and 60 mg/mL auranofin were
effective for 11 and 26 days, respectively.
FIGURE 2 | Antibacterial efficacy of PU+auranofin coated catheters.
PU+auranofin coatings formulated at 4 different auranofin coating
concentrations (3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL) were incubated with 2 × 106
CFU/mL MRSA USA300 and normalized bacteria density was determined
following 18 h. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation where
***p < 0.001 indicates significance between days using two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s post-hoc analysis (n = 3).
Having confirmed multi-day in vitro efficacy of all coating
formulations examined, we investigated whether changing the
coating formulation process could affect efficacy. Specifically,
we determined whether the catheter coating time in the
PU+auranofin solution changed its efficacy. Holding the
auranofin concentration in the coating solution constant at 3
mg/mL, we examined coating times of 5 s, 1 h, and 7 days
in addition to the 1 day coating time utilized for all other
experiments. Release samples taken over time from each of these
coatings were examined for their bacterial growth inhibition
efficacy using a 2 × 106 CFU/mL MRSA concentration as
shown in Figure 3. We observed that catheters coated for
1 and 7 days behaved similarly, inhibiting MRSA growth
over 8 days. Interestingly, catheters coated for 5 s and 1 h
exhibited antibacterial activity against MRSA for 7 days. These
findings suggested that even short coating periods lead to
significant drug incorporation on the catheter capable of
releasing and inhibiting bacterial growth over a period of 1
week. Effective above MIC release can be extended by 1 day
if the coating duration is increased. For future translation of
these materials, rapid production is possible without significantly
compromising efficacy.
Next we examined whether PU+auranofin coated catheters
were able to inhibit bacterial growth using both the inner and
outer surface of the coated catheters. The results of a Kirby Bauer
assay using PU+auranofin coated catheters formulated using 3,
10, 30, and 60 mg/mL auranofin are shown in Figure 4. For
these experiments coated catheters were cut in half lengthwise
and plated with either the inner surface of the catheter (i.e.,
the catheter lumen) or the outer surface face down on MRSA
coated agar; controls of uncoated catheters were also included.
A clear zone of inhibition surrounded all PU+auranofin coated
catheter samples regardless of whether the inner or outer surface

was exposed to the bacteria. In contrast, the uncoated samples
did not exhibit any bacterial growth inhibition. Positive controls
of 30 µg vancomycin discs were included and performed as
expected with an average zone of inhibition diameter of 1.48
± 0.2 cm. Quantitative comparison between inner and outer
surface catheter coatings in terms of drug loading and efficacy are
difficult to make as small differences in sample size and shape can
alter the shape and size of the zone of inhibition that is observed
surrounding these samples. Further, a degree of dose dependent
release was suggested by the smaller clearing generated in the
presence of the catheter material coated with 3 mg/mL auranofin
compared to the other coating formulations examined.
Overall,
our
investigations
demonstrated
that
catheter
coatings generated with 3 and 10 mg/mL auranofin were
highly effective in inhibiting bacterial growth albeit over
shorter
timescales
compared
to
the
30
and
60
mg/mL
auranofin coating conditions. For the purposes of in vitro
characterization, we proceeded with using the 3 and 10 mg/mL
FIGURE 3 | Antibacterial efficacy of PU+auranofin coated catheters
formulated by varying coating times. PU+auranofin coatings formulated at 4
different coating times (5 s, 1 h, 1 day, and 7 days) at an auranofin coating
concentration of 3 mg/mL were incubated with 2 × 106 CFU/mL MRSA
USA300 and normalized bacteria density was determined following 18 h. Data
are shown as mean ± standard deviation where *p < 0.05 indicates
significance between days using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc
analysis (n = 3).
auranofin coating concentrations for further analysis of coating
morphology, mechanical properties, antibiofilm efficacy, and
cytocompatibility. For conditions that may require lengthier
application, the greater auranofin coating concentrations of 30
and 60 mg/mL are possible options that can be explored.
Catheter Coating Morphology and
Mechanical Properties
Having
determined
that
PU+auranofin
coatings
lead
to
effective auranofin release and MRSA inhibition, we sought
to determine if coating the catheter altered the implant
material. Light microscope images of the coatings formulated
with PU+auranofin solutions containing 3 and 10 mg/mL
auranofin demonstrate a slightly rough exterior, with discernible
differences from the PU only coated Teflon catheter (Figure 5).
SEM imaging of the catheters confirmed surface texturization
in the PU+auranofin coated catheters compared to the PU only
coated catheters (Figure 5). Compared with PU only coatings,
the added surface texture may result from the interaction of
auranofin with the PU during the drying process, preventing a
completely smooth surface from forming.
The thickness of these coatings on flat PTFE sheets
was examined via profilometry for PU+auranofin coatings
formulated with auranofin coating concentrations of 3 and 10
mg/mL. Figure 6A shows the average thickness of PU only
and PU+auranofin coatings. The average thickness of PU only
coatings was 307.7 ± 16.6 µm; auranofin loaded PU coatings
had average thicknesses of 292.5 ± 17.7 and 313.1 ± 20.5 µm
for 3 and 10 mg/mL auranofin, respectively. The presence of
auranofin did not lead to statistically significant changes in
coating thicknesses between these three groups, despite the effect
on coating morphology.
To further evaluate the mechanical properties of the
PU+auranofin coatings, tensile tests were performed on
standalone coatings. As seen in Figure 6B, PU coating stiffness
decreased when 10 mg/mL but not 3 mg/mL auranofin was
included in the coating process compared to PU only. PU only
coatings exhibited an elastic modulus of 10.3 ± 0.8 MPa vs.
10.1 ± 0.8 MPa and 7.7 ± 0.4 MPa for PU+auranofin coatings
formulated from 3 to 10 mg/mL auranofin, respectively. The

Auranofin Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Coatings
decreased stiffness may result from disruption of the hydrogen
bonding in the PU hard segments, which is known to reinforce
the material (Shoeib et al., 2010). This effect has been observed
with poly(ethylene glycol), where the oxygen atoms in the
backbone act as hydrogen bond acceptors that weaken the PU
hard segments (Park et al., 2001). The auranofin molecule has
nine hydrogen bond acceptors and may have a similar effect. The
coatings are highly stretchable as seen in Figure 6C. There was
no statistical difference between the percent elongation at break
(∼500%) between PU coatings formulated with and without
auranofin (Figure 6D), in agreement with what has previously
been reported for PU coatings (La Francesca et al., 2018).
Overall, the incorporation of auranofin does not appreciably
impact the tensile properties of these coatings compared to PU
only, maintaining the high degree of stretchability which will be
important for future clinical use on catheters.
In vitro Antibiofilm Efficacy of Coated
Catheters
Having examined the morphological and mechanical properties
of the PU+auranofin coatings, we next determined how biofilm
formation was affected by the drug coatings. Auranofin was
previously suggested to inhibit preformed S. aureus biofilms
within 2 h of exposure, although with limited bactericidal activity
likely due to the lack of metabolic activity required for target
effectiveness within biofilm bacteria (Torres et al., 2016). Our
work expands upon these previous findings, now examining the
effect that auranofin has on biofilm prevention, as would be the
case for a newly introduced medical implant.
To further examine the potential for using PU+auranofin
coated catheters clinically, coated catheter segments formulated
using 3 and 10 mg/mL auranofin were exposed to MRSA and then
examined for biofilm formation over 48 h. PU+vancomycin,
auranofin
only
(lacking
PU,
formulated
with
3
mg/mL
auranofin), and PU only coatings were also examined along with
uncoated catheters. Vancomycin, a potent glycopeptide antibiotic
highly effective against MRSA (Abebe et al., 2014), was loaded
onto the catheters as a control to test its antibiofilm efficacy
in comparison to auranofin coatings. Biofilm accumulation
on catheter segments was visualized using an IVIS imaging
system as seen in Figure 7A with luminescence indicating
the presence of bacteria. Subsequently, the number of colony
forming units (CFUs) attached on catheters was quantified by
detaching the colonies and counting, as shown in Figure 7B.
FIGURE 7 | Antibiofilm efficacy of coated catheters. (A) Bioluminescence (radiance) of MRSA USA300 Lac::Lux examined using IVIS. Catheters were either uncoated
or coated with auranofin only (at a 3 mg/mL coating concentration), PU only, PU+vancomycin, or PU+auranofin at 2 different drug coating concentrations (3 and 10
mg/mL). Samples were exposed to USA300, rinsed, and potentially attached biofilms were allowed to mature over 2 days prior to measurement. (B) The colony
forming units of USA300 recovered from the different catheter groups imaged in (A). Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation where ***p < 0.001 indicates
significance between CFU for the samples evaluated using one-way ANOVA (n = 3).

 Liu et al.
Auranofin Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Coatings
With the exception of the PU+auranofin coatings, all catheters
tested exhibited bacterial luminescence. Both PU+auranofin
formulations completely inhibited bacterial attachment.
We saw that PU+vancomycin and auranofin only coatings did
not exhibit any statistical difference in bacterial CFU attachment
as compared to uncoated catheters. Due to vancomycin
hydrophilicity, we hypothesize that vancomycin is released
rapidly from these coatings, leading to a lack in efficacy in
preventing biofilm formation. Auranofin only coatings are also
likely highly unstable due to the lack of a polymer carrier and are
similarly unable to prevent bacterial attachment.
Interestingly, PU only coatings showed a 1-log reduction
in bacterial attachment as compared to uncoated catheters.
This antibiofilm activity of PU has previously been observed
(Martìnez-Martìnez et al., 1990; Lopez-Lopez et al., 1991;
Zdrahala and Zdrahala, 1999) and is likely due to the smooth PU
surface as we observed with SEM. Overall, formulating auranofin
in a PU catheter coating enabled both bacterial growth inhibition
in planktonic cultures over time and complete prevention of
bacterial surface attachment, which was not possible for either
PU or auranofin alone.
In vitro Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Coated
Catheters
The PU+auranofin coatings developed in this work are highly
promising as antibacterial materials. Future translation of these
materials requires that the materials are biocompatible. The
drug coated catheters will eventually be employed as functioning
devices; in this scenario, they will be exposed to circulating
blood. For this reason, we tested the auranofin coated devices
in the presence of human erythrocytes to see if the various
drug coating concentrations could incite lysis. The hemolysis of
PU+auranofin coatings at all formulations developed (i.e., 3, 10,
30, and 60 mg/mL of auranofin coating concentrations), PU only
coatings, auranofin only coatings (formulated using a 3 mg/mL
auranofin solution), and uncoated catheters was compared with
hRBC negative and positive controls (i.e., untreated and Triton
X-100 treated hRBCs, respectively), as shown in Figure 8A.
We did not observe any significant difference in normalized
hemolysis between any of the tested coating groups and the
untreated controls, indicating excellent hemocompatibility of the
PU+auranofin coated catheters.
We
also
evaluated
the
cytotoxicity
of
PU+auranofin
coatings formulated using 3 mg/mL auranofin, PU only,
and uncoated catheters incubated in cell culture media for
24 h on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. HepG2 cells were
selected due to their widespread use as in vitro models for
liver metabolism of toxins (Guillouzo et al., 2007). Initially
we examined the viability of HepG2 cells with non-coating
incorporated auranofin (Figure S2). We observed that the
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for viability
for non-coating incorporated auranofin fell between 16 and
32 µg/mL, which corresponds with IC50 values of auranofin
previously reported for HepG2 cells (Liu et al., 2015). Figure 8B
shows the percentage of viable cells upon exposure to catheter
release media. None of the formulations tested affected the
viability of HepG2 cells compared to a no catheter control.
From the in vitro media release studies, a concentration
of 3 µg/mL auranofin for the 24 h release sample could be
estimated, falling well below the IC50 concentration. The
catheter alone and PU alone coating was not expected to
have any effect on the cells, as previously FDA approved
materials. Similarly, auranofin is typically administrated orally
to patients at an auranofin concentration of 6 mg/mL per day
for antirheumatic therapy and has demonstrated no cumulative
toxicity during long-term treatments (Egsmose et al., 1995).

at a 3 mg/mL auranofin coating concentration), PU+auranofin (formulated at 3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/mL auranofin coating concentrations) compared to negative
controls of untreated hRBCs and a Triton X-100 incubated positive control. (B) Normalized HepG2 liver cell viability upon exposure to media incubated with uncoated
catheters, PU only, and PU+auranofin (formulated at a 3 mg/mL auranofin coating concentration) catheters for 24 h. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation.
Statistical significance was evaluated using one-way ANOVA (n = 3) and is shown as ***p < 0.001 indicating statistical significance between the positive control (Triton
X-100 with hRBCs) and other conditions tested. No statistical significance was noted between the other hemolysis conditions tested or between the different HepG2
viability conditions examined (p > 0.5).

for human toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS
Solvent
casting
PU+auranofin
catheter
coatings
yielded
materials that prevented the attachment of MRSA and the
accumulation of bacteria that enables biofilm formation.
Auranofin
release
profiles
estimated
in
bacteria
media
demonstrated the potential to achieve 26 days of above
MIC release for specific formulations of this coating. A large
initial release in the first day was followed by a slow sustained
release. MRSA growth inhibition was observed between 8 and
26 days depending on the auranofin concentration utilized
during coating formation. These coatings exceed the maximal
2 week period of efficacy observed for previously reported
antimicrobial catheters. Most importantly, the coatings were
capable of completely preventing MRSA biofilm formation, a
property unique to the combined PU+auranofin coating and
not observed with auranofin or PU alone. The PU+auranofin
coating did not adversely affect catheter structure. Finally,
we observed that these coatings are non-toxic to healthy
hRBCs and HepG2 cells, important for future preclinical
and
clinical

of
these
products.
Intravascular
catheters can be used over a 72 to 96 h time period (Brown
and Rowland, 2013); adding an inhibitory drug such as
auranofin in the form of a sustained release coating can
prevent infection by planktonic and biofilm bacteria, potentially
limiting CRBSIs.
