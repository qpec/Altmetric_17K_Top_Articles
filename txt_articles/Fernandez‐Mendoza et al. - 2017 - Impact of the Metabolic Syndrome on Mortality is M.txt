Background-—To examine whether objective sleep duration is an effect modifier of the impact of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on
all-cause and cardiovascular disease/cerebrovascular mortality.
Methods and Results-—We addressed this question in the Penn State Adult Cohort, a random, general population sample of 1344
men and women (48.8�14.2 years) who were studied in the sleep laboratory and followed up for 16.6�4.2 years. MetS was
defined by the presence of 3 or more of obesity (≥30 kg/m2), elevated total cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL), triglycerides (≥150 mg/
dL), fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL), and blood pressure (≥130/85 mm Hg). Polysomnographic sleep duration was classified into
clinically meaningful categories. Among the 1344 participants, 22.0% of them died during the follow-up. We tested the interaction
between MetS and polysomnographic sleep duration on mortality using Cox proportional hazard models controlling for multiple
potential confounders (P<0.05). The hazard ratios (95% CI) of all-cause and cardiovascular disease/cerebrovascular mortality
associated with MetS were 1.29 (0.89–1.87) and 1.49 (0.75–2.97) for individuals who slept ≥6 hours and 1.99 (1.53–2.59) and
2.10 (1.39–3.16) for individuals who slept <6 hours. Interestingly, this effect modification was primarily driven by the elevated
blood pressure and glucose dysregulation components of MetS.
Conclusions-—The risk of mortality associated with MetS is increased in those with short sleep duration. Short sleep in individuals
with MetS may be linked to greater central autonomic and metabolic dysfunction. Future clinical trials should examine whether
lengthening sleep improves the prognosis of individuals with MetS. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005479. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.

M
etabolic syndrome (MetS) is the clustering of several
inter-related risk factors for cardiovascular (CVD) and
cerebrovascular (CBV) disease, consisting of abdominal
obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and high
blood pressure (BP). It is estimated that around 35% to 40% of
the US population has MetS.1 Its prevalence has continued to
increase because of the rapid increase in obesity rates in the
last decades, which promotes insulin resistance.2–5 In 2006,
the American Heart Association and the American Stroke
Association identified MetS as the less well-documented, but
most potentially modifiable, risk factor for CVD and CBV.6,7
For example, Rodriguez-Colon et al7 not only showed that
MetS was associated with an increased risk of incident
stroke, but also that this risk increased as the number of
MetS components increased and was greatest among those
MetS clusters in which insulin resistance and high BP were
present.7 Moreover, MetS is associated with great economic
healthcare costs and increased risk of all-cause mortality.8
Although there is a clear association between the MetS
and sleep disordered breathing (SDB),9–14 the association of
sleep duration with MetS and its role in predicting mortality is
still poorly understood. Sleep duration has been shown to be
associated with specific cardiometabolic risk factors3–5,15–18
and mortality6,19,20; however, studies examining MetS have
reported modest and inconsistent effects.21,22 An important
limitation of previous studies is that they relied typically on
subjective measures of sleep, and thus the role of objective

 sleep duration was not examined and the potential con-
founder of SDB not controlled for. This has led to the
understanding that measures of impaired sleep, such as short
sleep duration, may not yet be useful in predicting adverse
health outcomes, such as probability of death, in the context
of the MetS. Most important, previous studies have focused
on the sole, independent association of sleep duration with
mortality22 and none conceptualized objective sleep duration
as an effect modifier of the association of cardiometabolic
risk factors, including MetS, with mortality. Support for a
potential role of objective sleep duration as an effect modifier
comes from previous studies in insomnia23–27 and its
underlying mechanisms, including increased cortisol, cate-
cholaminergic activity, and impaired heart rate variability,27–36
which suggested that objective short sleep duration may play
a role in increasing cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality.
To test this novel hypothesis, we examined the effect
modification of objective sleep duration on the increased risk
of all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality associated with MetS in a
random, general population sample. We hypothesize that
objective short sleep duration increases the impact of MetS,
its components, and clusters on all-cause and CVD/CBV
mortality.
Methods
Participants
The data presented here were collected as part of the Penn
State Adult Cohort, a population-based study of sleep
disorders, which used a 2-phase protocol in order to recruit
participants from various age groups.37–39 In the first phase of
the study, telephone interviews were conducted with 16 583
age-eligible men and women with response rates of 73.5% and
74.1%, respectively. In the second phase, 741 men and 1000
women were randomly selected from the first phase and
studied in the sleep laboratory, with response rates of 67.8%
and 65.8%, respectively. Detailed descriptions of the sampling
procedure have been described elsewhere.23,37–39 After giving
a complete description of the study to the subjects, written
informed consent was obtained. The study protocol study
complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the institutional review board at the Pennsylvania State
University College of Medicine (Hershey, PA).
Mortality Follow-Up
Death certificates for deceased individuals as of December
31, 2013 were retrieved from the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Participants were linked by Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to death records from the
National Death Index for the years 1992–2013, and vital
status was determined through a rigorous process of
probabilistic matching and death certificate review based on
participant Social Security number, full name, date and state
of birth, sex, race/ethnicity, state of residence, and marital
status.40,41 Raw files retrieved from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention were abstracted and classified into
CVD and CBV mortality data. The primary underlying cause of
death was abstracted for case definition, which was classified
using International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision
and Tenth Revision for deaths occurring before 1998 and
deaths occurring in 1999 and beyond, respectively.42–44
CVD/CBV mortality was defined as International Classifica-
tion of Disease, Ninth Revision codes 390 to 459 and
International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes
I00 to I99.42–44 Data misclassification was avoided by
following standard guidelines and algorithms.45,46
Of the 1741 participants, a total of 1263 subjects were
alive at follow-up, 478 were deceased, and 195 died of CVD/
CBV causes. Duration of follow-up was calculated from the
time of the baseline evaluation to the date of death for those
deceased or to December 31, 2013 for those alive. Average
follow-up duration in the entire cohort was 16.7�4.6 years.

Metabolic Syndrome
As part of the physical examination during the subject’s sleep
laboratory visit at baseline, height (cm) and weight (kg) were
measured using a calibrated scale and body mass index was
calculated [body mass index=mass (kg)/(height(m)2)]. BP was
measured in the evening, around 2 hours before the start of
the sleep recording, using a pneumoelectric microprocessor-
controlled instrument with the appropriate-sized cuffs.23,39
The accuracy of this monitor is reported to be �3 mm Hg; in
addition, internal calibration was performed before each use,
and the machine was checked against a mercury sphygmo-
manometer at least annually. Recorded BP was the average of
3 consecutive readings during a 5-minute period following
10 minutes of rest in the supine position. Fasting glucose,
triglycerides, and total cholesterol levels were assayed from
blood drawn after the subjects’ sleep laboratory study. In the
present study, MetS was defined using National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute/American Heart Association modified
criteria1,47,48 as the presence of 3 or more of the following
components: (1) obesity, defined as a body mass index
≥30 kg/m28,49; (2) hypercholesterolemia, defined as fasting
total cholesterol levels ≥200 mg/dL50; (3) hypertriglyc-
eridemia, defined as fasting triglycerides levels ≥150 mg/
dL1; (4) glucose dysregulation, defined as fasting glucose
levels ≥100 mg/dL or receiving treatment for diabetes
mellitus1; and (5) elevated BP, defined as a systolic BP

 ≥130 mm Hg or a diastolic BP ≥85 mm Hg or on antihyper-
tensive medication.1
Our primary exposure was MetS defined by the presence of
3 or more of the cardiometabolic components listed above, as
compared to individuals without MetS (ie, 2 or less car-
diometabolic components). Our secondary exposures were
the MetS clusters resulting from the combination of at least 3
of the cardiometabolic components listed above and each of
the components examined individually.
Sleep Laboratory Evaluation
All subjects were evaluated for 1 night in the sleep laboratory
in sound-attenuated, light- and temperature-controlled rooms.
During this evaluation, each subject was continuously mon-
itored for 8 hours (fixed-time period) using 16-channel
polysomnography
(PSG),
including
electroencephalogram,
electrooculogram,
and
electromyogram.
Bedtimes
were
adjusted to conform to subjects’ usual bedtimes, and subjects
were recorded between 10:00 PM and 11: 00 PM and 6:00 AM
and 7:00 AM. Sleep recordings were subsequently scored
independently, according to standard criteria.51 Respiration
was monitored throughout the night by use of thermocouples
at the nose and mouth and thoracic strain gauges. All-night
recordings of hemoglobin oxygen saturation were obtained
with an oximeter attached to the finger. In this study, the
presence of SDB was defined as an apnea/hypopnea index
≥5.37,38 Of the 8 hours of sleep recording (ie, time in bed),
total sleep time was defined as the sum of time spent in
stages 1, 2, 3, 4, or rapid eye movement sleep since sleep
onset until sleep offset or lights on, whichever occurred first.
According to the distribution of PSG-measured total sleep
time, we categorized the entire study sample into 2 groups:
≥50th percentile (ie, ≥6 hours) and <50th percentile (ie,
<6 hours). This cutoff of <6 hours of sleep has previously
shown to be associated with significant cardiometabolic
morbidity and mortality.18–20,23,25–27
Other Measurements
All subjects completed a standardized questionnaire to assess
the presence of sleep disorders, physical health conditions,
mental health problems, and substance use. Baseline infor-
mation regarding the subject’s history of sleep difficulty (ie,
poor sleep defined as a moderate-to-severe complaint of
difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, early final
awakening, or unrefreshing sleep and insomnia defined as a
complaint
of
insomnia
with
a
duration
of
at
least
1 year),23,27,39 heart disease, stroke, and depression, includ-
ing a history of suicidal thoughts or attempts, were also
obtained.39 Participants’ daily consumption of caffeine (num-
ber of cups/day), tobacco (number of cigarettes/day), and
alcohol (number of drinks/day) as well as demographic
characteristics, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity, were
also obtained.
Statistical Analyses
Among the 1741 participants in this cohort, 397 had missing
data on cholesterol and/or triglycerides measures; therefore,
the effective sample size of this report was 1344 participants.
The original design of this study included oversampling of
specific subjects’ characteristics in order to increase preci-
sion of the risk estimates.37,38 Because of this sampling
strategy, numeric sampling weights were developed for the
analysis so that the estimates could be inferred to the original
target population.52–54 Commensurate with all previous
studies in this cohort, we adjusted for the sampling weight
in all of our statistical analyses, including those estimating the
prevalence of comorbidities and risk factors and the rates of
all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality. All data are reported
adjusted for sampling weight, except the observed number of
cases (N) across groups.
To assess the association between each cardiometabolic
component, their clustering, and the MetS with all-cause and
CVD/CBV mortality and the potential effect modification by
objective sleep duration,
multivariable Cox proportional
hazard models were used given that the proportionality
assumption was not violated. In all models, age, race, sex,
smoking, alcohol use, depression, insomnia, SDB, heart
disease, and stroke were treated as covariates and adjusted
for in the Cox multivariable models. When examining the
association of each of the MetS components (ie, obesity,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, glucose dysregu-
lation, and high BP) with mortality, all 5 components were
included in the same regression model to adjust for one
another as well as for the covariates mentioned above (ie,
age, race, sex, smoking, alcohol use, depression, insomnia,
SDB, heart disease, and stroke). Objective sleep duration was
also adjusted when investigating the overall effect of each
cardiometabolic component, their clustering, and the MetS on
all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality in the entire sample. To
assess the potential effect modification of objective sleep
duration in the association between MetS with all-cause and
CVD/CBV mortality, the significance of the interaction term
between MetS and objective sleep duration was examined in
Cox models. The association between MetS and mortality was
then evaluated in each objective sleep duration stratum (ie,
≥6 and <6 hours). In the process of analyzing the association
between MetS and CVD/CBV mortality, we observed a
significant interaction between age and sleep duration;
therefore, this interaction effect was controlled for in all
Cox models in which CVD/CBV mortality was the end point.
To further demonstrate the effect modification of objective

 sleep duration on the risk of all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality
associated with MetS, we projected the estimated survival
function across objective sleep duration groups, in which all
subgroups had identical demographic and clinical character-
istics (except, obviously, sleep duration and MetS status). The
projection was based on the aforementioned adjusted Cox
model together with the average sample characteristics
presented in Table 1. Furthermore, we examined the associ-
ation of MetS clusters, based on different combinations of
cardiometabolic components, with all-cause and CVD/CBV
mortality as well as its potential for effect modification by
objective sleep duration. All results derived from Cox models
are presented as multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs)
with their 95% CIs, adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking,
alcohol use, depression, insomnia, SDB, heart disease, and
stroke. As part of the statistical modeling, we tested for a
potential U-shaped relationship between objective sleep
duration and mortality by including its quadratic term in the
model, along with its lower ordered term; the quadratic term
was not significant, and therefore a U-shaped relationship for
PSG-measured sleep duration with mortality was not sup-
ported. A P≤0.05 was used to determine the significance for
all analyses. All analyses were conducted with SAS software
(version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
The demographic characteristics of the study population are
presented in Table 1. The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (14.2)
years, 57.8% were women and 9.5% black, with an overall
mortality rate of 22.0%. The prevalence of MetS was 39.2%.
Overall, those with MetS showed a significantly higher crude
mortality rate than those without MetS (32.7% versus 15.1%;
P<0.01). Mean (SD) objective sleep duration for the entire
sample was 5.9 (1.3) hours. On average, participants with
MetS slept half an hour less than those without MetS.
Objective short sleep duration was associated with all 5
cardiometabolic components (all P<0.05).
The association of each cardiometabolic component with
all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality, while controlling for
confounding variables, is shown in Table 2. The multivari-
able-adjusted risk of all-cause mortality associated with
elevated fasting glucose (HR=1.38; 95% CI=1.10–1.76) and
elevated BP (HR=1.43, 95% CI=1.12–1.84) were statistically
significant. The association of the number of cardiometabolic
components with all-cause mortality reached significance
when at least 3 components were present (HR=1.75; 95%
CI=1.18–2.61), with graded increase in effect size for
subjects with 4 or 5 cardiometabolic components (HR=1.79;
95% CI=1.01–3.20 and HR=2.24; 95% CI=1.32–3.79, respec-
tively). The pattern for these cardiometabolic components and
their clustering was similar for CVD/CBV mortality despite
decreased statistical power (the HRs [95% CI] for 3, 4, and 5
components were 1.27 [0.66–2.42], 1.51 [0.78–2.94], and
1.78 [0.74–4.29], respectively). In fact, as shown in Table 2,
individuals with MetS showed a 2-fold higher risk of all-cause
(HR=1.73; 95% CI=1.40–2.14) and CVD/CBV (HR=1.92; 95%
CI=1.35–2.74) mortality compared with those without MetS
after adjusting for all covariates (ie, age, race, sex, smoking,
alcohol use, depression, insomnia, SDB, heart disease, and
stroke).
To test whether objective sleep duration modified the
association of MetS with mortality, we examined the interac-
tion between MetS and objective sleep duration and it was
statistically significant (P<0.05); therefore, the association
between MetS and mortality was evaluated for each objective
sleep duration stratum while adjusting for all covariates. When
we examined the multivariable-adjusted risk stratified by
objective short sleep duration, we observed that the HRs of
all-cause mortality associated with MetS were 1.29 (95%
CI=0.89–1.87) and 1.99 (95% CI=1.53–2.59) for subjects who
slept ≥6 and <6 hours, respectively. The risk of CVD/CBV
mortality associated with MetS as a function of objective
short sleep duration was 1.49 (95% CI=0.75–2.97) and 2.10
(95% CI=1.39–3.16) for subjects who slept ≥6 and <6 hours,
respectively. To graphically illustrate this effect modification
of the association of MetS with all-cause and CVD/CBV
mortality by objective short sleep duration, we projected the
survival curves in those with and without MetS across
objective sleep duration groups with identical demographic
(ie, 48.8 years old; 42.2% male, 9.5% black) and clinical
characteristics (ie, 9.1% with a history of heart disease, 1.6%
with a history of stroke, 7.6% SDB, 7.5% insomnia, 22.4%
smoker, 1.1 alcoholic drinks/day, and 17.0% depression). As
shown in the Figure, the survival functions for participants
who slept ≥6 with and without MetS were similar (P=0.19 and
0.25, for all cause and CVD/CBV, respectively), whereas the
survival functions were significantly worse in those with MetS
among participants who slept <6 hours (both P<0.01).
Furthermore, given that not all individuals with MetS have
the same cluster of cardiometabolic components, we exam-
ined the association of different MetS clusters with all-cause
and CVD/CBV mortality in the overall sample as well as
stratified by objective sleep duration. Participants with MetS
who only had obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyc-
eridemia (n=34) were not at significant increased risk of
mortality as compared to those without MetS (HR=0.40; 95%
CI=0.02–6.19) and thus were merged into 1 reference group
also because of the small sample size. As shown in Table 3,
compared with the reference group, the risk of all-cause
mortality was significantly increased in those participants with
MetS clusters of (1) elevated BP and 2 or 3 other compo-
nents, but without elevated fasting glucose (HR=1.75; 95%
CI=1.16–2.64), (2) elevated fasting glucose and BP with 1 or 2

 other components (HR=1.46; 95% CI=0.96–2.32), and (3) with
both fasting glucose and BP elevated
(HR=1.76; 95%
CI=1.40–2.22). We tested the interaction between the MetS
clusters and objective sleep duration and it was statistically
significant (P=0.01); therefore, the association between each
MetS cluster and all-cause mortality was stratified by
objective sleep duration. As shown in Table 3, the strength
of the association between each MetS cluster with all-cause
mortality was significantly higher in those who slept <6 hours.

Discussion
This is the first study to demonstrate that objectively
measured short sleep duration modifies the increased risk
of all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality associated with MetS.
This increased risk is independent of other factors frequently
associated with MetS, mortality, or objective sleep duration
such as age, sex, smoking, or SDB. Important, this effect
modification was primarily driven by the high BP and glucose
dysregulation components of MetS, which indicates that
objective short sleep duration in persons with MetS may be
related to the degree of central autonomic and metabolic
dysfunction. Future studies should examine the pathophysi-
ology of MetS with objective short sleep duration, whereas
future clinical trials should examine whether lengthening
sleep improves the prognosis of individuals with MetS.
Most previous studies have focused on examining the
independent association of sleep duration, typically measured
by self-report, with cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality,
and the results have been inconsistent and modest.15–20,55–57
In the vast majority of those studies, no PSG measures were
obtained, and therefore the potential confounder of SDB was
not controlled for and the role of objective short sleep
duration not examined. Most important, none of the previous

 studies conceptualized sleep duration as an effect modifier,
so that the added cardiovascular risk that it comprises and its
potential mechanistic role can be ascertained. All these issues
were addressed in the present study.
As expected, individuals with MetS were associated with a
significant increased risk of all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality
in the present study.58 When we stratified this risk by
objectively measured short sleep duration, we showed a
strong and significant association of MetS with mortality.
Among individuals who slept <6 hours, those with MetS were
associated with an increased 2.0-fold risk of all-cause and
CVD/CBV mortality. In contrast, among individuals who slept
≥6 hours, those with MetS were not at a significant increased
risk of all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality (1.3- and 1.5-fold,
respectively) compared to those without MetS. The survival
functions presented in Figure pinpoint this effect modification
in terms of the expected mortality rate across individuals with
similar demographic (eg, age, sex, and race) and clinical
characteristics (eg, prevalence of smoking, SDB, diabetes
mellitus, and depression) and reveal that the survival curves
for participants with and without MetS who slept ≥6 hours
were not significantly different, whereas for participants who
slept <6 hours there was a strong significant difference.
Together, these findings indicate that (1) the impact of MetS
on mortality among those who sleep ≥6 hours is negligible or,
at best, modest and (2) objective short sleep duration should
be considered when estimating the risk of mortality associ-
ated with MetS.
Although the MetS is a meaningful combination of
individual cardiometabolic risk factors, there is heterogeneity
in such combination and, thus, different MetS clusters exist.
Accumulating evidence from previous studies shows that
specific MetS clusters or triads confer the greatest risk of
incident CVD, CVB, and mortality.7,59–61 For example, in the
Framingham Heart Study, individuals who developed MetS by
first having a cluster of central obesity, high BP, and glucose
dysregulation had the greatest risk of incident CVD and
mortality compared with other MetS triads,61 whereas in the
ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study, the
greatest risk of incident atherosclerotic coronary artery
disease59 and ischemic stroke7 was observed in individuals
with MetS clusters in which high BP or glucose dysregulation
were present.7,59 Consistently, we found in the present study
that MetS clusters with increased risk of all-cause and CVD/
CBV mortality, approximately 2-fold, were those in which high
BP or glucose dysregulation combined with high BP were
present. Of outmost importance, we found that this increased
risk of all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality associated with MetS
clusters was significantly modified by objective short sleep
duration; specifically, 2.2- and 2.5-fold among those who slept
<6 hours and had glucose dysregulation or high BP, respec-
tively. In fact, when examined individually each of the
cardiometabolic components, those of obesity, hypercholes-
terolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia did not show a significant
effect modification by objective sleep duration on mortality.
These novel findings have important pathophysiological and
clinical implications.
That objective short sleep duration modified the risk of all-
cause and CVD/CBV mortality primarily in persons with MetS
who had high BP or glucose dysregulation, but not solely
central obesity or atherogenic dyslipidemia suggests that
objective short sleep may be related to the degree of central
autonomic and metabolic dysfunction. It is well-known that
multiple hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei and networks are
shared by the autonomic and sleep/arousal-regulating sys-
tems62; in fact, there is a tight link between sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity and rapid eye movement and non–
rapid eye movement sleep, respectively.62 Also, hypothalamic

 and brainstem networks involved in sleep/arousal regulation
are also an integral part of the central regulation of short- and
long-term energy balance and metabolism.63 This hypothesis
is consistent with recent studies showing that objective short
sleep duration modifies in a similar manner not only the
association of insomnia with subclinical markers,27–36 but
also cardiometabolic risk factors and mortality,23–27 suggest-
ing that objective short sleep duration, rather than subjective
sleep complaints, is a key factor in CVD/CBV risk.27 Thus, the
results of the present study further expand the proposal that
objective short sleep duration in the context of conditions
associated with sympathetic activation and glucose dysreg-
ulation is a modifiable risk factor for CVD/CBV morbidity and
mortality.
Overall, our findings further indicate that clinical efforts to
reduce the burden of MetS in the general and clinical
population should continue to target primarily the 2 MetS
components of high BP and glucose dysregulation7,59,60 and,
additionally, objective short sleep duration. Future experimen-
tal studies should examine the central and peripheral mech-
anisms that may differentiate patients with the MetS who sleep
≥6 hours versus those who sleep <6 hours, given the strong
effect modification on mortality found in this study. Further-
more, future clinical trials should examine whether lengthening
sleep improves the prognosis of individuals with the MetS.
Some limitations should be taken into account when
interpreting our results. First, we had to rely on modified
criteria for the definition of the MetS given that measures of
waist circumference and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
were not available in the Penn State Adult Cohort; however,
we used body mass index ≥30 as a surrogate marker of
central obesity, which is consistent with World Health
Organization criteria and other previous studies,8,49 and we
used total cholesterol levels ≥200 mg/dL as a surrogate
marker of atherogenic dyslipidemia based on clinical crite-
ria.50 The validity of our definition is supported by the fact that
the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly increased
when 3 or more cardiometabolic components were present,
and that the prevalence of MetS in the present study (37.4%)
was very similar (35–40%) to that reported in other previous
large, population-based studies in the United States,1,7,47
including the prevalence of its clusters, such as the one of
obesity,
hypercholesterolemia,
and
hypertriglyceridemia,
which was around 2% and consistent with that reported in
the ARIC study.7 Second, there were substantial missing data
in cholesterol and triglycerides measures; however, the
results did not significantly change in our sensitivity analyses
(data not shown), in which we imputed the missing data by
using a predictive mean matching method. Third, the objective
sleep duration in this study was based on 1 night of PSG,
which may be affected by the “first night effect”; however, we
and others have recently shown that measures of sleep
continuity, such as objective sleep duration based on 3
consecutive nights or 2 single-night recordings separated by
several years, are stable and reflect a person’s habitual sleep
under lab conditions and that a single night in the laboratory
is useful for reliably classifying individuals as short sleep-
ers.64,65 Nevertheless, future studies should explore the
association between MetS, sleep duration, and mortality using
multiple night recordings. Fourth, we did not have the ability
to assess the potential effect of circadian dysregulation to the
associations found either by self-reported (ie, circadian
preference), objective (ie, actigraphy-measured sleep mid-
point), or physiological (ie, dim light melatonin onset)
methods. Given the known circadian regulation of cardiovas-
cular functions and metabolism,62 future studies should
examine whether the increased risk of mortality associated
with MetS is increased under circadian misalignment. Fifth,

 we examined both all-cause and CVD/CBV mortality; however,
some of the associations found for CVD/CBV mortality were
compromised by the relatively small sample size (n=195) and
decreased statistical power when stratifying the risk by
objective short sleep duration. Nevertheless, the associations
found had the expected effect sizes, which provide confidence
regarding the reliability and validity of our findings. Sixth, we
did not have physical activity data available in this cohort,
which did not allow controlling for the potential effect of
sedentary behavior in the associations found. Future studies
should overcome this limitation. Finally, although the Penn
State Adult Cohort is a representative random sample of
central Pennsylvania, it was predominantly white (88.2%) with
9.5% blacks, 0.7% Hispanics, and 1.6% “other” ethnicities; such
over-representation as compared with the US population54
limits the generalizability of our results and did not allow us to
examine how the associations found vary by race/ethnicity.
In summary, the risk of mortality associated with the MetS
is significantly higher in those with objective short sleep
duration. Given the high prevalence of the MetS in the general
population and the need to more accurately predict its
prognosis, the introduction of novel, modifiable factors should
become the target of public health policy. Individuals with
MetS who demonstrate objective short sleep duration may
suffer from greater central autonomic and metabolic dysreg-
ulation and be at greater risk of mortality. Finally, our findings
indicate that individuals with the MetS, particularly those
reporting symptoms of SDB in order to rule out the condition,
and those reporting symptoms of insomnia in order to
quantify the degree of objective sleep duration, should
undergo a sleep study.
