Background-—Angina has important implications for patients’ quality of life and healthcare utilization. Angina management after
acute myocardial infarction (MI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unknown.
Methods and Results-—TRANSLATE-ACS (Treatment With Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of
Treatment Patterns and Events After Acute Coronary Syndrome) was a longitudinal study of MI patients treated with percutaneous
coronary intervention at 233 US hospitals from 2010 to 2012. Among patients with self-reported angina at 6 weeks post-MI, we
described patterns of angina and antianginal medication use through 1 year postdischarge. Of 10 870 percutaneous coronary
intervention–treated MI patients, 3190 (29.3%) reported angina symptoms at 6 weeks post-MI; of these, 658 (20.6%) had daily/
weekly angina while 2532 (79.4%) had monthly angina. Among patients with 6-week angina, 2936 (92.0%) received b-blockers
during the 1 year post-MI, yet only 743 (23.3%) were treated with other antianginal medications. At 1 year, 1056 patients (33.1%)
with 6-week angina reported persistent angina symptoms. Of these, only 31.2% had been prescribed non–b-blocker antianginal
medications at any time in the past year. Among patients undergoing revascularization during follow-up, only 25.9% were on ≥1
non–b-blocker anti-anginal medication at the time of the procedure.
Conclusions-—Angina is present in one third of percutaneous coronary intervention–treated MI patients as early as 6 weeks after
discharge, and many of these patients have persistent angina at 1 year. Non–b-blocker antianginal medications are infrequently
used in these patients, even among those with persistent angina and those undergoing revascularization. (J Am Heart Assoc.

M
ore than 1.5 million Americans have myocardial
infarctions (MI) each year, and many of these patients
continue to have angina symptoms with important implica-
tions for patient quality of life and healthcare utilization.1,2
Patients with angina are more likely to report limited physical
function and depression, and are more likely to be rehospi-
talized within 1 year of their index MI.3–6
The principal treatment goal for these patients is control of
angina symptoms, and 4 classes of medications are approved
for the treatment of angina in the United States—b-blockers,
calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and ranolazine.7 Percuta-
neous coronary intervention (PCI) is also indicated for
management of angina symptoms that cannot be controlled
with optimal medical therapy.8,9 b-Blockers reduce mortality
in patients with acute MI, and are thus recommended as first-
line therapy for patients with angina. For patients with angina
despite b-blocker treatment, guidelines recommend adding
additional
non–b-blocker
antianginal
medications

 stepwise manner before proceeding to PCI for refractory
angina.9 The prevalence of non–b-blocker antianginal medi-
cation use among patients with post-MI angina has not been
well described, and it is unclear whether providers adhere to
these guidelines.
In TRANSLATE-ACS (Treatment With Adenosine Diphos-
phate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treat-
ment Patterns and Events After Acute Coronary Syndrome),
investigators collected longitudinal information on patient-
reported angina and antianginal medication use for patients
initially hospitalized with an acute MI that was treated with
PCI. This offered a unique opportunity to describe the
prevalence and longitudinal patterns of post-MI angina as
well as antianginal medication(s) used in its treatment.
Methods
Data Source and Patient Population
The
design
of
TRANSLATE-ACS
has
been
previously
reported.10 TRANSLATE-ACS was a multicenter observational
study that examined longitudinal antiplatelet use, effective-
ness, and safety among MI patients treated with PCI. Patients
were enrolled from April 2010 through October 2012. Eligible
patients were ≥18 years old, diagnosed with ST-segment
elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation MI, treated
with PCI, discharged on a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel,
prasugrel, ticlopidine, or ticagrelor), and able to provide
consent for long-term follow-up.
TRANSLATE-ACS enrolled 12 365 patients. Since our study
focused on patterns of postdischarge angina and antianginal
treatment, we excluded patients (n=14) who died in the
hospital and those missing data on angina frequency at
6 weeks (n=1481), yielding a final study population of 10 870
patients (Figure 1). Descriptive characteristics of patients
with missing data on 6-week angina frequency are presented
in Table S1. Analyses of anti-angina medication use were
performed on the 3190 (29%) patients who reported angina
symptoms within 6 weeks after MI diagnosis.
All patients enrolled in TRANSLATE-ACS provided written
informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by
the ethics committee or institutional review board of each
participating site.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Nearly 30% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention for myocardial infarction reported angina
6 weeks later, and one third of these patients continued
to have angina at 12-month follow-up.
• Fewer than 25% of patients with angina 6 weeks after
percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarc-
tion were treated with a non–b-blocker anti-anginal medi-
cation at any time over 12-month follow-up.
• Treatment with non–b-blocker anti-anginal medications was
infrequent even in patients with persistent or severe angina,
and those undergoing revascularization.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Strategies to increase provider awareness of angina burden
coupled with symptom-driven management, including pre-
scription of anti-anginal medications, should be explored.

Data Collection and Definitions
During each patient’s index MI admission, hospitals collected
information on baseline demographic and clinical characteris-
tics, processes of care, discharge medications, and in-hospital
outcomes according to the standardized set of data elements
and definitions used by the National Cardiovascular Data
Registry CathPCI Registry. Patients with multivessel coronary
artery disease (≥50% stenosis in >1 epicardial coronary artery)
who did not undergo multivessel PCI were defined as having
incomplete revascularization. Patients were contacted by
telephone at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 15 months
postdischarge, at which time they were asked about current
medications and angina symptoms using the Seattle Angina
Questionnaire (SAQ) angina frequency questions (related to
angina frequency and nitroglycerin use; see Data S1).
Responses were summed to derive the SAQ angina frequency
score.11 Scores were then classified into the following
categories: no angina (100 points), monthly angina (70–90
points), weekly angina (40–60 points), or daily angina (0–30
points).12 Patients were also asked about rehospitalizations or
coronary
revascularization
procedures.
Rehospitalizations
were verified by the collection of medical bills and/or medical
records; unplanned revascularizations were independently
validated by study physicians based on review of medical
records for PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)
procedures and excluded electively staged revascularization
procedures.13 During the 6-week follow-up phone call, patients
also completed the EuroQOL 5 dimensions quality of life
questionnaire, which asks about mobility, self-care, ability to do
usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression symptoms, and
includes an overall quality of life visual analogue scale.
Statistical Analysis
Patients were grouped according to presence of angina
6 weeks following PCI for MI. Descriptive statistics are
reported as median (25th, 75th percentiles) for continuous
variables and frequency (percent) for categorical variables.
For continuous variables, differences between groups were
compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For categorical
variables, differences between groups were assessed using
the v2 or Fisher exact test.
We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify
factors associated with 6-week angina. Variables entered into
the model included sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race,
insurance [private, government, versus none], marital status,
education level [college and above, high school, versus less
than high school], and employment status), clinical history
(prior MI, prior PCI, prior CABG, extracardiac vascular disease
[peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease], diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, and current/recent smoker), presen-
tation features (MI type [STEMI versus non-ST-segment
elevation MI], body mass index, glomerular filtration rate, left
ventricular ejection fraction, and heart failure signs/symp-
toms), angiographic/procedural characteristics (number of
diseased coronary arteries, PCI of a previously stented culprit
lesion, drug-eluting stent use, and completeness of revascu-
larization [incomplete defined as multivessel coronary artery
disease without multivessel PCI]), and number of discharge
antianginal medications. After forward selection of variables,
we refit the logistic regression model using generalized
estimating equations to account for within-hospital clustering,
and calculated a c-statistic. Among patients with 6-week
angina, we repeated this process to identify factors associ-
ated with persistent angina at 12 months.
We reported the proportion of patients taking antianginal
medications at 6-week, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up.
Preprocedural rates of antianginal medication use were
described for patients who underwent unplanned coronary
revascularization. Among patients with 6-week angina who
continued to have angina through 12 months, we performed
multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated
with prescription of non–b-blocker antianginal medications at
any time. Variables entered into the model were the same as
those used to predict 6-week angina, with the addition of
6-week and 6-month SAQ angina frequency scores.
Results
Baseline Characteristics Associated With 6-Week
Angina
In the final study population of 10 870 PCI-treated MI patients,
3190 (29.3%) reported angina within the first 6 weeks after
discharge. Of patients with angina, 85 (2.7%) had daily angina,
573 (18.0%) had weekly angina, and 2532 (79.3%) had angina
less than once a week but at least once a month. Compared
with patients without 6-week angina, patients with angina were
younger, more often black, and uninsured with lower education
levels (Table). They more often had prior MI or prior coronary
revascularization; they were more likely to be smoking at the
time of their index MI but did not have a higher prevalence of
diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Patients with angina at
6 weeks had no significant differences in MI type (STEMI versus
non-ST-segment elevation MI), the location of their culprit
lesion, left ventricular ejection fraction, or the prevalence of
multivessel disease compared with patients without angina.
The extent of PCI was similar between groups; patients who
reported angina at 6 weeks were not significantly more likely to
have incomplete revascularization than patients without

 angina. Rates of guideline-directed secondary prevention
medication use at discharge were similar between groups.
Calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrates, and ranolazine
were infrequently prescribed at discharge: 6.6%, 4.9%, and
0.6%, respectively.
On multivariable modeling, independent factors associated
with angina at 6 weeks following PCI for MI included younger
age, female sex, black race, history of revascularization (PCI
or CABG) before the index PCI, lower education level,
unemployment, and lack of health insurance (Figure 2).
Compared with patients without angina, patients with
angina at 6 weeks were more likely to report problems with
mobility (26.5% versus 19.8%), washing and dressing (10.2%
versus 7.1%), performing usual activities (30.9% versus 23.4%),
moderate or extreme pain (42.1% versus 30.1%), and moderate
or extreme anxiety/depression (34.8% versus 23.9%; P<0.001
for all comparisons) at their 6-week interview. Median EuroQOL
5 dimensions visual analogue scale score was lower (indicating
worse overall quality of life) in patients with 6-week angina than
in those without (70 versus 75, P<0.001).
Temporal Patterns of Angina Over Follow-Up
Of the 3190 patients reporting angina within 6 weeks
following PCI for MI, 2891 answered SAQ questions at
6 months. Of these 2891 patients, 1287 (44.5%) had angina
at 6 months; of these patients, 57 (4.4%) had daily angina,
268 (20.8%) had weekly angina, and 962 (74.7%) had monthly
angina. At 12 months, data on angina frequency were
available for 2715 patients with 6-week angina; 1056
(38.9%) of these patients continued to have angina at
12 months; 47 (4.5%) had daily angina, 232 (22.0%) had
weekly angina, and 777 (73.6%) had monthly angina. Char-
acteristics of patients with missing angina frequency at 6 and
12 months are included in Tables S2 and S3, respectively.
The strongest predictors of persistent angina at 12 months
among patients with angina at 6 weeks included younger age
(odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.25 per
5-year decrease) and daily or weekly angina at 6 weeks (odds
ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.74). The full list of
covariates associated with persistent angina on multivariable
modeling is in Figure S1.
Among patients without 6-week angina (N = 7680), 994
(12.9%) had angina at 6 months; of these patients, 146
(14.7%) had daily/weekly angina, and 848 (85.3%) had
monthly angina. Eight hundred forty-five (11.0%) patients
without angina at 6 weeks had angina at 12 months—125
(14.8%) daily/weekly and 720 (85.2%) monthly.
Temporal Patterns of Anti-Anginal Medication
Use Over Follow-Up
Of patients with 6-week angina, 92.0% reported taking

were prescribed ranolazine at 6 weeks, 6 months, and

When stratified by angina frequency, only 15.6% of patients
who reported monthly angina at 6 weeks were treated with
non–b-blocker antianginal medications; 2.1% of these patients
were on 2 or more non–b-blocker antianginal medications.
Among patients with daily or weekly angina, 24.0% were
treated with non–b-blocker antianginal medications and 5.0%
were taking 2 or more medications. Over the course of follow-
up, the proportion of patients taking 1, 2, or 3 non–b-blocker
antianginal medications increased modestly both for patients
with monthly and daily/weekly angina (Figure 4, top panel).
When stratified by sublingual nitroglycerin use, 104 of 303
patients (34.4%) who reported using sublingual nitroglycerin
≥1 time per week at 6 weeks were treated with at least 1
non–b-blocker antianginal medication, compared with 449 of
2873 patients (15.6%) who used <1 time per week (Figure 4,
bottom panel). Over the course of follow-up, the proportion of
patients taking 1, 2, or 3 non–b-blocker antianginal medica-
tions increased modestly for patients who used sublingual

 continued angina over the entirety of follow-up, the factor
most strongly associated with use of non–b-blocker antiang-
inal medication at any time during 1-year follow-up was
prescription of a non–b-blocker antianginal medication at the
time of discharge after the index event (odds ratio 29.7, 95%
confidence interval, 16.7–52.9). Only 15% of patients were
prescribed non–b-blocker antianginal medications at the time
of discharge, but these patients comprised 45% of patients
prescribed these medications at any time over the course of
follow-up. Other factors associated with use of non–b-blocker
antianginal medications included hypertension, number of
diseased vessels, advanced age, more severe angina, female
sex, and prior revascularization (Figure 5, C-index=0.83).
Antianginal Medications and Coronary
Revascularization
Overall, 381 of 3190 patients (11.9%) with 6-week angina
underwent symptom-driven, unplanned PCI or CABG in the
12 months following their index MIs. Median time to revas-
cularization was 156 (25th, 75th percentiles: 85–284) days.
At the time of revascularization, 330 (86.6%) of these patients
were taking b-blockers, but only 99 patients (25.9%) were
prescribed
a
non–b-blocker
antianginal
medication;
73
(19.2%), 23 (6.0%), and 3 (0.8%) were taking 1, 2, and 3
non–b-blocker antianginal medications, respectively.
Discussion
In this national study of MI patients treated with PCI, we
observed a high incidence of post-PCI angina at 6 weeks, with
a substantial proportion persisting through 1 year. While most
post-MI patients were treated with b-blockers, non–b-blocker
antianginal medications were used infrequently; 24.0% of
patients with daily or weekly angina at 6 weeks and 31.2% of
patients with persistent angina through 1 year after the index
MI reported taking non–b-blocker antianginal medications.
Notably, less than one third of patients who returned for
symptom-driven unplanned coronary revascularization were
treated with a non–b-blocker antianginal medication before
their procedure.
The incidence of patient-reported post-MI angina in our
study is lower than prior reports. In the PREMIER (Prospective
Registry Evaluating Outcomes After Myocardial Infarction:
Events and Recovery) and TRIUMPH (Translational Research
Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial
Infarction Patients’ Health Status) registries, �20% of patients
reported angina 12 months following MI, compared with
�10% in TRANSLATE-ACS.1,5 The lower prevalence of angina
at 12 months in TRANSLATE-ACS may be because of all
patients in TRANSLATE-ACS undergoing PCI for MI; rates of
PCI were 70.3% and 67.8% in PREMIER and TRIUMPH,
respectively. In PREMIER and TRIUMPH, younger, nonwhite
patients were more likely to have angina than older, white
patients; and calcium channel blockers and nitrates (including
sublingual nitroglycerin) were prescribed to 12% and 51% of
patients with angina, respectively.1 In our study, younger age,
female sex, nonwhite race, and lack of private health
insurance were the strongest predictors of 6-week angina,
and were also strong predictors of persistent angina at
12 months among patients with 6-week angina. Revascular-
ization before the index PCI was the only baseline clinical
factor associated with angina following the index PCI; this
finding is consistent with the importance of the extent and
severity of coronary artery disease in determining angina
burden. Patients with more severe angina at 6 weeks were
also more likely to have persistent angina at 12 months.

 Incomplete revascularization following PCI was not associated
with 6-week angina; though this finding is somewhat surpris-
ing, it is consistent with the low prevalence of angina
following PCI with incomplete revascularization in the RIVER-
PCI (Ranolazine in patients with incomplete revascularization
after percutaneous coronary intervention) clinical trial.14
Among patients with 6-week angina, prescription of non–b-
blocker antianginal medications at the time of index discharge
was associated with persistent angina at 12 months; this
finding is likely because of confounding by indication, as
patients with more severe and chronic angina are likely to be
prescribed non–b-blocker anti-anginal medications.
Though our study showed a lower prevalence of angina
than the PREMIER and TRIUMPH registries, the prevalence of
angina was higher early post-PCI, and a considerable propor-
tion of these patients continued to have angina and/or
underwent symptom-driven unplanned coronary revascular-
ization through the first year, especially among patients with
more severe angina at 6 weeks. The fact that use of non–b-
blocker antianginal medications was low at 6 months,
12 months, and at the time of unplanned revascularization
in the cohort of patients that had persistent angina since their
PCI demonstrates low provider adherence to guideline
recommendations
recommending
stepwise
escalation
of
medical antianginal therapy. Low use of non–b-blocker
antianginal medications in these patients with angina likely
contributes to the persistence of angina symptoms. Though
most angina patients in our study had infrequent symptoms,
and these patients may prefer to treat their infrequent
symptoms with short-acting nitroglycerin as needed, <40% of
patients with daily or weekly angina that persisted for
12 months following index PCI for MI were treated with
non–b-blocker antianginal medications.
Underutilization of non–b-blocker antianginal medications
in our population may be related to several factors. Effective
angina treatment requires that clinicians recognize angina
symptoms in their patients; yet multiple studies have
demonstrated gaps in symptom recognition.3,15,16 In 1 study
of patients with long-term stable angina, 46% of patients with
monthly angina and 26% of patients with daily or weekly
angina were noted to have no angina by their physicians, and
there was considerable variability between physicians in their
recognition of patients’ angina, with rates of under-recogni-
tion ranging from 0% to >90%.16 In the same cohort of
patients, just over half of patients reporting daily or weekly
angina were treated with ≥2 antianginal medications, but the
range of patients receiving more than 1 antianginal medica-
tion ranged from 0% to 100% across practice sites.17 In an
internet study of patients with chronic angina, >10% of
patients with daily or weekly angina and 25% of patients with
monthly angina did not discuss their symptoms with their
physician.18 A gap between patient-reported symptoms and
physician-guided treatment of those symptoms is common in
chronic diseases, in which treatment decisions critically
depend on adequate communication between patients and
healthcare providers.19–21
In addition, physicians may fail to recognize the importance
of treating angina or the effectiveness of existing antianginal
medications, as evidenced by consistent lack of treatment,
even in the face of very frequent or persistent symptoms.
Despite guidelines recommending use of at least 2 classes of
antianginal medications (a b-blocker plus 1 additional agent)
for patients with chronic angina,9 there is no evidence that
non–b-blocker antianginal medications reduce cardiovascular
mortality or clinical events in the post-MI setting. However, all
3 classes of non–b-blocker antianginal medications increase
exercise duration and time to electrocardiographic ischemia
in patients with stable angina.22–25 We found that patients
with angina have worse quality of life across multiple domains
than those without angina, and antianginal medications may
help patients increase activity level and exercise capacity,
and, in turn, improve quality of life.1,26,27 Angina is also the
factor most strongly associated with hospitalization within the
12 months following an index MI.2,6,28 Furthermore, there
may be cost or logistical barriers to the prescription of
ranolazine, which is not yet available in generic form; however,
low rates of prescription of nitrates and calcium channel
blockers argue against cost being a major driver of this
finding. Lastly, treatment inertia may be playing a role: Among
patients with angina over the entirety of the study period,
those who were treated with a non–b-blocker antianginal
medication at the time of their index MI discharge were 30-
fold more likely to take antianginal medications at any point
than those who were not treated with a non–b-blocker
antianginal medication at the time of index MI discharge.
Variability in practice between clinicians suggests room for
improvement in angina management, perhaps by addressing
the communication gap between patients and providers. In 1
single-center study, treating patients with angina in a
dedicated “angina clinic” with monthly visits and scripted
questions regarding angina severity and activity level resulted
in clinically meaningful improvements in angina frequency and
quality of life compared with usual care.29 Provider education
strategies to enhance patient–physician communication and
improve angina management are needed, perhaps especially
for younger and female patients, who are more likely to report
angina at 6 weeks and persistent angina at 12 months, and
are less likely to receive medical anti-anginal therapy.
Limitations
This analysis is limited to patient-reported angina, and it is
unknown whether these patients have objective myocardial
ischemia that would benefit from use of medical antianginal

 therapy. Participants were only asked the SAQ’s 2 questions
about angina frequency; answers to questions from the SAQ’s
other domains—physical limitation (though this was collected
as part of the EuroQOL 5 dimensions), angina stability,
treatment satisfaction, and disease perception—were not
collected. Participants were not asked about dyspnea, which
is not well captured by the SAQ and may be an anginal
equivalent; this study may thus underestimate the true
prevalence of residual angina in the TRANSLATE-ACS popula-
tion. Moreover, we excludedpatients with missing angina status
at 6 weeks; compared with patients with known angina status,
these patients were younger, more frequentlywomen,and more
frequently had government insurance—all variables associated
withanginaamongpatientswithknownanginastatus.Ifpatients
with missing angina were more likely to have angina than those
with known angina status, as might be predicted from patient
characteristics, our study would underestimate the prevalence
of residual angina in the post-PCI population. In addition,
hypertensionwasassociatedwithprescriptionofnon–b-blocker
anti-anginal therapy at 12 months among patients with 6-week
angina; since calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates
are also used as antihypertensive agents, this suggests that
cliniciansmaynothaverecognizedanginaeveninsomepatients
who were treated with non–b-blocker anti-anginal medications.
Though such patients would be treated with non–b-blocker anti-
anginal medications, they may not have their anti-anginal
medications titrated as aggressively as patients purposefully
treated for angina. Further, exercise frequency and tolerance
were not captured in TRANSLATE-ACS, and it is possible that
patients reporting angina in our study were actually more
physically active than patients without angina, and that their
physical activity unmasked angina; however, the higher fre-
quencyofdifficulty withmobility, self-care, usual activities, pain,
and anxiety/depression among patients with angina argues
against thispossibility.Regardless,anginahaseffectsonquality
of life beyond limiting physical activity, and it remains important
to treat patients’ symptoms. Lastly, we do not report on
outcomes related to use or escalation of non–b-blocker
antianginal medications; any outcomes analysis would be
limited by substantial confounding by indication. Without
knowing about care processes contributing to underuse of
antianginals, outcomescomparisons betweentreatment strate-
gies may be flawed.
Conclusion
Angina is present in �30% of PCI-treated MI patients as early
as 6 weeks after discharge, and persists at 1 year in many of
these patients. Despite national guidelines, non–b-blocker
antianginal medications are infrequently used in these
patients in contemporary practice. Strategies to increase
awareness of angina burden coupled with symptom-driven
management to permit patient-centric improvement in out-
comes should be explored.

Data S1. Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency Questions*  
Angina frequency scores were determined based on two questions, one regarding angina 
frequency and one regarding nitroglycerin use. Points for each question were added and 
multiplied by a factor of 10 to derive the Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency score. 
Scores were then classified into the following categories: no angina (100 points), monthly angina 
(70–90 points), or daily/weekly angina (0–60 points). 
 1. Angina frequency: In the last month, on average, how often did you experience chest 
discomfort or angina (symptoms similar to your heart attack)?  
 More than once daily (0)  
 Once daily (1)  
 Several times a week but not every day (2)  
 Once a week (3)  
 Less than once a week (4)  
 None in the past month (5)  
2. Nitroglycerin use: In the last month, on average, how many times have you had to use nitros 
(nitroglycerin tablets) for your chest discomfort or angina?  
 More than once daily (0)  
 Once daily (1)  
 Several times a week but not every day (2)  
 Once a week (3)  
 Less than once a week (4)
