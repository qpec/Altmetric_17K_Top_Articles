* Adults were asked if they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and, if yes, whether they currently 
smoked cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all. Those who smoked every day or some days were classified 
as current cigarette smokers. Adults who had not smoked 100 cigarettes were classified as never cigarette 
smokers. Adults who had smoked 100 cigarettes but were not smoking at the time of interview were classified 
as former cigarette smokers. Percentages are shown with 95% confidence intervals. 
† Current e-cigarette use was based on responses of “every day” or “some days” to the question, “Do you currently 
use electronic cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?” asked of adults who had ever tried an e-cigarette, 
even one time. 
§ Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population 
aged ≥18 years and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey sample adult component. 
In 2015, 3.5% of U.S. adults were current e-cigarette users. Among adult e-cigarette users overall, 58.8% also were current cigarette 
smokers, 29.8% were former cigarette smokers, and 11.4% had never been cigarette smokers. Among current e-cigarette users 
aged ≥45 years, 98.7% were either current or former cigarette smokers, and 1.3% had never been cigarette smokers. In contrast, 
among current e-cigarette users aged 18–24 years, 40.0% had never been cigarette smokers.
