Immunotherapy with therapeutic antibodies has increased survival for patients with
hematologic and solid cancers. Still, a significant fraction of patients fails to respond
to therapy or acquire resistance. Understanding and overcoming mechanisms of
resistance to antibody drugs, and in particular those common to antibody drugs
as a class, is therefore highly warranted and holds promise to improve response
rates, duration of response and potentially overall survival. Activating and inhibitory
Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) are known to coordinately regulate therapeutic activity
of tumor direct-targeting antibodies. Similar, but also divergent, roles for FcγRs in
controlling efficacy of immune modulatory antibodies e.g., checkpoint inhibitors have
been indicated from mouse studies, and were recently implicated in contributing to
efficacy in the human clinical setting. Here we discuss evidence and mechanisms
by which Fc gamma receptors–the “antibody checkpoints”–regulate antibody-induced
antitumor immunity. We further discuss how targeted blockade of the sole known
inhibitory antibody checkpoint FcγRIIB may help overcome resistance and boost activity
of clinically validated and emerging antibodies in cancer immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION
Monoclonal antibody-based therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment improving survival
for patients with hematologic and solid cancers. The clinically most successful antibodies exert
antitumor activity either by targeting tumor cells directly (direct-targeting antibodies) (1–4),
or by targeting and activating immune cells that seek up and kill cancer cells in the tumor
microenvironment (immune checkpoint antibodies) (5–13).
While both types of mAb are highly potent with cancer curative potential a significant fraction
of patients fail to respond or develop resistance to treatment (14–17). An improved understanding
of mechanisms underlying resistance, and in particular those common to antibody drugs as a class–
including direct-targeting and immune checkpoint antibodies–is needed for rational development
of drugs that could help boost efficacy, and prevent or overcome antibody drug resistance. Given the
broad use of antibodies in cancer treatment, such drugs would have the potential to fundamentally
improve cancer survival.

FcγRs in Antibody Antitumor Immunity
FcγR Regulation of Antibody-Induced
Immunity–“The Antibody Checkpoints”
The Fc receptors (FcR) are the only receptors of the immune
system known to regulate the activity of antibodies as a class
(18). FcRs orchestrate antibody-induced effector cell responses
and immunity through low affinity, high avidity interactions
with aggregated antibody Fc-domains of antibody-coated cells
or immune complexes, generated following antibody Fv-binding
to target receptors. Because Fc domains are conserved between
antibodies of a given subclass e.g., IgA, IgE, IgM, or IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4, FcRs regulate antibody-induced immune
responses irrespective of antigen specificity. For this same reason
FcRs regulate immune responses induced both by endogenously
generated antibodies (e.g., antibodies mounted in response to
infection or underlying inflammatory or autoimmune disease)
and recombinantly produced therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
(18, 19). Of particular relevance for cancer immunotherapy the
Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) are known to regulate the activity of
Immunoglobulin G type of antibodies (20), the group to which
all antibodies approved for cancer therapy belong.
The family of FcγRs share several characteristics with the
T cell immune checkpoints in how they regulate effector cell
activation and immune responses (Figure 1). Recent work by
ourselves and others, reviewed in detail below, demonstrate a
critical role for this receptor family as concerted regulators of
antibody-induced innate and adaptive immunity. Consequently,
the FcγRs are therapeutically important immune checkpoints,
and since they control immune activity of IgG antibodies as a
class, we propose to refer to them as “antibody checkpoints.” We
will herein use antibody checkpoint and FcγR interchangeably.
Antibody and T Cell
Checkpoints–Similarities and Differences
Like the T cell checkpoints the Fc gamma receptors (FcγR)
fall into either of two functionally distinct groups, which
coordinately regulate immune effector cell activation and
ensuing immune responses (Figure 1). Activating FcγR, like co-
stimulatory T cell checkpoints, promote effector cell activation,
and immunity. In contrast, inhibitory FcγR, like the T cell
co- inhibitory checkpoints, block cellular activation and down-
modulate immune responses. Adding to complexity, antibody
checkpoints may–similar to the T cell checkpoints–promote
checkpoint receptor extrinsic signaling by facilitating cross-
linking and signaling of ligand receptors (21, 22). In case of
the antibody checkpoints, this would equate to FcγR-mediated
cross-linking of antibody Fv-targeted receptors (Figure 2).
Depending on ligand receptor function, such signaling may be
activating or inhibitory, as has been described for agonistic
CD40 and agonistic Fas antibodies, respectively (23–27).
FcγR extrinsic signaling may, or may not, contribute to
therapeutic efficacy.
The activating and the inhibitory FcγR receptors transmit
their signals into FcγR-bearing immune cell via immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM), and immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based
inhibitory
motifs
(ITIM),
respectively.
Specifically, how target cell-bound antibodies modulate immune
cell activation is determined by their relative engagement
of activating and inhibitory Fcγ receptors. This in turn
is determined by the size of the FcγR-engaging immune
complex, i.e., the number of antibodies coated onto a target
cell (determined by cellular expression levels of antibody
targeted receptor), availability of activating and inhibitory Fcγ
receptors, and antibody isotype. Different antibody isotypes
bind with different affinity to activating and inhibitory Fcγ
receptors, resulting in different activating: inhibitory (A:I)
ratios, and differential ability to mediate e.g., activating FcγR-
dependent target cell deletion (28) or inhibitory FcγR-dependent
agonism (23, 24).
As in the T cell checkpoint family, there are several activating
antibody
checkpoints
that
individually,
and
collectively,
positively
regulate
antibody-induced
cell
activation.
In
humans, the activating FcγR’s are: FcγRI (CD64), FcγRIIa
(CD32a), FcγRIIc (CD32c), and FcγRIIIa (CD16a) (29, 30).
The GPI-linked FcγRIIIb lacks an intracellular signaling
domain and ITAM motifs, but is nevertheless often considered
an activating FcγR, since it has been shown to promote
neutrophil activation and effector cell mediated target cell
killing in response to challenge with antibody-coated target cells
(31, 32). The activating mouse FcγRs are: FcγRI, FcγRIII, and
FcγRIV (28, 30, 33).
Most Fc gamma receptors bind monomeric IgG with low
to intermediate (µM) affinity [as reviewed in detail elsewhere
(28, 29, 33)]. Immune complex formation allows for high-avidity
binding of multimerized IgG Fc’s to the low-affinity FcγRs, which
are cross-linked, leading to FcγR-expressing cell activation. In
contrast, free circulating IgG has too low affinity to promote
stable Fc:FcγR binding, and cannot promote FcγR-cross-linking,
or cell activation. How high affinity FcγRs e.g., FcγRI and mouse
FcγRIV, which may bind monomeric uncomplexed IgG, sense
and trigger activation in response to immune complexes and
antibody-coated cells remains a subject of debate. It is however
clear that the high affinity FcγRs may critically contribute to
therapeutic antibody efficacy and pathology (33, 34).
Multiple isoforms and allelic variants of the individual FcγRs
are known, and the affinities of the clinically most significant
variants for different human IgG subclasses have been described
(29). Of particular significance for cancer immunotherapy,
two isoforms of the low and intermediary affinity antibody
checkpoints FcγRIIa (H131R) and FcγRIIIa (V158F), which
bind IgG and antibody-coated target cells with higher affinity
and avidity, have been associated with improved survival of
diverse cancer patients in response to antibody-based cancer
immunotherapy (35–39). These, and additional polymorphisms
of low and intermediary affinity activating and inhibitory FcγRs,
which alter affinity for IgG, or modulate FcγR expression levels,
are further associated with susceptibility to antibody-mediated
chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease (40). Of further
functional consequence, there is extensive gene copy number
variation in high and low affinity loci that affect expression levels
of individual FcγRs (41–43).
The antibody checkpoints differ from the T cell checkpoints in
notable and critical aspects, which have important consequences
for the type of immune response induced, and for design

FcγRs in Antibody Antitumor Immunity
FIGURE 1 | Antibody and T cell checkpoints. Both T cell and antibody checkpoints comprise activating (co-stimulatory) and inhibitory receptors. However, antibody
checkpoints are co- expressed only on innate immune cells e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells, and comprise only a single inhibitory member (FcγRIIB).
FIGURE 2 | Antibody checkpoint intrinsic and extrinsic signaling. (A) Intrinsic signaling. Antibody checkpoints relay aggregated antibody Fc-induced signals into
effector cells (MΦ) in a concerted manner through ITAM containing activating (aFcγR) and ITIM-containing inhibitory (iFcγR) Fc gamma receptors. FcγR-expressing
cell responses include phagocytosis, immune complex endocytosis, and antigen presentation. (B) Extrinsic signaling. Antibody checkpoints promote clustering and
signaling induced by antibody targeted receptors in an antibody Fv and Fc co-dependent manner. Cellular responses are determined by the antibody-targeted
receptor’s function e.g., macrophage co-stimulation or tumor cell apoptosis.
of drugs aimed at harnessing and enhancing FcγR-mediated
immunity (Figure 1).
Firstly, in contrast to the T cell checkpoints the Fc gamma
receptors are not generally expressed on T cells, but principally
on cells of the innate immune system, and in a restricted manner
on B cells (FcγRIIb) and NK cells (FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIc, the
latter in ∼20% of caucasians) (18, 30, 41). In particular cells
specialized in MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation, e.g.,
macrophages and dendritic cells, express both activating and
inhibitory FcγRs, enabling fine-tuned regulation of antibody-
induced immune responses (28, 44). Consequently, the antibody
checkpoints hold the key to unleash antibody-induced immunity
first and fore-most through improving innate immune effector
mechanisms, e.g., macrophage dependent phagocytosis (ADCP),

and dendritic cell mediated antigen presentation, and cross-
presentation (45–51). Triggering and enhancing innate immune
activation and robust antigen presentation is known to critically
contribute to and underlie robust adaptive T cell-mediated
antitumor responses, including those induced by antibodies
targeting T cell checkpoints (18, 52–54). Modulation of antibody
checkpoints therefore has the potential to improve also adaptive
antitumor responses, possibly decreasing the threshold of tumor
mutational burden for cancers to respond to antibody-mediated
cancer immunotherapy (55). Finally, and in stark contrast to
the multiple inhibitory T cell checkpoints described, only a
single inhibitory antibody checkpoint–Fc gamma receptor IIB–is
known (Figure 1).
ANTIBODY CHECKPOINTS DETERMINE
ANTI-CANCER ANTIBODY EFFICACY
Cancer Cell Direct-Targeting Antibodies
The CD20-specific antibody rituximab was the first antibody to
be approved by the FDA for cancer therapy and is arguably the
clinically best validated antibody used in cancer immunotherapy.
As such rituximab provides a prime example of a tumor cell
direct-targeting antibody that has been exhaustively studied from
a mechanism-of-action perspective. While multiple mechanisms,
including induction of apoptosis and triggering of complement
mediated cell lysis, have been proposed to contribute to and
underlie rituximab therapeutic activity (56, 57), the strongest
preclinical, and clinical evidence point to Fc gamma receptor
dependent mechanisms (58–61).
Independent
retrospective
studies
have
established
a
correlation between one or more activating Fc gamma receptors
and clinical efficacy in different types of lymphoma. Patients
homozygous for high affinity allelic variants of the activating
antibody checkpoints FcγRIIIa or FcγRIIa showed improved
responses and survival in response to rituximab therapy
compared to patients carrying one or more lower affinity
alleles (35, 36). Similar links between response and FcγR-
dependent mechanisms have been observed for additional
cancer cell direct-targeting antibodies e.g., herceptin (anti-
Her2) and cetuximab (anti-EGFR) in breast cancer (38) and
colorectal patients, respectively (37, 39). These observations
have
spurred
biotech
and
pharmaceutical
companies
to
engineer antibodies with improved binding to activating
antibody
checkpoints.
Obinutuzumab,
a
glycoengineered
antibody with improved affinity for FcγRIIIa, was approved
for clinical use based on increased overall survival in a head-
to-head comparison with rituximab in CLL patients (15).
Taken together, these observations demonstrate that antibody
checkpoints can determine clinical efficacy of cancer cell
direct-targeting antibodies.
Consistent with the well-conserved function of activating
and inhibitory antibody checkpoints between mouse and man,
similar dependencies between activating FcγRs and cancer cell
direct-targeting antibodies have been made in mouse cancer
experimental models. Further in keeping with common, ITAM-
signaling dependent, functions of the several activating antibody
checkpoints, genetic ablation of individual activating FcγRs
typically has shown limited effects on in vivo therapeutic efficacy
compared to ablation of all activatory FcγRs (28, 33, 62).
In stark contrast, genetic deletion of the sole inhibitory
antibody checkpoint FcγRIIB fundamentally enhances in vivo
therapeutic activity of cancer cell direct-targeting antibodies,
including those specific for CD20, Her2, and EGFR i.e., clinically
validated targets in therapy of hematologic malignancy as
well as solid cancer (63). These observations indicate the
significant therapeutic potential of targeting the inhibitory
antibody checkpoint, and indicate that redundancy needs to be
accounted for when seeking to enhance antibody efficacy by
modulating activating antibody checkpoints, much as has been
observed in targeting of the multiple different T cell checkpoints
(6, 14, 64).
Interestingly, and in further support of FcγRIIB being a
tractable target in cancer immunotherapy, recent data has
demonstrated that this inhibitory antibody checkpoint limits
therapeutic antibody efficacy and promotes antibody drug
resistance by additional mechanisms distinct from inhibitory
signaling in immune effector cells, when expressed on tumor B
cells (65) (Figure 3). Beers et al. found that FcγRIIB expressed
on tumor B cells promoted internalization of rituximab antibody
molecules from the tumor B cell surface, increasing antibody
consumption and leaving fewer rituximab molecules to engage
critical FcγR-dependent effector cell-mediated antitumor activity
e.g., ADCP (66). FcγRIIB expression correlated with rituximab
internalization across several different lymphoma subtypes
studied. Highest and most homogenous expression of FcγRIIB is
observed in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Mantle cell
lymphoma (MCL), and Marginal Zone Lymphoma, although a
fraction of Follicular lymphoma (FL) and Diffuse Large B cell
Lymphoma show exceptionally high FcγRIIB expression (67, 68).
Further consistent with tumor B cell expressed FcγRIIB limiting
antibody therapeutic efficacy and promoting antibody resistance,
retrospective clinical studies of MCL and FL patients treated
with rituximab-containing therapy showed decreased survival
of patients with higher FcγRIIB expression on tumor cells (67,
69). Tumor cell expressed FcγRIIB appears to be a general
mechanism limiting antibody therapeutic efficacy and promoting
antibody drug resistance in the tumor microenvironment. Using
a humanized model of treatment refractory B cell leukemia,
and the CD52-specific antibody alemtuzumab, Pallasch et al.
found that FcγRIIB is highly overexpressed on leukemic tumor
cells in such antibody drug-resistant tumor microenvironments,
and that shRNA-mediated knock-down of tumor cell FcγRIIB
restored responsiveness to therapeutic antibody resulting in
animal cure (70). Finally, high expression of FcγRIIB in B cell
malignancy may indicate that immunocompetent antibodies to
FcγRIIB could have single agent therapeutic activity in this
setting (65, 71).

and

FcγRs in Antibody Antitumor Immunity
FIGURE 3 | Tumor cell expressed FcγRIIB promotes antibody drug resistance. (A) Resistance is mediated by FcγRIIB-mediated removal of antibody molecules from
the tumor cell surface through a process of internalization. (B) Blocking antibodies to FcγRIIB prevent internalization, leaving greater numbers of therapeutic antibody
on the tumor cell surface, promoting immune effector cell-mediated antitumor activity.
Antibodies to Immune Checkpoint
Inhibitory Receptors
Antibody targeting of immune inhibitory T cell checkpoints
e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 has transformed solid cancer
therapy shifting focus from cancer cell-direct targeting therapies
to immune modulatory drugs, which induce long-term remission
and apparent cures albeit in a small fraction of advanced stage
cancer patients. Such immune checkpoint-directed therapy has
increased overall survival for patients with various cancers,
notably including multiple solid cancer types e.g., melanoma,
lung, bladder, and head and neck cancer, and are approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (14, 73, 74).
While originally thought to act solely via “blocking the
brake” on effector T cells (74, 75), recent preclinical and clinical
data indicate a critical role for FcγR’s in regulating therapeutic
efficacy of antibodies to inhibitory T cell checkpoints. Vargas
et al. for the first time in human subjects, demonstrated a link
between antibody checkpoints, and clinical response to T cell
checkpoint targeted antibody therapy (76). Melanoma patients
carrying a high affinity allele of the activating FcγRIIIa (V158)
showed improved survival in response to treatment with the anti-
CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab compared to patients carrying a
lower affinity FcγRIIIa (F158) allele. Interestingly, in the two
retrospectively studied cohorts, a prerequisite for response to
anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy was that patients had inflamed
tumors i.e., T cells had infiltrated tumors prior to commencing
therapy. The observation that antibody checkpoints determine
clinical efficacy of ipilimumab was not unexpected, since anti-
CTLA-4 antibody therapy in the mouse critically depends on
FcγR-mediated deletion of regulatory T cells (77–80), which
express CTLA-4 at higher levels compared with effector T
cells in the tumor microenvironment (76). Consistent with co-
ordinate regulation of anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapeutic efficacy
by the antibody checkpoints, in a FcγR-humanized mouse model
antibody variants engineered for enhanced binding to activatory
FcγR showed enhanced therapeutic activity (76). In contrast,
antibody variants with diminished binding to activating FcγR
failed to induce protective immunity against cancer.
So, how about the other clinically validated T cell checkpoints?
Do antibody checkpoints regulate the activity also of antibodies
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis? Evidence from mouse models
suggests that indeed they do. Interestingly, however, these
data indicate differential FcγR-regulation for anti-PD-1 and
anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Dahan et al. reported that anti-PD-
L1 antibodies therapeutic efficacy was enhanced with antibody
isotypes that preferentially engage activating over inhibitory
antibody checkpoints (81). Conversely, anti-PD-1 antibody
variants that did not engage FcγRs showed greatest therapeutic
activity, and FcγR-engaging antibodies’ activity decreased with
increasing A:I ratios. Similarly, Pittet and coworkers found
that in vitro and in vivo efficacy of clinically approved anti-
PD-1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab, and a murine
surrogate antibody variant with claimed similar engagement
of mouse FcγR compared to these mAb, was compromised
by FcγR-engagement (82). Deglycosylation of antibodies with
EndoS rendering them incapable of engaging FcγRs, or
antibody-mediated FcγR-blockade, significantly improved anti-
PD-1 antibody therapeutic activity. This demonstrates that FcγRs
negatively regulate anti-PD-1 antibody efficacy. Further studies
are needed to dissect the relative importance of activating vs.
inhibitory antibody checkpoints in regulating anti-PD-1/PD-L1
antibodies’ therapeutic activity.

FcγRs in Antibody Antitumor Immunity
Antibodies to Immune Checkpoint
Co-stimulatory Receptors
The power of treating cancer by engaging patient’s own immune
defense mechanisms through immunotherapy with antibodies
to the co-inhibitory T cell checkpoints, has prompted the
question of whether targeting also co-stimulatory immune
checkpoints e.g., 4-1BB, OX40, CD40, and GITR can translate
into similarly efficacious and perhaps complementary pathways
of anti-cancer immunity?
Preclinical and limited clinical data has indicated both
single agent activity of antibodies to co-stimulatory immune
checkpoints and complementary effects following combination
with checkpoint blocking antibodies e.g., anti-PD-1 (83–89).
As found for antibodies to the immune inhibitory checkpoints,
and as discussed below, efficacy of immune agonist checkpoint
antibodies is regulated by the FcγRs (77–79, 89), with some
showing preferential engagement of activatory FcγR (i.e., high
A:I ratio), and others of inhibitory FcγR (i.e., low A:I ratio), for
optimal therapeutic activity (Table 1).
So, what is the common denominator determining FcγR-
dependency, and preferential engagement of inhibitory vs.
activating FcγR for efficacy of individual targets and antibodies?
In a recent landmark paper, Beers and co-workers used
a multi-pronged approach to study molecular and cellular
FcγR-dependent mechanisms underlying therapeutic activity of
antibodies to the co-stimulatory immune checkpoint 4-1BB (89).
Firstly, the authors used anti-4-1BB antibodies with identical
Fv-regions but differing in isotype–therefore targeting the same
epitope on 4-1BB but showing preferential engagement of
activating (mouse IgG2a, high A:I ratio) or inhibitory (mouse
IgG1, low A:I ratio) antibody checkpoints. Second, effects
were studied in immunocompetent tumor-bearing animals
differing only by FcγR repertoire–expressing only activating,
only inhibitory or both activating and inhibitory antibody
checkpoints. Using this approach, the authors found that anti-4-
1BB antibodies can stimulate anti-tumor immunity by different
mechanisms; Boosting of effector CD8+ T cells, or depletion of
regulatory T cells (Figure 4). Both mechanisms were regulated
by antibody interactions with FcγR, but differently so.
Anti-4-1BB
antibodies’
depletion
of
intratumoral
Treg
cells was shown to be dependent on activating FcγR (89).
Antibody isotypes with high A:I ratio showed enhanced
Treg deletion, and Treg deletion was diminished in animals
lacking activating Fc gamma receptors. A similar dependence
on activating antibody checkpoints for Treg depletion had
previously been demonstrated for antibodies to other immune
receptors e.g., GITR, OX40, CD40, CTLA-4, or IL-2R, i.e.,
independent of specificity for co-stimulatory or inhibitory
immune checkpoints (Table 1).
Conversely, boosting of CD8+ T cell responses was most
pronounced with antibody isotypes of low A:I ratio. The
mechanism underlying enhanced CD8+ T cell responses likely
involves FcγRIIB-mediated antibody cross-linking, and thereby
promoted signaling, of antibody-targeted co-stimulatory 4-1BB
receptors on CD8+ T cells. Agonist anti-tumor activity of
anti-CD40 antibodies has previously been proposed to rely
on FcγRIIB-mediated antibody cross-linking and promoted
signaling in CD40-expressing antigen presenting cells (23, 24)
(Table 1; Figure 2B).
Interestingly,
the
authors
found
that
concurrent
administration of equal doses of high A:I variant (mIgG2a),
Treg-depleting, anti-4-1-BB antibodies, and low A:I variant
(mIgG1), CD8+ T cell boosting, anti-4-1-BB antibodies reduced
therapeutic efficacy. In contrast, sequential administration of first
activating FcγR-optimized antibody to deplete Tregs, followed
by inhibitory FcγR-optimized antibody to agonize CD8+ T
cells, enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to single agent
treatment. These observations indicated competing mechanisms
of high A:I antibody mediated Treg depletion, and low A:I
antibody mediated CD8+ T cell boosting. This notion that was
corroborated through a series of complementary experiments.
In short, although the two studied isotype variant antibodies
show preferential binding to activatory (mIgG2a, high A:I ratio)
and inhibitory (mIgG1, low A:I ratio) FcγRs, respectively, both
antibody variants will co-engage activating and inhibitory FcγRs
in vivo, where their “preferred” type (activating or inhibitory) of
FcγR on effector cells is limited in numbers, relative to target cell
coated antibody Fc’s available for FcγR engagement. Therefore,
concurrently administered high A:I ratio and low A:I ratio
antibodies will compete for binding to available activating and
inhibitory FcγR, resulting in a “frustrated system” of suboptimal
Treg depletion and suboptimal CD8+ T cell boosting.
Importantly, if translated to human, these findings could
have broad implications for cancer immunotherapy. Human
IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies–two of the most common isotypes
used in cancer immunotherapy–bind human activating and
inhibitory FcγRs with rather similar affinity, compared with the
more “polar” affinities of mIgG2a and mIgG1 for activating,
and inhibitory FcγRs, respectively. Human IgG1 and IgG4
might therefore be expected to be quite sensitive to such
competition, which could help explain the poor translation of
promising mouse data to the human clinical setting. Further, the
findings are likely relevant to other signaling antibody targets,
most notably co-stimulatory receptors of the TNF receptor
superfamily. Earlier studies had reported decreased efficacy
following concurrent treatment with antibodies to OX40 and
PD-1, although underlying molecular mechanisms were not
studied (88).
Collectively, these observations shed important light on
how antibody checkpoints regulate mechanisms common to
cancer cell direct-targeting and immune checkpoint targeting
antibodies. Therapeutic activity of either type of antibody
may rely principally on target cell depletion (e.g., anti-
CD20 or anti-IL-2R), cell depletion and block of target
receptor signaling (e.g., anti-Her2 or anti-CTLA-4), or strictly
on receptor/ligand blockade e.g., anti-PD-1 (Figure 5). Thus,
classification of antibodies into cancer cell-direct targeting,
immune checkpoint blocking, or immune checkpoint agonists,
is inadequate and needs revision (98). Instead, careful dissection
of individual antibodies’ mechanism(s) of action with respect
to their ability to block or agonize receptor signaling and/or
deplete target cell(s), and their regulation by interactions with

the antibody checkpoints, will be critical for identification
and rational combination of antibodies with complementary
non-competing mechanisms-of-action (Table 1). As discussed
below, such knowledge will additionally pave the way for
antibody-checkpoint targeted therapies, e.g., antibody blockade
of inhibitory FcγRIIB or Fc-engineering for enhanced affinity to
activating FcγR, to help boost efficacy and overcome resistance in
the immune suppressed tumor microenvironment.
Targeting the Antibody Checkpoints to
Improve Cancer Immunotherapy–Focus
on FcγRIIB
The documented role of the antibody checkpoints as master
regulators of the clinically most relevant classes of anti-cancer
antibodies detailed above, suggests that targeting of this receptor
family be an attractive strategy to enhance efficacy and overcome
resistance to antibody-based cancer immunotherapy.
While Fc gamma receptor regulation of antibody efficacy
is highly functionally conserved between mouse and man,
important
differences
in
absolute
and
relative
binding
affinities of the species’ respective antibody subclasses for
their corresponding activating and inhibitory FcγRs have slowed
translation into human therapeutic antibody candidates and
clinical development. Recent development of FcR-humanized
mouse models (99), and highly specific antagonist or agonist
antibodies to individual human and mouse activating and
inhibitory receptors (30, 65), have now enabled such translation.
Two
principal
strategies

better

antibody
checkpoint-dependent
antitumor
immunity
have
been
pursued–Fc
engineering
or
FcγR
blockade
(Figure 6).
Antibody
engineering
to
enhance
affinity
for
activating
antibody checkpoints has obtained clinical proof-of-concept
through the afucosylated CD20-specific antibody obinutuzumab
(15), with additional afucosylated antibodies in late stage
clinical development (100). While clinically validated, and
elegant in the sense that simple removal of a fucose group
of residue N297 in the antibody constant domain results in
very significantly enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa (101), this
approach has its limitations. Firstly, emerging data indicates
that intratumoral macrophages and dendritic cells–critical
effectors underlying antibody-induced antitumor immunity
(102)–express FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB at highest density (76).
Further, FcγRIIA may be the only activating Fc gamma receptor
expressed on human dendritic cells, which additionally express
FcγRIIB for coordinate regulation of antigen presentation
(45). Consequently, harnessing the full potential of antibody
checkpoint-regulated anti-cancer immunity is likely to require
engagement and enhancement of additional activating FcγRs
besides FcγRIIIa, and ideally reduced or no engagement of
the inhibitory antibody checkpoint. As discussed below, the
great structural similarity between individual activating and
inhibitory antibody checkpoint receptors poses significant
technical challenges to succeed in engineering of antibodies with
such properties. Nevertheless, Fc-engineering by substitution
of two or more amino acids has generated antibody molecules
with enhanced affinity for both FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA,
albeit with retained or slightly enhanced affinity also for the
inhibitory FcγRIIB (103, 104). Whether such molecules will
show therapeutically relevant pharmacokinetics or enhanced
efficacy remains to be demonstrated in clinical trials.

FcγRs in Antibody Antitumor Immunity
FIGURE 4 | Activating and inhibitory antibody checkpoints determine efficacy and mechanism-of-action of immune agonist antibodies. This schematic figure models
(A) Antibody engagement of activating and inhibitory FcγRs determine target cell depletion and agonism, respectively. The two mechanism compete when antibody
variants (isotype) capable of binding both FcγR are used, resulting in reduced or no therapeutic activity. (B) Antibody variants with enhanced binding to activating
FcγR (high A:I ratio) show improved depletion of Treg cells, which express higher numbers of receptors compared with effector cells, resulting in immune activation
through elimination of suppressor cells. (C) Antibody variants with enhanced binding to inhibitory FcγR (low A:I ratio) show improved CD8+ T cell agonism, resulting in
immune activation by expansion and boosting of effector cells.
Based on the significant upregulation of the sole inhibitory
antibody checkpoint FcγRIIB in the tumor microenvironment
(97), and its documented role in conferring resistance to
antibody-based therapy in this niche (65, 70, 97), we have
pursued
antibody-mediated
blockade
of
FcγRIIB
as
an
alternative and complementary approach to Fc-engineering
to harness the full potential of antibody checkpoint-regulated
immunity. In theory, besides being an apparent critical
pan-antibody regulator conferring antibody drug resistance
in
the
tumor
microenvironment,
targeted
blockade
of
FcγRIIB by a separate antibody has the advantage of enabling
combination therapy and boosted efficacy with multiple existing,
clinically validated, antibodies including those engineered
for enhanced binding to activating FcγR (65). The strategy
does, however, put exquisite requirements on a therapeutic
antibody candidate, both from target receptor specificity
and
function-modulating
perspectives.
The
extracellular,
antibody accessible domain, of the inhibitory FcγRIIB is
∼93% homologous with the activating FcγRIIA. Nevertheless,
probing of a highly diversified human recombinant antibody
library (65), or immunization of mice transgenic for human
FcγRIIA (105), generated diverse pools of highly specific

four exemplary antibody MoA’s, pertinent to both immune checkpoint and tumor cell direct-targeting antibody types. (1) Blocking mAb. PD-1, a co-inhibitory antibody
checkpoint expressed at high and similar levels on intratumoral Treg and Teff cells, is best targeted using a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking Fc-null antibody variant, since
FcγR-mediated Teff cell depletion is undesirable (2) Blocking and depleting mAbs. Anti-CTLA-4 is overexpressed on intratumoral Treg compared with Teff, and
activatory FcγR-engagement correlates with survival in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab. Preferred MoA is two-fold: CTLA-4/B7 blockade and Treg
depletion through FcγR-dependent mechanisms (3) Agonist mAb Preferred MoA is FcγR-engaging antibody variant, where FcγRs promote receptor cross-linking and
signaling. (4) Depletion only mAb. Anti-IL2R antibody preferred MoA is ligand non-blocking and FcγR-dependent (Treg) cell depletion. IL-2R overexpressing Tregs are

antibodies that selectively bound to FcγRIIB, and not to
FcγRIIA, and which in a dose-dependent manner blocked
immune complex binding to cell surface-expressed FcγRIIB.
Functional screening revealed that only a minority of the
highly FcγRIIB specific human recombinant antibodies were
able to block antibody-induced FcγRIIB inhibitory signaling
(65). Remaining candidates either did not block, or agonized,
FcγRIIB signaling. The latter category could have therapeutic
potential in treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
disease (106).

FcγRs in Antibody Antitumor Immunity
FIGURE 6 | Antibody-induced antitumor immunity can be enhanced by modulation of antibody: FcγR interactions. Left panel (no antibody checkpoint modulation).
Antibody efficacy is balanced by co-engagement of activating and inhibitory FcγR. Center panel (enhanced engagement of activating FcγR). Antibody efficacy is
improved through Fc-engineering for enhanced binding to activating FcγR. Right panel–Antibody efficacy is enhanced by blockade of the inhibitory FcγRIIB.
Based on observations that FcγRIIB limits antibody efficacy
and promotes tumor cell resistance by dual mechanisms in B
cell malignancy, acting at the level of both immune effector
cells and tumor B cells, we have further characterized the
therapeutic potential of antagonistic anti-FcγRIIB antibodies to
boost efficacy and overcome resistance to antibody therapy in
vivo focusing initially on this setting. A lead human antagonistic
anti-FcγRIIB IgG1 antibody (6G11 or BI-1206), which showed
synergistically enhanced rituximab B cell depletion in FcγRIIB
and CD20 humanized mice, and overcame refractoriness of
primary leukaemic B cells to anti-CD20-based antibody therapy
in vivo, is currently in early phase clinical testing (65).
Besides affording efficacy, therapeutic targeting of Fc gamma
receptors, whether by blocking antibodies or Fc-engineering,
must be safe and associated with therapeutically relevant
pharmacokinetics. In addition to its high expression on B
cells and certain macrophage/dendritic cells, FcγRIIB has
been reported to be highly expressed in mouse and rat
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) (107), where they
have been implicated in removal of circulating small immune
complexes (108). These observations raise potential safety
concerns of undesirably cytotoxic activity with therapeutic
antibodies targeting FcγRIIB. However, our recent observations
of human and mouse liver indicate lower LSEC expression
in man (30), and dosing of FcγRIIB humanized mice with
therapeutically relevant doses of anti-human FcγRIIB IgG1
antibody 6G11 showed no apparent acute or chronic treatment
related adverse effects (30, 65). Ultimately, the safety and
efficacy of targeting FcγRIIB needs to be assessed in human
subjects. Two clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate safety and
explore efficacy of the BI-1206 antibody as single agent and in
combination with rituximab in B cell malignancy (NCT03571568
and NCT02933320). Our ongoing efforts aim at translating
observations of FcγRIIB-regulated antitumor immunity to the
solid cancer clinical setting.
As noted above FcγRIIB may promote anti-tumor activity
by facilitating extrinsic signaling of certain co-stimulatory
receptors expressed on tumor or immune cells. A possible
strategy to enhance therapeutic activity of such antibodies
would therefore be to enhance their affinity for FcγRIIB. In
keeping with this, anti-DR5 antibodies carrying the S267E
(“SE”) mutation, increasing human IgG1 affinity for FcγRIIB
several hundred-fold, showed improved tumor regression in
mouse models humanized for FcγRIIB (109). Analogously,
human IgG2 anti-CD40 antibodies equipped with SE or
SE/LF mutated backbones (the latter further increases affinity
for FcγRIIB) showed enhanced CD8+ T cell activation, and
improved ability to clear tumors, in mice humanized for
FcγRs and CD40 (96). However, increasing antibody affinity
for FcγRIIB in these two cases improved not only efficacy but
also side effects. Increased DR5 agonism of the SE variant
anti-DR5 was associated with increased liver enzyme release.
SE and SE/LF variant anti-CD40 antibodies increased not
only T cell activation and anti-tumor immunity, but also

depletion of platelets, which express CD40 (96, 109). Thus, Fc-
engineering for enhanced FcγRIIB affinity or selectivity needs
close consideration of antibody (Fv-) targeted receptor’s cellular
distribution and function(s).
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Emerging

demonstrate
that
the

“antibody checkpoints”–control antitumor immunity induced
by the clinically most successful antibodies used in cancer

antibody checkpoint-regulated anti-tumor immunity, through
Fc-engineering
to
enhance
binding
to
activating
FcγRs,
or through blockade of the inhibitory FcγRIIB, have been
approved or are in development. If safe and well-tolerated,
these agents hold promise to improve response rates, duration

overall
survival
for
