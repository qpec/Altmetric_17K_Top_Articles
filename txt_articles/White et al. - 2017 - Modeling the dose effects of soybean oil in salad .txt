ABSTRACT
Background: Previously, we showed that vegetable oil is necessary
for carotenoid absorption from salad vegetables. Research is needed
to better define the dose effect and its interindividual variation for
carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins.
Objective: The objective was to model the dose-response relation
between the amount of soybean oil in salad dressing and the absorption
of 1) carotenoids, phylloquinone, and tocopherols in salad vegetables
and 2) retinyl palmitate formed from the provitamin A carotenoids.
Design: Women (n = 12) each consumed 5 vegetable salads with salad
dressings containing 0, 2, 4, 8, or 32 g soybean oil. Blood was col-
lected at selected time points. The outcome variables were the chylo-
micron carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin area under the curve (AUC)
and maximum content in the plasma chylomicron fraction (Cmax). The
individual-specific and group-average dose-response relations were in-
vestigated by fitting linear mixed-effects random coefficient models.
Results: Across the entire 0–32-g range, soybean oil was linearly
related to the chylomicron AUC and Cmax values for a-carotene, ly-
copene, phylloquinone, and retinyl palmitate. Across 0–8 g of soybean
oil, there was a linear increase in the chylomicron AUC and Cmax
values for b-carotene. Across a more limited 0–4-g range of soybean
oil, there were minor linear increases in the chylomicron AUC for lutein
and a- and total tocopherol. Absorption of all carotenoids and fat-
soluble vitamins was highest with 32 g oil (P , 0.002). For 32 g oil,
the interindividual rank order of the chylomicron AUCs was consistent
across the carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins (P , 0.0001).
Conclusions: Within the linear range, the average absorption of
carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins could be largely predicted by
the soybean oil effect. However, the effect varied widely, and some
individuals showed a negligible response. There was a global soy-
bean oil effect such that those who absorbed more of one carotenoid
and fat-soluble vitamin also tended to absorb more of the others.
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02867488.

INTRODUCTION
Only 8.9% of US adults consume 2–3-cup equivalents of
vegetables/d as recommended for sedentary adults depending on
their age and sex (1, 2). Physically active adults should consume
more (2). A national diet characterized by low vegetable con-
sumption is a public health concern given the associated negative
health outcomes, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease
and probable increased overall risk of cancer (3). In view of their
low calorie and high fiber contents, the epidemiologic evidence for
an obesity-preventing role of vegetables is surprisingly in-
conclusive (4, 5). Recent research has uncovered a probable ex-
planation, which is the extent to which vegetables are consumed in
forms that add calories and fat (5, 6). Previously, we and others
showed that added lipid in the form of avocado or oil in salad
dressing is needed to absorb b-carotene and other fat-soluble ca-
rotenoids in salad vegetables (7–10). Efforts to encourage Amer-
icans to consume vegetables with fewer added fat calories will
require better definition of the dose-response relation between
added vegetable oil and the health benefit in promoting the ab-
sorption of carotenoids and also fat-soluble vitamins. Salads are
major contributors to vegetable and nutrient intakes in the United
States (11, 12). Lettuce and vegetable salads are second only to
potatoes among the most commonly consumed vegetables and
vegetable products (13). In a nationally representative consumer
survey, 59% of respondents reported that they eat salads, including
leaf salads, as meals for lunch or dinner $1 time/wk (14). US salad
consumers tend to have better intakes and higher serum concen-
trations of nutrients, including folic acid, vitamin C, carotenoids,
and vitamin E, which suggests good bioavailability (11). However,
the plasma carotenoid concentrations in raw food adherents, which
are characterized by high consumption of raw fruits and vegeta-
bles, were predicted primarily by their consumption of added fat

 and oil (15). Thus, the availability of lipid appears to restrict the
benefit derived from carotenoids in raw vegetables even when they
are consumed in abundance.
In view of the low consumption of vegetables in the United States,
there is a particular need to optimize their nutritional benefits. The
objectives of this study were to use statistical modeling to charac-
terize the relation between the amount of soybean oil in salad
dressing and the absorption of 1) carotenoids, phylloquinone
(vitamin K-1), and tocopherols in salad vegetables and 2) retinyl
palmitate and vitamin A formed from the provitamin A carotenoids,
a- and b-carotene, in salad vegetables. Soybean oil is the pre-
dominant salad and cooking oil used by the US food industry (16).
METHODS
Subjects
Twelve healthy, nonsmoking women 19–39 y of age were en-
rolled in the study from June to September 2009 at the Iowa State
University Nutrition and Wellness Research Center. The mean 6
SD age of the study participants was 24.0 6 5.9 y; the mean 6 SD
BMI (in kg/m2) was 23.60 6 3.43. The women were recruited from
the university community and screened by interview with the use
of a standardized questionnaire that addressed health and lifestyle
factors (Supplemental Figure 1). They also completed a SCOFF
questionnaire, which is a screening tool to detect eating disorders
(17). At the time of the interview, the women’s body weights and
heights were measured. Those who met the eligibility criteria for the
study underwent additional health screening in the form of a
complete blood count, blood biochemistry profile, and plasma lipid
panel. Inclusion criteria included excellent health as indicated by
health history and blood indexes, including normolipidemia, and
BMI ,30. The exclusion criteria were as previously described (18).
Also excluded were those who had $2 positive responses on the
SCOFF questionnaire. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants. All procedures involving human subjects were ap-
proved by the Iowa State University Institutional Review Board.
Dietary protocols
During each of the 5 study periods, the participants completed
the following protocol: on days 1–3, the participants were given a
list of good food sources of carotenoids, phylloquinone, retinoids,
and tocopherols and instructed to avoid those foods. On day 4, the
participants consumed a standardized, weighed diet of conven-
tional foods, which had low contents of carotenoids and fat-
soluble vitamins. The breakfast and dinner were consumed under
supervision. The lunch and afternoon snacks were carried out by
the participants and consumed outside the research center. The
carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin contents in the diet calculated
with the use of Nutritionist Pro software (Axxya Systems) were
10.8 mg b-carotene, 4.3 mg b-cryptoxanthin, 97.6 mg lutein (plus
zeaxanthin), 0.7 mg a-tocopherol, 54.7 mg retinol activity
equivalents vitamin A, and 20.0 mg vitamin K. On day 5, the
participants consumed the test salad in the morning after an
overnight fast. The participants first ingested 240 mL bottled
water and then waited 15 min before eating the test salad. The test
salad was completely consumed with an additional 240 mL bot-
tled water within a period of 30 min. The only other foods con-
sumed were a low-fat (1.25 g) snack eaten after the 3.5-h blood
sample collection and a low-fat (3 g) lunch eaten after the 5-h
blood sample collection. These foods contained only trace
amounts of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins.
Test salads
Each participant consumed 5 test salads that had equivalent
vegetable composition but were consumed with salad dressings that
contained different amounts of soybean oil (0, 2, 4, 8, or 32 g).
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 10 salad dressing se-
quences as specified by a balanced Williams Latin square design
(19). The remaining 2 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of
the 10 salad dressing sequences and its inverse. The consumption of
each test salad was separated by a washout period of $2 wk. Each
test salad contained 48 g spinach (Spinach; Dole Food Company),
48 g romaine (Hearts of Romaine; Fresh Express), 66 g shredded
carrots (Shredded Carrots; Dole Food Company), and 85 g cherry
tomatoes (NatureSweet) (7). The romaine lettuce and spinach leaves
were sorted to select leaves of uniform dark green maturity, which
affects the concentrations of carotenoids, tocopherols, and phyllo-
quinone (20).
The salad dressings were supplied by Unilever R&D Vlaardin-
gen. The phylloquinone and tocopherol constituents had been
stripped from the soybean oil at Unilever with the use of a short-path
distillation procedure. The salad dressings were prepared by com-
bining an aqueous base formulation with increasing amounts of the
stripped soybean oil to create salad dressings containing 0, 2, 4, 8, or
32 g soybean oil per 60-g serving. The ingredients in the aqueous
base formulation were as follows (grams per kilogram): ultrapure
water (897.125), sugar (60), salt (6), spirit vinegar (35), citric acid
monohydrate (1.8), and EDTA Dissolvine (Akzo Nobel Functional
Chemicals) (0.075). To prepare the different salad dressings, the oil
was substituted wt:wt for the water in the aqueous base formulation.
HPLC-electrochemical detection analyses of
chylomicron fractions
Blood samples (10 mL) were collected from a forearm vein as
previously described (18) and transferred to evacuated blood
collection tubes containing dipotassium EDTA. A blood sample
was collected at baseline, which was after a 12-h overnight fast.
Additional blood samples were collected 2, 3.5, 5, 7, and 9.5 h after
the test salad was consumed. Blood samples were immediately
placed on ice, protected from light, and centrifuged to separate
plasma. The chylomicron fraction was isolated from each plasma
sample with the use of cumulative rate ultracentrifugation (18). The
plasma chylomicron fractions were stored at 2708C until analyzed.
The carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins were extracted from
each plasma chylomicron fraction as previously described (18).
The extracts were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 60 mL
methanol: methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (1:1, by vol). A
25-mL aliquot was injected into the HPLC-electrochemical de-
tection (ECD) system. The 5 mm C30 Carotenoid Column (4.6 3
250 mm; Waters Corp) was eluted by a gradient; the proportions
of methanol:MTBE:aqueous ammonium acetate (1.0 M, pH 4.6)
in solvent A and solvent B were 95:3:2 and 25:73:2 (vol:vol),
respectively. The following gradient was used: 0–40 min, linear
gradient from 0% to 75% solvent B; 40–60 min, linear gradient
to 100% solvent B. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. A CoulArray
system (ESA) consisting of two 582 solvent delivery modules,

metric array electrochemical detector, and thermal organizer set at

 338C was operated with the use of CoulArray software version
3.10. The following cell potentials in consecutive order were
applied to 10 detector channels: 100, 300, 450, 550, 600, 750,
800, 21000, 200, and 500 mV. The dominant channels were 300,
450, and 750 mV for tocopherols, carotenoids, and retinyl pal-
mitate, respectively. A reductive potential (21000 mV) followed
by an oxidative potential (200 mV) on an upstream channel was
applied for analysis of phylloquinone. Calibration curves were
generated for each analyte with the use of commercially available
standards. The analyst (YZ) was blinded regarding the partici-
pants’ randomly assigned orders of the salad dressing treatments.
Carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin analyses of the
salad vegetables
Representative samples of the salad vegetables from each of the 5
study periods were stored at 2708C. The carotenoid and tocopherol
concentrations in the vegetables were analyzed in duplicate with
the use of a modification of the method of Granado et al. (21). The
dried extract was reconstituted with 2 mL MTBE:methanol
(1:1, vol:vol). A 25-mL aliquot was injected into the HPLC-ECD
system. The phylloquinone in the salad vegetables was extracted
according to a modification of the method of Koivu et al. (22). The
hexane extract was evaporated to dryness under vacuum, and the
dried extract was reconstituted with 200 mL MTBE:methanol
(1:1, vol:vol). A 25-mL aliquot was injected into the HPLC-ECD
system. Additional details regarding these extraction protocols are
provided in Supplemental Methods.
HPLC-ECD analyses of the soybean oil
The concentrations of a-, d-, and g-tocopherols in the stripped
soybean oil used to prepare the salad dressings were analyzed with
the use of the rapid saponification protocol of Granado et al. (21).
The reconstituted extract was filtered with the use of a 0.2-mm
nylon syringe filter (Corning Inc.), and 100 mL was injected into
the HPLC-ECD system. The lutein and phylloquinone contents in
the stripped soybean oil were analyzed with the use of the method
of Puspitasari-Nienaber et al. (23). Briefly, 40 mg oil was dis-
solved in 2.5 mL methanol:MTBE (1:1, vol:vol) and filtered
through a 0.2-mm nylon filter. A 25-mL aliquot was then injected
directly into the HPLC-ECD system.
Data analyses
For the plasma chylomicron data, the outcome variables were the
0–9.5-h total AUC values for the carotenoids and fat-soluble vi-
tamins. Plasma chylomicron total AUC values were calculated by
the trapezoidal method with the use of carotenoid and fat-soluble
vitamin content (in the chylomicron fraction present in 1 L
plasma) as the y axis and time (hours) as the x axis. Total AUC
values included the area both above and below the baseline (0 h)
value. In addition, we determined maximum content in the plasma
chylomicron fraction (Cmax). The postprandial content of retinyl
palmitate in the plasma chylomicron fraction was used as an in-
dicator of the content of vitamin A, which was formed from the
provitamin A carotenoids in the salad vegetables (18, 24).
Statistical modeling
The dose-response relation between the grams of soybean oil
in the salad dressing and the absorption of individual carotenoid
and fat-soluble vitamins in the salad vegetables (with the use of
plasma chylomicron AUC and Cmax values as indicators of ab-
sorption) was modeled with the use of the following linear
mixed-effects random coefficient model (25):
Yijk ¼ a þ bXij þ a�
i þ b�
i Xij þ ck þ sBij þ eij
ð1Þ
where Yijk is the AUC or Cmax value for the ith subject, jth
amount of soybean oil in the salad dressing, and kth study pe-
riod; Xij is a continuous covariate for the jth amount of soybean
oil for the ith subject; gk is the period effect for the kth study
period; t is the regression coefficient for Bij; Bij is the baseline
chylomicron carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin content for the
ith subject and jth amount of soybean oil; and i = 1,.,12 sub-
jects, j = 1,.,5 amounts of soybean oil, and k = 1,.,5 study
periods. According to this model, the average true trajectory of
change in AUC or Cmax with increasing amount of soybean oil is
defined by fixed effects a (the intercept that represents the av-
erage true AUC or Cmax value when soybean oil is 0 g), b (the
slope coefficient that represents the average true change in AUC
or Cmax value when soybean oil increases), gk (the average true
period effect for the kth study period), and t (the regression
coefficient that represents the average true contribution of base-
line chylomicron carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin content to
the AUC or Cmax value). Thus, the group-averaged (mean) fixed
effects part of the model is
a þ bXij þ ck þ sBij
ð2Þ
a�
i and b�
i represent deviations of the intercepts and slopes of the
individual subjects from their respective population averages
(25). eij is the unexplained residual error associated with the
measurement of subject i at soybean oil amount j. Thus, the
subject-specific random-effects part of the model is
a�
i þ b�
i Xij þ eij
ð3Þ
The advantage of the linear mixed-effects random coefficient
model is that it predicts both subject-specific and group-average
trajectories of change in AUC and Cmax values with increasing
amounts of soybean oil. By incorporating random effects, the
group-average prediction model may be generalized to apply to
future unknown subjects.
For lutein, the 0–4-g soybean oil dose response showed no
evidence of subject-specific variation in the slopes. Therefore, a
linear mixed-effects random intercept model was used to model
the dose-response relation
Yijk ¼ a þ bXij þ a�
i þ ck þ sBij þ eij
ð4Þ
Based on our previous studies (7, 18), we used a Cohen’s d effect
size of 1.0 (large effect size) (26) as a basis for power calcula-
tions. Our sample size of 12 subjects would detect a soybean oil
slope effect (b) size of 1.0 in a 2-sided 5% test with 90% power.
All random coefficient models shown were linear as indicated by
P . 0.10 in the ANOVA lack-of-fit test.
Concordance
Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (Kendall’s W) was used
to evaluate whether there was significant agreement across the
individual carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins in the rank order

 of the 12 participants in regard to their chylomicron AUC
values after consuming the highest amount of soybean oil,
32 g. The value of W ranges between 0 and 1, with increasing
values reflecting increasing degrees of agreement in the rank
orders (27).
RESULTS
Participant compliance
Each of the 12 participants completed each of the 5 periods of
the study. There were only 2 deviations from the study protocol.
One participant took a single dose of drospirenone and ethinyl
estradiol and a second participant took a daily dose of norgestimate
and ethinyl estradiol during one of the 2-wk washout periods.
These steroid hormones could potentially increase hepatic clear-
ance of chylomicron remnants (28). The statistical analyses pre-
sented here included all data for all participants.
Carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins in the salads
The carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin contents in the salad
vegetables across the 5 study periods are shown in Table 1. The
stripped soybean oil that was used to prepare the salad dressings
contained low residual amounts of tocopherols and no detectable
carotenoids or phylloquinone. The analyzed mean 6 SD a-, d-,
and g-tocopherol concentrations in the stripped soybean oil
were 3.75 6 0.12 mg/g (8.71 6 0.28 nmol/g), 7.24 6 0.13 mg/g
(17.98 6 0.32 nmol/g), and 12.65 6 0.40 mg/g (30.36 6
0.96 nmol/g), respectively. The initial total tocopherol concen-
tration in the soybean oil before short-path distillation when
analyzed by Unilever R&D was 545 mg/g. Thus, the tocopherol
content was reduced by 96%.
The absorption of d-tocopherol was used as an indicator of the
potential contribution of the residual a- and g- tocopherol in
the stripped soybean oil to their quantified total absorption from
the salads. d-Tocopherol was a suitable indicator because 1)
d-tocopherol was not detected in the salad vegetables with the
exception of trace amounts (11 6 1 mg or 27.3 6 2.5 nmol) in
the romaine lettuce (Table 1), and 2) there is no selectivity in the
chylomicron-mediated absorption of tocopherol vitamers (29,
30). To be conservative, the small d-tocopherol contribution
from the romaine lettuce was ignored and the measured total
absorption of d-tocopherol from the salads was assumed to re-
flect solely the residual amounts in the stripped soybean oil. The
calculations were based on the mean increment in the chylo-
micron d-tocopherol AUC values, over the 0–32-g range of
soybean oil, which was 105 nmol $ h/L plasma (Supplemental
Table 1). If normalized for the ratio of the residual amounts of
a- and d-tocopherol in the stripped soybean oil (8.71 nmol/g,
a-tocopherol:17.98 nmol/g, d-tocopherol or 0.48:1), the ex-
pected contribution of the residual a-tocopherol in the oil to the
0–32-g soybean oil mean increment in the plasma chylomicron
a-tocopherol AUC was only 50 nmol $ h/L plasma (0.48 3
105 nmol ∙ h/L plasma). This contribution represented ,3% of the
actual 0–32-g soybean oil mean increment in the chylomicron
a-tocopherol AUC, which was 1939 nmol $ h/L plasma (Supple-
mental Table 1). This minor a-tocopherol contribution from the oil
was ignored. If normalized for the ratio of the residual g- and
d-tocopherol amounts in the stripped soybean oil (30.36 nmol/g,

 g-tocopherol:17.98 nmol/g, d-tocopherol or 1.69:1), the corresponding
contribution of the residual g-tocopherol in the oil to the 0–32-g
soybean oil mean increment in the plasma chylomicron g-tocopherol
AUC was 177 nmol $ h/L plasma (1.69 3 105 nmol $ h/L plasma).
This contribution from the stripped oil represented 46% of the
actual 0–32-g soybean oil mean increment in the chylomicron
g-tocopherol AUC, which was 388 nmol $ h/L plasma (Sup-
plemental Table 1). Due to the potential substantive contribu-
tion from the residual g-tocopherol in the stripped soybean oil,
unless otherwise specified, the dose-response for g-tocopherol
was analyzed in terms of the chylomicron total (a- plus g-)
tocopherol AUC values. The combined mean contribution of the
residual a- and g-tocopherol in the stripped oil, 227 nmol$h/L
plasma (50 nmol $ h/L plasma for a-tocopherol plus 177 nmol∙h/L
plasma for g-tocopherol), accounted for ,10% of the 0–32-g
soybean oil mean increment in the plasma chylomicron total (a-
plus g-) tocopherol AUC, which was 2332 nmol$h/L (Supple-
mental Table 1).

 Soybean oil–mediated effects on the postprandial plasma
chylomicron response
An HPLC-ECD chromatogram of the carotenoids and fat-
soluble vitamins in a postprandial chylomicron fraction is
shown in Supplemental Figure 2. Simultaneous analysis of
carotenoids, retinyl palmitate, tocopherols, and phylloquinone
revealed their remarkably similar absorption kinetics (Figures 1
and 2). The exceptions were the a- and g-tocopherol chylomicron
response curves for the lowest doses of soybean oil, 0 and 2 g
(Figure 2). After consuming the test salad with 0 or 2 g of oil, the
a- and g-tocopherol contents in the chylomicron fraction initially
fell below their baseline (0 h) contents in the chylomicron frac-
tion. (Please see Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Re-
sults for the statistical analyses.) When the salads were consumed

 with the salad dressing containing 0 g soybean oil, there was
negligible absorption of all carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins
(Figures 1 and 2). In the case of each carotenoid and fat-soluble
vitamin, the highest plasma chylomicron AUC value occurred
when the salad vegetables were consumed with salad dressing
containing 32 g soybean oil (P , 0.002; Supplemental Table 1).
(Please see Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Results for
the statistical analyses).
Modeling the dose-response relation between soybean oil
and carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption
Across the entire 0–32-g range, the amount of soybean oil in
the salad dressing was a significant linear predictor of the in-
testinal absorption, as indicated by chylomicron AUC and Cmax
values, of a-carotene, lycopene, and retinyl palmitate (Tables 2
and 3, Figure 3). A nonsignificant lack-of-fit test indicated that a
linear model also fit the increase in phylloquinone absorption
across the entire 0–32-g range of soybean oil. The group slope
variable, b (soybean oil effect), for phylloquinone approached
but did not achieve significance (P = 0.057) due to the wide
variability in response among the subjects (Tables 2 and 3).
Our data indicate that the amount of coconsumed lipid was a
key determinant of the absorptive capacity of the small intestine
for dietary b-carotene, a major source of vitamin A. A linear
model predicted the absorption of b-carotene across a limited
0–8-g range of soybean oil (Tables 2 and 3). When the amount
of soybean oil increased from 8 to 32 g, about half of the sub-
jects showed diminished responsiveness in terms of the increase
in their plasma chylomicron b-carotene AUC values (Figure 4).
This saturation of the soybean oil effect could reflect the higher
content of b-carotene relative to the other carotenoids and fat-
soluble vitamins in the salad vegetables (Table 1).
Over a more limited 0–4-g range, the chylomicron AUC values
for lutein, a-tocopherol, and total tocopherol were linearly related
to the amount of soybean oil (P , 0.003; Table 2). Across the
entire 0–32-g range of soybean oil, the AUC and Cmax responses
for lutein and a- and g-tocopherols were nonlinear as indicated
by a nonsignificant lack-of-fit test. Although linear, the 0–4-g
soybean oil responses were disproportionately low compared with
the responses to the higher amounts of soybean oil (Figure 4).
Based on the b values (Table 2), 4 g soybean oil would be pre-
dicted to increase the chylomicron AUC for lutein, a-tocopherol,
and total tocopherol by a mean of 2, 136, and 180 nmol $ h/L
plasma, respectively. These chylomicron AUC increments repre-
sent only 5–8% of the 0–32-g soybean oil mean increments in the
chylomicron AUC for lutein, a-tocopherol, and total tocopherol
(42, 1939, and 2332 nmol $ h/L plasma, respectively; Supple-
mental Table 1). Because 2 and 4 g soybean oil produced only
subtle gains in lutein, a-tocopherol, and total tocopherol ab-
sorption, for these treatments, there was no clear Cmax (Figures 1
and 2). As a result, the group mean 0–4-g soybean oil effect, b,
was not statistically significant for Cmax (Table 3).
Figure 3 presents the results of the use of the linear mixed-
effects random coefficient model to fit the 0–32-g soybean oil
data for all 12 participants (regressing predicted chylomicron
AUC values for a-carotene, lycopene, phylloquinone, and ret-
inyl palmitate on grams of soybean oil individually by partici-
pant). Although in each case there was a strong group-average
dose-response relation (Tables 2 and 3), the variability in the
subject-specific slopes, b�
i , was strikingly high. The CV ranged
from 96% for a-carotene (1.16 6 1.12 nmol $ h/L plasma per
gram of soybean oil) to 162% for phylloquinone (0.71 6
1.15 nmol$h/L plasma per gram of soybean oil). There was
similar high variability in the 0–8-g soybean oil data for
b-carotene; the CV for b�
i for the subject-specific trajectories of
change in the AUC was 113% (3.00 6 3.41 nmol$h/L plasma
per gram of soybean oil) (Figure 4). Several participants (most
notably subject 4) showed a dramatic effect of soybean oil in
enhancing the absorption of the carotenoids and fat-soluble

 vitamins from the salad vegetables. Surprisingly, other partici-
pants showed almost no response, such that the chylomicron
carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin AUC values for 32 g soybean
oil were similar to those for 0 g soybean oil. The nutritional
implications are illustrated by a comparison of subjects 3 and 4,
who were, respectively, the least and the most responsive to the
soybean oil. When modeling the effects of 0–32 g soybean oil on
the AUC for lycopene, the b�
i coefficient for participant 3, who
was the least responsive, was 0.215 nmol $ h/L plasma per gram
of soybean oil. In contrast, the b�
i coefficient for participant 4,
who was the most responsive, was 5.060 nmol $ h/L plasma per
gram of soybean oil. Thus, there was a 24-fold difference across
the participants in the predicted enhancing effect of the soybean
oil on lycopene absorption. The amount of soybean oil needed to
achieve a similar nutritional benefit was highly individualized.
Within the bounds of the linear response, the random co-
efficient model indicated that the chylomicron carotenoid and
fat-soluble vitamin AUC could be predicted by the intercept
(chylomicron AUC for 0 g of soybean oil) and the slope (soybean
oil effect). The intercept included these contributors to the
chylomicron AUC: 1) the baseline (0 h) chylomicron carotenoid
and fat-soluble vitamin content and 2) the absorbed carotenoids
and fat-soluble vitamins for 0 g soybean oil. As expected, the
baseline chylomicron carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin con-
tents were low, and there was negligible absorption of caroten-
oids and fat-soluble vitamins when the salads were consumed
with 0 g soybean oil (Figures 1 and 2) (Please see Supplemental
Methods and Supplemental Results for the statistical analyses).
Therefore, the observed large interindividual differences in ca-
rotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin bioavailability (Figures 3 and 4)
could be predicted almost entirely by the differences in slope
(i.e., the responsiveness to the coconsumed oil or lipid).
Comparing carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin
bioavailability
Given the simultaneous quantification of the carotenoids and fat-
soluble vitamins and their similar absorption kinetics, we were able
to compare their plasma chylomicron Cmax values for the 32-g
soybean oil treatment. To account for the higher baseline (0 h)
content of the tocopherols in the plasma chylomicron fraction, for
this comparison, baseline correction was applied to the AUC
values. The amount of each absorbed carotenoid and fat-soluble
vitamin circulating in the plasma chylomicron fraction at Cmax
was estimated by multiplying the baseline-adjusted Cmax (nmol/L
plasma) by each subject’s plasma volume (0.0427 L/kg body
weight) (31, 32). The geometric means for the circulating amounts
were 17.5 nmol a-carotene, 41.7 nmol b-carotene, 28.1 nmol
lutein, 18.7 nmol lycopene, and 2.7 nmol phylloquinone (Sup-
plemental Table 2). These circulating amounts represented these
respective percentages of the amounts consumed in the salad
vegetables: 0.14%, 0.19%, 0.27%, 0.22%, and 0.57%. The lower
fractional circulating amounts of a- and b-carotene, compared
with the nonprovitamin A carotenoids, lutein and lycopene, would
be expected due to the partial bioconversion of the former to
retinyl esters, including retinyl palmitate. These minute fractional
amounts suggest that, even when consumed with 32 g soybean oil,
the bioavailability of the carotenoids and phylloquinone was re-
markably low. After consuming 32 g tocopherol-stripped soybean
oil, the geometric means for the contents of a-tocopherol and total
(a- plus g-) tocopherol in the plasma chylomicron fraction at the
baseline-adjusted Cmax were 1154 and 1370 nmol, respectively.
These amounts represent w14% of the tocopherols in the salad
vegetables (Supplemental Table 2). These single measurements at
Cmax underrepresent total absorption and exclude 1) carotenoids,
phylloquinone, and tocopherols already cleared from the plasma

as indicators of absorption. Solid lines show the AUC data for individual subjects. The 0–32 g soybean oil dose response for these carotenoids and fat-soluble
vitamins did not fit a linear mixed-effects random coefficient model as indicated by significant ANOVA lack-of-fit tests, P , 0.04. Insets show the linear dose-

 or currently in chylomicron remnants not isolated with the plasma
chylomicron fraction and 2) tocopherols secreted by enterocytes
in HDL in a secondary, minor pathway (30, 33). Nevertheless, at
Cmax, the percentage of the a- and g-tocopherol in the salad
vegetables that was circulating in plasma chylomicrons was w50-
to 60-fold higher compared with the percentage of the non-
provitamin A carotenoids lutein and lycopene. (These carotenoids
were used for comparison because they did not undergo metab-
olism to vitamin A). A higher fraction of a-tocopherol and total
tocopherol was circulating in the plasma chylomicron fraction at
Cmax despite the higher content of each carotenoid compared with
that of the a- and g-tocopherol in the test salads (Table 1).
Rank order
When analyzed for the highest amount of soybean oil, 32 g,
there was strong agreement across the individual micronutrients
in the rank order of the 12 subjects in terms of their plasma
chylomicron carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin AUC values
[Kendall’s coefficient of concordance W = 0.65, P value for the
test of W = 0: P , 0.0001]. (Retinyl palmitate was not included
in this ranking analysis because it was a metabolite of the pro-
vitamin A carotenoids). Thus, participants who absorbed higher
amounts of one carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin were also
likely to absorb higher amounts of the others. This concordance
is consistent with shared mechanisms of absorption.
DISCUSSION
Across the entire 0–32-g range of soybean oil, the average
absorption of a-carotene, lycopene, and retinyl palmitate and
vitamin A could be largely predicted by the amount of soybean
oil added to fresh vegetables of dietary importance to US con-
sumers. There was also a linear dose-response relation for phyl-
loquinone; due to interindividual variability, the soybean oil effect
(slope, b) approached but did not reach significance (P = 0.057).
The absorption of b-carotene was linear over a limited range of
0–8 g soybean oil, which likely reflected the higher content of
b-carotene in the vegetable salads (Table 1). There were minor
linear increases in the absorption of lutein, a-tocopherol, and total
tocopherol over a more limited range of 0–4 g soybean oil. An
important implication is that, within the specified linear bounds,
any additional soybean oil would be predicted to increase the
absorption of these carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins.
Compared with the other carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins,
our findings indicate that lutein, a-tocopherol, and total tocopherol
bioavailability may benefit more from amounts .4 g soybean oil.
Across the 0–32-g range of soybean oil, the dose-response for
lutein, a-tocopherol, and total (a- plus g-) tocopherol was non-
linear because of a disproportionately lower absorption response
to 0–4 g compared with 8 or 32 g soybean oil (Figure 4). The
xanthophyll carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, and the tocoph-
erols were reported to share 2 pathways for basolateral secretion
from the enterocyte: the major triacylglycerol-dependent pathway
involving chylomicron assembly and a minor ATP-binding cas-
sette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated pathway with lipid-poor
apolipoprotein A1 as the acceptor, leading to small HDL formation
(30, 33, 34). In human intestinal cells, both a- and g-tocopherol
were reported to inhibit apo A-I–mediated cholesterol efflux by
downregulating ABCA1 via reduced liver X receptor transactivation
(35). Subsequently, in human liver cells and macrophages,
a- and g-tocopherol were shown to inhibit expression of the
ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 (36). The
silencing of ABCG1 expression in these cells decreased a- and
g-tocopherol efflux to HDL. These findings suggest that the intes-
tinal secretion of a- and g-tocopherol to HDL in our study may have
been inhibited by increased tocopherol uptake in the presence of
more oil or lipid. The chylomicron-mediated absorption of to-
copherols could then potentially have become disproportionately
more important, resulting in the observed nonlinear dose response.
Previously, investigators compared the enhancing effects of 3
different amounts of oil or lipid on the absorption of individual
carotenoids and did not observe a linear response. Unlu et al. (8)
reported that, compared with control salads (no avocado), ca-
rotenoid absorption from salad vegetables was increased to the
same extent by 12 or 24 g lipid from avocado. Goltz et al. (9)
reported that carotenoid absorption from salad vegetables was
similarly enhanced by 3 or 8 g lipid added as canola oil, soybean
oil, or butter. When considering all lipid sources, 20 g lipid
promoted more absorption than 3 or 8 g. The discrepancy with
our findings may be attributed to our use of advanced linear
mixed-effects regression modeling. Especially with the in-
corporation of 5 dose amounts, linear mixed-effects regression
modeling has the flexibility to treat soybean oil dose as a con-
tinuous variable rather than only estimating discrete mean AUC
and Cmax outcomes (37). An added advantage is that the linear
regression models may then be used to interpolate the expected
change in carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption due to
any amount of soybean oil within the bounds of the linear range.
As highlighted by a recent review (38), there is a need for better
understanding of the basis for the huge differences in carotenoid
bioavailability among healthy individuals. Although candidate con-
tributors to interindividual variability have been identified, much less
is known about their relative importance (38). Linear mixed-effects
modeling appropriately characterizes heterogeneity by assessing both
individual-specific and group-average dose-response trends. As a
result, our study revealed that the large interindividual differences in
carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin bioavailability were largely me-
diated by the variable responsiveness to the coconsumed lipid. This
observation is consistent with recent reports that single nucleotide
polymorphisms in 4–7 genes related to the postprandial chylomicron
triacylglycerol response were among 25–28 single nucleotide
polymorphisms in 12–16 genes associated with b-carotene and ly-
copene bioavailability from processed tomatoes (39, 40). We also
showed the extent to which the reported “nonresponder” carotenoid
bioavailability phenotype (41) is defined by nonresponse to lipid.
Thus, our findings highlight the importance of personalized guid-
ance relating to the nutritional benefits of added oil or lipid.
By addressing the holistic effects of 32 g added oil or lipid on the
absorption of multiple carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins, we
identified phenotypic profiles. Study participants could be
stratified according to the consistency of their bioavailability re-
sponses across the carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins. This
concordance indicates these carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins
share mechanisms for the enhancing effects of the soybean oil,
which could include the following (42): 1) providing an oil
phase in which the fat-soluble carotenoids and vitamins could be
solubilized or dispersed during emulsification; 2) stimulating
biliary secretion and thereby facilitating micelle formation; 3) on
hydrolysis, providing fatty acids and monoglycerides, which are
needed for the assembly of micelles; 4) providing fatty acids that

 may modify micellar size and surface electric charge and thereby
influence interactions with scavenger receptors SR-BI and
CD36 (43); and 5) inducing the formation of chylomicrons. Under
controlled conditions, we showed markedly different combined
carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin exposures among healthy in-
dividuals consuming the same lipid and vegetables.
The bioavailability of the a- and g-tocopherol in the salad veg-
etables was higher than that of the phylloquinone and dramatically
higher than that of the carotenoids. There are few human studies of
the bioavailability of vitamin E in food sources (44). Recently, the
mean fractional absorption of a-tocopherol in deuterium-labeled
cooked collard greens consumed with only 1.6 g fat was reported
to be $24% (45). Among US adults who obtain vitamin E only
from foods, 96% have vitamin E intakes below the estimated av-
erage requirement (46). Because vitamin E deficiency is not prev-
alent, there is concern that either the estimated average requirement
is too high or a-tocopherol bioavailability in foods is under-
estimated (45). The relatively high a-tocopherol bioavailability in
the salad vegetables suggests their contribution to meeting vitamin
E requirements has been underestimated.
The limitations of this study include the following: 1) measure-
ment of carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption from a single
salad, which may not predict changes in carotenoid and fat-soluble
vitamin status after repeated salad consumption and 2) unknown
applicability of our findings to processed vegetables and other
lipids. The strengths include the following: 1) use of linear mixed-
effects random coefficient modeling to appropriately characterize
interindividual heterogeneity and thereby also minimize bias in the
group estimates of the dose-response trajectory, 2) simultaneous
high-sensitivity quantification of the chylomicron response curves
for 9 carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins (including d-tocopherol),
and 3) realistic test salads that incorporated the major US dietary
sources of carotenoids, phylloquinone (47), and salad and cooking
oil (16). In conclusion, our findings indicate that the ability to re-
spond to oil or lipid in the diet is a key factor that determines an
individual’s global absorption of carotenoids and fat-soluble
vitamins from vegetables with implications for their micro-
nutrient status and preventable disease risk.
