ABSTRACT
Biomarkers of diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms may improve risk stratification for incident or progressive
diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in persons with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate such biomarkers, we performed a
nested case-control study (n=190 cases of incident DKD and 190 matched controls) and a prospective cohort
study (n=1156) using banked baseline plasma samples from participants of randomized, controlled trials of early
(ACCORD) and advanced (VA NEPHRON-D) DKD. We assessed the association and discrimination obtained
with baseline levels of plasma TNF receptor–1 (TNFR-1), TNFR-2, and kidney injury molecule–1 (KIM-1) for the
outcomes of incident DKD (ACCORD) and progressive DKD (VA-NEPHRON-D). At baseline, median con-
centrations of TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1 were roughly two-fold higher in the advanced DKD population
(NEPHRON-D) than in the early DKD population (ACCORD). In both cohorts, patients who reached the renal
outcome had higher baseline levels than those who did not reach the outcome. Associations between
doubling in TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1 levels and risk of the renal outcomes were significant for both
cohorts. Inclusion of these biomarkers in clinical models increased the area under the curve (SEM) for
predicting the renal outcome from 0.68 (0.02) to 0.75 (0.02) in NEPHRON-D. Systematic review of the
literature illustrated high consistency in the association between these biomarkers of inflammation and
renal outcomes in DKD. In conclusion, TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1 independently associated with higher
risk of eGFR decline in persons with early or advanced DKD. Moreover, addition of these biomarkers to
clinical prognostic models significantly improved discrimination for the renal outcome.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a multifactorial syn-
drome that involves several pathways that result in pro-
gressive decline in kidney function. Despite improved
understanding of the pathogenesis of DKD over the
years, the clinical strategy for prognosticating incident
DKD and progression of established DKD still largely
depends on traditional markers such as eGFR and al-
buminuria. However, eGFR and albuminuria are only
modestly useful for risk prediction, particularly in pa-
tientswithpreservedlevelsofrenalfunction.1Moreover,
severalother pathwaysmaybeinvolved witheGFRpro-
gression in patients with overt albuminuria, including
inflammation, endothelial injury, and tubular injury.2,3

as central in DKD involves TNF. Gene expression

 transcripts showing an inverse correlation with eGFR clus-
tered around TNF-a.4 TNF-a directly stimulates podocytes to
produce several cytokines, utilizing TNF receptors (TNFRs).5
TNF cell surface receptors are shed into the extracellular
space, including into blood, after cleavage with TNF-a cleav-
ing enzyme. In clinical studies, plasma TNFR-1 and TNFR-2
concentrations have been shown to be associated with the
development of ESRD in persons with type 2 diabetes6,7
and with incident DKD in persons with type 1 diabetes.8,9
Kidney injury molecule–1 (KIM-1) is expressed in the api-
cal membrane of proximal tubular cells in response to injury
and promotes kidney fibrosis. KIM-1 may enter the circula-
tion because of increased transepithelial permeability or loss
of epithelial cell polarity with basolateral membrane expres-
sion in early injury. In a small study of persons with type 1
diabetes, plasma KIM-1 levels predicted rate of eGFR loss10
and ESRD risk during a mean of 10 years of follow-up, after
adjustment for confounders.11
We hypothesized that plasma TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1
would predict eGFR decline in both early and advanced DKD
above and beyond clinical variables alone. We measured
plasma biomarkers in stored samples from two recently com-
pleted clinical trials in patients with early (Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD] trial) and ad-
vanced (Veterans Administration NEPHROpathy iN Diabetes
study [VA-NEPHRON-D]) DKD and tested their association
with eGFR decline.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
ACCORD Cohort (Early DKD)
Among the 380 participants (190 matched case-control pairs),
the mean age was 62 years. Participants were well matched with
regards to age, sex, race, baseline Chronic Kidney Disease Ep-
idemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) eGFR, and urine albu-
min creatinine ratio (UACR) (Table 1). Both cases and controls
had preserved renal function at baseline (defined as eGFR.60
ml/min per 1.73 m2). Cases and controls also had similar body
mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes, and hemoglobin A1C.
In contrast, a greater proportion of cases had a history of
cardiovascular disease, cases had slightly higher baseline
mean arterial pressure, and a greater proportion of cases
were randomized to fibrate intervention. Participants classi-
fied as cases had a median of 37 ml/min lower eGFR
than controls at the end of 5 years of follow-up (46 versus
83 ml/min per 1.73 m2; P,0.01) but there was no significant
difference in UACR. The annual rate of eGFR decline was higher
in cases versus controls (7.42 versus 1.67 ml/min per 1.73 m2;
P,0.01).
VA-NEPHRON-D Cohort (Advanced DKD)
In NEPHRON-D, those who reached the renal end point were
3 years older, had lower BMI, higher diastolic blood pressure,
lower hemoglobin concentrations, and higher LDL concentra-
tions. Median concentrations of the biomarkers were roughly
two-fold higher in NEPHRON-D versus ACCORD (Table 1).
Pearson correlations between the log-transformed urinary
biomarkers and other DKD risk factors are shown in Table 2.
TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 were strongly correlated with each other
in both cohorts, and KIM-1 was moderately correlated with
TNFR-1 and -2 in both cohorts. The three plasma biomarkers
were moderately correlated with UACR in both cohorts, but in
NEPHRON-D (advanced DKD), the degree of correlation be-
tween the three plasma biomarkers was much stronger than in
ACCORD (preserved renal function).
Association of Plasma Biomarkers with Renal End
Points in the Two Cohorts
ACCORD Trial Cohort (Early DKD)
Cases had higher baseline levels of TNFR-1 (2526 versus 1963
pg/ml), TNFR-2 (7590 versus 6186 pg/ml), and KIM-1 (254
versus179pg/ml)atbaselinecomparedwithcontrols(Table1).
After adjustment for all covariates, including baseline eGFR
and UACR, TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1 were significantly
associated with the renal end point. The adjusted odds ratio
(OR) for renal end points per doubling in biomarker was 2.4
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.5 to 4.0), 3.2 (95% CI,
1.7 to 6.1), and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.7 to 3.5) for TNFR-1, TNFR-2,
and KIM-1, respectively (model 3 in Figure 1, Table 3). We also
stratified the biomarkers by quartiles, and found strong asso-
ciations for the fourth quartile compared with the lowest
quartile: TNFR-1 fourth versus first quartile, adjusted OR,
3.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 7.3); TNFR-2 adjusted OR, 8.4 (95% CI,
3.0 to 23.4); and KIM-1 adjusted OR, 7.5 (95% CI, 2.8 to 20.0)
(model 3 in Supplemental Table 1). There was also evidence of
graded signal for the second and third quartiles of TNFR-2
and KIM-1, with no increased risk seen until the third quartile
of TNFR-1.
VA-NEPHRON-D Cohort (Advanced DKD)
Those reaching the renal end point had higher baseline levels
of TNFR-1 (5481 versus 4095 pg/ml), TNFR-2 (12910 versus
10461 pg/ml), and KIM-1 (735 versus 373 pg/ml) compared
with those without the renal end point (Table 1). After adjust-
ment for all covariates, TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1 were
associated with the renal end point (Table 3). The adjusted OR
for renal end points per fold-increase in biomarker was 2.4
(95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3), 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.8), and 1.7 (95% CI,
1.5 to 2.1), for TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and KIM-1, respectively
(model 3 in Figure 1, Table 3). In quartile analyses with indi-
vidual markers, TNFR-1 fourth versus first quartile had an
adjusted OR, 3.5 (95% CI, 1.9 to 6.3); TNFR-2 adjusted OR,
3.8 (95% CI, 2.0 to 7.3); and KIM-1 adjusted OR, 6.3 (95% CI,
3.3 to 12.3) (Supplemental Table 1).
The rates of eGFR decline by quartiles of each of the bio-
markers are shown in Table 4. The rate of eGFR decline was
most pronounced for KIM-1, showing a stepwise increase
by increasing quartiles. The annual rate of eGFR decline was

 5.5 ml/min per year in the fourth quartile versus 2.0 ml/min
per year in the first quartile of KIM-1 (P=0.001).
Discrimination and Reclassification in NEPHRON-D
Theareaunder thecurve(AUC)for theclinicalmodelalonefor
therenalend point was 0.68.AdditionofTNFR-1 to theclinical
model increased the AUC to 0.72 (P=0.003), TNFR-2 to 0.71
(P=0.01), and KIM-1 to 0.74 (P=0.001; Table 5). With all three
biomarkers plus the clinical model, the AUC was 0.75
(P,0.001 compared with clinical model alone). These three
biomarkers also provided excellent reclassification (net reclas-
sification index) ranging from 0.33 to 0.54 and the integrated
discrimination improvement was 0.052 for the clinical factors
plus the biomarkers.
Literature Review of Association of TNFR-1 and TNFR-
2 with Renal Outcomes
We found four other studies that assessed the independent
association between TNFR-1 or TNFR-2 and renal outcomes.6–8
As shown in the forest plots, both TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 were
consistently and robustly associated with the renal outcomes of
ESRD, incident CKD, and eGFR decline (Supplemental Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
In two contemporary cohorts of trial participants with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we found that plasma TNFR-1,
TNFR-2, and KIM-1 were each independently associated

 with progressive eGFR decline over time in a strong, graded
manner over a broad range of baseline renal function. These
associations remained robust even after adjustment for several
confounding variables, including baseline eGFR and albumin-
uria. Most impressive was that the magnitude of association
between the continuum of the three markers and the renal
outcome was strikingly similar per doubling in concentration
within each cohort. This occurred despite
the fact that the ACCORD population
had virtually no prevalent DKD at base-
line, and the NEPHRON-D population
had 100% prevalent DKD at baseline.
Moreover, the baseline concentrations of
these biomarkers were nearly double in
NEPHRON-D compared with ACCORD,
but the stepwise increase in risk above the
risk associated with the lowest values was
preserved for both cohorts. Finally, we also
found that as compared with a prediction
model on the basis of clinical variables, in-
cluding baseline eGFR and albuminuria,
each biomarker demonstrated improved risk prediction for
renal outcomes.
DKD is a complex, multifactorial syndrome that is the
leading cause of ESRD in the United States. Mechanistic un-
derstanding into DKD in persons with type 1 and 2 diabetes
has revealed that progressive DKD is not only the conse-
quence of hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances, but
also due to inflammation. One of the
key pathways that are activated in human
DKD is the TNF pathway (among others).
TNF is a pleotrophic cytokine that is pro-
duced predominantly by immune cells
that can function in its membrane-bound
form or can be released as a soluble circu-
lating 17 kD polypeptide upon cleavage
by a metalloproteinase.12–14 TNF may
bind to two transmembrane receptors
designated TNFR-1 (p55 or CD120a) or
TNFR-2 (p75 or CD120b).15,16 TNFR-1 is
present primarily in glomeruli and endo-
thelial cells whereas TNFR-2 is only ex-
pressed transcriptionally in renal cells in
various kidney diseases.17,18 Although
TNFR-2 functions as a ligand presenting
receptor to TNFR-1, it may have indepen-
dent functions.19
The findings within our study are in ac-
cordance with the results from previous
studies. Four previous studies have also
identified an association between TNFR-1
and TNFR-2 and renal function decline
in DKD.6–9 The results are remarkably
consistent across these six cohorts (the 4
previously published plus ACCORD and
NEPHRON-D) for the strength of associa-
tion for both TNFR-1 and -2 with the renal
outcomes.
Previous data on plasma KIM-1 as a bio-
marker for CKD or DKD is not as plentiful
as for the TNFRs. KIM-1 is expressed in the
apical membrane of proximal tubular cells

 in response to injury and promotes kidney fibrosis. KIM-1
was largely studied in the urine as first a marker for AKI and
subsequently as a potential biomarker for CKD. However,
there is now knowledge that KIM-1 may enter the circulation
because of increased transepithelial permeability or loss of
epithelial cell polarity with basolateral membrane expression
in chronic kidney injury. In recently published studies in
persons with type 1 diabetes, plasma KIM-1 levels were in-
dependently associated with eGFR loss in patients with nor-
mal renal function10 at baseline and plasma KIM-1 strongly
predicted ESRD risk in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
and albuminuria.11
There are few interventions to prevent DKD or ameliorate
progression in those with established DKD. Several agents are
being actively tested in clinical trials.
However, because of low event rates and
long follow-up for event accrual, many
trials are inefficient and resource-intensive.
Thus, there is a great need for robust prog-
nostic biomarkers for DKD that can allow
selective enrollment of those patients with
high likelihood of events that would facil-
itate more efficient clinical trials with
higher likelihood of success. In addi-
tion, identification of these high-risk par-
ticipants might be valuable for targeted
enrollment in clinical trials, leading to
increased events over shorter follow-up pe-
riods, ultimately culminating in shorter, ef-
ficient trial design. This is consistent with
the Food and Drug Administration guid-
ance for enrichment strategies for clinical
trials.20
Hypothetically, if the panel of the three biomarkers
(TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and plasma KIM-1) that has AUC of 0.75
for predicting progression of GFR decline was added as an
enrichment criteria for a phase 3 interventional trial of DKD,
trial feasibility would be improved through enhanced selection
of those patients with DKD most at risk for progression. The
samplesizereductionwiththeuseofprognosticbiomarkerscan
be simulated under varying assumptions using this website:
http://prognosticenrichment.com/.
Some limitations of this study deserve mention.
ACCORD and NEPHRON-D were trials conducted before
the implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitor drugs, which have
been recently shown to decrease risk for progression of kid-
ney disease, as well as cardiovascular disease and death. The
VA NEPHRON-D trial was stopped early, at a median of 2.2
years, thus follow-up was not extremely long, and was less
than half of the follow-up in ACCORD. Also, there were key
differences in the types of participants enrolled into the two
trials and the outcomes observed in veterans enrolled into
NEPHRON-D may not be generalizable to other popula-
tions. However, the consistency of the signals provided by
the plasma biomarkers despite the heterogeneity of the case-
mix and covariate structure of the two cohorts is also a key
strength, and shows the generalizabilityof the findings across
the spectrum of kidney disease.
In summary, TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and plasma KIM-1 levels
were associated with higher risk of eGFR decline in T2DM
persons with both early (ACCORD) and established (VA-
NEPHRON-D) DKD. The consistency of evidence in these
two cohorts along with the previously published literature
would suggest that the TNFRs have sufficient evidence to be
considered for qualification as prognostic biomarkers in
T2DM. Moreover, these robust markers can be leveraged as
drug development tools to facilitate targeted enrollment of
higher risk patients for conducting clinical trials as well as
informing better risk prediction in individual patients.

sustained (on two or more visits $3 months apart) decline in eGFR of $40% from baseline eGFR. In VA-
NEPHRON-D, renal outcome is defined as the occurrence of a decline in the eGFR (an absolute de-
crease of $30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 if the eGFR was $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at randomization or a
relative decrease of $50% if the eGFR was ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) or ESRD (defined by the initiation
of maintenance dialysis, receipt of kidney transplant, or an eGFR of ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2).

 CONCISE METHODS
Participants
The ACCORD Trial
The ACCORD trial enrolled individuals with T2DM, with hemoglo-
bin A1C of 7.5% or more, between the ages of 40 and 79 years with
cardiovascular disease, or between the ages of 55 and 79 years with
anatomic evidence of significant atherosclerosis, albuminuria, left
ventricular hypertrophy, or at least two additional risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, across the United States and Canada, and tested
three different interventions (glycemic control, BP targets, and
fibrates).21 Individuals with a serum creatinine level .1.5 mg/dl
were excluded. Total follow-up of patients averaged over 5 years and
kidney function was assessed every 4 months. The study banked blood
specimens on participants from the baseline visit and 24 months.
VA-NEPHRON-D
VA-NEPHRON-Dwasamulticenter,prospective,randomized,placebo-
controlledparallelgrouptrialtotesttheefficacyofthecombinationofan
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi; lisinopril) with an an-
giotensin receptor blocker (ARB; losartan), as compared with standard
treatmentwith anARB alone,onthe progressionofDKD.22Participants
were individuals with T2DM with overt albuminuria (.300 mg/g cre-
atinine) and an eGFR between 30 and 89.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The
inclusion criteria were designed to select a study sample that was as
reflective as possible of the larger population of Veterans Health Ad-
ministration outpatients with T2DM and nephropathy that would be
candidates for ACEi and ARB therapy. The intervention lasted for a
median of 2.2 years. Kidney function was assessed every 3 months.
The study banked blood specimens on 1256 of the 1448 participants
at the baseline visit (Supplemental Figure 2).
Selection of Cases and Controls in ACCORD Trial
In ACCORD, we evaluated the association of the plasma biomarkers
with DKD using a nested case-control design, due to the large number
of participants in ACCORD and the low event rate. Of the 10,251
ACCORD participants, 3270 had both blood and urine available at
baseline and 24 months. We defined incident DKD in ACCORD as
achieving an eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 along with a sustained
(on two or more visits $3 months apart) decline in eGFR of $40%
from baseline eGFR. This has been shown to be a viable alternative
end point for CKD progression and is independently associated with
mortality and ESRD.23 From the 3270, 190 had a sustained eGFR
decline of $40% and we individually matched them to 190 controls
on six key characteristics (age within 5 years, sex, race, baseline mean
arterial pressure [within 5 mmHg], baseline albuminuria [within 100
mg/mg], and baseline eGFR within 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2).
Renal Outcomes in VA-NEPHRON-D Trial
As described in the primary VA-NEPHRON-D trial, the renal end
point was the first occurrence of a decline in the eGFR (an absolute
decrease of $30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 if the eGFR was $60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 at randomization or a relative decrease of $50% if the
eGFR was ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) or ESRD (defined by the initi-
ation of maintenance dialysis, receipt of kidney transplant, or an
eGFR of ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Changes in eGFR were confirmed
at least 4 weeks after treatment of potentially reversible factors. All
patients with availability of baseline serum and urine samples were
included in this study.
Biomarker Measurements
Plasma samples taken at the time of randomization and stored at 280°C
in both trial cohorts were used to derive the baseline biomarker measures.
Plasma concentrations of TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 were measured via the
2-plex 96-well prototype cytokine array from Mesoscale Diagnostics
(Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD). The average intra-assay
coefficient of variation (CV) was ,10% for the calibrators as well as
for the quality control (QC) sample. The inter-assay CV for TNFR-1
was 10% and for TNRF-2 was 5.5%–9.28%. The average lower limit
of detection obtained from multiple runs was 5.27 pg/ml for TNFR-1
and 0.20 pg/ml for TNFR-2.
Plasma concentrations of KIM-1 were also measured via an assay
from Mesoscale Diagnostics. The intra-assay CV for the calibrators
was ,10% and the inter-assay CV was 10.5%, and the average lower
limit of detection obtained from multiple runs was 0.5 pg/ml.
Assessment of Covariates in the Cohorts
Seven covariates assessed in the ACCORD trial were used in this
analysis. BMI was defined as weight divided by the square of height
(kilograms per square meters). BP was on the basis of the average of
three measurements using an automated device after 5 minutes’ rest
with the participant seated in a chair. Serum creatinine was deter-
mined using the Roche Creatinine Plus enzymatic assay with spec-
trometric analysis on a Roche Double Modular P Analytics analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and eGFR was calculated from
the measured serum creatinine by the CKD-EPI equation.24 Urine
albumin was determined by immunonephelometry on a Siemens BN
II nephelometer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY)
and urinary creatinine (Cr) by a modified Jaffé reaction. Urinary
albumin excretion was estimated from a single spot urine collection
by computing the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (Alb/Cr) in units of

 milligrams per gram. Medication use, cardiovascular disease,
and smoking history were all self-reported by participants. In the
NEPHRON-D study, the covariates used in the current analysis were
treatment arm, baseline eGFR strata (,60 or $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2),
albuminuria strata (albumin-to-creatinine ratio #1000 or .1000 mg/g
Cr), age, race, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and other BP medications at
NEPHRON-D randomization time.
Statistical Analyses
Primary Analyses
We expressed descriptive results for the participant baseline character-
istics and biomarkers as either mean with SD or, in skewed variables,
as median with interquartile range. We made statistical comparisons
between groups by t tests for data that were normally distributed,
Wilcoxon tests for skewed continuous data, and chi-squared tests for
categoric data.
We evaluated the association of each biomarker (expressed as a
continuous log base 2–transformed variable) with the renal end
point. In ACCORD, conditional logistic regression was applied for
the case-control design. In NEPHRON-D, standard logistic regres-
sion was applied where the renal end point occurring any time
during the follow-up was counted as an event, and otherwise count-
ed as a nonevent. For each cohort, we considered three models.
Model 1 evaluated marginal association by including only individ-
ual biomarkers. Model 2 provided partial association by control-
ling for study design which included treatment arm assignment,
baseline eGFR, and albuminuria strata. Model 3 further adjusted
for other demographic and clinical variables known to associate
with risk for eGFR decline (e.g., age, race, systolic blood pressure,
diastolic blood pressure, ACEi/ARB use). We also applied the mod-
els 1–3 to the categoric biomarker grouped by quartiles for the renal
outcomes.
We used AUC to evaluate biomarker predictive performance
for renal end point. We calculated the AUC for the clinical model
(i.e., without biomarker) only, clinical model with biomarker each
at a time, and the clinical model with all biomarkers. We applied the
Delong test to test the significance of improvements in AUC. Finally,
we assessed improvement in predictive performance via net reclassi-
fication index and integrated discrimination improvement index by
comparing the clinical model with biomarkers (each at a time and all
together) and the clinical model. In NEPHRON-D with the full co-
hort available, we studied the association of biomarker quartiles with
eGFR decline rate using a linear mixed model; using the mixed model,
we calculated the annual rate of eGFR decline for each quartile of
biomarker.
P values for all end points are two-sided without adjustment of
multiple tests; P values of ,0.05 were considered to indicate statis-
tical significance.
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
In order to comprehensively review the existing literature and to con-
struct robust, pooled estimates of TNFRs associated risk for renal out-
comes across studies we designed a systematic review and meta-analysis
inaccordancewiththePreferredReportingItemsforSystematicReviews
and Meta-Analyses checklist. We performed a computerized search to
identify relevant published studies (January of 2000 to May of 2016).
MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and EMBASE databases
were searched using medical subject heading terms and keywords.
We included observational cohort studies evaluating TNFR-1 and/or
TNFR-2 as predictors of any renal outcome (ESRD, incident CKD 3b,
progressive eGFR loss, incident macroalbuminuria). Studies not evalu-
ating renal outcomes were excluded. Two reviewers (G.N.N., S.G.C.)
performed independent study selection in duplicate; GNN evaluated
and reviewed the selected studies independently and arbitrated dis-
agreements. The final decision regarding inclusion of each study was
made by consensus. Forest plots were created; however, we did not
provide pooled risk ratios because the units used for the exposure
were different in each study. All analyses were conducted using
STATA SE, Version 12, College Station, Texas.
