Abstract
These guidelines describe a comprehensive strategy to optimize oxygenation, airway management, and tracheal intu-
bation in critically ill patients, in all hospital locations. They are a direct response to the 4th National Audit Project of the
Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society, which highlighted deficient management of these extremely
vulnerable patients leading to major complications and avoidable deaths. They are founded on robust evidence where
available, supplemented by expert consensus opinion where it is not. These guidelines recognize that improved out-
comes of emergency airway management require closer attention to human factors, rather than simply introduction of
new devices or improved technical proficiency. They stress the role of the airway team, a shared mental model, planning,
and communication throughout airway management. The primacy of oxygenation including pre- and peroxygenation is
emphasized. A modified rapid sequence approach is recommended. Optimal management is presented in an algorithm
that combines Plans B and C, incorporating elements of the Vortex approach. To avoid delays and task fixation, the
importance of limiting procedural attempts, promptly recognizing failure, and transitioning to the next algorithm step

 are emphasized. The guidelines recommend early use of a videolaryngoscope, with a screen visible to all, and second
generation supraglottic airways for airway rescue. Recommendations for emergency front of neck airway are for a
scalpelebougieetube technique while acknowledging the value of other techniques performed by trained experts. As
most critical care airway catastrophes occur after intubation, from dislodged or blocked tubes, essential methods to
avoid these complications are also emphasized.

Airway management in anaesthesia has been transformed
since the publication of national guidelines for management
of the unanticipated difficult intubation,1e9 with the UK
guidance updated in 2015.9 However, the 4th National Audit
Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult
Airway Society (NAP4) highlighted a significantly higher rate of
adverse outcomes and important deficiencies of airway man-
agement in intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency de-
partments (EDs), compared with anaesthetic practice.10,11
The challenges of different patient populations (adult,
paediatric, obstetric, emergency, prehospital, and extubation)
have been addressed by specific guidelines.2,5,12e14 However,
even though critically ill patients may present in any area of
the hospital (ED, ICU, ward areas) posing unique challenges
(Table 1), and having the highest risk of complications, there is
little specific guidance for managing these patients, with only
one published national guideline.15
In the critically ill, patient factors may preclude standard
airway assessment. Urgency and reduced physiological reserve
contribute dramatically to increased risks of profound peri-
intubation hypoxaemia, hypotension, arrhythmia, cardiac ar-
rest, and death.16,17 Delays during tracheal intubation and
multiple
attempts
at
laryngoscopy
are
associated
with
increased complications, again including cardiac arrest and
death.11,18 Failure of ‘first pass success’ occurs in up to 30% of
ICU intubations, significantly higher than in the operating room
(OR).18e21 Severe hypoxaemia (SPO2 <80%) during ICU intuba-
tion is reported in up to 25% of patients.22 Further, approxi-
mately 4% of ICU patients are admitted for airway observation,
intubation, or extubation of a primary airway problem and,
overall, around 6% of ICU patients have a predicted difficult
airway.23 Critical illness and its management can make
anatomically ‘normal’ airways ‘physiologically difficult’. Fluid
resuscitation, capillary leak syndromes, prone ventilation, and
prolonged intubation all contribute to airway oedema and
distortion. Awake intubation is often inappropriate and awak-
ening the patient following failed airway management is usu-
ally impractical. Additional significant challenges include the
environment, experience of the operator or attending staff, and
other human factors (Table 1). When major airway events occur
in ICU, the incidence of death and brain damage is roughly 60-
fold higher than during operative anaesthesia.11
Despite the high-risk nature of intubation in ICU, most
airway incidents occur after the airway has been secured due
to airway displacement or blockage; in one series, 82% occurred
after intubation with 25% contributing to the patient’s death.24
Tracheostomy is used to manage 10e19% of level 3 ICU ad-
missions and carries particularly high risks.11,24e26
In the UK, the Difficult Airway Society (DAS), Intensive Care
Society (ICS), Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM), and
Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) recognized the need for
specific guidance to provide a structured approach to man-
agement of the airway in the critically ill adult. Airway man-
agement may be made difficult by anatomical or physiological
factors and these notably affect patients in ICU, ED, and on the
wards. This guideline applies to all these critically ill patients
irrespective of hospital location. In common with airway
guidelines in other settings, it prioritizes oxygenation whilst
endeavouring to limit the number of airway interventions, in
order to prevent complications.9 To address the specific chal-
lenges in the critically ill, this guideline discusses preparation
of the multidisciplinary team and environment, modified
airway
assessment,
preoxygenation and
oxygen delivery
during intubation (described as ‘peroxygenation’), haemody-
namic management, the role of rapid sequence induction,
optimal laryngoscopy including videolaryngoscopy, a unifica-
tion of Plans B and C, choice of emergency front of neck airway
(FONA), and several special circumstances. This guideline
does not address indications for intubation.
Methods
The DAS commissioned a working group in 2014 with repre-
sentation from DAS, ICS, FICM and RCoA. An initial literature
search was conducted from January 2000 to September 2014
using Medline, PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Google Scholar.
English language articles and abstract publications were iden-
tified using keywords and filters. Search terms are listed in
Supplementary material 1. Searches were repeated periodically
until May 2017, retrieving a total of 33 020 abstracts, reduced to
1652 full-text articles following screening by the working group.
Additional articles were retrieved by cross-referencing and
hand searching. Controlled studies are not possible in unan-
ticipated airway difficulty,10,11 especially in the critically ill. The
quality of evidence varied considerably (GRADE27 level 2þ to 5)
and in its absence, consensus was sought.
Where deviation from the DAS 2015 guidance was unnec-
essary, notably practical Front Of Neck Airway (FONA) tech-
niques for the ‘can’t intubate can’t oxygenate’ (CICO) situation
via the cricothyroid membrane, this is reproduced in this
guideline. Where additional external expertise or arbitration
was considered useful, (videolaryngoscopy, burns, and car-
diovascular collapse during intubation) this was sought and
consensus achieved. Opinions of the critical care community
and DAS membership were sought throughout the process
with presentations at various national professional meetings
between 2015 and 2017. A forum for comments and questions
was hosted on the DAS website. As with previous DAS guide-
lines, a draft was circulated to relevant professional organi-
zations, inviting UK and international experts to comment.
The working group reviewed all correspondence before final-
izing the guidelines.

 organizational and individual framework for preparation,
training, and to inform clinicalpractice. This document is
intended to guide appropriately trained operators.
Human factors
Human factors include environmental influences, team be-
haviours, and individual performance. Human factors are the
most prevalent cause of medical error and were prominent in
NAP4 ICU reports.11 Human factors deficits such as lack of
patient preparation, equipment checks, or protocol deviation
occur in up to half of ICU critical incidents.28,29 During ICU
airway management, factors relating to the patient, clinical
team
work,
environment,
and
the
need
for
immediate
decision-making contribute to potential difficulty.30 Latent
threats related to communication, training, equipment, sys-
tems, and processes are also common, contributing to poor
decision-making and loss of situation awareness.9 A NAP4
follow-up study identified human factors elements in all NAP4
cases, with a median 4.5 contributory human factors per case.
Loss of situation awareness (poor anticipation and suboptimal
decision making) was the most common.28
Environmental influences
The ICU is not designed primarily for airway management.
Monitors and equipment limit access to the patient. Airway
equipment should be chosen carefully. Complex equipment or
devices with multiple variations can cause cognitive overload
and impair decision-making.31 Options should be restricted,31
providing a primary device and, where necessary, a maximum
of one alternative. Local choices should reflect proven efficacy
but also consider the training and skillset of junior staff.10
Wherever practical, airway equipment should be standard-
ized across the organization.32 A standardized airway trolley
should be brought to the bedside for the procedure.
High reliability organizations accept the inevitability of
latent (environmental) and human errors, but opportunities
exist within healthcare systems to influence these. Cognitive
aids (checklists and algorithms) improve performance in
stressful situations33,34 and should be prominent wherever
airway interventions are performed. Robust incident reporting
and investigation should be embraced as an opportunity to
improve care. Open, no-blame discussions, including after
near-misses, involving all grades of staff, should form a
routine part of morbidity and mortality meetings.35
Team
The
composition
and
roles of the intubation
team are
described in Figure 1.
Team behaviour and individual performance
High-risk interventions require good teamwork including
leadership and ‘followership’. The leader is responsible for
introducing team members and their roles, and identifying
and clearly communicating key points in the process. For
example, explicitly verbalizing ‘failed intubation’ creates a
shared mental model.36
The team leader remaining ‘hands free’ lessens the risk of
task fixation and maintains situation awareness. Careful task
allocation avoids individual cognitive overload and clarifies
what is expected in both routine and challenging situations.
Deciding, prior to induction of anaesthesia, who will make the
second or third intubation attempt or perform FONA if it be-
comes necessary, could reduce delay in transitioning. We
recommend prebriefs and checklists to help decision-making,
evaluate options, limit interventions, and prompt calls for
help. They enable cognitive unloading, improve reliability, and
enable staff members to voice concerns.30
When help is summoned, communicate using structured
handover techniques such as SBAR (situation, background,
assessment, recommendation).36,37 Hierarchies can promote
task fixation and impair communication.38 The leader should
unambiguously state that all staff may ‘speak up’ and identify
potential problems. Well-briefed team members adopt ‘active
followership’: empowered to actively anticipate the next
steps, organise equipment, personnel, other resources, and
themselves.39
Training should include use of locally available equipment,
checklists (Fig. 2), algorithms (Figs 3 and 4), and teamwork. It
should be provided at staff orientation, with regular refreshers
for permanent staff.30,40 Team leaders should be trained for this
role. The importance of training with local equipment before use
cannot be overemphasised.41,42 Airway simulation performed in
the ICU, involving all grades of staff, improves skill retention and
may also identify latent errors and poor processes.43
Handovers should routinely share information about the
airway, highlighting airway difficulties and ensuring individ-
ualized management plans are in place.11,23
Managing cognitive overload and the Vortex approach
Cognitive overload is a particular problem during airway cri-
ses, which impairs decision-making and performance.34
The ‘Vortex approach’ to airway crisis management em-
ploys
a
simple
graphic
designed
to
be
easily
recalled
and referred to by stressed clinicians during the process of
difficult
airway
management
(http://vortexapproach.org/:
Supplementary Fig. 1). It emphasizes the importance of avoid-
ing repeated attempts with the same technique when diffi-
culties arise.44 The Vortex approach permits a maximum of
three attempts each of oxygenation via a supraglottic airway
(SGA), facemask ventilation, or tracheal intubation, with the
option of a fourth attempt with each device by an expert. Failure
of all attempts or clinical deterioration mandates transition to
FONA. The Vortex approach has considerable intuitive appeal
albeit with a limited evidence base, and elements of it are
incorporated into these guidelines.
The call for help and the role of the airway expert
The airway should be managed by an appropriately trained
operator. This does not have to be the most senior team
member, as this individual may adopt the team leader role.
The trigger for summoning additional airway expertise and
how to do so should be outlined at the team brief. We
recommend the call for help is made at the earliest opportu-
nity, and explicitly after one failed intubation attempt.
Expertise may be procedure-specific rather than reflecting
seniority (e.g. head and neck surgeon). The expert should
receive a focused handover on arrival to understand potential
next steps and priorities, and should avoid ‘analysis paralysis’
(an over-detailed exploration of possible options which delays
definitive action).31 The SNAPPI (Stop, Notify, Appraise, Plan,
Prioritise, Invite comments) communication tool may be

 useful.45 The expert may adopt the team leader role, or un-
dertake expert interventions.
If junior but more airway-experienced personnel arrive
they should communicate their status using Crew Resource
Management-style
‘assertiveness
with
respect’.38,40,46e49
Expert interventions may include.

� One further attempt at SGA insertion

Assessment
Airway assessment should include risks of difficult intubation,
of difficulty with rescue techniques and of aspiration. While
assessments to identify difficult intubation have a low positive
predictive value and specificity,50,51 recognition of patients at
particular risk of difficult airway management aids planning
and is recommended, even in the most urgent situations.52,53
Cases reported to NAP4 from ICU and ED frequently included
failure to assess the airway. More importantly, identification
of the high-risk patient was not followed by an appropriate
airway strategy.11 The only validated airway assessment tool
in the critically ill is the MACOCHA score.54e56 There are seven
components in three domains (Table 2).
Full airway assessment in the most critically ill is often
impractical but even in hypoxic patients removing a facemask
for a few seconds can enable a basic airway assessment. Nasal
oxygenation can be used to facilitate assessment and subse-
quently for pre- and peroxygenation. A MACOCHA score �3
predicts difficult intubation in the critically ill. The degree of
cardiorespiratory disturbance should be noted as haemody-
namic optimization prior to induction improves outcome.57
Assessment is particularly difficult in obtunded or unco-
operative patients but patient records, body habitus, sub-
mental airway dimensions, and handover details are useful;
Mallampati class is valid in supine patients with voluntary
mouth opening.54,58
The ‘laryngeal handshake’ (Supplementary Fig. 2) technique
is recommended to identify the cricothyroid membrane.9 Ul-
trasonography is more accurate than palpation, identifying
cricothyroid membrane size, depth, deviation, overlying blood
Fig 1. The composition and roles of the intubation team. During an intubation procedure, the discrete functional roles can be described as:
(1) first intubator; (2) drug administrator (drugs); (3) observer of patient’s clinical state and monitors (monitor); (4) cricoid force applier
(cricoid); (5) airway equipment assistant (equipment); (6) runner to fetch additional equipment or call for help; (7) second intubator; (8)
team leaderecoordinator (leader); and (9) manual in-line stabiliser (MILS). A single team member may perform more than one role. The
detailed division of labour will depend on how many staff can be assembled. This may vary from a minimum of four staff up to six staff
members. The figure describes the division of labour for teams consisting of (A) six, (B) five, and (C) four members. For each size of team,
the roles change after the first failed intubation attempt, when the second intubator becomes active. If the team consists only a single
intubator, the second intubator role is not included and the roles remain unchanged between intubation attempts until airway-expert help
arrives, if at all. The Team Leader coordinates the team with the senior intubator. (MILS is a trauma-specific role, which must be added to
any intubation team’s complement).

 vessels, or thyroid tissue, and may be useful if time permits.59e61
Patient positioning for FONA will be likely to move any skin
markings relative to the cricothyroid membrane and identifi-
cation and simply marking only the trachea or midline may be
more appropriate.60,62 When laryngeal pathology is suspected
(e.g. supraglottitis or laryngeal tumour), nasendoscopy is
uniquely useful in planning management.63
Plan A: preparation, oxygenation, induction,
mask ventilation, and intubation
Team assembly and preintubation brief
A preintubation checklist should be undertaken (Fig. 2).11 The
team leader should ensure that clear roles have been assigned,
the strategy (for Plans A, B/C, and D) is shared and invite
comments, including whether further expertise is needed.
Prepare equipment and drugs and prominently display the
algorithm (Fig. 3). Agree whether awakening the patient is
planned in the event of failure to intubate. Preoxygenation
techniques can occur concurrently.
Positioning for initial airway management
When tolerated, sit or tilt the patient’s head up 25e30�64e66
and position the head and neck: the lower cervical spine is
flexed and the upper cervical spine extendedd‘flextension, or
so-called sniffing position’.67e69 Tilting the whole bed head-up
is useful for patients with suspected cervical spine injury.69,70
Ramping (external auditory meatus level with sternal notch) is
useful in obese patients and the head should be extended on
the neck such that the face is horizontal.65,68,71,72 Optimal
positioning improves upper airway patency and access, in-
creases
functional
residual
capacity,
and
may
reduce
aspiration risk.69,73 Ensure the bed mattress is as firm as
possible to optimize cricoid force (cricoid pressure), head
extension and access to the cricothyroid membrane.
Monitoring
Standard monitoring should include oximetry, waveform
capnography, blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, and, where
available, end-tidal oxygen concentration.74
Preoxygenation and peroxygenation
Preoxygenation
Critically ill patients are uniquely liable and vulnerable to
hypoxaemia, but ‘standard’ methods of preoxygenation are
only
partially
effective.75
In
the
absence
of
respiratory
failure, preoxygenate using a tight-fitting facemask, with
10e15 litres min�1 100% oxygen for 3 min.76e78 We do not
recommend preoxygenation with a ‘Hudson-type’ facemask,
with or without a reservoir. Use of a circuit with an adjustable
valve enables continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to be
applied but its precise level cannot be controlled.79 Significant
leak is indicated by absence or attenuation of a capnograph
trace,76 minimized using a two-handed technique and an
appropriately sized facemask.80 Adequate preoxygenation is
preferably measured using end-tidal oxygen concentration
(>85%).81,82
In hypoxaemic patients, CPAP and non-invasive ventilation
(NIV) may be beneficial.83e88 Improved oxygenation has been
demonstrated using NIV with CPAP (5e10 cm H2O) and sup-
ported breaths (tidal volume of 7e10 ml kg�1).89 CPAP reduces
absorption atelectasis associated with breathing 100% oxy-
gen.90 Gastric distension may occur when airway pressure
exceeds 20 cm H2O.91,92 In patients with an incompletely

 healed tracheostomy stoma, this must be occluded to benefit
from CPAP.
Nasal oxygen can be used during both pre- and peroxyge-
nation. Standard nasal cannulae enable a good mask seal and
can be applied during preoxygenation.93 High-flow nasal
oxygenation (HFNO) at flows between 30e70 litres min�1 is an
alternative, although contraindications include severe facial
trauma or suspected skull base fractures.94 HFNO prolongs safe
apnoea time in anaesthetic settings and has been studied for
preoxygenation in the critically ill.95 Recently, the combination
of HFNO and NIV was reported to reduce desaturation in a pilot
study.95 Current evidence shows no harm but no outcome
benefits from use of HFNO and, whilst attractive, limitations of
available studies make the evidence inconclusive.96e104 The
potential benefit of improved oxygenation after induction of
anaesthesia must be balanced against the HFNO circuit inter-
fering with the facemask seal and ventilation, reducing CPAP
efficacy before and after induction.105
Pre-induction oxygenation can be difficult in agitated pa-
tients; delayed sequence induction in which small doses of a
sedative such as ketamine are administered to enable effective
preoxygenation before induction may be a practical solution.93
Patients already receiving NIV, CPAP, or HFNO should un-
dergo tracheal intubation promptly when it becomes apparent
that these modalities are failing; delay is likely to lead to
profound hypoxaemia during intubation.
We recommend preoxygenation via a tight-fitting facemask
and circuit capable of delivering CPAP (e.g. Waters circuit). We
recommend nasal oxygen is applied throughout airway man-
agement. If standard nasal cannulae are used these should be
applied during preoxygenation with a flow of 5 litres min�1
while awake, increased to 15 litres min�1 when the patient
loses consciousness. We recommend using 5e10 cm H2O CPAP
if oxygenation is impaired. HFNO may be logical if already in
use or may be chosen instead of standard nasal cannulae, or
existing NIV instead of CPAP, caveats notwithstanding.9,89,95
Oxygenation during intubation: peroxygenation
With the onset of apnoea and neuromuscular blockade, alve-
olar de-recruitment occurs and, if untreated, will lead to
hypoxaemia. Oxygen delivery via standard nasal or buccal
cannulae at 15 litres min�1 produces high hypopharyngeal
concentrations of oxygen during apnoea93,106 and is still
partially effective at intrapulmonary shunt levels of up to
35%.107 We recommend nasal oxygen at 15 litres min�1, or
HFNO, during intubation attempts.70,95,102,106,108,109
Facemask ventilation with CPAP may improve oxygenation,
extend the safe apnoea time, and indicate the ease of facemask
ventilation.9 Cricoid force should be reduced or removed if
facemask ventilation proves difficult.9 A ‘two-person’ tech-
nique (in which the mask is held using two hands and a second
operator compresses the bag), oral airway adjuncts, or both
may improve facemask ventilation. High respiratory rates and
volumes are rarely necessary and may cause hypotension or
‘breath-stacking’ in cases of expiratory airflow limitation.110
Inexpert cricoid force may obstruct the laryngeal inlet (or up-
per airway) and render nasal oxygen ineffective. Concomitant
use of HFNO during facemask ventilation with a tight-fitting
facemask can result in high airway pressures and care is
required. If facemask ventilation between intubation attempts
is unsuccessful, rescue oxygenation using a second-generation
SGA may be required; this is Plan B/C (see below).
We recommend facemask ventilation with CPAP before
attempting intubation, and between intubation attempts
where hypoxia occurs or is likely to occur (e.g. respiratory
failure, obesity).103 We also recommend facemask ventilation
with CPAP before attempting intubation if hypercarbia is
problematic (metabolic acidosis, raised intracranial pressure,
pulmonary hypertension).111
Induction of anaesthesia
Many critically ill patients are at risk of aspirating gastric con-
tents and a ‘modified’ rapid sequence induction (RSI) approach
is emphasized in this guideline.112e114 We recommend preox-
ygenation, optimal positioning, intravenous induction and a
rapid-onset
neuromuscular
blocking
agent
(NMBA),
pre-
cautions against pulmonary aspiration, peroxygenation, face-
mask ventilation with CPAP, laryngoscopic techniques aimed at
maximizing first-pass success, and confirmation of successful
tracheal intubation by waveform capnography.
The risk of pulmonary aspiration may be reduced by dis-
continuing enteral feeding, removing the gastric contents by
suction, and, whilst still debated, by cricoid force application by
a trained assistant.115e117 A videolaryngoscope screen visible to
the team enables real-time cricoid force optimization. Correct
application of cricoid force is a skill requiring training and
practice, and we recommend a standard method of applying
cricoid force using 1 kg (10 N) awake increasing to 3 kg (30 N)
after loss of consciousness.116e118 An existing gastric tube does
not compromise the protection offered by cricoid force and
should be left in place. Gastric insufflation during mask venti-
lation is reduced by application of cricoid force.115 Cricoid force
should be reduced or removed if there is difficulty with laryn-
goscopy, passage of the tracheal tube, facemask ventilation or
active
vomiting.115,119
Successful
SGA
insertion
requires
removal of cricoid force.
Induction drug choices
The choice of induction drug is dictated by haemodynamic
considerations; ketamine is increasingly favoured in most
circumstances.57 Coinduction with rapidly-acting opioids en-
ables lower doses of hypnotics to be used, promoting cardio-
vascular
stability
and
minimizing
intracranial
pressure
changes. We recommend the use of a NMBA, as this reduces

complications
in
the

ill.120
NMBAs
improve intubating conditions, facemask ventilation, SGA
insertion, abolish upper airway muscle tone including lar-
yngospasm, optimize chest wall compliance, reduce the
number of intubation attempts, and reduce complications.
Avoiding NMBAs is associated with increased difficulty.121e124
Succinylcholine has numerous side-effects including life-
threatening hyperkalaemia and its short duration of action
can hamper intubation if difficulty prolongs the attempt.
Rocuronium may be a more rational choice in the critically ill,
providing
similar
intubating
conditions
to
succinylcho-
line.113,122,124 Rocuronium can be antagonized using a pre-
calculated dose of sugammadex, but this does not guarantee
resolution of an obstructed airway.125e128
Time
As induction commences, note the time (allocate a team
member). During airway crises, significant time may pass
unnoticed, which may mean progress through the algorithm
does not assume the urgency required.129
Laryngoscopy
Difficult
laryngoscopy
occurs
frequently
in
critically
ill
patients.18e20 Difficult laryngeal view is associated with multi-
ple intubation attempts and failure; it is associated with severe
hypoxia, hypotension, oesophageal intubation and cardiac ar-
rest.17,18,130 The goal is to achieve timely, atraumatic tracheal
intubation using the minimum number of attempts. Repeated
attempts to pass a tracheal tube are associated with trauma,
airway deterioration, and progression to a CICO situation.
The patient should be:
� positioned optimally;
� preoxygenated;
� anaesthetized;
� neuromuscularly relaxed.
The operator should:
� have a primary plan and a plan for failure;
� be trained and proficient in all the techniques they intend to
use;
� be supported by a trained, briefed team.
A blade entering the oral cavity constitutes one attempt at
laryngoscopy. If one laryngoscopy attempt fails, ensure the
FONA set is immediately to hand (‘get FONA set’, Fig. 3) and
senior help is summoned. The number of attempts is limited
to three. Following a failed intubation attempt, we recommend
manoeuvres to improve the laryngoscopic view or ease of
intubation in a correctly positioned and adequately paralysed
patient. Manoeuvres include: different device or blade, partial
withdrawal of the blade to facilitate a wider field of view,
different operator, suction and reduction or release of cricoid
force. Optimal external laryngeal manipulation or backwards
upwards rightward pressure may improve the view, and are
aided by videolaryngoscopy with a screen visible to all. Use of a
bougie or stylet is recommended when the laryngeal opening
is poorly seen (Grade 2b or 3a views) or when using a hyper-
angulated
videolaryngoscope.131
Blind
efforts
to
pass
a
tracheal tube in Grade 3b and 4 views are potentially traumatic
and should be avoided.131
If all relevant factors have already been addressed and an
optimal intubation attempt fails, making no further attempts
may be indicated (i.e. all three permitted attempts are not
mandated). Failure after a maximum of three attempts should
prompt the declaration, “This is a failed intubation.” Move to
Plan B/C. A fourth attempt may be considered by a suitable
expert.
Videolaryngoscopy in the critically ill
Published data on videolaryngoscopy in critically ill patients
are generally of poor quality, with limited evidence from ICU
and ED populations120,132e141 and results from these two lo-
cations might not necessarily be transferrable. Evidence from
anaesthesia practice is relevant and generally of higher qual-
ity, but there are again issues of transferability. A recent sys-
tematic review of videolaryngoscopy, in all settings, reported
improved laryngeal view with videolaryngoscopy, improved
ease of use, reduced airway trauma and reduced failures, both
in an unselected population and in predicted difficult intuba-
tion.142 Evidence highlights the importance of training in
success with videolaryngoscopy,142,143 an important omission
in many studies in the critically ill. The systematic review also
identified that not all videolaryngoscopes perform equally.142
There is uncertainty over the impact of videolaryngoscopy
on intubation speed,142 but it is likely that hyperangulated (as
opposed
to
MacIntosh-shaped)
blades
prolong
easy
in-
tubations. Synthesizing the available evidence, and given the
importance of avoiding multiple attempts and reducing failed
intubations in the critically ill, we make the following recom-
mendations for videolaryngoscopy.
A videolaryngoscope should be available and considered as
an option for all intubations of critically ill patients. Those
involved in critical care intubation should be appropriately
trained in use of the videolaryngoscope(s) they may be called
upon to use. If difficult laryngoscopy is predicted in a critically
ill patient (MACOCHA score �3)54 videolaryngoscopy should be
actively considered from the outset. If during direct laryn-
goscopy there is a poor view of the larynx, subsequent at-
tempts
at
laryngoscopy
should
be
performed
with
a
videolaryngoscope.
Individuals and departments may decide to use video-
laryngoscopy as first choice for all intubations in the critically
ill. Departmental device selection is multifactorial but we
recommend a device with a screen, visible to all members
during intubation, to improve assistance, cricoid force opti-
mization, training, supervision, and teamwork.144 These rec-
ommendations apply both to ICUs and EDs but may be difficult
in remote parts of hospitals. Where videolaryngoscopy is used
as first choice, it is logical to use a device that enables use both
as a direct laryngoscope and as a videolaryngoscope (i.e.
Macintosh-type blade). Where videolaryngoscopy is used as a
rescue
device
(whether
direct
laryngoscopy
or
video-
laryngoscopy was used initially) it is likely that a hyper-
angulated device (used with a stylet or bougie) will perform
best.145 Blood, secretions, and vomitus in the airway can
hamper videolaryngoscopy in the critically ill patient.
Further high-quality research in this area is required and
these recommendations may assist in defining the standards
necessary for such studies.
Confirmation of intubation
It is mandatory to use waveform capnography to confirm
intubation.146,147 Absence of a recognizable waveform trace
indicates failed intubation unless proven otherwise.11 During
Guidelines for the management of tracheal intubation
-

 cardiac arrest, effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation leads
to an attenuated, but recognizable capnograph trace.11 Rarely,
an absent capnograph waveform may be caused by tube
obstruction (e.g. severe pulmonary oedema, severe broncho-
spasm, or blood), secretions, or water in the capnograph cir-
cuitdbut
tube
misplacement
should
always
be
initially
assumed and actively excluded. Bronchoscopy via the tracheal
tube can also confirm tracheal placement. Auscultation and
observation of chest wall movement are unreliable signs,
particularly in the critically ill.148,149
Post-intubation recruitment manoeuvres
Anaesthesia and intubation attempts worsen pulmonary me-
chanics and gas exchange in the critically ill.150,151 Provided
haemodynamic stability is maintained, recruitment manoeu-
vres are potentially beneficial in hypoxic patients following
intubation. An inspiratory pressure 30e40 cm H2O for 25e30 s
can increase lung volume and oxygenation and decrease atel-
ectasis without adverse effects.152,153
Plan B/C: rescue oxygenation using SGA or
facemask after failed intubation
Failed intubation occurs in 10e30% in critically ill patients and
should be anticipated.17e21 Failed intubation is likely to result
in
severe
hypoxaemia
(SpO2
<80%)22,154e156
and
while
restoring oxygenation remains the priority, this may be diffi-
cult.70,157,158 Reoxygenation is attempted using a second-
generation SGA or facemask.159 Successful reoxygenation of-
fers the opportunity to ‘stop and think’.
Previous guidelines have defined Plan B as airway rescue
using an SGA and Plan C as a final attempt to achieve
oxygenation with facemask ventilation.9 However, whilst this
B-to-C sequence is useful conceptually, it is an artificial
distinction in clinical practice. Following failed intubation at-
tempts, experienced operators enter a phase of airway rescue,
attempting
SGA
placement
interspersed
with
attempted
facemask ventilation. This is recognised by the ‘Vortex
approach’, which we commend.44 Briefly, the Vortex approach
defines a ‘green zone’ as a place of effective oxygenation and
relative safety and the Vortex as the converse. While in the
Vortex, attempts at intubation, SGA placement, and facemask
ventilation form an alternating continuum, culminating in
success (movement into the green zone) or in cumulative
failure (spiralling further into the Vortex), necessitating tran-
sition to FONA. In practice, in the critically ill, the attempts at
intubation will usually occur before attempts at SGA insertion
and rescue facemask ventilation. One optimal attempt, or a
maximum of three attempts each with SGA or facemask are
recommended in Plan B/C before declaring failure.
An expert may arrive during rescue oxygenation attempts.
The Vortex approach permits one further expert attempt at
intubation, one further expert attempt at SGA oxygenation
and one further attempt at facemask ventilation if appro-
priate. It may be clear to the expert that rapid transition to
FONA is necessary.
The principles of the Vortex approach are adapted in the
algorithm. Successful ventilation is evidenced by an appro-
priate capnograph trace and stable or improving oxygenation.
Recourse to rescue SGA oxygenation mandates that the team
prepare for FONA (Fig. 3).
Rescue oxygenation using an SGA
During airway rescue, SGA insertion is initially preferable to
attempted facemask ventilation because SGAs may frequently
enable oxygenation, provide some protection from aspiration
and facilitate ‘fibreoptic’ (referring to all types of airway en-
doscopes) intubation using the device as a conduit.154,155 There
are reports of successful SGA rescue in ICU patients with
difficult intubation, high airway pressures, and high aspiration
risk.160
Second-generation SGAs should be immediately available
in all locations where intubation of critically ill patients is
attempted. A second-generation SGA is one with design fea-
tures specifically intended to reduce the risk of aspiration such
as higher oropharyngeal seal pressures and oesophageal drain
tubes [e.g. i-gel™, ProSeal™ Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA)].159
Training with specific devices improves success and should be
undertaken with the same emphasis as tracheal intuba-
tion.161,162 It is important to continue peroxygenation efforts
with nasal oxygen, facemask ventilation, or both between SGA
insertion attempts.
Optimizing SGA insertion
Cricoid force occludes the hypopharynx and prevents cor-
rect SGA placement.163e165 We recommend cricoid force is
removed before SGA insertion.115 Success is most likely with
the patient correctly positioned, using an optimal insertion
technique,
performed
by
an
individual
trained
in
the
technique.9,166e168 After intubation fails, a maximum of
three SGA insertion attempts should be made with changes
to
SGA
size,
type,
insertion
technique
or
operator
as
necessary.167,169e174
Critically ill patients may have a gastric tube in situ. These
do not require removal to facilitate SGA insertion.175,176
Second-generation SGAs can vent regurgitated material via
the drain tube, offering a degree of airway protection and
facilitating insertion of a gastric tube.
Choice of SGA
The attributes of an ideal SGA for ICU airway rescue are:
reliable first-time placement (including by non-airway ex-
perts), high oropharyngeal seal pressure, ability to ventilate
(with PEEP, Positive End Expiratory Pressure), separation of
gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and compatibility with
fibreoptic
intubation
techniques.177
Oropharyngeal
seal
pressures of first-generation SGAs are unlikely to provide
adequate ventilation of poorly compliant lungs and are more
likely to lead to gastric inflation. Some second-generation
SGAs have most of the desirable properties and although
devices vary in performance,177 only second-generation SGAs
are recommended in this guideline.178
Second-generation SGAs are more likely to enable reox-
ygenation, ventilation, and maintenance of PEEP. The PLMA
(Teleflex Medical Europe Ltd, Athlone, Ireland) has the most
effective seal pressure of currently available devices, followed
by the LMA® Supreme™ (SLMA; Teleflex) and i-gel™ (Inter-
surgical, Wokingham, UK). Where a PLMA is used, insertion
over a bougie may improve placement success.179,180 The
narrow airway channel of the SLMA precludes its easy use as a
conduit for fibreoptic intubation.181

 ‘Stop, think, communicate’ after successful rescue
oxygenation with an SGA
Successful ventilation is evidenced by an appropriate capno-
graph trace and stable or improving oxygenation. Whilst crit-
ical illness may impair reoxygenation with even correctly
placed devices, success provides an opportunity to stop, think
and communicate. Call for help, if not already summoned. The
optimal course of action depends on the clinical situation and
the team’s skill-set. The priority remains oxygenation, while
minimizing the risk of losing the airway, aspiration, and
airway trauma.
Options are:
� wake the patient;
� wait for an expert to arrive;
� a single attempt at fibreoptic intubation via the SGA;
� proceed to FONA.
Wake the patient
This is rarely applicable in critically ill patients, especially with
neurological, cardiovascular or respiratory failure. Whether
this is appropriate should have been decided before induction.
Such patients rarely awaken adequately. Failed intubation
attempts cause airway trauma and respiratory deterioration
and may compromise attempts to awaken the patient.
Neurological impairment, residual drug effects,182,183 (iat-
rogenic) airway trauma, oedema, or pre-existing upper airway
pathology may all contribute to airway obstruction during
attempted emergence.9,128,184 If wake up is attempted, neuro-
muscular blockade must be fully reversed and adequate
neuromuscular function confirmed. Sugammadex reverses
rocuronium (and vecuronium), but is not universally available
and its significant preparation time impairs its utility.125e128
Simply reversing the effects of opioids, benzodiazepines, or
NMBAs does not reverse mechanical or physiological causes of
airway obstruction, does not reliably prevent, and may pre-
cipitate CICO.126,128,184
Wait for an expert to arrive
If oxygenation can be safely maintained via an SGA and a more
skilled operator is able to attend promptly, it may be reason-
able to await their (prompt) attendance to determine which of
the above options (or one further expert attempt at laryngos-
copy) is most suitable. During this time, the patient and their
airway should be monitored meticulously to detect evidence
of deterioration. Awaiting an expert should not delay actions
necessary to establish or maintain oxygenation.
Intubation via the SGA
Whilst blind insertion of a tracheal tube via an SGA is unreli-
able and is not recommended, a correctly placed SGA may
facilitate fibreoptic-guided intubation.171,185e187 The ICS, DAS,
National Tracheostomy Safety Project, NAP4, and National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend imme-
diate availability of fibreoptic endoscopes in ICU.9,10,188e190
Fibreoptic-guided intubation via an SGA may be achieved
with a small tracheal tube preloaded over the endoscope, with
both introduced via the SGA.191e198 This technique is suitable
for some but not all SGAs and significantly limits the size of
tracheal tube that can be inserted (typically 6.0 mm inner
diameter). Alternatively, an Aintree Intubation Catheter™
(AIC; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) may be fibreopti-
cally inserted via the SGA before railroading a larger (�7.0 mm)
tracheal tube over this conduit. Bullet-tipped (e.g. intubating
LMA
tracheal
tube,
Teleflex)
tracheal
tubes
are
ide-
al.181,195,199e205 This technique works well via the i-gel and
PLMA,206 but the narrow, rigid, curved airway channel of the
SLMA is poorly suited.9,181,202
Oxygenation
and
ventilation
should
be
maintained
throughout fibreoptic-guided intubation. To avoid the risk of
barotrauma, oxygenation via the SGA is safer than via the
AIC.207,208 Limiting the number of airway interventions is a
core principle of safe airway management; we recommend a
single attempt at fibreoptic-guided intubation through an
SGA.9 Training is essential.
Proceed to FONA
Do not wait for life-threatening hypoxaemia before tran-
sitioning to FONA.209 After failed intubation, critically ill pa-
tients are more likely to require a definitive airway than in the
OR. Following successful SGA insertion and ventilation, it is
often appropriate to proceed directly to FONA. Indications
include marginal oxygenation, aspiration, difficult ventilation,
or when fibreoptically guided intubation via the SGA is not
possible. Oxygenation via an SGA has been reported as a
successful bridge to FONA in cases of failed ICU airway
management.210e215
Facemask ventilation
Oxygenation using facemask ventilation is an alternative to
SGA use when intubation has failed and is vital between at-
tempts at airway instrumentation.216 CPAP during facemask
ventilation is advantageous in the critically ill.217 Techniques
to optimize success include: optimal head, mandible, and body
position to improve upper airway patency, oral or nasal airway
adjuncts, and a ‘two-person’ technique.218 Neuromuscular
blockade improves facemask ventilation, especially in the
context of laryngeal spasm, chest wall rigidity or obesity.219,220
Difficult ventilation via SGA and facemask are more com-
mon after failed intubation,154,221 increasing the likelihood of
progression to CICO. Recourse to rescue facemask ventilation
mandates that the team prepare for FONA (‘open FONA set’,
Fig. 3).
Successful facemask ventilation
Successful facemask ventilation is evidenced by waveform
capnography and stable or improving oxygenation. If facemask
ventilation is achieved, the same options as for successful SGA
insertion should be considered (wake patient, wait for expert,
FONA). Clinical deterioration
and worsening oxygenation
should prompt immediate transition to FONA if an SGA has also
failed. After failed intubation is declared, a maximum of three
facemask ventilation attempts are permitted, with changes to
size, type, adjuncts, position, and operator as required. If face-
mask ventilation is difficult, SGA has failed and waking the
patient is not immediately planned, adequate neuromuscular
blockade should be ensured while proceeding to FONA.
Unsuccessful ventilation via SGA and facemask
Recognition of failed ventilation via an SGA or facemask may
be difficult and there is a risk of task fixation. Clinical signs are

 unreliable, especially differentiation between pulmonary and
gastric inflation. In the absence of cardiac arrest, the presence
of an end tidal capnograph trace is the definitive monitor
indicating success or failure of alveolar ventilation.
To ensure rapid transition to FONA, we recommend open-
ing the FONA set following the first failed attempt at SGA
ventilation or the first failed attempt at facemask ventilation.
With progressive failures of SGA and facemask ventilation it
should be feasible to transition to FONA within 60 s. Recog-
nition of failed or failing ventilation or worsening oxygenation
should prompt a declaration of failure from the team (‘This is a
can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate situation’) and urgent transi-
tion to FONA (stating ‘We need to perform an emergency front
of neck airway’).
The arrival of the expert during plan B/C
See the ‘Human factors’ section (heading ‘The call for help and
the role of the airway expert’).
Plan D: emergency FONA
Transition to FONA
Emergency FONA is indicated following failed intubation, when
rescue oxygenation via SGA and facemask ventilation have
also failed. Unless this CICO situation is rapidly resolved pro-
found hypoxaemia and cardiac arrest are inevitable. Hence,
failure to ventilate the apnoeic critically ill patient should
prompt transition to FONA.44 There is no specific threshold
oxygen saturation for transition, and establishing an emer-
gency airway before profound hypoxaemia occurs is desirable.6
Delayed transition to FONA because of procedural reluc-
tance is common in airway crises and is a greater cause of
morbidity than complications of the procedure.10,40,209,222e224
An explicit declaration of failure facilitates practical and psy-
chological ‘priming’ for FONA.44 Oxygenation attempts should
be continued by nasal oxygen, SGA, or facemask during the
transition and whilst performing FONA.1,6,9,10,210
Ensure adequate neuromuscular blockade: this increases
success of FONA (and other airway rescue techniques).9,10 If
sugammadex has been administered earlier, a second NMBA
other than rocuronium or vecuronium is indicated.
Important CICO considerations
Whilst transition to FONA should not be delayed, there are
potentially remediable factors to consider during transition to
CICO:
Equipment
� Oxygen failure
� Blocked breathing system (including heat and moisture
exchanger filter)
� Blocked airway device
� Poor mask seal
Airway
� Excessive cricoid force
� Laryngeal spasm
� Foreign body
� Regurgitated material
� Blood
� Severe bronchospasm
Other
� Profound cardiovascular collapse/cardiac arrest
Priming for FONA
Transition to FONA has traditionally been poorly understood
and unplanned. This contributes to the widely recognized
problem of delayed progression to FONA, resulting in avoid-
able harm.10,11 ‘Priming for FONA’ refers to formalizing this
transition using defined triggers prior to and at the declaration
of CICO. The three steps are: (i) ‘getting the FONA set’ to the
bedside (or ensuring it is there) after one failed intubation
attempt; (ii) ‘opening the FONA set’ after one failed attempt at
facemask or SGA oxygenation; and (iii) immediately using the
FONA set at CICO declaration. A staged, didactic approach
facilitates psychological and operational preparation to act
and

Performing FONA
The optimal FONA technique is via the cricothyroid mem-
brane.225
Current
evidence
supports
an
open
‘surgical’
approach (scalpel cricothyroidotomy). This is a fast and reli-
able technique, has few steps, a high success rate, uses
familiar standard equipment, is suitable for almost all pa-
tients, enables confirmation of success by waveform capnog-
raphy, provides a definitive airway offering a degree of
protection against aspiration, facilitates exhalation, and en-
ables application of PEEP.10,222,226e228
We recommend a scalpel-bougie-tube cricothyroidotomy
technique (Fig. 4) in common with the DAS 2015 guidelines and
readers are referred there and to the associated DAS e-learning
cricothyroidotomy module (http://das.uk.com) for details.9,229
Key steps include maximum neck extension, a horizontal inci-
sion with a wide scalpel blade (size 10 or 20) for those with a
palpable cricothyroid membrane, or an initial large vertical
midline skin incision if the cricothyroid membrane is impal-
pable, and insertion of a bougie as a guide for a 5.0e6.0 mm
tracheal tube.9 A 5.0 mm Melker™ (Cook Medical) cricothyr-
oidotomy tube may be appropriate in this setting.230 Ensure the
smaller tracheal tube size fits over the type of bougie used in
your unit.
High pressure source transtracheal ventilation via a narrow
bore cannuladcolloquially termed ‘transtracheal jet ventila-
tion’ (TTJV)dis increasingly recognized as a high-risk rescue
technique with both device insertion and subsequent ventila-
tion prone to failure and complications. Closed claims analysis
in the USA demonstrate extremely poor outcomes with TTJV.223
NAP4 identified high rates of device and technique failure with
TTJV.10 In a systematic review, emergency TTJV in CICO was
associated with a high risk of failure (42%), barotrauma (32%),
and complications (51%).231 Subcutaneous emphysema hinders
later open approaches.231 TTJV is especially poorly suited to
management of CICO in the critically ill because re-recruitment
and reoxygenation of poorly compliant lungs requires PEEP and
is difficult without a cuffed tube. The ventilatory requirements
of the critically ill are also less likely to be met by TTJV. There is a
lack of evidence to support or refute use of controlled oxygen
insufflation (e.g. RapidO2™; Meditech Systems Ltd, Shaftsbury,
336
-
Higgs et al.
 UK) in this setting. Narrow-bore cannulae are non-definitive
airways and require urgent conversion to more reliable de-
vices.10,11,222 Whilst numerous Seldinger cricothyroidotomy
techniques and devices are described, there is insufficient evi-
dence to recommend this technique for FONA. Similarly,
percutaneous and surgical tracheostomy has been described for
airway rescue, but is likely to take longer than a scalpel
cricothyroidotomy.225,232e234 Trained and experienced opera-
tors have successfully used alternative FONA techniques in the
critically ill, but for the above reasons, we recommend scalpel
cricothyroidotomy as the default technique for CICO situations
(Fig. 4).
If
a
patient’s
tracheostomy
has
been
very
recently
removed, it may be possible to re-cannulate the stoma, but
this should not delay FONA.
Failed FONA
This is a desperate situation. Cardiac arrest is usual. If scalpel
cricothyroidotomy via the cricothyroid membrane fails, FONA
can be attempted lower in the trachea. An experienced operator
may attempt a percutaneous or surgical tracheostomy or non-
scalpel FONA.225,235,236 Arrival of an expert at this point may
lead to single attempts at techniques described above (Fig. 3).
Management following FONA
Waveform capnography should be used to confirm tracheal
placement. Clinical examination may identify inadvertent
endobronchial placement, but is insensitive. Fibreoptic in-
spection or chest X-ray is required. Once stabilized, the airway
will need conversion to tracheal tube or tracheostomy.11,237
Pharyngeal or oesophageal injury may have occurred, with
potential for mediastinal infection and may require further
investigation.223
Peri-intubation haemodynamic
management
Even successful ICU intubation has a high risk of significant
haemodynamic instability (up to 25%).17,22,57,238e240 Cardiac ar-
rest has been reported in approximately 2% of ICU intubations,
increasing with repeated intubation attempts. In one study,
cardiac arrest occurred in one in eight emergency intubations
outside the OR when four or more intubation attempts were
required.130 Causes include hypoxaemia, underlying critical
illness, vasodilation from anaesthetic agents, hypovolaemia,
and positive pressure ventilation reducing venous return. Risks
can be reduced by addressing underlying causes, pre-emptive
management of blood pressure, and judicious selection and
use of drugs. Severe haemodynamic instability may be reduced
by 50% using an ‘intubation bundle’.57
We recommend that a team member is tasked with moni-
toring and managing haemodynamic status. Timing of intu-
bation in the potentially unstable patient is complex. Reliable
intravenous or intraosseous access is vital to enable rapid vol-
ume replacement (before and during intubation) and reliable
drug administration. Balancing the risks of delaying tracheal
intubation against the potential benefits of a more stable in-
duction following fluid resuscitation requires experience.
Effective
preoxygenation
with
CPAP
reduces
hypoxic
myocardial depression and left ventricular afterload.241 In the
absence of cardiac failure, rapid infusion of 500 ml crystalloid
solution
before
or
during
intubation
can
mitigate
hypotension.57 A vasopressor or inotrope should be immedi-
ately available for bolus and infusion during induction and
intubation. In shock states, a vasopressor should also be
considered before induction.239 Ketamine (1e2 mg kg�1) pro-
duces less cardiovascular instability than propofol or thio-
pentone.240,242,243
Etomidate-induced
adrenal
suppression
remains a concern and this drug is not routinely used in criti-
cally ill patients.244,245 Positive pressure ventilation with large
tidal volumes, high respiratory rates and high PEEP will worsen
hypotension and must be avoided. Similarly, bronchospasm
may result in breath-stacking. Post-intubation recruitment
manoeuvres are contraindicated with peri-intubation haemo-
dynamic instability.
Bradycardia during airway manipulation can be related to
hypoxaemia or vagal reflexes and is commonly followed by
haemodynamic collapse. Epinephrine or atropine might be
required but oxygenation is vital. If hypoxaemic cardiac arrest
complicates
failed
airway
management,
perform
chest-
compressions in tandem with airway management. The
combination of severe hypoxaemia and cardiac arrest is likely
to become rapidly fatal.246 Airway interventions are made
more difficult by chest compressions, so cardiac compressions
may need to be paused very briefly.246 A flat capnograph trace
during cardiac arrest is indicative of a misplaced or obstructed
airway provided effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation is in
progress.10,241
Tube selection
A fulldiscussion of trachealtubeselection is beyond the remit of
this guideline. In general terms, the tracheal tube should be
wide enough to enable suction catheter and adult bronchoscope
insertion, provide low resistance to airflow247 whilst reducing
the risk of blockage.248,249 Tubes with subglottic suction or
specialised cuffs may reduce the incidence of micro-aspiration
and
ventilator-associated
pneumonia.250
However,
during
difficult airway management, a smaller (e.g. 6.0 mm inner
diameter) or non-specialized tracheal tube may facilitate easier
intubation. Tube exchange to a larger size or more specific type
can be performed when the airway crisis is resolved.251
Care of the intubated ICU patient
In ICU, the most hazardous phase of airway care is after initial
airway management.11,24 In the UK, over 80% of airway-related
critical incidents occurred after the initial intubation and 30%
were serious.11,24 Incidents commonly relate to complete or
partial device displacement and less frequently occlusion with
secretions or device failure. Training, teamwork, monitoring,
communication, and provision of suitable, familiar equipment
are the basis of prevention and management of these compli-
cations. All staff managing patients on ICU should be trained to
recognize and manage airway displacement or blockage.
We recommend that the ICU consultant ensures that the
team is aware of patients known to have difficult airways.
Ward round safety briefings should include handover of pa-
tients at risk of airway problems with details of initial airway
management and laryngoscopy grade.252 We recommend
handover include patient-specific strategies to prevent and
manage
airway
risks
including
device
displacement
or
blockage, a (re-)intubation and an extubation strategy.
Communication should include relevant clinicians, nurse in
charge, bedside nurse, and physiotherapist: multiprofessional
ward rounds are useful in this regard. Strategies should use

 immediately available equipment and appropriately skilled
clinicians and documented plans should be visible at the
bedside.11
Lack of availability of appropriately skilled clinicians may
require pre-emptive escalation of airway management in
potentially difficult patients (e.g. daytime intubation, before
experienced staff become non-resident).10,11
Bedside care
Bedhead signage highlighting tracheostomy or laryngectomy
stomas are established safety precautions189; examples can be
downloaded
from
www.tracheostomy.org.uk.
Similarly,
signage identifying airway difficulty may reduce adverse
incidents.
The depth of tracheal tube insertion should be documented
on the bedside chart and checked each shift or if respiratory
deterioration occurs. Tubes should be well secured, but the
optimal method is unknown; experienced, vigilant staff are
crucial.253,254 Cuff pressure should be maintained at 20e30 cm
H2O.255,256 Higher inspiratory pressures may require higher
cuff pressures. Apparent cuff leak should be assumed to be
partial extubation until proven otherwise.257
The use of appropriate monitoring is estimated to detect
95% of all critical incidents, and 67% before potential organ
damage has occurred.258 Deterioration may not indicate an
airway emergency, but the airway should be systematically
evaluated in all unstable critically ill patients. Failure to use
capnography in ventilated patients probably contributes to
>70% of ICU airway-related deaths.11 Increasing use of cap-
nography on ICU was described in NAP4 as ‘the single change
with the greatest potential to prevent deaths from airway
complications outside operating theatres’.10 National stan-
dards recommend waveform capnography for all intubations
performed on critically ill patients and for all patients
dependent on an artificial airway.147,259,260 Changes in prac-
tice since NAP4 mean that this is now the expected standard
in the UK.261 While baseline understanding of capnography
interpretation is poor amongst nursing staff and allied health
professionals, it improves with simple training,10,262 and it is
essential that staff receive regular training in capnography
interpretation and crisis management.263
Humidification and regular tracheal suction reduce avoid-
able tube blockage. Management of an apparent partial tracheal
tube obstruction is aided by prompt fibreoptic inspection.190
Interventions such as changing patient position (turns),
physiotherapy, transfers, and insertion of other devices near
the airway (gastric tubes or oesophageal Doppler ultrasound/
echocardiography probes) can cause airway displacement.11,24
Ventilation with the patient in the prone position worsens
airway oedema and is both a risk for displacement and for
difficult management when it occurs. During such procedures
in high-risk patients, nominating an experienced team mem-
ber solely to safeguard the airway may reduce complications.
Sedation holds (to enable assessment of neurological and
cardiorespiratory status) are hazardous with high-risk airways
and require risk assessment.264,265 ‘Mittens’ and other forms of
physical restraint can minimize risk of self-extubation.266
Airway swelling may be reduced by maintaining 35� head-
up positioning and avoidance of unnecessary positive fluid
balances.267 Intravenous corticosteroids for at least 12 h in
high-risk patients may reduce airway oedema, post extubation
stridor, and reintubation rates.267,268 Antibiotics are indicated
if upper airway infection is suspected.
Difficult laryngoscopy is associated with inadvertent endo-
bronchial intubation and traumatic intubation can cause air
leak or pneumothorax.269 Difficult facemask ventilation can
distend the stomach necessitating decompression for optimal
mechanical ventilation. Postintubation chest X-ray can confirm
appropriate tracheal tube insertion depth (but does not confirm
tracheal placement) and identify complications.270,271
If the airway has been traumatized or operated upon,
observe for bleeding, swelling, and surgical emphysema.
Difficult airway management is associated with pharyngeal or
oesophageal injury, which may lead to deep infection and life-
threatening sepsis.272
Respiratory deterioration, especially ‘red flags’ (Table 3)
should prompt immediate attention to the airway and breathing
circuit, particularly after patient movement or procedures.
Difficult tracheal tube exchange
A tracheal tube may require urgent replacement if displaced,
blocked, kinked, if the cuff has failed, or if a small tracheal
tube has been inserted during difficult or fibreoptic airway
management. The safest method of tracheal tube exchange
ensures airway continuity is maintained throughout the pro-
cedure.273,274 Airway exchange catheters (AECs) are specif-
ically designed for this purpose.251,275e277
Exchange should be performed using laryngoscopy. Vid-
eolaryngoscopy is recommended as it is superior to direct
laryngoscopy, leading to better glottic view, higher success
rate, and fewer complications.274
Appropriately trained staff should perform tracheal tube
exchange. Optimal positioning, equipment
provision
and
preparation, emptying the stomach, preoxygenation, perox-
ygenation, and full neuromuscular blockade increase safety.
Tracheal tube exchange should always be approached as a
high-risk intervention, with the same level of preparation as
intubation. Some AECs are hollow and enable oxygen admin-
istration, but even low flow oxygen administration via an AEC
risks barotrauma if the catheter tip is placed or migrates beyond
the carina.207,208,278 We do not recommend oxygen adminis-
tration via an AEC during tracheal tube exchange and, if an AEC
is left in place after extubation, it is safer to administer oxygen
by other means.2
Follow-up
When it is anticipated that future airway management will
prove difficult, an airway alert should be completed and the
information communicated to the patient, family, and their
doctor.279,280 Coding this correctly (e.g. SNOMED CT 718447001:
Systematized Nomenclature of MedicineeClinical Terms in
the UK) increases the likelihood that the information remains
in electronic patient record.281 Prolonged intubation or tra-
cheostomy may cause subglottic or tracheal stenosis which
should be considered at ICU follow up.
Tracheostomy in ICU patients
In the UK approximately two-thirds of new tracheostomies are
performed percutaneously by intensivists in critically ill pa-
tients26,282 and typically 7e19% of all patients admitted to ICU
will undergo tracheostomy.283e286 In NAP4, 50% of ICU incidents
were complications of tracheostomies,11,24,25 most occurring
after insertion due to displacement with fewer episodes of
blockage or haemorrhage. Systematic analyses of adverse
338

 incidents demonstrate common themes: lack of staff training,
lack of capnography and basic bedside equipment, inadequate
environments and support mechanisms, compounded by
poorly considered care pathways and responses.11,24,26,287
Management of tracheostomy emergencies is described by
the
UK
National
Tracheostomy
Safety
Project
(www.
tracheostomy.org.uk), but there are specific considerations
for typical ICU patients with a tracheostomy.188 Most of these
patients have a potentially patent upper airway, although
management of this native airway is ‘difficult’ in approxi-
mately
30%,
with
complications
often
compounded
by
obesity.26
In
patients
who
are
tracheostomy-dependent,
displacement or blockage may be rapidly fatal and the cen-
tral role of waveform capnography in monitoring, recognition,
and management of such events is critical.
Percutaneous tracheostomy stomas are unlikely to be
mature enough for safe tube exchange until 7e10 days,
meaning management of tube blockage/displacement in this
period should focus on securing the native upper airway.189
Improvements in the quality and safety of tracheostomy
care have been demonstrated through comprehensive staff
education, multidisciplinary oversight, multidisciplinary ward
rounds, displaying relevant information on bedhead signs,
and ensuring equipment and infrastructure are available to
prevent, detect, and respond to emergencies.288e295
We recommend that all ICU staff caring for patients receive
training in prevention, detection, and management of tra-
cheostomy emergencies.
Extubation
The topic of extubation has been extensively covered by sepa-
rate DAS extubation guidelines,2 which are readily applied to
ICU practice, with a recent narrative review focussed on ICU
management.296 Extubation occurs either as an unplanned
complication of airway management or as a planned event. In
either case, reintubation after prolonged ventilation can be
anticipated to be more difficult because of airway oedema and
the emergent nature of many re-intubations.
Unplanned extubation
This is common enough that all ICUs should anticipate un-
planned extubation and plan for its occurrence.297,298 Early
recognition is the key to preventing harm and continuous
waveform capnography should enable early detection of both
partial and complete airway displacement. For the patient
without a difficult airway, an urgent intubation strategy using
the current algorithm (Fig. 3) is appropriate. For patients who
have a known difficult airway, evidence suggests that identi-
fication of such patients and appropriate planning is not done
reliably.23
Planned extubation
Up to 15% of patients extubated in ICU require reintubation
within 48 h.299 Extubation should therefore be considered a
‘trial’, with the possibility of (difficult) reintubation actively
planned for.296 Elective extubation of known difficult airways
should only be performed in ‘daytime’ hours. AECs are rec-
ommended: these are airway exchange bougies placed prior to
extubation and retained in situ after extubation and that act as
a conduit for reintubation.2,300 After extubation, the patient
should be observed carefully, with reintubation anticipated,
until they are stable. CPAP, NIV, or HFNO can reduce reintu-
bation rates, especially in high-risk patients.301e304 Post-
extubation stridor occurs in 12e37% of patients.268,305 Steroids
have been advocated to prevent the need for reintubation in
high-risk patients,306,307 but the evidence does not support
their routine use.308
Location of extubation
Where intubation or other aspects of airway management
have been difficult, extubation should be planned carefully.
Depending on the specific patient, personnel, and institutional
situation, it may be best to transfer the patient to the operating
theatre, or to bring anaesthetic staff to the patient’s location to
facilitate safe extubation. In either situation, it must be
remembered that extubation failure in a patient with a diffi-
cult airway may occur late. The ICU team must be prepared for
this possibility: in-theatre extubation does not address this
potential complication. The specifics of extubation planning
are outside the limits of this guidance and specific and rele-
vant guidance is available.2
Special circumstances
Managing the known or anticipated difficult
intubation in the critically ill patient
Identifying patients on ICU with a predicted or known difficult
airway and creating a clear airway strategy is key to safety.
Bedhead signs identifying airway difficulty and describing the
intended airway plan may reduce adverse incidents (http://
das.uk.com).
The combination of a difficult upper airway and impaired
pulmonary gas exchange is an extremely challenging situa-
tion. The most experienced available operator must manage
such cases. Moving
patients with borderline respiratory
function may precipitate complete respiratory failure: ideally
the team should come to the patient in an adequately equip-
ped critical care environment, in preference to transferring the
patient to an operating theatre for airway management. In
elective patients, awake fibreoptic intubation is regarded as
the gold standard for securing the difficult airway, although
seldom used in the critically ill in the UK.309 More recently
videolaryngoscopy, including awake techniques, has become
a viable option in experienced hands.309e311
There are several practical limitations to awake intubation
in the critically ill, including time-critical intubation, and

 limited patient cooperation. Blood, secretions and vomitus in
the airway hamper both fibreoptic visualization and video-
laryngoscopy. Awake techniques may precipitate complete
airway obstruction from over-sedation, topical anaesthesia,
laryngospasm, or bleeding300,312,313; there is a risk of aspiration
and if the nasal route is used this usually requires subsequent
conversion to an oral tracheal tube.248 Critical respiratory
failure may be precipitated during awake intubations, partic-
ularly in patients dependent on CPAP/PEEP.
We recommend that awake intubation should only be
attempted by a suitably skilled and experienced clinician, with
careful
(head-up)
positioning,65,71
minimal
sedation
(if
needed), adequate topical anaesthesia, active peroxygenation
(e.g. HFNO314), and a clear plan for failure.300
When a patient is known to have significant glottic nar-
rowing, all options are difficult but the practicality of awake
techniques and patient tolerance should be carefully balanced
against the potential success of a technique performed after
induction of anaesthesia. There may be a role for preproce-
dural elective cricothyroid or tracheal cannulation to admin-
ister oxygen and assist conversion to FONA if necessary.10,11
Inadequate patient cooperation or urgency usually requires
intubation after induction of anaesthesia.300 We do not
recommend
inhalational
techniques
for
difficult
airway
management in the critically ill as this results in a slow,
difficult induction complicated by upper airway obstruction,
hypoxaemia, and hypercarbia.11,315 Intravenous induction
using full neuromuscular blockade is optimal in most critically
ill patients. When difficult intubation is anticipated, ‘intrave-
nous induction with ‘double set-up’ has been advocated: the
midline is identified (the cricothyroid membrane moves with
neck extension) and marked before induction of anaesthesia,
after which intubation is attempted by one operator with a
second operator primed to perform FONA if required.300
Obesity
There is robust evidence that obesity is an important risk factor
for airway misadventure in the critically ill.261,316 Obese pa-
tients accounted for around 50% of cases in NAP4 and events
led to death or brain damage more often than in non-obese
patients.261 In NAP4, a patient with a BMI >30 kg m�2 was
twice as likely as a slim patient to have a complication of
airway management, and four times as likely with BMI
>40 kg m�2. Difficult intubation was reported twice as
commonly in obese patients in ICU compared to obese patients
in the OR and life-threatening complications were increased
22-fold compared to the non-obese.316 Complications included
difficult intubation (16%), severe hypoxaemia (39%), cardio-
vascular collapse (22%), cardiac arrest (11%), and death (4%).316
Obesity is a risk factor for difficult facemask ventilation,317
SGA placement,318 tracheal intubation,319 and FONA.320,321
However, irrespective of procedural difficulty, the main prob-
lem with obesity is the speed and severity of desaturation,
especially with airway obstruction.322 Obstructive sleep apnoea
should be actively considered as it is often undiagnosed322 and
further increases the risk of intubation, extubation, and car-
diovascular complications.316,323 If the cricothyroid membrane
is impalpable, we recommend preinduction identification us-
ing ultrasound.320 We recommend thorough pre- and perox-
ygenation head up with CPAP/NIV or HFNO.72,86,324 The ramped
position increases intubation success rates.325 If intubation
fails, rapid refractory hypoxaemia is likely and we do not
recommend multiple attempts at intubation, SGA rescue, or
facemask ventilation, but recommend prompt transition to
FONA. Where FONA is required a scalpel technique with a
vertical incision is recommended (Fig. 4).9 This is one group in
whom securing the airway awake with a fibreoptic or video-
laryngoscopy technique should be actively considered.
Cervical spine injury
Between 2% and 5% of major trauma patients have a cervical
spine injury, of which approximately 40% are unstable.326e330
However, the rate of secondary neurological injury attribut-
able to airway management is extremely low.331 Many pa-
tients
are
uncooperative,
hypoxaemic,
and
hypotensive.
Specific goals include urgent airway protection, limiting neu-
raxial mechanical damage whilst maintaining oxygenation
and cord perfusion.
The risk of cervical movement is highest with facemask
ventilation and securing the airway early with RSI is likely to be
beneficial. RSI should be performed using manual-in-line sta-
bilization with removal of at least the anterior part of the cer-
vical collar to facilitate mouth opening, application of cricoid
force and FONA.326,332e334 Laryngeal view is worsened by
manual-in-line stabilization and we recommend use of a bougie
during direct laryngoscopy.335,336 Videolaryngoscopy increases
intubation success with minimal cervical movement and we
recommend a low threshold for its use by appropriately skilled
intubators.335,337e339 There is no compelling evidence that jaw
thrust or laryngeal manipulations (backward upward rightward
pressure, optimal external laryngeal manipulation, cricoid
force) worsen neurological injury.340 Awake techniques are an
option in stable, cooperative patients.341 It is good practice to
record neurological status prior to airway management.
Burns and thermal injury
The classic features of thermally-induced potential airway
obstruction include hoarseness, dysphagia, drooling, wheeze,
carbonaceous sputum, soot in the airway, singed facial or nasal
hairs, or a history of confinement in a burning environment.342
Clinical signs lack sensitivity and are unreliable predictors of
the requirement for intubation.343,344 Normal nasendoscopic
mucosal appearance is reassuring and nasendoscopy can be
repeated at intervals or if there is clinical deterioration.342,343
Dyspnoea, desaturation, and stridor are indications for ur-
gent intubation.342 Carbon monoxide (which artificially in-
creases peripheral oximetry readings) and cyanide poisoning
may worsen tissue hypoxia and compound the emergency.
In the absence of indications for urgent intubation, the
decision to intubate early (to prevent deterioration and
increased difficulty) or manage conservatively (as ventilation
may worsen outcome) may be complex and requires a senior
decision-maker. We recommend obtaining specialist advice
early from a burns centre.342 Patients managed conservatively
should be observed in a high-dependency area, nursed head-
up and remain nil-by-mouth. There should be regular re-
assessment to detect deterioration early. Large volume fluid
resuscitation will worsen airway swelling.345
Awake intubation is an option in this group, but requires
cooperative, stable patients with minimal airway soot and
swelling. Modified RSI is usually the most appropriate tech-
nique. Avoid succinylcholine from 24 h postinjury to avoid
hyperkalaemia. Use an uncut tracheal tube to allow for sub-
sequent facial swelling. Insert a gastric tube after securing the
airway as this may become difficult later.

 Discussion
The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance on
airway management in the critically ill, irrespective of location
in the hospital, that is clear, practical, logical and consistent
with the current evidence base. We believe the guidelines are
necessary and timely as patients with critical illness are a
particularly high-risk group, with specific problems and
needs.10,11,24 As such, the extent to which practice advice and
evidence can be extrapolated from the OR is limited. The
specialty of intensive care medicine is evolving, and this
evolution includes increasing involvement of both junior and
senior clinicians without an anaesthetic background. All these
factors reinforce the need for specialty-specific guidance.
Given the limited robust evidence available, it is inevitable
that the guidelines are an expert consensus opinion (based on
that evidence) and it is equally inevitable that there will be
areas with which some will disagree. To minimize this and to
ensure our goals are met, we have performed up to date
literature searches, liaised with stakeholders and sought
external expert advice in those areas that require particular
subspecialty input.
The guidelines are consistent with current evidence, but
there are considerable areas where the evidence is inadequate
to make robust evidence-based recommendations. Three
areas of particular concern are: (i) the role of HFNO in pre- and
peroxygenation; (ii) the value of videolaryngoscopy in general,
including the role of individual videolaryngoscopes in primary
and rescue airway management; and (iii) the optimal FONA
technique. These are all areas where high quality evidence is
needed to guide practice. The current evidence base is weak,
including studies that are too small, enrol inexperienced cli-
nicians, exclude relevant patients, or have problems of control
group bias. We urge the critical care community to consider
this in prioritizing and funding future research, so that when
these guidelines are revised, the evidence base will be more
relevant and informative. Despite these current limitations,
quality improvement initiatives can and should occur in every
hospital, and by recording the details and complications of
airway management in the critically ill, strategies, equipment
and training needs can be evaluated and addressed.
The authors have reviewed many airway related deaths
and have observed that a typical fatality often takes 45e60 min
from first airway intervention until death occurs. During this
time, it is typical for multiple individuals to make multiple
attempts to secure the airway. Some procedures are repeated
by one, or more than one, person. Many of these deaths also
start with an ‘awkward’ airway (e.g. intubation is almost
achieved at first attempt and ventilation/oxygenation is
possible between attempts), but progresses to an impossible
airway (CICO). In publishing these guidelines, we are keen to
emphasize the ‘timeliness’ of airway management and the
importance of progressing through the airway pathway at an
appropriate speed, without undue repetition of failing tech-
niques. Acute life support guidelines specify times that each
intervention should take (e.g. 2 min cycles of cardiopulmonary
resuscitation between pulse checks and epinephrine admin-
istration every 4 min).346 It seems likely this mandated time-
line improves algorithm compliance. We considered adding a
timeline to the main algorithm but ultimately found this
impractical. Information about the timelines (and transition
points) of both successful and failed difficult airway manage-
ment in the critically ill would be of great benefit. Our opinion
is that it should take significantly less than 15 min to progress
from the beginning of the algorithm to the point at which
FONA is performed.
In this guideline, we emphasize the primacy of oxygenation
during airway management. We also stress embracing the
best in terms of non-technical skills, modern equipment and
technical expertise. These are all emphasized in other airway
guidelines but are especially pertinent to the management of
this vulnerable group of patients.

face-to-face meetings in addition to many hundreds of elec-
tronic exchanges. The Chair and Convener was A.H. All au-
thors contributed materially to all sections as the internal
review process of initial drafts was extensive. A brief outline of
initial drafting is described below. A.H. coordinated the initial
literature search, but the more than 30 000 abstract summaries
were scrutinised by equal proportions of the entire group.
Subsequent hand searching was directed by initial section
drafters. Initial drafts were often written by more than one
author and the description below refers to these initial drafts;
subsequent
refinement
was
fully
shared
at
face-to-face
meetings and by electronic communications.
