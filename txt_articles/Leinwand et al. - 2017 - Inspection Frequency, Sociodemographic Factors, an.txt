Abstract
Objectives: We explored how restaurant inspection frequency and restaurant neighborhood sociodemographic charac-
teristics are related to food safety inspection outcomes in chain and nonchain restaurants to better understand external
factors that may influence inspection outcomes.
Methods: We categorized the results of restaurant inspections in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2013 and 2014 by restaurant
type (chain or nonchain), inspection frequency (1, 2, or �3 per 2-year study period), and violation type (total number of
violations, foodborne-illness risk factor violation, or good retail practice violation). We collected 2013 US Census block group
sociodemographic data for each restaurant neighborhood. We used nested mixed-effects regression analyses to determine the
association between restaurant inspection frequency and inspection violations, as well as between inspection violations and
restaurant neighborhood sociodemographic variables, stratified by restaurant type.
Results: Compared with nonchain restaurants, chain restaurants had significantly fewer total violations per inspection (mean
[SD]: 6.5 [4.6] vs 9.6 [6.8] violations, P < .001). For nonchain restaurants, an increase from 1 to 2 inspections resulted in 0.8
(P < .001) fewer mean violations per inspection, and an increase from 1 to �3 inspections resulted in 1.6 (P < .001) fewer mean
violations; this association was not seen in chain restaurants. For nonchain restaurants, a higher proportion of black residents
in a restaurant neighborhood was associated with 0.6 (P < .001) fewer mean foodborne-illness risk factor violations but 1.0
(P < .001) more mean good retail practice violations per inspection.
Conclusions: A risk-based stratified approach to restaurant food safety inspection frequency, based on whether or not
restaurants are part of chains, could reduce the frequency of violations, particularly in restaurants with the most violations.

Foodborne illnesses are a serious public health concern, with
the annual burden estimated to be 48 million illnesses,
128 000 hospitalizations, and 3000 deaths in the United
States in 2011.1,2 In a study published in 2015, the estimated
aggregated annual cost of foodborne illness to the US econ-
omy was $55.5 billion.3 Although foodborne illnesses can be
caused by food cooked in or outside the home, two-thirds of
foodborne illness outbreaks occur in restaurant settings.4 This
finding raises even more concern in the United States, where
the proportion of meals eaten outside the home has been
increasing: 43.7% of food budgets in 2014 were spent in res-
taurants, and >$738 billion was spent in 2015 on food con-
sumed outside the home.5,6 In a 2013 report, consumption of
food prepared outside the home was listed as 1 of the 5 pri-
mary factors contributing to foodborne illness.7
Restaurant safety monitoring has traditionally been
handled by municipal inspection officials in accordance with
the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) Food Code, which lists 5 major areas that

 inspectors should cover during routine inspections.8 The
FDA Food Code recommends inspecting full-service restau-
rants 3 times per year. However, cities are not required to
follow these recommendations and may instead establish
independent, more lenient inspection protocols.
Although the FDA suggests that inspection scores are a
proxy measure for restaurant food safety, research has not
demonstrated a relationship between restaurant inspection
scores and the burden of foodborne illness. Some studies
have found a relationship between inspection scores and
rates of foodborne illness, whereas others have not.1,9-11 This
discrepancy may be caused in part by the challenges of
studying the epidemiology of foodborne illnesses, which
include difficulty determining the location of the foodborne
illness exposure and underreporting of subclinical cases of
foodborne illness.4,7
The discrepancy in study findings about the relationship
between restaurant inspection scores and foodborne illness
rates could also be related to socioeconomic disparities that
may exist for foodborne illness rates and local restaurant
food safety practices. For example, some studies have
reported more restaurant violations in areas of high poverty,
whereas other studies have observed fewer violations in
these areas.12 Also, people with higher incomes may be more
likely than those with lower incomes to handle raw meat and
have discretionary income to spend on restaurants.12,13 How-
ever, residents in areas of lower socioeconomic status may
have less access to supermarkets and more access to fast-
food chain and takeout restaurants than those living in areas
of higher socioeconomic status.14-17 Yet, the importance of
many of these socioeconomic differences is not well under-
stood. For example, the relationship between foodborne
illness and access to supermarkets and fast-food restaurants
is unclear. Additionally, although reliance on restaurant
food instead of food obtained from supermarkets may
decrease the risk of foodborne illness, results of research
on this topic are mixed. Finally, although differences in
foodborne illness rates for different socioeconomic groups
have been reported, these differences may reflect differ-
ences between better-educated diners and less-well-
educated diners in rates of illness reporting (likely because
of differences in treatment-seeking behavior) as well as
differences in access to health care according to a neighbor-
hood’s socioeconomic status.12,18
The relationship between restaurant inspection scores and
rates of foodborne illness may also be influenced by the types
of food and preparation methods used in restaurants. Chain
restaurants typically serve food that is less perishable and
requires less preparation than food in nonchain restaurants.
As a result, chain restaurants have generally had lower rates
of foodborne illnesses and fewer inspection violations than
nonchain restaurants. In contrast, full-service nonchain res-
taurants have had higher rates of foodborne illnesses as com-
pared with chain restaurants, likely because they use more
raw ingredients and complex food preparation.1,4,19 Consis-
tent oversight and standardized food preparation protocols
may also contribute to better inspection scores in chain res-
taurants than in nonchain restaurants. Consequently, non-
chain restaurants may benefit from the use of data on
inspection outcomes in chain restaurants as benchmarks for
comparison, particularly when trying to assess the impact of
other environmental and socioeconomic factors on their food
safety practices and outcomes.
The objective of this study was to explore how restaurant
inspection frequency and restaurant neighborhood sociode-
mographic characteristics are related to restaurant food
safety inspection outcomes in chain and nonchain restau-
rants. We hypothesized that restaurant inspection frequency
and restaurant neighborhood sociodemographic characteris-
tics would be more strongly associated with inspection out-
comes in nonchain restaurants than in chain restaurants.
Methods
Data Sources
We obtained restaurant names, locations, and inspection
results from the Clean Plates database, compiled by the Phi-
ladelphia Inquirer and available to the public.20 This data-
base contains aggregated data that are automatically updated
from the online website of the Philadelphia Department of
Public Health, which conducts all restaurant safety inspec-
tions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia
Department of Public Health uses a modified inspection pro-
tocol based on FDA recommendations, and it aims to con-
duct routine inspections of all restaurants within the city
limits once per year.
We collected Philadelphia restaurant inspection data
reported from January 2013 through December 2014. These
data included details on inspections (date, time, purpose,
type, inspector name), restaurants (name, license number,
location, name of person in charge), and violations (number
and type of violations). The Clean Plates database includes
tabulated reports of 2 types of violations: foodborne-illness
risk factors and good retail practices. Foodborne-illness risk
factor violations are practices or procedures that, scientists
say, play a direct role in transmitting germs, and they include
food kept at improper temperatures and failure to properly
clean equipment used to prepare food. Good retail practice
violations, which are considered to be less critical violations,
are deficiencies in practices or procedures that, research sug-
gests, can prevent the conditions that lead to contamination
but do not cause illness directly, such as dirty floors or
improper garbage storage. We received these data from the
Philadelphia Inquirer in a comma-separated values file.21
We filtered the data set in several ways. We included only
routine annual inspections and excluded inspections that
were compliance checks, reinspections, environmental
assessments, or responses to complaints. We limited the type
of facilities to eat-in or takeout restaurants; thus, we excluded
retail food establishments, daycare facilities, schools, resi-
dential facilities, and caterers. We also excluded restaurants
Leinwand et al
181
 within the Philadelphia International Airport because they
are not located within the boundaries of the city of Philadel-
phia and therefore could not be matched with our sociode-
mographic data. We also excluded some variables in the data
set (eg, name of the inspector, person in charge of the res-
taurant) because they were not pertinent or were difficult to
analyze quantitatively.
We divided restaurants into 2 types: chain and nonchain.
We defined chain restaurants as those with at least 15 loca-
tions worldwide, and we determined which restaurants fit
into this category by manually searching Internet-based
sources, such as restaurant websites. We categorized restau-
rant inspection frequency as 1, 2, or �3 inspections during
the 2-year study period. Restaurants rarely received >3
inspections during this period.
We accessed 2013 US Census American Community Sur-
vey block group data to collect sociodemographic informa-
tion related to the location of each restaurant in our study.22
The restaurant inspection database included latitude and
longitude coordinates for each restaurant, which we used
to locate the restaurants on 2013 US Census maps of Phi-
ladelphia. In the US Census, block groups are contiguous
areas of land that are divisions of a census tract and typi-
cally contain 600 to 3000 residents. Block groups are the
smallest geographical unit with census sociodemographic
data available and were considered most representative of
the area surrounding each restaurant. By merging the res-
taurant geographic data with the census block group data,
we were able to obtain restaurant neighborhood data on our
variables of interest, including total population count, med-
ian age of residents, proportion of college-educated resi-
dents, median annual household income, proportion of
black residents, proportion of Hispanic residents, and pro-
portion of residents living in poverty. We merged geo-
graphic data using ArcGIS release 10.2.23
Statistical Methods
We summarized continuous variables using means and
standard deviations (SDs), and we compared restaurant types
(chain vs nonchain) using t tests. We summarized categorical
variables using frequencies and percentages, and we com-
pared groups using Pearson w2 tests. We analyzed the number
of violations (total and by type) reported for each restaurant
inspection conducted during the study period. Because mul-
tiple inspections could occur in a single restaurant or in a
single geographic block group, we adjusted for multiple
instances of the same restaurant and block group.
We used a nested model to adjust for random effects of
multiple data points within the same restaurant and block
group. We used mixed-effects linear regression to determine
the relationships between the frequency of inspections at
each restaurant during the 2-year period and the number of
inspection violations found at each restaurant, stratified by
restaurant type (chain or nonchain). We adjusted the model
for block group sociodemographic characteristics, including
total population count, proportion of unemployed residents,
proportion of college-educated residents, median annual
household income, proportion of black residents, proportion
of Hispanic residents, and proportion of residents living in
poverty. We coded the inspection frequency category as a
factor variable to assess the relationship between inspection
frequency and number of violations per inspection.
We also used nested mixed-effects logistic regression to
assess the relationships between number of violations per
inspection and block group sociodemographic characteris-
tics, adjusted for all block group sociodemographic charac-
teristics. We assessed these relationships among all
restaurants; then, we compared chain restaurant relationship
results with nonchain restaurant relationship results. We used
a nested model to adjust for random effects of multiple
inspection outcomes within the same individual restaurant
and within the same block group.
We performed statistical analyses using Stata release
12.24 We considered P � .05 to be significant. This study
was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.
Results
During the 2-year study period, 68.0% (2662 of 3915) of
nonchain restaurants and 58.8% (394 of 671) of chain restau-
rants were inspected only once (P < .001; Table 1). Com-
pared with nonchain restaurants, chain restaurants had
significantly fewer total violations per inspection (mean
[SD]: 6.5 [4.6] vs 9.6 [6.8] violations, P < .001), fewer
foodborne-illness risk factor violations per inspection (1.9
[2.1] vs 2.9 [3.0] violations, P < .001), and fewer good retail
practice violations per inspection (4.6 [3.2] vs 6.6 [4.7] vio-
lations, P < .001). Compared with the block groups near
chain restaurants, the block groups near nonchain restaurants
had a significantly lower mean total population (1316 [5978]
vs 1516 [640] people, P < .001), lower median household
income ($43035 [$22872] vs $45016 [$21483], P ¼ .01),
higher proportion of black residents (38.3% [36.4%] vs
28.9% [31.1%], P < .001), higher proportion of Hispanic
residents (11.0% [17.6%] vs 9.6% [13.9%], P ¼ .02), and
higher proportion of residents living in poverty (25.2%
[17.4%] vs 21.7% [15.3%], P < .001).
Among all restaurants, an increase from 1 to 2 inspections
during the 2-year study period was significantly associated
with a 0.9 decrease in mean violations per inspection (P <
.001), and an increase from 1 to �3 inspections was signif-
icantly associated with a 1.4 decrease in mean violations per
inspection (P < .001; Table 2). The findings for nonchain
restaurants were similar: an increase from 1 to 2 inspections
was significantly associated with a 0.8 decrease in mean
violations per inspection (P < .001), and an increase from
1 to �3 inspections was significantly associated with a 1.6
decrease in mean violations per inspection (P < .001). How-
ever, this association between increased number of inspec-
tions during the 2-year period and decreased mean violations

 per inspection was not seen among chain restaurants
(Figure).
Among all restaurants, the number of total violations per
inspection was not associated with any block group socio-
demographic characteristics (Table 3). However, the number
of foodborne-illness risk factor violations per inspection was
significantly negatively associated with the proportion of
black residents in restaurant block groups (coefficient ¼
–0.59, P < .001), whereas the number of good retail practice
violations per inspection was significantly positively associ-
ated with the proportion of black residents (coefficient ¼
1.00, P < .001) and Hispanic residents (coefficient ¼ 1.47,
P ¼ .007).
The findings for nonchain restaurants were similar to
those for all restaurants: the number of foodborne-illness risk
factor violations per inspection was significantly negatively
associated with the proportion of black residents in restaurant
block groups (coefficient ¼ –0.78, P < .001), whereas the
number of good retail practice violations was significantly
positively associated with the proportion of black residents
(coefficient ¼ 1.00, P < .001) and Hispanic residents (coef-
ficient ¼ 1.52, P ¼ .007; Table 3).
Among chain restaurants, the number of good retail prac-
tice violations per inspection was significantly negatively
associated with the total population count of restaurant block
groups (coefficient ¼ –0.01, P ¼ .05), but we did not identify
any additional significant associations between the number
of restaurant inspection violations and block group sociode-
mographic characteristics.
Discussion
This study provides a new perspective on restaurant food
safety in a large, diverse US city. We identified substantial
differences between chain and nonchain restaurant inspec-
tion outcomes in Philadelphia during the study period. In
nonchain restaurants, increased inspection frequency was
associated with fewer violations per inspection; however,
in chain restaurants, changes in the number of inspections
did not affect the number of violations per inspection. In
addition, the number of inspection violations per inspection
were consistently higher in nonchain restaurants than in
chain restaurants, regardless of inspection frequency. Our
findings of lower rates of violations in chain restaurants
compared with nonchain restaurants are consistent with pre-
vious research on the impact of employee training on inspec-
tion outcomes, in which findings indicated that critical
violations were more likely to be found in nonchain

 restaurants than in chain restaurants.25 In restaurant neigh-
borhoods with higher proportions of black residents,
nonchain restaurants were likely to have fewer foodborne-
illness risk factor violations per inspection than chain restau-
rants yet more good retail practice violations per inspection.
Finally, we found that in restaurant neighborhoods with
larger populations compared with smaller populations, chain
restaurants were likely to have fewer good retail practice
violations per inspection than nonchain restaurants.
We note that nonchain restaurants that were inspected
only once during the 2-year study period had an average of
65% more violations per inspection than chain restaurants
with the same inspection frequency. These results indicate
that in this particular setting, nonchain restaurants may have
been more influenced by the frequency of food safety inspec-
tion than chain restaurants. These findings also imply that
changes in the targeting and scheduling of food safety
inspections could improve the efficiency of detecting viola-
tions. Health departments and city inspection officials could
use these findings to focus their efforts on nonchain restau-
rants and use risk-based models to increase the frequency of
inspections in those restaurants.
In restaurant neighborhoods with higher proportions of
black residents, nonchain restaurants had fewer foodborne-
illness risk factor violations than restaurant neighborhoods
with lower proportions of black residents. In areas of Phila-
delphia with more black residents, nonchain restaurants may
have served food carrying substantially less risk of food-
borne illness than restaurants in areas with fewer black res-
idents. These nonchain restaurants may process their
ingredients and handle raw food to a lesser extent than non-
chain restaurants with fewer black residents so that they more
closely resemble chain restaurants. Alternatively, these results
mayhavebeeninfluencedbyotherunrelatedfactors.Forexam-
ple, Philadelphia’s Center City, which is the city’s main tourist
destination and has a predominantly white population, has a
high density of nonchain restaurants compared with other areas
of the city. Using US Census area data and location variables
within our inspection database, we found 513 restaurants per
square mile in Center City and 24 restaurants per square mile
outside Center City.26 Thus, the results for Center City may
have been influenced by the large number of nonresident vis-
itors, in which case the block group sociodemographic charac-
teristic data that we used, which were based only on local
residents, may not have accurately represented the customers
of these restaurants. Future analyses may be necessary to more
fully understand the impact of restaurant density and tourist
population characteristics on inspection outcomes.
Conversely, the total violation and foodborne-illness risk
factor violation outcomes for chain restaurant inspections
were not associated with any block group sociodemographic
characteristics. This lack of variation in the inspection out-
comes for chain restaurants was not unexpected, because
theoretically they engage in the same training, practices, and
oversight in all of their facilities throughout the city. How-
ever, we did find that chain restaurants in neighborhoods
with larger populations had fewer good retail practice viola-
tions per inspection. The finding of fewer good retail practice
violations may have resulted from various unique circum-
stances of chain restaurants in these more populated areas,
such as higher volumes of customers, thereby increasing the

 restaurants’ profitability and allowing the owners to dedicate
more funding and staff time to aesthetic upkeep.
Nonchain restaurants had more good retail practice viola-
tions per inspection in neighborhoods with higher rather than
lower proportions of black and Hispanic residents. One pos-
sible explanation for this finding is that neighborhoods with
larger racial/ethnic minority populations tend to have fewer
restaurants and less access to municipal services. Therefore,
restaurant owners in these block areas may have reduced
means to maintain restaurant cleanliness or may not empha-
size cleanliness as much as restaurant owners in block groups
with fewer racial/ethnic minority populations because of less
competition from other restaurants. Previous research on res-
taurant inspection outcomes in Philadelphia found that
foodborne-illness risk factor violations were reported at a
higher rate in restaurants in areas with more Hispanic resi-
dents, which represents findings different from those of the
current study.12 However, this previous research was not
stratified by restaurant type, and both studies highlight var-
iations in inspection outcomes based on neighborhood socio-
demographic variables.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, the analysis was not
adjusted for restaurants that had just opened or were closed
permanently during the 2-year period. Some of these restau-
rants may ultimately have had fewer inspections than they
might have had if they had been open during the entire study
period, potentially affecting our inspection frequency results.
In addition, some of the new restaurants may have been
inspected before they had developed established routines;
as such, they may have incurred more violations per inspec-
tion, potentially skewing the outcomes for the groups of
restaurants with fewer inspections. We did try to minimize
the impact of this latter confounder and keep the focus on
fully operational restaurants by excluding from our analysis
all initial-opening inspections for new restaurants. Second,
the data that we used were based only on restaurants that had
been inspected during the 2-year study period. Some restau-
rants in Philadelphia may not have been inspected at all
during that time and so were not represented in the database.
This limitation highlights one of the challenges faced by
public health departments in large cities. We tried to mini-
mize the impact of this limitation by selecting a 2-year study
period rather than a 1-year study period, hoping to capture
data on inspection results from as many restaurants as pos-
sible. Finally, qualitative factors including different
employee training practices or variation in relationships
between restaurant owners and city health personnel could
have affected the restaurant inspection outcome results of our
study. If so, future research may need to consider the roles

bBlock group demographic data obtained from the 2013 US Census American Community Survey.22 Block groups are contiguous areas of land that are
divisions of a census tract and typically contain 600 to 3000 residents. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit with census demographic data available
and were considered most representative of the area surrounding each restaurant.

deficiencies in practices or procedures that, research suggests, can prevent the conditions that lead to contamination but do not cause illness directly.

 that employee training practices and interpersonal connec-
tions play in the restaurant inspection process.
Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that a risk-based stratified
approach to restaurant food safety inspection frequency,
based on whether or not restaurants are part of chains, could
reduce the frequency of violations, particularly in those res-
taurants with the most violations. These findings may be
valuable for other cities, but a local analysis of inspection
outcomes would be required to determine if similar oppor-
tunities for improvement exist. Based on our findings, public
health departments in Philadelphia and elsewhere could con-
sider focusing more of their food safety inspection efforts on
nonchain restaurants than on chain restaurants, while apply-
ing a lower level of scrutiny to chain restaurants, which have
internal food safety protocols and economies of scale that
may reduce the likelihood of food safety violations. Addi-
tional research is warranted on how the sociodemographic
composition of the neighborhoods around restaurants affects
food safety inspection outcomes.
