Abstract
Background: With the availability of raw DNA generated from direct-to-consu-
mer (DTC) testing companies, there has been a proliferation of third-party online
services that are available to interpret the raw data for both genealogy and/or
health purposes. This study examines the current landscape and downstream clini-
cal implications of consumer use of third-party services.
Methods: Study participants were recruited online from social media platforms.
A total of 321 survey respondents reported using third-party services for raw
DNA interpretation.
Results: Participants were highly motivated to explore raw DNA for ancestral
information (67%), individual health implications (62%), or both (40%). Partici-
pants primarily used one of seven companies to interpret raw DNA; 73% used
more than one. Company choice was driven by the type of results offered (51%),
price (45%), and online reviews (31%). Approximately 30% of participants shared
results with a medical provider and 21% shared with more than one. Outcomes of
sharing ranged from disinterest/discounting of the information to diagnosis of
genetic conditions. Participants were highly satisfied with their decision to analyze
raw DNA (M = 4.54/5), yet challenges in understanding interpretation results
were reported irrespective of satisfaction ratings.
Conclusion: Consumers face challenges in understanding the results and may
seek out clinical assistance in interpreting their raw DNA results.

INTRODUCTION
The landscape of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomics is
continuously evolving. Several companies offer DTC ances-
try testing for genealogy purposes, including Family Tree
DNA, AncestryDNA, and 23andMe (Kirkpatrick & Rashkin,
2017). Raw DNA data files are available from these and
other companies that can be transferred to third-party online
sites for further interpretation, including interpretation for
health purposes (Bettinger, 2013; 23andyou.com). Third-
party sites include companies such as Promethease, which is
a literature retrieval service (based on literature cited in the

 SNPedia wiki), that creates personal DNA reports for $5.
Other sites offer services to interpret a range of health condi-
tions which vary in price and service (e.g., Genetic Genie,
Genomapp, Interpretome, LiveWello).
Following the cease and desist letter from the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to 23andMe in late 2013,
which ordered the company to discontinue marketing of
the Personal Genome Service (PGS) and led to the
23andMe’s decision to remove health information in their
genetic reports, consumers who were interested in health
information could seek out third-party online sites to fulfill
this need. As such, raw DNA interpretation companies saw
a growth in the demand for these services (Bettinger, 2013;
Cariaso & Lennon, 2012; Regalado, 2014).
Direct-to-consumer companies such as 23andMe will
once again start returning some health risks results following
the April 2017 approval of a limited set of health conditions
(Food and Drug Administration, 2017). Yet, consumer use
of third-party DNA interpretation services will likely con-
tinue to grow, particularly with national precision medicine
initiatives such as the All of Us Research Program, in which
cohort participants are anticipated to have access to their gen-
ome sequence data for personal use (Collins & Varmus,
2015; National Institutes of Health, 2017).
Currently, very little is known about how consumers are
using raw DNA interpretation services. This study set out
to examine the current raw DNA interpretation landscape,
assess the impact of these services on consumers, and con-
sider the downstream implications of these services on the
health care system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Ethical compliance
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
at Boston University Medical Center, IRB#: H-35096.
2.2 | Participants
Study participants were recruited through social media plat-
forms including Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, between May
and June 2016. Paid targeted advertisements for the online
survey were used to recruit participants from Facebook and
Twitter. Unpaid “posts” advertising the survey were placed on
topically relevant subreddits within Reddit (e.g., /r/genetics, /r/
genealogy, /r/23andMe, /r/promethease). All study advertising
periods took place over a 10–14-day period.
2.3 | Procedures
Participants clicked on the targeted ads or posts and were
directed to the study landing page, where they read an
online consent statement. Participants who clicked “ok”
to agree to participate were then directed to the first
question on the survey. Survey topics were informed by
other
large-scaled
studies
conducted
on
DTC
testing
(Roberts et al., 2017) and survey items were not intended
for the collection of psychometric data on validated psy-
chometric scales. Questions on the survey focused on
consumer motivations and decisions to use third-party
services to interpret raw DNA including the types of ser-
vices used, how they learned about the service, and rea-
sons underlying choice of service. In addition, survey
items asked the extent to which consumers shared the
interpreted results with others, including medical provi-
ders, and the outcomes of sharing that information. Satis-
faction with choice of service and with the interpreted
information was also assessed (see Appendix S1 for
survey).
2.4 | Analytic plan
Descriptive statistics were used to compute means and
standard deviations for continuous variables and counts
with percentages for categorical variables. All analyses
were conducted using SPSS version 24. Chi-square, linear
and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine
demographic and psychosocial correlates of (a) sharing of
interpreted results with medical professionals, and (b) satis-
faction
with
raw
DNA
interpretation.
Open-ended
responses provided within text fields on the survey were
reviewed and thematically coded and quantified where
appropriate.

RESULTS
3.1 | Participant demographics
From the advertising campaign and online posts, a total of
540 individuals provided online consent for the survey and
entered the study. Among these individuals, 478 (89%)
reported
using
DTC
genetic
testing
services
(e.g.,
23andMe, AncestryDNA). Out of those who reported using
DTC testing, a total of 321/478 (67%) reported using a
third-party service to interpret raw DNA (e.g., Promethease,
LiveWello), and thus represent the final sample for the
study. Study participants ranged in age from 18 to 81
(M = 46, SD = 15), 68% were female, 82% were White,
and 74% were college educated (see Table 1).
3.2 | Motivation and decisions to use of
online raw DNA interpretation services
Consumers were asked to indicate their motivations to fur-
ther explore their raw DNA, on a 5-point Likert ranging
36 |
WANG ET AL.
 from “not important at all” (1) to “extremely important”
(5); responses were dichotomized into highly important (4
or 5 on scale) versus not. Approximately 67% were highly
motivated to explore raw DNA for ancestral information,
62% for individual health implications, 50% due to curios-
ity about new technology, and 48% for family health impli-
cations (see Figure 1). When comparing responses for
ancestry and individual health, 40% indicated that informa-
tion for both was highly important, whereas 28% indicated
ancestry motives only, and 22% indicated individual health
motives only.
When asked about decisions to select third-party inter-
pretation services, 73% of consumers reported using more
than one company. Companies used for raw DNA interpre-
tation included Promethease (81%), GEDmatch (62%),
Family Tree DNA (36%), Genetic Genie (20%), LiveWello,
(16%), Interpretome (9%), and DNA.Land (6%). Figure 2
presents the reasons endorsed by consumers for choosing
the service(s) used, which included the types of results
offered (51%), price (45%), online reviews (31%), family/
friend recommendation (15%), Google search (11%), and
other (12% – e.g., recommendation on social media, ease
of understanding, presentation format and searchability).
3.3 | Health care seeking and sharing
behaviors
Consumers were asked about health information seeking
and sharing behaviors related to raw DNA interpretation.
Only 5% reported seeking advice from a medical practi-
tioner before having raw DNA analyzed by a third-party
service and 30% responded either “probably” or “defi-
nitely” when asked whether their physician should be
responsible for helping them interpret their results. In terms
of discussing or sharing results of the raw DNA report with
others, 83% reported sharing with family, 62% shared with
friends, 30% shared with a medical provider, and 8%
shared with others (e.g., online groups, discussion forums,
blogs). Among the 96 consumers (out of 321) who shared
with a medical provider, 80% shared with a primary care
provider, 10% shared with a nurse practitioner, 14% shared
with a genetic counselor, and 25% shared with another spe-
cialist (e.g., oncologist, ophthalmologist, rheumatologist,
naturopathic doctor, psychiatrist, dermatologist, nutrition-
ist). Notably, 21% shared with more than one medical
provider.
Sharing of results with medical professionals varied
depending on consumers’ motives for using third-party
interpretation services. Only 9% of consumers with high
ancestry information motives (only) shared results with a
medical provider, compared to 47% of consumers with
high individual health motives only or 42% of consumers
who reported both high ancestry and individual health
motives
(v2
(3) = 38.4,
p < .001).
Multiple
logistic
regression analysis revealed that general health motives,
including both individual and family motives, were sig-
nificant correlates of sharing with medical providers, with
higher
motives
corresponding
to
greater
sharing
(Table 2). In addition, those who were more satisfied
with the information received from the raw DNA service
were also significantly more likely to share results with
medical providers.
3.4 | Outcomes of sharing raw DNA
interpretation results with a medical provider
For participants who reported sharing their results with a
medical provider, an open-ended question followed that
asked, “What was the outcome of sharing your results
with a medical practitioner?” Illustrative quotes from the
survey highlighting the outcomes of sharing are provided
in Table 3. With primary care providers, approximately
23% of the open-ended comments were related to the
lack of discussion of the results due to provider disinter-
est, lack of understanding of the information, or dis-
counting of results. Consumer responses also reflected
interest
by
some
primary
care
providers
and

 willingness to learn more about the DNA results pre-
sented. Other outcomes related either to discussion of
supplements
or
modifications
of
medication
due
to
results. In some cases, there was discussion on the impli-
cations of DNA test results on medical management
including hemochromatosis and breast cancer.
Among those who shared with only genetic counselors,
outcomes reported included additional clinical testing to
verify reports or counseling on results and providing reas-
surance. Sharing outcomes with other specialists depended
on the type of specialist in question. Consumers reported
confirmation of various conditions including early age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) and von Willebrand
disease (2B), and identification of LHON mitochondrial
and BRCA mutations.
3.5 | Satisfaction with decision to analyze
raw DNA and interpretation results
Consumers were asked about how happy they were with
the choice to have their raw DNA analyzed (5-point Likert,
higher score reflecting greater happiness). A total of 64%
reported 5 out of 5, and 29% reported 4 out of 5
(M = 4.54, SD = 0.72). Open-ended text elaborating on the
positive quantitative responses reflected several themes
including a) confirmation or explanation of health issues in
self or family (e.g., “it confirmed everything that I had
already been diagnosed with and allowed me to be aware
of which mutations I have in case they ever become acti-
vated”) and b) identification of health issues not previously
suspected (e.g., “The information literally saved my life. I

 had no reason to suspect my BRCA positive status.”).
Some consumers also reported being very happy to learn
both family and health information due to their adopted
status (e.g., “I am adopted [and] it gives me something to
go on where I had nothing before.” and “I know now more
about myself than I ever had in 55 years of living, as a
black market adoption, I can finally give some medical info
to my children. I really do have relatives!!!”).
The majority of consumers reported being very satisfied
(34%) or satisfied (47%) with the information they received
from the raw DNA interpretation service, whereas 19% were
neither unsatisfied or satisfied, unsatisfied, or very unsatisfied.
In multiple linear regression analysis, significant correlates of
greater satisfaction with information included less education,
higher motivation due to curiosity with new technology, and
having shared results with a medical provider (Table 2).
When asked to elaborate on their quantitative response,
open-ended responses highlighted factors that influenced
satisfaction ratings (Table 4). For those consumers who
indicated a response other than “very satisfied”, qualitative
comments primarily reflected confusion and lack of under-
standing of the reported results, and a lack of resolution to
the questions they were seeking answers for.

DISCUSSION
This study reflects the first attempt to our knowledge to
assess
the
landscape
of
consumer
use
of
third-party
services to interpret raw DNA. The findings from this
study shed light into how consumers are finding ways to
interpret their genetic data irrespective of the Food and
Drug Administration’s (FDA) policy regulations. Moreover,
although 23andMe was recently granted approval by the
FDA to begin returning a subset of health results (Food
and Drug Administration, 2017), it is anticipated that con-
sumer demand for raw DNA interpretation will nonetheless
increase as a result of the growing availability of genetic
data from direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing companies, as
well as large-scale research initiatives (e.g., All of Us
Research Program, National Institutes of Health, 2017).
Similar
to
other
studies
examining
DTC
personal
genetic testing outcomes, consumers are motivated to seek
out raw DNA interpretation both for ancestry and health
purposes
(Roberts
&
Ostergren,
2013;
Roberts
et al.,
2017). Not surprisingly, consumers whose primary motive
was ancestry (only) were significantly less likely to share
results with medical professionals. These results add to the
prior literature on characteristics of consumers who share
results
with
healthcare
providers
(Darst,
Madlensky,
Schork, Topol, & Bloss, 2014; Koeller, Uhlmann, Carere,
Green, & Roberts, 2017; van der Wouden et al., 2016).
Notably, greater satisfaction with raw DNA information
also corresponded to greater sharing of results with medical
providers (and vice versa), suggesting that satisfaction and
sharing behaviors may be inextricably linked. Further lon-
gitudinal research is needed to tease out the direction of
the effect.

 TABLE 3
Outcomes of sharing with medical practitioners – illustrative quotes (N = 96)
Primary care provider (MD) = 77/96, 80% (57/96, 59% shared only with PCP)
Doctor not interested in
results, did nothing (13/57,
23%)
• They ignored me. Don’t have time to deal with it.
• No outcome. The doctor had no idea what I was talking about.
• He didn’t seem impressed.
• He dismissed the information.
• General indifference.
• Did not share full results. Only anecdotes that were met with skepticism.
• Told to ignore the results, and they were likely inaccurate in some way. Informed my results were ana-
lyzed in a CLIA lab, and were accurate, only to be told that there wasn’t time to sufficiently answer my
questions. Insurance declined any use of genetic counselor without additional testing and family history
even though I already had raw data.
• They said they’d keep it, but didn’t feel it was of worth. . . I feel it is a good thing to keep in case you
come up with a mystery problem in the future. It helps narrow down potential illness.
Doctor interested, learned
from patient, patient-driven
care (16/57, 29%)
• He found the data interesting but it did not impact my treatment.
• She did not know much about it, but believes DNA analysis is the future.
• Desire to investigate further.
• They learned something.
• The medical practitioner learned something of use to my care, and, the medical practitioner appeared to
gain a better understanding of why DTC testing is so useful.
• He was interested. Also we were sort of amazed that it foretold many illnesses that I now suffer. Such
as an prediction of diabetes, heart problems and arthritis and a possible link to prostate cancer in my
future.
• She scanned the results for my medical records. We discussed some of my concerns. It was the first
time she had ever seen a DNA report.
Modification of supplements
or medications (7/57, 12%)
• Prescribed supplements for methylation defects.
• Doctor prescribed nutritional supplements.
• Modified type of medication prescribed to fit genomic profile.
• Checked to make sure it was okay to take supplements due to homozygous for MTHFR. Dr said it was
and is okay. What I learned about this and other SNPs from Promethease and 23andMe helped explain
a lot about my own medical history as well as the past medical history of deceased relatives. It’s so
interesting.
• The most immediate outcome was that it made me realize that the aching in my legs was actually
myopathy and a reaction to the statin I was prescribed. We agreed to stop taking the statin and I got better.
Follow-up testing or
treatment (7/57, 12%)
• Checking more lab tests.
• Dismissed as unreliable, but willing to order a clinical test due to symptoms, which confirmed genetic
prediction. This happened twice with two different primary care doctors.
• I was diagnosed with hemochromatosis and began treatment.
• My PCP helped bring me into perspective about how having the risk of something doesn’t mean I need
more intrusive testing. For example, I had some indications of risk for breast cancer. But my PCP clari-
fied that because my lack of breast cancer in my family history and the small percentage of genetically
inherited breast cancer, I shouldn’t jump to more costly procedures unnecessarily.
Nurse practitioner (NP) = 10/96, 10% (3/96, 3% shared only with NP)
• Amplified the information and advice.
• She was interested in learning more.
• More testing.
Genetic counselor (GC) = 13/96, 14% (3/96, 3% shared only with GC)
• Reassurance that there was nothing to worry about.
• Explained mutations and gave recommendations.
• He was completely disinterested. And tossed them away.
Other – specialist = 24/96, 25% (13/96 shared only with other specialist)
Ophthalmologist
• They ran a few tests and confirmed that I had early AMD as well as Van Willebrands (2B) [sic].

WANG ET AL.
 Consistent with prior literature, approximately 30% of
consumers in this study report sharing their raw DNA
interpretation results with medical professionals (Darst
et al., 2014; van der Wouden et al., 2016). The majority
of those who reported sharing with medical professionals
shared with a primary care provider (PCP). Responses
from PCPs were mixed with approximately 23% lacking
interest in the results or dismissing the information. Simi-
lar findings related to PCP responses have been reported
in other surveys of DTC consumers (van der Wouden
et al., 2016). Prior research has demonstrated that PCPs
feel they lack the requisite knowledge about DTC testing
and feel ill-prepared and challenged to support patients,
which may underlie some of the responses noted by con-
sumers (Brett, Metcalfe, Amor, & Halliday, 2012; Carroll
et al., 2016; Mainous, Johnson, Chirina, & Baker, 2013;
Powell, Cogswell et al., 2012; Powell, Christianson et al.,
2012). Additional research on PCP responses when raw
DNA
interpretation
results
are
shared
by
patients
is
warranted.
In this study, over 20% of consumers shared DNA inter-
pretation results with more than one medical professional.
The
outcomes
of
sharing
with
medical
professionals
reflected, in part, the variation in knowledge and attitudes
toward DTC testing across professional disciplines and dis-
ease contexts. As such, future studies examining the down-
stream
implications
of
DNA
interpretation
on
the
healthcare system should consider the various professional
disciplines that may be impacted, given the likelihood that
consumers will share with multiple providers.
Overall, consumers were overwhelmingly happy with
their decision to use third-party raw DNA interpretation
services. Moreover, 81% reported being very satisfied or
satisfied with the interpretation results they received. Yet,
consumers also consistently reported challenges with report
interpretation irrespective of satisfaction. These challenges
are noteworthy and varied across companies to some extent
in the open-ended responses provided by consumers. As
such, qualitative responses highlight an area of concern
with results interpretation and communication that are not

Neuro-ophthalmologist
• He was intrigued that I found my own LHON mitochondrial mutation by exploring my raw data. He did
related testing and was able to figure out why my eyesight had gotten so bad. This disease had been
misdiagnosed in relatives for generations as MS or other things. The outcome has been very helpful
since now we have access to the correct kind of doctor, testing, information, patient resources, online
support group, research studies, etc., since I found my 11778 mutation. It is passed from a mother to all
children so this has been very important information for my three children and other maternal relatives.
Any doctors I had tried to discuss my genetic results with prior to that, including primary care, ophthal-
mologist, and geneticist were dismissive and not familiar enough with the testing.
Oncologist
• Not enough information on certain SNP variations to make clinical decisions yet.
Pain therapist
• Not much, I feel they don’t know what to do with the results yet. But the more people do this, the
[sooner doctors] will pay attention.
Multiple practitioners (more than one of those listed above) = 20/96, 21%
MD, GC
• Additional testing was done where I have high genetic risk coupled with relevant symptoms.
MD, GC
• Allowed me to get more medical testing due to mutations that can have an effect on my health.
MD, NP, GC
• The genetic counselor could have cared less. I was shocked by their reaction. Primary care seemed too
busy to care. Nurse Practitioner was by far the most knowledgeable and open to interpreting my DNA
results.
MD, NP, GC, Geneticist
• They thought it was bullsh*t [sic] until I showed exact matches to their clinical testing and 23andMe
results. The reasonable ones agreed that the testing was useful. I fired the unreasonable doctors!
MD, GC, Surgeon
• Through Promethease I learned I carry the BRCA1 mutation. I chose to have preventative surgeries.
MD, NP, GC, Naturopath
• Mixed, some just want to treat SNPS with way too many supplements that in my case have caused more
harm than good. Primary care doctor has no idea what to do with information. Tested was probably one
of the worst things I could have done. It’s very confusing, frustrating and expensive to find the right
treatment.
MD, Neurosurgeon,
Psychiatrist
• Psychiatrist was very interested. Resulted in getting a prescription to help with the condition caused by
a specific genetic polymorphism.
MD, NP, Psychiatrist,
Rheumatologist,
Dermatologist
• They had no idea what I was talking about. Made zero effort to refer me to a genetic counselor, which I
asked about many times. All it did is make me sound like a crazy mystic or Wiccan convinced that I
had some greater knowledge. Insulting and also, since when have doctors stopped believing in DNA?

 reflected in the quantitative ratings alone. Not surprising,
those who were more highly educated were also less satis-
fied with the raw DNA information, which may suggest
either that their information needs were not met, or that
they understood the limitations of the interpretation after
receiving the reports thus resulting in lower satisfaction.
Additional studies should examine the clarity, informative-
ness, and comprehension of the interpretation reports com-
municated by various third-party companies.
A strength of this study is the inclusion of quantitative
and qualitative analyses pertaining to study outcomes of
interest. There are, however, several limitations to this
study that should be noted. This study recruited participants
via social media through paid advertisements (Facebook/
Twitter) and posts on relevant discussion threads (Reddit)
and may favor attracting consumers who had more favor-
able experiences or are high information seekers who may
be likely to use more than one third-party service and share
results with multiple health professionals. As such, general-
izability of findings may be limited to some extent by the
potential selection bias in sampling. In addition, open-
ended responses were not required of all study participants
on the survey and thus likely understate the context and
detail
of
the
outcomes
of
sharing

• It appears rather accurate in at least my case.
• It was very thorough and accurate.
• Summaries were backed by scientific citations and were actually useful to me.
• The information has helped me to make better decisions for my own health. Additionally I feel better prepared to
contend with potential medical issues that may arise given the data and the correlation with my own family’s con-
firmed health issues.
• It’s peace of mind. I know what is in my genetics now I can keep an eye out for it. It helps me better understand
that I have certain risk factors and I can do what I can to mitigate them (where possible) or at least be aware of
them if I can’t do anything about them, so I can at least have treatment plans or an idea what to do next.
• It solved a problem that had puzzled two different doctors and they hadn’t been able to solve.
Satisfied
47%
• I am closer in solving my health issues.
• I am satisfied, but need more information to completely understand results.
• I would be very satisfied if I understood it more.
• It is good information but difficult to read.
• Not the easiest to navigate.
• Not sure how to read it.
• The information is a little detailed for the average person.
• Wish it would break it down more.
• I feel there is a lot of good information but I’m still feeling overwhelmed and a bit unclear about some of how
some of the tools work and how they would help me.
• Some of the services could improve their reporting clarity but the core services are helpful.
• It’s a bit hard to follow and some things contradict other things (e.g., One gene shows I should have brown eyes,
another shows I should have blue. I actually have blue.)
• While they gave me a lot of good information, there was so much of it because of the number of variants I had,
and it was presented in a way that was not easily accessible for even a well-educated layperson. I ended up paying
a dietitian to look at the raw data and write up a report for me, which she did for a reasonable fee. I then sat down
with one of her colleagues and discussed what it meant for me in real life.
Neither
14%
• Better tools needed.
• More confused than ever.
• The interface is a bit unfriendly and difficult to use.
• I haven’t been able to use it for answers.
• I don’t understand the information.
• Difficult to understand everything.
• Still don’t completely understand some of the information.
• They provided lots of information but it was beyond me to organize and interpret it myself.
• I think interfaces could be a little better, make it easier for the user.
• It’s a lot like astrology for the most part. I worry that most laypeople are going to be overinterpreting this stuff.
Nevertheless, extremely enjoyable to explore.
• Too much complex info & terms, not enough general explanation for the layman.
Unsatisfied or
very unsatisfied
5%
• I am frustrated that the raw DNA data is incomplete and politically filtered.
• It was not a complete report.
• Still a lot of technical data that is hard to decipher.
• Much of it is very limited and scattershot.

 practitioners. Additional efforts are needed to examine the
utility and impact of sharing DTC testing results with these
professionals.
In sum, consumers are overwhelmingly satisfied with
their decision to use third-party raw DNA interpretation
services, in spite of the challenges with understanding
interpretation results. Future efforts to ascertain consumer
comprehension of interpretation results and subsequent
interactions with medical professionals will facilitate a bet-
ter understanding of the downstream implications of these
online services.
