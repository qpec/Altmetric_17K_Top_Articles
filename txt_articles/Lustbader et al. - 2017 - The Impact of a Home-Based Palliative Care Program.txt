Abstract
Background: People with advanced illness usually want their healthcare where they live—at home—not in the
hospital. Innovative models of palliative care that better meet the needs of seriously ill people at lower cost
should be explored.
Objectives: We evaluated the impact of a home-based palliative care (HBPC) program implemented within an
Accountable Care Organization (ACO) on cost and resource utilization.
Methods: This was a retrospective analysis to quantify cost savings associated with a HBPC program in a
Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO where total cost of care is available. We studied 651 decedents; 82
enrolled in a HBPC program compared to 569 receiving usual care in three New York counties who died
between October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016. We also compared hospital admissions, ER visits, and hospice
utilization rates in the final months of life.
Results: The cost per patient during the final three months of life was $12,000 lower with HBPC than with usual
care ($20,420 vs. $32,420; p = 0.0002); largely driven by a 35% reduction in Medicare Part A ($16,892 vs.
$26,171; p = 0.0037). HBPC also resulted in a 37% reduction in Medicare Part B in the final three months of life
compared to usual care ($3,114 vs. $4,913; p = 0.0008). Hospital admissions were reduced by 34% in the final
month of life for patients enrolled in HBPC. The number of admissions per 1000 beneficiaries per year was
3073 with HBPC and 4640 with usual care ( p = 0.0221). HBPC resulted in a 35% increased hospice enrollment
rate ( p = 0.0005) and a 240% increased median hospice length of stay compared to usual care (34 days vs.
10 days; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: HBPC within an ACO was associated with significant cost savings, fewer hospitalizations, and
increased hospice use in the final months of life.
Introduction
T
he sickest 5% of patients in the United States account
for >50% of costs, with the largest portion spent in the
final months of life, generally for inpatient care.1 Over the
past decade, hospital-based palliative care teams have dem-
onstrated improved outcomes and cost savings.2–4 To date,
little has been reported on the economic impact of home-
based palliative care (HBPC) programs.5 Home-based care is
especially important since hospitals may accelerate func-
tional decline for those with advanced illness.6 Many patients
with chronic or terminal illness who might benefit from
palliative care are excluded from the Medicare Hospice
Benefit if they wish to continue certain medical treatments or
have a multitude of chronic conditions but no single certifi-
able hospice diagnosis.
We describe a nurse and social work model of HBPC in the
New York metropolitan area in the context of a Medicare

 Shared Savings Program (MSSP) Accountable Care Orga-
nization (ACO). The Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) selected 434 provider organizations to par-
ticipate in the MSSP, which serves 8 million beneficiaries
nationwide. Our objective was to evaluate the cost savings
and outcomes associated with HBPC in a Medicare fee for
service ACO population where high-value care is rewarded.
Clinical scenario
Mrs. M is an 87-year-old woman who lives alone in New
York. Her husband died 22 years ago and her two sons live in
California. She has advanced heart failure, renal insuffi-
ciency, atrial fibrillation, and spinal stenosis with three ER
visits and one hospital admission in the past 12 months. She
uses a walker with increasing difficulty leaving her home.
Mrs. M is in the ProHEALTH ACO but has not seen her
primary care doctor recently, although she does see her
cardiologist. She was identified as a high-risk patient from
ACO Medicare claims data, so a member of ProHEALTH
Care Support, a HBPC program, reached out to her. Upon
enrollment, a nurse made house calls and coordinated pri-
vate hire home health aides to assist her with bathing. Her
medications were simplified by the HBPC physician follow-
ing discussions with her other doctors from 16 pills to 6 pills
per day and the blood thinner was stopped due to recent falls.
Mrs. M is tired of calling 911 and going to the hospital for
shortness of breath and back pain where she feels ‘‘aban-
doned for hours in that dark ER hallway.’’ The HBPC team
started an opioid and bowel regimen to better manager her
back pain. They also prescribed medications to have on hand
for shortness of breath and provided medical guidance 24/7.
She has not been to the ER since enrolling in HBPC four
months ago.
Methods
HBPC program
ProHEALTH Care Support is a HBPC program within the
department of palliative care at ProHEALTH Care, a large
multispecialty physician practice with 900 providers in 200
locations throughout the New York metropolitan area, in-
cluding 30 urgent care centers. The medical group does not
own hospitals, home health agencies, or hospice programs
and is focused primarily on outpatient care. The practice
serves 1 million patients in a largely fee for service market.
ProHEALTH is part of OptumCare, a large national health-
care delivery organization. The HBPC program was devel-
oped to manage high-need patients within the MSSP ACO
Track 1 (e.g., shared savings only, no risk). Billing within an
ACO is the same as any fee for service market, but if savings
are generated compared to a baseline benchmark, the ACO
shares in that savings with Medicare as long as certain quality
indicators are achieved.
The HBPC team comprised six registered nurses, two so-
cial workers, two doctors, one data analyst, and three ad-
ministrative staff. The providers have strong clinical skills in
palliative care. Each nurse is responsible for 90 patients (from
the MSSP ACO and other shared savings health plans) in
collaboration with a social worker and palliative care phy-
sician. Each nurse makes about five home visits and five
phone calls per day. Most patients get at least one house call
and two telephone calls per month with additional outreach
from team members as needed. The team engages in serious
illness conversations about goals of care7 with patients over
time with documentation of treatment preferences (e.g.,
DNR, do not resuscitate orders) using the New York State
Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST)
form. There are twice-weekly in person team meetings and a
one-hour weekly one-to-one with the nurse, social worker,
and palliative care physician to review the nurse caseload in
detail. During these one-to-ones, the HBPC physician may
reach out to the patient’s other physicians to coordinate care
while keeping them informed.
Telepalliative care is an important component of this
program where patients and their caregivers may have a
virtual visit with any member of the team using their own
smart phone or laptop computer. About 20% of patients uti-
lize the telemedicine service. The nurses may also receive
physician support via telemedicine while in the patient’s
home. Patients have access to coverage 24/7 by telephone or
telemedicine to one of the program physicians. The program
also supports 12 volunteers who visit patients and are con-
sidered members of the palliative care team. Along with
being ‘‘good listeners,’’ those with specific expertise provide
Reiki therapy or play musical instruments for patients. The
volunteers are college students or members of the local
community and are trained by the social worker.
Patients eligible for the HBPC program include homebound
frail elders, patients with advanced heart failure, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, meta-
static cancer, or severe dementia. Patients are excluded if they
live in a skilled nursing facility or have addiction and behav-
ioral health issues. Eligible patients are identified with an al-
gorithm developed by the ACO using CMS medical claims
data (e.g., costliest 5%, Hierarchical Condition Categories,
two hospital admissions or ER visits in prior 12 months, the
ordering of a hospital bed, walker, or home oxygen). The
primary care physician is notified that their patient is eligible
for HBPC and they may opt out; this occurs in <5% of cases.
Patients are contacted by phone for program enrollment and
further screened during the initial nurse home visit. Patients
sign consent forHBPC andno onerefused program enrollment
during this study period. This HBPC program provides many
elements of traditional home-based primary care and case
management programs such as nurse home visits, but differs in
the provision of 24/7 coverage, team-based care, use of tele-
medicine, and specialty level palliative care.8–11
Patient identification
There are 28,566 MSSP ACO patients at ProHEALTH
located primarily in the five boroughs of New York City and
Long Island. For this study population, only patients living in
Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk Counties with 12 months of
continuous Medicare claims data before death were included.
This study included 651 MSSP ACO patients who died be-
tween October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016. There were 82
decedents enrolled in HBPC compared to 569 who died with
usual care (Table 1). Both groups comprised 98% fee for
service Medicare and 2% dual eligible with Medicaid. Al-
though the HBPC team cared for 975 patients from the MSSP
ACO and other health plans during this period, only the 82
MSSP ACO decedents were included in this study.

 Measures
Total Medicare Part A (inpatient hospital, emergency
room, hospice, home health services), Part B (outpatient,
medical), and Part D (pharmaceutical) costs, resource utili-
zation, and patient demographic and clinical data were col-
lected for all patients who died during this 18-month study
period. Total cost of care, ER utilization, hospital admission
rate, hospice utilization, and length of stay (LOS) were
quantified. Total care costs were defined as the sum of
Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims. A Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI) was used to evaluate disease burden and mor-
tality risk. The CCI was calculated for each patient from the
Medicare claims data designating a point value for each of 22
conditions obtained from ICD-10 codes.12
Statistical analyses
For comparing patient cost differences between those
enrolled in HBPC versus usual care, a two-sample Welch t
test was used as the primary comparisons test. A square root
transformation was applied to patient cost, to account for
skewness and fulfilling the assumption that the analyzed
data follow a normal distribution pattern. Patient cost data
are commonly positive or right skewed. The Welch t test is
used for data that are unpaired, where two populations have
unequal sample sizes and variance. Median cost metrics
were also compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This
is a nonparametric standard test for comparing metrics,
where those metrics are not required to be derived from a
particular distribution, like a normal distribution. This ap-
proach is commonly used to compare measures such as
medians.
The Z-test of proportions was used for comparing rates
between two groups, and if that difference is statistical sig-
nificance. This approach can be used with sample sizes that
are reasonably large, where rate data are believed to converge
to a normal distribution. This test was used to compare the
rate metric of hospice utilization.
Results
Cost per patient for Medicare parts A, B, and D in the final
year of life was $10,435 lower for those receiving HBPC
compared to usual care (Fig. 1). The cost per patient during
the final three months of life was $12,000 lower with HBPC
than for usual care ($20,420 vs. $32,420; p = 0.0002); largely
driven by a 35% reduction in Medicare Part A with HBPC
compared to controls ($16,892 vs. $26,171; p = 0.0037).
HBPC also resulted in a 37% reduction in Medicare Part B
cost during the final three months of life compared to usual
care ($3,114 vs. $4913; p = 0.0008). There was no significant
difference in Medicare Part D (pharmaceuticals) cost be-
tween the two groups (Table 2).
Hospital admissions were reduced by 34% in the final
month of life for patients enrolled in HBPC. The number of
admissions per 1000 beneficiaries per year was 3073 with
HBPC and 4640 with usual care ( p = 0.0221). HBPC was also
associated with a trend toward reduced ER visits per 1000
beneficiaries compared to usual care, 878 vs. 1097. HBPC
resulted in a 35% increase ( p = 0.0005) in hospice utilization
rate and a significantly longer median hospice LOS compared
to controls (34 days vs. 10 days; p < 0.0001). Mean hospice
LOS was also longer in the HBPC group compared to con-
trols (47 days vs. 23 days; p = 0.0003) (Table 3).
Discussion
HBPC was associated with significant reductions in total
Medicare cost, fewer hospital admissions, and an increase in
hospice utilization in the final months of life. There was a
45% reduction in cost for the final month of life with HBPC.
These results are likely due, in part, to the fact that HBPC was
also associated with a very high likelihood of death at home
(87%). This is an especially important outcome measure
since nationally only 24% of Medicare beneficiaries die at
home with usual care.13
The return on investment for HBPC depends on financial
alignmentwith payersandproviders; a unique opportunity that
occurs within an ACO where high-value care, rather than care
intensity, is financially rewarded. CMSannouncedthat 50%of
payment will be value based by the end of 2018.14 Other
payer–provider partnerships have already noticed the value
proposition for HBPC and developed programs of their own.15

HOME-BASED PALLIATIVE CARE
25
 A Cochrane review16 evaluated the cost savings of HBPC
for people with advanced illness. On the basis of 23 studies,
including 37,561 patients and 4042 family caregivers, when a
patient receives HBPC, the chances of dying at home more
than doubles. This Cochrane review identified only six
studies addressing cost-effectiveness of HBPC, with two
showing cost savings. One such prospective randomized trial
of 52 patients with multiple sclerosis in London demonstrated
a significant cost reduction within 12 weeks postenroll-
ment.17
Some HBPC programs have demonstrated value with the
formation of payer–provider partnerships.18 Kerr et al.
showed a $6,804 PMPM cost of care with HBPC versus
$10,712 for usual care in the final three months of life. Their
HBPC program was implemented through a hospice program
and commercial insurance provider in New York.19 At one
month before death, the PMPM cost was $7,170 for HBPC
recipients compared to $13,440 for controls. This program
also demonstrated increased hospice enrollment (70% vs.
25%) and longer median hospice LOS (34 days vs. 9 days)
compared to usual care.
The Sutter Health Advanced Illness (AIM) Program20 is a
HBPC program in northern California that enrolled patients
with a prognosis of less than one year who met Medicare
eligibility criteria for home health and were continuing
treatment for their illness. Patients enrolled in this program
had 63% fewer hospitalizations compared to pre-enrollment.
The associated cost savings was estimated to be $2,000
PMPM. A Kaiser Permanente HBPC program for cancer,
heart failure, or COPD patients delivered in health mainte-
nance organizations in Hawaii and Colorado demonstrated
improved patient satisfaction, increased likelihood of dying
at home, and a 33% overall cost savings.21 The OACIS
program in Pennsylvania demonstrated fewer hospital ad-
missions and a lower 30-day readmission rate with their
HBPC program but no impact on ER visits.22
Key elements of successful programs appear to be home-
based care, in person interactions, geriatric assessment,
caregiver support, palliative care skills, and round the clock
clinical availability. The remote delivery of telephone-only
care coordination has demonstrated modest success. A nurse
practitioner once a year in home visit program delivered by a
health plan demonstrated a 14% reduction in hospital

 admissions in a Medicare population, largely through in-
creased hospice referrals.23 Another program using tele-
phonic advance care planning for Medicare Advantage
members demonstrated a cost savings of $13,956 per dece-
dent in the final six months of life compared to controls.24
Improving value by increasing quality and reducing cost is
one ofthe goals ofACOs.25Failure orlatereferralofterminally
ill patients to hospice results in costly care that is often dis-
cordant with patient preferences. Physician factors, rather than
patient preferences, correlate most with hospice referral rate.26
Our HBPC program achieved an 87% at home death rate
through timely referral to hospice for eligible patients and
homepalliativecareforthosepatientswhodeclinedenrollment
ordeemedineligiblefor hospice careduetoongoingtreatments
or lack of a hospice diagnosis. In our study, 57% of decedents
were referred to hospice. Unlike a Medicare Advantage pro-
gram, costs incurred during hospice care are included in
Medicare Part A and attributed to the MSSP ACO total cost of
care. Despite the inclusion of hospice care, these services cost
significantly less than usual care, which often results in un-
wanted hospitalizations. One study noted a cost reduction of
$6,430 per patient enrolled in hospice care for 15 to 30 days.27
Clinical scenario
Mrs. M wants to stay in her home. She has hired private
home health aides to assist her. There is a plan for the
treatment of her heart failure and shortness of breath should
things get worse. A MOLST form stating her two preferences
(i.e., DNR and no future hospitalization) is tucked away in a
white envelope taped to the side of the refrigerator. She no
longer takes 16 pills a day. She knows in the future she could
transition to a hospice program if she becomes eligible. When
she calls the HBPC 24/7 number, she knows someone will
answer the phone. They will not say ‘‘If this is an emergency,
go to your nearest emergency room.’’
One limitation of this study is the lack of minority popu-
lations and Medicaid. Another limitation is the lack of a case
matched control group, although the CCI was used to quan-
tify disease burden, which was equal for both groups
( p = 0.4321). In addition, all patients in both groups had fee
for service Medicare, died during the same 18-month study
period, used the same ACO physicians, and lived in Queens,
Nassau, or Suffolk Counties in New York. There was no
difference in race, age, or gender between groups.
CMS provides all beneficiary claims data and ICD-10
codes to MSSP ACOs. Identifying patients likely to benefit
from HBPC based on historical claims is challenging since
spending patterns are variable and do not reliably predict
palliative care needs.28 Predictors of palliative care need may
include prognosis of less than one year, frailty, functional
decline, and social isolation, which are not readily available
through claims. Our claim-based algorithm appears to cor-
rectly identify a cohort of beneficiaries with a 57% risk of
death within six months; however, we were unable to serve
them all due to staffing limitations. In fact, only 13% of the
MSSP ACO decedents were enrolled in HBPC. The mean
LOS in HBPC was 109 days leading us to wonder if even
better outcomes might result from earlier enrollment. These
positive findings are fueling additional growth with the hiring
of new staff to better meet the palliative needs of all our
seriously ill ACO patients.
The Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays
Part A benefits, is expected to run out by 2028.29 The Trust
Fund is financed primarily through payroll tax. As more baby
boomers reach Medicare eligibility age, a declining work-
force will be making payroll contributions to the Fund. Trust
Fund solvency depends on reducing healthcare costs. We
showed that average Part A cost per decedent was $9,279
lower with HBPC compared to usual care. Providing access to
palliative care to the sickest 2% of the 55.3 million Medicare
beneficiaries in the United States could result in better out-
comes at substantially lower cost. New reimbursement
models are required for reliable team-based, technology-
enhanced models of HBPC. The perfect alignment of quality
and financial outcomes in an ACO provides a unique op-
portunity to support HBPC.
