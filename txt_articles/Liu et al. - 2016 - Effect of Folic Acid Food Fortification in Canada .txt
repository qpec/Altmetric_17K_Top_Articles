BACKGROUND: Previous studies have yielded inconsistent results for the 
effects of periconceptional multivitamins containing folic acid and of folic 
acid food fortification on congenital heart defects (CHDs).
METHODS: We carried out a population-based cohort study (N=5 
901 
701) 
of all live births and stillbirths (including late-pregnancy terminations) 
delivered at ≥20 weeks’ gestation in Canada (except Québec and Manitoba) 
from 1990 to 2011. CHD cases were diagnosed at birth and in infancy 
(n=72 
591). We compared prevalence rates and temporal trends in CHD 
subtypes before and after 1998 (the year that fortification was mandated). 
An ecological study based on 22 calendar years, 14 geographic areas, 
and Poisson regression analysis was used to quantify the effect of folic 
acid food fortification on nonchromosomal CHD subtypes (n=66 
980) after 
controlling for changes in maternal age, prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, 
preterm preeclampsia, multiple birth, and termination of pregnancy.
RESULTS: The overall birth prevalence rate of CHDs was 12.3 per 1000 
total births. Rates of most CHD subtypes decreased between 1990 and 
2011 except for atrial septal defects, which increased significantly. Folic 
acid food fortification was associated with lower rates of conotruncal 
defects (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.62–0.85), coarctation of the aorta (aRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61–0.96), 
ventricular septal defects (aRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75–0.96), and atrial septal 
defects (aRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.95) but not severe nonconotruncal 
heart defects (aRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.03) and other heart or 
circulatory system abnormalities (aRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89–1.11).
CONCLUSIONS: The association between food fortification with folic acid 
and a reduction in the birth prevalence of specific CHDs provides modest 
evidence for additional benefit from this intervention.

ongenital heart defects (CHDs) affect ≈1% of new-
borns and account for approximately one-third of 
infant deaths associated with congenital anoma-
lies.1–5 Despite extensive investigation into potential 
causes and risk factors, only a small percentage of 
cases (15%) have been definitively linked to a known 
cause.6–8 One intervention with potential for preventing 
CHDs is periconceptional folic acid supplementation.9–17 
Analysis of secondary outcomes in a Hungarian random-
ized trial showed that the birth prevalence of congenital 
cardiovascular anomalies was reduced among women 
offered periconceptional multivitamin (including folic 
acid) and trace element supplementation compared with 
women offered supplemental trace elements only.9–11 
However, nonexperimental studies have yielded incon-
sistent results for the effectiveness of periconceptional 
multivitamins containing folic acid and of folic acid fortifi-
cation on the birth prevalence of CHDs.14–23
Folic acid fortification of all types of flour, enriched 
pasta, and cornmeal became mandatory in Canada in 
November 1998. Previous studies from Canada have 
shown that food fortification with folic acid has resulted 
in a substantial reduction in the birth prevalence of neural 
tube defects.24,25 Such fortification also has been associ-
ated with a reduction in the birth prevalence of severe 
conotruncal CHDs but not of other less severe types of 
CHDs.18 However, these assessments of the effect of fo-
lic acid food fortification and periconceptional folic acid 
supplements did not adequately account for simultane-
ous changes in other known risk factors for CHDs.5–8,26–29 
Therefore, we carried out a study to assess the effect of 
folic acid food fortification on CHDs using a design that 
accounted for temporal changes in older maternal age, 
prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, preterm preeclampsia, 
multiple birth, and prenatal diagnosis of and pregnancy 
termination for lethal congenital anomalies.

Study Population
The study was based on hospital separation records obtained 
from the Discharge Abstract Database of the Canadian Institute 
for Health Information for 1990 to 2011. This database cap-
tures information from all hospitals in Canada (excluding 
Québec) and includes ≈98% of live births and stillbirths (ie, 
fetal deaths delivered at ≥20 weeks of gestation or ≥500-g 
birth weight).5,30 Information in the database includes maternal 
characteristics and postal code of residence, infant sex, birth 
weight, gestation, most responsible diagnosis, secondary and 
other diagnoses, and procedures performed during the hospi-
talization. Data for the province of Manitoba, which were not 
fully captured until 2003, were excluded from the study.
Case Ascertainment and Classification of CHDs
Up to fiscal year 2000 to 2001, diagnoses in the Discharge 
Abstract Database were coded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), with the 
Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of 
Diseases and Related Health Problems for Diagnoses (ICD-10) 
being adopted by Canadian hospitals in 2001 to 2002. The 
validity of information in the Discharge Abstract Database is 
assessed continually through abstraction and other studies.30,31 
These studies show that the diagnosis of CHDs is accurate and 
that the transition of the coding system from ICD-9 to ICD-10 
did not materially affect the coding of CHDs.5,18,28
CHDs among all live births, stillbirths (including pregnancy 
terminations), and infants readmitted in the first year after 
birth were ascertained by the use of ICD-9 codes for diagno-
ses from 1990 to 2001 to 2002 (745.0–747.9), after which 
ICD-10 codes (Q20.0–Q26.9) were used. All CHD cases were 
then classified into the following 6 categories by grouping ICD 
codes in hierarchical fashion, as previously proposed4–6,8,18: (1) 
conotruncal defects consisting of common truncus (745.0/
Q20.0 and Q21.4), transposition of great vessels (745.1/
Q20.1-Q20.3 and Q20.5), and tetralogy of Fallot (745.2/
Q21.3); (2) nonconotruncal defects including endocardial cush-
ion defects (745.6/Q21.2), common ventricle (745.3/Q20.4), 
and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (746.7/Q23.4); (3) coarc-
tation of the aorta (747.1/Q25.1); (4) ventricular septal defect 
(745.4/Q21.0 and Q21.8); (5) atrial septal defect (745.5/
Q21.1), and (6) other heart and circulatory system anoma-
lies (ie, ICD codes for CHDs excluding the above-mentioned 
5 categories). The first 3 categories made up the severe CHD 
Clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Food fortification with folic acid, mandated in Can-
ada in 1998, was aimed primarily at preventing neu-
ral tube defects, and its effect on congenital heart 
defects (CHDs) remains controversial.
• We studied ≈6 million Canadian births from 1990 
to 2011 to quantify the effects of folic acid food 
fortification on the birth prevalence of specific non-
chromosomal CHD subtypes after controlling for 
concomitant changes in maternal age, prepreg-
nancy diabetes mellitus, preterm preeclampsia, 
multiple birth, and pregnancy termination.
What Are the Clinical implications?
• Overall, there was an 11% reduction in nonchromo-
somal CHDs after folic acid food fortification.
• Specifically, folic acid food fortification was associ-
ated with a 27% (95% confidence interval, 15–38) 
reduction in conotruncal defects, a 23% (95% con-
fidence interval, 4–39) reduction in coarctation of 
the aorta, a 15% (95% confidence interval, 4–25) 
reduction in ventricular septal defects, and an 18% 
(95% confidence interval, 5–31) reduction in atrial 
septal defects. These effects were also seen when 
analyses were restricted to isolated CHD cases.
• Our ecological study provides modest evidence of 
a protective effect of folic acid food fortification 
on CHDs.

subtypes. Pregnancy terminations resulting from congenital 
anomalies were included among stillbirths, although they could 
not be identified separately until 1997 in our data source.
Food fortification with folic acid was the intervention of 
interest, and births from January 1999 on were considered 
exposed to this intervention. This time point was chosen for 
demarcating the onset of food fortification with folic acid 
because mandatory food fortification with folic acid began in 
November 1998. However, many food producers began fortifi-
cation with folic acid well before the mandatory period.18,24,25,32
Statistical Analysis
We first assessed temporal trends in the birth prevalence of 
all CHDs by specific CHD subtypes. Analyses also were car-
ried out among CHD cases not associated with a chromosomal 
anomaly and among CHD cases associated with a chromo-
somal anomaly to delineate potential differences among CHD 
cases with a genetic pathogenesis.6,7,21,33 Our assessment of 
the effect of folic acid food fortification was designed as an 
ecological Poisson regression analysis with spatiotemporal 
variations in the incidence of specific CHD subtypes between 
1990 and 2011 described as a function of maternal age, pre-
pregnancy diabetes mellitus, preterm preeclampsia, multiple 
birth, termination of pregnancy, and folic acid food fortifica-
tion. Food fortification with folic acid was represented in the 
model using a dichotomous variable (0 for the prefortification 
period, 1 for postfortification period).34,35 The maternal age 
distribution was modeled using the proportion of women with 
a maternal age of <20, 20 to 24, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and 
≥40 years. The rates of prepregnancy diabetes mellitus and 
multiple birth were modeled per 1000 total births. The rate 
of pregnancy termination for congenital anomalies was esti-
mated with the use of a proxy variable, namely the rate of still-
births with known birth weight <500 g per 1000 total births. 
This proxy variable includes a substantial and increasing frac-
tion of late-pregnancy terminations for prenatally diagnosed 
congenital anomalies.5,26,27,36,37 Data were stratified accord-
ing to geographic area of maternal residence (14 strata: 5 
regions in Ontario; 2 in Alberta; 2 in British Columbia; 1 for 
Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland each; 1 for 
Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined; and 1 for 
the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut combined) and 
year (9 strata from 1990–1998, 13 strata from 1999–2011), 
resulting in 126 strata for the prefortification period and 182 
strata for the post–food fortification period. Goodness of fit 
of the Poisson regression model was assessed with deviance 
statistics and the Pearson χ2 test, and variance estimates were 
corrected for overdispersion through appropriate scaling.
In secondary analyses, we examined the effect of folic 
acid fortification on the basis of isolated CHD subtypes (ie, 
excluding CHD cases with other congenital anomalies5). These 
analyses were carried out because we suspected that women 
whose fetuses had multiple congenital anomalies would be 
more likely to have a pregnancy termination and because other 
congenital anomalies such as neural tube defects and orofacial 
clefts are known to be affected by maternal multivitamin use or 
folic acid food fortification.13–15,38 All the above analyses were 
done with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
In other analyses, we used Joinpoint regression (also known 
as change point analysis), which detects points of deviation 
(joinpoints) from a linear slope, to assess temporal patterns.38,39 
This analytic approach was used to identify the time point when 
CHD birth prevalence began to change. The regression identi-
fies significant change points by performing several permuta-
tion tests and assessing these in terms of goodness of fit. 
We used the National Cancer Institute’s Joinpoint Regression 
Program version 4.3.0.0 for the crude and fully adjusted rates 
of conotruncal defects from 1990 to 2011.40
This study was carried out by the Public Health Agency of 
Canada, which has a federal mandate to monitor the health 
of the Canadian population. The data source involved denomi-
nalized information from all hospitals in Canada (excluding 
Québec); therefore, institutional review board approval was not 
required.
rESultS
Between 1990 and 2011, the Canadian hospitalization 
database recorded 5 
901 
701 total births, with 72 
591 
CHD cases identified among stillbirths (8.6%), live births 
during the childbirth admission (69.7%), or infants during 
subsequent hospital readmissions (21.7%). The overall 
birth prevalence of CHDs was 12.3 per 1000 total births. 
Among all CHDs, 20% were severe CHD subtypes, and 
ventricular and atrial septal heart defects accounted for 
nearly half of the cases (47.5%; Table 1).
Overall, the prevalence of CHDs declined over the 22 
years of the study, with rates of most CHD subtypes, 
including conotruncal heart defects, decreasing signifi-
cantly, but rates of atrial septal defects increased sub-
stantially. Specifically, rates of conotruncal heart defects 
decreased from 13.1 per 10 
000 total births in 1990 
to 10.1 per 10 
000 total births in 2011. On the other 
hand, rates of atrial septal defects increased from 18.7 
per 10 
000 total births in 1990 to 33.2 per 10 
000 to-
tal births in 2011 (Figure). Rates of older maternal age, 
prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, preterm preeclampsia, 
multiple birth, and pregnancy termination all increased 
from 1990 to 2011 (Figures I and II in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Table 2 shows results of 3 Poisson regression models 
for conotruncal defect, atrial septal defect, and chromo-
somal anomaly–associated CHDs. The unadjusted rate 
ratio expressing the association between food fortifica-
tion with folic acid and conotruncal defects was 0.78 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.84); adjustment 
for other covariates strengthened this inverse associa-
tion slightly (rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62–0.85). The 
association between folic acid food fortification and 
atrial septal defects changed substantially after adjust-
ment for other covariates (crude rate ratio, 1.21; 95% 
CI, 1.11–1.31; adjusted rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–
0.95; Table 2). The reversal in the effect of folic acid 
food fortification on atrial septal defects was due almost 
entirely to adjustment for maternal age (rate ratio for fo-
lic acid food fortification adjusted for maternal age only, 
0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94). Adjustment for maternal age

had a far less dramatic influence on the association with 
other CHD subtypes. Rates of both conotruncal defects 
and atrial septal defects were positively and significantly 
associated with the rates of preterm preeclampsia and 
prepregnancy diabetes mellitus in adjusted models. 
Chromosomal anomaly–associated CHDs were not as-
sociated with folic acid food fortification (adjusted rate 
ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82–1.14).
Table 3 summarizes the results of Poisson regression 
for the 6 specific subtypes of CHDs and for all nonchro-
mosomal CHDs combined, presenting both the unadjust-
ed and adjusted associations between food fortification 
with folic acid and each CHD subtype. The unadjusted 
inverse associations were all statistically significant ex-
cept for the nonsignificant association with severe non-
conotruncal defects and the association between food 
fortification with folic acid and atrial septal defects, 
which was positive and statistically significant. Adjust-
ment for maternal age, prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, 
preterm preeclampsia, multiple birth, and pregnancy ter-
mination showed that folic acid fortification was signifi-
cantly and negatively associated with conotruncal heart 
defects, coarctation of the aorta, ventricular septal de-
fects, and atrial septal defects but not nonconotruncal 
heart defects and other heart and circulatory system 
anomalies. Folic acid food fortification was associated 
with significantly lower rates of coarctation of the aorta

which were 18% and 15% lower, respectively. Overall, 
food fortification with folic acid was associated with a 
significant 11% (95% CI, 2–18) reduction in nonchromo-
somal CHDs.
Secondary analyses based on isolated CHDs (ie, ex-
cluding 12.9% of CHDs that were associated with non-
cardiac defects) also showed that folic acid food for-
tification was inversely associated with CHD subtypes. 
Rate ratios from these regression analyses expressing 
the effect of folic acid food fortification on isolated CHD 
subtypes (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement) 
were not significantly different from the rate ratios in the 
primary analyses.
Crude Joinpoint analysis of rates of conotruncal de-
fects (excluding cases with chromosomal anomalies) by 
year showed no change points (Figure IIIa in the online-
only Data Supplement). However, the adjusted analysis 
showed that rates of conotruncal defects significantly 
declined by 8.2% (95% CI, 5.3–11.0) per annum from 
1996 through 2003, after which the rate of decline 
slowed (Figure IIIb in the online-only Data Supplement).

Our population-based study showed an inverse asso-
ciation between food fortification with folic acid and 
the overall birth prevalence of CHDs. The associations 
between folic acid food fortification and specific CHD 
subtypes varied, with relatively large reductions in the 
frequency of conotruncal defects and coarctation of the 
aorta, modest reductions in ventricular and atrial septal 
defects, and no change in nonconotruncal heart defects 
or other anomalies of the heart and circulatory system.

acid on each specific subtype of CHDs was similar in pri-
mary analyses involving all CHD cases and in secondary 
analyses restricted to isolated CHDs. This concordance 
provides further assurance that the estimated effect of 
folic acid food fortification excluded the influence of tem-
poral increases in pregnancy termination for prenatally 
diagnosed CHDs, given the assumption that termination 
of pregnancy might occur more often in those cases 
with multiple anomalies.
The temporal trends in each congenital heart disease 
subtype showed a declining pattern, and unadjusted as-
sociations between folic acid food fortification and con-
genital heart disease subtypes were all protective except 
for atrial septal defects. Atrial septal defects increased 
over time, and the unadjusted rate ratio expressing the 
association between folic acid food fortification and 
atrial septal defects was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.11–1.31); 
however, adjustment for covariates, especially maternal 
age, changed the relationship between folic acid food 
fortification and atrial septal defects (adjusted rate ra-
tio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.95). Prepregnancy diabetes 
mellitus and older maternal age are well-known risk fac-
tors for atrial septal defects.7,8 Preterm preeclampsia 
was also associated with CHDs, as has recently been 
reported.28,29
Several studies support a preventive role for folic 
acid in the occurrence of CHDs. A Hungarian study9,10 
showed a 43% reduction in CHDs, whereas a population-
based study from Atlanta14 showed a 24% reduction, 
albeit for multivitamin supplements including folic acid. 
The largest effects in these studies were seen in con-
nection with ventricular septal defects and conotruncal 
heart defects. Similar reductions in CHDs after food for-
tification with folic acid have also been observed in stud-
ies from the Netherlands and Québec.18,20
Our Poisson regression models estimated the ef-
fect of food fortification with folic acid on CHDs, as-
suming an effect beginning in 1999. However, the 
temporal pattern of reduction in the birth prevalence 
of conotruncal defects in the Joinpoint analyses was 
consistent with an effect beginning in 1996. Although 
this effect preceded the point when food fortification 
with folic acid became mandatory, it coincided with 
the period when food fortified with folic acid became 
available in Canada. The United States announced 
in February 1996 that folic acid fortification of food 
would become mandatory as of January 1, 1998, and 
after this announcement, such fortification of food 
with folic acid became permissible but not yet manda-
tory in Canada. White wheat flour, enriched pasta, and 
cornmeal products fortified with folic acid at the same 
levels as in the United States were sold in Canada 
well before 1998,18,24,25,32,41,42 and this was reflected 
in increases in blood levels of folic acid in the Cana-
dian population well before food fortification became 
mandatory.25,32
In our study, determinants other than food fortifica-
tion with folic acid were also associated with CHDs; 
expected positive associations were noted between 
CHDs and both prepregnancy diabetes mellitus and 
preterm preeclampsia. Unexpectedly, we did not ob-
serve an association between multiple birth43 and 
conotruncal defects or between pregnancy termination 
and conotruncal defects, the latter perhaps a conse-
quence of our use of stillbirths <500-g birth weight as a 
proxy for pregnancy terminations. This proxy, although

CHD indicates congenital heart defects; and CI, confidence interval. The rate ratio expresses the effect of food fortification with folic acid. Independent 
variables in each of the adjusted models included food fortification with folic acid (yes/no) and the multiple birth, termination of pregnancy, prepregnancy 
diabetes, and preeclampsia rates (all per 1000 total births), as well as the proportion of women with a maternal age of <20, 20 to 24, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 
and ≥40 years.
*Goodness of fit of the Poisson regression model was assessed with deviance statistics and the Pearson χ2, and variance estimates were corrected for 
overdispersion through appropriate scaling.

a reasonable option for modeling late-pregnancy ter-
minations (because stillbirths ≥20 weeks and <500 g 
have increased substantially in recent years5,26,27,36,37), 
cannot take into account early-pregnancy terminations. 
Another unexpected finding was the continued reduc-
tion in CHDs such as conotruncal defects for several 
years after the initiation of food fortification with folic 
acid. However, CHDs seem less folate sensitive than 
neural tube defects and may have required a longer pe-
riod before population red blood cell folate levels rose 
to a level at which reductions in incidence were fully 
realized.
The underlying mechanism for the possible preven-
tive effect of folic acid supplementation on CHDs has 
been explored for years. Studies show that both infant 
and maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphisms contrib-
ute to the risk of CHDs and that periconceptional folic 
acid supplementation reduces the risk of CHDs asso-
ciated with maternal MTHFR C677T and related poly-
morphisms.44 Recent studies also suggest that folic 
acid may influence the pathogenesis of CHDs through 
other more complex pathways, including epigenetic 
mechanisms that are responsible for transgenerational 
effects.45 A possible implication of epigenetic mecha-
nisms is that a beneficial effect of folic acid fortification 
in reducing the prevalence at birth of CHDs may take >1 
generation to become fully apparent.45
The strengths of our study include its size, popula-
tion-based provenance, and long (22 years) period of 
observation. CHD cases in our study included those 
diagnosed at birth and infants hospitalized in the year 
after birth. We used a pathogenesis-based grouping of 
CHDs6,8,18 rather than a severity-based grouping,21 which 
may have helped to better identify CHD subtypes ame-
nable to prevention through folic acid food fortification.
The limitations of our study include an inability to as-
sess the effects of temporal increases in supplementa-
tion with folic acid and multivitamins. Other limitations 
include potential deficiencies with our data source and 
the ecological design of our study (Both folic acid food 
fortification and CHDs were assessed in population 
groups, not individuals). This design is susceptible to 
confounding at both the ecological and individual lev-
els. However, the consistency in results between the 
primary and secondary analyses, which examined non-
chromosomal, chromosomal anomaly–associated, and 
isolated CHDs separately, and adjustment for various 
risk factors for CHDs provide assurance for the valid-
ity of the estimated effectiveness of food fortification 
with folic acid. We were not able to model the effects 
of maternal smoking and obesity because complete 
information on these risk factors was not available in 
our data source. According to the Canadian Community 
Health Survey, the prevalence of smoking among preg-
nant women declined by ≈25% between 1993 to 1996 
and 2009 to 2010.25,46
COnCluSiOnS
Our study shows associations between food fortification 
with folic acid and reductions in the birth prevalence of 
specific CHD subtypes. The associations were stronger 
for conotruncal defects and coarctation of the aorta and 
more modest for septal defects. Older maternal age, 
prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, and preterm preeclamp-
sia were also associated with population rates of CHDs. 
Although food fortification with folic acid was aimed pri-
marily at reducing neural tube defects, this population-
based intervention may also have had a beneficial effect 
on specific types of CHDs, which in aggregate are more 
common.
