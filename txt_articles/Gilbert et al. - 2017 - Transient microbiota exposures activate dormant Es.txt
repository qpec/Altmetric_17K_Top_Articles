Abstract
Pathogens often inhabit the body asymptomatically, emerging to cause disease in response
to unknown triggers. In the bladder, latent intracellular Escherichia coli reservoirs are
regarded as likely origins of recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI), a problem affecting mil-
lions of women worldwide. However, clinically plausible triggers that activate these reser-
voirs are unknown. Clinical studies suggest that the composition of a woman’s vaginal
microbiota influences her susceptibility to rUTI, but the mechanisms behind these associa-
tions are unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that the urinary tract is routinely
exposed to vaginal bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, a dominant member of the vag-
inal microbiota in some women. Using a mouse model, we show that bladder exposure to G.
vaginalis triggers E. coli egress from latent bladder reservoirs and enhances the potential
for life-threatening outcomes of the resulting E. coli rUTI. Transient G. vaginalis exposures
were sufficient to cause bladder epithelial apoptosis and exfoliation and interleukin-1-recep-
tor-mediated kidney injury, which persisted after G. vaginalis clearance from the urinary
tract. These results support a broader view of UTI pathogenesis in which disease can be
driven by short-lived but powerful urinary tract exposures to vaginal bacteria that are them-
selves not “uropathogenic” in the classic sense. This “covert pathogenesis” paradigm may
apply to other latent infections, (e.g., tuberculosis), or for diseases currently defined as non-
infectious because routine culture fails to detect microbes of recognized significance.
Author summary
Millions of women suffer from recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) and the only
treatment option is prophylactic antibiotics, which contributes to antibiotic resistance. In
experimental models, Escherichia coli, the dominant UTI pathogen, establishes reservoirs
inside the bladder lining; it is believed that some cases of rUTI in women may be due to

 these reservoirs awakening in response to triggers that are still unknown. Here we present
a new mouse model that demonstrates the first clinically plausible trigger of rUTI arising
from these reservoirs. Specifically, we show that bladder exposure to Gardnerella vaginalis,
a common member of the vaginal microbial community, can drive the emergence of E.
coli from bladder reservoirs. Furthermore, upon its exposure to the urinary tract, this vagi-
nal organism caused severe kidney damage and other complications, suggesting that car-
riage of particular vaginal bacteria could also impact a woman’s risk for kidney infection.
Bladder exposure to G. vaginalis is likely to occur during sexual activity in many women.
Taken together, these data provide the first explanation for why certain characteristics of
the vaginal microbiota have been linked with rUTI. Finally, our findings suggest that tar-

rUTI.
Introduction
Many disease-causing microorganisms can inhabit the human body asymptomatically, but fac-
tors that activate potentially pathogenic reservoirs to cause disease are not well understood.
After an initial infection, some pathogens establish states of latency that can reactivate to cause
recurrent symptomatic infections. In such cases, the problems lie not in diagnosing the recur-
rent infection, but rather in identifying and preventing potential triggers of reactivation and
predicting which patients are at risk for developing severe manifestations of disease. An
important example of bacterial latency and reactivation is bladder infection (cystitis), which
has the potential to develop into life-threatening kidney and systemic disease [1–4]. The blad-
der is one of the most common sites of infection in humans, and urinary tract infections
(UTIs) are one of the primary reasons for clinical use of antibiotics, accounting for 9% of all
antibiotic use in an ambulatory care setting [5,6]. UTIs also often recur; 25% of women
afflicted with acute UTI experience a recurrence within six months, and an estimated 1% of
women (70 million worldwide) suffer more than six recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) each year [6].
Infection is most often caused by uropathogenic E. coli, which can establish intracellular, anti-
biotic-resistant bladder reservoirs in mouse models [1–3,6,7]. In humans, episodes of rUTI are
often caused by the same strain of E. coli as the initial infection (~50% of cases according to
whole genome sequencing and up to 82% of cases by less stringent criteria) [8]. While rUTI
sometimes occurs due to reinfection of the bladder by E. coli residing in external sites (gastro-
intestinal tract, vagina), bladder intracellular E. coli reservoirs are regarded as another likely
source of rUTI in humans [2–4,8–10]. However, clinically plausible triggers of the transition
from latent bladder reservoirs to rUTI have not been identified.
Several lines of evidence implicate the vaginal microbiota in host susceptibility to bladder
and kidney infections. First, women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), a dysbiosis characterized by
overgrowth of fastidious anaerobes including Gardnerella vaginalis, are at higher risk of
experiencing UTI than women with normal vaginal communities (composed mainly of Lacto-
bacillus spp.) [11–14]. Second, women with rUTI experience fewer recurrences after vaginal
interventions that influence the microbiota, such as administration of Lactobacillus crispatus,
than do those receiving placebo [15,16]. Third, sexual activity is one of the strongest risk fac-
tors for both BV and UTI and is an independent risk factor for the development of ascending
kidney infection and pyelonephritis, a more serious form of UTI [6,16–22]. These clinical find-
ings support the longstanding idea that classic uropathogens gain access to the urinary tract by
mechanical transfer from nearby mucosal sites, such as the vagina.

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist
 However, uropathogenic bacteria exist in mucosal sites within the context of the host
microbiota, not in isolation. Thus, bacteria other than classic uropathogens like E. coli are
likely to be frequently transferred from the vagina to the urinary tract. Consistent with this
idea, multiple studies have isolated bacterial species from urine (Gardnerella and lactobacilli
are among the most prominent) that are common members of the vaginal microbiota, sup-
porting the interpretation that the bladder is likely to be regularly exposed to vaginal bacteria
[23–26]. Therefore, we hypothesized that certain vaginal bacteria play an active role in the
bladder, potentially triggering E. coli emergence from bladder reservoirs to cause rUTI and
influencing the propensity for more serious forms of disease.
Results
G. vaginalis triggers E. coli rUTI
To test this hypothesis, we used an established model to generate mice with latent E. coli blad-
der reservoirs [2,27] and then investigated the effect of experimentally exposing the urinary
tract to vaginal bacteria. We chose Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus crispatus to repre-
sent ‘dysbiotic’ and ‘normal’ microbiotas, respectively, as these are often dominant members
of a woman’s vaginal microbiota [28,29]. Furthermore, we previously showed that G. vaginalis
is sufficient to elicit clinical features of BV in a mouse vaginal infection model [30]; thus, we
hypothesized that G. vaginalis may also contribute to the clinical association between BV and
rUTI by stimulating the emergence of latent E. coli reservoirs. To test this idea, we transureth-
rally infected mice with E. coli (primary infection) and monitored their urine for E. coli bacte-
rial titers for four weeks (Fig 1A). In C57BL/6 mice, failure to resolve urine titers after a month
is nearly always indicative of kidney infection; these animals were culled from the experiment.
Individuals with no detectable E. coli in urine at four weeks (~80% of those originally infected)
have been previously shown to contain latent E. coli reservoirs in bladder tissue [2] and were
used in subsequent experiments in which bladders were transurethrally exposed to vaginal
bacteria (G. vaginalis or L. crispatus) or vehicle alone (PBS). Mice were given two such expo-
sures one week apart, and we monitored the emergence of E. coli into urine every 24 hours for
72 hours after each exposure (Fig 1A, cream box).
Even though G. vaginalis failed to establish extended colonization of the urinary tract (Figs
1B and S1), its transient presence was sufficient to trigger E. coli emergence into urine (Fig 1C
and 1D). Although E. coli was sometimes detected in urine after one exposure to G. vaginalis,
the incidence was significantly higher after a second exposure (Figs 1C and S2), consistent
with clinical reports linking frequency of sexual activity with increased risk of UTI [19–21]. In
one experiment, two exposures with a 20-fold lower dose of G. vaginalis resulted in E. coli bac-
teriuria in 33% of mice, compared to 9% in a PBS control group (S3 Fig). Repeated G. vaginalis
exposures leading to E. coli emergence could be spaced as far apart as one week (Fig 1) or as
close as 12 hours (S3 Fig). In contrast, E. coli emergence was not induced by exposure to L. cris-
patus, which was cleared from the mouse urinary tract with similar kinetics to G. vaginalis,
(Fig 1B–1D) or exposure to heat-killed G. vaginalis (S3 Fig). Thus, reactivation of E. coli blad-
der lumen infection in this model was not simply a general response to bacterial exposure.
Rather, it was stimulated by a bacterium implicated in vaginal dysbiosis (G. vaginalis) [28,30]
but not by a bacterium widely recognized as beneficial (L. crispatus) [15,31]. Each of these
organisms commonly dominates the vaginal microbiota, supporting the physiological rele-
vance of the monomicrobial aspect of this model.
In support of the interpretation that E. coli emerged by egress from latent bladder reser-
voirs, the remaining E. coli titers in the bladder tissue at sacrifice were lower in G. vaginalis-
exposed mice than in those exposed to PBS or L. crispatus (Fig 1E). Finally, we found that

 mice in the G. vaginalis-exposed group that had high levels of E. coli bacteria in urine often
also had neutrophilic infiltrates (Fig 1F), confirming that emerging E. coli constituted active
rUTI. Perhaps not surprisingly, animals that went on to experience Gardnerella-induced
rUTI had more severe primary infections with E. coli compared to animals exposed to G.
vaginalis who did not experience rUTI (approximately 200-fold higher levels of E. coli in
urine at 24 hours after the initial E. coli infection) (S4 Fig). Moreover, those that did not expe-
rience rUTI included a significantly higher proportion (17% vs 2%, P = 0.02 by Fishers exact)
of individuals in whom E. coli bacteriuria during the initial infection was undetectable by 24
hours post infection (hpi). The lack of rUTI in these mice was not due simply to an absence

 of E. coli bladder reservoirs, because many mice (in both the PBS and G. vaginalis exposure
groups) that cleared E. coli bacteriuria by 24 hpi still had detectable E. coli in bladder homoge-
nates. This finding suggests that the severity and/or duration of primary E. coli UTI may be a
key determinant of rUTI risk upon secondary exposure. Together, these results highlight G.
vaginalis as the first clinically plausible trigger capable of reactivating latent E. coli bladder
infection to cause rUTI.
G. vaginalis causes bladder epithelial exfoliation
Because chemical exfoliation of the bladder epithelium (urothelium) in mice containing latent
E. coli bladder reservoirs leads to the appearance of E. coli in urine [2,4], we wondered whether
exposure to G. vaginalis also results in apoptosis and exfoliation. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis revealed that, whereas the bladder surface of PBS-exposed mice was smooth
and showed contiguous hexagonal superficial urothelial cells, G. vaginalis-exposed bladders
displayed patches of exfoliation and individual cells detached from their neighbors (Figs 2A
and S5). This occurred in 14/14 G. vaginalis exposed mice, both with and without latent E. coli
bladder reservoirs (Figs 2A and S5), but was not observed in 3 mice exposed to L. crispatus (S5
Fig). Further evidence of exfoliation comes from two additional lines of experimentation.
First, at 12 hours post-exposure, animals that received G. vaginalis exhibited reduced staining
for uroplakin IIIa, a marker of terminally differentiated superficial urothelial cells, compared
to PBS exposed animals (Fig 2B). Second, G. vaginalis-exposed mice had higher numbers of
urothelial cells in urine sediments than PBS-exposed mice (Fig 2C). Together with the estab-
lished relationship between urothelial exfoliation and E. coli emergence from bladder reser-
voirs [2,4], these data support the conclusion that G. vaginalis triggers E. coli rUTI by inducing
exfoliation (Fig 2D).
G. vaginalis induces apoptosis in the bladder epithelium
Previous studies have implicated programmed cell death in urothelial exfoliation [32] [9].
Consistent with apoptosis, we observed membrane protrusions [33] and blebbing in scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of all bladders exposed to G. vaginalis but in none of the
SEM images from mice exposed to PBS (Figs 3A and S6). G. vaginalis also caused membrane
protrusions and blebbing in mice that were not given a primary E. coli infection and thus had
no E. coli bladder reservoir (S6 Fig). In further support of the idea that G. vaginalis exposure
caused apoptosis, bladder epithelial cells from mice that were exposed to G. vaginalis were
TUNEL positive (Fig 3B) and displayed pronounced staining for cleaved caspase-3 (Figs 3C
and 3D and S7), both markers of apoptosis.
Consistent with apoptosis as an immunologically silent form of cell death, bladders of G.
vaginalis-exposed mice showed no increase in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-
1β (Figs 3E and S8), a marker of bladder epithelial exfoliation via pyroptosis [32]. In contrast,
levels of IL-12, IFN-γ, and RANTES were higher in the bladder upon exposure to G. vaginalis
than upon exposure to PBS (Figs 3E and S8). This cytokine signature is consistent with bladder
exfoliation, as these cytokines are also induced as a response to stripping of the bladder epithe-
lium by the immunotherapeutic agent Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
[34]. Together, these results demonstrate that bladder exposure to G. vaginalis results in apo-
ptosis of the urothelium. Evidence that this mechanism might also occur in humans comes
from clinical findings that bladder biopsies from women prone to rUTI exhibit more urothelial
apoptosis than do those from controls [35].

 G. vaginalis causes kidney inflammation and injury and predisposes to
severe E. coli infection
Reactivation of latent E. coli bladder infection has the potential to lead to a more severe mani-
festation of UTI: ascending infection of the kidneys (pyelonephritis), which can lead to urosep-
sis and death. Pyelonephritis often occurs in patients with associated risk factors such as
catheterization, urinary tract obstruction, or other anatomical abnormalities. However, in oth-
erwise healthy women, many of the identified risk factors of pyelonephritis overlap with BV
risk factors (e.g. sexual activity, new sex partner[s], lifetime number of sexual partners, oral
sex, spermicide use, smoking, and vaginal douching) [22,36]. Therefore, we used our model to
test the hypothesis that urinary tract exposures to G. vaginalis could influence the development
of kidney infection by E. coli. First, we detected G. vaginalis in 30–40% of kidneys at levels of
50–3000 cfu per kidney pair at three hours post-exposure both in mice with and without E. coli
reservoirs (Figs 4A and S1). G. vaginalis-exposed mice displayed higher levels of IL-1α, IL-1β,
TNF-α, MIP-1β, and IL-2 in the kidney (Fig 4B) and higher levels of serum creatinine, a bio-
marker of acute kidney injury [37], than PBS controls (Fig 4C). Finally, we examined the

 relationship between kidney inflammation and injury, demonstrating that treatment of naïve
mice (no E. coli reservoirs) with an interleukin-1-receptor antagonist (anakinra) prior to and
during G. vaginalis exposure blocked kidney injury (Fig 4C). In summary, G. vaginalis was suf-
ficient to cause kidney damage independent of the presence of E. coli and this phenotype could
be blocked by an IL-1-receptor antagonist.
In addition to the inflammation and injury caused by G. vaginalis in the kidney (Fig 4B and
4C), exposure to the bacterium also rendered the kidney more susceptible to severe E. coli
infections. Approximately 6% (13/235) of G. vaginalis-exposed animals containing E. coli

 reservoirs developed high titer E. coli kidney infection with severe abscesses and splenomegaly
(Fig 4D). This phenotype was extremely rare among reservoir-containing animals exposed to
PBS across all experiments we performed (1/214, ~0.5%), and was never seen in naïve mice
exposed only to G. vaginalis. The low incidence of abscesses in our model echoes the rarity of
pyelonephritis in women. Although only 1% of healthy reproductive-age women with cystitis
go on to experience pyelonephritis [6], one study showed that >9% of patients with G. vagina-
lis in urine had pyelonephritis [38]. As would be expected, pro-inflammatory cytokines/che-
mokines were present at even higher levels in an abscessed kidney collected at 72 h after
exposure (Fig 4B ‘X’ symbols). Analysis of spleens collected from a subset of mice with
abscessed kidneys revealed that both G. vaginalis and E. coli were capable of causing systemic
infection. In contrast, neither organism was detected in 20/20 spleens from mice lacking
abscesses and splenomegaly (P = 0.0119, Fisher’s exact). Notably, G. vaginalis has been found
in systemic infections in humans [39–42]. Our findings are also consistent with a clinical study
in which inpatients with G. vaginalis in urine were more likely to have a history of rUTI and
current kidney infection than patients without G. vaginalis in urine [38]. Taken together, our

 results demonstrate that G. vaginalis exposure enhances E. coli urinary tract pathogenesis in
the mouse model; whether this also occurs in women warrants further investigation.
Discussion
Latent E. coli reservoirs are regarded as a source of rUTI, but until now, clinically relevant trig-
gers of reactivation have been unknown. Here, we used a new mouse model to show that tran-
sient exposures to G. vaginalis, a prevalent member of the vaginal microbiota and a dominant
species in women with BV, is sufficient to drive E. coli emergence from reservoirs and the
development of more serious manifestations of UTI, such as severe kidney infection (see
model in Fig 5). Our study both shows a direct role for the vaginal microbiota in UTI patho-
genesis and provides a mechanistic understanding of the cellular events leading to rUTI. We
identified a single bacterial species that may explain the long-standing but poorly understood
clinical association between BV and UTI. We note two possible translational outcomes of this
finding. First, our data suggest that therapies aimed at reducing G. vaginalis colonization of the
vagina could protect against E. coli rUTI. Second, given our finding that G. vaginalis exposures
cause kidney damage and increased the likelihood of kidney and systemic infections by E. coli
in mice, G. vaginalis colonization could be a risk factor for pyelonephritis in women. The pos-
sibility of preventing rUTI and subsequent pyelonephritis and systemic infection by targeting
G. vaginalis is an exciting concept given the alarming global rise in multi-drug resistant E. coli
[43].
Our model provides a new lens through which to view clinical findings relevant to the uri-
nary tract. For instance, it is widely thought that the strong relationship between sexual activity
and the risk of UTI [19–21] exists because E. coli or other classical uropathogens are trans-
ferred to the bladder from surrounding niches, such as the vagina. Our data suggest an alterna-
tive, albeit not mutually exclusive, model in which urinary tract exposure to certain members
of the vaginal microbiota, such as G. vaginalis, can elicit E. coli emergence from reservoirs
within the bladder. On this note, we emphasize that vaginal colonization with G. vaginalis can
occur in women who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for BV (for example, see the table of
strains and BV status in [44]). However, the finding that women with BV generally have high
vaginal burdens of G. vaginalis may make urinary tract exposure upon sexual activity (and the
potential consequences thereof) all the more likely. Previous reports that vaginal administra-
tion of L. crispatus reduces the incidence of subsequent rUTI have suggested that L. crispatus
may act by reducing the vaginal reservoir of E. coli [15]. In light of our data, we propose an
additional potential explanation for the protective effect of probiotic L. crispatus: the displace-
ment of G. vaginalis from the vagina, thereby reducing the likelihood of G. vaginalis-induced
recurrent E. coli UTI. Taken together, these observations suggest that repeated transient expo-
sures to G. vaginalis may be broadly important in determining susceptibility to E. coli rUTI
and may act through previously unrecognized routes.
Our results shed light on established, albeit largely ignored, clinical findings of G. vaginalis
in both the bladder and the kidney [45–51]. With respect to the bladder, our discovery that G.
vaginalis causes damage to the urothelium are relevant to a study in which 25% of women with
urinary frequency or dysuria had urine samples containing G. vaginalis in counts greater than
103 cfu/mL. Furthermore, G. vaginalis was isolated more frequently as a member of the “uri-
nary microbiome” of women suffering from urgency urinary incontinence (a.k.a. overactive
bladder syndrome) than healthy controls [23]. Although there is some debate regarding the
impact of “urinary microbiome” bacteria and whether or not they represent an established
community, our findings emphasize that long-standing colonization of the bladder may not be
required for bacteria such as G. vaginalis to affect disease outcomes. In regards to the kidney,

 our finding that G. vaginalis was associated with markers of kidney injury parallel a study in
which G. vaginalis was detected in urine collected directly from the bladder in 33% of patients
with “sterile pyelonephritis” (i.e., patients with reflux scarring in the apparent absence of bacte-
rial infection) [45]. Strikingly, G. vaginalis was localized to the upper urinary tract in 75% of

urinary tract infection (rUTI) episodes are caused by an E. coli strain identical to the strain that caused the
initial infection. Here we present a model of one mechanism of rUTI: activation of latent intracellular E. coli
reservoirs in the bladder. G. vaginalis urinary tract exposure, likely a consequence of sexual activity, results in
exfoliation of the bladder epithelium and damage to the kidney. Subsequent to exfoliation, E. coli emerges
from intracellular reservoirs into the bladder lumen, where it can ascend into the kidney, sometimes causing
severe inflammation and systemic infection. Often E. coli rUTI occurs after G. vaginalis clearance from the
urinary tract. These findings have important implications for our understanding of rUTI etiology and point to G.
vaginalis colonization as a potentially important marker of rUTI risk.

 these patients [45]. Despite these reports of G. vaginalis in the urinary tract, the classification
of G. vaginalis as a “uropathogen” is currently controversial. We note that fastidious growth
requirements make G. vaginalis unrecoverable, or at least unidentifiable, under conditions
most often used by clinical microbiology labs for the culture and identification of potential
uropathogens. Indeed, a recent investigation of 120 patient urines identified G. vaginalis by
proteomic analysis in nearly 20% of samples, none of which were classified as containing G.
vaginalis based on standard aerobic culture [52]. Thus, it is likely that the incidence of G. vagi-
nalis in the urinary tract is underestimated. Taken together with this body of clinical findings,
our data implicate G. vaginalis as a cause of urologic pathology, both together with and inde-
pendent of E. coli, and strongly support further investigations into the possible role of this
organism in urologic conditions of unknown or disputed etiology. Also of note, it is becoming
increasingly evident that there is a broad range of genetic and phenotypic diversity among
individual strains of G. vaginalis [53–55]. Future studies will reveal whether certain lineages of
G. vaginalis are more frequently associated with negative effects in the urinary tract.
Finally and more broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for understanding and diag-
nosing recurrent infections. With few exceptions, the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial
infections is founded on the assumption that the pathogen present at the time of clinical pre-
sentation is the main driver of disease. However, this classical view of pathogenesis may be
overly simplistic. Our work provides a new paradigm we term “covert pathogenesis”, whereby
transient exposure to organism A triggers disease caused by organism B, despite organism A
being absent at the time of disease emergence. These short-lived bacterial exposures are likely
to be missed in the clinical setting because they occur before disease symptom onset but never-
theless could drive both the recurrence and severity of disease caused by a recognized patho-
gen. “Covert pathogenesis” may be relevant in other contexts in which the natural triggers of
disease have remained obscure. For instance, we see several striking parallels between our
model and another extremely common latent bacterial infection: tuberculosis (TB). Approxi-
mately one-third of the world’s population harbors latent TB in the lungs, with 5–15% devel-
oping symptomatic disease [56]. The recent reports of the “lung microbiome” [57,58] echo the
concept that the lung may be routinely transiently exposed to bacteria, and thus “covert patho-
genesis” should be explored as a potential mechanism of reactivation of latent TB. Ultimately,
our finding that short-lived microbial exposures influence disease pathogenesis may have far-
reaching implications beyond the urinary tract.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli clinical cystitis isolate UTI89 containing a kanamycin resis-
tance cassette (UTI89 kanR) [59] was grown static at 37˚C under aerobic conditions in Lysog-
eny broth (LB) medium or on LB agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/mL kanamycin. A
spontaneous streptomycin-resistant (SmR) strain of Gardnerella vaginalis derived from clinical
isolate JCP8151B (from a BV-positive woman) was cultured in NYCIII media or on NYCIII
agar plates supplemented with 1 mg/mL streptomycin at 37˚C in an anaerobic chamber. Lacto-
bacillus crispatus GED7756A was obtained from a vaginal swab of a BV-negative woman
(Nugent score = 1). The vaginal swab was transported from the clinic to the lab using Port-
A-Cu pre-reduced anaerobic transport media tubes (BD). Tubes were brought into a vinyl
anaerobic airlock chamber (Coy Products) under an atmosphere maintained at approximately
1% hydrogen and 0 ppm oxygen. Within 24 hours the swab was streaked to isolation using de
Man Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) medium. All growth incubations were static at 37˚C, under
aerobic (E. coli) or anaerobic (G. vaginalis and L. crispatus) conditions, as we have previously

 described [30,44,60,61]. For infection experiments, E. coli was inoculated from an LB agar
plate into 10 mL LB medium, grown ~24 h, then subcultured 1:10 in fresh LB for 18 h. E. coli
inoculum was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at OD 0.35 (~1–2 x 107 colony
forming units (cfu) in 50 μL). G. vaginalis was inoculated from an NYCIII agar plate into 3 mL
NYCIII media and grown overnight, ~18 h. G. vaginalis inoculum was prepared in PBS at OD
5 (~5 x 107–1 x 108 cfu in 50 μL). L. crispatus was inoculated from an MRS agar plate into 3 mL
MRS media and grown overnight ~18 h. L. crispatus inoculum was prepared in PBS at OD 10
(~1 x 108 cfu in 50 μL). For experiments using heat-killed G. vaginalis, the inoculum was
divided into two aliquots and one was incubated at 80˚C for 10 min. Complete killing was con-
firmed by incubation on NYCII medium for 48 h anaerobically at 37˚C.
Ethics statement
Mouse experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the Animal
Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine (Protocol Number:
20140114).
Mice
Five- to six-week old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Labs (NCI
grantee order from Fredericks facility). Mice were given a regular chow diet in a specific patho-
gen-free facility at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.
Mouse infection/exposure model
Mice (6–8 weeks of age) were anaesthetized with isofluorane and then inoculated transureth-
rally with 107 cfu E. coli (UTI89 kanR) in 50 μL sterile PBS as previously described [60,61].
Urine was collected and monitored for E. coli titers at 24 hours post infection (hpi) and weekly
for 4 weeks. Mice with E. coli bacteriuria (any level of bacteria in urine) at 4 wpi, thus pre-
sumed to have E. coli kidney infection based on previous reports [62] and our own observa-
tions, were culled from the experiments. Mice that were negative for bacteriuria, thus
presumed to contain intracellular E. coli reservoirs, were divided into groups for transurethral
exposure to either PBS, G. vaginalis (7x107- 1x108 JCP-8151B SmR) or L. crispatus (1x108
GED7756A). For individual experiments, 20 mice per group were required, to be powered
(0.8) to detect a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between a 10% rate of spontaneous
rUTI in the control group and 50% rate of rUTI in the G. vaginalis group. The groups were fre-
quency matched based upon the time course of clearance of E. coli urine titers during the ini-
tial infection (also, E. coli titers at 24 hours post initial infection were not statistically different
between groups). Mice were inoculated transurethrally with PBS, G. vaginalis or L. crispatus
twice (12 h or 1 w apart). Urine was collected at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi (as indicated in text
and figure legends) and bacterial titers enumerated by serial dilution and plating on selective
media for either E. coli (LB+kanamycin) or G. vaginalis (NYCIII+streptomycin). Mice were
humanely sacrificed (cervical dislocation under isofluorane anaesthesia) to aseptically harvest
bladders, kidneys and spleens. Homogenates were prepared in 1 mL sterile PBS and plated on
appropriate selective media. Bacterial burden in each sample was calculated as cfu/bladder or
cfu/kidney pair. Samples with no colonies were plotted at one-half of the limit of detection. A
500 μL aliquot of each bladder and kidney homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a
benchtop microcentrifuge for 5 minutes at 4˚C and supernatants were removed and stored at
-20˚C for cytokine analysis, as described below.

 Urine sediment microscopy
Eighty microliters of a 10-fold dilution of urine was cytospun onto coated Cytopro Dual
microscope slides and stained with a Hema 3 staining kit (Fisher) to visualize epithelial cells
and neutrophils (PMNs). Slides were observed on a Olympus Vanox AHBT3 microscope.
Urine samples were scored qualitatively for the degree of epithelial exfoliation (ranging from
0 = none to 3 = robust) in a blinded fashion.
Scanning electron microscopy
Bladders were aseptically harvested, splayed, and fixed in EM fixative (2% paraformaldehyde,
2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Samples were prepared by criti-
cal point drying. Briefly, samples were post-fixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in
increasing concentrations of ethanol, then dehydrated at 31.1˚C and 1072 PSI for 16 minutes
in a critical point dryer. Samples were mounted on carbon tape-coated stubs and sputter-
coated with gold/palladium under argon. Bladders shown in Figs 2, 3 S5 and S6 were imaged
on a Zeiss Crossbeam 540 FIB-SEM. For preliminary analysis samples were imaged on a Hita-
chi S-2600H SEM. ImageJ 1.49v (National Institutes of Health, USA) was used to add scale
bars.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
Bladders were fixed overnight in methacarn (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial ace-
tic acid) at room temperature followed by paraffin embedding and histological slide prepara-
tion performed by the Washington University School of Medicine Histology Core. For
immunofluorescence, slides were deparaffinized, hydrated, blocked with 1% BSA and 0.3% tri-
ton X-100 in PBS, incubated with primary antibody to uroplakin III (M-17 goat polyclonal
IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer overnight at 4˚C and secondary antibody
in PBS for 30–60 minutes at room temperature. Antibodies are verified at 1DegreeBio (http://
1degreebio.org/). Samples were stained with Hoechst for 5 min, mounted with ProLong Gold
anti-fade mounting medium (ThermoFisher / Life Technologies) and then visualized on an
Olympus BX61 fluorescent microscope using SlideBook 5.0 software. Terminal deoxynucleoti-
dyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using the In situ Cell
Death Detection Kit (Roche) following manufacturer’s protocol for paraffin-embedded tissue.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of cleaved caspase-3 was performed using SignalStain Apo-
ptosis (Cleaved Caspase-3) IHC kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol.
Cytokine/chemokine analysis
Tissue homogenate supernatants collected as described above were thawed on ice, centrifuged
again at 4˚C to remove any remaining particulates and then cytokine expression was measured
using the Bio-Plex-Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Panel multiplex cytokine bead kit (Bio-Rad),
which quantifies 23 different cytokines/chemokines. Assay was performed according to manu-
facturer instructions, except using 10-fold less standard and half the amount of coupled beads
and detection antibodies indicated in the protocol.
Serum analysis of kidney damage
Blood was collected from mice at sacrifice by cardiac puncture and put into 400-μl Microtainer
serum separation tubes (BD). After coagulation, Microtainer tubes were subjected to centrifu-
gation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and stored at −20˚C. Serum was thawed on

 ice and creatinine levels were measured using the QuantiChrom Creatinine Assay Kit (BioAs-
say Systems) according to manufacturers’ instructions.
Statistics

While it is unclear how G. vaginalis, which is non-motile, accesses the kidney, interestingly
there is precedent for non-motile bacteria accessing the kidney in C57BL/6 mice: Staphylococ-
cus saprophyticus [63], Enterococcus faecalis [64] and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) [65]. Thus,
this phenomenon is not limited to G. vaginalis and could be a shared feature of Gram positive
bacterial infection of the urinary tract. Data from 3 and 12 h after exposure 2 are also shown in
