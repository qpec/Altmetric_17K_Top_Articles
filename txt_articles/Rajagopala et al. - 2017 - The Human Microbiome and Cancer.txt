ABSTRACT
Recent scientific advances have significantly contributed to our understanding of the
complex connection between the microbiome and cancer. Our bodies are contin-
uously exposed to microbial cells, both resident and transient, as well as their byproducts, including toxic
metabolites. Circulation of toxic metabolites may contribute to cancer onset or progression at locations
distant from where a particular microbe resides. Moreover, microbes may migrate to other locations in the
human body and become associated with tumor development. Several case–control metagenomics studies
suggest that dysbiosis in the commensal microbiota is also associated with inflammatory disorders and
various cancer types throughout the body. Although the microbiome influences carcinogenesis through
mechanisms independent of inflammation and immune system, the most recognizable link is between the
microbiome and cancer via the immune system, as the resident microbiota plays an essential role in
activating, training, and modulating the host immune response. Immunologic dysregulation is likely to
provide mechanistic explanations as to how our microbiome influences cancer development and cancer
therapies. In this review, we discuss recent developments in understanding the human gut microbiome's
relationship with cancer and the feasibility of developing novel cancer diagnostics based on microbiome
profiles. Cancer Prev Res; 10(4); 226–34. �2017 AACR.
An Overview of the Human Microbiome,
Immunity, and Cancer
Obtaining a comprehensive view of the microbial ecosystems
that are associated with the human body (the human micro-
biome) has become possible with advances in culture-inde-
pendent "omics" analyses using next-generation sequencing
(NGS) techniques (1, 2). Several studies have suggested a
correlation between our microbiome and various diseases,
including metabolic disorders, gastrointestinal complexities,
and infectious diseases (3–6), and to date, thousands of articles
focused on the human microbiome in health and disease
conditions have been published. The estimated trillions of
microbes that inhabit the human body establish a beneficial
relationship with the host, but it is clear that dysbiotic relation-
ships can develop, some of which are thought to result in the
development of inflammatory diseases and cancers. Several
animal models have provided insight on possible mechanisms

 for microbial cancer triggers, although the situation is complex
as both tumor-promoting and antitumor effects have been
observed in the presence or absence of particular microbial
species (7–11). The microbiota may also induce carcinogenesis
through the release of genotoxins that can damage host DNA.
This can directly promote carcinogenesis. Bacterial toxins and
tumor-promoting metabolites may also lead to chronic inflam-
mation, which in turn may trigger damage to host cells and
tissue linings (12, 13). In addition, immunologic dysregulation
in response to the resident microbiome may lead to tumor
growth (7). There is also an increasing understanding of the
composition of the human virome (viruses and bacterio-
phages), particularly in the gut and oral cavity (14–17). The
normal gut virome is proposed to have a role in protective
immunity during gut inflammation (18).
The variability of microbial populations and physiologic envir-
onments at different sites of the human body suggests that
microbial mechanisms and species that are involved in cancer
onset will also vary depending on the location. Impaired micro-
biota can facilitate carcinogenesis through a variety of mechan-
isms that have been reported in the literature (12, 13). This
minireview focuses on cancers promoted by pathogens and
immune system–mediated mechanisms.

described genetic mechanisms (13). There are 10 specific biolog-
ical agents that have been designated by the International Agency
for Cancer Research as carcinogenic to humans (19). One of them,
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) colonizes the gastric mucosa of half of
the world's population (20) and induces chronic gastric inflam-
mation, which can progress toward gastric carcinoma. Although
only about 1% to 3% of H. pylori–colonized individuals develop
gastric cancer, it substantially contributes to global cancer mor-
tality (21–23). The mechanism by which H. pylori induces onset of
gastric cancer is largely attributed to the presence of cytotoxin-
associated gene A (CagA) and secretion of virulence factors, such
as VacA, urease, and NapA2, to promote chronic inflammation,
oxidative stress, and host DNA damage, which can contribute to
carcinogenesis (24–26). The pathogen uses the type IV secretion
system to translocate CagA to gastric epithelial cells, which aber-
rantly modulates b-catenin to increase propensity for gastric

 cancer (27) (Fig. 1A). Chronic bacterial infections can also pro-
mote host genetic instability (28). For example, mice chronically
infected with H. pylori show a 4-fold increase in mutation fre-
quency compared with uninfected mice (29). However, studies
in germ-free mice have shown that H. pylori alone is less likely to
induce gastric cancer. The germ-free mice co-colonized with
complex intestinal flora and H. pylori synergistically promote
invasive gastrointestinal intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN) in
80% of mice, whereas only 10% of H. pylori only–colonized
males developed GIN, with less severe gastric lesions and
significantly delayed onset of GIN (30). The mice co-colonized
with complex intestinal flora and H. pylori developed more
severe gastric pathology, and the mice co-colonized with
H. pylori and restricted altered Schaedler flora (Clostridium
species, Lactobacillus murinus, and Bacteriodes species) were
only slightly less severe (31). Interestingly H. pylori infection
is also associated with decreased risk of esophageal adenocar-
cinoma, highlighting the complexity of microbial effects on
tissue-specific carcinogenesis (32).
Metagenomics and transcriptomics studies provide insights
into the relationship between Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucle-
atum) and colorectal cancer. Several case–control human
cohort studies found higher abundance of Fusobacterium spp.
in colorectal adenomas compared with controls (33, 34). F.
nucleatum introduction to a mouse model of intestinal tumor-
igenesis accelerated tumor development and modulated the
tumor microenvironment through an NF-kB–driven proinflam-
matory response without inducing more widespread inflam-
mation (35). Rubinstein and colleagues demonstrated that F.
nucleatum promotes colorectal cancer by modulating E-cad-
herin/b-catenin signaling via its FadA protein (Fig. 1A; ref. 36),
FadA binding to E-cadherin inhibits the latter's tumor-suppres-
sive activity. Conversely, inhibition of FadA binding to E-
cadherin using an inhibitory peptide abolishes the host inflam-
matory response and tumor growth (36). A recent study by
Abed and colleagues investigated mechanisms underlying fuso-
bacterial attachment to and invasion of colonic adenomas and
colorectal cancer (37). The investigators observed that a host

Mechanisms by which microbes promote carcinogenesis. A, Microbes inject effectors into the host cells. These effectors modulate the Wnt/b-catenin
signaling by activating b-catenin. For example, H. pylori effector protein CagA interacts with E-cadherin and disassociates the E-cadherin/b-catenin protein complex,
which leads to increased accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear b-catenin. b-Catenin complexes with TCF/LEF transcription factors and activates target gene
expression. F. nucleatum modulates b-catenin signaling via its FadA protein. Aberrant b-catenin signaling is associated with tumorigenesis and progression.
Prolonged exposure to H. pylori protein VacA prevents autophagy. The interaction between F. nucleatum Fap2 protein and host polysaccharide (Gal-GalNAc)
mediates F. nucleatum colonization in colorectal cancer. F. nucleatum mediates tumor-immune evasion via TIGIT. The Fap2 protein secreted by F. nucleatum
interacts with TIGIT and inhibits natural killer (NK) cell–mediated immunosurveillance of cancer. B, Several human viruses, including HPV, HBV, HCV, HTLV,
EBV, and KSHV, are known to cause various cancers. They encode oncoproteins and pathways that have been shown to transform nonpermissive cell types and
induce tumors in animal models. During active infection and latent phase, these cancer-causing viruses modify epigenetic programs and impair DNA repair
mechanisms in various ways. These subversions lead to host genome instability, a hallmark of carcinogenesis. C, Proinflammatory signaling, as a result of barrier
failure, induces genomic instability and chronic inflammation, hallmarks for carcinogenesis. D, Dysbiosis and altered microbiota–host interaction can induce
carcinogenesis through various mechanisms; increased bacterial translocation and immune dysregulation are shown as examples. Microorganism-associated
molecular patterns (MAMP) are recognized by TLRs in several cell types. Activation of TLRs by MAMPs and other microbial products contributes to carcinogenesis.
For example, TLR4, the receptor for LPS component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall, promotes hepatocellular and pancreatic cancer colon cancer.
TLR-induced NF-kB and STAT3 activation are key cancer-promoting signaling pathways. Microbiota-induced immune dysregulation can initiate
inflammasomes-associated immune response and TLR-activated autophagy.

 polysaccharide, Gal-GalNAc, is overexpressed in colorectal can-
cer and readily recognized by fusobacterial protein Fap2 to
mediate F. nucleatum attachment to colorectal cancer (37) (Fig.
1A). F. nucleatum also mediates tumor-immune evasion via the
T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). The
Fap2 proteins, secreted by F. nucleatum, interact with TIGIT and
inhibit the natural killer cell-mediated immunosurveillance of
cancer (Fig. 1A; ref. 78).
Cancers promoted by viruses
The composition and role of the human virome in health is not
well understood. However, there are viruses that are known to
cause various cancers, some of which are sufficiently prevalent in
the population to be considered part of the human virome.
Recognized associations include human papillomaviruses (HPV)
causing cervical carcinoma, hepatitis B (HBV) and C viruses
(HCV) being the causative agents of hepatocellular carcinomas,
human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV) being involved in T-cell
leukemia, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) being involved in B-cell
lymphoproliferative diseases and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and
Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) being the etio-
logic factor for Kaposi sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas
(38–40). Human polyomaviruses such as Merkel cell polyoma-
virus (MCV) and Simian Virus 40 (SV40) are implicated in Merkel
cell carcinoma (MCC) and mesothelioma, respectively (38, 39).
In addition, MCV, which is highly prevalent virus in the general
population, can lead to an aggressive form of skin cancer in the
elderly and immunosuppressed individuals (41). These viruses
contributed to about 1.3 million new cancer cases worldwide in
2008, demonstrating the importance of fully understanding their
biology (19). Themechanisms by which these viruses cause cancer
are quite complex. They encode oncoproteins and pathways that
have been shown to transform nonpermissive cell types and
induce tumors in animal models (38–40). During active infec-
tion, these cancer-causing viruses exploit host cell machinery to
perform their own replication, including altering cellular struc-
tures, manipulating signaling pathways, modifying epigenetic
programs, and impairing DNA repair mechanisms in various
ways. Together, these subversions ultimately lead to genome
instability, a hallmark of cancer (Fig. 1B; ref. 39). There is the
added complication in that many of these viruses either integrate
into the host genome (HPV, HTLV-1, and HBV among others) or
are maintained as latent episomal genomes (EBV and KSHV),
resulting in lifetime infections. For HPV, integration of its genome
into the host is a central mechanism of oncogenesis because it
results in the overexpression of the viral E6 and E7 genes, which
synergistically act to immortalize host cells (38). The MCV genome
is clonally integrated in the majority of MCC tumors and its
regulatory small T antigen acts as a potent oncogene capable of
inducing cell transformation (42, 43). For the latent viruses, even
though almost all the viral gene expression is silenced, certain viral
genes, including oncogenes, are expressed and manipulate path-
ways that can lead to genome instability (38, 39).
The epidemiologic association of these viruses with cancer is
complicated by the fact that several viruses are highly prevalent in
the human population. However, the malignancies that they are
associated with are relatively rare and require genetic and/or
environmental cofactors to develop. For example, seroprevalence
of EBV is >80% in the United States (44). EBV is the causative
agent of, and is associated with, all cases of nasopharyngeal
cancer, which has particularly high incidence in specific geograph-
ic locations, suggesting that there are additional important cofac-
tors for the development of disease (38). The virus may also act as
a cofactor, as with Burkitt lymphoma where EBV is present in
nearly 100% of Burkitt lymphoma cancers, but is not itself the
causative agent (45). Burkitt lymphoma is caused by chromo-
somal translocations that deregulate the proto-oncogenic c-myc
gene. There is evidence that Burkitt lymphoma cofactors EBV and
malaria protect cells from c-myc–induced apoptosis and expand
the number of EBVþ germinal center cells from which the lym-
phoma arises, respectively (46, 47). EBV is also associated with a
subset of cases of Hodgkin disease and gastric cancers but is not
causative (38). Interestingly, EBV viral gene expression is distinct
in each of these malignancies because they arise at different stages
of the viral life cycle (45). The varied interactions of EBV and other
cofactors in a number of cancer types demonstrate the compli-
cated interplay of contributing factors in cancer genesis and
progression.
Barrier failure and microbial toxins
Anatomic separation of intestinal microbiota from the host
epithelial cells is critical for regulating immune activation and
upholding mutualistic host–microbial associations (12, 48). The
goblet cells produce intestinal mucus and Paneth cells produce
antimicrobial peptides, which contribute to the separation of host
and microbial compartments across the mucosal interface, which
limits interaction between the microbiome and immune system
(49, 50). Disrupted barrier function may trigger inflammation
and carcinogenesis. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are well-
known examples of intestinal barrier dysfunction and contribute
to the risk of colon cancers (51–53) (Fig. 1C). A genome-wide
association study suggests an association between colorectal
tumor risk and polymorphisms in crucial barrier proteins, such
as laminins (13, 54). Experiments in laboratory animals have
shown that reduction of mucus or induced barrier failure increase
the circulation of carcinogens through a disrupted gut, leading to
the development of intestinal adenocarcinoma as well as tumors
in distant organs (55, 56).
Impaired barrier function allows bacterial access to intestinal
epithelium, which enables delivery of toxins. Bacterial toxins,
such as colibactin-expressing Escherichia coli (encoded within the
pks genomic island), potentiate colorectal cancer in azoxy-
methane-exposed mice (57). Toxins produced by enterotoxigenic
Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) have been associated with acute
inflammatory bowel disease (58), and colorectal neoplasia, espe-
cially in late-stage colorectal cancer (59). Similarly, several Gram-
negative bacteria produce cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that
together with colibactin can cause DNA damage in mammalian
cells. Chronic exposure to CDT promotes genomic instability in
fibroblasts and colon epithelial cells (60). As stated earlier,
genome instability is a hallmark of cancer.
Intestinal microbiota and their metabolites impact the devel-
opment of cancer in sites distant from the intestine. For example,
the liver does not contain a known microbiome. Yet, intestinal
bacteria promote hepatocellular carcinoma (also caused by HBV
and HCV) via inflammatory microorganism-associated molecular
patterns and bacterial metabolites, which can circulate to distant
sites (8, 13, 61). Sustained accumulation of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), a component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall, also
promotes inflammation-associated hepatocarcinogenesis in ani-
mal models (61). Although mouse models have shown that gut
commensal microflora and dietary fiber may protect against

 colonic inflammation and colon cancer through the microbe-
produced metabolite butyrate (62–64), data from another study
show the opposite effect (65). These studies, which are outside of
the scope of the current review, highlight the issues when com-
paring microbiome studies across different research groups, as
well as challenges in translating research data to consensus guide-
lines for dietary interventions to prevent cancer risks. Further
investigation is required to delineate the role of butyrate and
other diet-induced metabolites in carcinogenesis.
Gut microbiome and cancer
Although findings that associate the human microbiome with
cancers are preliminary in nature, some hint at possible new
microbe–cancer relationships that were not observed before the
advent of high-throughput sequencing. This is likely due to the
difficulty associated with cultivating microbial species, with an
estimated less than 30% of human microbial species being
culturable in the laboratory, and recent studies have suggested
in some cases polymicrobial disease causation. In addition to
human studies, there have been many studies performed in
animal models, and some of these observations are outlined
below.
One of the most deadly cancers is esophageal cancer. This is a
disease that evolves from inflammation due to reflux esopha-
gitis to metaplasia (Barrett esophagus; refs. 66, 67). The disease
is possibly the result of several complicating factors, including
antibiotics usage, diet, and smoking. Recent studies have
shown a potential role of the microbiome in the esophagus
in healthy and disease conditions (68). Microbiome analyses of
the normal and esophagitis or Barrett esophagus biopsy sam-
ples reveal a significant difference between the microbiome of
normal esophagus, which is dominated by the genus Strepto-
coccus and the microbiome of esophagitis and Barrett esopha-
gus with an increase in the relative abundance of Gram-negative
anaerobic species (69). Similarly, Gall and colleagues observed
that Streptococcus was the most prevalent genus in normal
esophagus or reflux esophagitis versus Veillonella in Barrett
esophagus; Fusobacterium was found only in patients with reflux
esophagitis or Barrett esophagus but not in a normal esophagus
(70). Another study in Barrett esophagus cohort found an
association between the ratio of Streptococcus to Prevotella spe-
cies and abdominal obesity as well as hiatal hernia length,
which

risk
factors in Barrett esophagus (70). To address a role for infec-
tious disease species and the human microbiome in this disease
etiology, our team recently performed NGS on gastroesopha-
geal reflux disease samples derived from 121 subjects in dif-
ferent phenotypic groups (unpublished data). Samples for NGS
were collected from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and
colon, and the resulting sequences clustered into 1,607 oper-
ational taxonomic units. We observed that the overall commu-
nity composition was affected by body site and disease phe-
notype. Several bacterial phyla had significant correlations with
disease stage. In the esophagus, Firmicutes was the only phylum
with a significant positive correlation to disease.
Expression of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like
receptors (TLR), is known to be progressively increased in
different stages of gastric cancer (Fig. 1D; refs. 71, 72). Whereas
TLRs are localized to the apical and basolateral compartments
in normal gastric epithelial cells, they become homogeneously
distributed in tumor cells (73, 74). Interestingly, a similar
paradigm has recently been observed in esophageal cancer.
When the expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 was
examined in esophageal specimens from patients using IHC,
expression for all of these TLRs was found to increase in Barrett
mucosa and dysplasia and remain high in adenocarcinoma
(75). Moreover, high expression of TLR4 in the nucleus and the
cytoplasm was associated with metastasis and poor prognosis
(75). Various cancer cells, including cells of an esophageal
cancer cell line, demonstrated cellular invasion in an in vitro
Matrigel assay when stimulated with DNA, a TLR9 ligand (76).
A future challenge will be to define microbial interactions
involving TLRs in an effort to understand cancer progression
in the esophagus.
Although imbalances in the gut microbiota have been linked to
colorectal adenomas and cancer, only Fusobacterium has been
identified as a risk factor. Fusobacterium has been found to be
associated with colorectal tumor tissue in several different studies
(33, 77), but the presence of Porphyromonas species as well
suggests the possibility of a polymicrobial disease trigger. In
addition, other studies have identified Peptostreptococcus, Prevo-
tella, Parvimonas, Leptotrichia, Campylobacter, and Gemella as addi-
tional genera that are associated with the detection of colorectal
cancer (79). In studies of colon cancer, Zackular and colleagues
used 16S rRNA gene signatures from the stool samples of healthy,
precancerous adenomas, and colon cancer in humans to demon-
strate that the feces of people with cancer tended to have an altered
composition of bacteria, with an excess of the common mouth
microbes, Fusobacterium or Porphyromonas (80). Similarly, Zeller
his colleagues showed that the metagenomic profiling of fecal
samples from colorectal cancer patients in comparison with
tumorfree controls reveals associations between the gut micro-
biota and cancer, distinguishing sample types with similar accu-
racy as the fecal occult blood test, used for clinical screening. Two
Fusobacterium species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Peptos-
treptococcus stomatis, were enriched in colorectal cancer patients
(81). In addition, metatranscriptome data revealed a significant
overrepresentation and cooccurrence of Fusobacterium, Campylo-
bacter, and Leptotrichia genera in colorectal cancer tumor samples.
These are Gram-negative anaerobes that are generally considered
to be oral bacteria, but the tumor isolates of Fusobacterium and
Campylobacter are genetically diverged from their oral comple-
ments (79). The Campylobacter isolate Campylobacter showae from
the colorectal tumor was substantially diverged from their oral
isolate (79). Other cancer-associated microbiome studies exist,
although the cohorts used have invariably been relatively small.
For example, to evaluate microbial association in oral cancers,
Schmidt and colleagues (82) sequenced microbial DNA derived
from cancer and normal tissues (matched) in patients. Compar-
ison of 16S rRNA gene V4 data from these samples revealed
changes in the abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes between
oral cancer and normal tissues (82).
Experiments with germ-free animals have helped to clarify
causality between dysbiosis and cancer. For example, T-cell recep-
tor b-chain and p53 knockout mice have the propensity to
develop malignant tumors. When germ-free mice with the knock-
outs were colonized with gut microbiota, 70% of the animals
developed adenocarcinomas in the colon, as expected. However,
control germ-free animals did not develop adenocarcinomas in
the same timeframe (83). Similarly, mice with a mutation in the
tumor suppressor gene APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) had
reduced occurrence of intestinal tumors when they were rendered

 germ free, as opposed to specific pathogen free, suggesting that
commensal bacteria play a pathogenic role in this system (84).
Tumors in the specific pathogen-free mice showed profiles of
inflammation, signs of barrier damage, and activation of c-Jun/
JNK and STAT3 pathways (84). An inflammation-based murine
model can be generated by treating a normal mouse with the
chemical carcinogen azoxymethane, followed by dextran sodium
sulfate (85). When an antibiotic cocktail was administered in this
model, the rate of colon tumors was reduced, although the total
number of bacteria appeared to be unchanged, suggesting that
specific species contribute to tumorigenesis (86). When germ-free
mice were colonized with microbiota from cancer-bearing mice,
the rate of tumors was higher than with microbiota from healthy
mice (86). The demonstration of reduced frequencies of tumors in
germ-free mice provides support for studies in which specific
microbes added to conventional mice resulted in increased fre-
quencies of cancer. Examples of specific microbes are F. nucleatum
and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis as discussed above. Reconstitution
of specific microbiotas in germ-free mice is an exciting approach
for dissecting the network of microbial and host interactions
involved in dysbiosis, inflammation, and cancer.
Immunoregulation and microbiome
Microbiota plays a significant, albeit incompletely mapped,
role in the shaping of innate and acquired immunity (87). This
process starts during the constitution of the microbial flora at
birth, influencing the maturation of the immune system and
the development of tolerance and containment of the micro-
biome (87–89). It continues throughout life via signaling by
innate immunity receptors, through sampling of the micro-
biota by the acquired immune response, and by the generation
of metabolic products (90, 91). The central role of immunity in
the biology of cancer calls for attention to the exact contribu-
tion of microbiota in oncogenesis. For example, data from
germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice suggest a diminished
response to CpG stimulation in the setting of cancer immu-
notherapy (92). Upregulation of TLRs by LPS and other micro-
bial products can activate the NF-kB, c-Jun/JNK, and JAK/STAT3
pathways that have well-defined roles in cell proliferation and
immunosuppression (Fig. 1D; refs. 12, 93). More generally, the
use of antibiotics in the clinical care of individuals with cancer,
particularly during periods of immunosuppression, may inter-
fere with effective anticancer immune responses (94).
Microbiome, autophagy, and cancer
Autophagy is a membrane-trafficking mechanism that deli-
vers cytoplasmic constituents into the lysosome for protein
degradation. Autophagy plays a significant role in the mainte-
nance of cellular homeostasis. The role of autophagy in cancer
is complex and context dependent. In preclinical models of
carcinogenesis, autophagy prevents malignant transformation
by degrading potentially harmful entities inside the cell but,
later, promotes the growth of established tumors (95). One
function of autophagy is to prevent intracellular viral and
bacterial infection and control inflammation through innate
immune signaling pathways (Fig. 1D; ref. 96). Many bacteria
have evolved mechanisms to prevent degradation by autop-
hagy, including H. pylori (97). Prolonged exposure to H. pylori
protein VacA prevents autophagosome maturation, and the
bacteria are able to persist in these compartments (98). This
promotes an environment that favors carcinogenesis by the
accumulation of damaged organelles and protein aggregates,
persistent H. pylori infection, and chronic inflammation. The
effect of autophagy on carcinogenesis also appears to be tissue
specific, and its effects can be mediated through the micro-
biome. In the pancreas and lung, inhibition of autophagy
predisposes the tissue to lesions (95). However, in models of
colorectal cancer, the inhibition of autophagy prevents the
development of precancerous lesions (99). The antitumor
effects of this inhibition are mediated through the gut micro-
biome, as autophagy deficiency led to changes in the intestinal
microbial community, and treatment with broad-spectrum
antibiotics impairs the protective CD8þ antitumoral responses,
and induced intestinal lesions (99).
The Future of the Microbiome in Cancer
Therapy: Development of Novel
Diagnostics and Preventative Measures
Based on Microbiome Profiles
As the scientific community continues to generate more micro-
biome data, and integrate other "omics" types such as transcrip-
tomics, proteomics, and metabolomics from well-phenotyped
cohorts, we will identify novel microbial signatures that are
associated with disease onset and progression in many diseases,
including cancer. These microbiome signatures (including circu-
lating metabolites) have the potential to be developed into
diagnostics and therapeutics. Our team, for example, recently
studied the microbiome in childhood leukemia patients (an
estimated 15,000 children under the age of 19 are diagnosed
with leukemia, lymphoma, and other tumors in the United States
every year) with the goal of measuring microbiome changes
associated with disease onset (100). Our other goal was to identify
novel therapies that could be developed for compromises asso-
ciated with chemotherapy treatment. Known side effects of che-
motherapeutic treatments often include drug-induced gastroin-
testinal mucositis with diarrhea, constipation, and increased risk
of gastrointestinal infections. In our study, the gastrointestinal
microbiomes of pediatric and adolescent patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia were profiled by 16S rDNA gene
sequencing before and during a chemotherapy course and com-
pared with equivalent 16S rDNA data from their healthy siblings.
The microbiome profiles of patients before chemotherapy and the
control group were dominated by members of the genera Bacter-
oides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium, with these having mean
relative abundances of 62.2%, 7.3%, and 6.4% respectively, in
the patient group, and 40.2%, 12.2%, and 8.3% respectively,
in the control group. Microbiome diversity, measured as the
Shannon diversity index, of the patient group was significantly
lower than that of the sibling control group, and discriminatory
taxa included Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococ-
cus, all of which had lower relative abundance in the disease
group. This study is another example illustrating the potential for
use of microbiome signatures that are associated with disease
onset and progression to develop noninvasive approaches in
cancer diagnosis.
Continued evaluation of the mechanisms used by microbes
to trigger diseases will also enable the identification of thera-
peutic approaches, including the use of pre- and probiotics to
restore a healthy microbiome and possibly to offset some of the

 impacts of toxic therapies. It has also been shown in murine
models that commensal microbiota modulate the efficacy of
anticancer therapy through the immune response. Loss of the
microbiome decreased TNF expression, decreased proinflam-
matory cytokines, and reduced the production of reactive
oxygen species, leading to impaired tumor regression and
survival (92). Loss of the microbiome was also shown to reduce
the stimulation of pathogenic Th 17 cells and eliminate che-
motherapy effectiveness. Therefore, the efficacy of treatment
may be improved through combined anticancer therapy with
probiotics. When combined with novel approaches to vaccine
design through synthetic biology, there are several opportu-
nities for decreasing cancer incidence as a result of understand-
ing our microbiome.
In this minireview, we presented a brief overview of recent
history and advances that have been made with respect to under-
standing our microbiome and the development or correlation
with cancer and future avenues of research that will be beneficial
to this space, including the development of novel diagnostics,
vaccines, and other therapeutic approaches to treatment.
