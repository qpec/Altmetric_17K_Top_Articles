Abstract
Background: The popularity of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) in Europe has been high for decades. We aimed
to assess whether a country’s performance in the ESC is associated with life satisfaction and suicide mortality in
European countries.
Methods: We analysed nationally representative Eurobarometer survey data on life satisfaction from 33 European
countries (N = 162,773) and country-level standardised suicide mortality data for years 2009 to 2015. The associations
of winning the Contest, performing terribly, and higher final ranking with life satisfaction and suicide rates were all
assessed.
Results: Winning the ESC was not statistically significantly associated with increased life satisfaction or suicide rates,
although every ten-place increase in final ranking was associated with an increase in life satisfaction (adjusted odds
ratios [aOR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.05) and a decrease in suicide mortality rates (β = − 0.30; 95%
CI: -0.59 to − 0.01). Terrible performance was associated with greater life satisfaction compared to not competing at
all (aOR 1.13; 95%CI: 1.07 to 1.20).
Conclusion: The good news for participating countries is that just competing at the ESC is associated with higher
life satisfaction among the population. As improved performance is linked to Ooh Aah Just a Little Bit of improved
life satisfaction, further research into how such international competitions may impact public health is needed.
Background
The annual Eurovision Song Contest (ESC, hereafter “The
Contest”) is a seminal event for both music lovers and
haters everywhere. Established in 1956, is one of the
longest-running TV shows in the world, and firmly
embedded in the consciousness of populations worldwide,
especially in Europe [1]. Each participating country’s entry
is ranked by a combination of votes from national juries
and audience. The format of the Contest changed in 2004
and semi-finals were introduced in order to accommodate
the increased number of participating countries. Some
countries are thus eliminated in the semi-finals, while the
remainder (usually 24–27 countries) join the large countries
which have a guaranteed place in the final thanks to their
large monetary contributions to the European Broadcasting
Union (EBU) [1]. Each country awards points to the ten
highest ranked entries giving the famous “douze points” (i.e.
12 points) to the entry that receives the most votes. Some
viewers, such as the British, are more familiar with the
infamous, albeit grammatically troublesome, “nil points”.
The contest is very popular in Europe. EBU, organisers of
the event, announced that the 2016 shows reached a total
of 204 million viewers across 42 markets, with audience
shares as high as 95.3% -in music-loving Iceland, where
almost Everybody (entry of Estonia 2001) was watching [2].
The Contest attracts a wide range of individual countries’
talent, including orc-style monsters (Finland 2006), singers
on unicycles (Moldova 2011) and puppet turkeys (Ireland
2008). Entries often feature unusual lyrics such as “Boom
boom
boomerang,
snadderydang,
kangaroo,
boogaloo,
didgeridoo” (Austria, 1977) and “I look over all the maps
trying to escape ‘cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake”

 (Belarus, 2014), which is considered part of the ESC charm.
Not surprisingly, the ESC is considered a seminal event in
certain countries and among some population groups with
winners being hailed as Heroes (Sweden 2015); the major-
ity of the population is aware of the contest, even if they
do not watch it live [3]. The Contest has recently ex-
panded to other continents; Australia has been participat-
ing since 2015.
Large national and international competitions which
attract a lot of interest among the general population may
have unanticipated consequences. The associations be-
tween major sporting events and suicides and homicides,
[4] reported happiness in the general public, [4, 5] and
cardiovascular events [6] have been researched, although
the causal nature of these associations is debatable. The
ESC, beyond being a major international event, is further
influenced by political and socioeconomic factors, [3, 7]
therefore it is reasonable to consider that it may have a
similar impact. However, the literature on the potential
impact of international music events on such outcomes is
limited; to the authors’ knowledge, no study has assessed
the association between ESC -or any other similar music
event- and life satisfaction, mental health or suicide. A
potential association with specific diseases would have
obvious implications for public health, but the same can
be argued for outcomes such as life satisfaction. Life satis-
faction has been linked with both mental disorders and
physical health, mortality and morbidity [8–13]. Therefore
it can serve as a general indicator of population health.
Considering the popularity and perceptions of importance
of the ESC among the European population, [3] we
hypothesized that performance in the ESC may have an
impact on life satisfaction and mental health.
Methods
Data sources and measures
Individual level data were collected through a series of
waves of the Eurobarometer survey which covers European
Union (EU) member states and occasionally other European
countries [14]. We used waves that included a question on
life satisfaction and were conducted in the period immedi-
ately after the ESC finals, i.e. May–June of the respective
year. The total sample size of the repeated cross-sectional
waves 71.2 (2009), 73.5 (2010), 75.4 (2011), 77.4 (2012), 79.4
(2013), 81.4 (2014) and 83.4 (2015) was 198,008 individuals
from 33 countries (all 28 EU member states, Turkey, the
Former
Yugoslavian
Republic
of
Macedonia,
Serbia,
Montenegro and Iceland).
The multi-stage sampling methodology was consistent
across all waves. Primary sampling units (PSU) were
selected from each region of each country, proportional to
population size. In each PSU, a sample of starting addresses
was randomly selected, and households were systematically
selected through a standard random route starting from
these addresses. Post-stratification and population size
weighting were applied, resulting in samples aged ≥15 years
nationally representative in terms of age, sex and area of
residence [15]. All data is self-reported and collected
through face-to-face interviews. Participants in each survey
wave are independently sampled, which means that there is
no longitudinal sample across multiple years.
Life satisfaction was assessed with the question “On the
whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very
satisfied or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?”
Responses were grouped into “very satisfied” and “not very
satisfied” (fairly satisfied; not very; or not at all satisfied).
Eurobarometer surveys also collected data on participants’
age (15–24; 25–34; 35–44; 45–54; 55–64; and ≥ 65 years),
sex (male; female), occupation (employed; houseperson;
student; unemployed; and retired), age at which they
stopped full-time education: (≤15; 16–19 and ≥ 20 years
old), marital status (married or living with partner; single;
divorced; widowed; and other), area of residence (urban;
rural) and their difficulties to pay bills during the last 12
months (almost never/never; and from time to time/most
of the time).
Country-level
data
for
years
2009
to
2015
were
extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
European Health for all Database (HFA-DB) [16]. We
extracted data on real gross domestic product (GDP
Purchasing Power Parity in US dollars [PPP$] per capita);
total health expenditure (PPP$ per capita); unemployment
(%) as a proportion of the active population; as well as
age-standardized death rate from suicide and self-inflicted
injury (SDR per 100,000 population) in the entire popula-
tion and separately among males and females.
Data on each country’s performance in the ESC were
extracted from the webpage www.EurovisionWorld.com
which includes a fan-made “complete database of all the
songs, lyrics and votes from all the history of Eurovision”
[17]. Since 2004, when the semi-finals were introduced,
24–27 countries compete in the final. For these countries,
we recorded their final rank. Countries which did not
qualify from the semi-finals were all assigned one place
lower than the last contestant in the final; for example, if
the final consisted of 25 countries, all eliminated countries
were considered to have been ranked 26th. Rank was
scaled to show results for a ten-unit increase. Finally, con-
testants that took the 20th or lower place were classified
as having had a “terrible” performance on that year.
Statistical analyses
We conducted two analyses using life satisfaction as an
outcome: first to assess the impact of final performance
and winning, and second to assess whether terrible per-
formance was better than not competing at all.
A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted, with
country as the higher level of analysis. This model accounts
Filippidis and Laverty BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:582 
Page 2 of 6
 for clustering of observations within each country and
hence allows us to explore changes in life satisfaction
within countries over the time period we have studied.
Being very satisfied with the life they lead was the outcome
variable. Independent variables included final rank in the
ESC and being a winner of the contest, adjusted for GDP
per capita, unemployment rate in the country, age, sex, area
of residence, occupation, education, difficulty paying bills,
marital status and a linear term for time (calendar year) to
account for underlying trends in life satisfaction. We also
stratified these analyses by sex – women have won the ESC
more than twice as much as men, [18] which may be
expected to result in differential effects between sexes.
A separate multilevel logistic regression was fitted in the
subset of observations (i.e. country-years) that did not
participate in the contest or performed terribly, to com-
pare the potential effect of a terrible performance in ESC
relative to not participating at all. Life satisfaction was the
outcome and a variable for terrible performance (versus
no participation) was the main independent variable; the
model was adjusted for the same variables as above.
We also conducted ecological analyses of country-level
suicide rates to assess if potential associations hold for
mental health indicators as well. A longitudinal fixed-
effects linear regression model was fitted to capture poten-
tial associations of success in the ESC with standardised
suicide mortality in the total population and separately
among males and females within each country. The fixed-
effects specification controls for country-level unobserved
factors that could be associated with independent variables,
which allows us to estimate associated changes between
independent and outcome variables within countries over
time, but not between-country associations. The analysis
was conducted at a country level and independent variables
included final rank in the ESC, being a winner of the
contest, GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita, and
unemployment. A linear variable for time (calendar year)
was also included in the model. Separate models were used
to assess terrible performance versus not competing.
Results
After excluding observations from countries and years
that did not participate in the ESC, we had individual
level data for n = 162,773 respondents from 33 coun-
tries. Winning the contest was not significantly associ-
ated with self-reported life satisfaction (adjusted odds
ratio [aOR] = 1.05; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.98 to
1.12). However, the aOR of reporting high life satisfac-
tion was 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.05) for every 10 places
of better performance in the ESC among the entire
sample, controlling for time, sociodemographic and
macro-economic factors (Table 1). When we stratified
by gender, results were very similar. Having performed
terribly in the ESC (n = 115,520) was associated with
higher odds of reporting high life satisfaction compared
to not participating in the contest at all (aOR = 1.13;
95% CI: 1.07 to 1.20), a finding that was consistent
among both men and women (Table 2).
Our ecological analyses had country-level data for 43
countries of the European region of the WHO, which par-
ticipated at least once in the ESC between 2009 and 2015.
The final rank in the ESC was associated with lower SDR
(per 100,000) from suicide and self-inflicted injury in both
the total population (β = − 0.30; 95% CI: -0.59 to − 0.01 per
ten places) and males (β = − 0.54; 95% CI: -1.05 to − 0.37),
but not in females (β = − 0.09; 95% CI: -0.24 to 0.06)
(Table 3). On the contrary, winning the ESC was not statis-
tically significantly associated with SDR from suicide.
When comparing countries that performed terribly with
those that did not participate at all (Table 4), there was no
statistically significant difference in SDR from suicide.
Discussion
We found that although winning the Eurovision Song
Contest was not associated with improved life satisfaction
or decreased mortality from suicide, a country’s overall
performance was associated with Ooh Aah Just a Little Bit
(UK 1996) of an improvement in life satisfaction and a
decline in SDR from suicide. Better performance was asso-
ciated with higher odds of being very satisfied in both

 men and women. Performing terribly in the Contest was
associated with increased life satisfaction compared to not
participating at all.
Ranking in the ESC may reflect the international
position of a country within the world. It has been found
that there are clusters of countries which exchange votes
year after year, based on cultural, geographic, economic
and political factors [19–21]. The Contest has even been
studied as a “friendship” network [22]. Nevertheless, it is
a complex and constantly changing network and it is
hard to disentangle the factors influencing this [23, 24].
Thus, performance in the ESC might be a reflection of
alliances with other countries, as well as of the political
and economic conditions in the country. Therefore, ESC
success could be a proxy of favourable socioeconomic
conditions, which in turn can create Euphoria (Sweden
2012) and positively influence life satisfaction and men-
tal health. Eurovision is a stage where representations of
the participating nations can reach a wide international
audience [7] hence the performance in the contest may
be
perceived
as
a
judgment
–by
an
international
audience- of nationally defining characteristics, which
are commonly part of the performance, even if they are
sometimes
hidden
behind
glitter
and
cheeky
Wild
Dances (Ukraine 2004). A large proportion of the ESC
audience Believe (Russia 2008) that voting has at least
some geopolitical element [3]. Consequently, ESC suc-
cess may be perceived as a sign of a country’s strength at
the international stage.
On the other hand, doing well in competitions might
increase productivity among the supporters of the con-
testants. For example, there is some evidence that both
productivity and per capita income increase in the host
city of the winning team of the Super Bowl, one of the
largest sports events in the world [25] and that winning
the FIFA World Cup might be beneficial for tourism
[26]. More than that, better than expected performance
in major sports events may raise levels of happiness
among the supporters [5]. If doing well in the ESC has a
similar beneficial impact, it is not a surprise that, follow-
ing a successful performance in the ESC, life satisfaction
levels Rise like a Phoenix (Austria 2014). In our study,
being the Number One (Greece 2005) in the competition
did not have an additional effect on neither suicides nor
life satisfaction, which is consistent with findings from
sports performance in the United States [4].
ESC songs get considerable airtime, especially around
the time of the Contest. A good song can provide a
moment of (Hard Rock) Hallelujah (Finland 2006) for
people and improve their quality of life. However, songs
performed in the Contest are not usually considered of
high quality, which makes this explanation seem like a
Fairytale (Norway 2009) to the authors. It is telling that
only about one in five people watch the ESC because
they like the actual music [3]. Additionally, the Contest
only takes place once a year and hence the songs get
limited airtime during the rest of the year.
We found that participating in the ESC and doing
badly is better than not participating at all. Thus, there
is no public health risk in taking part, as even an abys-
mal performance would be better than complete absence
from the contest. This may be particularly important for
the United Kingdom, where a “Eurovision Brexit” is
gaining support in response to the country’s consistently
terrible performances [3]. Our findings suggest that, if
there is an underlying causal link between ESC perform-
ance and life satisfaction, in the unlikely event that the
UK performs well in the ESC, life satisfaction in the
country would significantly improve, but even being the
Cry Baby (UK 2003) of the Contest has more public
health benefits than Running Scared (Azerbaijan 2011)
away from it. Life satisfaction has been associated with
lower mortality and morbidity and has been found to
have

health

 problems [8, 11–13]. Such public health gains Don’t
Come Easy (Australia 2017), therefore Australia’s recent
participation in the ESC or the money which the UK
pays to the European Broadcasting Union to ensure a
place in the final every year may represent good value
for money for the public, although the cost-effectiveness
of these investments should be further explored.
To our knowledge this is the first study to estimate
the association between the ESC and life satisfaction.
The availability of individual level data and the large
sample
size
allowed
us
to
adjust
for
potentially
confounding factors; therefore, the authors believe that
despite the cross-sectional design of the Eurobarometer
surveys, they won’t meet their Waterloo (Sweden 1974)
if they make a cautious attempt to hypothesize that there
may
be
a
causal
association.
However,
the
cross-
sectional design of our study precludes any conclusions
of causal nature. Even if there was a causal association,
the fact that the surveys were conducted shortly after
the ESC each year would only allow us to detect short-
term effects. Also, we did not take into account the
order of appearance; songs appearing towards the end
are more likely to receive favourable evaluations [19, 27].
When exploring the association of ESC success with life
satisfaction, we only considered country of residence,
when it is an established fact that immigrants can play
an important role in Eurovision voting, [21, 22] and
therefore they might support and be influenced by en-
tries from their home country. The prevalence of mental
health disorders, including depression, varies among
European countries, [28]; however, we used statistical
approaches that account for such country-level variation.
Finally, the ecological analysis is subject to ecological
fallacy, even though the results were quite consistent
between individual and country level analyses.
This study has quantified the potential benefits to life
satisfaction and suicide mortality from performance in
the ESC. Further research would be required to identify
the Secret Combination (Greece 2008) of factors associ-
ated with improved performance. This may allow an
informed discussion regarding the potential role of such
issues in public health.
Conclusion
The good news for any country entering the ESC is that it
is not necessary to win to achieve improvements in the
population’s life satisfaction; even competing at all is asso-
ciated with higher life satisfaction among the population,
while leaving can bring Only Teardrops (Denmark 2013).
Better performance seems to be linked to Ooh Aah Just a
Little Bit of improved life satisfaction. Our findings
highlight the potential association between popular events,
such as the ESC, and outcomes of public health interest.
Although more research into the topic is required to
confirm this association and its nature, it is generally
important to consider the unintended consequences of
events that reach a wide audience. Mental health can be
influenced by multiple factors, a complexity that is often
ignored when considering changes at the population level.
Our study shows that the meaning of Health-in-all-pol-
icies [29] may extend beyond what is normally considered
public health domain.
