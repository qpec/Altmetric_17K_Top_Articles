fter many years of limited therapeutic opportunities, the treatment of type 2 diabetes has become more target and pathophysiologically 
driven. A typical example is represented by the development of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, allowing for more 
physiological regulation of the endocrine pancreas and leading to a previously unmet risk-to-benefit balance. Vildagliptin, one of 
the earliest DPP-4 inhibitors, has been tested across the entire spectrum of type 2 diabetes and has been in clinical use for 20 years. This 
publication critically reviews the main steps in the clinical development of this agent.

Until the turn of the century, treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 
diabetes was limited to two main classes of drugs: sulphonylureas 
and biguanides. Though belonging to two distinct classes, these drugs 
shared two main characteristics: the first one is that they have been 
used to lower blood glucose much longer, before their mode of action 
could be understood; the second is that they both were the result 
of serendipitous discovery. In more recent years, through improved 
understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, better drugs 
have been developed to target the specific mechanisms that are 
responsible for hyperglycaemia, thus providing a more physiological 
approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. A typical example has 
been the development of inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-
4) enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for the degradation of many
peptides, including incretins, hormones released by endocrine cells
in the intestine in response to the ingestion of a meal. Specific DPP-
4 inhibitors have been developed because of the appreciation of the
critical role played by the incretins, and in particular, glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1), in the regulation of glucose-dependent stimulation of 
insulin and glucagon secretion, and the potential reduced production of 
GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells in hyperglycaemic individuals. Under these 
circumstances, DPP-4 inhibition ensures persistence of endogenously
secreted GLP-1 in the systemic circulation. A vast body of literature
and many clinical trials have set the basis for the current clinical use
of these drugs. These studies have lent the evidence of their efficacy
and good tolerability profile. Because of this evidence, DPP-4 inhibitors
have become the standard of care and more often used as second-line 
treatment upon metformin failure or as initial therapy in people with
metformin intolerance. Among the DPP-4 inhibitors, vildagliptin is an
orally available, small-molecule, competitive reversible DPP-4 inhibitor
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is currently used in more than
132 countries around the world, and it celebrates its 20th year in the
diabetes pharmacopeia. Over the last two decades, the flexibility and
efficacy of vildagliptin, and other DPP-4 inhibitors, have been tested
in many clinical conditions with particular references to patients at
higher risk, including the elderly, those with impaired kidney function,
and those on insulin treatment. With respect to this, the development
programme of vildagliptin and its assessment in the clinical setting
remains unique among DPP-4 inhibitors, particularly with respect to
the two extremes of the curve of the natural history of diabetes, that
is, the time of the diagnosis of diabetes and the most advanced stages

as it can occur in elderly people. VERIFY (NCT01528254) is a unique 
trial designed to determine durability, over a pre-specified 5-year 
follow-up, of early use of vildagliptin in combination with metformin 
in individuals at diagnosis or very short duration of disease and mild 
elevation of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The results of the study 
will set the reference bar for any future clinical trial exploring early 
intensive treatment. INTERVAL (Individualised treatment targets for 
elderly patients with type 2 diabetes using vildagliptin add-on or 
lone therapy) is the only study so far exploring the potential of DPP-4 
inhibitors for target setting in elderly patients. These and all the other 
clinical studies are discussed in the following articles, providing the 
reader with all the elements for critical appreciation of vildagliptin as a 
valuable therapeutic option across the whole spectrum of the disease, 
i.e., from those with newly diagnosed diabetes to those progressively 
aging, as well as those living longer with their disease than they ever 
lived without diabetes.
