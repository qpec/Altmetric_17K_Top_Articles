 Medicare Spending on Brand-name Combination Medications
vs Their Generic Constituents
Chana A. Sacks, MD, MPH; ChangWon C. Lee; Aaron S. Kesselheim, MD, JD, MPH; Jerry Avorn, MD
IMPORTANCE Brand-name combination drugs can be more expensive than the sum of their
components, especially when the constituent products are available as generic medications.
The potential savings that could be achieved using generic components is not known.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the additional cost to Medicare of prescribing brand-name
combination medications instead of generic constituents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis for 2011 through 2016 using the
Medicare data set of Part D beneficiaries prescribed any of the 1500 medications that
accounted for the highest total spending in 2015. Brand-name combination drugs that had
identical or therapeutically equivalent generic constituents were included.
EXPOSURES Brand-name, oral combination medications with constituents available either as
generic drugs or therapeutically equivalent generic substitutes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The estimated difference between the amount spent by
Medicare on brand-name combination drugs and the estimated amount that would have
been spent on substitutable generic components.
RESULTS Among the 1500 medications evaluated, 29 brand-name combination medications
were separated into 3 mutually exclusive categories: constituents available as generic
medications at identical doses (n = 20), generic constituents at different doses (n = 3),
and therapeutically equivalent generic substitutes (n = 6). For the constituents available
as generic medications at identical doses category, total spending by Medicare in 2016
on the brand-name combination products was $303 million and the estimated spending for
the generic constituents would have been $68 million, which is an estimated difference of
$235 million. For the generic constituents at different doses category, total spending by
Medicare in 2016 on the brand-name combination products was $232 million and the
estimated spending for the generic constituents would have been $13 million, which is an
estimated difference of $219 million. For the therapeutically equivalent generic substitutes
category, total spending by Medicare in 2016 on the brand-name combination products was
$491 million and the estimated spending for the generic constituents would have been
$20 million, which is an estimated difference of $471 million. In 2016, the estimated spending
for the generic constituents for these 29 drugs would have been $925 million less than the
estimated spending for the brand-name combinations. For the 10 most costly combination
products available during the entire study period, the listed Medicare spending could have
been an estimated $2.7 billion lower between 2011 and 2016 if the generic constituents
had been prescribed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In 2016, the difference between the amount that the
Medicare drug benefit program reported spending on brand-name combination medications
and the estimated spending for generic constituents for the same number of doses was
$925 million. Promoting generic substitution and therapeutic interchange through prescriber
education and more rational substitution policies may offer important opportunities to
achieve substantial savings in the Medicare drug benefit program.

 T
he United States spends more per capita on prescrip-
tion medications than other industrialized nations, and
high drug costs are of increasing concern for patients,
prescribers, policy makers, and payers.1-3 Because brand-
name drugs make up the vast majority of US drug spending,
using equally safe and effective lower-cost generic drugs rep-
resents an important opportunity to reduce unnecessary
expenditures.4,5 This may be particularly important in the case
of fixed-dose combination products.
One study of prescribing within a single, large national in-
surance system found that nearly 569 000 patients filled pre-
scriptions for fixed-dose combination products to treat car-
diovascular disease in 2012.6 Often promoted as providing
increased convenience for patients,7,8 combination products
are sometimes more expensive than the sum of their constitu-
entparts,9-11particularlywhenbrand-namecombinationprod-
ucts are made from medications available as lower-cost ge-
neric drugs. As with other medications in the United States,
the prices for these combination products are not deter-
mined by the magnitude of any incremental clinical benefit or
theamountinvestedinresearch,development,orclinicaltrials;
rather, initial prices are set by the manufacturer.1,12,13 The Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is prevented from
negotiating prices with manufacturers on behalf of indi-
vidual Part D plans and the plans are required by law to pay
for all products in the following protected drug classes: im-
munosuppressants, antineoplastics, antiretrovirals, antipsy-
chotics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants.14,15
The total cost to patients and payers of using expensive
combination products in place of lower-cost generic constitu-
ents is not known. Using a data set made publicly available by
the CMS, this study sought to estimate the annual incremen-
tal costs of using brand-name combination products com-
pared with lower-cost generic constituents among Medicare
Part D beneficiaries.
Methods
Data Set
The Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Event data set used rep-
resents reported drug expenditures for the approximately 70%
ofbeneficiariesenrolledintheMedicaredrugbenefitplanfrom
2011 through 2016.16 Citing privacy concerns, the CMS ex-
cludedanydrugrecordsforprescriptionmedicationsforwhich
there were fewer than 50 claims in 2016 or 10 or fewer claims
within a calendar year between 2011 and 2015. The CMS does
not require a data use agreement to access these deidentified
data, and because this analysis was based on publicly avail-
able data and involved no individual patient health records,
institutional review board approval was not required.17
Cohort Creation
First, 1500 medications were identified that accounted for the
highest total spending reported by Medicare in 2015 (Figure 1).
Second, all oral brand-name fixed-dose combination medica-
tions were identified for which all constituents of the combi-
nation product had an active ingredient that was either avail-
ableasageneric,asanover-the-counterproduct,orasageneric
in the same class. In the case of a class-based (therapeutically
equivalent) substitute, we reviewed the literature (including
relevant society guidelines) to ensure there was no evidence
of a substantial difference in clinical benefit with the use of
one product compared with another.
In addition, questions about the clinical use of specific
medications were reviewed with relevant subspecialty con-
tent experts. We excluded any medications with fewer than
500 total beneficiaries in 2015. By including only oral medi-
cations, we excluded medications that incorporated devices
such as an inhaler.
Variable Extraction
From the Medicare data set, the brand-name of each prescrip-
tion medication was extracted along with its constituent parts,
the number of beneficiaries prescribed each drug, the drug-
specific total annual spending reported by Medicare, the num-
ber of units (eg, tablets) dispensed, and a claim-weighted mean
price per dosage unit of the medication. In this data set, total
spending includes amounts paid by the Medicare Part D plan
as well as beneficiary payments, which vary depending on de-
cisions made at the level of each Part D plan administrator.
For each combination drug, we defined its constituents.
A claim-weighted mean price per unit was then extracted from
the data set. For potentially substitutable over-the-counter
medications (eg, acetaminophen) that were not available as in-
dividual products in the Medicare data set, an average phar-
macy price from GoodRx.com (an online pharmaceutical price
aggregator) was used.18,19
Outcomes and Data Analysis
The amount Medicare reported spending in 2016 for each
brand-name combination product was compared with the es-
timated amount that would have been spent had constituent
genericmedicationsbeenprescribedinsteadforthesamenum-
ber of total doses. We also calculated the change in mean price
for each combination product between 2011 and 2016. For
medications that became available after 2011, we calculated
the change in price between the year for which the data were
first available and 2016.
Key Points
Question What is the annual incremental cost to the Medicare
Part D drug benefit program of using brand-name combination
products instead of their generic components?
Findings In this retrospective analysis of Medicare Part D
expenditures, the difference between the amount Medicare
reported spending in 2016 on 29 brand-name combination
products and the estimated spending for their generic
constituents for the same number of doses would have been
$925 million, which includes $235 million if generic products had
been prescribed at the same doses, $219 million using generic
substitution at different doses, and $471 million from substitution
of similar generic medications in the same therapeutic class.
Meaning Generic substitution and therapeutic interchange may
offer important opportunities to achieve substantial savings.

 The brand-name combination drugs were divided into the
3 mutually exclusive categories: constituents available as ge-
neric medications at identical doses, generic constituents at
different doses, and therapeutically equivalent generic sub-
stitutes. For the 10 medications with the highest total spend-
ing in 2015 for which data were available for all years be-
tween 2011 and 2016, we calculated the cumulative amount
that Medicare reported spending during that 6-year period and
estimated the amount that would have been spent substitut-
ing generic products at their Medicare-reported prices.
Measures of variability could not be provided for the es-
timates reported because the main data set provides a single
listed price for the combination product and a single price for
each generic constituent. All costs were expressed in 2016 US
dollars and account for medical inflation. The medical infla-
tion rate was obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Manufacturers sometimes provide Medicare with re-
bates off the list price for costly medications, but neither the
CMS nor the manufacturer discloses the amount of such re-
bates for individual medications. The CMS has released a sum-
mary report that lists rebate amounts paid in 2014 and is ag-
gregated by therapeutic drug class.20
We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate how such
rebates might affect potential savings during this 6-year pe-
riod, assuming rebates of 0% (base case), 17.5% (the overall re-
bate rate reported by Medicare for brand-name drugs in 2014),
and 26.3% (the highest rebate rate reported by Medicare for
any therapeutic class in 2014). No rebates were assumed for
generic medications. Calculations were performed using Excel
software version 16.1 (Microsoft).

For the 3 brand-name combination drugs in the category of
havinggenericconstituentsatdifferentdoses(eg,Treximet,for
the treatment of migraine headaches, contains 85 mg of su-
matriptan but sumatriptan is only available as an individual
product in doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg), the total spending re-
ported by Medicare in 2016 for the brand-name combination
products was $232 million and the estimated spending for the
generic constituents would have been $13 million, which is an
estimated difference of $219 million. An example from this cat-
egory is Duexis, which is a combination of ibuprofen (800 mg)
and the histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine (26.6 mg).
In 2016, the Medicare-reported price was $20.26 per pill com-
pared with a total of $0.28 for generic ibuprofen and famoti-
dine (available in doses of 20 mg and 40 mg). For the 5907 ben-
eficiaries prescribed Duexis in 2016, the estimated potential
reduction in reported spending could have been $23.4 million.

 For the 6 brand-name combination products in the cat-
egory of having therapeutically equivalent generic substi-
tutes, the total spending reported by Medicare in 2016 for the
brand-name combination products was $491 million and the
estimated spending for the generic constituents would have
been $20 million, which is an estimated difference of $471 mil-
lion. An example from this category is the antihypertensive
medication Edarbyclor, which is a combination of the angio-
tensin receptor blocker azilsartan (Edarbi) and chlorthali-
done and was priced at $5.36 per pill in 2016. If the generic an-
giotensin receptor blocker losartan had been substituted for
azilsartan and prescribed with chlorthalidone, the cost would
have been $0.94 per pill. For the 11 805 beneficiaries pre-
scribed Edarbyclor in 2016, the estimated potential reduc-
tion in reported spending could have been $11 million.
Cumulative Estimated Reduction in Spending
Adding these 3 categories together, data on expenditures re-
ported by the Medicare drug benefit program indicate that the
estimated difference between the amount spent on the brand-
name combination products and the prices of individual ge-
neric or over-the-counter drugs if used for the same number

$925 million lower if generic products had been prescribed
at the same doses ($235 million), at different doses ($219 mil-
lion), and if therapeutically equivalent generic medications
had been prescribed ($471 million). For the 10 most costly
brand-name combination drugs, the cumulative potential
reduction in spending between 2011 and 2016 was esti-
mated at $2.7 billion. Taking into account possible re-
bates from manufacturers at the average rate reported by
Medicare, potential savings would have been estimated at
$2.1 billion in total.

 Combination products reduce a patient’
s pill burden, and
in theory can improve adherence. However, a clear connec-
tionbetweencombinationproducts,improvedadherence,and
improved clinical outcomes has not been solidly established.
The FOCUS Project tested the benefits of a polypill combin-
ing aspirin, simvastatin, and ramipril compared with the 3
drugs given separately to prevent cardiovascular events. The
combination product resulted in a modest improvement in ad-
herence (41.0% in the control group compared with 50.8% in
the polypill group, P = .02), though no difference was found
in mean blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol level during the 9 months of follow-up.21 A 2017 Cochrane
review concluded that the benefits of combination products
onmortalityorcardiovasculareventswereuncertain.22Incon-
trast, the larger co-payments that are often seen with more ex-
pensive products have been demonstrated to reduce adher-
ence and worsen clinical outcomes.23,24
A substantial potential reduction in spending would have
been associated with the 6 combination products for which in-
class generic therapeutic substitution was possible. Four com-
binations incorporated a brand-name angiotensin receptor
blocker, which is a class with similar clinical effects.25,26 The
other 2 therapeutic substitutions would have exchanged
omeprazole for esomeprazole (in Vimovo) and finasteride for
dutasteride (in Jalyn).
Meta-analyses have not found significant differences in ef-
ficacy for symptom relief among patients taking different pro-
ton pump inhibitors.27,28 Similarly, an evaluation of dutaste-
ride and finasteride found no compelling data to suggest
efficacy differences between the 2 drugs.29
For pharmaceutical manufacturers, creating new brand-
name combination products offers an opportunity to extend
market exclusivity.30 In an analysis of US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration approvals of fixed-dose combination products
over 3 decades, Hao et al31 found that manufacturers tend to
market combination products “shortly before the generic ver-
sion of the single active ingredient drug enters the US mar-
ket.” The number of combination drugs approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration that contain drugs already on
the market has been increasing steadily from an average of 1.2
approvals of such drugs per year in the 1980s to 2.5 per year
in the 1990s, 5.9 per year in the 2000s, and 7 per year from
2010 through 2012.31
Nuedexta was the only combination drug studied with an
activeingredientconstituent(quinidine)notavailableinadose
that was similar or identical to the dose used in the combina-
tion product. Approved for the treatment of pseudobulbar
affect based on studies of patients with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis or multiple sclerosis, this drug is often prescribed to
treatagitationamongpatientswithdementiaforwhichitsben-
efit-risk relationship is controversial.32 Quinidine is available
genericallyat200mgratherthanthe10mgusedinNuedexta,33
and it would be impractical to ask patients to split these tab-
lets to achieve this dose. However, this brand-name drug con-
tributes $189 million to the potential spending differential in
2016, and Nuedexta is a compelling example of the price dif-
ferential between a recently introduced brand-name combi-
nation and its constituent parts.
Prior studies have evaluated the difference in costs be-
tween combination products and their constituents for some
specific categories such as antihypertensive medications.10 In
apriorstudybasedon2004spendingdata,out-of-pocketcosts
for24ofthe27combinationproductsweresubstantiallyhigher
than the cost for the generic constituents; however, the total
costs were lower for the combination products on average.
The different results in this study may reflect that prices
of brand-name drugs have increased considerably in recent
years, whereas generic prices continue to decrease. This study
also included drugs from among the 1500 most costly to Medi-
care, identifying a subset of brand-name products with the
greatest potential for substantial savings.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the CMS is prohib-
ited from publicly disclosing rebate amounts for individual
drugs; however, recent data on aggregate rebate amounts al-
low reasonable estimates of prices after rebates.
Second, the prices are an average-weighted price by dose;
a direct comparison of identical doses was not available. This
is unlikely to have a substantial effect on these findings be-
cause commonly used doses or those very close to them were
used in all but 1 of the combination drugs studied.
Third, this analysis assumed that substitution was pos-
sible in all cases. For small subsets of patients, there may be
legitimate clinical reasons to use a specific drug rather than
using therapeutic substitution.34 From this data set, we can-
notdetermineifpatientshadpreviouslytriedanygenericprod-
ucts before being switched.

dollars, accounting for medical inflation. Excludes Nuedexta, given that dose
differences make it impractical for a clinician to have made that substitution.
a The blue curve represents Medicare-reported expenditures (black curve)
minus the value of manufacturer rebates, estimated at 17.5%. The difference
between the blue curve and the estimated expenditures for generic
constituents (orange curve) represents the potential cost savings of $2.1 billion
over 6 years if generic constituents had been used.

 Conclusions
In 2016, the difference between the amount that the Medi-
care drug benefit program reported spending on brand-
name combination medications and the estimated spending
for generic constituents for the same number of doses was
$925 million. Promoting generic substitution and therapeu-
tic interchange through prescriber education and more
rational substitution policies may offer important opportu-
nities to achieve substantial savings in the Medicare drug
benefit program.
