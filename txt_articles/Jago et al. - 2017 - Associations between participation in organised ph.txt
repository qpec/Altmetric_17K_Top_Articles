Objectives To assess the extent to which participation 
in organised physical activity in the school or community 
outside school hours and neighbourhood play was 
associated with children’s physical activity and sedentary 
time.
Design Cross-sectional study.
setting Children were recruited from 47 state-funded 
primary schools in South West England.
Participants 1223 children aged 8–9 years old.
Outcome measures Accelerometer-assessed moderate-
to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and 
sedentary time.
Methods Children wore an accelerometer, and the mean 
minutes of MVPA and sedentary time per day were derived. 
Children reported their attendance at organised physical 
activity in the school or community outside school hours 
and neighbourhood play using a piloted questionnaire. 
Cross-sectional linear and logistic regression were used 
to examine if attendance frequency at each setting (and 
all settings combined) was associated with MVPA and 
sedentary time. Multiple imputation methods were used to 
account for missing data and increase sample size.
results Children who attended clubs at school 3–4 days 
per week obtained an average of 7.58 (95% CI 2.7 to 12.4) 
more minutes of MVPA per day than children who never 
attended. Participation in the three other non-school-based 
activities was similarly associated with MVPA. Evidence for 
associations with sedentary time was generally weaker. 
Associations were similar in girls and boys. When the 
four different contexts were combined, each additional 
one to two activities participated in per week increased 
participants’ odds (OR: 1.18, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.25) of 
meeting the government recommendations for 60 min of 
MVPA per day.
Conclusion Participating in organised physical activity at 
school and in the community is associated with greater 
physical activity and reduced sedentary time among both 
boys and girls. All four types of activity contribute to overall 
physical activity, which provides parents with a range of 
settings in which to help their child be active.
IntrODuCtIOn
Physical activity is associated with improved 
mental well-being, reduced risk of obesity 
and lower blood pressure among children.1 
Sedentary time may also be a risk factor for 
non-communicable diseases, but it is not 
clear if this effect is independent of phys-
ical activity.2–4 The UK Chief Medical Offi-
cers recommend that all children and young 
people should engage in at least an hour 
per day of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity 
physical activity (MVPA) and limit sedentary 
time5; however, considerable proportions of 
children do not meet these guidelines.6 For 
example, data from the nationally represen-
tative millennium cohort showed that only 
51% of children 7–8 years old met the recom-
mendation.7 The amount of time children 
spend engaged in MVPA gradually declines

with age, while sedentary time increases.6 8–11 Strategies to 
increase children’s physical activity are needed.
The majority of interventions to increase children’s 
physical activity have been delivered during school 
time.12 13 These interventions have included strategies 
such as changes to the physical education provision and 
new educational programmes based on information 
sharing and personal goal setting.12–14 Overall, these 
programmes have tended to report no effect, weak effects 
or moderate effects in subgroups.12–16 Potential reasons 
for these are the difficulty faced in adding interventions 
to already full school-curricula and the lack of skills and 
training that teachers have for delivering a range of activ-
ities to engage the majority of children.17 As such, there is 
a need to understand the potential of organised physical 
activity outside school hours to increase MVPA.
After-school programmes have the potential to facili-
tate physical activity for children, as schools have space in 
which children can be active, staff who can be trained and 
many parents welcome programmes that provide child-
care.16 18–21 Although a number of studies have exam-
ined the potential of delivering such sessions, it is not 
clear whether attendance at the programmes currently 
provided by schools is associated with higher overall 
levels of MVPA.18–21 There is also a lack of information 
about how attendance at community-based physical 
activity clubs contributes to overall MVPA. Furthermore, 
as not all children attend after-school programmes, it 
is not clear how other activities such as playing in the 
neighbourhood or at home in the garden contribute to 
overall MVPA. A key question, therefore, is whether the 
frequency of participation in organised physical activity in 
the school or community after school hours, neighbour-
hood play or home play is associated with the MVPA and 
sedentary time of children. Since some children will be 
active in all four settings, it would also be informative to 
examine collective participation across all settings.
The aim of this study was to assess among children (8–9 
years of age) the extent to which participation in organ-
ised physical activity in the school or community outside 
school hours, and playing with friends or family near the 
home or in the garden, were associated with MVPA and 
sedentary time. A secondary aim was to examine if there 
was a cumulative association between participation in 
the four different types of activities with both MVPA and 
sedentary time.
MethODs
The current analyses used data from the B-Proact1v study, 
which has been described in detail elsewhere.11 22 23 Briefly, 
the study aimed to examine physical activity behaviours 
of children and their parents over the course of primary 
school. Between 2012 and 2013, data were collected from 
1299 year 1 children (5–6 years of age) from 57 schools 
in Bristol (UK). Between March 2015 and July 2016, all 
57 schools were approached to rejoin the study when the 
children were in year 4 (8–9 years of age), with 47 schools 
agreeing to take part (1223 children). The current anal-
yses used data from the year 4 assessments. The study 
received ethical approval from the School for Policy 
Studies Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol, and 
written parent consent was received from all participants.
Data collection
Data were collected at schools, with children asked to 
complete a brief questionnaire. As indicators of organ-
ised physical activity outside school hours in school and 
in the community, respectively, we asked ‘How often do 
you attend…a) a sport or exercise club at school (NOT 
including PE)? and b) a sport or exercise club at places 
other than your school (like a football club or ballet)?’ 
To indicate neighbourhood play outside and within the 
home we asked ‘How much do you play with your friends 
and family… a) outside near your home? and b) in 
your home or garden?’ These questions each had four 
response options: ‘Never’, ‘1–2 days per week’, ‘3–4 days 
per week’ or ‘5 days per week’. We assigned these 0, 1, 
2 and 3 points, respectively, and summed responses to 
derive an overall activity score ranging from 0 to 12, with 
a higher value indicating a higher frequency of activity 
participation.
Child height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm 
using a SECA Leicester stadiometer (HAB Interna-
tional, Northampton, UK). Weight was recorded to 
the nearest 0.1 kg using a SECA 899 digital scale (HAB 
International). Child body mass index (BMI=kg/m2) 
was then calculated and converted to an age-specific and 
gender-specific SD score.24 25 Children wore a waist-worn 
ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer for 5 days including 
two weekend days. Parents provided demographic infor-
mation via a questionnaire, including child gender and 
date of birth. Where children’s date of birth was missing 
(20.5% of children), they were assigned the median age 
of 9.0 years. Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores, 
based on the English Indices of Deprivation (http:// 
data. 
gov. 
uk/ 
dataset/ 
index- 
of- 
multiple- 
deprivation), 
were 
assigned to each child based on their reported home 
postcode, where higher IMD scores indicate a greater 
level of deprivation.
Accelerometer data reduction
Accelerometer data were processed using Kinesoft 
(V.3.3.75; Kinesoft, Saskatchewan, Canada). At least 
three valid days of data were required for accelerometer 
data to be considered complete for a given child and 
included in analysis, where a valid day was defined as at 
least 500 min of data, after excluding intervals of ≥60 min 
of zero counts, allowing up to 2 min of interruptions. 
We recognise that there is considerable variation in 
the number of minutes of accelerometer data that are 
required to be considered representative of a valid day.26 
These have ranged from 360 min per day, which has been 
used for children 6–8 years old,27 to 800 min, which has 
been used for older children.28 29 Within the field there 
is no consensus on the minimum number of minutes per

day that are needed for a day to be considered valid. We, 
therefore, adopted a 500 min per day threshold to ensure 
that our data are comparable to the methods employed 
by the International Children’s Accelerometer Database,6 
which has pooled data from over 27 000 children across 
20 large global cohorts. The child’s average number of 
sedentary and MVPA minutes per day were derived using 
population-specific cut points for children.30 We also 
derived a binary variable indicating whether the child’s 
average daily MVPA was greater than the 60 min per day 
recommended by the UK government.5
Analysis
The associations of child characteristics (gender, age, 
BMI z-score and IMD) with activity participation were 
examined in the observed data using t-tests, Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients, Χ2 tests and one-way analysis of 
variance as appropriate.
Multiple imputation of missing data was used to create 
20 imputed data sets for the 1223 year 4 children. We used 
20 cycles of regression switching and combined regres-
sion coefficients across data sets using Rubin’s rules.31 
We imputed separately for boys and girls to allow for 
associations to differ by gender. All exposures (organ-
ised physical activity attendance and neighbourhood 
play), outcomes (sedentary time and MVPA), potential 
confounders (gender, age, BMI z-score and IMD) and 
child’s school were included in multiple imputation 
models, and achievement of the MVPA guideline and 
overall activity score was imputed passively. Any children 
with less than three valid days of accelerometer data had 
their accelerometer measures imputed.
We examined the pairwise associations of the activity 
participation variables by dichotomising, cross-tabulating 
and fitting unadjusted logistic regression models of one 
frequency variable on another.
We used linear regression models to examine the 
associations of activity participation and the overall 
activity score with the child’s average sedentary and 
MVPA minutes per day, and logistic regression models 
to examine associations with achievement of the MVPA 
guideline. In model 1 we adjusted for gender and age, 
and in model 2 we adjusted additionally for BMI z-score 
and IMD. To account for the clustering of children in 
schools and the associated potential to underestimate the 
SEs which are used to compute the 95% CIs and p values, 
robust SEs, which took account of the school level clus-
tering, were used for all models. Combined Wald tests 
were used to test for evidence of interaction between the 
child’s gender and the exposure of interest.
We predicted the children’s mean number of sedentary 
and MVPA minutes per day by frequency of participa-
tion in each activity based on linear combinations of the 
regression coefficients from fully adjusted models (model 
2).
Regression analyses were repeated restricting to the 
children who had complete data for all exposures, 
outcomes and covariables, and compared with the 
multiple imputation analysis. We also produced scatter 
plots of sedentary time and MVPA by the overall activity 
score in the observed data.
A sensitivity analysis was performed including acceler-
ometer data for any children who had at least one valid 
day of measures to assess whether only including acceler-
ometer data for children who recorded at least three valid 
days influenced our results. All analyses were performed 
on Stata V.14.0.
results
The distributions of characteristics of the children in the 
observed data, multiple imputation data sets and subset 
with complete information are shown in table 1. All char-
acteristics showed similar distributions in each of the 
data sets and had only a small proportion of missing data 
(maximum 16.1% for accelerometer measures).

Associations of child characteristics with activity 
participation
Online supplementary table S1 shows child activity atten-
dance by gender. Girls tended to report lower frequen-
cies of participating in organised physical activity in the 
school or community outside school hours, and had a 
lower mean overall activity score. There was no gender 
difference in friends/family play either in or outside of 
the home. The associations of other child characteristics 
with activity participation are shown in online supple-
mentary table S2. There was some evidence that children 
who more frequently attended a sport/exercise club 
outside of school had a higher mean age. Child BMI was 
not strongly associated with any particular activity, but 
there was weak evidence that the overall activity score 
decreased with increasing BMI z-score. Children who 
reported attendance of ‘Never’ or ‘5 days/week’ generally 
had the highest IMD scores, suggesting a U-shaped asso-
ciation, and there was a negative correlation between the 
overall activity score and IMD.
 Inter-relationships of activity participation frequencies
Participating in one type of activity more frequently was 
generally associated with a higher frequency of participa-
tion in each of the others, except that attendance at a 
sport/exercise club outside of school was not associated 
with playing outside near the home (online supplemen-
tary table S3).
Associations of activity participation with sedentary time and 
MVPA
There was a negative correlation of the overall activity score 
with sedentary time and a positive correlation between 
the overall activity score and MVPA (online supplemen-
tary figures S1 and S2).

Table 2 shows the mean difference in sedentary time 
by activity participation and overall activity score in 
the multiple imputation data sets, and figure 1 shows 
the predicted sedentary time by activity participation. 
Sedentary time decreased on average with increasing 
frequency of attending sport/exercise clubs either 
at school or outside of school and with increasing 
frequency of playing with friends/family outside near the 
home in regression models adjusted for gender and age 
(model 1). The association between sport/exercise club 
attendance outside of school and sedentary time weak-
ened slightly on additional adjustment for BMI z-score 
and IMD (model 2), but other associations remained. 
An increase in children’s overall activity score was also 
strongly associated with a reduction in sedentary time 
in both models. However, there was no evidence of an 
association between playing with friends/family at home 
and sedentary time. Associations did not differ between 
boys and girls. Findings were similar when restricted to 
children who had complete data (online supplementary 
table S4).
The mean difference in MVPA by each of the activity vari-
ables in the multiple imputation data is shown in table 3, 
with predicted MVPA by activity participation presented 
in figure 2. Higher frequencies of attending sport/exer-
cise clubs either at school or outside of school and of play 
either outside or in the home/garden were all associated 
with greater MVPA on average in models 1 and 2. Asso-
ciations were similar in boys and girls. A higher overall 
activity score was also associated with greater MVPA, with 
some evidence that this association was stronger in boys 
than in girls. Associations were similar when restricted to 
children with complete data (online supplementary table 
S5).

imputation data are shown in table 4. A higher frequency 
of participation in any of the activities, or an increase in 
the overall activity score, was associated with increased 
odds of meeting the government guideline in both 
models. Associations were similar in girls and boys. A unit 
increase in the activity score was associated with around 
an 18% increase in the odds of achieving 60 min of MVPA 
per day. Findings were unchanged when restricting to 
those with complete data (online supplementary table 
S6).
sensitivity analysis
When we changed the inclusion criteria for accelerom-
eter measures from three to one valid day, findings were 
largely unchanged, except that boys showed a stronger 
association between sport/exercise club attendance at 
their school and MVPA than girls (p for interaction=0.03 
in multiple imputation data).
DIsCussIOn
The findings demonstrate that increased participation in 
organised physical activity at school and in the commu-
nity is associated with greater overall physical activity and 
reduced sedentary time among both boys and girls. Specif-
ically, a child who attends a school-based club 3–4 days per 
week obtained 7.8 more minutes of MVPA per day than a 
child who did not attend at all, with attendance of 5 days 
a week at a sport/exercise club outside of school associ-
ated with 9.9 more minutes of MVPA than children who 
never attended clubs. There were comparable patterns 
for engagement in non-organised activity at home or in 
the neighbourhood—both were associated with increased 
MVPA—but only activity outside of the home was asso-
ciated with reduced sedentary time. When the four 
different contexts of physical activity were combined, the 
analyses showed that each additional one to two activities 
participated in per week increased the odds of meeting 
the Chief Medical Officers’ recommendation of 60 min 
of MVPA per day by 18%. Thus, encouraging children to 
attend after-school and community-based physical activity 
clubs, as well as to play at home and in the neighbour-
hood, is critical for helping children to increase MVPA. 
Moreover, in light of the relative consistency in findings 
for each of the four forms of physical activity, the message 
to parents should be that physical activity can be accu-
mulated in all four settings, which allows them to find a 
balance that works for their family. For some families with 
working parents, after-school programmes may be the key 
activity to focus on, whereas for other families encour-
aging children to play in the neighbourhood is likely to 
be useful for maximising physical activity. Furthermore, as 
there was little evidence that play at home was associated 
with a reduction in sedentary time, it is also important 
to examine ways of encouraging non-sedentary activities 
within the home.
The findings in this paper support previous research 
that has shown that introducing extracurricular clubs 
into the school day can promote increased physical 
activity among primary school-aged children.32 The 
study is in broad agreement with the body of work that 
has shown that risky outdoor play and higher indepen-
dent mobility are associated with higher levels of physical

activity among children.33–36 These findings complement 
these bodies of work by showing an additional effect of 
accumulating physical activity across different settings to 
maximise the overall amount of physical activity in which 
children engage.
The UK Childhood Obesity strategy recommends that 
all primary schools should provide at least 30 min per day 
of physical activity opportunities across the curriculum, 
break times and extracurricular activities.37 The data 
presented here show that in the imputed data set, 72.2% of 
year 4 children were attending school-based programmes 
at least once per week and 10.5% were attending 5 days 
per week. Previous research has shown that in the UK, 
after-school clubs for primary school children tend to be 
dominated by team sports, such as football and rugby, 
with limited provision for non-competitive physical activi-
ties.38 Thus, increasing the number and variety of sessions 
that children attend and improving the quality of those 
sessions are likely to provide a cost-effective means of 
increasing children’s physical activity. This hypothesis is 
consistent with the recent theory of expanded, extended 
and enhanced opportunities, which suggests that the most 
effective means of increasing children’s physical activity 
will be provided by extending and expanding current 
provision.19 Thus, schools and community groups should 
be encouraged to extend current after-school provision 
to more children, diversify the activities to interest more 
pupils (preferably involving pupils in deciding what 
activities to offer) and enhance the quality of provision 
to maximise the amount of activity obtained. These rela-
tively simple changes could be made at each school and 
would provide scalable ways for increasing overall levels of 
physical activity and contributing to the UK government’s 
goal of reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity.
strengths and limitations
The major strength of this study is the large sample size 
and provision of detailed information about participa-
tion in four different physical activity settings alongside 
accelerometer-assessed physical activity. In addition, the 
use of multiple imputation models to provide estimates 
for participants with missing data using a robust method-
ology has enabled us to maximise the sample for analysis. 
The study is limited by the cross-sectional design, which 
limits the ability to infer causation between frequency 
of participation in different settings and levels of phys-
ical activity. All questions were self-reported, and it is 
possible that some were recalled more accurately than 
others. Moreover, as the questions used were developed 
for this project, we do not have information on the reli-
ability and validity of the scale. The report of play within 
the home is likely to include both sedentary and physi-
cally active forms of play, as the question included play 
indoors, which could be expected to be more sedentary, 
as well as outdoors in the garden, which is likely to be 
more active. Equally, as the question focused on play with 
friends or family, we do not have any information about 
individual play, and we were unable to disentangle these 
inter-related issues. We also cannot rule out the possibility 
of residual confounding, but have adjusted for several 
key potential confounding variables in order to minimise 
this. The study is also drawn from the greater Bristol area

Participation in organised physical activity at school and in 
the community is associated with greater physical activity 
and reduced sedentary time among both boys and girls. 
In light of the challenges of promoting physical activity 
during school time, parents should encourage children 
to attend after school clubs, attend community activity 
groups and play in the neighbourhood to help their chil-
dren to meet physical activity guidelines. The data show 
that all four types of activity contribute similarly to overall 
physical activity, and there is therefore an opportunity for 
families to find the best mix of options for them.
