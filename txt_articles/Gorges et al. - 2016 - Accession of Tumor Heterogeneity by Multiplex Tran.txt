BACKGROUND: Transcriptome analysis of circulating tu-
mor cells (CTCs) holds great promise to unravel the bi-
ology of cancer cell dissemination and identify expressed
genes and signaling pathways relevant to therapeutic
interventions.
METHODS: CTCs were enriched based on their EpCAM
expression (CellSearch®) or by size and deformability
(ParsortixTM), identified by EpCAM and/or pan-
keratin–specific antibodies, and isolated for single cell
multiplex RNA profiling.
RESULTS: Distinct breast and prostate CTC expression
signatures could be discriminated from RNA profiles
of leukocytes. Some CTCs positive for epithelial tran-
scripts (EpCAM and KRT19) also coexpressed leukocyte/
mesenchymal associated markers (PTPRC and VIM).
Additional subsets of CTCs within individual patients
were characterized by divergent expression of genes
involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (e.g.,
CDH2, MMPs, VIM, or ZEB1 and 2), DNA repair
(RAD51), resistance to cancer therapy (e.g., AR, AR-V7,
ERBB2, EGFR), cancer stemness (e.g., CD24 and
CD44), activated signaling pathways involved in tumor
progression (e.g., PIK3CA and MTOR) or cross talks be-
tween tumors and immune cells (e.g., CCL4, CXCL2,
CXCL9, IL15, IL1B, or IL8).
CONCLUSIONS: Multimarker RNA profiling of single
CTCs reveals distinct CTC subsets and provides impor-
tant insights into gene regulatory networks relevant for
cancer progression and therapy.

Detection and molecular characterization of circulating
tumor cells (CTCs)7 could provide valuable information
for the clinical management of cancer patients because
CTCs represent a real-time snapshot of the current tu-
mor burden (1). Mutational analysis of CTCs might
help to investigate alterations in genes involved in the
response to targeted therapies (2, 3), which supports the
use of CTCs as a “liquid biopsy.”
However, to identify signaling pathways and splice
variants relevant to cancer biology and therapies, tran-
scriptome analysis of viable cancer cells is essential (4).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting keratin19
mRNA (KRT19)8 has been widely used to detect and
monitor CTCs in cancer patients (5, 6). However, single
marker analysis is not sufficient to understand the broad
and complex nature of tumor biology. So far, multiplex
qPCR targeting a few transcripts of interest has been
applied (7, 8). However, most reports have relied on
CTC-enriched fractions that still contain substantial
numbers of contaminating leukocytes. Moreover, analy-

 ses of pooled CTC fractions miss the information on
intrapatient heterogeneity of CTC populations.
Isolation of single CTCs and subsequent RNA anal-
ysis is challenging but the information obtained is much
more extensive with regard to tumor cell heterogeneity in
individual patients. A dual colorimetric RNA in situ hy-
bridization assay was recently used to examine individual
CTCs and tumor cell clusters for the expression of epi-
thelial transcripts and mesenchymal markers (9). Heter-
ogeneous RNA expression of single CTCs has also been
demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer using the
CTC-iChip for CTC isolation that is not commercially
available (10).
In this study we performed single cell analysis after
EpCAM-dependent (CellSearch®, Janssen Diagnostics)
or size-based (ParsortixTM, ANGLE Plc) enrichment.
We established a workflow to screen up to 84 genes spe-
cific for different tumor entities, genes involved in DNA
repair, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor
suppressor genes, therapy-related targets, stem cell-
related markers, transcripts of activated signaling path-
ways, or genes mediating cross talk between tumors and
immune cells.
Materials and Methods
CELL CULTURE
All cells [MDA-MB-468 (MDA-468), MDA-MB-231
(MDA-231), SKBR-3 and MCF7] were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection proposed by the
vendor. Cells were harvested when they reached a con-
fluence of approximately 80%.
PRIMER VALIDATION FOR SINGLE CELL RNA KIT COMPARSION
Total RNA (500 ng) from MDA-468, MDA-231,
SKBR3, and MCF7 cells was isolated using the RNeasy
Micro Kit (QIAGEN) according to the protocol of the
vendor. To generate first-strand cDNA, 0.5 �g of total
RNA was reverse transcribed using the First-Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Qualitative
PCR was performed in a peqStar Thermocycler (Peqlab)
under the following conditions: after 10 min denatur-
ation at 95 °C, 35 cycles were carried out by denaturation
at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elon-
gation for 30 s at 72 °C. After a final elongation step at
72 °C for 10 min the samples were stored at 4 °C.
Ethidium bromide stained-agarose gel electrophoresis
was used to confirm the formation of the expected PCR
products. (See Fig. 1 in the Data Supplement that accom-
panies the online version of this article at http://www.

ENRICHMENT OF TUMOR CELLS FOR SINGLE CELL RNA
ANALYSIS
CellSearch Epithelial Cell Profile Kit. The CellSearch Ep-
ithelial Cell Profile Kit (Janssen Diagnostics) contains a
ferrofluid-based capture reagent coated to antibodies tar-
geting the EpCAM antigen. EDTA blood samples were
processed without fixation or permeabilization.
Parsortix System. The Parsortix (ANGLE Plc) is a marker-
independent system for tumor cell enrichment capturing
intact and viable tumor cells based on their size (�10
�m) (11).
STAINING AND ISOLATION OF THE TUMOR CELLS
To distinguish tumor cells from the leukocytes, an
epithelial-cell specific staining protocol was established
targeting EpCAM and/or pan-keratins (EpCAM and
pan-keratins for CTCs isolated by Parsortix and pan-
keratins for tumor cells isolated by CellSearch). Briefly,
enriched tumor cells were eluted into Eppendorf tubes,
stained, and isolated by micromanipulation for single cell
analysis.
The EpCAM antibody (Novocastra) was diluted in
10% AB-Serum/PBS (1:100) and incubated for 45 min
on a rotor. Next, the sample was washed and a fluores-
cently labeled secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher) was
added (1:150) for another 30 min in the dark. For sub-
sequent pan-keratin staining, samples were washed and
the CellSearch monoclonal pan-keratin antibody cock-
tail (included in the CellSearch Circulating Epithelial
Cell Kit) was added (1:10; incubation time 20 min in the
dark). Stained cells were washed and carefully transferred
onto a glass slide for single cell isolation by micromanip-
ulation (2).
TESTING OF DIFFERENT KITS FOR SINGLE CELL ANALYSIS
We tested the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit® (Macherey-
Nagel), the Picopure RNA Isolation Kit® (Life Technol-
ogies), the MessageBooster Kit™ (Epicentre), and the
CelluLyser™ Micro Lysis and cDNA Synthesis Kit
(TATAA Biocenter) for single cell analysis. Kits were
applied according to the instructions of the vendors.

TATAA PreAMP and qPCR. To analyze a multimarker
profile of single cells, cells were lysed using the CelluLyser
Micro Lysis and cDNA Synthesis Kit. cDNA was pro-
duced using the GrandScript cDNA Synthesis Kit and
was subsequently preamplified with the CTC Grand-
Performance assays using the PreAmp GrandMaster®
Mix (TATAA Biocenter). PCR was done according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using the Bio-Rad
CFX96 cycler (Bio-Rad).
RT2 PreAMP and RT2 Profiler PCR Array. The Message
Booster KitTM was applied in combination with the RT2
PreAMP Kit (QIAGEN) and different RT2 Profiler PCR
Arrays (Human Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, or EMT
PCR Array or Cancer Inflammation & Immunity Cross-
talk PCR Array, QIAGEN). PCR was done according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using the Bio-Rad
CFX96 cycler (Bio-Rad).
SINGLE CELL qPCR DATA ANALYSIS
Single cell qPCR data were generated as illustrated in Fig.
1. Quantification cycle (Cq) values above 35 were treated
as “off-scale data.” All missing data points were also
treated as “off-scale data” and replaced with a Cq value of
37. This was 2 cycles above the cutoff, which was consid-
ered giving a balanced weight to the negative observation
of transcripts in individual cells (12). The Cq values were
converted to relative quantities and transformed to log
base 2 scale. The expression data were not normalized to
any endogenous markers because of the stochasticity of
single cell expression (13). The measured cDNA concen-

 trations, which are proportional to mRNA concentra-
tions (14), are thus expressed per cell. To display all data
together, principal component analysis (PCA) and hier-
archical clustering were used. Each method used a differ-
ent mathematical approach to separate samples into
groups. PCA reduced multidimensional data into
2-dimensional charts with small loss of information.
Each point in the PCA graph contained information
about the expression of all the genes. For the hierarchical
clustering and PCA analyses, data were mean centered to
reduce the influence of the variable overall expression
level of the genes (15).
PATIENT SAMPLES
Analysis of human samples was carried out in accordance
with the guidelines for experimentation with humans by
the Chambers of Physicians of the State of Hamburg
(“Hamburger Ärztekammer”). Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients and the experiments
conformed to the principles set out in the World Medical
Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki and the De-
partment of Health and Human Services Belmont Re-
port. Breast cancer samples were obtained from the De-
partment of Gynecology, University Medical Center
Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Prostate cancer samples
were collected at the Practice Hematology and Oncol-
ogy, Hamburg, Germany. All blood samples were col-
lected into EDTA tubes (7.5 mL) and processed within
4 h after blood withdrawal.
Results
VALIDATION OF SINGLE CELL RNA ANALYSIS
Four different kits were tested for single cell RNA analysis:
the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit® (Macherey-Nagel); the Pico-
Pure RNA Isolation Kit® (Life Technologies); the Message-
BoosterKit(Epicentre);andtheCelluLyserMicroLysisand
cDNASynthesisKit(TATAABiocenter).Toverifythekits,
1, 5, 10, and 50 MDA-468 or the SKBR3 cells were directly
spiked into lysis buffer followed by qualitative PCR ampli-
fying EpCAM, EGFR, ERBB2, KRT19, and ACTB tran-
scripts. Only the MessageBooster Kit and the CelluLyser
Micro Lysis and cDNA Synthesis Kit produced consistent
RNA profiles of the tested cell lines down to single cell
level (see online Supplemental Fig. 1). Hence, these kits
were used for further studies.
We had to establish a specific staining protocol that
was compatible with downstream single cell profiling to
distinguish CTCs from leukocytes in clinical samples. In
our study, EpCAM and pan-keratins were used as target
proteins for tumor cell identification (Fig. 2A and online
Supplemental Fig. 2A).
Having established a reliable staining protocol, sin-
gle breast (MDA-468 and SKBR3; n � 3) or prostate
cancer cells (LnCap and PC3; n � 3) were spiked into 7.5
mL EDTA blood of healthy donors (n � 2) and pro-
cessed by CellSearch or Parsortix. Next, tumor cells or
remaining leukocytes were isolated and analyzed using
either the RT2 PreAmp and Profiler Human Prostate
Cancer PCR Array (QIAGEN) or the TATAA PreAmp
GrandMaster® Mix and TATAA Probe GrandMaster®
Mix (TATAA Biocenter) (Fig. 1, blue arrow and green
arrow).
Tumor cells could clearly be discriminated from leu-
kocytes based on their expression profiles (Fig. 2, B and
C). All details of the measured Cq values are listed in
online Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.
QUALITATIVE PCR AS INDICATOR FOR THE SUCCESS OF
FURTHER MULTIMARKER PROFILING
For clinical samples, the criteria for a cell to be classified
as CTC were: intact morphology (bright field micros-
copy), nucleus larger than 4 �m in diameter, and positive
staining for EpCAM and/or pan-keratins (see online
Supplemental Fig. 2A). The KRT19 transcripts have
been widely used to identify and study CTCs in cancer
patients (5, 6). Hence, we decided to use this marker as
an additional “CTC indicator” by qualitative PCR before
in-depth multimarker qPCR analysis. In total, 55 single
CTCs from 5 different donors were analyzed in our
study. However, reliable multimarker analysis was only
possible when intense signals for KRT19 were observed
(n � 39). Thus, we would recommend performing addi-
tional “qualitative PCR” tests as quality control before
single cell multimarker analyses in future studies (see on-
line Supplemental Fig. 2B).
ACCESSION OF TUMOR HETEROGENEITY BY MULTIPLEX
TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILING
In-depth analysis of CTCs from a patient with breast
cancer (enriched by CellSearch) revealed that RNA ex-
pression profiles of CTCs could clearly be discriminated
from leukocytes (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. 1, green arrows).
Genes such as EpCAM, cadherin 1_1 (CDH1_1), secreto-
globin family 2A member 1 (SCGB2A1)/MAM, estrogen
receptor 1 (ESR1), epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2),
and KRT19 were exclusively expressed in CTCs, while pro-
tein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type C (PTPRC; for-
merlycalledCD45)andvimentin(VIM)werepredominant
in the leukocytes. Although CTCs could clearly be distin-
guishedfromtheleukocytes,2CTCswerepositiveforboth,
the epithelial transcripts (EpCAM and KRT19) and the leu-
kocyte/mesenchymal markers (CD45 and VIM).
Principle component analysis (PCA) of the expression
profiles - measured for the individual CTCs from this pa-
tient - indicated that there might be 2 clusters, suggesting 2
CTC subtypes (Fig. 3, C–E). One CTC, which had sub-
stantially lower overall transcript levels than the other cells,
separated from the 2 CTC clusters and from the leukocytes,
indicating it was a deviant possibly due to damage during

 processing (Fig. 3, A–D). Genes significantly differentially
expressed between the 2 CTC subgroups are shown in Fig.
3E. CTCs in subgroup 1 displayed increased transcription
of genes involved in cell growth and tumor proliferation
[phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic
subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and mechanistic target of rapamy-
cin (MTOR)]. These cells furthermore showed low expres-
sion levels of the stem cell marker CD44 molecule (Indian
blood group; CD44) and high expression levels for Wolf-
Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (Whsc1), a gene encod-
ing for histone methyltransferase NSD2 known to play an
important role in cancer proliferation, survival, and tumor
growth (16). Detailed expression profiles (Cq values) of all
CTCs from this patient are summarized in online Supple-
mental Table 3.
Thirteen additional CTCs from another breast can-
cer patient, enriched in parallel by Parsortix (n � 7
CTCs) and CellSearch (n � 6 CTCs), could be processed
by targeting EMT-specific transcripts (Fig. 4, A–C, and
Fig. 1, red arrows). Again, single cell CTC subpopula-
tions could be identified depending on the expression
profile but independently of the enrichment strategy
(Fig. 4B). The most important genes clustering CTCs in
the subgroups were cadherin 2 (CDH2), collagen type I
alpha 2 chain (COL1A2), collagen type V alpha 2 chain
(COL5A2), fibronectin 1 (FN1), microtubule associ-
ated protein 1B (MAP1B), matrix metallopeptidase 3
(MMP3), SRY-box 10 (SOX10), secreted phospho-
protein 1 (SPP1), zinc finger E-box binding homeo-
box 1 (ZEB1), and zinc finger E-box binding homeo-
box 2 (ZEB2; Fig. 4C).
CTCs from a patient with prostate cancer (n � 8)
(enriched by Parsortix only) could also be clustered into
different subgroups based on their expression profiles
(Fig. 5, A–C, and Fig. 1, blue arrow). Only genes with
transcripts detected in at least 3 of the CTCs were con-
sidered for PCA. The most important genes distinguish-
ing CTCs into the subgroups were vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGFA; a marker that stimulates vas-
culogenesis and angiogenesis also relevant as therapeutic
target) (17), AR (a receptor that plays a key role in the
development and progression of PC and is used as ther-
apeutic target) (18), nuclear factor �B (NF-�B; a tran-
scription factor known to regulate AR expression and
PC growth) (19), NK3 homeobox 1 (NKX3–1; an
androgen-regulated transcription factor believed to act as
a suppressor of the pathogenic ERG, ETS transcription
factor (TMPRSS2-ERG) rearrangement] (20), and trans-
membrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2; an androgen-
regulated protease known to be contributing to regula-
tion of cancer growth) (20) (Fig. 5C). Cq values of all
CTCs from this patient are summarized in online Sup-
plemental Table 4.
CTC subgroups (enriched by Parsortix) were also
present in an additional sample from another patient
with prostate cancer (Fig. 6, A–C, and Fig. 1, gray ar-
row). CTCs in one of the subgroups showed increased
expression levels of RAD51 recombinase (RAD51).
Overexpression of this marker has been associated with
aggressive prostate cancer (21). CTCs in the other sub-
group displayed high expression of markers discussed to
be relevant for supporting therapeutic decisions in pros-
tate cancer [androgen receptor V7 (AR-V7) and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)]
(4, 22). Summarized Cq values of CTCs from this pa-
tient are listed in online Supplemental Table 5.
ACTIVATION OF INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNITY SIGNALING
IN CTCs
Lively debate is ongoing about communication between
tumor cells and the cellular mediators of inflammation
and immunity (23). Thus, we also decided to analyze the
expression of genes involved in cancer inflammation and
immune cross talk (Fig. 1, orange arrow). Here, both
CellSearch and Parsortix enrichment strategies were ap-
plied to 2 blood samples from the same patient. The
enrichment method did not bias expression of the ref-
erence genes included in the analysis (mean Cq after
CellSearch enrichment: 25.31 vs mean Cq after Par-
sortix: 25.16), demonstrating consistent workflows of
the 2 enrichment strategies. In this case, several genes
involved in cross talks between immune cells and can-
cer cells, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 4
(CCL4), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2),
CXCL9, interleukin 15 (IL15), IL1B, or IL8 showed
different expression levels between the individual
CTCs captured via EpCAM or by size (see online Sup-
plemental Fig. 3 and online Supplemental Table 6). It
is notable that tumor cell–derived CCL4 protein,
which was one of the identified markers, can promote
bone metastasis by interacting with CCR5-expressing
nontumor cells (24). Chemokines have an important
role
in
cancer
metastasis
and
might
mediate
a signaling network that links metastasis formation
and chemotherapy resistance. Chemokines, including
CXCL2, CXCL8 (IL8), showed substantially higher
expression in CTCs enriched with the Parsortix sys-
tem. In relation to this observation, enhanced IL15
expression has previously been detected in colorectal
cancer cells and shown to play an important role in cell
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis formation (25).
In our study, IL15 transcript levels showed large variations
across CTCs independently of enrichment strategy.
Discussion
We developed optimized workflows for robust enrich-
ment and transcriptomic profiling of single CTCs.
Enrichment of CTCs was performed with 2 different
platforms: the EpCAM-dependent CellSearch system
1510
Clinical Chemistry 62:11 (2016)
 (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration)
and a novel, marker-independent size-based approach
(Parsortix) (11). Our workflows allow for the charac-
terization of different CTC single cell subpopulations
depending on the markers used for the identification.
Our single cell data showed high detection rates of
the targeted transcripts. The GrandPerformance assays
are probe based, thus avoiding false positive results due
to formation of primer dimers and other aberrant
products, while the RT2 Profiler assays are SYBR based
and generate signal also from aberrant PCR products.
This is, however, minimized by careful assay optimi-
zation and by rejecting Cq values �35. Expression of
reference genes cannot be used for normalization of
single cell data due to the underlying burst kinetics
(26), but their overall expression level can serve as a

 quality indicator. CTCs with exceedingly low tran-
script levels of reference genes are likely to have been
damaged during the processing.
We found a minor subpopulation of epithelial
marker-positive (e.g., KRT19 and EpCAM) and CD45-
positive cells in clinical samples (Fig. 3). These cells were
also strongly positive for markers such as twist family
bHLH transcription factor (Twist), CD44, ATP binding
cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1), or ADAM
metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17). We assume

 that these cells are tumor cells but the role of CD45-
positive CTCs is not clear yet (27, 28). Thus, our assay
might help to identify the relevance of this specific cell
type in future studies.
Focusing on the transcript signatures of CTCs, dif-
ferent subgroups were identified in individual patients
(independently of the enrichment strategy (see online
Supplemental Fig. 4, A–C). These subgroups were
characterized by divergent expression of, e.g., EMT-
associated genes (CDH2, COL1A2, COL5A2, FN1,
MAP1B, MMP3, SOX10, SPP1, ZEB1, and ZEB2),
DNA repair genes (RAD51) (21) or targets relevant for
cancer therapy. For example, EGFR or ERBB2-specific
transcripts were frequently present in CTCs (Figs. 4–6).
ERBB2 is an effective target in breast cancer and further-
more discussed to play also an important role in PC
(29, 30). Here, ERBB2 transcripts were present in
PC-derived CTCs (see online Supplemental Fig. 6).
Controlling the ERBB2 pathway could be an attractive
combinational
therapeutic
approach
together
with
second-generation antiandrogen agents such as enzalut-
amide and abiraterone acetate to remove castration-
resistant prostate cancer (30). We also show that ERBB2-
positive CTCs might express AR-V7 (3 out of 7 CTCs in
the same patient) (Fig. 6). AR-V7, a constitutively active
splice variant of the AR detected in CTC pools, was
recently found to drive castration-resistant growth and
resistance to enzalutamide in patients with prostate can-
cer (4). Thus, we demonstrate the differential expression
of ERBB2 and/or AR-V7 between subgroups of CTCs in

 an individual patient with prostate cancer, indicating
that unraveling the transcriptome of CTCs might help to
monitor the emergence of driver molecules for resistance
and thereby unveil patients who would profit from op-
tional therapies, e.g., using galeterone instead of enzalu-
tamide and abiraterone (plus ERBB2 inhibitors).
In addition, transcripts that have been reported to
be relevant for metastatic processes (EpCAM, CD44,
CD24) or potential drug targets (mTOR, PI3K,
VEGFA) (31–33) were also found to be significantly
differently expressed among breast cancer-derived CTCs
(Fig. 3). Previous reports suggested the existence of tu-
mor stem cells that are characterized by upregulation of
CD44 and the downregulation of CD24 (34). However,
the role of CD24 remains controversial since both
CD44high/CD24low and CD44high/CD24high cells have
been shown to initiate tumor growth (35, 36). In the
present study, CD44 emerged as an allocation factor be-
tween 2 subgroups of CTCs derived from the same breast
cancer patient, whereas CD24 was marginally altered be-
tween the same subgroups. Interestingly, the CD44low/
CD24high subgroup showed high expression levels of
PI3K and MTOR. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cas-
cade is one of the most important intracellular pathways
in cancer cells (37). Numerous efforts have been made to
develop targeted therapies inhibiting this cascade in hor-
mone receptor positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer in
combination with hormonal therapy (38).
Emergingdatasuggeststhattheheterogeneityofcancer
thought to be causative for the functional plasticity neces-
sary for tumor cells to evade therapeutic approaches, as well
as prosperous adoption to foreign microenvironments
within the metastatic niche, is driven by transcriptional
changes (39). Understanding this heterogeneity with the
presented workflow allows for a better understanding of the
mechanisms involved in cancer progression. RNA analysis
ofCTCsofferstheopportunitytostratifypatientswithmet-
astatic disease into phenotypical subgroups according to
theirexpressionprofiles,providinganimportantframework
for therapeutic decisions based on a simple blood test (“liq-
uid biopsy”) (1, 28). Such information is expected to be
most valuable in the selection of personalized therapies,
since the most active pathways are critical for the particular
CTCs present and may be their Achilles heel if suitable
drugstargetingthatpathwayareavailable.Particularlywhen
combined with mutational profiling, which reveals any crit-
ical mutations affecting the sensitivity for targeted therapy
(2, 3), it might support decision-making for individualized
treatments.
In summary, we established reliable workflows to
study multimarker profiles of single CTCs by low cost
qPCR approaches. In principle, these workflows can be
combined with any CTC enrichment system that enables
isolation of high quality RNA. Thus, these workflows
could become a valuable new tool in biomedical research.
Although the number of patients/CTCs studied in this
proof-of-principle study was small, multivariate analysis
of expression profiles indicated that subgroups of CTCs
with different phenotypes are present within each
CTC-positive patient. Intrapatient heterogeneity of
CTCs might contribute to resistance to therapy. This
hypothesis has to be tested in future clinical studies.
