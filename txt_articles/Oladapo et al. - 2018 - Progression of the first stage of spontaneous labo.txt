Abstract
Background
Escalation in the global rates of labour interventions, particularly cesarean section and oxy-
tocin augmentation, has renewed interest in a better understanding of natural labour pro-
gression. Methodological advancements in statistical and computational techniques
addressing the limitations of pioneer studies have led to novel findings and triggered a re-
evaluation of current labour practices. As part of the World Health Organization’s Better Out-
comes in Labour Difficulty (BOLD) project, which aimed to develop a new labour monitoring-

The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID); and the UNDP-UNFPA-
 to-action tool, we examined the patterns of labour progression as depicted by cervical dilata-
tion over time in a cohort of women in Nigeria and Uganda who gave birth vaginally following
a spontaneous labour onset.
Methods and findings
This was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study of 5,606 women with singleton, vertex,
term gestation who presented at � 6 cm of cervical dilatation following a spontaneous labour
onset that resulted in a vaginal birth with no adverse birth outcomes in 13 hospitals across
Nigeria and Uganda. We independently applied survival analysis and multistate Markov
models to estimate the duration of labour centimetre by centimetre until 10 cm and the
cumulative duration of labour from the cervical dilatation at admission through 10 cm. Multi-
state Markov and nonlinear mixed models were separately used to construct average labour
curves. All analyses were conducted according to three parity groups: parity = 0 (n = 2,166),
parity = 1 (n = 1,488), and parity = 2+ (n = 1,952). We performed sensitivity analyses to
assess the impact of oxytocin augmentation on labour progression by re-examining the pro-
gression patterns after excluding women with augmented labours. Labour was augmented
with oxytocin in 40% of nulliparous and 28% of multiparous women. The median time to
advance by 1 cm exceeded 1 hour until 5 cm was reached in both nulliparous and multipa-
rous women. Based on a 95th percentile threshold, nulliparous women may take up to 7
hours to progress from 4 to 5 cm and over 3 hours to progress from 5 to 6 cm. Median cumu-
lative duration of labour indicates that nulliparous women admitted at 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm
reached 10 cm within an expected time frame if the dilatation rate was � 1 cm/hour, but their
corresponding 95th percentiles show that labour could last up to 14, 11, and 9 hours,
respectively. Substantial differences exist between actual plots of labour progression of indi-
vidual women and the ‘average labour curves’ derived from study population-level data.
Exclusion of women with augmented labours from the study population resulted in slightly
faster labour progression patterns.
Conclusions
Cervical dilatation during labour in the slowest-yet-normal women can progress more slowly
than the widely accepted benchmark of 1 cm/hour, irrespective of parity. Interventions to
expedite labour to conform to a cervical dilatation threshold of 1 cm/hour may be inappropri-
ate, especially when applied before 5 cm in nulliparous and multiparous women. Averaged
labour curves may not truly reflect the variability associated with labour progression, and
their use for decision-making in labour management should be de-emphasized.

 general belief that labour progression is the same in humans led to universal application
of their findings, and the expectation that the cervix dilates by at least 1 cm/hour in all
women during established labour.
• Since the early 2000s, however, researchers using new statistical methods to study labour
found evidence to suggest that the patterns of labour progression as described by Fried-
man may not be accurate for the current generation of women giving birth. While these
newer findings have informed changes in recommended labour practices in some set-
tings, they have also generated a lot of controversy.
• As a result of persistent questions as to whether racial characteristics influence labour
progression patterns, recent studies have been conducted among different populations,
but not yet in any African population.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We conducted an analysis of prospectively collected observational data of 5,606 women
who presented in early labour (at or before 6 cm of cervical dilatation) following sponta-
neous labour onset and gave birth vaginally in 13 maternity hospitals in Nigeria and
Uganda. None of these women experienced serious adverse outcomes for themselves or
their babies.
• We applied advanced statistical and computational methods (survival analysis and Mar-
kov techniques) to determine how long it took the cervix to dilate by 1 cm from one
level of dilatation to the next until full dilatation (10 cm) and how long it took the cervix
to reach full dilatation based on the dilatation at the time of labour admission. We also
used two separate methods to plot population average cervical dilatation time curves
(labour curves) for the women in our sample.
• Contrary to the generally held view, we found that labour progressed more slowly in our
study population than previously reported. On average, the rate of cervical dilatation
was less than 1 cm/hour for some women until 5 cm of cervical dilatation was reached
among those undergoing their first, second, or subsequent labours.
• Labour was very slow in some women throughout the first stage, including the early
part of the period that is traditionally known as the ‘active phase’, when the ‘normal’ cer-
vical dilatation rate is expected to be at least 1 cm/hour or faster. While on average the
labour progression in first-time mothers was generally similar to their counterparts in
the US, China, and Japan, there are also important differences in the slowest-yet-normal
(95th percentile) group of women in our study population.
What do these findings mean?
• The average labour curves derived from our study population are substantially different
from those published from the pioneer work of Friedman. They also do not truly reflect
the variations shown in the labour progression of individual women in our study.
• The application of population average labour curves could potentially misclassify
women who are slowly but normally progressing as abnormal and therefore increase
their chances of being subjected to unnecessary labour interventions. We propose that

 averaged labour progression lines or curves are not used for decision-making in the
management of labour for individual women.
• As labour may not naturally accelerate in some women until a cervical dilatation of 5
cm is reached, labour practices to address perceived slow labour progression should not
be routinely applied by clinicians until this threshold is achieved, provided the vital
signs and other observations of the mother and baby are normal.
• In the absence of any problems other than a slower than expected cervical dilatation rate
(i.e., 1 cm/hour) during labour, it is in the interest of the woman that expectant, sup-
portive, and woman-centred labour care is continued.
Introduction
From the mid-1950s until the 1980s, Dr Emmanuel Friedman published a series of landmark
studies describing the patterns of labour progression in nulliparous and multiparous women
[1–9]. The classic sigmoidal labour curve derived from his work has defined the fundamental
basis of labour management for more than six decades. Although Friedman’s studies were lim-
ited to obstetric populations in the US, the general notion that the labour progression pattern
is largely consistent in humans has led to universal application of their findings and the expec-
tation that the cervix dilates by at least 1 cm/hour in all women. This long-held assumption
was the basis for the introduction of ‘Active Management of Labour’ protocols by O’Driscoll
and colleagues in the 1970s [10], to ‘normalize’ women’s labour patterns in accordance with
the ‘1 cm/hour rule’. However, the escalating rates of unnecessary labour interventions over
the last two decades, particularly oxytocin augmentation and cesarean section [11], have
renewed interest in what constitutes normal labour progression.
Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, there is increasing evidence to suggest that the descrip-
tions of the relationship between the duration of first stage of labour and cervical dilatation
patterns and the definitions of labour dystocia as earlier described may not be appropriate
[12–16]. Labour interventions such as induction, oxytocin augmentation, and epidural anaes-
thesia are now more common, while instrumental and breech vaginal births are becoming
rare. The generation of women giving birth in contemporary practice is older, and with
increasing body mass index and fetal weight.
In addition, newer research has taken advantage of methodological advancements in
computational techniques to address the limitations of studying labour progression and con-
structing labour curves in the 1950s and 1960s [17]. While these advancements have led to
novel findings and new guidance on labour care [18], they are also a subject of intense debate
[19–21]. Suggestions that there may be racial and ethnic differences in labour progression pat-
terns as a result of differences in pelvic configurations and sociocultural aspects have promoted
research in different obstetric populations [22]. While contemporary labour curves have been
published for white, Hispanic, and Asian obstetric populations [14–16], no modern labour
curves exist for sub-Saharan African women.
As part of the WHO’s Better Outcomes in Labour Difficulty (BOLD) project, which aimed
to develop an innovative and effective labour monitoring-to-action tool [23], we examined the
patterns of labour progression in a prospective cohort of women in Nigeria and Uganda who
gave birth vaginally without adverse birth outcomes following a spontaneous labour onset.

Ethics statement
Scientific and technical approval for this study was obtained from the Review Panel on
Research Projects (RP2) of the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Program
of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), Depart-
ment of Reproductive Health and Research, WHO. Ethical approval was obtained from the
WHO Ethical Review Committee (protocol A65879), the Makerere University School of
Health Sciences Research and Ethics Committee, Uganda (protocol #SHSREC REF 2014–058),
University of Ibadan/University College Hospital Ethics Committee (UI/EC/14/0223), Federal

27-08-14), and Ondo State Government Ministry of Health Research Ethics Review Commit-
tee, Nigeria (AD 4693/160). The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki
of the World Medical Association.
Design, setting, and population
The WHO BOLD research project was primarily designed to identify the essential elements of
labour monitoring that trigger the decision to use interventions aimed at preventing poor
labour outcomes, with the aim of developing a new labour monitoring-to-action tool. The
study protocol and detailed methodological considerations have been published elsewhere
[23]. In brief, this was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study of women admitted for vaginal
birth with single live fetuses during early first stage of labour across 13 hospitals in Nigeria and
Uganda. This included women undergoing induction of labour and those with spontaneous
labour onset who presented at cervical dilatation of � 6 cm. Women with multiple pregnan-
cies, gestational age less than 34 weeks, elective cesarean section, and those who were unwilling
to participate or incapable of giving consent due to obstetric emergencies were excluded. 9,995
women (56.1%) out of 17,810 women who were screened in all hospitals during the study
period met these inclusion criteria and participated in the study.
Participating hospitals had a minimum of 1,000 deliveries per year with stable access to
cesarean section, augmentation of labour, and instrumental vaginal birth. Estimation of gesta-
tional age at birth was in accordance with individual institutional practices, which relied upon
the woman’s first date of the last menstrual period in the majority of cases. Labour was man-
aged by midwives or obstetric residents and/or obstetricians. Doppler fetal monitor was used
to assess fetal vital status at hospital admission and for intermittent monitoring throughout
labour. Labour management protocol, as well as the number and timing of pelvic examina-
tions, were not standardized across participating institutions. None of the institutions sub-
scribed to the ‘Active Management of Labour’ protocol during the study period. Although the
partograph was a standard element in all labour protocols, adherence to its application for
labour management during the study period varied widely across hospitals.
Study procedures
Eligible women were recruited into the study between December 2014 and November 2015.
From the medical record, trained research nurses prospectively extracted detailed information
on sociodemographic, anthropometric, obstetric, and medical characteristics of study partici-
pants at hospital admission, multiple assessments for labour monitoring and interventions
performed throughout the first and second stages of labour, and maternal and neonatal out-
comes following labour. Attending staff were approached to complement medical records data

 when needed. Data collection was limited to the hospital stay of the mother and baby, and
there was no follow-up after hospital discharge.
The current study used information on maternal baseline and admission characteristics,
repeated assessments of cervical dilatation over time, maternal and neonatal characteristics
throughout labour, and perinatal outcome data. This analysis was focused on describing the
labour patterns of women without adverse birth outcomes and not on determining correlation
to clinical outcomes (See S1 STROBE Checklist). From a total of 8,957 singleton births with
consistent time records in the database, we restricted our analysis to examine labour progres-
sion to 5,606 women on the basis of the following inclusion criteria (Fig 1): term births
(between 37 weeks and 0 days and 41 weeks and 6 days) with vertex presentation and sponta-
neous labour onset. We excluded women who had labour induction, previous uterine scar, or

 intrapartum cesarean section. To examine the labour patterns in women with normal perinatal
outcomes, we excluded women whose labour resulted in severe adverse outcomes, which was
defined as occurrence of any of the following: stillbirth, early neonatal death, neonatal use of
anticonvulsant, neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 5-minute Apgar score < 6, maternal
death or organ dysfunction associated with labour dystocia, or uterine rupture. Furthermore,
we excluded women who gave birth to neonates with severe congenital malformation and
those with fewer than two cervical dilatation assessments during the first stage of labour (since
a single data point cannot be used to generate a labour pattern for the individual woman).
Data analysis
We grouped women in the selected sample into three parity groups (0, 1, and 2+) to explore
any differences in labour patterns according to parity. We used two independent approaches
to analyse labour progression patterns and construct average labour curves for the selected
sample. In the first approach, we performed survival analyses to estimate the time it took to
progress from one level of cervical dilatation to the next (called ‘sojourn time’) (i.e., from 3 to 4
cm, 4 to 5 cm, 5 to 6 cm, until full dilatation [10 cm]). We used both complete (where avail-
able) and interval-censored times to estimate the distribution of times for progression from
one integer centimetre of dilatation to the next, with an assumption that the labour data are
log-normally distributed. Based on this model, the median, 5th, and 95th percentiles were cal-
culated. We used the same approach to derive the cumulative duration of labour for women
presenting at different cervical dilatations (3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm) to evaluate any poten-
tial differences in the patterns of labour progression. To illustrate the ‘slowest-yet-normal’
labour patterns, we plotted the 95th percentiles for the cumulative duration of labour based on
the cervical dilatation at admission. To construct average labour curves, we applied a nonlinear
mixed model that best fit our data instead of polynomial models used by previous authors [12–
16, 24]. We expressed cervical dilatation for subject i in time j (yij) as a function of time (tij)
according to the following three-parameter logistic growth model:
yij ¼ b0 þ
b1
1 þ expð� ðtij � ðb2 þ biÞÞÞ
in which β0 is dilatation value when tij ! −1, β1 is the asymptotic curve height, and β2 is the
inflection point and at this time value when the dilatation reaches half of its height. For sim-
plicity, we estimated β0, β1 as fixed effects and included the random term bi in the inflection
point and assumed that this term follows a normal distribution, i.e., bi � Nð0; s2
bÞ. Given that
women in this analysis entered the cervical dilatation time curve at different dilatations but all
ended at full dilatation (10 cm), the starting point (time = 0) on the x-axis was set at full dilata-
tion (10 cm), which was reached by all women in the sample and then calculated backwards
(e.g., 1 hour before 10 cm becomes −1 hour and so on). This x-axis (time) was then reverted to
a positive value. For example, instead of −12 ! 0 hours, it became 0 ! 12 hours. We used
R-Cran version 3.2 for these statistical analyses [25].
In the second approach, we applied a multistate Markov modelling technique to examine
the labour progression patterns in the same sample. This mathematical modelling technique
from matrix algebra describes the transitions that a cohort of individuals make among a num-
ber of mutually exclusive and exhaustive health states during a series of short time intervals
[26]. As cervical dilatation progression is a state- and time-related phenomenon during a
period ranging from labour onset through to full cervical dilatation and birth of the baby (i.e.,
there is a finite set of states), the labour process can be considered a mathematical model that
is suitable for the application of multistate Markov modelling. We therefore represented the

 sequence of labour progress as states based on every observed centimetre from 2 to 10 cm until
birth of the baby—the ‘absorbing state’, as illustrated in S1 Fig. At a time t, the woman is in
state S(t). The model was designed as a progressive unidirectional model, which only allows a
choice of a way out of a particular state, but once a woman has left a state she cannot return.
The next state to which a woman moves and the time of the change are governed by a set of
transition intensities for each pair of states r and s. The transition intensity represents the
instantaneous likelihood of moving from state r to state s. The full set of intensities for the sys-
tem form the matrix Q.
A Markov process is based on the transition matrix with a probability structure P(u, t + u).
The (r, s) entry (the elements of entire matrix) of P(u, t + u), is the probability of being in state
s at a time t + u, given the state at time u is r. P(u, t + u) is calculated in terms of Q. Assuming
that the transition intensity matrix Q is constant over the interval (u, t + u), as in a time-homo-
geneous process, P(u, t + u) = P(t) and the equations are solved by the matrix exponential of Q
scaled by the time interval, P(t) = Exp(tQ) (S1 Fig). We used msm package for R Project pro-
gramming environment to fit the multistate Markov model [26]. We generated random obser-
vations of cervical dilatation based on the transition matrix P(t) for the entire duration of
labour (S2 Fig) to derive average labour curves according to parity and calculated the median,
5th, and 95th percentiles of sojourn times and cumulative duration of labour according to cer-
vical dilatation at admission.
In order to assess the influence of oxytocin augmentation on the described labour patterns,
we applied the survival analyses and multistate Markov models to perform sensitivity analyses
comparing labour progression patterns of all women with that of a population excluding
women with oxytocin augmentation (i.e., our entire study population versus study population
excluding women with augmented labours).
The plan for the above survival analyses was first presented at an expert meeting convened
by the WHO in November 2016, following which the analyses were started. In February 2017,
after a review of the preliminary results of these analyses, the WHO study-coordinating unit
requested an independent application of multistate Markov models to the same sample of
women in order to determine whether the findings are consistent between the two analytical
approaches. From June to July 2017, sensitivity analyses were conducted using the two analyti-
cal approaches to assess the influence of oxytocin augmentation on the described labour pat-
terns for the study population, following the suggestions of the BOLD project technical
advisory group and study co-authors.
Results
Baseline characteristics, labour observations, and interventions
A total of 5,606 women were included in these analyses. Table 1 presents the characteristics of
these women by parity. In the selected sample, 54.7% of the women were from Uganda and 45.3%
were from Nigeria. Nulliparous women were younger than the multiparous women, constituted
over a third of the study sample, and were evenly balanced between the two countries. There was a
slight increase in maternal body mass index at birth as parity increased. At labour admission, spon-
taneous rupture of the membranes had occurred in a quarter of nulliparous women and in about
one-fifth of multiparous women. The cervix was well effaced (thin or very thin) in half of the nul-
liparous and in slightly higher proportions in the multiparous groups. Median cervical dilatation
was 4 cm, and the fetal head was not engaged in over 90% of women in all parity groups. There
was no caput succedaneum or moulding in over 99% of the women at the time of admission.
In terms of labour interventions, 40% of nulliparous women received oxytocin infusion for
labour augmentation, compared with 28% of multiparous women. The median number of

 vaginal examinations per woman throughout first stage was 3. Presence of a labour companion
was observed at least on one occasion in more than half of the women and on two or more occa-
sions in at least a third. While over two-thirds of the women were observed to have taken oral flu-
ids at least once during labour, less than half of them were observed to have done so two or more
times. In comparison, oral feedings were observed less frequently, although the observed pattern
was similar across parity groups. Severe caput succedaneum and third-degree moulding of the

 fetal head were rarely seen in any of the parity groups. Labour analgesia and operative vaginal
birth were used in less than 2% in the study population; a reflection of the current clinical prac-
tices in the study hospitals. While the gestational age at birth was similar across the parity groups,
there was an average of a 100-g increase in birth weight with increasing parity.
Labour progression patterns (all women)
Table 2 presents the detailed analyses of labour progression based on the two analytical
approaches and compares these with the findings of Zhang et al. [14]. The table shows that,
based on survival analyses, the median time for the cervix to dilate by 1 cm was longer than the
generally accepted limit of 1 hour until a cervical dilatation of 5 cm was achieved in nulliparous
women and until 5 cm was achieved in multiparous women. In all parity groups, the median
rate of progression doubles as the cervix reaches 6 cm with a median time shorter than 1 hour.
Labour progression afterwards escalated more rapidly as it advanced towards 10 cm in all par-
ity groups. Likewise, multistate Markov modelling shows that the median time needed to
advance by 1 cm was more than 1 hour until 5 cm was achieved in both nulliparous and mul-
tiparous women, and labour progression became more rapid from 7 cm. The distribution of
data from both analysis methods show a wide variability around the median for each level of
advancement, though this was more pronounced in the survival analyses data. The 95th per-
centiles of the distribution of sojourn times indicate that labour could progress much more
slowly for some women and still result in vaginal birth without adverse birth outcomes. The
data show that it was not unusual for nulliparous women to spend more than 7 hours to
advance from 4 to 5 cm and over 3 hours to advance from 5 to 6 cm. For some women, the
95th percentile data suggest that throughout the first stage of labour, it took more than 1 hour

 for cervical dilatation to advance by 1 cm irrespective of the parity groups. The table also
shows that the pattern of median times to advance from early to advanced first stage of labour
is largely consistent with the findings of Zhang et al. [14], although our 95th percentiles show
even wider variability.
Fig 2 shows that the ‘average labour curves’ derived from multistate Markov models for
both nulliparous and multiparous women progressed gradually from 4 cm with fairly linear
trajectories as they advanced towards 10 cm. The slopes of the curves for multiparous women
were steeper than that of the nulliparous women.
The nonlinear mixed models, however, produced smooth labour curves for both nullipa-
rous and multiparous women, which proceeded gradually with a slight upward inclination
from around 5 cm and no clear inflection points through 10 cm (S3 Fig). Inflection points
appear outside the normal range of observations. Within the range of observed data for cervi-
cal dilatation, the curves appear to accelerate from 5 cm, with steeper slopes as they advanced
towards 10 cm in multiparous compared to nulliparous women.
S1 Video, S2 Video, S3 Video, and S4 Video are video displays comparing actual plots of
cervical dilatation pattern of individual women (starting from 4 cm) with (1) the average
labour curves constructed from our study population and (2) the 1 cm/hour alert line of the
partograph. The videos show that a substantial proportion of nulliparous and multiparous
women crossed the 1 cm/hour alert line as they progressed during labour. The videos also
show that substantial differences exist between actual plots of labour progression for individual
women and the population average curves.
Table 3 shows the cumulative duration of labour from the cervical dilatation observed at
admission (e.g., at 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, or 6 cm) to the next centimetre until 10 cm. The table
shows that the median times estimated by the two analysis methods are mostly consistent but
also have wide variability in data distribution expressed by their corresponding 5th and 95th

sojourn times (in Table 2) is also expressed by the progressively shorter cumulative duration of
labour as cervical dilatation on admission increased from 4 to 6 cm. The median rates of ‘linear
dilatation’ increased from 1 cm/hour for nulliparous women admitted at 4 cm to 1.3 cm/hour
for those admitted at 6 cm. While the median times for nulliparous women admitted at 4, 5,
and 6 cm to achieve full dilatation were within the same time frame for dilatation progressing
at �1 cm/hour, their 95th percentiles show that it was not uncommon to have labours lasting
up to 14, 11, and 9 hours in the same categories of women, respectively. The observed cumula-
tive duration of labour in women arriving in labour before 4 cm shows that some of these

 women did not deliver vaginally until almost 24 hours after admission. The overall patterns
are similar for multiparous women, although the medians and their corresponding 95th per-
centiles were generally shorter than for nulliparous women.
Fig 3, Fig 4, and Fig 5 illustrate the 95th percentiles (in Table 3) plotted as connected stair-
case lines with specified dilatation at admission having its own corresponding line. Based on the
dilatation at admission, women falling to the right of these lines (or thresholds) can be regarded
as having protracted or unusually slow labour. From the survival analysis data, for example, if a
nulliparous woman who was admitted at 4 cm takes longer than 10 hours to reach 6 cm. Like-
wise, a nulliparous woman admitted at 6 cm can be considered to be experiencing a protracted

 labour if she takes longer than 7 hours to reach 8 cm or longer than 9 hours to reach 10 cm. The
patterns of cumulative labour duration are similar for all parity groups until 6 cm, when the
staircase lines become steeper for multiparous compared to nulliparous women.
Labour progression patterns (excluding women with oxytocin
augmentation)
Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 show the results of the sensitivity analyses of labour progression
based on our two analytical approaches. As shown in Table 4, the median, 5th, and 95th per-
centile times to advance by 1 cm were generally shorter when women who had oxytocin were

 excluded from the study population. The differences between the median times were generally
small, less than half an hour in nearly all cases, and mostly confined to the early part of labour
(i.e., between 3 and 5 cm). For nulliparous women, the differences in median times ranged
from 5 to 22 minutes, while for parity = 1 and parity = 2+ women, it ranged from 1 to 33 min-
utes and from less than 1 minute to 27 minutes, respectively. The differences in median times
centimetre by centimetre became insignificant as labour advanced.
Table 5 and Table 6 show the cumulative duration of labour from the cervical dilatation
observed at admission to the next centimetre until 10 cm, excluding women who had oxytocin
augmentation. The slightly faster progression of cervical dilatation in the absence of oxytocin
augmentation as shown by the sojourn times (in Table 4) is also expressed by the shorter
median cumulative duration of labour in all scenarios. For example, considering the cumula-
tive duration of labour for 3 to 10 cm, 4 to 10 cm, 5 to 10 cm, and 6 to 10 cm, the differences in
median times were all less than 1 hour regardless of the analysis method used, and the faster

 progressions were more obvious in women arriving early in labour (i.e., at 3 and 4 cm cervical
dilatation).
Fig 6 shows the average labour curves by parity groups after excluding women with oxyto-
cin augmentation. Excluding women who received oxytocin augmentation did not lead to any
major change in the pattern or the trajectories of the curves for any parity group. However, the
small difference in the labour curves of multiparous groups (as shown in Fig 2) disappeared
when women who received oxytocin augmentation were excluded from the analysis. Fig 7, Fig
8, and Fig 9 illustrate the changes in the 95th percentiles (in Table 5 and Table 6) plotted as
connected staircase lines for women who received oxytocin augmentation compared to all
women. The shorter cumulative labour duration is also reflected in the 95th percentiles for all
parity groups regardless of the dilatation at admission, except for nulliparous women admitted
at 3 cm, which showed more variability.
Discussion
Main findings
Understanding the natural progression of labour presents unique challenges in current obstetric
practice. Nevertheless, a gradual shift towards approaches to reduce labour interventions deserves
evidence-based information on the upper limits of normal labour to guide practice, especially
now that modern analytical methods are available. Contrary to the generally held view, our study
shows that in this obstetric population, labour appears to progress more slowly than previously
reported [1–3, 27, 28]. The median time needed for the cervix to dilate by 1 cm exceeded 1 hour
until dilatation was at least 5 cm in both nulliparous and multiparous women. Labour tended to
progress more slowly in the early part of traditional active phase and more rapidly after 6 cm.
Considerable variability exists in the distribution of times needed to advance by 1 cm and the

 duration of labour among women who gave birth vaginally without adverse birth outcomes. For
instance, based on 95th percentile thresholds, some nulliparous women took more than 7 hours
to advance from 4 to 5 cm, and more than 3 hours to advance from 5 to 6 cm. This pattern of pro-
gression was observed irrespective of the analysis method we applied.
While the cumulative duration of labour indicates that a substantial proportion of nullipa-
rous women admitted in labour at 4, 5, and 6 cm achieved full dilatation within an expected
time frame if the dilatation rate was � 1 cm/hour, their 95th percentiles show that labour in
these women could last up to 14, 11, and 9 hours, respectively, and still lead to a vaginal birth
without untoward effects on the mother and baby. Labour could be considerably slow to

 advance from 3 to 4 cm, and women admitted before 4 cm could have long labours that ulti-
mately end in uncomplicated vaginal birth. Substantial differences exist between actual plots
of cervical dilatation over time for individual women and the ‘average labour curves’ derived
from our population-level data.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ modern statistical and computational
mathematical methods to assess the patterns of labour in any African population. We used two

 analytical approaches to determine labour progression and construct labour curves from the
same sample in an attempt to explore whether the resulting patterns are independent of analy-
sis methods. We applied these methods to a relatively large and prospectively collected data set
from two sub-Saharan African countries comprising multiethnic groups. However, two main
limitations need to be highlighted.
First, our study is prone to selection bias that is inherent in the designs of studies of labour
patterns in current obstetric practice [17]. Women excluded from our analysis due to cesarean
section during the first or second stage of labour may have a different pattern of labour pro-
gression compared with women who had vaginal births. Our perception is that this will not

 impact our study findings, not only because such women constituted 12% of women in whom
vertex delivery was anticipated, but also because the inclusion of women who had cesarean sec-
tions as a result of labour dystocia during the first stage or failed operative vaginal birth during
the second stage could have biased our results towards even longer labours. Additionally, con-
struction of our labour curves was dependent on using 10 cm as the starting point through a
reverse approach, and therefore, it was essential that all women in our study sample reached
full dilatation. Nevertheless, the exclusion of women whose labours were induced and those
with nonvertex presentation implies that our findings may not be applicable to these women.
Our findings also need to be interpreted within the context of non- or low use of epidural
anaesthesia and instrumental vaginal birth. As these interventions tend to be associated with
slower labours, it is reasonable to assume that their low rates in this population would have
biased the current findings towards shorter rather than longer labour duration.
Second is the measurement bias that could have been introduced due to inherent subjectivity
in cervical dilatation assessments and a lack of standardization of frequency of pelvic examina-
tions across participating hospitals. Additionally, clinical assessments of cervical dilatation can
only be estimates that are rounded up to the nearest centimetre. Given the total number of
women analysed for each parity group, any bias from intra- and inter-observer variations is likely
to be random with potential impact on the data spread but with minimal effects on the point esti-
mates. However, it is possible that the accuracy of our estimations could have been affected by
smaller sample sizes in the subgroups that were used to explore various obstetric characteristics.
For example, fewer women in our analysed sample presented to the labour ward at 3 cm or less
compared to 4 cm and above in all parity groups. While this reflects the prevailing practices in
the study hospitals and most maternity units around the world, it is possible that smaller num-
bers of women did not permit an equally robust analysis of the passive phase of labour and could
have contributed to even wider variability in cervical dilatation profiles during this stage.
Interpretation
Our findings provide new data from the perspective of a sub-Saharan African population to sup-
port the observations reported in similar studies by Zhang [12–14], Suzuki [16], Shi [15], and their
colleagues, which suggest that labour progresses more slowly than previously thought. Similar to
these studies, our study reveals that the variability of labour progress in a cohort of nulliparous
and multiparous women with vaginal birth is greater than generally appreciated. This variability is
apparent even in an obstetric population as selected as ours and is independent of our analysis
methods, centimetre of cervical dilatation, or cervical dilatation of the woman at admission.
Despite the general similarities in the nulliparous labour progression pattern between our
study and those by Zhang [14], Suzuki [16], and Shi [15] et al., there are important differences
in the 95th percentiles reported for sojourn times and cumulative durations of labour. Our
95th percentile times indicate that labour can even be slower than what was reported by Zhang
[14] and Shi et al. [15], in their American and Chinese populations, respectively, but not as
long as Suzuki et al. [16] reported for Japanese women. While this may be due to the differ-
ences in the methods for analysing labour progression, a more logical explanation is the het-
erogeneity in these study populations in terms of labour interventions and demographic
characteristics. For instance, oxytocin augmentation among nulliparous women was more
common in the US population (47%) studied by Zhang et al. [14] and our study population
(40%), but infrequent (6.5%) in the Japanese population studied by Suzuki et al. [16].
The described patterns of labour progress from our study deviate substantially from what
Friedman’s curve indicates [1–3]. The classic sigmoidal pattern was not observed in our aver-
age labour curves. This may be due to the fact that the majority of the women in our study

 were not admitted early enough in labour to substantially reflect the pattern of the passive
phase of labour and because of the lack of documented assessment of 9-cm dilatation in our
cohort, which precluded exploration of any deceleration between 9 and 10 cm. In his series of
500 nulliparous women [2], Friedman used the mean values of the four separate phases of indi-
vidually plotted sigmoid curves to derive the mean labour curve and reported 1.2 cm/hour as
the minimum value of ‘phase of maximum slope’ based on the 95th percentile point on the dis-
tribution curve. The nulliparous average curves from our cohort are less steep, and the 95th
percentile values from one level of dilatation to the next during the traditional active phase
yielded median rates between 0.1 and 0.5 cm/hour between 4 and 10 cm. It remains unclear to
what extent an average labour curve depicts the variability associated with individual women’s
labour progress, and its value in clinical practice is becoming increasingly questioned. The dif-
ferences illustrated by the video displays of individual labour profiles, compared to the average
labour curves for this cohort, indicate how unreliable a population average curve is in repre-
senting an individual woman’s labour progression profile.
In an attempt to overcome the shortcomings of Friedman’s labour curves, Zhang et al. [12]
proposed the use of repeated measures analysis with polynomial modelling as a superior
method for constructing labour curves, given its flexibility to fit labour data. Other investiga-
tors using the same statistical method have confirmed a similar pattern of labour curves
published by Zhang et al [12–14]. However, we found that the polynomial model was not
appropriate for our data, as it presents a behaviour that is incompatible with labour curve
modelling. Rather, we applied multistate Markov modelling to overcome the unpredictable
nature of cervical dilatation [29], since its models can accommodate the inherent randomness
in cervical dilatation over time [30] and it has the advantage of providing a better representa-
tion of real life scenarios from more angles by including empirical observations. We also
applied a nonlinear mixed model because of its advantages in terms of interpretability, parsi-
mony, and validity [31]. Although the curves obtained from our nonlinear mixed models are
similar to those constructed through polynomial models by previous authors [12, 14, 15], they
should be interpreted with caution, as the model appears dependent on extrapolation beyond
the normal range of observations for women in the sample.
An interesting finding in our study is the median cumulative duration of labour (e.g., from 4
to 10, 5 to 10, and 6 to 10 cm), which, when considered linearly, suggests that the cervix was
dilating at � 1 cm/hour. However, such interpretation hides the nonlinearity of labour progres-
sion patterns for most women and does not account for slower progress at the beginning of the
traditional active phase and faster progress when active phase is advanced. This implies that
some women within the 95th percentile boundary as shown in our study will be categorised as
having protracted labour if current labour standards were applied. For instance, a woman with
reassuring maternal and fetal conditions who remains at 4 cm for 4 hours may be subjected to
oxytocin augmentation when she could still be within her normal limits before advancing to 5
cm. Application of interventions too soon when a woman is still within the boundaries of her
normality probably accounts for escalating rates of interventions to expedite labour globally.
One subject of debate in the analysis of labour progression patterns in contemporary prac-
tice is the potential impact of oxytocin augmentation on observed labour patterns. A widely
held view is that the inclusion of women with augmented labour is likely to produce faster
labour progression profiles, and the restriction of analysis to women without labour augmen-
tation will generate labour profiles that reflect natural labour progression. However, we found
the contrary, as the exclusion of women with augmented labours from our study population
resulted in generally faster labour progression patterns. Although unexpected, this finding was
not surprising, as it reflects the impact of Friedman’s original curves and their derivative tools
on labour management even today. Women with augmented labours were those assessed by

 labour attendants as having slower than normal progression based on a preconceived expec-
tation of 1 cm/hour cervical dilatation. Therefore, their exclusion from the analysed study
population leaves a highly selected population of women whose labour progression, by the
assessment of the labour attendants, conformed to this preconceived expectation and did not
require labour augmentation. While the overall clinical implications of the altered progression
in terms of labour duration are minimal, our findings support the inclusion of women with
augmented labours in the analysis of labour progression in the context where use of oxytocin
is the norm so as to facilitate applicability of their findings.
Conclusions and recommendations
We acknowledge that the described labour patterns from this cohort may be related to the
demographic characteristics and prevailing clinical practices in our study settings. Neverthe-
less, a number of clear messages emerged from our study. First, population average labour
curves are at best estimates that may not truly reflect the variability associated with labour
progress and could potentially misclassify individual women. It appears that average labour
curves are dependent on the underlying assumptions and principles governing the statistical
methods from which they are derived. We conclude that population average labour curves are
merely useful for illustrative purposes.
Secondly, our labour progression data clearly demonstrate that a minimum cervical dilata-
tion rate of 1 cm/hour throughout the period traditionally described as active phase may be
unrealistically fast for some women and should therefore not be universally applied as a
threshold for identifying abnormally progressing labour. Likewise, for most nulliparous and
multiparous women, labour may not accelerate until a threshold of at least 5 cm is reached.
The implication is that a cervical dilatation rate slower than 1 cm/hour throughout the first
stage of labour, especially before 5 cm, should not be an indication for interventions to expe-
dite labour provided maternal and fetal vital signs and other observations are normal. It would
be useful for labour care providers to consider the upper boundaries reported in this cohort
when reviewing whether an intervention is justified. It is important to note, however, that the
presented percentile values are insufficient to define abnormal labour that requires interven-
tions to avert adverse outcomes. As this is a selected sample of women without adverse birth
outcomes, we cannot conclude from the current analysis whether women with cervical dilata-
tion progressing beyond our percentile values (or other specific boundaries) have compara-
tively higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. As cervical dilatation is a reflection of a complex
interaction of biological, physical, and psychological factors during the course of labour, it is
imperative that women with a suspicion of protracted labour be carefully evaluated to exclude
developing complications (e.g., cephalopelvic disproportion) and to ensure that the woman’s
physical and emotional needs are being met. In the absence of any problems other than a
slower than expected cervical dilatation (i.e., 1 cm/hour), it is in the interest of the woman that
expectant, supportive, and woman-centred labour care is continued.
We propose that averaged lines or curves are not used for decision-making in the manage-
ment of labour for individual women. Efforts should focus on developing individualised (or
personalised) labour management algorithms that optimize woman-centred health outcomes.
Decision-analysis models and machine learning technologies that are available today can assist
in achieving this objective.
