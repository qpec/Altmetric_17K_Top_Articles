The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a popu-
lation scale. Despite multi-sector investment along with wide-scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence support-
ing the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta-analysis of
smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22
smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps
than control conditions (g50.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52, p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate
positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g50.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions
(g50.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.33). Effects from smartphone-only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/
computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training
apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p50.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood
monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not
affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self-management tool for depression.
Future research should aim to distil which aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which populations.

Depression is now recognized as a leading cause of global
disability, impacting over 300 million people around the
world1. In countries like the US, 9% of the population may
have depression at any one time2. Beyond the personal suffer-
ing, depression is associated with unemployment, poor physi-
cal health, impaired social functioning and, in its most severe
forms, suicide3. Thus, the disorder carries a high cost for both
the individual and the society, particularly when considering
the economic burden incurred through clinical care and lost
productivity4.
Depression is a potentially treatable condition, with a range
of available medications and psychological interventions that
are supported by robust clinical evidence. While the choice of
pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy depends on many factors,
for most individuals with mild or moderate depression they
may be nearly equivalent5.
However, there are many barriers towards both of these
treatment methods. For instance, access to mental health care
remains limited, as almost half of the world’s population lives
in countries where there is less than one psychiatrist per
100,000 people6, and continued shortage in mental health care
staff is expected for both the near and long term future7,8.
Additionally, medications and psychotherapies may carry
some level of stigma (particularly among younger people),
which further limits their effectiveness9,10.
Furthermore, although these therapies demonstrate high
clinical efficacy for reducing symptoms, they may not always
bring about full and sustained remission in those treated. Finally,
many people experience either subclinical depression or resid-
ual depressive symptoms even after achieving clinical response
to treatment. Therefore, novel primary and/or adjunctive meth-
ods for reducing depression on a population scale are urgently
needed.
Digital technologies may represent a novel and viable solu-
tion. Mobile phones are among the most rapidly adopted in-
novations in recent history, and smartphone ownership con-
tinues to increase in both developed and developing coun-
tries11. Through providing ubiquitous Internet connectivity,
along with the capacity to download and run externally cre-
ated applications (“apps”), smartphone technology presents
an opportunity to transform mobile phones into devices which
could provide global, cost-effective and evidence-based men-
tal health services on demand and in real time12.
This clear therapeutic potential has triggered a wave of in-
terest and investment in mental health apps from govern-
ments, technology companies, advocacy groups, and research
groups internationally13,14. But in the enthusiasm to realize the
potential of apps for depression, it has become difficult to sep-
arate actual efficacy from overzealous aspirational claims15.
With thousands of mental health apps readily available through
Apple or Google marketplaces, finding a useful tool supported
by robust evidence to manage one’s depression is clearly a chal-
lenge for a lay person16,17. The increasing media promotion and
accessibility of apps for mental health now presents a “duty of

 care” issue towards ensuring that people have information and
understanding of evidence-based digital treatments for depres-
sion.
Recent meta-analyses have documented that various smart-
phone interventions can have positive effects on physical dis-
eases, such as diabetes18, and mental health conditions, such
as anxiety19. However, the clinical effect of smartphone inter-
ventions on symptoms of depression has yet to be established.
Thus, our aim was to examine the efficacy of delivering mental
health interventions via smartphones for reducing depressive
symptoms in both clinical and non-clinical populations. We
also sought to use subgroup and meta-regression analyses in
order to explore which aspects of smartphone interventions
are associated with greater or lesser efficacy for depressive
symptoms. The results of these meta-analyses provide the first
overall estimate of effects from such interventions, along with
informing treatment choices and future research in this area.
METHODS
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the
PRISMA statement for transparent and comprehensive report-
ing of methodology and results20. In order to eliminate re-
searcher bias, the search strategy, inclusion criteria and data
extraction, as well as the overall and pre-planned subgroup
analyses, strictly adhered to those adopted in a previous sys-
tematic review of smartphone interventions for anxiety19, as
specified in a registered online protocol (CRD42017064882).
Search strategy
We conducted an electronic search of the following data-
bases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health
Technology Assessment Database, Allied and Complementary
Medicine (AMED), Health Management Information Consor-
tium (HMIC), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, from
inception to May 1, 2017. The search applied the PICO frame-
work21, using a range of relevant terms to capture all poten-
tially eligible results relating to smartphone mental health
interventions for depressive symptoms. An additional search
of Google Scholar was implemented, and reference lists of
retrieved articles were checked to identify any further eligible
studies.
Eligibility criteria
Only English-language articles were included. Eligible stud-
ies were all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the
effects of mental health interventions delivered via smartphone
devices with at least one outcome measure for depressive
symptoms. We aimed to examine the effects of smartphone
interventions on primary depression, comorbid depression and
subclinical depressive symptoms. No restrictions were placed
on diagnosis or any other clinical or demographic characteris-
tics of eligible samples.
Three independent investigators judged article eligibility (JF
,
JN and JT), with any disagreements resolved through discus-
sion. “Smartphones” were defined as mobile phones with 3G or
4G Internet connectivity, along with the ability to download,
install and run external applications (“apps”). RCTs of interven-
tions delivered solely or in part via smartphone devices match-
ing this definition, aimed at improving mental health or well-
being (with depression as a primary or secondary outcome),
were included in the review.
Studies using either “inactive” or “active” control groups
were eligible for inclusion. “Inactive” control groups were clas-
sified as those in which participants received no intervention
during the trial period (or were put into a waitlist until pre-and-
post measures had been collected from both groups). “Active”
control groups were categorized as those which attempted to
control for the time and attention given to people in the smart-
phone intervention condition, by using apps not aimed at treat-
ing depression, in-person interventions, or other forms of ac-
tivities or patient contact. RCTs comparing smartphone inter-
ventions to antidepressant medications were also eligible for
inclusion. All eligible studies had a duration of at least one week
(thus excluding studies measuring changes in mood following a
single use of smartphone apps).
Data extraction
A systematic extraction form was used for each article to
collect the following data: a) study information (sample size,
mean age of participants, diagnostic information or relevant
inclusion criteria, study length and trial quality); b) interven-
tion features (app/program name, regularity of instructed use,
smartphone program summary, any additional intervention
components, details of the control condition); c) effects on
depressive symptoms (changes in total depressive symptoms
scored before and after smartphone and control interventions
using any clinically validated rating scale). For studies which
used more than one measure of depression, a mean total
change was calculated by pooling outcomes from each mea-
sure.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted by Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis 2.022, using a random-effects model23 to account for
between-study heterogeneity. The total difference in changes
in depressive symptoms between smartphone interventions
and control conditions were pooled to compute the overall
effect size of the former (as Hedges’ g), with 95% confidence
intervals (CI). For RCTs comparing smartphone interventions
to both inactive and active control conditions, the compara-
tive effects with active control groups were used in the primary
288
World Psychiatry 16:3 - October 2017
 analysis. After computing main effects, a sensitivity analysis
was applied to investigate effects of smartphone interventions
in RCTs which used intention-to-treat analyses or had com-
plete outcome data.
To quantify the degree to which statistical heterogeneity in
the meta-analyses arose due to between-study differences,
rather than due to chance, Cochran’s Q (with p value) and I2
were used. Included studies were also assessed using the
Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool. This examined
study quality in six areas of trial design (sequence generation,
allocation sequence concealment, blinding of participants and
personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete out-
come data, selective outcome reporting), ranking each area as
high, low or unknown for risk of bias24.
Risk of publication bias was examined using a funnel plot of
study effect sizes, and Egger’s regression test was applied to all
aforementioned analyses. Furthermore, a Duval and Tweedie’s
trim-and-fill analysis was conducted to re-calculate the pooled
effect size after removing any studies which may introduce
publication bias (i.e., small studies with large effect sizes from
the positive side of the funnel plot). Additionally, a “fail-safe
N” was used to account for the file draw problem25, estimating
the number of non-significant unpublished trials which would
be needed to cause the observed p value to exceed 0.05.
Pre-planned subgroup analyses were conducted to examine
whether effects of smartphone interventions differed when
comparing them to inactive or active control conditions. Addi-
tionally, we carried out a range of exploratory post-hoc sub-
group and meta-regression analyses in order to examine which
factors may impact the effectiveness of smartphone interven-
tions, particularly with regards to sample details (i.e., clinical
population, age, gender) and treatment characteristics (i.e.,
psychological basis, technological features and length of
smartphone interventions).
RESULTS
The search returned a total of 1,517 records; 981 after dupli-
cates were excluded. Title and abstract screening removed a
further 913 articles. Full versions were retrieved for 68 papers,
of which 16 met eligibility criteria. Two further articles were
retrieved following an additional search of Google Scholar.
Thus, 18 unique RCTs were included in the meta-analysis,
assessing the effects of 22 different smartphone-delivered
mental health interventions. The article inclusion/exclusion
process is shown in Figure 1.
Characteristics of included studies
Full details of each study are displayed in Table 1. Outcome
data were available from 18 RCTs. Two papers reported outcome
data in a format not suited for meta-analysis, but the corre-
sponding authors provided the raw data to enable inclusion26,30.
Mean sample ages ranged from 18 to 59 years (median 39 years).
All but two studies32,34 used some indication of mental health
issues as inclusion criteria. For clinical populations, two studies

with bipolar disorder28,30, one young people in primary care
with any mental health condition40. Others recruited individuals
from the general population with self-reported mild-to-moder-
ate depression26,27,39,41, suicidal thoughts/tendencies42, proba-
ble attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)37, anxiety
disorders29,33, insomnia31, or symptoms of post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD)35. One further study examined older adults
with memory complaints38.
Smartphone interventions lasted between 4 and 24 weeks.
Depressive symptoms were measured as a primary outcome in
12 studies, and as a secondary outcome in six. The following
tools were used: the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale44 depression
subscale in three studies29,39,40; the Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression scale45 in four31,32,38,41; the Beck Depression
Inventory II46 in three34,36,43; the Patient Health Questionnaire47
in six26,27,33,35,42,43; the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression48 in
one30; the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale49 in one37; and the
Montgomery-A
˚sberg Depression Rating Scale50 in one28.
The results from the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessments are
displayed in Table 2. This shows that the most frequent risk fac-
tor for bias was inadequate blinding of participants, with only
five of 18 studies using intervention-matched comparators for
which the participants would not be aware of their treatment/
control status or of the hypothesized outcomes of the trial.

 effects from each app trialled. A random-effects meta-analysis
revealed a small-to-moderate positive effect size of smart-
phone mental health interventions for reducing depressive
symptoms in comparison to control conditions (18 studies,
N53,414, g50.383, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52, p<0.001).
Although there was heterogeneity across the study data
(Q580.8, p<0.01, I2574.0%), there was no evidence of publica-
tion bias (p50.255 in Egger’s regression test), and the fail-safe
N was 567 (estimating that 567 unpublished “null” studies
would need to exist for the actual p value to exceed 0.05). A
trim-and-fill analysis identified no outlier studies, and thus
did not change the observed effect size.
When considering only the studies which used intention-
to-treat analyses and/or reported complete outcome data, we
found a similar effect of smartphone interventions on depres-
sive symptoms (16 studies, N53,320, g50.399, 95% CI: 0.25-0.55,
p<0.001; Q580.0, I2577.5%).
In our pre-planned subgroup analyses, we found that effect
sizes were significantly greater when comparing smartphone
interventions to inactive conditions than when using active
control conditions (Q59.76, p50.002; Figure 3). Compared to
inactive control conditions, the pooled effect size across 13
smartphone interventions (N51,674) was g50.558 (95% CI: 0.38-
0.74), indicating a moderate effect on depressive symptoms.
However, when compared to active control conditions, smart-
phone interventions had only a small effect size on depressive
symptoms (12 studies, N52,381, g50.216, 95% CI: 0.10-0.33).
Both studies with active and inactive controls had significant het-
erogeneity, but no evidence of publication bias (Table 3).
Population characteristics and effects on depressive
symptoms
We also applied post-hoc subgroup analyses to studies that
had used mood disorder inclusion criteria, in order to explore
which populations smartphone interventions may be most
effective for. As shown in Table 4, the only populations in
which smartphone interventions significantly reduced depres-
sive symptoms were those with self-reported mild-to-moder-
ate depression (5 studies, N51,890, g50.518, 95% CI: 0.28-
0.75, p<0.001; Q536.6, I2583.6). There was no significant
effect among the smaller samples with major depressive disor-
der, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders (two studies each).
Mixed-effects meta-regressions were applied to explore wheth-
er continuous moderators of average age, gender distribution
and sample size affected study findings, but found no indica-
tion that these factors influenced observed effect sizes (all
p>0.2).
Intervention characteristics and effects on depressive
symptoms
In order to gain insight into which aspects of smartphone
interventions make them effective for depressive symptoms, we
performed further comparative subgroup analyses after separat-
ing studies on the basis of common characteristics, such as
intervention components, feedback types, and therapeutic ap-
proaches applied. The common features examined, and the
results of all subgroup comparisons, are detailed in full in Table 5.
These analyses showed that smartphone interventions which
involved “in-person” (i.e., human) feedback had small, non-
significant effects on depressive symptoms (g50.137, 95% CI:
20.08 to 0.35, p50.214), whereas those which did not use in-
person feedback had moderate positive effects (g50.465, 95%
CI: 0.30-0.63, p<0.001). The difference between these subgroups
was statistically significant (p50.017).
Additionally, the effects of smartphone interventions which
were delivered entirely via the smartphone device (10 studies,
N52,178, g50.479, 95% CI: 0.27-0.69, p<0.001) appeared
larger than those which were not self-contained smartphone-
only interventions (8 studies, N51,236, g50.241, 95% CI: 0.09-
0.39, p50.002), although the difference between these sub-
groups fell short of significance (p50.07).
Similarly, interventions which provided “in-app feedback”,
such as summary statistics and progress scores, had greater
effect sizes (g50.534, 95% CI: 0.26-0.81, p<0.001) than those
which did not have in-app feedback (g50.266, 95% CI: 0.14-
0.39, p<0.001), although again the difference between sub-
groups was non-significant (p50.082).
The only other notable finding was that the studies of cog-
nitive training apps had a significantly (p50.004) smaller effect
size on depression outcomes (four studies, N5836, g50.123,

 95% CI: 20.012 to 0.26, p50.074) than those which focused on
mental health (15 studies, N52,578, g50.438, 95% CI: 0.28-
0.60, p<0.001).
The use of mood-monitoring softwares, cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT)-based interventions and mindfulness training
did not appear to influence study effect sizes (all p>0.1 between
subgroups with vs. without these features).
A mixed-effects meta-regression of study effect size with
intervention length (in weeks) found indication of a slight neg-
ative relationship between the two, with smaller effects observ-
ed from longer interventions, although this correlation fell short
of statistical significance (B5–0.025, SE50.014, Z521.72, p5
0.086).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to examine
the efficacy of smartphone interventions for depressive symp-
toms. Our systematic search identified 18 RCTs, examining 22
mental health interventions delivered via smartphone devices,
across a total of 3,414 participants. Thus, the literature base
for this particular area has evolved swiftly, and is considerably
larger than that found for smartphone interventions in other
conditions. Around twice the number of eligible interventions
and participants were identified compared to recent meta-
analyses of smartphone interventions for diabetes and anxi-
ety18,19. Furthermore, 14 of the 18 eligible studies were pub-
lished within the last two years, which may reflect both the
increased research interest in using apps for mental health13
and the increased ownership, access and use of mental health
apps by patients and health care organizations.
The main analysis found that smartphone interventions had
a moderate positive effect on depressive symptoms, with no
indication of publication bias affecting these findings. How-
ever, our subgroup analyses found that the effects of smart-
phone interventions were substantially larger when compared
to inactive (g50.56) than active (g50.22) control conditions.
The same pattern of effect sizes was observed in our meta-
analysis of smartphone interventions for anxiety19. Previous
reviews of other technological interventions for mental health
conditions have reported similar findings, as a meta-analysis
of virtual reality interventions for treating anxiety found signif-
icant effects in comparison to inactive controls, but no differ-
ence from traditional psychological treatments51. The extent
to which the observed effects on depressive symptoms arise
from using the device itself, rather than the psychotherapeutic
components of the intervention, should be examined and
quantified in future research, to further explore the notion of a
“digital placebo” influencing findings52.
We also explored other factors which may drive the effects of
smartphone interventions for depressive symptoms, using a
range of post-hoc subgroup analyses. With regards to popula-
tion type, significant benefits of smartphone apps were only
found for those with self-reported mild-to-moderate depres-
sion. This may be due to variations in subgroup sample sizes, as
the majority of studies were conducted in non-clinical popula-
tions, thus leaving the analyses for major depression and bipolar
disorder underpowered to detect significant effects. Nonethe-
less, the nature of smartphone interventions does appear to
position them as an ideal self-management tool for those with
less severe levels of depression. The observed effects indicate
that these interventions are well-placed for delivering low-
intensity treatment within a stepped-care approach53, or even
prevention of mild-to-moderate depression among the millions
of people affected by subclinical symptoms54. The findings that
neither age nor gender had any relationship with study effect
size indicate that smartphone interventions may be applicable
to a broad range of individuals.
With regards to intervention features, we found that those
delivered entirely via smartphone devices had significantly great-
er effects than those which also involved other human/comput-
erized aspects. Similarly, those using “in-person feedback” com-
ponents had significantly smaller effects than those which did
not. It seems counterintuitive that additional features/human
feedback would decrease smartphone effectiveness. However,
this relationship is likely due to the fact that apps not relying on
external components have been designed as more comprehen-
sive and self-contained tools. Indeed, we found some indication
that studies which provided in-app feedback were more effective
than those without. It should also be noted that the single study
which compared a therapist-guided smartphone intervention to
the same intervention without therapist support found equal
effects across the two groups33.
Smartphone interventions based on CBT significantly reduc-
ed depressive symptoms, as did those which incorporated as-
pects of mindfulness training or mood monitoring. However, we
were not able to elucidate which of the features were most ef-
fective. A previous study which directly compared smartphone
apps based on principles of either behavioral activation or
mindfulness also found no overall difference between the two
approaches55. Nonetheless, results showed that those with more
severe depression experienced greater benefits from the be-
havioral activation app, whereas those with mild depression
benefitted more from the mindfulness app. Understanding
both which psychological interventions are best delivered via
a smartphone and which patient populations will most bene-
fit from smartphone-based interventions will require further
research. As smartphone apps for mental health are becom-
ing easier to create, focusing research on specific populations
will enable more personalized and likely effective uses.
The trend-level negative correlation between effectiveness
and length of intervention indicates that another factor to con-
sider when designing optimal apps is user engagement56. Lower
rates of user engagement over time have been found in numer-
ous other mental health app studies57-59. Higher rates of engage-
ment have also been associated with those apps designed for
brief interactions60, suggesting the need to customize interven-
tions to the ways people use smartphones. While there is early
296
World Psychiatry 16:3 - October 2017
 research on the optimal design and presentation of telehealth
platforms61,62, the impact on patient engagement and outcomes
remains an area of nascent exploration. Understanding other
factors related to app use, such as socioeconomic status, health
literacy63, technology literacy and health status64,65, also remain
important targets for further research.
A major strength of this meta-analysis is the strict adher-
ence to a registered protocol which exactly described the
search strategy, inclusion criteria, data extraction and analytic
procedures. However, one drawback is that we only included
smartphone interventions which have been evaluated in RCTs.
Given the wide availability of mental health apps, ensuring
that consumers and clinicians have access to evidence-based
interventions is vital for informed decision making. While the
sheer number of apps available, and their frequent updat-
ing14,66, makes rating each impossible, research elucidating
the components of effective apps and highlighting best practi-
ces may offer information immediately useful for clinical care.
Of note, future studies must identify and report safety con-
cerns regarding the use of smartphone interventions67. The
ability of smartphones to immediately register entered mood
data, compute if responses exceed a certain threshold, and if
so activate emergency response systems, offer real time safety
monitoring absent from traditional depression treatment.
Another limitation is the significant heterogeneity found
across the analyses. Although this heterogeneity was statisti-
cally accounted for by the random-effects models when com-
puting the effect size and respective p values, this still does
indicate that significant between-study differences existed,
even when subgrouping by sample/intervention type. Due to
the extent of differences between studies, it was difficult to
establish the single most effective components of smartphone
interventions, or determine which populations these interven-
tions are best suited for. Future studies which directly test
alternative approaches against each other in non-inferiority
controlled trials, while assessing outcome variation between
subsamples of participants55, would add great value to our
understanding of what would constitute the optimal smart-
phone app for depressive symptoms, and in which popula-
tions these methods may be most effective.
In conclusion, the evidence to date indicates that mental
health interventions delivered via smartphone devices can
reduce depressive symptoms. However, delivering treatments
via a smartphone introduces several new aspects which need
to be considered, beyond the platform change alone. Specifi-
cally, we have yet to establish the ways in which user engage-
ment, feedback loops, expectancy effects, and individual pa-
tient characteristics influence intervention outcomes. Rather
than a barrier, these variables represent new opportunities for
further research to optimize and personalize smartphone-
based interventions.
Given the early indication of efficacy, and rapidly growing
empirical research base, it is possible to envisage that contin-
ued technological advances will ultimately lead to scalable
and cost-effective digital treatments for depressive symp-
toms56,68. Thus, along with continuing to design and evaluate
optimal apps, further research should also be dedicated to-
wards establishing feasible methods for implementing smart-
phone-based interventions within health care systems.
