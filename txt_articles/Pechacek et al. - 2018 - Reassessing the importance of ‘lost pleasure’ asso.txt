Introduction Benefit–cost analyses of tobacco 
regulations include estimates of the informed choice 
of smokers to continue smoking. Few studies have 
focused on subjective feelings associated with continued 
smoking. This study estimates how smoker discontent 
and regret relate to risk perceptions and health concerns.
Methods We analysed data from a 2015 nationally 
representative, online survey of 1284 US adult current 
smokers. Information was collected on regret, intention 
to quit, perceived addiction, risk perceptions and health 
concerns. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting 
for sociodemographics and health status was used to 
examine factors associated with smoker discontent.
Results More than 80% of current smokers report high 
(22.5%) or very high (59.8%) discontent due to inability 
to quit, perceived addiction and regret about having 
started to smoke. Higher levels of discontent did not 
vary significantly by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education or 
income (adjusted odds ratios (AORs) 0.5–1.2). Compared 
with the smokers expressing low (5.9%) or very low 
(3.6%) discontent, those expressing higher levels of 
discontent perceived their health status as fair/poor 
(AOR=2.3), worried most of the time about lung cancer 
(AOR=4.6) and felt they were more likely to develop lung 
cancer in the future (AOR=5.1).
Conclusion The proportion of smokers who might 
be characterised as having a preference to continue 
smoking are greatly outnumbered by addicted, 
discontent and concerned smokers who want to quit and 
regret ever having started to smoke. These discontent 
smokers could have a substantial net welfare gain if new 
regulations helped them escape their concerns about the 
health effects from continuing smoking.
InTRoduCTIon
Tobacco control efforts in the USA continue to 
advance, and the prevalence of current cigarette 
smoking among adults and youth are at historic low 
levels.1–7 Effective implementation of federal regu-
lations of cigarettes and tobacco products under the 
authority assigned to the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) by the 2009 Family Smoking Preven-
tion and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control 
Act) is important to sustain this progress.2 8–11 
FDA is required as part of the federal rule-making 
process to conduct an economic benefit–cost 
analysis of all proposed regulations.12 However, 
significant questions have been raised about how 
the benefit–cost analyses of the FDA regulation 
on tobacco products should be conducted.13–19 A 
final FDA rule requiring graphic warning labels 
on cigarette packaging has not been implemented 
in part due to concerns about the benefit–cost 
analysis presented in the draft rule.19–22 The 
benefit–cost analysis was based on widely accepted 
structural welfare analysis methods to quantify 
the utility with and without the proposed regu-
lation.18 19 23 24 Significant concerns were noted 
when this analysis indicated that the potential 
health benefits of implementing graphic warnings 
on US cigarette packages should be discounted by 
50% or more due to ‘lost pleasure’ (ie, consumer 
surplus).13–17 Leading health economists were 
convened by the US Department of Health and 
Human Services to consider the recommended 
methods for calculating the economic impact of 
potential FDA regulatory actions on cigarettes or 
other tobacco products.13 18 25 Subsequently, Cutler 
and colleagues offered four possible approaches 
to the contentious issue of estimating consumer 
surplus in benefit–cost analyses concerning addic-
tive goods: (1) willingness to pay for cessation, (2) 
direct measurement of subjective well-being, (3) 
structural welfare analysis methods (like those used 
by FDA in the graphic warning labels analysis)19 
and (4) rational benchmark. Of these approaches, 
Cutler and colleagues identified the ‘Rational 
Benchmark’ approach as the most feasible. The 
rational benchmark approach uses criterion (such 
as not showing high nicotine dependence and/
or having completed a college degree) to identify 
smokers who are more likely to be well informed 
and acting more rationally in making an informed 
choice to continue smoking.25–27 In a hypothetical 
regulation example, this approach suggested that 
the utility offsets to health benefits would be much 
smaller, in the range of 5%–20% and likely in the 
lower end of this range.18 However, much uncer-
tainty remained in calculating the economic offset 
ratio using structural and rational benchmark 
approaches (eg, with possible offset ratios shown as 
varying from 0% to 50%).19 25 Therefore, an alter-
native willingness-to-pay break-even approach was 
used in the recent final ‘deeming’ rule to assert FDA 
authority over all additional tobacco products not 
listed in the 2009 Tobacco Control Act, including 
cigars, pipe tobacco, waterpipe tobacco, electronic 
nicotine delivery systems and other novel tobacco 
products such as certain dissolvable products and 
gels.28 Thus, the underlying logic of assessing 
tobacco regulations using methods grounded in 
rational choice theory still remains a controversial

issue.13 14 29–32 Evidence shows that both ‘enjoyment’ and ‘relief 
from cravings’ are often cited by smokers as the reasons they 
continue to smoke.33–35 However, as Schelling asserted, individ-
uals effectively divide themselves into two conflicting selves.36 37 
The current rational choice theory approach only focuses on 
‘lost pleasure’ from being induced to quit by a new regulation, 
while many, if not almost all, smokers without the inducement 
would continue to suffer a net welfare loss from their inability 
to stop smoking: they regret having started to smoke as adoles-
cents and worry about dying prematurely from smoking, but 
they feel addicted and unable to quit.13–16 29–31 38–44 While some 
evidence supports this position,32 there is little recent data 
describing which types of smokers in the USA express regret, 
nor how intention to quit, perceived addiction and health 
concerns relate to this regret.
In 2002, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) based in 
the UK released a report highlighting that 83% of smokers 
expressed regret for having started to smoke and described 
smokers feeling misery, disgust and social stigma from their 
inability to quit smoking.45 In an editorial, Slovic reported 
data from an unpublished 2000–2001 survey in the USA 
indicating that more than 80% of current smokers reported 
that they would not start smoking if they had it to do over 
again. When asked ‘why not’, they expressed disgust and 
misery about their continuing smoking.30 Smoker regret in 
the USA has been assessed in the Gallup Poll, with 88% of 
smokers surveyed in 2012 indicating they wished they had 
never started.46 The most extensive data on regret have been 
reported by the International Tobacco Control Policy Eval-
uation Project (ITC), which has tracked a variety of percep-
tions among smokers in 20 countries (including feeling 
addicted, intentions to quit and regret over having started to 
smoke).40 42 43 47 Measurements of US smokers were reported 
across eight overlapping waves from 2002 to 2010–2011 and 
indicated that 88%–90% of smokers expressed regret over 
this period.47 However, there are only a limited number of 
analyses of these ITC data, with only one detailed analysis of 
US data from 2002.42 43 Fong and colleagues reported that 
91.2% of smokers from the USA agreed or strongly agreed 
that they regretted having started smoking, which was 
consistent with the high prevalence of regret reported in the 
unpublished UK ASH and Slovic estimates.29 40 45 O’Connor 
and colleagues recently explored the relationships between 
smokers’ feelings of regret and other characteristics such as 
delay discounting and worries about future health.48 They 
reported that among US adult smokers completing a 2010 
web-based survey, 84.4% expressed regret and that regret was 
positively associated with worries about the negative impact 
of their smoking on health, quality of life and how much they 
spend on cigarettes.48 Finally, we recently reported that in 
2014, 71.5% of US adult smokers expressed regret and that 
older and non-Hispanic white smokers were most likely to 
report regret.44
This paper provides data from a 2015 nationally representa-
tive sample of US adult smokers that estimates the proportion of 
smokers who feel addicted, express an intention to quit smoking 
and regret having started. These three variables are evaluated 
together as an index of smokers’ discontent with their smoking, 
and we examine how this index relates to perceived addiction 
and concerns about the health effects of smoking. This index 
could be a potential rational benchmark to estimate the propor-
tion of smokers who may experience net welfare loss from 
implementation of a policy or regulation.
METhods
Data were obtained from the 2015 Tobacco Products and Risk 
Perceptions Survey (TPRPS), a national, cross-sectional survey 
of US adults. The TPRPS was administered by the Georgia 
State University (GSU) Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science, 
and this study was approved by the GSU Institutional Review 
Board. A probability sample was drawn from GfK’s Knowl-
edgePanel, yielding a completion rate of 75% (n=6091) after 
inviting a total of 8135 KnowledgePanel members. An additional 
40 respondents were excluded, a priori, because they refused to 
answer at least 50% of the survey questions, resulting in a final 
survey sample of 6051 participants. For the present study, we 
restricted the study sample to only current smokers (n=1284). 
In order to adjust for sampling and non-sampling error, data 
were weighted using an iterative proportional fitting (ranking) 
procedure. Demographic and geographic distributions for sex, 
age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, census region, 
metropolitan area and internet access obtained from the March 
2015 Current Population Survey were used as benchmarks for 
the survey weights.
Measures
Cigarette smoking status
Respondents who reported not having smoked at least 100 
cigarettes in their lives were classified as never smokers. Of the 
remaining respondents, those who reported having smoked at 
least 100 cigarettes and reported currently smoking cigarettes 
‘every day’ or ‘some days’ were classified as current smokers.
Nicotine dependency and perceptions and beliefs of addictiveness
 Smoking level was assessed using an item that assessed how many 
cigarettes they smoked on an average day that they smoked. The 
responses were categorised as: 1–5 cigarettes/day, 6–10 ciga-
rettes/day, 11–15 cigarettes/day and more than 15 cigarettes/
day.49 Time to first cigarette was measured using ‘How soon 
after you wake do you use a tobacco or electronic vapor product’ 
with the following response choices: ‘within 5 
min’, ‘6–30 
min’, 
‘31–60 
min’ and ‘after 60 
min’.50 For some analyses, responses 
were dichotomised into ‘equal to or less than 30 
min’ and ‘more 
than 30 
min’.51
Participants were asked if they considered themselves addicted 
to cigarettes, with response options: ‘not at all’, ‘yes, somewhat 
addicted’, ‘yes, very addicted’ and ‘I don’t know’. The ‘I don’t 
know’ responses, which were a small number (n=39), were 
excluded from the analysis. Respondents were also asked, ‘To 
what extent, if at all, do you agree that nicotine is the main 
substance in tobacco that makes people become addicted to 
tobacco products?’ using a 5-point Likert scale (‘strongly disagree’ 
to ‘strongly agree’) and ‘I don’t know’ as response choices. For 
this study, we recoded responses as ‘disagree’, ‘neither disagree 
nor agree’ and ‘agree’ and excluded ‘I don’t know’ (n=120). 
Finally, we assessed their craving for cigarettes by asking, ‘Do 
you ever have strong cravings to smoke cigarettes?’. Response 
options were ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘I don’t know’ (excluded from anal-
ysis, n=45).
Quit intention
Quit intention was assessed by asking respondents about their 
plan for quitting smoking cigarettes. Responses of ‘intend to quit 
in the next 7 days’ and ‘intend to quit in the next month’ were 
combined into a single group ‘Planning to quit in next 1 
month’, 
‘intend to quit in the next 6 months’ and ‘intend to quit in the 
next year’ were combined into a single variable ‘Planning to Quit

Discontent Index.
in next >1 
month to a year’, whereas responses of ‘intend to quit 
someday, but not within the next year’ and ‘never plan to quit’ 
were maintained as separate categories.
Smoker regret
Regret from continued smoking was assessed by responses to 
the question, ‘If I had it to do over again, I would not have 
started smoking cigarettes’, on a 5-point Likert agreement scale 
(‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’). For most analyses in 
this study, responses were considered in three categories: with 
‘strongly disagree’ or ‘disagree’ classified as not having smoker 
regret, ‘neither disagree or agree’ classified as neutral and ‘agree’ 
or ‘strongly agree’ classified as smoker regret. Respondents were 
subsequently asked ‘Why did you answer that way?’ in an open-
ended question. To minimise response bias, questions about 
regret were separated from questions about health risk, quit 
intentions and addiction.
Perceptions of lung cancer risk
Respondents’ perceptions of lung cancer risk were assessed by 
three items: (1) ‘How likely do you think it is that you develop 
lung cancer in the future?’. Response choices were ‘very unlikely’, 
‘somewhat unlikely’, ‘neither unlikely nor likely’, ‘somewhat 
likely’ and ‘very likely’. For analyses, ‘very (un)likely’ and 
‘somewhat (un)likely’ were collapsed into unlikely or likely cate-
gories, respectively. (2) ‘Imagine the average cigarette smoker. 
How much higher is that person’s risk of getting lung cancer, 
compared to those who have never used any tobacco or elec-
tronic vapor product?’, and (3) ‘How much higher is your risk 
of getting lung cancer, compared to those who have never used 
any tobacco or electronic vapor product?’ These two items were 
measured using a 7-point response scale ranging from ‘about the 
same’ (=0) to ‘much higher’ (=6).
Respondent worry about lung cancer was assessed with, 
‘How often do you worry about getting lung cancer?’. Response 
options were ‘rarely or never’, ‘sometimes’, ‘often’ and ‘all the 
time.’ Respondent knowledge about the cure rate for lung cancer 
was assessed with, ‘Overall, how many people who develop lung 
cancer do you think are cured?’. Response options were ‘less 
than one quarter’, ‘about one quarter’, ‘about half’, ‘about three 
quarters’ and ‘nearly all’.
Perceived health risks from smoking
To assess respondents’ perceptions of the health risks of smoking, 
they were asked to ‘Imagine that you just began smoking ciga-
rettes [every day or only once in a while, say at parties or with 
friends]. What do you think your chances are of having each 
of the following happen to you if you continue to smoke ciga-
rettes [every day or only once in a while]?’. For each of every day 
or once in a while, they rated their perceived chances of ‘lung 
cancer’, ‘lung disease other than lung cancer (such as COPD 
and emphysema)’, ‘heart disease’, ‘become addicted’ and ‘early/
premature death’ on a 7-point response scale ranging from ‘no 
chance’ (=0) to ‘very good chance’ (=6). Responses of ‘I don’t 
know’ were excluded from the analyses. In order to minimise 
possible bias due to question order, the order of these questions 
was randomised. Additionally, questions about behaviours were 
positioned early before attitudes and beliefs were assessed.
Index of smokers’ discontent
For figure 1, the responses from items smoker regret, 
perceived addiction and intention to quit were used to create 
a classification grid to assign a score from 1=low 
discontent 
to 5=high 
discontent (see online supplementary figure S1). 
Smokers who reported not having smoker regret, never plan 
to quit and not at all addicted or somewhat addicted, or not 
at all addicted and plan to quit someday were classified as low 
discontent. Smokers who reported smoker regret and somewhat 
or very addicted and planned to quit in the next year or less 
were classified as high discontent. The three levels of perceived 
addiction (1=not at all, 2=yes, somewhat addicted and 3=yes, 
very addicted) were combined with the four levels of intention 
to quit (1=planning 
to quit in next 1 
month, 2=planning 
to 
quit in next >1 
month to a year, 3=intend 
to quit someday, but 
not within the next year and 4=never plan to quit) to create 
a four-level Quit+Addiction code: 1=(intent to quit=1 
and 
addiction=2 
or 3); 1=(intent to quit=2 
and addiction=3); 
2=(intent to quit=2 
and addiction=2); 2=(intent to quit=3 
and 
addiction=2 
or 3); 3=(intent to quit=1 
or 2 and addiction=1); 
3=(intent to quit=4 
and addiction=3); 4=(intent to quit=3 
or 
4 and addiction=1); and 4=(intent to quit=4 
and addiction=2).
Discontent index was coded as:
 
►
1=not 
having 
smoker 
regret 
(1 
and 
2) 
and 
Quit+Addiction=4.
 
►
2=not having smoker regret (1 and 2) and Quit+Addic-
tion=2 
or 3.

(1 
and

and

►
5=having

or

Sociodemographics
Respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics were obtained 
from profile surveys administered by GfK52 to all Knowl-
edgePanel panellists and included self-reported sex, age, race/
ethnicity, educational attainment, annual household income, 
region, health status and presence of children under 18 years 
old.

data. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to 
examine predictors of smoker regret while adjusting for socio-
demographic factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, annual

REsulTs
The smoking prevalence estimates by sex, age, race/ethnicity, 
US region of residence, perceived health status and presence of 
children under 18 years in the home are shown in online supple-
mentary table S1A. Estimates from our surveys have been shown 
to agree with other nationally representative data.52
Table 1 provides estimates of smokers’ perceived addiction 
to cigarettes by sex, age, education, race/ethnicity, US region 
of residence, perceived health status and presence of children 
under 18 years in the home. Over 80% of smokers perceive 
themselves as somewhat or very addicted to cigarettes. 
Female, older, white non-Hispanic smokers who reported 
poorer health status and from households without children 
under age 18 years perceived themselves as more addicted to 
cigarettes.
Table 2 provides estimates of smokers’ intention to quit 
smoking by sex, age, race/ethnicity, US region of residence, 
perceived health status and presence of children under 18 
years in the home. Intentions to quit were high across the 
demographic categories, with about 34% (95% CI 29.8 to 
37.3) planning to quit at some time, and 35% planning to 
quit in the next year (95% CI 31.5 to 39.0). Intentions to 
quit were higher among smokers with more education and 
higher incomes.
Table 3 presents the weighted percentage of respondent 
characteristics by smokers’ regret status measured as ‘If you 
had it to do over again, you would not have started smoking’. 
More than 70% of smokers expressed regret about having 
started to smoke. Smokers’ regret was high among all demo-
graphic groups and was higher among females, older and 
white non-Hispanic respondents and was highest among 
those reported a fair/poor perceived health status. Smokers 
self-reporting that they felt very addicted also expressed 
more regret (see online supplementary figure S2). Examples 
of open-ended responses to question about regret, ‘Why did 
you answer that way?’ are shown in online supplementary 
figure S3.
Figure 1 displays estimates for a possible ‘rational bench-
mark’ groups of smokers: namely, those that might be classified 
as making the choice to continue smoking (ie, lack of regret, 
perceiving to be not addicted to cigarettes and never planning 
to quit) versus the discontent smokers (ie, having regret, feeling 
addicted and wanting to quit in the next year or less). This latter

classified as having no regret and no plan to quit smoking is 
considerably smaller (3.6%).
Table 4 presents demographics, perceived nicotine depen-
dency and perceived lung cancer risk and worry by discontent 
level. Respondents classified as having ‘low discontent’ (rated 
1 or 2) were compared with those with ‘moderate’ (rated 3) 
or ‘high’ (rated 4 or 5) discontent. Adjusted ORs (AORs) were 
computed by multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for 
gender, age, race/ethnicity, household income and perceived 
health status. Respondents reporting having their first smoke 
after 30 min compared with those who smoke within 30 min 
are less likely to report having high discontent level (AOR=0.4, 
95% CI 0.2 to 0.9). Smokers who are more likely to perceive 
that they will develop lung cancer in the future compared with 
those who perceive themselves less likely had higher odds for 
experiencing high discontent (AOR 5.1, 95% CI 2.2 to 12.0). 
Online supplementary figure S2 provides additional perceived 
risk for other smoking-related health conditions by discontent 
index. Smokers experiencing high discontent also felt they had 
a higher chance of early or premature death if they continued 
to smoke every day.
dIsCussIon
Among this nationally representative sample of current adult 
smokers in the USA, only a very small proportion report they 
did not plan to quit sometime in the future, did not consider 
themselves addicted to cigarettes and did not express regret 
for having started to smoke. Not only do a high proportion 
of smokers by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education and house-
hold income commonly perceive themselves as addicted to 
cigarettes and express regret for having started to smoke, 
but these smokers rate their worry and concern as higher for 
dying from lung cancer and premature death. These percep-
tions together with the expressed negative feelings about why 
they regret having started smoking (see reported feelings in 
online supplementary figure S3) agree with what the ASH 
survey and Slovic have called a picture of misery.30 45 Thus, 
within the rational benchmark approach suggested by Cutler

statement?’ Response options were: strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, neither disagree nor agree, somewhat agree and strongly agree.
and colleagues as the most feasible for estimating the benefit–
cost of tobacco regulations,27 the findings shown in figure 1 
suggest that the proportion of smokers who might be char-
acterised as having a preference to continue smoking would 
be greatly outnumbered by the addicted, discontent and 
concerned smokers who want to quit and regret ever having 
started to smoke. Furthermore, these findings suggest that 
the second approach considered by Cutler and colleagues, 
namely measuring what happens to smokers’ subjective 
well-being when they quit smoking, should receive greater 
attention. As noted by Cutler and colleagues and in recent 
research,27 32 there are limited cohort data showing that 
subjective well-being increased among smokers who quit53; 
however, ex-smokers do report being happier.54–59 Concerns 
about the methodology of quantifying such changes in 
subjective well-being into monetary values are relevant.60 61 
However, if it is accurate, as suggested by our results, then 
the number of smokers who may be considered as having 
some net welfare loss from a new regulation is very small. 
The number of smokers who would have a substantial net 
welfare gain (even if difficult to quantify) by being helped 
by the new regulation in escaping the state of misery from 
continuing smoking is much larger. This suggests that the 
provisions within Office of Management and Budget Circular 
A-4 would justify excluding an adjustment for consumer 
surplus from the benefit–cost analyses of new FDA regu-
lations of cigarettes and/or giving greater emphasis to the 
social welfare gains of quitting.12 14
lIMITATIons
First, the use of the internet panel may raise concerns about 
sample representativeness, especially if the panel has been used 
in prior tobacco research. Mitigating this concern, however, 
is internal research by GfK that suggests minimal panel 
conditioning from participation in prior tobacco research.62 
Second, the data are based on self-report, and biochemical 
verification of cigarette smoking and use of other products 
could not be conducted; however, the validity of self-re-
ported cigarette smoking in surveys has been confirmed.2 63

What this paper adds
 
► There is significant debate about how the benefit–cost 
analysis of tobacco regulations in the USA should be 
conducted.
 
► A ‘rational benchmark’ approach has been recommended 
to replace the standard structural welfare analysis (eg, 
estimating consumer surplus or ‘lost pleasure’) grounded in 
rational choice theory.
 
► Limited data are available to define preference to continue 
smoking based on subjective feelings of regret about having 
started to smoke, discontent with inability to quit and 
perceived risk of disease and premature death caused by 
continuing to smoke.
 
► Most smokers report feeling addicted, discontent and 
concerned and therefore want to quit and regret ever having 
started to smoke. The proportion of smokers reporting no 
regret about having started to smoke, not feeling addicted 
and never planning to quit is very small.
 
► The study findings support the inclusion of a reduction in 
smokers’ discontent and an improvement in subjective well-
being in cost and benefit analyses of the economic impact of 
tobacco regulations.
Third, question order and placement can produce potential 
response bias in assessment of risk perceptions and regret. 
To mitigate this concern, the questionnaire was structured to 
separate regret assessments from other measures of risk and 
product use.
ConClusIon
Among this nationally representative sample of current adult 
smokers in the USA, only a very small proportion report they 
did not plan to quit sometime in the future, did not consider 
themselves addicted to cigarettes and did not express regret 
for having started to smoke. Thus, these results suggest that 
a large proportion of smokers could have a substantial net 
welfare gain with new regulation that enable them to escape 
the state of misery from continuing smoking. Hence, esti-
mating net welfare gain rather than consumer welfare loss 
should be emphasised in policy analyses.
