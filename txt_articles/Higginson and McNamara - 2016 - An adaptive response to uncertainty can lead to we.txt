Background and objectives: Peoples’ attempts to lose weight by low calorie diets often result in weight
gain because of over-compensatory overeating during lapses. Animals usually respond to a change in
food availability by adjusting their foraging effort and altering how much energy reserves they store. But
in many situations the long-term availability of food is uncertain, so animals may attempt to estimate it
to decide the appropriate level of fat storage.
Methodology: We report the results of a conceptual model of feeding in which the animal knows
whether food is currently abundant or limited, but does not know the proportion of time, there will
be an abundance in the long-term and has to learn it.
Results: If the food supply is limited much of the time, such as during cycles of dieting attempts, the
optimal response is to gain a lot of weight when food is abundant.
Conclusions and implications: This implies that recurring attempts to diet, by signalling to the body that
the food supply is often insufficient, will lead to a greater fat storage than if food was always abundant.
Our results shed light on the widespread phenomenon of weight gain during weight cycling and indicate
possible interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity.

 INTRODUCTION
Overweight and obese people are frequently able to
lose weight but are unable to maintain such losses
long term [1], which is why a large proportion of in-
dividuals are on diets at any given time [2]. Repeated
weight loss and gain are referred to as yo-yo dieting
or weight cycling [2]. Whilst most people can lose
weight during diets, weight gain between diets is
proportional to the weight lost [3] and may even lead
to new weight gain in the long term [4–7]. Whilst
weight cycling per se is not associated with health
issues [8, 9], the weight gain has many health impli-
cations
[10].
There
are
many
mechanisms
underpinning eating behaviour that may contribute
to weight gain [11]. Some research has focussed on
the physiological mechanisms that cause long-term
weight gain in response to repeated dieting at-
tempts, such as changes in the production of regu-
latory hormones [5, 7], which may shift the body’s
response to signals from adipose tissue [12].
Whilst it is essential to understand the mechan-
isms, the search for treatments for obesity will in-
volve
achieving
a
holistic
understanding
of
regulatory systems. A descriptive model that mimics
the cycling phenomena [13] assumes that weight
gain stops at some maximum and weight loss stops
at some minimum. But this model does not eluci-
date why, in evolutionary terms, a system would be
designed as it is supposed. An evolutionary perspec-
tive can help to elucidate the causes of being over-
weight and obese [14]. Evolutionary arguments
centre around the usefulness of fat as a source of
energy under food shortage and the costs of carrying
stored fat [15]. Models of adaptive behaviour that
consider fat as a means to reduce the risk of starva-
tion have been highly successful at predicting energy
storage in animals [16–23]. These models typically
do not try to capture the complexities of physio-
logical and psychological mechanism that control
eating [11, 24, 25], but provide functional explan-
ations for the values of states that arise from such
mechanisms, such as the quantity of energy that is
stored [26]. Evolutionary approaches to understand-
ing obesity [27, 28] typically assume that humans will
have physiological and cognitive systems that
evolved in natural (ancestral) environments and
have not changed since then, and we know that
maladaptive behaviours of various kinds can emerge
from strategies that are adaptive in natural envir-
onments [29]. Evidence suggests that energy use
in western environments is similar to that for
hunter-gatherers [30], suggesting that excessive
food consumption rather than sedentary lifestyles
causes obesity.
Humans appear to have sophisticated controls on
fat storage that act to maintain weight at some
target, but the variation in body weight within popu-
lations indicates that this target must differ between
individuals [31]. It has not been fully elucidated why
individuals might differ in this way. Existing data
show that whilst a significant proportion of the
variation in body mass index is attributable to
genetic factors [32], there are strong effects of
socioeconomic factors [33]. This indicates that
learning may play an important role in determining
the individuals’ targets. Here, we assess how weight
gain after dieting attempts could be an adaptive re-
sponse involving learning about the environment.
Our model provides proof of the concept that weight
gain may be a response to an environment to which
the evolved subconscious system for controlling en-
ergy storage is no longer adapted.
THE MODEL
We assume that humans have evolved in environ-
ments where the food supply fluctuates between
limited and abundant, but also that there are times,
years or seasons, where the proportion of time that
food is abundant is greater or lesser [30, 34, 35]. The
current level of food availability is therefore not suf-
ficient to infer the long-term food availability. It is a
ubiquitous feature of natural environments that
food availability varies over time and shows such
positive autocorrelation and our formulation cap-
tures this in the simplest possible way. We model
a hypothetical animal that uses energetic reserves to
meet all its needs and tries to learn about the long-
term food availability from observing the short-term
fluctuations. This animal is adapted to conditions
over evolutionary history in which the food supply
fluctuated. We are interested in the consequences if
dieting attempts are interpreted by the subcon-
scious brain as such fluctuations.
The animal and its environment
We model time as a sequence of discrete epochs in
which the animal makes a decision and its state vari-
ables may change from one epoch to the next. The
animal is characterized by four state variables [36].
The first is its level of energetic reserves x. There are
two external states: the current food condition C

 where food availability is higher in the rich condition
(C = R) than the poor condition (C = P), and the cur-
rent state of the world W which can be good (W = G)
or bad (W = B), which differ in the average durations
of rich and poor periods. The animal knows the cur-
rent conditions without error, but does not directly
know whether the world is good or bad. The final
state variable is the animal’s current estimated prob-
ability that the world is good (�). Note that we do not
assume that any animal has a perfect system for
calculating probabilities, but that evolution has se-
lected for a cognitive system that behaves as though
it tracks a probability. At the end of a decision epoch,
the world changes from its current state W to the
alternative state with probability yW. When the world
is in state W conditions change from the current
condition C to the alternative condition with prob-
ability �W,C. We fix these probabilities so that condi-
tions are predominantly rich in the good world and
often poor in the bad world, and that conditions
change much more frequently than the state of the
world (yW� �W,C). Examples of food availability
over time in good and bad worlds are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1. Each decision epoch the
probability that the world is currently good (�) is
updated using Bayes’ rule. Supplementary Fig. S2
illustrates how probabilities are updated for the
baseline parameter values.
The aspect of behaviour we are interested in is the
proportion of time the animal spends foraging per
decision epoch, which we call f. Increasing f increases
the probability of finding food. Poor and rich condi-
tions differ onlyinthemaximum probability offinding
food per decision epoch when foraging (�R and gP,
wheregR > gP);theanimalfinds foodduringunittime
with probability�Cf. Forcomputationalreasons, there
is some variance in the energy content of food items
(see Supplementary Appendix) and they contain on
average b units of energy.
In naturalenvironments, there are a variety ofcosts
of carrying fat reserves. In modelling fat regulation in
small birds, it is usual to assume that energy expend-
itureincreaseswiththeamount(andhenceweight) of
fat carried.Itisalsooften assumed that predationrisk
when foraging increases with increasing fat load be-
cause of decreasing maneuverability [37]. Regardless
of the exact cost, some cost needs to be assumed if
long-term adaptive fat levels are to be stable [38]. In
humans, it seems reasonable to assume that the rate
of energy expenditure during activity increases with
increasing fat load. This would then impose a cost
since increased expenditure requires increased time
finding food, resulting in less time that is available to
spend onother activities.Our model isbased onsuch
a cost. We assume that the animal’s rate of energy
expenditure m(x) increases with energy reserves x—
representing the energetic costs of carrying fat in
humans [39] and animals [40]—according to
mðxÞ ¼ m0 1 þ mx

where mx (>0) controls how the cost increases with
reserves, and m0 controls the magnitude of costs. For
the baseline parameter values (Table 1), this means
that an animal with maximum fat stores would use
energy at twice the rate of an animal with no fat. A
consequenceisthatthebenefitofbuildingupenergetic
reserves will diminish, so we never predict that stores
should be near the maximum. We set other parameter
values so that the expected net rate of energy gain at
f=1 in bad conditions is slightly positive; thus, there is
a risk of starving to death, but animals are expected to
survive sufficiently long that the model makes clear
predictions about the effects of other parameters.
We assume that there are two sources of mortality
[41]. If the energy reserves of the animal reach x = 0,
the animal dies of starvation. During each epoch,
there is also a probability � of death from external
sources that is independent of state and behaviour.
We assume that the time that the animal does not
spend foraging isinvested inincreasingits reproduct-
ive success, such as in courting potential mates. This
reproductive payoff is instantaneous and subject to
diminishing returns sothatforaging for a proportion f
of a single decision epoch increases the animal’s life-
time reproductive success by

. There is there-
fore a trade-off between immediate investment in
reproduction and increasing the future investment
by finding food to increase the expected lifespan. A
strategy specifies how the value of f depends on the
three state variables x, � and C (W is not directly
known). The optimal strategy f* maximizes the total
lifetime reproductive success of the animal. Under
this strategy, the proportion of time spent foraging
when the combination of state variables is (x, �,C) is
f*(x, �,C). We use standard methods of stochastic
dynamic programming [36] to find this strategy. See
Supplementary Appendix for full details.
Cost of being active
Thus far, we have assumed that the rate of energy
use is the same whether the individual is foraging
or not, but fitness-promoting activities may be

recover Equation (1). If all else were equal, the extra
costs of activity would decrease average energy ex-
penditure (because f � 1), and so average costs and
type of costs would be confounded in any compari-
son. To minimize the effect of average costs, we ad-
justed the value of m0. The approximate mean value

Assessment of behaviour
The dynamic programming procedure calculates the

strength of the urge to add to fat stores by
calculating the risk that would be tolerated to gain
the equivalent of two items of food. Specifically, we
calculate the extra mortality risk �0 at which the ani-
mal is indifferent between its current situation and
gaining 10 extra units of reserves at risk �0. This

 ‘glut’. Third, when conditions switch slowly between
poor and rich, referred to as ‘slow diet’. Fourth, when
conditions switch rapidly between poor and rich,
referred to a ‘quick diet’. Thus, we simulate different
dieting patterns. We are interested in the predicted
energy storage and the belief that the world is good
(�) under these four conditions.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the optimal strategy for the baseline
parameter values (Table 1). Generally, the optimal
foraging rate f* is higher in the bad world because
the animal must attempt to have greater insurance
against the risk of going without food and starving.
In both worlds, f* is greater at low reserves in poor
conditions than in rich conditions because it is cru-
cial to find food before starvation, whilst at high re-
serves f* is greater in rich conditions than in poor
conditions (even in the good world) because it is
worth trying to build up the insurance when food is
abundant (for more exploration of conditions see
[42]). The target level of reserves in rich conditions
is higher in the bad world than in the good world
because more insurance is needed as the period of
food shortage is likely to be longer.
Constant glut conditions lead to greater energy
reserves than under normal conditions, but the re-
sponse to periods of poor conditions leads to over-
compensation
when
conditions
become
rich
(Fig. 2a). This results in greater energy reserves after
dieting attempts than in constant glut conditions.
This occurs because the animal becomes convinced
that the world is bad (Fig. 2b) and that it must take
advantage of rich conditions whilst they last. If con-
ditions fluctuate quickly, reserves are lower in the
short term (Fig. 2a) but the animal becomes more
convinced the world is bad over the longer term
(Fig. 2b). The extra mortality risk that would be
tolerated to get two food items is plotted for as a
function of current reserves when following the slow
diet (Fig. 2c). Because the animal is convinced the
world is bad, it is willing to risk up to 2� greater than
in a constant glut when reserves become low.
However, this increase depends on the combination
of reserves being low and the belief that the world is
bad: lower values of �0 than for glut conditions are
predicted at low reserves and believing the world is
good (grey dashed line) and believing the world is
bad at high reserves (black dashed line).
The reasons for the weight gain after the period of
poor conditions can be understood by considering
the optimal strategy (Fig. 1). When the individual
has aperiod of poor conditions then switches to rich,
it ‘believes’ that the world is bad, so the gain in re-
serves is greater than it would have been if condi-
tions were always rich. Thus, the gain in weight after
repeated dieting comes about because an animal
with high reserves should forage more in rich condi-
tions especially when it believes that there is a strong
possibility that conditions will turn poor. The re-
serves stored under dieting approach an asymptote
over a longer period of time, whereas under constant
glut they drop down to that stored under normal
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3) because the in-
dividual becomes convinced the world is good so
there is no need to store much energy.
The mean reserves stored in the good world in-
creases with the duration of bad periods and with the
duration of periods in the bad world (Fig. 3a), due to
the insurance effect. To illustrate this effect, we pre-
sent the optimal strategy in Supplementary Fig. S4
for 9 of the 21 parameter value combinations used to
make Fig. 3. Reserves in a glut are greater relative to
under normal conditions when poor periods in the
good world are longer (Fig. 3b). Hence, the greatest

intermediate values of � (not shown). Dotted lines indicate the
value of f necessary to maintain a constant level of reserves
long-term in rich (black) and poor (grey) conditions. Hence,
where the strategy lines of the same shade intersect the dotted

in rich conditions is higher in the bad world than the good
world

 gain after dieting attempts, relative to glut condi-
tions, is when poor conditions are short in the good
world (Fig. 3c) because this causes a greater differ-
ence in the target level of reserves in rich conditions
between the bad and good world (cf. Supplementary
Fig. S4b and h). After 256 decision epochs, lower
reserves are stored if dieting fluctuations are quicker
(cf. Fig. 3c, 1) for most situations and exceed reserve
level expected in a glut only if poor periods are very
short in the good world.
One explanation for difficulty in losing weight is
that lighter bodies require less energy so food con-
sumption needs to progressively reduce [7]. In Fig. 4,
we show the effect of changing the magnitude of the
dependence of energy expenditure on the level of
reserves. In all conditions more fat is stored in con-
stant glut compared than under normal conditions.
Although larger values of mx than unity tend to either
decrease (g/n) or increase (s/g, q/g) relative reserve
levels, the overall pattern is unchanged. However,
when mx is zero—meaning that energy use does
not increase with energy storage—we do not predict
dieting to cause weight gain (s/g < 1 and q/g < 1),
suggesting that the energetic cost of fat storage is
essential to the increase in body weight due to
weight cycling.
The optimal strategy is influenced by changing the
various costs (mx, mf, mx,f, see Supplementary Fig.
S5). The effect of dieting is considerably weaker
when mx,f>0 because the extra cost of activity
means that the animal gains more reserves in rich
conditions. However, the effect is stronger in the
good world, and so results in less of a difference
between glut and dieting conditions. mf has very
small effects on predicted energy storage (cf.
Fig. 4, left and right panels) because the individual
can decrease costs in poor conditions by being in-
active, which reduces the advantage to storing fat,
and this cancels out the selective pressure to store
more fat in response to increased costs. There is
discrepancy between the level of reserves that indi-
viduals should try to store (‘target’) and the reserves
that can be built up (‘realized’), which differ due to

conditions. (a) Mean energy reserves x over time when condi-

 stochasticity (Supplementary Fig. S6), and the dif-
ference
depends
on
the
types
of
costs
(Supplementary Fig. S6e and f). Note that in all
cases, the discrepancy in dieting conditions is much
smaller than in glut conditions. Based on the dis-
crepancy between the target and the realized state,
the urge to eat strongest when the rate of energy use
is constant (0, 0 lines in Fig. 4) or increases with
reserves and this is at a greater rate when foraging
(1,1). The urge to eat will be weakest when the rate of
energy use only depends on reserves, but strongly
(2,0). Again, the effect of an overall cost of foraging
(mf) is small and constant across other costs (cf.
Supplementary Fig. S6e and f).
DISCUSSION
Weight cycling is common in people that are at-
tempting to lose weight, but many people gain
weight in the long term. The functional reasons that
our energy storage systems might respond in this
way to dieting attempts has not been elucidated. We
have used a simple generic model of feeding to dem-
onstrate how a reserve-control system following an
ecological rational strategy [43] could cause weight
gain over the long-term if periods of food shortage
are frequent even if they are associated with short-
term weight loss. Our work therefore proposes a po-
tential cause of the association between weight
cycling and weight gain [5, 44, 45]: that dieting at-
tempts cause weight gain via providing (misleading)
information about the environment to the subcon-
scious systems that control body mass. That is, even
in the ‘constant glut’ [10] conditions in the de-
veloped world where food is always abundant, the
subconscious decision-making systems that under-
pin our behaviour may interpret dieting attempts as
indicative of an environment with common food
shortages, and this triggers the (previously) appro-
priate behavioural responses.
Our model predicts that energy reserves should
respond to repeated attempts to diet by weight
cycling and becoming greater from one cycle to the
next. The more reliable food was when the world was
good, the greater the relative fat storage during re-
peated dieting attempts is predicted to be because
these dieting attempts cue that the world is more
likely to be bad. Thus, the very conditions that cause
weight gain initially—a glut of food—causes further
weight gain once cyclical dieting begins. There is
evidence that among weight cycling, people those
who switch between dieting and binge-eating more

 frequently gain more weight [45]. By contrast, we
found that quick oscillations tended to lead to less
weight gain for the period we studied, but over the
longer term, the duration of dieting periods has little
effect on the average energy storage (Supplementary
Fig. S3). We concentrate on outcomes after a rela-
tively short period of dieting (256 time steps, Figs 2
and 3), partly because people not only do not diet
forever but also energy storage tends to level off
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We note that our model
predicts that fat storage under constant glut condi-
tions that persist for a long time will actually not be
substantially greater than under normal conditions
(Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that the abun-
dance of energy-rich food is not a complete explan-
ation for the obesity epidemic. Fat storage over a
long period of dieting attempts will be greater than
under constant glut conditions, implying a critical
role of informational constraints and learning.
Our results suggest that the magnitude of the
weight gain between diets will depend on the cost
of the non-foraging activity. Our rescaling (by adjust-
ing m0) means that we compare predictions depend-
ing on the relative cost of the other activity. When mf
and mx,f are small foraging is much more costly than
other activities; when unity other activities are equally
costly. For some species and situations, the activities
that enhance reproduction may be energetically inex-
pensive, such as grooming in primates. In other cases,
activities essential to reproduction may be equally as
energeticasforaging,suchasmaintainingaterritory.It
is difficult to know what best applies to humans.
However, it may be possible to quantify the relative
costs of foraging across species, which would offer
possibilities for testing our predictions. Foraging may
be relatively more costly than non-foraging in a small
bird(i.e.smallmf)comparedtoarodent(i.e.largemf).If
we could expose laboratory birds (e.g. zebra finch) and
rodents (e.g. mice) to a yo-yo diet regime, we would
predict that the rodent would gain more weight. A very
large-scaleprojectcouldtrytoestimateourcostparam-
eters (mx, mf, mx,f) for several populations or closely
related species in order to assess the responses to
‘dieting’ and then measure the target and/or realized
level of reserves (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Lowe [3] argues that yo-yo dieting does not cause
weight gain but is merely a correlate of the potential
for weight gain, which may arise if people who know
they often overeat take steps to avoid weight gain.
This argument is based on the assumption that
causation is one way, but our perspective shows that
causation may be two way between food restriction
and overeating, leading to a spiral of dieting and
weight gain. We suggest that the interpretation of
data is hampered by a lack of robust theory, and
hope that our work may cause a re-evaluation of ob-
servations of weight cycling. For instance, Lowe [3]
suggests that weight regain is caused not by dieting
but by increased binge eating and increased reward
value of food. From our perspective, these are prox-
imate mechanisms that implement the behavioural
strategy that we have identified; thus both explan-
ations can be true.
Not all individuals acquire excess weight after
dieting [46]. Our results suggest that variation
among individuals could occur if people have differ-
ent subconscious expectations of the pattern of food
availability (Fig. 3c and d). For instance, weight
cycling does not promote extra weight gain if the
system ‘expects’ conditions to change very slowly
or very rapidly when the world is bad. If such ‘expect-
ations’ were determined by natural selection in dif-
ferent environments and encoded in genes, then this
effect may underlie effects of ethnicity on the risk of
obesity [33, 47]. On the other hand, this ‘expectation’
may be learnt during a lifetime, which may underlie
the effects of age on the apparent heritability of obes-
ity [32]. Furthermore, this provides a possibility for
testing our predictions: if young mice occasionally
experience periods where food is restricted but is
available with various rates of fluctuations (e.g. every
other hour; every other day) then when older they
should show different responses to intermediate
frequencies of food restriction. Specifically, those
who were exposed to an intermediate rate of fluctu-
ations may gain the most weight (peaks in Fig. 4),
and those used to constant glut conditions would
gain more weight relative to control individuals than
those subject to occasional food shortage when
young (cf. different lines in Figs. 3 and 4).
Experiments that use various protocols of food
restrictions could be used to assess the predictions
around foraging intensity (Fig. 1; Supplementary
Fig. S5), provided there was an appropriate continu-
ous measure of the behaviour of subjects. Since our
predictions are state dependent, repeated measures
of the same individuals after their fat stores have
been manipulated through food restriction or gluts
would provide a powerful test. For instance, the
crossover points in the strategies mean that at low
reserves, we predict higher intensity foraging when
food is scarce (e.g. low fixed ratio schedule) than
abundant, and the converse when at high reserves.

 manipulate the subjects’ beliefs about not only cur-
rent conditions but also the ‘’world’: the long-term
conditions. Under some parameter combinations
(e.g. Supplementary Fig. S4b), we predict that there
will be a crossover in foraging intensity when food is
currently abundant: at low reserves subjects should
show lower intensity foraging if the world is bad but
the converse when at high reserves.
The additional risk of mortality that would be
incurred to obtain food can be seen as a surrogate
for the strength of motivation to eat. Our results on
this risk explain why people’s motivation systems
strongly push them to eat high calorie food, and
why this urge will be especially strong during a diet
[48]. Interestingly, we predict that this urge will not
gradually diminish over dieting attempts (although
calories consumed will be lower) despite weight
being gained, because the system becomes more
and more convinced the world is bad. People who at-
tempt to diet for a very long time will not continue to
gain weight but reach an asymptote (Supplementary
Fig. S3), seemingly much higher than those who
never diet (constant glut). Real people are much
more complex than our model, but it seems likely
that people who have been dieting for a long time
may benefit from trying to maintain their body
weight for some time rather than reduce calorie in-
take, to ‘convince’ their regulatory systems that the
food supply is reliable.
Our cognitive systems will have evolved to reflect
the fact that current conditions are informative of
future conditions (i.e. the world is temporally
positively autocorrelated) [49]. This is a contrast ef-
fect [50], a seemingly irrational behavioural phenom-
enon seen in many animals [51–53], including
humans [54] which can arise due to uncertainty
about the long-term state of the world [55], and could
underlie several other psychological phenomena
[29]. Current conditions in the developed world are
constant glut [10], but any uncertainty could make
people gain further weight because learning about
food availability from dieting attempts alters expect-
ations about food availability in the future. That op-
timal behaviour depends on future expectations is
well established [41], but weight gain between diets
is another possible example of behaviour being af-
fected by past experience in seemingly irrational
ways [56].
We cannot capture all the complexities of weight
cycling in a simple model, so we assume that there
are two levels of food availability and study a single
cycle, finding when the level of fat should be greater
at the end of the cycle than it would otherwise have
been. In reality, people are learning over the long
term. However, we find that the weight gain slows
as more fat is stored (Supplementary Fig. S3), which
is consistent with the observation that obese people
do not gain further weight as a result of dieting [7], so
we expect that a more long-term model would not
lead to further insights. Our model only captures the
function of fat storage, and we have not attempted to
specify the psychological or physiological mechan-
isms that bring it about; one possible mechanism is
an alteration of the sensitivity of anabolic responses
to adiposity signals [12].
Further developments of our model could include
decision-making about how much lean mass should
be stored and when protein might be catabolized for
energy, as we have shown this flexibility may affect
decisions about fat storage [57, 58]. However, even
our simple model demonstrates the principle that
understanding weight gain during yo-yo dieting does
not require recourse to explanations based around
the feeding control system malfunctioning [1, 11] or
being overwhelmed by modern food stimuli [10, 11].
The feeding system could be functioning perfectly,
but uncertainty about the food supply triggers the
adaptive response to gain weight.
