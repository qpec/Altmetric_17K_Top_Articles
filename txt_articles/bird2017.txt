What is already known about this topic? Two randomized controlled trials have used differing methods to demonstrate
desensitization after peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT).
What does this article add to our knowledge? This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 peanut OITstudy
with entry and exit double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges using a current good manufacturing practice (cGMP)
manufactured characterized biologic drug product demonstrating clinical and immunomodulatory changes indicating
desensitization.
How does this study impact current management guidelines? This study provides proof-of-concept demonstrating the
effectiveness of a standardized OIT product and protocol in a multicenter trial. Three large phase 3 trials of AR101 are
ongoing and will provide high-quality evidence likely to influence practice.
BACKGROUND: Peanut oral immunotherapy, using a variety
of approaches, has been previously shown to induce
desensitization in peanut-allergic subjects, but no products have
been approved for clinical use by regulatory agencies.
OBJECTIVE: We performed the first phase 2 multicentered
study to assess the safety and efficacy of AR101, a novel oral
biologic drug product.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial was conducted at 8 US centers. Eligible subjects were 4 to
26 years old, sensitized to peanut, and had dose-limiting
symptoms to £143 mg of peanut protein in a screening double-
blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Subjects
were randomized 1:1 to daily AR101 or placebo and gradually
up-dosed from 0.5 to 300 mg/day. The primary endpoint was

the proportion of subjects in each arm able to tolerate ‡443
mg (cumulative peanut protein) at exit DBPCFC with no or

RESULTS: Fifty-five subjects (29 AR101, 26 placebo) were
enrolled. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 23 of 29 (79%) and
18 of 29 (62%) AR101 subjects tolerated ‡443 mg and 1043 mg
at exit DBPCFC, respectively, versus 5 of 26 (19%) and 0 of 26
(0%) placebo subjects (both P < .0001). Compared with placebo,
AR101 significantly reduced symptom severity during exit
DBPCFCs and modulated peanut-specific cellular and humoral
immune responses. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the
most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in both
groups, with 6 AR101 subjects (21%) withdrawing, 4 of those
due primarily to recurrent GI AEs.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, AR101 demonstrated an
acceptable safety profile and demonstrated clinical activity as a
potential immunomodulatory treatment option in peanut-
allergic children over the age of 4, adolescents, and young
adults.

Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition that
affects approximately 5% to 10% of people throughout the
developed world,1-4 but as yet no specific treatment has been
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) or European Medicines Agency. The current standard of
care is limited to diagnosis, avoidance of the allergenic food, and
treatment of allergic reactions from accidental ingestion with
autoinjectable epinephrine.5-7
Peanut is among the most prevalent of the food allergies,
affecting approximately 1 in 70 children and 1 in 160 adults in
the United States.8 Peanut allergy typically begins in early
childhood, but unlike many food allergies, it persists into adult-
hood in 80% of affected individuals.9-11 Reactions to peanut can
be triggered by milligram exposures,12 are frequently severe, and
account for most food allergy-related deaths.13 Because peanut
can be frequently encountered in a wide variety of foods, as many
as 50% of peanut-allergic individuals were found to have had an
accidental ingestion over a 2-year period.14,15 There remains a
clear unmet need for a treatment to help protect peanut-allergic
individuals in case of accidental exposure.
Over the past decade, numerous reports on oral immuno-
therapy (OIT) for IgE-mediated allergies to foods have been
published.16-23 OIT involves exposing allergic individuals to
gradually escalating doses of an allergen to render effector cells
less reactive, thereby inducing desensitization. Goals for OIT-
induced desensitization include reduced reactivity to an extent
that can provide reliable protection against a potentially severe or
life-threatening reaction after an accidental exposure.
The first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the ef-
ficacy of OIT for peanut allergy was reported in 2011 by a US
group,16 and a second followed in the UK in 201417; however,
the former did not perform food challenges at entry and the
latter did not include a placebo control group. Although these
and other OIT studies18-23 have shown OIT to be a promising
treatment approach in peanut allergy, it has not yet been rec-
ommended for routine clinical practice.5,6 Because most OIT
studies have been small and limited by various flaws that limit

BIRD ET AL
 the impact of their findings, a state of clinical equipoise still
exists regarding the safety and efficacy of OIT, and it currently
remains experimental.24 In addition to these safety and efficacy
concerns, a major barrier to the general acceptance of OIT for
the treatment of peanut allergy is the absence of a product
approved for this purpose by regulatory agencies.25-27 The
regulatory path requires a product to be thoroughly character-
ized, manufactured reproducibly to well-defined standards,
used according to clinically tested procedures, and shown to
have a favorable risk-benefit profile; studies conducted in
accordance with these requirements will help to generate high-
quality data that are now critically needed in large numbers of
participants. Thus, adequately powered, multicenter, random-
ized controlled phase 2 and 3 trials using uniform methods and
standardized products will provide key evidence for the scien-
tific community, regulators, patients, caregivers, payers, and
other stakeholders to further evaluate the safety and effective-
ness of food immunotherapy products. The ARC001 study, the
first multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2
peanut OIT trial to include double-blind, placebo-controlled
food challenges (DBPCFCs) at both screening and exit, was
undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of AR101, a novel
oral biologic drug product containing a characterized peanut
protein profile, in reducing clinical reactivity to peanut in
peanut-allergic children and young adults.
METHODS
Study
participant
selection,
screening,
and
randomization
The
trial
was
appropriately
registered
(ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT01987817) and conducted in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethics committees
at each investigative site. Eligible subjects were aged 4 to 26 years
with a clinical history of peanut allergy and either serum peanut-
specific IgE (ps-IgE) �0.35 kUA/L or peanut skin prick test (SPT)
wheal diameter �3 mm larger than the negative control within the
preceding 12 months, or both. Subjects were excluded for a history
of frequent or repeated, severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis,
eosinophilic gastrointestinal (GI) disease, or severe or uncontrolled
asthma (see full inclusion/exclusion criteria in Table E1, available in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
Eligible participants experienced dose-limiting allergic symptoms
at or before reaching the 100 mg single dose (143 mg cumulative) of
peanut protein during a screening DBPCFC, confirming that they
could tolerate no more than 43 mg of cumulative peanut protein at
study entry. The screening DBPCFC, performed in accordance with
the PRACTALL consensus report,28 consisted of a peanut (flour)
challenge and a placebo (oat flour) challenge done on separate days
and assigned in random order. Eligible subjects were randomized in
a 1:1 ratio to either AR101 or placebo, according to a central
randomization schedule of randomly permuted blocks that was
prepared by an independent unblinded statistician and accessed by
the investigational sites via an automated system.
Study oversight
Study protocol and consent forms were approved by the investi-
gational sites’ institutional review boards. The study was conducted
under an FDA-reviewed investigational new drug application. Written
informed consent was obtained from adult patients and from the
parent/guardian for minor subjects (ie, <18 years). Written assent was
obtained from children according to local standards. An independent
data
monitoring
committee
assessed
safety
data
periodically
throughout the trial. Investigative sites ensured that all subjects had
an in-date epinephrine autoinjector and were trained in its use.
Study products (AR101 and placebo)
The active ingredient in AR101 consists of defatted lightly roasted
peanut flour characterized by a number of tests including high-
performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay, and assay for protein content. This characterization in-
cludes a determination of the relative potency of the Ara h 1, Ara h
2, and Ara h 6 antigens and content uniformity for product release.
Additional protein determinations, which include these antigens as
well as Ara h 3 and Ara h 8, have been conducted to demonstrate
that they are consistently present in the lot of peanut material used.
The defatting process supports storage conditions, enables a more
robust pharmaceutical processing, and may remove some of the
peanut flavor.
AR101,
a
powder,
was
administered
in
graduated
doses
(Figure E1, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-
inpractice.org) from capsules containing 0.5, 1, 10, 20, or 100 mg of
peanut protein, formulated with bulking and flow agents. Matching
placebo capsules contained oat flour and excipients. Study product
was consumed after opening the capsules and mixing its content into
an age-appropriate, nonallergenic, vehicle food (eg, applesauce,
pudding). Participants otherwise abstained from peanut exposure.
Study endpoints and assessments
The primary endpoint of ARC001 was the response rate, defined
as the proportion of subjects who were able to successfully consume
a single dose of �300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of peanut protein
with no dose-limiting symptoms, as defined by PRACTALL
guidelines,28 at exit DBPCFC. The exit DBPCFC tested doses of 3,
10, 30, 100, 300, and 600 mg given consecutively, as tolerated, 20
to 30 minutes apart without repeating a dose. There were 2 key
secondary endpoints, the maximum dose achieved with no or
minimal symptoms (ie, symptoms that did not prohibit escalation to
the next dose as defined by PRACTALL guidelines) at exit
DBPCFC, and the change in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
from screening to exit DBCPFC.28 The probability estimates for
MTD were based on the discrete hazards model with terms for
treatment and MTD at baseline in the log10 scale. Following
Chinchilli, the extreme value hazard function (the discrete-time
analog of the Cox proportional hazards function) was used and the
model fit with logistic regression using the complementary log-log
link function.28 Probability estimates were adjusted for the MTD
at baseline and calculated at the median of the MTD at baseline. For
subjects who did not undergo exit DBPCFC, values for the MTD at
the exit challenge were imputed using the MTD of peanut protein
tolerated in their screening DBPCFC. Other secondary endpoints
included change from baseline in ps-IgE and peanut-specific IgG4
(ps-IgG4) serum levels (Immulite, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany), and in peanut SPT wheal diameter. Wheal size was
calculated as the average of the longest diameter and the midpoint
perpendicular diameter using a standard, 1:20 dilution of peanut
extract. Wilcoxon sign-rank was used to calculate P values for
changes from baseline, and Wilcoxon rank-sum was used to calculate
P values for AR101 compared with the placebo group.
The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of the response
rate between treatment groups (AR101 vs placebo) in the intent-to-
treat (ITT) population of all subjects randomized and dosed with
study product, assessed by 2-sided Fisher’s exact test. Some results

 are also presented on the completer population, that is, subjects who
underwent exit DBPCFC. The key secondary endpoints were each
tested in the ITT population at the 0.05 level, in hierarchical order,
provided the preceding test was significant. Assessment of the safety
of peanut OIT was based on comparison of adverse event (AE) rates
between the AR101 and placebo groups.
Oral immunotherapy dosing regimen
In brief, study product dosing began with incremental escalation
from 0.5 to a maximum of 6 mg in a single day, with confirmation
of the ability to tolerate 3 or 6 mg over the next 1 to 2 days (Initial
Escalation phase), followed by biweekly up-dosing to a final dose of
300 mg/day (Up-dosing phase) over 20 to 34 weeks (Figure E1).
The protocol permitted adjustments to the biweekly up-dosing
schedule as needed, for example, temporary dose reduction if a
dose level was not tolerated. Severity of dose-related allergic symp-
toms was determined per investigator judgment, using the defini-
tions in the PRACTALL report on DBPCFC as a general guide.28
Subjects were cautioned against activities likely to increase reac-
tivity (eg, exercising or taking hot showers or baths within 4 hours
after dosing). Temporary dose reductions were allowed while sub-
jects were suffering from symptoms of an upper respiratory infection
or influenza, or during menses. Investigators were allowed to hold
doses per their discretion for any reported AE. For convenience, a
reference for assessing symptom severity, consistent with both the
PRACTALL guidelines and the Consortium of Food Allergy
Research’s specific grading system for allergic reactions, was included
in the protocol (Table E2, available in this article’s Online Re-
pository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).29 Subjects unable to reach the
300 mg/day dose by study week 34 were considered escalation
failures. Subjects who tolerated 300 mg/day for 2 consecutive weeks
were eligible for Exit DBPCFC (completer population).
Sample size
A sample size of 50 subjects randomized equally to 2 arms was
calculated to provide at least 80% power to detect a treatment group
difference of approximately 41% for the primary efficacy analysis.
Based on the available literature, a 20% withdrawal rate and 25%
placebo-response rate among completers were assumed. Subjects
already in the screening process when the 50th subject was ran-
domized were allowed to proceed and be randomized if all entry
criteria were met.
RESULTS
Study participants
Of 67 subjects screened, 11 were ineligible for enrollment: 5
withdrew consent, 1 reacted to placebo in the screening
DBPCFC, 1 experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) from the
DBPCFC, and 4 tolerated the top DBPCFC dose of 143 mg of
peanut protein (Figure 1). The remaining 56 subjects had dose-
limiting symptoms at or before a cumulative dose of 143 mg of
peanut protein, and were randomized to either AR101 or pla-
cebo. One subject, randomized to placebo, withdrew consent
before receiving any study product, yielding 55 subjects in the
ITT population, 29 in the AR101 arm, and 26 in the placebo
arm. During the screening DBPCFC, 9 (16%), 24 (44%), and
22 (40%) of the subjects in the ITT population tolerated the 3,
13, and 43 mg nominal dose level of cumulative peanut protein,
respectively. Demographic data and baseline characteristics are
presented in Table I.
Efficacy of AR101 versus placebo
Twenty-three AR101 subjects (79%) completed the study in a
median of 22 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 21-26) and mean
of 24 weeks (standard deviation [SD] 3.75), and 26 placebo
subjects (100%) completed the study in a median of 22 weeks
(IQR 21-24) and mean of 22 weeks (SD 2.0). No subjects
discontinued the study during the Initial Escalation phase.
The 6 AR101 subjects who discontinued treatment before the
exit DBPCFC were considered nonresponders. Of the 26 pla-
cebo subjects who completed the study, 5 tolerated 443 mg
cumulative of peanut protein at exit DBPCFC. Hence, in the
ITT population, 23 of 29 AR101 subjects (79%) were treatment
responders, as compared with 5 of 26 placebo subjects (19%)

BIRD ET AL
 (P < .0001) (Figure 2, A). In the completer population
(Figure 2, B), 23 of 23 AR101 subjects (100%) were treatment
responders, as compared with 5 of 26 placebo subjects (19%)
(P < .0001). The highest possible single dose of peanut protein
administered during the exit DBPCFC was 600 mg, for a cu-
mulative total of 1043 mg. Eighteen AR101 subjects (62% in the
ITT population and 78% in the completer population) were able
to successfully consume this amount of peanut protein,
compared with none in the placebo group (P < .0001).
For the key secondary endpoint of the maximum dose ach-
ieved with no or mild symptoms at exit DBPCFC, the proba-
bility of tolerating each challenge dose or higher was increased
with AR101 treatment as compared with placebo in the ITT
population (Figure 3; discrete hazards model adjusted for base-
line MTD). The probability of tolerating 443 mg cumulative of
peanut protein or higher was 0.82 for AR101 and 0.14 for
placebo, and the probability of tolerating 1043 mg cumulative of
peanut protein or higher was 0.59 for AR101 and 0.01 for
placebo. The corresponding hazard ratio of the probability of
reacting to a challenge dose in AR101 subjects to placebo
subjects, given no reaction to a lower dose, was 0.10 (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.04, 0.25; P < .0001), indicating that
the risk of failing the exit DBPCFC for AR101 subjects was
one-tenth that of placebo subjects. For the key secondary
endpoint of change from baseline in MTD, a larger increase in
MTD was observed for subjects assigned to AR101 versus pla-
cebo (Table E3, available in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jaci-inpractice.org). Based on geometric mean estimates of
the ratio of Exit DBPCFC MTD to baseline, there was a 18.38-
fold increase for AR101 as compared with a 2.14-fold increase
for placebo in the ITT population, which increases to 39.28-fold
versus 2.14-fold in the completer population (both P < .0001
for AR101 vs placebo).
The severity of allergic symptoms occurring at each dose in the
exit DBPCFC was also assessed, yielding a profile of symptom
severity as a function of challenge dose (Figure 4). The per-
centage of subjects experiencing one or more allergic symptoms
graded as mild, moderate, or severe was lower in the AR101 than
in the placebo group at every dose of peanut protein. Of the 23
AR101 subjects passing the exit DBPCFC at 443 mg cumulative
of peanut protein, 20 (87%) had no symptoms and 3 (13%) had
only mild symptoms (Figure 4, B). No AR101 subjects experi-
enced severe symptoms during the exit DBPCFC, and moderate
symptoms were not encountered until the highest dose (1043 mg
cumulative dose) (Figure 4, B and D). By contrast, 10 placebo
subjects (38%) experienced severe symptoms at some point in
the DBPCFC, 2 (9%) occurring at the 43 mg cumulative dose;
and at least 1 placebo subject experienced moderate or severe
symptoms at each dose (Figure 4, A and C). At the 1043 mg
cumulative challenge dose, 61% of AR101 and no placebo
subjects were symptom free (Figure 4, A and B).
We performed an exploratory analysis of epinephrine as a
rescue medication during DBPCFC as an additional indicator of
severity of allergic reaction. Of the 63 subjects who underwent
screening DBPCFC, 9 (14%) received a single injection of
epinephrine: 4 were randomized to AR101, 4 to placebo, and 1
was not enrolled. At exit DBPCFC, 11 of 26 placebo subjects
(42%) were administered epinephrine, 3 of whom required 2
injections, whereas 2 of 23 AR101 subjects (9%) received a
single injection of epinephrine, both at the final 600 mg chal-
lenge dose. Two placebo subjects reacted at the 30 mg dose level
(1 requiring 2 doses of epinephrine); one reacted at the 100 mg
dose level and four each at the 300 (2 requiring 2 doses of
epinephrine) and 600 mg levels.
Effect of AR101 on immunologic responses to
peanut
The mean change in maximal peanut SPT wheal diameter
from
screening
to
study
exit
was
�7.0
mm
(95%
CI: �9.9, �4.1) in the AR101 and �1.8 mm (95% CI: �4.8,
1.1) in the placebo group (P ¼ .0132; Figure 5, A). The geo-
metric mean serum ps-IgG4 level increased from 0.734 to 3.609
mcg/mL in the AR101 group, with a relative change from
baseline of 5.068 (95% CI: 3.640, 7.055), compared with levels
of 0.510 and 0.540 mcg/mL and a relative increase of 1.066
(95% CI: 0.905, 1.255) in the placebo group (P < .0001;
Figure 5, B). Similarly, small increases in ps-IgE from screening
to exit were noted in both groups and the difference was not
statistically significant. The observed 4-fold decrease in the serum
ps-IgE/IgG4 in the AR101 relative to the placebo resulted
entirely from the AR101 group’s rise in ps-IgG4 (Figure 5, C).

Twenty-eight of 29 AR101 subjects (96.6%) and 22 of 26
placebo subjects (84.6%) experienced at least 1 AE during the
course of treatment. In total, there were 413 treatment-emergent
AEs in the AR101 group (a rate of 35.9 TEAEs per year of
exposure), and 135 TEAEs in the placebo group (12.1 TEAEs/
year). AEs assessed as being (possibly, probably, or definitely)
related to study product occurred in 27 AR101 subjects (93%) and
12 placebo subjects (46%) (Table E4, available in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). In the AR101
group, 96% of treatment-related AEs were graded as mild and 4%
as moderate, with moderate AEs including urticaria, pruritus,
vomiting, abdominal pain, gastritis, and anaphylaxis. In addition, 1
subject experienced wheezing after accidentally inhaling some of
the study product during the preparation of a dose. In the placebo
group, 94% were graded as mild and 6% as moderate. Moderate
AEs in this group included urticaria, angioedema, nausea, and
abdominal pain. No AEs in either group were graded as severe.
The most common treatment-related AEs comprised GI
symptoms in both the AR101 (66%) and placebo (27%) groups
(Table E5, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). GI symptoms related to AR101 ranged in
severity from mild oral pruritus to moderate vomiting and/or
abdominal pain, with > 95% of these symptoms being graded
mild in severity. Six AR101 subjects (21%), all of whom had
baseline ps-IgE levels of >100 kUA/L, withdrew from treatment
prematurely (Table E6, available in this article’s Online Re-
pository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Four of these cases were
deemed by the site investigator to be due directly to recurrent GI
AEs. In 2 additional subjects, GI and other allergic symptoms, as
well as anxiety and medication compliance, contributed to the
family’s and investigator’s decision, respectively, to withdraw the
subject. In 5 of these 6 cases, onset of GI symptoms occurred
early in the course of OIT, within the first month, at the 3 to 12
mg dose levels. In the sixth, symptoms of irritability began on
study day 3, at the 6 mg level, but vomiting did not occur until
study day 45, at the 40 mg level. In one case, endoscopic biopsy
was performed and revealed the presence of eosinophilic esoph-
agitis. In all cases, GI symptoms resolved within 3 weeks of
discontinuing OIT. There was one treatment-related SAE of
moderate severity anaphylaxis that occurred in a subject playing
basketball 16 hours after dose, which was treated with
epinephrine at home and resolved under observation in the
emergency department. Because the subject had been experi-
encing mild but recurrent GI symptoms, the SAE was judged by
the investigator to be possibly related to study product.
DISCUSSION
Previous studies using commercial peanut products have
suggested that OIT is a suitable approach to treating peanut
allergy.16-23 However, limitations of former studies included the
lack of a placebo arm, the lack of performing an entry or exit
gold-standard DBPCFC to determine the peanut sensitivity of
the subject before or after OIT, or both. This early-stage work
has led to the first clinical trial of AR101, an oral biologic drug
product that is manufactured to current good manufacturing
practice (cGMP) specifications and developed for this purpose.
AR101 is encapsulated in a range of doses and release tested for
consistent major allergen content and freedom from microbial

 contamination and other allergens. We report here the results
from the build-up and early maintenance phases of the first
peanut OIT trial of AR101, one that included both a random-
ized placebo control group and entry and exit DBPCFCs.
In this phase 2 trial, AR101 met its primary endpoint,
demonstrating desensitization to a level of peanut protein that
exceeds the amount of peanut typically triggering a reaction with
accidental ingestion. Specifically, during the exit DBPCFC, 79%
of the ITT population tolerated a single dose of 300 mg (443 mg
cumulative) of peanut protein with no or mild symptoms in the
AR101 group, compared with 19% in the placebo group.
Additionally, all AR101 subjects who completed the protocol
tolerated 443 mg, the cumulative equivalent of approximately
one and a half peanuts (J. Baumert and S. Taylor, Food Allergy
Research and Resource Program, personal communication,
September 23, 2016), and 78% tolerated a 600 mg single highest
dose (1043 mg total), the cumulative equivalent of approxi-
mately 4 peanuts, with no or mild symptoms. Comparing the
MTD of peanut protein attained at the exit DBPCFC with the
screening DBPCFC, AR101 induced an 18-fold increase in the
amount of peanut protein tolerated. In addition, AR101 modi-
fied peanut-specific immune responses by suppressing SPT
reactivity and enhancing IgG4 production, effects consistent
with those previously reported in other studies. Overall, AR101’s
safety profile was consistent with other OIT studies, and the
dose-related AEs in the 21% unable to tolerate AR101 quickly
reversed on discontinuation.
The present study demonstrated that 22 weeks of AR101
treatment significantly raised the threshold at which allergic re-
actions to peanut were elicited, compared with placebo. The
maximum severity of symptoms during exit DBPCFC in the
AR101 group was also decreased relative to the placebo group,
across the range of challenge doses tested. These data suggest, but
do not prove, that AR101 could potentially reduce the severity of
allergic reactions. The decreased use of epinephrine during exit
DBPCFC in the AR101 relative to the placebo group further
supports this idea. However, although DBPCFCs are the
accepted gold-standard experimental model of food allergen
exposure, they occur under tightly controlled conditions with
graduated dosing and should not be interpreted to replicate
accidental exposures. Whether relevant clinical protection from
accidents can be inferred from an absolute amount of threshold
reactivity, and/or the post-treatment change, is an unsettled
subject that will likely require very large and meticulously per-
formed future “real-world” surveillance studies because our un-
derstanding of thresholds over time is limited, tolerated

decreases as the challenge dose level increases. This is because subjects who fail to tolerate a given challenge dose with no or only mild
symptoms were prohibited from advancing to the next challenge dose level. Panels (C) and (D) show the results for all placebo and AR101

representation, the grade of the most severe symptom elicited at any administered challenge dose was used as the imputation value for
any subsequent dose that was either not given or resulted in a less severe symptom score. As values for subjects no longer eligible to
progress in the DBPCFC were imputed, the number of subjects at each challenge dose level remains constant. DBPCFC, Double-blind,

 exposures may be clinically silent, and life-threatening events are
rare. Nonetheless, experimentally observed desensitization is
important because in most cases of accidental ingestion, symp-
toms are elicited before the allergic individual is aware of allergen
ingestion.30 In addition, low eliciting dose thresholds (ie, around
100 mg, or less than half of a peanut) are common in peanut-
allergic patients12 and often reported in real life.15,31 However,
accidental ingestions of larger amounts (ie, in a fully ingested
contaminated meal) can and do occur,31 and may represent a
higher risk for mortality.32 In addition, evidence from observa-
tional and interventional studies suggests that an individual’s
eliciting threshold can vary over time because of the presence of
augmenting cofactors that are often unavoidable (eg, fever,
menses), and others that are poorly understood.33-37 Thus an
ideal form of therapy for peanut allergy would provide a sub-
stantial margin of efficacy, similar to the effect size demonstrated
here and in previous academic trials of peanut OIT.16-19,23
Interestingly, we observed a 19% desensitization response rate
in the placebo group, which is consistent with natural variation
in threshold levels, has been observed in other studies, and em-
phasizes the need for rigorous controls, even when evaluating
treatments for persistent conditions like peanut allergy.
Nearly 80% of AR101 subjects completed the study, with dose-
limiting GI AEs in 4 subjects, tolerability concerns with 1
participant, and compliance issues in 1 participant (Figure 1).
Consistent with the known mechanisms of OIT, transient allergic
symptoms occurred in nearly all AR101 subjects, but 96% were
mild. These reactions were not dose-limiting and did not require
medical intervention. No AEs were graded as severe. Overall, side
effects were similar to those reported from previous peanut OIT
trials, with GI symptoms predominating.17-20,34,38,39 Recurrent
GI side effects were also the most common reason for premature
discontinuation, similar to reports from previous peanut OIT
trials.40 Onset was generally early in the course of treatment, and

 symptoms often were not closely associated with the time of
dosing. In all cases of early discontinuation, the screening ps-IgE
level was >100 kUA/L, and symptoms resolved within 3 weeks
of discontinuing AR101; conversely, there were no treatment-
related withdrawals in subjects who had a prestudy ps-IgE of
�100 kUA/L. The association between high ps-IgE and with-
drawal was a post hoc finding that is consistent with previously
published
reports
of
OIT
treatment
failure.21,41
Though
intriguing, this observation should be considered preliminary. The
relationship between fully quantified ps-IgE and safety outcomes
will be further examined as a prespecified endpoint in the phase 3
studies. In one case, a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)
was confirmed by biopsy. There is a strong relationship between
food allergy and EoE, and a recent review documented 20 cases of
EoE emerging during the course of OIT trials, estimating the
overall prevalence of EoE among participants undergoing OIT at
3% to 4%.42 It is currently unclear whether OIT causes EoE or
allows preexisting subclinical EoE to become symptomatic,
though withdrawal of the OIT typically results in remission.43
Given the association between food allergy and EoE, a high in-
dex of suspicion for EoE should be maintained whenever chronic
recurrent GI symptoms occur during OIT.
No subjects reported accidental peanut ingestion. One AR101
subject (described above) received a single epinephrine injection
for moderate anaphylaxis at home after receiving his dose,
possibly related to treatment. Nevertheless, its occurrence em-
phasizes the need for patients and the parents of pediatric pa-
tients undergoing OIT to be educated in the early recognition
and prompt treatment of anaphylaxis.
This study had limitations, several of which were deliber-
ately imposed and intended to promote safety, consistent with
phase 2 development. These included constraint of the study’s
total sample size, restrictions on the age of subjects at enroll-
ment, and exclusion of subjects with a history of life-
threatening anaphylaxis and severe and/or poorly controlled
asthma. We also excluded less sensitive individuals whose
reaction thresholds were �143 mg of peanut protein at the
screening DBPCFC. Thus, we cannot generalize the findings
from ARC001 to these peanut-allergic populations, but future
phase 3 and 4 studies will be able to provide informative data.
It is also important to note that we are reporting data only from
the build-up and early maintenance phases of this phase 2 trial,
and analysis of subjects on maintenance dosing for longer
periods of time and in larger populations (eg, in 3 ongoing
phase 3 studies of AR101) will be required to make more
definitive conclusions regarding safety and efficacy. Finally, it
will be important to establish the impact of AR101 on food
allergy-related quality of life in phase 3, as it was not measured
in ARC001.
In summary, ARC001 was the first phase 2 peanut OIT study
to use sufficiently rigorous design features, and it provided pre-
liminary but high-quality evidence that AR101 has immuno-
modulatory
activity
that
can
significantly
reduce
clinical
reactivity to peanut after build-up to 300 mg of peanut protein
and 2 weeks of maintenance therapy on this dose. On average,
after approximately 6 months of treatment with AR101, subjects
experienced, in the context of the DBPCFC, an 18-fold increase
in the amount of peanut protein successfully tolerated, as well as
a significant blunting in the severity of allergic symptoms. Larger
and longer placebo-controlled studies are required to better
characterize the safety and effectiveness of AR101 in broader
populations. As a standardized and highly characterized phar-
maceutical, AR101 has the potential to provide an overall safe
and effective means to desensitize peanut-allergic children older
than 4 years, adolescents, and young adults in an appropriately
supervised clinical setting, a hypothesis that is currently being
further tested in an ongoing phase 3 program.

Inclusion criteria
Subjects who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment as study subjects:
1. Age 4 through 26 y
2. Clinical history of allergy to peanuts or peanut-containing foods
3. Serum IgE to peanut of � 0.35 kUA/L (determined by the UniCAP� automated immunoassay system within the past 12 mo) and/or an SPT to
peanut >3 mm compared with control
4. Experience dose-limiting symptoms at or before the 100 mg (143 mg cumulative) dose of peanut protein (measured as 200 mg of peanut flour) on
screening DBPCFC conducted in accordance with PRACTALL guidelines
5. Written informed consent from parent/guardian for minor subjects
6. Written assent from minor subjects as appropriate (eg, above the age of 7 y)
7. Use of birth control by female subjects of child-bearing potential
8. Should not be residing in the same address as another subject in this study
9. Cannot have participated in a clinical trial 30 d before randomization
Exclusion criteria
Subjects who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study subjects:
1. History of cardiovascular disease
2. History of frequent or repeated, severe or life-threatening episodes of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock
3. History of other chronic disease (other than asthma, atopic dermatitis, or rhinitis) requiring therapy (eg, heart disease, diabetes)
4. History of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease
5. Current participation in any other interventional study

7. Severe asthma (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 5 or 6)
8. Mild or moderate (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 1-4) asthma, if uncontrolled as defined by any of the following:
� FEV1 < 80% of predicted, or FEV1/FVC < 75%, with or without controller medications (only for age 6 or greater and able to do spirometry) or
� ICS dosing of >500 mcg daily fluticasone (or equivalent inhaled corticosteroids based on NHLBI dosing chart) or
� 1 hospitalization in the past year for asthma or
� ER visit within 6 mo

� history of daily oral steroid dosing for >1 mo during the past year or
� burst or steroid course in the past 3 mo before inclusion or
� >2 burst oral steroid course in the past year of at least 1-wk duration
10. Inability to discontinue antihistamines 5 half-lives before the initial day of escalation, skin testing, or DBPCFC
11. Lack of an available palatable vehicle food to which the subject is not allergic
12. Use of omalizumab within the past 6 mo, or current use of other investigational forms of allergen immunotherapy (eg, oral or sublingual) or
immunomodulator therapy (not including corticosteroids)
13. Use of beta-blockers (oral), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), or calcium channel blockers
14. Pregnancy or lactation
15. Having the same place of residence as another subject in the study
16. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 d before randomization

TABLE E2. Grading system for severity of allergic reactions developed by the consortium of food allergy research29
Grade 1—Mild
Grade 2—Moderate
Grade 3—Severe
Grade 4—Life Threatening
Grade 5—Death
Transient or mild discomfort
(<48 h), no or minimal
medical intervention/therapy
required.
These symptoms may include
pruritus, swelling or rash,
abdominal discomfort or other
transient symptoms.
Symptoms that produce mild-
to-moderate limitation in
activity, some assistance may
be needed; no or minimal
intervention/therapy is
required.
Hospitalization is possible.
These symptoms may
include persistent hives,
wheezing without dyspnea,
abdominal discomfort/
increased vomiting or other
symptoms
Marked limitation in activity,
some assistance usually
required; medical
intervention/therapy
required, hospitalization is
possible. Symptoms may
include bronchospasm with
dyspnea, severe abdominal
pain, throat tightness with
hoarseness, and transient
hypotension among others.
Parenteral medication(s)
are usually indicated
Extreme limitation in activity,
significant assistance
required; significant
medical/therapy.
Intervention is required;
hospitalization is probable.
Symptoms may include
persistent hypotension and/
or hypoxia with resultant
decreased level of
consciousness associated
with collapse and/or
incontinence or other life-
threatening symptoms
