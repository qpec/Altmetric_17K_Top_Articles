ABSTRACT
Objective: To summarize research on couple sleeping with respect to gender-specific differences
and chronotype. Methods: Systematic review of the literature. Results: Millions of adults around the
world share their beds with a partner. This may be an expression of intimacy and attachment and
tends to intensify romantic relationships. Yet, couple sleeping still has underestimated implica-
tions for the quality of the relationship, quality of sleep and for physical and psychological health
which are not consistently positive. Implications for research and therapy are discussed.
Conclusions: Despite the people involved perhaps not even being aware of their nocturnal
interactions, it is important that sleeping together becomes a subject of discussion.

Introduction
Going to sleep and waking up together is one of the
most intimate human actions that “optimally occurs
when one feels sufficiently safe and secure to down-
regulate vigilance and alertness” (Troxel et al.,
2007). In Western societies, it is very common for
couples to spend the nights in the same bed.
However, little importance is attached to the link
between couple sleeping and couple functioning. In
more sociological terms, Meadows et al. (2008) state
that couples have their own sleep habitus by the
beginning of a relationship and that conflicts arise
when these do not match. Although there is plenty
of psychological and medical literature on human
sleep and sleep problems, sleep is mostly viewed as
an individual phenomenon and couple sleep is still
a neglected topic (Rosenblatt, 2006). Men and
women differ in terms of their reactions toward a
bed partner. These differences in the nocturnal
sleep reactions may be caused by cultural norms
or parenting in women and the desire for group
sleep in men (Dittami et al., 2007). Moreover, men
and women tend to have different diurnal prefer-
ences
and
chronotypes.
Both
aspects
may
contribute to sleep problems and may affect the
daytime functioning of the relationship. Besides
the effects on sleep architecture, couple sleeping
also influences couples’ daytime functioning, sexual
activity, marital satisfaction as well as physical and
psychological health.
Especially when it comes to sleeping disorders,
couple sleeping should be in the focus of interest.
Since sleep problems of one partner may also
become a problem for the other, couple sleeping
should be taken into consideration when dealing
with sleep problems such as apnea or snoring. This
paper aims to summarize the literature about cou-
ple sleeping with respect to gender- and chrono-
type-specific differences. The results open up
interesting possibilities for the diagnosis and ther-
apy of sleep disorders and conflict behavior in the
context of relationships.

 sleep, co-sleep, pair sleep, chronotype, gender,
depression, anxiety, mental health and sleep. Due
to the limited research in the field of couple sleep-
ing, additional studies and sources were identified
by reference sections of relevant articles. For the
chapter on the impact of chronotypes, an addi-
tional search of the literature was conducted in
PubMed using the following search terms: (chron-
otype or “circadian preference” or morningness or
eveningness or “early bird*” or “night owl*” or
lark or larks or owl or owls or “morning type*”
or “evening type*” or “morning orientation” or
“evening orientation”) and (monogam* or poly-
gam* or sexual* or socio-sexual* or sociosexual*
or mating or machiavell* or narciss* or psycho-
path* or “dark triad” or “couple sleep”). This
search yielded 40 results after filtering for litera-
ture about humans, of which 33 were excluded,
either because they had already been identified in a
prior search or for not focusing on interpersonal
relationships.
Gender-specific differences
Sleep is not only a fundamental human need for
the maintenance of cognitive performance, physi-
cal and mental health but it is also embedded in a
social context (Troxel, 2010). From an evolution-
ary perspective, sleeping in pairs can enhance the
perceived physical and emotional security, which
leads to a reduction of arousal levels and to
increased quality and quantity of sleep. Yet, men
and women respond differently to the presence of
a bed partner. The male perception of sleep is
that sleep is important and a necessity, especially
in relation to paid work. Men seem to have an
understanding that their body will inform them
when it is time to sleep and when their resources
are used up (Meadows et al., 2008). Dittami et al.
(2007) reported that co-sleeping is generally more
disturbing for women than for men assessed by
subjective reports, but also that a mitigation
through sexual contact is possible (Table 1).
Troxel (2010) however argued that due to lower
physical strength and greater need for security
against potential attackers, the soothing effect of
co-sleeping is stronger among women. Moreover,
women’s sleeping behavior is embedded in female
social roles and responsibilities as a partner.
Research addressing women’s reactions toward a
sleep partner draws an unclear picture. In a study
consisting of 5142 women in their midlife, unin-
tentional partner behaviors like snoring, going to
the toilet during the night or restlessness turned
out to be most disturbing for women’s sleep
(Arber et al., 2007). The findings indicate that
actions beyond the control of their male partners
have
a
highly
significant
correlation
with
women’s sleep quality. Whereas intentional dis-
ruptions like waking the female partner up to
talk, for sex or because she disrupts his sleep
had a low and nonsignificant correlation with
the overall quality of women’s sleep. In a study
conducted
by
Pankhurst
and
Horne
(1994),
women more frequently reported nocturnal dis-
turbances by their partners, such as discrete
movements during the night. These are more
often shown by men and sleeping with a partner
was associated with a greater number of discrete
movements than sleeping alone. Yet, differences
in the individual perception occurred since most
participants, men and women, reported to sleep
better when a bed partner was present. Alike,
Monroe (1969) found that although sleeping
alone leads to a significant increase in stage 4
sleep and a decrease in REM sleep compared to
nights when sleeping with a partner, participants
report being less satisfied with their sleep in
nights spent alone. Apparently, the objectively
impaired sleep quality contrasts the subjective
perception of a restful night. In a more recent
study, Spiegelhalder et al. (2015) investigated the
effect of the sleep location and co-sleeping on the
quality of sleep while focusing on young couples.
The sleep location did not have a strong effect on
sleep quantity or quality but the perceived sleep
quality was better in both sexes when sleeping
together. Moreover, there was no discrepancy
between objective and subjective sleep. Gender-
specific differences occurred in the sleeping dura-
tion: men slept longer and got up later when
sleeping with a partner. This may be a result of
increased perceived security during the sleep in
men. This effect may be counteracted in women
by the disturbing effect of the partner. Moreover,
among young couples, a high concordance of
body movements when sleeping together was
shown.

 Impact of chronotypes
Morningness–eveningness preferences are seen
and understood both as a personality trait and as
a trait based on biological factors (Duarte et al.,
2014). The trait aspect is especially interesting for
human mating behavior. Before couples even get
closer together, chronotypes seem to be an impor-
tant factor in assortative mating. Two extreme
chronotypes with different circadian rhythmicity
are unlikely to meet because of their small overlap
in their preferred active time. However, low dis-
similarity
in
morningness–eveningness
is
not
linked to higher relationship satisfaction (Randler
& Kretz, 2011). Nevertheless, women would prefer
a partner with a similar chronotype. Randler et al.
(2014) compared the sleep–wake behavior of

 women with that of their actual partners and that
of a hypothetical, preferred partner. They could
show that, given the choice, females would prefer
a partner closer to their own sleep–wake rhythm,
indicating that assortative mating according to
sleep–wake rhythm may exist. Among various
sleep–wake measures, women particularly prefer
a partner going to bed at the same time. It should
be noted that these preferences may depend on the
phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle.
Chronotypes and gender preferences also have
consequences
for
a
couple’s
sexual
activity.
Jankowski et al. (2014) have shown that there is a
general major evening peak of sexual activity and
desire in females, regardless of their chronotype.
Whereas in males, the greatest need for sex
occurred either in the morning or evening hours
according to their chronotype (evening types at
9:00–12:00 and 18:00–3:00 and in morning types
at 6:00–12:00 and 18:00–24:00). As a possible con-
sequence, couples with mismatched chronotypes
have more marital conflicts and less sexual inter-
course than matched couples (Larson et al., 1991).
Chronotype can not only impact the timing of
desire and sexual activity, but also the number of
sexual partners: In males, eveningness seems to be
associated with a higher number of sexual partners
and while there was no such correlation found in
females, associations between eveningness and
behavioral traits that are instrumental in short-
term mating strategies are stronger for women
than men (Maestripieri, 2014). One possible expla-
nation for this connection of eveningness and
number of sexual partners may be that evening
types tend to display higher risk-taking propensi-
ties which may be causally or functionally linked
to their propensities for sensation- and novelty-
seeking,
impulsivity,
and
sexual
promiscuity
(Ponzi et al., 2014).
Furthermore, gender-specific differences con-
cerning chronotypes can be found in the literature:
Girls and women are significantly more morning
oriented than boys and men, while men have a
more
pronounced
eveningness
preference
(Randler, 2007). These differences could stem
from a different interplay between the circadian
pacemaker and the sleep–wake cycle processes,
which could in turn help to make the circadian
system in males more flexible and more able to
adapt to environmental change than that in
females, whereas the genetically programmed cir-
camensual rhythm in women may contribute to
making their circadian systems less flexible and
less adaptable to environmental change (Adan &
Natale, 2002) (Table 2). Despite genetic predispo-
sitions, chronotypes seem to be able to change and
adapt depending on the social circumstances:
women are more morning-oriented than men
until the age of 30, whereas women older than 45
years are more evening-oriented than men. The
phase-delay of adolescents and the phase-advance
of the elderly seem to be more present in men than
in women (Duarte et al., 2014). Also social zeitge-
ber like the scheduling by children and family has
a very large impact on a mother’s lifestyle and
sleep–wake rhythm, far beyond the first months
of life. Children seem to be an even more impor-
tant social factor than the male partner (Leonhard
& Randler, 2009).
Finally, when considering gender as a moderat-
ing variable, according to a recent review of the
literature by Fabbian et al. (2016), associations of
eveningness with a number of negative outcomes
in the domains of physical and psychological
health, sleep and achievement may be stronger
for women than for men.
Effect on relationships
Sleep problems and relationship problems tend to
co-occur, particularly during times of significant
life events or transitions, such as adjustment to an
illness, the birth of the first child, or relationship
dissolution (Troxel, 2010). Thus, the link between
sleep and relationship quality is supposed to be
bidirectional, reciprocal and dynamic. The model
of dynamic association between relationship func-
tioning and sleep by Troxel et al. (2007) is based
on reciprocal pathways and gives a possible theo-
retical framework of the interplay between sleep
and relationship quality.
In a healthy relationship, a partner serves as a
successful stress-buffer by providing downregulat-
ing
physiological
and
psychological
stress
responses and counteracting health behaviors that
could have a negative impact on sleep. In contrast,
stressful relationships lead to increased physiolo-
gical and emotional arousal, poor health behaviors,

behavioral traits that are instrumental in short-term mating strategies are stronger for women.

 and a greater risk for sleep disturbance and dis-
orders. Empirically there seem to exist some gen-
der differences: for females, less negative partner
interaction during the day predicted greater sleep
efficiency in the following night, whereas vice
versa for males, higher sleep efficiency predicted
less negative partner interaction the following day
(Hasler & Troxel, 2010). Similarly, wives’ marital
satisfaction is associated with couples’ sleep con-
cordance measured by actigraphy, regardless of
husbands’ attachment style (anxious or avoidant)
(Gunn et al., 2015). The variables with the most
significant couple interdependency are: timing of
going to bed, sleep latency, light/dark ratio, and
wake bouts (Meadows et al., 2009).
Over time, couples evolve interactional rules
and sleep routines that bind them together. These
behaviors need some time to emerge in a new
relationship and often imply a modification of
sleep behavior (Hislop, 2007).
Couple sleeping and sleeping disorders
Most of the literature about couple sleeping does
not deal with this subject as a daily phenomenon
but within a clinical context with regard to sleep
disorders. Females sleeping with male snorers have
decreased sleep quality and increased sleep frag-
mentation. However, it cannot be suggested that
objective sleep quality improves substantially in
the female non-snoring partner when she sleeps
alone for one night (Blumen et al., 2009). In a
study conducted by Ulfberg et al. (2000) spouses
of snorers also more frequently report sleeping
problems, insomnia, daytime fatigue and sleepi-
ness. No differences were found between spouses
of snorers who sleep in the same room and those
who sleep in separate rooms. Wives of patients
suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) per-
ceive their marriages as more stressful, and they
perceive no regeneration by social activities and
leisure time. Therefore, wives should be integrated
in the treatment of their husbands suffering from
sleep apnea (Cartwright & Knight, 1987). Patients
suffering from OSA can improve their quality of
life through continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP). Parish and Lyng (2003) showed that the
use of CPAP also improves the quality of life in
their sleeping partners in the domains of role-
physical, vitality, social functioning, role-emo-
tional and mental health. Moreover, wives can
even have a supportive effect on the use of
CPAP. In a study by Cartwright (2008), treatment
adherence was strongly related to the wife sharing
the bed. After 2 weeks of CPAP, men’s score on
the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life index improved
and was significantly higher than the wife’s score,
indicating that the man was better adjusted to his
diagnosis and treatment than she was. Husbands
who slept separately used their CPAP machine less
frequently than regular bed sharers. Furthermore,
the sleep of the non-sharing wives was negatively
impacted by their partners’ CPAP use. Previous
findings indicate that relationship quality plays
an important role when diagnosing sleep disorders
and that it may lead to important information
concerning the etiology and maintenance of the
disorder. Furthermore, a healthy relationship and
a motivating co-sleeper may be an important
motivating factor to initiate and adhere to treat-
ment. Conversely, if relationship problems are pre-
sumed to be a significant factor in the etiology or
maintenance of a sleep disorder, couples’ counsel-
ing may be an important adjunct to treatment
(Troxel et al., 2007).
Couple sleeping and mental health
Recent research indicates that there are some con-
nections between couple sleep and mental health.
El-Sheikh et al. (2013) investigated a possible
intervening effect of mental health variables on
interpartner psychological conflict and couple
sleep in 135 couples. The authors showed that
depression and anxiety symptoms functioned as
intervening variables and affected both the own
and the partner’s sleep. Women being the recipi-
ent of interpartner psychological conflict had more
symptoms of anxiety, which was associated with
reduced sleep efficiency. Results also indicate
depression symptoms to be an intervening variable
in the association of being recipient of interpartner
psychological conflict and sleep quality. Also the
perpetration of interpartner psychological conflict
was found to be related to increased anxiety within
the partner, which was related to longer sleep
latencies for the actor.
CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
1469
 Revenson et al. (2016) investigated associations
between anxiety and depression symptoms and
couple sleep in a sample of 543 middle-aged cou-
ples. Results indicate that high levels of anxiety
and depression had an influence on the partner’s
sleep duration. The effect of the men’s mental
health on their wives was stronger than vice
versa, for example women with husbands showing
high levels of depression had a shorter sleep dura-
tion one year later, while the reverse effect from
husbands’ depression symptoms on their wives’
sleep duration was not significant. Also a small
moderating effect of sleep duration was found in
the sample: in women with shorter sleep duration,
depressive symptoms were more strongly related
to depressive symptoms one year later than in
those with longer sleep duration. Troxel et al.
(2007) examined the relationship between attach-
ment anxiety, marital status, bed-partner status,
and sleep in 107 women suffering from recurring
major depression. Relationship measures had no
main effect or interactional effect on subjective
sleep quality, but a polysomnography indicated
that women with a bed partner had better sleep
efficiency. Married women showed shorter sleep
latencies compared to never married women. A
reduced percentage of stage 3 and 4 sleep was
found in anxiously attached women. In addition,
a significant interaction was found between attach-
ment
anxiety
and
marital
status:
anxiously
attached women who were divorced, separated or
widowed displayed a particularly low percentage of
stage 3 and 4 sleep. Overall results indicate that
depressed women are a high-risk group vulnerable
to psychological and physical health threats. Past
and current relationship experiences seem to have
important implications for present sleep.
Implications and limitations
For most couples, the reality of sleeping in the same
bed is a compromise, with each partner experien-
cing less than satisfactory sleep. It would seem that
the logical solution to sleep disruption would be to
relocate; moving into another room, or at least a
twin bed, to overcome the “bed of thorns” created
by gendered expectations, snoring, and other aber-
rant partner behaviours. Yet paradoxically, [. . .] only
7% of couples under 55 currently sleep in separate
beds, despite almost half complaining of being awa-
kened up to six times a night. [. . .] Sleeping apart for
couples represents a break in the routines of sleep
and a departure from the frame of reference so
crucial to sleep patterning. Rather than promoting
a good night’s sleep, sleeping alone can actually
hinder sleep, with partner absence and the empti-
ness of the bed disturbing the “ambience and the
ritual” associated with sleeping together [.][. . .] This
suggests a strong cultural association between being
a couple and sharing a bed. Despite the possibility of
better sleep elsewhere, couples in general show a
willingness to go along with the possible disruption
associated with sharing a bed to preserve the well-
being of the relationship and to meet social expecta-
tions of appropriate couple behavior. (Hislop, 2007)
For research:
Literature on couple sleep in nonclinical settings
is scarce. Based on the existing research, it can be
assumed that there are gender-specific differences
in the reaction to the presence of a bed partner.
This may have an influence on the quality of the
relationship.
Future studies should extend the knowledge
about the link between bed sharing and the quality
of both relationship and sleep, e.g. regarding
chronotypes and the phase of the woman’s men-
strual cycle.
Because characteristics of sleep and those of
romantic relationships influence each other, it
will be important to identify biological markers
in couples, such as the concordance of melatonin
and oxytocin secretion.
Also, as proposed by Randler and Kretz (2011)
further studies should use other forms of sampling
such as random sampling of couples and sampling
in households instead of during events in order to
sample partners spending less time together or
preferring less similar activities. Furthermore,
research intending to study gender differences in
morningness should provide a low variance in age
and ideally provide the same mean age for both
genders. Additionally, future work should further
investigate different age classes and explore the
genetic
basis
of
sleep-related
traits
(Randler,
2007). Finally, referring to Spiegelhalder et al.
(2015) future studies should contain larger sample
sizes.

 quality, relationship satisfaction and chronotype
similarity in homosexual or transgender couples
would be an interesting future research topic.
For practice:
Some marital problems might be associated
with nocturnal disruptions. The aspect that con-
flicts are caused by disturbed sleep or diverging
preferences
due
to
mismatched
chronotypes
should be taken into consideration by physicians,
therapists, and marriage counselors.
For patients with sleep disorders where relation-
ship problems are suspected to play a role in the
etiology or course of the sleep disorder, couples’
sleep therapy may prove helpful in addition to
standard treatment. The assessment of sleep pat-
terns and habits and possible sources of stress may
be relevant for the treatment of sleep disorders
(Troxel, 2010).
Partners should be included when treating sleep
disturbances such as sleep apnea or snoring in
order to improve not only the patients’ health
but to enhance relationship satisfaction and qual-
ity of life of the partner.
As mentioned by Spiegelhalder et al. (2015),
sleeping in pairs can be a protective factor for
the development and maintenance of insomnia,
thus the dyadic nature of sleep should be consid-
ered when treating sleeping disorders. Also the
partner’s mental health has an influence on one’s
sleep
and
should
be
kept
in
mind
during
treatment.
Sleeping apart is not necessarily an indicator of
an unhappy or unhealthy relationship and may be
taken into consideration. At least couples should
be encouraged to have an open dialogue about
sleeping habits in order to sleep better and to
have a happier relationship (Troxel et al., 2007).
The shared goal should be finding a balance
between the role of sleeper and that of partner
(Hislop, 2007).
