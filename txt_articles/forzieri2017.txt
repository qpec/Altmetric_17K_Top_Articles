Increasing risk over time of weather-related hazards to the 
European population: a data-driven prognostic study
Giovanni Forzieri, Alessandro Cescatti, Filipe Batista e Silva, Luc Feyen
Summary
Background The observed increase in the effects on human beings of weather-related disasters has been largely 
attributed to the rise in population exposed, with a possible influence of global warming. Yet, future risks of 
weather-related hazards on human lives in view of climate and demographic changes have not been comprehensively 
investigated.
Methods We assessed the risk of weather-related hazards to the European population in terms of annual numbers of 
deaths in 30 year intervals relative to the reference period (1981–2010) up to the year 2100 (2011–40, 2041–70, and 
2071–100) by combining disaster records with high-resolution hazard and demographic projections in a prognostic 
modelling framework. We focused on the hazards with the greatest impacts—heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, 
droughts, river and coastal floods, and windstorms—and evaluated their spatial and temporal variations in intensity 
and frequency under a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled long-term demographic 
dynamics through a territorial modelling platform to represent the evolution of human exposure under a 
corresponding middle-of-the-road socioeconomic scenario. We appraised human vulnerability to weather extremes 
on the basis of more than 2300 records collected from disaster databases during the reference period and assumed it 
to be static under a scenario of no adaptation.
Findings We found that weather-related disasters could affect about two-thirds of the European population annually by 
the year 2100 (351 million people exposed per year [uncertainty range 126 million to 523 million] during the period 
2071–100) compared with 5% during the reference period (1981–2010; 25 million people exposed per year). About 
50 times the number of fatalities occurring annually during the reference period (3000 deaths) could occur by the 
year 2100 (152 000 deaths [80 500–239 800]). Future effects show a prominent latitudinal gradient, increasing towards 
southern Europe, where the premature mortality rate due to weather extremes (about 700 annual fatalities per million 
inhabitants [482–957] during the period 2071–100 vs 11 during the reference period) could become the greatest 
environmental risk factor. The projected changes are dominated by global warming (accounting for more than 90% of 
the rise in risk to human beings), mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2700 heat-related fatalities 
per year during the reference period vs 151 500 [80 100–239 000] during the period 2071–100).
Interpretation Global warming could result in rapidly rising costs of weather-related hazards to human beings in 
Europe unless adequate adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation of regional investments 
to address the unequal burden of effects on human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation 
capacities.

Introduction
Climate change is one of the biggest global threats to 
human health of the 21st century.1 Its peril to society will 
be increasingly connected to weather-driven hazards2–4 
because extreme weather states are expected to 
disproportionately rise compared with changes in 
climate averages.5 Human beings are affected by 
extreme weather events through a set of complex 
pathways, including direct effects, such as death and 
immediate injuries when the event strikes a society, and 
delayed or indirect effects, such as illness, mental 
health effects, and effects associated with the ecology 
of infectious diseases and disruption of crucial 
infrastructure.1,6 Demographic growth and shifts to 
hazard-prone locations, such as coastal zones and cities, 
can increase the number of human beings exposed and 
ultimately lead to increased risk.7,8 In view of these 
pressures, the future effects of weather-related extremes 
on people need to be quantified to identify where and to 
what extent their livelihoods will be at risk in the future 
and develop timely and effective adaptation and disaster 
risk reduction strategies.
Human risks arise from interactions of the hazards, 
the societies exposed to the hazards, and the vulnerability 
of the societies to adverse effects when exposed. 
Disentangling of the contributions of these drivers is a 
complex process because of little understanding of popu-
lation vulnerability and the absence of well established

scientific methods.9,10 Several studies11,12 have derived 
analytical functions that relate mortality to extreme 
temperatures under today’s climate and extrapolated 
them to climate change scenarios. Relationships differ by 
climate zone, geographical area, and temperature 
metrics,13 and only a few studies10,14–16 document regional-
scale-to-global-scale effects. Future effects of river and 
coastal floods have also been extensively studied.17,18 
However, these approaches generally neglect human 
vulnerability and only report the population potentially 
exposed (eg, people living within the flooded areas), 
without expressing the corresponding proportion of 
potential fatalities in the population.19 For most other 
weather-related hazards, estimation of human effects is 
hampered by an absence of robust vulnerability models 
based on observation-driven statistics. Difficulties in 
establish 
ment of comparisons of hazards remain particu-
larly relevant, and no comprehensive projections of the 
effects of weather-related extremes on human beings in 
Europe have yet been provided.
To make progress on these issues, we present a 
detailed assessment of the evolution of single-hazard 
and multihazard risks for the population of Europe until 
the year 2100. We quantify the human effects as a 
multiplicative function of hazard, exposure, and popu-
lation vulnerability. Integration of these three elements 
provides future estimates of plausible human risks, 
which are strongly rooted in the observational records 
and account for the combined effects of climate and 
population changes.
Methods
Methodological framework
We used the risk framework proposed by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change20 to 
estimate the people exposed (Rexp) as a combination of 
hazards (H; weather-related extremes) and exposure 
(E; population distribution)—ie, Rexp=H × E. The effect 
on human beings is ultimately expressed in terms of 
deaths (Rfat) as a function of hazards, exposure, and 
population vulnerability (V)—ie, Rfat=H × E × V. Each of 
these risk components is described in the following 
sections. Weather-related risks are expressed as relative 
vari 
ations compared with the reference period 
(1981–2010) and were derived for the following 30 year 
time intervals: 2011–40, 2041–70, and 2071–100. 
Analyses are done at the spatial resolution of 1 km for 
the 28 European Union (EU) countries as well as 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and Scopus for articles published up to 
July 5, 2017, with no language restrictions, using the search 
terms “forecasting” OR “projection” OR “estimation” OR 
“prediction”, “weather” OR “climate”, “hazard” OR “risk” OR 
“impact”, and “human” OR “health” OR “population” OR 
“people” in the publication title and abstract. The identified 
studies on the effect of weather-related extremes on human 
beings have mainly targeted the effects of heat-related 
mortality, often focusing on specific settings, such as urban 
areas. Few studies document regional-to-global-scale effects. 
For most other weather-related hazards, estimation of effects 
on human beings is hampered by the absence of 
observation-based vulnerability relations. Furthermore, other 
drivers of risk, such as demographic changes, are often not 
considered in hazard effect assessments.
Added value of this study
Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of 
weather-driven single-hazard and multihazard effects on the 
European population until the year 2100 under a scenario of no 
adaptation. For this purpose, we developed a novel method that 
combines weather-related disaster records with a set of 
high-resolution projections of climate hazard and population 
density. Expected effects on populations are quantified in terms 
of number of people exposed and fatalities. We consistently 
assessed how the seven most harmful weather-related extremes 
(heatwaves and cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal 
floods, and windstorms) might evolve in Europe in view of global 
warming. Previous assessments of the effects on human beings of 
climate extremes focused mostly on the effects of temperatures. 
We derived population vulnerability to each hazard on the basis of 
an exhaustive dataset of observed weather-related disaster losses 
collected from multiple disaster databases. We incorporated 
high-resolution demographic dynamics in our modelling 
framework to account for variations in human exposure as 
another key driver of change in human risk. Existing studies are 
typically restricted to the effects on today’s population or, at best, 
use national projections. Integration of these elements provides 
plausible estimates of extreme weather-related risks on future 
European generations.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study contributes to the ongoing debate about the need to 
urgently curb climate change and minimise its unavoidable 
consequences, as emphasised by the Paris Agreement built on 
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Our findings 
shed light on the expected burden of climate on societies across 
different regions of Europe. The substantial rise in risk of 
weather-related hazards to human beings due to global 
warming, population growth, and urbanisation highlights the 
need for stringent climate mitigation policies and appropriate 
adaptation and risk reduction measures to minimise the future 
effect of weather-related extremes on human lives. In that 
respect, our results are particularly relevant for the first priority 
action “understanding disaster risk” of the UN Sendai 
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and objective 
two “promoting better informed decision-making by 
addressing gaps in knowledge” of the European Union Strategy 
on Adaptation to Climate Change.

Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland (EU+). We used 
MATLAB R2012 for statistical analyses. Details of the 
general methods are reported in the appendix. 
Hazards (weather-related extremes)
We derived weather-related hazard indicators for heat-
waves and cold waves, river and coastal floods, streamflow 
droughts, wildfires, and windstorms for the reference 
period and future time periods for an ensemble of climate 
projections under the business-as-usual SRES A1B 
greenhouse gas emissions scenario (appendix). The 
hazard term (H) is expressed as the fraction of the 
territory that is expected to be exposed annually to a 
hazard with the intensity of a present 100 year event or 
more intense. We calculated it by integrating the territory 
subject to hazard intensities over the probability of 
occurrence distribution of hazard intensities retrieved 
through extreme value analysis. For pixels with non-
significant changes, we kept baseline H values for future 
time periods. This approach implies that the projections 
of effects reported in this study only reflect significant 
changes (p value of <0·05) in weather-driven hazards due 
to climate change. Details are reported in the appendix.
Exposure (population distribution)
We assessed changes in population exposure (E) 
consistent with the middle-of-the-road Shared Socio-
economic Pathway and business-as-usual climate scenario 
(SRES A1B)21 for the reference period and future time 
periods 
by 
generating 
high-resolution 
projections 
of gridded population density for Europe with the 
Land Use-based Integrated Sustainability Assessment 
territorial modelling platform.22 These maps capture the 
fine-scale processes of population dynamics (eg, urban 
expansion, stagnation or degrowth, and concentration) 
that represent key drivers of the future exposure of 
populations. We derived complementary information on 
the degree of urbanisation of municipalities from the 
Eurostat dataset23 and the share of elderly people (>65 years 
of age) in future societies from the European Commission 
dataset.24 Details are reported in the appendix.
Population vulnerability
Vulnerability (V) describes the relationship between the 
exposure to a weather-related hazard and the effect on 
human beings. It is quantified in this study as the ratio 
between the people killed by a climate disaster (Rfat) and 
the population exposed to the hazard with intensity (or 
frequency) equal to or larger (lower) than the current 
100 year event (Rexp). To appraise V for the reference 
period, we calculated Rexp over the period 1981–2010. We 
obtained Rfat, expressed as the annual number of deaths 
for each hazard and country, from more than 
2300 weather-related disaster records collected over the 
same period in the Emergency Events Database and 
Munich Re’s NatCatSERVICE25 disaster database. We 
quantified vulnerability at country level and considered it 
to be static with time, thus assuming no changes in 
human vulnerability or additional measures to enhance 
human capacity to cope with future extreme climate 
conditions. Details are reported in the appendix.
Effects on human beings of single and multiple 
weather-related extremes
Future effects on human beings—ie, number of people 
exposed (Rexp) and deaths (Rfat)—are separately calculated 
for each hazard and climate realisation to sample the 
intermodel climate spread. The overall effect of weather-
related hazards is calculated as the sum of the multimodel 
medians of the effects of each single hazard and the 
corresponding uncertainty, expressed as the multimodel 
maximum and minimum of the effects of each single 
hazard. We implicitly assume that the single-hazard 
effects are independent (appendix). Spatial maps of effects 
for the reference period and future time periods are 
obtained by downscaling country effects to Nomenclature 
of Statistical Territorial Units 2 level according to the 
spatial distribution of the exposed population. Details are 
reported in the appendix. Estimates of weather-related 
effects for the reference period and future time periods 
are fully conditional on the recorded losses. Hence, any 
deviations of the reported deaths from the true effects are 
inherently translated into future losses.

Results
Our projections show a rapid rise in the death toll due 
to weather-related disasters in Europe during this 
century under a scenario of climate and population 
change (figure 1). During the reference period 
(1981–2010), around 3000 Europeans lose their lives 
each year because of weather disasters. If no adaptation 
measures are implemented, this number could rise sub-
stantially in the coming decades, to reach 32 500 deaths 
(uncertainty range 10 700–59 300) by the period 2011–40 
(about a ten-times increase), 103 300 (48 300–179 300) 
by 2041–70 (about a 30-times increase), and 152 000 
(80 500–239 800) by 2071–100 (about a 50-times 
increase). The population that is exposed on an annual 
basis is projected to increase from 25 million per year 
during the reference period to 78 million (27 million to 
166 million) by the period 2011–40, 236 million 
(74 million to 471 million) by 2041–70, and 351 million 
(126 million to 523 million) by 2071–100. These findings 
imply that, by the end of this century, about two-thirds 
of Europeans could be exposed to a weather-related 
disaster every year compared with 5% during the 
reference period.

Climate change is the dominant driver of the projected 
trends, accounting for more than 90% of the rise in the 
risk to human beings (figure 1). This finding is because 
Europe is expected to face major changes in the frequency 
of multiple climate extremes during the coming decades 
(appendix) and be exposed to a progressive and strong 
increase in overall weather-related hazards. In particular, 
very rare (and often high-impact) extreme events are 
expected to increase in frequency more than high-
probability low-effect weather-related hazards.26
The effects of hazards on human lives differ greatly in 
terms of both magnitude and rate of change (figure 2). 
Heatwaves are the most lethal weather-related hazard. 
During the reference period, about 2700 heat-related 
fatalities per year were reported in Europe by the 
disaster databases. This number is projected to grow 
exponentially, to reach 151 500 (uncertainty range 
80 100–239 000) by the period 2071–100 (5400% relative 
increase), or 99% of the total future weather-related 
disaster death toll. These numbers are within the range 
reported in previous pan-European epidemiological 
studies.14,15 Fatalities associated with coastal flooding also 
rise substantially (by 3780%), leading to 233 deaths every 
year during 2071–100 compared with only six fatalities 
per annum during the reference period. The increase in 
deaths caused by wildfires (138%) is expected to claim 
about 57 lives every year by 2071–100 (15–136), the increase 
caused by river floods (54%) is expected to claim about 
106 (60–239), and the increase caused by windstorms (20%) 
is predicted to claim about 124 (111–161). Droughts can be 
lethal in low-income and middle-income countries, mostly 
because of poor agricultural techniques and under-
nutrition.27 On the contrary, people in high-income 
countries have diverse diets (based on food from 
geographically diffuse producers) and guaranteed access 
to clean water for basic needs.28 Therefore, fatalities from 
droughts are rare in Europe and have not been reported in 
the observational period of this study. As a positive 
consequence of global warming, the number of fatalities 
from cold waves will decline strongly. However, this effect 
will not be sufficient to compensate for the above-
mentioned rise in fatalities from other hazards.
The striking growth in weather-related fatalities projected 
in this study reflects the increase of the European population 
exposed to intense hazards, which will probably result in an 
increase in other, non-lethal effects on human beings 
(appendix). Direct injuries from flooding, windstorms, and 
wildfires could rise in the areas hit by the hazard. Because 
of more frequent and intense droughts (a longer lasting and 
spatially dispersed hazard) in the future than at present, the 
number of people faced with reduced water resources for 
food production, domestic use, and other basic needs for 
human wellbeing could grow to 138 million people 
(uncertainty range 32 million to 322 million) per year 
by 2071–100, or more than 27 times the number during the 
reference period (5 million). With 211 million Europeans 
(83 million to 379 million) annually exposed to heatwaves 
by 2071–100—compared with the 5 million during the 
reference period (figure 2)—cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, 
and respiratory diseases might amplify. Furthermore, 
mental health disorders associated with weather-related 
disasters, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and 
depression,29 could also increase.
The overall progressive increased risk to human 
beings shows a prominent latitudinal gradient towards 
southern European countries (figure 3). This pattern is 
largely driven by the stronger rise in the frequency and 
intensity of heatwaves towards the south, fewer droughts 
in northern Europe, and an upsurge in drought 
conditions in southern regions (appendix). By 2071–100, 
about a third of the population in northern Europe and 
almost all of those in southern Europe could be exposed 
to a weather-related hazard annually (table). In southern 
Europe, this figure might result in about 700 (482–957 
uncertainty range) annual fatalities from weather 
extremes per million inhabitants by 2071–100 compared

the premature mortality rate due to air pollution in 
Europe in 2010 (439 annual deaths per million people) 
and by 2050 (598 annual deaths per million people),30 
which is considered the greatest environmental risk

Demographic trends, such as population growth, 
migration, and urbanisation, are among the most 
important drivers of disaster risk in the past.32 For the 
future, our projections show a minor contribution of 
population growth and distribution to the overall multi-
hazard human risk in Europe, peaking during the 
period 2041–70, with a contribution to rising effects of 
around 10% (figure 1). For certain hazards, and at 
local scales, demographic changes can be of greater 
importance than for Europe as a whole. For example, the 
mean proportion of people living in coastal flood-prone 
areas in Europe is expected to increase by 14% more than 
the total population, with the most notable increases 
in Slovenia (205%), Ireland (192%), Norway (184%), 
Portugal (161%), and the UK (148%; appendix). Further-
more, urbanisation is expected to continue—although at 
slower rates than in recent decades (mean urbanisation 
increase of 0·4% per year up to 2050 [appendix] compared 
with 2·5% per year over the 1970–2000 period33)—leading 
to roughly 50 million (18%) additional city dwellers in 
Europe by 2050. This urbanisation will probably amplify 
heat-induced effects through the urban heat island effect 
(ie, built-up areas absorb and retain heat and are therefore 
hotter than natural land cover).34 The combined effects of 
heatwaves and air pollution35 might further exacerbate 
human stress in densely populated areas. Additionally, 
urbanisation increasingly concentrates the demand for 
water36 and reduces water retention and the infiltration 
capacity of the land surface,37 augmenting the risk of water 
stress and flooding.
Discussion
This study shows that, unless global warming is curbed as 
a matter of urgency and appropriate adaptation measures

vulnerability to weather-related hazards, could provide a 
benchmark for the monitoring of future multihazard 
vulnerability in support of the Lancet Countdown38 to track 
the effects on health of climate hazards.
Although not specifically addressed in this study, certain 
social classes could be more distressed by weather-related 
hazards than others. In particular, the most vulnerable will 
be elderly people and those with diseases (who have 
reduced physiological and behavioural capacity for 
thermoregulation), as well as the poor (who have less access 
to technological means for private disaster stress mitigation 
than do rich people—eg, through air con 
ditioning, thermal 
insulation, or floodproofing of dwellings). Consequently, 
population ageing in Europe, which emerges as a major 
demographic trend for the coming decades (appendix), 
could further increase the effect on human beings of 
weather-related hazards. Conversely, expected advances in 
technology and economic growth will have an opposite 
tendency to reduce vulnerability through improved 
adaptation measures. The net effect of these socioeconomic 
processes remains uncertain. 
The strengths of our study are that our risk estimates 
are based on the two most comprehensive disaster 
databases available and that projections use state-of-the-
art methods. The weakness is the inherent uncertainty in 
the observation data and in the climate and hazard 
projections. The main limitations of the different parts of 
the methods are detailed in the appendix. 
Notwithstanding the fact that our estimates are subject 
to uncertainty, they do highlight important trends. Global 
warming, demographic changes, and urban expansion 
could result in rapidly rising effects of weather-related 
hazards on human beings in Europe if no stringent 
climate mitigation and disaster risk reduction activities are 
implemented. The projections thus advocate fulfil 
ment of 
the key goals of the Paris Agreement39 to limit global 
warming and increase resilience to climate change to 
preserve the health and wellbeing of future generations of 
people in Europe. Land use and city planning can play an 
important role in achievement of a healthy, carbon-neutral, 
and resilient society.40 They offer strategies to curtail energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, such as 
reduction of urban sprawl and automobile dependence, 
and are, in many instances, the most effective tools for 
reduction of the number of human beings exposed and 
their vulnerability to extreme weather events41 (eg, housing 
and building acclimatisation). A systematic approach to 
spatial planning to enhance health and sustainability 
requires strong cooperation across societal sectors and 
institutions, which should be supported by far-sighted 
policy. This approach should be accompanied by awareness 
campaigns, improved early warning systems, and action 
plans tailored to elderly people, deprived groups, and other 
vulnerable groups. The findings of this study could further 
aid in prioritisation of investments to address the unequal 
burden of effects of weather-related hazards and 
differences in adaptation capacities across Europe.
