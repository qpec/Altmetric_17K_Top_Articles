IMPORTANCE Since the discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2, multiple high- and moderate-
penetrance genes have been reported as risk factors for hereditary breast cancer, ovarian
cancer, or both; however, it is unclear whether these findings represent the complete genetic
landscape of these cancers. Systematic investigation of the genetic contributions to
breast and ovarian cancers is needed to confirm these findings and explore potentially
new associations.
OBJECTIVE To confirm reported and identify additional predisposition genes for breast or
ovarian cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this sample of 11 416 patients with clinical features of
breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both who were referred for genetic testing from 1200
hospitals and clinics across the United States and of 3988 controls who were referred for
genetic testing for noncancer conditions between 2014 and 2015, whole-exome sequencing
was conducted and gene-phenotype associations were examined. Case-control analyses
using the Genome Aggregation Database as a set of reference controls were also conducted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Breast cancer risk associated with pathogenic variants
among 625 cancer predisposition genes; association of identified predisposition breast or
ovarian cancer genes with the breast cancer subtypes invasive ductal, invasive lobular,
hormone receptor–positive, hormone receptor–negative, and male, and with
early-onset disease.
RESULTS Of 9639 patients with breast cancer, 3960 (41.1%) were early-onset cases (�45
years at diagnosis) and 123 (1.3%) were male, with men having an older age at diagnosis than
women (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [12.8] vs 48.6 [11.4] years). Of 2051 women with ovarian cancer,
445 (21.7%) received a diagnosis at 45 years or younger. Enrichment of pathogenic variants
were identified in 4 non-BRCA genes associated with breast cancer risk: ATM (odds ratio [OR],
2.97; 95% CI, 1.67-5.68), CHEK2 (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.40-3.56), PALB2 (OR, 5.53; 95% CI,
2.24-17.65), and MSH6 (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.35-5.44). Increased risk for ovarian cancer was
associated with 4 genes: MSH6 (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.95-9.47), RAD51C (OR, not estimable;
false-discovery rate–corrected P = .004), TP53 (OR, 18.50; 95% CI, 2.56-808.10), and ATM
(OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.30-6.32). Neither the MRN complex genes nor CDKN2A was associated
with increased breast or ovarian cancer risk. The findings also do not support previously
reported breast cancer associations with the ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRIP1,
RAD51C, and RAD51D, or mismatch repair genes MSH2 and PMS2.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this large-scale exome sequencing of patients
and controls shed light on both well-established and controversial non-BRCA predisposition
gene associations with breast or ovarian cancer reported to date and may implicate additional
breast or ovarian cancer susceptibility gene candidates involved in DNA repair and genomic
maintenance.

nderstanding the genetic bases for clinical pheno-
types is an important goal of both clinical diagnostics
andbiomedicalresearch.Atleast3%ofallcancercases
are attributed to hereditary variation in cancer predisposi-
tiongenes,1and5%to20%ofbreastcancer(BC)orovariancan-
cer (OV) cases are linked to genetic abnormalities.2,3 In the
1990s, family-based genetic linkage studies identified
2 major BC and OV genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which account
for at least 25% of familial risk,4 implying a more complex
“polygenic” genetic architecture of BC.5 In the past decade,
several more BC and OV susceptibility genes were identified
from large case-control association studies.6-9 Although next-
generation sequencing has enabled rapid screening for new
cancer susceptibility genes, there are currently only 11 well-
characterized BC and OV susceptibility genes (ATM [OMIM
607585],BRCA1[OMIM113705],BRCA2[OMIM600185],BRIP1
[OMIM 605882], CDH1 [OMIM 192090], CHEK2 [OMIM
604373], PALB2 [OMIM 610355], PTEN [OMIM 601728],
RAD51C [OMIM 602774], RAD51D [OMIM 602954], and TP53
[OMIM 191170])10-13 and 6 others (BARD1 [OMIM 601593],
CDKN2A[OMIM600160],NF1[OMIM162200],MRE11A[OMIM
600814], RAD50 [OMIM 604040], and NBN [OMIM
602667])11,14-17 reported to have associations with BC but for
which large-scale robust evidence is lacking (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). A recent study of 65 057 patients with BC re-
ferred for multigene panel testing supports the role of BARD1
but not CDKN2A, NF1, MRE11A, RAD50, or NBN in breast
cancer.18 Moreover, although mismatch repair (MMR) genes
MLH1 (OMIM 120436), MSH2 (OMIM 609309), MSH6 (OMIM
600678), and PMS2 (OMIM 600259) are widely accepted and
treatedclinicallyasOVsusceptibilitygenes,dataregardingtheir
gene-specific contributions to BC or OV risk are limited.
Further investigation of cancer risks associated with less
well-characterized genes is imperative, particularly as multi-
gene panel testing that includes moderate-risk genes are in-
creasingly used in oncology practice.19 Currently, only ap-
proximately 10% to 24% of patients referred for BC or OV risk
assessment with genetic testing are found to harbor known
pathogenic variants identified by multigene panel
testing.11,14,20,21 To determine whether and to what extent
additional cancer genes not currently included in most mul-
tigene panel tests contribute to these risks, we performed
whole-exome sequencing for 11 416 patients with clinical fea-
tures of BC or OV and for 3988 controls. The results have the
potential to add to our understanding of the genomic land-
scape of BC and OV predisposition and to inform comprehen-
sive genetic testing in the context of patient care.
Methods
Samples
Thestudyparticipantscomprised11 416unrelatedpatientswith
BC, OV, or both referred for genetic testing from 1200 hospi-
tals and clinics across the United States between 2014 and 2015
(Table 1; eTable 2 in the Supplement). The in-laboratory con-
trols consisted of 3988 unrelated patients referred for genetic
testing for noncancer conditions: 445 patients (11.1%) with
cystic fibrosis, 1766 patients (44.3%) with rare inherited car-
diovascular conditions, and 1777 reportedly healthy parents
of children with epilepsy, congenital anomalies, autism, or
psychiatric disorders (44.6%) enrolled in our clinical exome
sequencing program. Patients with self-reported personal
history of cancer were not included in the in-laboratory con-
trol group. Demographic, clinical history, and family history
information were collected from documents provided by the
ordering clinicians. A consistent set of protocols pertaining
to exome library construction, exome capture, sequencing
platform, and bioinformatics pipeline (eAppendix in the
Supplement) was applied to all case and control samples to
eliminate potential biases associated with differences in se-
quencing platforms and to enable further filtration of arti-
facts in cancers when compared with a reference population,
the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (eAppendix in
the Supplement). This study was submitted to the Solutions
Institutional Review Board (Little Rock, Arkansas) and was
deemed exempt from review. In addition, this board waived
the need for informed patient consent because all data used
were from previously existing, deidentified samples gath-
ered for the purpose of research.
Statistical Analysis
After data cleaning and filtering (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment), we collapsed pathogenic variants (loss of function and
known pathogenic22) by gene and performed burden tests for
625 cancer genes (eAppendix, eTable 1, and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement) among 9639 BC and 2051 OV cases vs 3988 in-
laboratory controls. We excluded truncations located beyond
the last 55 base pairs of the penultimate exon and not resid-
ing in functional domains (and thus may not be influenced by
nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay).18,23 We also ex-
amined the distribution of pathogenic variants in 11 charac-
terizedBCorOVgenes(eAppendixandeFigure2intheSupple-
ment). Although the coverage of our sequencing data was
comparabletothatforthegnomADdatabase,weexcludedsites
with 10× coverage (per-site sequencing depth) or less in
gnomAD or a missing rate of 30% or more at 10× coverage,
which avoided inflation of signals in either direction.
For both case vs in-laboratory control comparisons and
case vs gnomAD comparisons (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supple-
ment), we used the cohort allelic sums test,24 a burden test
Key Points
Question Which non-BRCA genes are associated with breast or
ovarian cancer and what are the magnitudes of those risks?
Findings In this study assessing whole-exome sequencing results
from 11 416 patients with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both and
3988 controls, an increased risk of breast cancer was associated
with PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, and MSH6 genes, whereas MSH6,
RAD51C, TP53, and ATM genes were associated with an increased
risk of ovarian cancer.
Meaning In addition to confirming several well-known breast or
ovarian cancer gene associations, this study identified MSH6 and
ATM as possible moderate-risk breast and ovarian cancer
predisposition genes, respectively.

 widely used for association analysis of rare variants.10,25-27
Odds ratios (ORs) and 2-sided P values were computed using
the Fisher exact test, followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg
false-discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction. An
FDR-corrected P < .05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. For genes with variants observed in cases but absent in
controls, ORs could not be estimated. Genes with 2 or fewer
detectable pathogenic variants were excluded. Suspected
pathogenic variants in BC- or OV-associated genes were re-
viewed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
To assess the contribution of candidate genes to specific
clinical features of BC or OV, we tested their associations with
breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, we performed 5 sensitiv-
ity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings and
2 case-case analyses to explore genetic associations with
these clinical features (eTables 5-11 and eAppendix in the
Supplement). Pathogenic variants carried by cases and
in-laboratory controls are given in eTables 12 through 14 in the
Supplement. All statistical analyses were conducted using R,
version 3.3.3.

Patient Characteristics
The overall racial/ethnic distribution for 11 416 patients with
BC, OV, or both is shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Of
9639 patients with BC (Table 1), 3960 (41.1%) were early-
onset cases (diagnosis age ≤45 years) and 123 (1.3%) were male,
with men having an older age at diagnosis than women (mean
[SD] age, 61.8 [12.8] vs 48.6 [11.4] years). In addition, 1321 pa-
tients (13.7%) had bilateral or multiple BC, with age at first on-
set similar to the diagnosis age for patients with 1 BC (mean
[SD]age,49.0[10.7]vs48.7[11.6]years),and641patients(6.6%)
had additional cancer primaries. Of 2015 patients with OV, 445
(21.7%) received a diagnosis at 45 years or younger.
Most patients with BC (6829 [70.8%]) had invasive ductal
breastcancer(IDC)(Table1).Invasivelobularbreastcancer(ILC)
was less common (493 patients [5.1%]) and developed in pa-
tients at a slightly older age than those with IDC or other histo-
logic types of BC. Of the 4447 patients with BC who also had in-
formationontumorpathologicfeatures(46.1%)(eTable2inthe
Supplement), 2476 (55.7%) were hormone (estrogen and pro-
gesterone) receptor–positive, 278 (6.3%) were human epider-
mal growth factor receptor–positive but hormone receptor–
negative, 539 (12.1%) were triple-positive (TPBC), and 1154
(26.0%) were triple-negative (TNBC). The mean [SD] age of pa-
tientswhowereTPBC(45.3[10.7]years)andhormonereceptor–
negative (45.4 [10.9] years) was less than that of patients who
were TNBC (48.8 [11.1] years) and hormone receptor–positive
(50.1 [11.6] years). Demographics and BC-associated gene
frequencies for patients with BC without pathology informa-
tion were similar to those described above.
In addition, 8152 patients with BC (84.6%) and 1670 pa-
tients with OV (81.4%) had a family history of cancer (Table 1).
Also, 2060 patients with BC or OV (18.0%) provided informa-
tion on BRCA1/2 testing prior to exome sequencing in our labo-
ratory, of whom 2034 (98.7%) had received a negative result.
Thus, the cases described in this report are enriched for
noncarriers of the deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations, which re-
sulted in underestimation of risks for BRCA1/2 genes.
The 3988 in-laboratory controls were younger than the pa-
tients with BC or OV at the time of testing (mean [SD] age, 39.7
[14.7] vs 50.9 [14.8] years). Although the racial/ethnic distri-
bution among controls was somewhat similar to that of cases,
the proportion of white individuals was slightly lower among
controlsandtheproportionofHispanicindividualswasslightly
higher among controls (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes
We identified 4 genes that confer significantly increased BC
risk(Table2andeTable3intheSupplement),includinganewly
identified BC association with the Lynch syndrome28 suscep-
tibility gene MSH6. Our findings were supported by compari-
son with the gnomAD database as a reference population, in
whichall4geneswerepresentandsignificantlyassociatedwith
similar or higher estimated risks (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). For both comparisons, PALB2 was associated with high
BC risk, consistent with other studies,10,18 whereas ATM and
CHEK2 conferred 2- to 3-fold risks, also consistent with prior
reports.10,18 The CHEK2 founder mutation c.1100delC was
enriched among mutation carriers (eTable 14 in the Supple-
ment) and was significantly associated with BC risk (OR,
4.00; 95% CI, 2.04-8.73; uncorrected P = 2.66 × 10−6,
FDR-corrected P = .003). Without this variant, the association

 between CHEK2 and BC was substantially attenuated and non-
significant(allothervariantscombined:OR,1.42;95%CI,0.76-
2.81, uncorrected P = .32). Although TP53 is known to confer
risk for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, our findings indicated that
TP53 might confer moderate to high risk for BC at marginal sig-
nificance (eTable 3 in the Supplement), in agreement with a
recent report.29 The MMR gene MSH6 was associated with
moderate BC risk, even after excluding 981 BC cases (Table 1)
with first- and second-degree OV-affected relatives (eTable 7
in the Supplement). The MSH6 mutation c.2945delC, en-
riched in MSH6 mutation carriers (eTable 14 in the Supple-
ment), primarily accounted for the observed association
(c.2945delC variant-specific OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.22-7.18,
uncorrected P = .009 vs all other variants combined OR, 2.21;
95% CI, 0.74-8.89, uncorrected P = .18). Increased risks were
observed for 4 genes among white individuals (eTable 4 in the
Supplement) and women (eTable 6 in the Supplement),
although power was diminished for these stratified analyses.
No significant BC associations were observed with BARD1,
NF1, or PTEN after correction for multiple tests (all FDR-
correctedP > .10).Moreover,theMMRgenesMLH1,MSH2,and

OV susceptibility genes BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D, and the
melanoma predisposition gene CDKN2A did not significantly
increase BC risk (all FDR-corrected P > .20). No increased BC
risk was observed for CDH1 (FDR-corrected P = .99) given its
primaryassociationwithILC30andtheenrichmentofIDCcases
in the present study (Table 1).
We also identified roles for high- and moderate-risk BC
genes in disease pathology (Table 3). The PALB2 mutations
were associated with greater than 5-fold risks of IDC, hor-
mone receptor–positive BC, TPBC, TNBC, and male BC (MBC);
association with TNBC has been previously noted.31 The ATM
and CHEK2 genes conferred moderate IDC, ILC, and hor-
mone receptor–positive risks; CHEK2 was also associated with
moderate TPBC risk. The MSH6 gene was more closely asso-
ciated with ILC than with IDC. Moreover ATM, CHEK2, MSH6,
and PALB2 were associated with early-onset BC with similar
or higher risks than those estimated for overall breast cancer.
In the case-case analyses of BC clinical features, ATM
and CHEK2 mutations were enriched among estrogen-
progesterone–positive patients compared with estrogen-
progesterone–negative patients (eTable 10 in the Supple-
ment); CHEK2 may contribute to early onset of BC compared
with an onset age of at least 45 years (eTable 11 in the
Supplement).
Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Genes
Four genes were significantly associated with increased OV
risks in both case vs in-laboratory control and case vs
gnomAD comparisons (eTable 3 in the Supplement). We con-
firmed associations with known OV susceptibility genes
RAD51C (OR, not estimable; FDR-corrected P = .004) and TP53
(OR, 18.50; 95% CI, 2.56-808.10). An OR for RAD51C could not
be estimated because of the absence of pathogenic variants
among in-laboratory controls; however, RAD51C was associ-
ated with high OV risk in the comparison with gnomAD, in
agreement with previous reports.32,33 Ovarian cancer risks as-
sociated with MSH6 or ATM or both have only recently been
estimated.29,34,35 We observed moderately increased OV risk
associated with MSH6 (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.95-9.47) and ATM
(OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.30-6.32). However, BRIP1, RAD51D,
CDKN2A, and the MRN complex genes MRE11A, RAD50, and
NBN were not significantly associated with elevated OV risk.
All 4 genes increased OV risks among white individuals
(eTable 4 in the Supplement) and among women (eTable 6 in
the Supplement); 1 gene, MSH6, was significantly associated
with early-onset OV (Table 3).
Discussion
We undertook large-scale whole-exome sequencing of 15 404
patientsreferredforgenetictestingtoprovidenewinsightsinto
predisposition genes for breast and ovarian cancers. Owing to
the lack of significantly powered studies, the number and se-
lectionofriskgenesforhereditarycancertestinghavenotbeen
standardized,36 and robust evidence for association with BC
or OV risk is only available for a modest set of characterized
genes typically included in most panels.10,11 This is particu-
larly the case for moderate-penetrance genes, for which there
exists either conflicting evidence or insufficient data for
reliable estimation.14
Many of our findings regarding the known BC or OV or
both susceptibility genes are consistent with the literature
reported to date.10,11,14,18 However, some anticipated associa-

 tions were not observed and other associations were newly
identified in this study of case patients and controls.
Moreover, we were able to examine associations with clinical
features of breast cancer and found that ATM and CHEK2
carriers were more likely to have estrogen-progesterone
receptor–positive disease than estrogen-progesterone
receptor–negative disease, a finding partially supported by a
previous study examining the CHEK2 association with estro-
gen receptor–positive breast cancer.37 The role of PALB2 as a
high penetrance BC gene has been established,10,18 but
evidence for its association with OV is mixed.13,34 Consistent
with Ramus et al,13 we did not observe elevated OV risk
associated with PALB2 (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.5-9.1; P = .31). We
also observed increase risk for multiple breast cancer sub-
types associated with PALB2, including MBC, for which prior
evidence is scant.31 The RAD51C gene conferred OV but not BC
risk, in agreement with previous reports indicating that it may
be a high penetrance OV32,33 but not BC gene.2,10 Likewise,
RAD51D was recently reported to increase BC risk18; however,
we and others observed no such association.12 Moreover, we
and others18,38 failed to find any association of BRIP1 with BC.
The MMR genes MSH2 and PMS2 were also not associated
with increased BC risk, in agreement with recent findings.18
Despite earlier reports15-17 of BC and OV associations with
MRN complex genes and CDKN2A, we and others29 did not
observe higher BC or OV risk associated with those genes.
We also identified BC and OV associations with additional
genes involved in genomic stability pathways. Protein kinase
producedbyATM,ageneknowntobeassociatedwithBC,plays
a crucial role in the early stages of homologous recombination
and regulation of cell cycle checkpoints.39 However, prior
evidence linking ATM and OV is limited. In both comparisons
with in-laboratory and gnomAD controls, among all partici-
pantsorasubsetofwhiteindividuals,weobserveda2-to3-fold
increasedriskofOVassociatedwithATM,witheffectsizessimi-
lartoorslightlyhigherthanthoseinrecentobservations.29,34,35
The well-characterized MMR complex also has a role in main-
taining genomic stability, repairing small genomic alterations
and ensuring error-free homologous recombination repair.
Mutations in MMR genes have been shown to increase suscep-
tibility to BC, OV, or both,39 although evidence to date regard-
ing MSH6 is inconsistent. Whereas some studies have failed to
observe significantly increased BC or OV risks associated with
MSH6,28,39 others have reported it to be an OV susceptibility
gene.40,41 Our data suggest that MSH6 has a strong significant
association with OV. We also observed modestly increased risk
for BC, early-onset BC, and the ILC subtype associated with
MSH6, in agreement with a small prior study that reported BC
association but failed to identify the MSH6 pathogenic
variants.42 Our findings support MSH6 as a weak BC suscepti-
bility gene.18 These 2 associations were confirmed in multiple
sensitivity analyses, including comparisons with gnomAD and
analyses among white individuals and women.
Limitations and Strengths
Although many of our findings are supported by the litera-
ture, there are some limitations to the present study. First, we
had incomplete information on the personal disease history
of the in-laboratory controls and cannot rule out the possibil-
ity that some individuals may have been affected with BC or
OV. The same issue underlies the use of Exome Aggregation
Consortium and gnomAD data sets, particularly because
approximately 6% of the gnomAD samples were from The
Cancer Genome Atlas. However, analysis of affected controls
wouldresultinabiastowardnullandimpliesthatthetruerisks
are greater than what we reported here. Second, we based our
analysis on the aggregation of both protein truncating and
known pathogenic variants, which could result in underesti-
mation of risk for less-studied genes. Third, information on
hormone receptor status was available for only approxi-
mately46%ofcases.Althoughpowerwasdiminishedforthese
analyses because of the reduced sample size, inferences were
unlikely to have selection bias because demographics and mu-
tationfrequenciesofcaseswithorwithoutpathologydatawere
comparable (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Last, our study was
composed of patients referred for genetic testing and may
therefore be enriched for individuals with early-onset BC or
OV, bilateral and TNBC, Lynch syndrome–associated cancers,
and a family history of BC, OV, or other cancers. We showed
that BC associations persisted despite exclusion of cases with
Lynch syndrome and other cancers and exclusion of cases with
close relatives affected with OV. Although the enrichment of
personal and family histories for patients with BC may have
afforded us an opportunity to identify new associations, par-
ticularly those of moderate risk, these characteristics should
be considered when generalizing our study findings.
Despite these limitations, our study had several strengths.
As a clinical diagnostic laboratory processing hundreds of
thousands of samples annually, we were able to generate high-
quality and high-sensitivity next-generation sequencing re-
sults (eFigures 3-5 in the Supplement) linked to detailed pa-
tientphenotype,personalandfamilyhistory,anddemographic
information. The high resolution of sequencing data using a
large sample of patients and controls enabled us to identify
novel associations of BC and OV with susceptibility genes in
addition to providing evidence for reported but unconfirmed
associations. Although other large studies relying solely on the
use of publicly available reference data sets13,31,34 are suscep-
tible to bias when estimating genetic risks because of system-
atic differences in sequencing methods among cases and
controls,43,44 we uniformly sequenced and analyzed cases and
controls with the same technology and in the same labora-
tory to avoid this bias. We were then able to support our
results by comparisons with the gnomAD database, while re-
quiring 10× minimum site coverage to avoid inflation of esti-
mates due to no or low coverage. Moreover, suspected patho-
genic variants in the associated genes were subsequently
confirmed by Sanger sequencing, eliminating the false-
positives that are commonly present in next-generation
sequencing results.45
Conclusions
Our findings in a large sample of patients referred for
genetic testing confirmed several known or suspected

genes involved in genomic maintenance. These results,
therefore, have the potential to serve as the foundation for
future epidemiologic, clinical, or functional studies of BC
