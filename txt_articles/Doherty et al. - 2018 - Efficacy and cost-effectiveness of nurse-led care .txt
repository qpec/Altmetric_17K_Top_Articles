Summary
Background In the UK, gout management is suboptimum, with only 40% of patients receiving urate-lowering therapy, 
usually without titration to achieve a target serum urate concentration. Nurses successfully manage many diseases in 
primary care. We compared nurse-led gout care to usual care led by general practitioners (GPs) for people in the 
community.
Methods Research nurses were trained in best practice management of gout, including providing individualised 
information and engaging patients in shared decision making. Adults who had experienced a gout flare in the 
previous 12 months were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive nurse-led care or continue with GP-led usual care. We 
assessed patients at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants who 
achieved serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL) at 2 years. Secondary outcomes were flare 
frequency in year 2, presence of tophi, quality of life, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Risk ratios 
(RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated based on intention to treat with multiple imputation. This study is registered with 
www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01477346.
Findings 517 patients were enrolled, of whom 255 were assigned nurse-led care and 262 usual care. Nurse-led care was 
associated with high uptake of and adherence to urate-lowering therapy. More patients receiving nurse-led care had 
serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L at 2 years than those receiving usual care (95% vs 30%, RR 3∙18, 
95% CI 2∙42–4∙18, p<0∙0001). At 2 years all secondary outcomes favoured the nurse-led group. The cost per QALY 
gained for the nurse-led intervention was £5066 at 2 years.
Interpretation Nurse-led gout care is efficacious and cost-effective compared with usual care. Our findings illustrate 
the benefits of educating and engaging patients in gout management and reaffirm the importance of a treat-to-target 
urate-lowering treatment strategy to improve patient-centred outcomes.

Introduction
Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis 
worldwide, and in the UK the prevalence has risen from 
1∙5% in 1997 to 2∙5% in 2012.1 Gout results from sodium 
urate crystals that form when serum urate persistently 
exceeds saturation.2 Deposition of sodium urate crystals 
can cause extremely painful gout flares or attacks, joint 
damage, and subcutaneous nodules (tophi). Furthermore, 
gout and hyperuricaemia are associated with various 
comor 
bidities,3 increased mortality,4 and reduced quality 
of life.5 The causes of hyperuricaemia are known, and 
urate-lowering treatments can maintain serum urate 
concentrations at less than saturation, which prevents 
crystal formation and dissolves existing crystals, making 
gout the only common arthritis where the pathogenic 
agent can be eliminated. Addressing risk factors for 
hyperuricaemia (eg, overweight, excessive alcohol intake, 
high dietary intake of purines and fructose) is advised as 
well as medical treatment, but alone rarely reduces 
concentrations of serum urate sufficiently to alter the 
disease course.6,7
Despite good understanding of the disease and the 
availability of curative treatment, gout care remains 
suboptimum.1,8 In the UK, gout is managed predom-
inantly in primary care by general practitioners (GPs), 
but less than half of patients receive urate-lowering 
therapy.1,9 In those who do, the dose is usually fixed 
without titration to achieve a target serum urate 
concentration9 and adherence is poor.10,11 Common 
misconceptions about gout (eg, that it is not a serious 
condition and that it is self-induced by lifestyle) are 
important barriers to care8,12 and, therefore, education of

patients is central to management.7,13 Unfortunately, 
some physicians share these misconceptions12 and many, 
because of factors such as work pressures, might have 
insufficient time to educate patients adequately.
In the UK, community-based nurses manage many 
chronic conditions, and in randomised controlled trials 
nurse-led care has been similar or superior to physician 
care.14 We did a proof-of-concept study involving 106 gout 
patients.15 When the patients were fully informed and 
involved in decision making, all wanted urate-lowering 
therapy and, after 1 year of nurse-led care, 92% had serum 
urate concentrations within the target range (<360 µmol/L 
[6 mg/dL]), which we based on national and international 
guidelines and recommendations,7,13,16 and had started to 
show improvements in patient-centred outcomes. Our 
find 
ings prompted us to do a randomised controlled trial 
in primary care over a period long enough to show 
improvements in patient-centred outcomes. The object-
ives were to compare the efficacy, including patient-
centred outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led 
care, reflecting recommended best practice, with usual 
GP-led care of patients with gout over 2 years.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a parallel arm, non-blinded randomised con-
trolled trial in 56 East Midlands general practices that 
represented urban and rural settings around the 
Nottingham area. Each practice sent a questionnaire to 
adults (age >21 years) on their database who had a 
diagnosis of gout. Respondents who reported at least 
one gout flare in the previous 12 months and indicated 
willingness for further contact were sent information 
on the study which explained that nurses successfully 
manage many long-term conditions in primary care and 
that the aim of the trial was to assess how well gout 
would be managed over a 2-year period by specially 
trained nurses compared with GPs. Patients who were 
interested in participating returned a reply slip and 
were telephoned to ensure they fulfilled 1977 American 
College of Rheumatology gout classification criteria.17 
Eligible patients were assessed in their GP surgery by a 
research nurse. Placement of a study advertisement in 
two Nottinghamshire news 
papers was added to the 
study protocol as a further recruitment approach. People 
who responded to these advertisements were sent the 
questionnaire and those willing to participate underwent 
telephone screening and assess 
ment in their homes. 
Exclusion criteria were not meeting the 1977 American 
College of Rheumatology gout classification criteria, 
inability to consent, and terminal or severe illness. After 
a protocol amendment, financial incentives were offered 
to unresponsive patients in the usual-care group in 
return for completing the questionnaire and attending 
the assessment at the end of year 2.
The study was approved by East Midlands Nottingham 
Research Ethics Committee (12/EM/0044). The University 
of Nottingham was the study sponsor (reference 11115). 
The study protocol, including amendments following 
commencement of the study, and the statistical analysis 
plan, are available online. All participants gave written 
informed consent.
Randomisation
A randomisation schedule was created centrally by the 
Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, with a secure web-based 
system. Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive nurse-led care 
or GP-led usual care in randomly permuted blocks of two, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Despite increasing prevalence of gout in the UK, various barriers 
prevent patients from receiving optimum care. Only 40% of 
gout patients receive urate-lowering therapy that is usually 
given at a fixed dose without titration to achieve a target serum 
urate concentration, and adherence is poor. In a search done for 
a previous proof-of-concept study, we found no long-term 
randomised controlled trials that had assessed recommended 
best practice management of gout in a primary care setting. 
The proof-of-concept study showed that when people with 
gout are fully informed and involved in management decisions, 
uptake of urate-lowering therapy is high and adherence under 
nurse-led care is excellent. The findings led to a 2-year 
randomised controlled community trial to compare directly 
nurse-led care and usual care led by general practitioners (GPs).
Added value of this study
Nurse-led care, including providing patients with individualised 
information and engaging them with care, along with a 
strategy of treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy, resulted in 
very high treatment uptake and adherence. Patient-centred 
outcomes, such as flare frequency, tophi, and quality of life were 
substantially improved. Adherence was 95% at 2 years, which is 
greater than in any previously reported clinical studies of gout. 
We also found that the allopurinol doses needed to achieve 
target serum urate concentrations were greater than the upper 
dose of 300 mg/day used by most UK GPs. The nurse-led 
approach was cost-effective in the short-term and would 
potentially be cost saving in the long-term.
Implications of all the available evidence
Individualised education and engagement of patients and a 
treat-to-target strategy are important elements in successful 
management of gout. The management principles are 
potentially generalisable to any health professionals who 
manage people with gout. These findings add to the evidence 
that refutes the American College of Physicians advice, which 
seems to ignore patients’ involvement in deciding whether 
urate-lowering therapy should be used, and, when it is used, 
to not treat to a target serum urate concentration.

four, or six, stratified by the clinical commissioning groups 
to which the general practices belonged (n=26). To enrol a 
patient in the study, a research nurse telephoned the trial 
coordination office in Academic Rheumatology, University 
of Nottingham, where a researcher accessed the online 
system to ascertain the next treatment allocation, which 
was given to the nurse during the telephone call. Patients 
were told their allocation by the nurse and their GP was 
informed by letter.
Intervention
Nurses received training about gout and its management 
that reflected national and international recommen-
dations and was developed from qualitative research on 
illness perceptions12 and determination of the key 
elements to explaining gout that we had established in 
our previous proof-of-concept study (appendix).15 As 
part of an individualised package of care, the nurses 
provided patients with holistic assessment, discussion 
of illness perceptions, and full information on gout 
(nature, causes, associations, consequences, and treat-
ment options), and encouraged them to share in decision 
making.13 Patients were given the Arthritis Research UK 
gout information booklet. Follow-up assessments and 
measurement of serum urate concentrations were done 
as often as required by the nurse. Telephone contact (eg 
to review serum urate results) could be substituted for 
face-to-face visits, and home visits were permitted (eg for 
older patients). Urate-lowering therapy was obtained 
from Nottingham City Hospital Pharmacy. As recom-
mended,7,13 first-line treatment was oral allopurinol, 
started at 100 mg once per day and titrated upwards in 
100 mg increments every 3–4 weeks according to serum 
urate concentrations, to a maximum of 900 mg once 
per day. As second-line options, oral febuxostat could be 
started at 80 mg and if required increased to the maxi-
mum dose of 120 mg once per day or benzbromarone 
could be started at 50 mg and titrated up in 50 mg 
increments to a maximum of 200 mg once per day. 
Combination urate-lowering therapy (xanthine oxidase 
inhibitor plus uricosuric) could be used as the final 
treatment option. Colchicine as prophylaxis against gout 
flares could be considered. If the nurses had questions 
about gout management, they could seek advice from a 
study rheumatologist (MD, FR, or AA). All contacts with 
participants were logged.
Patients assigned to continue usual GP-led care 
were given the gout information booklet from Arthritis 
Research UK. Treatment of flares could be discussed 
by the research nurse at baseline and at yearly assess-
ments, but if participants enquired about other aspects of 
management they were advised to ask their GP.

quality of life (measured with the Short Form [36 item] 
general Health questionnaire [SF-36]18 and the Gout 
Assessment Questionnaire, which includes the Gout 
Impact Scale disease-specific quality of life measure).19 We 
also assessed patients by clinical examination at baseline 
to measure body-mass index and subcutaneous tophi 
(number, sites, and maximum diameter of the largest 
tophus measured with a Vernier caliper) and did blood 
tests to measure serum urate concentration and creatinine 
concentration to estimate glomerular filtration rate. 
Patients in both study groups were given diaries in 
which to record flares.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the percentage of patients 
who had achieved serum urate concentrations less than 
360 µmol/L at 2 years. Secondary outcomes were other 
serum urate measures (percentage of patients who had 
achieved serum urate concentrations <360 µmol/L at 
1 year, <300 µmol/L at 1 and 2 years, and group mean 
serum urate concentrations at 1 and 2 years); frequency 
of gout flares during years 1 and 2; the percentage of 
patients with tophi overall; the median number of tophi 
and the maximum diameter of the largest tophus at 1 
and 2 years among patients with tophi at baseline; 
quality of life (physical and mental components) and 
Gout Impact Scale at 1 and 2 years; and cost-
effectiveness, calculated as cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained.  
Statistical analysis
We initially calculated that an overall sample size of 
724 patients would be needed to show a difference in 
quality of life between groups in this trial based on two 
Nottingham observational studies.20,21 After we obtained 
data from our proof-of-concept study15 we revised the 
sample size estimate. For 90% power at a significance 
level of 0·05 (two-tailed), the sample size needed was 20 to 
show a difference in the percentage of patients achieving

serum urate concen 
trations less than 360 μmol/L (92% vs 
13%),15 166 to assess a difference in the frequency of acute 
flares (mean difference 2∙4 [SD 2∙3]),15 and 648 to assess a 
difference in quality of life (mean difference 0∙74 
[SD 2∙9]).21 Owing to recruitment being slower than 
expected, we reduced the power to 80% at a significance 
level of 0·05 (two-tailed), changing the required sample 
sizes to 16, 124, and 486, respectively. Thus, we aimed to 
recruit 512 patients, allowing for 10% dropout over 2 years.
We compared groups at baseline and after 1 and 
2 years by intention to treat with multiple imputation, 
assuming that data were missing at random. A Markov 
chain Monte Carlo method was used to impute missing 
continuous data, and a fully conditional specification 
model was used to impute missing dichotomous or 
categorical data. Missing values were imputed within 
each group with adjustment for the baseline level of the 
imputed variable, serum urate concentration, use of 
urate-lowering treatment, age, and number of flares. 
We did a per-protocol analysis involving patients who 
completed 2 years of treatment to test sensitivity.
We used ANCOVA to analyse continuous variables 
(between-group comparisons and tests for linear trend). 
Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CIs were calculated for 
dichotomous data with Poisson regression. We adjusted 
all analyses for the baseline level of the outcome 
assessed. A repeated-measures analysis was used to 
assess linear trends for effect of time from baseline to 
1 year and 2 years. We used the GLM procedure in SAS 
(version 9.4) with three time points (baseline, 1 year, and 
2 years) to handle multilevel data and to adjust for cluster 
effects within individuals. 
The cost-effectiveness analysis was done with a 
National Health Service perspective and a lifetime 
horizon. A state transition model was constructed based 
on four serum urate concentration ranges (<360 µmol/L, 
≥360 to <480 µmol/L, ≥480 to <600 µmol/L, and 
≥600 µmol/L). To reduce stochasticity in the model we 
assumed that the flare rates per range of serum urate 
concentrations would be constant within each of the 
periods 0–6 months, 7–12 months, and 13–24 months. 
These values were calculated as the number of flares 
divided by the number of patient-months of follow-up 
during a period. Beyond 24 months we assumed that the 
flare rates per range of serum urate concentration would 
be independent of initial management and set the values 
to the aver 
age nurse-led and usual-care values between 
12 and 24 months.
The cost of the management of gout flares was 
estimated according to the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) review of treatment 
with pegloticase.22 We did a sensitivity analyses in which 
we lowered the cost per flare (from £341 to £50) and 
added nurse time for reviewing patients (an extra 30 min 
per 6 months) in years 3 and 4 (appendix). We also did a 
post-hoc analysis that made pessimistic assumptions 
regarding the efficacy of the nurse-led approach, in 
which the flare rates were increased by 20% in the first 
2 years and the split of patients across the serum urate 
concentration ranges at the end of year 2 was altered 
(appendix). The model was simplistic and typically 
unfavour 
able to the nurse-led treatment, for example, it 
ignored the effects of tophi, assumed that longer-term 
flare rates within each serum urate concentration band 
are independent of treatment strategy, and that crystals 
did not dissolve in patients with serum urate con-
centrations maintained below 360 µmol/L. Finally, we 
did a post-hoc comparison of participants with renal 
impairment (defined as chronic kidney disease stage 3

Results
Of 6806 questionnaires sent to patients by GP practices, 
2815 (41%) were returned (figure 1). 1605 (57%) of 
2815 respondents reported having had gout flares in the 
previous year, among whom 1071 were willing to be 
contacted further. Of these, 524 were screened and 
505 were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Of the 
48 people who responded to the advertisement, 12 were 
screened and randomised (figure 1). The first participant 
entered the study on March 21, 2013, and follow-up of the 
last participant finished on Oct 25, 2016.
Patients’ characteristics did not differ significantly 
at baseline (table 1). Most were middle-aged white 
men, mean gout duration was 12 years, and 11% of patients 
had tophi at baseline. 203 (39%) were taking urate-lowering 
therapy at baseline, of whom 202 were taking allopurinol. 
The mean dose at baseline was 227 mg/day (SD 101) and 
only seven (7%) patients were taking more than 
300 mg/day. Only around 20% of patients had serum urate 
concentration less than 360 μmol/L.
Of 517 patients who started the study, 482 (93%) 
completed 1 year and 441 (85%) completed 2 years 
(figure 1). A comparison of patients who did and did not 
remain in the study is shown in the appendix. Retention 
was higher in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care 
group (20 vs 46 completed the study, p<0∙0001). 
Two patients in the nurse-led group and eight in the 
usual-care group died (p=0∙0611; figure 1). There were no 
significant differences between groups in changes of 
body-mass index or renal function during the study 
(appendix).
At 2 years, multiple imputation showed that 95% of 
participants in the nurse-led group had achieved serum 
urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L compared 
with 30% in the usual care group (RR 3∙18, 95% CI 
2∙42–4∙18, table 2). A similar difference was seen after 
1 year (table 2). Concentrations less than 300 μmol/L at 
2 years had been achieved in 88% of patients receiving 
nurse-led care, compared with 17% in the usual-care 
group (p<0∙0001). The mean serum urate concentrations 
in the nurse-led group were significantly lower than 
those in the usual-care group after 1 and 2 years (table 3, 
figures 2, 3). The differences between groups at 1 and 
2 years reflect a mean decrease of 183 μmol/L in the first 
3 months of treatment in the nurse-led group that 
was sustained compared with reductions of around 
10 μmol/L achieved by each of years 1 and 2 in the usual-
care group.
Use of urate-lowering therapy increased in both groups 
but was significantly higher in the nurse-led group than 
in the usual-care group at 1 and 2 years (table 2). In the 
nurse-led group, based on multiple imputations, 97% 
and 96% of patients were taking urate-lowering therapy 
at 1 year and 2 years, respectively, compared with 47% 
and 56%, respectively, in the usual-care group. Most 
patients were taking allopurinol (84% vs 96%). Doses of 
allo 
purinol were greater than 300 mg/day in 80% patients 
in the nurse-led group at 1 year and in 79% at 2 years, 
compared with 11% and 10%, respectively, in the usual-
care group (appendix). The mean dose at 2 years in 
the nurse-led group was 460 mg/day compared with 
230 mg/day in the usual-care group. Among the patients 
taking other urate-lowering therapy, febuxostat was being 
taken by more patients in the nurse-led group than in the 
usual-care group at 2 years (14% vs 3%). Only four 
patients in the nurse-led group and one in the usual-care 
group were receiving uricosurics at 2 years and none 
required combination urate-lowering therapy. Only three 
partici 
pants in the nurse-led group elected to receive 
colchicine prophylaxis against gout during the titration 
phase of urate-lowering therapy.
In the nurse-led group 24 (10%) patients discontinued 
urate-lowering therapy, among whom 12 did so due to 
one or more side-effects (rash or pruritus n=4; reduced 
estimated glomerular filtration rate n=4; gastrointestinal 
upset n=2; arthralgia n=2; systemic upset, including 
fatigue and sweating n=2; reduced libido n=1; and breast 
tenderness, flushes, and cramps n=1) and the remainder

treatment (n=8), no response to urate-lowering therapy 
after titration (n=3), and cessation during chemotherapy 
(n=1). All side-effects resolved within 1 week of stopping 
treatment. All 24 patients wished to receive an alternative 
urate-lowering regimen and were successfully taking 
treatment by the end of year 1, including two patients 
who had second regimen changes.
Equivalent surveillance and monitoring of side-effects 
were not available in the usual care group. Two (1%) 
participants reported side-effects attributed to allopurinol 
that led to discontinuation, and neither was started on 
another urate-lowering regimen. A post-hoc comparison 
of patients with and without renal impairment in the 
nurse-led group showed no difference after 2 years 
among those taking urate-lowering therapy (50 [94%] of 
58 with renal impairment vs 171 [97%] of 191 without 
renal impairment), those achieving serum urate con-
centrations less than 360 μmol/L (50 [94%] vs 168 [95%]) 
or less than 300 μmol/L (46 [87%] vs 156 [89%]), or those 
who had had side-effects associated with allopurinol 
(eight [14%] vs 15 [8%]). 
Flare frequency reduced gradually from baseline to 
2 years in both groups (p<0∙0001 for trend, table 2, 
figure 3). The risk of having two or more flares per year 
was higher in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care 
group at 1 year but had become much lower after 2 years 
(table 2). A similar pattern was observed for risk of 
four or more flares (table 2).
The risk of having any tophi was similar in the 
two treatment groups at baseline, but number of patients 
with tophi reduced from 35 (14%) at baseline to six (3%) 
at 2 years in the nurse-led group, whereas no change 
was seen in the usual-care group (table 2, figure 3). The 
median number of tophi fell in the nurse-led group 
(p<0∙0010 for trend, table 3) and at years 1 and 2 the 
numbers of tophi were lower than in the usual-care 
group (p<0∙0001 and p=0·0090, respectively; table 3). 
The mean diameter of the largest tophus was significantly 
smaller among patients in the nurse-led group than 
among those in the usual-care group at years 1 and 2 
(table 3).
In a post-hoc per-protocol analysis, the relationship 
between serum urate concentrations and clinical out-
comes was assessed in tertiles of serum urate con-
centrations at 2 years in all patients who completed  the 
study (lowest <247 μmol/L, middle 248–365 μmol/L, and 
highest >365 μmol/L). The percentages of participants 
experiencing flares during year 2 were 7%, 10%, and 29%, 
respectively, for two or more (p<0∙0001 for trend) and 1%, 
3%, and 14%, respectively, for four or more (p<0∙0001 for 
trend), and the percentages of patients with tophi at the 
end of year 2 were 2%, 6%, and 10%, respectively (p=0∙0050 
for trend). 
The SF-36 physical component, but not the mental 
component, significantly improved in the nurse-led 
group but did not change in the usual-care group 
(table 3). Mean scores were significantly better in the 
nurse-led group than in the usual-care group at 1 year 
(p<0∙0010) and 2 years (p=0∙0027). Gout Impact Scale 
scores improved significantly in both groups, for the 
overall and unmet needs components (table 3) but were 
better in the nurse-led group at 1 and 2 years (both 
p<0∙0001).
Participants in the nurse-led group attended a mean of 
9∙3 visits (SD 2∙2) and had a mean of 8∙3 (3∙2) telephone 
calls about gout, mostly occurring in the first year of 
treatment, and mainly in the first 6 months of treatment 
(appendix). Patients in the usual-care group visited GPs 
a mean of 0·6 times (SD 1·4) specifically for gout during 
the 2-year study period.
When assessed per protocol, results for all primary and 
secondary outcomes did not differ qualitatively from 
those in the intention-to-treat dataset (appendix).
The cost per QALY gained for nurse-led care at 2 years 
was £5066 and was modelled to be £286 at 3 years. We 
calculated that nurse-led care would produce 2% more 
health than usual care and cost £1726 less per QALY 
gained at 5 years, and would produce 3% more health 
gain and cost £2783 less per QALY gained at 10 years. If 
the cost of gout flares were decreased, the cost per QALY 
gained would rise to £6144 at 3 years, £3578 at 5 years, 
and £2425 at 10 years, but remained cost-effective given

the NICE threshold of £20 000 (appendix). The inclusion 
of additional nurse time did not substantially alter the 
cost per QALY gained value at 3 years (increase £520), 
and at 5 years and beyond the nurse-led approach led to 
cost savings. Even with the model of extremely unfavour-
able efficacy, the cost per QALY gained was £5011 at 
3 years and £648 at 5 years, and became cost saving at 
10 years (appendix).
Discussion
Nurse-led care of people with gout in the UK community 
can achieve high uptake of urate-lowering therapy and 
adherence over 2 years. 95% of participants in the nurse-
led group achieved the recommended target serum urate 
concentration of less than 360 µmol/L,15 and patient-
centred outcomes, including flare frequency, presence of 
tophi, and quality of life, improved significantly compared 
with those in the usual-care group. This study strongly 
reaffirms the importance of education and engagement 
of patients in disease management and the usefulness of 
a treat-to-target strategy. As well as clinical benefits to 
patients with gout, the cost per QALY gained was far 
below the standard NICE threshold of £20 000 and started 
to save costs at 5 years. A similar pattern was seen even in 
an extremely unfavourable efficacy model and when the 
cost of managing gout flares was substantially reduced.
To our knowledge, this is the first randomised 
controlled trial to compare nurse-led gout care with 
usual GP-led care. The key differences from usual care 
in the nurse-led approach in this study were the time 
spent explaining gout and making the explanations 
individualised and easy to understand, addressing 
illness perceptions, and involving patients in shared 
decision making. Although education and engagement 
are thought to be professional responsibilities and core 
elements of care, they are often suboptimum in gout 
management,23 which possibly reflects misconceptions 
and poor under 
standing of gout by physicians8,12 and 
time constraints on health-care delivery. The role of 
non-physician health-care profes 
sionals in providing 
gout education has been examined in two US pilot 
studies. One assessed pharmacist-assisted manage 
ment 
of urate-lowering therapy for 100 patients referred by 
primary care physicians24 and the other assessed nurse-
delivered education plus pharmacist telephone calls in 
45 patients referred to hospital-based rheumatologists.25 
As with our pilot study of nurse-led care,15 the two US 
studies reported good acceptability and benefits to 
patients from education irrespective of the health 
professionals involved. In a later US randomised 
controlled trial involving 77 patients, pharmacist-led, 
telephone-based management of urate lowering therapy 
was compared with usual care led by primary 
physicians.26 At 26 weeks, 13 (35%) of 37 patients in the 
pharmacist-led group compared with five (14%) of 40 in 
the physician-led group had serum urate less than 
360 µmol/L.
Strengths of our study are that it was a randomised 
controlled trial with a usual-care comparator and that it 
was done in the community, where most gout patients 
are managed. Additionally, we followed up patients 
for 2 years and the study was powered to show differ-
ences between groups in patient-centred outcomes. 
The patients included were typical of those encountered 
in clinical practice, with many having associated 
comorbidities (eg, being overweight or obese or having 
cardiovascular disease) and around 20% had renal 
insufficiency (chronic kidney disease stage 3), yet were 
able to achieve optimum clinical outcomes with nurse-
led care. Furthermore, retention in this group was 91% 
at 2 years and adherence to urate-lowering therapy was 
the best reported in clinical trials of gout. These 
findings probably reflect the importance of education 
and engagement of patients, but also regular follow-
up and positive patient−practitioner interactions. A 
quali 
tative study to assess the various elements of care 
in relation to outcomes has been done in 30 of the 
patients in this study who were sampled 18–26 months 
after study end, and results will be published separately.
Several aspects of nurse-delivered treat-to-target urate-
lowering therapy deserve emphasis. First, allopurinol 
doses were higher in the nurse-led group than in the 
usual-care group (mean 460 mg/day vs 230 mg/day), and 
in the UK overall, where prescriptions rarely exceed 
300 mg/day.9 These higher doses were needed to improve 
outcomes. Sub 
optimum dosing in the usual-care group 
might reflect physician inertia, lack of a treat-to-target 
strategy, poor monitoring of serum urate concen-
trations,9,27–29 and concerns over safety of and adherence 
to urate-lowering therapy.12 Febuxostat was a successful 
alternative urate-lowering therapy, uricosurics were 
needed infrequently, and no patient needed combined 
therapy. Second, only three participants elected to receive 
prophylaxis against gout flares during the titration phase 
at the start of urate-lowering therapy.7,13 This low uptake 
might explain the slightly higher flare frequency in the 
nurse-led group in year 1 than in the usual-care group, 
but adherence was not affected, which suggests that 
prophylaxis might not be needed if up titration is done 
slowly.15 Third, 99% of patients in the nurse-led group, 
when fully informed about treatment options, wanted to 
start urate-lowering therapy. This finding challenges the 
recommendations to reserve such treat 
ment for patients 
with severe gout. Some guidelines that support full 
education about gout, including urate-lowering therapy, 
at time of diagnosis7,13 are moving towards early definitive 
treatment rather than waiting until gout is severe. A 
similar paradigm has been applied to rheumatoid and 
other inflammatory arthritides. Finally, the American 
College of Physicians has advised doctors to not use 
treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy because they found 
no evidence of benefits to patient.30 However, their treat-
to-avoid-symptoms strategy, which ignores serum urate 
concen 
trations and engagement of patients, is not clearly

explained, and the approach is not supported by 
evidence.31 If that strategy is taken to approximate the 
usual-care situation in our GP-led group, our study 
supports treat to target.7,13,16,32 The improved patient-
centred outcomes we saw in the nurse-led group at 
2 years and clear relationships between tertiles of serum 
urate concen 
tration at the end of the study and flare 
frequency in year 2 and presence of tophi at the end of 
the study further refute the American College of 
Physicians advice.
This study has limitations. First, recruitment might 
have been subject to selection bias if participating 
practices were interested in gout. Likewise, if people 
concerned about gout were more likely to participate, the 
population might have been subject to response bias. 
Nevertheless, the proportion of patients taking urate-
lowering therapy at baseline (39%) is representative of the 
UK,1,9 and neither bias would diminish or enhance 
between-group differ 
ences. Second, blinding of the 
intervention was not possible, which might have affected 
the behaviour of GPs and participants in the usual-care 
group (eg, GPs more actively managing the gout of 
patients known to be in the study or patients feeling 
encouraged to consult more after receiving the gout 
information from a nurse and booklet at baseline). 
Certainly, use of urate-lowering therapy increased from 
39% to 56% in the usual-care group, but allopurinol doses 
remained low and mean serum urate con 
centrations did 
not improve. Therefore, any behaviour changes did not 
importantly affect results and, if anything, would have 
diminished between-group differences. Third, because 
crystal identification was not required for the diagnosis of 
gout, some patients might have been misclassified. This 
diagnostic method is, however, rarely used by GPs 
and should not affect between-group differences. 
Misclassification might also have occurred through 
patients self-reporting flares without requirement for 
specific clinical criteria or assessment and irrespective of 
any modification by rapid self-treatment. Again, though, 
this factor should not have altered between-group 
differences. Fourth, although the study lasted 2 years, 
longer observation would be useful to allow sufficient 
time to eliminate all sodium urate crystals and assess 
people through to true remission. Fifth, the study was 
done in just one UK region, and generalisability of the 
findings remains to be determined. Similarly, this care 
model might not suit countries with less well established 
nurse-led care. However, providing that patients are fully 
informed and engaged and a treat-to-target strategy is 
used for urate-lowering therapy, our findings are likely to 
be generalisable to any practitioner who delivers the care. 
Finally, we trained research nurses rather than practice-
based nurses. This caveat will be addressed in a future 
research-to-implementation study.
Community-based nurse-led care involving education 
and engagement of patients and a treat-to-target strategy 
for urate-lowering therapy achieved target serum urate 
concentrations and improved patient-centred outcomes 
in more than 90% of patients with gout. Compared with 
usual GP-led care, this model was cost-effective and 
potentially cost-saving, and merits further consideration 
in the UK. Our results highlight the impor 
tance and 
success of individualised education and care of patients, 
a principle that should be considered by any health-care 
professional who manages people with gout.
