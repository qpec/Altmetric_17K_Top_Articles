The cellular and molecular basis of sex-dimorphic autoimmune
diseases, such as the CNS demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis
(MS), remains unclear. Our studies in the SJL mouse model of MS,
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reveal that
sex-determined differences in Il33 expression by innate immune
cells in response to myelin peptide immunization regulate EAE
susceptibility. IL-33 is selectively induced in PLP139–151-immunized
males and activates type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), cells that
promote and sustain a nonpathogenic Th2 myelin-specific re-
sponse. Without this attenuating IL-33 response, females gener-
ate an encephalitogenic Th17-dominant response, which can be
reversed by IL-33 treatment. Mast cells are one source of IL-
33 and we provide evidence that testosterone directly induces
Il33 gene expression and also exerts effects on the potential for
Il33 gene expression during mast cell development. Thus, in con-
trast to their pathogenic role in allergy, we propose a sex-specific
role for both mast cells and ILC2s as attenuators of the patho-
genic Th response in CNS inflammatory disease.

here are well-established differences in the immune re-
sponses of females and males. These discrepancies are per-
haps best exemplified by the three- to ninefold increase in the
incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus ery-
thematous, Grave’s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis in females
(1–3). In multiple sclerosis (MS), a T cell-mediated demyelinating
disease of the CNS, not only is the incidence three to four times
higher in women, there are also sex-determined differences in the
average age of onset and in the clinical course (4). Women gen-
erally present at a younger age and preferentially exhibit a
relapsing-remitting course, whereas men develop disease later in
life and more often develop chronic progressive disease. Although
the molecular underpinnings of such sex dimorphism are still
largely undefined, the interplay between X chromosome dosage,
distinct microbiota, and sex hormones likely contribute (5, 6).
The SJL mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune en-
cephalomyelitis (EAE), recapitulates several features of the
human disease. Similar to MS, myelin-reactive helper T (Th)
cells gain access to the CNS and orchestrate local inflammatory
damage to the myelinated neurons, leading to variable neuro-
logical deficits (7). Female mice exhibit higher incidence, more
severe disease, and a more consistent relapsing pattern than their
male counterparts (8). This sex-determined disease susceptibil-
ity corresponds to differences in myelin-specific T cell cytokine
responses. Whereas females generate proinflammatory IFN-
γ–dominant responses, the response in males is skewed toward
the production of IL-4 and IL-10 and is nonpathogenic (9–11).
Sex hormones, particularly testosterone, a steroid hormone
primarily secreted by the testes, can alter T cell responses in im-
munized mice. Testosterone treatment of SJL females attenuates
EAE by shifting the pathogenic IFN-γ–dominated anti-myelin
response to a nonpathogenic IL-4 and IL-10 response. Expression
of other proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1β
(11–14), is suppressed as well. Conversely, castration or treatment
of male mice with flutamide, an androgen receptor (AR) antago-
nist, results in increased disease severity (13, 15). Male recipients
develop EAE after adoptive transfer of primed T cells from female
donors, indicating that testosterone exerts a protective influence
during T cell priming (12). However, the precise mechanisms of
these disease-attenuating effects have not been clearly defined.
In humans, testosterone is present at levels seven to eight times
greater in adult men than women and is also associated with
protection (16, 17). The delayed onset of MS and more severe
disease course in men correlates with the physiologic age-related
decline in testosterone (17). Limited studies also demonstrate that
testosterone treatment in male patients improves MS outcomes
(18, 19). For example, in a cohort of 10 men with relapsing-
remitting MS, daily testosterone therapy for 12 mo reversed
gray matter atrophy and improved cognitive performance (19).
Our previous studies of EAE susceptibility in c-kit mutant
(KitW/Wv) SJL mice implicated type 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2s) in the male-specific Th2-mediated protection from EAE
(20). ILC2s are a subset of CD45+ Lineage-negative (Lin−), IL-
7Rα+ c-kit+/− ILCs, cells that share functional characteristics
with conventional T cells but lack antigen receptors (21). These
cells respond quickly and vigorously to a variety of cytokines and
lipid mediators, including IL-33, IL-25, IL-2, and prostaglandin
D2 (PGD2) (21–23). ILC2s are distinguished from other ILC
subsets (CD45+ Lin− IL-7Rα+) by the expression of the IL-
33 receptor, a heterodimeric cell surface receptor composed of
IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and ST2, as well as
the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. ILC2s are reported
Significance
Women are much more likely to develop autoimmune diseases,
such as systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, and
multiple sclerosis. Sex hormones, including estrogen and tes-
tosterone, clearly influence disease susceptibility, but the pre-
cise cellular and molecular targets of these hormones have
remained unexplained. While most studies have focused on
what causes the damaging inflammation in females, there is
also much to be learned by studying the factors that confer
protection to males. Using a mouse model of multiple sclerosis,
a CNS demyelinating disease, we identified a testosterone-
driven pathway mediated by mast cell-dependent IL-33 ex-
pression that limits the development of a destructive immune
response in males. The identification of such pathways has
important therapeutic implications.

 to reside primarily in mucosal-associated tissues, such as the lung
and gut, where they contribute to tissue repair and homeostasis
(21). ILC2s are essential for initiating and maintaining Th2 re-
sponses and play a critical role in both protective Th2 immunity to
helminth infections and in the pathologic Th2-mediated in-
flammation of allergic disease.
We previously reported that ILC2s accumulate in the draining
lymph nodes (LNs) and CNS of EAE-resistant wild-type SJL
males after PLP139–151 immunization, corresponding with a non-
pathogenic Th2 anti-myelin response (20). Male SJL-KitW/Wv mice,
which have profound defects in both mast cell and ILC2 devel-
opment, lack this ILC2 response, generate a robust Th17 response,
and develop EAE. Because mast cell reconstitution does not re-
store protection, we proposed that the absence of Th2-promoting
ILC2s is responsible for the differences in anti-myelin responses by
male wild-type and KitW/Wv mice. In the present study, we asked
whether the Th17-dominant anti-myelin response in females also
corresponds to a deficit in ILC2 development or function. We
demonstrate that ILC2s are not strongly activated in immunized
females. This deficit in ILC2 activity is not the result of altered
development or an intrinsic inability of this population to respond
to inflammatory cues, but rather to significantly reduced pro-
duction of IL-33, a cytokine that promotes type 2 immunity, in part
through its ability to activate ILC2s (24). Mast cells are one im-
portant source of IL-33 in vivo and although there is no sex-
dependent difference in AR expression, testosterone selectively
induces Il33 in male-derived bone marrow mast cells (BMMCs).
We propose a previously unknown and sex-specific role for both
mast cells and ILC2s as important attenuators of the proin-
flammatory Th17 response in EAE. Furthermore, these data de-
fine a cellular and molecular target of testosterone and identify a
mechanism of action for testosterone-mediated protection in an
autoimmune disease of the CNS.
Results
Protection from EAE in Male SJL Mice Corresponds to a Dominant Th2
Anti-myelin Response in both the Periphery and CNS. Previous re-
ports provided evidence of a Th2 bias in myelin peptide-immunized
SJL male mice (9–11). However, these studies were performed
before the discovery of Th17 cells and only compared IL-4, IL-10,
and IFN-γ mRNA expression and secretion by total leukocytes. To
further characterize the sex-specific Th cell responses, mice were
immunized with PLP139–151 and disease course (Fig. 1A) and T cell
cytokine responses were evaluated by flow cytometry in both the
draining LNs 6 d post immunization (dpi) and CNS 14 dpi. Al-
though the total numbers of CD45+ immune cells in the LNs are
similar between protected males and susceptible females 6 dpi (Fig.
1B), there is a striking difference in Th responses. The proportion
of myelin-specific IL-4– and IL-10–producing Th2 cells is signifi-
cantly higher in males. In contrast, Th17 cells are most prevalent in
females (Fig. 1 C and D).
Consistent with less-severe EAE, CD45hi CNS-infiltrating cells
are significantly reduced in male mice 14 dpi (Fig. 1E). However,
the same Th response dichotomy is observed. At 6 dpi, Gata3, a
Th2 and ILC2 lineage-determining gene, is induced in males and
Tbet and Rorc, which specify Th1/ILC1 and Th17/ILC3 differenti-
ation, respectively, are induced in females (Fig. 1F). The majority of
CNS-infiltrating Th cells are also Th2-skewed in males and Th17-
skewed in females (Fig. 1 G and H) 14 dpi. Thus, protection in
males is not due to a reduced or absent anti-myelin Th cell response
but results from the generation of qualitatively distinct anti-myelin
T cells that fail to efficiently enter the CNS.
Immunization-Induced ILC2 Accumulation Differs in Immunized Male
and Female Mice. We asked whether ILC2 (CD45+ Lin− IL-7Rα+
ST2+) (Fig. S1) populations in the LNs and CNS show sex-
related differences in immunized mice. In the draining LNs,
ILC2s comprise a very rare population of cells at day 6 in both
sexes, making up only ∼0.0004% of total CD45+ cells in males and
∼0.0003% in females (Fig. 2 A and B). However, there is a slight
but significant increase in the proportion of ILC2s compared with
Fig. 1.

 other proinflammatory ILC subsets (CD45+ Lin− IL-7Rα+ ST2−)
in males (Fig. 2 C and D). These likely include the IFN-
γ–producing ILC1s and IL-17– and GM-CSF–producing ILC3s,
which promote the differentiation of Th1 andTh17 cells, facili-
tate T cell migration to the CNS, and have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of EAE (21, 25, 26).
At day 14 dpi, the differences in these populations in the CNS
are more dramatic. ILC2s comprise ∼1.0% of the total CD45hi
population in males and ∼0.36% in females (Fig. 2 E and F).
ILC2s were not detected in the CD45mid CNS cell population.
There is also preferential accumulation of ILC2s, which average
∼54% of total ILCs in males. In females, ILC2s comprise only
∼11% of total ILCs (Fig. 2 G and H).
ILC2s can induce Th2 cell polarization through a contact-
dependent mechanism by acting as antigen-presenting cells and
expressing IL-13 (27–29). Thus, it is notable that although ILC2s
comprise a small proportion of the total CNS CD45hi cell pop-
ulation, their frequency is much higher relative to Th cells in im-
munized males (1:12) than in females (1:96) (Fig. 2I). Furthermore,
although expression is variable between mice, ILC2s from both
sexes express IL-13 (Fig. 2J), detected by intracellular staining.
No Sex-Related Differences Exist in Basal and Exogenously Activated
ILC2s. The frequencies of ILC2 precursors in the bone marrow
(Lin−CD45+α4β7
+CD25+) and thymus (Lin−CD4−CD8−CD44+c-
kit+CD25+) (30, 31) are similar between naïve males and females
(Fig. S2 A and B). Proportions of mature resident ILC2 pop-
ulations (CD45+ Lin− IL-7Rα+ST2+) are also the same (Fig. 2R,
Upper, and Fig. S2 C–F), with the exception of the meninges, which
show an average 2.4-fold higher frequency in females (Fig. 2S,
Upper). Compared with other tissues examined, ILC2s are most
prevalent in the CNS and meninges at steady state (Fig. 2 R and S).
An in vitro ILC2 culture system was used to determine if there
are intrinsic differences in responses to ILC2-activating fac-
tors (Fig. 2K). IL-33 was administered on 3 consecutive days
by intraperitoneal injection. On day 4, ILC2s (CD45+Lin−IL-
7Rα+ST2+CD25+Sca-1+) were isolated from the bone marrow
by magnetic bead-enrichment and subsequent flow cytometry
sorting (Fig. S3A). After culture with IL-33, IL-2, and IL-7 for
6 d, ILC2s derived from both male and female mice were greater
than 94% pure (Fig. S3B), showed similar c-kit expression (Fig.
S3B), and expanded equivalently by greater than 10-fold (Fig.
S3C). Upon restimulation with the same cytokine mixture
(Fig. 2K), female- and male-derived ILC2s exhibit comparable ro-
bust induction of IL-13 and IL-5 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2 L–O),
and a similar but smaller induction of Il4 and Il9 (Fig. 2 P and Q).
The in vivo expansion of ILC2s 4 d after IL-33 administration was
also evaluated. Although there is variable induction between tissues,
the expansion of ILC2s is similar in males and females (Fig. 2 R and
S, Lower, and Fig. S2 G–J). Thus, female-derived ILC2s develop
normally and, if provided with appropriate factors, their response is
indistinguishable from male-derived ILC2s both in vitro and in vivo.
Mast Cells Are a Source of Sex-Determined Il33 Expression. We asked
if reduced expression of IL-33, a potent ILC2 activator (32),
could account for the relative inactivity of ILC2s in females. As
shown in Fig. 3 A–C, Il33 expression is negligible in the LNs,
spinal cord, and brain of naïve mice but shows significant in-
creases 6 dpi in male but not female mice. This Il33 response is
only observed in mice immunized with PLP139–151 but not in
those given Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-containing CFA
alone (Fig. 3 D–F), demonstrating that Il33 induction is de-
pendent on a functional autoreactive T cell response and is not
solely due to microbial-derived signals.
Although epithelial cells are the best-studied source of IL-33
(33), mast cells are reported to show both constitutive and
inflammation-induced expression (34–37). To assess Il33 ex-
pression by mast cells in vivo, we first compared responses in wild-
type and mast cell-deficient KitW/Wv mice 6 dpi in the meninges,
mast cell-rich tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. Il33
transcripts are significantly increased in wild-type males compared
with naïve mice or immunized KitW/Wv males (Fig. 3G). Selective
mast cell reconstitution of the meninges of KitW/Wv males was
performed as previously reported (38, 39), and partially restores
the response (Fig. 3H). The inducible expression of Il1b and Tnf,
genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, is significantly higher in
the meninges of immunized wild-type female SJL mice compared
with males. As previously shown, this response in female mice is
mast cell-dependent (Fig. 3 I and J) (38–40).
We next isolated meningeal tissues and compared mast cell
IL-33 protein production in mice by flow cytometry 6 dpi. As
shown in Fig. 3K, naïve males and females have similar numbers
of mast cells and mast cell frequencies are similar after immu-
nization (Fig. 3L). While IL-33 protein was detected in mast cells
derived from both sexes, the percentage of IL-33–expressing
mast cells is higher in males (Fig. 3M). There is also a significant
increase in the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL-33–
expressing cells in males at 6 dpi (Fig. 3N). The differences in IL-
33 protein expression between males and females are not as
dramatic as those observed at the RNA level, suggesting that
steady-state levels in mast cells may be masking the ability to
quantify differences in inducible IL-33.
IL-33 Expands ILC2s, Drives a Th2 Response, and Diminishes Clinical
Signs of EAE in Females. If reduced expression of IL-33 leading to a
diminished ILC2 response in females underlies sex-dimorphic
EAE susceptibility, IL-33 treatment of SJL females should
confer protection by activating ILC2s and shifting the pathogenic
anti-myelin response to one that is Th2 skewed. To test this
hypothesis, female mice were treated with increasing doses of
IL-33 during the preclinical phase of EAE (Fig. 4A). As shown in
Fig. 4B, the clinical signs of EAE were significantly diminished
in a dose-dependent manner, with no disease evident in the
300-ng–treated cohort. This protection corresponds with dose-
dependent increases of ILC2s and Th2 cells in both the LNs (Fig.
S4) and CNS (Fig. 4 C–E).
IL-33 treatment also reverses established disease. IL-33
(300 ng) was administered for 3 consecutive days when individ-
ual mice exhibited a score ≥1.5, usually between 14 and 18 dpi
(Fig. 4F). Although both treated and untreated mice exhibit
similar remission kinetics, the treated cohort does not relapse
before day 40 (Fig. 4G). This protection corresponds to a sig-
nificant increase in ILC2 frequency in the CNS and a shift from a
Th17- to a Th2-dominated response at 33 dpi, more than 2 wk
after the last IL-33 injection (Fig. 4 H–J). Thus, IL-33 has effi-
cacy in preventing both disease onset and relapse.
Finally we tested the effects of treatment with anti–IL-33 an-
tibody and an IgG2b isotype control in a small cohort of SJL
males. Mice were administered 100 μg of antibody intraperito-
neally on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 post immunization (Fig. 4K). One
of four control mice (maximum score: 0.5) and three of four
anti–IL-33–treated mice (maximum score: 3.5) showed signs of
clinical disease by day 26 post immunization. The loss of disease
protection in anti–IL-33–treated mice was associated with in-
creased CD45hi cell infiltration of the CNS (Fig. 4M) and re-
duced ILC2 accumulation (Fig. 4N), further supporting the idea
that IL-33 protects and acts by inducing ILC2 activation.
Testosterone Induces Il33 Expression by SJL-Derived Mast Cells. Mast
cells are reported to express the AR (41, 42), raising the possi-
bility that male hormones influence differential IL-33 expression
in these cells. AR expression was detected in peritoneal and
BMMCs isolated from male and female SJL mice (Fig. 5 A–D).
Although higher in peritoneal cells from males (Fig. 5 A and B),
AR expression is indistinguishable in male- and female-derived
BMMCs (Fig. 5 C and D). To determine if testosterone can

 directly induce Il33 expression by mast cells, BMMCs were treated
with increasing concentrations of purified testosterone in the
presence and absence of flutamide, an AR antagonist. Neither
flutamide nor its solvent affects BMMC viability (Fig. S5). Tes-
tosterone directly induces Il33 in a dose-dependent manner in

addition of flutamide significantly reduces Il33 expression resulting
in an approximate 10-fold shift in the testosterone dose–response

that AR engagement is required for this response.

 Surprisingly, this male-specific IL-33 expression pattern is also
evident after activation through FceRI cross-linking or with Mtb,
where inducible IL-33 mRNA and protein is only observed in
male-derived BMMCs (Fig. 5 F and G). Similar to the pattern
observed in the meninges, female-derived BMMCs exhibit
higher expression of Il1b and Tnf, compared with male-derived
cells (Fig. 5 H and I). Thus, other mechanisms, perhaps those
that regulate chromatin state, are also operating to regulate sex-
specific cytokine expression.
A kinetic analysis of serum testosterone concentrations in
male mice revealed testosterone increases at early time points
post immunization, with average maximum increases between
days 13 and 14 followed by decreases through day 18 (Fig. 5J),
indicating early testosterone induction occurs in response to in-
flammatory signals and may contribute to increases in IL-33.
Serum from immunized male, but not female mice, induces
ll33 expression in BMMCs, a response that is inhibited by flu-
tamide (Fig. 5K) in support of this idea.
Pronounced sex-dimorphic EAE susceptibility is only observed
in certain strains of mice (8). Both male and female C57BL/
6 mice, which are most commonly used in studies of a mono-
phasic form of EAE, are susceptible and show a similar disease
course. Thus, the testosterone-driven IL-33/ILC2 pathway de-
scribed here is insufficient to confer protection. Variations in
serum testosterone levels between strains have been documented
(43) and our analysis of of SJL and C57BL/6 males revealed
significantly lower levels in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 5L). We specu-
late that decreased testosterone levels in susceptible males re-
sults in a failure to activate a threshold level of IL-33 required
for protection. However, other factors, including strain-specific
differences in mast cell numbers and cytokine responses, may
also have a role (44, 45).
Discussion
EAE in SJL mice serves as a useful model of MS that reca-
pitulates the female bias for disease development. Here we

 demonstrate sex-specific IL-33 expression, likely influenced di-
rectly by testosterone, underlies disease protection in male SJL
mice. IL-33 is selectively induced in immunized males and elicits
the activation of ILC2s, a population of cells that are essential
for driving Th2 responses (27, 28, 46) (Fig. 6). We hypothesize
that under conditions of low testosterone in females, IL-33 is not
sufficiently induced, ILC2s are not activated, and a Th17 anti-
myelin response predominates. Reduced testosterone levels and
an inadequate IL-33 response may also explain the age-related
increase in MS and EAE susceptibility observed in males (3, 15),
as well as the absence of male protection in strains such as
C57BL/6 and NOD/Lt mice (8).
We previously reported that mast cell–T cell interactions in
the meninges induce IL-1β expression by mast cells and GM-CSF
production by T cells, and promotes T cell encephalitogenicity
(40). These findings demonstrate the importance of immune cell
cross-talk in these tissues and suggest that similar cross-talk with
T cells may affect mast cell IL-33 expression. We propose that
the meninges are also sites where ILC2s regulate Th2 effector
function. ILC2s are numerous in the meninges and their prox-
imity to IL-33–producing mast cells can facilitate their activation.
Through IL-13–mediated effects on resident dendritic cells or via
direct antigen presentation (27–29, 46, 47), ILC2s are well
placed to influence the effector phenotype of autoreactive T cells
transiting through these tissues before their entry into the CNS
parenchyma (48–50).
IL-33 is a mediator belonging to the IL-1 superfamily of
cytokines that acts as both a histone binding factor and a pleio-
tropic cytokine (reviewed in ref. 33). Among its activities, IL-
33 can regulate gene transcription, promote tissue homeostasis,
fibrosis, and wound healing, as well as directly activate ST2+
immune cells, including ILC2s, T regulatory cells, CD8+ T cells,
mast cells, basophils, and Th2 cells. Produced constitutively at
relatively low levels by epithelial and endothelial cells, dendritic
cells, macrophages, and several CNS resident cells, IL-33 is often
localized in the nucleus and is passively released by damaged or
necrotic cells, acting as an alarmin. However, IL-33 also exhibits
inducible expression and cytoplasmic localization in certain in-
flammatory settings, and its release can occur independent of
cell necrosis via mechanical stress or through autocrine activa-
tion of P2 purinergic receptors (33, 51, 52). While it is likely that
other cells contribute, we show that mast cells are an important

 inducible source of this cytokine. Robust Il33 induction is absent
in the LNs, meninges, and CNS of PLP131–159-immunized male
SJL KitW/Wv mast cell-deficient mice, and this response is largely
restored by mast cell reconstitution. IL-33 protein is also de-
tected in meningeal mast cells. Mast cell IL-33 production is of
particular interest because the mast cell-specific proteases chy-
mase and tryptase are reported to generate a mature form of IL-
33 with significantly increased ability to activate ILC2s (53).
Although we have not yet determined how IL-33 is released by
mast cells, there is precedence for active transport of cytokines,
such as TNF, to cytoplasmic granules and release through de-
granulation (54, 55).
The male-specific expression of IL-33 in mast cells also reveals
a potentially interesting context-dependent function of these
cells. Instead of IL-33, immunized females express IL-1β and
TNF, inflammatory cytokines that exert a variety of pathogenic
effects in EAE, including early and robust neutrophil recruit-
ment, disruption of blood–brain barrier integrity, and promotion
of T cell encephalitogenicity (38–40, 56). Even under identical
BMMC culture and stimulation conditions, this sex-specific
pattern of cytokine expression is evident. These differences are
not due to disparate expression of AR or the high affinity IgE
receptor, suggesting that there are restraints on the chromatin
landscape that limit IL-33 expression in females and IL-1β
and TNF expression in males, perhaps imposed by sustained
hormone exposure during development.
There is abundant evidence that ILC2s are critical intermedi-
aries in IL-33–mediated EAE protection. ILC2s are among the
most robust responders to IL-33 (32), rapidly producing IL-13,
a Th2 polarizing cytokine (29, 46). ILC2 depletion studies in
mouse models of allergy have clearly established that ILC2s are
required for Th2 priming and memory (28, 29, 47). The pro-
found deficits in ST2+ ILC2 activation we observe in immu-
nized female mice that are corrected by IL-33 treatment and
the ability of IL-33 blockade to reduce ILC2 activation and
reverse protection in males, also support this concept. How-
ever, there are several other populations of ST2+ cells that
could be targets of IL-33 in this setting, including mast cells and
basophils (33). Of particular interest is a subset of ST2+ T
regulatory cells that show an IL-33–dependent ability to limit
inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease (57).
Although IL-33 responsiveness was not assessed, an earlier
study by Matejuk et al. (15) shows that decreases in Foxp3+
Tregs correspond with declining testosterone levels and in-
creased EAE severity in aging C57BL/6 mice.
Our results support the concept that altering pathogenic Th
responses is a viable therapeutic approach for MS. One mech-
anism of action of the approved MS drugs, glatiramer acetate
(Copaxone) and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), is to shift the
pathogenic autoreactive Th1/17 autoreactive response to a Th2-
dominant one (58, 59). Although testosterone treatment in
male MS patients has shown promise, this is not a viable
therapy in females, particularly because MS most often strikes
young women during their childbearing years. IL-33 treatment
or the use of more selective ILC2 activators, as well as strate-
gies to inhibit pathogenic ILC subsets, may provide protection
in both early and later stages of MS. While there are no studies
of IL-33 efficacy in humans, IL-33 expression is increased in
normal-appearing white matter and lesions of MS patients,
indicating that perhaps IL-33 is part of a compensatory re-
sponse to damaging inflammation (60, 61). Studies in models of
stroke, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer’s disease demonstrate
that IL-33 reduces CNS tissue loss, reverses astrogliosis and
demyelination, and improves cognition (62–67). IL-33 also has
a direct effect on oligodendrocyte gene expression and induces
p38MAPK phosphorylation these cells, an event linked to
myelination (63). Thus, IL-33 therapy has the potential to prevent
disease progression by blocking damaging inflammation as well as
promoting myelin and neuronal repair in MS and other diseases
of the CNS.
Methods
Mice. Four- to 8-wk-old age-matched SJL/J, SJL/J-KitW/Wv, and C57BL/6J mice
were used in all experiments. SJL/J-KitW/Wv mice were derived in our labo-
ratory, as previously described (39). Mice were housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions with 12-h light/dark cycles in an Association for
Assessment of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facility at
Northwestern University. The experiments were carried out under ARRIVE
(Animal Research: Reporting of in Vivo Experiments) guidelines and ap-
proved by the Northwestern University Animal Care Committee.
EAE Induction. Four- to 8-wk-old mice were immunized subcutaneously at two
injection sites on the posterior flanks with 100 μg PLP139–151 (Genemed
Biotechnologies) emulsified in 500 μg CFA (Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant
with desiccated M. tuberculosis H37 RA) (VWR). EAE was scored blindly on a
five-point scale: 0, no clinical signs; 1, flaccid tail; 2, ataxia; 3, significant hind
limb paralysis; 4, cachexia; 5, death.
Cell Analysis by Flow Cytometry. Cells were prepared from homogenized
tissues. Before staining with indicated antibodies, cells were treated with
anti-CD16/32 FcBlock (BioLegend). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells
were restimulated for 5 h with 50 ug/mL PLP139–151 (Genemed Biotechnol-
ogies). Brefeldin A (eBioscience) added at a concentration of 3 μg/mL for the
final 4 h. Intracellular staining for cytokines and the AR was assessed in fixed
and permeabilized cells (eBioscience). Monoclonal IL-17–, GM-CSF–, IL-4–,
and IL-10–specific antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. The AR-
specific rabbit monoclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam and all
antibodies directed to extracellular markers, including the lineage stain,
Fig. 6.
A model for sex-dimorphic testosterone-mediated
protection in EAE. (A) In males, testosterone concentra-
tions increase upon immunization and together with other
inflammatory activators stimulate the production of IL-
33 by AR-expressing mast cells or other AR+ cells. IL-33 ac-
tivates IL-13–producing ILC2s that accumulate in the LNs,
meninges, and CNS and promote a protective Th2 re-
sponse. IL-33–responsive ST2+ mast cells and basophils may
amplify the Th2 polarization through production of IL-
4 and IL-13. (B) In the absence of sufficiently high testos-
terone levels, female-derived mast cells express proin-
flammatory mediators (notably IL-1β and TNF) instead of
IL-33, resulting in a pathogenic Th17-dominated anti-
myelin response, rendering female mice more susceptible
to EAE. The influence of testosterone exposure during
development may also confer a higher potential for Il33
gene expression in males.

 were purchased from BioLegend. The lineage cocktail included antibodies to
CD3, Ly-6C, CD11b, B220, and Ter-119.
IL-33 expression by meningeal mast cells was assessed using single-cell
homogenates prepared from pooled meningeal tissues of five donor mice
per sample and stained with c-kit (Brilliant Violet 421, BioLegend) and FcReIα
(APC, BioLegend). After fixation cells were incubated with 1.25 μg polyclonal
goat anti-mouse IL-33 antibody (R&D Systems) followed by staining with 5 μL
donkey anti-goat IgG PE-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems).
ILC2 FACs Sorting and Expansion in Vitro. Donor mice were administered
300 ng IL-33 (eBioescience or R&D Systems) via the intraperitoneal route daily
for 3 d and killed on day 4. Lin− populations were enriched from bone
marrow using the StemCell Hematopoetic Lineage Negative EasySep Kit.
Cells were stained with antibodies that detect ILC2 markers [Lineage (Ter-
119, Gr-1, B220, CD3, CD11b), CD45, IL-7Rα, Sca-1, CD25] and with the UV
live/dead stain (Invitrogen) before FACs sorting (performed in the Robert H.
Lurie Cancer Center Flow Cyometry Core). Sorted ILC2s were cultured at 1 ×
106 cells/mL in 15% complete RPMI supplemented with IL-33 (12 ng/mL), IL-2
(10 μg/mL), and IL-7 (10 ng/mL) for 6 d with fresh media and cytokine sup-
plementation on days 2, 4, and 6.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR. RNA was isolated from cultured BMMCs or ILC2s
using the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation System. RNA was extracted from
pooled meningeal tissues, as well as individual brain, spinal cord, or LN
samples with the Qiagen Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit. cDNA was generated using
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). Quantification
was performed with iCycler iQ5 Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad)
using PerfecTA SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad). For each sample, the cycle
number (Ct) at which the analysis threshold was reached, set in the linear
range of the amplification curve [fluorescence = f(cycle)], was calculated. The
relative expression of the cDNA template was calculated as the ratio of 2ΔCt
for each transcript tested relative to a control housekeeping gene (Hprt).
Primers used are listed in Table 1.
IL-33 Administration and IL-33 Blockade. IL-33 (eBioscience or R&D Systems)
was administered at the indicated doses by intraperitoneal injection daily
for 3 consecutive days or every 3 d. The specific activity of IL-33 was >3 × 107
units/mg (eBioscience or R&D Systems), corresponding to an ED50 of 0.012–
0.05 ng/mL. Anti-mouse IL-33 blocking antibody (Bondy1-1) or an IgG2b
isotype (BPC4) control (0.2 mL, 100 μg) antibody (Adipogen) was given every
other day for 8 d starting at day of immunization.
BMMC Derivation, Activation, and Reconstitution. Bone marrow was harvested
from the femurs of 3- to 6-wk-old mice and cultured with 10 ng/mL
recombinant murine IL-3 (Miltenyi) and 12.5 ng/mL recombinant murine SCF
(Miltenyi) in complete RPMI for 6–8 wk. Purity was determined by flow
cytometry (>95% live cells coexpressing c-kit and FceRIα).
For mast cell activation assays, BMMCs (2 × 106 per well) were stimulated
for 6 h. BMMCs were preincubated with anti–DNP-IgE (2 μg/mL) for 16 h
before addition of DNP-HSA (10 ng/mL). Mtb was used at 100 μg/mL. Pooled
serum was collected from naïve or immunized mice using serum separator
tubes and 200 μL serum was added to BMMCs. Testosterone (Sigma) was
diluted in ethanol and used at the indicated concentrations. Flutamide
(Sigma) was diluted to 0.1 M in ethanol and used at a concentration of
100 nM. For mast cell reconstitution, 1 × 106 BMMCs were injected in-
tracranially into 3- to 5-wk-old SJL-KitW/Wv mice. After 8 wk, reconstitution
was confirmed by histological analysis of the peritoneum and meninges.
Meningeal Mast Cell Enumeration. Following perfusion, the calvarium was
dissected and fixed in formalin for 24 h before transfer and storage in PBS.
The calvarium was stained with acidic Toluidine blue for 15 s followed by
distilled water rinses. The meninges were separated from the calvarium while
submerged in distilled water and floated onto glass slides. Tissues were dried,
adhered to the slide, and covered with clear nail polish. The average number
of mast cells in 18 1-mm × 1-mm squares in six different regions was cal-
culated and expressed as mast cell number/mm2.
Serum Testosterone Analysis. For testosterone analyses, blood (∼100 μL) was
collected via tail snips at the indicated days post immunization from group-
housed males. The serum was isolated using Microtainer Serum Separation
tubes (BD) and serum testosterone levels were assessed using Parameter
testosterone immunoassay (R&D Systems). Five- to 8-wk-old SJL and C57BL/
6 mice were used for comparisons of serum testosterone in naïve mice.
Statistical Analysis. All statistics were performed using Prism 6 software
(GraphPad Software). Details of specific statistic analyses are included in the
corresponding figure legends.
Study Approval. Animal studies were approved by the Northwestern Uni-
versity Animal Care and Use committee.
