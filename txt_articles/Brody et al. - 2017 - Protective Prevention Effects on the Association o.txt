IMPORTANCE This study was designed to determine whether a preventive intervention
focused on enhancing supportive parenting could ameliorate the association between
exposure to poverty and brain development in low socioeconomic status African American
individuals from the rural South.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether participation in an efficacious prevention program
designed to enhance supportive parenting for rural African American children will ameliorate
the association between living in poverty and reduced hippocampal and amygdalar volumes
in adulthood.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In the rural southeastern United States, African
American parents and their 11-year-old children were assigned randomly to the Strong African
American Families randomized prevention trial or to a control condition. Parents provided
data used to calculate income-to-needs ratios when children were aged 11 to 13 years and 16
to 18 years. When the participants were aged 25 years, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes
were measured using magnetic resonance imaging.
EXPOSURES Household poverty was measured by income-to-needs ratios.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Young adults’ whole hippocampal, dentate gyrus, and CA3
hippocampal subfields as well as amygdalar volumes were assessed using magnetic
resonance imaging.
RESULTS Of the 667 participants in the Strong African American Families randomized
prevention trial, 119 right-handed African American individuals aged 25 years living in rural
areas were recruited. Years lived in poverty across ages 11 to 18 years forecasted diminished
left dentate gyrus (simple slope, −14.20; standard error, 5.22; P = .008) and CA3 (simple
slope, −6.42; standard error, 2.42; P = .009) hippocampal subfields and left amygdalar
(simple slope, −34.62; standard error, 12.74; P = .008) volumes among young adults in the
control condition (mean [SD] time, 2.04 [1.88] years) but not among those who participated
in the Strong African American Families program (mean [SD] time, 2.61 [1.77] years).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, we described how participation in a randomized
clinical trial designed to enhance supportive parenting ameliorated the association of years
lived in poverty with left dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal subfields and left amygdalar
volumes. These findings are consistent with a possible role for supportive parenting and
suggest a strategy for narrowing social disparities.

M
ore than 1 in 5 children in the United States live in
poverty.1 Poverty and other markers of disadvan-
tage are powerful variables that forecast develop-
mental trajectories, including cognitive development,2 psy-
chosocial development,3 and physical health4 throughout life.
As interest in the effects of poverty and disadvantage has
surged in the pediatric research community, a parallel litera-
ture has been developing in which scientists have begun to in-
vestigate the possibility that growing up in poverty, where
stressors are common and resources are scarce, will have im-
plications for the maturation of the hippocampus and amyg-
dala. These temporal lobe structures contribute to various fac-
ets of academic functioning and social development, and they
support learning, memory, mood, and stress reactivity.5 De-
spite the importance of the hippocampus and amygdala to
mental and physical health across the lifespan,6 little is actu-
allyknownaboutthewaysinwhichchildhoodexposuretopov-
erty is associated with their development.
Reports from initial investigations show diminished hip-
pocampal volumes among children living in poverty.7-12 These
reports mirror findings from animal models, which show hip-
pocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis to be greater
among mice and rats reared in stimulating environments com-
pared with those reared in relative deprivation.13 Results are
less clear for the amygdala. Childhood poverty has been found
to be associated with both larger11 and smaller9,10 amygdalar
volumes, and findings from animal models typically show as-
sociationsbetweenexposuretochronicstressandlargeramyg-
dalar volumes.14
Takentogether,thesefindingsunderscoretheneedforfur-
ther investigations of the association between childhood ex-
posure to poverty and the development of the hippocampus
and amygdala across time. The current study was designed to
address this issue using a longitudinal, prospective design to
determine whether duration of life in poverty across ages 11
to 18 years was associated with whole and subfield hippocam-
pal volumes and amygdalar volumes at age 25 years. Transla-
tional studies show that the key consequences of stress expo-
sure for the hippocampus are suppression of neurogenesis in
the dentate gyrus (GCL) and dendritic remodeling in the CA3
subfield.15,16 In children, exposure to stress is also associated
with smaller volumes in these subfields.17,18 Thus, this study
examined the hypothesis that exposure to poverty would be
associated with smaller volumes in the whole hippocampus,
the GCL and CA3 hippocampal subfields, and the amygdala.
However, not all children and adolescents who grow up in
poverty experience adverse consequences. Recent research
suggests that a subset of youths who receive supportive par-
enting develop resilience to the consequences of poverty and
low socioeconomic status environments. Studies show that
parenting that includes high levels of warmth, sensitivity, and
emotional support can offset many of the psychosocial disad-
vantages that beset children in poverty.19,20 Mounting evi-
dencealsorevealsthatsupportiveparentingcanfavorablymold
stress-response tendencies among vulnerable children.21 In
fact, supportive parenting may help mitigate some of the hor-
monal, metabolic, and cardiovascular changes that follow
childhood adversity. In particular, supportive parenting buf-
ferstheeffectsofpovertyonadolescents’allostaticload,amea-
sure of cardiometabolic risk.22 Such parenting also buffers the
effects of low childhood socioeconomic status on proinflam-
matory signaling profiles23 and metabolic profiles in
adulthood.24 Similarly, the benefits of supportive parenting
may extend to hippocampal and amygdalar development, as
vividly illustrated in a recent series of studies.25-27 Among chil-
dren reared in poverty, those who received supportive parent-
ing had larger hippocampal volumes than those who re-
ceived parenting that was not as supportive.
These are important findings. To the extent that they re-
flect a causal process in which supportive parenting offsets
some of the risks to brain maturation associated with pov-
erty, these findings have implications for numerous pediatric
research domains, including those focused on social dispari-
ties and resilience to adversity.28 However, causal inferences
cannot easily be made on the basis of existing studies be-
cause their observational designs are prone to residual con-
founding and reverse causal influences. Here, we avoid those
problems by conducting secondary analyses of data from the
Strong African American Families (SAAF) program, a random-
ized clinical trial.19 The SAAF program was designed to miti-
gate the negative effect of life stress on rural African Ameri-
canyouthsbyincreasingsupportiveparentingprocesses.29The
program has demonstrated stress-buffering capacities for a
range of psychosocial outcomes, such as self-control, drug use,
and conduct problems.30 It also has favorable effects on sev-
eral health-relevant biological processes, including inflamma-
tion, catecholamine levels, telomere lengths, and epigenetic
aging,31 all of which could, in turn, influence patterns of brain
development.5 Accordingly, in this study, we tested the hy-
pothesis that the cumulative number of years during which
African American youths lived in poverty across preadoles-
cence and adolescence would be associated with diminished
volumes in the whole hippocampus, the GCL and CA3 hippo-
campal subfields, and the amygdala among young adults who
had been randomly assigned to the control condition but not
young adults who had been assigned to the SAAF condition.

youths were aged 11 to 13 years and 16 to 18 years, caregivers
provided data that were used to calculate income-to-needs
ratios. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data
were obtained when the participants were aged 25 years to de-
termine the volumes of their whole hippocampi, GCL and CA3
hippocampal subfields, and amygdalae.
Methods
Participants
A total of 119 right-handed rural African American individu-
als aged 25 years were recruited from the 667 participants in
the SAAF randomized prevention trial. The SAAF sample was
recruited randomly from rural communities in Georgia when
the participants were aged 11 years (mean [SD] age at pretest,
11.2 [0.34] years29). At pretest, the SAAF sample could be char-
acterized as working poor; primary caregivers worked an av-
erage of 39.4 hours per week, yet 46.3% of the sample lived
below federal poverty standards. The data collected from par-
ticipantsaged25yearsincluded408participantsfromtheorigi-
nalSAAFsample,aretentionrateof61.2%across14years.Ran-
dom selection of the subsample of 119 participants to take part
in a neuroimaging session was made necessary by financial
constraints associated with imaging.
The subsample was selected randomly from a list of the
408 participants in the age 25 years assessment until the tar-
geted sample size was reached. All participants included in the
subsample were screened for standard imaging contraindica-
tions and right-handedness prior to enrollment. Three partici-
pants were excluded because of excess motion in MRI im-
ages. The remaining 116 participants were included in the
analyses. At age 11 years, 59 participants (50.9%) were as-
signed randomly to the SAAF condition and 57 (49.1%) were
assigned randomly to the control condition. A 2-factor multi-
variate analysis of variance was executed to evaluate the
equivalence of the demographic and study variables for par-
ticipants who did or did not take part in the imaging study at
age 25 years by prevention group assignment at age 11 years
(Table 1). No significant main or interaction effects emerged.
The University of Georgia Institutional Review Board re-
viewed and approved all study procedures, and all partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
SAAF Intervention Implementation
The SAAF prevention program consisted of 7 consecutive,
2-hour weekly meetings held at community facilities, with
separate skill-building curricula for youths and for their pri-
mary caregivers, and a family curriculum. Caregivers in the
prevention condition were taught the consistent provision
of instrumental and emotional support, high levels of moni-
toring and control, adaptive racial socialization strategies,
and methods for communicating about sex and alcohol use.
Youths learned the importance of forming goals for the
future and making plans to attain them, resistance efficacy
skills, and adaptive behaviors to use when encountering
racism.
Measures
Family Poverty
When participants were aged 11 to 13 years and 16 to 18 years,
caregivers provided data on their families’income-to-needs
ratios, based on family size, that were used to compute house-
hold poverty. Poverty statuses at 6 assessment waves were
summed to determine the number of years living below fed-
eral poverty guidelines (mean [SD], 2.30 [1.83]).
Intervention Status and Sex
Intervention status and sex were coded as follows: SAAF par-
ticipants were coded 1 and control participants were coded 0,
and male participants were coded 1 and female participants
were coded 0.

Psychosocial Variables
At age 25 years, participants reported their frequencies of ciga-
rette smoking and alcohol use in the past month. The response
sets ranged from 0 (“not at all”) to 6 (“about 2 packs a day”) for
cigarette smoking and from 0 (“none”) to 5 (“20 or more days”)
for alcohol use. Because the distributions for smoking and al-
coholusewereskewed,alogtransformationwasappliedtonor-

20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.32
Consistent with psychometric studies of the Center for Epide-
miologic Studies Depression Scale, 16 was used as the cutoff
score to identify clinically significant depression.
MRI Acquisition
Imaging data were collected using the Signa HDx 3-T scanner
(GE Health) at the University of Georgia Bio-Imaging Re-
search Center. Structural imaging consisted of a high-
resolution T1-weighted, fast-spoiled gradient echo scan (rep-
etition time, 7.8 milliseconds; echo time, 3.1 milliseconds; flip
angle, 20°; field of view, 25.6 cm; matrix, 256 × 256; 160 con-
tiguous 1-mm axial slices; voxel size, 1 mm3).

Results
Family Poverty, the Hippocampi, and the Amygdalae
Our initial analysis was designed to determine whether fam-
ily poverty was associated with hippocampal and amygdalar
volumes among young adults in the control condition. Pre-
sumably, young adults in the control condition displayed nor-
mative associations between family poverty and the volumes
of the hippocampi and amygdalae. Adjusted for sex and in-
tracranial volume, the results of partial correlations between
family poverty across time and the brain volumes of interest
were consistent with the first study hypothesis. Control par-
ticipants who spent more time in poverty evinced smaller left
amygdalae(r = −.296;P < .05),leftCA2/CA3(r = −.302;P < .05),
and left CA4/GCL (r = −.300; P < .05) than young adults who
spent less time in poverty. Family poverty was not associated
with right amygdalar, right CA2/CA3, or right CA4/GCL
volume.
Participation in SAAF, Family Poverty, and Volumes
of the Hippocampi and Amygdalae
Next, we tested the hypothesis that participation in SAAF
would ameliorate the association of family poverty with the
left amygdalar, left CA2/CA3, and left CA4/GCL volumes. To
do this, we executed hierarchical multiple regression analy-
ses that included main effects for family poverty, prevention
status(SAAF = 1;control = 0),andtheinteractionoffamilypov-
erty with prevention status. In all models, sex and intracra-
nial volume were controlled. Interactions were interpreted
through the plotting of estimated levels of hippocampal and
amygdalar volumes by years in poverty and prevention sta-
tus. The results of these analyses are presented in Table 2.

A main effect for family poverty and an interaction effect be-
tween family poverty and SAAF participation were found
(Figure). More time spent living in family poverty from ages
11 to 18 years was associated with a smaller left amygdala vol-
ume (simple slope, −34.615; standard error [SE], 12.744;
P = .008),asmallerleftCA2/CA3volume(simpleslope,−6.420;
SE,2.418;P = .009),andasmallerleftCA4/GCLvolume(simple
slope, −14.201; SE, 5.222; P = .008) among participants from
the control condition. Family poverty was not associated with
the volume of these regions among participants from the SAAF
condition (left amygdala: simple slope, 3.516; SE, 13.329;
P = .79; left CA2/CA3: simple slope, 0.599; SE, 2.529; P = .81;
and left CA4/GCL: simple slope, 1.577; SE, 5.462; P = .77).
To further describe the years in poverty × SAAF interac-
tion, we conducted planned group comparisons to test the hy-
pothesis that adolescents who spent more years living in pov-
erty and were assigned to the control condition would have
smaller mean left amygdala volumes and left CA2/CA3 and
CA4/GCL volumes than would similar youths assigned to the
SAAFconditionandyouthswhospentlesstimeinpovertywho
were assigned to either the SAAF or the control condition
(Table 3). The patterning of the means for each analysis con-
formed to the study hypothesis. Youths assigned to the con-
trol condition who spent more years during adolescence liv-
ing in poverty had smaller left amygdalar and left hippocampal
subfield volumes than did youths in the other 3 groups, who
did not differ from one another.
Hippocampal Subfield Volumes, Amygdalar Volumes,
and Psychosocial Functioning
To explore the significance of the study findings, we exam-
ined contemporaneous associations of the left hippocampal
subfield volumes and left amygdalar volume with depression
status, smoking, and alcohol use. To do this, we executed par-
tial correlations and adjusted them for sex, intracranial vol-
ume, and prevention condition (SAAF or control). A score of
16 or greater on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion Scale was associated with diminished left CA2/CA3 (r,
−0.245; P = .009) and left CA4/GCL (r, −0.215; P = .02) vol-
umes.Smokingwasassociatedwithdiminishedamygdalarvol-
umes(r,−0.225;P = .02).Noassociationswithalcoholusewere
found.
Discussion
Twoimportantfindingsemergedfromthisstudy.First,wecon-
firmed the association between childhood poverty and dimin-
ished volume of limbic regions in adulthood. These dimin-
ished volumes were significant to important outcomes, as the
associations between the hippocampal subfield volumes and
depression indicated. Second, we found evidence suggesting
that a parenting-focused intervention during early adoles-
cence attenuated associations between poverty and brain de-
velopment. These results, made possible by the embedding of
MRI assessments of hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in
a parenting-focused randomized prevention trial, increases
confidence in the causal nature of the linkages between sup-
portive parenting and brain maturation. Observational
research25-27 indicated that associations between living in pov-
erty and reductions in hippocampal volume could be offset by
supportive parenting processes. This study confirmed and ex-
tended those findings by demonstrating that exposure to pre-
vention programming at age 11 years could have lasting pro-
tective effects on brain development into adulthood. Of
relevance to pediatric clinical practice, efficacious family-
centered programs designed to enhance supportive parent-
ing are available for rural African American preadolescents,29
adolescents,30 and young adults.38 Participation in these pro-

The sample in this study was underpowered for detecting

to identify specific mediators. Candidate parenting processes
might include developmentally supportive emotional and in-
strumentalbehaviorsandhouseholdroutines,alongwithavoid-
ance of harsh and coercive parenting processes. Future re-
search should also examine the hypothesis that the SAAF
program helped to ameliorate the effect of stressors common
tofamiliescopingwitheconomichardship,suchasparentalde-
pression and family conflict, both of which have implications
for brain maturation.5 In past research, the SAAF program has
been shown to decrease both of these risk factors.30,31
Limitations
Several limitations of this study must be noted. First, the
SAAF trial was not designed to examine change in hippo-
campal and amygdalar volumes. We did not assess pretrial
hippocampal or amygdalar volumes; therefore, we could not
determine whether the volumes in these regions changed
differentially over time for members of the intervention and
control groups. At study entry, the SAAF and control groups
were similar in terms of family poverty, parental education,
family structure, parental age, and youth sex, suggesting
that randomization worked to minimize pretrial group dif-
ferences. These findings are consistent with the assumption
that the groups began the trial with similar hippocampal and
amygdalar volumes. Nevertheless, until pretest data become
available, conclusions about the capacity of the SAAF pro-
gram to influence changes in hippocampal and amygdalar
volumes must be viewed as tentative. Second, only dimin-
ished left-side hippocampal subfield and amygdalar vol-
umes were associated with poverty for control participants.
The reasons for this lateralized finding currently are not
clear, but these results are consistent with evidence of
diminished hippocampal volumes on the left side but not
the right side in adults with histories of childhood
adversity.39-41 Future research should be designed to deter-
mine whether links between exposure to poverty and later-
alized hippocampal and amygdalar volumes have delayed
effects that do not emerge until adulthood.42
Conclusions
This study provides further evidence of the association
between childhood poverty with brain development and
initial evidence that a family-oriented intervention may be
associated with a reduction in the effects of poverty. To the
extent that they are substantiated in future research,
these strategies may provide a means of narrowing social
disparities.
