IMPORTANCE High rates of suicide after psychiatric hospitalization are reported in many
studies, yet the magnitude of the increases and the factors underlying them remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES To quantify the rates of suicide after discharge from psychiatric facilities and
examine what moderates those rates.
DATA SOURCES English-language, peer-reviewed publications published from January 1, 1946,
to May 1, 2016, were located using MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and EMBASE with the search terms
((suicid*).ti AND (hospital or discharg* OR inpatient or in-patient OR admit*).ab and
((mortality OR outcome* OR death*) AND (psych* OR mental*)).ti AND (admit* OR admis* or
hospital* OR inpatient* OR in-patient* OR discharg*).ab. Hand searching was also done.
STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting the number of suicides among patients discharged from
psychiatric facilities and the number of exposed person-years and studies from which these
data could be calculated.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The meta-analysis adhered to Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. A random-effects model was used to calculate
a pooled estimate of postdischarge suicides per 100 000 person-years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The suicide rate after discharge from psychiatric facilities
was the main outcome, and the association between the duration of follow-up and the year
of the sampling were the main a priori moderators.
RESULTS A total of 100 studies reported 183 patient samples (50 samples of females, 49 of
males, and 84 of mixed sex; 129 of adults or unspecified patients, 20 of adolescents, 19 of
older patients, and 15 from long-term or forensic discharge facilities), including a total of
17 857 suicides during 4 725 445 person-years. The pooled estimate postdischarge suicide
rate was 484 suicides per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 422-555 suicides per 100 000
person-years; prediction interval, 89-2641), with high between-sample heterogeneity
(I2 = 98%). The suicide rate was highest within 3 months after discharge (1132; 95% CI,
874-1467) and among patients admitted with suicidal ideas or behaviors (2078; 95% CI,
1512-2856). Pooled suicide rates per 100 000 patients-years were 654 for studies with
follow-up periods of 3 months to 1 year, 494 for studies with follow-up periods of 1 to 5 years,
366 for studies with follow-up periods of 5 to 10 years, and 277 for studies with follow-up
periods longer than 10 years. Suicide rates were higher among samples collected in the
periods 1995-2004 (656; 95% CI, 518-831) and 2005-2016 (672; 95% CI, 428-1055) than in
earlier samples.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The immediate postdischarge period is a time of marked risk,
but rates of suicide remain high for many years after discharge. Patients admitted because of
suicidal ideas or behaviors and those in the first months after discharge should be a particular
focus of concern. Previously admitted patients should be able to access long-term care and
assistance.

uicide is among the top 20 causes of death worldwide.
The World Health Organization estimates that the global
age-standardized suicide rate was 11.4 per 100 000 per-
son-years in 2012.1 Most suicides occur in individuals with
mental illness,2 and virtually all mental disorders are associ-
ated with increased suicide-associated mortality.3 Mentally ill
persons who have been discharged from psychiatric hospi-
talsandwardsseemtohaveagreaterriskforsuicidethanother
mentally ill persons.4
The rate of suicide after discharge from psychiatric hos-
pitals and wards (referred to herein as postdischarge suicide)
is very high. A recent US study5 reported a suicide rate of 178
per 100 000 person-years in the first 3 months after dis-
charge, a figure that is approximately 15 times the US national
suicide rate. Studies6-9 from the United Kingdom and Nordic
countries with similar durations of follow-up after discharge
have reported higher suicide rates. Currently, there are no ac-
cepted benchmarks for postdischarge suicide rates.
A synthesis of the existing literature about rates of post-
discharge suicide would help quantify the extent of this issue
and would complement an earlier meta-analysis10 of risk fac-
tors for postdischarge suicide by estimating expected base
rates.Ameta-analysiscouldhelpclarifythetimecourseofpost-
discharge suicide risk and examine progress in reducing post-
discharge suicide.
The first aim of this study was to calculate a pooled esti-
mate and statistical dispersion (range, median, and interquar-
tile range) of postdischarge suicide rates. The second aim was
to explore whether the observed heterogeneity in postdis-
charge suicide rates was associated with the duration of fol-
low-up after discharge and the year in which the samples were
collected.Wealsoexploredpotentialassociationsbetweensui-
cide rates and a predetermined set of moderator variables de-
finedbydemographiccharacteristics,clinicalfactors,andstudy
methods.
Methods
We conducted a registered meta-analysis of rates of postdis-
charge suicides according to the Meta-analysis of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE)11 and Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA)12 guidelines.
Search Strategy
Two of us (D.T.C. and M.M.L.) independently searched
MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and EMBASE for relevant articles pub-
lished in English from January 1, 1946, to May 1, 2016, with
the search terms ((suicid*).ti AND (hospital or discharg* OR
inpatient or in-patient OR admit*).ab and ((mortality OR
outcome* OR death*) AND (psych* OR mental*)).ti AND (ad-
mit* OR admis* or hospital* OR inpatient* OR in-patient* OR
discharg*).ab (Figure 1). Electronic searches were supple-
mented by hand searches of the relevant review articles. Gray
literature was not considered. Two of us (D.T.C., M.M.L.)
independently winnowed titles, abstracts, and full-text
publications.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included studies that reported the number of suicides
among patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals or wards
and the number of person-years in which the suicides oc-
curred. We also included studies from which these data could
be calculated using the reported suicide rate, the mean length
of patient follow-up, or the duration of follow-up.
Studies of suicide attempts, community patients, and cur-
rent inpatients; conducted before 1950; and with discharge
from nonpsychiatric settings were excluded. Studies were ex-
cluded if the number of suicides and number of person-years
were not reported, could not be calculated, or could not be ob-
tained by email from the authors. When 2 studies reported
completely overlapping samples (eg, when one study was con-
ducted at a national level and another study was from a single
hospital in that country in the same period), the study with
fewer person-years was excluded. When 2 studies had partial
overlap, both studies were included if less than 20% of the par-
ticipants in the smaller study were included in the larger study.
Data Extraction
Two of us (D.T.C., M.M.L.) independently extracted the data.
When studies reported multiple samples, nonoverlapping
sampleswereselectedaccordingtoahierarchyofsex,agegroup
(adolescents, adults, and those >65 years of age), duration of
follow-up, year of the suicide, and diagnostic group, such that
noparticipantinanysinglestudywasincludedmorethanonce.
In some publications, the number of person-years could be cal-
culated using the number of suicides and reported suicide rate.
In other publications, the number of person-years was esti-
mated using the reported duration of follow-up.
A predetermined list of moderator variables was ex-
tracted for each sample: the duration of follow-up, the year or
midyear of data collection, the country in which the study was
conducted, sex (male, female, or mixed), age at discharge (ado-
lescent, adult, unspecified by age, >65 years of age), whether
the patients were discharged from long-term or forensic fa-
cilities, whether the patients were defined by an admission for
suicidality (defined as an admission associated with a suicide
Key Points
Questions What is the suicide rate after discharge from
psychiatric facilities, and what factors influence it?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 100 studies of 183 patient
samples, the postdischarge suicide rate was approximately
100 times the global suicide rate during the first 3 months after
discharge and patients admitted with suicidal thoughts or
behaviors had rates near 200 times the global rate. Even many
years after discharge, previous psychiatric inpatients have suicide
rates that are approximately 30 times higher than typical global
rates.
Meaning Although recently discharged patients and those who
were admitted because of suicidal ideas and behaviors are at
particular risk of suicide, all discharged patients have an enduring
high suicide rate and should have ongoing access to health care
resources.

 attempt or suicidal ideation), whether the samples were of pa-
tients followed up after their first psychiatric admission (first-
admission patients), and the psychiatric diagnosis (psycho-
sis, affective disorder, or mixed and other diagnoses). The
corresponding national suicide rate in the country during the
year of the study was obtained using World Health Organiza-
tion data for each sample.1
Strength of Reporting Scale
The strength of reporting of each study was assessed using a
5-point scale derived from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for as-
sessing the quality of nonrandomized studies.13 One point was
awarded if the study identified suicides by using coronersârec-
ords or a national mortality database (rather than using hos-
pital records), included all the postdischarge suicides in a de-
fined geographic region (rather than suicides from a particular
care setting), included open verdicts in suicide numbers, re-
ported the number of individuals (rather than the number of
discharges), or reported the number of person-years directly
or the mean length of patient follow-up from which the num-
ber of person-years could be calculated directly. Studies that
included open verdicts were regarded as being of higher qual-
ity because of evidence that open-verdict cases are often
regarded as suicides by researchers.14,15
Statistical Analysis
The suicide rate per patient-year was the effect size measure.
The pooled effect size was calculated using a random-effects
model because we considered that the different patient groups
in different countries during different periods were unlikely to
have a common effect size. The studies were weighted accord-
ing to their inverse variance, Ï2 was calculated using the Paule-
Mandelmethod,andthesuiciderateswerelogtransformedand
reportedinratesper100000person-years.Thesignificancetest
of the pooled suicide rate was conducted with a null hypoth-
esis of 11.4 events per 100 000 person-years. Between-study
heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q and I2 statis-
tics. Possible publication bias was tested by examination of the
funnel plot and by an Egger regression.16 The analysis was con-
ducted using R packages meta and metafor.17
Sources of between-sample heterogeneity were investi-
gatedusingsubgroupanalysiswithcategoricalmoderatorsand
meta-regression with continuous moderators. Continuous

erators examined using subgroup analysis and Cochran Q that

(Î±<.05) were entered into a mixed-effects multiple meta-
regression model. The length of follow-up was dichotomized
(â¤12 months coded as 1, >12 months coded as 0) for the pur-
pose of the multiple meta-regression.
Results
Searches and Data Extraction
A total of 142 full-text peer-reviewed publications met our
inclusion criteria before being examined for possible overlap-
ping participants (Figure 1). Two of us (D.T.C., M.M.L.) identi-
fied 113 of the 142 publications (79.6%). A total of 100 publica-
tions were included after the removal of overlapping studies
(eTable1intheSupplement).6-9,18-113Thesestudiesreported183
separate samples of discharged patients. Forty-two publica-
tions were excluded because of overlap with larger publica-
tions (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Of the 183 patient samples,
50wereoffemales,49wereofmales,and84wereofmixedsex
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). A total of 129 samples were of
adultsorunspecifiedpatients,20wereofadolescents(â¤18years
of age at the time of discharge), and 19 samples were of older
patients (â¥65 years of age at the time of discharge). Fifteen
samples were of patients discharged from long-term or foren-
sic facilities, and 23 samples were of first-admission patients.
Ninesampleswereofpatientswhohadbeenadmittedwithsui-
cidality. There were disagreements about 40 of the 366 data

by a second examination of the data (D.T.C., M.M.L.).

0-2822),andthemean(SD)numberofperson-yearspersample
was 25 822 (111 914) (median, 3534; range, 17-1 393 800). The
median sample suicide rate was 461 per 100 000 person-
years, with a range of 0 to 6259 per 100 000 person-years. The
interquartile range was 207 to 919 per 100 000 person-years.
The median duration of follow-up was 60 months (range,
1-432 months; interquartile range, 12-112 months). The earli-
est study68 reported a sample with a midpoint in 1967, the
median year of the samples was 1992, and the most recent
study99 reported suicides that occurred in 2014.
Twenty-seven samples were from Asian countries, 10
samples were from Australasia, 30 from mainland Europe, 40
from Nordic countries, 32 from North America, and 42 from
the United Kingdom or Ireland. There was 1 sample each from
Israel and Brazil.
Meta-analysis
The pooled rate of suicide after discharge was 484 per 100 000
person-years (95% CI, 422-555 per 100 000 person-years; pre-
diction interval, 89-2641; P < .001, assuming a null hypoth-
esis of 11.4 per 100 000 person-years) with very high between-
sample heterogeneity (n = 183, Q182 = 9768, P < .001, I2 = 98%,
Ï2 = 0.86). The pooled suicide rate among 18 samples with a
follow-up of 3 months or less was 1132 per 100 000 person-
years (95% CI, 874-1467 per 100 000 person-years; I2 = 93%)
and decreased thereafter in studies with follow-up of 3 to 12
months (654 [95% CI, 533-802]; 43 samples; I2 = 95%), 1 to 5
years (494 [95% CI, 354-688]; 44 samples; I2 = 96%), 5 to 10
years(366[95%CI,283-472];44samples;I2 = 97%),andgreater
than 10 years (277 [95% CI, 218-352]; 34 samples; I2 = 97%).
The duration of follow-up was significantly associated with
between-group heterogeneity (Q4 = 73.1; P < .001) (Figure 2).
More recently conducted studies had higher rates of sui-
cide per 100 000 person-years than older studies (2005-
2016: 672 [95% CI, 428-1055]; 27 samples; I2 = 98%; 1995 to
2004:656[95%CI,518-831];51samples;I2 = 99%;1985to1994:
404 [95% CI, 322-508]; 46 samples; I2 = 98%; 1975 to 1984; 373
[95%CI,279-498];47samples;I2 = 96%;before1975;423[95%
CI, 316-567]; 12 samples; I2 = 75%). The period of sample col-
lection was significantly associated with between-sample
heterogeneity (Q4 = 14.7; P = .005).
Difference in postdischarge suicide rates according to geo-
graphic region were not statistically significant (Q6 = 10.6;
P = .10) (Asia: 632 [95% CI, 434-921]; 27 samples; I2 = 95%;
Australasia: 423 [95% CI, 164-1090]; 10 samples; I2 = 96%;
MainlandEurope:502[95%CI,375-672];30samples;I2 = 96%;
Nordic countries: 562 [95% CI, 430-735]; 40 samples; I2 = 97%;
North America: 308 [95% CI, 220-430]; 32 samples; I2 = 94%;
United Kingdom and Ireland: 513 [95% CI, 410-642]; 42
samples; I2 = 98%; other: 261 [95% CI, 7-9940]; 2 samples;
I2 = 98%).
The suicide rate was lower among cohorts of adolescents
(158 per 100 000 person-years) compared with samples of
adults (555 per 100 000 person-years), patients from long-
term or forensic discharge facilities (487 per 100 000 person-
years), and older patients (496 per 100 000 person-years)
(Table 1). Samples of persons discharged after an admission
for suicidality (2078 per 100 000 person-years) had more than
4 times the suicide rate of other samples (452 per 100 000
person-years)(Table1).Ratesofsuicidewereloweramongfirst-
admission patients (305 per 100 000 person-years) (Table 1).

Publication Bias, Meta-regression,
and Multiple Meta-regression
The funnel plot was symmetrical and the Egger regression was
not significant (intercept, â0.27; t181 = â38; P = .70), suggest-
ing an absence of publication bias. Samples with longer dura-
tionsoffollow-upweremorelikelytoreportlowersuiciderates
(coefficient = â0.0049;95%CI,â0.0064toâ0.0034;z = â6.34;

ies reported higher suicide rates than older studies (coeffi-
cient = 0.02;95%CI,0.008-0.031;z = 3.40;P = .007).Thegen-
eral population suicide rate was not associated with rates of
suicide among discharged patients (coefficient = 0.0064; 95%
CI, â0.019 to 0.032; z = 0.49; P = .60).
Five moderators that were associated with between-
sample heterogeneity were included in a mixed-effects mul-
tiple meta-regression model (Table 2). More recent samples,
samples with follow-up of a year or less, and samples of
suicidal patients were independently associated with
higher postdischarge suicide rates. Samples of adolescent
patients were independently associated with lower rates.

Discussion
This study synthesizes more than half a century of research
into postdischarge suicide rates. We identified a large num-
ber of studies reporting more than 17 000 suicides in almost
5 million person-years at a pooled rate of 484 per 100 000 per-
son-years. This figure is more than 3 times the suicide rate es-
timated in a comparable study114 of the suicide rate among in-
patientsand44timestheglobalsuiciderateof11.4per100 000
patients per year in 2012.1 The suicide rate of studies that fol-
lowed up patients for no more than 3 months was 100 times
the global suicide rate. Studies with follow-up periods of 3 to
12 months had almost 60 times the global suicide rates, and
the suicide rate among discharged patients was more than 30
times that in the general population even for periods of
follow-up of 5 to 10 years.
Nordentoft et al115 recently described the phenomenon of
postdischarge suicide as a ânightmare and disgrace.
â115(p 1) We
agree; however, they formed this view in the light of a recent
study116 that found a rate of suicide of 178 per 100 000 pa-
tientsperyearduringthefirst3monthsafterdischarge.Ofnote,
our meta-analytic estimate during the same duration of
follow-up is more than 6 times higher.
Our data suggest that the suicide rates among discharged
patients have not decreased in the past 50 years. This is a dis-
turbing finding considering the increase in community psy-
chiatry and the availability of a range of new treatments dur-
ing this period. The increase that we observed in postdischarge
suicides can be seen in the context of the recent finding of a
more extreme increase in the suicide rate among current in-
patients from 68 per 100 000 person-years in the 1960s and
1970s to 646 per 100 000 person-years since 2000.114 An in-
crease in the suicide rate of admitted and discharged patients
might be attributable to multiple factors, including changing
legal and other criteria for admission, shorter lengths of inpa-
tient treatment, increased prevalence of substance use, and a
greater acuity of illness among those admitted in the era of
deinstitutionalization.114 Publication bias in favor of recent
studies from regions with a higher suicide rate might have also
contributed to the observed increase in suicide rates over time.
The marked variation in postdischarge suicide rates was
not fully explained by the duration of follow-up or the year of
the sample. Studies with similar periods of follow-up and stud-
ies conducted in the same or similar years have between-
study heterogeneity that is similar to that of the whole sample.
Limitations
Ourstudyhasanumberoflimitations,mostrelatingtothehigh
between-sample heterogeneity. Although we were able to ex-
plain some heterogeneity by using moderator variables, fur-
ther unexplained heterogeneity might be attributable to fac-
tors that were not reported in the primary research. Few of the
included studies reported comparisons of those who commit-
ted suicide with those who survived, and information about
the psychiatric care that the patients received in hospital or af-
ter discharge was absent. For example, the included studies
did not report on the extent of any association between read-
missionandsuicide.Theassociationbetweenreadmissionand
suicide might matter because we found that samples of first-
admission patients had a lower postdischarge suicide rate than
samples of patients with a mix of first-time and previous pa-
tients. This finding suggests that readmission might be an im-
portant suicide risk factor.
Other limitations relate to the representativeness of the in-
cluded studies. Almost all the research came from high-
income economies of Asia, Australasia, North America, and
Europe, and our results might not be representative of post-
discharge suicide in low- and middle-income countries. Even
the pooled results that we obtained from our 6 regions were
heterogeneous and should not be considered to be a general-
izable benchmark for all psychiatric hospital settings in high-
income countries.
Furthermore,factorsthatareassociatedwithincreasedsui-
cide risk at an aggregate level should be interpreted cau-
tiously and are not necessarily applicable to individual pa-
tients. For example, we found that samples of older patients
had a higher suicide rate than samples of adolescents, whereas
a meta-analysis10 of risk factors for suicide after discharge
found that older age was not associated with an increased sui-
cide risk. Likewise, we found that samples of patients with af-
fective disorders did not have a particularly high suicide rate,
whereas the earlier meta-analysis10 found an association be-
tween suicide and depressive symptoms and disorders.
Finally, our study did not estimate the suicide rate in the
days immediately after discharge. Some studies117,118 have sug-
gested that the days immediately after discharge are the pe-
riod of the highest suicide risk, but our methods yielded in-
sufficientnumbersofsamplestorobustlyestimatesuiciderates
during periods of less than 3 months. It is likely that rates of
suicide in the initial period after discharge are substantially
higher than the rate we report during the 3 months.
Conclusions
It has been argued that a way of combatting postdischarge sui-
cide is to focus on individual patients with clinical character-
istics that signify a high suicide risk.119,120 However, the very
high suicide rates calculated in this study and the known limi-
tations of suicide risk assessment116,121 suggest that a focus on
clinical risk assessment might mislead clinicians into think-
ing that some patients can be regarded as having low risk af-
ter discharge.115 Our findings better support the views of au-
thors who believe in a more universal approach to suicide
prevention that might focus on periods of high risk but that
extends for periods of years.116 However, the findings should
curb enthusiasm for restrictive interventions directed at pa-
tients labeled as having high risk of suicide by virtue of demo-
graphic or clinical variables. Our figures suggest that 0.28% of
all discharged patients can be expected to commit suicide dur-
ing the first 3 months after discharge. The modest statistical
strength of suicide risk assessment means that even patients

 who are classified as having high risk because of their suicide
risk factors122 will have a low absolute probability of suicide
over clinically meaningful time frames, whereas patients with
a low risk for suicide will still have a probability of suicide that
is many times that in the general community.
Discharged patients have suicide rates many times that
in the general community. Efforts aimed at suicide preven-
tion should start while patients are in hospital, and the
period shortly after discharge should be a time of increased
clinical focus. However, our study also suggests that previ-
ously admitted patients, particularly those with prior suicid-
ality, remain at a markedly elevated risk of suicide for years
and should be a focus of efforts to decrease suicide in the
community.
