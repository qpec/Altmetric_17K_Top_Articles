ip fracture repair that is delayed more than 24 hours after 
hospital presentation is associated with increased medical 
complications1 and health care costs.2,3 Despite known 
consequences for delays, it is unknown how long patients wait for 
hip fracture repair and other urgent and emergent procedures 
across Canada.4 Studies about urgent and emergent surgical wait 
times have been conducted at single centres,3,5–10 and time was 
measured imprecisely.11–14 Although variables capturing exact wait 
times from hospital arrival were introduced to Canadian hospital 
discharge abstracts in 2009, studies have not used these data to 
describe and evaluate wait times for urgent surgery.1,14,15
We investigated these new time-to-surgery data among a 
population-based cohort of patients requiring surgery for hip 
fracture, the most common urgently performed surgical proced-
ure in Canada.16 Our objectives were to use these data to meas-
ure wait times for surgery for hip fracture, identify modifiable 
factors influencing them, and determine whether variation is due 
to treatment by different hospitals or physicians, or both.
Methods
Data sources and setting
We conducted a population-based cross-sectional cohort study of 
patients with hip fractures who were treated in Ontario. Data were 
obtained from several administrative databases linked at the Insti-
tute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES, www.ices.on.ca). These 
databases have been used previously to study patients with hip frac-
ture,12,17–19 in which sensitivity and positive predictive values for 
diagnosis of hip fracture are 95% (Appendix 1A, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170830/-/DC1).20 We chose 
to study hip fractures because surgery for hip fracture is the most 
common urgently performed procedure in Canada,16 and wait times 
are already used as quality-of-care indicators worldwide.21–23

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Although a delay of 
24 hours for hip fracture repair is associ-
ated with medical complications and 
costs, it is unknown how long patients wait 
for surgery for hip fracture. We describe 
novel methods for measuring exact urgent 
and emergent surgical wait times (in 
hours) and the factors that influence them.
METHODS: Adults aged 45 years and 
older who underwent surgery for hip 
fracture (the most common urgently 
performed procedure) in Ontario, Can-
ada, between 2009 and 2014 were eligi-
ble. Validated data from linked health 
administrative databases were used. 
The primary outcome was the time 
elapsed from hospital arrival recorded in 
the National Ambulatory Care Reporting 
System until the time of surgery record 
ed 
in the Discharge Abstract Database (in 
hours). The influence of patient, phys-
ician and hospital factors on wait times 
was investigated using 3-level, hier 
arch-
ical linear regression models.
RESULTS: Among 42 230 patients with 
hip fracture, the mean (SD) wait time for 
surgery was 38.76 (28.84) hours, and 
14 174 (33.5%) patients underwent sur-
gery within 24 hours. Variables strongly 
associated with delay included time for 
hospital transfer (adjusted increase of 
26.23 h, 95% CI 25.38 to 27.01) and time 
for preoperative echocardiography 
(adjusted increase of 18.56 h, 95% CI 
17.73 to 19.38). More than half of the 
hospitals (37 of 72, 51.4%), compared 
with 4.8% of surgeons and 0.2% of anes-
thesiologists, showed significant differ-
ences in the risk-adjusted likelihood of 
delayed surgery.
INTERPRETATION: Exact wait times for 
urgent and emergent surgery can be 
measured using Canada’s administrative 
data. Only one-third of patients received 
surgery within the safe time frame (24 h). 
Wait times varied according to hospital 
and physician factors; however, hospital 
factors had a larger impact.

Mar. 31, 2014, to be eligible. Accrual began when exact surgery 
start times were introduced in the databases utilized, enabling 
us to calculate precise wait times for each patient (in hours) in 
the cohort.15 We excluded patients aged 45 years and younger, as 
well as others unrepresentative of patients with osteoporotic hip 
fractures, consistent with prior1,2 and ongoing24 hip fracture 
research (Supplementary Table 1, Appendix 1B, contains the full 
list of exclusion criteria).
Outcome measure
The primary dependent variable was the total time elapsed (in 
hours) between arrival at the emergency department (at the first 
hospital, if interfacility transfer occurred)25 recorded in the National 
Ambulatory Care Reporting System and surgery for hip fracture 
recorded in the Discharge Abstract Database. We assessed the rela-
tive contribution of specific phases of care to observed wait times 
by calculating separately the time spent in the emergency depart-
ment, during hospital transfer and after hospital admission.
For each patient, we recorded acute conditions that may 
bene 
fit from medical treatment (and delay) before surgery. Spe-
cific conditions were taken from the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence 124 guideline.26
We assessed several characteristics previously shown to influ-
ence surgical delays in other single-centre studies, including age, 
sex and medical comorbidity.3,5–10 Characteristics determined 
after surgery were not considered, even if these factors were sur-
rogates for patient case mix, such as surgery duration, discharge 
disposition or length of stay.27 Comorbidities listed on hospital 
discharge abstracts in the 5 years before the patient’s hip 
 
fracture were categorized according to the Deyo–Charlson 
Co 
morbidity Index.28 Previously validated algorithms identified 
frail patients29 and those with diabetes,30 hypertension,31 chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease,32 congestive heart failure, cor-
onary artery disease33 or polytrauma (defined as an Injury Sever-
ity Score ≥ 16) at the time of their injury. We used median neigh-
bourhood household income quintiles as a proxy for 
socioeconomic status,34–36 and we identified patients residing in 
rural areas using the Rurality Index of Ontario.36 We also consid-
ered antiplatelet and anticoagulant prescriptions dispensed to 
patients within 1 year before surgery for those with Ontario Drug 
Benefit coverage (i.e., all those > 65 years of age).37 Each fracture 
and procedure type were recorded.
We assessed and assigned physician- and hospital-related 
factors at the time of each patient’s operation. These included 
years since each surgeon’s Canadian orthopedic certification 
(“surgeon experience”) and the number of hip fracture proced-
ures performed in the year preceding the index event (“surgeon 
and hospital volume”). Each hospital’s capacity for performing 
nonelective surgery was operationalized as the average daily 
number of any nonelective (or “urgent”) procedures performed 
at the hospital, orthopedic or otherwise, in the year preceding 
the index event. Hospitals were also categorized as being either 
‘‘academic,’’ “large community” or “small/medium community” 
(> 400 or < 400 beds, respectively).38 We identified patients 
directly transferred from other hospitals and other health care 
institutions (e.g., long-term care) by standard protocols.25 The 
time of hospital arrival was categorized as “working hours” 
8 am–4 pm, “evening” 4 pm–12 pm, or “overnight” 12 mid-
night–8 am, and “weekend” or “weekday.”  We also described 
the proportion of surgical procedures occurring overnight 
(12 midnight–8 am) using surgeon billing codes.19,39 Finally, we 
recorded preoperative internal medicine consultations, anesthe-
sia consultations and echocardiograms that occurred between 
hospital arrival and the time of surgery.
Statistical analysis
We used simple (single-level) linear regression to relate the 
above predictors (“potential factors influencing wait times for 
surgery”) to surgical wait times, analyzed as a continuous vari-
able in hours.40–42 We used standardized β coefficients with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) to report increases and decreases in 
wait times (in hours) associated with each predictor variable. We 
also used 3-level hierarchical linear regression models to explore 
the relative contribution of physician and hospital factors to vari-
ation in wait times. The random-effects output from this model 
provided each physician’s and hospital’s unique adjusted wait 
time difference compared with the cohort average (i.e., increase 
or decrease in adjusted wait time [in hours] and 95% CI). We per-
formed the physician-level analysis twice, considering surgeons 
and anesthesiologists in separate models that were cross- 
classified to account for physicians working at more than 1 hos-
pital (Appendix 1C).43,44
To quantify the relative effect of individual physicians and 
hospitals on variability in wait times, we measured the propor-
tion of physicians and hospitals that were “outliers” compared 
with their peers. “Low outliers” — physicians and hospitals with 
wait times significantly lower than average — were those with 
upper limits of the 95% CI wait time less than 0. Conversely, 
“high outliers” — physicians and hospitals with wait times that 
were significantly longer than average — were those with lower 
limits of their 95% CI wait time greater than 0.45,46 To validate the 
effect of individual physicians and hospitals on variability in wait 
times, we reran the 3-level hierarchical regression model with 
clinical outcomes (30-d mortality, surgical complications) and 
medical costs in place of wait times (Appendix 1D).
All analyses were performed on linked, coded data at the 
Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences using SAS software (SAS 
version 9.3, SAS Institute), and we set type I error probability to 
0.05. We excluded patients with missing data (< 1% for all vari-
ables considered [Table 1]) from the regression models.
Ethics approval
The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board 
at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto.
Results
We included 42 230 patients in our study. These patients were 
treated by 522 surgeons and 963 anesthesiologists from 72 hos-
pitals. Patient mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 
80.77 (SD 10.67) years and most were female (n = 29 759, 70.5%). 
Mean wait time for surgery after arrival at the emergency

department was 38.76 (SD 28.84) hours. Mean time spent in the 
emergency department was 7.58 (SD 11.87) hours. Almost half of 
all patients received a preoperative internal medicine consultation 
(n = 20 781, 49.2%), 11 410 (27.0%) received a preoperative anes-
thesia consultation, and 2354 (5.6%) underwent an echocardio-
gram before surgery. Nearly 1 in 5 patients older than 65 years 
(18.9%) were prescribed antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications 
within a year before their hip fracture. About 9% (n = 4136) of 
patients presented for surgery with an acute condition that may 
have benefitted from medical treatment (and delay) before sur-
gery. Other characteristics of the cohort are displayed in Table 1.
Although most patients (> 75%) were admitted to hospital 
within 6 hours of presentation at the emergency department 
(mean 7.58 h [SD 11.87]), only 14 174 (33.5%) received surgery 
within the recommended time frame (24 h) (Figure 1).1,47,48 The 
proportion of patients with hip fracture is also reported by their 
time of presentation, admission and surgery in Appendix 2, avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170830/-/
DC1. Whereas 5837 patients (13.8%) arrived overnight, only 
441 patients (1.0%) received surgery during this time.
Results of the linear regression model relating potential risk 
factors to delayed surgery are shown in Table 2. Patient transfer 
for surgery was associated with more than 1 day of additional 
delay for surgery (adjusted increase of 26.23 h, 95% CI 25.38 to 
27.01). Preoperative consultations by internal medicine 
(adjust 
ed increase of 6.43 h, 95% CI 6.06 to 6.80) and anesthesia

(adjusted increase of 5.90 h, 95% CI 5.48 to 6.33), as well as pre-
operative echocardiography (adjusted increase of 18.56 h, 
95% CI 17.73 to 19.38) were also associated with significant 
delays after adjustment.
Results of our hierarchical linear regression models are shown 
in Figures 2A–C. More than half of the hospitals (37 of 72, 51.4%) 
showed significant differences in the likelihood of delays in sur-
gery for hip fracture that were not attributable to patient case 
mix and physician random effects (Figure 2A). Conversely, only 
25 of 522 (4.8%) surgeons and 2 of 963 (0.2%) anesthesiologists 
were outliers or significantly different in their likelihood of per-
forming delayed surgery after adjustment for patient and hospi-
tal factors. Similarly, adjusted odds of mortality, surgical compli-
cations and medical costs varied between hospitals (9.7%, 16.7% 
and 38.8% were outliers for each outcome, respectively) but not 
between physicians (no surgeons and anesthesiologists were sig-
nificantly different for these outcomes) (Appendix 1D).
Interpretation
Wait times varied significantly depending on where patients 
were treated, with more than half of hospitals (51.4%) showing 
significant differences in the likelihood of delayed surgery for hip 
fracture that was not attributable to patient or physician factors. 
Transfers, preoperative consultations, echocardiography and 
prescriptions for anticoagulants are important and modifiable 
causes of delay. Two-thirds (66%) of the participants did not 
receive surgery within the safe time frame (24 h).1,47,48 Variation 
within Ontario’s public health care system warrants performance 
improvement at the hospital level.
Variation in wait times was attributable to treatment at differ-
ent hospitals, as opposed to treatment by different phys 
icians. 
As such, initiatives for quality improvement may target hospital-
level processes preferentially rather than individual physician 
practices. In contrast, and contrary to calls for physician-level 
reporting,50–52 the finding that wait times, clinical outcomes and 
costs were similar between physicians after accounting for 
patient and hospital factors suggests such reporting may be 
less informative than hospital-level information. Examples of 
 
hospital-level interventions include medical and surgical 
comanagement models,53 and policies for preoperative consul-
tations, echocardiography and anticoagulant reversal,10 which 
may ensure that coordinated care does not compromise the 
provision of timely surgery. Policies between hospitals should 
also address patients who require transfer for surgery, balan-
cing the risk of treatment at smaller centres38 with delays associ-
ated with these transfers, both of which are known risk factors 
for mortality.38,54,55 A successful surgical coverage algorithm in 
this regard was developed in Manitoba, where rural hospitals 
were matched to surgical hospitals that agreed to accept 
patients from rural areas regardless of bed availability.10 Other 
solutions may be to designate “urgent surgical centres”56 with

Figure 2: (A) Mean differences (in h, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for each hospital from the average surgical delay in the cohort was estimated in a 3-level 
linear regression model, adjusted for patient case mix and surgeon random effects. We classified hospitals that were significantly more likely to have early sur-
gery performed as “low” outliers (green) and those that were significantly more likely to have delayed surgery performed as “high” outliers (red). More than half 
of the hospitals (37 of 72, 51.4%) showed significant differences in the likelihood of delayed surgery not attributable to patient case mix (1 hospital fell outside the 
graph area (estimate = +90.1 h, 95% CI 77.2 to 103.0). We conducted the analysis for 42 025 patients (missing observations were excluded). (B) Mean differences 
(in h, with 95% CIs) for each surgeon from the average surgical delay in the cohort was estimated in a 3-level linear regression model, adjusted for patient case 
mix and hospital random effects. We classified surgeons who were significantly more likely to perform early surgery as “low” outliers (green) and those who were 
significantly more likely to perform delayed surgery as “high” outliers (red). Only 4.8% of the surgeons (25 of 522) showed significant differences in the likelihood 
of delayed surgery not attributable to patient case mix or hospital random effects. We conducted the analysis for 42 025 patients (missing observations were 
excluded). (C) Mean differences (in h, with 95% CIs) for each anesthesiologist from the average surgical delay in the cohort was estimated in a multilevel linear 
regression model, adjusted for patient case mix and hospital random effects. We classified anesthesiologists who were significantly more likely to enable early 
surgery as “low” outliers (green) and those who were significantly more likely to enable delayed surgery as “high” outliers (red). Only 0.2% of anesthesiologists 
(2 of 963) showed significant differences in the likelihood of delayed surgery not attributable to patient case mix or hospital random effects. We conducted the 
analysis for 11 343 patients who had preoperative anesthesia consultations (missing observations were excluded).

catchment areas large enough to sustain consistent daytime 
nonelective surgery volumes57 or to transfer patients to hospi-
tals with available operating rooms. 
Canadian surgeons may wait until after their elective pro-
cedures are completed before operating on urgent surgical 
patients. The finding that wait times for weekends were shorter 
is contrary to reports from other countries, and indirect evidence 
of this practice. That less than 5% of surgeons and less than 1% 
of anesthesiologists showed significant differences in delays is 
evidence that physicians may not be doing (or cannot do) 
enough to improve wait times for their patients. Policy that guar-
antees elective cases would be completed later in the day, even if 
nonelective cases are prioritized before them, may improve wait 
times for urgent procedures without the need to increase capa-
city in operating rooms.
We also found that reporting wait times from arrival at the 
emergency department is feasible because only 3% of patients 
were missing these data, and the time spent waiting in hospital 
transfer and the emergency department (mean 7.58 h 
[SD 11.87]) can be measured, which may provide another target 
for improved patient flow. An advantage of these Canadian data 
compared with data from the United States is the ability to cap-
ture exact wait times in hours (versus days) and the time 
elapsed in transfer between hospitals.48,58 Other potential appli-
cations of these data include more accurately identifying after-
hours  
surgery,19 durations of surgery59 and overlapping surgical 
procedures.1,60,61
Limitations
Although specific reasons for delay could not be assessed in the 
data that were sampled, risk-adjusted differences observed 
between hospitals should not reflect clinical reasons, but rather 
processes of care at different hospitals. Furthermore, because 
 
only about 9% of patients presented with acute medical condi-
tions that warranted delay, the scenario of rushing patients to 
surgery despite suspicious symptoms appears to be the excep-
tion rather than the rule. We have described new time variables 
that identify exact wait times (in hours) in Canada’s administra-
tive data.15 The variables have high face validity, including 
detecting differences when they were expected, such as longer 
delays among patients with comorbidity.5–10 Missing data for 
emergency department arrival times were uncommon (n = 1460 
or < 3%) and likely represented patients transferred from other 
health care institutions directly to inpatient beds. There were no 
missing data for surgery start times, which are used by Ontario’s 
Surgical Efficiency Targets Program.49
Conclusion
Exact wait times for urgent and emergent surgery can be meas-
ured in Canada’s administrative data. Only one-third of patients 
with hip fracture received surgery within the safe time frame 
(24 h). Because wait times vary according to where patients are 
treated, reporting and improvement efforts at the hospital level 
are required to ensure timely provision of urgent surgery for hip 
fracture. Reporting on physician performance, in contrast, may 
be less informative.
