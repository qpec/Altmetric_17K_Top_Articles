by nation-wide cancer registry:
a population-based study

Abstract
Background: Malignant mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure has a long latency period. A ban on asbestos
use may not be apparent in decreased incidence in the population until after several decades. The aim was to
evaluate changes in the incidence of malignant mesothelioma, and the possible impact of the asbestos ban
implemented in Iceland in 1983.
Methods: This is a population study on aggregate level; the source of data was the Icelandic Cancer Registry, the
National Cause-of-Death Registry, and the National Register. Volume of asbestos import was obtained from Customs
Tariff. The import figures reflect fairly accurately the amount used, as there are no mines in the country.
Results: Asbestos import peaked in 1980 at 15.0 kg/capita/year, diminishing to 0.3 kg/capita/year ten years after the
ban in 1983, and to zero in the most recent years. Seventy-nine per cent of the cases of malignant mesothelioma were
men, and 72 % were of pleural origin. Mesothelioma incidence increased steadily from 1965 to 2014, when it reached
21.4 per million among men, and 5.6 among women. Mortality in 2014 was 22.2 per million among men, and 4.8
among women.
Conclusion: Malignant mesothelioma incidence and mortality increased in the population during the period, despite
the ban on asbestos use from 1983. This is in agreement with the long latency time for malignant mesothelioma. In
line with the previously high per capita volume of asbestos import, many buildings, equipment, and structures contain
asbestos, so there is an on-going risk of asbestos exposure during maintenance, renovations and replacements. It is thus
difficult to predict when the incidence of malignant mesothelioma will decrease in the future. During the last ten-year
period, the incidence in Iceland was higher than the recently reported incidence in neighbouring countries.

Background
Malignant mesothelioma is a cancer of mesothelial serosa;
its primary location is pleura, peritoneum, pericardium,
and tunica vaginalis. Since the association between malig-
nant mesothelioma and asbestos exposure was first des-
cribed by Wagner and co-workers in 1960 [1], it has been
established and recognized that asbestos is the dominant
cause of malignant mesothelioma, according to studies
from several national mesothelioma registries [2–5].
Today, all types of asbestos, chrysotile, crocidolite,
amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite are
considered causes of human malignant mesothelioma
according to the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) report [6] where epidemiological, ex-
perimental, and mechanistic studies have been evaluated.
Chrysotile asbestos was the last type to be definitively
included as a cause of malignant mesothelioma [7–9]. The
time from first exposure to asbestos until diagnosis of
malignant mesothelioma is called the induction/latency
time. This period can be from 20 to 50 years [10–12], with
a shorter latency in the heavily exposed population and
longer latency among groups with low-level exposure.

 In the case of crocidolite exposed cohort the risk of
malignant mesothelioma increases from 10–15 years
following first exposure and persists for as long as the
exposed persons survive, however stops increasing after
30–40 years [13]. The long latency period poses difficulties
in occupational studies; however the risk of malignant
mesothelioma caused by asbestos is dose-dependent
[4, 14, 15], and malignant mesothelioma occurs at very
low-level exposure, indeed lower than the eight-hour
occupational threshold limit value generally established
at 0.1 fibre/ml air, and no safe dose has been found, below
which there is no risk of malignant mesothelioma [16].
In addition to asbestos exposure, other casual associa-
tions with malignant mesothelioma include radiation treat-
ment for Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
[17, 18]. Malignant mesothelioma has also been found as a
second cancer among testis and prostate cancer patients
treated with radiotherapy [19, 20]. At one time, the Simian
Virus 40 was thought to play a role in the aetiology of
malignant mesothelioma; however, according to IARC,
there is inadequate evidence to consider Simian Virus 40 a
carcinogen to humans [21]. Erionite is a fibrous mineral
belonging to a group of minerals called zeolite and fluoro-
edenite another type of fibrous mineral have been associ-
ated with malignant mesothelioma in specific areas in
Turkey, Mexico and Sicily [22–25]. Erionite is classified as
a human carcinogen according to IARC [6], and is widely
prevalent in the US [26] and in Iceland [27].
Mortality information on mesothelioma is compiled
internationally in the WHO database [28]. Information
on the incidence of malignant mesothelioma is commonly
obtained from special national malignant mesothelioma
registers [2–5], or the cancer registry, Surveillance, Epi-
demiology, and End Results (SEER) [29]. Where cancer
registries and special occupational disease registries can
be compared on the national level, the cancer registries
show numerical superiority compared with the occupa-
tional disease registries, as reported in studies from some
Scandinavian countries [30–33]. The setting in Iceland,
where the cancer registry was established in 1955 [34],
and where there is access to comprehensive population
registries as well as general use of a personal identifier,
provides an opportunity to study malignant mesothelioma
incidence.
The aim of the study was to describe the long-term
changes in incidence of malignant mesothelioma up to
2014, and to evaluate the possible impact of the asbestos
ban implemented in 1983.
Methods
This is a population-based observational study and the
source of data was the Icelandic Cancer Registry. The
registry is nation-wide and includes all cases of cancer
since 1955 [34]. The registry has virtually complete
coverage, and over 95 % of diagnoses are histologically
confirmed [34, 35]. We asked for information from the
registry on all cases of cancer with ICD-10 code C45
mesothelioma (the accurate location was read from the
decimal figure, pleura, peritoneum, and other and un-
specified sites), and ICD-O codes 9050, 9051, 9052, and
9053, mesothelioma, with the behaviour code /3, malig-
nant, primary site. Different versions of the ICD were in
use during the operation of the registry, and they were
standardized by the registry to ICD-10. Besides the in-
formation on the location and morphology of the cases,
we obtained information on encrypted personal identifi-
cation number, gender, age, year and age at diagnosis.
The registry does not routinely collect information on
occupational or environmental exposure, or survival of
the reported cancer cases.
Statistics Iceland maintains the National Cause-of-
Death Registry [36]. The registry is nation-wide and in-
cludes causes of death according to death certificates.
The ICD-10 code C45 was available for 1996–2014.
Three broad categories of exposure to asbestos have
been described. The first is for miners and millers of raw
asbestos and people employed by manufacturers of as-
bestos products, such as asbestos cement factories, often
associated with heavy exposure. The second category is
for workers such as carpenters, plumbers, shipbuilders, ma-
chine engineers, and insulators who use asbestos products,
and other less-exposed occupations such as seamen, fisher-
men, and various factory workers. The third category is for
groups and individuals with short-term or low-level ex-
posure to asbestos, often non-occupational, including
family members of asbestos workers, people living near
an asbestos industry, and those dwelling or working in
buildings containing asbestos. Asbestos production or
mining activities have never occurred in Iceland, so the
asbestos exposure in question would be of the second cate-
gory, involving, for example, the building industry, fishing,
and geothermal industry, and of the third category.
Information on the volume of annual import of asbes-
tos and goods containing asbestos was obtained from
Statistics Iceland [36], according to Customs Tariff, the
Directorate of Customs [37], codes under 2524, 6811,
6812, 6813, and 8708 with mention of asbestos, and cor-
responding codes from older versions of the Customs
Tariffs. The amount of asbestos in the Customs Tariff
was declared in metric tons and types of asbestos were
not indicated.
To estimate the incidence rates for malignant meso-
thelioma, the numerator used was the number of cases
during ten-year periods 1965–1974, 1975–1984, 1985–
1994, 1995–2004, and 2005–2014, with the corresponding
population figures of those 15 years of age or older [38]
obtained from Statistics Iceland [36]. The ten-year
rates were compared with the rate in the first period

 1965–1974, calculating relative risk (RR), and 95 %
confidence intervals (CI). Similarly, the mortality rates
were estimated in eight- and ten-year periods 1996–2004,
and 2005–2014.
The incidence rates, 95 % CI of the rates, and statis-
tical analyses were performed using the software packet
Epi-Info, and Microsoft Excel 7.
The National Bioethics Committee (VSNb2010150400
06/03.03) approved the study, and the Data Protection
Commission was notified of the study and did not make
remarks on the way it was conducted.
Results
Information on the annual import of asbestos was avail-
able for the period 1976 to 2014, and is shown in Fig. 1.
Import volume peaked in the year 1980 at 3500 tons,
corresponding to 1500 tons per 100,000 inhabitants, or
15.0 kg/capita/year of asbestos. This huge import coin-
cided with extensive construction of district heating sys-
tems, where the main feeding pipes consisted of asbestos
cement pipes, and geothermal hot water was piped 20 to
50 km into houses of communities with greater than
10,000 inhabitants. The ban against asbestos use with
certain exceptions was implemented in 1983, and that
year, import volume decreased considerably, to increase
again over a five-year period, and peaking again in 1992
with 800 tons, corresponding to 299 tons per 100,000, or
0.3 kg/capita/year of asbestos. We do not have an explan-
ation for this temporary increase in asbestos import; how-
ever, it is clear that this volume involves asbestos cement
used in building materials and pipes, or similar articles, as
friction material in brake linings and clutches, and fabri-
cated asbestos fibres seldom exceeded 20–30 tons per year
in the early period, and did not ever reach an annual
volume of one ton during the last ten years of the period.
In table 1, the number of cases of malignant meso-
thelioma, ten-year annual incidence rates and 95 %
confidence intervals, are shown for men and women.
Among men, the rates increase steadily through this 50
-year period; however, the changes over the period are
not straightforward for women, where the rates are
low, and no cases occur in the period 1975–1984.

 Table 2 shows age distribution of malignant mesotheli-
oma cases by gender, with the highest number in the age
group 70 to 79. In table 3, location and histological diag-
nosis are shown by gender. In ninety-seven per cent of
cases among men, the mesothelioma is located in the
pleura, but among women, 56 % is pleura and 44 % is
located in peritoneum. Malignant mesothelioma NOS
(M-9050/3) is the dominant histological type for both
genders.
In table 4, the number of deaths due to malignant
mesothelioma according to death certificates, and annual
mortality rates is shown by gender. The period available
for mortality was 18 years, and no obvious increase over
this short observational period and limited volume of
data is noted. However, the rates and the RR were high.
Table 5 shows again the number of cases per ten-year
periods through 1965 to 2014, and the relative risk,
where the first ten-year period, 1965–1974 is the reference.
Among men, the relative risk increases over the years, and
the trend is statistically significant. The pattern is not so
clear among women; however the relative risks increase
over the years, but the trend is not statistically significant.
Discussion
There is still a rising incidence of malignant mesothelioma
in Iceland, particularly among men. The increase may be
real; however, it may also be partly a reflection of improve-
ment in the diagnoses, and greater watchfulness for the
cancer. The ban on asbestos use in 1983 may not have
been as influential in Iceland as in neighbouring countries
[39]. No case of malignant mesothelioma has ever been
reported as an occupational disease in Iceland, so such
registration of cases is even less effective than in the other
Scandinavian countries [30–33]. The observed incidence
of malignant mesothelioma in the last ten-year period is
high and consistent with the high incidence rate reported
by countries in the global overview. Only Australia, Great
Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands had higher rates
[12]. This is noteworthy, as there are no asbestos mines
and there never has been any asbestos production in-
dustry in Iceland. However, the import figures are as-
tonishingly high in relation to the population. In a report
on disease burden due to asbestos in European countries,
the age-adjusted mortality rate of malignant mesothelioma
was highest in Iceland, 25 per million people [40]. That
figure is not much higher than the rate 22.2 found in the
present study, in spite of some differences in methodolo-
gies used to calculate the rates.
In the past the volume of the asbestos import was
among the highest per capita in a European study [40],
and this was confirmed in the present study. The de-
scription of the import of asbestos in the present study
shows the same pattern as has been observed in previous
studies on asbestos use, where a ban has been established;
the national consumption of asbestos has diminished
from high per capita use to an almost immeasurably
small amount in the past few years [39, 40]. In these re-
cent years, it is the friction material in brake linings
and clutches that is still important [41]. However, other
sources of asbestos exposure are related to home main-
tenance and renovation [42], and the maintenance of the
asbestos-containing structure of the extensive hot water
supply systems in Iceland. During the last 20 years, labour
inspection, the Administration for Occupational Safety
and Health [43], has been enforcing safe handling of
asbestos in maintenance work. According to information
from the cancer registry, no cluster of malignant meso-
thelioma has been identified at time of diagnosis in the
areas with known erionite occurrence in the country.
Malignant mesothelioma is not the only cancer attributed
to asbestos exposure. There is sufficient evidence that as-
bestos exposure causes lung, larynx and ovarian cancer, and
limited evidence that it causes colorectal, pharynx and
stomach cancers [6]. Lung cancer is the most important
and is generally more frequent than malignant meso-
thelioma in asbestos-exposed cohort studies. However,
lung cancer caused by asbestos is under-recognized and

 often confounded by cigarette smoking [44]. Because of
the firm association between asbestos exposure and
malignant mesothelioma, its incidence or mortality has
been taken as an indicator of asbestos exposure in the
population. In a recent study of McCormack and co-
workers, malignant mesothelioma mortality was used
to estimate asbestos-related lung cancer in different
populations [45], and smoking habits were taken into
account. In the two models used in that study to estimate
asbestos-related lung cancer mortality, the proportion of
lung cancers that are a consequence of asbestos exposure
ranged between 6.6 to 9.3 % in Iceland [45].
The use of the National Register for the source of de-
nominator strengthens the study. Personal identification
numbers, which we had access to in encrypted form,
are used in the comprehensive population registers in
Iceland, and they ensure that we did not double count
cases or dead persons. The National Cause-of-Death
Registry, the source of information of number of deaths
from malignant mesothelioma, has been reported as
good in the global evaluation, and was categorized as
high quality overall and ranked in the same category as
data from 23 developed countries, including the US
and the UK [46]. The autopsy rate is about 14 % of all
deaths during the study period [36].
The figures from the two sources of information con-
cerning number of incident cases, and number of deaths
due to malignant mesothelioma per calendar year or age
categories are not in agreement in the present study.
This is partly because there is a natural lag between the
diagnosis and the death, further more an autopsy study
has revealed that about 45 % of male cases of mesotheli-
oma may remain undiagnosed [47], while still another
Italian study has shown that the overall concordance
between histo-pathological diagnosis and death certifi-
cation was about 75 % [48].
To the strength of the study we count the use of the
Icelandic Cancer Registry for the source of malignant
mesothelioma incidence, in which more than 95 % of
the diagnoses in the registry are histologically verified
[34, 35], and in the present study all cases were with
morphological diagnosis.
The relatively high proportion of peritoneal mesotheli-
omas among females may raise concern of diagnostic
error, and as the cases were not histologically reviewed
by an expert pathologist for the purpose of this study,
we count this as a limitation of the study.
The study material originates from the comprehensive
population registries in Iceland, which are considered to

 be of high quality; however these are from one country
only, which may limit the generalizability of the results.
The characteristics of the background population are
known and the population is homogenous, being 99 %
white Caucasian, with uniform financing of the health
care system, also of high quality. The country belongs to
the developed countries [45]; however, it differs from
other European countries in that heavy industry has ex-
panded during the study period, with aluminium and
ferrosilicon plants having been set up to harvest abun-
dant electric power resources.
Conclusion
The incidence rates of malignant mesothelioma seem to
be increasing in Iceland, which indicates that there is no
reduction yet of the influence of previous asbestos ex-
posure on the population, despite the ban, first imple-
mented in 1983, in an attempt to diminish the use of
asbestos. The previous per capita asbestos import rate
was among the highest in Europe. The findings of the
high incidence and mortality of malignant mesothelioma
is in agreement with the long latency for malignant meso-
thelioma. The incidence during the last ten-year period in
the present study is higher than the recently reported inci-
dence in neighbouring Scandinavian countries.
