Background: Type 1 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD). Decreased endothelial 
progenitor cells (EPCs) number plays a pivotal role in reduced endothelial repair and development of CVD. We aimed 
to determine if cardioprotective effect of metformin is mediated by increasing circulating endothelial progenitor 
cells (cEPCs), pro-angiogenic cells (PACs) and decreasing circulating endothelial cells (cECs) count whilst maintaining 
unchanged glycemic control.
Methods: This study was an open label and parallel standard treatment study. Twenty-three type 1 diabetes patients 
without overt CVD were treated with metformin for 8 weeks (treatment group-TG). They were matched with nine type 
1 diabetes patients on standard treatment (SG) and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HC). Insulin dose 
was adjusted to keep unchanged glycaemic control. cEPCs and cECs counts were determined by flow cytometry 
using surface markers CD45dimCD34+VEGFR-2+ and CD45dimCD133−CD34+CD144+ respectively. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells were cultured to assess changes in PACs number, function and colony forming units (CFU-Hill’s 
colonies).
Results: At baseline TG had lower cEPCs, PACs, CFU-Hills’ colonies and PACs adhesion versus HC (p < 0.001-all vari-
ables) and higher cECs versus HC (p = 0.03). Metformin improved cEPCs, PACs, CFU-Hill’s colonies number, cECs and 
PACs adhesion (p < 0.05-all variables) to levels seen in HC whilst HbA1c (one-way ANOVA p = 0.78) and glucose 
variability (average glucose, blood glucose standard deviation, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion, continuous 
overall net glycaemic action and area under curve) remained unchanged. No changes were seen in any variables in 
SG. There was an inverse correlation between CFU-Hill’s colonies with cECs.
Conclusions: Metformin has potential cardio-protective effect through improving cEPCs, CFU-Hill’s colonies, cECs, 
PACs count and function independently of hypoglycaemic effect. This finding needs to be confirmed by long term 
cardiovascular outcome studies in type 1 diabetes.

Background
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterised by an increased 
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with 
the non-diabetic population [1, 2]. The life expectancy 
of adults at age of 20 with type 1 diabetes is reduced 
by up to 13 years with CVD being the leading cause of 
premature death [3]. Even with good glycaemic con-
trol the CVD risk remains more than twice that of non-
diabetic individuals [4, 5]. Despite current use of statins 
and ACE-inhibitors, CVD risk in type 1 diabetes remains 
higher than non-diabetic population. Patients with type 
1 diabetes mellitus without overt CVD or diabetes-
related complications have been shown to have features 
of endothelial dysfunction [6]. There is a need to explore 
newer treatment options to improve endothelial dysfunc-
tion and reduce CVD risk. Endothelial dysfunction itself

results from imbalance between vascular damage and 
vascular repair.
Vascular damage results in the release of circulating 
endothelial cells (cECs) from the vascular intima. cECs 
are mature endothelial cells characterised by presence of 
endothelial cell surface markers like CD144 and absence 
of heamatopoetic (e.g. CD45) and progenitor cell mark-
ers (e.g. CD133). CD144 is important for maintaining 
endothelium integrity through cell to cell adhesion [7].
cECs are formed through detachment from vascular 
intima due to irreversible loss of integrity as a response 
to endothelial activation by mechanical stress, inflamma-
tory cytokines, growth factors, infectious agents, lipopro-
tein, and oxidative stress [7, 8]. Furthermore, cECs are 
elevated in type 1 and type 2 diabetes [9, 10], and are a 
predictor of CVD events in similar high risk populations 
[11]. cECs count (a marker of vascular damage) is directly 
related to HbA1c in type 1 diabetes [9].
In response to vascular damage, vascular repair is 
promoted by local endothelial cells and bone-marrow 
derived cells, called endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). 
EPCs were first described in 1997 [12]. These cells have 
the ability to home to the site of vascular injury, prolif-
erate and contribute to endothelial repair [13], thereby 
maintaining endothelial health.
Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) are 
a heterogenous population of cells characterised by the 
expression of surface antigen CD34+, VEGFR-2+ and/
or CD133+ identified by flow cytometry. CD34+ and 
CD133+ are hematopoietic stem cell markers [14, 15]. 
VEGFR-2 is a surface marker of endothelial lineage. 
Progenitor cells undergo various stages of maturation. 
CD133 marker is lost as cEPCs mature. Thus, more 
mature cEPCs are positive for CD34 and VEGFR-2 [16]. 
VEGFR-2 plays an important role in angiogenesis by 
promoting endothelial cell growth and cell permeability 
[17]. cEPCs predict microvascular complication in type 
2 diabetes [18] and future CVD events in patients with 
CVD [19]. In addition cEPCs count is inversely related to 
HbA1c [20].
Proangiogenic cells (PACs), previously known as early 
EPCs are the cultured peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMNC) whereas colonies derived from replated 
PBMNC are known as colony forming units (CFU-Hill’s 
colonies) [21]. PACs and CFU-Hill’s colonies are reduced 
in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and CFU-Hill’s colo-
nies have been shown to predict CVD events [20–24]. 
PAC count is inversely related to HbA1c and much more 
suppressed in the presence of diabetes-related complica-
tions [23–25]. In addition, the functional capacity of cul-
tured PACs is impaired in patients with diabetes [23].
As the outcome of CVD management using the same 
therapies is worse in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients 
[26], there is a need to identify additional treatment 
options and study the mechanism of action behind the 
cardio-protective properties. Metformin has been shown 
to have cardio-protective properties in type 2 diabetes, 
[27, 28]. In the UKPD trial [27] the incidence of myocar-
dial infarction was reduced after a median follow-up of 
10 years. Furthermore, metformin also reduced cardiac 
infarct size and improved endothelial function in dia-
betes [29, 30]. It has been shown that metformin under 
diabetic environment protects ECs regardless of its gly-
caemic effects [31]. In nondiabetic patients however, 
there were mixed findings regarding metformin’s cardio-
protective effect. Metformin had no effect on reducing 
left ventricular dysfunction and re-perfusion cardiac 
injury in non-diabetic patients following an acute myo-
cardial infarction and coronary arterial bypass graft [32, 
33].
Thus, the data are in keeping with a cardio-protective 
effect of metformin in diabetes, although the underly-
ing mechanism is unclear. Since metformin has been 
shown to improve endothelial function in type 1 diabetes, 
we hypothesised that metformin modulates cEPCs and 
cECs count and this cardio-protective effect is mediated 
beyond improving glycaemic control.
Thus the primary aim of our trial was to study if met-
formin improved cEPCs number in type 1 diabetes 
whilst, maintaining unchanged diabetic control. Second-
ary aims were to determine if metformin also improved 
cECs number, PACs number and function and CFU-Hill’s 
colonies.
Methods
We recruited 23 patients with type 1 diabetes with inclu-
sion criteria of HbA1c <8.5 % (69 mmol/mmol), absence 
of macrovascular disease or stage 3b renal impairment 
(eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2) or active proliferative retin-
opathy, as the ‘treatment group’ (TG). Nine matched 
type 1 diabetes patients were recruited as a standard 
group (SG). Both, TG and SG did not have any new inter-
vention during the trial except for metformin in TG. 
Patients with suspected hypoglycemia unawareness were 
excluded. The study protocol (Fig. 1) included a run-in 
phase of 6 weeks to ensure stable glucose control. Fol-
lowing this period metformin was given for 8 weeks to 
TG with a dose titrated up to a maximum of 1 g twice 
a day over 2–3 weeks or to highest tolerated dose. The 
SG underwent similar follow-up except for metformin 
treatment. Furthermore, the TG was compared with 
23 age- and gender-matched non-diabetic healthy con-
trols (HC). All subjects gave their written informed 
consent and the Local Ethics Committee approved the 
study. Patients with type 1 diabetes were recruited either 
from, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead or Royal

Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, UK. Healthy controls were 
recruited from the staff from the above or students from 
Newcastle University, UK.
Routine laboratory investigations (full blood count, 
U&Es, liver function test, thyroid function test, and 
HbA1c), 12-lead ECG, blood pressure, weight, height and 
BMI were performed at baseline and at the end of the study.
We aimed for unchanged glycaemic control during 
the study, which was assessed by HbA1c (four times 
points over 14 weeks) and continuous glucose moni-
toring (CGM) (Ipro2- Medtronic) (minimum of 48 h) 
was performed in those receiving metformin to ensure 
unchanged glycemic control. EasyGV Version 8.8.2. R2 
was used to calculate glucose variability index [34].
Peripheral EDTA blood samples were collected before 
and after the study from TG and SG and at baseline from 
HC.
Endothelial progenitor cells
Flow cytometric evaluation of circulating endothelial 
progenitor cells (cEPCs) and circulating endothelial cells 
(cECs)
100 µl of whole blood [6] was incubated with 5 µl of 
V500 CD45 (B.D Bioscience), 20 µl of PerCP-Cy5.5 CD34 
(BD Bioscience), 5 µl of PE VEGFR-2+ (R&D), 5 µl APC 
CD133 (Miltenyi Biotec USA), 10 µl of FITC CD144 
for 30 min. Subsequently, 2 mls of pharmlyse (BD Bio-
science) was used to lyse the red cells. The sample was 
then analysed by flow cytometry on BD FACS Canto™ 
II system and results by using BD FACSDiva™ software. 
On average 450,000 events were counted. cEPCs were 
defined as CD45dimCD34+VEGFR-2+ cells and cECs as 
CD45dim, CD133−, CD34+, and CD144+ events. cEPC 
count was expressed as % leukocytes (Intra-assay varia-
tion <8 %) and cECs as per ml of blood.

Between-groups, comparison was by unpaired Student t 
test or the Mann–Whitney test. Correlation between dif-
ferent parameters were calculated by Pearson correlation 
or Spearman’s rho analysis. Multivariate regression anal-
ysis of delta changes in parameters were used to deter-
mine if independent metabolic variables predicted an 
improvement in cEPCs, PACs, CFU-Hill’s colonies, cECs 
and PACs function. One-way ANOVA was used to ana-
lyse the difference between HbA1c values. Adjustment 
for multiple comparisons was made by using the Bonfer-
roni correction. Statistical significance was accepted at 
p < 0.05 (two-tailed significance).
As the aim of the study was to assess the effect of met-
formin on cEPCs in type 1 diabetes, therefore, statistical 
power calculation was undertaken only for the TG. Based 
on our pilot work and in order to reduce CVD risk in 
patients with type 1 diabetes, we aimed to detect a dif-
ference of 0.0021 in cEPCs (% leukocytes) in the treat-
ment group (before and after metformin treatment), with 
α = 0.05 and a power of 90 %, a minimum of 20 patients 
were required. SPSS v21.0 (SPSS Inc, Ill) was used to per-
form statistical analysis.
Results
Clinical characteristics
Baseline characteristics of three groups are shown in 
Table 1. All groups were well matched for age, gender and 
blood pressure. TG and SG had a similar duration of dia-
betes (DOD), HbA1c, baseline insulin dose, lipid profile 
and creatinine. BMI was lower in SG in comparison to 
TG.
In TG, at recruitment twelve patients took aspirin and/
or ACE inhibitor and/or statins in addition to insulin. No 
new medication other than metformin was started dur-
ing the trial (except for metformin in the TG). No medi-
cation dosage was changed other than the dose of insulin 
and metformin. HC took no aspirin, ACE inhibitors and/
or statins. Five patients in the SG took aspirin or/and 
ACE inhibitor and/or statins in addition to insulin. There 
was no difference in medication between TG and SG.
After treatment with metformin, BMI, total choles-
terol, triglyceride, blood pressure and HbA1c remained 
unchanged. Over 14 weeks HbA1c values were as fol-
lows −6 week (56.4 ± 8.3 mmol/mol, 7.3 ± 3 %), 
0 week (56.85 ± 10.5 mmol/mol, 7.3 ± 0.9 %), +6 week

(56 ± 0.8 mmol/mol, 7.3 ± 0.8 %); one-way ANOVA, 
p = 0.78). The coefficient of variation of HbA1c over 
14 weeks was 4.8 %. Furthermore, continuous glu-
cose monitoring confirmed unchanged glucose control 
and variability (Average glucose CGM mmol/l: 9 ± 3 
vs 8 ± 2.3, p = 0.17; blood glucose standard deviation: 
3.3 ± 1.1 vs 3 ± 1.2, p = 0.3; mean amplitude of gly-
caemic excursion; 7 ± 2.7 vs 6 ± 3, p = 0.3; continuous 
overall net glycaemic action: 7.7 ± 2 vs 7.3 ± 2.2, p = 0.4; 
Total area under curve (AUC) (calculated): 12341 ± 2900 
vs 11500 ± 3182, p = 0.3; AUC above limit-7.8 (CGM): 
1.86 vs 1.97, p = 0.7. Insulin dose, HDL cholesterol and 
creatinine were significantly reduced in the TG treatment 
group after metformin treatment. There were no changes 
in any variables in SG.
Side effects
None of the volunteers in the study suffered any side 
effects requiring discontinuation of metformin. Fifteen 
patients took the full recommended dose of metformin 
(1000 mg BD). One patient took 500 mg BD due to low 
low eGFR (46 ml/min/1.73 m2). Five patients had gastro-
intestinal side effects that required dose reduction (two 
patients took 500 mg TDS; two took 500 mg BD, and 
one took 500 mg OD). No patient suffered any major 
or severe episode of hypoglycaemia. Major episode of 
hypoglycaemia was defined as any episode of low blood 
sugar requiring intervention of another person to resolve 
the event. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as any epi-
sode of hypoglycaemia resulting in loss of consciousness. 
There was no significant effect of metformin on minor 
hypoglycaemic events (% ≤3.9 mmol/l and area under 
curve 3.9 mmol/l on CGMS: 8.6 % vs 13.3 %; p = 0.2 and 
0.08 vs 0.1; p = 0.5 respectively).
Study biomarkers
Figure 2 provides a comparison of cEPCs while Table 2 
provides a comparison of cECs, PACs, CFU-Hill’s colonies 
and PACs adhesion function between the TG, SG and HC. 
Circulating endothelial progenitor cells
cEPCs count was similar in TG and the SG at baseline 
(p = 0.4). cEPCs (CD45dimCD34+VEGFR-2+) were sig-
nificantly lower (60 %) in TG versus HC [Treatment 
group pre-metformin (TG V1 vs HC); median intraquar-
tile range (IQ): 0.0028 (0.0016–0.006) vs 0.0068 (0.006–
0.009)  % leukocytes; p < 0.0005)]. Eight weeks metformin 
treatment significantly increased cEPCs in TG by more 
than 75 % and normalised the levels of cEPCs count when 
compared to HC [TG V1 vs TG V2 (Treatment group 
post metformin); median (IQ): 0.0028 (0.0016–0.006) 
vs 0.005 (0.0035–0.0085) % leukocytes; p = 0.002]. In 
SG 8 weeks of standard follow-up did not result in any 
change in cEPCs count [SG V1 vs SG V2: median (IQ): 
0.0032 (0.002–0.004) vs 0.0035 (0.003–0.005)  % leuko-
cytes; p = 0.6]. Figure 3 provides before and after treat-
ment plots for cEPC in TG.
Circulating endothelial cells
cECs number was similar in TG and SG at baseline. How-
ever, cECs were significantly higher (74 %) in TG versus 
HC. Metformin treatment led to a significantly reduction 
of cECs (36 %) in TG. Furthermore, metformin treatment 
normalised cECs numbers versus HC. cECs numbers did 
not change after eight-week follow-up in the SG.
Culture Assay for PACs and CFU‑Hill’s colonies
PACs and CFU-Hill’s colonies numbers were simi-
lar in TG and the SG at baseline. PACs and CFU-Hill’s 
colonies counts were significantly lower (59 and 60 % 
respectively) in TG compared with HC. Eight weeks 
metformin treatment significantly increased PACs and 
CFU-Hill’s colonies in TG by 71 and 66 % respectively. 
Metformin treatment seemed to bring PACs and CFU-
Hill’s colonies count closer to HC levels. After 8 weeks 
of follow-up in SG, the PACs and CFU-Hill’s colonies 
numbers remained unchanged.
PACs adhesion to fibronectin
The adhesion of PACs was similar in TG and SG at base-
line. The adhesion of PACs in TG was 60 % lower when 
compared to HC. Metformin led to a significant increase 
(127 %), in PACs adhesion in TG and to the level seen in 
HC.
The PACs number remained unchanged after eight 
weeks of follow-up in SG.

Correlation
Univariate analysis in TG
In univariate analysis in TG, there was no correla-
tion between changes in HbA1c, BMI, insulin dosage, 
total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
cEPCs, PACs, CFU-Hill’s colonies levels and PACs adhe-
sion. There was an inverse correlation between changes 
in CFU-Hill’s colonies and cECs number (r = −0.6; 
p = 0.003) in TG. There was an inverse correlation 
between changes in PACs number and triglycerides 
(r = −0.6; p = 0.001) in TG.
Multivariate regression in TG
In multivariate regression analysis none of independent 
variables (changes in HbA1c, BMI, insulin dosage, LDL 
cholesterol) predicted changes in cEPCs, PACs number 
and function, CFU-Hill’s colonies and cECs.
Univariate and multivariate regression analysis are 
given in Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2 respectively.
Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that 
in patients with relatively well controlled type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (mean HbA1c 7.3 or 56.4 mmol/mol), metformin 
therapy improved markers of vascular damage (cECs) and 
repair (cEPCs). We believe that this study may have posi-
tive clinical implication for patients with increased CVD 
risk by rebalancing the emphasis in their management 
from limiting damage alone to also improving vascular 
repair. Further evidence that our patients might benefit 
from metformin comes from the fact that CFU-Hill’s col-
onies, PACs number and adhesion properties improved 
significantly. It is well established that CFU-Hill’s colo-
nies number are inversely related to Framingham risk 
score. Therefore, CFU-Hill’s colonies are yet another pre-
dictor of CVD [21]. In addition, PACs adhesion function 
is an important factor in cEPCs homing, cell-cell contact 
and transmigration events for neovascularisation and 
vascular repair [35]. Metformin not only improved the 
level of cEPCs but also brought PACs number/adhesion 
and CFU-Hill’s colonies closer to the HC levels.
In addition, for the first time we have shown that in 
TG there was an inverse correlation between changes in 
cECs and CFU-Hills’ colonies. This shows that changes 
in markers of vascular/endothelial damage are linked 
inversely with a marker of CVD risk (CFU-Hill’s colonies).
The additional benefit suggested by our study for 
patients with type 1 diabetes is that the vascular health/
repair may be improved in already well-controlled 
patients and without a need for further improvement in 
glycaemic control. Patients with type 1 diabetes are cur-
rently advised to achieve HbA1c <7 % or <54 mmol/mol 
in order to reduce CVD events. However, this is associ-
ated with inherent risk of experiencing hypoglycaemia.

cations Study has demonstrated a U shaped association

between all-cause mortality and HbA1c. That is, all-cause 
mortality is highest at low (5.6 %; 37.7 mmol/l) and high 
(11.8 %; 105.5 mmol/mol) HbA1c [36]. Thus, an addi-
tional advantage of using metformin in type 1 diabetes 
suggested by our study is that markers of vascular health 
and repair may be improved without lowering blood glu-
cose concentrations to a tightly control HbA1c level.
Metformin has been shown to improve cEPCs in type 2 
diabetes [37]. However, there was a significant improve-
ment in HbA1c. Thus, the change in cEPCs number 
could have been attributed to improved diabetic con-
trol. We have shown that the effect of metformin on all 
vascular biomarkers studied was beyond improving dia-
betic control. Indeed, HbA1c and glycaemic variability 
remained unchanged after 8 weeks of therapy. The glu-
cose independent mechanism behind the metformin 
cardio-protective effect is of particular interest as this 
drug has some beneficial cardiac properties in non-dia-
betic animals [38]. When used in non-diabetic animals, 
metformin improved the outcome and revascularization 
following surgically induced myocardial infarction and 
hindlimb ischemia [38, 39]. Insulin dosage was reduced 
significantly, but it was not correlated with changes in 
cEPCs number or PACs adhesion. This is interesting, as 
insulin has been shown to improve cEPCs number [40, 
41] and function in type 2 diabetes [42, 43]. However, the 
improvement in cEPCs number in Fadini et al. [41] could 
be attributed to improvement in HbA1c. This is in con-
trast with Humpert et al. [40], who showed that effect of 
insulin on the cEPCs number is independent of HbA1c. 
If the former was likely, given the reduction in insulin 
dosage in our study, cEPCs, PACs and CFU-Hill’s colo-
nies number and PACs adhesion should have decreased, 
but this is not the case. This suggests that the insulin dose 
reduction did not have any effect on improving cEPCs or 
PACs function. Reduction in insulin dose had no effect 
on any variable including cEPCs in univariate or multi-
variate analysis.
cECs are recognised markers of vascular damage. Our 
study showed that metformin therapy improved the 
cECs count in type 1 diabetes and brought it closer to the 
matched HC. Even though cECs improved significantly, 
we believe that our study did not show the full effect of 
metformin on cECs, as some of our patients were using 
cardio-protective drugs already: statins and ACE inhibi-
tors. Indeed, in TG subjects on ACE inhibitors and or 
statins less reduction of cECs was observed.
Eight weeks of metformin treatment did not result in 
any significant change or BMI. This is in contrast with 
a recent study which showed that 6 months of met-
formin in people with type 1 diabetes resulted in the 
loss of nearly 2.5 kg weight when compared to placebo 
[30]. However, we requested that patient would not aim 
to improve their diabetic control whilst in the study, so 
it is possible explanation for the lack of weight loss. Sur-
prisingly, HDL cholesterol levels were reduced after met-
formin therapy, though, were similar to the control group 
and remained well within the normal range. However, 
there was no correlation between changes in cEPCs with 
BMI nor HDL cholesterol in univariate analysis. Thus, in 
our study it seems that BMI and HDL cholesterol are not 
responsible for metformin’s effect on the cEPCs number. 
This is in contrast with available evidence where HDL 
cholesterol has been shown to play a role in number 
EPCs and ischemia induced endothelial repair [44–46]. 
Furthermore, the multivariate analysis also showed that 
change in BMI was not a predictor of cEPCs either.
Our work can be supplemented further by understand-
ing the mechanism through which metformin improves 
cEPC and cECs numbers. It is established that EPC dif-
ferentiation and mobilization is impaired in diabetes mel-
litus patients [47]. Hyperglycaemia induces endothelial 
cell death via suppression of SIRT1. In-vitro work has 
shown metformin’s effect on improved cell survival (at 
physiological levels) although in mouse cells in high glu-
cose levels (40 mM) by reducing premature senescence 
and apoptosis via increased SIRT expression/activity [48]. 
Metformin has been shown to promote SIRT 1 activ-
ity via AMPK pathway. This reduced the oxidative stress 
caused by hyperglycaemia in a dose-dependent manner 
[49]. Thus, we speculate that observed effect of met-
formin on cEPCs in our study may be due to improved 
cell survival, decreased senescence and/or increased 
recruitment from the bone marrow. Other beneficial 
effects of metformin have been achieved, although at 
very high unphysiological metformin levels only, such as 
activation of AMPK-mTOR and AMPK-eNOS-NO path-
way [50].
EPC mobilisation can be increased via activation of 
eNOS pathway in diabetes mellitus [51]. Thereby, we can 
infer that activation of eNOS pathway can increase EPC 
mobilisation. However, this speculative and needs confir-
mation using metformin at physiological concentration. 
For that purpose, we have constructed an angiogenic 
model to study the mechanism of metformin at physi-
ological concentration. In this experiment, metformin 
improved angiogenesis through increased angiogenic sig-
nal. It not only increased VEGF-A levels but also down-
regulated angiogenic inhibitors; CXCL-10 and TIMP-1 
[52].
Our work can be meaningfully extended by addressing 
the limitations of our study. Although, there was a small 
number of patients in this study it was adequately pow-
ered. Our type 1 diabetes cohort was heterogeneous with 
a wide range of diabetes duration and age. This may seem 
to be a limitation but can also be seen as an advantage to 
 Page 8 of 10
Ahmed et al. Cardiovasc Diabetol  (2016) 15:116 
improve generalisability of the results of our study. CGMS 
was done at the beginning and middle of the study and 
not at the end of the study. However, CGMS in the mid-
dle of the treatment phase was done at the maximum dose 
of tolerated metformin. Therefore, it is representative of 
metformin effect on blood glucose levels. We did not use 
randomised design nor long intervention (8 weeks only). 
As this research was designed as a proof of concept study 
exploring the effect of metformin on cEPCs and cECs, 
data generated from our work can be used to design ran-
domised trials of longer duration in order to repurpose 
this widely used type 2 diabetes drug, for patients with 
type 1 diabetes [53]. Our work can be supplemented by 
exploring the effect of metformin treatment on endothe-
lial function, inflammatory and adhesion markers.
Conclusions
In summary, our study has shown for the first time that 
metformin treatment may result in cardiovascular ben-
efit by increasing markers of vascular repair or health 
(cEPCs, CFU-Hill’s colonies, and PACs) and reducing 
markers of vascular damage (cECs). In a pivotal study by 
Werner et al. [19], higher levels of cEPCs lead to reduced 
CVD events. It appears that a 75 % rise in cEPCs num-
ber in type 1 diabetes patients as seen in our study might 
equate to the reclassification of our patients into a lower 
CVD risk group with approximate Hazard Ratio for CVD 
death of 0.77 thus 23 % reduction [19]. However, this 
needs to be confirmed by large randomised controlled 
trial examining cardiovascular events.
