AIMS
Salbutamol is used in the management of obstructive bronchospasm, including that of some elite athletes. It is claimed that high
salbutamol (oral) doses may also have an anabolic effect. Therefore, inhalation of salbutamol is restricted by the World
Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to a maximal daily dose. Urine is tested for violations, but recent cases have resulted in a debate
regarding the validity of this approach. It was our aim to determine whether current approaches are sufficiently able to
differentiate approved usage from violations.
METHODS
We extracted pharmacokinetic parameters from literature for salbutamol and its sulphated metabolite. From these parameters, a
semi-physiological pharmacokinetic model of inhaled and orally administered salbutamol was synthesized, validated against
literature data, and used to perform clinical trial simulations (n = 1000) of possible urine concentrations over time resulting from
WADA-allowed and oral unacceptable dosages.
RESULTS
The synthesized model was able to predict the literature data well. Simulations showed a very large range of salbutamol
concentrations, with a significant portion of virtual subjects (15.4%) exceeding the WADA threshold limit of 1000 ng ml�1 at 1 h
post-dose.
CONCLUSIONS
The observed large variability in urine concentrations indicates that determining the administered dose from a single untimed
urine sample is not feasible. The current threshold inadvertently leads to incorrect assumptions of violation, whereas many
violations will go unnoticed, especially when samples are taken long after drug administration. These issues, combined with the
dubious assertion of its anabolic effect, leads us to conclude that the large effort involved in testing should be reconsidered.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Inhaled salbutamol is accepted according to WADA guidelines within restricted doses. Urine is tested for violations of
these restrictions, possibly resulting in punitive action.
• Inhaled and oral salbutamol administration follows complex pharmacokinetic profiles, including multiple ADME
processes contributing to large variability in urine concentrations.
• This variability makes it doubtful that one can determine dose from a (single) urine concentration. WADA’s assumptions
of its appropriateness are insufficiently supported by the literature and general theory of drug disposition.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• Simulations of salbutamol urine concentrations resulting from acceptable salbutamol usage (after inhaled therapeutic
doses) in 1000 virtual subjects show that 1 h post-dose, concentrations surpass the threshold of 1000 ng ml�1 in 15.4% of
subjects. Conversely, unacceptable oral doses fall below the threshold within 48 h after the last dose.
• Our results show that single urine measurements do not allow estimation of the applied dose. The applied cutoff value of
1000 ng ml�1 is insufficient to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable salbutamol use. Moreover, it is impos-
sible to determine a cutoff value for this purpose with the current procedures.
• A semi-physiological pharmacokinetic model was built using literature data. The possibility of the model to reasonably
predict for several scenarios shows the power of model synthesis using prior literature data, allowing the evaluation of
virtual scenarios using readily existing data.
Introduction
Recently one of the most successful male cyclists of the last
decade, Chris Froome, came into disrepute due to news of a
potential
doping
violation.
Doping
control
revealed
a
salbutamol (albuterol in the United States) concentration ex-
ceeding the allowed limit of 1000 ng ml�1 in a urine sample
provided by the British rider during the Vuelta a España of
2017 [1]. The WADA prohibited list indicates that salbutamol
use is allowed in inhaled dosages up to “1600 micrograms
over 24 hours in divided doses not to exceed 800 micrograms
over 12 hours starting from any dose”, which is considered
the maximum therapeutic dose for athletes with a so-called
Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). Froome was in possession
of such a TUE, but “the presence in urine of salbutamol in ex-
cess of 1000 ng ml�1 […] is presumed not to be an intended
therapeutic use of the substance and will be considered as
an Adverse Analytical Finding unless the athlete proves,
through a controlled pharmacokinetic study, that the abnor-
mal result was the consequence of the use of the therapeutic
dose (by inhalation) up to the maximum dose indicated
above.” Currently, over six months since the urine sample
concerned, there is still no news of such a controlled study,
which is perhaps not surprising: the burden is with the
accused and setting up a robust study requires expertise.
Additionally, inter-occasion variability will influence the
results of each attempt.
Salbutamol acts on the beta-2-adrenoceptor as a
sympathomimetic,
commonly
prescribed
to
counteract
bronchoconstriction due to allergic and exercise-induced
asthma, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) [2]. This mechanism of action has led athletes to
believe that there might be a performance-enhancing effect
of beta-2 agonists both through relaxing smooth muscle cell
in the lung, and anabolic effects on skeletal muscles. Two
reviews extensively investigated the evidence for these effects
and concluded that inhaled beta-2 agonists have no positive
effects on muscle strength, sprint or endurance performance,
and that only high, systemic dosages can improve muscle
strength and sprint performance, but not endurance perfor-
mance [3, 4]. In summary, beta-2 agonists might give an ad-
vantage in sports, but only at very high concentrations and
for very short (power) disciplines. It is therefore doubtful that
multi-stage (endurance) cyclists like Chris Froome would
benefit even from high doses of beta-2 agonists apart from
when treating asthmatic symptoms. Nevertheless, WADA is
currently of the opinion that all beta-2 agonists are banned
substances, necessitating doping control measures. For this
purpose, urine analysis is performed, which leads to a
problem for the substances that are allowed with a TUE up
to a maximum dose: salbutamol, formoterol and salmeterol.
For
these
substances,
urine
concentration
is
used
to
determine whether the maximum dose was exceeded. It is,
however, impossible to determine dose from a single urine
concentration due to several pharmacological factors that
are at play. Salbutamol plasma pharmacokinetics, in particu-
lar, are highly variable, mainly due to variability in lung and
gut
absorption,
volume(s)
of
distribution,
metabolism
(including
first-pass
effect)
and
renal
clearance
[5–7].
Subsequently, urine pharmacokinetics are even more variable
due to the additional factor of urine concentrating abilities
of
the
kidney
(urine
osmolality
between
50
and
1200 mOsm kg�1) [8], volumetric production of urine [9]
and micturition. On top of all this, the time since last dose
in a doping control setting is unknown. Despite these facts,
the WADA rules seem to assume that a urine concentration
above the set threshold indicates a high chance of having
detected use of more than the allowed dose. This chance is
apparently considered sufficiently high to warrant sanction-
ing the athlete, but supporting evidence in literature is
lacking. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the
current WADA approach to this problem and determine
whether this approach is able to differentiate approved use
from violations. As a part of that aim, we evaluate whether
WADA-approved doses of salbutamol may lead to unaccept-
able urine concentrations, considering the multiple sources
of variability, using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic
(PBPK) approach.

 Methods
Several literature data sources were used to synthesize a
semi-physiological pharmacokinetic model of plasma and
urine salbutamol concentrations [5–7]. In short, a PK model
of salbutamol in dogs was used as the basis and extrapolated
to humans using allometric scaling [7]. Literature data on
clearance of salbutamol and its main metabolite, sulphated
salbutamol, was added to the base model [5]. A separate
compartment was constructed to take into account the
production of urine based on factors such as cardiac output
and concentrating efforts of the kidneys [9, 10]. Further
adjustment of parameters was performed to align a visual
predictive
check
against
literature
data
of
salbutamol
plasma and urine concentration from Haase et al. [6]. All
modelling was performed in an environment consisting of
Piraña v2.8.1 [11], PsN v4.2.0 [12] and NONMEM v7.3
[13]. The statistical software R® v3.3.0 [14] was used for
pre and post-processing of data, and statistical and graphical
analysis.
Literature model synthesis
Several pharmacokinetic models exist for salbutamol in the
literature; however, none of these include the urinary phar-
macokinetics of salbutamol. A number of articles describe
the concentrations of salbutamol in both plasma and urine
without describing the parameters involved in the transfer
of salbutamol between the two fluids. The only available
model that approximates the absorption of salbutamol
through both lungs and gut was built on data from dogs [7].
The model was implemented in NONMEM and the parameter
values extrapolated to humans using allometric theory [15].
Variability on the fraction of inhalation absorbed through
the gut and through the lungs was incorporated to account
for inter-patient variability in inhalation efficiency, and
differences in inhaler types and formulations.
The
allometrically
extrapolated
model
was
further
expanded by introducing a first-pass effect of gut absorbed
salbutamol to its main metabolite, sulphated salbutamol
(S-SAL). Furthermore, the renal clearances of salbutamol and
S-SAL were incorporated from pharmacokinetic parameters
reported by Morgan et al. [5]. Additional compartments for
both salbutamol and S-SAL in urine were constructed,
assuming that when the compounds are eliminated from
plasma at the clearance rates provided by Morgan et al. [5],
they are directly introduced to urine without delay.
A separate compartment was built to describe urine vol-
ume production, to allow voiding this compartment, similar
to micturition, thereby better approximating physiology
and allowing for the investigation of several micturition
scenarios. Urine formation was assumed to occur at a
constant rate, calculated using several physiological parame-
ters, such as cardiac output (CO) scaled allometrically to
weight (CO = 0.166·weight0.79) [10]. The CO for a typical
person of 70 kg then is 4.76 l, with a coefficient of variance
(CV) of 20%. Of this CO, 21% flows through the kidneys.
Typical haematocrit is 0.409 (CV: 7%) in trained cyclists
[16], thus 59.1% of blood is plasma, with 19% of plasma
entering the renal capsule. Of the resulting glomerular
filtrate, 99.2% is reabsorbed, leaving 0.8% to leave the
kidneys as urine. Combining these numbers, we calculate
the urine production in litres per hour for a typical adult
weighing 70 kg as follows [9]:
4:76 L min�1 �60 min�21%�59:1%�19%�0:8% ¼ 0:054 L h�1
(1)
This amounts to 1.2 litres of urine per day, with a 95%
prediction interval (PI) of 0.66–1.92 l day�1, corresponding
well with the typical volumes of 1–2 l day�1. This also
includes variability due to concentrating by the kidney.
Cardiac stroke volume is increased in elite athletes, but due
to reduced heart rate at rest, the cardiac output is not signif-
icantly
different
from
normal
healthy
controls
[17].
Although cardiac output is significantly increased (roughly
threefold) during exercise, renal blood flow is restricted,
leading to only a mild to moderate reduction in the urine
production rate [18, 19].
Model validation and calibration
We extracted data points of plasma and urine salbutamol
concentrations from Haase et al. [6] using ImageJ v1.50 [20]
and the Figure_Calibration plugin [21]. Haase et al. adminis-
tered 13 subjects with a single salbutamol inhalation of
1600 mcg, followed by regular plasma and urine sample col-
lections. Validation of the synthesized literature model was
performed through simulation of salbutamol plasma and
urine concentrations in 1000 subjects (weight mean: 84 kg,
SD: 17 kg), after a single 1600 mcg dose, and bladder voiding
at the indicated time points where a urine sample was col-
lected. The resulting simulated concentrations were com-
pared to the plasma and urine concentrations over time in
exercised, dehydrated subject data extracted from Haase
et al. and graphically presented in a visual predictive check
plot [22]. Calibration of the parameters derived from the
dog model was required, to better correspond to the Haase
et al. data (for further elaboration, see Supporting Informa-
tion Data S1).
Model simulation
Subsequently, we simulated a twice-daily 800 mcg inhaled
salbutamol administration at steady state (maximal allowed
dose) in 1000 virtual subjects and determined the percentage
of subjects attaining urine salbutamol concentrations above
the 1000 ng ml�1 threshold to determine whether approved
doses of salbutamol may lead to unacceptable urine concen-
trations. Finally, we also investigated a two-week regimen of
8 mg oral salbutamol tablets (a dose shown to increase sprint
power in elite athletes [23]) in 1000 simulated subjects, to
determine the length of washout period associated with
non-adverse findings in doping control. Both simulations
(inhaled and oral dosing regimens) were used to evaluate
whether the current WADA approach is able to differentiate
approved use from violations.

Results
Model synthesis
The synthesized model consisted of eight compartments; one
each for absorption through the gut and lung, one central
and one peripheral distribution compartment for parent
salbutamol,
one
central
metabolite
compartment,
one
salbutamol and one metabolite urine compartment, and a
single urine volume compartment (Figure 1). When adminis-
tered through inhalation, 20% of the dose reaches central
circulation through the lung, with 80% of the dose ingested
and absorbed through the gut. Half of the gut-absorbed
amount experiences a first-pass effect and is absorbed as
sulphate metabolite, with the other 50% reaching the circula-
tion as unchanged salbutamol. Total apparent clearance of
salbutamol parent drug is 13.1 l h�1 (of which 18.6%, or
2.4 l h�1 is the rate of conversion to S-SAL), and clearance of
S-SAL is 5.9 l h�1. The higher apparent S-SAL clearance
compared to conversion of salbutamol to metabolite in
circulation explains why S-SAL only accumulates after oral
administration of salbutamol, and not in the case of IV
administration [5].
Model validation
After several adjustments of pharmacokinetic parameters
(Table 1), plasma and urine salbutamol concentrations were
adequately predicted, with only a minor bias, and reasonably
similar variation bandwidth (Figure 2). The dual absorption
peaks,
distribution
and
elimination
phases
were
well
described.
Urine concentrations after appropriate
salbutamol use
Simulations of steady-state urine concentrations over time
resulting from a bi-daily administration of the approved 800
mcg show a large spread, with a significant portion (15.4%)
of the simulated population achieving urine concentrations
above the threshold of 1000 ng ml�1 at the peak concentra-
tion at 1 h post-dose (Figure 3). At 12 h after the dose admin-
istration, or right before the next inhalation, 0.7% of the
population still showed urine concentrations above the
threshold. It should be pointed out that these numbers do
not take into account voiding the bladder before urine test-
ing. In other words, Figure 3 shows the concentrations that
would be measured at a certain time after administration
when the bladder is voided for the first time since dose
administration.
Urine concentrations after ergogenic
salbutamol use
Simulations of urine concentrations over time resulting from
a daily 8 mg oral dose (unacceptable usage), show that con-
centrations decline rapidly below the threshold after ceasing
the regimen (Figure 4). Within the first 24 h, the vast majority
of subjects are already below the threshold, and after 2–3
days, none of the athletes will produce urine concentrations
above the threshold.
Discussion
We synthesized a model based on literature data alone that
was able to adequately describe and predict the complex
pharmacology of salbutamol in plasma and urine. The
developed model was used to simulate possible outcomes
of the maximum allowed dose of salbutamol in elite
athletes, to show how current (WADA) standards for urine
collection and analysis do not adequately take into account
the large number of factors contributing to variability (dose
amount and timing and physiological variability). This
large variability leads to large uncertainty in determining
the
dose
that
was
used,
showing
the
implemented
approach is not fit for purpose. It will lead to incorrect
accusations of violation, whereas many violations will go
unnoticed.
Applied correction factors by WADA
The general WADA rules for salbutamol use and control
depicted in the introduction apply in all cases, but WADA
describes two additional relevant specifics for the procedure.
First, when collecting the urine sample from the athlete, the
doping control officer will check the specific gravity of the
urine produced by the athlete. If this is smaller than 1.005
when measured with a refractometer or smaller than 1.010
when measured with lab sticks, the athlete is required to
provide further samples, until a suitable sample is collected
[26]. The testing authority together with the laboratory
decide which samples shall be analysed, although it is not
clear on which criteria this decision is based. This procedure
is presumably designed to prevent false negative findings
due to diluted urine. However, it should be noted that due

 to bladder voiding for the first sample, the urine concentra-
tion of any subsequent sample will be driven by the plasma
concentration at that moment and therefore potentially be
a substantial underestimation, as plasma concentrations

 have fallen since dose administration. Correcting urine
concentrations for urine osmolality (more accurate than
specific gravity) of a sample would therefore be a much
more rational way to normalize urine concentrations, and,
in addition, avoid the need for multiple samples and their
drawbacks.
Secondly, WADA corrects a measured urine concentration
for assay variability (measurement uncertainty) by adding to
the threshold concentration a guard band. The guard band
corresponds to the expanded measurement uncertainty of
the assay giving >95% coverage interval for a result at the
threshold concentration based on a 1-tailed normal distribu-
tion. It is calculated as 1.645 * ucMax (the maximum accept-
able combined standard uncertainty of the assay, being
100 ng ml�1 for salbutamol), rounded up to two significant
figures. A sample is determined to contain an adverse
analytical finding only if the concentration is above the
threshold plus the guard band, which is called the decision
limit (i.e. 1200 ng ml�1 for salbutamol) [27]. When this
decision limit is applied, 9.95% of subjects were above the
limit at 1 h post-dose in our simulated scenario. Throughout
the rest of this article, the limit of 1000 ng ml�1 is used for
clarity, as this is termed the threshold level by WADA, also
in the Prohibited List.
WADA deems it unnecessary to account for instability of
salbutamol or its metabolite in urine, which potentially could
impact measured salbutamol urine concentrations, as previ-
ous research shows that both salbutamol and its conjugate
metabolites seem to be stable in urine [28].
Involving pharmacology
So, the procedure involving specific gravity is rather dubious,
and although the correction for assay variability seems ap-
propriate, variability due to pharmacological processes are
not discussed by WADA. Our developed pharmacokinetic
model visualizes the underlying pharmacokinetic theory
linking urine concentration and dose, namely, the adminis-
tered dose being absorbed into the circulation and appearing
in urine as a fixed proportion of the amount in blood (renal
clearance). This concentration in urine varies with dose
amount and time after dose, bioavailability and absorption
rate from the lung and gut (for inhalation), distribution over
the body, renal clearance, urine volume and voiding. From a
clinical
perspective,
this
is
very
similar
to
creatinine
clearance, and as clinicians might know, it is impossible to
calculate the ‘dose of creatinine’ using only a single urine
concentration. Therefore, to be able to make an informed
estimate of the dose, one would need to know factors such
as the time of dose (which in the doping control setting they
do not), the physiological variability of the athlete (not
known), volume of urine over a timed period (not known)
and the plasma concentration (not known). And because
these factors are unknown in the doping control setting,
dose cannot be determined from the urine concentration.
This is exemplified by simulations from the model in
Figure 3, right panel, showing that even from a single dosing
scenario, an extremely wide range of urine concentrations
can be found. This would perhaps not be as problematic if a
certain dose (the maximum allowed dose) would never lead
to urine concentrations above the threshold for any subject,
but our simulations show that this is not the case either.
When collecting urine at 1 h (close to tmax), 15.4% of our
simulated subjects are above the threshold if they did not
void since dosing. Conversely, due to the large variability
and the unknown frequency of voiding and time since dos-
ing, there is also a high chance of finding urine concentra-
tions below the threshold with doses above the maximum
allowed
dose.
Given
the
relatively
short
half-life
of
salbutamol, anabolic use (i.e. large oral doses) could even be
halted shortly before a race, with no urine concentrations
above threshold to be found by urine doping tests. Using
our model, simulations of daily oral administration of 8 mg
salbutamol over two weeks, with a washout period of 2 days
resulted in 0% urine concentrations above the WADA thresh-
old (Figure 4) when applying a normal micturition pattern
(three times a day). Moreover, within 24 h, the majority of
subjects would already produce a urine concentration below
the threshold. This indicates that even high doses that have
been shown to improve peak sprint power in elite endurance
athletes [23], will not lead to adverse analytical findings in
the majority of cases if the athlete ceases dosing at least the
day before an event.
Burden of proof
In the current situation, WADA does seem to acknowledge
the problem of variability to some extent as an athlete that

 produced
a
urine
sample
with
an
unacceptably
high
salbutamol concentration, is given the possibility to prove
this was a result of a dosing scheme within WADA limits
by means of a controlled pharmacokinetic study. Hereby
WADA transfers the responsibility of resolving the flaws in
the rules designed by WADA itself to the athlete. Setting
up such a study and getting the desired result will take
months at least. And even if an athlete does prove their in-
nocence, this could already do major damage to their repu-
tation (see the Froome case); that is, if showing innocence is
successful at all, as this might not prove simple. Although
intra-subject variability will be smaller than the previously
described inter-subject variability, substantial variability will
still be present within a subject. It is therefore not unlikely
that many trials will be needed to produce another urine
sample that exceeds the threshold with allowed dosages,
even more so because it will be difficult to reproduce the
circumstances leading to the original finding. Aside from
this being a very expensive and time-consuming venture
for the athlete, the fact that the foundation on which these
WADA rules are based in the first place are flawed as we
have shown, makes placing the burden of proof with the
athlete completely unacceptable.
Alternative solutions
All these arguments make one wonder why the current pro-
cedure is being used by WADA. Speculation about a used
dose of salbutamol from a urinary concentration (even
when it would be adjusted for osmolality) is open to serious
criticism and cannot be used to affect the career of an
athlete. A better approach would be to collect timed urine
samples
over
a
specified
period
and
possibly
take
a
midpoint blood sample. In addition, S-SAL concentrations
in urine could be incorporated, as this metabolite would
accumulate more, especially after oral dosing, due to slower
clearance and the first-pass effect. One may in fact use an
approach using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, as pro-
posed by Mu and Ludden, to determine the most probable
dose and dose-administration time [29]. Such an approach
would require the development of an accurate population
pharmacokinetic
model
of
salbutamol
(and
S-SAL)
in
cyclists,
including
salbutamol
in
urine,
with
samples
corrected for osmolality. This approach could help approxi-
mate the dose, but would require large amounts of samples
to be taken to achieve sufficient accuracy and precision.
Without such dense data, uncertainty in estimating the
dose would remain due to individual pharmacokinetic
variability and the unknown factor of time since dosing.
Given that the performance enhancing activity of beta-2
agonists is dubious, especially in endurance sports, the
question arises whether it is worth the effort of screening
for these compounds.
Limitations
In this paper we reviewed the procedure implemented by
WADA in the control for salbutamol doping and indicated
that these are fundamentally flawed. Many of these prob-
lems are no different from those encountered in clinical
practice and clinical pharmacology, and so the theory and
knowledge from these disciplines were applied in this study
to the issue of doping control. We developed a population
pharmacokinetic model based on literature data to substan-
tiate and quantify that theory, but there are some limita-
tions to the model. No individual data on both plasma and
urine concentrations were available for model development,
such as that of Haase et al. [6]. Such data would allow proper
estimation of inter-individual variability, leading to better
prediction of concentration bandwidths. However, given
the good performance of the visual predictive check in
Figure 2, there does not seem to be overprediction of the
variability in urine concentration. The results of this visual
predictive check also make it unlikely that inter-laboratory
or inter-assay differences would impact extrapolation of
our model to the WADA doping control laboratory setting:
the pharmacokinetic analysis in the study used for the plot
was performed by the WADA-accredited doping control lab-
oratory in Norway [6]. Furthermore, variability on physio-
logical parameters could only partially be based on actual
data. For example, data on additional variability due to the
extreme circumstances during professional cycling is not
available and thus could not be accounted for. Two variabil-
ities were fixed to 23% (omega = 0.05), which is typically
referred to when discussing physiology, and deemed reason-
able. In addition, several parameters originally derived from
dogs required manual adjustment to properly align with the
Haase et al. [6] data. Furthermore, the salbutamol concentra-
tion in the doping control assay used by WADA is based on
the sum of the glucuronide conjugate (expressed as the free
drug) and free salbutamol concentrations. For the purpose of
this study, we did not explicitly take into account the
glucuronide conjugate of salbutamol, as its contribution to
the concentration measured in urine is only very limited,
with concentrations below the lower limit of detection of
2 ng ml�1 in 100% of subjects after inhalation of 800 mcg
of salbutamol and 70% of subjects after oral administration
of
8
mg
(and
<3%
compared
to
the
unconjugated
salbutamol for the remaining subjects) [30]. However, if
there is an impact, this would only add to the variability in
observed urine concentrations. Similarly, this variability
might increase if we incorporated variable urine production
(due to increased fluid intake or dehydration) rather than a
constant urine production rate that was applied in the
model.
Finally, our model is supported by data from a clinical
study [30], reporting that out of 28 subjects (including eight
asthmatic elite athletes) inhaling a single dose of 800 mcg
of salbutamol, there was one subject with a urine concentra-
tion above the 1000 ng ml�1 threshold when analysing the
urine sample taken 4 h post-dose (urine collection between
0 and 4 h). This means in this study, 3.6% of subjects
exceeded the urine concentration threshold with allowed
use, which is similar to the observed 3.0% when simulating
1000 subjects with our model in this scenario, supporting
the validity of our model.
Our
approach
therefore
shows
the
feasibility
of
modelling exercises, including integration of pre-clinical
and clinical data, with the possibility of clinical trial
simulations/not-in-trial simulations and optimal design.
Above all, we show that this approach, originating from
traditional clinical pharmacology, can also be applied in this
setting of doping control.

 Conclusion
Pharmacokinetic theory dictates that it is not possible to
derive the administered dose with any certainty from a single
random urine concentration when there is no information
about timing of the dose, urine volume or osmolality and
individual physiological variability. Using a pharmacokinetic
model based on literature data, we substantiated this notion.
We
demonstrate
that
the
current
approach
to
detect
excessive salbutamol use is fundamentally flawed and cannot
differentiate between illegal and allowed use and inadver-
tently leads to incorrect assumptions of violation. If the
community is determined to control for excessive salbutamol
use, these procedures should be changed. The expertise
present in the field of clinical pharmacology is clearly
relevant in doping control, and we therefore advocate a closer
collaboration between the two disciplines to work towards a
sport that is as clean and fair as possible.
Competing Interests
There are no competing interests to declare. J.H. is a recrea-
tional cyclist and is a fan of professional road cycling, but,
other than as a spectator and from its clinical pharmacology
aspects, is not involved in the sport. S.v.D. and A.C. watch
professional cycling but are mainly excited by its clinical
pharmacology aspects.
