Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by motor neuron loss, leading to paralysis and death 2–5 years following disease 
onset1. Nearly all ALS patients contain aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in the 
brain and spinal cord2, and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS3. There 
are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA interference

 approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases4. Indeed, 
treating a rodent model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in SOD1) with ASOs to SOD1 
significantly slowed disease progression5. But since SOD1 mutations account for only ~2–5% of 
ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not 
warranted given its critical cellular functions1,6 Here we present an unexpectedly powerful 
alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS, by targeting ataxin 2. Lowering ataxin 2 suppresses 
TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies7, and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the 
ataxin 2 gene increase risk of ALS7,8. We used two independent approaches to test whether 
reducing ataxin 2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy9. First, 
we crossed ataxin 2 knockout mice to TDP-43 transgenic mice. Lowering ataxin 2 reduced 
TDP-43 aggregation, had a dramatic effect on survival and improved motor function. Second, in a 
more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin 2 to the central 
nervous system of TDP-43 mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because 
TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all ALS cases6, targeting ataxin 2 could represent a 
broadly effective therapeutic strategy.
To test the hypothesis that reducing ataxin 2 levels can rescue neurodegenerative phenotypes 
caused by TDP-43 accumulation, we first used a genetic approach. There are several 
transgenic mouse lines that express wild type or mutant TDP-43, using various strategies10. 
We selected a mouse line expressing human wild type (WT) TDP-43 under control of the 
Thy1 promoter, which drives pan-neuronal expression starting at around postnatal day seven 
(P7). We chose this mouse line because it presents robust and consistent phenotypes caused 
by abnormal TDP-43 accumulation. Whereas mice hemizygous for the TDP-43 transgene 
(TDP-43Tg/+) are viable, fertile, and grossly normal, mice harboring two copies of this 
transgene (TDP-43Tg/Tg) display profound motor dysfunction, resulting in an inability to 
walk around P21 and death around P249,11. In this study, we euthanized the animals when 
they were no longer able to right themselves. This humane euthanasia endpoint is a distinct 
advantage of this TDP-43 mouse model because it is directly dependent on motor 
dysfunction, an ALS-relevant phenotype. The degenerating neurons in brain and spinal cord 
of TDP-43Tg/Tg mice contain ubiquitinated and phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates, the 
pathological hallmark of ALS patients2. This rapidly progressing phenotype provided a 
powerful readout of disease suppression to test potential therapeutic interventions. To lower 
ataxin 2 we used two independently generated lines of ataxin 2 knockout mice on different 
genetic backgrounds (see online methods). Heterozygous (Atxn2+/−) and homozygous 
(Atxn2−/−) mice are viable and fertile, with Atxn2−/− mice exhibiting some mid-life onset 
obesity phenotypes12,13. We crossed TDP-43Tg/+ mice with Atxn2+/− mice to produce 
TDP-43Tg/+Atxn2+/− offspring and then intercrossed these mice to produce 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+, TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/−, TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/−, and WT littermates 
(see online methods).
Decreased levels of ataxin 2 in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/− mice significantly improved lifespan 
compared to TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ (Fig. 1a) and complete removal of ataxin 2 in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice resulted in a dramatic 80% improvement in median lifespan 
(Fig. 1b), with several TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice surviving longer than 300 days. None of 
the TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice survived longer than 29 days. We observed significant

 lifespan extension with ataxin 2 reduction in both mouse lines we created (Extended Data 
Fig. 1 a–d). Within the entire TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− population, we found evidence for two 
groups of responders (strong and weak), and the genetic background of the mice 
significantly contributed to this variability (Cox proportional hazards p = .002, line A:B HR 
= 6.8; Extended Data Fig. 1f).
In addition to extending survival, reducing ataxin 2 slowed disease progression and 
improved motor function. All mice were able to walk efficiently by P13 (SI Video 1, 2). As 
previously described9, TDP-43Tg/Tg mice started to display a mild tremor and had some 
difficulty walking around P15, which steadily progressed to a severe tremor and complete 
lack of joint movement in the hindlimbs around P21 (SI Video 3). Reducing ataxin 2 levels 
in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/− and TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− animals significantly lowered gait 
impairment scores (see online methods) starting at P15 (Fig. 1c) and slowed the rate of 
progression of gait impairment (Fig. 1d). Lowering ataxin 2 also mitigated tremor (Fig. 1e) 
and kyphosis (hunched posture that can be caused by neurodegeneration; Fig. 1f). Even after 
an age at which all TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice had reached the humane euthanasia endpoint 
(SI Video 4), several of the TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice had no overt motor dysfunction (SI 
Video 5). We confirmed TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice have a ~30% and ~27% reduction in 
cortical layer V pyramidal neurons and lower motor neurons, respectively9. We found a 
significant rescue of layer V neurons and a trend towards lower motor neuron rescue in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 2).
Reducing levels of ataxin 2 did not affect mRNA or protein levels of the human TDP-43 
transgene in mouse brain tissue (Extended Data Fig. 3,4). Total TDP-43 (human and mouse) 
protein levels also were not significantly affected by ataxin 2 reduction (Extended Data Fig. 
4). Thus, the beneficial effect of reducing ataxin 2 levels does not appear to act by reducing 
TDP-43 expression.
Ataxin 2 is an RNA-binding protein with multiple roles in RNA metabolism, including 
acting as a regulator of stress granule assembly14,15. Stress granules are highly dynamic, 
transient intracellular accumulations of RNA and protein that form when translation is 
stalled in response to cellular stress. We and others have proposed that concentrating 
aggregation-prone proteins like TDP-43 in stress granules can seed the formation of 
pathological protein aggregates in ALS16,17. Stress granule induction increases the levels of 
insoluble TDP-43, and TDP-43 inclusions can persist after stress granule dissolution18,19. 
Several lines of evidence suggest that TDP-43 inclusion formation may be directly involved 
in disease progression. ALS-associated mutations in TDP-43 increase the aggregation 
propensity and/or stability of the protein6,19,20. Additionally, TDP-43 inclusion pathology is 
correlated with neuron death in ALS patients21 and disease severity in TDP-43 mouse 
models9–11. Thus, we hypothesized that lowering ataxin 2 might reduce the propensity of 
TDP-43 to transit to stress granules and subsequently form pathological aggregates, and that 
this could prevent neurodegeneration.
To investigate the mechanism by which ataxin 2 levels influence TDP-43 we first performed 
experiments with cultured human cells to visualize stress granules dynamics. Stress granules 
formed rapidly and, over time, underwent a maturation process in which they fused to form

 larger structures (Fig. 2a), consistent with their liquid-like material properties22. We knocked 
down ataxin 2 with siRNA and this markedly delayed the maturation of stress granules – at 
each time point, the stress granules were smaller and more numerous than in the control 
siRNA treated cells (Fig. 2a–c). Endogenous TDP-43 was recruited to stress granules, 
consistent with previous reports19, and was readily recognized by phosphorylation-specific 
and C-terminal epitope TDP-43 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 5). Knocking down ataxin 2 
significantly decreased the proportion of cells with stress granules containing endogenous 
TDP-43 (Fig. 2e,f). These data provide evidence that lowering ataxin 2 modulates stress 
granule dynamics and decreases the recruitment of TDP-43 to stress granules. We 
hypothesize that inhibiting the recruitment of TDP-43 into stress granules might reduce the 
propensity of TDP-43 to form pathological inclusions.
We next tested this hypothesis in vivo by defining the impact of lowering ataxin 2 levels on 
TDP-43 inclusion formation in TDP-43 transgenic mice. Aggregated TDP-43 in ALS patient 
neurons can become detergent insoluble, phosphorylated, and cleaved to form C-terminal 
fragments (CTFs). It is not clear what role these pathological alterations play in 
pathogenesis, but they are highly correlated with, and indicative of, pathological inclusion 
formation23,24. We found RIPA insoluble, urea soluble full-length TDP-43 was four times 
higher in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice than WT littermates (Fig. 3a,b). We also detected 
insoluble TDP-43 CTFs in TDP-43 transgenic mice (Fig. 3a,c). Reducing ataxin 2 
moderately decreased levels of insoluble full-length and CTF TDP-43 (Fig. 3a–c). To 
visualize TDP-43 inclusions, we performed immunohistochemistry on spinal cord sections 
of TDP-43 transgenic mice. We used three different phospho-specific TDP-43 antibodies 
(pTDP-43 Ab1, Ab2, Ab3). We detected round, predominantly nuclear inclusions in 
TDP-43Tg/Tg mice when immunostaining with pTDP-43 Ab1 or with TDP-43 antibodies 
that are not phosphorylation specific (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f,q,s). The other two pTDP-43 
antibodies tested (pTDP-43 Ab2 and Ab3) recognized nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions 
that were much more numerous (Extended Data Fig. 6g). We did not detect inclusions in 
WT littermates with any of the TDP-43 antibodies tested (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d,m–p). 
Additionally, we found that cells with nuclear inclusions had lower levels of diffuse nuclear 
TDP-43 staining (Extended Data Fig. 6u). This suggests inclusion formation may sequester 
TDP-43 and cause a partial loss of TDP-43 function, which can be toxic to neurons in 
vivo25. To investigate whether ataxin 2 reduction had an impact on TDP-43 pathology, we 
quantified spinal cord inclusions and found that pTDP-43 Ab1-positive and pTDP-43 Ab2-
positive were reduced by 75% and 45%, respectively, in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice (Fig. 
3d–h). These results support the hypothesis that lowering ataxin 2 mitigates TDP-43 toxicity 
by decreasing the propensity of TDP-43 to form pathological aggregates.
Given the striking amelioration of disease seen with ataxin 2 genetic reduction, we sought to 
further explore the translational potential of lowering ataxin 2 levels in a more 
therapeutically-applicable manner using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). ASOs are 
highly stable, synthetic nucleic acids that specifically hybridize with an mRNA target, 
triggering RNase H-mediated cleavage and degradation of the mRNA while leaving the 
ASO intact4. We screened a collection of ASOs for safety and efficacy (Extended Data Fig. 
7 and 26), and used the most effective and well-tolerated ASO for further studies. 
Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 4 μg of the Atxn2 ASO at P1 did not affect the

 home-cage behavior or grip strength of WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 7d). We also did not 
detect an increase in expression of genes associated with gliosis or inflammation (Extended 
Data Fig. 7e–i), suggesting this dose of ASO did not produce adverse side effects.
To test whether ASOs targeting Atxn2 could mitigate disease in TDP-43 transgenic mice, we 
administered TDP-43 transgenic mice and WT littermates with a one-time ICV injection of a 
non-targeting control ASO or Atxn2 ASO at P1 (Fig. 4a). Both ASOs were well tolerated by 
the mice at this dose, and the Atxn2 ASO successfully reduced levels of Atxn2 mRNA by 
77% on average when assessed at P21 (Fig. 4b). Neither ASO affected expression levels of 
the human TDP-43 transgene (Fig. 4c). TDP-43 transgenic mice injected with the Atxn2 
ASO had a striking 35% increase in median lifespan compared to control ASO injected 
littermates (Fig. 4d) and had significantly improved motor performance by P21 (Fig. 4e; SI 
Video 6). Two of the 16 TDP-43Tg/Tg mice treated with Atxn2 ASO survived over 120 days, 
whereas no control ASO treated TDP-43Tg/Tg mouse lived past 32 days. Therefore, a single 
administration of ASOs targeting Atxn2 into the central nervous system is sufficient to 
greatly prolong survival and improve motor performance of TDP-43 transgenic mice.
We have shown by two independent approaches that lowering levels of ataxin 2 markedly 
increases lifespan and improves motor function in TDP-43 transgenic mice. Additionally, we 
have demonstrated that lowering ataxin 2 decreases the burden of TDP-43 inclusions, which 
provides mechanistic evidence that ataxin 2 may modulate toxicity by affecting the 
aggregation propensity of TDP-43. In support of this hypothesis, ataxin 2 and TDP-43 
physically interact in an RNA-dependent manner and ALS-associated polyglutamine 
expansions in ataxin 2, which enhance stability7, can increase TDP-43 pathological 
modifications27. We demonstrate that lowering ataxin 2 impairs the maturation of stress 
granules, which are hypothesized to facilitate the pathological aggregation of TDP-4316,17. 
Indeed, reducing ataxin 2 in cultured cells decreases recruitment of endogenous TDP-43 to 
stress granules. Beyond ataxin 2, this general strategy of targeting factors required for the 
assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules per se could be pursued as a way to mitigate 
TDP-43 pathological aggregation and neurodegeneration.
Reduction of ataxin 2 has exciting therapeutic potential for ALS and FTD because TDP-43 
pathology is a component of 97% of ALS cases and nearly 50% of FTD cases6. Although 
complete knockout of ataxin 2 seems well tolerated in mouse, further preclinical studies are 
required to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of ataxin 2 knockdown in the 
mammalian central nervous system. It is, perhaps, inspiring that there are currently clinical 
trials to test ASO therapies for Huntington disease (targeting HTT)28, familial ALS 
(targeting SOD1)29, and spinal muscular atrophy (targeting SMN2 splicing)30. Indeed, in 
patients with familial ALS caused by SOD1 mutations, ASOs targeting SOD1 administered 
as an intrathecal infusion were well tolerated29. Reducing ataxin 2 levels to treat TDP-43 
proteinopathy is the first proposed ASO therapy for neurodegenerative disease designed to 
target a modifier gene that is not directly causative of the disease. This type of approach will 
likely be essential for treating sporadic ALS, which makes up over 90% of cases, because of 
the vital cellular roles of TDP-43.

Mouse crosses
TDP-43 transgenic mice were generated by Samir Kumar-Singh’s lab and have been 
previously described9,11. TDP-43Tg/+ mice were purchased from JAX (stock no: 012836, 
B6;SJL-Tg(Thy1-TARDBP)4Singh/J). TDP-43Tg/+ mice were maintained on a B6/SJL 
hybrid background by crossing with F1 hybrid mice from JAX to propagate the strain (stock 
no: 100012, B6SJLF1/J). Ataxin 2 knockout mouse lines have been previously 
described12,13. Atxn2+/− mice created by G.A.’s laboratory were backcrossed to C57/Bl6 
mice for 10 generations and then maintained on the congenic C57/Bl6 background by 
crossing with WT non-littermates within the same line. Atxn2+/− mice created by S.M.P.’s 
laboratory were maintained on a B6129S hybrid background by crossing with Atxn2+/− 
males with F1 hybrid females from JAX (stock no: 101043, B6129SF1/J). Atxn2+/− mice 
from G.A. or S.M.P. were crossed with TDP-43Tg/+ mice in order to create lines A and B, 
respectively. Data for this project were collected from the offspring of TDP-43Tg/+Atxn2+/−, 
TDP-43Tg/+Atxn2+/+, and TDP-43Tg/+Atxn2−/− mice each crossed with other non-littermate 
mice (to avoid genetic drift) of the same genotype, respectively, within the same line.
We collected data for gait lifespan, gait impairment, and other phenotypes in two 
independent trials for each line. These trials were performed 4 months apart with different 
breeding pairs. After we performed a search of current literature analyzing lifespan in mouse 
models of neurodegenerative disease, we concluded that 20 animals total was likely a 
sufficient number in two separate trials to see an effect size worth additional consideration. 
The first trial of the study was performed with approximately 10 animals per genotype. We 
intended to do a power analysis using data from this cohort, but the lifespan and the other 
behavioral analysis data were already statistically significant. Therefore, standard power 
analysis methods were no longer applicable. We repeated the study in a second trial for a 
final sample size of 18–28 animals (Figure 1). All mice were genotyped through Transnetyx 
(Cordova, TN). Protein, RNA, and histological analyses were performed using mice from 
line B. Approximately equal numbers of males and females were used in all analyses.
ASO validation and administration
We screened a collection of ASOs designed to target various regions of the mouse Atxn2 
mRNA. After screening Atxn2 ASOs for their ability to reduce Atxn2 levels in cultured 
mouse cells, and for toxicity in WT mice, we tested several ASOs by delivering them 
through a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection into the brain of P1 mice, and used 
the most effective and well-tolerated ASO for further studies. For the data presented in Fig. 
4 and Extended Data Fig. 7d,i, P1 neonatal mice received an intracerebroventricular (ICV) 
injection of 3 μL of ASO in PBS (a total of 45 μg) were injected into the left ventricle using 
a NanoFil 10 μL syringe (World Precision Instruments) and a 33-gauge needle. The 
coordinates for injection were 2 mm anterior to the lambdoid suture, 1 mm lateral from the 
sagittal suture, and 2 mm deep. Within each litter, half of the pups (randomly chosen) were 
treated with a control ASO (CsCoToAoTAGGACTATCCAGGAA) and the other half were 
treated with an ASO targeting mouse Atxn2 (CTTCACATTTCGATCCAACA). Both ASOs 
were developed and synthesized by Ionis Pharmaceuticals. ASOs were synthesized as

 described 26 and were 20 bp in length, with five 2′-O-methoxyethyl (MOE) modified 
nucleotides at each end of the oligonucleotide, and ten DNA nucleotides in the center. The 
backbone of the ASOs consists of a mixture of phosphorothioate (PS) and phosphodiester 
(PO) linkages: 1-PS, 4-PO, 10-PS, 2-PO and 2-PS (5′ to 3′).
For the data presented in Extended Data Fig 7a–c, e–h, WT mice were injected via ICV at 
P1 with 45 μg in 3 μL of Atxn2 ASO or PBS control. Mice were sacrificed at P28 for RNA 
analysis. Quantitative PCR for Atxn2 mRNA was performed using forward primer 
CACTTCAGATTTCAACCCGAAC, reverse primer TGACTGGTAGCGAGAAGGT, and 
probe TAGTTAATGGAGGTGTTCCCTGGCC. In an independent study to determine the 
safety of repeated injections of the Atxn2 ASO, we injected WT mice at 5 weeks of age and 
again at 9 weeks then performed an observational study for 8 weeks. The animals moved 
normally within the cage, and did not have any overt tremor or gait impairment.
Care of TDP-43Tg/Tg mice
Humane experimental protocols were performed as approved by the Administrative Panel of 
Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) of Stanford University, an institution accredited by the 
Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). 
In crosses where impaired TDP-43Tg/Tg mice were possible offspring, high-fat breeder chow 
was placed in the cage from P16-21 to prepare the pups for prompt weaning. To avoid 
aggression towards the impaired TDP-43Tg/Tg mice by littermates and parents and to ensure 
the TDP-43Tg/Tg mice received adequate nutrition, all pups were weaned at P21. 
TDP-43Tg/Tg mice that had not reached the euthanasia endpoint by this time were weaned 
into cages separate from other littermates. All TDP-43Tg/Tg were given wet food (Clear2O 
diet gel 76A) in a cup on the floor on of the cage from P21 until death to ensure that the 
impaired mice could easily chew their food and readily access food and water. Even severely 
impaired mice were observed eating, defecating, and micturating. The mice were weighed 
every few days and no mice were found to weigh less than 75% of their maximum body 
weight.
Phenotype scoring and humane euthanasia endpoint determination
All phenotype scoring was performed blinded to the genotype or treatment group of the 
animal, and the order in which the animals were tested each day was random. Mice were 
placed on a textured plastic surface within an empty cage and observed as they moved 
around the cage. Gait impairment scoring was adapted from previously described methods31. 
The gait impairment score measures dysfunction, not overall motor proficiency, and is 
therefore translatable even to young mice. A score of 0, no impairment, was given if the 
mouse walked normally. A score of 1 was given if the mouse had a tremor or appeared to 
limp while walking. A score of 2 was given if the mouse had a severe tremor, severe limp, 
lowered pelvis, or feet pointing away from the body during locomotion (“duck feet”). A 
score of 3 was given if the mouse had difficulty moving forward, minimal joint movement, 
feet not being used to generate forward motion, difficulty staying upright, or its abdomen 
dragging on the ground. A score of 4 marked the euthanasia endpoint in which the mouse 
fell over and was unable to right itself within 30 s on all 3 of 3 trials. The endpoint was 
tested daily after a mouse had received a gait score of 3. Some of the severely impaired mice

 took 10–15 minutes to be fully roused, and therefore, mice were not tested for the euthanasia 
endpoint until they were moving around their cage. A humane euthanasia endpoint was used 
instead of natural death in survival analysis for the welfare of the animals, but it also served 
as a more precise endpoint that is directly dependent on motor dysfunction (an ALS-relevant 
phenotype) and less dependent on insufficient food and water intake. The mice did not 
appear emaciated or severely dehydrated prior to euthanasia, nor did they dip below 75% of 
their maximum body weight. Body weight did not differ among TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+, 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/−, and TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 1g).
For the kyphosis score, if the mouse was able to easily straighten its spine as it walked, and 
did not have persistent kyphosis, it received a score of 0. If the mouse exhibited mild 
kyphosis but was able to straighten its spine, it received a score of 1. If it was unable to 
straighten its spine completely and maintained persistent but mild kyphosis, it received a 
score of 2. If the mouse maintained pronounced kyphosis as it walked or while it sat, it was 
assigned a score of 3. Tremor was scored independently from 0 (not observed) to 3 (severe).
Mouse tissue collection
Anesthetized mice were perfused with PBS and the brain and spinal cord were carefully 
dissected and washed in chilled PBS. The brain was cut in half sagittally. The brain 
hemisphere used for immunohistochemistry, as well as the cervical and lumbar enlargements 
of the spinal cord, were placed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C for 48 hours then stored in 30% 
sucrose in PBS for at least 24 hours. The other brain hemisphere was cut into 8 predefined 
sections. These brain sections and the remaining spinal cord segments (upper cervical, lower 
thoracic/upper lumbar, and sacral) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for later RNA or 
protein collection and stored at −80°C. For all experiments using these samples (analyzing 
RNA or protein), the investigator was blinded to the genotype of the animal during the 
protocol and the samples were processed in a random order. Only biological replicates from 
individual mice are plotted in graphs.
RNA extraction and qPCR
RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies user guide 
publication MAN0000406), using TRIzol reagent and on-column PureLink DNase I 
treatment. Surfaces and equipment were cleaned with RNaseZap, and RNase-free pipette 
tips were used. In the first step of the protocol, flash-frozen tissue was kept on dry ice until 
200 μL of TRIzol reagent was added. A Kontes motor pestle with a clean RNase-free 
disposable pestle were used to rapidly and thoroughly homogenize the sample (~45 strokes). 
The rest of the TRIzol (800 μL) was then added and inverted to mix. The remainder of the 
RNA isolation protocol was carried out as directed by the aforementioned user guide. The 
RNA was converted to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. 
Standard TaqMan reagents, and the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System were used for 
qPCR with the following assays: human TDP-43 (Hs00606522_m1), mouse Atxn2 
(Mm00485946_m1), and mouse ActB (Mm02619580_g1). Each reaction was performed in 
triplicate. The relative transcript levels were calculated in excel by the following formula: 
(POWER (2, − (CT Mean target)))/(POWER (2, − (CT Mean ActB))).

previously 32. All buffers were chilled and had Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors, 1 
mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF added right before use. Snap-frozen tissue was kept frozen on 
dry ice and precisely weighed. All subsequent volumes are based on this initial weight. From 
the addition of hypotonic buffer on, samples were kept chilled on ice. All centrifugation 
steps were performed in a 4°C cold room. Briefly, tissue was homogenized by ~30 strokes of 
a Kontes motor pestle in 200 μL hypotonic buffer (10 mM Hepes, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
KH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2). After 
homogenization, additional hypotonic buffer was added to a final volume of 10 μL/mg, and 
the tubes were inverted to mix. After 10 min on ice, 2.5 M sucrose (0.5 μL/mg) was added. 
The homogenate was pipetted up and down to resuspend and centrifuged at 6,300 g for 10 
min. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed four 
times in chilled TSE buffer (10 μL/mg; 10 mM Tris, 300 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% 
IGEPAL, pH 7.5). For each wash, the homogenate was pipetted up and down to resuspend, 
the tube was inverted to clean sides of tube, and the sample was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 
5 min. The supernatant was clear by the final wash. The pellet of nuclei was resuspended in 
chilled RIPA buffer (5 μL/mg; Sigma). The sample was homogenized by pipetting up and 
down and incubated on ice for 10 min. During this incubation, each sample was passed 
through a 21G needle 20 times to shear viscous chromatin in the solution. The samples were 
spun at 21,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction.
Sequential solubility fractioning was performed in a similar manner as was described 
previously33. Extraction was performed on ice using chilled buffers until urea buffer was 
added. Tissue was weighed. All subsequent volumes are based on this initial weight. RIPA 
buffer (5 μL/mg; Sigma) with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor and 5 mM EDTA 
added just prior to use, was added to tissue chunk and thoroughly homogenized with Kontes 
motor pestle for approximately 45 strokes. The homogenates were incubated on ice for 10 
minutes and were transferred to polycarbonate centrifuge tubes. The samples were 
centrifuged (100,000g, 4C, 30 min) using a TLA 120.2 rotor. The supernatant was promptly 
and gently transferred to a new tube and stored at −80 °C. Pellet was washed by re-
extraction in the same volume of RIPA buffer using the motor pestle for approximately 30 
strokes. The samples were centrifuged again (100,000 rpm, 4C, 30 min) and the supernatant 
was discarded. The pellets were extracted in urea buffer (2 μL/mg; 7M urea, 2M thiourea, 
4% CHAPS, 30 mM Tris, pH 8.5) prepared just prior the experiment, homogenized using a 
motor pestle for approximately 30 taps, and centrifuged (100,000 rpm, 22C, 30 min). 
Supernatants were saved as the urea fraction and stored at −80 °C in aliquots.
Western blotting
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were heated at 70°C for 10 min with 1x LDS buffer. 
Proteins in LDS were run down 4–12% bis tris gels and transferred to nitrocellulose 
membranes. The membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) at RT for 1 
hour and treated over night at 4 °C with primary antibodies at the following dilutions: 
1:5000 Rb TDP-43 C-term (Sigma-Aldrich T1580), 1:1000 Ms human-specific TDP-43 
(Novus Biologicals H00023435-M01), 1:1000 Gt Lamin A/C (Santa Cruz 6215), 1:50,000

 Ms GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich G8795), 1:1000 Ms Ataxin 2 (BD 611378). Membranes were 
rinsed with PBST (0.1% Tween-20), washed x3 for 10 min, and treated with 1:20,000 Alexa 
fluor 680 or 790 conjugated IgG (H+L) raised in Donkey (Life Technologies) at RT for 1 
hour, rinsed with PBST, and washed 3x for 10 min before being developed on a LI-COR 
Odyssey scanner at laser intensity well below saturation.
Luminex assay
This assay was performed in the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University. 
Mouse 38-plex kits were purchased from eBiosciences/Affymetrix and used according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations with modifications as described below. Briefly: Beads 
were added to a 96 well plate and washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. Samples were added 
to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads and incubated at room temperature 
for 1 hour followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with shaking. Cold and Room 
temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500–600 rpm. 
Following the overnight incubation plates were washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer and then 
biotinylated detection antibody added for 75 minutes at room temperature with shaking. 
Plate was washed as above and streptavidin-PE was added. After incubation for 30 minutes 
at room temperature wash was performed as above and reading buffer was added to the 
wells. Each sample was measured in duplicate. Plates were read using a Luminex 200 
instrument with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine. Custom assay Control 
beads by Radix Biosolutions are added to all wells.
This assay was performed with brain tissue from P21 WT mice untreated (n = 5) or given P1 
ICV injection of the Atxn2 ASO (n = 4) or Ctrl ASO (n = 5). Each sample was processed in 
duplicate. The bead count and the coefficient of variation between duplicates were checked 
for each sample and epitope, and no cause was found to exclude values. Median 
fluorescence intensity (MFI) was averaged between the duplicates and normalized by 
dividing by the buffer background MFI for each respective epitope.
Mouse CNS Histology
Fixed sections were mounted in OCT and cut to a thickness of 40 μm using a Leica CM3050 
S Cryostat. Sections were stored in cryoprotective media (0.01 M sodium phosphate, 30% 
glycerin, 30% ethylene glycol) at −20°C. Washes were done 4 times for 5 min each in TBST 
(0.1% Tween-20), unless otherwise noted, at RT. Washes and incubation steps were 
performed with gentle rotation using an orbital rotator. The following primary antibodies 
were used: 1:2000 Rb TDP-43 phospho 409/410 “pTDP-43 Ab1” (Cosmo Bio TIP-PTD-
P01), 1:2000 Rb TDP-43 phospho 403/404 “pTDP-43 Ab2” (Cosmo Bio TIP-PTD-P05), 
1:1000 Rb TDP-43 phospho 409/410 “pTDP-43 Ab3” (a gift from Leonard Petrucelli’s 
laboratory, affinity purified 3655), 1:1000 Ms TDP-43 human-specific (Novus Biologicals 
H00023435-M01), 1:1000 TDP-43 C-term (Sigma-Aldrich T1580), 1:500 Ms NeuN 
(Millipore MAB377), 1:1000 Rb NeuN antibody (abcam ab177487), and 0.04 μg/mL Rb 
TDP-43 mouse specific (a gift from Virginia Lee’s lab: 2341-aa379).
For DAB-amplified immunohistochemistry, free floating sections were placed in a 12 or 24 
well plate with a rectangular specimen net insert, washed, pretreated for 20 min at RT in

 TBST with 0.1 % Triton-X and 0.6% hydrogen peroxide, washed, and blocked in 10% 
normal goat serum for 1 hour at RT. Primary antibody was diluted in TBST with 10% 
normal goat serum and incubated overnight at 4°C. The sections were then washed, treated 
with biotinylated goat anti rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Vector) at 1:500 in TBST 
for 1 hour at RT, washed, treated with an ABC kit (Vectastain) for 1 hour at RT, and washed 
using 0.1 M Tris pH 7.4 for the final wash. DAB solution was prepared by dissolving a 10 
mg DAB tablet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 20 mL of 0.1 M Tris pH 7.4. The solution was vortexed 
to dissolve, passed through a 0.45 μm filter unit, and 6 μL of 30% H2O2 was added right 
before use. All sections used in a single experiment were incubated simultaneously for 30 s 
to 2 min until the desired color change was reached. Sections were washed with 0.1 M Tris 
x4 for 5 min and mounted onto Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientific) in PB 
using a paintbrush. The slides were allowed to dry overnight and incubated in CitriSolv 
(Fisher Scientific) for a few minutes before immediate coverslipping with Entellan (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences). Sections were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope. 
pTDP-43 Ab1 inclusions per section were quantified by hand at 20x magnification blinded 
to the identity of the mice. Mice were quantified in a random order, but for technical 
reasons, all spinal cord hemispheres for a single mouse were quantified at the same time. For 
each mouse, 14–26 lumbar spinal cord hemispheres were quantified with 6 mice per 
genotype.
Alternatively, the sections were stained using immunofluorescence. The sections were 
washed then blocked/pre-treated in TBST with 0.1% triton-X and 10% normal goat or 
donkey serum (depending on secondary antibody host) for 1 hour at RT. Primary antibodies 
were diluted in TBST with 10% serum at 4°C overnight. The sections were then washed, 
treated with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) diluted at 
1:1000 in TBST with 10% serum for 3 hours, and washed again with Hoechst (1:5000) 
added to the final wash. Sections were mounted on frosted slides in PB using a paintbrush, 
and when the sections were no longer visibly wet, the slides were coverslipped using 
Prolong diamond antifade mountant (Molecular Probes). Slides were stored at 4°C for short 
term and −20°C for long term.
High quality representative images of Inclusions recognized by pTDP-43 Ab2 (Fig. 3f) were 
taken on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta Confocal microscope using a 10 μm z-stack with .37 μm 
steps (maximal intensity projections are shown). Inclusions recognized by pTDP-43 Ab2 
were quantified using 44 μm-thick z-stacks at 10x magnification (1 spinal cord hemisphere 
per image) on a Leica DMI6000B fluorescent microscope. Maximum intensity projections 
were created using Fiji. Images were randomized and blinded by renaming each image with 
a random number using python. Photoshop CS6 soft round brushes were used to occlude 
white mater and the dorsal horn. The images were then run through the MetaXpress 
granularity module to automatically quantify the number of inclusions per image in an 
unbiased manner. This method detects inclusions of a predetermined size range based on 
changes in surrounding pixel intensity. The optimal parameters for this experiment were 
empirically determined to be an approximate size range of 1.3–5.2 μm in diameter and pixel 
intensity change of 2500 graylevels. The area of gray matter quantified in each image was 
measured using Fiji (the area quantified for each hemisphere was approximately 0.5 mm2).

 The number of inclusions per image was divided by the area of that image, and these values 
were averaged for each mouse (average of 19 images per mouse).
To quantify diffuse nuclear TDP-43, spinal cord sections were stained with 1:1000 TDP-43 
C-term antibody, and imaged using a Leica DMI6000B fluorescent microscope. Using Fiji, a 
small circle was drawn in each nucleus (away from the inclusion, if an inclusion is present) 
to measure the diffuse TDP-43 signal. For TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice, cells with an obvious 
inclusion(s) and 2 nearby cells in the same focal plane without inclusions were quantified. 
For WT mice, 5 cells were quantified per image. There was no way to blind the 
experimenter because the inclusions either obviously present or absent in each image. Three 
mice per genotype were analyzed, with an average of 18 images and 126 cells counted per 
mouse.
To quantify cortical layer V neurons, 40 uM-thick sagittal brain sections were processed for 
immunofluorescence, as detailed above, using a Rb NeuN antibody. Images were taken at 5x 
using a Leica DMI6000B fluorescent microscope. Images were then blinded and processed 
in a random order. Quantification was performed using Fiji. Layer V was outlined using the 
polygon selection tool, “measure” was used to find the area of the selection, a threshold was 
applied using the “triangle” algorithm, the area outside the selection was removed using 
“clear outside,” and “watershed” was used to separate overlapping nuclei. The “analyze 
particles” tool was used to count nuclei that were greater than 50 μm in area and had a 
circularity from 0.2–1.0. The number of nuclei for each image was divided by the layer V 
area. For each mouse, 3–8 sections were quantified (see “Statistical analyses”).
Cell culture
To knockdown ataxin 2, Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA was used with 
the following target sequences: CCAAAGAGUAGUUAAUGGA, 
AAAGGUAUAUCACCAGUUG, GACAAGCCCUUCUUUCUAC, 
CUAAACGCAUGUCUUCAGA. Stress granule experiments were performed using 0.5 mM 
sodium arsenite in U2OS cells. Counting was done on a Leica Widefield scope at 63x. Only 
cells with more than one EIF3η puncta and seemingly viable nuclei were considered. Cells 
with at least one TDP-43 puncta which co-localized with EIF3η were considered to be 
positive for TDP-43 granules, otherwise they were considered to be negative. Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology EIF3η (sc-16377) and Proteintech C-terminal TDP-43 antibody (12892-1-
AP) were used for quantification. Phosphorylation-specific TDP-43 antibodies from 
CosmoBio (TIP-PTD-M01 and TIP-PTD-P05) and an ataxin 2 antibody (BD 611378) were 
also used to in stress granule images. TDP-43 positive stress granules were quantified at 60 
min of sodium arsenite exposure. At this time point, almost all cells had stress granule 
formation, but the few without were excluded from quantification. 116–146 cells were 
counted up per well for 3 separate wells for each siRNA used. The U2OS cell line was 
purchased from ATCC (HTB-96), an official cell line repository organization, and has not 
been validated since purchase. We tested the cell line for mycoplasma contamination by 
PCR in 2012, and it was negative. Since then, we regularly check for mycoplasma by DAPI 
staining, a method routinely used in the field. Mycoplasma contaminated cells show DAPI-
positive stain in the cytoplasm.

 Statistical analyses
Analyses were performed using R version 3.1.3 and Prism 6 (GraphPad), and graphs were 
plotted using Prism 6. Survival curves were compared using the survdiff function in the 
survival R package, which performs a log-rank test, and effect sizes are reported as the 
hazard ratios given by the coxph function, which fits a Cox proportional hazards model. For 
comparisons among different genotypes or treatment groups, ordinary one-way ANOVA or 
two-tailed, unpaired t-test were used when comparing three groups or two groups, 
respectively. For TDP-43 inclusion quantification, the number of inclusions per spinal cord 
section or image field was averaged for each animal. The animals were grouped by genotype 
and comparisons of interest were made between two groups using a two-tailed, unpaired t-
test. All data analyzed by ANOVA or t-test appeared to have a Gaussian distribution, and 
therefore parametric tests were used. If two groups compared by t-test appeared to have 
different standard deviations, an F-test was used to compare variances. We did not find any 
significant differences in variances among groups.
An ordinary two-way ANOVA was used to analyze Luminex 38-plex mouse cytokine assay 
data. Factor 1 was protein assayed; factor 2 was mouse treatment group. Pairwise 
comparisons among the three treatment groups were made for each protein. The Holm-Sidak 
method was used to compute multiplicity adjusted p-values. All 114 pairwise tests were 
considered within one family.
Linear mixed models (LMM, implemented using the lme4 R package) were used to 
determine if genotype has an effect on cortical layer V neuron density or average neuron cell 
body area. The LMM helps alleviate the pitfalls of statistically comparing groups with small 
sample sizes, while appropriately taking into account that multiple measurements came from 
the same mouse. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare the null hypothesis including 
only random effects terms for mouse and anatomical section to the alternative hypothesis 
including these terms as well as a fixed effect for genotype. A similar LMM was used to 
determine whether the presence of an inclusion had an effect on the level of diffuse TDP-43 
in neuronal nuclei. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare the null hypothesis including 
only random effects terms for mouse and image to the alternative hypothesis including these 
terms as well as whether an inclusion is present.
Whether mouse genetic background (line) affects lifespan was assessed using a Cox 
proportional hazards likelihood ratio test, comparing the null model including only genotype 
to an alternative model including genotype and line. The effect of sex on lifespan was tested 
analogously.
We assessed the evidence supporting the presence of two groups of responders (weak 
responders and strong responders) within the TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− population using two 
approaches, one Bayesian and one frequentist, both using the RStan R package. Both 
analyses suggest modest but significant support for two groups. In both analyses we 
compared how well a single Weibull distribution fit the TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− life span data 
compared to a mixture of two Weibull distributions. The Weibull distribution is a commonly 
used parametric survival model which generalizes the exponential distribution, with hazard 
function λpt−1 where λ is the rate parameter, p is the shape parameter, and t is time.

 In the Bayesian analysis, we estimated the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion 
(WAIC) 34 for the one and two component model using four chains of Hamiltonian Monte 
Carlo 35 with 2000 iterations each, the first 1000 of which were discarded as warmup. The 
difference in WAIC values was 3.3, suggesting positive support for the two component 
model. In the frequentist analysis we consider the one and two component models as null 
and alternative hypotheses respectively. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the 
component parameters (shapes and rates) for the two models, using LBFGS and 
marginalizing over mixture assignments. We use the likelihood ratio between these two 
models as a test statistic. We used a parametric bootstrap, sampling 1000 times from the 
empirical null (fit one component model) and refitting both models, to obtain the sampling 
distribution of the likelihood ratio. Under this distribution we obtain an empirical p-value of 
0.02 and thereby reject the one component null hypothesis in favor of the alternative two 
component hypothesis.

Extended Data Figure 1. Reduction of ataxin 2 using two independent lines of Atxn2 knockout 
mice lines extends lifespan of TDP-43 transgenic mice
Lines A and B were generated using Atxn2+/− mice from a congenic C57Bl/6 and a hybrid 
B6129S background, respectively. Within line A, TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/− (n = 7) (a) and 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− (n = 7) (c) mice lived significantly longer than TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ 
mice (n = 16). Within line B, TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/− (n = 13) (b) and TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− 
(n = 11) (d) mice also lived significantly longer than TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice (n = 12). 
Curves were compared by log rank test and effect size estimated by a Cox proportional 
hazards model (HR = hazard ratio). e) After taking genotype into account, the line that the 
mice came from, but not the sex of the mice, significantly affected lifespan. A Cox

found evidence for two groups of responders (strong and weak) in the TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− 
population (parametric bootstrap p = 0.02, see online methods). The Kaplan-Meier curve of 
all TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice from both lines is plotted, and the one and two group models 
are graphed. g) Knockout of Atxn2 did not affect weight in non-transgenic or TDP-43Tg/Tg 
adolescents. Means are plotted, and error bars indicate S.E.M.

mice
a) Representative NeuN stains of a sagittal sections through cortex. Layer V is marked by a 
green bar. Layer V neurons were 30% less numerous (b) and had smaller cell bodies (c) in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice. These phenotypes were significantly ameliorated in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice. Four mice were quantified per genotype, and the values for 
individual brain sections are plotted. Genotype groups were compared using linear mixed 
models with a random effect to appropriately account for the multiple measurements per 
mouse (see online methods). d) Representative NeuN stains of L5 lumbar ventral horn 
showing large lower motor neurons. e) Quantification of motor neuron cell bodies present in 
the ventral horn of the lumbar enlargement at levels L3-L6. There was an 27% decrease in 
motor neurons on average in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice compared to WT. Six P23 animals 
were used per genotype. Two-tailed t-tests were performed between groups of interest. 
Means are plotted, and error bars indicate S.E.M. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

 a) Nucleocytoplasmic fractioning of mouse brain tissue segregated the nuclear marker lamin 
A/C from cytoplasmic marker GAPDH. Nuclear levels of human TDP-43 (b) or total full-

terminal fragments (CTFs) were slightly elevated in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice (d). e–g) 
Cytoplasmic hTDP-43 (e) and total TDP-43 CTFs (g) were also unaltered among the

a–d,m–p)
None of the TDP-43 antibodies tested recognized inclusions in WT mice. One of the three 
phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) specific antibodies (e) and TDP-43 antibodies not 
phosphorylation-specific (f,h,q–t) recognized spherical, predominantly nuclear inclusions. 
The other two pTDP-43 specific antibodies (only one is shown) recognized smaller 
cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions (g). i,j,l) The first type of inclusion was very rare in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice. k) The second type of inclusion appeared smaller and reduced 
in number in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice. q–t) Nuclear inclusions were effectively stained 
with total TDP-43 (tTDP-43), human-specific TDP-43 (hTDP-43), and mouse-specific 
TDP-43 (mTDP-43) antibodies. s) Diffuse mTDP-43 is greatly decreased in TDP-43Tg/Tg 
mice, an expected outcome of TDP-43 autoregulation. u) Levels of diffuse nuclear tTDP-43 
were quantified by IF in WT neurons or TDP-43Tg/Tg neurons with or without inclusions. 
These 3 groups were compared in a pairwise fashion using linear mixed models with a term

cord. Samples were collected at P21. Scale bars are 10 μm.
Extended Data Figure 7. An antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting Atxn2 is able to 
successfully reduce mRNA levels throughout the central nervous system
a) ICV injection at P1 of an ASO targeting Atxn2 was able to successfully reduce levels of 
Atxn2 mRNA in the spinal cord by ~75% when assessed at P28. Atxn2 reduction was also 
seen in the cortex (b) and cerebellum (c). d) Grip strength of WT mice was not effected by 
Ctrl or Atxn2 ASO injection (n = 16 per treatment). Mean and SEM plotted. Genetic 
markers of gliosis, Aif1 and Gfap, were not altered in the spinal cord (e, f) or cortex (g, h) 
after ASO injection. i) Using a Luminex 38-plex assay, we could not detect a significant 
difference in inflammatory markers among uninjected WT mice (n = 5) and WT mice 
treated with the Atxn2 (n = 4) or Ctrl (n = 5) ASOs (two-way ANOVA treatment group 
factor p = .32). However, the ASO treated animals had a small increase in 1 of the 38 
markers, VEGF. Multiplicity-adjusted pairwise tests revealed that this difference was not 
significant for Atxn2 ASO treated mice (p = .17), but was for Ctrl ASO treated mice (p = .
006). Min to max plotted. a–c,e–h) Biological replicates and means are plotted.

 Figure 1. Reducing levels of ataxin 2 extends lifespan, improves motor function, and slows the 
rate of disease progression in TDP-43 transgenic mice
a,b) Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing survival of TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ (n = 28), 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/− (n = 20) and TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− (n = 18) mice. Curves were 
compared by log rank test, and effect size was estimated by a Cox proportional hazards 
model (HR = hazard ratio). c) The gait impairment score of TDP-43Tg/Tg mice worsened 
with age, but this was attenuated by reducing ataxin 2. d) A line was fit to each mouse’s gait 
scores over time and the slope of that line was plotted, grouping animals by genotype. The 
error bars are min to max, and the three groups were compared by ordinary one-way 
ANOVA. e,f) Tremor and kyphosis scores were also decreased by lowering ataxin 2 in 
TDP-43Tg/Tg mice. c,e,f) At each age, the three genotypes were compared by ordinary one-

 Figure 2. Knockdown of ataxin 2 delays the maturation of stress granules and decreases 
recruitment of TDP-43 to stress granules
a) An EIF3η antibody was used to visualize stress granules (SGs) in U2OS cells. During 
continued stress, stress granules fuse to form larger structures. ATXN2 siRNA inhibited 
maturation of stress granules, resulting in smaller, more numerous stress granules at each 
time point (quantified in b–c). d) Western blot of ataxin 2 knockdown (source data in SI Fig. 
1). e, f) Ataxin 2 siRNA treatment caused fewer cells to have TDP-43-positive stress 
granules at 60 minutes of arsenite exposure. b,c,f) The mean of 3 separate wells (116–146 
cells per well) is plotted for each data point. Two-tailed t-tests were used to compare 
treatment groups. Means are plotted, and error bars represent SEM. *p < .05, **p < .01, 
***p < .001.

 Figure 3. Lowering ataxin 2 levels decreases TDP-43 pathology
a) RIPA-insoluble, urea soluble full-length and CTF TDP-43 are elevated in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice (quantified b–c), and appeared moderately reduced in 
TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2−/− mice (source data in SI Fig. 1). d) Lumbar spinal cord hemispheres 
(SC hemi) stained with pTDP-43 Ab1. e) Magnification to the cellular level reveals weak, 
diffuse nuclear staining in WT mice, and pTDP-43 inclusions (arrow heads) and strong 
diffuse nuclear pTDP-43 (arrows) in TDP-43Tg/TgAtxn2+/+ mice. Fluorescent stains 
(Extended Data Fig. 6e) demonstrate that most pTDP-43 Ab1 inclusions are nuclear. f) 
pTDP-43 Ab3 reveals inclusions that are much more numerous and usually cytoplasmic 
(Extended Data Fig. 6g). Lowering ataxin 2 decreased pTDP-43 Ab1 inclusions at P21 (g), 
and pTDP-43 Ab2 inclusions at P23 (h) in lumbar spinal cord. Two-tailed t-tests were 
performed between groups of interest. Means are plotted, and error bars indicate S.E.M. *p

 Figure 4. ASOs targeting ataxin 2 extend lifespan and improve motor performance in TDP-43 
transgenic mice
a) P1 mouse pups were treated with Ctrl or Atxn2 ASO via ICV injection. At P21, mRNA 
levels of Atxn2 (b) were decreased by 77% in the Atxn2 ASO-injected mouse brains without 
affecting mRNA levels of the human TDP-43 transgene (c). d) Lifespan was significantly 
extended by Atxn2 ASO treatment (n = 16) vs Ctrl ASO (n = 17). Curves were compared by 
log rank test, and effect size was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. e) Gait 
impairment score was also improved in Atxn2 ASO treated mice (n = 14) by P21 compared 
to Ctrl ASO (n = 20). Two-tailed t-tests were used to compare the two treatment groups at 
each age. Means are indicated, and error bars indicate S.E.M. *p < 0.05
