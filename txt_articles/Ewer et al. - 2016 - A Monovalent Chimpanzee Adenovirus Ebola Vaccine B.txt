BACKGROUND
The West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease that peaked in 2014 has caused more 
than 11,000 deaths. The development of an effective Ebola vaccine is a priority for control 
of a future outbreak.
METHODS
In this phase 1 study, we administered a single dose of the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 
(ChAd3) vaccine encoding the surface glycoprotein of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) to 60 
healthy adult volunteers in Oxford, United Kingdom. The vaccine was administered in 
three dose levels — 1×1010 viral particles, 2.5×1010 viral particles, and 5×1010 viral particles 
— with 20 participants in each group. We then assessed the effect of adding a booster 
dose of a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) strain, encoding the same Ebola virus glyco-
protein, in 30 of the 60 participants and evaluated a reduced prime–boost interval in 
another 16 participants. We also compared antibody responses to inactivated whole 
Ebola virus virions and neutralizing antibody activity with those observed in phase 1 
studies of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–based vaccine expressing a ZEBOV 
glycoprotein (rVSV-ZEBOV) to determine relative potency and assess durability.
RESULTS
No safety concerns were identified at any of the dose levels studied. Four weeks after 
immunization with the ChAd3 vaccine, ZEBOV-specific antibody responses were similar 
to those induced by rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination, with a geometric mean titer of 752 and 921, 
respectively. ZEBOV neutralization activity was also similar with the two vaccines (geo-
metric mean titer, 14.9 and 22.2, respectively). Boosting with the MVA vector increased 
virus-specific antibodies by a factor of 12 (geometric mean titer, 9007) and increased 
glycoprotein-specific CD8+ T cells by a factor of 5. Significant increases in neutralizing 
antibodies were seen after boosting in all 30 participants (geometric mean titer, 139; 
P<0.001). Virus-specific antibody responses in participants primed with ChAd3 remained 
positive 6 months after vaccination (geometric mean titer, 758) but were significantly 
higher in those who had received the MVA booster (geometric mean titer, 1750; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
The ChAd3 vaccine boosted with MVA elicited B-cell and T-cell immune responses to 
ZEBOV that were superior to those induced by the ChAd3 vaccine alone. (Funded by the 
Wellcome Trust and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02240875.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he recent outbreak of Ebola virus 
disease (EVD) in West Africa has led to 
more than 11,000 deaths, with a peak in 
mortality from August through December of 
2014 and a subsequent decline in the number 
of new cases. The development of a durable and 
effective Ebola vaccine is a priority both to elimi-
nate the remnants of the outbreak and to pre-
vent and control future epidemics. Several candi-
date vaccines have shown promising results in 
phase 1 trials,1-6 and a recombinant vesicular 
stomatitis virus–based vaccine expressing the sur-
face glycoprotein of Zaire ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) 
showed efficacy in an interim analysis of a 
phase 3 trial in Guinea (ring vaccination trial).7 
More data will be required before the rVSV-ZEBOV 
vaccine can be licensed. However, the use of this 
vaccine could contribute to ending the current 
outbreak in West Africa by limiting the spread of 
infection among close contacts of persons with 
EVD. In this context, the duration of vaccine ef-
ficacy can be relatively short, since the time 
since exposure is typically known and protection 
is conferred within the time frame necessary to 
prevent clinical disease and transmission. In a 
different context, during the earlier, uncontrolled 
phase of an outbreak in which most transmis-
sion is undetected and new cases appear in geo-
graphically disparate locations, an effective vac-
cine would need to have longer durability. For 
this earlier phase of the outbreak, longer-lasting 
vaccine efficacy would be required to provide 
sufficient protection to the entire population 
within an affected area to interrupt transmis-
sion, particularly where transmission is unpre-
dictable.
The demonstration in humans of vaccine ef-
ficacy against EVD with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine 
has facilitated the development of an Ebola virus 
vaccine by adding to our knowledge of immu-
nity associated with protection, data that were 
previously derived only from rodent and primate 
challenge models. Before the current outbreak 
and the subsequent trial of rVSV-ZEBOV, licen-
sure of an Ebola vaccine was dependent on the 
demonstration of adequate immunogenicity and 
safety in humans, along with linkage to immu-
nogenicity and efficacy data in challenge studies 
conducted in nonhuman primates.8 Now we can 
compare cellular and humoral immune responses 
induced by various candidate vaccines in phase 1 
studies with responses observed in rVSV-ZEBOV 
trials, in which various measures of humoral 
immunity (e.g., ZEBOV glycoprotein–specific 
antibody responses and neutralizing antibody 
titers) have been described in African and Euro-
pean cohorts.4 In contrast, substantial cellular 
immunogenicity induced by rVSV-ZEBOV immuni-
zation has not been shown in nonhuman primate 
models or in recent human phase 1 trials.3,4,9,10
The induction of both antibodies and CD8+ 
T-cell responses is potentially protective against 
EVD. Antibody levels as measured on an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the 
Mayinga strain glycoprotein of ZEBOV had broad 
correlation with protection across a range of 
studies of vectored vaccination conducted in 
cynomolgus macaques, with a reciprocal titer of 
3700 correlating with complete protection against 
challenge.11,12 However, after immunization of 
macaques with a protective vaccine dose of hu-
man serotype 5 adenovirus (AdHu5), antibodies 
did not adoptively transfer protection to other 
macaques, and depletion of CD8+ T cells largely 
ablated protection.13 This finding indicates a 
potential role for induced CD8+ T cells in vaccine 
efficacy and the likelihood that the observed 
antibody correlate is not a causal mechanism. 
Such immune activity may reflect a constellation 
of induced T-cell and antibody responses, both 
of which may contribute to protection. In cyno-
molgus macaques, the addition of a booster vac-
cination with a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) 
strain to priming immunization with the chim-
panzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3) vaccine encoding 
the ZEBOV surface glycoprotein increased immu-
nogenicity by a factor of at least 10 and increased 
the duration of protective efficacy against Ebola 
virus challenge from 5 weeks to 10 months after 
vaccination,11 which indicates that boosting im-
proves both immunogenicity and durability of 
protection.

Among the 30 participants who received a booster dose of the MVA vaccine, 18 received a dose of 1.5×108 plaque‑forming units (PFU) and 12 received a dose of 3×108 PFU, with strati‑
fication according to priming‑dose group.
‡  
Two additional groups of 8 participants each were recruited to assess the effect of reducing the interval between priming and boosting to either 1 week (group 4) or 2 weeks (group 5). 
The 16 participants in these two groups received a priming dose of 2.5×1010 viral particles of ChAd3 and a boosting dose of 1.5×108 PFU of MVA.

Study Oversight
The study was reviewed and approved by the 
United Kingdom National Research Ethics Ser-
vice, the Committee South Central–Oxford A, 
the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regula-
tory Agency, and the Oxford University Clinical 
Trials and Research Governance team, who mon-
itored compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines. An independent data and safety mon-
itoring board provided safety oversight.
The ChAd3 vaccine was provided by the Vac-
cine Research Center of the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and 
GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactured the vac-
cine. The MVA vaccine was produced under a 
contract between NIAID and Fisher BioServices.
Study Design
In this phase 1 study, we administered the ChAd3 
vaccine to 60 participants; 20 participants re-
ceived the vaccine in a dose of 1×1010 viral par-
ticles (group 1), 20 received the vaccine in a dose 
of 2.5×1010 viral particles (group 2), and 20 re-
ceived the vaccine in a dose of 5×1010 viral par-
ticles (group 3). In addition, in an attempt to 
improve immune responses, we invited 10 partici-
pants from each of the three groups to receive 
a single booster dose of MVA (called MVA-BN 
Filo), which encodes the same Mayinga strain 
glycoprotein antigen as that encoded by the 
ChAd3 vaccine, along with glycoproteins of the 
Sudan Ebola virus species and Marburg virus and 
the nucleoprotein of Taï Forest Ebola virus.
From late November to early December 2014 
(at 3 to 10 weeks after the priming immuniza-
tion), we administered the MVA vaccine at a dose 
of 1.5×108 plaque-forming units (PFU) to 18 par-
ticipants and at a dose of 3×108 PFU to 12 partici-
pants, with stratification according to priming-
dose group. We then recruited and immunized 
two additional groups of 8 participants each to 
assess the effect of reducing the interval be-
tween priming and boosting to either 1 week 
(group 4) or 2 weeks (group 5). In this analysis, 
all the participants received a priming dose of 
2.5×1010 viral particles of ChAd3 and a boosting 
dose of 1.5×108 PFU of MVA.
Details regarding the study design and par-
ticipants are provided in Figure S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org. Additional data on vac-
cines, safety-assessment techniques, and study 
design are provided in the study protocol, also 
available at NEJM.org.
Assessment of Humoral Immunity
We assessed antibody responses using four sepa-
rate types of IgG ELISA: an in-house standardized 
ELISA that was developed at the Jenner Institute 
and uses a recombinant ZEBOV glycoprotein, a 
commercially available ZEBOV glycoprotein ELISA 
kit (Alpha Diagnostic International), an end-point 
ELISA performed at the National Institutes of 
Health with a readout for the EC90 assay (the 
concentration at which there is a 90% decrease 
in antigen binding), and a whole-virion ELISA 
that uses inactivated ZEBOV Makona (the cur-
rent outbreak strain). Two assays were used to 
measure neutralizing antibodies. The first mea-
sured direct neutralization of live ZEBOV (Mayinga 
strain) from all participants who received the 
booster dose at 28 days after the dose of ChAd3 
vaccine and 14 days after the dose of the MVA 
vaccine. The second measured the blocking abil-
ity of vaccine-induced antibodies with the use of 
a pseudotyped lentivirus expressing the glyco-
protein from the Mayinga strain, with a readout 
of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) assay. 
A competitive ELISA-based assay was also used 
to detect blocking of a neutralizing monoclonal 
antibody (4G7)14 by serum after boosting with 
MVA. (A detailed description of the immuno-
logic analyses is provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
T-Cell Assays
We measured T-cell responses to vaccination us-
ing ex vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays at all time points 
and flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine 
staining at the peak of the immune response af-
ter each vaccination. T-cell assays were performed 
on freshly isolated peripheral-blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs).
Results
Study Population
A total of 76 of the 123 volunteers who were 
screened for eligibility were vaccinated (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 60 partici-
pants who were included in the original analysis 
of the ChAd3 vaccine, 59 completed at least 28 days 
of follow-up. One participant in group 1 withdrew

on day 1 after vaccination owing to an aversion 
to venipuncture. Communication with the par-
ticipant on day 10 after vaccination confirmed 
that the participant remained well, with no symp-
toms to report. Among the participants who 
were followed for 180 days were all 30 who re-
ceived the MVA booster and 28 who did not 
receive the booster.
Safety
A complete list of the frequency and maximum 
severity of solicited, unsolicited, and laboratory 
adverse events, according to dose group, is pro-
vided in Tables S1 through S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. The majority of adverse events 
that were reported in all dose groups were mild 
in severity, with no unexpected serious adverse 
reactions or serious adverse events. Local reacto-
genicity appeared to be more pronounced after 
boosting vaccination than after priming vaccina-
tion, a finding that is consistent with the results 
of other studies of heterologous prime–boost 
vaccine schedules incorporating a ChAd prime 
and MVA booster. In contrast, fewer systemic 
adverse events were reported with boosting vac-
cination than with priming vaccination.
The majority of adverse events were self-limited 
and mild. Local pain was the most common 
local event (with one case reported as severe). 
Moderate systemic adverse events were fever, 
myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fatigue, nausea, 
and malaise. No severe systemic solicited adverse 
events were reported. Four episodes of mild fever 
(37.6 to 38.0°C in 4 participants) were reported. 
No fever persisted for more than 24 hours.
A prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin 
time was observed in four participants during 
the first 2 weeks after vaccination (three with a 
grade 1 elevation and one with a grade 2 eleva-
tion). None of the prolongations were associated 
with symptoms or clinical features of coagulopa-
thy. The elevations fully resolved in all partici-
pants by 10 weeks after vaccination. No further 
abnormality was found on extended hematologic 
and coagulation evaluation.
A transient induction of an antiphospholipid 
antibody causing an in vitro artifact on the labo-
ratory assay for activated partial-thromboplastin 
time after the administration of adenovirus vec-
tors has been reported previously.15,16 Transient 
mild lymphocytopenia was noted on day 1 after 
vaccination in five participants in group 1, four 
in group 2, and eight in group 3; moderate lym-
phocytopenia was noted in two participants each 
in group 2 and group 3 on day 1. Transient mild 
or moderate elevations in bilirubin were recorded 
in three participants in group 2 and three in 
group 3. Transient hyperbilirubinemia in the 
severe range was recorded in two participants 
(one in group 2 and one in group 3) who had a 
prevaccination diagnosis of Gilbert’s syndrome.
Antibody Responses
Antibody responses as measured by means of 
standardized glycoprotein ELISA increased sig-
nificantly by 7 days after the MVA dose and 
peaked at day 14 after boosting and then de-
creased slightly by day 28 (P<0.01 by the Fried-
man test for all comparisons) (Fig. 1A). Respons-
es remained significantly above pre-boost levels 
at 180 days after MVA vaccination and were four 
times as high as titers measured at 180 days 
after priming with the ChAd3 vaccine alone 
(P<0.001 by the Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. 1B); in 
addition, 100% of the participants who received 
the MVA vaccine remained seropositive, as com-
pared with less than half of those who received 
the priming vaccination alone.
Titers on whole-virion ELISA showed that im-
munogenicity at 4 weeks after priming with 
ChAd3 was similar to that measured after im-
munization with rVSV-ZEBOV in 10 vaccinees in 
Hamburg, Germany, at the dose administered 
in the ring vaccination study (geometric mean 
titer with ChAd3, 752.4; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 541 to 1647; geometric mean titer with 
rVSV-ZEBOV, 920.7; 95% CI, 541 to 1566). In our 
study, after boosting with MVA, titers increased 
by a factor of 9 (geometric mean titer, 6625; 95% 
CI, 4748 to 9245) at 1 week and by a factor of 12 
(geometric mean titer, 9007; 95% CI, 6909 to 
11741) at 4 weeks (Fig. 1C).
Six months after vaccination, titers in the 
group primed only with ChAd3 were similar to 
those detected 1 month after vaccination (geo-
metric mean titer, 758; 95% CI, 561 to 1023; 
P 
= 
0.90 by the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-
pairs test). Titers remained significantly higher 
in the group that received the MVA booster 
(geometric mean titer, 1750; 95% CI, 1247 to 
2456) than in the ChAd3 prime-only group 
(P<0.001 by the two-tailed Mann–Whitney test). 
At that time, 77% of vaccinees in the group that 
received the MVA booster remained seropositive,

bles S9 through S12 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
Neutralizing antibody titers to live ZEBOV 
(Mayinga strain) from all participants who re-
ceived the MVA booster were measured at 28 
days after the ChAd3 dose and at 14 days after 
the MVA dose (Fig. 1D). Low levels of neutral-
izing antibodies were detected in participants at 
28 days (geometric mean titer, 14.9; 95% CI, 12 
to 18.5) — levels that were similar to those re-
ported after the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine4 (geometric 
mean titer, 22.2; 95% CI, 15.7 to 31.4); by 14 
days after the MVA vaccine, the levels had in-
creased by a factor of 9 (geometric mean titer, 
139; 95% CI, 90 to 215) and all participants were 
seropositive (geometric mean titer, >8). Boost-
ing with the high dose of MVA elicited neutral-
izing antibody titers that were higher than those 
with the low dose (geometric mean titer in the 
high-dose group, 243.9; 95% CI, 96 to 628; geo-
metric mean titer in the low-dose group, 95.7; 
95% CI, 65 to 142; P 
= 
0.03 by the two-tailed 
Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. 1D). (Additional de-
tails regarding neutralizing antibodies and IgG 
antibodies are provided in Fig. S2 and S3 in the

A Monovalent Chimpanzee Adenovirus Ebola Vaccine
The dose of ChAd3 or MVA vaccine had no 
significant effect on post-boost IgG titers, nor 
did the interval between priming and boosting 
vaccinations affect the magnitude of the anti-
body response (r 
= 
0.20, P 
= 
0.30) (Fig. S3C in the 
Supplementary Appendix). However, there was 
a significant positive correlation between the 
prime–boost interval and the neutralizing anti-
body titer, regardless of the MVA dose (r 
= 
0.72, 
P<0.001) (Fig. S3D in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Antibody induction to the Sudan Ebola 
virus glycoprotein was assessed, but as expect-
ed in the absence of priming with this antigen, 
antibody titers against the Sudan virus glycopro-
tein were not detected after administration of the 
prime vaccine, which suggests a lack of cross-
reactivity to the Sudan strain with antibodies 
raised against the ZEBOV glycoprotein. However, 
after boosting with the MVA vaccine (which ex-
presses a Sudan Ebola virus glycoprotein), IgG 
titers increased significantly (geometric mean 
titer before boosting, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.2; 
geometric mean titer 14 days after boosting, 1.5; 
95% CI, 1.1 to 2.0; P<0.001 by the Friedman test) 
(Fig. S3F in the Supplementary Appendix).
Cell-Mediated Immunity Induced  
by Vaccination
ELISPOT responses peaked 7 days after boosting 
with MVA at a median of 2068 spot-forming 
cells (SFCs) (interquartile range, 1197 to 3447) 
per million PBMCs and were significantly higher 
than peak responses after prime vaccination at 
14 days (SFCs, 633; interquartile range, 274 to 820; 
P<0.001 by the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-
pairs test). Responses were maintained at 180 
days after boosting (SFCs, 498; interquartile 
range, 207 to 905) and were significantly higher 
than non-boosted responses (SFCs, 84; inter-
quartile range, 50 to 192; P<0.001 by the Mann–
Whitney test) (Fig. 2A). There was a modest 
negative correlation between the prime–boost 
interval and the peak ELISPOT response 
(r 
= 
−0.42, P 
= 
0.03 by two-tailed Pearson’s corre-
lation coefficient) (Fig. 2B). However, there was 
no significant relationship between the magni-
tude of the antibody response and the T-cell re-
sponse (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, 0.17; 
P 
= 
0.39).
Intracellular cytokine staining revealed that 
all participants had positive CD4+ and CD8+ 
interferon-γ T-cell responses after boosting. The 
median frequency of CD4+ T cells secreting 
interferon-γ, interleukin-2, or tumor necrosis fac-
tor α (TNF-α) increased from 0.13% (interquar-
tile range, 0.004 to 0.19) at 14 days after prime 
vaccination to 0.20% (interquartile range, 0.15 
Figure 1 (facing page). Antibody Responses to the Zaire 
ebolavirus (ZEBOV) Glycoprotein.
Panel A shows the geometric mean titer of antibody re‑
sponses to increasing doses of the chimpanzee adeno‑
virus 3 (ChAd3) vaccine encoding the surface glyco‑
protein of ZEBOV, followed by a booster dose of a 
modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) strain. Antibody re‑
sponses are shown according to measurements on a 
standardized enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) for doses of 1×1010 viral particles (in 19 partici‑
pants), 2.5×1010 viral particles (in 20 participants), and 
5×1010 viral particles (in 20 participants). Solid symbols 
indicate that participants received only the ChAd3 vac‑
cine, and open symbols, that participants received the 
ChAd3 vaccine followed by booster MVA. Antibody re‑
sponses increased significantly by 7 days after the MVA 
dose and peaked at day 14 after boosting and then de‑
creased slightly by day 28. There were no significant 
differences in responses among the dose groups in 
the cohort that received the MVA booster at any time 
point after vaccination. The days of the analysis are indi‑
cated by a plus sign after administration of the ChAd3 
vaccine (A) and the MVA vaccine (M). Panel B shows 
the responses of participants after administration of 
the prime and booster vaccines, according to results on 
anti‑ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) IgG ELISA. The solid hori‑
zontal lines represent the geometric mean titer. Percent‑
ages of vaccinees with positive antibody responses at 
each time point are indicated below the graph. The hori‑
zontal dashed line represents the threshold for a posi‑
tive result (arbitrary ELISA units, +0.561), calculated as 
the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the response on 
day 0 for all participants. Panel C shows antibody titers 
to inactivated whole ZEBOV virions (Makona strain)  
as measured on ELISA. The data show that immuno‑
genicity at 4 weeks after priming with ChAd3 was simi‑
lar to that measured after immunization with a recombi‑
nant vesicular stomatitis virus–based vaccine expressing 
ZEBOV glycoprotein (rVSV‑ZEBOV) in 10 vaccinees in 
Hamburg, Germany. Panel D shows titers of neutraliz‑
ing antibodies against live ZEBOV (Mayinga strain) from 
all participants who received the MVA booster, as mea‑
sured at 28 days after the ChAd3 dose and 14 days after 
the MVA dose. Low levels of neutralizing antibodies 
that were detected in participants at 28 days were sim‑
ilar to levels reported after the administration of the 
rVSV‑ZEBOV vaccine. By 14 days after MVA vaccination, 
the levels had increased by a factor of 9. In Panels C 
and D, the columns represent the geometric mean titer, 
the I bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and the 
horizontal dashed lines represent the positive threshold. 
In Panels B and D, the asterisk denotes P<0.001 by the 
two‑tailed Mann–Whitney test.

to 0.31) at 7 days after MVA boosting (P<0.001 
by the Kruskal–Wallis test) (Fig. 2C). The increase 
in the median frequency of cytokine-secreting 
CD8+ T cells was even more pronounced, from 
0.004% (interquartile range, 0.004 to 0.09) at 14 
days after prime vaccination to 0.25% (interquar-
tile range, 0.10 to 0.65) at 7 days after MVA boost-
ing (P<0.001 by the Kruskal–Wallis test).
The expression of the degranulation marker 
CD107a on CD8+ T cells increased by a factor of 
5 after boosting (P 
= 
0.003 by the Kruskal–Wallis 
test) (Fig. 2D). The MVA dose had no significant 
effect on the magnitude of the T-cell response as 
measured by means of ELISPOT (Fig. 2A) or in-
tracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 2C and 2D). 
Analysis of polyfunctionality confirmed the 
dominance of TNF-α–secreting CD4+ T cells 
over cells secreting either interferon-γ or inter-
leukin-2 (Fig. 2E). Cells that were positive only 
for interferon-γ and double-positive cells secret-
ing interferon-γ and TNF-α (with the latter being 
associated with protection in macaques17) were 
the largest subgroups in the CD8+ T-cell re-
sponse (Fig. 2E).
Short-Interval Boosting
Given the pivotal role that has been shown for 
T cells in preclinical efficacy studies in macaques 
and the finding of high T-cell and antibody 
 
immunogenicity even with the shortest prime–
boost intervals, we assessed the effect of re-
ducing the prime–boost interval further to either 
1 week or 2 weeks in two groups of eight par-
ticipants each. ELISPOT responses in the two 
groups still peaked at 7 days after boosting 
(Fig. 3A). We observed a modest negative corre-
lation between the prime–boost interval and peak 
T-cell immunogenicity among all participants 
(r 
= 
−0.30, P 
= 
0.04 by two-tailed Spearman’s cor-
relation coefficient) (Fig. 3B). In a comparison of 
the median ELISPOT response in groups that 
received the MVA booster dose at an interval of 
1 week, 2 weeks, or 3 to 10 weeks after the prim-
ing vaccination, there were no significant between-
group differences at either 7 days or 28 days 
after the MVA dose (Fig. 3C and 3D).
An analysis of antibody responses showed 
that reducing the prime–boost interval resulted 
in a decrease in the peak IgG titer after the MVA 
dose (P<0.05 for all comparisons) (Fig. S4A in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Additional cellu-
lar and humoral immunologic analyses are de-
scribed in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
The boosting ability of MVA, particularly to en-
hance T-cell responses, has been described pre-
clinically and clinically for vaccine candidates 
targeting several diseases18-22; however, data on 
boosting of virus-specific human neutralizing 
antibodies are lacking. In our study, we assessed 
such boosting ability with respect to the ChAd3 
vaccine, a relatively immunogenic priming agent, 
and report large enhancements of antibody and 
T-cell immunogenicity. We found induction of 
human neutralizing antibodies to Ebola virus at 
substantial titers by boosting, which correlated 
with the overall increased magnitude of anti-
body titers on IgG ELISA assays. Antibodies to 
the Sudan strain of Ebola virus glycoprotein 
were also detected after boosting, albeit at a low 
level. The induction of a response to the Sudan 
strain is an important consideration for future 
outbreak control. We also found an acceptable

of Cytokines after Boosting with MVA.
Panel A shows the median T‑cell responses to ChAd3 
vaccination and MVA boosting on enzyme‑linked im‑
munosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay at all time points, 
as measured in spot‑forming cells (SFCs) per million 
peripheral‑blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The dose 
of MVA is indicated in plaque‑forming units (PFU). 
Panel B shows the relationship between the prime–
boost interval and the peak ELISPOT response 7 days 
after MVA vaccination, as calculated by means of a 
two‑tailed Spearman’s test. Panel C shows the total 
 
cytokine response on flow cytometry with intracellular 
cytokine staining at 28 days after priming (post‑prime) 
or 7 days after boosting, according to the MVA dose. 
The secretion of interferon‑γ, interleukin‑2, and tumor 
necrosis factor α (TNF‑α) by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
was quantified for each booster‑dose group and ex‑
pressed as the frequency of cells expressing any one  
of the three cytokines. Panel D shows the expression 
of the degranulation marker CD107a 28 days after prim‑
ing or 7 days after boosting. In Panels C and D, the 
solid horizontal lines indicate median values, and the 
dashed horizontal lines indicate the positive threshold. 
Panel E shows the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
that secreted any combination of interferon‑γ, inter‑
leukin‑2, and TNF‑α after stimulation with two differ‑
ent MVA doses.

safety profile for MVA at the two doses and at 
all intervals that we evaluated. We found that 
boosting can be immunogenic for antibodies 
and T cells at prime–boost intervals as short as 
1 week. Such short-interval regimens may facil-
itate vaccine deployment in outbreak settings 
where both rapid onset and durable vaccine ef-
ficacy are required.
A single dose of the ChAd3 vaccine induced 
uniform protection shortly after vaccination and 
partial longer-term protection in macaques.11 In 
humans, the ChAd3 vaccine induced levels of 
anti-ZEBOV IgG and virus-neutralizing antibod-
ies that were similar to the levels in the rVSV-
ZEBOV ring vaccination study. Since no evidence 
of cellular immunogenicity has yet been report-
ed for the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, these vectors 
probably induce different immune responses. The 
induction of more CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells 
after the administration of the ChAd3 vaccine 
was unexpected on the basis of preclinical stud-
ies of these vaccine vectors, but we found that 
the T-cell balance was reversed to greater levels 
of CD8+ T cells after MVA boosting in humans. 
Figure 3. Effect of Reduced Prime–Boost Intervals on Cellular Immunogenicity.
Panel A shows the results of reducing the interval between prime vaccination with ChAd3 and booster vaccination 
with MVA to either 1 week or 2 weeks (as compared with 3 to 10 weeks) in two groups of eight participants each. 
The results are shown as median T‑cell responses on ELISPOT assay, as measured in SFCs per million PBMCs. D0 
indicates the beginning of the prime–boost interval for each group. Responses in all three groups peaked at 7 days 
after boosting, regardless of the prime–boost interval. Panel B shows the relationship between the prime–boost 
 
interval and the peak ELISPOT response 7 days after boosting, with a modest negative correlation between the 
prime–boost interval and peak T‑cell immunogenicity. Also shown are individual ELISPOT responses to summed 
glycoprotein peptide pools at 7 days (Panel C) and 28 days (Panel D) after boosting; no significant differences be‑
tween the groups were seen at either 7 days or 28 days. The black horizontal lines indicate median values. In these 
analyses, all the participants received 2.5×1010 viral particles of the ChAd3 vaccine and a booster dose of 1.5×108 
PFU of MVA.

A Monovalent Chimpanzee Adenovirus Ebola Vaccine
This increase in CD8+ T-cell levels may enhance 
the vaccine efficacy, since CD8+ T-cell depletion 
was found to reduce the efficacy of an adeno-
virus vaccine in macaques.13 The durability in 
protection that we observed with this regimen 
may result from help provided by CD4+ T cells. 
The cellular immunogenicity induced by the 
ChAd3 vaccine provides an additional potential 
mechanism to provide greater vaccine efficacy 
and durability than that provided by the rVSV-
ZEBOV vaccine, although this hypothesis cannot 
be confirmed without an efficacy trial.
The ChAd3 and MVA viral vectors have a num-
ber of other practical advantages in that large-
scale manufacturing processes concordant with 
Good Manufacturing Practice standards have 
been established and both vectors have been as-
sessed in large numbers of vaccinees for a range 
of indications without reports of any substantial 
safety concerns to date.18,23-30 Nonreplicating viral 
vectors have shown a reasonable safety profile 
and may be preferred to replication-competent 
vectors for widespread use in populations at risk 
for undetected immunodeficiencies.
We also found antibody responses that re-
mained positive 6 months after vaccination above 
a threshold associated with efficacy in humans. 
High-level durable efficacy is desirable for pro-
tecting populations against future epidemics and 
may be particularly important for high-risk 
populations such as health care workers. Single-
dose vaccines may prove to be preferable for lo-
gistic simplicity if just short-term efficacy is re-
quired in outbreak settings. However, we found 
that a 1-week interval between the administra-
tion of the prime vaccine and the booster vaccine 
provided CD8+ T-cell immunogenicity just 2 weeks 
after the prime dose. We also found higher anti-
body responses than with single-dose vaccination, 
even though such responses were lower than with 
longer prime–boost intervals. Taken together, 
these data provide a basis for consideration of 
particular vectored vaccine regimens for use in 
either prevention or control of an outbreak.
