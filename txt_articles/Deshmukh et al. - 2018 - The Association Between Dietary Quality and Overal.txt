Abstract
Given the recent emphasis on the totality of the diet by national guidelines, we examined the relationship between the
quality of diet and overall and cancer-specific mortality among cancer survivors. From the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1191 participants diagnosed with cancer were identified. Healthy Eating Index
(HEI) scores were utilized; higher HEI score indicated better adherence to dietary recommendations. During a median follow-
up of 17.2 years, a total of 607 cancer-specific deaths occurred. A high-quality diet (highest-quartile HEI score) was associated
with decreased risk of overall (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.45 to 0.77) and cancer-specific (HR ¼
0.35, 95% CI ¼ 0.19 to 0.63) mortality when compared with a poor-quality diet (lowest-quartile HEI score). Among individual
dietary components, the highest-quartile score for saturated fat intake was associated decreased cancer-specific mortality
(HR ¼ 0.55, 95% CI ¼ 0.36 to 0.86). Our results highlight the importance of a “total diet” approach to improving survival among
cancer patients.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015–2020) (1), MyPlate
guidelines (2), Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (3), and
Healthy People 2020 (4) have emphasized that a high-quality
“total diet”—and not just individual foods—plays a pivotal role
in health outcomes. In the past, dietary investigations have
tended to focus on the impact of specific nutrients, foods, or
bioactive food components on cancer incidence and mortality.
A growing body of evidence (5–9) suggests that a high-quality
and prudent diet are beneficial for specific cancer survivors (10),
which necessitates further investigation regarding the impor-
tance of overall diet quality and its association with oncologic
outcomes. Therefore, we examined the association between the
overall quality of dietary intake and all-cause and cancer-
specific mortality using a nationally representative sample of
cancer survivors.
We analyzed the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted between the years
1988 and 1994 (n ¼ 33 994). Participants in the NHANES are non-
institutionalized US civilians who are identified using a com-
plex, stratified, multistage probability sampling technique. The
survey includes an interview and an examination component.
The interview component contains the standardized question-
naires on demographics, socioeconomic status, diet, and health.
The medical examinations include data regarding medical, den-
tal, and physiological measurements and laboratory tests. A de-
tailed
description
of
the
survey

elsewhere
(11). Mortality from the date of the NHANES III participation
through December 2011 was obtained from the National Center
for Health Statistics Linked Mortality Files.
Participants age 18 years or older who were reportedly diag-
nosed with cancer (ie, replied “yes” when asked “has a doctor or
health care professional ever told you that you had skin or other
cancer?”) were included. Demographics, cancer diagnosis, and
dietary intake data were self-reported. An overall Healthy

illustrates cumulative incidence curves for high-quality and poor-quality dietary intake. The overall Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score was computed, and cases in the
highest quartile (overall HEI score �77) were identified as those consuming a high-quality diet, whereas those in the lowest quartile (overall HEI score �57.5) were
identified as those consuming a poor-quality diet. A) Cumulative incidence curves for all-cause mortality among all cancer-diagnosed patients (n ¼ 590). B) Cumulative

 diets. The NHANES III data use the 1994–1996 version of HEI. The
score is calculated using queries developed in Microsoft Access.
Details of these query strategies are available elsewhere (13).
Date and cause of mortality were identified from the mortal-
ity data file. The causes of mortality were defined using the
International Classification of Diseases coding (ICD-10). Overall
mortality included death due to any reason. Mortality was con-
sidered cancer specific if the reported cause was “malignant
neoplasm” (ICD-10: C00-C97).
We calculated the median, lower quartile, and upper quartile
scores for each of the 11 dietary scores (the 10 HEI dietary com-
ponents and the overall HEI). Hazards ratios adjusted for base-
line characteristics (age, sex, income, education, and body mass
index) and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabe-
tes, and cardiovascular diseases) were estimated to compare
the mortality risk between those in the upper (indicating high-
quality dietary intake) and lower (indicating poor-quality die-
tary intake) quartiles for each dietary component. To exclude
the participants who may have had underlying cancers at the
time of interview, we performed sensitivity analysis where we
censored deaths that occurred within a five-year follow-up win-
dow. All outcomes were assessed for the subgroups of skin can-
cer patients, non–skin cancer patients, and breast cancer
patients. The analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC)
and adjusted using NHANES sampling weights.
A total of 1191 NHANES III participants diagnosed with can-
cer with complete HEI scores were identified. The majority of
the patients were white (95%), female (60.3%), and between age
40 and 69 years (52.5%). The two most common oncologic diag-
noses were skin cancer (55%) and breast cancer (11%). The me-
dian overall HEI score was 68 (lower quartile ¼ 47.5, upper
quartile ¼ 77). Median scores for the 10 HEI components were
vegetable (7.3), meat (7), grain (6.5), fruit (4.7), dairy (6.5), total fat
(7.6), saturated fat (8.6), cholesterol (10), sodium (8.7), and vari-
ety (10). A total of 607 cancer-specific deaths occurred during a
median follow-up of 17.2 years.
Overall and cancer-specific mortality risks are presented in
Figure 1. A high overall HEI score was inversely associated with
overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.59, 95% confidence inter-
val [CI] ¼ 0.45 to 0.77). We found a similar association for
cancer-specific mortality (HR ¼ 0.35, 95% CI ¼ 0.19 to 0.63).
Findings for cancer-specific mortality were consistent among
the subgroups of nonskin cancer (HR ¼ 0.4, 95% CI ¼ 0.18 to 0.89)
and skin cancer (HR ¼ 0.25, 95% CI ¼ 0.11 to 0.58) (Figure 1). The
result of sensitivity analysis (ie, when deaths within a five-year
window were censored) for cancer-specific mortality was con-
sistent (HR ¼ 0.33, 95% CI ¼ 0.18 to 0.54) with the main analysis.
Among the individual dietary components, only saturated fat
intake was associated with cancer-specific mortality (Table 1),
but the effect size for this component (HR ¼ 0.55 for both) was
less pronounced than the overall HEI score.
Nutritional guidelines for the general populations in several
countries emphasize the need for a “total diet” approach to
healthy eating, but guidelines for cancer patients have tended
to focus on specific food components. Our study adds to a grow-
ing body of knowledge suggesting that an overall high-quality
dietary intake has a strong association with improved cancer-
specific mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer.
Our findings lend evidence to the emerging concept that a total
diet approach to healthful eating may be more impactful than
strategies based on specific nutritional components.
Our findings should be interpreted within the context of their
limitations. Dietary intake data in the NHANES are self-reported.
The HEI scores in our analysis are based on only one 24-hour
dietary recall and may not represent habitual dietary behavior.
Information on cancer was limited to diagnosis of cancer and
cancer type (eg, it was not possible to differentiate skin cancer
types); stage of cancer was not available. Finally, our results may
be confounded due to reasons other than diet, such as lifestyle
(eg, physical activity), cancer surveillance, and treatment.
In conclusion, overall high-quality dietary intake may pro-
tect against death among cancer survivors. Identifying optimal
combinations of foods and the mechanisms by which such
combinations affect cancer outcomes should be the focus of
population health and oncology research.
