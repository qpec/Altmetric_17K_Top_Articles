Abstract  
21 
E-cigarettes likely represent a lower risk to health than traditional combustion cigarettes, but 
22 
they are not innocuous. Recently-reported emission rates of potentially harmful compounds 
23 
were used to assess intake and predict health impacts for vapers and bystanders exposed 
24 
passively. Vapers’ toxicant intake was calculated for scenarios in which different e-liquids were 
25 
used with various vaporizers, battery power settings and vaping regimes. For a high rate of 250 
26 
puff day-1 using a typical vaping regime and popular tank devices with battery voltages from 3.8 
27 
to 4.8 V, users were predicted to inhale formaldehyde (up to 49 mg day-1), acrolein (up to 10 
28 
mg day-1) and diacetyl (up to 0.5 mg day-1), at levels that exceeded US occupational limits. 
29 
Formaldehyde intake from 100 daily puffs was higher than the amount inhaled by a smoker 
30 
consuming 10 conventional cigarettes per day. Secondhand exposures were predicted for two 
31 
typical indoor scenarios: a home and a bar. Contributions from vaping to air pollutant 
32 
concentrations in the home did not exceed the California OEHHA 8-h reference exposure levels 
33 
(RELs), except when a high emitting device was used at 4.8 V. In that extreme scenario, the 
34 
contributions from vaping amounted to as much as 12 µg m-3 formaldehyde and 2.6 µg m-3 
35 
acrolein. Pollutant concentrations in bars were modeled using indoor volumes, air exchange 
36 
rates and the number of hourly users reported in the literature for US bars in which smoking 
37 
was allowed. Predicted contributions to indoor air levels were higher than those in the 
38 
residential scenario. Formaldehyde (on average 135 µg m-3) and acrolein (28 µg m-3) exceeded 
39 
the acute 1-h exposure REL for the highest emitting vaporizer/voltage combination. Predictions 
40 
for these compounds also exceeded the 8-h REL in several bars when less intense vaping 
41 
conditions were considered. Benzene concentrations in a few bars approached the 8-h REL, and 
42 
diacetyl levels were close to the lower limit for occupational exposures. The integrated health 
43 
damage from passive vaping was derived by computing disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
44 
lost due to exposure to secondhand vapor. Acrolein was the dominant contributor to the 
45 
aggregate harm. DALYs for the various device/voltage combinations were lower than –or 
46 
comparable with– those estimated for exposures to secondhand and thirdhand tobacco smoke.

Introduction 
48 
Electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol –often referred to as “vapor”– that is primarily inhaled 
49 
by the user, but the vapor can also be partially released by exhalation and/or leaked from the 
50 
mouth into the environment, raising concerns about secondhand exposures. Use of e-cigarettes 
51 
is increasing rapidly in the US and many other countries, particularly among young consumers, 
52 
as vaping technology and practices continue to evolve.1 In May 2016 the US Federal Drug 
53 
Administration (FDA) finalized a ruling that authorized regulation of their manufacture, import, 
54 
packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, sales and distribution.2 Before this development, e-
55 
cigarettes had not been subject to the same restrictions as conventional tobacco products. 
56 
While e-cigarettes are likely to be less harmful than conventional tobacco products, misleading 
57 
marketing often portrays these products as generating non-toxic emissions that can safely be 
58 
used indoors.3, 4 The FDA ruling indicates that limiting exposures to secondhand e-cig vapor 
59 
must be considered, and more research on this topic is needed. At least six states in the USA 
60 
currently ban the use of e-cigarettes in public spaces to ensure 100% smoke free environments, 
61 
and a large number of municipalities, universities and private companies have adopted similar 
62 
measures.5 The objective of this study is to address the  critical need for exposure assessments 
63 
and prediction of the health effects associated with inhalation of mainstream and secondhand 
64 
vapor, e.g. by establishing valid quantitative comparisons with harm caused by conventional 
65 
cigarettes and other known exposures to toxicants. 
66 
 
67 
In a recently-published study, we quantified emissions from three e-liquids used in two 
68 
different e-cigarettes operated over a range of voltages from 3.3 V to 4.8 V under conditions 
69 
that reproduced a typical vaping regime.6  Emission factors for nine toxicants were determined 
70 
for initial and steady-state puffing regimes. Toxicants present in the vapor included 
71 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, diacetyl, acetol, glycidol, nicotine, nicotyrine and 
72 
benzene.  In the current study these emission factors are the inputs to calculations that predict 
73 
users’ intakes of toxicants in mainstream vapor, and non-users’ exposures to secondhand 
74 
 4 
 
 
 
vapor. The fractions of these toxicants retained by users were derived from published results 
75 
for electronic and conventional cigarettes, and incorporated into the calculation that generated 
76 
the inhaled doses and the contributions of vaping to indoor pollutant concentrations. 
77 
Secondhand exposures were derived for two scenarios corresponding to a typical home and 
78 
bars that allowed vaping, an occupational setting commonly found in the hospitality industry. 
79 
By quantifying these exposures, the resulting potential harm to passive vapers could be 
80 
predicted using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). This metric enables direct comparison of 
81 
the impacts of particular e-cigarettes with those associated with second- and thirdhand tobacco 
82 
exposures. DALYs are hereby proposed as a tool to predict the magnitude of the harm caused 
83 
by e-cigarette vapor in indoor environments.  
84 
Materials and Methods 
85 
Users’ retention of e-cigarette emissions  
86 
 
87 
The extent to which inhaled individual vapor constituents are retained in the mouth cavity and 
88 
upper respiratory tract was predicted from literature data for conventional and electronic 
89 
cigarettes as described below, assuming that the relevant physical, chemical and biological 
90 
processes are comparable for vaping and smoking. As the device is removed from the mouth at 
91 
the end of a puff, part of the undiluted vapor is pulled out, together with an additional amount 
92 
that can be voluntarily or involuntarily discharged prior to inhalation, becoming a source of 
93 
indoor air pollutants. In addition, exhaled breath contains toxicants that have not been fully 
94 
absorbed during puffing and also contribute to increasing indoor pollutant concentrations. 
95 
Hence, two quantities are used to establish the extent of retention by the vaper: the fraction of 
96 
vapor spilled from the mouth prior to inhalation, defined as mouth spill (MS), and the 
97 
compound-specific respiratory retention (RR) during an inhalation/exhalation cycle. The 
98 
retention factor for each compound (R) is thus computed as:

Two different clinical studies described by St Charles et al 7 showed significant agreement in the 
101 
quantitative evaluation of MS for conventional cigarettes. In order to account for the amount of 
102 
spilled smoke, the daily nicotine dose for each subject was compared with a nicotine mass 
103 
equivalent determined from urinary cotinine and other five urinary metabolites in both studies. 
104 
The results showed a broad normal distribution centered around MS = 30%. For our assessment 
105 
we adopted the range 20% < MS < 40%, which captures roughly the two central quartiles.  It 
106 
should be noted that puff duration and other topography parameters are different for 
107 
conventional and electronic cigarettes8, and for that reason using MS derived from tobacco 
108 
cigarettes may be a source of bias.  
109 
 
110 
Compound-specific RR values have been determined for only a few compounds 9-12, among 
111 
which formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and nicotine are relevant to this study  and 
112 
reported in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Values for the other compounds considered 
113 
here were predicted using a correlation between RR and the vapor pressure proposed by St 
114 
Charles et al 7, and are also listed in Table S1. Due to the high volatility of these toxicants, 
115 
predicted RR values are in the range 93-99%, consistent with almost quantitative absorption 
116 
into the respiratory tract. For that reason, MS is the dominant contributor to concentrations of 
117 
e-cigarette toxicants in indoor air.

Subscripts i refers to the applied voltage, j to the device considered, k to the e-liquid used, l to

session, E is the mass emitted per puff, R is the retention factor and N is the number of puffing 
127 
sessions in a day.  Vapers’ intake was estimated for a worst-case scenario of 250 puffs per day, 
128 
near the maximum daily number of puffs reported by a large number of vapers (n = 812).13 A 
129 
key observation in our previous study was that emission rates were not constant during a 
130 
puffing session. Emission rates increased during the initial 5-15 puffs (depending on the 
131 
device/voltage combination), reaching a steady state for subsequent puffs after that point. For 
132 
that reason, we investigated three different vaping regimes: 
133 
a) Frequent short sessions corresponding to 25 daily sessions of 10 puffs each. The 
134 
emission rates for this computation were only those that corresponded to the initial 
135 
conditions, since steady-state was never reached; 
136 
b)  Intermediate “typical” conditions, with 10 daily sessions of 25 puffs each, combining 
137 
initial and steady-state emission rates in roughly equal amounts, and 
138 
c) Infrequent long sessions, with only 5 daily sessions of 50 puffs each, in which steady-
139 
state emission rates predominate. 
140 
This matrix of puffing regimes allowed for a sensitivity analysis of our model, because vapers’ 
141 
behavior is one of the variables with most influence on the levels of exposure.  
142 
 
143 
The two vaporizers considered were the same used in our previous study: an eGO CE 4 single-
144 
coil vaporizer (“EGO”) and a dual-coil device, the Kangertech AerotankTM Mini (“AERO”). 
145 
Similarly, the three e-liquids were those used previously in our group: Apollo Classic Tobacco 
146 
(“CT”), Drip Mojito Mix (“MOJ”) and Drip Bubblicious (“BUB”).

Two indoor environments were considered, in which non-users could be exposed to e-cigarette 
151 
vapor: 1) a residential setting where a non-user lives with a user, and 2) a bar that allows vaping 
152 
indoors. The per-puff mass emission rates in exhaled vapor, EXH, were defined as the non-
153 
retained fraction of the e-cigarette emissions for initial and steady-state regimes, as follows:

Health impact assessment  
160 
 
161 
The integrated chronic harm caused by inhalation of secondhand vapor constituents was 
162 
predicted for the residential and occupational scenarios by calculating the corresponding DALYs 
163 
lost due to resulting illness, disability and premature death. DALYs are a measure of the overall 
164 
disease burden and incorporate both disease likelihood and severity.14, 15 This metric, used by 
165 
the World Health Organization, makes it possible to aggregate mortality and morbidity into a 
166 
parameter that can be used to compare across different health outcomes, chemical exposures 
167 
and affected populations. DALYs have recently been incorporated into health impact 
168 
assessments of exposures to indoor pollutants, including thirdhand smoke gases and particles. 
169 
16,17 This approach estimates, on a compound-by-compound and device-by-device basis, the 
170 
population-averaged health damage per year of exposure.16 In this study, DALYs were 
171 
computed from exposure estimates and toxicology-derived damage factors (δDALYs/δintake) 
172 
for VOCs as developed by Huijbregts et al.18 Using these values, the DALYs lost for one person 
173 
breathing chemical l, for one year, based on exposure were calculated with equation 5:

where ΔC is the difference in exposure concentration for the non-user compared to levels 
177 
predicted in the absence of vaping, and B is the breathing volume. The average breathing 
178 
volume used for adults over 16 years old was 15 m3 day-1, or 5475 m3 year-1, assuming that the 
179 
 8 
 
 
 
damage-intake relationship is linear in the range of interest.16 We did not use this approach for 
180 
primary users inhaling mainstream vapor because exposures are high and likely to be outside of 
181 
the linear range.  
182 
Damage factors were available for five of the toxicants considered in this study: formaldehyde, 
183 
acetaldehyde, benzene, acrolein and glycidol. A Monte-Carlo simulator (100,000 repetitions) 
184 
was used to develop a distribution of aggregate health damage for chronic intake of each 
185 
toxicant in the home and bar scenarios. Both exposures had similar toxicant profiles. Aggregate 
186 
harm was compared across scenarios using the same stochastically selected damage profiles for 
187 
each toxicant.

Results and discussion

190 
Impact on the user (vaper) 
191 
 
192 
Predicted toxicant intake. Figure 1 illustrates the effects of key parameters on the vapers’ 
193 
toxicant intake, as predicted by Equation 2. These parameters include the choice of vaporizer, 
194 
operation voltage and vaping regime, thus accounting for the key drivers of the impacts on 
195 
users’ intake. Uncertainty in the determination of the retention factor led to additional 
196 
variability, described with error bars in Figure 1. The effect of uncertainty in the retention factor 
197 
is further illustrated for one set of conditions in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The 
198 
variability associated with switching from one e-liquid to another is presented in Figure S2 
199 
(Supporting Information). 
200 
 
201 
The AERO device operated at lower temperatures than the EGO vaporizer at the same voltage.6 
202 
As a consequence, using the EGO device led to higher toxicant intakes than those predicted for 
203 
the AERO device when both were run at 3.8 V.  By increasing the voltage of the EGO device 
204 
from 3.8 V to 4.8 V, the intake of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein grew by an order of 
205 
 9 
 
 
 
magnitude. These volatile aldehydes are highly irritating to eyes and the respiratory system. 
206 
Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are also possible carcinogens (WHO/IARC Group 2B; US EPA 
207 
Group B2). These compounds were produced in larger amounts when the combinations of 
208 
device and voltages led to higher vapor temperatures.6 Such increases were not observed for 
209 
compounds such as nicotine and nicotryine, which are not pyrolysis byproducts. Diacetyl is 
210 
often considered to be a flavoring, but it was not present in the formulation of the e-liquids. Its 
211 
emission rates in the vapor increased by changing from AERO to EGO, and from 3.8V to 4.8V. 
212 
This similarity to volatile aldehydes suggests that diacetyl is formed as a decomposition 
213 
byproduct. Benzene has recently been reported as being formed as decomposition byproduct 
214 
as well.19 
215 
 
216 
For formaldehyde, acrolein and diacetyl, the daily doses predicted for a relatively high usage 
217 
rate of 250 puffs day-1 were comparable to or exceeded those derived from occupational health 
218 
guidelines. The maximum limit recommended by the National Institute for Occupational 
219 
Exposure and Health (NIOSH) for an 8- or 10-h time-weighted average exposure and/or a ceiling 
220 
is 20 µg m-3 for formaldehyde and 250 µg m-3 for acrolein.20 For diacetyl, NIOSH recommended 
221 
a level of 5 ppb (1.4 µg m-3) for up to 8-h daily exposures in a 40-h workweek.21 Assuming a 
222 
constant breathing rate of 15 m3 day-1,22 the amounts inhaled during an 8-h work day at the 
223 
NIOSH-determined limits are estimated as 0.1 mg formaldehyde, 1.3 mg acrolein and 7 µg 
224 
diacetyl. These values are either comparable to or lower than daily intake rates from vaping. 
225 
For formaldehyde and diacetyl, the predicted daily intakes from e-cigarettes were higher than 
226 
NIOSH guidelines by more than an order of magnitude under all vaping regimes, for both 
227 
devices and both voltage settings. This suggests that NIOSH limits could be exceeded even with 
228 
a lower, more typical vaping rate (e.g., 100 puff day-1). Predicted acrolein intake was 
229 
comparable to or higher than NIOSH guidelines only for the more extreme vaping conditions 
230 
(i.e., using the EGO device at 4.8 V under the typical or intense vaping regimes).  
231 
 
232 
 10 
 
 
 
Different vaping regimes had major effects on the predicted toxicant intakes. A sensitivity 
233 
analysis for each toxicant is presented in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Average increases 
234 
in the intake rates were between 11 and 63% when switching from the less intense to the 
235 
intermediate “typical” regime. Switching from the intermediate to the more intense vaping 
236 
regime showed average changes in intake rates between 8 and 30 %.   
237 
 
238 
Comparing aldehyde intake from electronic and conventional cigarettes. E-cigarette vapor 
239 
contains fewer compounds than tobacco smoke, and many of the known carcinogens in 
240 
cigarette smoke are absent from the vapor. However, relatively high levels of volatile aldehydes 
241 
are found in e-cigarette vapor. A comparison of aldehyde intake by smokers and vapers was 
242 
carried out to quantify the relative exposures. We assumed a moderate vaping scenario of 100 
243 
puffs per day following the previously described three vaping regimes. Intake from smoking was 
244 
estimated for an average of 10 cigarettes per day using emission rates reported in the literature 
245 
(Table S3, Supporting Information). Mainstream emission rates for conventional cigarettes were 
246 
obtained following the ISO, CORESTA and Health Canada Intense methods. 23-25 The reported 
247 
range of emission rates reflects differences in yields obtained for each method and the 
248 
variability observed among commercial and reference cigarettes. Daily intakes presented in 
249 
Figure 2 were calculated as the product of the retention factors (Table S1) and emission rates 
250 
for each compound present in e-cigarette vapor or in mainstream cigarette smoke, 
251 
respectively. We assumed that the retention factors are the same for vaping and smoking. It 
252 
should be noted that smokers are exposed not only to mainstream smoke during active puffing, 
253 
but they also inhale undiluted sidestream smoke in close proximity to the smoldering tip of the 
254 
cigarette, an additional source of exposure not included in this analysis. Results from Figure 2 
255 
indicate that formaldehyde intakes for all e-cigarettes, voltages and vaping regimes were higher 
256 
than for mainstream tobacco smoke. The intake of acrolein and acetaldehyde using the EGO 
257 
device were comparable to combustion cigarettes for most conditions. Intake of diacetyl from 
258 
e-cigarettes was below values predicted for smoking in all cases.  In summary, the overall intake 
259 
of volatile aldehydes from e-cigarettes was comparable to that from conventional cigarettes. 
260 
 11 
 
 
 
 
261 
Biomarkers of human exposure are available for acrolein and benzene, but not for 
262 
formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. Three studies tracking biomarkers of acrolein found that 
263 
exposure was much lower for e-cigarette users than for smokers, and generally similar to that 
264 
of non-smokers. 26-28 Our predictions for the more frequent, shorter vaping sessions are 
265 
consistent with those findings. However, similar levels of acrolein exposure in smokers and e-
266 
cigarette users were predicted with less frequent, longer puffing sessions. The discrepancies 
267 
between biomarker studies and our model simulations for more extreme vaping regimes are 
268 
likely due to differences in the devices and vaping regimes used in each case.  
269 
 
270 
Impacts on non-users 
271 
 
272 
Figure 3 shows the incremental concentrations (ΔC) of indoor air pollutants attributed to e-
273 
cigarette’s exhaled mainstream vapor. Conditions reported correspond to typical puffing 
274 
sessions of 25 puffs each. Results for more moderate –frequent short sessions– and extreme 
275 
vaping conditions –infrequent long sessions– are presented in Figure S3 and S4 (Supporting 
276 
Information), respectively. Increases in indoor air concentrations were evaluated for the AERO 
277 
vaporizer operating at 3.8 V, and for the EGO vaporizer operating at both 3.8 and 4.8 V. In all 
278 
cases, the e-liquid considered was CT. Values plotted in Figures 3, S3 and S4 correspond to 
279 
average determinations, and the error bars illustrate the range of values considered. 
280 
 
281 
Residential exposures. Figure 3(A) presents results corresponding to a scenario in which both 
282 
the vaper and the non-vaper stay at home most of the time, a worst-case setting for residential 
283 
exposures. Household pollutant levels were impacted by toxicants exhaled by the user, and the 
284 
magnitude of those changes strongly depended on the emission rates for each device/voltage 
285 
combination, the vaping topography and the retention factors for each compound. The error 
286 
bars reflect the variability of retention factors considered in this study. In most cases, higher 
287 
contributions to indoor concentrations were predicted for the EGO vs. the AERO vaporizer.

Similarly, higher levels were predicted for the higher power setting of 4.8 V, compared to 3.8 V. 
289 
In most cases, toxicant concentrations did not exceeded the health-based 8-h reference 
290 
exposure levels (RELs) established by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard 
291 
Assessment (OEHHA). Only the EGO device at the highest voltage produced increments in 
292 
formaldehyde concentration that exceeded the 8-h REL (9 µg m-3) and acrolein levels that were 
293 
comparable to the 1-h REL (2.5 µg m-3). The 40-h workweek occupational exposure limits for 
294 
diacetyl (1.4 µg/m3) was not exceeded under any operation conditions. Acetaldehyde and 
295 
benzene concentrations were far below the corresponding 8-h REL in all cases (300 µg m-3  and 
296 
27 µg m-3, respectively). 
297 
 
298 
Results presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) provide the corresponding sensitivity 
299 
analysis. When a vaping regime with lower emissions was used (frequent short sessions), all ΔC 
300 
values were below the 8-h RELs. However, when a more intense puffing regime was considered, 
301 
the EGO vaporizer at 4.8 V led to predicted contributions to indoor levels that exceeded the 1-h 
302 
REL for acrolein, and the 8-h REL for formaldehyde, but remained below the 8-h RELs for 
303 
acetaldehyde and benzene and the occupational exposure levels for diacetyl. These results 
304 
suggest that residential indoor air quality can be impacted by a single vaper, although under 
305 
most conditions and exposure scenarios the contribution of vaping to indoor pollutant levels is 
306 
expected to be minor. 
307 
 
308 
Exposures in a vaping bar. Figure 3(B) shows the predicted increases in indoor concentrations 
309 
in a bar that allows vaping. Three parameters were used to characterize each bar: the physical 
310 
dimensions of the indoor space (350 – 2500 m3), the air exchange rate (0.6 – 6.5 h-1) and the 
311 
average number of vaping patrons (3.3 – 13 vapers per hour). These parameters were adapted 
312 
from those determined by Waring and Siegel for 17 different smoking bars in Austin TX (Table 
313 
S4, Supporting Information).29  Values reported in Figure 3(B) represent the average for all bars, 
314 
and the error bars the variability due to the diversity of building characteristics and vaping 
315 
prevalence. The indoor air concentration of toxicants varied by up to a factor of 7.6 due to 
316 
 13 
 
 
 
changes in these parameters.  Overall, increments in pollutant concentrations predicted in bars 
317 
were higher than those predicted in the home, and concentrations changes for the EGO device 
318 
were in general higher than for the AERO vaporizer.  The difference observed between the two 
319 
voltage settings in the EGO device was partially offset by a combination of building 
320 
characteristics (e.g., low ventilation rates, reduced space volume) or by the presence of a larger 
321 
number of vapers. Changes in formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein concentrations in bars 
322 
could span up to two orders of magnitude. For vaping conditions corresponding to the EGO 
323 
vaporizer at the higher setting of 4.8 V, formaldehyde levels exceeded the OEHHA REL for 1-h 
324 
exposure (55 µg m-3) in several bars and the 8-h REL (9 µg m-3) in all cases. Acrolein 
325 
concentrations exceeded the acute exposure REL (2.5 µg m-3) in all bars. For both compounds, 
326 
the milder vaping condition (e.g., EGO device at 3.8 V) also exceeded the 8-h exposure RELs in 
327 
several bars. In addition, results for the EGO vaporizer at the higher setting showed some bars 
328 
approaching the 8-h REL for benzene (27 µg m-3) and the 40-h workweek occupational exposure 
329 
limit for diacetyl (1.4 µg/m3). 
330 
 
331 
Results shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information) indicate that for some bars, when a less 
332 
intense vaping regime with lower emissions was used, all tested conditions exceeded the 
333 
formaldehyde 8-h REL. In some bars the more intense vaping regime (EGO at 4.8 V) caused the 
334 
1-h REL to be surpassed. The same extreme regime also exceeded the acrolein 8-h REL in most 
335 
cases. When a more intense puffing regime was modeled, results resembled those presented in 
336 
Figure 3(B): formaldehyde and acrolein exceeded the 8-h REL for at least some bars, considering 
337 
all three vaping regimes, and exceeded the 1-h REL for the more intense regime. The latter 
338 
setting led also to high diacetyl and benzene concentrations that approached reference limits. 
339 
These results indicate that indoor air quality can be affected in bars where vaping is allowed, 
340 
leading to potentially significant occupational exposures for bar personnel, in addition to 
341 
affecting non-vaping patrons.

Integrated health damage 
345 
 
346 
The predicted health damage associated with lifetime exposures was computed assuming 
347 
average intakes for the home and bar scenarios. The results are consistent with the typical large 
348 
uncertainties in modeling population-based health impacts of specific compounds, spanning 
349 
several orders of magnitude. Toxicant-specific contributions to DALYs are shown in Figure 4(A) 
350 
for the residential scenario in which a non-vaper is exposed to secondhand vapor from an EGO 
351 
vaporizer operating the device at 3.8 V, following a typical vaping regime of 10 vaping sessions 
352 
of 25 puffs each. Acrolein was the dominant contributor to the aggregate harm (75%), with 
353 
formaldehyde contributing 21% and much smaller contributions from other compounds 
354 
(glycidol, acetaldehyde and benzene). This is consistent with the fact that acrolein levels were 
355 
close to or exceeded the 1-h OEHHA REL and formaldehyde levels exceeded the 8-h REL.  
356 
 
357 
In Figure 4(B) results are shown for the aggregate damage integrating all toxicants for 
358 
residential and bar exposures, taking account of the three device/voltage combinations 
359 
analyzed in this study. The figure presents DALYs for these six modeled scenarios alongside 
360 
previous results for combined second- and thirdhand tobacco smoke (SHS/THS) in the same 
361 
residential scenario used in this study.17  We compared the impacts of VOCs found in e-
362 
cigarette vapor with those of the VOC fraction of SHS/THS, as well as with the full impact of 
363 
SHS/THS (VOCs + PM2.5). Overall, vaping scenarios led to DALYs that were lower than those 
364 
calculated for the VOC fraction of SHS/THS. When PM2.5 from conventional cigarettes was 
365 
included in the analysis, the impact associated with SHS/THS was even higher, and the gap with 
366 
e-cigarettes larger. PM2.5 was the largest contribution to aggregate heath damage for SHS/THS 
367 
using concentration-response functions derived from outdoor air particles.30 Aerosols emitted 
368 
by e-cigarettes are predominantly composed of liquid droplets that evaporate fairly quickly and 
369 
may contribute differently to long-term PM2.5 exposures. Most of the compounds described in 
370 
this study are initially associated with aerosol particles.31 There is recent evidence of metal 
371 
 15 
 
 
 
nanoparticles present in e-cigarette vapor at high concentrations, but the chemical nature and 
372 
toxicity of these nanoparticles are unknown. 32  
373 
 
374 
In Figures S5 and S6 (Supporting Information) we present the same analysis carried out when 
375 
emission rates are calculated using frequent short vaping sessions and infrequent long vaping 
376 
sessions, respectively. Results presented in Figure S5 show DALYs that were between one and 
377 
two orders of magnitude lower than those calculated for the VOC fraction of SHS/THS due to 
378 
the lower emission rates achieved with that vaping topography. By contrast, Figure S6 shows 
379 
predicted DALYs for the home and bar scenarios that, when vaping was carried out with the 
380 
EGO device at 4.8 V, were comparable to those estimated for the VOCs present in SHS/THS. This 
381 
result is consistent with vaping scenarios showing high acrolein concentrations at similar orders 
382 
of magnitude as the SHS/THS VOCs results, since acrolein was the main contributor to DALYs for 
383 
both exposures. In all cases, our analysis suggests that long-term exposure to e-cigarette vapor 
384 
would cause a lower impact on non-users’ health than exposure to SHS/THS. 
385 
 
386 
These predictions could be considered to be preliminary evaluations for a subset of the 
387 
compounds detected in the vapor, based on the partial information that is currently available. 
388 
DALYs were calculated with the incomplete information available from epidemiological and/or 
389 
toxicological data. Damage factors could not be developed for diacetyl, acetol, nicotine and 
390 
nicotyrine, and the contribution of particles was not considered. Similarly, regulatory limits 
391 
and/or guidance to estimate safe exposure levels for acetol, nicotine and nicotyrine were not 
392 
available in the literature. Despite these limitations, this methodology can serve as a tool to 
393 
predict the magnitude of the harm caused by e-cigarette vapor in indoor environments. 
394 
 
395 
Implications 
396 
 
397 
This study predicted that mainstream emissions contained significantly different levels of 
398 
harmful chemicals depending on the choice of atomizer, the voltage used and vaping patterns. 
399 
 16 
 
 
 
These factors were most directly correlated to changes in intake doses and secondhand 
400 
exposure levels. Switching the e-liquid did not have a major effect on emissions. Regulating e-
401 
liquid formulation may help reduce exposures to toxic compounds used as flavorings (e.g., 
402 
cinamaldehyde, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde)33, but the main toxic burden of e-cigarettes is 
403 
likely associated with thermal decomposition byproducts of the main constituents (propylene 
404 
glycol and glycerin). Some of the same byproducts also originate in decomposition of 
405 
flavorings.34 Those compounds are generally in low concentration or absent in e-liquid 
406 
formulations, and our study shows that the amounts produced can vary by up to two orders of 
407 
magnitude. For that reason, controlling exposure to volatile aldehydes and other toxicants 
408 
formed during vaporization is challenging.  
409 
 
410 
A limited number of vaporizers and e-liquids were investigated, although all of them were 
411 
popular in California at the time of the study (2015). We have also made assumptions about 
412 
puffing regimes throughout the day that may differ from the way many vapers behave. While 
413 
our predictions are not indicative of toxicant exposures for all vapers, the methodological 
414 
approach for estimating exposures could be adapted for testing any particular device and e-
415 
liquid, different puffing behavior and patterns. The methods presented here could be useful for 
416 
regulatory purposes, to assess potential harms caused by electronic nicotine delivery systems.

Figure 2. Comparative estimates of vapers’ and smokers’ daily intake of (A) formaldehyde, (B) acetaldehyde, (C) acrolein and (D) 
diacetyl. Calculations were based on a moderate usage rate of 100 e-cigarette puffs per day vs. 10 combustion cigarettes smoked per 
day. Vaping regimes included short and frequent sessions (10 sessions of 10 puff each, vertical stripes), intermediate conditions (4 
sessions of 25 puffs each, no stripes) and long, infrequent sessions (2 sessions of 50 puffs each, horizontal stripes).

Figure 3. Change in average indoor air VOC concentrations for (A) a residential scenario in which 
the vaper stays at home most of the time, corresponding to an elevated usage rate of 250 puffs 
per day, and (B) a bar that allows vaping. Three different device/voltage combinations using the 
CT e-liquid were used to determine emission rates for typical puffing sessions of 25 puffs each. 
Black and red lines represent California OEHHA Reference Exposure Levels for 8-h and 1-h 
exposures, respectively, for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and benzene. The blue line 
represents the NIOSH recommended 40-h workweek exposure limit for diacetyl.

Figure 4: Estimated DALYs for selected modeled scenarios. The boxes show the median and 95th 
percentile range of predicted health damage. (A) toxicant-specific impact estimated for the 
residential scenario in which the vaper consumes CT e-liquid using the EGO device at 3.8 V; (B) 
aggregated damage for six scenarios of home and bar exposures using three device/voltage 
combinations. In all cases, emission rates correspond to typical vaping sessions of 25 puffs each. 
The figure includes the estimated damage due to second- and thirdhand smoke (SHS/THS) from 
combustion cigarettes as calculated in our previous study. 11 The DALYs are presented for full 
smoke and for the VOCs alone (excluding PM2.5).
