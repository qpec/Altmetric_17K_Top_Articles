The genomes of cancers deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers
of somatic mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal
cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade
with antibodies to programmed death receptor–1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this
study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch
repair–deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses
were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients.
Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not
reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion
of neoantigen-specific Tcell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the
tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens
in mismatch repair–deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade,
regardless of the cancers’ tissue of origin.
T
herapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors
has uncovered a subset of tumors that are
highly responsive to an endogenous adapt-
ive immune response (1). When the inter-
action between the checkpoint ligands and
their cognate receptors on the effector cells is
blocked, a potent and durable antitumor response
can be observed, and on occasion this response
can be accompanied by severe autoimmunity (2–5).
These findings support the notion that many
cancer patients contain in their immune system
the capacity to react selectively to their tumors,
ostensibly through recognition of tumor-specific
antigens.
The molecular determinants that define this
subset of tumors are still unclear; however, sev-
eral markers, including PD-1ligand (PD-L1)expres-
sion,RNAexpressionsignatures,mutationalburden,
and lymphocytic infiltrates, have been evaluated in
specific tumor types (6–10). Although such mark-
ers appear to be helpful in predicting response
in specific tumor types, none of them have been
evaluated prospectively as a pan-tumor biomarker.
Another potential determinant of response is
mutation-associated neoantigens (MANAs) that
are encoded by cancers (11–14). Mismatch repair–
deficient cancers are predicted to have a very
large number of MANAs that might be recog-
nized by the immune system (15–18). This pre-
diction led us to conduct a small phase 2 study,
focused on 11 patients with colorectal cancers,
which demonstrated that PD-1 blockade was an
effective treatment for many patients with these
tumors (19). Since the initiation of that trial, other
studies have shown that the number of muta-
tions in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal
cancers correlates with the response to PD-1
blockade, providing further support for a rela-
tionship between mutation burden and treatment
response (20).
The genomes of mismatch repair–deficient tu-
mors all harbor hundreds to thousands of somatic
mutations, regardless of their cell of origin. We
therefore sought to investigate the effects of
PD-1 blockade (by the anti–PD-1 antibody pembro-
lizumab) in mismatch repair–deficient tumors
independent of the tissue of origin. In the cur-
rent study, we prospectively evaluated the effi-
cacy of PD-1 blockade in a range of different
subtypes of mismatch repair–deficient cancers
(ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01876511).
Eighty-six consecutive patients were enrolled
between September 2013 and September 2016
(table S1). The data cutoff was 19 December 2016.
All patients received at least one prior therapy
and had evidence of progressive disease prior to
enrollment. Twelve different cancer types were
enrolled in the study (Fig. 1). All enrolled patients
had evidence of mismatch repair deficiency as
assessed by either polymerase chain reaction or
immunohistochemistry. For most cases, germ-
line sequencing of MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and
MLH1 was performed to determine whether the
mismatch repair deficiencies were associated
with a germline change in one of these genes
(i.e., whether the patients had Lynch syndrome)
(table S2). Germline sequence changes diagnostic
of Lynch syndrome were noted in 32 cases (48%),
with MSH2 being the most commonly mutated
gene. In seven additional cases where germline
testing was not performed, the patient reported
a family history consistent with a diagnosis of
Lynch syndrome.
Adverse events during treatment were manage-
able and resembled those found in other clinical
studies using pembrolizumab (table S3). Although
74% of patients experienced an adverse effect,
most were low-grade. Endocrine disorders, most-
ly hypothyroidism, occurred in 21% of patients
and were easily managed with thyroid hormone
replacement.
Seventy-eight patients had disease that could
be evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Table 1). Objective
radiographic responses were noted in 46 of the
86 patients [53%; 95% confidence interval (CI),
42 to 64%], with 21% (n = 18) achieving a com-
plete radiographic response. Disease control (mea-
sured as partial response + complete response +
stable disease) was achieved in 66 of the 86 patients
(77%; 95% CI, 66 to 85%). Radiographic responses
could be separated into two classes. First, in
12 cases, scans at 20 weeks showed stable dis-
ease, which eventually converted to an objective
response (measured as tumor size reduction in
response to therapy, according to RECIST crite-
ria). Second, in 11 additional cases, we observed

 an initial partial response or stable disease at the
20-week scan that later converted to a complete
response while treatment was continued. The aver-
age time to any response was 21 weeks; the average
time to complete response was 42 weeks (Fig. 1).
Of note, the objective response rate was similar
between colorectal cancer and other cancer sub-
types. Specifically, we observed objective responses
in 52% (95% CI, 36 to 68%) of patients with colorec-
tal cancers and in 54% (95% CI, 39 to 69%) of the
patients with cancers originating in other or-
gans (tables S4 and S5). There was also no sig-
nificant difference in the objective response rate
between Lynch syndrome–associated and non–
Lynch syndrome–associated tumors [46% (95%
CI, 30 to 63%) versus 59% (95% CI, 41 to 76%),
respectively; P = 0.27].
Neither median progression-free survival (PFS)
nor median overall survival (OS) has yet been
reached (median follow-up time of 12.5 months;
Fig. 1), and the study is ongoing. However, the
estimates of PFS at 1 and 2 years were 64% and
53%, respectively. The estimates of OS at 1 and
2 years were 76% and 64%, respectively, which
is markedly higher than expected considering
the advanced state of disease in this cohort (21).
The PFS and OS were not significantly different
in patients with colorectal cancers relative to
those with other cancer types (fig. S1). Neither
PFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2 (95% CI, 0.582 to
2.512); P = 0.61] or OS [HR = 1.71 (95% CI, 0.697
to 4.196); P = 0.24] were influenced by tumors
associated with Lynch syndrome.
Eleven patients achieved a complete response
and were taken off therapy after 2 years of treat-
ment. No evidence of cancer recurrence has
been observed in those patients with an average
time off therapy of 8.3 months. Seven other
patients had residual disease by imaging, but
pembrolizumab was discontinued after reach-
ing the 2-year milestone or because of intoler-
ance to therapy. To date, the average time off

 therapy for this group was 7.6 months. As of the
data cutoff, none of these patients has shown
evidence of progression since discontinuation
of pembrolizumab.
Twenty patients with measurable radiographic
disease underwent percutaneous biopsies between
1 month and 5 months after the initiation of ther-
apy. Twelve of these biopsies demonstrated no
evidence of tumor cells and were shown to have
varying degrees of inflammation, fibrosis, and
mucin, consistent with an ongoing immune re-
sponse (fig. S2). The other eight cases showed
residual tumor cells. The absence of cancer cells
in posttreatment biopsies was a strong pre-
dictor of PFS [HR for PFS = 0.189 (95% CI,
0.046 to 0.767); P = 0.012], with median PFS of
25.9 months versus 2.9 months for biopsies with
evidence of residual tumor. Although there was
no significant difference in OS between patients
whose biopsies were positive or negative for tumor
cells, median OS has not yet been reached in pa-
tients with negative biopsies (table S6).
Primary clinical resistance to initial therapy
with pembrolizumab, as measured by progres-
sive radiographic disease on the first study scan,
was noted in 12 patients (14%) (Table 1). After
determining the exomic sequences of tumor and
matched normal DNA from three of these patients,
we compared them to the exomes of 15 primary
tumors from patients who had achieved objec-
tive responses to the therapy (table S7). The three
therapy-insensitive tumors harbored an average
of 1413 nonsynonymous mutations, not signifi-
cantly different from the number in patients with
objective responses (1644 nonsynonymous muta-
tions; P = 0.67, Student t test). The gene (B2M)
encoding b2-microglobulin, a protein required for
antigen presentation (22), was not mutated in any
of the primary tumors from the resistant group
(table S8).
Only five cases of acquired resistance were
noted, where patients developed progressive dis-
ease after an initial objective response to pem-
brolizumab. Three of these cases were atypical
in that the tumors emerged in occult sites such
as the brain (two cases) or bone (one case). All
three cases were treated with local therapy (ra-
diation or surgery), and the patients survived
and continued treatment with pembrolizumab.
However, in accordance with study design, these
three patients are listed in Fig. 1 as having pro-
gressive disease.
We performed exome sequencing of biopsies
of brain metastases from two patients and com-
pared the results with those of their primary
tumors (fig. S3 and table S7). In the first case, the
primary duodenal tumor and brain metastasis
shared 397 nonsynonymous somatic mutations,
providing unequivocal evidence that the metasta-
sis was derived from the primary duodenal tumor
rather than from an independent tumor. More-
over, the metastasis harbored 1010 nonsynonymous
new mutations not present in the primary tumor,
while the primary tumor harbored 964 mutations
not present in the metastasis (table S9). In the
second case, the primary colorectal tumor and
brain metastasis shared 848 nonsynonymous
somatic mutations, similarly providing unequivocal
evidence of a genetic relationship between the
two lesions. The brain metastasis harbored 221
nonsynonymous mutations not present in the pri-
mary colorectal tumor, while the primary tumor
harbored 100 mutations not present in the metas-
tasis (table S10). Of note, the brain metastases
from both of these patients contained mutations
in the B2M gene. In the patient with the colorec-
tal tumor, a truncating mutation (L15Ffs*41) in
the B2M gene was identified in the metastasis
but not in the primary tumor. The primary duode-
nal tumor harbored a truncating mutation in
b2-microglobulin (V69Wfs*34), whereas the metas-
tasis retained this mutation and acquired a second
B2M mutation (12L>P; table S7).
We also evaluated the exomes of three primary
tumors from patients who originally had stable
disease by RECIST criteria at 20 weeks, but whose
disease progressed within 8 months of initiat-
ing therapy. The average mutational burden was
1647 for this group, similar to those of the other
patients described above. Interestingly, two of
these three tumors harbored mutations of B2M
(table S7).
We next sought to directly test the hypothesis
that checkpoint blockade induces peripheral ex-
pansion of tumor-specific T cells and that mis-
match repair–deficient tumors harbor functional
MANA-specific T cells. Deep sequencing of T cell
receptor CDR3 regions (TCR-seq) has emerged
as a valuable technique to evaluate T cell clonal
representation in both tumors and peripheral
blood. We performed TCR-seq on tumors from
three responding patients (obtained from archival
surgical resections) and identified intratumoral
clones that were selectively expanded in the pe-
riphery (Fig. 2A). These clones were present at
very low frequency (often undetectable) in the pe-
ripheral blood before pembrolizumab treatment,
but many rapidly increased after treatment ini-
tiation, followed by a contraction that generally
occurred before radiologic responses were ob-
served. To characterize functional T cell clones
specific for mutant peptides, we obtained periph-
eral blood from one of the patients (subject 19).
We tested the patient’s posttreatment peripheral
blood for reactivity against the 15 top candidate
MANAs as identified via a neoantigen prediction
algorithm [specified by the patient’s human leuko-
cyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles; see supplemen-
tary materials] with an interferon-g (IFN-g) ELISpot
assay. Counts of spot-forming cells or cytokine
activity analyses revealed T cell responses against
7 of 15 peptides (Fig. 2, B and C). We next inter-
rogated the expanded lymphocyte populations
against these seven peptides with TCR-seq. Clonal
T cell expansion was noted in response to three
of the seven peptides (Fig. 2D), with specificity
demonstrated by a lack of expansion in response
to any other peptide tested (fig. S4). In the pe-
ripheral blood, T cell expansion to these three
mutant peptides resulted in 142 unique TCR
sequences, seven of which were found in the
tumor sample (two from MANA1, three from
MANA2, and two from MANA4) (Fig. 2D). Of note,
the mutant peptides that scored positive all re-
sulted from frameshift mutations—the type of
mutation that is most characteristic of mismatch
repair–deficient cancers.
All seven of the MANA-reactive TCRs were de-
tectable in peripheral blood at very low frequen-
cy (less than 0.02%) before treatment. However,
four of the clones rapidly increased in frequency
in the peripheral blood after anti–PD-1 treatment
(Fig. 2E). Similar to results from the three patients

Fig. 2. TCR clonal dynamics and mutation-associated neoantigen
recognition in patients responding to PD-1 blockade. (A) TCR
sequencing was performed on serial peripheral T cell samples obtained
before and after PD-1 blockade. Tumor tissue with mismatch repair
deficiency was obtained from three responding patients. Shown for each
patient are 15 TCR clones with the highest relative change in frequency
after treatment (left) that were also found in the original tumor (right
panels). (B) Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumor and
matched normal tissue from patient 19. Somatic alterations were analyzed
using a neoantigen prediction pipeline to identify putative MANAs.
Reactivity to 15 candidate MANAs was tested in a 10-day cultured IFN-g
ELISpot assay. Data are shown as the mean number of spot-forming cells
(SFC) per 106 T cells (left) or mean cytokine activity (right) of triplicate
wells ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (C) Seven candidate
MANAs were selected for TCR analysis on the basis of ELISpot reactivity.
(D) MANA-specific T cell responses were identified against three of seven
candidate MANAs (MANA1, MANA2, and MANA4) after 10 days of in vitro
stimulation (left panels). MANA-specific clones were identified by significant
expansion in response to the relevant peptide and no significant expansion in
response to any other peptide tested (fig. S3). Data are shown as the relative
change in TCR clone frequency compared to the frequency of that clone after
identical culture without peptide. These T cell clones were also found in the
original tumor biopsy (right panels). (E) Frequency of MANA-specific clones,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and radiographic response in the tumor
[from (D)] were tracked in the peripheral blood before treatment and at various
times after pembrolizumab treatment. Time is shown in weeks after the first
pembrolizumab dose. (F) In vitro binding and stability assays demonstrate the
affinity kinetics of each relevant MANA and the corresponding wild-type peptide
(when applicable) for their restricting HLA class I allele. The A*02:01-restricted
influenza M GILGFVTL epitope was used as a negative control for each assay;
known HLA-matched epitopes were used as positive controls when available.
Data are shown as counts per second with increasing peptide concentration for
binding assays (top) or counts per minute over time for stability assays (bottom).

Downloaded from 
 analyzed above, the frequencies of these function-
ally validated MANA-specific T cell clones peaked
soon after treatment and corresponded with nor-
malization of the systemic tumor marker, predat-
ing objective radiographic response by several
weeks. This peak in T cell clonal expansion was
followed by decreases in frequency, reminiscent
of T cell responses to acute viral infections (Fig.
2E). Because all the MANAs were from frame-
shift mutations, only MANA2 had a similar wild-
type counterpart (differing in the two C-terminal
amino acids). The corresponding wild-type pep-
tide bound to HLA with less than 1% of the af-
finity of the mutant peptide counterpart (Fig. 2F),
consistent with the mutation conferring enhanced
HLA binding.
To estimate the proportion of cancer patients
for whom the results of this study might be ap-
plicable, we evaluated 12,019 cancers represent-
ing 32 distinct tumor types for mismatch repair
deficiency using a next-generation sequencing–
based approach (Fig. 3). In accordance with a
recent independent estimate using a different
approach (23), we found that >2% of adenocar-
cinomas of the endometrium, stomach, small in-
testine, colon and rectum, cervix, prostate, bile
duct, and liver, as well as neuroendocrine tu-
mors, uterine sarcomas, and thyroid carcinomas,
were mismatch repair–deficient. Across these
11 tumor types, 10% of stage I to stage III cancers
and 5% of stage IV cancers were mismatch repair–
deficient. This represents roughly 40,000 annual
stage I to III diagnoses and 20,000 stage IV diagno-
ses in the United States alone. Because genetic
and immunohistochemical tests for mismatch
repair deficiency are already widely available,
these results tie immunity, cancer genetics, and
therapeutics together in a manner that will likely
establish a new standard of care. In the future,
testing for mismatch repair deficiency in patients
who are refractory to other treatments might be
considered in order to identify those who may
benefit from PD-1 pathway blockade, regard-
less of tumor type.
