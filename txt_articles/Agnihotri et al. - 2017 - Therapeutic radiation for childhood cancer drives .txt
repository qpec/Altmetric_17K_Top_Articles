Cranial radiotherapy improves survival of the most common childhood cancers, including
brain tumors and leukemia. Unfortunately, long-term survivors are faced with consequences
of secondary neoplasia, including radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs). We characterized
31 RIMs with exome/NF2 intronic sequencing, RNA sequencing and methylation profiling,
and found NF2 gene rearrangements in 12/31 of RIMs, an observation previously unreported
in sporadic meningioma (SM). Additionally, known recurrent mutations characteristic of SM,
including AKT1, KLF4, TRAF7 and SMO, were not observed in RIMs. Combined losses of
chromosomes 1p and 22q were common in RIMs (16/18 cases) and overall, chromosomal
aberrations were more complex than that observed in SM. Patterns of DNA methylation
profiling supported similar cell of origin between RIMs and SMs. The findings indicate that
the mutational landscape of RIMs is distinct from SMs, and have significant therapeutic
implications for survivors of childhood cranial radiation and the elucidation of the molecular
pathogenesis of meningiomas.

adiotherapy improves survival of the most common
childhood cancers, including brain tumors and leukemia.
Unfortunately, long-term survivors are faced with con-
sequences of secondary neoplasia, including radiation-induced
meningiomas (RIMs). RIMs are the most common brain neo-
plasm caused by ionizing radiation (al-Mefty et al1. 1990;
Lee et al.2 2004). These tumors occur 10–30 years following
radiotherapy for primary childhood cancer3–5, and demonstrate
distinct and more aggressive clinical features than sporadic
meningiomas6–14. Furthermore, RIMs display more aggressive
clinicaland
biologic
behavior
than
sporadic
meningiomas,
including higher recurrence rates, greater cellularity, more pleo-
morphic nuclei and frequent mitoses, and are more often atypical
and multifocal6–14. NF2 mutations have been reported to be
absent or significantly lower in RIMs (25%) compared to sporadic
meningiomas15, supporting that fact that the genomic landscape
of RIMs is possibly unique from sporadic meningiomas. While
the genome of sporadic meningiomas has been well characterized
with genetic alterations defining distinct molecular subgroups, the
genomic landscape of RIM remains poorly characterized16. To
date, the most common alterations in sporadic meningiomas are
NF2 mutations or loss of 22q, with non-NF2 mutant meningio-
mas harboring mutations in in AKT1, TRAF7, KLF4, POLR2A
and SMO16–18. Therefore, we performed an integrative and
multiplatform approach to investigate the somatic genetic land-
scape of RIM and its distinctness to sporadic meningioma.
Results
Mutational profile of RIMs is distinct from sporadic meningiomas.
We analyzed 31 RIMs, including a discovery cohort of 18 tumors
from 16 patients who had received childhood radiation therapy
for cancer, the majority (74%) being survivors of leukemia or
medulloblastoma (Supplementary Data 1). We also assessed
30 sporadic (non-radiation-associated) meningiomas as a control
cohort. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) at a median depth of
112× (range 110–120) showed no significant germline aberrations
in genes associated with a cancer predisposition or DNA repair,
including TP53, NF2 and PTEN, among others. We identified 265
non-synonymous somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
within the cohort of 18 tumor samples, with an average of 14.7
SNVs per tumor (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 2). The overall
mutation rate of non-synonymous mutations in our cohort was
0.47 per Mb. Most notable was a marked absence of focal gene
mutations typically found in spontaneous meningiomas (Fig. 1b),
such as SMO, TRAF7, KLF4, PIK3CA and AKT1. Consistent with
prior reports15 the rate of NF2 focal mutation was low (1/18
cases). A truncating mutation in PTEN was also noteworthy
(Supplementary Data 2), a rare event in sporadic meningioma,
but previously observed in an RIM19.
Copy number alterations in RIMs. As a possible alternative
mechanism to somatic SNVs and small insertion/deletions, we
analyzed the exome data for copy number alterations (CNAs). All
18 RIMs exhibited frequent megabase-level CNAs with an aver-
age of 22% of the genome affected by CNAs (Fig. 1c), which is
>5-fold (p < 0.01, Student’s t-test) above that observed in the
sporadic meningioma genome17. When controlling for grade by
removing 5 RIMs that were grade II, the remaining 13 grade I
RIM patient samples still displayed significantly high rate than
the sporadic meningioma genome (4.2×, p < 0.01, Student’s t-
test). The most common CNAs were loss of chromosomes 1p (17/
18 RIMs) and 22q (17/18 RIMs) (Fig. 1d–g, Supplementary
Data 3). Previous reports of single cases or small series have
implicated 1p in RIMs20–23, and a cytogenetic analysis of six cases
has implicated 1p13 as a region involved in these tumors21.
Overall, 16/18 cases showed dual loss of chromosomes 1p and
22q, suggesting that co-occurrence of 1p and 22q loss radiation-
induced meningioma is a near-universal feature (89%, p < 0.05,
Fisher’s exact test) of radiation-induced meningioma. Two
patients that possessed multiple RIMs in distinct locations,
exhibited divergent mutational profiles and CNA patterns
between the paired samples, suggesting that multiple RIMs are
not seeded by a common tumor cell ancestor, but rather represent
distinct, synchronous neoplasms (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Notable from RNA sequencing data were NF2 gene fusion
events, identified in 6 of the 17 RIMs that passed RNA-Seq
quality control, as supported by ≥8 spanning RNA-sequenced
mate pairs (Supplementary Data 4). In one case, an inter-
chromosomal gene fusion generated an in-frame NF2 (chr22)
with the DEAD-box helicase DDX49 (chr19) transcript (Fig. 2a).
The first three NF2 exons were expressed in the NF2-DDX49
fusion; however, no sequence reads support the reciprocal
DDX49-NF2 transcript, suggesting that this fusion gene is not
expressed at an appreciable level. In all six cases of NF2 fusion a
complete NF2 exon is spliced to a complete exon of a reciprocal
gene, indicating that the breakpoints of genomic rearrangement
are intronic. The predicted genomic breakpoints of the six NF2
genomic rearrangements varied between first intron to the
thirteenth intron (Fig. 2c). All six RIMs from the discovery set
found to harbor an NF2 rearrangement also possessed monosomy
of chromosome 22q (Fig. 2d), which in combination with NF2
genomic rearrangement is predicted to result in homozygous
disruption of NF2. Furthermore, when we examined the magnetic
resonance imaging scans of patients it was clear that RIMs
possessing an NF2 gene fusion exhibited ill-defined borders (p <
0.01, Fisher’s exact test) and a correlation towards an anatomic
frontal location in the brain (67%, Supplementary Fig. 2).
NF2 rearrangements in RIMs. NF2 RNA sequencing reads
confirmed the NF2 G>A point mutation as detected by WES
within intron 11 splice donor site for one case (RIM1) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3A). We examined the coverage of RNA sequencing
reads mapping to the NF2 locus to determine whether there was a
transcriptional consequence of the splice donor site mutation.
High levels of NF2 sequence reads mapping to the 1320 bp intron
11 revealed that it was incorporated into the NF2 RNA transcript,
indicating the loss of function of intron 11 splice donor site. The
inclusion of intron 11 introduces a premature stop codon that
disrupts NF2 function through generation of a truncated protein
(Supplementary Figs 3B, C).
To discover additional NF2 intronic rearrangements in an
expanded cohort of meningiomas we designed a targeted
sequencing panel to capture both exons and introns of NF2
(Supplementary Data 5) within 31 RIMs and 30 sporadic
meningiomas. Supporting our WES data (Fig. 1 core radiation-
induced meningioma cohort), we found the mutation rate of NF2
was 3.5 times lower in RIMs, with only two mutations (focal NF2
mutations) identified in RIMs, but confirmed their common
occurrence (7/30, 23%) in sporadic meningiomas (Fig. 3a,
Supplementary Data 6). The constitutively activating AKT1
E17K mutation was observed in 13% of sporadic meningiomas
(4/30), but was absent in our cohost of radiation-induced tumors.
Other mutations associated with meningiomas (ARID1A, SMO
and TRAF7) were also restricted to sporadic meningiomas,
suggesting that radiation therapy induces tumorigenesis through
a different set of genetic alterations to those of sporadic
meningioma. Overall, we observed intronic rearrangements of
NF2 in 12/31 RIMs, in contrast to 0/30 in sporadic tumors
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 6–8, p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test).

acterize these tumors, we interrogated the methylome of our
cohort and compared these to a set of sporadic tumors. Hier-
archical clustering demonstrated similarity in DNA methylation
profiles between radiation-induced vs. sporadic tumors, suggest-
ing a common cell of origin (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Overall,
clustering demonstrated two robust methylation subtypes of
radiation-induced tumors, with methylation subgroup one enri-
ched for NF2-disrupted tumors (NF2 fusion and focal mutations)

600 differentially methylated probes (Wilcoxon rank sum test,
30% methylation change, p < 0.05 with adjusted Bonferroni cor-
rection) whose associated genomic loci are enriched for epigenetic
biological pathways (DNA methylation and histone modification)
(Supplementary Figs 6A, B). When methylation sub-groups 1 and
2 were examined at the transcriptome level we identified 249
differential expressed transcripts between the two-methylation
subgroups (DESeq, p < 0.05, adjusted Bonferroni Correction,
Supplemental Fig. 6C) with enrichment in biological pathways
similar to our methylation analysis including epigenetic altera-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 6D).
Discussion
In a previous study comprised predominately of sporadic
meningiomas, an NF2 rearrangement was previously observed in
a single case, interestingly from a patient with a prior history of
cranial radiation17. Consistent with our findings, it occurred in a
male patient, with an NF2 rearrangement in intron 1, the largest
NF2 intron that harbored 5/12 of the NF2 structural rearrange-
ments in our cohort. This example further confirms the asso-
ciation of NF2 intronic rearrangements to patients who received
prior radiation therapy.
Our study demonstrates that RIMs possess a mutational sig-
nature that is distinct from sporadic meningioma, displaying NF2
inactivation through structural rearrangements. NF2 intronic
rearrangements are promiscuous, exhibiting fusion with intra-
and inter-chromosomal regions. Interestingly, only one fusion
was in frame, NF2-DDX49, and although not recurrent we
hypothesize this fusion may harbor some oncogenic properties as
seen with other in frame fusions in other central nervous system
and peripheral nervous system cancers24–27. Loss of 1p and 22q
was highly frequent, and notable is an absence of mutations in
additional genes common to sporadic meningioma. We hypo-

 rearrangements through error prone repair of double strand DNA
breaks. This is supported by our finding that CNAs are elevated
in radiation-induced tumors, in comparison to sporadic menin-
gioma. Radiation may generate genomic changes involving NF2
disruption and other changes that predispose to meningioma
development over several decades. In a recent study, mutational
signatures of ionizing radiation in second malignancies demon-
strated that ionizing radiation generates distinctive mutational
signatures that explain its carcinogenic potential28, 29. Our cohort
was lacking whole-genome profiling of these tumors, which is the
best way to detect these mutational signatures. Although highly
likely our RIM cohort would display a radiation mutational sig-
nature, we were unable to detect it as WES only covers
approximately 1% of the genome and we had a very low mutation
rate in the coding exons. Intriguingly, 10 of the 12 NF2-
rearranged RIMs were in males (p < 0.05). Although sporadic
meningiomas are more common in women while the female-male
ratio of RIMs is balanced. Therefore it has been suggested that
men have excess relative risk of developing meningioma after
radiation30.
Since druggable targets found in sporadic meningioma, such as
AKT1 and SMO, were not observed within our cohort of 31 RIMs,
our findings are relevant in light of current and future targeted
clinical trials for meningioma, and indicate that effective therapies
for meningioma in childhood cancer survivors may be distinct
from precision medicine approaches employed for sporadic
meningioma. Future studies are necessary to correlate the dose,
latency and dosimetry of radiation with frequency of NF2 rear-
rangements and increased CNA load. We note that one of our
NF2-rearrranged cases was in association with prior low-dose
radiation for a certain condition (tinea capitis), but larger studies
and comparisons will be required to fully elucidate this. Overall,
applying these results towards a therapeutic strategy that allows
early intervention in childhood survivors of cancer will be the
most effective means to understand and assess the risk of
meningioma following radiation in these patients.

 Methods
Sample selection and preparation. This study was reviewed and approved by the
University Health Network research ethics board. Specimens were obtained from
patients, with written informed consent. A primary cohort of 18 radiation-induced
meningioma tumors was selected from a clinically annotated database of over 1200
meningioma cases. Criteria for a meningioma to be classified as radiation-induced
included evidence that patient received cranial irradiation at least 2 years before
initial meningioma diagnosis. Tumor samples were only considered for this study if
a detailed clinical history was available. Meningioma samples were classified and
graded according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The clinical and
histopathological data pertaining to all analyzed meningiomas is outlined in
Supplementary Data 1.
Representative fresh-frozen tissue with an estimated purity of ≥90% was
selected from each case for molecular profiling. Genomic DNA and total RNA were
extracted from 4 mm3 tissue samples with standard molecular techniques using
qSYNC DNA extraction kit (Geneaid) and RNeast kit (Qiagen) respectively.
Whole-exome sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing of 18 RIMs and matched
blood samples was performed by EA Quintiles Genomic services, Durham, NC.
Qualimap and Picard confirmed that sequencing results were of high quality and
clean of contaminants. Based on read quality, duplication rate and target coverage,
normal and tumor samples are indistinguishable. Tumor/Normal exome-seq
BAMs were processed by Mutect v1.1.41 to identify somatic point mutations. In
order to identify copy number alterations, aligned exome-seq BAM files for tumor/
normal pairs were processed by samtools mpileup v0.1.18 2 the output of which
was input into Varscan2 somatic v2.3.6 3 which generates depth-ratio. Somatic/
germ-line single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls were processed using the R
package Sequenza v2.1.0 4 in order to generate segmented copy-number profiles
and depth ration plots for each tumor sample. Segmented copy number data were
then input into GISTIC v2.0.22 5 in order to identify genomic regions which
exhibited significant copy number alterations across the cohort.
Methylation profiling. Genomic tumor DNA (0.5 μg) was bisulphite converted
(Qiagen, EpiTect plus) and hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip (Illumina). Array data can be accessed at the Gene Expression Omnibus
repository (GSE83933). Arrays were normalized using the open source statistical
programming language R. Raw IDAT data files were processed using the minfi
Bioconductor package and SWAN normalized. Methylation values were then
exported as β-values (CpG methylation levels). Methylation probes that overlapped
single nucleotide polymorphisms or mapped to the sex chromosomes (X and Y)
were removed before further analysis. Consensus clustering, non-negative matrix
factorization and principal component analysis for subgroup identification was
performed in GenePattern and MultiExperimentViewer. SigClust (version 1.1.0)
was used to compute the significance of the identified clusters.
Targeted sequencing. The targeted sequencing cohort of meningiomas comprised
of 31 RIMs (including the 18 primary cohort) and 30 spontaneous meningioma.
Clinical and histopathological data pertaining to this cohort of 61 meningioma can
be found in Supplementary Data 8. Targeted sequencing procedure was performed
as described in Agnohtri et al.31. A custom meningioma xGen Lockdown Panel of
DNA-biotinylated capture probes was generated from Integrated DNA Technol-
ogies (IDT, Coralville, Iowa) to enrich for all exons of the following genes: NF2,
AKT1, ATM, CHD5, DGKI, EWSR1, GRIA4, INSRR, KLF4, PAPPA2, RAD54L,
SMO, TRAF7 and UNC5B). In addition, to enable the identification of NF2
intronic rearrangements we designed capture probes to span the introns of NF2
(Supplemental Data 6). Targeted sequencing was performed at the Princess
Margaret Genomics Centre (PMGC, www.pmgenomics.ca), Toronto Canada on an
Illumina HiSeq2500.
RNA sequencing. RNA sequencing of 18 RIMs was performed by EA Quintiles
Genomic services, Durham, NC. Libraries were generated from total RNA and
constructed using the manufacturer’s protocols. Sequencing was done on the
Illumina HiSeq platform. One RIM sample failed to pass the sequencing quality
control, with the remaining 17 RIMs passing. RNA-Seq fastq files were processed
using tophat2 v2.0.8b 6 in fusion-search mode in order to identify putative gene
fusions.
Data availability. All data has been deposited in publically accessible databases.
Methylation data are accessible through the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession
GSE83933). Exome and RNA Sequencing data is accessible through the European
Genome-phenome Archive (EGAS00001002317 and EGAS00001002318,
respectively).
