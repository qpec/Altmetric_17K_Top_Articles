Background: Meniscus tears are classified as traumatic or degenerative based on the tear pattern. There is little evidence dem-
onstrating biological differences between the 2 tear types.
Hypothesis: Gene expression signatures in the injured meniscus are different between traumatic (vertical) and degenerative
(complex, horizontal, or flap) tears.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: Samples of the torn meniscus from the white-white zone were removed at the time of clinically indicated partial menis-
cectomy from 48 patients (37 with degenerative tears and 11 with traumatic tears). mRNA expression in the injured menisci was
measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for selected molecular markers of osteoarthritis, inflammation, and
cartilage homeostasis (eg, cytokines/chemokines, aggrecanases/metalloproteinases, transcription factors, cartilage matrix genes,
and adipokines). The tear pattern (traumatic or degenerative) and location (medial or lateral) were recorded for each patient.
Gene expression differences between degenerative and traumatic tears were computed after adjusting for patients’ age, sex,
and body mass index and for location of the resected meniscus (medial/lateral).
Results: Gene expression in meniscus tears varied by pattern. Chemokines (IL8 [P \ .001] and CXCL6 [P \ .001]) and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP1 [P = .011] and MMP3 [P = .016]) were expressed at a significantly higher level in traumatic tears com-
pared with degenerative tears. In contrast, COL1A1 was expressed at a lower level in traumatic tears compared with degenerative
tears (P = .058). None of the genes tested demonstrated significant differences between medial and lateral meniscus tears.
Conclusion: Traumatic meniscus tears overall exhibited a higher inflammatory/catabolic response as evidenced by higher levels
of chemokine and matrix metalloproteinase expression than degenerative tears. These findings suggest that there is a (molecular)
biological distinction between traumatic and degenerative tears.
Clinical Relevance: The catabolic/inflammatory differences between traumatic and degenerative tears may be relevant to treat-
ment decisions regarding the meniscus as well as advance our understanding of how meniscus tears relate to the development of
knee osteoarthritis.

Meniscus tears are a common injury in the knee. They are
classified based on their pattern into either traumatic
tears, defined as longitudinal tears, or degenerative tears,
including complex, horizontal, and flap tears.8 This classi-
fication is considered important with regard to clinical
decision making about the surgical treatment of meniscus
tears. While most meniscus tears are treated with partial
meniscectomy, with an estimated 690,000 partial menis-
cectomies performed in the United States alone each
year,7 some tears are treated with repair. Healing rates
after meniscus repair are no better than 80% to 85%16
and may be as low as 55%.29 While it is generally accepted
that degenerative tears are not good candidates for repair
in comparison with traumatic tears, there is a need for
patient-related factors that might help identify tears at
a higher risk for repair failure.14 The molecular profile of
injured tissues from patients undergoing meniscus surgery
could help identify such factors.
It has been estimated that 50% of patients with menis-
cus tears go on to develop knee osteoarthritis (OA) within
10 to 20 years.9,10,13,21 The tear pattern may also be rele-
vant to this risk as Englund et al11 reported that degener-
ative tears are associated with worse outcomes and more
OA after meniscectomy. However, very little is known
about any biological differences between traumatic and
degenerative tears. If there is a distinction in the mecha-
nism and pathophysiology of traumatic and degenerative

 tears, there may be differences in their biology. Studying
the gene expression profile of tissues resected from these
patients at the time of partial meniscectomy is an ideal
approach to compare the biology of these tear patterns.
Therefore, the current study was developed to assess
whether the tear pattern of the injured meniscus relates
to gene expression in the injured tissue. The hypothesis
of this study was that the expression profile of inflamma-
tory and OA-related genes differs between traumatic and
degenerative meniscus tears. If such differences exist,
they could be relevant to the relative risk for developing
OA as well as the potential for a meniscus tear to heal after
attempted repair.
METHODS
Meniscus Surgery and Grading of Chondrosis
The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board of human participants at the Washington
University School of Medicine. Patients with diagnosed
symptomatic, isolated medial or lateral meniscus tears
without a concomitant cartilage or ligament injury treated
by a single academic sports medicine surgeon were eligible
to be recruited for this study. All patients underwent pre-
operative radiography and magnetic resonance imaging
with no evidence for OA. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants before knee arthroscopic surgery.
Patients were included in this study if they had isolated
meniscus tears appropriately treated with partial menis-
cectomy and no other injury in the knee. If there was
any grade 2 or greater chondrosis in the knee based on
standard diagnostic arthroscopic surgery of all compart-
ments, patients were excluded from the study. There is
some overlap of these patients with the cohort in a previ-
ously published study looking at the relationship of gene
expression in the meniscus to patient’s body mass index
(BMI), which did not evaluate the association of tear pat-
tern with gene expression.19
The tear pattern was determined and recorded at the
time of arthroscopic surgery. Each tear was classified as
degenerative (complex, horizontal, or flap tear pattern)
(Figure 1A) or traumatic (longitudinal tear pattern) (Fig-
ure 1B).8 Patients with a meniscus injury involving a radial
tear or other patterns that did not specifically meet the def-
initions above were not included in this study. In all cases,
the specimen was collected from the white-white zone of
the meniscus as part of clinically indicated resection of
the tear by the treating surgeon. For traumatic tears,
time from the initial injury to surgery was calculated based
on the clinical record.
Tissue Processing and RNA Isolation
The specimens were collected at the time of surgery. They
were handled using a previously published technique.3
Briefly, the anonymous specimens were transported to
the laboratory on ice from the operating room in sterile
screw-cap containers containing phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) without calcium and magnesium (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The tissues were weighed and washed twice
with PBS to get rid of any blood and debris and to avoid
contamination with any other cell types. The blot-dried tis-
sues were put in 50-mL Falcon tubes, and 1 mL of TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) was added for each 50 to 100 mg of
Figure 1. Representative images from (A) degenerative and
(B) traumatic meniscus tears are shown. Images were taken
at the time of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.

Quantification of Gene Expression in the Meniscus
A total of 150 to 200 ng of isolated RNA was first treated
with DNase I to remove traces of contaminating DNA
(Invitrogen).
The
DNase
I–treated
RNA
was
then
reverse-transcribed to synthesize complementary DNA
(Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Custom-
designed primers (Table 1) for molecular markers of OA
including proinflammatory cytokines (IL1a, IL1b, IL6,
TNFa), aggrecanases (ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5), chemo-
kines (IL8, CCL3, CCL3L1, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL6,
CCL20), matrix components (BMP2, COL1A1, COL2A1,
ACAN),
metalloproteinases
(MMP1,
MMP3,
MMP9,
MMP13), and transcription factors (NFkB2, NFkBIA,
IkBA) were obtained from Invitrogen. The expression of
multiple genes was quantified by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR mas-
ter mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocols. Samples were amplified with an initial
activation step at 95�C for 10 minutes, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation at 95�C for 15 seconds and anneal-
ing at 60�C for 1 minute. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) acted as an endogenous refer-
ence gene for the normalization of fluorescence threshold
(Ct) values for target genes as this gene showed consistent
expression across all samples.
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM Corp). We used
a multivariate analysis with genes as independent variables
and age, BMI, sex, side (location), and tear pattern as fixed
factors. All fixed factors included in the model were categori-
cal. Age was categorized as under or over 40 years based on
a previous study demonstrating differences in the gene expres-
sion of meniscus tears between these patient populations.3

 Similarly, BMI was categorized as under or over 30 kg/m2
based on a previous study demonstrating the most significant
differences in the gene expression of meniscus tears between
these populations.17 We computed the mean and fold change
for each tear type. All results were rendered statistically sig-
nificant at a P value of �.05. Power analysis indicated that
a sample size of 12 per group was necessary to detect an effect
size of 1.2 with 80% power and a = .05.
RESULTS
Over an 18-month period, 48 patients undergoing clinically
indicated arthroscopic partial meniscectomy met the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria and consented to participate in
the study (Table 2). The majority (77%) of tears were degen-
erative and occurred in the medial meniscus (85%). No
patients had proliferative synovitis at the time of surgery.
Gene expression differed between traumatic and degen-
erative meniscus tears, with a number of chemokines and
matrix metalloproteinases expressed at higher levels in
traumatic tears compared with degenerative tears (Table
3). Two chemokines, IL8 (6.10-fold; P \ .001) and CXCL6
(7.75-fold; P \ .001), and 2 matrix metalloproteinases,
MMP1 (3.11-fold; P = .011) and MMP3 (2.44-fold; P =
.016), were expressed at significantly higher levels in trau-
matic tears compared with degenerative tears (Table 3).
Most of the other chemokines tested in this study were
found to be down-regulated in degenerative tears but did
not reach formal statistical significance. COL1A1, a major
extracellular
matrix
gene
in
meniscus
tissue,
was
expressed at a higher level in degenerative tears compared
with traumatic tears (5.98-fold; P = .058) (Table 3). None of
the gene transcripts were different between the medial and
lateral menisci.
DISCUSSION
Gene expression in the injured meniscus does vary by tear
pattern, with traumatic tears expressing higher levels of
chemokines
and
matrix
metalloproteinases
compared
with degenerative tears. This is the first study to demon-
strate a biological difference between traumatic and degen-
erative meniscus tears. These differences could contribute
to the varying potential for healing after meniscus repair
as well as advance our understanding of how meniscus
tears contribute to the development of OA in the knee.
Differences in the gene expression profile may be impor-
tant information when deciding whether to resect or repair
a meniscus tear. Traditionally, orthopaedic surgeons have
shied away from repairing degenerative tears because of
concerns about the structural integrity of the longitudinal
fibers, even if the repair healed, as well as the lack of
a blood supply to the inner meniscus.1,22,29 While tears in
the well-vascularized periphery are associated with good
healing rates,1 tears in the inner less-vascularized portion
of the meniscus are associated with worse healing.22,29
Recently, there has been a more aggressive approach to
repairing tears because of concerns about the effect of
resection on the health of the joint as well as advances in
the technical ability to complete a repair. However, biology
may be just as important as other factors in terms of deter-
mining whether a tear is likely to heal. More research is
needed in this area to better understand if and how the
variance in gene expression between the 2 tear types
affects meniscus healing of an attempted repair. For exam-
ple, the elevated catabolic environment in traumatic tears
raises concerns about their potential to heal after repair,
which may partly explain the slow and imperfect healing
observed clinically.16,29
Second, these findings may be important in terms of the
overall health of the knee joint and its relative risk for
future degeneration into OA. While it has been proposed
that meniscus degeneration precedes cartilage degenera-
tion,2,11 a previous study found only limited evidence for
a relationship between early degenerative changes in the
articular cartilage based on arthroscopic surgery and
gene expression in the injured meniscus.18 A global survey
of gene expression reported that 49 genes were differen-
tially regulated in the meniscus from knees with chondro-
sis compared with the meniscus from knees without
chondrosis.18 When chondrosis was present in the knee,
genes representing cell catabolism (cAMP catabolic pro-
cess) and tissue and endothelial cell development were
repressed, while those involved in T cell differentiation
and apoptosis were elevated. Another study has reported
the up-regulation of genes involved in inflammation and
cytokine production and the down-regulation of genes
related to DNA repair processes in meniscus cells from
knees with OA compared with meniscus cells from knees
without OA.27 How our current findings relate to that
study is difficult to assess because the knees in the current
study did not have OA—only meniscus tears, which can be
a precursor to OA.
CXCL6, also known as granulocyte chemotactic protein 2
(GCP2), is a ligand shared by 2 receptors that mediate neu-
trophil recruitment to inflammatory sites.4 While there are
no published studies to date reporting on its function in the
knee joint, CXCL6 was shown to correlate with the severity
of periodontal disease, acting as a functional adjunct to IL8,
a functionally and structurally related chemokine.12 The
elevation of both of these markers in traumatic meniscus
tears suggests that they may play a significant role in the
inflammatory response of the meniscus to injuries.
IL8 has been shown to be induced from articular carti-
lage in response to mechanical, inflammatory, and meta-
bolic stresses,5 with the authors concluding that this
cytokine is likely to play a role in OA. Osteoblasts derived
from osteophytes produce IL8, and production increased
under conditions of nonphysiological loads.23 IL8 was
recently shown to be significantly higher in the synovial
fluid of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty com-
pared with controls, and the level of IL8 was strongly cor-
related with the radiographic severity of OA.15 Meniscus
cells from healthy and OA knees have been shown to
increase the production of IL8 in response to proinflamma-
tory stimulation.25 Because this chemokine appears to play
an important role in the meniscus, as well as the articular
cartilage, bone, and synovial fluid from the knee, the

Static compression of the meniscus has been shown to
induce the expression of MMP1 in the meniscus.28 The
expression of MMP1 and MMP3 has also been shown to
be elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with OA.24 A
recent animal study demonstrated the elevated expression
of MMP1 and MMP3 from the menisci of knees with OA
compared with menisci of knees without OA.26 However,
MMP3 expression was lower in the meniscus of human
patients with OA compared with controls,20 which is con-
gruent with our findings that traumatic meniscus tears
have elevated MMP3 compared with degenerative meniscus
tears. Furthermore, MMP3 has been shown to be elevated
in the synovial fluid from knees undergoing arthroscopic
surgery and directly correlated to preoperative visual ana-
log scale scores.6 More research is needed to assess how lev-
els of MMP3 in the injured meniscus relate to levels of
MMP3 in the synovial fluid as well as clinical symptoms.
There are a number of limitations to the current study
that can be overcome by additional research in this area
to better understand if and how our findings relate to the
potential for meniscus healing, as the relevance of molecu-
lar markers for OA to the meniscus is not well studied.
First, an unbiased transcriptome analysis would provide
additional information. Quantifying the gene expression
signatures in articular cartilage and synovial fluid as
well as the meniscus from the same patients would provide
a better comparison of molecular changes in these tissues
and the overall effect on joint health. There is no in situ
analysis to confirm the origin of the mRNA or protein

Gene Expression of Traumatic and Degenerative Meniscus Tears

 validation. While the skewed distribution toward degener-
ative tears is a potential source of bias, the highly statisti-
cally
significant
large
fold
differences
between
tear
patterns make any bias, if present, unlikely to alter the
findings. Biomarkers from blood and serum were not ana-
lyzed for systemic signs of inflammation or OA. We did not
analyze the association of time from injury with gene
expression in traumatic tears, as similar data are lacking
for degenerative tears. While there is no comparison to
gene expression in healthy menisci, the purpose of the
study was to find differences between the 2 types of injury,
not compare them to healthy menisci. Finally, a prospective
study over 2 to 5 years could investigate the relationship of
variance in meniscus gene expression by tear pattern to
future degeneration in the joint.
Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates that
gene expression in the injured meniscus does relate to the
tear pattern. The elevated expression of chemokines and
matrix metalloproteinases in traumatic tears may be associ-
ated with the healing potential after attempted meniscus
repair as well as the future risk of OA in the knee. In general,
traumatic meniscus tears appear to have a more active biolog-
ical response to injuries compared with degenerative tears.
Future mechanistic studies would better characterize these
differences to understand how they can be used to guide clin-
ical decision making in the management of meniscus tears.
