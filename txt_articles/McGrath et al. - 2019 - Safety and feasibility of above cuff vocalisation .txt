Abstract
Introduction: Temporary tracheostomy is commonly used in patients admitted to intensive care units. Cuffed tubes
prevent laryngeal airflow, preventing vocalisation. Sub-glottic suction tubes such as the ‘Blue Line Ultra SuctionaidTM’
are used primarily to remove sub-glottic secretions, but retrograde gas flows via the suction port can facilitate above cuff
vocalisation. The aims were to assess whether patients could achieve an audible voice using above cuff vocalisation, to
demonstrate the safe use of the Blue Line Ultra SuctionaidTM tracheostomy tube for above cuff vocalisation, and to assess
potential benefits of above cuff vocalisation for communication, secretion management and swallowing.
Methods: Our study (Reference 15/NW/0464, IRAS 178997) recruited adult intensive care unit patients who were alert,
able to participate in an above cuff vocalisation trial and dependent on an inflated Blue Line Ultra SuctionaidTM cuff for
ventilatory support. Consenting participants underwent fibreoptic endoscopic assessment of swallow by experienced
Speech & Language Therapy staff with and without above cuff vocalisation. Clinical and fibreoptic endoscopic assessment
of swallow, assessment of voice quality, swallowing and secretion management were recorded and scored. Median
differences between paired observations and scores were analysed with and without above cuff vocalisation. Adverse
events were identified by follow up fibreoptic endoscopic assessment of swallow and patient accounts.
Results: Ten patients completed the study. Above cuff vocalisation was used for a median of 15 min, during a median of
nine episodes, over a median of three days. Above cuff vocalisation resulted in an audible voice in eight of the 10 patients,
during 66 out of 91 above cuff vocalisation attempts. There improvements in unstimulated dry cough and swallow
frequency and aspiration ratings measured by fibreoptic endoscopic assessment of swallow. No complications were
reported or observed in 66 attempts with only one episode terminated prematurely.
Conclusions: Above cuff vocalisation can achieve effective, safe, well-tolerated vocalisation in ventilator-dependant inten-
sive care unit patients. Above cuff vocalisation has the potential to aid earlier, more effective communication and may
improve laryngeal function and rehabilitation.

Introduction
Between 10 and 15% of all patients admitted to inten-
sive care units (ICUs) in the Western world will
require a temporary tracheostomy.1–4 These artificial
airways are most commonly required to facilitate pro-
longed artificial ventilation, typically requiring an
inflated cuff to ‘seal’ the trachea and allow positive
pressure ventilation (Figure 1). Gas does not therefore
flow through the upper airways (nose and mouth) and
also bypasses the larynx, meaning that whilst the
tracheostomy
tube
cuff
is
inflated,
the
patient
cannot vocalise and the ability to communicate is
impaired. The cuff is usually required to be inflated
to facilitate artificial ventilation or to offer a degree of
‘protection’ to the airway against aspiration.

 It is increasingly recognised that trans-laryngeal
aspiration and micro-aspiration of oropharyngeal or
gastric contents into the airway can contribute to ven-
tilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).5 Amongst the
published strategies to mitigate the risks of developing
VAP, subglottic suction ports have been added to a
range
of
endotracheal
and
tracheostomy
tubes,
designed to facilitate the removal of secretions that
may accumulate above the cuff.6 The inflated cuff
reduces the amount of aspirated material entering
the lungs and accumulated material can be removed
by suctioning through the additional port (Figure 1).
The Smith-Medical (Ashford, Kent, UK) ‘Blue Line
Ultra SuctionaidTM’ (BLUS) tracheostomy tube is one
such tube, with the distal opening for aspiration of
secretions situated just proximal to (above) the trache-
ostomy tube cuff. Because of this configuration, it is
possible to attach a gas flow to this ‘suctionaid’ port,
so that instead of suctioning material from above the
cuff, gas flow is instead directed in a retrograde dir-
ection. This has the effect of directing an external flow
of gas, separate to that used for ventilation, through
the vocal cords and outwards via the upper airways.
This technique has been described previously, for the
BLUS tube7–9 and for similar devices,10–18 and can
allow the patient to vocalise and articulate speech
(Figure 2). The BLUS tube is marketed by the manu-
facturer describing use of the suctionaid port for
‘speech’ as possible, but the company does not cur-
rently promote the tube for this purpose as there is no
Figure 2. Left-hand figure demonstrates the use of the BLUS subglottic suction port for the aspiration/removal of material that
collects above the cuff. The right-hand figure demonstrates the flow of gas if the suction system is reversed and gas is delivered via the
suctionaid port to exit via the larynx, above the cuff. The gas will escape through the upper airways and pass through the vocal cords,
potentially allowing vocalization. Ventilation of the lungs can continue independently.

 supporting evidence other than anecdotal and case
reports.
There are clear communication and psychological
benefits in facilitating vocalisation in patients who
may be fully alert and yet unable to talk due to the
ongoing need for cuff inflation.19,20 However, our pre-
vious experience of using above cuff vocalisation
(ACV) also additionally signalled an improvement
in laryngeal function, perhaps improving laryngeal
sensitivity by restoration of trans-laryngeal airflow.8
We hypothesised that ACV might increase cough
response to pooled laryngeal secretions, improved
swallow response, improve indices of ‘airway protec-
tion’ and reduce aspiration risks.
Despite a growing interest in ACV, especially in
critical care, there is currently a lack of research in
this area. The aims of this feasibility study were to:
1. Determine whether patients achieve a functional
voice with ACV (primary outcome)
2. Demonstrate the safe use of the BLUS tracheos-
tomy tube for ACV in ventilator-dependant ICU
patients, documenting any intolerance or adverse
effects of ACV
3. Establish
potential
benefits
of
ACV
for
communication,
secretion
management
and
swallowing
4. Contribute to the emerging evidence base for the
safe use of ACV, working towards developing
guidelines for:
a. Timing for commencement and terminating ACV
b. Optimal ACV gas flows
c. Optimal duration of use
d. Indications and contraindications for use
These aims can be addressed by clinical bedside
assessment (objectively for voice quality, adverse
effects and swallow; subjectively for intolerance), sup-
plemented by fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of
swallow
(FEES)
for
secretion
management
and
detailed swallowing assessment, and detection of
laryngeal complications.
Methods
The
UK
Medicines
and
Healthcare
Products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) were contacted and
opined that the BLUS device could be used for
ACV in line with the device’s current CE marking.
The study was subsequently granted a favourable eth-
ical opinion from the national Research Ethics
Committee (Reference 15/NW/0464, IRAS Project
ID 178997). The study was funded by an unrestricted
grant
from
Smiths-Medical
International
Ltd
(Ashford, Kent, UK).
Our tertiary single-site hospital has separate gen-
eral and cardiothoracic ICUs. Patients from either
unit who required a tracheostomy as part of the
management of their critical illness were screened
against the following inclusion criteria:
. Adult patients > 16 years old
. Cuffed BLUS (suctionaid) tracheostomy tube in
situ for more than 72 h
. Alert patient who:
� Can understand the consent process
� Can actively participate in the ACV trial (awake
and trying to communicate)
� Is suitable for FEES as per the Royal College of
Speech
and
Language
Therapists
(RCSLT)
FEES Position Paper20 (see Appendix 2)
Patients were excluded if they refused consent, had
(or were suspected to have) a potentially obstructed
upper airway, or if their clinical condition was
expected to progress such that they tolerate cuff defla-
tion and a one-way speaking valve within 72 h, negat-
ing the requirement for an ACV trial. Patients were
also excluded if FEES was contraindicated (adapted
from RCSLT FEES Position Paper),20 namely base of
skull or facial fractures, history or risk of severe epi-
staxis, recent sino-nasal trauma or surgery, or signifi-
cant nasal stenosis.
Suitable patients underwent a bedside trial of ACV
by an experienced SLT, using incremental gas flows
from 1 to 5 litres/min. If vocalisation was achieved,
formal
FEES
was
performed
and
anonymised
images recorded. FEES was initially performed with-
out ACV, and then with the nasendoscope remaining
in situ, FEES trials and measures were immediately
repeated with ACV. A standard Pentax Medical
Digital
FEES
system
(Pentax
Medical,
Tokyo,
Japan) with digital nasendoscope was used following
the Langmore FEES protocol.21 Voice was evaluated
by SLT using the GRBAS Scale (auditory-perceptual
assessment of severity of dysphonia)22 and also by
simply recording whether the vocal sounds was sub-
jectively absent, a whisper or an audible voice. The
number of spontaneous, unstimulated coughs and
swallows were observed over a two-minute period
during the assessment with and without ACV.
Bedside nursing staff were encouraged post FEES
to use ACV for up to 15 min every two hours, par-
ticularly when the patient wished to communicate.
A record of ACV use, gas flow required, quality of
vocalisation and complications were kept at the bed-
side. Patients were asked if they experienced ACV
complications, specifically discomfort, excessive oral
secretions, stomal air leak, gagging or nausea, and
staff recorded if the patient asked to remove or stop
the ACV trial. ACV continued at the discretion of the
primary clinical team until a further FEES, performed
between three and seven days later, to assess for com-
plications. ACV was also discontinued if the clinical
team attempted prolonged (>12 h) periods of cuff
deflation.

 The FEES image recordings were later jointly ana-
lysed by two experienced SLTs, blinded as to which
FEES was conducted with ACV, who agreed consen-
sus scores for each of the following scoring systems,
described in detail in Appendix 1.

Results were entered anonymously into a bespoke
MicrosoftTM Excel spreadsheet and summary metrics
were prepared. Median differences between paired
observations were analysed with SPSS 23 (IBM
Corp) using Wilcoxon signed-rank test for ordinal
scales. If continuous data were skewed, Wilcoxon
test was also used. Results are presented as median
(inter-quartile range (IQR), range) unless otherwise
stated. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.
The primary outcome of this study was to assess
cuff-inflated, ventilator-dependent ICU patients could
achieve an audible voice using ACV. Secondary out-
comes included assessing the safety of the procedure
(judged by patient-reported patient discomfort and
FEES examination) assessment of coughing, swal-
lowing
and
secretion
management
with
and
without ACV.
Results
A total of 74 patients were managed with a tracheos-
tomy over the five-month study period. Fifty-eight
tracheostomy patients either progressed to tolerating
cuff deflation or did not regain sufficient conscious-
ness to be considered for ACV. The remaining 16
patients met the criteria to be screened for inclusion.
Two
patients
had
contra-indications
for
ACV
(existing surgical emphysema) and one patient did
not have capacity following detailed evaluation.
Thirteen patients met the inclusion criteria and were
recruited to the study. Three patients did not partici-
pate beyond enrolment (two patients subsequently
tolerated prolonged cuff deflation and were with-
drawn, and one patient withdrew consent following
the first FEES, not wishing to undergo a second
examination), leaving 10 patients who completed the
study. Seven males and three females were recruited
from the Cardiothoracic (seven patients) and General
ICU (three patients). Patient demographics and indi-
cation for tracheostomy are detailed in Table 1.
All patients were ‘Nil by mouth’ at the time of
recruitment, and all had naso-gastric tubes in situ.
Nine patients had undergone percutaneous tracheos-
tomy and one had undergone an open surgical pro-
cedure. All patients had a BLUS tracheostomy tube
initially inserted, which remained in place during the
study. Sizes
7 mm
internal
diameter
tubes
(one
patient), 8 mm (four patients) and 9 mm (five patients)
were used.
All patients who completed the study underwent all
planned
assessments.
Following
baseline
FEES,
patients used ACV for a median of three days
(3, 1–7). A median of nine (7, 4–19) ACV episodes
typically lasted for 15 (10, 1–20) min, using additional
gas flows of 1–5 litres/min via the suctionaid port.
ACV resulted in an audible voice (speech or whisper)
in eight of the 10 patients, during 66 out of 91
attempts (72.5%) (Table 2). Where an audible voice
using ACV was achieved at the time of FEES, voice
quality assessment by SLT staff was possible on 13
occasions (in eight patients) using the GRBAS scale
(each domain scored from 0-normal to 3-high degree
of impairment). Median (IQR) scores for ACV voice
were as follows: GRBAS Grade 3(1), Roughness 2(1),
Breathiness 2(3), Asthenia 2(2) and Strain 2(3).
These results from the five scoring domains from
the paired FEES assessments without and with ACV
are presented in Table 3, with observed cough and
swallow counts. Three comparisons were not possible
due to secretions and laryngeal oedema obscuring the
FEES images. Secretion management significantly
improved with ACV when assessed by SSRS, as did

 TOMS and ICU FCS. There was also a significant
improvement in unstimulated dry cough and swallow
frequency. Additionally, there was a non-significant
improvement in APS and Pen-Asp scores with ACV.
Discussion
Our feasibility study has demonstrated that ACV
using retrograde gas flow via the subglottic suctionaid
port of a BLUS tracheostomy tube can achieve effect-
ive
vocalisation
in
around
three-quarters
of
ventilator-dependant, cuff-inflated ICU patients who
met our broad inclusion criteria and completed the
study. Vocalisation was judged possible using both
bedside clinical assessments (audible voice or whisper)
and more detailed SLT assessments (TOMS and ICU
FCS). Furthermore, the vast majority of patients
tolerated up to 15 min of ACV without significant
complications. Patient discomfort and excessive oral
secretions
were
the
commonest
complications
reported.
The patients recruited to this study were unable to
tolerate tracheostomy tube cuff deflation at the time
of enrolment and so ACV facilitated an effective
means of verbal communication that would have
otherwise been unavailable to them. There are clear
benefits in facilitating effective communication for
critically ill patients, for their family or carers and
for their attending medical, nursing and allied health-
care staff.26,27 Delirium, agitation, pain and compli-
ance with therapies are all likely improved with better
communication.20,28
ACV also appeared to have a significant positive
effect on secretion management (SSRS scale) and by
increasing both the unstimulated cough and swallow
frequency.
Secretion
management
also
improved
when assessed by other invasive measures (Pen-Asp
and APS) although not significantly. We postulate
that these observations may be due to an increase in
laryngeal sensitivity or afferent neural activity asso-
ciated with restoration of trans-laryngeal airflow.
There may also be a physical or physiological effect
from the exhaled gas flows that impact upon glottic
secretions facilitating upward expulsion.29 This is an
area that requires further research, as there may be

 benefits in minimising the downregulation of laryn-
geal function associated with prolonged intubation
or (cuff up) tracheostomy use, or may have potential
in stimulating earlier rehabilitation of laryngeal func-
tion and swallowing following critical illness.30–32
ACV has been described by others, but the optimal
timing to commence ACV, duration of each episode,
frequency of use and overall strategy for ACV as part
of a comprehensive weaning plan has not been estab-
lished. Our protocol was based on the clinical experi-
ence of colleagues at the Tracheostomy Review and
Management Service (TRAMS), Austin Healthcare,
Melbourne Australia (personal communication, Mrs
T Cameron, TRAMS). TRAMS use ACV as a step
towards demonstrating that the patient can manage
their tracheal and oral secretion load and therefore
tolerate cuff deflation trials, pragmatically waiting
72 h post tracheostomy insertion. Stomal air leak
was only observed on two occasions (in the same
patient who had undergone percutaneous tracheos-
tomy) and was easily detected clinically. Based on
our observations, we suggest ACV could be attempted
earlier following tracheostomy assuming the stoma
site is healing well. Stomal leak may be less of a prob-
lem with purely percutaneous tracheostomy inser-
tion.7 Earlier ACV may realize earlier vocalisation
and laryngeal function benefits without significantly
increasing the risk of subcutaneous air leak. ACV has
been limited to 10–15 min periods by others to miti-
gate concerns around the gas drying the laryngeal
mucosa.7 We did not observe any short-term evidence
of laryngeal drying and the follow up FEES did not
demonstrate any laryngeal complications. Future
work could use more sensitive measures of laryngeal
function with enhanced imaging technology such as
narrow-band imaging (NBI) or Pentax i-SCAN and
assess the effectiveness of warmed, humidified ACV
gas flows on the mucosa.
Our study has demonstrated that ACV is an effect-
ive tool for communication and vocalisation in ICU
patients dependent on cuff-inflated tracheostomy
tubes who would otherwise not be able to vocalise.
The procedure was well tolerated and accepted by
both patients and staff. There may be additional bene-
fits of ACV for secretion management and swallowing
that could positively impact on laryngeal function,
and merits further research.
