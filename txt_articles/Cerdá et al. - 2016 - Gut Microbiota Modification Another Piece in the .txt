Regular physical exercise provides many health benefits, protecting against the
development of chronic diseases, and improving quality of life. Some of the
mechanisms by which exercise provides these effects are the promotion of an
anti-inflammatory state, reinforcement of the neuromuscular function, and activation
of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Recently, it has been proposed that
physical exercise is able to modify gut microbiota, and thus this could be another factor by
which exercise promotes well-being, since gut microbiota appears to be closely related
to health and disease. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent findings on gut
microbiota modification by exercise, proposing several mechanisms by which physical
exercise might cause changes in gut microbiota.

INTRODUCTION
A sedentary lifestyle is associated with a high incidence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular
diseases, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and metabolic syndrome (Owen et al., 2010). Physical exercise
is a powerful preventive and treatment tool in several diseases, inducing metabolic and immune
effects that provide health benefits. In fact, exercise prescription is effective in preventing ischemic
heart disease, stroke, hypertension, colon and breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome,
osteoporosis, sarcopenia, functional dependence and falls in the elderly, cognitive impairment,
anxiety, and depression (Bayego et al., 2012). There are several mechanisms involved in the
health-promoting effects of physical exercise, such as the promotion of an anti-inflammatory state,
activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, and reinforcement of neuromuscular
function (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2014; Silverman and Deuster, 2014). When a muscle is contracted
with a certain intensity it works as an endocrine organ that releases cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-15) and
activates the PPARÈ coactivator 1 (PGC-1α), which in turn increases mitochondrial biosynthesis
and fatty acid utilization (Bishop-Bailey, 2013). Muscle contraction also activates the Forkhead box
class O family members FoxO1 and FoxO3 that regulate energy metabolism and govern protein
breakdown and muscle mass (Sanchez et al., 2014). In recent years, a new factor by which exercise
may promote beneficial health effects has emerged: the modification of gut microbiota. The impact
of physical exercise on gut microbiota has barely been revealed. In this review, we outline the
potential mechanisms by which exercise could impact gut microbiota.

Factors Involved in Microbiota Modulation by Exercise
GUT MICROBIOTA
The gut microbiota is a set of microorganisms that live
throughout the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, and which
increase in number and diversity from the stomach to the colon.
It has been estimated that human microbiota consists of 1014
cells (10 times the total number of cells in the human body).
In fact, in recent years some authors have defined the human
body as a symbiotic super-organism made up of eukaryotic and
prokaryotic cells (Eberl, 2010). Microbiota could be composed
of 500–1000 different species, the composition of this microbial
community is host-specific, evolves throughout the life of the
individual, and it may be changed by both exogenous and
endogenous stimuli. Gut microbiota composition begins to
take shape at birth and continues to do so during lactation.
Babies born vaginally have a more diverse microbiota, in
which Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia species predominate,
while babies born by Cesarean have a less diverse microbiota
in terms of genera, with a predominance of Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium
(Dominguez-Bello
et al., 2010). In childhood, microbiota adopts the composition
of adulthood (Sobhani et al., 2011; Spor et al., 2011) in which
only 7–9 phyla of the total phyla that make up the Bacteria
domain are represented. In adulthood microbiota, 90% of the
phylotypes belong to Firmicutes (60–80%) and Bacteroidetes (15–
30%) phyla (Ley et al., 2006a; Ringel-Kulka et al., 2011), whereas
the other minority group of bacteria belongs to Proteobacteria,
Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla (Robles
Alonso and Guarner, 2013).
GUT MICROBIOTA AND HEALTH
The relation between gut microbiota and health is increasingly
evident. Gut microbiota is crucial for the development of the
immune system, in fact, animals raised under absolute sterile
conditions (without colonizing microbiota) have a deficient
intestinal immune system (Round and Mazmanian, 2009).
The bidirectional interaction between microbiota and the host
immune system begins at birth and both evolve throughout the
life of the host. The intestinal immune system is continuously
in contact with gut microbiota and must discriminate between
beneficial and harmful bacteria. The immune system through
pattern-recognition receptors [like Toll-like receptors (TLRs)]
recognizes microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)
expressed in bacteria and depending on the type of bacteria,
tolerance is established or an immune response is triggered.
Paneth cells and B cells produce anti-microbial peptides
and immunoglobulin A respectively, that shape commensal
microbiota (Lei et al., 2015). On the other hand, gut microbiota
preserves the mucosal barrier integrity by inhibiting the adhesion
and growth of enteropathogens, and some types of bacteria have
been specifically implicated in mucosal tolerance via induction of
immune system T regulatory cells (Thompson-Chagoyán et al.,
2007; Brown et al., 2013). The balance between the immune
system and commensal microbiota is essential for maintaining
health, and the breaking of this equilibrium can trigger many
diseases, not only related to the gastrointestinal system, such
as ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and colon and gastric
cancer (Tamboli et al., 2004; Sobhani et al., 2011; Amirian
et al., 2013), but also other diseases such as metabolic syndrome
(Delzenne et al., 2011), diabetes type I and type II (Giongo
et al., 2011), allergic diseases (atopic eczema/dermatitis and
asthma) are associated with a low diversity of gut microbiota and
food allergy in infants could be related to a specific microbiota
profile (Arrieta and Finlay, 2014; Inoue and Shimojo, 2015),
rheumatoid arthritis (Vaahtovuo et al., 2008) and autism (Song
et al., 2004; Parracho et al., 2005). The presence of certain
bacterial strains of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera
in our gut microbiota enhances the absorption of minerals
and vitamins, improves lactose intolerance, has anti-diabetic
effects, lowers cholesterol levels, increases resistance to pathogen
infection, decreases the incidence of colon cancer (Zhu et al.,
2011; Kumar et al., 2012), and exerts anti-inflammatory effects
at local and systemic levels, improving the development of a
controlled and protective immune system (Villena and Kitazawa,
2014). In addition to these functions, the metabolic capacity
of gut microbiota is such that it has been called the forgotten
organ (O’Hara and Shanahan, 2006), because its metabolism
is comparable to that of the liver (Gill et al., 2006). The
different communities of bacteria that make up gut microbiota
have a variety of metabolic enzymes and other biochemical
pathways different from those of the host, which allow them,
for example, to synthesize vitamins (K, biotin, folic acid) or
ferment indigestible fiber (Legrand et al., 2010; Ou et al.,
2012). In recent years, changes in microbiota composition
have been associated with obesity (Ley et al., 2006a). Obese
individuals have different microbiota composition than their
counterparts, Bacteroidetes phylum is less represented whereas
the proportion Firmicutes phylum is increased (Ley et al., 2005,
2006b). Moreover, microbiota transplant from obese mice to lean
mice produce obesity in the recipients independently of the food
intake (Turnbaugh et al., 2008). A change in microbiota profile
toward a population of bacteria that effectively extract more non-
assimilable nutrients from the diet, such as plant polysaccharides,
could add 10–15% more calories to the energy requirements of
the hosts and may therefore influence their obesity (Turnbaugh
et al., 2006; Quigley, 2013). Furthermore, microbiota is able to
influence hepatic triglyceride production, lipid metabolism (by
modulating the pattern of bile acids), carbohydrate metabolism,
and systemic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity,
insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome (Backhed et al., 2004;
Quigley, 2013). Regarding proteins, some studies indicate that
excessive protein fermentation in the colon by harmful bacteria
may play a role in colon cancer (Corpet et al., 1995; Toden et al.,
2005).
Aspects Influencing Gut Microbiota
Gut microbiota is influenced by several factors, including host
genetics, age (Dicksved et al., 2008; O’Toole, 2012), pregnancy
(Koren et al., 2012), and some environmental factors such as
diet (De Filippo et al., 2010; David et al., 2014), the type
of birth (Salminen et al., 2004), stress, and antibiotic intake
(Nicholson et al., 2012) (Figure 1). Notwithstanding the fact that
several factors influence microbiota, it seems that microbiota

Factors Involved in Microbiota Modulation by Exercise
composition remains relatively constant throughout our lives,
although in old age species diversity seems to be lower (Koenig
et al., 2011; Yatsunenko et al., 2012). When microbiota is studied
at levels below the phylum, a greater variation of microbiota
between individuals is observed, and although it is known that
microbiota of healthy individuals provides them a number of
health benefits, it is not clear what would be the ideal composition
of the “healthy microbiota.” It is suspected that the presence
of certain species as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia
uniformis, and Bacteroides intestinalis is “key” in shaping a
“healthy microbiota” (Qin et al., 2012; Guinane and Cotter, 2013).
At present it is not known whether there are other factors that
influence microbiota composition, and the scientific community
is working hard trying to find which are the predominant factors
that modify microbiota; the interrelations between microbiota
composition; its pool of bacterial genes (microbiome) and their
expressing functions; and the physiological phenotype or disease
of the host (Lozupone et al., 2013).
PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND GUT
MICROBIOTA
Physical exercise performed at the doses recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO) results in improved fitness,
enhancing the quality of life. Exercise is intended as a useful
tool to prevent disease and improve the prognosis. Diseases in
which exercise promotes a beneficial effect include prostate and
ovarian cancer (Cannioto and Moysich, 2015; Wekesa et al.,
2015), cardiovascular diseases (Schuler et al., 2013), diabetes
(Asano et al., 2014), and stress-related disorders such as anxiety
and depression (Silverman and Deuster, 2014). The mechanisms
by which exercise has a beneficial effect on health are numerous:
effects on the HPA axis, promotion of an anti-inflammatory
state, and neuroplasticity augmentation (Silverman and Deuster,
2014). One element that could be positively modified by physical
exercise and through which it could promote well-being is the gut
microbiota. Although several years ago Bäckhed et al. suggested
that there could be a muscle-microbiota axis (Backhed et al.,
2007), there are very few studies in the literature that have
addressed the modification of gut microbiota by exercise, and
all but one have been carried out in murine models. In a recent
study, Choi et al. showed changes in the composition of the
microbiota in mice which performed exercise vs. sedentary mice.
A total of 2510 taxa of bacteria showed differences between the
exercise group and the sedentary group. Mice that performed
physical exercise showed more abundance of the Lactobacillales
order, presenting up to 24 times more Enterococcus faecium
bacteria than sedentary mice, and a marked decrease (-361
fold) of C11_K211 bacteria of the Tenericutes phylum (Choi
et al., 2013) (Table 1). These results agree with those of Queipo-
Ortuño et al. indicating that exercised rats showed an increase in
Lactobacillus and Blautia coccoides–Eubacterium rectale groups
(Queipo-Ortuño et al., 2013). Furthermore, in a study carried
out with diverse rat strains, an increase in bacterial diversity in
exercised rats was described, and more specifically an increase
in Lactobacillus genus in obese rats subjected to physical
exercise (Petriz et al., 2014). Interestingly, a significantly high
inverse correlation between blood lactate concentrations and
Clostridiaceae and Bacteroidaeae families and the Ruminococcus
genus was found, whereas the Oscillospira genus was positively
correlated with lactate levels (Petriz et al., 2014). However, the
sample size of each experimental group in this study (n = 3)
compromised the reliability of these results, and thus further
studies are needed to confirm them. Surprising data were found
when microbiota of mice on a high-fat diet (with and without
exercise) and on normal-diet (with and without exercise) were
compared (Kang et al., 2014). Exercise not only counteracted
the microbiota changes induced by the high-fat diet but caused
large shifts in Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Tenericutes phyla
in the same direction and order of magnitude as those caused
by the high-fat diet (Kang et al., 2014). Similarly, an additive
effect on increasing microbial diversity between a diet high
in fat and voluntary exercise was observed in mice (Evans
et al., 2014). In this study, exercise increased the percentage
of Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes phyla regardless of
diet; moreover, the ratio of Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes correlated
inversely with the amount of performed exercise (Evans et al.,
2014). When exercise was applied to healthy and diabetic mice,
changes in Bacteroides/Prevotella spp., Methanobrevibacter spp.,
and Clostridium cluster I were observed for both groups, whereas
an increase in Bifidobacterium spp. level was only observed
in exercised non-diabetic mice, indicating that the presence of
diabetes nullified this effect (Lambert et al., 2015) (Table 1).
These data may indicate that changes induced by exercise are
influenced by the metabolic state of the individuals, and this
factor must be taken into account in further studies. From
a different approach, Hsu et al. observed that mice lacking
microbiota, those monocolonized with Bacteroides fragilis, and
normally raised mice had different exercise performance on
a strenuous exercise, and the observed effect seemed to be
mediated by the impact of the resident microbiota on the
antioxidant status (Hsu et al., 2015). In the unique human
study carried out up to now comparing athletes (rugby players)
vs. healthy controls, Clarke et al. observed that the athletic
group had a greater diversity of microbial species—22 phyla,
68 families, and 113 genera—in contrast with the 11 phyla,
33 families, and 65 genera of the control group (Clarke et al.,
2014). However, notwithstanding the differences in the athletes’
diets with respect to that of the controls, a unique effect of
exercise on gut microbiota diversity could not be determined,
taking into account the considerable impact of diet on gut
microbiota (Clarke et al., 2014; Flint et al., 2015; O’Sullivan et al.,
2015).
POTENTIAL MECHANISM BY WHICH
EXERCISE INFLUENCES GUT
MICROBIOTA
In a study conducted by Bäckhed et al. it was observed
that animals lacking microbiota were resistant to diet-induced
obesity. In the search for mechanisms that could explain
this effect, the authors noted that there were two metabolic

pathways through which muscle and microbiota were linked.
On the one hand, levels of the 5′ adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), an enzyme involved in
energy homeostasis and activation of fatty acid oxidation and
glucose uptake in muscle, were 40% higher in the muscle of
germ-free rats compared than that of control rats; thus, the
presence of microbiota suppressed fatty acid oxidation and
glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (Backhed et al., 2007). On
the other hand, the lack of microbiota also caused an increase
in the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) in
the intestine. This FIAF is an inhibitor of the lipoprotein lipase
peroxisomal proliferator that may be involved in regulating the
expression of genes encoding key enzymes implicated in fatty
acid oxidation in muscle, in an AMPK-independent mechanism.
Moreover, locomotor activity of the germ-free animals was higher
than their counterparts. Although the cause of this increased
locomotor activity is unknown, it may indicate a relation between
the metabolic activity of the microbiota and behaviors that
may contribute to the observed differences in adiposity between
animals without microbiota and conventional animals (Backhed
et al., 2004). Currently, the mechanisms by which exercise may
cause changes in microbiota are not fully understood. Probably
a compendium of factors and pathways are involved in the
observed changes. In this review, we attempt to enumerate them
(Figure 2).
Bile Acids
One of the factors by which exercise may cause changes in gut
microbiota is the modification of the bile acids profile. Several
studies have found an inverse relation between the amount of
fecal bile acids and physical activity, and this relation becomes
stronger as physical activity intensifies (Hagio et al., 1985;
Sutherland et al., 1991; Wertheim et al., 2009). In general, bile
acids have an antimicrobial effect, but not all to the same extent,
so depending on the bile acids profile and their concentration
they may exert selective pressure on certain bacterial groups,
favoring the presence of some and reducing the presence of other
bacterial groups. In fact, in rats whose diets were supplemented
with cholic acid, a great change in microbiota profile was
observed in both diversity and composition, resulting in an
increase of the Firmicutes phylum (mainly Clostridia class)
and decrease of the Bacteroidetes phylum (Islam et al., 2011).
Furthermore, microbiota is capable of synthesizing the so-called
secondary bile acids that can bind receptors in the liver and
muscle. Bile acids, in addition to their function related to the
absorption of lipids and cholesterol metabolism, can work as
metabolic function integrators, activating hormone receptors
such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), that protects against body
weight gain and liver and muscle fat deposition (Wang et al.,
1999; Claudel et al., 2005; Cipriani et al., 2010). Watanabe
et al. found that the addition of cholic acid to the diet of mice

fed with a high-fat diet caused an increase in the expression
of genes related to energy expenditure, mainly those related
to cyclic-AMP-dependent thyroid hormone-activating enzyme
type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) in brown adipose tissue
(Watanabe et al., 2006) (Figure 2). Although brown adipose
tissue is not found significantly in humans, D2 is significantly
expressed in skeletal muscle, and so ultimately it could be
hypothesized that bile acids may increase energy expenditure in
muscle.
Short-Chain Fatty Acids
Another fact that supports the existence of a muscle-microbiota
axis is the change that exercise produces in the fecal short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) profile. In animal models, it has
been observed that running exercise increases fecal butyrate
levels, and this change is associated with changes in butyrate-
producer bacteria groups (Matsumoto et al., 2008). Therefore,
increased SCFAs production through microbiota profile changes
could be one of the mechanisms by which physical exercise

promotes health, since SCFA butyrate has the ability to inhibit
histone deacetylases, and subsequently it has an impact on
gene regulation, immune modulation, cancer suppression, cell
differentiation, intestinal barrier regulation, oxidative stress
reduction, diarrhea control, visceral sensitivity, and intestinal
motility modulation (Leonel and Alvarez-Leite, 2012).
On the other hand, the SCFAs produced by the microbiota
are capable of activating AMPK in the muscle (Yamashita et al.,
2007, 2009) (Figure 2). AMPK controls the activity of various
factors implicated in the regulation of cholesterol levels and in
the metabolism of lipids and glucose in the muscle (den Besten
et al., 2013; Kasubuchi et al., 2015). The activation of AMPK
in the muscle by the SCFAs can occur directly by augmenting
the AMP/ATP ratio and/or indirectly through the Ffar2-leptin
pathway, but the extent to which AMPK activation is regulated
for each pathway in vivo is still unknown (den Besten et al., 2013).
Moreover, SCFAs through Ffar2/3 receptors in the colon increase
plasma PYY (a satiety hormone) that reinforces the action of
insulin on glucose disposal in muscle and adipose tissue (den
Besten et al., 2013).
Toll-Like Receptors—Lipopolysaccharide
The activation of the TLRs in the muscle by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) from the membrane of bacteria is another route by which
the muscle and the microbiota may be in communication.
The muscles express TLR4 and TLR5 receptors that could be
activated by circulating LPS (LPS9 or flagellin respectively) and
whose levels depend on gut microbiota composition (Bindels
and Delzenne, 2013). The stimulation of TLRs by LPS from the
membrane of certain bacterial types triggers the production of
inflammatory cytokines in the muscle through the activation
of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
B cells (NF-kB) (McFarlin et al., 2004; Stewart et al., 2005).
In fact, the injection of LPS in mice caused muscle atrophy
through TLR4 receptors (Doyle et al., 2011). Acute and chronic
physical exercise in rats on a high-fat diet induced an important
suppression in the TLR4 signaling pathway in the liver, muscle,
and adipose tissue, reducing LPS serum levels and improved
insulin signaling and sensitivity (Oliveira et al., 2011). Moreover,
exercise prevented lung injury and associated oxidative stress
provoked by instillation of LPS (Reis Goncalves et al., 2012;
da Cunha et al., 2013, 2014) and LPS-induced depressive-like
behavior in rats (Martin et al., 2014).
Ig-A-Mediated Mucosal Immunity
An increase of immunoglobulin A (IgA) production and a
reduced number of B and CD4 + T cells have been observed
in the gut of animals that performed long-term moderate
exercise compared to sedentary mice. Gene expression of IL-6,
IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β cytokines (which are involved in IgA
regulation) and that of TNF-α and IL-12 was overexpressed in
the duodenum of exercised mice, whereas IL-2 gene expression
was downregulated (Viloria et al., 2011). The increased levels of
intestinal IgA caused by exercise may augment the resistance of

Factors Involved in Microbiota Modulation by Exercise
exercised mice to intestinal pathogen infections, as well as the
resistance to colonization by commensal microbiota, ultimately
influencing the composition of the microbiota (Viloria et al.,
2011; Macpherson et al., 2015).
Myokines
During
physical
activity,
myokines
(cytokines
and
other
peptides) are released from muscle fibers, exerting a paracrine
and endocrine effect. Muscle cells are able to produce IL-6 by
themselves, increasing up to 100-fold the circulating levels of this
cytokine during exercise (Fischer, 2006). Circulating IL-6 seems
to have a dual effect: an effect related to metabolism, in which IL-
6 acts by increasing fat oxidation and glucose uptake via AMPK
phosphorylation (van Hall et al., 2003; Pedersen and Febbraio,
2012), but also an anti-inflammatory effect, as IL-6 produced
during exercise triggers the secretion of IL-10, IL-1ra, and
TNF-R anti-inflammatory cytokines, protecting against chronic
diseases associated with low-grade inflammation (Petersen and
Pedersen, 2005). It is well known that microbiota is altered
during inflammation-related diseases such as inflammatory
bowel diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes (Sekirov
et al., 2010); however, whether IL-6 or other myokines released
from the muscle could have an impact on microbiota is a totally
unexplored topic.
Weight Loss
Another factor by which exercise could cause changes in gut
microbiota composition is the weight loss that sometimes is
associated with exercise. Diversity and composition of microbiota
from obese individuals differ from microbiota of non-obese
individuals (Turnbaugh et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2012; Teixeira et al.,
2013; Remely et al., 2015). However, the nature of these changes
and how they are produced is unknown; if weight loss involves
changes in gut microbiota or if a change in gut microbiota
composition contributes to weight loss is a question that requires
further research.
Gut Transit Time
Moderate exercise reduces intestinal transit time (Oettle, 1991),
which could influence the microbiota composition. In fact,
a decrease in Bacteroidetes phylum and Prevotella genus in
the microbiota of constipated obese children was observed
in comparison with the microbiota of obese children with
normal intestinal transit time (Zhu et al., 2014). The stool
consistency (a parameter related to intestinal transit time)
is strongly related to microbial diversity; stool firmness is
related to Methanobrevibacter, Oxalobacter, Butyricimonas, and
Akkermansia populations, whereas the Bacteroides genus is more
abundant in loose stool (Vandeputte et al., 2015). The presence of
certain genera of bacteria or others depending on the gut transit
time could be explained by the adaptation of determined bacterial
genera to growth in slow-transit time conditions, with reduced
ecosystem water activity, resistance to water stress conditions, or
higher fluctuations in nutrient availability, or, on the contrary,
by the adaptation to grow in fast-transit time conditions with
the ability to attach to colonic tissue or to have a high growth
rate (Vandeputte et al., 2015). Besides modifying the intestinal
transit, strenuous and prolonged exercise (i.e., long-distance
running and triathlons) provokes diarrhea and gastrointestinal
bleeding (Martin, 2011). These changes in gut permeability
produce a phenomenon of ischemia and reperfusion that can
affect gut microbiota. In murine models of ischemia reperfusion,
a dynamic change in gut microbiota occurs; microbiota diversity
decreases in early injury, whereas in reperfusion there is an
increase of Escherichia coli and Prevotella oralis and a decrease
of several species of the Lactobacillus genus (Wang et al., 2012,
2013). There are no human studies related to this issue, but it
would be interesting to conduct some, given the importance of
gut microbiota in health (Bermon et al., 2015).
Stress and Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal
Axis
The term microbial endocrinology was first coined by Lyte in
1993 as a “conceptual framework to understand interactions
between the microbiota and the host” (Lyte, 1993; Bailey,
2014). Commensal bacteria are able to segregate hormones
and neurotransmitters (epinephrine, acetylcholine, histamine,
serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid) which can induce changes
at the brain level, and in turn, bacteria have receptors for
these hormones, thus they can communicate with the host
brain (Bailey, 2014). The activation of the HPA axis produces
changes in certain populations of bacteria (Pullinger et al.,
2010b), and bacteria can produce hormones that modify the
behavior of the host (Bravo et al., 2011). This communication
axis allows certain hormone-releasing stimuli, such as stress,
to modify the gut microbiota (Figure 2). Stress of physical or
psychological etiology causes HPA axis activation and the release
of various hormones (corticotropin, cortisol, noradrenaline,
adrenalin, dopamine) (Axelrod and Reisine, 1984), and gut
microbiota dysbiosis (Galley and Bailey, 2014). The release of
corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) causes changes in gastric
acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and mucus production
(Tache and Perdue, 2004; Bhatia and Tandon, 2005) that likely
influence gut microbiota. In animal models, the stress caused by
maternal separation or food deprivation increases serotonin and
noradrenaline levels, provoking a shift in microbiota profile with
a decrease of lactobacilli which increase the host susceptibility
to opportunistic infections (Bailey and Coe, 1999; O’Mahony
et al., 2009; Reynolds et al., 2010). Similar changes were found in
gut microbiota of undergraduate students in a stressful situation
like the examination period (Knowles et al., 2008). Moreover,
elevated plasmatic levels of norepinephrine due to stress have an
impact on gut microbiota by increasing the virulence of enteric
pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and
E. coli (Freestone et al., 2007; Pullinger et al., 2010a). In physical
exercise, physical stress and homeostasis disruption occurs when
the body exceeds 60% of the maximum volume of oxygen
(VO2max) or the duration of exercise exceeds 90 min, even if
the intensity does not exceed 40% VO2max (Luger et al., 1987),
producing an activation of the HPA axis and hormone release
which is more significant as the exercise intensity increases
(Duclos et al., 1997). In addition to physical stress, athletes in
pre-competition periods suffer high psychological stress (Noblet

Factors Involved in Microbiota Modulation by Exercise
and Gifford, 2002) that also triggers HPA axis activation. All
of the above indicates that the release of hormones that occurs
during exercise could modify the microbiota profile of subjects
who practice physical exercise at certain intensities or durations.
However, studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, as there
are no studies in the literature addressing the effect of physical
and psychological stress linked to exercise in gut microbiota.
PERSPECTIVE
There is scientific evidence that exercise has a health-promoting
effect. However, if this beneficial effect may be associated in
part to gut microbiota modulation, it has been barely explored.
Preclinical studies indicate that physical exercise promotes
microbial diversity (which is associated with a healthier state) and
increases health-beneficial gut bacteria populations. Moreover,
the only study carried out on humans appears to confirm
murine model results. However, it is not clear which populations
are modified and how, as has been shown by contradictory
findings. Some of the reasons for these discrepancies could be
the various forms of exercise used in these studies (acute exercise,
chronic exercise, cardio and resistance training, voluntarily), the
different doses of exercise applied, and the exercise duration. The
observed changes in gut microbiota are triggered by underlying
mechanisms which are quite unknown nowadays and that we
have tried to compile. The importance of each of these factors
and to what extent they could modify the gut microbiota still
require further investigation. Given the close relation between
the microbiota and the immune system and its involvement in
several diseases, it is essential to know which factors modify gut
microbiota, and exercise seems to be one of them. Manipulation
of gut microbiota by modifying diet or exercise habits could be a
powerful tool in the future to prevent or treat several diseases.
