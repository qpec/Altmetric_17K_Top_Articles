Abstract 
It is well-established that cannabinoids exert palliative effects on some cancer-
associated symptoms. In addition evidences obtained during the last fifteen years 
support that these compounds can reduce tumour growth in animal models of cancer. 
Cannabinoids have been shown to activate an ER-stress related pathway that leads to 
the stimulation of autophagy-mediated cancer cell death. In addition, cannabinoids 
inhibit tumour angiogenesis and decrease cancer cell migration. The mechanisms of 
resistance to cannabinoid anticancer action as well as the possible strategies to develop 
cannabinoid-based combinational therapies to fight cancer have also started to be 
explored. In this review we will summarize these observations (that have already helped 
to set the bases for the development of the first clinical studies to investigate the 
potential clinical benefit of using cannabinoids in anticancer therapies) and will discuss 
the possible future avenues of research in this area.

1. Introduction 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component of Cannabis sativa exerts 
its effects by mimicking endogenous substances - the endocannabinoids anandamide 
(Devane et al, 1992) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) (Mechoulam et al, 1995; 
Sugiura et al, 1995) - that bind specific cannabinoid receptors located in the plasma 
membrane (Pertwee et al, 2010). Two major cannabinoid-specific receptors - CB1 and 
CB2 - have been identified (Matsuda et al, 1990; Munro et al, 1993). The transient 
receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), the orphan G 
protein-coupled receptor GPR55 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors 
(PPARs) have been proposed to act as endocannabinoid receptors, although their 
precise contribution in the context of the endocannabinoid signalling is still a matter of 
debate (Pertwee et al, 2010). Most of cannabinoids effects in the central nervous system 
rely on CB1 receptor activation (Pertwee et al, 2010), Nevertheless expression of CB1 
receptor is not restricted to the central nervous system and this receptor is widely 
expressed in many different locations in the organism (Pertwee et al, 2010) The CB2 
receptor was initially described to be present in the immune system (Pertwee et al, 
2010), although differents studies have shown that it is also present in cells from other 
origins including astrocytes and certain populations of neurons (Atwood and Mackie, 
2010; Fernandez-Ruiz et al, 2007). Of note, expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors 
occurs in many types of cancer cells, an event that not necessarily correlates with the 
expression of these receptors in non-transformed cells from the tissue from which 
cancer cells originated (Fernandez-Ruiz et al, 2007; Guzman et al, 2006; Sarfaraz et al, 
2008). 
 
The endocannabinoid system - constituted by the endocannabinoids, their 
receptors and the proteins involved in the synthesis, transport and degradation of 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

5 
endocannabinoids - exerts numerous regulatory functions in the organism (Katona and 
Freund, 2008); (Pacher et al, 2006; Pertwee, 2009). Accordingly, the pharmacological 
manipulation of the endocannabinoid system is being investigated for the treatment of 
many different diseases. In a cancer context, cannabinoids have been shown to alleviate 
nausea and vomit induced by chemotherapy (Guzman, 2003; Pertwee, 2009) and several 
cannabinoid-based medicines [Marinol (THC) and Cesamet (nabilone, a synthetic 
analogue of THC)] are approved for this purpose. Cannabinoids also inhibit pain, and 
Sativex (a standardized cannabis extract) has been approved in Canada for the treatment 
of cancer-associated pain. Other potential palliative effects of cannabinoids in oncology 
include appetite stimulation and attenuation of wasting (Pertwee et al, 2010).  
In addition to these palliative actions of cannabinoids in cancer patients, THC 
and other cannabinoids exhibit antitumour effects in animal models of cancer (Guzman, 
2003; Sarfaraz et al, 2008); (Pisanti et al, 2013; Velasco et al, 2012). 
 
2- Endocannabinoid system: Role in tumor generation and progression 
A relatively large body of data has accumulated during the last decade about the role of 
endocannabinoid system in tumor generation and progression (see Table 1 for a brief 
summary of some of these observations). In many cases, these reports show that levels 
of endocannabinoids and their receptors are increased in cancer, a situation that 
frequently correlates with tumor aggressiveness (Malfitano et al, 2011).  Accordingly, 
anandamide and 2-AG have been shown to be over-expressed in several types of tumors 
including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), meningiona, pituitary adenoma, prostate 
and colon carcinoma and endometrial sarcoma (Pisanti et al, 2013). In addition, 
circulating endocannabinoid levels have been associated with increased disease 
progression in a mouse model of metastatic melanoma and in human samples of this

pathology (Sailler et al, 2014). A similar situation has been proposed for cannabinoid 
receptors and endocannabinoid degrading enzymes. Thus, CB1 receptor was found to be 
upregulated in Hodgkin lymphoma cells (Benz et al, 2013) and in chemically induced 
cellular hepatocarcinoma (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2015). CB1 receptors levels are also 
increased and correlate with disease severity in human epithelial ovarian tumors 
(Messalli et al, 2014) and have been proposed to be a factor of bad prognosis following 
surgery in stage IV colorectal cancer (Jung et al, 2013) 
Regarding CB2 receptor, a correlation between its expression, histologic grade 
and prognosis has been demonstrated in breast cancer (Caffarel et al, 2006) and glioma 
(Sanchez et al, 2001). In this latter tumor type a combined up-regulation of CB1 and 
CB2 receptors has been proposed to occur together with a decrease on the levels of the 
enzymes involved in endocannabinoid degradation compared healthy controls (Wu et 
al, 2012). Similarly expression of CB1 and CB2 is enhanced in mantle cell lymphoma, 
whilst FAAH expression is reduced compared to non-malignant B-cells (Ek et al, 2002; 
Islam et al, 2003; Wasik et al, 2014).  
Recently, a role for the non-canonical cannabinoid receptor GPR55 in cancer 
development has been described. Higher histological grades of human glioblastomas, 
breast, pancreatic and skin cancer have been reported in association with increased 
GPR55 expression. Moreover, silencing of GPR55 reduced the proliferation of tumor 
cells in a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma (Andradas et al, 2011; Perez-Gomez 
et al, 2013) 
Altogether, these data suggest that the endocannabinoid system may play a pro-
tumorigenic role and in agreement with this hypothesis genetic ablation of CB1 and 
CB2 receptor decrease UV light induced skin carcinogenesis  (Zheng et al, 2008) and 
CB2 receptor overexpression enhances the predisposition to leukemia after leukemia

virus infection (Joosten et al, 2002). Moreover, genetic ablation of CB1 receptor 
suppresses the growth of hepatocarcinoma cellular (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2015). 
Nevertheless, different observations also support that the endocannabinoid 
system plays a tumour suppressor role in different cancer types. Thus, genetic 
inactivation of CB1 receptor increases intestinal tumor growth in a colon carcinoma 
genetic mouse model (Wang et al, 2008). In line with this idea, monoacylglycerol lipase 
(MAGL; the 2-AG degrading enzyme),has been shown to be highly expressed in several 
types of tumors, which is associated with increased migration, invasion, survival, and 
tumor growth (Nomura et al, 2010). In addition, FAAH tumor levels directly correlate 
with the severity and outcome of prostate adenocarcinoma (Thors et al, 2010). These 
data are in line with accumulative evidences (described in the following section), that 
demonstrate that cannabinoids (endogenous, phytocannabinoids or synthetic) act as 
efficient anti-tumoral agents in a wide range of cancer cells. 
 
Further studies, including those analyzing the activation of the precise signalling 
mechanisms involved in the regulation of cannabinoid-induced cell death or cell 
proliferation upon genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the endocannabinoid 
system, are therefore needed to clarify which are the determinants for this system to act 
as oncogenic or tumour suppressor. 
 
3. Cannabinoid anticancer activity 
Despite the above discussed conflicting data relative to the role of endocannabinoid 
system in tumor generation and progression, during the last fifteen years many different 
reports have shown that cannabinoid receptor agonists (derived from the plant, like 
THC, endogenous like 2-AG and anandamide or synthetic - with similar or different 
affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors like WIN 55,2121-2 or JWH-133) exert antitumour

effects in experimental models of cancer [reviewed in Velasco et al. (2012)] supporting 
that pharmacological stimulation of CB receptors is antitumorigenic. Nonetheless, a 
tumour-promoting effect of cannabinoids has been proposed in a few reports (Cudaback 
et al, 2010; Hart et al, 2004; McKallip et al, 2005; Zhu et al, 2000).  
Cannabinoid treatment promote cancer cell death, impair tumour angiogenesis 
and block invasion and metastasis (Velasco et al, 2012). The molecular mechanisms 
that have been proposed to be involved in  cannabinoid anticancer actions have been 
thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (Caffarel et al, 2012; Pisanti et al, 2013; Velasco et al, 
2012) and therefore will only be shortly discussed here. 
 
3.1 Cannabinoids induce cancer cell death  
The mechanism of cannabinoid anticancer action relies, at least largely, on the ability of 
these agents to stimulate autophagy-mediated apoptotic cancer cell death (Velasco et al, 
2012). Thus, THC binds cannabinoid receptors, which leads to the stimulation of 
sphingolipid synthesis de novo and the subsequent activation of an ER stress-related 
signaling route that involves the up-regulation of the transcriptional co-activator nuclear 
protein 1 (Nupr1, also named p8) and its effector the pseudo-kinase tribbles homolog 3 
(TRIB3) (Armstrong et al, 2015; Blazquez et al, 2004; Carracedo et al, 2006a; 
Carracedo et al, 2006b; Galve-Roperh et al, 2000; Gomez del Pulgar et al, 2002; 
Velasco et al, 2012). The stimulation of this pathway promotes in turn autophagy via 
TRIB3-mediated inhibition of the AKT/ mTORC1 axis (Salazar et al, 2009; Salazar et 
al, 2013). Autophagy is considered primarily a cytoprotective mechanism, although its 
activation can also lead to cell death (Eisenberg-Lerner et al, 2009; Galluzzi et al, 2015; 
Mizushima et al, 2008). A series of experiments demonstrated that autophagy is

9 
upstream of apoptosis in the mechanism of cannabinoid-induced cell death (Armstrong 
et al, 2015; Salazar et al, 2009; Vara et al, 2011). 
 
The direct participation of the autophagy pathway in the antitumour action of 
cannabinoids has been clearly demonstrated in different types of cancer cells (namely, 
glioma, melanoma, pancreatic and hepatic cancer cells; (Armstrong et al, 2015; 
Carracedo et al, 2006a; Carracedo et al, 2006b; Salazar et al, 2009; Vara et al, 2011). 
These observations support that this signalling route could be a general mechanism by 
which activation of CB receptors promotes cancer cell death. In any case, additional 
mechanisms (some of them cell type specific) may cooperate with this pathway to 
trigger cancer cell death (Vara et al, 2011); (Caffarel et al, 2012; Caffarel et al, 2006; 
Guzman, 2003; Sarfaraz et al, 2008; Vara et al, 2013). (see also Box 2).  
Cannabidiol (CBD; a plant-derived cannabinoid with low affinity for 
cannabinoid receptors; (Pertwee, 2009), and other marijuana-derived cannabinoids 
(Ligresti et al, 2006) have also been shown to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells. CBD 
produces these anticancer actions - at least in part – via enhanced production of reactive 
oxygen species (Massi et al, 2008; Shrivastava et al, 2011). It has also been proposed 
that CBD may activate TRPV2 receptors to promote cancer cell death (Nabissi et al, 
2012). 
 
3.2 Cannabinoids inhibit angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis  
In addition to the above-described cancer cell death promoting effect of cannabinoids, 
treatment with these compounds has been shown to normalize tumour vasculature. 
These effects seem to rely on the ability of cannabinoids to inhibit the stimulation of the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Thus, various components of the 
VEGF-activated pathway, such as the active forms of its best-established receptors 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
10 
(VEGFR1 and VEGFR2), have been shown to be down-regulated in response to 
treatment with cannabinoids in different cancer types (Casanova et al, 2003); (Blazquez 
et al, 2003; Blazquez et al, 2004); (Portella et al, 2003). Likewise, cannabinoid receptor 
activation inhibits migration and proliferation, and induces apoptosis in vascular 
endothelial cells (Blazquez et al, 2003; Pisanti et al, 2007) which might also contribute 
to the antiangiogenic effect of cannabinoids. 
In addition, cannabinoids have been shown to reduce the formation of distant 
tumour masses in animal models of spontaneous and induced metastasis. Moreover, 
these compounds inhibit migration, adhesion and invasiveness of different types of 
cancer cells (Blazquez et al, 2008; Grimaldi et al, 2006; Preet et al, 2008; Qamri et al, 
2009; Ramer and Hinz, 2008); (Ramer et al, 2008). This anti-metastatic activity of 
cannabinoids relies, at least in part, on the regulation of extracellular proteases and their 
inhibitors (Blazquez et al, 2008; Ramer et al, 2008). Several observation support that 
the ER stress-related signalling pathway involved in the stimulation of autophagy-
mediated cancer cell death may also play a role in the control of these actions of 
cannabinoids (Blazquez et al, 2004; Blazquez et al, 2008).  
Of note, CBD exerts a significant anticancer effect – and specifically the 
inhibition of invasiveness and mestastasis - in different animal models of cancer acting 
independently of cannabinoid receptors. This effect of CBD relies – at least partially - 
on the downregulation of ID-1 (transcription factor inhibitor of DNA binding-1) 
(McAllister et al, 2011; Murase et al, 2014; Soroceanu et al, 2012).  
 
4. Mechanisms of resistance to cannabinoid anticancer action 
Today is well established that the molecular characteristics of each individual tumour 
and patient determine the responsiveness to anticancer therapies. Although much further 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
11 
research is still required to clarify this issue in the case of cannabinoids, work 
performed in our laboratory supports that - at least in gliomas – the differences in the 
expression of a particular set of genes rather that in the levels of CB receptors 
determines the sensitivity to THC-induced cell death, (Lorente et al, 2011). We found 
that increased expression of midkine [MDK; (Kadomatsu, 2005; Mirkin et al, 2005), 
one of the genes that is strongly up-regulated in cannabinoid-resistant glioma cells] is 
associated with a lower overall survival of glioblastoma patients (Lorente et al, 2011). 
MDK promotes resistance to THC-induced cell death via stimulation of one of its target 
receptors, the anaplastic lymphoma tyrosine kinase receptor [ALK (Palmer et al, 2009)] 
which abrogates the induction of autophagy-mediated glioma cell death by THC. 
Supporting the potential therapeutic relevance of these findings, pharmacological 
inhibition of ALK or MDK knock-down abolishes the resistance to cannabinoid 
treatment of tumour xenografts derived from THC-resistant glioma cells (Lorente et al, 
2011). Altogether, these observations support that stimulation of the MDK–ALK axis 
promotes resistance to cannabinoid anticancer action in glioblastoma and pave the way 
for the development of anticancer therapies based on the combined administration of 
THC and inhibitors of the MDK-ALK axis (Figure 1). In line with this idea, ALK 
inhibitors – which have started to be assayed in clinical trials for the management of 
non-small-cell lung cancer and other types of tumours (de Bono and Ashworth, 2010; 
Grande et al, 2011) - have been proposed to be of potential utility in Glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM; (Wallace et al, 2013). Following this line of reasoning, the ALK and 
the MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) inhibitor Crizotinib is 
currently being evaluated in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide [TMZ; 
the benchmark agent for the management of glioblastoma (Stupp et al, 2005)] in a 
Phase 1b clinical study in adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma

12 
(NCT02270034) which may facilitate the development of future studies combining this 
inhibitor with cannabinoids. A second generation of ALK inhibitors with a lower risk of 
developing drug resistance in patients, such as Ceritinib or Alectinib, is being already 
evaluated in clinical studies (Pall, 2015). Alternative approaches to inhibit MDK-ALK 
axis could also include the use the humanized antibodies against MDK or its receptor 
ALK.  
It is worth noting that other growth factors [such as the heparin-bound epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin] have been implicated in the 
resistance to cannabinoid antitumour action (Lorente et al, 2009); (Hart et al, 2004). 
Thus pharmacological blockade of EGFR, (Lorente et al, 2009) enhances the cell death-
promoting action of THC in cultures of glioma cells. These observations suggest that 
targeting EGFR pathway may also be a therapeutic strategy to enhance cannabinoid 
anticancer activity. Whether these or other mechanisms may play a relevant role in 
promoting resistance to cannabinoid anticancer action in other tumour types remains to 
be investigated.  
 
5. Towards the use of cannabinoid-based combinational therapies  
Current strategies to fight cancer are based on the use of combinational anticancer 
therapies as this approach permits the simultaneous targeting of tumour growth, at 
different levels. In agreement with this line of reasoning, the combined administration 
of cannabinoids with other anticancer agents has been shown to act synergistically to 
inhibit tumour growth. Accordingly, treatment with THC and TMZ exerts a strong anti-
cancer action in xenografts generated with glioma cells. Importantly this effect also 
takes place in TMZ-resistant tumours (Torres et al, 2011). Likewise, mice treated with 
TMZ and THC did not show signs of toxicity (Torres et al, 2011). Most glioblastoma 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
13 
patients are treated with TMZ, and therefore these findings support that the combined 
administration of TMZ and cannabinoids could be therapeutically exploited for the 
management of glioblastoma (Figure 1).  
 
Likewise, another study performed with pancreatic cancer cells showed that 
gemcitabine (the benchmark agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer) acted 
synergistically with different cannabinoid agonists to reduce cell viability (Donadelli et 
al, 2011). Other studies showed that anandamide and HU-210 increase the 
antineoplastic activity of paclitaxel (Miyato et al, 2009) and 5-fluorouracil (Gustafsson 
et al, 2009).  
Another approach has been to assay the anticancer activity of the combination of 
THC and CBD. Thus, the administration of these two agents enhances the anticancer 
activity of THC and decreases the doses of THC required to produce tumour growth-
inhibition (Marcu et al, 2010; Torres et al, 2011). Moreover, the combined 
administration of THC, CBD and TMZ produces a very strong decrease in the growth of 
xenografts generated with glioma cells even when low doses of THC are employed 
(Torres et al, 2011). Furthermore the administration of THC and CBD also enhanced 
the anticancer effects of radiation in an orthotopic murine glioma model (Scott et al, 
2014). Since, CBD alleviates some of the undesired side effects of THC (for example 
discoordination, convulsions, and psychotic events), its administration in combination 
with THC may help to improve the tolerability to medicines containing this agent or 
other cannabinoid receptor agonists (Pertwee, 2009). Following this line of reasoning it 
is worth noting that C. sativa produces ~108 different cannabinoids and, apart from 
CBD, some of them may help to reduce the undesired side-effects of THC or have other 
therapeutic activities (Pertwee, 2009). Therefore, in addition to the use of pure 
substances (such as THC and CBD) for the development of clinical studies to 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
14 
investigate the efficacy of cannabinoids as anticancer agents, one possible additional 
approach could be using cannabis extracts with precisely-defined amounts of THC, 
CBD and other cannabinoids. 
 
6. Towards the development of clinical studies to test the efficacy of cannabinoids 
as anticancer agents 
Despite the remarkable amount of preclinical research on the potential therapeutic 
applications of cannabinoids the use of cannabis-based medicines in the clinical practice 
is restricted to palliative uses in a few diseases. Nevertheless, preclinical data 
accumulated during the last decade has stimulated the interest in developing additional 
clinical studies aimed at investigating the potential therapeutic value of these 
compounds in different diseases and specifically their potential as anticancer agents. 
The first of this studies was a pilot Phase I clinical trial in which 9 patients with 
actively-growing recurrent glioblastoma that had previously failed standard therapy 
underwent intracranial THC administration (Guzman et al, 2006). Cannabinoid delivery 
under these conditions was safe. Likewise, significant undesired effects were not 
observed in the patients of the study. In addition, analysis of the results obtained in this 
study suggested that some patients responded - at least partially - to THC treatment 
(Guzman et al, 2006). Importantly, analyses of samples obtained from 2 patients in this 
study before and after THC treatment indicated that administration of this cannabinoid 
correlated with the activation of the mechanisms that had been previously shown to be 
involved in the anticancer activity of THC in animal models of cancer [for example 
stimulation of autophagy and apoptosis (Carracedo et al, 2006b; Guzman et al, 2006; 
Salazar et al, 2009), inhibition of cell proliferation (Guzman et al, 2006), decreased 
VEGF signalling (Blazquez et al, 2004) and MMP-2 down-regulation (Blazquez et al, 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
15 
2008)]., These encouraging findings fostered the interest on the utilization of 
cannabinoids in cancer therapies. However, they also underlined the need for additional 
preclinical and clinical studies aimed at optimizing the use of cannabinoids (see Box 3).  
 
In line with this idea and based on the observations described in the previous 
section showing that the combination of THC, CBD and TMZ enhances the anticancer 
activity of each of these antineoplasic agents (Scott et al, 2014; Torres et al, 2011), a 
Phase 1/2 clinical study in recurrent GBM patients is being conducted to assess the 
safety and effectiveness of the administration of the cannabinoid-based medicine 
Sativex concomitantly with TMZ (NCT01812603 and NCT01812616). A high 
percentage of newly diagnosed GBM present innate resistance to TMZ (Mrugala, 2013). 
This resistance has been related with several molecular alterations, including the 
methylation of the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter (Hegi et 
al, 2005). Preclinical data support that the combination of cannabinoids and TMZ exerts 
a strong anticancer action even when MGMT is over-expressed (Torres et al, 2011) 
thereby suggesting that this type of therapy might potentially help to improve the 
overall response to TMZ treatment in glioblastoma  
Synthetic cannabinoids are also being evaluated in clinical studies. For example, 
dexanabinol, [an enantiomer HU-210 (a mixed CB1 /CB2 cannabinoid receptor agonist) 
which does not bind with significant affinity to cannabinoid receptors but instead acts a 
NMDA receptor antagonist (Feigenbaum et al, 1989)], is currently undergoing Phase 1 
trials for the treatment of brain cancer and advanced solid tumors (NCT01489826). 
 
7. Conclusions and future directions  
Despite the existence of conflicting reports relative to the role of the endocannabinoid 
system in cancer generation and progression and several reports pointing to a possible 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

16 
tumour-promoting immunosuppressive role of cannabinoids (Cudaback et al, 2010; 
Hart et al, 2004; McKallip et al, 2005; Zhu et al, 2000) a large body of scientific 
evidences strongly support THC and other cannabinoid agonists exert anticancer actions 
in preclinical models of cancer (including immunocompetent mice) through a well-
established mechanism of action. There is also a good evidence of that cannabinoids 
enhance the anticancer activity of TMZ and ALK inhibitors in animal models of glioma. 
These observations provide preclinical proof-of-concept that cannabinoids could 
enhance the efficacy of classical cytotoxic drugs at least in glioblastoma (Figure 1). 
However, additional studies are required to analyze the efficacy of these drug 
combinations in other cancer types as well as to identify additional cannabinoid-based 
drug combinations that could be useful for the treatment of glioma or other types of 
cancer. Likewise, further research is required to identify the precise molecular cross-talk 
mechanisms that become activated upon exposure of cancer cells to cannabinoids in 
combination with different chemotherapeutic agents. 
 
Regarding patient stratification, one important step forward would be to identify 
which patients are potentially responsive to cannabinoid treatment. To this aim, it would 
be desirable that future clinical trials aimed at analyzing the anticancer activity of 
cannabinoid-based medicines would include translational studies in which specific 
biomarkers associated to a better or worse response to cannabinoid treatment could be 
identified. 
In conclusion there exist solid scientific evidences supporting that cannabinoids 
exhibit a remarkable anticancer activity in preclinical models of cancer. Since these 
agents also show an acceptable safety profile, clinical studies aimed at testing them as 
single agents or in combinational therapies are urgently needed. Results from these

studies are essential to clarify whether cannabinoids (and specifically cannabinoid-
based medicines) could be helpful in the fight of cancer.

Box 1. Mechanism of cannabinoid receptor-mediated cancer cell death: some 
important unanswered questions  
Research performed in the last decade has permitted a better understanding of the 
intracellular signalling mechanisms underlying cannabinoid anticancer action. However, 
a number of important observations remain to be clarified. For example: 
- 
Unlike the cell death-promoting action of cannabinoids on cancer cells, the viability 
of normal (non-transformed) cells is unaffected or - under certain conditions - even 
enhanced by cannabinoid challenge (Carracedo et al, 2006b; Galve-Roperh et al, 
2008; Galve-Roperh et al, 2000; Gomez del Pulgar et al, 2002; Salazar et al, 2009). 
For example, THC treatment of astrocytes (a cell type that expresses functional CB1 
receptors) does not trigger the activation of ER stress, the up-regulation of the p8 
pathway, the inhibition of the AKT–mTORC1 axis or the stimulation of autophagy 
and apoptosis, even when concentrations of THC higher than those that promote 
glioma cell death are used (Carracedo et al, 2006b; Salazar et al, 2009). Similar 
results were obtained with primary embryonic fibroblasts (Carracedo et al, 2006b; 
Salazar et al, 2009) and other types of non-transformed cells expressing functional 
cannabinoid receptors when compared with their transformed counterparts 
(Blazquez et al, 2006; Caffarel et al, 2006; Casanova et al, 2003; Chan et al, 1996). 
Thus, stimulation of cannabinoid receptors seems to be coupled to the activation of 
different signalling mechanisms in transformed and non-transformed cells. The 
precise molecular reasons responsible for this differences remain as an one of the 
unanswered questions within the cannabinoid field that still require much further 
research in order to be clarified, 
- 
Another puzzling observation is that pharmacological inhibition of either CB1 or 
CB2 receptors prevents THC-induced cell death at least certain cancer cells (for 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
19 
example glioma cells) (Galve-Roperh et al, 2000; Lorente et al, 2011), whereas in, 
hepatic (Vara et al, 2011), pancreatic (Carracedo et al, 2006a) or breast (Caffarel et 
al, 2006) carcinoma cells, antagonists of CB2 but not of CB1 receptors inhibit 
cannabinoid anticancer actions.  
- 
Certain cannabinoid receptor agonists trigger cancer cell death more efficiently than 
others exhibiting even higher affinity for CB receptors. Thus, THC promotes cancer 
cell death (an effect that can be blocked using of CB receptors antagonists) at lower 
concentrations than WIN-55,212-2 [a cannabinoid receptor agonist which exhibits 
in binding assays higher affinity than THC for CB1 and CB2 receptors (Pertwee et 
al, 2010)]. 
Recent observations suggest that CB2 and GPR55 receptors can from heteromers – and 
that this structures can modify the antitumoral activity of cannabinoids (Moreno et al, 
2014). Whether some of the intriguing effects described above can be explained by the 
ability of cannabinod receptors to oligomerize with other G protein-coupled receptors, 
locate in precise domains in the plasma membrane (or in organelles) or couple to 
specific G proteins or other signalling molecules are interesting possibilities that require 
much further research. 
 
Box 2. Different pharmacological approaches to target cancer cells with 
cannabinoids  
Cannabinoid agonists or enhancers of endocannabinoid tone? 
Administration of endocannabinoids or inhibitors of endocannabinoid-degrading 
enzymes has been shown to reduce the growth of different types of tumour xenografts 
(Bifulco et al, 2001; Ligresti et al, 2003) and, therefore, could be a reasonable strategy 
for targeting cannabinoid receptors for anticancer purposes. However, as discussed in 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
20 
Box 1, the role of the endocannabinoid system, including the endocannabinoid-
degrading enzymes, in the control of tumour generation and progression is not well 
understood. Since enhancing endocannabinoid tone only has mild anti-tumour effects in 
mice and since no inhibitor of endocannabinoid degradation has been approved as yet 
for use in humans, clinical studies aimed at analysing the efficacy of cannabinoids as 
anti-tumour agents should be based on the use of plant-derived or synthetic agonists of 
cannabinoid receptors rather than on endocannabinoids or inhibitors of endocannabinoid 
degradation. 
 
Cannabis extracts or pure cannabinoids? 
The long-known therapeutic properties of Cannabis sativa – including amelioration of 
symptoms associated with cancer and its chemotherapy - have led to the authorization 
of the medical use of this plant and its extracts in several countries. As mentioned in the 
text, some of the other cannabinoids present in marijuana may contribute to the 
attenuation of THC psychoactive-side effects (Pertwee, 2009) However, pure drugs are 
more prone to standardization than complex molecular cocktails. Thus, it would be ideal 
that studies aimed at investigating the anticancer actions of cannabinoids in patients 
were performed comparatively with both pure substances and cannabis extracts 
containing controlled amounts of THC, CBD and other cannabinoids. 
 
Which routes of cannabinoid administration? 
Smoking is the most frequent route of administration of self-medicated and recreational 
marijuana. Thus, THC and other cannabinoids derived from the plant are rapidly 
absorbed by inhalation. However, smoking is an unattractive clinical option. In the first 
clinical trial in which a cannabinoid were assayed as an anti-caner agents, THC was 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
21 
administered locally (intracranial delivery to GBM patients) (Guzman et al, 2006). 
Nevertheless, this route of administration has many obvious limitations. Currently-
available cannabis-based medicines are administered as capsules or using an oro-
mucosal spray (Pertwee, 2009). Preclinical animal models have yielded data indicating 
that systemic (oral or intraperitoneal) administration of cannabinoids effectively reduces 
tumour growth (author’s unpublished observations). Thus, it seems reasonable that 
future clinical studies directed at determining the efficacy of cannabinoids as anti-caner 
agents use oral or oro-mucosal routes of administration.

Figure 1. Possible strategies aimed at optimizing cannabinoid-based therapies 
against gliomas 
Resistance of glioma cells to cannabinoid-induced cell death relies, at least in part, on 
the enhanced expression of the growth factor midkine (MDK) and the subsequent 
activation of the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK). Enhanced 
expression of amphiregulin (AREG, an heparin-bound ligand of the EGFR) can 
promote resistance to THC antitumour action via ERK stimulation. Combination of 
THC with pharmacological inhibitors of ALK (or genetic inhibition of MDK) enhances 
cannabinoid action in resistant tumours. Combinations of cannabinoids with classical 
chemotherapeutic drugs such as the alkylating agent temozolomide [TMZ; the 
benchmark agent for the management of glioblastoma(Lonardi et al, 2005; Stupp et al, 
2005)] produce a strong anticancer action in animal models. Other strategies to enhance 
cannabinoid anticancer action could be combining cannabinoids with endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress and/or autophagy inducers or with inhibitors of the AKT–
mechanistic target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1) axis. Abs: antibodies; EGFR: epidermal 
growth factor receptor; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GF: growth factors; 
RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; TRIB3: tribbles 3; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth 
factor.

Highlights 
 
- The endocannabinoid system may play a dual role on the regulation of tumor 
generation and progression 
 
- Administration of THC and other cannabinoids exert anticancer actions in animal 
models of cancer 
 
- THC and other cannabinoid receptor-ligands induce cancer cell death and inhibit 
tumor angiogenesis  
 
- Cannabinoids enhance the anticancer activity of other antineoplastic agents in animal 
models of cancer 
 
- Cannabinoids are currently being tested as anticancer agents in phase I/II clinical 
studies
