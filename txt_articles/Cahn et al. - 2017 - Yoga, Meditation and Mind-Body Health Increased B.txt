Thirty-eight individuals (mean age: 34.8 years old) participating in a 3-month yoga and
meditation retreat were assessed before and after the intervention for psychometric
measures, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), circadian salivary cortisol levels,
and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Participation in the retreat was found to
be associated with decreases in self-reported anxiety and depression as well as
increases in mindfulness. As hypothesized, increases in the plasma levels of BDNF
and increases in the magnitude of the cortisol awakening response (CAR) were also
observed. The normalized change in BDNF levels was inversely correlated with BSI-18
anxiety scores at both the pre-retreat (r = 0.40, p < 0.05) and post-retreat (r = 0.52,
p < 0.005) such that those with greater anxiety scores tended to exhibit smaller pre-
to post-retreat increases in plasma BDNF levels. In line with a hypothesized decrease
in inflammatory processes resulting from the yoga and meditation practices, we found
that the plasma level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 was increased and
the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-12 was reduced after the retreat. Contrary
to our initial hypotheses, plasma levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were increased after the retreat. Given
evidence from previous studies of the positive effects of meditative practices on mental
fitness, autonomic homeostasis and inflammatory status, we hypothesize that these
findings are related to the meditative practices throughout the retreat; however, some
of the observed changes may also be related to other aspects of the retreat such as
physical exercise-related components of the yoga practice and diet. We hypothesize
that the patterns of change observed here reflect mind-body integration and well-being.

Increased BDNF after Meditation Retreat
The increased BDNF levels observed is a potential mediator between meditative
practices and brain health, the increased CAR is likely a reflection of increased dynamic
physiological arousal, and the relationship of the dual enhancement of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokine changes to healthy immunologic functioning is discussed.
Keywords: yoga, meditation, BDNF, cortisol, inflammatory markers, inflammation, stress
INTRODUCTION
Decades of research have linked meditation-based practices to
positive psychological and health outcomes in both clinical
and nonclinical populations (Grossman et al., 2004; Cahn
and Polich, 2006; Rubia, 2009; Chiesa and Serretti, 2010;
Keng et al., 2011; Davidson and McEwen, 2012). More
recently, researchers have sought to understand the biological
mechanisms mediating subjective improvements in well-being,
including physiological, neuroendocrine, immune and genomic
changes. Increasing evidence points towards the possibility
that sustained engagement with meditative practices has both
salubrious psychological and neurophysiological benefits (Cahn
and Polich, 2006; Dahl et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015; Luders and
Cherbuin, 2016) and positively enhances biological functioning
through both hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) effects and
the regulation of inflammatory processes (Bower and Irwin,
2015).
Brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(BDNF)
is
a
neuroregulatory modulator that has received a paucity of
attention in meditation research to date. BDNF is a key
neurotrophin that promotes development, survival and plasticity
of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Huang
and Reichardt, 2001; Binder and Scharfman, 2004). This potent
neuromodulator is most active in brain areas that play pivotal
roles in learning, memory and higher cognition such as the
hippocampus and cortex. Likely related to its ability to cross
the blood-brain barrier, peripheral serum levels of BDNF are
correlated with cerebrospinal fluid levels (Pan et al., 1998).
In addition, BDNF is involved in the complex regulation of
many diverse aspects of physiology such as inflammation,
immunity, mood regulation, stress response and metabolism
(Papathanassoglou et al., 2015). Decreased BDNF levels have
been associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders
including anxiety, depression and Alzheimer’s disease (Phillips
et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2006; Bocchio-Chiavetto et al., 2010),
as well as emotional exhaustion and burnout (Onen Sertoz
et al., 2008). We assessed BDNF levels in this study of the
psychoneuroimmunologic effects of a sustained yoga and
meditation retreat in order to investigate the possibility that
BDNF may play a key signaling role in the promotion of stress
resilience and integrated mind-body wellness.
The HPA axis is an important neuroendocrine system
whose activation underlies the stress response (de Kloet et al.,
2005). Accumulating evidence links excessive adrenocortical
activity and elevated basal cortisol levels to the progression
of psychiatric and other medical illness (Brown et al., 2004;
de Kloet et al., 2005; Zannas et al., 2015). Cortisol, a
glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal glands in response to
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) released from anterior
pituitary gland, is a reliable marker of HPA activity and
follows a robust circadian rhythm, which peaks 30 min after
awakening (termed the ‘‘Cortisol Awakening Response’’—CAR)
and gradually declines throughout the day (Akerstedt and Levi,
1978; Wüst et al., 2000). Thus, while basal cortisol levels,
typically measured in the late afternoon or evening, are a reliable
measure of the relative activation of the sympathetic nervous
system, there is also an important and separate relationship
between the homeostatic fitness of the autonomic nervous
system and robust circadian variations in cortisol levels, with
sympathetic hyperactivity demonstrating a tendency to reduce
the circadian variability of cortisol levels (Chida and Steptoe,
2009).
Another important and related biological mediator of health
and wellness is the inflammatory pathway. Research over the
past 20 years has shown that pro-inflammatory bodily states
are associated with a propensity towards mental disorders
such as depression and anxiety (Miller et al., 2009; Slavich
and Irwin, 2014; Furtado and Katzman, 2015; Strawbridge
et al., 2015) as well as an array of chronic medical illnesses
(Aggarwal et al., 2006; Swardfager et al., 2010). Generally,
decreases in inflammatory pathway activation during periods
without active infection are associated with better physical
and mental well-being (Elenkov et al., 2005); however, acute
inflammatory responses are also adaptive, so the general decrease
of
pro-inflammatory
(and
increase
in
anti-inflammatory)
immune mediators is not always a clear marker of health and
wellness, and instead a healthy homeostatic balance between
pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling is most adaptive (Black,
2002).
Chronic inflammatory states can be triggered through
psychosocial stress (Steptoe et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2009;
Irwin and Cole, 2011), and psychosomatic interventions like
meditative practices that invoke stress-reduction mechanisms
and psychophysiological self-regulation have demonstrated
anti-inflammatory
benefits
(Bower
and
Irwin,
2015).
Inflammatory states can be measured through circulating
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ),
Interleukin-1β
(IL-1β),
Interleukin-6
(IL-6),
Interleukin-8
(IL-8), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), and Tumor Necrosis Factor
(TNF-α) in addition to anti-inflammatory cytokines such
as Interleukin-10 (IL-10). It is important to note that these
cytokines are involved in a complicated and multifactorial
regulation towards the end of providing optimal support to
effectively fighting off molecular ‘‘other’’ targets and microbes
under the surveillance of healthy immune functioning while

also not promoting inflammation and inadvertent attack of
‘‘self’’ targets. Indeed some of the assayed cytokines have both
pro- and anti-inflammatory potential (IL-6) and upregulation
of others supports vigorous immunological defense of viruses
and are known to be inhibited by stress (IFN-γ). For example
although IL-6 is associated with pro-inflammatory pathways
when stimulated through psychological stress, fever, or the
acute phase response, IL-6 is also a myokine known to have
anti-inflammatory effects when stimulated through exercise
(Barton, 1997; Tilg et al., 1997; Opal and DePalo, 2000).
Given accumulating evidence that yoga and meditative
practices modulate inflammatory and HPA activity (Jevning
et al., 1978; Brown and Gerbarg, 2005; Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
2010; Bower and Irwin, 2015) and the possibility that yoga and
meditative practices may positively impact BDNF levels as a
mechanism towards salubrious neurophysiological functioning,
we sought to investigate the effects of yoga and meditation
on BDNF as well as the activity of the HPA axis and
inflammatory markers. Participants were assessed before and
after an intensive yoga and meditation retreat. The mind-body
practices in this Isha Yoga retreat were directed by the leader
of this contemporary Yogic tradition. The yogic practices
incorporated physical postures, controlled breathing practices,
and seated meditations which include focusing on mantra
repetition, breath, emptiness or ‘‘no thought’’ and bodily
sensation.
A subset of participants within a large 200 participant
3-month Isha yoga retreat volunteered to donate blood
and saliva samples before and after the retreat. Here, we
report the effects of the retreat on BDNF, salivary cortisol,
inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ,
and TNF-α), IL-10, and psychological variables which included
mindfulness, absorption, depression, anxiety and physical
complaints. Finally, we investigated the relationship between
psychological improvements and biological changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Women and men participants were tested at the beginning and
at the end of a 3-month retreat that occurred at the Isha retreat
center in the southern US. A subset of 98 participants (mean
age: 34.8 years old) agreed to participate in the acquisition of
blood and salivary markers and are reported upon here. Due
to limited funding, only a subset of participants’ samples was
analyzed—38 of the participant ID’s were chosen randomly with
the only precondition that half be male (n = 19) and half female
(n = 19). Of these 38, five participant’s plasma data were not used
due to the likelihood of acute illness (e.g., flu) based on highly
elevated intake (pre-retreat sample) IL-6 levels >8 pg/ml. Seven
participant’s saliva data were not used due to extreme outliers
of one or more of the six samples collected. An overlapping
total of N = 26 subjects had usable pre- and post-blood and
salivary samples. This study was carried out in accordance with
the recommendations of Quorum Independent Review Board
with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave

and post saliva and blood samples as well as psychometric
questionnaires as well as their option to discontinue at any
time.
Participant Yoga and Meditation
Background
Prior
to
the
retreat,
many
participants
maintained
a
frequent yoga and meditation practice, including Shoonya
meditation (sitting practice focused on a state of ‘‘non-doing’’),
Samyama meditation (sitting practice with breath-focused
open awareness) as well as diverse Hatha yoga (mindful
movement/stretching) and pranayama (focused breath control)
practices. The frequency of such practice prior to beginning
the retreat was collected prior to the retreat. As a group,
participants reported an average of about 2 h (M = 127.5 min,
SD = 41.22 min) daily practice, and an average of about
4.5 years (M = 4.54 years, SD = 3.26 years) of regular yoga
and meditation practice; see Demographics (Table 1) for
details.
Description of the Retreat Intervention
The 3-month residential retreat involved daily meditation
and yoga practices and was accompanied by a vegetarian
diet and a full daily schedule; participants did not engage
in their normal work activities, but did work on projects
around the retreat center. For the first 6 weeks of the retreat
all participants practiced ‘‘Samyama,’’ a breath-focused open
awareness meditation practice for 30–50 min and ‘‘Shoonya,’’
a conscious non-doing/‘‘no thought’’ meditation practice for
30 min daily. They also practiced specific practices involving
seated yoga postures some of which incorporated bodily
movements, and a focus on mantra and specific bodily sensations
(called kriyas) for about 1–2 h daily. For the last 6 weeks in place
of Samyama, Shoonya and kriya practices, participants practiced
a form of meditation referred to as Linga sanchalana, which
is a focused attention meditation practice, for approximately
1 h twice daily. Finally, in addition to seated meditation
practices, participants also practiced Hatha yoga ∼1–2 h daily
and chanting ∼1 h daily. In sum, participants practiced
approximately 2 h of sitting meditation practices, 1–2 h of
yoga practice with a meditative component and 1 h of chanting
daily.

Increased BDNF after Meditation Retreat
Assessment Schedule
During the first week of the retreat, participants reported
pre-retreat (time 1; T1) psychometric measures and gave
pre-retreat salivary and blood samples. During the last week
they reported post-retreat (time 2; T2) psychometric measures
and gave post-retreat salivary and blood samples. Specifically,
they gave a morning fasting blood sample on retreat day 3,
and then again gave a morning fasting blood sample on
retreat day 87. On these same days, participants filled out
pre-retreat psychometric questionnaires (day 3) and post-retreat
psychometric questionnaires (day 87). They also produced
six salivary samples at specific time points as described below
on retreat day 4, and then again gave six salivary samples at the
same time points during the last week of the retreat on retreat
day 88.
Psychometric Scales
Psychometric questionnaires included the Brief Symptom
Inventory-18
(BSI-18;
Derogatis,
2000),
the
Freiburg
Mindfulness Inventory (Walach et al., 2006), and the Tellegen
Absorption Scale (Tellegen and Atkinson, 1974).
Salivary Cortisol
Diurnal output of cortisol was assessed by having subjects collect
saliva as they went about a day of normal retreat activities within
the first week of the retreat—day 3—and once again during
the last week of the retreat—day 87. To facilitate the collection
process, we asked participants to collect the first sample
immediately upon awakening (4:45 AM), and then throughout
the day at the following time points: 30 min post-awakening
(5:15 AM), 9:15 AM during the break in between yoga practices
and meditation, 12:30 PM just before lunch, 5:10 PM during
a break, and lastly at 8:30 PM after meditation, just prior to
bed. Saliva of each participant was collected in their mouth and
then passively dropped into a Salimetrics saliva collection tube
(Carlsbad, CA, USA). The tubes from T1 at the beginning of
the retreat were then placed in a freezer at −20◦C. The same
procedure was followed at T2 during the last week of the retreat.
Two days after the collection of the T1 and T2 saliva samples, the
tubes from all subjects were placed on dry ice and sent to the
UC San Diego Clinical Research Biomarker Laboratory. Upon
arrival to the lab, all saliva samples, were immediately stored at
−80◦C and saliva cortisol levels were determined by commercial
ELISA (Salimetrics, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Intra- and inter-assay
coefficients were <8%.
BDNF and Inflammatory Biomarkers
BDNF and inflammatory biomarker levels were assessed in
plasma by obtaining EDTA blood from participants early
in the morning after awakening and prior to breakfast, on
day 4 (T1) of the 90-day program and again on day 88
(T2) of the 90-day program. For both T1 and T2 samples
participants were instructed not to engage in any exercise
prior to the blood sample acquisition in the morning. The
blood was drawn in 10 cc EDTA (purple top) tubes and the
tubes were placed on ice for up to 30 min then spun at
400× g for 15 min at 4◦C. The supernatant was then aspirated
and placed into labeled microcentrifuge tubes (3 cc each) on
dry ice immediately. Both T1 and T2 samples were kept on
dry ice in labeled trays overnight and sent the next day by
overnight delivery to the UC San Diego Clinical Research
Biomarker Laboratory for quantitation. Upon arrival to the lab,
samples were immediately stored at −80◦C. T1 and T2 samples
were subjected to analysis simultaneously and in parallel,
approximately 2 months after T2 data collection. Plasma levels
of BDNF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12
were all determined by commercial ELISA kits (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients
were <5%.
Statistical Analysis
For the salivary cortisol, a 2 × 6 Repeated measures ANOVA
was conducted with factors being (pre- vs. post-retreat) × (6 time
points in the day). Greenhouse-Geisser corrections for multiple
comparisons were run and Tukey post hoc analysis to analyze any
significant interactions. For the plasma BDNF and inflammatory
biomarker analysis, the plasma values were found to vary
significantly from normal distribution, thus values were natural
log-transformed to produce more normal distributions. Values
greater than three standard deviations from the mean were
removed, with the # participants removed ranging from one to
three subjects for each of the biomarkers analyzed. For each
biomarker, a paired t-test for dependent samples was run
on the natural log transformed T1 (pre-retreat) and T2
(post-retreat) plasma levels of the biomarkers to assess for
significant differences across time from pre- to post-retreat.
To assess effects of gender, age, BMI, and change in BMI
an ANOVA was also run on the T1 vs. T2 biomarker levels
with these demographic categorical/continuous predictors. A
limited number of hypothesized correlations between changes
in inflammatory biomarkers, BDNF, and cortisol levels and
symptoms of psychological distress as measured by the Brief
Symptom Inventory were assessed for significance using basic
linear correlation procedures. All statistical analyses were run in
Statistica 8.0 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA).
RESULTS
Paired t-test analysis of psychometric data (see Table 2)
showed that these healthy normal volunteers scored quite low
on the BSI-18 questionnaire (mean scores pre-retreat on the
0–72 scale = 10.5 and post-retreat = 4.1). Nonetheless, there
were clearly significant improvements in the Brief Symptom
Inventory-18 scores, including the total score (t(33) = 4.66,
p < 0.0001) as well as each of the subscores which included
depressive (t(33) = 2.84, p < 0.01), anxious (t(33) = 4.22,
p < 0.0001), and somatic (t(33) = 4.66, p < 0.0001) symptoms. In
addition, there was an increase in mindfulness as assessed by the
Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (t(33) = 4.42, p < 0.0001), and
no change on absorption as measures by the Tellegen Absorption
Scale (p = 0.4).
Biological markers analyzed included weight as well as
inflammatory biomarkers, BDNF and salivary cortisol. As shown
in Table 3, results of paired t-tests comparing pre-retreat

data to post-retreat data revealed that while the group was
on average at a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) from the
outset, small but significant reductions were observed in
BMI (t(35) = 4.37, p < 0.0001). In regards to the plasma
biomarker data, paired t-tests on the normalized data, after
removing extreme outliers, indicated increases in BDNF
(t(31) = −4.03, p < 0.001), IFN-γ (t(31) = −2.62, p < 0.05),
TNF-α (t(30) = −6.37, p < 0.000001), IL-1β (t(31) = −2.39,
p < 0.05), IL-6 (t(30) = −5.13, p < 0.0001), IL-8 (t(30) = −3.30,
p < 0.01), and IL-10 (t(29) = −4.65, p < 0.0001). In contrast,
there was a decrease in the level of IL-12 (t(31) = 2.37,
p < 0.05).
A calculation of the area under the curve of the salivary
cortisol concentration across the day was done and a paired
t-test of this data indicated no difference between pre and post
retreat samples (p = 0.3). A repeated measures 2 × 6 ANOVA
conducted on the salivary cortisol measures with factors ‘‘pre
vs. post retreat’’ and ‘‘time of day’’ yielded no main effect of
pre vs. post retreat (p = 0.50) but a highly significant main
effect time of day (F(5,150) = 89.8, p < 0.0000001), indicating
the pronounced circadian variation of cortisol levels across the
day. There was also a significant interaction between pre vs. post
retreat and time of day (F(5,150) = 3.31, p < 0.01). Post hoc analysis
of this significant interaction indicated that at T2, cortisol levels
30 min post-awakening (peak cortisol level associated with the
CAR) was significantly higher in the post-retreat compared to
the pre-retreat samples (p < 0.01; see Figure 1). At all other time
points throughout the day from awakening to bed time, there was
no significant difference in the pre vs. post retreat cortisol levels
(all p > 0.9).
Including BMI, change in BMI, age and gender as covariates
in the ANOVA of the salivary cortisol data (gender as
categorical predictor, age and BMI characteristics as continuous
predictors), revealed no significant interaction between these
demographic characteristics and the significant effect on the
salivary CAR. There was, however, a significant main effect
of gender on salivary cortisol levels such that women showed
higher overall cortisol levels across the day than men (p = 0.05).
In addition, these demographic characteristics were entered
as predictors into the ANOVA analyses of the effects on the
plasma inflammatory biomarkers and BDNF levels. Here we
found significant interactions only between gender and three of
the dependent variables: BDNF, IFN-γ and IL-10. For BDNF
there was a main effect of gender such that women were
found to demonstrate higher levels of plasma BDNF than men
(F(1,30) = 6.88, p < 0.05) and there was a nearly significant
gender × pre-post interaction (p = 0.06) indicating a tendency
for women to show greater relative increases in BDNF over the
course of the retreat. For IFN-γ a significant gender × pre-post
interaction was obtained (F(1,30) = 4.33, p < 0.05) and post
hoc analysis indicated that the increases in IFN-γ levels were
significant for women (p < 0.01) but not men (p = 1). For
IL-10 a significant gender × pre-post interaction was obtained
(F(1,28) = 4.90, p < 0.05) and post hoc analysis indicated that the
increases in IL-10 levels were significant for women (p < 0.001)
but not men (p = 0.31). There was no significant interaction
between participant age, gender, or BMI and change in the other
biomarker levels.

(r = 0.52, p < 0.005) such that those with greater anxiety

scores tended to evidence a smaller pre- to post-retreat increase
in plasma BDNF levels. No such correlations were observed
between other BSI-18 measures or mindfulness scores and
BDNF levels and no correlations were obtained between these
psychometric measures and CAR findings. A relationship was
found between the magnitude of the pre-retreat CAR and the
resultant change in BDNF levels, however this relationship
was found to be driven by one particular outlier so this
relationship was taken to be non-significant. Lastly, in order
to assess the unexpected effect demonstrating increases in
both the prototypical anti-inflammatory marker IL-10 and
the range of pro-inflammatory markers, correlations were
run between IL-10 levels and the other interleukins. We
found a positive correlation between the change in IL-10
levels and the change in IL-12 levels from pre- to post-retreat,
signifying that the participants who demonstrated greater
increases in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels tended to also

levels.
DISCUSSION
The results of this 3-month pre-post study indicate that
participation in this yoga and meditation retreat was associated
with alterations in psychological functioning, neurotrophic
pathways, HPA axis activity, and inflammatory pathway
signaling suggesting enhanced stress resilience and well-being.
As a group, participants showed significant improvements
in
depression,
anxiety,
somatic
complaints,
increases
in
mindfulness scores, and a small but significant decrease in
BMI. A significant 3-fold increase in BDNF plasma level was
observed and the change in BDNF plasma levels from pre-retreat
to post-retreat was inversely correlated with participants’
self-reported anxiety levels on the BSI-18, suggesting that this
increase in BDNF may be related to psychological markers of
wellness. In addition, a significant increase in the CAR was
observed from pre- to post-retreat, suggesting improvements
in the dynamic rhythmicity of adrenocortical activity, a
marker of stress resilience. Lastly, significant increases in
both pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers were observed
in an unexpected pattern not seen in previous studies to our
knowledge. Overall we hypothesize that the observed pattern
of changes provides evidence for enhanced fitness as assessed
along the spectrum of levels of psychoneuroendocrine and
immunologic assessment.
A highly significant 3-fold increase in plasma BDNF level was
observed comparing pre- to post-retreat assessment data. BDNF
is a well-described neurotrophic factor of the neurotrophin
gene family that acts on neurons of the central and peripheral
nervous system, supports the survival of existing neurons, and
encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and
synapses primarily through its action at the TrkB receptor of
neurons (Acheson et al., 1995; Huang and Reichardt, 2001).

Increased BDNF after Meditation Retreat
BDNF signaling has been implicated as a mediator of the positive
impact of both physical exercise and cognitive engagement on
brain fitness and enhanced neurogenesis, learning, and memory
(Huang et al., 2014) as well as anti-depressant effects (Russo-
Neustadt et al., 2000; Warner-Schmidt and Duman, 2006; Sen
et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the increase in circulating
levels of BDNF observed here is likely related to improvements
in brain fitness and psychological well-being brought about
by participation in the yoga and meditation retreat although
ruling out a possible contribution from the limited physical
exercise components (hatha yoga practices) of the retreat is not
possible.
BDNF has been relatively unexplored in work exploring
the impact of meditative practices on biology to date, but one
previous study showed that meditative yoga practice was related
to increases in BDNF as well as heart rate variability (Pal
et al., 2014). A second recent study demonstrated a two-fold
increase in BDNF when comparing pre- to post-values for a
12-week yoga and meditation lifestyle intervention involving
approximately 90 min of practice daily (Tolahunase et al.,
2017). In addition, Naveen et al. (2013) demonstrated that
both yoga and antidepressant interventions led to increased
levels of BDNF in patients with a history of depression. In
this study, those patients receiving only yoga had greater
improvements in depression, and there was a significant
positive correlation between improvements in depression and
increases in BDNF specifically in the yoga-only group suggesting
that BDNF may play a key role in the antidepressant
effects of yogic practice. In contrast, one previous RCT of
a hatha yoga intervention in patients with schizophrenia
found no changes in BDNF or psychometric measures of
resilience levels (Ikai et al., 2014), possibly indicating that
such interventions are not as efficacious for individuals
with severe psychotic illness, or at least might need to be
further adjusted in order to better support wellness in this
population.
In the current study, we found that those scoring higher on
the BSI anxiety scale (both at pre- and post-testing) tended to
demonstrate a less robust increase in BDNF levels, consistent
with the notion that BDNF levels were indeed related to
psychological wellness. This fits with evidence from others
suggesting that BDNF is negatively correlated with depression
(Sen et al., 2008; Polyakova et al., 2015) as well as emotional
exhaustion and depersonalization (Onen Sertoz et al., 2008) and
increases in association with successful treatment of depression
(Polyakova et al., 2015).
Extensive
previous
work
has
demonstrated
increased
circulating BDNF levels due to both acute and chronic aerobic
exercise regimes (Brunelli et al., 2012; Dinoff et al., 2016).
Although physical exercise levels were not specifically controlled
for in this study, they were not a prominent component of the
retreat and most participants reported being engaged in an
approximately equivalent Hatha yoga/exercise routine prior
to the retreat. Given that there was some decrease in BMI for
participants, we ran a correlation analysis between change in
BMI and change in BDNF to explore whether potential exercise-
related decreases in body weight might be correlated with BDNF
changes and found a complete lack of association with a r value
of ∼0.05.
There are several alternative mechanistic explanations for the
increase in BDNF levels observed in this study involving the
impact of the meditative components of the yoga and meditation
practices. First, given the significant and growing evidence
for the highly active attentional engagement and associated
robust modulations of frontal brain circuitry supporting the
act of meditative practice (Tang and Posner, 2009; Brewer
et al., 2011; Lutz et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015), it is quite
possible that the meditative components of this intensive
retreat engaged neuroplastic brain mechanisms in a manner
analogous to intensive learning regimes which have been
shown to promote neuroplasticity partly through increase in
BDNF signaling (Korol et al., 2013; Novkovic et al., 2015;
Aarse et al., 2016). A second possible mechanism involves the
effects of these practices on the autonomic nervous system.
Specifically, deep breathing, yoga and meditation practices have
been found to increase vagal tone (Brown and Gerbarg, 2005;
Khattab et al., 2007) which could be a potential mediating
mechanism in the increased BDNF levels. Parasympathetic
activation through the vagus nerve has been shown to increase
BDNF levels as well as downstream activation of the BDNF
receptor TrkB (Follesa et al., 2007; Furmaga et al., 2012).
Lastly, given the clear relationship between increased stress
and decreases in BDNF signaling (Duman and Monteggia,
2006; Schmidt and Duman, 2007), other central mechanisms
related to the impact of meditative practice on decreasing
stressful responding to daily life stressors may play an
important role in the impact of yoga and meditation on BDNF
levels.
Related to the increase in BDNF levels observed here, the
hippocampus is an active site of neuroplasticity and contains
in the dentate gyrus one of two primary zones of neurogenesis
throughout the adult human lifespan. Physical exercise and
environment learning have been clearly demonstrated to
exert
hippocampal
plasticity
through
upregulating
BDNF
signaling (Vivar et al., 2013; Voss et al., 2013). If the BDNF
increases observed here are indeed largely related to the
meditative practice component of the retreat, such meditation-
related BDNF signaling may be a partial explanation for
the repeated findings of increased hippocampal volumes due
to meditative practice in both short and long term studies
(Hölzel et al., 2008, 2011; Luders et al., 2009; Gotink et al.,
2016).
Another possible contributor to the effects observed here
on BDNF (and other assessed biomarker) levels is diet, which
has a profound impact on the gut microbiota community and
resultant microbiome signaling processes within the brain and
body. Diet was controlled during the retreat in that participants
were fed high-quality vegetarian food prepared by the staff.
Studies in mice have demonstrated associations between the gut
microbiota and BDNF in the regulation of brain physiology,
behavior, and memory (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011). Thus, the
enhanced BDNF expression observed in our participants may be
related to a number of mediating mechanisms called into play
by the multi-modal yoga and meditation retreat intervention,
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org
7
June 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 315
 Cahn et al.
Increased BDNF after Meditation Retreat
including attentional and cognitive stimulatory factors brought
about by the specific meditative practices as well as the physical
exercise component, possible regulations in vagal tone and also
diet and other attendant factors to the retreat setting. These
factors include the retreat setting in nature, decreased demands
of everyday working life, new daily rhythms and social/relational
demands called into play by the nature of the retreat setting and
activities.
Lastly, it is important to note that including the covariate
gender into the effects of the yoga-meditation retreat effects on
BDNF revealed an overall gender effect such that BDNF levels
in women in this sample were higher than those in men. There
was also a nearly significant interaction between gender and the
increases in BDNF from pre- to post-retreat such that women
tended to demonstrate more dramatic increases in BDNF levels
than men. Given that previous work demonstrating generally
equivalent plasma BDNF levels in men and women (Lommatzsch
et al., 2005), we take the finding of greater BDNF levels in women
than men of this study to be related to non-random sampling
of the general population. Nonetheless, the near-significance
of the gender × time interaction observed here implies the
possibility that the effects of this intervention might be mediated
through effects on BDNF-related signaling in women more so
than men.
The CAR represents the acute early-morning increase in
cortisol that functions to enhance alertness, physiological
arousal, and preparedness to meet daily demands. The increased
CAR we report here is likely related to increases in morning
wakefulness and stress resilience (Fries et al., 2009; Clow
et al., 2010a,b). These results are consistent with others who
have reported increases in the CAR after mindfulness-based
practices (Matousek et al., 2011). It is also possible that this
intervention improved sleep quality and this, in turn, impacted
a more dynamic and robust CAR. In any case, we did not
find any significant differences in other aspects of the diurnal
or overall cortisol levels from pre- to post-retreat. While some
have reported an overall decrease in daily cortisol secretion
following mindfulness practice (Carlson et al., 2003, 2007; Witek-
Janusek et al., 2008), others have found no change (Robinson
et al., 2003; Galantino et al., 2005; Klatt et al., 2009). Matousek
et al. (2010) reasonably suggest that such discrepancies might
be attributed to methodological differences, such as sample
size and population characteristics. In our case, the healthy
and seasoned meditators participating in this retreat reported
low levels of anxiety and depression symptoms on the BSI-18
from the outset and likely had relatively healthy baseline
cortisol levels, leading to a floor effect with regards to detecting
potential decreases in cortisol output from wellness-promoting
activities. The demonstration of increased CAR in this group
suggests that this measure of dynamic cortisol levels across the
day/night cycle may be a more sensitive marker of increased
physiological stress resilience than absolute cortisol levels in
healthy subjects.
An intriguing link between the effects on BDNF and the
CAR may be hippocampal functional integrity. As mentioned,
increased BDNF levels due to physical exercise has previously
been shown to relate with hippocampal neurogenesis and likely
relate to its positive effects on well-being and depression.
It is reasonable to hypothesize that the increased BDNF
levels secondary to this yoga-meditation retreat may relate
to positive effects on hippocampal functioning although
this was not directly assessed. Interestingly, previous work
has shown that hippocampal functioning also serves as a
promoting factor for the robust functioning of the CAR
(Fries et al., 2009; Clow et al., 2010b). Specifically, clinical
patients with hippocampal damage have been shown to evidence
greatly reduced CAR dynamics (Buchanan et al., 2004) and
positive associations between hippocampal volume and CAR
amplitude have been demonstrated (Pruessner et al., 2007).
Thus, it may be the case that the wellness and resilience-
promoting benefits of yoga and meditation may work through
a mechanism involving BDNF upregulation, hippocampal
flourishing, and a related boost in CAR amplitude. Further
studies aimed at explicating these relationships may reveal
important mechanistic explanations for integrated mind-body
wellness promotion.
Turning attention to the inflammatory markers assayed
here, a statistically significant increase was observed in the
anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels, while a significant decrease in
pro-inflammatory IL-12 was observed, which supported our
hypothesis that the yoga and meditation retreat would impact
the inflammatory pathway by reducing tendencies towards
inflammatory states. We also observed significant increases in
levels of the pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β,
IL-6, and IL-8.
Some of these cytokines, such as IL-6, can induce both
pro- and anti-inflammatory effects thus adding an additional
layer of complexity (Scheller et al., 2011). In addition, pro-
and anti-inflammatory response modulations may be adaptive
depending on the context (i.e., baseline states of over vs.
underactive inflammatory processing, acute vs. prolonged effects,
local vs. systemic responses). Of note, a generally observed
cytokine response to stress and mediated through glucocorticoids
includes a reduction of the T helper 1 cell (Th1)-mediated
production of pro-inflammatory IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-12 and
an activation of T helper 2 cell (Th2)-mediated production of
IL-10. Later effects of stress can include induction of IL-1β,
IL-8 and TNF-α (Elenkov et al., 2005; Calcagni and Elenkov,
2006). Here we found the unusual pattern of increases in
both anti-inflammatory IL-10 in addition to pro-inflammatory
TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 with simultaneous decreases of
IL-12.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine a
broad range of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers in a healthy
population before and after a yoga-meditation intervention, and
suggests that for these individuals, intensive meditation and yoga
practice can elicit increases in both anti-inflammatory IL-10
levels and concomitant increases in pro-inflammatory TNF-α,
IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 levels. This was especially unexpected
given the known effect that the prototypical anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10, produced by Th2 cells, has been shown to
result in the inhibition in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory
cytokines generally (Mosser and Zhang, 2008), including TNFα,
IL-1β, IL-12 and IFNγ (Zheng et al., 1996; Aste-Amezaga et al.,
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org
8
June 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 315
 Cahn et al.
Increased BDNF after Meditation Retreat
1998; Varma et al., 2001). Explaining this unexpected rather
broad increase in both anti- (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory
cytokines (with the exception of IL-12) is not trivial and we
are not confident in an encompassing explanatory rubric but
hypothesize that the pattern may relate to immunologic readiness
as explained below.
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of mind-body
therapies including yoga, meditation and tai-chi revealed small
but not statistically significant decreases in IL-6 and TNF-α
following such interventions (Morgan et al., 2014), and a later
descriptive review of this literature highlighted the inconsistent
nature of the findings with the majority of studies assaying
IL-6 and TNF-α demonstrating null effects (Bower and Irwin,
2015). It is important to note inconsistencies in pro- and
anti-inflammatory outcomes as well as inconsistent results across
studies that have been observed across previous yoga and
meditation-based studies. For example, Pullen et al. (2008)
showed decreases in IL-6, while Creswell et al. (2012) reported
no change in IL-6; Rosenkranz et al. (2013) showed that more
meditation practice was associated with lower TNF-α, while
Black et al. (2013) reported an increase in TNF-α mRNA
expression after yogic meditation; and Witek-Janusek et al.
(2008) reported increases in IFN-γ activity in breast cancer
patients, while Carlson et al. (2003) reported a decrease in
a similar population. These studies tended to differ with
respect to the type of intervention (e.g., Kundalini yoga vs.
MBSR vs. Tai Chi), population (e.g., clinical vs. non-clinical),
setting, design and other methodological factors—lending to
the complexities involved in interpreting cytokine and other
biomarker samples. In addition, unexpected inflammatory
marker expression patterns may be optimally adaptive for
different populations. For example, Carlson et al. (2003) and
Witek-Janusek et al. (2008) both reported decreases in the
anti-inflammatory IL-10 in breast and prostate cancer patients
following MBSR, which might reflect a healthy improvement
given baseline stress-induced immune dysregulation in this
population (Witek-Janusek et al., 2007). Similarly, Yeh et al.
(2009) reported an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine
IL-12 in diabetes patients after Tai chi practice, which was
interpreted as related to an improvement toward metabolic
regulation.
IL-10, as a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine produced
by Th2 cells, has been shown capable of decreasing the
expression of the Th1-produced pro-inflammatory cytokines.
We hypothesize that the increase in IL-10 found here is
related to enhanced stress resilience as it is likely to act
in concert with the observed increases in pro-inflammatory
markers to ensure that inflammatory cascades are not actually
being turned on in these subjects. In support of the notion
that enhanced resilience is conferred through elevated IL-10
levels is the recent finding assessing inflammatory markers in
individuals exposed to urban violence in Brazil. Comparing
those individuals who developed PTSD vs. those that did not
indicated no difference between groups in IL-6 levels but
significantly higher IL-10 levels in the more resilient individuals
exposed to trauma but not experiencing PTSD (Teche et al.,
2017).
In general, the optimal levels of cytokines are dynamic and
related to a fine tuned balance between readiness to engage the
inflammatory response when needed and a restraint on excessive
inflammation or in the extreme auto-inflammatory states. It
is likely that in chronically inflamed body states decreases in
pro-inflammatory markers and increases in anti-inflammatory
markers is adaptive, but the situation is much less clear in
non-inflamed healthy normals. For example, a yoga intervention
in breast cancer survivors reported decreases in IL-6, TNF-α, and
IL-1β (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2010). Breast cancer survivors carry
heavy inflammatory burden and thus the yoga intervention may
have a more significant anti-inflammatory effect in populations
with inflammatory burdens. Similarly, IL-6 and C-reactive
protein were reduced following Hatha yoga intervention in heart
failure patients, which represent another clinical population with
a high baseline inflammatory burden, compared to controls
(Pullen et al., 2008, 2010). In contrast, our participants scored
low on anxiety and depression symptomatology, and when
compared to previous literature in healthy normal populations
(Kleiner et al., 2013; Krishnan et al., 2014) our levels were
decreased in amplitude across the various cytokines obtained,
likely indicating that in this sample there was a reduced baseline
level of inflammatory marker expression.
Of note, surveying the previous literature we were not able
to find previous studies assaying cytokine levels in an equally
intensive long-term yoga-meditation retreat. We propose that in
relatively healthy adults, intense yogic and meditative practices as
assayed in the current study may recruit an integrate brain-body
response leading to increases in both pro- and anti-inflammatory
signaling processes in support of an upregulated vigorous
immunological surveillance system but with concomitant high
expression of the anti-inflammatory ‘‘break’’ that IL-10 may
represent. Further support of this hypothesis is that despite
the known inhibitory effect that IL-10 levels can have on
IL-12 expression, we found increased IL-10 levels tended to
correlate with increased IL-12 levels in our cohort, providing
further indirect support for the hypothesis that an unusual
state of regulatory shifts underlies the effects observed in
this dataset. Moreover, while we did assess many cytokines
involved in inflammatory signaling, these are just the tip of
an iceberg of complicated multifactorial signaling pathways
regulating this important biological function. It is possible
that further studies of a range of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines in normal relatively unstressed subjects undergoing
salubrious mind-body interventions may replicate our findings
of a mixed upregulation of both anti-inflammatory and
pro-inflammatory cytokines in which case new theoretical
models of broad upregulation of these pathways will need to be
formulated.
As with the effect on BDNF described above, another
possible explanation for the post-retreat changes in cytokines
may be attributed to the physical exercise-related effects of
Hatha yoga. For example, acute exercise is known to increase
the expression of both pro-inflammatory IL-1β and TNF-α as
well as anti-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-10 (Northoff et al., 1994;
Ostrowski et al., 1999). Also, relationships between gender and
two of the assayed cytokines were obtained, indicating that in
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org
9
June 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 315
 Cahn et al.
Increased BDNF after Meditation Retreat
this sample the effect of the retreat on increased IFN-γ and IL-10
was driven largely by women in the sample. We were not able to
find evidence for pronounced gender-related differences between
these cytokines in the literature and have no framework for
explaining this gender difference, however it does seem to imply
that there are sex-specific mechanisms at play in the response of
the immune system to yoga-meditation interventions.
There may be a relationship between the effects we
found on BDNF and those with inflammatory markers.
Previous studies have demonstrated both anti-inflammatory
and pro-inflammatory effects of BDNF—for example, BDNF
upregulated IL-10 and transcription factor NF-κB in models of
neuroinflammation investigating the neuroprotective effects of
BDNF (Jiang et al., 2011) but also increased IL-4 and IFN-γ
in in vitro studies of human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (Bayas et al., 2003). Moreover, a large body of evidence
has demonstrated that the negative impact of inflammation
on neurogenesis might be triggered through pro-inflammatory
cytokine-induced reductions in BDNF expression/signaling
(Calabrese et al., 2014). Here we do not see evidence that
pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased BDNF signaling—instead
we see very robust increases in BDNF levels as well as increases
in some pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially arguing further
for our hypothesis that the observed cytokine changes are
related to a system-wide increase in readiness for immunologic
challenge.
Lastly, an alternative possible explanation for the observed
increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines is that they may have
increased because of an aspect of psychological stress inherent
in the intensive 3-month yoga-meditation retreat that we did
not ascertain using the current design. There may have been
some component of increased stress related to the intensive
group retreat process with limited free time for independent
relaxation and/or the social dynamics related to group practice
led by a charismatic teacher as well as being away from familiar
and normal activities for a prolonged period. The fact that
participants reported relatively little anxiety and depression
symptoms at baseline and improvements in these variables
argues against this interpretation, as does the increase in BDNF
and CAR indicative of improved psychophysiological wellness,
but it must be considered.
In sum, the yoga and meditative practices in the 3-month
intensive retreat appear to positively impact BDNF signaling,
CAR, and immunological markers as well as improve subjective
well-being. It is likely that at least some of the significant
improvements in both HPA axis functioning as exemplified
by the CAR as well as neuroimmunologic functioning as
exemplified by increases in BDNF levels and alterations in
cytokines were due to the intensive meditation practice involved
in this retreat. We hypothesize that the pattern of biological
findings is related to enhanced resilience and well-being
with increased BDNF signaling possibly related to enhanced
neurogenesis and/or neuroplasticity, increased CAR likely
related to enhanced alertness and readiness for mind-body
engagement,
and
increased
anti-
and
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
possibly
indicating
enhanced
immunological
readiness. These findings justify further studies of such
retreats assessing for the replicability, specificity and long-term
implications of these findings. Further research should seek
to employ appropriate control groups involved in similar
retreat-like interventions without the variable of meditative
practices (e.g., relaxation control). In addition, further controls
would allow for understanding of the role of other contextual
factors (e.g., social dynamics, diet, natural environment, relative
impact of a revered spiritual teacher, etc.) affecting the expression
and regulation of these biological processes. Future research that
assesses broad panels of biomarkers and global studies with more
appropriate control populations are needed to clarify the extent
to which these changes are related specifically to the meditation
and yoga practices, and given the suggestive findings reported
here such further work is warranted.
