DNA packaging determines the transcriptional potential of a cell and 
is central to the development and function of metazoan cell types1. 
Chromatin remodeling complexes control the local chromatin state, 
yielding either transcriptional activation or repression. Pluripotency, 
proliferation and differentiation are dependent on genomic regulation 
at the chromatin level, and proteins that control chromatin packaging 
are critical in development and cancer2. Although many chromatin 
remodeling factors function across organ systems, case-sequencing 
efforts have linked mutations of chromatin genes with specific, causal 
roles in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)3–6. This finding is par-
ticularly strong for rare and de novo mutations in autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD)7,8. Understanding how mutations to chromatin remod-
eling genes affect transcriptional regulation during brain development 
may reveal developmental and cellular mechanisms driving NDDs.
A key gene that has emerged from studies profiling rare and 
 
de novo coding variation in ASD is the gene CHD8, which encodes 
the chromatin remodeler CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA- 
binding protein 8)9. In addition to ASD, human individuals harboring 
CHD8 mutations exhibit macrocephaly, distinct craniofacial mor-
phology, mild-to-severe intellectual disability (ID) and gastrointes-
tinal problems9. Homozygous deletion of Chd8 in mice is lethal at 
early embryonic stages10. Chd8 knockdown in zebrafish recapitulates 
macrocephaly and gastrointestinal phenotypes9,11, suggesting a high 
degree of evolutionary conservation of CHD8 function in develop-
ment. It has been proposed that CHD8 achieves this regulatory func-
tion in brain development by binding to relevant gene promoters and 
enhancers11–14. Although recent mouse studies indicate that Chd8 is 
required in neurogenesis and that mutations to Chd8 cause behavioral 
phenotypes13,15, important questions remain regarding the role of 
Chd8 in regulating neurodevelopment, brain structure and behavior 
via direct and indirect transcriptional regulation. Characterizing the 
functional impact of germline heterozygous CHD8 mutation on brain 
development could reveal specific and generalizable mechanisms link-
ing chromatin biology to NDD pathology. Toward this goal, we gener-
ated a germline 5-base-pair (bp) deletion in Chd8 using CRISPR/Cas9 
genome engineering and assayed neuroanatomic, behavioral and tran-
scriptional phenotypes associated with Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the 
developing mouse brain.

The chromatin remodeling gene CHD8 represents a central node in neurodevelopmental gene networks implicated in autism. 
We examined the impact of germline heterozygous frameshift Chd8 mutation on neurodevelopment in mice. Chd8+/del5 mice 
displayed normal social interactions with no repetitive behaviors but exhibited cognitive impairment correlated with increased 
regional brain volume, validating that phenotypes of Chd8+/del5 mice overlap pathology reported in humans with CHD8 mutations. 
We applied network analysis to characterize neurodevelopmental gene expression, revealing widespread transcriptional changes 
in Chd8+/del5 mice across pathways disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurogenesis, synaptic processes 
and neuroimmune signaling. We identified a co-expression module with peak expression in early brain development featuring 
dysregulation of RNA processing, chromatin remodeling and cell-cycle genes enriched for promoter binding by Chd8, and we 
validated increased neuronal proliferation and developmental splicing perturbation in Chd8+/del5 mice. This integrative analysis 
offers an initial picture of the consequences of Chd8 haploinsufficiency for brain development.

the majority of identified human mutations9 (Fig. 1a–c). F0 muta-
tion carrier lines were expanded via breeding to wild-type C57BL/6N 
(WT) mice. Heterozygous male mice were bred for at least four gen-
erations before further experiments, and multiple litters were used for 
all experiments to eliminate potential off-target mutations. Consistent 
with an earlier study10, the presumed Chd8 frameshift alleles resulted 
in embryonic lethality in homozygous mutants, but heterozygous 
(Chd8+/del5) mice were viable, reached a normal lifespan and were 
fertile irrespective of sex.
We performed quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) 
and western blot analysis on brain lysates, using an N-terminus Chd8 
antibody that has been used previously used for Chd8 chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq)12. 
Heterozygous mutation resulted in decreased Chd8 transcript and pro-
tein at embryonic day (E)14.5, postnatal day (P)0 and in adults (Fig. 1d,e 
 
and Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). We identified a band representing 
full-length Chd8 (~280 kDa), which was consistently significantly 
reduced in Chd8+/del5 mice at all stages (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). 
We also observed a smaller ~110 kDa band, similar in size to what has 
been reported as a short Chd8 isoform13, which displayed inconsist-
ent trends of lower expression in Chd8+/del5 mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 1a–c). We performed RNA sequencing on E12.5 WT mice and

matched littermates from both the 5-bp and 14-bp deletion lines 
(RNA-seq, described below), observing sequence reads overlapping 
the Chd8 deletion in both 5-bp and 14-bp libraries but not in WT 
libraries. For both mutant lines, Chd8 deletion reads occurred at lower 
frequencies relative to WT allele reads, suggesting the frameshift tran-
scripts underwent degradation. For the majority of the following stud-
ies, we analyzed mice harboring the 5-bp deletion allele.
We tested for differences in brain size in Chd8+/del5 mice at birth 
(P0), as macrocephaly is a hallmark trait in patients with CHD8 muta-
tions9. The maximal cortical anteroposterior length of Chd8+/del5 
brains was ~7% longer than matched WT littermates (P < 0.0001) with 
no substantial differences between sexes (Fig. 1f). Whole-mount and 
Nissl-stained coronal brain sections were examined at P7 (Fig. 1g), 
 
and no overt neuropathological anomalies were observed. No sig-
nificant differences were observed in cortical thickness at 30% and 
70% distance from the dorsal midline (P = 0.224 and P = 0.268, 
respectively), though brains of Chd8+/del5 mice trended larger across 
 
both measurements (Fig. 1h). The overall neocortical section area was 
~8% larger in Chd8+/del5 brains (P = 0.0328), driven predominantly 
by an increase in length (P = 0.0026), confirming cerebral megalen-
cephaly at P7 (Fig. 1h).
Behavioral phenotyping of adult Chd8+/del5 mice
We performed a tailored behavioral battery using two standard 
assays each of cognitive, social and repetitive behaviors16 in two 
independent cohorts of adult Chd8+/del5 mice (first cohort: 9 male, 
10 female; second cohort: 11 male, 11 female) and WT littermates 
(first cohort: 11 male, 10 female; second cohort: 11 male, 9 female; 
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Learning and memory were 
evaluated using fear conditioning and novel object recognition. 
Fear conditioning evaluated memory for learned associations to an 
environmental context at 24 h and to an auditory cue at 48 h after 
training. Chd8+/del5 mutant mice exhibited less freezing when placed 
in the context chamber compared to WT littermate controls (Fig. 2a; 
t1,37 = 3.3492, P = 0.0019). Chd8+/del5 mutant mice also exhibited 
lower freezing scores to the auditory cue (Fig. 2b; t1,37 = 2.7064, 
 
P = 0.0104). WT littermates spent more time exploring the novel 
object than the familiar object, whereas Chd8+/del5 mutant mice 
failed to exhibit more novel object investigation (Fig. 2c; WT: F1,19 
= 11.5030, P = 0.0031; Chd8+/del5: F1,18 = 3.2825, P = 0.0867), indi-
cating deficits in recognition. Replication with a second, independ-
ent cohort of WT and Chd8+/del5 mice similarly found deficits in 
contextual and cued conditioning and novel object recognition

Figure 2 Chd8+/del5 mice exhibit cognitive deficits but no ASD-relevant social or repetitive phenotypes. (a,b) Fear conditioning. Chd8+/del5 mice exhibit 
deficits in learning and memory, including reduced freezing after tone–shock conditioning in both (a) context (t1,37 = 3.3492, *P = 0.0019) and (b)

(Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that Chd8+/del5 mice exhibited 
deficits in learning and memory.
Behaviors relevant to diagnostic symptoms of ASD were assessed 
using corroborative assays of social and repetitive behaviors17. 
Normal sociability was detected in both genotypes (Fig. 2d–i). Time 
spent in the chamber with the novel mouse was greater than with 
the novel object, meeting the definition of sociability in this assay, 
for both WT and Chd8+/del5 mice (Fig. 2d; WT: F1,19 = 16.31, P = 
0.0007; Chd8+/del5: F1,18 = 9.744, P = 0.0059). No sex differences were 
detected (F1,37 = 2.16, P = 0.149). Time spent sniffing the novel mouse 
was greater than time spent sniffing the novel object in both WT 
and Chd8+/del5 (Fig. 2e; WT: F1,18 = 7.00369, P = 0.0164; Chd8+/del5: 
F1,17 = 12.8051, P = 0.0023), with no sex differences (F1,35 = 0.0985, 
P = 0.7555). The number of entries into the side chambers was not 
affected by genotype in the social phase (Fig. 2f; F1,37 = 0.11, P = 0.73) 
 
or in the habituation phase (F1,37 = 0.30, P = 0.584), indicating normal 
exploratory activity in both genotypes during the assay. No deficits 
were observed in social parameters in male Chd8+/del5 mice dur-
ing male–female reciprocal social interaction (Fig. 2g–i). WT and 
Chd8+/del5 males spent similar amounts of time sniffing (Fig. 2g; t1,17 
= 0.9409, P = 0.3599) and following (Fig. 2h; t1,17 = 0.5785, P = 0.5705) 
the estrous WT female. Ultrasonic vocalizations during male–female 
interaction showed no genotype difference in number of emitted calls 
(Fig. 2i; t1,17 = 0.1634, P = 0.8722). No spontaneous stereotypies or 
repetitive behaviors were observed in the self-grooming assay (Fig. 2j; 
t1,38 = 0.8552, P = 0.3978) or numbers of marbles buried (Fig. 2k; t1,38 = 
 
1.0151, P = 0.3165). No sex differences were detected (self-grooming: 
t1,36 = −0.504, P = 0.619; marble burying: t1,38 = 1.4883, P = 0.1449). 
 
Open-field locomotor activity did not differ between genotypes (Fig. 2l; 
t1,38 = 1.1795, P = 0.2455), indicating normal exploratory and motor 
abilities. No substantial differences were observed in body weight or 
other relevant measures of general health in adult Chd8+/del5 mice.
Analysis of Chd8+/del5 adult brain structure via MRI
Intact brains were collected from the same mice that comprised the first 
cohort of behavioral phenotyping. Structural MRI was performed to 
identify changes in absolute (mm3) and relative regional brain volume 
and connectivity. In regional analysis, cortex was most affected, with 
a 7.5% increase in absolute volume in Chd8+/del5 mice (false discovery 
rate (FDR) = 1%). Similarly, cerebral white matter and cerebral gray 
matter were larger in Chd8+/del5 mice at 5.4% (FDR = 3%) and 6.1% 
(FDR = 2%), respectively. We assessed 159 independent brain regions 
with divisions across the cortex, subcortical areas and cerebellum (full 
results reported in Supplementary Table 1). Chd8+/del5 mice showed 
robust increases in absolute volume across cortical regions, hippocam-
pus (+10.3%, FDR < 1%) and amygdala (+11.0%, FDR < 1%; Fig. 3a).

off (Fig. 3b). Chd8+/del5 mice also displayed increased cortical thick-
ness, particularly along the cingulate cortex (Fig. 3c). Deep cerebellar 
nuclei showed decreased relative volume (−1 to −3%, FDR < 0.3%). 
Voxel-wise differences showed similar trends (Fig. 3d). Diffusion 
tensor imaging revealed no significant differences in fractional 
 
anisotropy or mean diffusivity in either the regional or voxel-wise 
measurements, indicating that white matter organization and 
 
long-range connectivity in Chd8+/del5 mice was not grossly different 
from that in WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Performing behavioral and structural MRI analyses on the same 
set of mice allowed us to test correlations between brain volume and 
behavioral performance. Increased absolute volume of cerebral cortex 
(f-stat = 33.6, FDR < 0.1%), hippocampus (f-stat = 29.0, FDR < 0.1%) 
and amygdala (f-stat = 38.6, FDR < 0.1%) were correlated with deficits 
in learning and memory, as assessed by the context conditioning task 
(R2: cortex = 0.1855, hippocampus = 0.148, amygdala = 0.1352; Fig. 3e).

This relationship was driven by Chd8+/del5 mice with increased 
brain volume. Similar correlations were present between other brain 
regions and cued and context responses, suggesting that the correla-
tion between fear conditioning performance and brain volume was a 
general rather than region-specific relationship.
Differential gene expression across neurodevelopment in 
Chd8+/del5 mice
We applied RNA-seq in forebrain dissected from four developmental 
stages (E12.5, E14.5, E17.5 and P0) and adult mice (age > P56; Fig. 4a). 
 
This strategy was designed to capture changes during embryonic neu-
rodevelopment but has decreased sensitivity for changes limited to post-
natal or adult brains. After quality filtering, we analyzed 26 Chd8+/del5 
and 18 WT littermates (sample details in Supplementary Table 2). 
Using a statistical model that accounted for sex, developmental stage 
and sequencing batch, we tested for differential expression across 11,936 
genes that were robustly expressed in our data sets. At significance cutoffs 
corresponding to FDR < 0.05 (P < 0.0021), FDR < 0.1 (P < 0.0088) or 
FDR < 0.20 (P < 0.0369), we found 510, 1,040 and 2,195 genes, respec-
tively, that were differentially expressed (DE; Supplementary Table 3).

The majority of significant expression changes in Chd8+/del5 were rel-
atively small (99.5% < 1.5 absolute fold change across phases; Fig. 4b), 
indicating that changes in neurodevelopmental gene expression were 
widespread yet subtle. The top DE gene was Chd8 (log2 fold change = 0.59, 
 
P = 2.20 × 10−27, FDR = 3.18 × 10−23). Chd8 expression declined 
across development, with substantial reductions in Chd8+/del5 mice 
at each stage (Fig. 4c). We validated expression changes at P0 for 
a set of genes via qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 4; primers are 
listed in Supplementary Table 4), including Hnrnpa2b1, for which 
we additionally validated differential protein levels in P0 Chd8+/del5 
forebrains (Fig. 4d,e). Gene set enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology 
(GO) terms and Reactome18 pathways identified strong enrichment 
among DE genes for annotations associated with RNA processing, 
chromatin remodeling and cell cycle, with numerous additional 
annotations enriched at lower levels (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). 
Similar enrichment was observed for DE genes at FDR cutoffs of 0.05, 
 
0.10 and 0.20.
To identify direct regulatory targets of Chd8, we used ChIP-seq to 
map regions of Chd8 genomic interactions in adult mouse forebrain. 
After merging two independent samples with similar binding patterns, 
we identified 708 peaks using stringent enrichment criteria (Fig. 4f 
and Supplementary Table 3). Chd8 binding occurred nearly exclu-
sively at gene promoters in our adult forebrain data set. We observed 
strong concordance in enriched functional annotation terms between 
DE and Chd8-bound genes (Fig. 4g). While the majority of DE genes 
did not exhibit Chd8 binding in the adult forebrain Chd8 ChIP-seq 
generated here, we observed strong enrichment for binding among 
downregulated genes (Fig. 4i). In contrast, we found no enrichment 
among upregulated DE genes for Chd8 promoter binding. We did 
not find evidence of a primary sequence motif in Chd8 ChIP-seq 
peak regions, suggesting indirect genomic recruitment, but we found 
weaker, yet significant, enrichment of secondary motifs such as YY1 
(e = 4.2 × 10−31), NRF1 (e = 8.5 × 10−24) and NFYB (e = 1.3 × 10−17; 
Supplementary Fig. 5a).
In agreement with other studies of transcriptional changes asso-
ciated with reduction of Chd8 expression11,12, autism risk genes 
such as Kdm5b and Bcl11a were DE in Chd8+/del5 mice (Fig. 4d). We 
tested for overlap between DE downregulated and upregulated genes

(FDR < 0.20) and published gene sets relevant to autism genetics and 
Chd8 regulation. Of 141 ASD risk genes based on case mutations19 
expressed in our data, 37 were DE at FDR < 0.20 and downregulated, 
representing strong enrichment (permutation test, P = 2.8 × 10−10; 
Fig. 4h). We similarly observed enrichment among downregulated 
DE genes with autism risk genes identified by other studies20,21  
(Fig. 4i) and with FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) tar-
gets22 (P = 0.04). Finally, we observed enrichment (P = 0.012) between 
DE upregulated genes and genes associated with immune response 
that were upregulated in cortex from postmortem ASD brains23,24. 
We did not identify enrichment with genes downregulated in post-
mortem ASD cortex.
Next, we asked whether our DE data was consistent with differen-
tial expression in independent studies of Chd8 mutation or knock-
down11–13,15. We observed consistent enrichment among up- and 
downregulated DE genes in Chd8+/del5 forebrain and up- and down-
regulated DE genes identified in previous studies (Fig. 4j). We also 
used the same methods used here to reanalyze neurodevelopmental 
RNA-seq data from independent studies of germline heterozygous 
Chd8 mutation13 and in utero knockdown via Chd8 shRNA delivery to 
E14.5 brain ventricle15 (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary 
Table 3). Chd8 was more strongly downregulated in the knockdown 
model15 and upregulated in the independent Chd8 mouse model13. 
Nonetheless, we observed significant overlap between genes iden-
tified here and in the other two studies (Fig. 4j). For overlapping 
DE genes from our data and the other two studies, DE sensitivity 
and effect sizes were generally larger in the knockdown data15 and 
smaller in the independent germline model13 compared to our data 
(Supplementary Fig. 5b,c), suggesting differences in transcriptional 
consequences after knockdown and across different alleles or genetic 
backgrounds. We noted a reversal in direction of some specific DE 
effects in the knockdown data versus our data, including for neuro-
nal differentiation genes (downregulated here but upregulated after 
knockdown), further suggesting differential impact of knockdown 
versus germline mutation.
We next explored how DE genes are organized into expression 
trajectories during brain development toward identifying per-
turbation to stage-specific processes. We used weighted gene co-
expression network analysis (WGCNA25) to identify five discrete 
expression trajectory modules across forebrain development (Fig. 5a–c 
 
and Supplementary Table 7). DE genes assigned to specific mod-
ules were enriched for stage-specific annotation terms (Fig. 5d 
and Supplementary Table 5). Two modules (M.1 and M.3) were 
enriched for downregulated genes, while the other three modules 
(M.2, M.4 and M.grey) were enriched for upregulated genes (Fig. 5e). 
 
M.1, characterized by decreasing expression across neurodevelop-
ment, was strongly associated with chromatin organization, RNA 
processing and cell-cycle regulation, and it included the largest 
number of DE downregulated autism risk genes (Fig. 5f). M.1 was 
the only module enriched for targets of Chd8 binding. M.1 down-
regulated DE genes overlapped genes in early expressed ASD-relevant 
 
networks26 (Parikshak.DEV.M2 and Parikshak.DEV.M3; Fig. 5g). 
 
M.2 was characterized by early low expression that gradually 
increased. Downregulated genes in M.2 were enriched for FMRP 
targets22, GO and Reactome terms that are hallmarks of mature neu-
rons (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6) and include synaptic genes 
(Supplementary Fig. 5d) and autism risk genes such as Cers4 and 
Gria1. DE genes from M.2 were enriched for later developmental 
ASD-relevant modules26 (Parikshak.DEV.M13, Parikshak.DEV.M16 
and Parikshak.DEV.M17) linked to synaptic developmental and home-
ostatic processes, consistent with developmental timing (Fig. 5g). 
 
M.3 genes exhibited rising expression from E12.5 to P0, with lower 
expression in adult brain, were enriched for GO terms associated 
with transient development processes (for example, axon guidance) 
and include autism risk genes involved in neuronal maturation (for 
example, Bcl11a). Compared to genes identified as DE in postmortem 
ASD cortex24, we identified enrichment with two modules charac-
terized by increased expression of genes linked to immune func-
tion and cell identity of astrocytes (Parikshak.ASD.M9, enriched 
for upregulated genes in our M.2 and M.4) or microglia (Parikshak.
ASD.M19, enriched for upregulated genes in our M.1; Fig. 5g). 
 
These results show that the impact of Chd8 haploinsufficiency reaches 
across stages and biological processes.
We further focused on M.1, which showed the strongest enrichment 
for autism risk early developmental modules26 and for Chd8 binding tar-
gets in mouse brain (Fig. 5f,g). M.1 showed a general trend of decreas-
ing expression (Fig. 6a), had the greatest number of DE genes and 
was significantly enriched for downregulated genes (P = 8.8 × 10−26). 
 
We found 865 genes in M.1 that were DE at FDR < 0.20 (641 down-
regulated, 224 upregulated), accounting for ~39% of all DE genes 
identified in our study. Upregulation of M.1 genes peaked at E14.5; 
downregulation peaked from E14.5 to E17.5 (Fig. 6b). Analysis of pro-
tein–protein interactions (STRING27) showed that DE (FDR < 0.10) 
 
genes in M.1 had more interactions than expected by chance (observed 
edges = 1,479, expected edges = 512, enrichment = 2.89, STRING 
 
P < 0.0001). Interacting genes in M.1 were enriched for GO terms

these results highlight interconnectedness among these three proc-
esses at the level of Chd8 regulation and gene expression. M.1 DE

Increased prenatal proliferation of neural progenitors in 
Chd8+/del5 mice
To examine whether alterations in developmental genes play a func-
tional role in neuronal development that could lead to megalencephaly, 
 
we performed 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) proliferation assays 
 
at E13.5. After a 1.5-h pulse, we observed a 15.9% increase in EdU+ 
cells in the germinal cortical ventricular and subventricular zones 
(VZ and SVZ, respectively) of mutant animals (P = 0.0388; Fig. 6e), 
 
indicating perturbed neurogenesis in the Chd8+/del5 mutants. 
Additionally, since a number of genes associated with brain devel-
opment and cortical structure were DE, we examined the cortical 
cytoarchitecture via analysis of layer-specific markers Tbr1, Ctip2 and 
Brn2 by immunostaining at P0 and P7 (Supplementary Fig. 6). We 
observed no gross alterations to lamination and found no evidence 
for focal cortical lesions. To further delineate proliferative changes in

Chd8+/del5 mice, we assessed neural progenitor populations at E14.5 
(Fig. 7). First, we examined Pax6+ radial glial cells, measuring VZ area 
over the entire cortical hemisphere. The VZ in Chd8+/del5 embryos 
was significantly increased, by ~18% (Fig. 7a,e; P = 0.0165). We 
observed a ~26% increase in Pax6+ cells in Chd8+/del5 brains (Fig. 7b,f; 
 
P = 0.0032). Subsequently, we labeled Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors, 
observing a significant decrease by ~24% in Chd8+/del5 mice (Fig. 7c,g; 
P = 0.0086), indicating different proliferative trajectories for these 
two progenitor types. Finally, we performed pulse-chase assays to 
determine the quit (Q) fraction of cortical cells exiting the cell cycle 
over a defined 20 h, using the proliferation marker Ki67. EdU+Ki67− 
cells were significantly increased, corresponding to an increase in 
Q fraction by ~25% in Chd8+/del5 embryos (Fig. 7d,h; P = 0.0057). 
These results indicate that alteration to cortical projection neuron 
production may represent a cellular substrate for megalencephaly in 
Chd8+/del5 mice.
Neurodevelopmental RNA processing is perturbed in  
Chd8+/del5 mice
Downregulated DE genes with divergent expression trajectories were 
significantly overrepresented among genes annotated to RNA process-
ing and mRNA splicing in the Reactome database (Fig. 8a,b and 
Supplementary Table 6). For example, Dhx9 (M.1) decreases across 
neurodevelopment and has not been functionally characterized in brain 
but has been reported in autism risk networks20, while Upf3b (M.3) 
expression increases across development and is a neuron-specific factor 
required during neuronal differentiation that is implicated in ID28,29. We 
examined whether Chd8+/del5 mice exhibited aberrant splicing during 
brain development linked to DE of RNA-processing genes. We used the 
Mixture of Isoforms (MISO30) program to examine our RNA-seq data 
for differential splicing (DS) between WT and Chd8+/del5 mice and across 
neurodevelopment in WT mice (Supplementary Table 8). Genes associ-
ated with a DS event in Chd8+/del5 mice significantly overlapped down-
regulated (P = 1.2 × 10−10) but not upregulated DE genes, raising the 
possibility that splicing changes explain some proportion of differential 
expression (Supplementary Fig. 7a). DS genes identified in Chd8+/del5 
mouse brain were enriched for DS-associated genes identified in post-
mortem ASD cortex24 (P = 1.2 × 10−17), suggesting that DS in Chd8+/del5 
mice is linked to ASD-relevant DS (Supplementary Fig. 7a).
At E17.5, MISO identified 591 DS events between WT and Chd8+/
del5 mice, of which 393 (~66%) were also DS between E14.5 WT and 
E17.5 WT mice (Fig. 8c). These results suggest that differential splic-
ing between WT and Chd8+/del5 mice was linked to developmental 
changes in splicing. To investigate this, we examined correlation 
between DS events present in both E14.5 WT versus E17.5 WT and 
E17.5 Chd8+/del5 versus E17.5 WT comparisons. Percentage spliced 
in (PSI) values of DS events identified in the E17.5 Chd8+/del5 versus 
E17.5 WT comparison correlated positively with PSI values in the 
E14.5 WT versus E17.5 WT comparison (Fig. 8d). This correlation 
suggests DS in E17.5 Chd8+/del5 mice corresponds to an intermediate 
developmental state between WT E14.5 and E17.5. We validated devel-
opmentally relevant Chd8+/del5 DS using a known neurogenic splicing 
event, inclusion or exclusion of a ~6-kb Ank2 exon31. Inclusion of 
the Ank2 exon increased between E12.5 and E17.5 in WT (Fig. 8e), 
consistent with expectations31. qRT-PCR analysis of the Ank2 exon 
validated the exon inclusion increase across development in WT and 
the decrease from E17.5 WT levels in E17.5 Chd8+/del5 mice (Fig. 8f). 
We also validated developmental splicing changes in Srsf7 detected 
via MISO analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Our results suggest that 
perturbed splicing in Chd8 haploinsufficiency may contribute to the 
neurodevelopmental phenotypes in Chd8+/del5 mice.
DISCUSSION
Modeling how constitutive heterozygous germline mutations impact 
mammalian brain development is critical to understanding the neu-
robiology of disorders like ASD and ID, which are strongly associ-
ated with single-copy loss-of-function mutations. After validation 
that germline 5-bp and 14-bp deletion mutations in Chd8 exon 5 
resulted in haploinsufficiency, we present here an initial integrative 
picture of the consequences of Chd8 haploinsufficiency on neurode-
velopment. The presence of genomic and neuroanatomical pheno-
types in our Chd8+/del5 mice paralleled the clinical signature of human 
CHD8 mutations, suggesting similar neurodevelopmental pathologies 
between species. Our study revealed NDD-relevant phenotypes and 
mechanistic insights into why haploinsufficiency of a general chro-
matin factor produces neurodevelopmental phenotypes.
We report behavioral outcomes in our heterozygous Chd8+/del5 
mice, specifically learning and memory impairments, but no atypi-
cal sociability or repetitive behaviors. There are three recent publica-
tions associated with downregulation of Chd8 in mice. Durak et al.15 
 
reported an in utero knockdown of Chd8 expression, including 
restricted knockdown of Chd8 in upper cortical layer neurons. 
Katayama et al.13 generated two lines of Chd8 mutant mice via embry-
onic stem cell targeting, while Platt et al.14 used CRISPR/Cas9 target-
ing to generate indel mutations in Chd8. The obvious differences in 
biological consequences and mechanisms between in utero knock-
down15 and our germline heterozygous model likely explain many 
differences and make cross-approach comparisons a challenge. Our 
data on the absence of repetitive behaviors agree with those reported 
in Katayama et al.13 and Platt et al.14; however, these studies also 
report specific social phenotypes in heterozygous Chd8 mice. We 
focus our comparison on the Katayama et al.13 study as we were able 
to directly compare neurodevelopmental gene expression changes to 
our model. We observed differences in strength of expression changes 
that may be due to allele or genetic background. Katayama et al.13 
report phenotypes relevant to social deficits but report normal acqui-
sition learning using the Barnes and T-maze assays. Discrepancies 
in cognitive phenotypes could be attributed to the tasks conducted, 
since spatial maze tasks are primarily hippocampal-dependent, while 
components of fear conditioning and novel object recognition require 
other brain regions, including amygdala. Additionally, our Chd8+/del5 
mutation was generated and maintained on a C57BL/6N background, 
while Katayama et al.13 harbored a different mutation on C57BL/6J. 
Background strain differences in behavioral phenotypes are common, 
and C57BL/6N generally show higher basal freezing during contex-
tual fear freezing, which allows for a larger signal and detection of 
genotype differences32.
Our finding of normal sociability is consistent with results 
reported for other Chd8+/− germline models13,14. However, both 
other models13,14, report abnormalities in social behavior based 
on failure of  Chd8+/− mice to exhibit preference for social novelty 
between a novel and familiar mouse. Preference for social novelty 
is dependent on olfactory discrimination, which is driven by a vari-
ety of sensory and processing systems. As such, the combination of 
normal three-chamber assay sociability but failure to discriminate 
a novel mouse in these models13,14 could represent mild deficits in 
social interaction or could be due to other factors impacting olfac-
tory discrimination. Another difference is that Katayama et al.13  
tested only male mice with a broad age range of 12–50 weeks of age, 
while our battery was conducted using both sexes at younger ages, 
between 6–16 weeks, to avoid aging as a confounding variable. We 
also note that several studies of other mouse models with mutations 
 
in genes implicated in ASD have not identified deficits in social

behaviors33, potentially due to evolutionary divergence between 
mouse and human neurobiology, allele or genetic background dif-
ferences, or sensitivity of methods used to evaluate ASD-relevant 
behavior in mice.
The structural changes in the brain of adult Chd8+/del5 mice 
observed here parallel those found in other relevant mouse mod-
els. A recent study examined 26 different mouse models related to 
autism34, clustering these models into three distinct groups. Key 
aspects of Group 1 included larger cortical structures, particularly 
the frontal and parietal lobes, and smaller structures in the cerebel-
lum, which is in line with the Chd8+/del5 mouse described here. This 
group of models included Nrxn1α, Shank3, En2 and Fmr1 mutants. 
The Chd8+/del5 mouse most resembled the differences found in the 
Fmr1 mutant mice. Further examination may reveal similarities with 
other mouse models within this group beyond neuroanatomy (for 
example, excitatory deficits in the Nrxn1α mouse35), as suggested 
by the widespread transcriptional changes present in Chd8+/del5 
neurodevelopment. Increases in cortical anteroposterior length and 
developmental neurogenesis appear largely overlapping in Chd8+/del5 
mice and Wdfy3 mutants, another model of megalencephaly in ASD36. 
Future work will be needed to test for causal relationships between 
structural changes and behavior in Chd8+/del5 mice.
Our RNA-seq analysis captured subtle changes in transcription 
across brain development in Chd8+/del5 mice, as well as evidence of 
differential splicing. Differential expression changes were consistent 
across developmental stages for perturbed genes highly relevant to 
ASD-associated networks and strongly correlated with biological 
pathways and expression modules of interest. Our network analysis, 
using in vivo data, enabled characterization of the impact of Chd8 hap-
loinsufficiency across neurodevelopment at a level of detail sufficient 
to capture perturbations across developmental stages and processes. 
Our results indicate convergent neuropathology connecting principle 
gene networks identified in ASD case sequencing studies, particularly 
chromatin remodeling, neuronal differentiation and synaptic path-
ways7,8, and those identified in other ASD-relevant pathways such 
as immune response24 and FMRP binding22. Our findings suggest 
a hierarchy of changes in Chd8+/del5 brain development anchored by 
dysregulation of genes in M.1, which represents a highly interactive 
network central to control of chromatin state, RNA processing and 
cell cycle, including numerous genes implicated in ASD. Among these 
genes, our results suggest direct role and requirement for WT Chd8 
expression levels in activating target gene expression. As seen with 
other NDD genetic models such as Fmr1 (ref. 37) and Rbfox1 (ref. 38), 
 
disruption to RNA processing, likely driven by indirect transcrip-
tional regulation here, appears to be an important player in Chd8+/del5 
neuropathology. Further studies are needed to capture neuroanatomi-
cal and cellular changes associated with differential expression signa-
tures and to determine stage- and cell-specific patterns and roles of 
Chd8 binding. This is especially critical given that contrasting Chd8 
genomic interaction patterns have been reported in brain11–14.
We report overall increased proliferation during the peak window 
of embryonic neurogenesis, with different consequences for the pro-
genitor populations involved. The observed overall increase in prolif-
eration in our experiments contrasts with the decreased proliferation 
reported in an in utero Chd8 knockdown model15. These differences 
could be explained by the timing of in utero knockdown at E14.5 (after 
initial symmetric expansion of the radial glia pool), by the presence of 
non-cell-autonomous effects or due to differences in proliferation assay 
timing. Time-point-specific analysis of cell cycle, proliferation and 
apoptosis will be needed to understand the comprehensive impact of 
Chd8 haploinsufficiency on cell populations in the brain. It is possible 
 
that contrasting outcomes are due to differences in Chd8 dosage, 
considering that knockdown resulted in greater Chd8 downregula-
tion15. As complete Chd8 loss impedes embryonic development at 
very early stages10, downregulation beyond haploinsufficiency may 
interfere further with developmental cellular pathways. In support of 
this, neuronal development genes downregulated in our M.3 module 
were upregulated after in utero knockdown, suggesting that knock-
down caused an early shift from proliferation to differentiation15 that 
did not appear to occur with heterozygous germline mutation.
Our initial survey of mice heterozygous for mutation to Chd8 revealed 
significant findings across genomic, anatomical and behavioral axes 
of neurobiology. Our experiments link cognitive deficits, increased 
regional brain volume and perturbations of biological pathways across 
neurodevelopment, recapitulating traits observed in human individuals 
who carry mutations in CHD8. The transcription data generated here 
represent a resource for dissecting the pathways involved in NDD patho-
genesis and for prioritizing risk genes from genetic studies. Additional 
studies will be necessary to replicate and compare findings across mutant 
Chd8 alleles and genetic backgrounds and to clarify dosage-specific phe-
notypes. Our results offer insight into neurodevelopmental pathology 
associated with mutations to CHD8, a genetic model that appears to be 
a bellwether for mutations affecting chromatin remodeling in autism.

generation of Chd8 mutant mice. We used Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of 
C56BL/6N oocytes to generate two mouse lines harboring frameshift deletions 
 
(5 bp and 14 bp) in mouse Chd8 exon 5. Guide RNA was designed and synthesized 
according to described methods39, pooled with Cas9 mRNA and injected into 
mouse oocytes. We scanned the Chd8 coding sequence for unique gRNA target 
sites, identifying one in exon 5 with sequence GAGGAGGAGGTCGATGTAAC. 
This sequence maps uniquely to the target site via BLAT (mm9), reducing the like-
lihood of off-target mutations. Initial Cas9 targeting was performed at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory. F0s (induced on C57BL/6N background) carrying 
mutations were genotyped and bred to expand lines that harbored a mutation. We 
identified F0 pups carrying 5-bp (mm9: chr14:52,847,259–52,847,263) and 14-bp 
deletions (mm9: chr14:52,847,249–52,847,262) in Chd8 exon 5 that overlapped 
the target sequence. The deletions occur at position 1,814 (5-bp deletion) or 1,813 
(14-bp deletion) of Chd8 mRNA (uc007tot.1). Both alleles match wild-type Chd8 
amino acid sequence through position 604, after which the 5-bp and 14-bp dele-
tion frameshifts are predicted to result in 16 and 14 altered amino acids, respec-
tively, before a stop codon is reached. The full-length Chd8 protein is predicted 
to be 2,582 amino acids. Both deletion alleles are predicted to result in nonsense-
mediated decay based on reduced frequency of mutant transcripts and decreased 
Chd8 protein levels. Deletion alleles were subcloned to verify DNA changes, and 
genotyping was performed using allele-specific PCR with sequence verification.
The colony of animals carrying the 5-bp Chd8 deletion allele was rederived at 
UC Davis and maintained by crossing male carriers with C57BL/6N wild-type 
females (Charles River). Extensive crossing of heterozygous mutation carriers to 
wild-type animals vastly reduces the likelihood that any potential off-target muta-
tions caused by Cas9 targeting would persist in our mutant Chd8 line. Genotypes 
were identified via allele-specific PCR and sequence-verified for all animals 
included in analyses, with the primers reported in Supplementary Table 4. 
 
We examined Chd8 protein and transcript levels via western blot and qRT-PCR 
at E14.5 and P0 and compared cortical length in whole-mount P0 brains from 
Chd8+/del5 mice and matched WT littermates. For all experiments, samples from 
both males and females were used unless otherwise described. All mouse stud-
ies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the 
University of California Davis and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
Subject mice were housed in a temperature-controlled vivarium maintained on 
a 12-h light–dark cycle. Efforts were made to minimize pain and distress and the 
number of animals used.
qRT-PcR. Differential expression of selected gene targets was verified by 
 
qRT-PCR at P0, using cDNA libraries prepared following the same protocols 
listed in the “Genomics” section, below. Primers are reported in Supplementary 
Table 4. For qRT-PCR analysis, n = 9 WT and 7 Chd8+/del5 forebrains from male 
and female samples were used. Samples were excluded if technical replicates 
failed. Cycle counts were normalized to ActB. Unpaired t-tests were performed 
on normalized relative gene expression between WT and Chd8+/del5 brains using 
∆∆CT. To reduce noise, the highest and lowest values from both groups were 
discarded. To validate differential splicing, we used isoform-specific quantitative 
reverse-transcription PCR on cDNA libraries prepared from forebrains dissected 
from Chd8+/del5 and matched WT littermates. We used primers validated for 
isoform analysis of Ank2 expression during development31 and designed primers 
specific to a differentially spliced exon of Srsf7. Comparisons of splicing across 
stages and between Chd8+/del5 and matched WT littermates were analyzed using 
Welch’s t-test and linear regression.
western blot analysis. Isolated forebrain from E14.5 embryos (male and female 
littermates), P0 neonates and P60 adults were lysed in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, 
140 nM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40 and 0.25% Triton with 
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After sonication, samples were spun down 
and the supernatant was used for a BCA Bradford assay using the Spectramax 190 
plate reader to assess protein concentration using a standard curve. We ran 22 µg 
 
of protein on a 3–8% Tris acetate gel using the Novex western blotting system 
(Invitrogen). Anti-Chd8 (ref. 12) (1:1,000, ab114126; Abcam), anti-Hnrnpa2b1 
(ref. 40) (1:1,000, ab31645; Abcam) and anti-Gapdh (ref. 41) (1:10,000, G8795; 
Sigma-Aldrich) primary antibodies were incubated overnight in Fluorescent 
Blocker solution (Millipore), visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey CLx system 
and quantified in FIJI (National Institutes of Health). For Chd8 western blots, 
both males and females were used. For the Hnrnpa2b1 western blot, only male 
samples were used. Protein levels assayed via western blot were compared via 
Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA for adult Chd8 levels.
Analysis of cortical length at P0. For gross anatomical measurements at P0 and 
P7, Chd8 male and female littermates were decapitated and heads placed in 4% 
PFA for at least 24 h. Brains were carefully dissected and placed in an agarose 
mold to ensure specific positioning. Whole-mount images were taken with the 
Zeiss Lumar.V12 stereoscope with a Ned Lumar 0.8× FwD 80-mm objective and 
Axiovision 4.8 software. Analysis of cortical length measurements was performed 
with FIJI software (National Institutes of Health).
morphological analysis. All histological experiments were performed at least 
in triplicate on embryos/pups from at least two separate litters. Following 
anesthesia, P7 male and female mice were transcardially perfused with 4% 
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 
overnight fixation in the same solution. After fixation, brains were removed 
from the skull, embedded in 2% LTE Agarose/PBS and cut coronally in 50-µm 
sections on a vibratome (VT 1000S, Leica). Subsequently, the sections were 
mounted on glass slides (SuperFrost Plus, Thermo-Fisher), Nissl-stained with 
a 0.1% cresyl violet solution and mounted with DePeX (Electron Microscopy 
Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Select sections, approximately corresponding to adult 
bregma −2 mm, were aligned across genotypes using subcortical anatomical 
landmarks for orientation (hippocampal length, thalamic size), and images 
of entire hemispheres were acquired on a Keyence BZ microscope. We meas-
ured individual morphological parameters using the Keyence BZ analyzer 
(hemispheric/neocortical circumference, neocortical thickness) or FIJI soft-
ware (cortical area). Hemispheric circumferences were measured from the 
dorsal to the ventral midline. Neocortical circumferences were measured from 
the dorsal midline to a line perpendicular to the midline originating from the 
dorsal endpoint of the dorsal endopririform nucleus.
edU labeling and immunofluorescent analysis. Litters for neuroanatomy 
analysis were generated by breeding male Chd8+/del5 mice with WT females. 
Brains were perfused before isolation, embedding and sectioning. Experimenters 
were blinded to genotype. Both male and female samples were used in the 
 
following assays.
Time-pregnant females were intraperitoneally injected at E13.5 with 50 mg/kg 
body weight EdU. After 1.5 h (proliferation assay) or 20 h (Q-fraction analysis), 
females were anesthetized and embryos transcardially perfused with 4% PFA/PBS. 
After 2 h of further fixation in the same solution, embryo brains were immersed in 
15% and then 30% sucrose in PBS, placed in OCT compound (Fisher HealthCare, 
Houston, TX), frozen in dry-ice-chilled methanol and sectioned at 16 µm (1.5-h 
pulse) or 18 µm (20-h pulse) on a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). 
EdU detection was performed with the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 594 imaging 
kit protocol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Q-fraction analysis followed previously established practices36. In 
brief, midcortical 200-µm-wide segments were imaged and EdU+Ki67− cells posi-
tioned basal to the SVZ counted, followed by the count of all EdU+ cells. The ratio 
of the two counts represented the Q-fraction. One sample each from WT and 
Chd8+/del5 was removed from Q-fraction analysis due to difficulties in selecting the 
VZ. All immunolabeling was carried out on slide-mounted cryosections (18 µm) 
 
following standard protocols and using primary antibodies directed against Pax6 
(ref. 42) (PRB-278P-100; rabbit, 1:100, Covance, Princeton, NJ), Tbr2 (http://
www.abcam.com/TBR2– Eomes-antibody-EPR19012-ab183991.pdf; ab183991; 
rabbit, 1:400, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) or Ki67 (ref. 43) (#12202; 
rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Alexa Fluor secondary antibod-
ies (488 and 594) were used at 1:200 concentrations (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA). All quantifications of labeled cells were carried out at equiva-
lent anteroposterior positions between genotypes. To determine the dorsoventral 
position of cortical segments for cell type counts, we measured the cortical ven-
tricle from the corticostriatal boundary to the apex, defined the 50% position and 
centered at this position a 200-µm-wide box perpendicular to the ventricle. All 
imaging was carried out on a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope.

blocking solution containing normal donkey serum (5% v/v) diluted in PBS-T 
(1× phosphate buffered saline and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100), rinsed in PBS-T 
and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C in primary antibody solution containing anti-
Ctip2 (ref. 44) (ab18465; Abcam), anti-Tbr1 (ref. 44) (ab31940; Abcam) and 
anti-Brn2 (ref. 45) (sc-6029; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, each diluted 
1:500 in PBS-T. These antibodies have been previously used for IHC analysis in 
brain46,47. The slides were then rinsed in PBS-T and incubated overnight at 4 °C 
in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (711-545-152 and 712-165-153; 
Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were rinsed in PBS-T, counterstained for 2 h 
in DAPI (D1306, Thermo-Fisher), rinsed in PBS-T and coverslip-mounted with 
Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). Sections were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse 
E600 upright microscope with a 4× objective lens (Plan Apo; N.A. 0.2), mer-
cury light source, appropriate fluorescent filter sets and NIS Elements software, 
 
(v. 4.20; Nikon Instruments). Images were imported into FIJI ImageJ (v. 1.50E48) 
and similar sections from each brain were identified based on anatomical land-
marks. Within each genotype, all brains were selected randomly for histological 
processing without taking morphological criteria into account. All histology was 
done blind, by investigators who were unaware of group allocation. No data points 
were excluded. Male and female samples were used. All antibodies used for this 
study were validated and their use widely reported.
Behavioral testing. Subject mice were housed in a temperature-controlled vivar-
ium maintained on a 12-h light–dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the 
University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and 
were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Efforts were made to minimize pain and 
distress and the number of animals used. No previous analyses were performed 
on animals used for behavioral testing. We used mixed genotype home cages 
with 2–4 animals per cage and used experimenters and video scorer/processors 
blinded to genotype during testing and analysis. All tests were conducted during 
the light cycle.
Chd8+/del5 male and female mice and WT littermates, ages 2–4 months, were 
evaluated in a standard battery of neurobehavioral assays relevant to the core 
diagnostic and associated symptoms of autism16. We performed the testing on 
two independent cohorts of adult Chd8+/del5 mice (first cohort: 9 male, 10 female; 
second cohort: 11 male, 11 female) and WT littermates (first cohort: 11 male, 10 
female; second cohort: 11 male, 9 female). One animal in the first cohort died 
during behavioral testing. This happened during the three-chambered social 
approach, in the middle of the behavioral battery. Adult Chd8+/del5 and matched 
WT littermates were tested in the following sequence: open field, general health, 
self-grooming, marble burying, three-chambered social approach, male–female 
social interactions, novel object recognition and fear conditioning. Testing was 
performed at the UC Davis MIND Institute Intellectual and Developmental 
Disabilities Research Center Mouse Behavior Core.
Open field locomotion. General exploratory locomotion in a novel open field 
environment was assayed as previously described49–51. Open field activity was 
considered an essential control for effects on physical activity, for example, seda-
tion or hyperactivity17,51,52, which could confound the interpretation of results 
from the reciprocal interactions, self-grooming, fear conditioning and social 
approach tasks. The testing room was illuminated at ~40 lx.
Adult general health and neurological reflexes. General health and neurological 
reflexes were evaluated in adult mice as previously described53,54. General health 
was assessed on a ranking scale of 0–3 based on fur condition, whisker condition, 
skin color, and body and limb tone. Body weight and basal temperature were also 
measured, using a hand held portable scale (Ohaus, Parsippany, NJ) and a mouse 
thermistor probe with lubricant and gently inserted 2 cm into the rectum, respec-
tively. Righting reflex and any occurrences of physical abnormalities were noted. 
Neurological reflex tests included trunk curl, wire hanging, forepaw reaching, 
righting reflex, corneal reflex, whisker twitch, pinnae response, eyeblink response 
and auditory startle. The reactivity level of each mouse was assessed with tests 
measuring responsiveness to petting, intensity of a dowel biting response and 
level of vocalization during handling55.
Novel object recognition. The novel object recognition test was conducted 
in opaque matte white (P95 White, Tap Plastics, Sacramento, CA) open field 
arenas (40 cm × 60 cm × 23 cm), using methods similar to those previously 
described50,56. The experiment consisted of three sessions: a 30-min exposure 
to the open field arena, a 10-min familiarization session and a 5-min recognition 
test. On day 1, each subject was habituated to a clean, empty open field arena for 
30 min. Twenty-four hours later, each subject was returned to the open field arena 
for 10 min for the habituation phase. The mouse was then removed from the open 
field and placed in a clean temporary holding cage for approximately 2 min. Two 
identical objects were placed in the arena. Each subject was returned to the open 
field in which it had been habituated and allowed to freely explore for 10 min. 
After the familiarization session, subjects were returned to their holding cages, 
which were transferred from the testing room to a nearby holding area. The open 
field was cleaned with 70% ethanol and let dry. One clean familiar object and one 
clean novel object were placed in the arena, where the two identical objects had 
been located during in the familiarization phase. Sixty minutes after the end of 
the familiarization session, each subject was returned to its open field for a 5 min 
recognition test, during which time it was allowed to freely explore the familiar 
object and the novel object. The familiarization session and the recognition test 
were videotaped and scored with Ethovision XT videotracking software (Version 
9.0, Noldus Information Technologies, Leesburg, VA). Object investigation was 
defined as time spent sniffing the object when the nose was oriented toward the 
object and the nose–object distance was 2 cm or less. Recognition memory was 
defined as spending substantially more time sniffing the novel object than the 
familiar object. Total time spent sniffing both objects was used as a measure of 
general exploration. Time spent sniffing two identical objects during the famil-
iarization phase confirmed the lack of an innate side bias. Objects used were 
plastic toys: a small soft plastic orange safety cone and a hard plastic magnetic 
cone with ribbed sides.
Repetitive self-grooming. Spontaneous repetitive self-grooming behavior was 
scored as previously described17,49. Each mouse was placed individually into a 
standard mouse cage (46 cm long × 23.5 cm wide × 20 cm high). Cages were 
empty to eliminate digging in the bedding, which is a potentially competing 
behavior. The room was illuminated at ~40 lx. A front-mounted CCTV camera 
(Security Cameras Direct) was placed ~1 m from the cages to record the sessions. 
Sessions were videotaped for 20 min. The first 10-min period was habituation 
and was unscored. Each subject was scored for cumulative time spent grooming 
all the body regions during the second 10 min of the test session.
Repetitive marble burying. Marble burying and digging in the bedding to cover 
the marbles was measured as previously described49,57–59. Twenty black glass 
marbles (15 mm in diameter) were arranged in a symmetrical 4 × 5-cm grid on 
top of 2–3-cm deep bedding in a clean standard mouse cage (27 × 16.5 × 12.5 cm) 
 
with a filter top lid. Each mouse was placed in the center of the cage for a 30-min 
exploration period, after which the number of marbles buried was tallied by 
the investigator. ‘Buried’ was defined as greater than 50% covered by bedding58. 
Testing was performed under dim light (~15 lx).
Social approach. Social approach was tested in an automated three-chambered 
apparatus using methods similar to those previously described49,60. Automated 
Ethovision XT videotracking software (Version 9.0, Noldus Information 
Technologies, Leesburg, VA) and modified nonreflective materials for the cham-
bers were employed to maximize throughput. The updated apparatus (40 cm × 
60 cm × 23 cm) was a rectangular, three-chambered box made from matte white 
finished acrylic (P95 White, Tap Plastics, Sacramento, CA). Opaque retractable 
doors (12 cm × 33 cm) were designed to create optimal entryways between cham-
bers (5 cm × 10 cm), while providing maximal manual division of compart-
ments. Three zones, defined using the EthoVision XT software, detected time 
in each chamber for each phase of the assay. Zones were defined as the annu-
lus extending 2 cm from each novel object or novel mouse enclosure (inverted 
 
wire cup, Galaxy Cup, Kitchen Plus, https://www.spectrumdiversified.com/whs/
products/Galaxy-Pencil-Utility-Cup). Direction of the head, facing toward the 
cup enclosure, defined sniff time. A top-mounted infrared-sensitive camera 
(Ikegami ICD-49, B&H Photo, New York, NY) was positioned directly above 
every pair of three-chambered units. Infrared lighting (Nightvisionexperts.com) 
provided uniform, low-level illumination. The subject mouse was first contained 
in the center chamber for 10 min, then allowed to explore all three empty cham-
bers during a 10 min habituation session, then allowed to explore the three cham-
bers containing a novel object in one side chamber and a novel mouse in the other 
side chamber. Lack of innate side preference was confirmed during the initial 
 
10 min of habituation to the entire arena. Novel stimulus mice were 129Sv/ImJ, 
a relatively inactive strain, aged 10–14 weeks, and matched to the subject mice 
by sex. Number of entries into the side chambers served as a within-task control 
for levels of general exploratory locomotion.

Male–female social interaction. The male–female reciprocal social interaction 
test was conducted as previously described49,61. Briefly, each freely moving male 
subject was paired for 5-min with a freely moving unfamiliar estrous WT female. 
A closed-circuit television camera (Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ) was positioned at 
an angle from the Noldus PhenoTyper arena (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) for optimal 
video quality. An ultrasonic microphone (Avisoft UltraSoundGate condenser 
microphone capsule CM15; Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) was mounted 
20 cm above the cage. Sampling frequency for the microphone was 250 kHz, and 
the resolution was 16 bits. The entire apparatus was contained in a sound-attenu-
ating environmental chamber (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) under dim 
LED illumination (~10 lx). Duration of nose-to-nose sniffing, nose-to-anogenital 
sniffing and following were scored using Noldus Observer 8.0XT event recording 
software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) as previously described49. Ultrasonic vocaliza-
tion spectrograms were displayed using Avisoft software and calls were identified 
manually by a highly trained investigator blinded to genotype.
Fear conditioning. Delay contextual and cued fear conditioning was conducted 
using an automated fear-conditioning chamber (Med Associates, St Albans, VT, 
USA) as previously described62. The conditioning chamber (32 × 25 × 23 cm3, 
Med Associates) interfaced with a PC installed with VideoFreeze software (ver-
sion 1.12.0.0, Med Associates) and enclosed in a sound-attenuating cubicle. 
Training consisted of a 2-min acclimation period followed by three tone–shock 
(CS–US) pairings (80-dB tone, duration 30 s; 0.5-mA footshock, duration 1 s; 
intershock interval, 90 s) and a 2.5-min period during which no stimuli were pre-
sented. The environment was well lit (~100 lx), with a stainless steel grid floor and 
swabbed with vanilla odor cue (prepared from vanilla extract; McCormick; 1:100 
dilution). A 5-min test of contextual fear conditioning was performed 24 h after 
training, in the absence of the tone and footshock but in the presence of 100 lx 
 
overhead lighting, vanilla odor and chamber cues identical to those used on the 
training day. Cued fear conditioning, conducted 48 h after training, was assessed 
in a novel environment with distinct visual, tactile and olfactory cues. Overhead 
lighting was turned off. The cued test consisted of a 3-min acclimation period 
followed by a 3-min presentation of the tone CS and a 90-s exploration period. 
Cumulative time spent freezing in each condition was quantified by VideoFreeze 
software (Med Associates).
mRI within brains of the subjects assessed in behavioral assays. Perfusion. Mice 
from the first cohort (Chd8+/del5: 9 male, 10 female; WT: 8 male, 10 female) that 
had undergone the behavioral assays were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% to 
effect) and intracardially perfused with 30 mL of 0.1 M PBS containing 10 U/mL 
heparin (Sigma) and 2 mM ProHance (a Gadolinium contrast agent) followed 
by 30 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 2 mM ProHance63,64. Mice 
were perfused and then decapitated, and the skin, lower jaw, ears and the carti-
laginous nose tip were removed. The brain and remaining skull structures were 
incubated in 4% PFA + 2 mM ProHance overnight at 4 °C, then transferred to 
0.1 M PBS containing 2 mM ProHance and 0.02% sodium azide for at least 7 d 
before MRI scanning.
After perfusion, a multichannel 7.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Agilent Inc., Palo Alto, 
CA) was used to image the brains within their skulls. Sixteen custom-built sole-
noid coils were used to image the brains in parallel65. In order to detect volumetric 
changes via anatomical imaging, we used the following parameters for the ana-
tomical MRI scans: T2-weighted, 3-D fast spin-echo sequence, with a cylindrical 
acquisition of k-space66, a TR of 350 ms and TEs of 12 ms per echo for 6 echoes, 
field-of-view equal to 20 × 20 × 25 mm3 and matrix size equal to 504 × 504 × 
630 mm3. Our parameters output an image with 0.040-mm isotropic voxels. The 
total imaging time was 14 h.
diffusion tensor imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was done using a 
3D diffusion-weighted fast spin-echo sequence (FSE), with an echo train length 
of 6. Parameters for the DTI sequence were: TR = 270 ms, first TE = 30 ms and 
TEs of 10 ms for the remaining five echoes, 1 average. We used a field-of-view 
m(FOV) of 14 × 14 × 25 mm3 and a matrix size of 180 × 180 × 324 mm3, yielding 
an image with 0.078-mm isotropic voxels. We acquired five b = 0 s/mm2 images 
and 30 high b-value (b = 2,147 s/mm2) images in 30 different directions, using the 
Jones30 scheme67. Total imaging time was ~12 h. After acquisition, the images 
were analyzed using the FSL software package (FMRIB, Oxford UK), which was 
used to create fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity 
(AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) maps for each of the brains used in this study.
Structural mRI registration and analysis. To visualize and compare any changes 
in the mouse brains the images (or b = 0 s/mm2 images for DTI) were linearly (6 
followed by 12 parameter) and nonlinearly registered together68. Registrations 
were performed with a combination of mni_autoreg tools69 and ANTS (advanced 
normalization tools)70,71. All scans were then resampled with the appropriate 
transform and averaged to create a population atlas representing the average 
anatomy of the study sample. Note that the 40-µm anatomical images and the 
 
b = 0 s/mm2 DTI images were registered separately. The result of the registration 
was to deform all images into alignment with each other in an unbiased fash-
ion. For the volume measurements, this allowed us to analyze the deformations 
needed to take each individual mouse’s anatomy into this final atlas space, the goal 
being to model how the deformation fields relate to genotype72,73. The Jacobian 
determinants of the deformation fields were then calculated as measures of vol-
ume at each voxel. For the diffusion measurements, the registration allowed us to 
analyze the intensity differences of all measures (FA, MD, AD and RD) between 
genotypes. Significant volume changes and intensity differences could then be 
calculated by warping a pre-existing classified MRI atlas onto the population atlas, 
which allowed us to assess the volume or mean diffusion measures (FA, MD, AD 
and RD) of 159 different segmented structures, encompassing cortical lobes, large 
white matter structures (i.e., corpus callosum), ventricles, cerebellum, brain stem 
and olfactory bulbs68,74,75, in all brains. Further, these measurements could be 
examined on a voxelwise basis to localize the differences found within regions or 
across the brain. Multiple comparisons in this study were controlled for using the 
false discovery rate76. We reported combined sex results in the main text.
genomics. Bulk forebrains were microdissected from Chd8+/del5 and matched 
WT littermates at E12.5, E14.5, E17.5 and P0 and from adults (represented in 
plots as >P56). Dissection included whole forebrain hemispheres after remov-
ing surface tissue and skull for all ages except E12.5, when the anterior por-
tion of the developing head was collected. Dissections were performed blind 
to genotype. Samples included males and females of each genotype at each 
stage; exact numbers are reported in Supplementary Table 2. Total RNA was 
isolated using Ambion RNAqueous and assayed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer 
instrument. Stranded mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA kits; 6–12 samples per lane were pooled and sequenced on the 
Illumina HiSeq platform using a single-end 50-bp (E14.5, E17.5, P0 and adult) 
or paired-end 100-bp (E12.5) strategy. Each library was quantified and pooled 
before submission for sequencing. E12.5 samples were sequenced at the UC 
Berkeley Genomics Sequencing Laboratory; all other samples were sequenced 
at the UC Davis DNA Technologies Core. Reads from RNA-seq were aligned to 
the mouse genome (mm9) using STAR (version 2.4.2a)77. Aligned reads mapping 
to genes were counted at the gene level using subreads featureCounts78. The mm9 
knownGene annotation track and aligned reads were used to generate quality 
control information using the full RSeQC tool suite79. Samples that exhibited 
strong 3′ bias using geneBody_coverage.py or poor exon distribution using read_ 
distribution.py were discarded. Unaligned reads were quality checked by FastQC. 
BLAST80 was used to identify reads that mapped to either the reference or 5-bp 
and 14-bp deletion at Chd8 exon 5 to verify genotype and test for deletion allele 
transcript frequency. We performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR to val-
idate DE and DS analysis using cDNA libraries prepared using the same protocols, 
with primers reported in Supplementary Table 4. Cycle counts were normalized 
to ActB and compared via standard methods as discussed in the methods.
differential expression analysis and permutation testing. Raw count data for 
all samples were used as input along with sample infomation for differential 
expression analysis using edgeR81. Genes with at least 10 reads per million in at 
least two individual samples were included for analysis, resulting in a final set of 
11,936 genes for differential testing. Multidimensional scaling analysis indicated 
that the strongest driver of variance across samples was developmental stage, 
with no obvious separation between wild-type and Chd8+/del5 samples. Tagwise 
dispersion estimates were generated, and differential expression analysis was 
performed with edgeR81 using a generalized linear model including sex, devel-
opmental stage and sequencing run factor-based covariates and using genotype 
as the variable for testing. Stage-specific differential expression testing was also 
performed. Normalized expression levels were generated using the edgeR rpkm 
function followed by removing the sequencing batch effect via the limma remove-
BatchEffect function. Normalized log2(RPKM) values were used for plotting of

summary heatmaps and of expression data for individual genes. We examined 
DE results obtained with reduced coverage criteria for gene inclusion, which 
resulted in identification of DE genes with lower CPM but no major differences 
in overall findings.
Permutation testing was performed by testing for set inclusion between dif-
ferentially down- or upregulated genes identified in the full model and annotated 
gene sets, comparing observed with expected overlap. Observed overlap was 
calculated as the overlapping genes, whereas the expected overlap distribution 
was generated via iterative random sampling of the same number of genes as 
in the annotated gene set, followed by testing for overlap of randomly selected 
genes with DE genes. Random sampling was repeated 100,000 times, enabling 
us to estimate the mean and standard derivation of the expected distribution. 
Based on this distribution, empirical z-scores and P values were calculated for 
the observed overlap. All analysis was performed in R using custom scripts that 
are available upon request.
chIP-seq analysis. Adult mouse forebrain was dissected on ice, cross-linked 
using formaldehyde and lysed with SDS, and the DNA was sonicated on a Covaris 
instrument using standard ChIP-seq protocols adapted for mouse tissues82. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using antibodies for 
Chd8 (ab114126; Abcam). This antibody has been used for brain or neuronal 
Chd8 ChIP-seq in a previous publication12. DNA libraries of matched input and 
ChIP samples were prepared using the Nugen Ovation Ultralow Library System 
V2, indexed for multiplexed runs of four libraries per lane and sequenced on an 
Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using a single-end 50-bp strategy. Resulting 
reads were filtered to remove artifacts and low-quality sequences, and then 
mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using the BWA algorithm83.
BWA call: bwa aln -t 6 -l 25 mm9 sample.fastq.gz
We used MACS84 to identify significant peaks, disabling model-based peak 
identification and local significance testing. Peaks were called for each individual 
ChIP-seq experiment versus matched input control, as well as for merged ChIP 
and control data using MACS1.4.
MACS call: macs14 -t chip.bam–control = input.bam –name = chip_output–
format = BAM–gsize = mm–tsize = 50–bw = 300–mfold = 10,30–nolambda–
nomodel–shiftsize = 150 -p 0.0001
After peak calling, enriched regions were filtered to remove ENCODE blacklist 
regions and annotated using custom scripts. As nearly all peaks were at gene 
promoters, functional annotation was performed on the promoter-bound gene 
sets using ENRICHR85. We performed de novo motif discovery using RSAT with 
default parameters86. We additionally analyzed available Chd8 ChIP-seq data11–13. 
 
For comparison, all datasets were run through the same analysis pipeline and are 
available as UCSC TrackHubs for upload to the UCSC Genome Browser.
wgcnA. We used the WGCNA package25 in R (version 3.2.3) to construct 
signed co-expression networks using any gene expressed at an RPKM value of 
0.25 or higher in at least one sample. A correlation matrix using the biweight 
midcorrelation between all genes was computed for all relevant samples. The 
soft thresholding power was estimated and used to derive an adjacency matrix 
exhibiting approximate scale-free topology (R2 > 0.85). The adjacency matrix 
was transformed to a topological overlap matrix (TOM). The matrix 1-TOM was 
used as the input to calculate co-expression modules using hierarchical clustering. 
Modules were branches of the hierarchical cluster tree base, using the cutree-
Hybrid function in WGCNA87, with minimum module size set to 500 genes. 
Genes with positively correlated expression and high topological overlap were 
clustered together in these modules. In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficients 
were used to calculate correlation between sample traits (for example, genotype) 
and modules. The expression profile of a given module was summarized by the 
module eigengene, ME. Modules with highly correlated MEs (correlation > 0.80) 
were merged together. The module connectivity (kME) of each gene was calcu-
lated by correlating the gene expression profile with module eigengenes. Four 
modules were generated using this method and were reordered in descending 
order by gene set size and named numerically. Genes with no network correla-
tion were placed into the module M.grey. We repeated module generation using 
only wild-type samples, only Chd8+/del5 samples and with/without adult samples, 
with largely the same results as for the full sample set, which is consistent with 
the finding that most DE gene expression changes are far smaller than changes 
for genes across developmental stages.
gene ontology enrichment and protein–protein interaction network analysis. 
 
Permutation testing was performed to test for overlap between DE genes and 
published gene sets. Human Gene Ontology (GO) data was downloaded from 
Bioconductor (org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS, org.Hs.eg.db, GO.db). We used the 
TopGO88 program to test for enrichment of GO terms indicating parent:child 
relationships. For the analysis presented here, we restricted our testing to GO 
Biological Process annotations and required a minimal node size (number of 
genes annotated to GO terms) of 20. We used the internal ‘weight01’ testing 
framework and the Fisher test, a strategy recommended for gene set analysis 
that generally accounts for multiple testing comparisons. For GO analysis, we 
examined down- and upregulated genes separately, repeating the analysis on DE 
genes from the full model (cutoff of FDR < 0.20) for all genes and by expression 
module and stage-specific genes sets (cutoff of P < 0.05). For all enrichment 
analysis, the test set of DE genes was compared against the background set of 
genes expressed in our study based on minimum read-count cutoffs described 
above. Genes with expected/observed ratios of at least 1.5-fold were considered 
enriched. Heatmaps showing positive log2(expected/observed) values were plot-
ted for GO terms of interest. Protein–protein interaction enrichment and network 
generation for module-specific DE gene sets was performed using STRING27, 
considering only experimentally defined and database interactions. Only mod-
ule M.1 exhibited a significant enrichment in protein–protein interactions. We 
compared TopGO enrichment results with goseq89, correcting for gene length, 
and compared STRING protein–protein interaction with DAPPLE90, with no 
substantial differences observed for either methods comparison.
mISo analysis. The Mixture-of-Isoforms (MISO) statistical model30 was used 
to identify alternative transcript events in our RNA-seq data. For MISO analysis, 
individual aligned bam files were sorted and merged based on genotype and 
developmental stage (for example, E17.5 WT and E17.5 Chd8+/del5). One sample 
(S159) from the E17.5 Chd8+/del5 group was discarded from analysis because the 
sample had lower read coverage compared to the other samples and was signifi-
cantly impacting MISO results across genotype. Analysis was performed using the 
standard MISO software package fastmiso (https://github.com/yarden/MISO). 
Standard GFF alternate-event annotations for mm9 (version 1) were used. MISO 
was run to compute PSI scores (miso-run) using standard, unfiltered parameters. 
Comparisons (compare_miso) were run between either genotype for a specific 
stage (for example, E17.5 Chd8+/del5 versus E17.5 WT) or pairwise between WT 
stages (for example, E14.5 WT versus E17.5 WT). Results were filtered (filter_
events) based on the following parameters: –num-total = 100,–num-sum-inc-exc 
= 10,–delta-psi = 0.1,–bayes-factor = 100.
Statistical analysis. General. No statistical methods were used to predetermine 
sample sizes, with the exception of behavioral studies, but our other sample 
sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications12,13. Data collection 
and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments for 
ChIP-seq, western blots or qRT-PCR. All other data collection and analyses were 
performed blind. Data collection was randomized across litters for RNA-seq, 
western blots and histology assays. Aside from behavioral analyses, data distri-
bution was assumed to be normal and not formally tested. A Supplementary 
methods checklist is available.
Neuroanatomy, biochemistry and immunostaining. All statistical analyses and 
plots were generated using GraphPad Prism 7.0a. Two-tailed t-tests were used for 
all analyses comparing two groups. For comparisons of three or more data sets, 
one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc two-tailed t-tests were used. A minimum 
of three biological replicates (individual animals) were used for all genotypes and 
assays. For isoform-specific qPCR, comparisons across stage and genotype were 
analyzed using two-tailed Welch’s t-test and linear regression.
Behavior. Data were analyzed with Statistica software (Tulsa, OK, USA). 
 
Plots were generated using GraphPad Prism 7.0a. Sexes were considered 
 
separately, with genotype as the fixed factor. Statistical testing was performed 
using established assay-specific methods, including Student’s t-test for sin-
gle parameter comparisons between genotypes, and one-way or two-way 
repeated-measures ANOVA were used for comparisons across time points 
and/or between sexes. All significance levels were set at P < 0.05 and all t-tests 
were two-tailed. Groups sizes indicated were chosen based on past experi-
ence and power analyses. Effects of genotype and sex were evaluated using 
multifactor ANOVA, as previously published16,49,50,59,62. Significant ANOVAs

were followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference test. Behavioral analysis 
passed distribution normality tests, was collected using continuous variables 
and thus was analyzed via parametric analysis in all assays. For all behavioral 
 
analyses, variances were similar between groups and all data points within 
 
2 s.d. of the mean were included in analysis.
Genomic analyses. Samples for RNA-seq were randomly collected across litters 
and processed blind to genotype. Samples from RNA-seq were removed if they 
failed to pass quality scoring and coverage criteria. For differential gene expres-
sion analysis, differences were considered statistically significant if FDR and 
 
P values calculated by edgeR were < 0.20 and < 0.05, respectively. For ChIP-seq, 
peaks were considered significant if P values determined by MACS were < 0.0001. 
For permutation testing, enrichment was considered significant if empirical 
 
z-scores and P values were > 2 and < 0.05, respectively. For differential splicing 
analysis, individual events were considered significant if the Bayes factor > 100, 
as calculated by MISO30.

code availability. All custom scripts and TrackHubs used for data processing 
and analysis are available in Supplementary Software and at the Nord Lab Git 
Repository (https://github.com/NordNeurogenomicsLab/). A custom sample-
processing pipeline was used to align raw sequencing samples to mouse genome 
mm9 using RNA-seq aligner STAR (version 2.4.2a), features assigned via subreads 
featureCounts (version 1.5.0) to UCSC mm9 genes.gtf and quality checks per-
formed on individual samples using RSeQC (version 2.6.3). Differential expres-
sion analysis was done with a custom pipeline in R Studio using functions from 
edgeR (version 3.10.5) and limma (version 3.24.15). Permutation testing was 
performed with a custom R script. Co-expression network analysis was per-
formed with a custom pipeline following the standard WGCNA (version 3.2.3) 
workflow and functions. Gene Ontology analysis was performed with a custom 
wrapper using standard the TopGO (version 2.20.0) program. ChIP-seq data was 
aligned to mm9 via BWA (version 0.6.2) and peaks were called via MACS (ver-
sion 1.4.2). Peaks were then filtered to remove ENCODE blacklist regions and 
annotated. Comparison of enriched gene sets between RNA and ChIP-seq was 
performed using Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/). MISO analysis 
(https://github.com/yarden/MISO/) was performed using standard parameters.

Reporting Checklist for Nature Neuroscience
This checklist is used to ensure good reporting standards and to improve the reproducibility of published results. For more information, please  
read Reporting Life Sciences Research. 
� �
Please note that in the event of publication, it is mandatory that authors include all relevant methodological and statistical information in the 
manuscript. 
} Statistics reporting, by figure
�  Please specify the following information for each panel reporting quantitative data, and where each item is reported (section, e.g. Results, & 
paragraph number). �
��
��Each figure legend should ideally contain an exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, where n is an exact number and not a  �
   range, a clear definition of how n is defined (for example x cells from x slices from x animals from x litters, collected over x days), a description of  
   the statistical test used, the results of the tests, any descriptive statistics and clearly defined error bars if applicable. � 
��
�  For any experiments using custom statistics, please indicate the test used and stats obtained for each experiment.��
��
�  Each figure legend should include a statement of how many times the experiment shown was replicated in the lab; the details of sample �
   collection should be sufficiently clear so that the replicability of the experiment is obvious to the reader.� 
��
�  For experiments reported in the text but not in the figures, please use the paragraph number instead of the figure number.�
 
Note: Mean and standard deviation are not appropriate on small samples, and plotting independent data points is usually more informative.  
When technical replicates are reported, error and significance measures reflect the experimental variability and not the variability of the biological 
process; it is misleading not to state this clearly.

Where (section, paragraph #)?  
       Even if no sample size calculation was performed, authors should 
report why the sample size is adequate to measure their effect size. 
Behavioral analysis sample size is justified in Paragraph 3, Statistics. 
 
No justification of sample size is reported as power analysis is not 
standardized for RNA-seq. However, sample size per group and 
condition is equal to or greater than generally accepted standard of 
three biological replications per group. Our sample size is 
additionally sufficient for network analysis. This is reported in Para 
2, Statistics. 
 
No justification of sample size for other experiments, though 
biological replicate numbers are standard in the field and sufficient 
to capture significance and trends. This is reported in Para 1, 
Statistics.
2.   Are statistical tests justified as appropriate for every figure?  
Where (section, paragraph #)?
Behavioral analysis sample size is justified in Paragraph 3, Statistics. 
 
We use standard statistical approaches with appropriate 
corrections for each experiment.
a.    If there is a section summarizing the statistical methods in 
the methods, is the statistical test for each experiment 
clearly defined? 
Behavioral analysis statistical tests are delineated within the text in 
Paragraph 3, Statistics. 
 
For RNA-seq, yes, for each method described, in the relevant 
Methods sections. 
 
All statistical methods reported in full in the text or supplement.
b.   Do the data meet the assumptions of the specific statistical 
test you chose (e.g. normality for a parametric test)?  
Where is this described (section, paragraph #)?
Behavioral analysis data meets the assumptions of the statistical 
tests chosen. Data passed distribution normality tests, was 
collected using continuous variables and thus analyzed via 
parametric analysis, in all assays. This is described in Para 3, 
Statistics. 
 
Yes - QC performed to examine specific parameters and we used 
tests specifically designed for RNA-seq differential expression 
analysis. Additionally, we use non-parametric tests where 
necessary. This is described within the text in paragraph 1, 
subsection "RNA sequencing," of section "Methods."
c.    Is there any estimate of variance within each group of  data?  
Is the variance similar between groups that are being 
statistically compared?  
Where is this described (section, paragraph #)?
Behavioral analysis variances are similar within each group and 
between groups that are being statistically compared. This is 
described within the text in Paragraph 1 of "Behavioral Testing" in 
the "Methods". 
 
For genomics, analysis methods are designed to be robust to 
sample variance. Further, we perform QC on individual samples to 
ensure robust comparisons. This is described within the text in 
paragraph 1 of Genomics in Methods.  
 
For other analysis (e.g. qPCR and western blot), we used standard 
approaches (e.g. Student's t-test and ANOVA) in the field.
d.    Are tests specified as one- or two-sided?
Always two-sided.

e.    Are there adjustments for multiple comparisons?  
Yes for behavior. 
Yes for RNA-seq. 
Yes for MRI. 
3.    To promote transparency, Nature Neuroscience has stopped allowing 
bar graphs to report statistics in the papers it publishes. If you have 
bar graphs in your paper, please make sure to switch them to dot-
plots (with central and dispersion statistics displayed) or to box-and-
whisker plots to show data distributions.
All figures converted to show individual data points and summary/
variance measurements.
4.    Are criteria for excluding data points reported?  
Was this criterion established prior to data collection?  
Where is this described (section, paragraph #)? 
 
We followed established laboratory protocol in which all data 
points that lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean are 
included in analysis. This is described within the text in Para 3 of 
Statistics. 
 
No data points excluded in RNA-seq after original quality filtering to 
remove samples with 3' coverage bias. This is described in the 
results and methods. For MISO analysis, one sample (e17.5 S159) 
was removed before pooling samples; this is reported in Para 1 of 
Miso Analysis in Methods. 
 
For qPCR, the highest and lowest values for both WT and Chd8+/
del5 groups were removed to reduce variation. This was described 
in qRT-PCR in Methods; actual n's are listed in the figure legends. 
 
One of each sample from WT and HT in the Q-fraction analysis was 
removed; this is mention in Paragraph 1 of section "EdU labeling 
and immunofluorescent analysis" in "Methods".
5.    Define the method of randomization used to assign subjects (or 
samples) to the experimental groups and to collect and process data.   
If no randomization was used, state so.  
Where does this appear (section, paragraph #)?
Behavioral analysis was performed on mixed genotype home cages 
and blinded to experimenter and video scorer/processor. This is 
described within the text in paragraph 1 of "Nissl staining, EdU 
labeling, and immunofluorescent analysis" in Methods. 
 
For RNA-seq: samples were randomly collected across litters from 
male het x female wt and processed without knowing genotype. 
This is described in paragraph 4 of Statistics.  
 
Samples for western blot analysis were randomly collected from 
multiple litters. For all histology, samples were randomly selected 
for analysis, as described in Statistics, and additionally in methods.
6.    Is a statement of the extent to which investigator knew the group 
allocation during the experiment and in assessing outcome included?   
If no blinding was done, state so.  
Where (section, paragraph #)?
The investigator was blinded to behavioral experiments and analysis 
and to histology. This is described within the text in the first 
paragraph of subsections "Behavioral testing" and "Lamination 
Assay" in Methods.  
 
All experiments were performed blind to genotype ("Results" 
section, paragraph 1), unless denoted otherwise in Methods.
7.    For experiments in live vertebrates, is a statement of compliance with 
ethical guidelines/regulations included?  
Where (section, paragraph #)?
A statement of compliance with ethical guidelines and regulations is 
included in both the methods and subsection "Behavioral testing" of 
Methods.
