BACKGROUND: Studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death 
(SCD) use emergency medical services records, death certificates, or definitions 
that infer cause of death; thus, the true incidence of SCD is unknown. Over 90% 
of SCDs occur out-of-hospital; nonforensic autopsies are rarely performed, and 
therefore causes of death are presumed. We conducted a medical examiner–based 
investigation to determine the precise incidence and autopsy-defined causes of all 
SCDs in an entire metropolitan area. We hypothesized that postmortem investigation 
would identify actual sudden arrhythmic deaths among presumed SCDs.
METHODS: Between February 1, 2011, and March 1, 2014, we prospectively 
identified all incident deaths attributed to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
(emergency medical services primary impression, cardiac arrest) between 18 to 
90 years of age in San Francisco County for autopsy, toxicology, and histology via 
medical examiner surveillance of consecutive out-of-hospital deaths, all reported 
by law. We obtained comprehensive records to determine whether out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest deaths met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for 
SCD. We reviewed death certificates filed quarterly for missed SCDs. Autopsy-
defined sudden arrhythmic deaths had no extracardiac cause of death or acute 
heart failure. A multidisciplinary committee adjudicated final cause.
RESULTS: All 20 
440 deaths were reviewed; 12 
671 were unattended and reported 
to the medical examiner. From these, we identified 912 out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest deaths; 541 (59%) met WHO SCD criteria (mean 62.8 years, 69% male) 
and 525 (97%) were autopsied. Eighty-nine additional WHO-defined SCDs 
occurred within 3 weeks of active medical care with the death certificate signed 
by the attending physician, ineligible for autopsy but included in the countywide 
WHO-defined SCD incidence of 29.6/100 
000 person-years, highest in black 
men (P<0.0001). Of 525 WHO-defined SCDs, 301 (57%) had no cardiac history. 
Leading causes of death were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose (13.5%), 
cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and neurological (5.5%). 
Autopsy-defined sudden arrhythmic deaths were 55.8% (293/525) of overall, 65% 
(78/120) of witnessed, and 53% (215/405) of unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs 
(P=0.024); 286 of 293 (98%) had structural cardiac disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest 
were not sudden or unexpected, and nearly half of presumed SCDs were not 
arrhythmic. These findings have implications for the accuracy of SCDs as defined 
by WHO criteria or emergency medical services records in aggregate mortality 
data, clinical trials, and cohort studies.

S
udden cardiac death (SCD) is considered a ma-
jor cause of worldwide mortality, yet incidence 
estimates vary widely because of variable data 
sources and definitions.1,2 Studies based on death cer-
tificate review are known to overestimate incidence be-
cause of inaccuracies in stated causes of death,3 and 
investigations relying on emergency medical services 
(EMS) records4 and epidemiological definitions5–7 pre-
sume cardiac etiology or infer cardiac cause of death. 
Expert panels have advocated for the use of precise and 
uniform definitions of SCD and to integrate multiple 
sources of ascertainment,8 but noncardiac and nonar-
rhythmic conditions leading to sudden death cannot be 
excluded without a complete autopsy.9
The large majority of SCDs occur out of hospital10; 
therefore, they are unattended and in the jurisdiction of 
the coroner or medical examiner. Postmortem investiga-
tion after these natural deaths is not routine coroner or 
medical examiner practice because of limited local re-
sources that are focused on accidental or possible criminal 
deaths. Therefore, autopsy rates for out-of-hospital natu-
ral deaths range from 10% in the United States11 to 23% 
in some European countries.12 Moreover, three-quarters of 
the 82 sudden arrhythmic deaths (SADs) that were the 
basis for the original Hinkle-Thaler definition did not have 
autopsy confirmation.6 Exemplar autopsy studies dem-
onstrating coronary artery disease (CAD) as the cause of 
≈80% of SCDs13,14 are thus limited by referral bias of the 
minority of total SCDs that underwent postmortem inves-
tigation. We sought to determine the precise incidence 
and underlying causes of all incident SCDs in San Fran-
cisco County, California via prospective medical examiner 
surveillance and comprehensive postmortem investigation 
as part of the San Francisco POST SCD Study (Postmortem 
Systematic Investigation of Sudden Cardiac Death).
METHODS
The authors declare that all supporting data and analytic 
methods are available within the article and in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Setting
The study population included all residents and inhabitants of 
San Francisco County, California (population: 805 
235, 46.9 
square miles).15 Ten adult hospitals, 3 EMS agencies (with the 
San Francisco Fire Department responding to >85% of all 911 
activations), and a single Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 
serve the County. All out-of-hospital and unattended deaths 
must be reported to the medical examiner by California state 
law. The study was approved by the University of California, San 
Francisco institutional review board and had additional institu-
tional review board approval at all 10 San Francisco County 
adult hospitals and 3 EMS agencies to obtain medical records.
Inclusion Criteria
SCD was defined by World Health Organization (WHO) cri-
teria (WHO-defined SCD): sudden unexpected death either 
within 1 hour of symptom onset (event witnessed), or within 
24 hours of having been observed alive and symptom free 
(unwitnessed).7 Subjects otherwise meeting WHO criteria 
who had recent admission for myocardial infarction were 
included. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) required an 
EMS primary impression of cardiac arrest, consistent with the 
Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES).4 OHCA 
deaths were defined as (1) OHCA victims who died in the 
field or emergency department if the event was witnessed or 
active resuscitation was performed; or (2) unwitnessed natu-
ral deaths if the victim was last observed alive and symptom 
free within 24 hours, with no active resuscitation but primary 
EMS impression of cardiac arrest. Resuscitated OHCA victims 
surviving to hospital admission, whether they subsequently 
died as an inpatient or survived, were considered OHCA sur-
vivors rather than SCDs.
The following deaths were excluded: (1) subjects with 
severe noncardiac chronic and terminal illness in which immi-
nent death was not unexpected, including terminal cancer; 
(2) end-stage renal disease on dialysis; (3) hospice residents; 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In this prospective countywide autopsy study of 
all deaths attributed to stated cardiac arrest and 
presumed sudden cardiac deaths over 37 months, 
40% were found to have a nonsudden, noncardiac 
cause of death.
• Only half (55.8%) of sudden cardiac deaths defined 
by conventional criteria were autopsy-defined sud-
den arrhythmic deaths.
• Sudden death was the first manifestation of car-
diac disease for over half of all autopsy-defined 
sudden arrhythmic deaths.
• Leading causes of presumed sudden cardiac deaths 
were coronary disease (32%), occult overdose 
(13.5%), cardiomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertro-
phy (8%), and neurological (5.5%).
• Ninety-eight percent of sudden arrhythmic deaths 
had structural heart disease at autopsy.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Cardiac arrests defined by paramedic criteria and 
sudden cardiac deaths defined by conventional or 
retrospective methods, as in most cohort studies 
or clinical trials, have limited accuracy for actual 
arrhythmic deaths.
• These data reflect the decreasing prevalence of 
coronary disease and increasing prevalence of 
nonischemic causes; therefore, further inroads 
into reducing the overall burden of sudden death 
requires investigation and earlier recognition of 
nonischemic and nonarrhythmic causes.
• In contrast to sudden death in the young, the vast 
majority of sudden arrhythmic death in adults is 
associated with structural heart disease.

at presentation, including evidence of drug abuse/overdose at

life-threatening trauma, homicide, or suicide; (5) subjects 
who had hospital admission within the prior 30 days for non-
cardiac illness or surgical procedure.
Prospective Surveillance and 
Identification of WHO-Defined SCDs
From February 1, 2011, to March 1, 2014, we performed 
daily surveillance of all consecutive San Francisco County out-
of-hospital deaths. Each morning, EMS records and medical 
examiner investigator scene reports of all unattended (not 
under the care of a physician within 3 weeks for an active 
medical condition) out-of-hospital deaths from the previous 
day were reviewed by a cardiac electrophysiologist (Z.H.T.) 
and the Assistant Medical Examiner (E.M.) to identify all 
OHCA deaths, 18 to 90 years of age, for detailed autopsy, 
including toxicology and histology. All OHCA deaths under-
went a full autopsy (described below), except in rare cases 
where the family objected to autopsy. We obtained compre-
hensive medical records from the 10 San Francisco County 
adult hospitals and EMS records for all cases. Out-of-county 
medical records were also obtained.
Subjects under the care of a physician within 3 weeks of 
death (ie, office visit for active medical condition or inpa-
tient care) are considered attended by the medical examiner. 
Under these circumstances, the attending physician is con-
tacted by the forensic investigator and asked to infer cause 
of death to sign the death certificate; once the death cer-
tificate is signed, these attended deaths are no longer in 
the jurisdiction of the medical examiner and are therefore 
ineligible for autopsy. We interviewed each attending physi-
cian who signed a death certificate and reviewed EMS and 
complete medical records to determine whether any such 
attended deaths met criteria for WHO-defined SCDs; those 
meeting criteria were included in WHO-defined SCD inci-
dence calculations but not autopsied. To determine total San 
Francisco County mortality and to ascertain for any WHO-
defined SCDs missed, we retrieved and reviewed all county 
death certificates quarterly for location, death certificate–
stated cause of death, and circumstances of death by foren-
sic investigator reports to cross-check with cases obtained 
via medical examiner surveillance.
Postmortem Investigation
All identified OHCA deaths, except the rare cases that did 
not receive next-of-kin agreement, underwent complete 
external and internal postmortem examination performed 
by a single board-certified forensic pathologist (Assistant 
Medical Examiner E.M.) according to a prospectively devel-
oped protocol for examining all cavities and tissues includ-
ing thorough heart and brain examinations.16 Every autopsy 
was further reviewed in full by a cardiac pathologist and the 
chief of the University of California, San Francisco Autopsy 
Service (P.C.U.).
Cardiac Examinations
Hearts were excised, weighed, and dissected system-
atically before careful examination for gross evidence of 
cardiovascular pathology including acute myocardial infarc-
tion or scar denoting healed myocardial infarction. The major 
extramural coronary arteries were cut in cross section every 
5 mm to identify atherosclerotic plaques, thrombi, dissect-
ing hematomas, or other stenoses. In addition to samples of 
coronary artery lesions, samples of myocardium for histology 
were taken from 5 standard locations: septum, posterobasal, 
lateral, midanterior left ventricular free wall, and right ven-
tricular free wall. An extra section of the high septum was 
also taken for histological examination of the conduction 
system. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin and trichrome and independently examined by 2 
pathologists (E.M. and P.C.U.).
Examination of Other Organs and Tissues 
A comprehensive examination of the internal organs of the 
thorax, abdomen, and cranial vault were performed accord-
ing to established autopsy methods.17 Complete details of 
the autopsy procedure are provided in the online-only Data 
Supplement Appendix.
Postmortem vitreous chemistries (electrolytes, creatinine, 
urea nitrogen, and glucose) were obtained for all subjects. 
Toxicology (blood and urine) was obtained for all subjects 
≤75 years and for subjects ≥75 years without obvious cause 
of death (eg, acute myocardial infarction, intracranial hem-
orrhage, saddle pulmonary embolus) on gross examination 
at autopsy.
Cardiac implantable electronic device interrogation was 
performed on all cases with a permanent pacemaker or 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Terminal rhythm 
was determined from device interrogation, correlating events 
stored on the device with the timing of the arrest from EMS 
documentation and medical examiner scene investigation.18
Adjudication of Inclusion and Cause of 
Death
A multidisciplinary committee including the Assistant Medical 
Examiner (E.M.), a cardiac pathologist (P
.C.U.), a neurolo-
gist (A.S.K.), and 2 cardiologists/cardiac electrophysiolo-
gists (J.E.O. and Z.H.T.) reviewed comprehensive premortem 
medical records, forensic investigator reports (including scene 
investigations, and witness and next-of-kin interviews), EMS 
records, medication prescriptions, and detailed autopsy, toxi-
cology, and histology findings for all OHCA deaths to deter-
mine whether they met criteria for a WHO-defined SCD and 
to adjudicate a single final cause of death. Autopsy-defined 
SAD was a death for which no identifiable nonarrhythmic 
cause of death was found (eg, acute cerebrovascular acci-
dent, viscus perforation, tamponade, vascular rupture, pul-
monary embolism, hemorrhage, lethal toxicology/occult 
overdose, acute heart failure with pulmonary edema), but 
may have had underlying or associated cardiac disease. Per 
usual forensic toxicology protocol, lethal serum or tissue levels 
(ie, ethanol levels >0.5 mg/L, opiates >0.3 mg/L) were used in 
the absence of other pathological findings that could explain 
sudden death as evidence for occult overdose as the cause of 
death.19,20 For WHO-defined SCDs with pathological evidence 
of chronic ethanol or opiate/heroin use (ie, hepatic findings, 
needle track marks), higher lethal thresholds (ethanol >0.7 
mg/L, opiates >0.5 mg/L) were used.

Statistical Analysis
The characteristics of the study sample were summarized 
using proportions. For between-group comparisons, we 
used χ2 and Fisher exact tests as appropriate. To make the 
525 WHO-defined SCDs with autopsy representative of 
the demographic and risk factor distribution of the overall 
set of 630 WHO-defined SCDs, we used inverse probabil-
ity weights, based on a logistic model using demographics 
and risk factors to predict having an autopsy. The resulting 
weights were used to estimate the proportion of autopsy-
defined SADs among all SCD cases, with or without autopsy. 
Incidence of autopsy-defined SAD was estimated using per-
son-time methods, and compared across demographic sub-
groups using Poisson models. Analyses used Stata Version 
14.2 (StataCorp LP). A 2-tailed P < 0.05 was considered sta-
tistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 20 440 deaths occurred in San Francisco 
County during the 37-month study period (Figure 1). 
Of these, 12 671 out-of-hospital, emergency depart-
ment, and unexpected inpatient deaths were report-
ed to the medical examiner: 2021 were due to non-
natural (eg, trauma, homicide) causes, 2012 did not 
meet age criteria, and 3862 were inpatient, nursing 
home, or hospice deaths (Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). The medical examiner considered 
1120 reported out-of-hospital deaths as attended 
deaths because of active medical care within 3 weeks, 
thus out of medical examiner jurisdiction and ineli-
gible for autopsy. Of these, 89 (7.9%) met criteria 
for WHO-defined SCD after comprehensive records 
review and interviews with the attending or treat-
ing physicians who signed the death certificate. Via 
prospective daily surveillance of the remaining 3656 
unattended out-of-hospital deaths, we identified 912 
deaths attributed to OHCA with primary EMS impres-
sion of cardiac arrest. Next-of-kin of 16 subjects with 
(2%) OHCA deaths declined autopsy for religious 
reasons; thus, 896 subjects with (98%) OHCA deaths 
underwent the protocol autopsy. At adjudication, of 
the 896 OHCA deaths, 371 (41%) did not meet WHO 
criteria for SCD (ie, were not sudden or unexpected, 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement), leaving 
525 adjudicated autopsied WHO-defined SCDs dur-
ing the study period. Thus, we identified 630 (525 
autopsied + 16 declined autopsy + 89 under recent 
medical care) WHO-defined SCDs over 37 months for 
a countywide WHO SCD incidence of 29.6/100 000 
person-years, accounting for 3.4% (630/18,443) 
of total adult mortality. Autopsy rates were 98.2% 
(896/912) for OHCA deaths and 83.3% (525/630) for 
WHO-defined SCDs.
Mean age of the 525 autopsied WHO-defined 
SCDs was 62.8 years, 69% were male and reflected 
the diverse population of San Francisco County; half 
were in the lowest income tertile (Table 121). WHO-
defined SCDs without autopsy (n=105, most of whom 
had received recent medical care) were a decade older 
(mean age, 73.1 years) and more likely to be Asian 
(P=0.0013).
Autopsy-Defined Causes of Death
Autopsy-defined SADs that in 98% of patients oc-
curred in the setting of structural heart disease ac-
counted for 55.8% (293/525), nonarrhythmic cardi-
ac causes of death 4.2% (22/525), and noncardiac 
causes of death 40% (210/525) of all WHO-defined 
SCDs (Figure 2A). Leading autopsy-defined causes of 
death for WHO-defined SCDs were coronary artery 
disease (CAD, 32%), occult overdose (13.5%), car-
diomyopathy (10%), cardiac hypertrophy (8%), and 
neurological (5.5%). Of 168 cases with CAD causes, 
one-third (52 cases) had postmortem findings of 
acute CAD (35 with acute coronary lesion, 17 with 
histological evidence of acute myocardial infarction). 
Of 17 cases with pacemaker or ICD, 4 were adjudicat-
ed to have device concern (3: undersensing, software 
error, inappropriate device selection) or hardware 
failure (1). Occult overdose (n=71) was the leading 
noncardiac cause of death for WHO-defined SCDs. 
Lethal toxicological levels of opiates were found in 
61% (43/71) of the occult overdoses; all these SCDs 
had a primary EMS impression of cardiac arrest and 
none had evidence or suspicion of drug use at the 
scene. The second largest group of noncardiac cause 
of death for WHO-defined SCDs was sudden neuro-
logical deaths, which included acute cerebrovascular 
accident, intracranial hemorrhage, and sudden unex-
plained death in epilepsy.15
Of the 371 OHCA deaths excluded as nonsudden 
at adjudication, 142 were autopsy-defined SAD (Figure 
I in the online-only Data Supplement); therefore, less 
than half of 896 deaths with EMS primary impression 
of cardiac arrest in the study period were autopsy-de-
fined SAD ([142 nonsudden+293 meeting WHO crite-
ria])/896=48.6%).
The proportion of total WHO-defined SCDs at-
tributable to autopsy-defined SAD was significantly 
greater in witnessed (78/120=65.0%) versus unwit-
nessed cases (215/405=53.1%, P=0.024; Figure 2B), 
and in men (220/362=60.8%) in comparison with 
women (73/163=44.8%, P=0.0006). Autopsy-de-
fined SADs accounted for a similar proportion of 
WHO-defined SCDs age 18 to 39 (19/32, 59%) ver-
sus age ≥40 (274/493, 56%, P=0.68; Figure 2C). Pre-
sumed cause of death as stated by the attending or 
treating physicians on the death certificate was car-
diac for 101 of the 105 WHO-defined SCDs that did 
not undergo autopsy (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement).

Incidence of Autopsy-Defined SAD
Countywide incidence of autopsy-defined SAD, weight-
ed to account for the 105 (16.7%) WHO-defined SCDs 
not autopsied, was 17/100 
000 person-years (Figure 3). 
Incidence rates for WHO-defined SCD and autopsy-
defined SAD were >2- and 3-fold higher in men ver-
sus women, respectively (P<0.0001), highest in blacks 
(P>0.0001), and lowest in Hispanics (P=0.0018). Blacks 
and Hispanics had the lowest proportion of autopsy-
defined SADs, at 44.6% and 54.8%, respectively.

Identification of WHO-defined SCDs via active medical examiner surveillance of all out-of-hospital deaths in San Francisco County 
February 1, 2011, to March 1, 2014. County death certificates for every death were reviewed for location, circumstances, and cause 
of death. EMS records and forensic investigator reports were reviewed for all out-of-hospital natural deaths between the ages of 18 
and 90 years. All OHCA deaths referred for autopsy underwent comprehensive review of medical records and medical examiner re-
cords, and those meeting WHO criteria underwent full adjudication. A total of 20 
440 deaths occurred in San Francisco County dur-
ing the 37-month study period (Figure 1). Of these, 12 
671 out-of-hospital, ED, and unexpected inpatient deaths were reported to 
the medical examiner: 2021 were due to nonnatural (eg, trauma, homicide) causes, 2012 did not meet age criteria, 3862 were inpa-
tient, nursing home, or hospice deaths (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). The medical examiner considered 1120 reported 
out-of-hospital deaths as attended deaths because of active medical care within 3 weeks; thus, out of medical examiner jurisdiction 
and ineligible for autopsy. Of these, 89 (7.9%) met criteria for WHO-defined SCD after comprehensive records review and interviews 
with the attending or treating physicians who signed the death certificate (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Via prospec-
tive daily surveillance of the remaining 3656 unattended out-of-hospital deaths, we identified 912 OHCA deaths with primary EMS 
impression of cardiac arrest. Next-of-kin of 16 (2%) subjects with OHCA deaths declined autopsy for religious reasons; thus, 896 
(98%) subjects with OHCA deaths underwent the protocol autopsy. At adjudication, 371 OHCA deaths did not meet WHO criteria 
for SCD, leaving 525 adjudicated autopsied WHO-defined SCDs during the study period. Thus we identified 630 (525 autopsied + 
16 declined autopsy + 89 under recent medical care) WHO-defined SCDs over 37, accounting for 3.4% (630/18 
443) of total adult 
mortality. Autopsy rates were 98.2% (896/912) for OHCA deaths and 83.3% (525/630) for WHO-defined SCDs. DC indicates death

Impact of Prior Medical History
Comprehensive past medical records were obtained for 
94% (492/525) of all WHO-defined SCDs; 24 WHO-de-
fined SCDs (5%) were known to be previously healthy 
with no medical conditions, with similar proportions in 
autopsy-defined SAD and non-SAD groups (Table 2). 
Less than half of WHO-defined SCDs (224/525, 43%) 
had prior cardiac history, with a similar proportion in 
autopsy-defined SADs (131/293, 45%) and non-SADs 
(93/232, 40%); therefore, sudden death was the first 
manifestation of cardiac disease for more than half of 
all adult WHO-defined SCDs (301/525, 57%) and au-
topsy-defined SADs (162/293, 55%) in San Francisco 
County. History of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and 
congestive heart failure was more common in autopsy-
defined SADs, whereas history of seizure disorder, psy-
chiatric disorder, alcohol abuse, and illicit drug use was 
more common in non-SADs (Table 2).
Presenting Rhythm and Symptoms
Initial rhythm at EMS arrival was asystole for nearly all 
405 unwitnessed WHO-defined SCDs, whereas ven-
tricular fibrillation (VF) and asystole each accounted for 
one-third and pulseless electric activity 13% of the 120 
witnessed WHO-defined SCDs (Figure II in the online-
only Data Supplement). For the witnessed WHO-de-
fined SCDs, mean time to EMS arrival was similar for all 
rhythms (P=0.34, Figure III in the online-only Data Sup-
plement). Ventricular tachycardia (VT)/VF predicted au-
topsy-defined SAD (39/43, 91%) and pulseless electric 
activity non-SAD (13/15, 87%, P<0.001 for both, Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). The proportions 
of autopsy-defined SAD versus non-SAD were similar 
for all other rhythms. Two-thirds of WHO-defined SCDs 
and autopsy-defined SCDs presented suddenly with 
no known symptoms (Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
DISCUSSION
In the POST SCD study, capturing nearly all deaths at-
tributed to stated OHCA and presumed SCDs in an 
entire ethnically diverse metropolitan area over 37 
months, 40% of OHCA deaths were not sudden and 
only half (55.8%) of SCDs defined by conventional 
epidemiological criteria were proven to be SAD after 
postmortem investigation. We leveraged the medi-
colegal authority of the county medical examiner for 
complete prospective surveillance of all out-of-hospi-
tal deaths, which are reported as mandated by state 
law, to initially identify OHCA deaths as defined by 
CARES criteria for comprehensive autopsy. We then 
obtained EMS and comprehensive medical records 
to refine these to WHO-defined SCDs and adjudicate 
their causes of death with pre- and postmortem data. 
Although we have previously demonstrated the high 
fidelity of medical examiner surveillance for WHO-de-
fined SCDs in San Francisco,16 in this investigation we

Estimates of the annual incidence of OHCA and SCD 
vary widely depending on data sources for case ascertain-
ment, the definitions used, and the methods employed. 
Indeed, SCD incidence rates in San Francisco would be 
>50% higher if CARES OHCA criteria rather than the 
WHO definition were used. Restricted to WHO-defined 
cases, SCD incidence in San Francisco is notably lower 
than contemporaneous estimates,8 which may be because 
of the exclusion of OHCA survivors and the diverse source 
population. Postmortem investigation then allowed us to 
further refine SCD incidence to autopsy-defined SAD inci-
dence, approximately half that using the WHO definition.
Death certificates are known to overestimate SCD 
rates,3 and the cause of death on death certificates is 
often unreliable22 because nonforensic autopsies are 
rarely performed11 and protocols and guidelines for au-
topsies in suspected SCDs vary widely. Noncardiac con-
ditions that occur rapidly, such as vascular or viscus rup-
ture, hemorrhage, or pulmonary embolism, cannot be 
excluded without a full autopsy, and the recent Ameri-
can Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/
Heart Rhythm Society guideline on SCD prevention 
includes recommendations on postmortem evaluation 
of SCD.23 Autopsy rates of SCDs in community-based 
cohorts and clinical trials range from 11% to 27%,3,6,24 
reflecting typical forensic practice of low priority for 
natural deaths. A recent medical examiner–based study 
in Hennepin County, MN, reported an apparent 62% 
autopsy rate of 71 SCDs aged 25 to 59 over 3 years; 
however, 580 potential sudden deaths with existing 
illness that did not undergo autopsy were excluded; 
thus, the calculated SCD incidence was only 15% of 
expected.25 If these uninvestigated sudden deaths were 
included, the actual autopsy rate was 10%. In San Fran-
cisco County before the prospective POST SCD study, 
the prevailing medical examiner autopsy rate was 43% 
of WHO-defined SCDs16; in the present study, autopsy 
rates were doubled to 83% of WHO-defined SCDs and 
98% of OHCA deaths ages 18 to 90.
We performed vitreous chemistries in all subjects, 
and blood and urine toxicology for subjects <75 years 
or ≥75 years that did not have an obvious cause of 
death on gross examination. Lethal levels of opiates 
were the culprit in over half of the 71 WHO-defined 
SCDs found to be due to occult overdose, a reflection 
of the ongoing US opioid epidemic, urban, suburban, 
and rural alike.26 Because none of the WHO-defined 
SCDs found to be due to occult overdose had evidence 
or suspicion of drug use at the scene and all had a pri-
mary EMS impression of cardiac arrest; overdoses and 
other metabolic emergencies may be underrecognized 
as underlying causes of sudden death.
Our results confirm substantial racial and sex dif-
ferences in contemporary SCD epidemiology. Rates 
of WHO-defined SCD and autopsy-defined SAD were 
highest in blacks and lowest in Hispanics, whereas the 
proportion of WHO-defined SCD attributable to autop-
sy-defined SAD in both populations was significantly 
lower than for whites. We found significant differences 
in the distribution of noncardiac causes and marked sex 
differences: autopsy-defined SAD accounted for 61% 
of WHO-defined SCDs in men but only 45% in women. 
These findings reinforce the importance of SCD investi-
gations in women and diverse populations.
Although a central tenet of SCD epidemiology is that 
CAD accounts for ≈80% of SCDs,9,27 autopsy studies 
supporting this premise were limited by referral bias of 
the minority of community sudden deaths referred for 
postmortem investigation.13 In contrast, our study re-
flects the contemporary epidemiology and underlying 
causes of nearly every incident SCD in San Francisco, 
and confirms recent secular trends of the decreasing 
prevalence of CAD28 and increasing prevalence of non-
ischemic causes. Indeed, the classic presentation of 
acute coronary lesion or pathological evidence of acute 
myocardial infarction leading to arrhythmic death was 
found in only 10% of WHO-defined SCDs overall and 
18% of autopsy-defined SADs. A third of autopsy-de-

fined SADs were attributable to nonischemic cardiomy-
opathies and cardiac hypertrophy without histological 
evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We have 
recently reported on sudden neurological deaths15 and 
cardiac implantable electronic device concerns18 as pre-
viously unrecognized causes of presumed SCD. Cardiac 
nonarrhythmic causes (eg, heart failure with pulmonary 
edema, tamponade) also accounted for 4% of SCDs. 
Therefore, because SAD is the only phenotype of SCD 
rescued by automated external defibrillators and ICDs 
and the intended focus of genetic association and risk 
studies of SCD, it is essential to distinguish SAD from 
nonarrhythmic causes of SCD.
Although many of the SCDs initially found in asysto-
le may have started as VT/VF, mean EMS response times 
for witnessed cases were similar across all rhythms. An 
initial rhythm of VT/VF was highly specific (91%) yet not 
perfectly predictive for autopsy-defined SAD. For exam-
ple, ICD documentation and treatment of VF did not 
always represent definitive evidence of SAD: a 59-year-

Adjusted incidence rates per 100 
000 person-years for all observed OHCA deaths, WHO-defined SCDs, and autopsy-defined 
SADs in San Francisco County from February 1, 2011, to March 1, 2014. Adult countywide incidence rates of OHCA death 
and WHO-defined SCD over 37 months were 46/100 
000 and 29.6/100 
000 person-years, respectively. OHCA death and 
WHO-defined SCD incidence rates both include the 89 identified WHO-defined SCDs that were considered attended by the 
medical examiner (because of recent medical care <3 weeks before death) and 16 OHCA deaths that did not undergo autopsy. 
After comprehensive records review and adjudication, 371 OHCA deaths initially identified by CARES OHCA criteria were ex-
cluded as not meeting WHO SCD criteria at presentation. Sex- and race-specific incidence rate ratios (IRR) for all WHO-defined 
SCD and weighted autopsy-defined SAD are shown. Weighted countywide incidence of autopsy-defined SAD was 17/100 
000 
person-years, accounting for the 89 WHO-defined SCDs without autopsy. Autopsy-defined SAD accounted for a weighted 
proportion of 57.4% of all WHO SCDs. Incidence rate ratios for WHO SCD and autopsy-defined SAD were over 2- and 3-fold 
higher in men versus women, respectively (P<0.0001), and highest in blacks (P>0.0001), lowest in Hispanics (P=0.0018). 
Blacks (45%) and Hispanics (54.6%) had the lowest proportion of WHO-defined SCDs that were autopsy-defined SADs. Other

old man with heart failure, ICD, and unwitnessed SCD 
was found to have a large subarachnoid hemorrhage 
that caused neurocardiogenic VF.15 Pulseless electric 
activity was found in 13% of witnessed cases, and a 
2013 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute work-
shop identified this condition as an SCD research pri-
ority, in part, because of its lower survival versus VT/
VF.29 This may be explained by the fact that 87% of 
cases presenting with pulseless electric activity were at-
tributable to nonarrhythmic and noncardiac causes of 
death; therefore, further inroads into reducing the pub-
lic health burden of sudden death requires investigation 
and earlier recognition of nonarrhythmic causes.
Prior studies have typically identified SCD outcomes 
retrospectively, relying on death certificates or ex post 
facto retrieval of event and medical records and ap-
plication of WHO or Hinkle-Thaler criteria to deter-
mine underlying cause.3,30–32 The WHO-defined SCDs 
and autopsy-defined SADs in this report represent 
the entirety of these deaths in the community over a 
3-year period. The positive predictive value of WHO 
SCD criteria for autopsy-defined SAD was 55.8% in 
the POST SCD Study. Because approximately half of 
deaths attributed to OHCA and WHO-defined SCDs 
were found to be nonarrhythmic after postmortem 
examination, it is difficult to identify SCDs with a high 
degree of accuracy by using conventional methods; 
therefore, one may consider deaths meeting WHO 
criteria as sudden deaths rather than as sudden car-
diac deaths. Although comprehensive autopsies are 
not practical in most clinical trials and population, ob-
servational, or molecular association studies, under-
standing the limits of current criteria used to define 
SCD is important for interpreting the results.

This study has several limitations. Standardized inves-
tigations and prospective premortem data collection as 
done in cohort studies were not possible in the popu-
lation-based POST SCD study. However, we collected all 
available premortem data for nearly every WHO-defined 
SCD; therefore, these records reflect typical population 
medical care in the entire metropolitan area. Although 
the population of the United States is rapidly diversifying 
with no majority ethnicity projected by the US Census 
Bureau by 2043,33 our findings in a diverse area such as 
San Francisco may not be entirely generalizable to other 
populations. Despite evaluating more comprehensive 
data per SCD than any other study to date, the exact 
cause of death sometimes remains unclear and is sub-
ject to interpretation. Similar to many other SCD cohorts 
and studies, we included unwitnessed sudden deaths, 
for which the timeline of suddenness is less certain. Con-
versely, an unknown number of solitary deaths that may 
have been sudden could have been missed by our criteria 
because no witnesses were available to verify that the 
victim had been alive and well within 24 hours. There-
fore, although we have demonstrated the limited speci-
ficity and positive predictive value of the WHO criteria for 
autopsy-defined SAD, the sensitivity of WHO criteria for 
all SADs in San Francisco is unknown. Although some 
studies may include resuscitated OHCA victims with sub-
stantial hemodynamic or neurological sequelae as SCDs, 
these cases were considered OHCA survivors rather than 
SCDs because they did not die suddenly. Because the 
medical examiner considered a patient who died within 
3 weeks of physician care attended, OHCAs in such pa-
tients may have been missed, although we confirmed 
that >90% of these deaths were not sudden. Last, our 
protocol did not include genetic testing, which may be 
helpful for unexplained SCDs with negative autopsy, ac-
counting for up to 40% of SCDs in pediatric/young adult 
populations.34 However, nearly all adult SCDs in POST 
SCD had an identifiable gross, histological, or toxicologi-
cal cause of death; therefore, genetic testing may have 
helped identify the underlying cause for only the 7 cases 
(1.3%) that may be considered unexplained (primary 
electric disease with negative autopsy).
In conclusion, in this prospective postmortem in-
vestigation of nearly all out-of-hospital WHO-defined 
SCDs in an entire ethnically diverse metropolitan area, 
just over half of presumed SCDs were actually autop-
sy-defined SAD. These data provide an unbiased, re-
al-world picture of the contemporary epidemiology, 
burden, and underlying causes of sudden death in the 
community, and have implications for the accuracy of 
SCDs and aggregate mortality data as defined by death 
certificates or conventional criteria in clinical trials and 
cohort studies. Our methods may also provide an out-
line for medical examiner or coroner protocols for the 
systematic examination of these out-of-hospital natural 
deaths, which are rarely investigated in the community.
