Abstract
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is large, complex and uniquely able to orchestrate 
gastrointestinal behaviour independently of the central nervous system (CNS). An intact ENS is 
essential for life and ENS dysfunction is often linked to digestive disorders. The part the ENS 
plays in neurological disorders, as a portal or participant, has also become increasingly evident. 
ENS structure and neurochemistry resemble that of the CNS, therefore pathogenic mechanisms 
that give rise to CNS disorders might also lead to ENS dysfunction, and nerves that interconnect 
the ENS and CNS can be conduits for disease spread. We review evidence for ENS dysfunction in 
the aetiopathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, transmissible 
spongiform encephalopathies, Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Animal models suggest 
that common pathophysiological mechanisms account for the frequency of gastrointestinal 
comorbidity in these conditions. Moreover, the neurotropic pathogen, varicella zoster virus (VZV), 
unexpectedly establishes latency in enteric and other autonomic neurons that do not innervate skin. 
VZV reactivation in these neurons produces no rash and is therefore a clandestine cause of 
gastrointestinal disease, meningitis and strokes. The gut–brain alliance has raised consciousness as 
a contributor to health, but a gut–brain axis that contributes to disease merits equal attention.
The gut is a complicated organ1. A byzantine array of events is required for digestion and 
absorption to be successful. Muscular sphincters compartmentalize the bowel, dividing it 
into functionally distinct regions with radically different luminal environments. Neuronal 
monitoring of luminal contents permits ingested material to be transported aborally at a rate 
that allows each compartment to accomplish its task2. Contractions by smooth muscle (along 
the entire gastrointestinal tract) and skeletal muscle (in the oesophagus and anus) are thus 
choreographed into activity patterns, such as churning (in the stomach), segmentation (in the 
small intestine), or haustration (in the colon) that grind, mix, or temporarily hold luminal 
contents, in addition to providing aboral power propulsion and retropulsion2. Secretory

 mechanisms maintain a regionally appropriate pH as well as tightly regulated concentrations 
of electrolytes, enzymes and mucus. A thin semipermeable epithelial barrier, which is 
continuously regenerated from gastrointestinal stem cells3, separates the lumen from the 
body’s internal milieu. This barrier facilitates absorption, but also prevents the leakage of 
essential molecules into the intestinal lumen as well as the translocation of digestive 
enzymes, toxins and gut microbiota into the body from the lumen4. A scaffold of loose 
connective tissue, which contains the body’s largest array of immune effector cells, provides 
mechanical and defensive support for the barrier5. All of these functions — secretion, 
motility, mucosal maintenance and immunological defence — require an exquisite degree of 
regulation and coordination, which the enteric nervous system (ENS) provides (FIG. 1).
The ENS is one of three divisions of the autonomic nervous system, defined as sympathetic, 
parasympathetic and enteric by the British physiologist John Newport Langley6. The human 
ENS contains more than 100 million neurons, which dwarf the number of efferent fibres that 
reach the gut in the vagus nerves7.The complexity of managing the behaviour of the bowel is 
sufficiently great that, in contrast to the remainder of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), 
evolution has endowed the ENS with the ability to manifest integrative neuronal activity 
(that is, uniting complex inputs into a coherent and purposeful behavioural output) and the 
ability to control gastrointestinal behaviour independently of input from brain or spinal 
cord1,2,8. The ENS has more neurons than the aggregate of all other peripheral ganglia, 
containing at least as many as the spinal cord. Uniquely for the PNS, the ENS is organized 
in microcircuits, with interneurons and intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), which are 
able to initiate reflexes (FIGS 2,3). Enteric neuronal phenotypic diversity is extensive and 
virtually every class of neurotransmitter found in the CNS has also been detected in the 
ENS2. Although the ENS can function without input from the CNS, it does not normally do 
so; the CNS influences enteric behaviour and the gut also sends information to the brain. In 
fact, 90% of vagal fibres between the gut and brain are afferent, suggesting that the brain is 
more of a receiver than a transmitter with respect to brain–gut communication2,9. Some of 
the signals that the brain receives initiate vagovagal reflexes in which neurons within the 
CNS respond to enteric stimuli to regulate motility patterns in the oesophagus or stomach2,9. 
Additionally, gut-to-brain signalling transmits sensations of nausea, bloating, or satiety. 
Much of the information sent from the bowel to the CNS, however, is ‘homeostatic’ and 
might not reach consciousness, yet could be a determinant of mood. Vagus nerve 
stimulation, which mimics afferent signalling from the bowel, has been used successfully to 
treat depression and has been demonstrated to improve learning and memory in animals and 
humans10,11. Furthermore, the vagus nerve is also a potential conduit of signals from the 
luminal microbiota that affect mood, behaviour and brain development9,12–14.

 •
Because many neurotransmitters, signalling pathways and anatomical 
properties are common to the ENS and CNS, pathophysiological 
processes that underlie CNS disease often have enteric manifestations
•
Neuronal connections and the immune system might provide conduits 
that allow diseases acquired in the gut to spread to the brain
•
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, autistic spectrum 
disorders, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection are examples of 
disorders with both gastrointestinal and neurological consequences
•
VZV reactivations from latency in enteric and other autonomic neurons 
that lack cutaneous projections are occult causes of zoster without rash 
that lead to gastrointestinal disease, meningitis and strokes
•
Research on the gut–brain axis of disease is reasonably new, concepts 
are changing rapidly, and further investigation is much needed
The importance of efferent signal traffic from the CNS is greatest in the most proximal and 
distal bowel2. Mastication and swallowing are CNS-dependent; moreover, the CNS directly 
innervates oesophageal striated muscle, which responds to vagovagal reflexes and pattern 
generators within the brain. Vagovagal reflexes also control gastric motility and compliance, 
which enables the stomach to expand without increasing intraluminal pressure and thus to 
store and grind down ingested contents until they can be moved to the small intestine2. By 
contrast, the details of the movements of the small and large intestines are controlled and 
safeguarded by the ENS, and in fact, if all connections to the CNS are severed, essential 
motility in these regions of the bowel is unimpaired. Conversely, a lethal pseudo-obstruction 
occurs if even a small segment of the ENS is missing, which might happen congenitally (in 
Hirschsprung disease)15–17 or as a acquired illness (in Chagas disease)18. The ENS is 
therefore essential for life.
Primary disorders of the CNS
Given the importance, size and complexity of the ENS, it is not surprising that it contributes 
to the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disorders. There is also no reason to believe that 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CNS disorders should not also affect the ENS. 
Many neurotransmitters are common to the CNS and ENS2 and similar mechanisms govern 
development of both systems19. The pathophysiology that gives rise to CNS disorders 
therefore might also be operative in the ENS. ENS deficits are now reported to accompany 
an increasing number of CNS disorders (FIG. 4), from neurodevelopmental to 
neurodegenerative, and dysfunctional gastrointestinal manifestations might occur even 
before CNS symptoms become evident20.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
Because afferent and efferent nerves each link the CNS to the gut, it is plausible that these 
nerves act as conduits, enabling the spread of disorders from one to the other. Transmissible

 spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which include kuru, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease 
(vCJD), scrapie, chronic wasting disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are 
progressive and uniformly fatal diseases that provide a paradigm of CNS disorders that 
might originate or enter the body through the gut21. The pathogenic agents that cause TSEs 
are abnormally folded forms of normal cellular prion glycoproteins: the normal protein is 
called PrPC (prion protein cellular) and the abnormal protein derived from it is called PrPSc 
(prion protein scrapie, no matter in which TSE it occurs)22. PrPSc is a transmissible agent 
that acts as a template that causes replacement of alpha-helix with beta-sheet conformations 
in normal cellular PrPC, which then undergoes abnormal folding. Misfolded PrP aggregates 
into oligomers and becomes PrPSc (REF. 23), which spreads inexorably to and through the 
CNS. The neurodegeneration that underlies the signs and symptoms of TSEs follows in the 
wake of spreading PrPSc (REFS 22,24). In addition to these neural pathways, the immune 
system provides a potential gut-to-brain conduit for ingested PrPSc (REF. 25). M cells might 
translocate PrPSc to lymphoid cells, and receptors for PrPSc could also be present on the 
brush border of enterocytes26,27. Furthermore, enteric glia28 and neurons29 express PrPC and 
might thus be vulnerable to ingested PrPSc early in the disease course because of their 
proximity to the gut lumen26.
Autism spectrum disorder
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that is 
diagnosed in childhood on the basis of evidence of social withdrawal, impaired 
communication and repetitive behaviours30. Gastrointestinal symptoms are 3–4 times more 
common in children with ASD than in unaffected children31 but are often overlooked or 
considered components of comorbidities. ASD is diagnosed on the basis of behaviour, which 
directs focus to the brain, and no anatomical or biochemical diagnostic marker is currently 
available. Moreover, many different behaviourally defined conditions have now been 
combined under the umbrella term ASD in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders32, which means that the phenotypes of individuals with ASD 
are necessarily varied. The genetic causes of ASD are similarly diverse, with at least 100 and 
as many as 800 genes or genomic regions associated with ASD to date33–37.
Because of the diversity of ASD manifestations and abundance of genes associated with the 
condition, it has been difficult to link underlying molecular mechanisms to subtypes of 
ASD. One way to bring order to a diverse condition defined only by symptoms is to first 
identify a genetic abnormality and then to define the phenotype that arises from it. This 
classification of a condition can be achieved by ‘reverse phenotyping’, a process in which 
genetic marker data is used to refine phenotypic descriptions. This approach is the reverse of 
the traditional method by which signs and symptoms are first used to define a disease and a 
search is subsequently made for the underlying genotype. Reverse phenotyping is a 
potentially valuable method of determining molecular mechanisms that cause disease38. An 
example of the power of this approach is the analysis of the syndrome associated with a 
defect in the gene encoding chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8), a 
transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates the Wnt signalling pathway. Mutations in 
the CHD8 gene have been associated with a genetically defined ASD subtype, typified by 
macrocephaly, characteristic facial features and gastrointestinal symptoms due to slow-

 transit constipation39. Expression of the abnormal human gene encoding CHD8 in zebrafish 
caused a deficiency in enteric neurogenesis and slow gastrointestinal transit39. These 
observations suggest that slow gastrointestinal transit is not just a comorbidity but as much a 
part of the CHD8 phenotype as the behavioural symptoms of ASD. Similarly, Pitt–Hopkins 
syndrome is a subtype of ASD caused by haploinsufficiency of transcription factor 4 
(TCF4). Constipation and gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in patients with Pitt–
Hopkins syndrome40. Consistent with these human manifestations, mice with TCF4 
haploinsufficiency have impaired upper gastrointestinal transit and rectal motility41.
A study published in 2016 examining patients with ASD indicated that lower gastrointestinal 
symptoms, including abdominal pain, stool retention and large bowel movements, correlated 
with the level of serotonin (5-HT) in the blood42. Furthermore, an elevated level of blood 5-
HT has been found in about one-third of patients with ASD43. Blood 5-HT is almost entirely 
derived from the gut. Although platelets carry 5-HT in blood they do not synthesize it44, and 
instead utilize the sodium-dependent 5-HT transporter (SERT, also known as SLC6A4) to 
take up this molecule45 as they circulate through the bowel. An elevation of blood 5-HT 
levels is, therefore, itself suggestive of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Indeed, gain-of-function 
mutations in the SLC6A4 gene that encodes SERT are over-transmitted in patients with 
ASD46. In mice, expression of SERT Ala56 — a mutated form of the protein in which 
alanine is substituted for glycine 56 — results in ASD-like behaviour and a gastrointestinal 
phenotype characterized by ENS hypoplasia and slow gastrointestinal transit47. This 
observation is consistent with the idea that an ENS abnormality might define yet another 
subset of ASD.
The observations discussed in the previous paragraphs suggest that genetic defects affecting 
CNS function in a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as ASD, might also affect ENS 
function, leading to the high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Data from animal 
models of ASD suggest that agents causing congenitally acquired insults to the CNS could 
similarly provoke an ENS defect. Large epidemiological studies have shown a strong link 
between prenatal exposure to the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid and increased risk of 
autism48,49. Rats and mice exposed to valproic acid during fetal development exhibit altered 
social interaction, increased anxiety and repetitive behaviours, mimicking deficits in children 
with autism50. Male mice exposed to valproic acid in utero also exhibit intestinal 
inflammation, which is associated with decreased intestinal 5-HT levels51, suggesting that 
toxic exposures that affect the CNS also affect the gut. Although it is not clear whether the 
decrease of intestinal 5-HT levels is due to a direct effect of valproic acid or inflammation 
resulting from valproic acid, mucosal 5-HT is strongly pro-inflammatory whereas enteric 
neuronal 5-HT is anti-inflammatory52–56. These data are thus consistent with the possibility 
that in utero exposure to valproic acid predisposes children to intestinal inflammation 
through altered enteric 5-HT signalling.
Interest in the possibility that the gastrointestinal tract is not just an innocent bystander in 
ASD, but that it might actually play a part in pathogenesis, is long-standing. The ‘leaky gut’ 
hypothesis of ASD pathophysiology is based on the idea that defects in intestinal epithelial 
barrier permeability lead to inappropriate signalling by luminal components including 
bacteria, environmental toxins and even dietary macromolecules57. Although this hypothesis

 remains popular and has driven many parents to place children with autism on special diets, 
the data to support an intestinal permeability deficit in ASD are limited and conflicting, 
given that both increased intestinal permeability58 and normal intestinal permeability59 in 
ASD have been reported. One study reported that the permeability of the intestine to 
lactulose and mannitol was abnormal in 36.7% of children with ASD, in 21.2% of their first-
degree relatives and in 4.8% of healthy adults as controls, but was always normal in children 
without ASD60. Mouse models provide some support for the ‘leaky gut’ hypothesis and 
suggest that host gut microbiota are important determinants. In the maternal immune 
activation (MIA) model of ASD, pregnant mice are treated with immune-stimulatory 
molecules that mimic viral infection. MIA pups exhibit features of ASD including decreased 
ultrasonic vocalizations, impaired social interactions and repetitive behaviours61. MIA pups 
also have increased intestinal barrier permeability62. Additionally, treating MIA mice with 
the bacteria Bacteroides fragilis restores the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and is 
associated with improvement in some of the ASD-like behaviours, such as open field 
exploration, impaired sensorimotor gating and repetitive marble burying62. This exciting 
study shows that CNS impairments that result in an ASD-like behaviour, such as reduced 
expressive communication, are not necessarily irreversible and could be ameliorated by 
altering the intestinal microbiota and barrier permeability. Enteric neurons and glia both 
have important roles in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier63. Further 
study is therefore needed to determine whether ENS dysfunction underlies barrier defects in 
ASD, and whether modulating ENS function might offer an opportunity for treatment of 
behavioural and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with ASD.
Parkinson disease
Progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease 
(AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are defined by CNS dysfunction in specific 
regions characteristic to each disease. In PD, for example, degeneration of nigrostriatal 
dopaminergic neurons is associated with a movement disorder characterized by rigidity, 
resting tremor, postural instability and bradykinesia64. The identification of gastrointestinal 
abnormalities in patients with PD over 30 years ago first raised the possibility that the ENS 
could be involved in PD65–67. Dopaminergic neurons are found in the ENS68,69 and are 
essential for normal gastrointestinal motility70. Both chemical injury and genetically derived 
animal models commonly used to study the pathogenesis of PD suggest that the ENS is 
vulnerable to degeneration in PD. One such animal model involves systemic administration 
of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which causes 
nigrostriatal damage and PD-like symptoms in mice, primates and humans71. MPTP 
damages the ENS and the CNS, with up to 40% loss of enteric dopaminergic neurons 
occurring within 10 days of MPTP administration in mice, which suggests that toxic insults 
to the CNS associated with PD can exert similar effects on the ENS72. Mouse genetic 
models of PD pathogenesis also exhibit varying degrees of enteric neuronal dysfunction. α-
synuclein is a member of a presynaptic family of synuclein proteins that are expressed 
widely in the nervous system73–75, including the ENS20,76–78. Synucleins can function as 
chaperone proteins and are necessary for neuronal survival73. Monomeric synucleins also 
function in promoting the curvature of cell membranes74, and regulate the kinetics of 
endocytosis of synaptic vesicle proteins75. In PD, α-synuclein forms protease-resistant

 aggregates that are the primary molecular constituent of Lewy bodies, the pathognomonic 
lesion that remains the gold standard for definitive neuropathological diagnosis of 
PD20,78,79. Transgenic mice engineered to overexpress normal human α-synuclein in 
neurons exhibit colonic dysmotility associated with insoluble α-synuclein aggregates within 
enteric neurons, which precedes onset of subcortical changes80–82. Autosomal dominant 
familial forms of PD have been linked to two missense mutations in α-synuclein, encoding 
Ala30Pro and Ala53Thr substitutions83,84. Expression of these mutant forms of human α-
synuclein in mice lacking endogenous α-synuclein leads to proteinase-K-resistant inclusion 
bodies within enteric neurons that display α-synuclein-immunoreactivity85. Ala30Pro and 
Ala53Thr mice have a statistically significantly greater total gastrointestinal transit time and 
slower colonic motility than wild-type or α-synuclein-null mice, even in the absence of CNS 
pathology85. Mouse models of PD therefore suggest that both toxic and genetic insults 
linked to PD are associated with ENS deficits, which could precede the onset of CNS 
symptoms or pathology. One limitation of the genetic models remains that they all involve 
overexpression of either wild-type or mutant α-synuclein proteins, which may or may not 
reflect the pathophysiology of human disease. Regardless of this limitation, the observations 
support the exciting possibility that the ENS offers an accessible site for the diagnosis and 
monitoring of treatment in PD78.
Routine biopsy samples obtained by colonoscopy can sample up to 150 submucosal neurons 
and many more mucosal nerve fibres86, making it plausible that ENS pathology could be 
used to diagnose and/or monitor PD. Since the initial report of Lewy bodies in the human 
ENS65, investigations have sought to determine whether enteric Lewy bodies are specific for 
PD, whether the extent of Lewy pathology in the ENS correlates with disease severity, and 
whether PD causes enteric neuronal degeneration. One study examined the ENS in seven 
patients with PD who had undergone autopsy and in age-matched controls without PD in 
whom brain sections revealed no Lewy bodies, and detected Lewy bodies in both enteric 
plexuses of all patients with PD examined, but only eight of 24 controls67. Lewy bodies 
were also more numerous in patients with PD than in control patients. Another autopsy 
study compared enteric α-synuclein expression in ten patients with PD, eight patients with 
AD and 77 controls who were negative for markers of PD or AD. Enteric α-synuclein 
expression was detectable in at least half of the controls and patients with AD, but was found 
universally in patients with PD; furthermore, levels of staining were also much higher in the 
bowel of PD patients than in other patients87. Additional studies have also focused on the 
prognostic value of endoscopic biopsies, which sample mostly mucosa and some submucosa 
but are routinely performed in the USA and Germany for colon cancer screening in adults 
over the age of 50, according to guidelines of the US Preventative Services Task Force88. 
Some of these studies have suggested that α-synuclein+ Lewy neurites detected in the 
submucosa of colonic biopsy samples are specific for PD86,89,90, whereas others have shown 
that aggregated α-synuclein in the mucosa and submucosa is a common finding that is 
unrelated to PD91. The use of multiple antibodies and careful examination of the 
morphologies of the resulting patterns of immunostaining might improve the prognostic 
value of immunocytochemical detection of α-synucleinopathies78. The discrepancies in 
reported observations of Lewy bodies in the ENS will have to be resolved before intestinal 
biopsy samples can be used to diagnose PD. Diagnostic use of Lewy pathology in the ENS,

 perhaps in association with another biomarker, ought to be beneficial because evidence is 
good that prodromal lesions appear in the bowel in a substantial fraction of patients with PD 
up to 20 years before the onset of CNS manifestations92.
Lewy pathology can affect the gut, however, it remains unresolved to what degree PD causes 
neurodegeneration in the ENS and, if it does, whether dopaminergic neurons are more 
vulnerable than other subpopulations. One group of investigators compared colonic surgical 
specimens from 11 patients with advanced PD with specimens from patients who underwent 
colonic resection for either adenocarcinoma or chronic constipation93. They reported that the 
proportion of myenteric dopaminergic neurons was selectively decreased by 10-fold in 
patients with PD; moreover, the PD-related decrease in enteric neurons was associated with 
the presence of Lewy bodies in both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic myenteric 
neurons93. By contrast, another group reported that, compared with age-matched controls, 
there was no difference in either the density of total myenteric neurons or the density of 
subpopulations of myenteric neurons throughout the gastrointestinal tract in postmortem 
samples from 13 patients with advanced PD94. Several challenges unique to studying the 
ENS have made it particularly difficult to assess the extent of neurodegeneration. Enteric 
neurons are irregularly distributed in two interconnected plexuses that are integrated into 7.5 
m (~25 ft) of bowel in a human adult. Histopathological studies using paraffin sections from 
autopsy or surgical specimens to quantify neuronal density are therefore highly prone to 
sampling error. The sections pass randomly through the enteric plexuses and relatively few 
neurons are present in any one section. The underlying logic of ENS organization, 
furthermore, is not fully understood. This aspect means that enteric neurodegeneration in PD 
might be restricted to functionally specific regions or ganglia, much as it is in the CNS, and 
be easily missed. Finally, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity is often used to identify 
dopaminergic neurons both in the bowel69 and the brain95. Tyrosine hydroxylase, however, 
is not actually a dopaminergic neuronal marker because it is also found in noradrenergic 
neurons96. In the gut, moreover, the vast majority of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive 
fibres are sympathetic axons, which are noradrenergic projections from the extrinsic 
prevertebral ganglia to the bowel69. Greater understanding of ENS biology and more 
effective strategies to quantify the densities of total and dopaminergic neurons in human 
bowel are therefore needed.
In sum, data from human and mouse studies suggest that α-synuclein has a role in ENS 
function in the normal bowel and that protease-resistant aggregates of α-synuclein can be 
seen in enteric ganglia in the presence and absence of CNS pathology. Studies of transgenic 
mice engineered to express human mutant α-synuclein, as well as studies of the pathology 
of human specimens, suggest that the myenteric plexus might be more affected by Lewy 
body pathology than the submucosal plexus. Additionally, these studies indicate that 
pathological findings in the ENS are not restricted to dopaminergic neurons. Although the 
myenteric plexus is not sampled by routine endoscopic biopsies, it remains much more 
accessible than the CNS. Further studies are needed to determine whether full-thickness 
biopsies of the bowel wall that include the myenteric plexus will be helpful in the diagnosis 
or monitoring of PD.

 Although the data on the diagnostic utility of Lewy pathology in the ENS remains equivocal, 
evidence exists that the gastrointestinal tract might play a part in PD pathogenesis. Braak 
and colleagues characterized brainstem pathology in patients with PD and found, 
unexpectedly, that α-synuclein+ inclusion bodies could be identified within very specific 
subpopulations of neurons in some brainstem nuclei, including visceromotor projection 
neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV)97,98. This finding led Braak to 
propose that PD might be caused by a neurotropic pathogen, which first crosses the mucosal 
barrier to enter enteric neurons and then moves by retrograde transport along efferent vagal 
fibres to the DMV to gain access to the cerebral cortex99. Consistent with Braak’s 
hypothesis, Lewy pathology is detectable in the peripheral vagus, as well as the enteric 
plexuses in the stomach and oesophagus of patients with PD100; moreover, rat vagal efferent 
axons are α-synuclein-immunoreactive, whereas vagal afferent axons are not101. Studies in 
rodents have now provided the proof of principle that gastrointestinal exposure to a toxic 
insult can trigger CNS pathology in PD95,96. Pesticide exposure has been linked to PD in 
epidemiological studies102 and the administration of the pesticide rotenone has been 
explored in a mouse model of PD71. Chronic intragastric administration of low doses of 
rotenone leads to progressive accumulation of α-synuclein+ inclusion bodies — first in 
enteric neurons, then the DMV, and finally in the substantia nigra — in the absence of 
detectable rotenone in the CNS or systemic circulation103,104. Other groups have shown that 
injection of human α-synuclein or brain lysate from a patient with PD into the intestinal 
walls of rats leads, over time, to progressive α-synuclein immunoreactivity along vagal 
fibres and eventually in the DMV105,106. These data demonstrate that retrograde transport of 
α-synuclein in vagal efferent axons from the DMV is possible, and that insults to the 
gastrointestinal tract can trigger ascending pathology along the gut–brain axis.
Although causality is difficult to assess in humans, intriguing evidence supporting Braak’s 
hypothesis is provided by one epidemiological study, which proposed that if vagal 
projections to the gastrointestinal tract are indeed important in the pathogenesis of PD, then 
patients who undergo a vagotomy would be protected from developing PD107. To test this 
hypothesis, the researchers assembled a cohort of over 14,000 patients who underwent a 
vagotomy over an 18-year period in Denmark, and a control cohort of matched individuals 
from the general population. Patients typically underwent either truncal vagotomy, in which 
both vagal trunks were severed below the level of the diaphragm, or superselective 
vagotomy, in which only the vagal projections to the gastric fundus and body were ligated. 
Truncal vagotomy eliminates vagal projections to the gastric antrum, pylorus, liver, biliary 
tree, pancreas, small intestine and large intestine, whereas superselective vagotomy leaves 
these projections intact. Patients who underwent truncal vagotomy and had at least 20 years 
of postsurgical follow-up were found to have an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.28–
0.99) for PD, compared with the general population cohort107. This protective effect was not 
observed with superselective vagotomy107, supporting the idea that vagal innervation to the 
gastrointestinal tract is important for PD pathogenesis but that the area of vulnerability 
includes more than the stomach. Subsequent analysis by another group of this same data set 
expanded to include a larger time frame and using a different type of statistical analysis, 
however, has questioned the strength of these findings108; therefore, further study is needed.

 Research in animal models shows that the gut-to-brain transmission of PD is plausible, but it 
remains unclear to what extent the gastrointestinal tract plays a part in the overall incidence 
of human PD. Histopathological data from patients suggests that the ascending pathology 
proposed by Braak is unlikely to be the only route of disease progression109–111. 
Postmortem examination of the brainstem in patients with PD has found that at least 7% do 
not have α-synuclein+ inclusions in the DMV despite extensive nigrostriatal pathology, and 
that the severity of DMV pathology does not always correlate with extent of pathology in 
higher brain regions109–111. The combination of animal and human studies nevertheless 
presents a strong case for gastrointestinal involvement in the pathogenesis and/or 
pathophysiology of at least some cases of PD, and makes it imperative to continue to 
investigate the role of the ENS in PD.
Alzheimer disease
In contrast with PD, studies investigating the enteric manifestations of AD remain limited. In 
the CNS, AD is associated with the progressive accumulation of extracellular plaques 
containing amyloid beta (Aβ), intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles 
containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein112, and dysfunction of cholinergic neurons of 
the basal forebrain113. These pathological changes trigger neurodegeneration and synapse 
loss, leading to impaired working memory and progressive dementia. Amyloid precursor 
protein (APP), the molecule from which Aβ is derived, is normally expressed in the ENS114 
and is essential for normal gastrointestinal motility, immunity and secretion115. Over 70% of 
enteric neurons are cholinergic7, further supporting the potential effects of AD 
pathophysiology in the ENS. Transgenic mice that express three mutant forms of APP 
(Lys670Asn, Met671Leu, and Val717Phe)116 or APP with a double mutation (Lys670Asn 
and Met671Leu) plus mutant presenilin1 (PS1-dE9), all of which are associated with 
familial AD117, develop progressive accumulation of Aβ within enteric neurons. This Aβ 
accumulation is associated with a decrease in numbers of enteric neurons, dysmotility and 
increased vulnerability to intestinal inflammation, depending on the transgene and promoter 
used116,117. These observations suggest that enteric neurons are vulnerable to APP 
abnormalities, and imply that ENS dysfunction could occur in AD. Studies of the human 
ENS in AD, however, have been sparse. Aβ-immunoreactive plaques were reported in the 
intestinal submucosa of two patients with AD118, but there have been no follow-up studies. 
Human enteric neurons express microtubule-associated tau protein119,120 and 
hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates have also been detected in the myenteric plexus of 
ageing rats121. Only one study has compared the ENS in patients with AD with that of 
healthy individuals and those with other forms of dementia, in which no enteric neuronal 
loss or tau pathology specific to AD was found122. Given the increasing prevalence of AD 
and its severe financial burden, further exploration of a potential link between human AD 
and ENS pathology is clearly needed.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders that overlap in 
their underlying genetic bases and pathology; both involve nuclear–cytoplasmic transport 
dysfunction at the cellular level123. As new genetic mutations have been identified in ALS 
and FTD, specifically in TARDBP (encoding TAR DNA-binding protein 43; TDP-43), FUS

 and C9orf72, new links have also been revealed between CNS disorders and previously 
unsuspected ENS dysfunction. TDP-43 is a multi-functional RNA-binding protein that acts 
primarily in the nucleus as a transcriptional repressor and can also move to the cytosol to 
modulate mRNA transport and stability124. Mutations in TARDBP are responsible for 2–5% 
of familial ALS125–127; furthermore, hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated aggregates of 
TDP-43 are found within inclusion bodies in the brain and spinal cord of many patients with 
FTD and/or ALS128. A number of TDP-43 transgenic mouse models have been generated to 
study the pathogenesis of FTD and ALS. One model, in which the mouse prion promoter 
drives expression of the Ala315Thr mutant form of TDP-43 (Prp-TDP43Ala315Thr)129, 
causes symptoms of intestinal obstruction followed by sudden death130,131. Enteric neurons 
and glia normally express TDP-43 and the mouse prion promoter is active in both cell 
types132. A progressive, age-related loss of neurons and glia occurs in the myenteric plexus 
in Prp-TDP43Ala315Thr mice, which is associated with delayed total gastrointestinal transit 
time secondary to slow colonic motility, even in ex vivo preparations that lack CNS 
input132,133. These data suggest that the ENS is vulnerable to genetic insults associated with 
ALS and FTD. Enteric manifestations of these and other TDP-43 associated 
neurodegenerative disorders require further study in which the concept of reverse 
phenotyping (as discussed earlier) might prove useful.
Interestingly, a gastrointestinal phenotype also occurs in transgenic mice that express 
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) Gly93Ala, the most studied of the SOD1 mutations134. In 
contrast to Prp-TDP43Ala315Thr mice, however, the defect consists of abnormal tight 
junctions between enterocytes and increased mucosal permeability135. The SOD1Gly93Ala 
mucosa, moreover, has increased numbers of Paneth cells, but decreased expression of the 
antibacterial peptide defensin-5, which Paneth cells produce. Perhaps because of the 
diminished antimicrobial ability in these animals, the microbiota of SOD1Gly93Ala mice are 
highly abnormal. The ENS is an important regulator of the proliferation and differentiation 
of the mucosal epithelium; serotonergic neurons in the myenteric plexus activate submucosal 
cholinergic neurons that innervate intestinal crypts to stimulate proliferation136. 
Conceivably, a defect could be present in enteric neurons of SOD1Gly93Ala mice, as in Prp-
TDP43Ala315Thr animals, which causes the mucosal barrier abnormalities in these animals; 
however, investigations into the ENS in SOD1Gly93Ala mice are lacking, despite the 
popularity of these mice as a model of ALS.
The link between the CNS and the ENS is particularly relevant in neurodegenerative 
disorders because of the emerging hypothesis that the misfolded proteins that occur in these 
disorders share common cell-to-cell transmission mechanisms137,138, analogous to those 
responsible for the spread of PrPSc (REF. 22). Either the ENS or the CNS could, in theory, 
be a point of origin for the pathophysiology. Regardless of where the pathology begins, the 
misfolded proteins form aggregates, which are displayed on plasma membranes of affected 
cells and are secreted or cleaved to reach the extracellular space. These proteins are glycated 
(subjected to non-enzymatic glycosylation) to form advanced glycation end-products 
(AGEs) that bind to AGE receptors (RAGEs) on neighbouring cells and are internalized. The 
proteins might be cleared as a result of autophagy but, if not, they are neurotoxic139. These 
features are common for PrPSc, α-synuclein in PD, as well as Aβ and tau in AD. AGEs have 
also been postulated to have a role in the abnormal folding of mutated forms of SOD1 and

 TDP-43. Findings from experiments in mice expressing a series of mutations in FUS (a gene 
closely related to TDP-43), which are associated with highly aggressive and juvenile forms 
of ALS140, suggest that the mutant FUS protein causes degeneration of motor neurons 
through a gain-of-function mechanism that does not involve a loss of the normal activity of 
FUS protein141. Studies of FUS mutations as well as repeat expansions in C9orf72, another 
gain-of-function mutation linked to familial ALS142, highlight the importance of protein 
misfolding in ALS pathogenesis. No work has yet been done on FUS or C9orf72 in the ENS 
of humans with ALS or animal models of ALS.
Unsuspected viral infection of the ENS
Studies of autism and neurodegenerative disorders have shown that the ENS can be both an 
innocent bystander as well as an active player in the pathophysiology of CNS disease. The 
emergence of a well-known neurological infection as a clandestine cause of potentially 
serious gastrointestinal disturbance highlights the importance of the ENS and its connections 
to the rest of the nervous system. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the aetiological agent of 
varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles)143. VZV is highly infectious but its primary 
disseminated infection, varicella, is usually a childhood disease of mild–moderate severity 
that provides VZV with access to neurons in which the virus establishes lifelong latency143. 
Zoster, in its classic manifestation, is a localized secondary infection caused by reactivation 
of VZV from latency, which causes pain, cutaneous hyperalgesia and allodynia. VZV has 
long been known to establish latency in neurons of dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerve 
ganglia143; however, it is now recognized also to establish latency in enteric neurons of 
virtually all patients who have experienced varicella or been vaccinated against it143–145. If 
an immunodeficiency exists, varicella causes lytic infection, which destroys enteric neurons 
and leads to ileus146.
A vesicular rash due to epidermal infection is the characteristic feature that suggests a 
diagnosis of varicella or zoster143. In varicella, the rash is due to VZV that has been 
transported to the epidermis within skin-homing T cells from the portal of virus entry in the 
upper respiratory tract147. In zoster, anterograde transport within cutaneous projections of 
the dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerve ganglia neurons containing the reactivated VZV 
delivers the virus to the epidermis. When VZV reactivates in neurons of the ENS (FIG. 5), 
which do not project to the skin, enteric zoster occurs, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction 
without a rash144. Because there is no rash, enteric zoster is rarely suspected or diagnosed 
before surgery or autopsy, when a viral screen can reveal VZV to be the cause of intestinal 
pseudo-obstruction148. VZV reactivation in autonomic ganglia is similarly a clandestine 
cause of CNS disease and can cause strokes or meningitis without manifesting a telltale 
rash143. Reactivation of VZV leads to lytic infection and death of enteric neurons146; 
therefore, the intestinal pseudo-obstruction in enteric zoster is the result of an acquired 
aganglionosis, similar to that of Chagas disease18. Pseudo-obstruction, however, is not the 
only manifestation of enteric zoster, which can also cause perforating gastric ulcers and/or 
otherwise unexplained abdominal pain144. The examination of saliva in the context of 
abdominal pain for which no cause has been found after a gastroenterological workup 
provides a non-invasive diagnostic test for enteric zoster144. DNA encoding VZV genes 
appears in saliva when there is a productive VZV infection somewhere in the body, but

 cannot be detected in control individuals that lack such an infection144,149. The appearance 
of VZV DNA in the saliva of patients with abdominal pain therefore suggests enteric zoster. 
In a small clinical trial of patients in whom salivary VZV DNA caused enteric zoster to be 
suspected, treatment of three of three patients with the antiviral drug valaciclovir was 
followed by the rapid disappearance of abdominal pain144. Because zoster is associated with 
a decrease in cellular immunity150, population ageing and the increasingly common use of 
immunosuppressive therapies have caused the incidence of zoster in the USA to rise by 
about threefold since studies carried out between 1945 and 1959; similar rises have been 
reported in other developed countries151. The use of salivary VZV DNA for the diagnosis of 
zoster has already revealed that enteric zoster is not rare144, and once it begins to be widely 
suspected, this pathology is likely to be encountered with increasing frequency. The 
possibility that enteric zoster contributes to the initiation of idiopathic gastrointestinal 
conditions, such as IBS, gastroparesis and IBD, merits future investigation.
Conclusions
The major site of integrative neuronal activity is the brain; however, the functions of the 
bowel are so complex that evolution has provided the gut with an intrinsic nervous system 
that can uniquely provide the necessary regulation of enteric behaviour and integration of 
multiple sensory inputs independently from the CNS. Details of the control of enteric 
behaviour have been delegated to the ENS. This ‘peripheralization’ has freed the brain from 
providing space for the hundreds of millions of neurons that are housed in the bowel, and 
eliminated a need for vast numbers of nerve fibres to connect these neurons to the gut. Still, 
despite the potential independence of the ENS, the brain and gut are connected and, for 
better or worse, able to influence one another (FIG. 4). In health, this complex mutual inter-
relationship works well, but disorders of the CNS might have enteric manifestations and 
could even be acquired from the gut. Many developmental mechanisms that operate in CNS 
formation are also operative in ENS ontogeny, and the two nervous systems share a 
considerable degree of cellular and molecular identity. Several conditions that are commonly 
thought to be CNS disorders, such as TSE, ASD, PD, AD and ALS have enteric 
consequences. Additionally, many gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS, chronic intestinal 
pseudo-obstruction and gastroparesis, are idiopathic. One fairly common cause of occult 
gastrointestinal disease is infection with VZV, which has been diagnosed infrequently due to 
lack of previous consideration. Other such conditions probably exist. Further exploration of 
brain–gut disease with molecular tools and the application of genetic approaches, including 
reverse phenotyping, will probably shrink the current idiopathic category of gastrointestinal 
disease and enlarge that of disorders common to the CNS and the ENS.

 Figure 1. Relationship between the ENS and components of the peripheral nervous system
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a large division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
that can control gastrointestinal behaviour independently of central nervous system (CNS) 
input. Mammalian neurons are located in either the CNS (brain and spinal cord) or PNS 
(cells with soma outside the brain and spinal cord). Afferent information from the periphery 
to the CNS is conveyed by neurons located in dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia, which 
constitute the ‘sensory’ division of the PNS (yellow). Afferent information integrated by the 
CNS leads to efferent output through the ‘motor’ division of the PNS (blue). Efferent 
projections from the CNS target either skeletal muscle (skeletal motor) or the autonomic 
nervous system, which is divided into three parts: sympathetic, parasympathetic and 
enteric6. In contrast to the neurons in sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia, most enteric 
neurons receive no direct innervation from the CNS. Enteric neurons are organized in 
microcircuits that contain intrinsic primary afferent neurons that can respond intrinsically to 
local stimuli to integrate information and coordinate motor output. The ENS is therefore 
unique in having both sensory and motor properties (dotted line). Thus, ENS can mediate 
behaviour independently of the CNS; nevertheless, a two-way communication normally 
occurs between the bowel and the CNS, which influence one another.

 Figure 2. The ENS can regulate intestinal behaviours in the absence of CNS input
The neurons and glia of the ENS form an extensive network that extends through the layers 
of the small and large intestine. a | Schematic of the small intestine illustrating the 
organization of the ENS in its location within the intestinal wall. The myenteric plexus is 
located between the longitudinal and circular layers of smooth muscle whereas the smaller 
submucosal plexus is located in the dense connective tissue of the submucosa, just 
underneath the mucosa. Note that no nerve fibres actually enter the enteric lumen or its 
epithelial lining. The extrinsic innervation reaches the bowel through the mesentery along 
with the vasculature. b | The major components of the gastrointestinal tract that allow the 
bowel to sense and respond to luminal conditions are listed. c | Organization of myenteric 
ganglia. A colonic segment from an adult PLP1-eGFP mouse immunostained with the 
neuronal cell body marker, ANNA-1 (red) and the PLP1-eGFP glial reporter (green). Scale 
bar = 50μm. d | Organization of the submucosal ganglia. A colonic segment from an adult 
PLP1-eGFP mouse immunostained with the neuronal cell body marker, ANNA-1 (red) and 
the PLP1-eGFP glial reporter (green). The asterisk indicates a non-immunostained crypt 
base encircled by mucosal glia (green). Scale bar = 50μm. e | A cross-section of ileum from 
a PLP1-eGFP mouse immunostained with the neuronal marker, PGP9.5, which identifies 
neurites as well as cell bodies (red). The extensive innervation of the intestine, as well as the 
presence of enteric glia (green) throughout the lamina propria of the mucosa, is illustrated.

 Figure 3. Schematic of the peristaltic reflex microcircuit required for aboral propulsion of 
luminal contents
Luminal distention or distortion triggers direct activation of mechanoreceptive endings of 
intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), as well as indirect activation of IPANs upon 
serotonin (5-HT) release by enterochromaffin cells (ECs) in the epithelium. IPANs activate 
ascending and descending interneurons, which stimulate excitatory and inhibitory motor 
neurons, respectively. Motor neuron activity leads to oral contraction and anal relaxation of 
intestinal smooth muscle, which propels luminal contents in the proximal–distal direction. 
ACh refers to neurons that contain acetylcholine. SP refers to neurons that contain substance 
P. Enk refers to encephalin-expressing ascending interneurons. NO and VIP indicate 
inhibitory motor neurons secreting nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal peptide. βNAD 
refers to inhibitory motor neurons secreting the purine, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. 
Secretomotor and vasomotor neurons of the submucosal plexus secrete ACh or VIP.

 Figure 5. Enteric manifestations of lytic VZV infection of the mucosa and latent VZV infection of 
the ENS
a | Mucosal biopsy sample from a patient with a perforated gastric ulcer. The patient’s saliva 
and stomach contained DNA encoding varicella zoster virus (VZV) gene products. The 
gastric epithelium has been infected and shows the immunoreactivity of gE (ORF68p; green) 
and ORF63p (red). DNA has been stained with bisbenzimide (blue). There is a slight 
superimposition of white light in interference contrast to allow all components of the tissue 
to be visualized. Newly infected cells (arrows) where the virus is spreading are mostly red 
fluorescent because ORF63 is an immediate early gene and gE is a late gene. The highly 
infected cells contain both gene products and are yellow. Scale bar = 20 μm. b | Ileum of a 
guinea pig injected with VZV-infected lymphocytes. The VZV expresses green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) under the control of the VZV promoter for ORF66. The red fluorescence is 
the immunoreactivity of β3-tubulin, a neuronal marker. Virtually all enteric neurons contain 
latent VZV. Note that the VZV is confined to nerve cell bodies and is not seen in neurites 
within the interganglionic connectives (red). Thus, the neurons are not actually producing 
viral particles. The restriction of ORF66-GFP to cell bodies is therefore an indicator of viral 
latency. DNA has been stained with bisbenzimide (blue). Scale bar = 20 μm.
