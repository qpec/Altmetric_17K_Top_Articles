Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence, Mortality,
Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-
Adjusted Life-years for 32 Cancer Groups, 1990 to 2015
A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study
Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration
IMPORTANCE Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on
the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning.
OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life
lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and
territories from 1990 to 2015.
EVIDENCE REVIEW Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data,
cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately
estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was
calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer
prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates
were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific
cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs
and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per
capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to
summarize results.
FINDINGS In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths.
Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing
16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the
most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and
lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and
25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million
cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women
(523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide
in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates
for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized
death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195
countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely
located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased
significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (−6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), −10.6% to −1.3%]).
The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic
myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is
expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources.
Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and
palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study
results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major
findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco
control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.

mony that the “war on cancer”has not been won, recent develop-
mentsinpersonalizedmedicineandnoveltreatmentapproacheslike

survival.2-4 These expectations for patients with cancer in high-
income countries contrast with the challenge of making basic diag-
nostic and treatment options widely available in low-resource
settings.5 Both the equity and affordability of cancer care from in-
dividualandsocietalperspectivesareincreasinglybeingquestioned.6
Survival rates between and within high-income countries differ for
reasons such as variation in education, access to specialized care,
effectivetreatment,andinsurancestatus.7-9Thefullpotentialofcan-
cerpreventionforreducingincidenceandmortalityisfarfrombeing
realized,andeffortsareespeciallylagginginlow-incomecountries.10
Awareness of this “
cancer divide,”with substantially worse out-
comesandahighburdeninsocioeconomicallydisadvantagedpopu-
lations, has led to a focus on global oncology by the international
health community.4,5,10 This is reflected in the third Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) to “by 2030, reduce by one-third prema-
ture mortality from non-communicable diseases through preven-
tionandtreatmentandpromotementalhealthandwell-being.”

Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study providing a unique means of
tracking progress in closing this divide. Here, we present results of
the GBD 2015 study for 32 cancer groups covering cancer inci-
dence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability
(YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 195 countries
or territories from 1990 to 2015 for both sexes across age groups.

Hereinafter,citationstoWebTablesareforthosegiveninBox3.Data
sources for GBD 2015 are listed in eTable 2 in the Supplement, in-
cluding which new sources were added compared with GBD 2013.
Relevant changes in the estimation strategy since GBD 2013
include the addition of 7 territories (American Samoa, Bermuda,
Greenland, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the
US Virgin Islands), which previously were only included in the GBD
regional totals. Results for the United Kingdom are reported for
NorthernIreland,Scotland,Wales,andEngland).ChangestotheGBD
causes include dividing “leukemia”into acute lymphoid leukemia,
chroniclymphoidleukemia,acutemyeloidleukemia,andchronicmy-
eloid leukemia. Methodological updates were made to the mortal-
ity to incidence (MI) ratio estimation, which are described in detail
in the eAppendix in the Supplement. Major updates for the MI ratio
predictions were out-of-sample validation of multiple model
types and selection of 1 model per cancer based on the out-of-
sample root-mean-squared error.
For GBD 2015, a sociodemographic index (SDI) was devel-
oped, which is a summary indicator derived from measures of
income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Detailed

In brief, the SDI weighs each component, which is rescaled be-
tween 0 and 1, equally. The composite SDI index is the mean of the
3 rescaled components. An SDI of 1.0 can be interpreted as a loca-

ery GBD study, the full time series estimated for each GBD cycle su-
persedes prior GBD studies. For GBD 2015, the full time series from

decade. Estimates before 2005 as well as additional results can be
found online (https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/).
Estimation Framework
The initial process in the burden of cancer estimation is the model-
ing of cancer mortality. One of the GBD study’
s principles is to iden-
tify, and ideally use, all available data.15 Data inputs for cancer mor-
talityestimationthereforecomefrom2majorpathways:(1)mortality
data and (2) cancer registry incidence data transformed to mortal-
ity estimates. Mortality data from vital registration systems, verbal
autopsies, and other sources like disease surveillance records were
processed and added to a cause-of-death database. Methods and
data sources have been described in detail previously.1
Key Points
Question What is the burden of cancer between 1990 and 2015 at
the global, regional, and national level measured in incidence,
mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by sex and age?
Findings Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) methodology,
we estimated that in 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases, 8.7
million deaths, and 208.3 million DALYs. Between 2005 and 2015,
incident cancer cases increased by 33%, of which 12.6% were due
to population growth, 16.4% due to an aging population, and 4.1 %
due to increasing age-specific incidence rates.
Meaning Cancer control, which requires a detailed understanding
of the cancer burden as provided in the GBD, is of utmost
importance given the rise in cancer incidence due to
epidemiological and demographic transition.

tisticalClassificationofDiseasesandRelatedHealthProblems,Tenth
Revision (ICD-10), for each GBD cancer group as well as a descrip-
tion of data processing steps can be found in the eAppendix in the
Supplement. The 32 cancer groups, together referred to as the “
all
cancer”group,encompassallmalignantneoplasmsasdefinedinthe
ICD-10 except for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC, ICD-10 code
C44)andKaposisarcoma(ICD-10codeC46).AlthoughNMSCisthe
most common cancer in many populations, most cancer registries
donotincludeNMSC,whichnecessitatesdifferentestimationmeth-
ods from the cancers presented here.16 Deaths due to Kaposi sar-
comaarenotseparatelyincludedbecausethesewereattributedto
human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS in the GBD study.
The combined data on individual causes of death were used as
input for the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm).17 Covari-
ates used for each cancer are listed in the eAppendix in the Supple-
ment.IndividualcausemortalityestimatesfromCODEmwerecon-
strainedtofitindependentlymodeled,all-causemortalityestimates
using the tool CodCorrect.1 We calculated YLLs by multiplying each
death with the life expectancy for that age taken from a normative
life table; life expectancy at birth was 86.5 years, which is based on
the lowest observed death rate in each 5-year age group in popula-
tions over 5 million.1
Final mortality estimates were transformed into incidence es-
timatesusingmodeledMIratios.Uncertaintyfromthemortalityes-
timation and from the MI ratio estimation was propagated to the
incidence estimates. Ten-year cancer prevalence was modeled by
estimating cancer survival using an MI ratio–based scaling factor,
which takes into account location, year, and sex (see the eAppen-
dix in the Supplement for details). This factor was used to scale the
incidence cohort between a theoretical best-case and a theoretical
worst-case survival. The absolute survival estimates allowed calcu-
lation of 10-year prevalence for each incidence cohort.
Total prevalence was divided into 4 sequelae reflecting vary-
ingdegreesofdisabilityduringthecancercontinuum:(1)diagnosis/
treatment, (2) remission, (3) metastatic/disseminated, and (4) ter-
minal phase. Duration of the 4 prevalence phases by cancer can be
found in eTable 13 in the Supplement. Since data sources including
stage distribution and treatment approaches are not available for
most countries, the simplifying assumption of a constant duration
of the diagnosis and treatment, metastatic/disseminated, and ter-
minal phase for all ages, over time, and all countries was made. Af-
terdividingtotalprevalenceintothese3sequelae,weattributedthe
remaining prevalence to the remission phase.
To calculate YLDs, the prevalence for each sequela was multi-
pliedwithadisabilityweight.Additionaldisabilitywasestimatedfor
procedures and procedure-related morbidities associated with the
treatment of breast, larynx, colorectal, bladder, and prostate can-
cer (mastectomy, laryngectomy, stoma, urinary incontinence, and
impotence) under the assumption that these are major disabling
sequelae after cancer treatment. Disability weights used for the
different sequelae as well as methods to determine disability
prevalence for these cancer-related outcomes can be found in the

Results
Global Incidence, Mortality, and DALYs
In2015,therewere17.5millionincidentcancercasesworldwideand
8.7millioncancerdeaths,asdetailedinTable1.Cancercaused208.3
million DALYs in 2015, of which 96% came from YLLs and 4% came
from YLDs (Web Table 3). At the global level, the odds of develop-
ing cancer during a lifetime (age 0-79 years) differed between the
sexes: they were 1 in 3 for men and 1 in 4 for women (eTable 16 in
the Supplement). These odds differ substantially among SDI cat-
egories.InthelowestSDIquintile,theoddsofdevelopingcancerfor
men aged between 0 and 79 years were 1 in 6, whereas in the high-
est SDI quintile, 1 in 2 men developed cancer. For women, the odds
of developing cancer was 1 in 5 in the lowest SDI quintile and 1 in 3
in the highest quintile.

cer,andcolorectalcancerwerethemostcommonincident(95%UI)

with 1.6 million (1.3-2.2 million), 1.4 million (1.3-1.5 million), and
920 000 (878 000-965 000) cases, respectively (Table 1). The
mostcommoncausesofcancerdeathsformenwereTBL,liver,and
stomach cancer with 1.21 (1.16-1.25) million, 577 000 (524 000-
622 000), and 535 000 (516 000-556 000) deaths, respectively.
TheleadingcausesforcancerDALYsin2015formenwereTBL,liver,
and stomach cancer, with 25.9 million (25.0-27.0 million), 15.4 mil-
lion (14.0-16.7 million), and 11.7 million (11.2-12.2 million), respec-
tively.Forwomenin2015,themostcommonincidentcancerswere
breast, colorectal, and TBL cancer, with 2.4 million (2.2-2.5 mil-
lion), 733 000 (702 000-767 000), and 640 000 (602 000-
690 000), respectively. These cancers were responsible for 46%
of all incident cases among women. The leading causes of cancer

391 000) deaths, respectively. Breast, TBL, and colorectal cancer
were also the leading causes for female cancer DALYs in 2015, with
15.1 million (14.2-15.9 million), 10.5 million (10.1-11.0 million), and 7.2
million (7.0-7.5 million), respectively.
Figure1showsthepatternofcancerincidenceandmortalityby
age group. For childhood cancers (age 0-14 years), the most com-
mon were leukemia, other neoplasms (see eTables 4 and 5 in the
SupplementforICDcodesincludedunder“
otherneoplasms”),non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and brain and nervous system cancers
(Figure1A).Leukemia,otherneoplasms,andbrainandnervoussys-
tem cancers were also the leading contributors to childhood can-
cerdeaths(Figure1B).Foradolescentsandyoungadults(age15-39
years)themostcommoncancersatthegloballevelwerebreastcan-
cer, cervical cancer, and other neoplasms. The main causes of can-
cer deaths for this age group were leukemia, other neoplasms, and
livercancer.Forthepopulationolderthan39years,thecancerscon-
tributingthemostincidentcaseswereTBL,breast,prostate,andco-
lorectalcancer,whilethemaincontributorstocancerdeathsinthis
age group were TBL, stomach, and colorectal cancer.
Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates
(ASIRs) for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries
or territories (Figure 2). China was a notable exception, with a 12%
decrease in cancer incidence. In contrast, age-standardized death
rates (ASDR) for all cancers combined decreased within that time-
frame in 140 of 195 countries or territories, as shown in Figure 3,

incidence fell by 9% (−24.3% to 8.3%) and 4% (−17.7% to 14.0%),
respectively,andcervicalcancerinmiddle,high-middle,andhighSDI
countries, with a 5% (−19.6% to 12.3%), 5% (−14.3 to 6.2), and 2%
(−7.4%to2.9%)decrease,respectively(WebTable1).However,these
decreases were not statistically significant. The largest increase in
cancer incident cases between 2005 and 2015 occurred in low SDI
countries, with a 50% increase, of which population growth con-
tributed33%,changingage-specificincidencerates13%,andchang-

middle SDI countries, with a 28% increase, and middle SDI coun-
tries, with a 27% increase (eTable 15 in the Supplement).

(Table1).BreastcancerwastheleadingcauseofcancerinallSDIquin-
tiles except for the high and high-middle SDI quintiles where it was
thesecondmostcommoncancer(Figure4).Itwasthecauseofdeath
for523 000(95%UI,492 000-543 000)womenand10 000(95%
UI, 9000-11 000) men, making it the fifth leading cause of cancer
deaths for both sexes in 2015 at the global and the low SDI coun-
tries, the fourth leading cause in high SDI countries, the sixth lead-
ingcauseinhigh-middleandmiddleSDIcountries,andthethirdlead-
ingcauseinthelow-middleSDIquintile(Figure5).Forwomen,breast
cancer was the leading cause of death in 2015 (Table 1). Breast can-
cer caused 15.4 million (95% UI, 14.4-16.2 million) DALYs for both
sexes, of which 88% came from YLLs, and 12% from YLDs (eFigure
13 in the Supplement). One in 14 women and 1 in 603 men devel-
opedbreastcancerbetweenbirthandage79years(eTable16inthe
Supplement) at the global level. For women, the odds of develop-
ing breast cancer were the highest in high SDI countries, with 1 in 9
women developing breast cancer, compared with the lowest odds
of 1 in 20 women in middle SDI countries developing breast cancer
between age 0 and 79 years.
For women (per 100 000 person-years) in 2015, ASIRs (95%
UIs) and ASDRs (95% UIs) were the lowest in East Asia: ASIR 35.8
(27.5-45.4), ASDR 8.2 (6.9-9.3); South Asia: ASIR 44.4 (37.1-52.3),
ASDR 11.9 (10.6-12.9); and Andean Latin America: ASIR 47.2 (39.6-
54.6), ASDR 10.5 (9.1-12) (Web Tables 1 and 2). They were the high-
est in high-income North America: ASIR 124.8 (115.9-145.4), ASDR
19.9(18.9-23.2);WesternEurope:ASIR124.7(116.3-138.3),ASDR21.8
(20.5-23.6);andAustralasia:ASIR123.7(112.5-137.9),ASDR19.8(18.3-
21.4).

Breast cancer was the most common cancer for women in 183
countriesorterritoriesandthemostcommoncauseofcancerdeaths
in women in 115 countries or territories (eFigures 10 and 12 in the
Supplement).

Overall incident cases increased by 43% because of population
growth (contributing an additional 13%) and aging (contributing
15%).TheASIR(95%UI)forwomen(per100 000person-years)be-
tween 2005 and 2015 increased by 12% (95% UI, 4.3%-19.5%) at
the global level from 58.5 (55.7-61.9) to 65.5 (61.7-68.8). The larg-
estincreaseoccurredinlowSDIcountries,witha26%increase,from
52.8(43.8-70.2)to66.4(51.3-88.2).ASIRatthegloballevelandfor
all SDI quintiles increased since 1990 (Figure 7). Age-standardized
DALY rates (95% UI) for women between 2005 and 2015 de-
creased by 6% (−12.1% to −1.0%) at the global level, with the larg-
est decrease of 10% (−17.9% to −3.3%) in high-middle SDI coun-
tries and the largest increase in low SDI countries of 10% (−12.5%
to 38.5%), which was not statistically significant (Web Table 3).
2. Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer
In 2015, there were 2 million (95% UI, 1.9-2.1 million) incident cases
of TBL cancer and 1.7 million (95% UI, 1.67-1.77 million) deaths. Tra-
cheal, bronchus, and lung cancer caused 36.4 million (95% UI, 35.4-
37.6 million) DALYs in 2015, of which 99% came from YLLs and 1%
from YLDs (eFigure 13 in the Supplement). Men were more likely to
developTBLcancerthanwomen,with1in18menand1in45women
developing TBL cancer between birth and age 79 years (eTable 16 in
theSupplement).TheoddswerethehighestinhighSDIcountries,with
1in13menand1in27womendevelopingTBLcancer.InlowSDIcoun-
tries the odds were substantially lower, with 1 in 70 men and 1 in 199

TBL cancer ranked seventh (Figure 5).
ASIRsandASDRs(95%UI)(per100 000person-years)formen
were the lowest in Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa: ASIR 8.6 (6.9-10.7),
ASDR 10.3 (8.1-13.0); Central Sub-Saharan Africa: ASIR 11.7 (7.8-17.0),
ASDR14.2(9.3-20.9);andWesternSub-SaharanAfrica:ASIR12.8(10.7-
16.5), ASDR 13.9 (11.4-17.4). They were the highest in men in high-
income North America: ASIR 70.9 (66.3-75.7), ASDR 50.3 (48.3-
52.3);CentralEurope:ASIR70.5(66.5-75.0),ASDR61(58.6-63.1);and
high-income Asia Pacific: ASIR 67.5 (62.8-72.4), ASDR 42.1 (40.5-
43.8). For women in 2015, incidence rates were the lowest in East-
ern Sub-Saharan Africa: ASIR 2.7 (2.0-3.6), ASDR 3.2 (2.3-4.2);

(12.0-13.2). (Web Tables 1 and 2). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung can-
cer was the cause of the most incident cases for men in 38 countries
andthemostcommoncauseforcancerdeathsin113countriesorter-
ritories (eFigures 9 and 11 in the Supplement). For women, TBL can-
cerwasthemostcommoncauseofcancerdeathsin20countriesand

Between 2005 and 2015, TBL cancer cases increased by 29%
(95%UI,21.5%-37.0%)(WebTable1).Populationgrowthalonecon-
tributed 13%. Aging of the population contributed 18% of the total
increase. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in age-
specific rates, which would have led to a 2% decrease in incidence
if the age structure and population size had remained constant be-
tween 2005 and 2015. Figure 8 shows slightly decreasing ASIR at
the global level for men and increasing trends for women between
1990and2015.Thistrendwasmuchmorepronouncedforthehigh

3. Colon and Rectum Cancer
In2015,therewere1.7million(95%UI,1.6-1.7million)incidentcases
of colon and rectum cancer, and it caused 832 000 (95% UI,
812 000-855 000)deaths(Table1).Colonandrectumcancercaused
17 million (95% UI, 16.6-17.5 million) DALYs in 2015 of which 96%
came from YLLs and 4% came from YLDs (eFigure 13 in the Supple-
ment).Theoddsofdevelopingcolonandrectumcancerbeforeage
79 years at the global level was higher for men than for women (1 in
28 men, 1 in 43 women, eTable 16 in the Supplement). The highest
oddswereinthehighSDIquintile,with1in14menand1in23women

eighthmostcommoncancerandwasthesixthleadingcauseforcan-
cer mortality.
As can be seen in Web Tables 1 and 2, in 2015 ASIRs and ASDRs
(95% UI) per 100 000 person-years for men were the lowest in
South Asia: ASIR 8.2 (6.9-9.5), ASDR 6.3 (5.8-6.8); Central Sub-
Saharan Africa: ASIR 8.7 (5.9-12.9), ASDR 9.5 (6.4-14.1); and West-
ernSub-SaharanAfrica:ASIR9.0(7.4-12.2),ASDR8.7(7.2-11.1).Rates
were highest in Australasia: ASIR 86.4 (76.1-98.5), ASDR 21.3 (19.9-
22.9); high-income Asia Pacific: ASIR 78.7 (74.3-83.4), ASDR 21.8
(21.1-22.6); and Western Europe: ASIR 60.0 (56.7-63.3), ASDR 21.9
(20.9-22.8). For women, rates in 2015 were the lowest in Western
Sub-SaharanAfrica:ASIR7.1(5.6-9.8),ASDR7.1(5.6-10.1);SouthAsia:

inTable2,between2005and2015,incidence(95%UI)increasedby
37%(32.1%-41.0%)from1.2million(1.19-1.24million)to1.7million(1.6-
1.7 million) cases. Most of this increase can be explained by an aging
andgrowingpopulation,however,evenwiththesamepopulationsize
and age structure, colon and rectum cancer cases would have in-
creased by 5% between 2005 and 2015 reflecting a change in age-
specific incidence rates.
Figure9showssimilartrendsinASIRsbetweenmenandwomen
for all levels of SDI except for the high-middle SDI quintile, where
trendsaredecreasinginwomenbutincreasinginmen.Ascanbeseen
in Web Table 1, ASIRs (95% UIs) have increased by 7% (1.8%-11.6%)
between 2005 and 2015 for men but have remained stable for
women at the global level: −0.2% (−4.3% to 4.4%). The largest in-
crease occurred in low-middle SDI countries at 25% (10.3%-
40.2%) for men and 13% (0.7%-27.4%) for women.
Between2005and2015,age-standardizedDALYratesforboth
sexes decreased by 8% (−10.2% to −6.2%) at the global level, with
the largest decrease in high-SDI countries of 11% (−13.6% to −9.1%)
and the largest (nonsignificant) increase in the low SDI quintile of
9% (−6.0% to 27.8%) (Web Table 3).
4. Prostate Cancer
In2015,therewere1.6million(95%UI,1.3-2.2million)incidentcases
of prostate cancer and 366 000 (95% UI, 303 000-460 000)
deaths. Prostate cancer caused 6.3 million (95% UI, 5.2-7.9 million)
DALYs globally in 2015, with 82% coming from YLLs and 18% from

Illustrated data include the percentage change in absolute YLLs (A-YLLs) and
the percentage change in the age-standardized YLL (AS-YLL) rate between
2005 and 2015;. The “
other cancers”group is not included in these data
because it contains multiple different types of cancers. Solid lines connecting
the 2005 and 2015 charts indicate increased or unchanged rank for the
connected cancers; dotted lines indicate decreased rank.

ASIRs and ASDRs (95% UIs) for prostate cancer in 2015 were
the lowest in South Asia: ASIR 11.5 (8.1-17.5), ASDR 7.2 (5.4-9.1); East
Asia: ASIR 12.1 (8.6-16.9), ASDR 6.6 (5.0-8.5); and Central Sub-
SaharanAfrica:ASIR20.5(12.7-29.8),ASDR17.6(11.1-25.1).Theywere

20.8 (16.3-30.4) (Web Tables 1 and 2).
In 2015, prostate cancer was the cancer with the highest inci-
dence for men in 103 countries or territories, and the leading cause
of cancer deaths for men in 29 countries (eFigures 9 and 11 in the
Supplement).
Prostatecancerranked14thin2005and12thin2015forcancer

middle SDI countries (17.6; 12.9-22.5) and the highest in high SDI
countries (123.6; 92.6-181.7). ASIRs have been increasing in all SDI
quintiles between 1990 and 2015, with the largest increase in the
high-SDI countries (Figure 10). Age-standardized DALY rates (95%
UIs) in men were the highest in low SDI countries (368.2; 249.3-
476.1) and the second highest in high SDI countries (302.4; 231.0-
432.0) (Web Table 3).

DALYs in 2015 with 98% coming from YLLs and 2% coming from
YLDs (eFigure 13 in the Supplement). One in 27 men and 1 in 68
women develop stomach cancer before age 79 years. The highest
oddsformenoccurredinmiddleSDIcountries(1in25),whereasthe
lowest occurred in low-middle SDI countries (1 in 48). For women,
the highest odds were in low SDI countries (1 in 58) and the lowest
in low-middle SDI countries (1 in 83) (eTable 16 in the Supplement).
GloballyandforhighSDIcountries,stomachcancerrankedfifthfor

ach cancer ranked third for incidence. For cancer mortality in high-
middle,middle,andlowSDIcountries,stomachcancerrankedthird.
For low-middle SDI countries it ranked second for cancer mortality.

Stomach cancer was highest in absolute incidence in 2015 for
menin26countriesandterritoriesandwastheleadingcauseofcan-
cer deaths in 11 countries (eFigures 9 and 11 in the Supplement). For
women it was the leading cause of cancer deaths in 4 countries
(eFigure 12 in the Supplement).
Stomachcancerhasremainedthethirdhighestcauseforcrude
cancer YLLs between 2005 and 2015, with a 7% decrease in abso-
lute YLLs due to stomach cancer (Figure 6). If the population age
structureandsizehadremainedthesamein2015asitwasin2005,
incidence would have dropped by 21% due to decreasing rates
(Table2).ASIRshavedroppedsubstantiallysince1990attheglobal
level and for all SDI quintiles except the low SDI quintile (Figure 11).
Between2005and2015,age-standardizedDALYsforbothsexes
decreased by 27% (95% UI, −29.4% to −24.5%) globally, with the
largest decrease in high-middle SDI countries of 32% (95% UI,
−35.8% to −27.5%) (Web Table 3).
6. Liver Cancer
In 2015, there were 854 000 (95% UI, 768 000-961 000) inci-
dent cases for liver cancer globally and 810 000 (750 000-
863 000) deaths. Liver cancer caused 20.6 million (19-22 million)
DALYs in 2015 with 99% coming from YLLs and 1% coming from
YLDs (eFigure 13 in the Supplement). Liver cancer was more com-
mon in men, with 1 in 45 men developing liver cancer before age 79
years compared with 1 in 113 women at the global level. The highest
odds of developing liver cancer was in middle SDI countries, with 1
in 38 men and 1 in 96 women developing liver cancer, whereas the
lowestoddswereseeninlow-middleSDIcountries,with1in98men
and 1 in 144 women developing liver cancer during their lifetime
(eTable16intheSupplement).Globally,livercancerrankedsixthfor
cancer incidence and fourth for cancer deaths in 2015, as shown in
Figures 4 and 5. In low SDI countries, it ranked fourth for cancer in-
cidence and first for cancer mortality, whereas in middle and high-
middleSDIcountriesitrankedfourthandsixth,respectively,forcan-
cer incidence but second for cancer mortality.
ASIRs (95% UIs) (per 100 000 person-years) were the highest

In 2015, ASIRs and ASDRs (95% UIs) for men were the lowest
in South Asia: ASIR 4.7 (3.8-6.2), ASDR 5.1 (4.5-5.9); Southern Latin

44.1); and Central Sub-Saharan Africa: ASIR 24.4 (13.4-42.7), ASDR
29.4 (15.9-50.3). For women, rates were the lowest in South Asia:
ASIR 3.2 (2.4-4.5), ASDR 3.1 (2.6-3.6); Australasia: ASIR 3.6 (2.4-
6.2),ASDR2.3(2.0-2.6);andSouthernLatinAmerica:ASIR4.0(3.3-

ASIR 10.9 (7.0-15.8), ASDR 10.9 (7.0-15.8) (Web Tables 1 and 2).
Livercancerwasthemostcommonlydiagnosedcancerin2015

common cause of cancer deaths in 40 countries (eFigure 11 in the
Supplement).Livercancerwasthemostcommonlydiagnosedcan-
cer for women in Mongolia (eFigure 10 in the Supplement) in 2015
and the leading cause of cancer deaths for women in 5 countries in
2015 (eFigure 12 in the Supplement).
Liver cancer remained the second leading cause of cancer YLLs
between 2005 and 2015 (Figure 6). Aging and population growth
werethedriversoftheincreasefrom709 000(616 000-782 000)
casesin2005to854 000(768 000-961 000)casesin2015,assum-
marized in Table 2. If the population age structure and size had re-
mained the same in 2015 as they were in 2005, 8% fewer cases of
livercancerwouldhavebeendiagnosedin2015thanin2005.Glob-
ally, ASIRs slowly decreased since the late 1990s (Figure 12). This
global trend, however, masks an increase in low and high SDI coun-
tries since 1990. ASIRs have been increasing for low SDI countries
since 1990; in high SDI countries, rates decreased until the early
2000s for men and the late 2000s for women and then increased.
Between2005and2015,age-standardizedDALYratesforlivercan-
cer decreased for both sexes by 17% (95% UI, −21.4% to −8.7%) at

In 2015, there were 666 000 (95% UI, 584 000-710 000) incident
casesofNHLand231 000(95%UI,196 000-244 000)deaths.Non-
Hodgkinlymphomacaused6.3million(95%UI,5.4-6.6million)DALYs
in 2015, with 95% coming from YLLs and 5% from YLDs (eFigure 13
in the Supplement). One in 78 men and 1 in 110 women at the global
leveldevelopedNHLbetweenbirthandage79years.Thehighestodds
fordevelopingNHLwereinhighSDIcountrieswith1in44menand1
in 63 women developing NHL. The lowest odds occurred in low SDI
countries, with 1 in 148 men and 1 in 190 women developing NHL.
Globally, for both sexes combined in 2015, NHL ranked sev-
enth for cancer incidence and 11th for cancer deaths (Figures 4 and
5). The highest rank for the incidence of NHL was in low SDI coun-
tries, where it was fifth. However, NHL cancer in low SDI countries
ranked only 11th for death.
Web Tables 1 and 2 illustrate that incidence and death rates in

(7.9-10.1), ASDR 5.1 (4.6-5.6) (Web Tables 1 and 2).
Leukemia led incident cases in 2015 for men in 5 countries
(eFigure 9 in the Supplement). It remained the sixth leading cause
of cancer YLLs between 2005 and 2015, with a 6% (95% UI, 2.5%-
9.9%)increaseinabsoluteYLLsandan8%(95%UI,−11.1%to−4.9%)
decrease in age-standardized YLLs (Figure 6).
Between 2005 and 2015, incident cases at the global level in-
creased from 481 000 (95% UI, 456 000-512 000) to 606 000
(95%UI,573 000-643 000)(totalincreaseof26%(95%UI,19.6%-
33.2%); population growth and aging were the drivers behind this
increase. Had the population growth and age-specific rates re-
mained the same as in 2005, there would be only 3% more cases
of leukemia in 2015 (Table 2). Increasing trends in ASIRs are similar
forallSDIquintilesexceptforcountriesinthehigh-middleSDIgroup,
where rates have decreased since the 2000s (Figure 14).

to 22.8), although this increase was not significant (Web Table 3).
9. Bladder Cancer
In 2015, there were 541 000 (95% UI, 517 000-567 000) incident
cases for bladder cancer globally and 188 000 (95% UI, 183 000-
193 000) deaths. Bladder cancer caused 3.4 million (95% UI, 3.3-
3.5million)DALYsin2015,with92%comingfromYLLsand8%from
YLDs(eFigure13intheSupplement).Bladdercancerwasmorecom-
mon in men, with 1 in 59 men being diagnosed before age 79 years
comparedwith1in239women.Theoddsofdevelopingbladdercan-
cer during a lifetime were the highest in high-SDI countries (1 in 36
men and 1 in 165 women) and the lowest in low-SDI countries (1 in
122 men and 1 in 310 women) (eTable 16 in the Supplement). Glob-
ally, bladder cancer ranked ninth for cancer incidence and 13th for

In 2015, ASIRs and ASDRs (95% UIs) for men were the lowest
in Oceania: ASIR 4.5 (3.6-5.8), ASDR 2.3 (1.9-2.9); Andean Latin
America: ASIR 5.8 (4.7-7.2), ASDR 2.1 (1.9-2.4); and Central Latin

Bladder cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer in
2015 for men in Egypt (eFigure 9 in the Supplement). Globally, it
dropped from the 17th to the 18th leading cause of cancer YLLs be-
tween2005and2015(Figure6).Agingandpopulationgrowthwere
the drivers of the increase: from 413 000 (95% UI, 403 000-
424 000) cases in 2005 to 541 000 (95% UI, 517 000-567 000)
cases in 2015 (Table 2). If population age structure and size had re-
mained the same in 2015 as they were in 2005, bladder cancer in-
cidence would have been stable. However, population growth and
aging led to a 31% increase in incident cases. Worldwide, as well as
inhighandhigh-middleSDIcountries,ASIRspeakedinthelate1990s

creased in the low and low-middle quintiles. Between 2005 and
2015,age-standardizedDALYrates(95%UIs)forbothsexesforblad-
der cancer decreased by 9% (−11.5% to −6.2%) at the global level,
with the largest decrease in high-middle SDI countries by 13%
(−17.0% to −9.7%), and the largest (although nonsignificant) in-
crease in low SDI countries of 3% (−8.8% to 18.2%) (Web Table 3).
10. Cervical Cancer

In 2015, ASIRs and ASDRs per 100 000 person-years (95% UIs)
for women were the lowest in Australasia: ASIR 5.6 (4.8-6.5), ASDR
2.4 (2.2-2.7); North Africa and Middle East: ASIR 7.5 (5.8-9.3), ASDR

In2015,cervicalcancerwasthemostcommonlydiagnosedcan-
cer for women in 11 countries (eFigure 10 in the Supplement) and
the most common cause of cancer deaths for women in 50 coun-
tries (eFigure 12 in the Supplement).
Cervical cancer dropped from the ninth to the tenth leading
cause for cancer YLLs between 2005 and 2015, with a 19% (95%
UI,−25.8%to−12.0%)decreaseinage-standardizedYLLs(Figure6).
Totalincidencewouldhavedecreasedby26%ifthepopulationsize
and age structure had remained the same as in 2005 due to de-
creasing incidence rates (Table 2). ASIRs decreased globally for all
SDI quintiles (Figure 16). Between 2005 and 2015, age-
standardized DALYs decreased globally in women by 19% (95%
UI, −23.9% to −12.2%) with rates decreasing by 17% to 23% in
low-middle, middle, high-middle, and high SDI countries, but only
by 13% (95% UI, −32.6% to 10.0%) in low SDI countries (Web
Table 3).
Trends in Incidence for Less Common Cancers
Incidence (95% UI) for both sexes increased substantially between
2005 and 2015 for certain cancers, as summarized in Table 2. Thy-
roid cancer cases almost doubled between 2005 and 2015, from
168 000 (160 000-178 000) to 334 000 (310 000-353 000)
cases. Seventy-one percent of this change can be explained by an
increase in age-specific incidence rates (Table 2). At the same time,
the age-standardized YLL rate for thyroid cancer decreased signifi-
cantlyby7%(95%UI,−15.0%to−2.3%)(Figure6).Melanomacases
increased from 225 000 (187 000-289 000) in 2005 to 352 000
(282 000-445 000) in 2015, a 56% (95% UI, 48.0%-63.9%) in-
crease. Twenty-eight percent of the change can be explained by an
increase in the age-specific incidence rates (Table 2). Kidney can-
cercasesincreasedby53%(95%UI,45.7%-59.7%)between2005
and 2015 (from 279 000 (271 000-288 000) to 425 000
(405 000-447 000), with age-specific rates contributing 23% to
this total increase. Mesothelioma has increased from 26 000
(25 000-27 000)to37 000(35 000-29 000)casesbetween2005
and 2015, a 40% (33.4%-47.0%) increase, of which 9% can be at-
tributed to a rise in age-specific rates.

exceptions, the complex health care infrastructure required to treat
cancerisgenerallylacking.24Effortsareongoingtoexpandtheexist-
ingresourcesintheregiontoallowforimprovedcancercare.25-28Can-
cer prevention efforts may, however, be as important as delivery of
care, given the profile of cancer in low SDI countries where the top 3
leading causes of cancer mortality (liver cancer, cervical cancer, and
stomach cancer) are largely preventable.

for high SDI countries have increased since 1990, and rates for low
SDI countries increased in the most recent observations (from 2010
to2015).Thesefindingsareconsistentwithobservationsinsomehigh-

by health authorities and is expected to reduce cervical cancer inci-

tries where it ranks second (Figure 5) is widely recognized by the in-
ternationalcommunity;anemergingpoliticalcommitmenttoreduc-
ingthisgapwillhopefullytranslateintoadecreasedburdenofcervical
cancer in the most affected countries.36 Our results show that prog-
ress in reducing cervical cancer burden was the slowest in low SDI
countries where the decrease in ASIRs and ASDRs was the lowest; a
12% decrease in ASIR occurred for countries at low SDI compared to
a greater than 14% decrease in all other SDI quintiles, and a 14% de-
crease in ASDR in low SDI compared to the other SDI quintiles, with
decreases in ASDR of greater than 16%.
Stomachcancerrateshavebeendeclininggloballyfordecades.37
However, our results demonstrate that this trend has not been uni-
form among the SDI quintiles. ASIRs in the lowest SDI quintile in-
creasedthroughouttheGBDstudytimeframe(1990to2015).Inthe
highest SDI quintile, rates declined until 2010 but have since in-
creased.Onepossibleexplanationistheincreasingtrendofgastriccan-
cer of the cardia in high-income countries owing to risk factors such
asobesity,althoughthemechanismexplainingthisassociationisnot
fully understood.37-39 Treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection,
whichcausesabout78%ofallstomachcancers,reducesgastriccan-
cer incidence, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) recommends that countries investigate whether population-
basedscreeningandtreatmentprogramsforHpyloriareindicated.40,41
Despite this recommendation, few countries with high incidence of
stomach cancer have implemented populationwide screening pro-
grams. Although studies have shown reductions in stomach cancer
mortality in screened populations, the target group, onset, and mo-
dality of screening programs remain controversial.37,42-46
Prevention and treatment of carcinogenic infections that lead
totheseobservedcancerpatternsinlowSDIcountrieshavethepo-
tential to decrease future cancer burden as well as reducing asso-
ciated diseases like cirrhosis in endemic areas.47 In addition, limit-
ing transmission can lead to prevention efforts that are sustained
beyond 1 generation.10
Thedominanceofinfection-relatedcancersinlowSDIcountries
is an exceptional pattern compared with the leading causes of can-
cer deaths for countries in higher SDI quintiles, where TBL, colorec-
tal, stomach, liver, and breast cancer lead the rankings. The impor-
tance of tobacco control as a crucial cancer control strategy should
thereforenotbeunderestimated,especiallysincetobaccocontrolhas
healthbenefitsreachingfarbeyondcancerprevention.48Effectivepri-
mary and secondary prevention strategies are available for colorec-
tal cancer with many risk factors being attributed to “Western
lifestyles.”
49Increasedphysicalexercise,avoidanceofprocessedmeat,
alcohol, and tobacco, as well as aspirin use have all been associated
withreducedcolorectalcancerincidence.49-52Multiplemodalitiesfor

cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer incidence, death, and
DALYs in women, should be emphasized. However, even in the set-
tingofpopulationwideprimarypreventionefforts,itisestimatedthat
onlybetween20%and50%ofbreastcancercanbeprevented.48,56
Therefore, breast cancer control strategies must also focus on early
detection in addition to effective treatment. Early detection strate-
gies can range from improving breast cancer awareness and clinical
breast examination in basic resource settings to mammography
screening.57Clearly,cancercontrolstrategiesfocusedonearlydetec-
tion should also target access to the full spectrum of care including
surgical, medical, and radiation oncology; affordable chemothera-
peutics and supportive drugs; and survivorship support and pallia-
tive and hospice care.58 This is imperative not only for breast cancer
but for comprehensive cancer care in general.
Thevariationintheleadingcausesofcancerincidenceandmor-
tality between countries documented in the GBD study are remark-
able. The largest ranges in rankings for cancer mortality were found
in cervical cancer, acute lymphoid leukemia, and nasopharynx can-
cer followed by esophageal, lip and oral cavity, gallbladder and bili-
ary tract cancer, and melanoma (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). For
cancer incidence, the largest divergence was seen in esophageal

A detailed analysis of the reasons behind the observed varia-
tion in cancer burden goes beyond the scope of this analysis. How-
ever,thecitedexamplesshowthatthedescriptiveepidemiologyap-
proachoftheGBDstudycanidentifypatternsofcancerburdenthat
can be hypothesis generating. This is especially true when cancer
burden is analyzed in conjunction with nonmalignant diseases that
might share similar risk factors—a potential provided by the com-
prehensive nature of the GBD approach.
Limitations
AsinpriorGBDstudies,ourestimatesdependonthequalityandquan-
tityofthedatasourcesavailabletoinformtheestimates.Becauseof
the lag time for data reporting, estimates for 2015 are mainly based
ondataandtrendsfromrecentyears.Formanycountries,datasources
for informing cancer burden estimation are still sparse, and the GBD
estimates rely heavily on covariate selection in the models and re-
gionalpatterns.Onlyanestimated38%ofdeathsworldwidewerereg-
isteredin2012.66Alternativedatasourcesforcancermortality,such
as verbal autopsy, are substantially less reliable.67 To overcome the
limitation from lack of data sources, the GBD study includes cancer
incidencedatafromregistriesinthemortalityestimation.Cancerreg-
istration has a long tradition in many countries. However, in regions
where the burden of cancer is expected to grow significantly due to
anticipatedpopulationgrowthandaging,cancerregistriesoftenonly
cover a small fraction of the population, are of low quality, or do not
exist.68Comparedwithalmostcompletecoverageofthepopulation
with high-quality cancer registration in Nordic countries or North
America,lessthan10%ofthepopulationinSouthAmerica,Asia,and
Africa are covered by high-quality cancer registries.68 With techno-
logical innovation, including an improved ability to identify and link
differenttypesofdatasources,cancersurveillancewillhopefullybe-
come a routine component of every health care system. Endeavors
liketheGlobalInitiativeforCancerRegistryDevelopment(http://gicr
.iarc.fr) play a major role in this task.
Cancermortalityestimatesarepredominantlybasedonvitalreg-
istrationdata,cancerregistrydata,andtoamuchlesserextentother
data sources. If a large proportion of deaths are miscoded, the re-
distributionoftheseso-calledgarbagecodescansubstantiallyaffect
mortalityestimates.SinceGBDcancerincidenceestimatesarebased
on mortality estimates, garbage code redistribution directly af-
fects cancer incidence. Misclassification of metastatic sites as pri-
mary cancer sites (eg, liver, lung, brain) is another source of poten-
tial bias, especially in locations with limited diagnostic resources.
Changesincodingpracticesorcodingsystemsmayalsohaveanef-
fect, even though mapping to the GBD causes list includes adjust-
ments to account for different coding systems.69
Cervicalanduterinecancerincidenceratesarepotentiallyover-
estimated in the GBD in locations where hysterectomies are com-
mon, since rates are calculated without adjustments for the popu-
lation at risk.
For GBD 2015, we have updated the MI (mortality to incidence)
ratios and used out-of-sample validation of a set of potential models
to choose the most appropriate MI model. However, in young age
groups with sparse data, and in areas where no matching mortality
andincidencedataexist(whichisthecaseformostcountriesinSub-
Saharan Africa), the MI model is based on the combination of trends
for older age groups as well as covariate selection.
TheadditionoftheleukemiasubtypesfortheGBD2015studyis
anecessarystep;aggregating“leukemia”intoasingleentityisappro-
priate from neither a public health nor a clinical perspective. How-
ever, when interpreting the results, it is important to recognize that

kemiasubtypesaremostlyfromhigh-incomecountries.Anotherca-
veatisthatleukemiasubtypesarescaledtosumtotheleukemia“
par-
ent”cause, which can lead to incidence estimates for leukemia
subtypes that are different than what would be expected based on
theMIratioalone.Changesinclassificationofleukemiasubtypesover
time can also have an effect on the GBD estimates. With the wider
availability of cancer registry data, including childhood cancer regis-
tries, it is expected that estimates will continue to be adjusted in
future iterations of the GBD.
Conclusions
Despite significant reductions in cancer mortality in many coun-
tries,cancerposesabarriertofuturedevelopment.Incidenceisex-
pected to increase, straining resources even in countries with ad-
vanced health care systems. An expanding arsenal of cancer
prevention and treatment interventions, together with a political
commitment to address NCDs, offers hope that this threat can be
controlled. The GBD study enables timely tracking of progress to-
ward defined targets.23 Since most cancer prevention efforts have
amuchbroaderimpactthanjustreducingcancerincidence,theabil-
ity of the GBD to put single diseases into the perspective of popu-
lation health is unique and of the utmost importance.
