Recognizing motivationally salient information is critical to guiding behaviour. The amygdala
and hippocampus are thought to support this operation, but the circuit-level mechanism of
this interaction is unclear. We used direct recordings in the amygdala and hippocampus from
human epilepsy patients to examine oscillatory activity during processing of fearful faces
compared with neutral landscapes. We report high gamma (70–180 Hz) activation for fearful
faces with earlier stimulus evoked onset in the amygdala compared with the hippocampus.
Attending to fearful faces compared with neutral landscape stimuli enhances low-frequency
coupling between the amygdala and the hippocampus. The interaction between the amygdala
and hippocampus is largely unidirectional, with theta/alpha oscillations in the amygdala
modulating hippocampal gamma activity. Granger prediction, phase slope index and phase lag
analysis corroborate this directional coupling. These results demonstrate that processing
emotionally salient events in humans engages an amygdala-hippocampal network, with the
amygdala influencing hippocampal dynamics during fear processing.

wift detection of social, emotional or threatening stimuli is
critical for adaptive fitness in humans. When we interact
with each other, emotionally salient stimuli, such as fearful
facial expressions, provide ecologically relevant signals that
focus our attention towards perceptually relevant information.
Thus, recognizing motivationally salient information constitutes
an important social and biologically meaningful incentive and
plays a key role in guiding our interpersonal behaviour1.
Successful detection of and response to motivationally important
stimuli have been shown to rely on activity within two brain
structures—the amygdala and hippocampus. In particular, the
amygdala is critical for prioritizing salient information such as
emotion2, valence3 and motivation4. The hippocampus is thought
to be important for contextual modulation of fear5, emotion
judgment6 and emotional memory7—all operations that are critical
for remembering motivationally salient stimuli.
It is commonly assumed that the amygdala exerts directional
influence onto the hippocampus during processing of salient
information8. This network model of salience processing is
primarily based on rodent data. For example, the amygdala
receives direct subcortical inputs thought to facilitate rapid
detection of salient information9, consistent with a proposed
role of the amygdala in early cognitive engagement that may
influence subsequent hippocampal mnemonic processing. Several
studies also indicate that manipulating amygdala function
alters
hippocampal
processing
of
salient
information10–12.
Evidence for this directional influence in humans has only been
indirectly inferred from behaviour13 and neuroimaging14 studies
showing that memory enhancement for emotionally arousing
stimuli is positively associated with markers of endogenous
norepinephrine release from the basolateral amygdala (BLA)15.
However,
there
is
no
direct
electrophysiological
evidence
for amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in humans and thus
their directional relationship is unknown.
We addressed this question by presenting salient (dynamic
fearful faces) and neutral (landscapes) stimuli to patients with
medication resistant epilepsy in whom stereotactic electrodes
had been implanted in the amygdala and hippocampus for
pre-surgical evaluation. First, we hypothesized that high gamma
(HG; 70–180 Hz) band activity (a spatially precise measure
of neuronal spiking16) will occur earlier in the amygdala than
in the hippocampus, consistent with a directional relationship.
We
next
examined
the
electrophysiological
evidence
for connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus.
Low-frequency
oscillations
(theta ¼ 4–7 Hz
and
alpha ¼
8–12 Hz) are ubiquitous in the human hippocampus17 and
amygdala18; fear conditioning studies in rodents suggest that they
provide a temporal window for inter-regional communication19.
Therefore,
we hypothesized
that
low-frequency
oscillations
mediate functional connectivity between the amygdala and
hippocampus by coupling spiking activity in the hippocampus
(as indexed by the HG signal) to low-frequency oscillations in the
amygdala. Finally, consistent with the model of detection/
prioritization by the amygdala and post-detection processing by
the hippocampus10–12, we hypothesized that the synchronous
activity in these two regions would be biased such that it is more
likely that the amygdala exerts directional influence on the
hippocampus rather than the reverse.
In this study, we show that the amygdala and hippocampus are
both
engaged
in
the
early
stages
of
salience
processing
with increased intraregional HG activity and enhanced inter-
regional low-frequency synchrony when attending to aversive
compared with neutral stimuli. The coupling between these
two regions is predominantly unidirectional, with low-frequency
oscillations in the amygdala entraining hippocampal HG activity.
Overall, these results provide evidence for a directional influence
from the amygdala to the hippocampus during processing
of motivationally salient stimuli.
Results
Experiment design and electrode localization. We recorded
oscillatory activity in local field potentials (LFPs) from nine
human participants with intracranial depth electrodes implanted
into the amygdala and the hippocampus. Electro-oculogram
(EOG) electrodes and an eye tracker were used for one subject to
evaluate the potential influence of saccadic muscle movements on
neural signals. We examined neuronal responses while indivi-
duals watched aversive movie clips containing blocks of dynamic
fearful faces and neutral movie clips of landscapes (Fig. 1a). We
employed dynamic fearful faces as a form of aversive stimuli,
rather than static facial expressions, to provide participants
with temporal cues that mimic real-life social exchanges20.
The localization of depth electrodes was determined based on
co-registered pre- and post-implantation magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), as well as registration to a high-resolution
anatomical atlas, labelled with medial temporal lobe regions
of interest. Localization of each electrode was performed in
a semi-automated manner, guided by the anatomical atlas and
visually checked by an experienced rater (S.L.L.). In all subjects,
there were two to three depth electrodes located in the BLA and
one to three electrodes located in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus
(DG)/CA3 or CA1, Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). A three-
dimensional rendering of the amygdala and hippocampus showed
that for all subjects, the electrodes were located in the basal
aspects of the amygdala and the anterior hippocampus (Fig. 1c).
Local power and event-related potentials. Neuronal networks
typically demonstrate activity in several oscillatory bands that
cover both low- and high-frequency spectra with distinct roles in
neuronal communication21. Whereas high gamma band activity
is a spatially precise measure of local neuronal population
spiking16, temporal synchronization of low-frequency phase is
thought to mediate inter-regional communication22. Therefore,
we
first
determined
the
spectral
specificity
of
low-
and
high-frequency oscillations in LFP. The power spectral density
(PSD) plots revealed that each subject had a specific frequency
peak in the theta/alpha and high gamma frequency ranges
(Fig. 1d). These peaks are thought to reflect coherent oscillatory
processes23. We then band passed the raw LFP signal to
extract
separate
frequency
components.
These
analyses
showed that the low frequency of the amygdala and high
gamma band power envelope of the hippocampus tended to
co-occur in time during the aversive condition (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Additional analyses demonstrated that event-related
potentials (ERP; Supplementary Fig. 3) and ocular muscle activity
(Supplementary Figs 4 and 5a,b) did not contaminate the neural
signals used in subsequent analyses.
Amygdala and hippocampus high gamma tracks salient sti-
muli. We explored the temporal profile of the oscillatory response
to fearful faces versus landscapes.
Electrodes localized in
the amygdala (BLA) and hippocampus (DG/CA3 þ CA1) with
high-resolution MRIs as shown in Fig. 1c were included in the
analysis. We then focused on the temporally resolved changes in
HG amplitude and examined the coordinated timing of amygdala
and hippocampus neuronal responses during the processing
of aversive compared with neutral stimuli (Fig. 1e). The onset
time was defined as the earliest time point at which two condi-
tions showed a significant difference in HG amplitudes; the
peak time was defined as the latency of the maximum magnitude
of differences in HG amplitudes between the conditions. The

Figure 1 | Task, electrode locations, power spectral density and high gamma activity. (a) Participants watched silent movie clips consisting of alternating
blocks of neutral (landscapes) and aversive stimuli (fearful faces). (b) Example MRI and template for a single subject. Electrodes were localized in each
participant using co-registered pre-implantation and post-implantation structural T1-weighted MRI scans. A high-resolution template of the hippocampal
subfields and amygdala nuclei was aligned to each participant’s pre-implantation scan to visualize electrode locations in subject-specific anatomical space.
Regions of interest (ROIs) in the medial temporal lobe included the DG/CA3, CA1, subiculum (Sub), perirhinal cortex (PrC), lateral and medial entorhinal
cortex (LEC, MEC), parahippocampal cortex (PhC), BLA, CeA and the CORT. Each electrode location was determined by selecting the centre of the
electrode (indicated by cross-hairs) and determining which ROI best encompassed the centre of the electrode. (c) Electrode localization of all subjects,

 average HG amplitude across trials was higher for the aversive
relative to the neutral condition after 123±18 ms (mean±s.e.m.)
in the amygdala and after 241±22 ms in the hippocampus
post-stimulus onset (onset time, t-test, Po0.05). Similarly,
HG activity peaked earlier in the amygdala compared with the
hippocampus (amygdala ¼ 493±31 ms versus hippocampus ¼
641±42 ms; peak time, t-test, Po0.05). These findings indicate
that the amygdala and hippocampus are both engaged in the
early stages of salience processing, with amygdala activation
preceding hippocampal activation.
Amygdala-hippocampal low-frequency coupling. Given the
distinct HG temporal profiles of the amygdala and hippocampus,
we then investigated whether these two regions interact through
low-frequency phase coupling. The inter-regional coordination
was examined with phase locking values (PLV) as a metric of
effective connectivity between electrodes targeting the amygdala
(red) and hippocampus (blue, Fig. 2). The three most medial
electrodes targeting the amygdala and four most medial electro-
des targeting the hippocampus were included in the phase
coupling analysis. Note that this selection criterion was agnostic
with regard to the experimental conditions (that is, aversive
versus neutral) and the magnitude of phase coupling. Because of
individual differences in the frequency of the event-related low-
frequency band, we first selected a specific band for each subject
centred on the low-frequency peak in the PSD (amygdala ¼
6.02±0.49 Hz;
hippocampus ¼ 6.51±0.16 Hz,
mean±s.e.m.,
Fig. 1d) with a bandwidth of 4 Hz (ref. 24). We characterized the
timing relationships of the low-frequency phase among all
electrode pairs for each subject and calculated the PLV within
and between the aversive and neutral conditions. Within each
condition,
amygdala-hippocampal
PLVs
were
significantly
increased compared with the null distribution (all Po0.05,
permutation test, Supplementary Fig. 6). We next tested PLV
differences across conditions and found enhanced PLV between
the low-frequency phases of BLA and the low-frequency phases of
DG/CA3 as well as CA1 hippocampal subfields while viewing
aversive compared with neutral movie clips (all Po0.05, per-
mutation test, Fig. 2).
To validate the role of low-frequency phase coupling in
coordinating amygdala-hippocampal network communication
during
processing
of
motivationally
salient
information,
we examined the PLV spectra between the most significant
phase coupling electrode pairs (denoted by asterisks in Fig. 2).
Across all subjects, the PLV increased when viewing aversive
fearful
faces
compared
with neutral
stimuli
(main effect:
F (1,67) ¼ 8.88, P ¼ 0.004) and peaked in the low-frequency
band for BLA-CA1 and BLA-CA3 compared with BLA- parahi-
ppocampal and BLA- subiculum electrode pairs (Supplementary
Fig. 7a). Further, the magnitude of low-frequency PLV varied
among hippocampal sub-regions (F (3,67) ¼ 2.88, P ¼ 0.042) with
the highest PLV observed for the BLA-CA1 electrode pairs. The
phase coupling between BLA and CA1/CA3 were significantly
greater than the other hippocampal sub-regions (t-test, Po0.05;
Supplementary
Fig.
7b).
These
findings
indicate
that
the amygdala and CA1/CA3 regions of the hippocampus
exhibit strong low-frequency synchrony during processing of
aversive stimuli.
Directional amygdala-hippocampus phase-amplitude coupling.
On the basis of the strong low-frequency phase coupling
between the amygdala and hippocampus across all subjects, we
then examined the directional influence of these responses with
phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) across the two structures.
To accomplish this, we again restricted our analysis to the
most significant low-frequency phase coupling electrode pairs
from the PLV analysis. Given that the electrodes with significant
local PAC are more likely to engage in inter-regional coher-
ence25,26, we first found that PAC within both the amygdala and
the hippocampus was increased when viewing aversive stimuli
compared with neutral stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 8). We then
examined the directional PAC between the amygdala and
hippocampus in the aversive condition compared with the
neutral condition (Fig. 3a). We found that the HG amplitude in
the hippocampus was phase locked to the amygdala low-
frequency rhythms (all Po0.01, permutation test, Fig. 3a). The
stronger coupling between the amygdala low-frequency phase
and the hippocampus HG power was also observed in the theta
trough-locked averaging of time–frequency plot in the aversive
condition
(Po0.05,
Supplementary
Fig.
9a),
while
this
modulation was nearly absent when examining the reverse
direction (for example, HG amplitude in the amygdala phase

 locked to the phase of hippocampal low-frequency activity.
Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 9b).
We also examined whether the PAC varied as a function of
the time lag between low-frequency and HG signals. We posited
that an amygdala to hippocampus directionality would result
in a conduction delay22, which would translate to a relative phase
shift between low-frequency and HG oscillations (Supplementary
Fig. 12). Specifically, an earlier phase of amygdala low-frequency
oscillations
entraining
hippocampal
HG
would
result
in
the strongest PAC. We found that in the aversive condition,
PAC between low frequency of the amygdala and HG of the
hippocampus peaked around zero time lag ( � 13.15±2.92 ms
versus hippocampus to amygdala directionality 13.52±22.83 ms),
with 7 out of 9 subjects demonstrating that the amygdala
low-frequency was leading the hippocampal HG (Fig. 3b, denoted
by þ near the red line, Pearson’s w2-test ¼ 6.73, P ¼ 0.035).
In contrast, PAC between amygdala HG and hippocampus
low-frequency was lower and failed to demonstrate a consistent
peak at any time lag.
Since spectrally broad transients such as evoked activity can
produce spurious PAC results27, we examined the spectral
specificity of the modulated HG activity from the PAC results.
To identify the rhythmic low-frequency fluctuation of the higher-
frequency power time series, we determined the centre frequency
of the HG signal from the PAC and filtered the raw signal
within the HG band to extract the analytic amplitude of
the signal (that is, envelope), which was then subjected to
the PSD analysis. All subjects showed individual narrow-band
low-frequency (4–12 Hz) peaks in the gamma envelope, thus
supporting oscillatory properties of a separate low-frequency
modulating signal in the HG band (Supplementary Fig. 10).
To examine potential influence of eye movements on the
PAC results, we ran an independent component analysis (ICA)
on the EOG combined with white matter referenced amygdala
and hippocampal activity in one participant (subject 9)28.
Components composed of EOG activity (three components,
based on mixing weights, Supplementary Fig. 4f) were removed
from the raw intracranial data and all analyses were re-run with
this ‘cleaned’ data. The observed PAC effect remained significant
after ICA correction (Supplementary Fig. 11). Further, there was
no significant PAC between EOG channels and the amygdala
as well as the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). These
findings indicate that eye movement contamination did not
contribute to the original results.

 utilized two complementary measures that rely on frequency
and phase respectively: spectral Granger causality and phase
slope index (PSI)29,30. The Granger causality measure quantifies
the strength of directional influences between LFPs in the
frequency domain by testing whether the LFP from one structure
(for
example,
hippocampus)
can
be
better
predicted
by
incorporating
information
from
the
LFP
from
the
other
structure (for example, amygdala) and vice versa. PSI quantifies
phase difference as a function of frequency, with a positive phase
slope indicating that the signal from the first structure is leading
the signal from the second structure. In low-frequency bands,
we
found
significant
Granger
causal
influence
from
the
amygdala to hippocampus but not in the reciprocal direction
(all Po0.01, permutation test, Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 13a) only for the aversive condition. Significant differences
between the aversive compared with the neutral condition
were evident in eight out of nine subjects (Supplementary
Fig. 14). The PSI analysis showed positive phase slopes from the
amygdala to the hippocampus for the aversive compared with the
neutral condition that remained significant between 0.58 and
1.16 s after stimulus onset (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 13b).
In the reverse direction, the PSI did not show a positive value
and there were no differences between the two conditions.
These findings provide converging evidence of the amygdala to
hippocampus directionality during processing of motivationally
salient information.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that processing of motivationally salient
stimuli depends on coordinated neural oscillations between
the amygdala and hippocampus, two critical nodes in the
emotion processing circuit. Prior works have suggested that the
amygdala rapidly detects salient stimuli, whereas the hippocam-
pus
engages
in
contextual
and
mnemonic
processing7,31;
however, the nature of their interaction and timing remains
unclear. The current findings show that the interaction between
the two structures is mediated by low-frequency phase coherence
and
that
this
relationship
is
directional,
with
amygdala
low-frequency oscillations entraining hippocampal gamma. Our
results
are
robust
across
individual
subjects
and
provide
a mechanism by which the amygdala influences hippocampal
activity during recognition and emotional memory of salient
information. We were able to disentangle the temporal dynamics
of the interaction between the amygdala and hippocampus during
processing of aversive stimuli by demonstrating an earlier post-
stimulus onset of HG activity in the amygdala (as early as 120 ms
post-stimulus) relative to the hippocampus (B240 ms post-
stimulus). Overall, these findings showed that salient stimuli are
processed with distinct temporal windows in the amygdala and
hippocampus. The early amygdala activity observed in this study
may reflect the fast automatic detection of motivational salience
of information, while the later hippocampal onset may indicate
formation or reactivation of emotional memory7,31.

 Previous research in affective processing using intracranial
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in humans has focused
on either the amygdala or hippocampus, but the oscillatory
mechanism mediating communication across the two structures
has remained unclear. Using retrograde tracing techniques
in
monkeys’
hippocampal
formation,
Amaral
and
Cowan
demonstrated that labelled neurons were found predominately
in
the
anterior
amygdaloid
area,
basolateral
nucleus
and
periamygdaloid cortex32. The perirhinal and parahippocampal
cortices have connections with the basolateral and accessory
nuclei33. Although the primate tracing study could not provide
anatomical specificity at the level of hippocampal subfields,
rodent studies have shown that the ventral CA1 region and,
to a lesser extent, CA3 receive the most robust amygdalar
inputs34.
Our
findings
are
consistent
with
these
known
anatomical connections.
We further demonstrate that amygdala-hippocampal interac-
tions were predominantly mediated through low-frequency
coherence.
Specifically,
the
PLV
between
the
amygdala
and hippocampus was enhanced when participants viewed fearful
faces compared with landscapes. Given the long temporal window
afforded
by
low-frequency
rhythms,
phase–phase
coupling
between different brain regions has been extensively studied
in animal emotional research to understand regulation of
inter-regional communication. In rodent models, the degree of
fearful memory retrieval35,36 and its long-term consolidation37
are directly related to the degree of theta synchrony across
the
amygdala
and
hippocampus,
implicating
synchronous
low-frequency oscillations as the neural correlate of fearful
memory in the medial temporal network. Our study utilizing
human intracranial EEG recording and precise medial temporal
lobe subfield segmentation provides high-resolution temporo-
spatial evidence for a similar oscillatory amygdala-hippocampal
network in human salience processing and converges with
the extant animal literature.
The directional influence of the amygdala onto hippocampus
in anxiety and fearful emotional responses is increasingly
recognized in animal models. Optogenetic manipulation of
this
circuit
has
demonstrated
that
selective
activation
of
BLA
terminals
within
the
ventral
hippocampus
increases
anxiety-related behaviour and reduces social interactions10.
During contextual fear learning, enhancement of GABA neuro-
transmission in the BLA promotes hippocampal dendritic spine
remodelling and fear retention, while blockade of GABA sites in
BLA ameliorates these structural and behavioural effects12.
In response to predatory threats, hippocampal place cells
showed unstable firing patterns and increased theta power, an
effect that was prevented by lesioning of the amygdala11.
Thus,
the
modulatory
effects
of
the
amygdala
on
the
hippocampus for processing of fearful stimuli are supported by
animal
studies
demonstrating
downstream
alterations
in
neurotransmission, structure and electrophysiology. Our results
provide confirmation of this directional modulation in humans
and provide evidence that this modulation is controlled by neural
oscillations.
Specifically,
amygdala
low-frequency
activity
modulates hippocampal HG via amygdala-hippocampal theta/
alpha synchrony during detection of motivationally salient
information, providing a mechanism for the computation of
local and long-range communication. These findings have
implications for understanding deficits in the processing of
salient environmental events in neuropsychiatric disorders with
altered oscillatory control38.
There are several limitations in the current study. First, the
two stimulus sets (fearful faces and landscapes) are inherently
different in their properties. Thus, although we performed
several analyses to show that evoked broadband activity did not
influence
the
obtained
results,
potential
contributions
of
evoked response could not be completely excluded. Second,
the stimuli lacked neutral faces to contrast fearful faces and
thus the differences between fearful faces and landscapes could
be attributed to fearful content, emotion, facial expression,
faces or other aversive stimuli. While our stimuli do not
specifically address processing of fearful faces, contrasting
fearful face movie clips with landscapes allows us to probe
oscillatory mechanisms underlying processing of motivationally
salient
information.
In
accord
with
the
recent
literature
highlighting a broader function of the amygdala, including
processing of valence, emotion and value, we believe that
our findings would generalize to other stimuli with social or
survival significance39.
Methods
Participants. Data were obtained from nine patients (four female, five male, age
24–58, Supplementary Table 1) who had stereotactically implanted intracranial
depth electrodes (Integra or Ad-Tech, 5 mm inter-electrode spacing) placed at the
University of California, Irvine, Medical Center to localize the seizure onset zone
for possible surgical resection. The institutional review boards of University of
California at Berkeley and at Irvine approved the research, and written informed
consent was obtained from each subject before testing. Electrode placement was
exclusively guided by clinical needs, and patient selection was solely based on
MRI confirmed depth electrode placement in the amygdala and hippocampus.
Recordings were conducted from four patients (subjects 1–4) with depth electrodes
localized ipsilateral and five patients (subjects 5–9) contralateral to or outside of
seizure onset zone. There were no seizures recorded in any of the epochs, and
any epochs with interictal epileptiform activity were removed from analysis.
Comparable high gamma, PLV and PAC results were observed in all nine subjects,
and there were no differences in the magnitude of effects between recordings from
electrodes ipsilateral and contralateral to the seizure focus.
Depth electrode localization. MRI scans. Electrodes were localized in each
participant using co-registered pre-implantation and post-implantation structural
T1-weighted MRI scans. The pre-implantation scans were all 1 mm isotropic.
The post-implantation scans were either 1 mm isotropic (subjects 1, 5, 6, 8 and 9)
or 0.75 � 0.75 � 7 mm (subjects 2–4 and 7). For each participant, the
post-implantation scan was registered to the pre-implantation scan using
a six-parameter rigid body transformation (three rotations and three translations
in x–z directions), implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools
(ANTs http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/)40.
Anatomical masking. For determining exact electrode locations, we used
a high-resolution anatomical template (0.55 mm) developed in our laboratory with
manual tracings of hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei. This template has
been used in past studies41–43. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the medial temporal
lobe included the DG/CA3, CA1, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex,
parahippocampal cortex, BLA, central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and the
cortical nuclei of the amygdala (CORT)44,45. Segmentations for hippocampal
subfields followed our previously published protocols46. Briefly, the segmentation
included DG/CA3, CA1 and subiculum, and procedures followed closely the atlas
of Duvernoy44, in which the subfields are defined along the anterior-posterior axis
of the hippocampus. Amygdala segmentation procedures were based on
Entis et al.45, but were modified to define three regions: BLA, CeA and CORT. To
label these sub-regions of the amygdala, three key points were identified: (1) the
medial tip of the alveus (up to the optic tract); (2) the most lateral point of the
entorhinal sulcus; and (3) bottom of the circular sulcus. These three points are
easily observable and provide a reliable landmarking system for segmenting the
amygdala sub-regions. After identifying these points, lines were drawn to connect
the three points to each other, creating four quadrants (basomedial and basolateral
were combined to form the basolateral complex).
Labelling individual participant scans. The labelled high-resolution anatomical
template (resampled to 1 mm isotropic) was aligned to each individual’s
pre-implantation scan using ANTs Symmetric Normalization40, such that the
labels could be applied to each participant’s MRI. This allowed for visualization and
accurate identification of electrode locations using anatomical labels in each
participant’s space. Each electrode location was determined by selecting the centre
of the electrode artefact and identifying the region of interest that encompassed the
centre. Cases where electrodes were on the border between ROI’s or between grey
matter and white matter were noted as such.
Behavioural task. Participants watched silent movie clips on a laptop computer
placed on the service tray at a comfortable distance in front of them. The total
length of the task was about 7 min, consisting of alternating 9 blocks of landscapes
and eight blocks of fearful faces (B24 s/block, see Fig. 1a). During the experiment,
participants viewed 70 landscapes and 71 fearful face clips (clip duration:

 2.8±1.3 s; mean±s.d.). Within each block, movie clips were shown continuously
without breaks. This paradigm was used in previous fMRI studies and demon-
strated reliable amygdala activation47,48.
Data collection and preprocessing. Intracranial EEG data were acquired using
a Nihon Kohden recording system (256 channel amplifier, model JE120A),
analogue-filtered above 0.01 Hz and digitally sampled at 5,000 Hz. All the data were
analysed in MATLAB combined with open source toolboxes and custom scripts.
After acquisition, neuronal recordings were band-pass filtered from 0.1 to 350 Hz
using a zero phase delay finite impulse response (FIR) filter with Hamming
window and then down-sampled to 2,000 Hz for subsequent analyses. A regression
method49 was used to filter 60 Hz noise and its harmonics. All hippocampal and
amygdala electrodes were re-referenced to the nearest electrode located in white
matter. A neurologist with subspecialty training in epilepsy (J.J.L.) manually
inspected all EEG signals to identify and remove all data with interictal
epileptiform discharges as well as excessive noise, including broadband
electromagnetic noise from hospital equipment. To avoid potentially biasing
the results, the neurologist was blinded to the location and behavioural task
(for example, aversive versus neutral condition) associated with EEG signals and
the artefact rejection was performed before additional data processing.
Electro-oculogram and perisaccadic high gamma activity. To investigate the
possibility of eye-movement-related contamination of our results, one subject
(S9) was recorded along with a free head fixation eye tracker (SensoMotoric
Instruments, Inc. RED 250 mobile) and EOG recordings. The eye tracker,
connected to the laptop with Universal Serial Bus (USB), was placed at the inner
edge of the presentation laptop. Before the task, the eye tracker was calibrated using
the iView RED-m software. Timing between the eye tracker recording and the
video clips was synchronized through an E-Prime script. After averaging the
velocity of the eyes in the X and Y dimensions from the eye tracker data across
clips, two-sample t-tests were performed for each data point to test for significant
differences in patterns of eye movements between conditions that could affect the
results. In addition to the eye movement analysis, we estimated the time course of
high gamma activity (HG) in the vertical and horizontal EOG. Again, two-sample
t-tests were performed for each data point to test for significant differences between
conditions. As a third test to investigate the contribution of ocular activity to our
findings, we used ICA (Bell-Sejnowski ICA algorithm)28, implemented in the
EEGLAB toolbox for Matlab on the EOG combined with white matter re-
referenced amygdala and hippocampal activity to compute the weights of
contributions from each channel of data to each independent component. Any
components composed of mostly EOG activity were removed from the data by
zeroing those components and re-projecting the remaining components into the
channel space. All analyses were then re-run with this ‘corrected’ data.
Saccades were detected through a velocity-based algorithm6. The velocity of eye
movement was estimated as the first derivative of the Euclidean distance between
eye positions at successive sample points. A threshold was set at the 99th percentile
of velocities and saccades were marked at the time points of the peak velocities that
surpassed this threshold, with a minimum spacing of 200 milliseconds between
saccade events. High gamma (70–180 Hz) activity in hippocampal and amygdala
contacts was then epoched based on these events. After baseline correction
( � 200 ms to 0 ms), two-sample t-tests were performed for each data point to
determine significant differences between conditions. To further investigate the
possibility that PAC analyses could have been influenced by EOG activity, we
calculated the PAC using the gamma-range component of the EOG signal and
low-frequency phase from the hippocampus and amygdala (the same analysis
as described in the Methods ‘Phase-amplitude coupling’ section). We observed
no significant PAC pattern between the amygdala or hippocampus and the
EOG HG signal, which indicates that there was no appreciable influence from
potential eye movement artifacts on the PAC analysis.
Power spectral density (PSD) and subject-specific low-frequency band.
PSD was estimated using Welch’s method50 (pwelch.m in Signal Processing
Toolbox from MATLAB) wherein the PSD was estimated for each subject
separately using 1 s time windows with a 50% overlap. The slope of the power
spectrum was estimated using the linear regression approach in a semi-log space,
where the power P at each discrete frequency f was estimated from the frequency
itself using the following formula:
Pf ¼ f 0b þ e
ð1Þ
where f 0 is a two column matrix composed of the discrete frequency bands of
interest and a column of ones; b is the regression coefficient (the slope of the
model), and e is the error term. In intracranial power spectra, b is typically
negative, which is important given that task-related increases in neural activity
result in a broadband upward shift within the high gamma range51. To characterize
spectral dependence between the amygdala and hippocampus in a narrow band,
we selected the subject-specific low-frequency band based on the PSD plots.
Specifically, the value of exponent w in the power-law relation P �
1
f w was obtained
by fitting a straight line to the experimentally measured PSD. Then the distances
between the PSD and the fitting curve were calculated at each frequency point. The
subject-specific band was defined as the farthest points from the fitting curve
within the low-frequency range with a bandwidth of 4 Hz.
Frequency decomposition. Data from the amygdala and hippocampus were
first filtered into subject-specific low-frequency bands (Amygdala:
xAmyy ¼ 6.0±0.49 Hz; hippocampus: xHippy ¼ 6.5±0.16 Hz; mean±s.e.m.) and
high gamma (xg, 70–180 Hz) using a two-way, zero-phase lag, least-squares
FIR filter to prevent phase distortion (eegfilt.m function in EEGLAB toolbox52).
The length of the filter in points was determined by the specific frequency, cycle
number (usually 4–5 cycles) and sampling rate. The centre frequency of each
frequency bin is spaced apart by 0.1 of the lower-frequency band and the
bandwidth varied by multiplying the fractional bandwidth index 0.3 with the centre
frequency. For example, for the frequency bin centred at 10 Hz, the next frequency
bin is 10 � 0.1 þ 10 ¼ 11 Hz and the bandwidth is 10 � 0.3 � 2 ¼ 6 Hz. Since
we choose adaptive rather than fixed bandwidths, the bandwidths within
low-frequency range were sufficiently narrow to define a meaningful phase while
the bandwidths within higher-frequency range were broad enough to fit the
sidebands caused by the assumed modulating lower-frequency band27. We then
applied the Hilbert transform (hilbert.m function in Signal Processing Toolbox
from MATLAB) to estimate the amplitude (ax[n]) and phase (yx[n]) for both
bands, which yields a complex time series:
Sx n
½ � ¼ ax n
½ �eifx n
½ �
ð2Þ
where ax[n] represents the instantaneous analytic amplitude and fx[n] is the
instantaneous phase.
Event-related potentials. The ERPs were calculated individually for both the
amygdala and hippocampus separately. The LFP signals were first low-pass
filtered at 30 Hz using the same filter parameters as described in Methods
(‘Frequency decomposition’ section). Then the filtered signals were segmented
into epochs, and the ERPs were calculated by averaging across these epochs within
each condition. After baseline correction by subtracting the mean baseline
( � 500 ms to 0 ms) value from all data points, two-sample t-tests were performed
for each data point to determine significant differences between conditions.
High gamma activity. To investigate the time course of HG activity within the
amygdala and hippocampus, we extracted the high-frequency banded signal
using the frequency decomposition and averaged the results within each region.
Specifically, the HG amplitude data were divided into epochs from � 0.5 to 1.5 s
from the start of each movie clip. Data within each trial were normalized by con-
verting each data point into a z-score relative to the entire trial time-series.
The computed z-scores were then baseline corrected by subtracting an average of pre-
stimulus baseline data points (a 500 ms time period taken from the beginning of the
session, when the blank screen was presented, see Fig. 1a). This allows us to eliminate
the positive skew typically observed for HG amplitude values53. We then statistically
compared the event-related HG amplitude changes between the landscape and the
fearful face conditions using a cluster-based permutation test, computing statistics at
the cluster level and correcting for multiple comparisons54. First, all the trials from
the two experimental conditions were randomly shuffled, and the means of each
condition were subtracted 1,000 times to create a null distribution of differences
between conditions. T-scores were then computed for each null difference time series
by comparing it to the entire distribution of null difference time series at every time
point. Then, all t-scores corresponding to uncorrected P values of 0.05 or less were
formed into clusters with any neighbouring such t-scores. The sum of the t-scores in
each cluster is the ‘mass’ of that cluster and the most extreme cluster mass in each of
the 1,000 sets of tests was recorded and used to estimate the distribution of the null
hypothesis. Finally, clusters were obtained from the true data, and the percentage of
null cluster masses greater than each true data cluster mass was taken as the corrected
P value for that cluster. Onsets and offsets of the HG activity for each condition were
computed by taking the first and last time sample that passed a significance level of
Po0.05. Time-to-peak was defined for fearful face and landscape conditions as the
latency of the maximum amplitude in the HG range across all trials within each
condition during the range of time where a significant difference between the two
conditions was found.
Phase locking value (PLV). To quantify the inter-electrode low-frequency phase
coupling, phase differences were calculated for each electrode pair (i, j) using the
phase time series fx[n] obtained from equation (2). The frequency range covers the
low-frequency peaks from both the amygdala and hippocampus (identified in PSD)
with a bandwidth of 4 Hz. The phase difference between the two time courses
fyij[n] indexes the coherence between each electrode pair and is expressed as
the PLV index (equation (3)). PLVs range between 0 and 1, with values
approaching 1 if the phase differences between the electrodes vary little across time.

 condition. Relative increases (or decreases) in PLV in response to fearful faces
versus landscape scenes were assessed by subtracting the two PLVs for each
electrode pair. To test the significance of differences between two conditions and,
at the same time, maximally eliminate the influence of ERPs, we did a two-step
approach as described below. We first permuted trials and computed the
99th percentile threshold within each condition. Only the electrode pairs whose
PLVs rose above the threshold for both conditions were selected for calculating the
PLV difference. Then the statistical significance for each electrode pair was
estimated using a cluster-based permutation test, in which a null distribution was
created by randomly assigning trials (i.e., one-second windows) into two
conditions, computing the relative PLV differences between conditions, and
repeating this procedure 1,000 times. The observed data were then compared with
this null distribution to estimate a P value. The results were depicted as hive
plots to visualize the magnitude of the PLV and the associated P values among
pairs of electrodes55.
To test the regional specificity of this phase coupling effect, an analysis of
variance with pairwise comparisons was conducted to test differences between
hippocampal sub-regions using the R statistic toolbox. First, the
Shapiro–Wilk test (function Shapiro.test) was conducted to test whether the data
were approximately normally distributed. Second, the homogeneity of variances
was tested using Bartlett’s test (function Bartlett.test). Then the pairwise
comparison was computed using the function pairwise t-test. In addition, to further
address the continuous consistency of the phase relationship between the amygdala
and hippocampus, the PLV spectra were created as a function of frequency
(1–30 Hz) for all BLA and hippocampal electrode pairs averaged across all subjects
for each condition and the difference was calculated by subtracting neutral from
aversive condition and z-score normalized. A fifth-order spline interpolation was
implemented (spapi.m in Curve fitting toolbox from MATLAB) to smooth the
curve of PLV difference spectra.
Phase-amplitude coupling. On the basis of the previous phase coupling analysis,
we analysed the PAC between BLA and hippocampus electrode pairs that
exhibited the most significant PLV in each patient. To extract the directionality
information from these electrode pairs, the relationship between lower-frequency
(1–30 Hz; delta, theta, alpha, beta) phase from electrode i and higher-frequency
(30–250 Hz; gamma) amplitude from electrode j was examined individually for
each condition by calculating the circular linear correlation between the instan-
taneous phase of low-frequency and the instantaneous phase of high frequency56.

equals to the instantaneous phase from the modulating signal, and a[n] equals to
the instantaneous analytic amplitude from the modulated signal. To compare the
significance of the difference between correlation coefficients r1 and r2, we applied
Fisher’s z-transform to normalize correlation coefficients such that

, and calculated the difference Drz ¼ z(r1) � z(r2) (ref. 57). The
permutation test described for the previous analyses was also used here to create
a null distribution of PAC differences between two conditions for each
electrode pair. Then the z-PAC was defined as the z-score of the real difference in
PAC between the two conditions based on the distribution of phase-amplitude
coupling values obtained from these null distributions with the positive value
indicating PAC increase in the aversive condition versus neutral condition.
Phase-amplitude coupling with time lag. As the communication between the
modulating and modulated signal builds, the carrier oscillation is likely to
appear first in the modulating signal. In other words, immediately preceding the
synchronization between two signals, the ‘driver’ signals should be predictive of the
‘receiver’ signal. To probe the direction of functional coupling and to further
explore how the neuronal dynamics in low-frequency and gamma bands interact,
we examined the PAC magnitude as a function of the time lag between modulating
and modulated signals. A diagram of the data processing steps is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 12. The cross-regional PAC was calculated using the same
algorithm as outlined in the PAC analysis section but with different time lags
(in 10 ms intervals for the total duration range of ±200 ms) by shifting one signal
relative to the other one.
Power spectral density (PSD) of the high gamma envelope. The goal of this
step was to identify rhythmic fluctuations present in the higher-frequency power
time series. We tested the assumption that if the power time series within the
higher-frequency band are synchronized with a lower-frequency oscillation, the
power time series will not be constant over time but instead will fluctuate at the
specific lower oscillation frequency58. For example, if a signal banded at 80 Hz is
synchronized with a 6 Hz oscillation, the power time series of the 80 Hz might
itself oscillate at 6 Hz. To test this hypothesis, we first selected the subject-specific
high-frequency band centred at the frequency with the strongest PAC and
bandwidth of 40 Hz. Then, the PSDs of the selected high-frequency bands were
calculated using the same methods as described in Methods (‘Power spectral
density and subject-specific low-frequency band’ section).
Theta-trough locked averaging of time–frequency plot. A theta-trough locked
time–frequency averaging plot for a single subject was created to demonstrate the
oscillatory features of the underlying signal5. To create the tracing in the lower
panels of Supplementary Fig. 9, the raw signal from the amygdala/hippocampus
was first filtered within subject-specific low-frequency band (5.8–9.8 Hz for this
subject) using the same FIR filter parameters as described in the Methods
(‘Frequency decomposition’ section). By applying the Hilbert transform, the
phase at each time point was extracted from the filtered data within ( � p, p], where
p radians corresponded to a theta trough and 0 radians corresponded to a theta
peak (cosine phase). Then, the signal was segmented into 1 s epochs centred at the
theta troughs, which were identified as the local minima of the phase less than
( � p þ 0.01) and the theta-trough locked ERP were generated by averaging across
all epochs. For Supplementary Fig. 9 upper panel, a set of normalized instantaneous
power time series from the hippocampus/amygdala was constructed, with centre
frequencies ranging from 1 to 250 Hz. To facilitate comparisons between different
frequency bands, the band-pass filtered signals within the specific frequency range
were first normalized by subtracting the temporal mean and dividing by the
temporal s.d. The normalized instantaneous power time series were generated by
applying the Hilbert transform and taking the square of the extracted amplitude
time series. These power series were then segmented into the epochs centred on the
corresponding theta trough (Supplementary Fig. 9 lower panel), P values for each
time point in each frequency band were calculated using the non-parametric
permutation test described in Methods (‘High gamma activity’ section).
Phase slope index (PSI). As an index of dominant unidirectional interaction30,
PSI indicates the direction of coupling between two systems. Given a pre-specified
bandwidth parameter, it reflects the change of phase difference between
neighbouring frequency bins, weighted with the magnitude of the coherence. On
the basis of the assumption that independent sources do not contribute to the
imaginary part of the cross-spectrum, the PSI is defined as

j ðf ; nÞ is the cross-spectrum between two time series, n is the centre frequency of
the targeted frequency range, and Im denotes the imaginary part. We use b as the
bandwidth for which the phase slope is calculated and choose it to be eight times of
the frequency resolution df29. For example, when calculating directionality for
a phase modulation centred at 8 Hz rhythm with a 1 Hz frequency resolution,
a phase slope estimated between 4 and 12 Hz is reasonable (b ¼ 4 Hz). To
understand interaction and directionality between the signals involved in cross
frequency coupling, we segmented the phase of the modulating signal and the
power envelope of the modulated signal into N epochs and used them as inputs to
calculate the PSI for both aversive and neutral conditions. As the interactions
between modulating and modulated signals require certain amount of time, and if
the speed at which these waves travel is similar, the sign of the PSI informs about
which signal is temporally leading the other one. In other words, when the phase
differences between the ‘sender’ and ‘recipient’ signal increase with the
corresponding frequencies, a positive slope of the phase spectrum is expected. By
performing the PSI analysis with a sliding window of 100 ms, spaced at 25 ms (75%
overlap), we were able to track the switching of the directionality between two
signals at each time point. To assess the statistical significance of PSI, we applied
the analogous non-parametric approach as describe above by randomly shuffling
the trials within a condition. Then the PSI null distribution was created at each
time point, and the 99.5th percentile threshold was defined for each condition
separately.
Granger causality. To further investigate interactions between brain regions, we
computed spectral Granger causality. Granger causality represents how much
introducing past measurements from a first time series can decrease the variance of
the prediction error for a second time series at the current time point. Spectral
Granger causality extends this analysis to the frequency domain59,60. The
time-domain data was first low-pass filtered at 85 Hz and then down-sampled to
250 Hz before fitting to an autoregressive model and computing spectral
Granger causality. The model order m was determined by the Akaike information
criterion61 (using the Multivariate Granger Causality (MGVC) Matlab Toolbox),
which is a tradeoff between sufficient spectral resolution and over-
parameterization. Model orders were estimated for each patient and varied
from 7 to 13. The Granger index was computed using the first 1,500 ms from each
clip as trial realizations. To further address whether this directionality was task
specific, the null hypothesis distributions of spectral Granger causality for each
condition were created by randomly swapping clip segments between channels.
The spectral Granger causality was considered significant if they exceeded
the 99% confidence interval of this null hypothesis distribution. To further test

 whether the Granger causality is significantly different between conditions, the
null difference time series were computed by subtracting the Granger time series
from the aversive condition and the ones from the neutral condition, which were
calculated by randomly flipping the segments between conditions. Then for
each frequency point, there were two Granger values as the upper or lower range of
the 99% confidence interval, where 98% of the null Granger difference time series
were either less or greater than these values. It shows a greater Granger for the
aversive condition compared with the neutral one if the real difference line is above
the upper confidence interval while the neutral condition has a stronger Granger if
the real difference line is below the lower confidence interval.
