Introduction
The use of spacing chambers is now firmly estab-
lished within the therapeutic paradigm. Spacers 
and valved holding chambers (VHCs; which 
include a one-way inhalation valve) allow decelera-
tion of the aerosol plume and, in the case of VHCs, 
trap the aerosol cloud until the patient inhales. 
This reduces oropharyngeal drug deposition by 
approximately 80–90% via retention of large aero-
sol particles within the holding chamber1–3 and for 
VHCs substantially lessens the requirement for 
coordination between pMDI actuation and inhala-
tion,4 which is problematic in approximately one-
third of subjects using a pMDI.5,6 As a result, 
VHCs may increase pulmonary drug deposition7–9 
and in comparison to pMDIs used alone, pMDI/
VHC combinations have been shown to improve 
airway hyperresponsiveness,10 lung function11–14 
and asthma control,15 afford greater withdrawal of 
oral corticosteroids,16 and reduce the local16 and 
systemic side effects17–19 of inhaled corticosteroids. 
Accordingly, virtually all national and international 
obstructive lung disease guidelines now advocate 
the use of spacers/VHCs in patient subgroups 
prone to pMDI handling errors,20–28 with spacer 
usage also specifically stipulated for inhaled corti-
costeroid administration within key national guid-
ance documents.21,24,25,28
While the potential benefits of VHCs are clear, 
there is less consensus as to whether meaningful 
differences exist between different devices. Thus, 
while the Global Initiative for Asthma notes that 
performance differences may exist between dif-
ferent spacers,26 sentiments echoed within the 
EU Orally Inhaled Product guideline,29 similar

Abstract: Valved holding chambers (VHCs) reduce the need for inhalation-actuation 
coordination with pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), reduce oropharyngeal drug 
deposition and may improve lung deposition and clinical outcomes compared to pMDIs used 
alone. While VHCs are thus widely advocated for use in vulnerable patient groups within 
clinical and regulatory guidelines, there is less consensus as to whether the performance 
differences between different VHCs have clinical implications. This review evaluates the 
VHC literature, in particular the data pertaining to large- versus small-volume chambers, 
aerosol performance with a VHC adjunct versus a pMDI alone, charge dissipative/conducting 
versus non-conducting VHCs, and facemasks, to ascertain whether potentially meaningful 
differences between VHCs exist. Inconsistencies in the literature are examined and explained, 
and relationships between in vitro and in vivo data are discussed. A particular focus of this 
review is the AeroChamber Plus® Flow-Vu® Anti-static VHC, the most recent iteration of the 
AeroChamber VHC family.

statements are lacking in other clinical or regula-
tory authority guidance documents. This dis-
cordance may reflect the multitude of different 
VHCs that are currently marketed, many of 
which superficially resemble one another, allied 
to a large body of (principally in vitro) data, some 
of which are seemingly in conflict.
Aims
The purpose of this review was to examine the 
available data regarding the AeroChamber Plus® 
Flow-Vu® anti-static VHC (AC+FV aVHC) in 
the context of the related VHC literature. The 
AC+FV aVHC is the most recent iteration of the 
widely available AeroChamber Plus range of 
VHCs which are currently the most employed 
VHCs globally. The review focuses on specific 
facets of VHC design and performance with the 
potential to impart meaningful differences 
between VHCs in vivo. Where the literature was 
seemingly in conflict we sought to understand 
why this might be. Note that although the terms 
‘spacer’ and ‘valved holding chamber’ are fre-
quently used interchangeably, a simple spacing 
device that lacks a one-way valve is susceptible to 
dispersal of the aerosol within due to uncoordi-
nated exhalation into the chamber. Thus, VHCs 
are preferred and will be the focus of this review.
Background
The AeroChamber Plus VHC was first introduced 
in 1983. Since that time there have been several 
modifications to the VHC intended to improve 
product performance and/or usability. These 
include the introduction of: a range of patient-/
age-specific facemask VHC products; an ‘inspira-
tory flow indicator’, or Flow-Vu, moving in accord 
with inspiration and expiration in the presence of 
an adequate mouth or facemask seal; an alert 
whistle intended to indicate the attainment of 
excessive inspiratory flow rates (limited to adult 
versions of the device); and most recently in 2009 
a charge dissipative version (the primary focus of 
the present review) of the same dimensions and 
comprising the same polymer as the parent VHC 
but with the addition of an anti-static resin.
Further to the various device iterations detailed 
above, two AeroChamber variants are currently 
available: the non-conducting AeroChamber Plus 
VHC (AC+ VHC) and the charge dissipative 
AeroChamber Plus Flow-Vu anti-static VHC 
(AC+FV aVHC) (Figure 1; facemask versions 
shown). A considerably greater body of data is 
available for the non-conducting VHC, given its 
earlier inception. Importantly, however, when 
interpreting the published data, the performance of 
these two AeroChamber Plus devices is essentially 
the same in vitro – where the non-conducting vari-
ant is pre-treated per the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (i.e. washed in a warm detergent solution and 
then air-dried) and where the anti-static version has 
had no such pre-treatment (the anti-static resin 
precludes the need for the patient to perform this 
step). Under such conditions total emitted mass 
and fine particle dose (FPD) from eight commonly 
used pMDIs was essentially the same for the AC+ 
VHC and AC+FV aVHC.30 These data also imply 
that the inspiratory flow indicator incorporated 
within the AC+FV aVHC design has no effect 
upon the aerosol pathway within the VHC.
Methods
The PubMed database was searched for the term 
‘valved holding chamber’ in conjunction with any 
of the following: ‘volume’, ‘static’, ‘delay’, ‘mask’, 
‘facemask’, ‘seal’, ‘asthma’ and ‘COPD’. These 
terms were selected on the basis of their known rel-
evance to VHC performance and, with respect to 
the disease terms, the intended focus of this manu-
script upon obstructive lung disease. The search

was limited to comparative studies with particular 
attention paid to studies that included the 
AeroChamber Plus VHC in any of its iterations.
Abstracts of all relevant papers identified during 
this search were reviewed, and any papers of 
potential interest were reviewed in full. Citations 
of particular relevance within these initial papers 
were also identified and subsequently reviewed. 
Note that this review was not intended to exhaus-
tively detail every available study in the field, but 
rather to critically appraise the key publications 
and distil learning points detailed therein.
Results
Spacer volume
There has been much debate as to ideal VHC 
dimensions, although in more recent years atten-
tion has switched to other facets of VHC design.
In an in vitro study of seven different spacing 
chambers, washed in water alone, differences in 
drug delivery between devices were highly 
dependent upon the formulation in question. 
Thus there was a marked difference in sodium 
cromoglycate FPD delivered via the AC+ VHC 
(145 ml) compared to the Nebuhaler® (750 ml), 
in favour of the latter, whereas no difference 
between these VHCs in terms of budesonide FPD 
was evident. Nonetheless, overall the larger vol-
ume spacing chambers in this in vitro study (the 
Fisonair, Nebuhaler, Volumatic® and Inspirease) 
performed better than their smaller volume coun-
terparts [the AC+ VHC, Aerosol Cloud Enhancer 
(ACE®) and Dynahaler®].31 Somewhat similar 
results were reported in a pharmacokinetic study 
of a salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) formu-
lation in which spacers were again washed in 
water alone: pulmonary salbutamol delivery via 
the Nebuhaler (750 ml) exceeded that via the 
AC+ VHC by 63%, although no difference was 
noted between the Volumatic (750 ml) and AC+ 
VHC.32 An earlier scintigraphic comparison also 
supported the notion of greater drug delivery 
from large-volume VHCs versus the AC+ VHC,33 
while a further in vitro study showed somewhat 
greater salbutamol small particle output (<6.8 µm) 
with a large-volume Nebuhaler than with three 
smaller non-conducting VHCs when all devices 
were detergent-washed.34
Other studies have yielded results in contrast 
with the above. Two in vitro studies reported 
equivalent FPD outputs via detergent-washed 
Volumatic and AC+ VHCs for an HFA flutica-
sone pMDI35 and both components of an HFA 
fluticasone/salmeterol 
formulation.36 
Similar 
pulmonary delivery of these same formulations 
via the Volumatic or AC+ VHC was also sug-
gested by a series of adrenal axis studies where 
VHCs were pre-washed with detergent and/or 
effectively primed via the administration of mul-
tiple drug actuations.37–41 In a further pharmaco-
dynamic study, the short-term growth suppressive 
effect of HFA beclometasone (reflective primar-
ily of pulmonary beclomethasone delivery) was 
similar whether delivered via an AC+ VHC or 
Volumatic,42 again where both VHCs were deter-
gent-washed (personal communication, Ole 
Wolthers).
Interpretation of these sometimes conflicting 
data is hampered by a lack of detail in earlier 
studies as to whether CFC or HFA formulations 
were employed, although the absence of such 
detail likely implies the former. Nonetheless, 
and while the active substance in question and 
factors such as airflow recirculation and valve 
design may also be relevant,43 it would appear 
that performance differences between large- and 
small-volume VHCs are less evident with HFA 
versus CFC formulations, as has been demon-
strated for salbutamol formulations,44,45 and 
where non-conducting spacers are afforded an 
anti-static coating. These observations would 
appear intuitive. A slower (and/or narrower) 
HFA aerosol plume is liable to be more forgiving 
of a shorter chamber or narrower chamber diam-
eter, while an anti-static coating would also be 
expected to mitigate the effects of smaller cham-
ber dimensions.
Currently there are no data which compare the 
effect of the AC+FV aVHC versus that of a large-
volume VHC upon a particular formulation. 
However, based on the preceding discussion, it 
would be anticipated that the delivery of contem-
porary aerosols via the AC+FV aVHC would be 
broadly similar to that via a large-volume cham-
ber. This is further suggested via the comparison 
of two different HFA fluticasone-containing 
 
formulations (fluticasone monotherapy and fluti-
casone/formoterol) with similar in vitro character-
istics, in a recent pharmacodynamic study. With 
the monotherapy administered via the Volumatic 
and the combination via the AC+FV aVHC, vir-
tually identical effects upon lower leg growth rate 
were observed.46

Performance in comparison to the pMDI
A key clinical consideration when choosing a 
pMDI/VHC combination is the likely impact of 
the VHC upon pulmonary drug delivery, it being 
virtually assured that the oropharyngeal dose will 
be substantially attenuated irrespective of VHC 
selection via removal of the ballistic aerosol frac-
tion.3,7,47 Importantly, a VHC should not materi-
ally reduce pulmonary drug delivery in comparison 
to a pMDI alone. Despite this, some studies have 
demonstrated potentially important reductions in 
the respirable drug dose with certain VHCs. For 
example, the FPD of an salbutamol pMDI was 
shown to be reduced by 36% via a puff-primed 
ACE VHC, but was essentially unchanged for the 
three other VHCs tested.48 In another study the 
FPD of a fluticasone/formoterol pMDI was sub-
stantially reduced when delivered via a metal 
Vortex® VHC.49 Conversely, in vitro44 and in 
vivo50 studies have demonstrated that the 
Nebuhaler VHC may result in a lung dose 2–3 
times that via a pMDI alone.
Turning to the AC+FV aVHC, in vitro data dem-
onstrate that the FPD delivered via this VHC is 
comparable to that delivered via the pMDI alone, 
albeit the exact relationship with/without the 
VHC depends upon the formulation in question. 
The FPD ratio for eight HFA formulations (com-
prising 10 active substances) delivered via the 
AC+FV aVHC versus the pMDI alone ranged 
from approximately 120% to 160% where there 
was no delay between actuation and sampling.30 
Similar results were reported in other studies of 
salbutamol 
and 
beclomethasone/formoterol 
pMDIs.51,52 Importantly, where a 2 s delay in 
sampling was imposed for the AC+FV aVHC, 
simulating use by a more representative semi-
coordinated patient, the FPD remained similar to 
that via a pMDI coordinated perfectly (FPD ratio 
approximately 85–120%).30
Comparable results to the above have also been 
reported for the older AC+ VHC where pre-
washed in detergent solution and air-dried (per-
sonal 
communication, 
Geraldine 
Venthoye).30,36,49 
Further, other than the removal of the coarse par-
ticle fraction that would otherwise be deposited in 
the oropharynx, aerosol particle size distribution 
is essentially unchanged with delivery via the 
AC+ VHC or pMDI alone,36,49,51 implying simi-
lar regional pulmonary deposition will ensue. The 
latter is an important observation since there has 
been much focus upon optimal aerosol particle 
size, which may differ according to the therapeu-
tic class of the inhaled drug53–57 and is also rele-
vant to deposition efficiency (i.e. the proportion 
of inhaled particles which successfully deposit in 
the lung rather than impacting in the oropharynx 
or being exhaled prior to sedimentation).58,59 
While competing hypotheses as to optimal parti-
cle size exist,60,61 it is important that prescribers 
selecting a given pMDI, based at least in part on 
its particle size character can anticipate similar 
performance in conjunction with a VHC.
Taken together, the in vitro data above imply 
that equivalent clinical deposition/effects would 
be seen with a pMDI used optimally or in con-
junction with the AC+FV aVHC/detergent-
washed AC+ VHC. Accordingly, comparable 
pulmonary deposition via a pMDI with and 
without the AC+ VHC spacer has been demon-
strated 
in 
three 
scintigraphic 
studies.1,2,47 
Interestingly, in none of these studies was pre-
washing of the AC+ VHC reported, hence lung 
deposition with the AC+ VHC may have been 
less than maximal. Similar drug delivery with 
and without the AC+ VHC has also been 
reported in pharmacokinetic studies, another 
tightly controlled setting.62,63 However, in 
patients where pMDI technique is poor and in 
whom disease control is accordingly less likely to 
be adequate,64,65 clinical outcomes would be 
expected to improve where an AC+ VHC is 
employed, since in such patients the lung dose is 
markedly increased with AC+ VHC use.66 This 
is likely to explain the significant reduction in 
oral corticosteroid usage reported by Salzman 
and Pyszczynski in oral prednisolone-dependent 
patients receiving beclomethasone via an AC+ 
VHC compared to a pMDI alone.16 These 
patients by their nature were likely to include a 
large proportion with imperfect inhaler tech-
nique. More surprisingly, perhaps, given the 
highly controlled nature of the study involved, 
mild to moderate asthmatics receiving supra-
therapeutic single doses of fluticasone via a pre-
washed AC+ VHC or a pMDI alone exhibited 
substantially greater adrenal axis suppression in 
the AC+ VHC arm, reflective of higher pulmo-
nary drug delivery.40 Although this difference 
may have been exaggerated by the pMDI group 
sitting on the cusp of a steep dose–response 
curve, it does nonetheless illustrate the potential 
for in vitro–in vivo discordance most plausibly 
explained by suboptimal clinical handling of the 
pMDI.

In summary, therefore, while the in vitro data indi-
cate that the AC+FV aVHC and pre-washed 
AC+ VHC perform comparably to the pMDI 
alone, a direct in vivo translation of these data is 
most realistic in patients with optimal inhaler 
technique. In patients whose pMDI technique is 
less ideal, increased pulmonary deposition via the 
use of these VHCs would be anticipated. However, 
this increased exposure corresponds only to that 
anticipated in patients with good pMDI handling 
capability. As such, no amendment to doses rec-
ommended via pMDIs are required for the 
AC+FV aVHC, although individualized dose 
titration dependent upon treatment response 
should be employed as usual. Importantly, 
regional pulmonary deposition would be expected 
to be unchanged with the AC+FV aVHC.
Charge dissipative/electrical conducting 
spacers
A substantial proportion of the ‘respirable dose’ 
of an aerosol will potentially be lost within a non-
conducting VHC (made, for example, from poly-
carbonate or polyester) as a result of electrostatic 
interactions between aerosol particles and the 
VHC’s internal walls. This is a result of charge 
acquisition by the VHC during manufacture, 
storage and packaging, and as a result of triboe-
lectrification (frictional charging) of aerosol for-
mulations during their passage out of the canister 
via a metering valve.67
Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have demon-
strated that drug delivery from non-conducting 
VHCs is typically improved by pre-washing in a 
detergent solution and air-drying, or via other 
means of anti-static coating.68–73 Of note, how-
ever, the relative effects of detergent coating may 
differ for different non-conducting VHCs34,74,75 
and for different active substances/formulations.76 
Thus, for example, with a 2 
s testing delay, the 
FPD emitted via a detergent-washed Pocket 
Chamber® was decreased to half that via an 
unwashed Pocket Chamber; whereas in the same 
study detergent washing increased the FPD out-
put for another non-conducting VHC, the 
ProChamber®, 
approximately 
twofold.74 
In 
another study, detergent washing of a Babyhaler 
had varying effects upon FPD output dependent 
upon the active substance and product strength.76 
Furthermore, the efficiency of priming via multi-
ple inhaler actuations has been reported to differ 
for the same formulation/non-conducting VHC 
combination across different studies.75,77 Lastly, 
even where a detergent coating can provide a 
highly effective anti-static coating for a given 
VHC, patient behaviours may mitigate against 
this. Approximately 50–60% of patients are 
reported to wash their VHCs in water (some 
doing so after each use), while 25–70% towel-dry 
their VHCs post-washing.69,78 Wildhaber and col-
leagues even noted that one-quarter of patients 
kept their spacers wrapped in plastic bags.69
Two approaches have been employed to circum-
vent such inconsistencies and behaviours: the use 
of electrical conducting metal chambers, such as 
the Nebuchamber or Vortex; or alternatively that 
of charge dissipative plastic spacers such as the 
AC+FV aVHC or OptiChamber® Diamond. The 
advantage of the latter is that they allow visualiza-
tion of the aerosol plume through the VHC.
Aerosol half-life within the metal Nebuchamber 
substantially exceeds that of unconditioned non-
conducting VHCs (including the AC+ VHC) 
and, in contrast to non-conducting chambers, 
remains unchanged when the Nebuchamber is 
washed or primed with repeated aerosol actua-
tions.71,75,77 Given its anti-static character and 
prolongation of aerosol half-life, FPD output via 
the Nebuchamber unsurprisingly exceeds that of 
non-washed non-conducting VHCs when tested 
with and without sampling delays.34,77,79 Similar 
results have been observed with the metal Vortex 
VHC and the charge dissipative AC+FV aVHC, 
Pocket Chamber and AeroChamber MAX® 
[a slightly larger (198 ml) antecedent of the 
AC+FV aVHC].74,80 Thus, Suggett and col-
leagues reported a fluticasone FPD of 40 µg via 
the AC+FV aVHC and 25 µg via the Pocket 
Chamber compared to a FPD of less than 5 µg for 
three 
non-conducting 
VHCs 
(Compact 
SpaceChamber Plus®, Breath-A-Tech™ and 
PrimeAire®). Even following detergent washing, 
significant differences in FPD output were seen 
between the Compact SpaceChamber Plus and 
PrimeAire versus the AC+FV aVHC.80
In a further experiment, Suggett and colleagues 
evaluated the total emitted drug mass where fluti-
casone pMDI actuation into the detergent-
washed VHCs was timed to coincide with the 
onset of inhalation (simulating a perfectly ‘coor-
dinated’ patient) or the onset of exhalation (a 
worst-case ‘uncoordinated’ patient). Notably, 
total emitted mass was greatly reduced for the 
 Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 12 
6 
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar
anti-static Pocket Chamber and non-conducting 
PrimeAire to a clinically relevant degree in the 
uncoordinated versus coordinated simulation, but 
not 
for 
the 
AC+FV 
aVHC, 
Compact 
SpaceChamber Plus or Breath-A-Tech. The 
‘uncoordinated’ total emitted mass with the 
AC+FV aVHC thus markedly exceeded that with 
the anti-static Pocket Chamber (p < 0.001) [as 
well as that with the PrimeAire (p < 0.001)]. 
These data, which reflect differences in the effec-
tiveness of the respective VHC valving,67 thus 
illustrate differences between different anti-static 
VHCs, and between different non-conducting 
VHCs, in terms of their vulnerability to imperfect 
patient coordination.80 Another example of dif-
ferences in valving effectiveness is available from 
Sharpe and colleagues, who compared an out-of-
package AC+FV aVHC to a pre-treated A2A 
Spacer®. The total emitted mass was reduced by 
44% for the A2A but was unchanged for the 
AC+FV aVHC with ‘uncoordinated’ versus 
‘coordinated’ pMDI actuation.81
The resilience of the AC+FV aVHC performance 
to prolonged sampling delays has also been dem-
onstrated: with sampling delays of 2, 5 and 10 s 
the FPDs via the AC+FV aVHC following actua-
tion of a fluticasone pMDI were 42, 40 and 36 µg, 
respectively. 
In 
contrast, 
FPDs 
for 
the 
Optichamber Diamond, another anti-static VHC, 
at the corresponding sampling timepoints were 
35, 29 and 23 µg, respectively – significantly lower 
than for the AC+FV aVHC at the two later time 
points.82 Minimal aerosol losses with the AC+FV 
aVHC over a 10 
s period were again shown in a 
later study.83 These data therefore once again 
illustrate the potential for differences in perfor-
mance between different anti-static VHCs.
As summarized above, overt performance differ-
ences exist between anti-static and non-conduct-
ing VHCs. These have translated to large 
differences in in vivo lung deposition studies.72,73,84 
Thus meaningful differences in clinical outcomes 
would be expected to ensue. To date there are few 
clinical studies that have evaluated this hypothe-
sis. However, those that have been undertaken 
are instructive. Dompeling and colleagues85 and 
Dubus and colleagues86 both failed to show dif-
ferences between anti-static and non-conducting 
VHCs in their respective studies. In Dompeling’s 
paediatric study no PEFR differences were evi-
dent following salbutamol delivery via the 
Volumatic, AC+ VHC or metal Nebuchamber.85 
These results are, however, unsurprising given 
the notoriously shallow spirometric dose response 
for β-agonists87,88 allied to a population with 
near-normal baseline lung function. Similarly, in 
Dubus’ study, no differences in specific airway 
resistance (sRaw) or FEV1 were seen following a 
methacholine challenge in children administered 
salbutamol via a non-conducting Babyhaler, a 
detergent-washed 
Babyhaler 
or 
a 
metal 
Nebuchamber.86 While comments as to β-agonist 
dose response are again relevant, results from this 
study are perhaps more surprising as airway chal-
lenge (bronchoprovocation) studies typically offer 
greater potential for dose response than conven-
tional spirometric indices.89,90 However, detergent 
washing may confer variable and unpredictable 
anti-static effects upon the Babyhaler75 which, in 
addition to a pMDI that fitted poorly into the 
Nebuchamber, the obfuscation of late treatment 
differences by a cumulative dosing protocol and a 
suboptimal parallel group design, may explain the 
apparent lack of additional benefit from the anti-
static VHCs in Dubus’ study.
Two recent studies have been more encouraging. 
Prabhakaran and colleagues compared the anti-
static AeroChamber Plus Z-Stat® (functionally 
very similar to the AC+FV aVHC but comprising 
a slightly opaque base polymer and lacking an 
inspiratory flow indicator) to the non-conducting 
AC+ VHC in adults with nocturnal asthma,91 a 
phenotype that exhibits a prominent nocturnal 
decrease in lung function.92 Mean percentage 
predicted FEV1 values in the AeroChamber Plus 
Z-stat and AC+ VHC arms, respectively, after 1, 
2 and 4 salbutamol puffs were 52% versus 30%, 
73% versus 48% and 90% versus 64%.91 While 
these results are striking, the population studied 
represent a highly selected asthmatic phenotype. 
However, as noted by the authors, these data may 
imply potential benefits from using anti-static 
VHCs in the emergency room setting for acute 
asthma, and warrant further evaluation.
Another recent study is therefore of particular 
interest, given its real-world setting. Such studies 
have generated increasing attention in recent 
years93–95 due to their broad generalizability in 
contrast to conventional randomized, controlled 
trials. In a retrospective database study the clinical 
outcomes of two matched cohorts, the AC+FV 
aVHC cohort and the ‘any non-anti-static’ VHC 
cohort, were examined. Each cohort comprised 
over 9000 subjects, 86% of whom were under 18 
years of age. Over 12 months, compared to the 
‘any non-anti-static VHC’ cohort, in the AC+FV

aVHC cohort the annualized rate of moderate to 
severe exacerbations (defined as claims for oral 
corticosteroids, emergency room visits or in-
patient admission for asthma) was reduced by 
10% (p = 0.067), the time to first moderate to 
severe exacerbation was prolonged (p = 0.0005) 
and the incidences of ER visits (relative reduction 
13%; p = 0.017) and hospitalizations (relative 
reduction 19%; p = 0.072) were reduced.96 This 
study thus appears to link the in vitro VHC differ-
ences discussed earlier (such as the impact upon 
FPD of using untreated non-conducting VHCs) 
and clinical outcomes. In the light of these prom-
ising results, it is of note that compliance with 
spacer usage is reported to be poor,97,98 which 
would be expected to bias towards equivalence 
between VHCs. It would be of considerable inter-
est therefore to evaluate treatment differences 
between the AC+FV aVHC and non-conducting 
VHCs in a setting in which satisfactory levels of 
compliance could be assured, and in a population 
with more frequent exacerbations, as exacerbation 
frequency in the primarily paediatric/adolescent 
population evaluated by Burudpakdee and col-
leagues was relatively low.96 Under such circum-
stances it is plausible the differences between 
anti-static and non-conducting VHCs would be 
amplified.
Facemasks
Alongside measures to minimize static-related 
aerosol losses, facemasks are arguably the most 
important components of VHC systems. Expert 
consensus is that an ideal facemask should: facili-
tate a tight seal; incorporate minimal deadspace; 
be composed of a soft polymer and have a con-
toured rolled edge; reflect the facial contours of 
intended patient subgroups; and contain a low-
resistance exhalation valve directing exhaled air 
away from the VHC.99
Several studies have demonstrated the criticality 
of a tight facemask seal.100–103 For example, a 
facemask leak near the nose of only 0.4 cm2 has 
been shown to reduce lung delivery from 10% of 
the labelled dose to zero.101
In young children whose parents employed their 
usual VHC/facemask technique, the AC+ VHC 
facemask was shown to provide a seal as tight 
 
as that of the ‘gold standard’ Hans Rudolph 
anaesthetic mask, while the Nebuchamber mask 
provided the most porous seal. The authors 
attributed these results to the sharp, flat and 
relatively rigid edge of the Nebuchamber mask 
in contrast to the rounded, flexible edges of the 
other masks tested.102 In contrast to these results, 
in a recent in vitro study employing a facemask 
force of 1.9 kg, Xu and colleagues reported a 
substantial 
leak 
from 
the 
anti-static 
AeroChamber 
Z-Stat VHC/ComfortSeal® facemask that con-
siderably exceeded that from the anti-static 
Optichamber Diamond VHC/LiteTouch® face-
mask. Accordingly, drug delivery via the 
OptiChamber Diamond/LiteTouch exceeded 
that 
via 
the 
AeroChamber 
Z-Stat/ComfortSeal.104 
The incongruity between the results from the 
above two studies suggests either that position-
ing of the AeroChamber ComfortSeal facemask 
in Xu’s study was suboptimal, or that the 
ComfortSeal facemask requires a greater force 
applied to it than the Litetouch in order to facili-
tate a good seal.
Comparative in vitro testing of the AC+FV aVHC/
ComfortSeal mask and the OptiChamber Diamond 
VHC/LiteTouch mask in two further studies,105,106 
employing a lesser facemask force (1.6 kg) than in 
Xu’s study suggests positioning may have been the 
primary issue in the latter. Correct positioning of 
each VHC facemask was confirmed by Sharpe and 
colleagues and DiBlasi and colleagues prior to 
pMDI actuation by positioning the facemask to 
optimize flow through the model system (personal 
communication, Mark Nagel). Note that in both of 
these studies, although the same ComfortSeal mask 
was used as by Xu and colleagues, unlike in Xu’s 
study the AeroChamber model evaluated was the 
AC+FV aVHC, which includes a Flow-Vu inspira-
tory flow indicator. The latter comprises an 
enclosed flap atop the VHC that moves towards 
and away from the patient in synchrony with inha-
lation and exhalation, but does so only in the pres-
ence of a good seal. Thus adjustments can be made 
to facemask positioning to establish a satisfactory 
seal if one is not immediately attained. In both 
Sharpe’s and DiBlasi’s AC+FV aVHC studies, a 
greater delivered mass of drug was seen with the 
 
AC+FV aVHC/ComfortSeal mask than with 
 
the OptiChamber Diamond/LiteTouch.105,106 The 
discordance between these data and those of Xu 
and colleagues104 illustrates the real-world utility of 
a simple feedback mechanism, such as the inspira-
tory flow indicator, which facilitates an intuitive 
assessment of facemask positioning and seal 
integrity.
The practical benefit of the inspiratory flow indi-
cator is further supported by a paediatric clinical 
 Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 12

journals.sagepub.com/home/tar
study that compared the AC+ VHC and AC+FV 
aVHC for administering inhaled corticosteroid 
therapy.107 The mean improvement in the paedi-
atric asthma caregiver’s quality of life question-
naire 
(PACQLQ) 
exceeded 
the 
minimum 
clinically important threshold108 in the AC+FV 
aVHC group, but not the AC+ VHC group. The 
PACQLQ data were in accordance with device 
preference data, which indicated a strong prefer-
ence among caregivers for the AC+FV aVHC 
(p < 0.001). This is likely attributable to the 
inspiratory flow indicator as the most visible 
external difference between VHCs, and is an 
important finding since correct usage of, and 
adherence to, inhaled treatment are associated 
with ease of use and preference.109–111
Mask deadspace is a further important consider-
ation in infants, given their low tidal volumes. 
For example, in a 6-month-old infant, tidal vol-
ume is approximately only 55 ml. With such a 
tidal volume, increasing mask deadspace by 
approximately 50 ml may thus reduce aerosol 
delivery by 60%.112
Shah and colleagues evaluated mask deadspace 
and seal integrity for seven commercially availa-
ble VHC/mask combinations, applying three dif-
ferent forces to each facemask.113 The AC+ 
VHC, Optichamber and Vortex masks exhibited 
the lowest deadspace volumes at all three forces 
(⩽48 ml), and at 0.7 kg and 1.6 kg force were the 
only masks with deadspace volumes below the 
tidal volume of a 6-month-old infant. However, 
only the AC+ VHC and Optichamber masks 
formed seals at a low (0.7 kg) force, while the 
stiffer Vortex (the second stiffest of the masks 
tested) required a high force of 3.2 kg to establish 
a seal. Deadspace volume was decreased with 
increasing force (for all but the stiffest Pocket 
Chamber mask), with the greatest decrements 
noted for the most flexible masks: the Easivent®, 
ACE, and AC+ VHC. Unlike the AC+ VHC 
however, the Easivent and ACE required forces 
of 3.2 kg to provide to an acceptably low dead-
space volume. Overall, therefore, while this study 
demonstrated that five of the seven masks tested 
could potentially provide an appropriate dead-
space volume and seal, only the AC+ VHC and 
Optichamber masks did so with low and medium 
applied forces. These are important findings since 
forcefully applying a mask to a young child’s face 
will inevitably lead to distress, crying and non-
compliance, such that the likelihood of attaining a 
good seal will be negligible and aerosol delivery 
will be greatly diminished.114,115
In summary, the available comparative data that 
are principally in vitro indicate that the composi-
tion and design of the AC+FV aVHC/ComfortSeal 
are well suited to providing a good seal and mini-
mizing deadspace, and compare favourably with 
other marketed VHC/facemask delivery systems. 
Further, although not explicitly detailed above, 
the AC+FV aVHC/ComfortSeal complies with 
other aspects of ideal facemask design as identified 
at the International Society for Aerosols in 
Medicine (ISAM) Focus Symposium.99
Conclusion
There is substantial, occasionally contradictory, 
literature detailing the relative performance of a 
large number of different VHCs. During the early 
development of these devices much of the focus 
was upon their respective dimensions and shape. 
As VHC design has become more sophisticated 
and understanding of clinically relevant testing 
conditions has evolved, emphasis has shifted to 
other aspects of performance, prominent among 
which are consistency of drug delivery under a 
variety of test conditions, the influence of con-
ducting or charge dissipative materials, and the 
factors optimizing facemask performance.
It is now unequivocal that differences exist between 
different VHCs, which in a number of cases are 
sufficiently large that meaningful and overt clinical 
differences would be anticipated as a result. 
However, until recently there had been a lack of 
clinical studies of adequate scale and design which 
explored such issues. This perhaps explains why, 
despite a large volume of (principally in vitro) lit-
erature, few clinical and regulatory guidelines 
explicitly advocate that VHCs are not interchange-
able. The concordance between in vitro and in vivo 
outcomes evident in more recent clinical studies 
may start to change that paradigm.
With specific regards to the AC+FV aVHC, it 
builds on a substantial literature base that exists 
for earlier AeroChamber variants. That literature 
base includes clinical data for virtually all innova-
tor pMDIs currently approved in the US and EU, 
supporting the safety and efficacy of those pMDIs, 
in conjunction with the AC+ VHC. The consist-
ency of respirable dose delivery through the charge 
dissipative AC+FV aVHC for different active 
 S Dissanayake and J Suggett

9
substances, with immediate delivery and pro-
longed delay, in coordinated and uncoordinated 
simulations has been demonstrated. These data 
suggest overt advantages for the AC+FV aVHC 
versus non-conducting VHCs, but also illustrate 
performance differences alongside other anti-
static VHCs. Comparative data for the AC+FV 
aVHC/ComfortSeal facemask combination versus 
other VHC/facemasks support the attainment of a 
tight seal with the application of a relatively low 
force, which are a function of its design and con-
stituent materials, allied to a low deadspace which 
renders it appropriate for infants. A combination 
of the above features is likely to be implicated in 
the results of a recent real-world database study 
that demonstrated the benefits of the AC+FV 
aVHC over non-conducting spacers in a predomi-
nantly paediatric/adolescent population. Such 
studies may represent a viable and cost-effective 
research paradigm to probe for clinical differences 
between VHCs in future evaluations.
