Condensed abstract: 
Delirium is relatively frequent among advanced cancer patients visiting the emergency department 
(ED) of MD Anderson Cancer Center, at a rate of at least 9% using the Confusion Assessment 
Method, and all of these patients were also delirious per the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. 
Delirium is frequently missed by ED physicians; in 41% of the cases; despite prior education; 
highlighting the need for systematic screening for delirium among advanced cancer patients visiting 
the ED.

Abstract  
Background: The frequency of delirium among patients with cancer presenting to the emergency 
department (ED) is unknown. Our purpose was to determine delirium frequency and recognition by 
ED physicians among patients with advanced cancer presenting to the ED at MD Anderson Cancer 
Center.   
Patients and Methods: The study population was a random sample of English speaking advanced 
cancer patients who presented to the ED and met study criteria.  All patients were assessed with the 
Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to screen for delirium and with the Memorial Delirium 
Assessment Scale (MDAS) to measure delirium severity (mild ≤15, moderate 16-22, and severe ≥23). 
ED physicians were also asked whether their patients were delirious.  
Results: Of 243 enrolled patients, 22(9%) had CAM-positive delirium, and a median MDAS score of 
14 (range, 9-21 of 30). The median age of enrolled patients was 62 years (range 19-89 years). 
Patients with delirium had poorer performance status than patients without delirium (p <0.001), 
however, the two groups did not differ in other characteristics.  Of 99 patients 65 years and older, ten 
(10%) had CAM positive delirium, in contrast to 12 (8%) of 144 patients younger than 65 years 
(p=0.6). Per the MDAS, delirium was mild in 18 (82%) and moderate in 4 (18%) patients. Physicians 
correctly identified delirium in 13 (59%) of CAM-positive delirious patients.  
Conclusion: Delirium is relatively frequent and underdiagnosed by physicians in patients with 
advanced cancer visiting the ED. Further research is needed to identify the optimal screening tool for 
delirium in ED.

Introduction 
Delirium is the most common neuro-psychiatric syndrome in patients with advanced cancer 1-3 and 
tends to occur in individuals with underlying comorbid conditions who encounter additional acute 
insults 2-4.  Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 3, 5. Early diagnosis of 
delirium is critical for appropriate management and prevention of severe distress in patients, their 
families, and medical staff; however, delirium is frequently missed 6, 7 or misdiagnosed as worsening 
pain, depression, or anxiety 3. Delirium diagnosis is facilitated by tools based on specific criteria set 
by the American Psychiatric Association 8, such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) 9, 
which is widely used to diagnose delirium and has been validated in the emergency department (ED) 
setting. 6 In patients with cancer, most delirium studies have been limited to the palliative care setting, 
2, 10 and those in the ED setting have been limited to elderly patients11, 12.  
 
The exact frequency of delirium among patients with advanced cancer presenting to EDs is unknown. 
Rates of 8%-17% have been reported in elderly patients seen in a general ED 12. In hospitalized 
elderly patients, rates of 25%-44% have been reported 8.  Over 80% of patients with terminal cancer 
develop delirium in the last days of life 3, 13, 14. We previously observed delirium in over 40% of 
hospitalized cancer patients with a high symptom burden who required palliative care consultation 15. 
However, we do not know whether these patients presented to the ED with delirium or developed 
delirium during hospitalization 15.  The onset time of delirium is critical information because a 
diagnosis in the ED could help optimize therapeutic approaches, improving clinical outcomes and 
potentially lowering healthcare costs. Furthermore, a better understanding of the likelihood of delirium 
in advanced cancer patients in the ED would facilitate delirium diagnoses in this setting. 
 
The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of delirium among patients with advanced 
cancer who present to the ED at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We also determined the accuracy of 
ED physician assessments of delirium.

Patients and Methods 
Study design: 
This was a prospective cross-sectional observational study of patients with advanced cancer in the 
ED of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Study enrollment extended from March 11, 2013, through July 
21, 2014. Our primary aim was to determine the frequency of delirium in these patients. Our 
secondary aim was to determine whether physicians accurately predicted delirium. The study was 
approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board (IRB). This work was funded by the MD 
Anderson Institutional Research Grant, which had no role in the study design, collection, analysis, 
and interpretation of data or the decision to approve publication of the finished manuscript.   
 
Two hundred forty-three patients were enrolled in the study. We included only patients at least 18 
years old with advanced cancer, defined as locally recurrent or metastatic solid cancer not amenable 
to curative treatment or as relapsed or refractory hematologic cancer. Patients able to communicate 
in English who were in the ED for ≤12 hours and could provide consent or were accompanied by a 
legally authorized representative able to provide consent were included. We excluded unstable 
patients who required emergent medical attention, were comatose, had a documented history of 
dementia, had learning disability or other communication barriers such as aphasia or deafness, or 
were previously enrolled in this study. Patients with dementia were excluded as diagnosing delirium 
can be challenging particularly by a non-medical research assistant (RA), and there is limited 
evidence of the accuracy of the screening tools in detecting it. 16 The rationale for being in ED for less 
than 12 hours was to minimize the effect of psychoactive medications given in ED which contribute to 
delirium or excessive sedation that could complicate the assessment for delirium17.

During the planning stage of this study multiple instruments were assessed for reliability, validity and 
ease of use in an emergency setting.7, 18, 19  Based on the review, the CAM was chosen to diagnose 
delirium, and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) 20 was chosen to measure severity.  
 
The presence of delirium was expressed as a dichotomous variable based on the short CAM scoring. 
The CAM 9 is a four-item (scored from 0 to 4), valid, reliable, easy-to-use scale to diagnose delirium 
that is based on criteria for diagnosing delirium from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision 8.  A positive result (score of 3 or 4) comprises the presence 
of both feature 1 (acute onset and fluctuating course) and feature 2 (inattention) in addition to either 
feature 3 (disorganized thinking) or feature 4 (altered level of consciousness). Since cognitive 
assessment was performed as part of the MDAS, we elected not to repeat it again. The advantages 
of the CAM are that it has been validated in the ED 6, can differentiate between delirium and other 
cognitive conditions, and takes less than 5 minutes to complete in patients without cognitive 
impairment. The sensitivity and specificity of this tool are both over 90% for diagnosing delirium. 
Monette et al,21 compared the scoring of CAM by trained lay interviewer to that conducted by a 
geriatrician among 110 elderly patients in the ED setting. They found that CAM can be used by a 
trained lay interviewer with excellent sensitivity, specificity, and reliability compared with its use by a 
trained geriatrician 21. Similarly, research assistants were trained to assess for delirium in other 
studies22, 23.  
 
The severity of delirium was expressed as a continuous variable based on the MDAS. The MDAS is a 
10-item questionnaire scored on a 30-point scale, with higher scores reflecting more severe 
delirium
20
. The MDAS has been validated in hospitalized cancer patients but not in the ED. The test 
has good validity and inter-rater reliability. It is easy to administer after a short training period. Scores

of 15 or less denote mild, 16-22 moderate, and 23 or more severe delirium. This tool is used regularly 
by the palliative care team at MD Anderson, with a cutoff point of 7/30 indicating delirium 24. 
 
Setting and randomization:  
The MD Anderson ED has 43 examination rooms. Patients are seen first in the triage area, where their 
main presenting symptoms, vital signs, and disease acuity level (emergent, urgent, or non-urgent), are 
assessed before they are assigned to a room. Computer-generated random numbers were used to 
determine which rooms the RA approached and in what order.  
 
Before the study began, the RA underwent extensive training that included studying the CAM and 
MDAS manuals, lectures on delirium assessment by the principal investigator, and hands-on training 
in the palliative care clinic to score MDAS. The principal investigator observed the RA completing the 
full assessment of variables to be used in the study, including scoring the CAM and MDAS in the ED 
for five patients, and sporadically after activation of the study. ED physicians were educated about 
delirium and about the purpose of this study in two lectures during faculty meetings.  
 
Study protocol: 
The RA reviewed the medical records of patients assigned to the randomized room sequentially to 
determine eligibility criteria for the study. Patients were seen first by the treating ED physician. For 
each eligible patient, the RA asked the assigned physician whether the patient had the ability to give 
consent and was stable enough to be approached. If the physician judged the patient capable, the RA 
explained the study to the patient and obtained written informed consent. If the patient was judged 
unable to give consent and had a  legally authorized representative (LAR), then the study was 
explained, written informed consent was sought from the LAR, and the signature of a witness was 
obtained. Patients who dissented to participate or who had no available LAR able or willing to 
consent were excluded 25.

To ensure representative sampling, we recruited participants during the busiest times, between 
10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. After enrollment, patients were assessed for delirium by the RA using the 
CAM and MDAS instruments. After completing both instruments, the RA reviewed current 
medications used, including any over-the-counter medications, through a face-to-face interview with 
the patient and LAR (if present). The RA obtained demographic variables, triage acuity (emergent, 
urgent, or non-urgent), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 26 performance status. 
The RA then asked the responsible physician whether he or she believed that the patient had 
delirium. The response was recorded, and results of the CAM were shared with the physician.  
 
We reviewed all medical records of delirious patients to determine the likely reason for delirium, its 
type (hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed), potential medications contributing to delirium, and whether 
these medications were discontinued in the ED.  
 
Statistical analysis:  
Clinical characteristics of the study population were summarized using descriptive statistics. For the 
primary endpoint, we calculated the sample proportion and the 95% confidence interval for advanced 
cancer patients with delirium. Characteristics and outcomes for participants with and without delirium 
per the CAM were compared using the Fisher exact test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. P-values less 
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data analyses were conducted using SAS for 
Windows (release 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).  
 
Results 
Of 1832 patients screened for the study, 624 met the study criteria (Figure 1). Reasons for ineligibility 
are shown in Figure 1. Consent was obtained from 243 (39%) patients, and 90 (14%) patients or their 
physicians declined study participation. The remaining 291 (47%) eligible participants were not

approached because of logistic reasons (Figure 1). Among those approached, the consent rate was 
73%. Enrolled and unenrolled eligible patients did not differ significantly by age or sex. Men and 
women were equally represented, and age ranged from 19 to 89 years (median, 61.8; Q1 = 53.9, Q3 
= 69.5).  
 
Two hundred forty-one participants were assessed for delirium using both the CAM and the MDAS 
(Table 1). All 22 who were delirious according to the CAM were also delirious according to the MDAS. 
However, 22 participants who had negative results on the CAM had positive results on the MDAS. 
Participants who were delirious per the CAM had MDAS scores ranging from 9 to 21. Participants 
who were not delirious per the CAM but delirious per the MDAS had MDAS scores ranging from 7 to 
13 (Table 1). Among CAM-positive patients, delirium was mild in 18 (82%) and moderate in four (18%) 
according to the MDAS. 
 
Using the CAM, 9.1% (95% CI, 5.47%-12.71%) of advanced cancer patients were estimated to have 
delirium. Among all participants, 22 had a CAM score of 3 (n = 10) or 4 (n = 12), indicating delirium. 
Both the CAM and ED physician’s delirium assessments were available for 234 participants.  
The ED physician indicated that 15 (6.4%) study participants were delirious, including 13 of the 22 
participants with delirium per the CAM and two false positives. Physicians failed to detect delirium in 
nine (41%) participants (Table 2).  
 
Patients with delirium per the CAM did not differ significantly from other study participants with regard 
to race/ethnicity, sex, marital status, employment status, or age (Table 3). Delirium was diagnosed in 
10 (10%) of 99 patients aged 65 years or older and in 12 (8%) of 144 patients younger than 65 years 
(p = 0.6). Acuity level (severity index for ED triage) was emergent in 36% of patients with delirium and 
in 18% of patients without delirium per CAM; however, this group difference was not statistically 
significant (p = 0.1363). ECOG performance status differed significantly by delirium status (p <

0.0001); delirious patients most frequently scored 3 or 4 (poor performance), while patients without 
delirium most frequently scored 1 or 2. 
 
According to CAM, 18 (82%) of 22 participants with delirium had the hypoactive subtype, the 
remaining four (18%) had mixed delirium, and none had hyperactive delirium. The cause of delirium 
was multifactorial in almost all patients. Medications were a main contributing factor in at least 20 
(91%) participants. Other contributing factors included brain metastasis, fever/infection, organ failure, 
and chemotherapy. Medication adjustment and the removal of potential contributing medications were 
observed in two cases only.  
 
 
Discussion 
In this prospective observational study of advanced cancer patients who presented to the ED, we 
found that delirium was relatively frequent, at a rate of at least 9% using the CAM, and all of these 
patients were also delirious per MDAS. Delirium is frequently missed by ED physicians despite prior 
education on delirium. This finding highlights the need for systematic screening for delirium in 
advanced cancer patients visiting the ED.  
 
We used the CAM to screen for delirium as it was validated in the ED setting. Had we used the 
MDAS which is used regularly by our palliative care team to screen for delirium (with a cutoff point of 
7/30) we could have identified double the number of patients (44; i.e18%) with delirium. In the original 
MDAS development study in patients with cancer and AIDS, Brietbart et al.,  20 suggested a cutoff 
score of 13 to diagnose delirium with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 94%. However, Lawlor et 
al., 10 conducted a larger study using the MDAS in patients with advanced cancer and found a cutoff 
of 7/30 to denote delirium with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 96%. Kasmierski et al.,27

recommended a cutoff of 10 on the MDAS to diagnose delirium among cardiac surgery patients. The 
appropriate cutoff for the MDAS in the ED setting needs to be determined in future studies.  
 
ED physicians correctly identified delirium in 59% of patients. In a previous study, ED physicians 
correctly identified delirium in only 23% of patients 17. The higher identification rate may be related to 
our study design, in which ED physicians were educated about delirium before the study and were 
approached by the RA for approval before patient enrollment and after patient assessment. Although 
our result is encouraging, 41% of patients with delirium were still missed by ED physicians. This 
makes our findings of missed delirium and lack of discontinuation of contributing drugs more robust, 
and since the actual frequency of these findings may even be higher among ED physicians who do 
not undergo such educational intervention. This finding has major implications for the decision-
making process and quality of care.  
 
Medications were a contributing factor in precipitating delirium in most cases. However, these 
medications were not discontinued in most patients with delirium, despite the fact that the diagnosis 
was disclosed to physicians in all cases. These findings highlight the importance of educating ED 
physicians on the proper management of delirium and of discontinuing contributing medications. 
Delirium could be reversed in half of advanced cancer patients when caused by psychoactive 
medication 23Future studies should assess discontinuation of potential contributing medications (by a 
pharmacist) in the ED setting on the resolution of delirium.   
 
Our findings are likely underestimation of the rate of delirium in patients with advanced cancer in ED 
because we excluded some patients more vulnerable to delirium. These include patients who were 
medically unstable, had communications barriers, dementia, learning disability, or who refused to 
participate. The IRB placed some restrictions regarding enrolling patients requiring emergent care, or 
dissent to participate even after obtaining a signed consent from LAR. Given the devastating

13
consequences of missing delirium in ED, we believe that ease restrictions on delirium studies would 
result in higher identification rate. In some studies, signed informed consent were waived28.  
 
We did not find a statistically significant difference in age (younger than 65 years or at least 65 years) 
between patients with and without delirium. In a study of younger cancer patients (median age, 45 
years) undergoing stem cell transplant, 50% experienced at least one delirium episode. 29 Similarly, a 
median age of 58 years was found in patients with agitated delirium requiring palliative sedation in the 
acute palliative care unit 30. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to show the high rate of delirium 
among advanced cancer patients seeking emergent medical care, many of whom were relatively 
young compared with other populations with high rates of delirium. Our study has some limitations. It 
is a single-center study, so the total number of patients was relatively small. However, conducting the 
study in a large tertiary cancer center allowed us to evaluate many cancer patients in a relatively 
short period. Also, we likely introduced a bias by un-blinding ED physicians to the potential of delirium 
in their patients, which might have led to more frequent recognition of delirium. However, delirium was 
still missed by ED physicians in nine patients (41% of those with delirium) and was falsely positive in 
two patients. Selection bias was likely because patients who were unstable or who refused to 
participate,or had dementia or any of the conditions stated above  could have had a higher 
prevalence of delirium than consenting patients. Therefore, our findings potentially underestimate the 
actual prevalence of delirium in advanced cancer patients who present to the ED. Finally, due to 
feasibility reasons and unavailability of the RA at night, we were unable to enroll patients during 
evening hours resulting in artificially lower rate of delirium.  
 
In conclusion, delirium occurs frequently in advanced cancer patients visiting the ED but is often 
missed by physicians caring for these patients. Further research is needed to identify the optimal 
screening tool for delirium in ED.
