SUMMARY
Squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck
(HNSCC) is a common yet poorly understood cancer,
with adverse clinical outcomes due to treatment
resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Putative
cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in
HNSCC, and BMI1 expression has been linked to
these phenotypes, but optimal treatment strategies
to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance and elim-
inate metastases have not yet been identified. Here
we show through lineage tracing and genetic abla-
tion that BMI1+ CSCs mediate invasive growth and
cervical lymph node metastasis in a mouse model
of HNSCC. This model and primary human HNSCC
samples contain highly tumorigenic, invasive, and
cisplatin-resistant
BMI1+
CSCs,
which
exhibit
increased AP-1 activity that drives invasive growth
and metastasis of HNSCC. Inhibiting AP-1 or BMI1
sensitized tumors to cisplatin-based chemotherapy,
and it eliminated lymph node metastases by target-
ing CSCs and the tumor bulk, suggesting potential
regimens to overcome resistance to treatments and
eradicate HNSCC metastasis.
INTRODUCTION
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malig-
nancy of head and neck mucosa and the second most common
skin cancer. Currently, the standard of care for HNSCC includes
surgical excision and a combination of chemotherapy and radio-
therapy (Chinn and Myers, 2015; Haddad and Shin, 2008).
Nevertheless, the 5-year survival rates for patients with HNSCC
have remained low due to the high incidence of treatment resis-
tance with consequent recurrence and lymph node metastasis
(Hedberg et al., 2016; Polverini and No
¨ r, 1999; Wang et al.,
2012). Therefore, identifying the cellular and molecular mecha-
nisms of treatment resistance and metastasis has become a
prime target for novel drug discovery and design in an effort to
develop effective therapies.
Growing evidence shows that, among all neoplastic cells, a
very small fraction of cells serves as cancer stem cells (CSCs)
or cancer-initiating cells that are critical for tumor initiation
and growth and might be associated with metastasis and recur-
rence (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Brooks et al., 2015; Kreso and Dick,
2014; Lathia et al., 2015). For the last decade, CSCs have been
identified in a broad range of human solid tumors using cell sur-
face markers, which are associated with their stem cell pheno-
type (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Chakrabarti et al., 2014; Hermann
et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2014). These studies
have identified and characterized CSCs largely based on trans-
plantation assays in which human tumor cells were isolated ac-
cording to their expression of cell surface markers and then
grafted into host mice. However, there are several limitations
for these transplantation assays. For example, putative human
CSCs might be perturbed during the change of tissue microen-
vironment and might be artificially selected due to manipulation
in vitro (Brooks et al., 2015; Kreso and Dick, 2014). A mouse
model will be beneficial to investigate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that underlie CSCs in HNSCC in vivo. Based on
the CSC hypothesis, CSCs are located at the hierarchical
apex of tumor cells that can self-renew as well as differentiate
into the various cell types that comprise the tumor at large.
Recently, lineage-tracing studies in mice have provided genetic
evidence for CSC-driven clonal tumor growth in several types of
malignancies, and they have become the gold standard for
characterization of CSCs in vivo (Driessens et al., 2012; Naka-
nishi et al., 2013; Boumahdi et al., 2014; Oshimori et al., 2015;
Schepers et al., 2012).
CSCs in HNSCC were first characterized based on the
expression of the CD44 surface marker (Prince et al., 2007).
Other features, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activ-
ity, expression of c-Met, ability to efflux vital dyes (side popula-
tion), sphere-forming ability, or a combination of these features,
have also been used to isolate and characterize putative CSCs
in HNSCC in xenograft assays (Clay et al., 2010; Krishnamurthy
et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2014; Song et al., 2010; White et al.,
2013). Still, the role of CSCs in the initiation and progression
of HNSCC has not been rigorously examined in vivo in unper-
turbed tumors. Moreover, based on the CSC hypothesis,
CSCs are generally believed to be the origin of a tumor, which
may give rise to secondary cancers at metastatic sites that
follow a similar hierarchical organization as that of the primary

 tumor (Oskarsson et al., 2014). Unlike skin SCCs, HNSCC
frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes, and many pa-
tients with HNSCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage where
tumor cells have seeded the cervical lymph nodes. HNSCC
with lymph node involvement carries a poor prognosis and is
an important factor in predicting recurrence and survival after
removal of the primary tumor (Chinn and Myers, 2015; Hedberg
et al., 2016).
There are several unanswered questions that remain central
to understanding the behavior of HNSCC as well as to improving
the survival of HNSCC patients. First, are CSCs responsible for
HNSCC cervical lymph node metastasis? Cervical lymph node
metastasis portends a poor prognosis (Hedberg et al., 2016).
As of yet, genetic lineage analysis has not been able to defini-
tively show that CSCs mediate lymph node metastasis, largely
due to the experimental limitations of previous model systems.
Second, are CSCs responsible for tumor recurrence or resis-
tance after chemotherapy? While previous studies suggest
that CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy, it has not been
directly tested in vivo in an unperturbed tumor microenviron-
ment. Third, if CSCs are the source of metastasis or recurrence,
what therapeutic strategies can be employed to target these
cells? Based on the CSC hypothesis, what is the optimal thera-
peutic strategy for HNSCC? In other words, should we solely
target the rare CSCs by monotherapy or both CSCs and the tu-
mor bulk with combination therapy in order to achieve optimal
outcomes?
Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) is a core
component of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that
mediates gene silencing via monoubiquitination of histone H2A
(Park et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004). Bmi1 is an important
stem cell self-renewal factor. Bmi1 has been found to be abnor-
mally expressed in HNSCC, and it might be associated with the
self-renewal of CSCs in HNSCC (Prince et al., 2007; Siddique
and Saleem, 2012). For example, endothelial cell-derived growth
factors potently promote the survival and self-renewal of CSCs in
HNSCC by upregulating Bmi1 (Krishnamurthy et al., 2010).
Cisplatin treatment has been found to induce Bmi1 expression
and increase CSC populations in HNSCC (No
¨ r et al., 2014).
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor metastasis,
and CSC formation might be interconnected (Tam and Wein-
berg, 2013). In human HNSCC, Twist1 and Bmi1 act coopera-
tively to induce EMT and stemness, thereby indicating a role
for Bmi1 in HNSCC metastasis (Yang et al., 2010). Based on
these findings, we hypothesized that Bmi1+ tumor cells might
represent CSCs in HNSCCs and be associated with therapy
resistance in vivo. To address this hypothesis, we utilized a
well-established mouse model of HNSCC induced by 4-Nitroqui-
noline (4NQO), which recapitulates the initiation, development,
and metastasis of human HNSCC (Squarize et al., 2013; Vitale-
Cross et al., 2012). Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that
Bmi1+ cells were slow-cycled tumor-initiating stem cells that
were not only responsible for HNSCC development but also
mediated cervical lymph node metastasis. Bmi1+ CSCs in
HNSCCs had increased AP-1 activities and were cisplatin resis-
tant, which could recur after chemotherapy. Importantly, we
show that targeting the tumor bulk and Bmi1+ CSCs by combina-
tion therapy effectively inhibited HNSCC growth and eliminated
metastasis.
RESULTS
Bmi1 Is Expressed in a Subset of Slow-Cycling Tumor-
Propagating Cells in HNSCC
To explore CSCs in HNSCC in vivo, mice were treated with
4NQO in their drinking water for 16 weeks before returning to
normal drinking water for another 10 weeks (Figure 1A), as
described previously (Vitale-Cross et al., 2012). Mice were then
euthanized for the collection of their tongues and cervical lymph
nodes. Consistent with previous reports (Vitale-Cross et al.,
2012), mice developed lesions on the dorsal, ventral, and lateral
borders of the tongue upon treatment with 4NQO (Figure 1B).
Histological staining showed that mice developed various squa-
mous lesions, including hyperplasia, benign papilloma, and overt
SCC, in the tongue tissue at week 26 (Figure 1C). To determine
whether
Bmi1
labeled
CSCs
in
HNSCC,
we
performed
tamoxifen-induced Cre-mediated lineage tracing in Bmi1CreER;
RosatdTomato mice bearing HNSCC. Animals at 26 weeks after
the initial treatment with 4NQO were injected with a single
dose of tamoxifen. Then 1 day after the injection, Tomato+ cells
were found mostly located in the keratin 5-positive basal layer
and near the integrin a6-positive basement membrane in the
adjacent normal tongue epithelium (Figure 1C). The number of
Tomato+ cells was increased in epithelial hyperplasia and papil-
loma lesions (Figure 1C). Most of the Tomato+ cells were found in
the invasive front of HNSCC (Figure 1C). Tomato+ cells were not
observed in HNSCCs without tamoxifen treatment (data not
shown). To confirm the expression pattern of Bmi1 in HNSCC,
we performed Bmi1 in situ hybridization. Consistent with the line-
age-tracing experiments, Bmi1 mRNA was expressed in a sub-
set of benign papilloma and SCC tumor cells (Figure 1D).
To determine whether Bmi1+ tumor cells could self-renew and
differentiate in primary tumors in situ, we traced Tomato+ cells in
Bmi1CreER;RosatdTomato mice over a period of 6 weeks. At 7 days
after the tamoxifen injection, single cells or small clusters of two
to four Tomato+ tumor cells were observed (Figure 1E). The col-
onies formed by labeled cells at the invasive front and then
expanded progressively over time. After 6 weeks, Tomato+ tumor
cells occupied a large chunk of the tumor (Figure 1E). The
Tomato+ clones expressed both basal marker Keratin 14 and
suprabasal differentiation marker Keratin 10, indicating the differ-
entiation ability of Bmi1+ cells (Figure 1F). Importantly, the vast
majority of Bmi1+ cells expressed CD44 and Sox2, two known
markers that have been utilized for isolating CSCs (Figure 1G)
(Boumahdi et al., 2014; Prince et al., 2007). However, it appeared
that these markers had a broader expression pattern.
Stem cells in many tissues display a slow-cycling phenotype.
Therefore, we tested the relationship between Bmi1+ cells and
cycling cells using EdU labeling. We found that most of the
Bmi1+ cells were not actively proliferating (Figures 1H and 1I).
HNSCCs often metastasize to cervical lymph nodes. We also
observed Tomato+ colonies in cervical lymph nodes, which
increased in size over time (Figure 1J). Because some hemato-
poietic cells can express Bmi1, we confirmed that Bmi1+ cells
in cervical lymph nodes represented metastatic SCC cells with
an anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody specific for epithelial cells (Fig-
ure 1J). Tomato+ cells at early time points of metastasis re-
mained largely quiescent. However, once the clones developed,
active proliferating cells were detected within the clones

 (Figure 1J). Although we could not distinguish the stem cell pop-
ulation from their progenies, it was likely that Bmi1+ cells at the
metastatic sites gave rise to transient-amplifying cells, which
were responsible for EdU-positive staining. Collectively, genetic
lineage tracing demonstrates that Bmi1 marks a slow-cycling
population that is capable of self-renewal, producing tumor
progeny and metastasizing to lymph nodes.
Bmi1+ Tumor Cells Are Highly Tumorigenic and
Chemotherapy Resistant
To determine whether Bmi1+ tumor cells hold higher self-renewal
ability than Bmi1� tumor cells, we isolated Bmi1+ tumor cells
(double positive for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule
and
Tomato+;

and
Bmi1�
tumor
cells
(EpCAM+Tomato�) from primary mouse HNSCCs (Figure 2A).
We then measured their self-renewal ability by performing a
sphere-forming assay in an in vitro Matrigel system. While
EpCAM+Tomato�
cells
formed
very
few
small
spheres,
EpCAM+Tomato+ cells formed large ones (Figures 2B and
2C). Moreover, single cells from the primary spheres of
EpCAM+Tomato+ cells had a higher capability of forming sec-
ondary spheres (Figures 2B and 2C). Xenotransplantation
and limiting dilution assay results revealed a greater ability to
form tumors by EpCAM+Tomato+ cells compared to the

 EpCAM+Tomato� tumor cells in vivo (Figure 2D). To examine
whether these EpCAM+Tomato+ cells and their progenies re-
tained the ability to develop SCC in the orthotopic site and
metastasize to cervical lymph nodes, they were injected submu-
cosally in the tongue of nude mice. HNSCCs were detected in
nude mice after the orthotopic implantation of EpCAM+Tomato+
cells, but the mice that were injected with the same number of
EpCAM+Tomato� tumor cells failed to form primary tumors (Fig-
ures 2E and 2F). Moreover, fluorescence microscopic analysis
revealed that EpCAM+Tomato+ cells yielded higher rates of
lymph node metastasis (Figures 2E and 2F). The primary tumors
in the tongue and metastatic tumors in lymph nodes were further
confirmed histologically (Figures 2G and 2H).
Cisplatin is the most common chemotherapeutic drug for
HNSCC. However, over 50% of HNSCC patients are predicted
to recur or metastasize after therapy (de Mello et al., 2014).
Moreover, HNSCC often already has cervical lymph node metas-
tasis by the time of diagnosis (Hedberg et al., 2016). To evaluate
the chemotherapeutic response of Bmi1+ CSCs, we adminis-
tered tumor-bearing mice after 24 weeks of 4NQO treatment
with saline or five successive doses of cisplatin, and we injected
them with EdU 2 hr prior to euthanasia. The cisplatin-treated
mice displayed a marked decrease of EdU+ tumor cells
compared to the saline-treated mice, suggesting that cisplatin
potently kills mitotic tumor cells (Figures 2I and 2J). In contrast,
Bmi1+ CSCs were enriched after cisplatin treatment (Figures 2I
and 2K). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining with anti-active cas-
pase-3 antibodies revealed that apoptosis was mainly induced
in Bmi1� tumor cells rather than in Bmi1+ CSCs after the cisplatin
treatment (Figures 2L and 2M). To examine the fate of the Bmi1+
CSCs following the cisplatin treatment, we performed lineage
tracing of these cells (Figure 2N). We found that Bmi1+ CSCs
and their progenies were maintained in the recurrent/persistent
tumors (Figure 2O).
Bmi1+ CSCs Are Required for SCC Invasive Growth and
Metastasis
To test the requirement of Bmi1+ CSCs for tumor growth, we
bred the Bmi1CreER mice with R26DTA mice that conditionally
express an attenuated form of the diphtheria toxin (DTA). To
achieve efficient recombination activity, three successive appli-
cations of tamoxifen were topically applied to the oral cavity of
Bmi1CreER;R26DTA and Bmi1CreER mice 24 weeks after the initial
4NQO treatment (Figure 3A). Two days after tamoxifen adminis-
tration, we observed active caspase-3-positive tumor cells, sug-
gesting apoptosis in Bmi1CreER;R26DTA mice (Figure 3B). Lineage-
tracing results confirmed that tamoxifen treatment effectively
eliminated Bmi1+ tumor cells in the HNSCCs of Bmi1CreER;
R26tdTomato;R26DTA mice (Figure 3C). Then 2 weeks after elimi-
nating the Bmi1+ cells, tumors and lymph node samples were
collected. A significant difference was detected in the overall
affected lesion surface areas between Bmi1CreER;R26DTA and
Bmi1CreER mice (Figures 3D and 3E). Histological analysis re-
vealed that the number of SCCs was significantly reduced after
the ablation of Bmi1+ cells (Figure 3F). Moreover, mice rarely
developed highly invasive carcinomas when Bmi1+ cells were
depleted (Figure 3G). A significant decrease in Bmi1+ cells and
EdU-positive proliferating cells was detected in SCCs of
Bmi1CreER;R26DTA mice compared to Bmi1CreER mice upon
tamoxifen treatment (Figures 3H and 3I). Moreover, we found
that ablating Bmi1+ CSCs also significantly reduced the number
ofBmi1CreER;R26DTAmicewithlymphnodemetastasis(Figure3J).
Histological examination found that lymph node metastasis in
Bmi1CreER;R26DTA mice was less invasive compared to the
Bmi1CreER mice upon tamoxifen treatment (Figure 3K).
Depletion of Bmi1+ cells did not completely eradicate the tu-
mor as well as lymph node metastasis. It was possible that
remaining tumors contained transient-amplifying cells or differ-
entiating cells. Those cells could proliferate or survive for several
generations before they stopped cycling or were exhausted. We
then tested if cisplatin treatment could improve the outcome of
Bmi1+ cell depletion (Figure 3A). Histological analysis revealed
that the combination of Bmi1+ cell ablation and cisplatin treat-
ment had a strong inhibition of SCC growth (Figures 3D–3G).
EdU-positive proliferating cells were significantly reduced in
SCCs after the combination of Bmi1+ cell ablation and cisplatin
treatment as compared to Bmi1+ cell ablation alone (Figures
3H and 3I). Moreover, the combination treatment potently in-
hibited lymph node metastasis (Figures 3J and 3K).
Combination of Bmi1 Inhibitor and Cisplatin Potently
Inhibits HNSCC
Our results suggest that targeting the tumor bulk and Bmi1+
CSCs with combination therapy might be critical for achieving
optimal outcomes. To investigate whether targeting Bmi1’s func-
tions could block the fuel role of Bmi1+ CSCs in HNSCC, we took
advantage of the specific inhibitor of Bmi1, PTC-209 (Kreso
et al., 2014). Four groups of tumor-bearing mice were given
the
control
vehicle,
cisplatin,
PTC-209,
or
cisplatin
plus
PTC-209. We confirmed that PTC-209 functionally inhibited the
ubiquitination of histone H2A in SCC cells by inhibiting BMI activ-
ity (Figure S1A). Mice were treated with tamoxifen for lineage
tracing 5 days after the first treatment and then sacrificed
3 weeks later (Figure 4A). The inhibition of Bmi1 by PTC-209 in
tumors was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 4B). Whereas
cisplatin or PTC-209 treatment alone partially reduced the lesion
surface areas, cisplatin plus PTC-209 had the strongest inhibi-
tory effect (Figure 4C). Importantly, histological examination
revealed that cisplatin plus PTC-209 had a strong inhibition of
HNSCC
formation
in
mice
as
compared
to
cisplatin
or
PTC-209 alone (Figures 4D and 4E). Because there were some
remaining tumors in the cisplatin plus PTC-209 group, we further
compared the invasiveness of HNSCCs. HNSCCs from the
cisplatin plus PTC-209 group developed significantly less inva-
sive tumors compared to cisplatin or PTC-209 treatment alone
(Figure 4F). Of note, PTC-209 treatment did not affect adjacent
normal epithelial tissues (Figure S1B).
To examine how the monotherapy and combination therapy
affected Bmi1+ CSCs and proliferating tumor bulk cells, a sub-
group of mice that were pre-labeled with EdU for 2 hr was sacri-
ficed 24 hr after tamoxifen treatment. Whereas Bmi1+ CSCs
were enriched 5 days after cisplatin treatment, PTC-209 treat-
ment potently reduced Bmi1+ CSCs (Figure 4G). On the contrary,
cisplatin treatment was more potent to eliminate proliferating tu-
mor cells than PTC-209 treatment (Figures 4G and 4H). Cisplatin
plus PTC-209 treatment dramatically reduced both Bmi1+ and
proliferating tumor cells after 5 days (Figures 4G and 4H). At
the end of our experiments, lineage tracing revealed that
Cell Stem Cell 20, 621–634, May 4, 2017
625
 cisplatin treatment did not inhibit Bmi1+ CSC-derived tumor cell
growth compared to PTC-209 treatment. Cisplatin plus PTC-209
treatment exhibited the most dramatic inhibition of Bmi1+
CSC-derived tumor cell growth compared to cisplatin or
PTC-209 treatment alone (Figure 4I).
To determine whether recurrent or relapsed HNSCC responds
to cisplatin plus PTC-209, we set up a large new experiment and
extended our endpoint for an additional month to obtain mice
bearing recurrent HNSCCs (Figure 4J). Tomato labeling detected
Bmi1+ CSCs in these recurrent HNSCCs (Figure 4K), suggesting
that cisplatin plus PTC-209 might be unable to completely elimi-
nate Bmi1+ CSCs. However, it also was possible that Bmi1+
CSCs became resistant to cisplatin plus PTC-209. Therefore,
we further examined whether these recurrent HNSCCs re-
sponded to cisplatin plus PTC-209. Immunostaining revealed
that the second round of cisplatin plus PTC-209 treatment was
able to reduce proliferating tumor cells (Figures 4L–4N) and
Bmi1+ CSCs in recurrent HNSCCs again (Figure 4O). Our results
suggest that Bmi1+ CSCs in recurrent HNSCCs remained sensi-
tive to cisplatin plus PTC-209. Due to a variety of factors in vivo,
cisplatin plus PTC-209 could not eliminate Bmi1+ CSCs
completely. Moreover, because some mice also had recurrent

 HNSCCs after the combination of ablating Bmi1+ CSCs with DTA
and cisplatin, we determined whether recurrent HNSCCs
responded to the combination of Bmi1+ CSC depletion and
cisplatin again. We gave a second dose of tamoxifen and
cisplatin to mice carrying recurrent tumors (Figure S1C). Tomato+
CSCs were detected in the relapsed tumors after secondary
tamoxifen injection (Figure S1D). The combination of Bmi1+
CSC ablation and cisplatin also significantly reduced HNSCC
invasive growth (Figures S1E and S1F), and it killed proliferating
tumor cells and Bmi1+ CSCs again (Figures S1G and S1H).
To examine whether inhibiting Bmi1 affected cervical lymph
node metastasis, cervical lymph nodes of mice from different
treatments were immunostained with anti-pan-keratin anti-
bodies. Cisplatin or PTC-209 treatment alone partially reduced
the SCC invasive growth in lymph nodes compared to the control
vehicle (Figure 5A). Whereas cervical lymph node metastasis
was detected in 14 of 16 mice (87.5%) in the control group,
10 of 16 mice (62.5%) in the cisplatin group, and 9 of 16 mice
(56.3%) in the PTC-209 group, only 4 of 16 mice (25%) in the
cisplatin plus PTC-209 group had metastasis (Figures 5A and
5B). Lineage tracing found that PTC-209 potently inhibited
Bmi1+ CSC-derived tumor cell growth in lymph nodes compared
to cisplatin. However, cisplatin plus PTC-209 treatment showed
a more dramatic inhibition of metastatic tumor cell growth in
lymph nodes compared to PTC-209 or cisplatin treatment alone
(Figure 5C). Metastatic tumor cells are very resistant to chemo-
therapy (Hedberg et al., 2016). To examine whether cisplatin
plus PTC-209 could directly eliminate metastatic Bmi1+ CSCs
in lymph nodes, we treated mice at 26 weeks after 4NQO induc-
tion at which lymph node metastasis was readily established
(Figure 5D). We found that cisplatin plus PTC-209 also directly
eradiated metastatic Bmi1+ CSCs and proliferating tumor cells
compared to cisplatin or PTC-209 alone (Figures 5E–5G).

 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found 1,107 genes upregulated
and 1,481 genes downregulated in Tomato+ tumor cells
by >2-fold compared to Tomato� tumor cells (Table S1). Genes
upregulated in Bmi1+ CSCs were associated with known CSC
signatures (Bmi1, Hmga2, Met, Cd44, Aldh7a1, Aldh1a3, Krt14,
and Krt5), cell motion and migration (Cap1, Flt1, Gli2, Gli3,

adhesion (Cd33, Suc, Cdh3, Cdh5, Col7a1, Emcn, Lama3,

genes associated with keratinocyte differentiation were downre-
gulated in Bmi1+ CSCs (Figure 6A). Importantly, bioinformatic
analysis revealed that the expression of activator protein-1

S100a8,
S100a9, and S100a11) was significantly increased in Bmi1+
CSCs, indicating that AP-1 activities were increased in Bmi1+
CSCs. AP-1 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in tu-
mor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Zeng et al.,
2002b; Ding et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2014). Increased AP-1 activ-
ities in Bmi1+ CSCs might be responsible for Bmi1+ CSC-medi-
ated tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Real-time RT-PCR
confirmed that Fosl1 andother AP-1-dependent genes were high-
ly expressed in Bmi1+ CSCs (Figure 6B). Although our RNA-seq
did not detect that Jun was changed in Bmi1+ CSCs, real-time
RT-PCR did find that Jun was also increased in Bmi1+ CSCs (Fig-
ure 6B). FOSL1 is a family member of FOS proteins that dimerizes
withJUN toformtheAP-1complex,therebyactivating AP-1 target
genetranscription.Fosl1 expressionisalsopositivelyregulatedby
AP-1, and increased Fosl1 expression is an indicator of AP-1 acti-
vation (Ding et al., 2013). Immunostaining further confirmed that
FOSL1 was highly expressed in Bmi1+ CSCs (Figure 6C).
To investigate whether AP-1 played a functional role in Bmi1+
CSC-mediated HNSCC development and chemoresistance, we
took advantage of a specific inhibitor of AP-1, 3-(5-(4-(cyclopen-
tyloxy)-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-((3-hydroxybenzo[d]isoxazol-6-yl)
methoxy)phenyl) propanoic acid (3-PA), which has been used
for treating mouse arthritis and oral cancer in vivo by inhibiting
AP-1 (Ye et al., 2014; Kamide et al., 2016). Real-time RT-PCR
confirmed that 3-PA potently inhibited AP-1 activities in Bmi1+
CSCs (Figure S2). Four groups of tumor-bearing mice were given
the control vehicle, cisplatin, 3-PA, or cisplatin plus 3-PA. Mice
were treated with tamoxifen for lineage tracing 5 days after the
first treatment and then sacrificed 3 weeks later (Figure 6D).
Whereas cisplatin or 3-PA treatment alone partially reduced
the lesion surface areas, cisplatin plus 3-PA had the strongest
inhibitory effect (Figure 6E). Importantly, histological examina-
tion revealed that cisplatin plus 3-PA significantly reduced the
number of HNSCCs in mice compared to cisplatin or 3-PA alone
(Figures 6F and 6G). Cisplatin plus 3-PA also significantly
reduced the HNSCC invasion grade (Figure 6H).
To examine how the monotherapy and combination therapy
affected Bmi1+ CSCs and proliferating tumor bulk cells, a sub-
group of mice that were pre-labeled with EdU for 2 hr was sacri-
ficed 24 hr after tamoxifen treatment (Figure 6D). Cisplatin treat-
ment was more potent in eliminating proliferating tumor cells
than 3-PA treatment. Whereas Bmi1+ CSCs were enriched
5 days after cisplatin treatment, 3-PA treatment potently reduced
Bmi1+ CSCs (Figures 6I and 6J). Cisplatin plus 3-PA treatment
dramaticallyreducedbothBmi1+andproliferatingtumorcellsafter
5 days (Figures 6I and 6J). At the end of our experiments, lineage
tracing revealed that 3-PA treatment inhibited Bmi1+ CSC-derived
Tomato+ tumor cell growth compared to cisplatin. Cisplatin plus
3-PA treatment exhibited the most dramatic inhibition of Bmi1+
CSC-derived Tomato+ tumor cell growth compared to cisplatin
or 3-PA treatment alone (Figure 6K). Moreover, cisplatin plus
3-PAalsosignificantlyinhibitedlymphnodemetastasis(Figure6L).
Inhibiting BMI1 or AP-1 Overcomes Chemotherapy
Resistance and Prevents Metastasis of Human HNSCC
Cisplatin has been found to induce Bmi1 and increase putative
CSCs in human HNSCC cell lines in vitro (No
¨ r et al., 2014). Based
on the results from our mouse model, we were interested in
determining whether targeting BMI1 could overcome cisplatin
resistance in human HNSCC. ALDHhigh and CD44+ have
been widely used as markers for isolating CSCs from human
HNSCC cell lines and primary tumors. Tumorsphere formation
assays confirmed that ALDHhigh/CD44+ cells from human
primary HNSCC formed more tumorspheres in vitro than
ALDHhigh/CD44�, ALDHlow/CD44�, and ALDHlow/CD44+ tumor
cells (Figure S3A). We isolated ALDHhighCD44+ cells from
parental
SCC1
cells
and
cisplatin-resistant
SCC1
cells
(SCC1R) that were maintained in 5 mM cisplatin (Figure S3B).
Consistent with previous studies (No
¨ r et al., 2014), real-time
RT-PCR showed that BMI1 was highly expressed in CSCs iso-
lated from SCC1 cells. CSCs isolated from SCC1R cells had
the highest expression of BMI1 (Figure S3C). Similarly, BMI1
expression was significantly higher in CSCs isolated from other
HNSCC cell lines, including SCC23, SCC9, and HN13 (Fig-
ure S3D). The inhibition of BMI1 by PTC-209 restored SCC1R
cell sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Figures S3E–
S3G). The combination of PTC-209 and cisplatin also potently
induced apoptosis in SCC23 and SCC9 cells (Figures S3H and
S3I). More importantly, cisplatin plus PTC-209 significantly in-
hibited tumor invasive growth and metastasis of CSCs that
were isolated from SCC1R cells in vivo (Figure S4).
We further examined whether BMI1 was highly expressed in
CSCs isolated from human primary HNSCC tissues using
ALDHhighCD44+EpCAM+
markers
(Figure
7A).

compared
with
ALDHlowCD44�EpCAM+ cells (Figure 7B). Moreover, AP-1 target
genes, including FOSL1, MMP3, MMP9, and MET, were also
highly expressed in ALDHhighCD44+EpCAM+ tumor cells, indi-
cating that AP-1 activities are abnormally increased in human
primary CSCs (Figure 7B). ALDHhighCD44+EpCAM+ tumor cells,
but not ALDHlowCD44�EpCAM+ tumor cells, were highly tumor-
igenic when they were xenografted into nude mice. To investi-
gate whether targeting BMI1 had a direct effect on CSCs, we as-
sessed the self-renewal potential of human CSCs by detecting
their ability to form tumorspheres in vitro. Knockdown of BMI1
by two different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibited the for-
mation of tumorspheres by human CSCs (Figures S5A–S5C).
Knockdown of FOSL1 by two different siRNAs also inhibited
the formation of tumorspheres by human primary CSCs (Figures
S5B–S5D). Consistently, treatment with PTC-209 or 3-PA also
resulted in a significant reduction in the sphere formation of hu-
man CSCs (Figures S5E–S5H). The ectopic expression of FOSL1
was able to rescue tumorsphere formation inhibited by PTC-209
or BMI1 knockdown (Figures S5I–S5M).
To examine whether the inhibition of BMI1 by PTC-209 over-
came human primary CSC resistance to cisplatin and prevented
metastasis in vivo, we injected 1 3 104 CSCs, isolated from hu-
man primary HNSCC, submucosally in the tongue of nude mice.
The mice were randomly divided into four different groups and
treated with the control vehicle, cisplatin, PTC-209, or cisplatin
plus PTC-209. Cisplatin plus PTC-209 significantly inhibited tu-
mor growth compared to cisplatin or PTC-209 alone (Figures
7C and 7D). Moreover, histological analysis demonstrated that
human CSCs metastasized to cervical lymph nodes with high ef-
ficiency. Cisplatin treatment did not significantly prevent cervical
630

 lymph node metastasis compared to the control vehicle. While
5 of 8 mice (62.5%) had lymph node metastasis after PTC-209
treatment, cisplatin plus PTC-209 had significantly less lymph
node metastasis (12.5%) (Figures 7E and 7F).
Due to the fact that AP-1 activities were found to be increased
in human primary CSCs, we further examined whether inhibiting
AP-1 could also overcome CSC resistance to cisplatin and pre-
vent metastasis in vivo. Nude mice injected with human primary
CSCs were randomly divided into four groups, and they were
treated with the control vehicle, cisplatin, 3-PA, or cisplatin
plus 3-PA. While 3-PA or cisplatin treatment alone partially
reduced tumor growth, cisplatin plus 3-PA potently inhibited tu-
mor growth in vivo (Figures 7G and 7H). Moreover, histological
analysis revealed that cisplatin plus 3-PA significantly prevented
cervical lymph node metastasis compared to cisplatin or 3-PA
treatment alone (Figures 7I and 7J).

 To further confirm whether BMI1 was associated with human
HNSCC lymph node metastasis, we performed immunostaining
to compare BMI1 expression in human HNSCC specimens with
or without lymph node metastasis. Immunostaining revealed that
the levels of BMI1 were significantly higher in human primary
HNSCC specimens with metastasis than in HNSCC specimens
without metastasis (Figures S5A and S5B). Because there were
some conflicting reports regarding BMI1 in HNSCC (H€
ayry
et al., 2010), we further examined the expression of BMI1 in met-
astatic tumor cells in lymph nodes. Compared to human primary
HNSCC specimens, the levels of BMI1 were further significantly
increased in the majority of human SCC lymph node metastases
(Figures S6A and S6B). Pearson correlation analysis showed that
BMI1 was positively correlated with the levels of FOSL1 in
HNSCC (r = 0.796, p < 0.01; Table S2). Moreover, double staining
revealed that BMI1 and FOSL1 were co-expressed in the nuclei
of human HNSCC tumor cells (Figure S6C).
DISCUSSION
Using genetic lineage tracing, we demonstrated that Bmi1 marks
a slow-cycled population of CSCs that are responsible for
HNSCC initiation, development, and metastasis. We showed
that Bmi1+ CSCs mediate invasive growth and, thus, provide
the experimental proof for the hypothesis of CSC-mediated
metastasis. Bmi1+ CSCs have increased AP-1 activities, which
provide a molecular explanation for Bmi1+-mediated invasion
and metastasis. Cisplatin could efficiently kill proliferating cells,
but not Bmi1+ CSCs, which might be responsible for the relapse
of HNSCC. Importantly, we compared different therapeutic stra-
tegies for HNSCC, and we found that targeting both the tumor
bulk and CSCs yielded better therapeutic outcomes compared
to monotherapy. Our results might also have important implica-
tions for developing new approaches to treating other solid
tumors.
The invasive growth plays a critical role in the progression of
dysplasia and papilloma into HNSCC (Ding et al., 2013; Hedberg
et al., 2016). We found that Bmi1+ cells were increased in
dysplasia. It could be that accumulating genetic and epigenetic
events might promote Bmi1+ cells in dysplasia and papilloma to
become tumorigenic Bmi1+ CSCs in HNSCC. Importantly, we
observed that most of Bmi1+ CSCs were located at the invasive
front of HNSCC, suggesting that Bmi1+ CSCs mediate invasive
growth of HNSCC. BMI1 has been found to repress E-cadherin,
which is frequently lost or downregulated in human HNSCC. The
elevated levels of BMI1 are associated with HNSCC metastasis
and the poor prognosis of patients (Yang et al., 2010). In
contrast, it was also reported that loss of BMI1 in human HNSCC
contributed to a poor prognosis (H€
ayry et al., 2010). The reasons
for the conflicting findings are unclear. To further confirm our re-
sults, we examined BMI1 expression in human HNSCC. We
found that BMI1 was positively associated with human HNSCC
lymph node metastasis. Mechanistically, we found that AP-1 ac-
tivities were increased in Bmi1+ CSCs, thereby providing a
driving force for Bmi1+ CSC-mediated invasive growth and
metastasis. AP-1 directly regulates the expression of multiple
invasive genes, including MMPs and cytokines (Ding et al.,
2013; Tam et al., 2013). FOSL1 was found to be highly expressed
in CSCs from both mouse and human HNSCCs. Consistent with
our studies, FOLS1 was also identified as a key mediator of
CSCs in breast cancer (Tam et al., 2013). Additionally, we found
that FOSL1 expression was strongly enriched in BMI1+ cells of
human HNSCC specimens. Taken together, our results suggest
that the abnormal activation of AP-1 plays a critical role in Bmi1+
CSC-mediated HNSCC invasive growth.
Based on the CSC hypothesis, CSCs may be associated with
tumor metastasis due to their self-renewing capacity. Although
this assumption has been supported by xenograft models in
immunodeficient mice (Hermann et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010; Os-
karsson et al., 2014), until now, it has not been experimentally
tested by genetic lineage tracing in a spontaneously formed tu-
mor model. For example, Sox2+ CSCs have been identified in
the skin SCC, and the ablation of Sox2+ CSCs inhibited the initi-
ation and development of the skin SCC (Boumahdi et al., 2014).
However, it was unknown whether targeting Sox2+ CSCs
affected metastasis of the skin SCC. Although the skin SCC
and HNSCC have a similar pathology, the tumor microenviron-
ment of the two SCCs is different, and the molecular and epige-
netic mechanisms that control their initiation and progression
might be distinct. In our mouse model, we were able to consis-
tently detect cervical lymph node metastasis to which HNSCC
most often metastasize. Based on the following evidence, we
believe that Bmi1+ CSCs are responsible for cervical lymph
node metastasis: (1) lineage tracing revealed that Bmi1+ CSCs
were present in cervical lymph nodes; (2) in the combination of
lineage tracing and transplantation assays, we confirmed that
Bmi1+ CSCs, but not Bmi1� tumor cells, could metastasize to
cervical lymph nodes; (3) ablation of Bmi1+ CSCs inhibited lymph
node metastasis; and (4) Bmi1+ CSCs had increased AP-1 activ-
ities and targeting AP-1 inhibited invasive growth and metastasis
of HNSCC.
Recurrent tumor growth due to cisplatin resistance is a major
obstacle in HNSCC treatment (No
¨ r et al., 2014; Polverini and No
¨ r,
1999). Using genetic lineage tracing, we provided evidence that
cisplatin treatment mainly killed proliferating cells and subse-
quently enriched Bmi1+ CSCs. The surviving Bmi1+ CSCs were
able to repopulate and form the tumor bulk after the cisplatin
treatment, thereby indicating heterogeneity of drug sensitivity
between different tumor cell types. Our results suggest that
Bmi1+ cells are a major cause for cancer relapse. Recently, using
xenograft models in nude mice, PTC-209, the Bmi1 inhibitor, was
shown to inhibit tumor growth by targeting the self-renewal of
CSCs isolated in human colorectal cancer (Kreso et al., 2014).
However, it was unknown whether the inhibition of Bmi1 affected
tumor metastasis and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy.
Using lineage tracing in a spontaneously formed mouse model,
we compared three different therapeutic options, and we found
that targeting both the tumor bulk and Bmi1+ was more effective
in reducing tumor burdens and eliminating cervical lymph node
metastasis. Although ablating Bmi1+ CSCs or use of the Bmi1 in-
hibitor impaired HNSCC growth and metastasis, it was not as
effective as the combination therapy. There are several potential
reasons. Ablating Bmi1+ CSCs or the Bmi1 inhibitor might be un-
able to completely abolish Bmi1 functions, and Bmi1� tumor
cells were able to proliferate and sustain the tumor bulk until
they were worn out. It also was possible that Bmi1� tumor cells
might have evolved and dedifferentiated into CSCs in the natural
tumor microenvironment. Finally, inhibiting Bmi1+ CSCs might
632
Cell Stem Cell 20, 621–634, May 4, 2017
 promote tumor cells to reprogram into other different CSCs,
such as Sox2+ CSCs. In fact, the stroma of HNSCC contains
infiltrated inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes and macro-
phages, which can secrete a variety of cytokines and growth
factor (Ding et al., 2013). These cytokines and growth factors
could activate oncogenic signaling pathways that might be
able to reprogram or dedifferentiate tumor cells into CSCs.
In colon cancer, it has been shown that the activation of NF-kB
and b-catenin can dedifferentiate or reprogram differentiated tu-
mor cells into CSCs (Kreso and Dick, 2014). In the future, it will be
interesting to experimentally test this possibility. However, the
most favorable explanation is that the Bmi1 inhibitor could
also reduce the apoptotic threshold of CSCs in addition to tar-
geting Bmi1+ self-renewal, thereby sensitizing Bmi1+ CSCs to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In fact, lineage tracing showed
that, with the combination therapy, the number of Bmi1+ CSCs
was most potently reduced. Moreover, the combination therapy
not only dramatically reduced tumor sizes but also decreased
the incidence of tumors and cervical lymph node metastasis
in vivo. It should be pointed out that we did observe some recur-
rent HNSCCs in mice after the initial combination therapy. These
recurrent HNSCCs still responded to the second round of com-
bination therapy, suggesting that targeting CSCs might help to
prevent the development of chemotherapy resistance (Kreso
et al., 2014). However, we could not rule out that a subpopulation
of Bmi1+ CSCs might accumulate molecular and epigenetic
changes under certain selective pressures, thereby resulting in
resistance. Altogether, our studies experimentally tackle an
important question that could be applied to other solid tumors,
such as breast cancer and colon cancer, which also frequently
metastasize to lymph nodes or distant organs. To effectively
inhibit tumor growth and prevent metastasis or tumor recur-
rence, targeting both the proliferative tumor bulk and relatively
quiescent CSCs through a combination therapy might yield
better outcomes.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
C57BL/6, NOD/SCID and nude mice were housed under standard conditions in the animal facility of UCLA. All procedures were per-
formed based on the UCLA Animal Research Committee-approved protocols. For induction of HNSCC, six-week-old mice were
treated with drinking water containing 50 mg/ml 4NQO for 16 weeks and then given with normal drinking water for another 8-10 weeks.
For lineage tracing and Bmi1+ cells ablation studies, Cre was activated by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen at a dose of 9 mg per
40 g body weight. For therapeutic treatment, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and given the vehicle 1) control, 2) cisplatin
(1 mg/kg body weight for five successive days), 3) PTC-209 (60 mg/kg body weight for 4 weeks) or 3-PA (120 mg/kg body weight), and
4) cisplatin plus PTC-209 or cisplatin plus 3-PA. The animals were randomly assigned to procedure groups. The experiments were
not conducted in a completely blinded fashion. We used a sample size of at least 6 mice per group to reach statistical significance
based on our previous experiences. The experiments were repeated at least once.
Human HNSCC Tumor Samples
The use of human HNSCC samples for this study was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Human HNSCC primary
tissues were obtained from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and subcutaneously inoculated into flank of 6-week-old
NOD/SCID mice (The Jackson Laboratory). HNSCC The paraffin-embedded blocks of the human HNSCC were obtained from the
UCLA Translational Pathological Core Laboratory and sectioned for immunohistochemistry. Sample-size was determined based
on our published studies (Ding et al., 2013) and past experiences. No subjects were excluded from our studies.
Cell Lines
Human HNSCC cell lines SCC1, SCC9, SCC22B, SCC23 were obtained from University of Michigan and HN13 was from NIDCR, and
they were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin) at 37�C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Cisplatin-resistant SCC1R and SCC23R cell lines were established by chronic culture in the low concentration of cisplatin and main-
tained in 2-5 mM of cisplatin.
METHODS DETAILS
4NQO model, Lineage Tracing and Chemotherapy
Bmi1CreER (JAX:010531), R26tdTomato (JAX:007908), R26DTA (JAX:009669) mouse strains were purchased from The Jackson Labora-
tory. Nude mice (NCRNU-F) were from Taconic and NOD/SCID mice (JAX:001303) were from Jackson Laboratory. For induction of

Cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#479306) was dissolved in saline. PTC-209 (MedChem Express, Cat# HY-15888) was dissolved in 14%
DMSO, 36% polyethylene glycol 400 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#202304) and 50% polypropylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#4347). 3-PA
(MedChem Express, Cat#HY-12270) was dissolved in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). For therapeutic treatment, mice were randomly
divided into 4 groups and given the 1) vehicle control, 2) cisplatin (1 mg/kg body weight for five successive days), 3) PTC-209
(60 mg/kg body weight for 4 weeks) or 3-PA (120 mg/kg body weight), or 4) cisplatin plus PTC-209 or cisplatin plus 3-PA, respectively.
For tumor measurement, mice were sacrificed, and tongues and cervical lymph nodes were dissected immediately. The number of
gross tongue lesions was counted, and the surface areas of tumors were measured as described previously (Squarize et al., 2013).
Longitudinally cut tongues (dorsal/ventral) and intact lymph nodes were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin and sectioned into 5 mm sections. The depth of the tumor invasion of the tongue was determined in the H&E stained sections
according to the following criteria: showing signs of normal appearance (grade 0); epithelial dysplasia confined to tongue epidermis
(grade 1); distinct invasion, unclearness of basement membrane, drop and diffuse infiltration into the superficial portion of the muscle
layer (grade 2); loss of the basement membrane, extensive invasion into deep muscle layer (grade 3). The sections of cervical lymph
nodes were immunostained with anti-pan cytokeratin antibodies (Santa Cruz Cat#sc-8018). The percentage of lymph nodes with
metastasis was calculated.
Cell Proliferation Assays
To determine cell proliferation in vivo, EdU or BrdU (100 mg/mice) was injected intraperitoneally 2 hr before the lethal administration
of CO2 to mice. EdU incorporation was detected using a Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Cat#C10337) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. BrdU incorporation was detected using the immunohistochemistry
approach as described above.
Immunostaining and in situ Hybridization
Mouse HNSCC tumors and cervical lymph nodes were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight. Samples
were then rinsed with cold PBS, equilibrated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight and embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek Cat#25608-930).
Cytosections at a thickness of 8 mm were cut by using a Leica cryostat and collected with Superfrost Slides (Fisher Scientific
Cat#12-550-15). Primary antibodies were used: anti-cytokeratin 5 (Santa Cruz Cat#905501; 1:500), anti-integrin 6 (Santa Cruz
Cat#ab105669;
1:1000),
anti-pan-cytokeratin
(1:500),
anti-E-cadherin
(Abcam
Cat#ab15148;
1:500),
anti-Sox2
(Abcam
Cat#ab97959; 1:200), anti-CD44 (Abcam Cat#ab51037; 1:500), anti-Ki67 (Abcam Cat#ab15580; 1:400), anti-active-capsase3
(Abcam Cat#ab2302; 1:250), anti-BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#B8434; 1:100) and anti-FOSL1 (Santa Cruz Cat#sc-605; 1:100). The an-
tigens were visualized using appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy2 or Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-
tories). Sections were counterstained with 4’6’-diamidino-2-phenilindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich Cat#D9542) and mounted with
SlowFade Antifade Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#S36937). EdU incorporation was detected using a Kit following the man-
ufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#C10337). In situ hybridization for Bmi1 transcripts was performed following the
manufacturer’s instructions using RNAscope probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Cat#407631) and 2.0 HD brown kits (Advanced
Cell Diagnostics Cat#320497). Images were acquired with a microscopy running CellSens software (Olympus http://www.
olympus-lifescience.com/en/software/cellsens/).
For Immunohistochemistry of human HNSCC, Paraffin-embedded sections provided by the UCLA Translational Pathological Core
were deparaffinized with xylene and then rehydrated with distilled water through an ethanol series. Tissue antigens were retrieved as
described previously (Ding et al., 2013). The slides were stained with polyclonal anti-FOSL1 antibodies (1:100; Santa Cruz, sc-605),
anti-BMI1 antibodies (1:100, Santa Cruz Cat#sc-10745) or control IgG at 4�C overnight, respectively. The slides were then incubated
with horseradish perioxidase-labeled polymer for 60 min. The immunocomplexes were detected with AEC+ chromogen (Dako
EnVision System Cat#MP-6401-15) and counterstained with hematoxylin. The intensity of immunostaining was scored as follows:
0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining; 4, very strong staining. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was
applied to test the significant differences in IHC staining intensity between different groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient of
liner regression was used to determine the correlation between different proteins.
Cell Isolation and Flow Cytometry
Mouse or primary HNSCC tumor tissues were dissected and minced well with scalpels in petri dishes on ice and then enzymatically
dissociated into single cell suspensions by incubation with Collagenase/Dispase (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 10269638001) for 90 min at
37�C. The suspension was then homogenized by pipetting and the enzymes were inactivated with full serum media. Subsequently,
tumor cells were washed with media for excess enzyme removal. Primary mouse SCC cells were stained with anti-EpCAM-PE an-
tibodies (1: 10; eBioscience Cat#12-5791-83) at room temperature for 30 min. Bmi1+ cells were isolated based on the expression of
EpCAM and tdTomato. To isolate putative CSCs from human primary HNSCC, tumor cells were stained with the ALDHEFLUOR
assay kit (STEMCELL Technologies Cat#01700) following the manufacturer’s guidelines to label the ALDHhi populations. Tumor cells
were then isolated and incubated with anti-EpCAM-PE and anti-CD44-APC (1:100; BD PharMingen Cat#559942) for 30 min at room
temperature. ALDHhiCD44+EpCAM+ CSCs were sorted by a FACSVantage SE (Beckton Dickson). To isolate CSCs from HNSCC cell
e4

 lines, cells were stained with ALDHEFLUOR assay kit, followed by incubation of anti-CD44-APC. Sorting results were analyzed with
FlowJo software (https://www.flowjo.com).
Limiting-dilution assay and orthotopic HNSCC
For limit-dilution transplantation in nude mice, different numbers of FACS-sorted cells (EpCAM+/Tomato+ or EpCAM+/Tomato–) from
mouse primary tumors were mixed with Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into nude mice. For orthotopic nude mouse model of
HNSCC, EpCAM+/Tomato+ and EpCAM+/Tomato– cells from mouse primary tumors were injected submucosally into tongues of
nude mice. For orthotopic xenograft model of human HNSCC, sorted human CSCs (1 3 104 cells in 50 ml PBS) from human HNSCC
cell lines or primary tumors were submucosally inoculated into the tongues of nude mice (8 mice per group). Human HNSCC primary
tissues were obtained from the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. Tissues were digested into single cell suspension for sorting.
Tumorsphere formation assays
For tumorsphere formation assays, FACS-sorted cells were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates at a density of 100-500 cells/well.
Cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#11330-032) supplemented with 1% B27 supplement
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#17504044), 1% N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#17502048), penicillin-streptomycin
(100 mg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#15140122), human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/ml; R&D Systems
Cat#236-EG-01M), and human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 10 ng/ml; R&D Systems Cat#233-FB-025/CF),
in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37�C. Fresh aliquots of EGF and bFGF were added every 2 days, and the serum-free media
were changed every other day until the spheres formed. For passaging, tumorspheres were collected by centrifugation and disso-
ciated with trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#R001100) to obtain single cells. Cells were then re-suspended in sphere cul-
ture media after removing serum. Spheres with a diameter over 40 mm were counted 1-2 weeks after plating.
siRNA knockdown and retroviral transduction
Human HNSCC cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. For transient knockdown of BMI1 or FOSL1, 10 nM siRNA
or control siRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) was transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Cat#13778150) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Two siRNA targeting sequences for BMI1 are: 50-CAAGCAGAAATGCATC
GAA-30 and 50-CCAGACCACTACTGAATAT-30. Two siRNA targeting sequences for FOSL1 are: 50-CACCATGAGTGGCAGTCAG-30
and 50-GCATCAACACCATGAGTGG-30. The control siRNA sequence is: 50-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-30.
For viral transduction, retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of pQCXIH-HA-FOSL1 with packaging plasmids into
HEK293T cells as described previously (Ding et al., 2013). To stably express FOSL1 in SCC cells, we transduced SCC cells with ret-
roviruses expressing HA-FOSL1 or the control empty vector and subsequently selected cells with antibiotics.
Western Blotting
Cells were lysed using the radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich Cat#R0278). Protein extracts were run on a
10% or 15%SDS polyacrylamide gel before being transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked
with 5% milk for 1 hr and incubated with primary antibodies overnight, followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies for
2 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-Bmi-1 (1:1,000; Abcam Cat#sc-10745), anti-caspase-3
(1: 1,000; Cell Signaling Cat#ab2302), anti-caspase-9 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Cat#9502), anti-uH2A (1:2000, Millipore
Cat#05-678), and anti-a-tubulin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich Cat#T9026). The immunocomplexes were detected using the Clarity
Western ECL kit (Bio-Rad Cat#1705060).
RNaseq and Real-time RT-PCR
Quality of the RNA for sequencing was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Library preparation using the KAPA RNA-Seq
Library Preparation Kits (KAPA Biosystems Cat#07960140001) was performed at UCLA sequencing core facilities, and RNAs were
single-end sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 3000 machines. Alignment of reads was done using Tophat with the mm10 build of the
mouse genome (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml). Transcript assembly and differential expression was determined
using Cufflinks with Refseq mRNAs to guide assembly. Analysis of RNA-seq data was done using the cummeRbund package in
R (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/). The heatmap was generated with Heatmap Builder (http://ashleylab.stanford.edu/
tools/tools-scripts.html). Transcripts regulated both greater than and less than 2-fold were used in GO term and KEGG pathway anal-
ysis to find enriched functional annotations.
For Real-time RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#15596026), and 1 mg of RNA
was used for the RT reaction with random primer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#48190011), dNTP mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Cat#18427013), and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs Cat#M0253L). Quantification of mRNA was determined
using a SYBRGreen supermix (Bio-Rad Cat#1708880). Relative expression levels of the indicated genes were compared with
GAPDH expression using the 2DDct method.
Statistical analyses
Numerical data and histograms were expressed as the mean ± SD. Statistical parameters of the analyses are reported in the Fig-
ure Legends. All in vitro experiments were repeated at least twice, and in vivo experiments were repeated at least once. Data shown

 are either a single representative or combined from independent experiments. Two-tailed Student’s t test was performed between
two groups and a difference was considered statistically significant with p < 0.05 (n = 12, Figure 2). For comparison of dysplasia and
SCC number in two different mouse groups, the differences were assessed using two-way ANOVA (n = 9 to 14; Figure 3). For com-
parison of cisplatin, PTC-209, or 3-PA treatment, the differences were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s HSD
post hoc tests to minimize type I errors (n = 8, Figure 7D). For both one-way and two-way ANOVA analyses, Shapiro-Wilk test was
used to confirm normal distribution of data and that all data met the assumptions of no significant outliers. For HNSCC invasion
grades, the Cochran-Armitage test was performed (n = 9 to 14, Figure 3G). For percentage of mice with positive lymph node metas-
tasis, Fisher’s exact test was performed (n = 8, Figure 7F). Limiting dilutions were calculated using the Extreme Limiting Dilution Anal-
ysis software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/). p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 100 human HNSCC samples,
including HNSCC without metastasis (n = 31), HNSCC with lymph node metastasis (n = 33), lymph node metastases (n = 33), were
used in this study, and the parameters for scores was reported in Figure legends (Figure S6B). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was
applied to test the significant differences in IHC staining intensity between different groups (Figure S6B). The Pearson correlation
coefficient of liner regression was used to determine the correlation between different proteins (Table S2). All statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS software.
