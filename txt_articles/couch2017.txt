IMPORTANCE Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to an increased
lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, the relevance of germline variants in other genes from
multigene hereditary cancer testing panels is not well defined.
OBJECTIVE To determine the risks of breast cancer associated with germline variants in
cancer predisposition genes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A study population of 65 057 patients with breast
cancer receiving germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes with hereditary
cancer multigene panels. Associations between pathogenic variants in non-BRCA1 and
non-BRCA2 predisposition genes and breast cancer risk were estimated in a case-control
analysis of patients with breast cancer and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference
controls. The women underwent testing between March 15, 2012, and June 30, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Breast cancer risk conferred by pathogenic variants in
non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 predisposition genes.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for the 65 057 women included in the analysis was
48.5 (11.1) years. The frequency of pathogenic variants in 21 panel genes identified in 41 611
consecutively tested white women with breast cancer was estimated at 10.2%. After
exclusion of BRCA1, BRCA2, and syndromic breast cancer genes (CDH1, PTEN, and TP53),
observed pathogenic variants in 5 of 16 genes were associated with high or moderately
increased risks of breast cancer: ATM (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.22-3.62), BARD1 (OR, 2.16; 95% CI,
1.31-3.63), CHEK2 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67), PALB2 (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 5.12-11.19), and
RAD51D (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.21-7.88). Conversely, variants in the BRIP1 and RAD51C ovarian
cancer risk genes; the MRE11A, RAD50, and NBN MRN complex genes; the MLH1 and PMS2
mismatch repair genes; and NF1 were not associated with increased risks of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study establishes several panel genes as high- and
moderate-risk breast cancer genes and provides estimates of breast cancer risk associated
with pathogenic variants in these genes among individuals qualifying for clinical genetic
testing.

R
ecent improvements in DNA sequencing technology
have led to the development of multigene panels for
clinical genetic testing of several conditions. In par-
ticular, panels targeting genes implicated in cancer suscepti-
bility have increased the likelihood of detecting cancer-
predisposing variants and offer advantages in time and cost
compared with single gene testing.1-3 A broad range of cancer
susceptibility panels are available from genetic testing
laboratories.1,4-6 These include high-penetrance BRCA1 and
BRCA2breastandovariancancergenes;mismatchrepairgenes;
high-penetrance CDH1, PTEN, STK11, and TP53 genes that are
associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer as well as
Cowden disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni
syndrome, respectively; and genes associated with moderate
risks of breast cancer (2-fold to 5-fold), such as CHEK2 and
ATM.7,8 Patients with pathogenic variants in any of these genes
are eligible for increased surveillance for cancer or other pre-
ventive measures. Cancer gene testing panels identify vari-
ants in substantial proportions of patients.1,4,6 However, the
frequency of variants in each of the panel genes among indi-
viduals qualifying for clinical genetic testing remains to be de-
fined, and the risks of breast and other cancers associated with
variants in many panel genes are not established. In this study,
we report on the risks of breast cancer associated with inacti-
vatingvariantsinthesegenesidentifiedbyclinicalgenetictest-
ing of patients with breast cancer by 1 laboratory.
Methods
Study Population
Study participants included a nationwide sample of 65 057
women with breast cancer referred for hereditary cancer ge-
netic testing by Ambry Genetics Inc between March 15, 2012,
and June 30, 2016. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for the
65 057 women included in the analysis was 48.5 (11.1) years.
Demographic, clinical history, and family history of cancer in-
formation (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement) were col-
lected from test requisition forms, clinic notes, and pedigrees
provided by ordering clinicians at the time of testing. Infor-
mation was collected on current age, personal history, and age
at diagnosis of all cancers, ancestry, tumor pathology, family
history of cancer with cancer type, and age at diagnosis among
relatives. The study was approved by the solutions institu-
tional review board, which also determined that this study was
exempt from consent requirements.
Phenotype Data
A potential limitation of this study is the quality and quantity
of the clinical history information collected for the panel-
tested patients. The variant frequencies and breast cancer risk
estimates from this study were derived from probands and
were not dependent on family history information. To assess
data quality, a review of a random sample of 1200 breast and
ovarian cancer patient intake forms was conducted. Of these,
520 (43.3%) forms had additional clinical history documen-
tation available. The accuracy of personal cancer history was
greater than 97% (eMethods in the Supplement).
Multigene Panel Testing
Mutationtestingwasperformedbytargetedcustomcaptureand
sequencing and targeted chromosomal microarray analysis
(eMethods in the Supplement).1 Results from germline genetic
testing of 21 known and candidate breast cancer predisposi-
tion genes from custom capture sequencing panels (Breast-
Next, OvaNext, PancNext, CancerNext, CancerNext-
Expanded, ColoNext, BRCAplus, BRCAplus-Expanded, and
GYNplus; all Ambry Genetics Inc) (eTable 3 in the Supplement)
were included in this study. A 5-tier variant classification sys-
tem (eTable 4 in the Supplement)9 was applied to all altera-
tions. All variants identified by Ambry Genetics Inc are submit-
ted to the ClinVar public database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/clinvar/).
Normalization of Breast Cancer Cases and Controls
Among 65 057 patients with breast cancer who underwent
testing, 64 405 were women. Patients tested between July
and December 2015 were excluded because of incomplete
abstraction of sequential patient records, resulting in 58 798
eligible consecutive breast cancer cases. Of these, 41 611
self-identified as white or Ashkenazi Jewish (subsequently
referred to as white) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Restrict-
ing inclusion to patients with breast cancer as the first can-
cer diagnosis and applying filters for matching with Exome
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) controls, as described
below, yielded 54 585 patients with breast cancer of all eth-
nicities and 38 326 white patients (eFigure in the Supple-
ment). The non-Finn European (NFE) population in the
ExAC data set,10 excluding The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) exomes, were used as reference controls for case-
control association studies, consistent with the effective
use of this data set for estimation of ovarian and prostate
cancer risks in recent studies.11,12 ExAC variants in the PASS
and non-PASS category were defined as having Genome
Analysis Tool Kit Variant Quality Score Recalibration sensi-
tivity of 99.6% and 95% sensitivity, respectively (http://exac
.broadinstitute.org/terms).AlthoughmostExACvariantsinthis
analysis were in the PASS category, several non-PASS variants
alsodetectedbyAmbryGeneticsIncwereincludedintheExAC
reference data to avoid inflation of gene-specific breast cancer
Key Points
Question Which genes on hereditary cancer multigene testing
panels are associated with high or moderate risks of breast cancer
among patients qualifying for clinical genetic testing?
Findings In a case-control study of 65 057 patients with breast
cancer, inherited pathogenic variants in PALB2 were associated
with high risks of breast cancer, and variants in CHEK2, ATM,
BARD1, and RAD51D were associated with moderate risks of breast
cancer. Variants in MRE11A, RAD50, NBN, BRIP1, RAD51C, MLH1, and
NF1 were not associated with increased risks of breast cancer.
Meaning Although pathogenic variants in several panel genes
confer increased risks of breast cancer and may qualify patients for
increased cancer surveillance, variants in several other cancer
panel genes may not predispose to breast cancer.

risks.Allremainingloss-of-functionvariantsandanymissense
variants (defined as pathogenic in ClinVar by clinical
laboratories) in breast cancer cases and ExAC controls were
selected for analysis. Filtering steps were applied (eMethods
in the Supplement) to normalize differences in the breast
cancer cases and ExAC controls. Variants with minor allele
frequency greater than 0.3% other than common founder
mutations were excluded (eTable 5 and eMethods in the
Supplement). All suspected mosaic somatic variants (allele
ratio >70:30) and truncating variants in the last 55 base
pairs of the penultimate exon or last exon that potentially
avoid nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay and do not
influence known functional domains were excluded. Large
genomic rearrangements of 1 or more exons were excluded
because rearrangements were not validated among refer-
ence controls. (eFigure in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Associations between pooled pathogenic variants in each gene
(eTable 6 in the Supplement) and phenotypic characteristics
of breast cancer cases were assessed using the Fisher exact
test. Associations with age at diagnosis were estimated
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The observed fre-
quency of all pathogenic variants within each gene was
compared between white patients with breast cancer and
ExAC-NFE non-TCGA reference controls. Strength of asso-
ciations with breast cancer was estimated by odds ratios
(ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs based on the Fisher exact
test (Table; eTable 7 in the Supplement). P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. Genes were categorized as high
risk (OR, >5.0), moderate risk (OR, 2.0-5.0), or no clinical
relevance (OR, <2.0). A series of sensitivity analyses were
performed for truncating variants only; cases with patho-
genic variants in more than 1 gene; BreastNext-tested cases;
all ethnicities combined; and ExAC-NFE nonTCGA PASS ref-
erence controls; exclusion of cases with prior testing of
BRCA1 (GenBank, NM_007294.3) and BRCA2 (GenBank,
NM_000059.3); exclusion of ductal carcinoma in situ; and
exclusion of cases with a personal or family history of ovar-
ian or colorectal cancer (eTables 8-17 in the Supplement).
Results
Characteristics of Study Population
Clinical and phenotypic characteristics of 121 197 patients
subjected to multigene testing, including 65 057 (53.7%) indi-
viduals with breast cancer, are reported in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. Among the patients with breast cancer, 38 844
(59.7%) developed breast cancer at age 50 years or younger,
and 8851 (13.6%) had bilateral disease. Most patients with
breast cancer reported a family history of breast cancer
(39 878 [61.3%]), colorectal cancer (14 959 [23.0%]), or ovar-
ian cancer (8589 [13.2%]) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Of the
remaining patients not reporting any family history of breast,
ovarian, colorectal, or pancreatic cancer (8599 [13.2%]), 7320
(85.1%) developed breast cancer at 50 years or younger or
reported bilateral or triple-negative disease.
Variants Identified by Panel Testing
The frequencies of pathogenic variants in each of the 21
genes were estimated among the 58 798 eligible consecutive
women with breast cancer, including 41 611 white patients.
Because a subset of patients was not tested for all genes, the
frequencies of pathogenic variants from each of the 21 genes
were combined to estimate the overall frequency of patho-
genic variation. Thus, the combined frequency of pathogenic
variants among 41 611 white women with breast cancer was
10.2% (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Exclusion of BRCA1,
BRCA2, and the common lower-risk p.Ile157Thr and
p.Ser428Phe CHEK2 (GenBank, NM_007194.3) founder vari-
ants yielded a variant frequency of 6.18%. The most com-
monly mutated non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 genes among
white women with breast cancer were CHEK2 (1.73%), ATM
(GenBank, NM_000051.3) (1.06%), and PALB2 (GenBank,
NM_024675.3) (0.87%) (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Phenotypic Associations With Pathogenic Variants
To assess associations between pathogenic variants in non-
BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 predisposition genes and phenotypic
characteristics of patients, we restricted analyses to the
54 585 patients with breast cancer of all ethnicities and
38 326 white patients eligible for association analyses
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Among white patients, patho-
genic variants in CHEK2 (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12-1.63;
P = 2.00 × 10−4), PALB2 (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.09-2.05; P = .01),
and TP53 (GenBank, NM_000546.5) (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.26-
4.65; P = .007) were associated with bilateral breast cancer,
whereas variants in BRIP1 (GenBank, NM_032043.2) (OR,
5.22; 95% CI, 1.99-12.67; P = .004) and MSH2 (GenBank,
NM_000251.2), (OR, 18.44; 95% CI, 3.98-77.80; P = .001)
were associated with a personal history of ovarian cancer.
Only PALB2 variants were associated (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15-
2.19; P = .004) with a family history (1st- or 2nd-degree rela-
tives) of breast cancer. In contrast, BRIP1 (OR, 2.42; 95% CI,
1.41-4.13; P = .002), RAD51C (GenBank, NM_058216.2) (OR,
2.89; 95% CI, 1.26-6.45; P = .01), and TP53 (OR, 14.58; 95%
CI, 3.02-103.47; P = .001) were associated with family his-
tory of ovarian cancer. Only patients with breast cancer with
pathogenic variants in CHEK2 (age, 47.7 vs 49.7 years;
P = .003) and TP53 (age, 37.1 vs 49.4 years; P < .001) had a
significantly younger age at diagnosis than did noncarriers.
Breast Cancer Case-Control Association Analysis
Associations between pooled pathogenic variants in 16 panel
genes and breast cancer were assessed using sequencing
results from 38 326 white patients with breast cancer and
26 911 ExAC-NFE non-TCGA controls (Figure). Pathogenic
variants in PALB2 were associated with high breast cancer
risk (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 5.12-11.19; P = 4.3 × 10−38) (Table), con-
sistent with segregation studies of high-risk families.13-15
CHEK2 c.1100delC (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.88-2.85;
P = 3.04 × 10−17), pathogenic variants in CHEK2 (OR, 2.26;
95% CI, 1.89-2.72; P = 1.75 × 10−20) after exclusion of the
lower-risk p.Ile157Thr and p.Ser428Phe founder variants,
and pathogenic variants in ATM (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.22-3.62;
P = 2.4 × 10−19) were associated with moderate risks (OR, 2-5)

of breast cancer (Table) consistent with results from a recent
review of established predisposition genes.5
Several other genes were also associated with increased
risks of breast cancer. Pathogenic variants in BARD1 (Gen-
Bank, NM_000465.3) (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.31-3.63;
P = 2.26 × 10−3) and RAD51D (GenBank, NM_002878.3) (OR,
3.07; 95%, CI 1.21-7.88; P = .01) were significantly associated
with moderate risks (Table), whereas MSH6 (GenBank,
NM_000179.2) (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.16-3.27; P = .01) was only
marginally below the moderate-risk threshold (OR, ≥2)
(Table). Variants in both MSH2 and CDKN2A (GenBank,
NM_000249.3) yielded moderate effects, but both associa-
tions were nonsignificant due to limited numbers of variants
in cases and controls (Table). BRIP1 mutations conferred only
a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (OR, 1.63; 95% CI,
1.11-2.41; P = .01), consistent with results from a case-control
study involving familial cases (relative risk [RR], 2.0; 95% CI,
1.3-3.0; P = .01).16 Similarly, RAD51C, NF1 (GenBank,
NM_000267.3), and the MRN complex genes NBN (GenBank,
NM_002485.4), MRE11A (GenBank, NM_005591.3), and
RAD50 (GenBank, NM_005732.3) were not associated with
increased breast cancer risks (Table).17 Associations between
pooled pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, and the CDH1
(GenBank, NM_004360.4), PTEN (NM_000314.6), and TP53
syndromic genes were also assessed (eTable 7 in the Supple-
ment). However, the attenuated risks associated with BRCA1
and BRCA2 pathogenic variants resulting from an enrichment
of the cohort for patients who previously tested negative for
these genes must be interpreted with care. Similarly, risk esti-
mates for CDH1, PTEN, and TP53 were based on very small
numbers of patients with pathogenic variants and may also
be influenced by limited ascertainment of patients with the
associated clinical syndromes. None of the 23 patients with
CDH1 pathogenic variants reported a personal history of gas-
tric cancer.
A series of sensitivity analyses were also performed to
assess the influence of various subsets of patients with breast
cancer and ExAC control selection on the associations with
breast cancer. Effect sizes of associations were consistently
inflated for the 16 genes when using ExAC-NFE non-TCGA

PASS reference controls instead of PASS/non-PASS controls
(eTable 8 in the Supplement). For example, BARD1 variants
showed effects ranging from ORs of 2.16 to 3.18, and PALB2
variants ranged from ORs of 7.46 to 8.66 (Table and eTable 8
in the Supplement). Associations for each gene were also
estimated after exclusion of patients with breast cancer
reporting prior testing for BRCA1, BRCA2, or multigene pan-
els. Results were consistent with those from the primary
analysis (eTable 9 in the Supplement). In addition, a sensi-
tivity analysis of patients tested only by the BreastNext
panel was conducted to assess whether combining results
from multiple panels that did not always contain the full
complement of genes influenced the combined allele fre-
quencies and the estimated risks of breast cancer. Only
minor changes in risk estimates were observed (eTable 13 in
the Supplement).
Sensitivity analyses were also conducted when restrict-
ing analysis to pathogenic protein-truncating variants (eTable
10 in the Supplement), excluding ductal carcinoma in situ
(eTable 11 in the Supplement), and including patients with
pathogenic variants in multiple genes (eTable 12 in the Supple-
ment). Results for each gene were highly consistent across all
of these analyses. In contrast, no associations with breast
cancer were observed for the mismatch repair genes when
excluding all patients with personal and family history of ovar-
ian and/or colorectal cancer (eTables 14-16 in the Supple-
ment). Similarly, associations between pathogenic variants in
RAD51D were attenuated when including patients of all eth-
nicities and ExAC non-TCGA PASS reference controls due to
recurrent variants in the South East Asian reference popula-
tion (eTable 17 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We present results from multigene panel–based clinical test-
ing for pathogenic variants in inherited cancer genes among
65 057 patients with breast cancer. Pathogenic variants in 21
panel genes were identified in 10.2% of white women with
breast cancer and in 6.2% of women with breast cancer after
exclusion of BRCA1 and BRCA2. These findings were some-
what consistent with the 3.8%,6 3.9%,17 and 4.6%18 variant fre-
quencies from other studies of breast cancer cases enriched
for a family history of breast and/or other cancers.
This study provides insight into genes with pathogenic
variants that predispose to moderate and high risks of breast
cancer. In total, 5 of 16 non-BRCA1/2, nonsyndromic panel
genes were significantly associated with moderate or high
(OR, >2) breast cancer risk in the white population (PALB2,
ATM, CHEK2, BARD1, and RAD51D). PALB2 was confirmed as
a high-risk breast cancer gene (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 5.12-11.19) in
this testing population, consistent with a cumulative lifetime
risk of up to 58% for breast cancer from family segregation
studies.13 We also confirmed that CHEK2 and ATM are associ-
atedwithincreasedbreastcancerrisk.5Severalstratifiedanaly-
ses of the patients with breast cancer and the ExAC reference
controls in this study also provided consistent results. These
findings provide further support for the National Comprehen-
sive Cancer Network recommendations, version 1.2017 (http:
//www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines
.asp#detection) for management of treatment for patients with
pathogenic ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 variants.
WeestablishthatpathogenicvariantsinBARD1andRAD51D
are associated with moderately increased risks of breast can-
cer. Because pathogenic variants in these genes are rare (<1 in
500 in patients with breast cancer), previous studies had in-
sufficient numbers of breast cancer cases and controls to ad-
equately assess the influence of pathogenic variants in these
genes on breast cancer risk.5 This was possible only by using
more than 25 000 patients with breast cancer and reference
controls in this study. Additional studies of patients with
BARD1 and RAD51D variants are now needed to better under-
stand the related breast cancer phenotypes. Furthermore,
MSH6 pathogenic variants were associated with near-
moderate risks (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.16-3.27) of breast cancer,
contrary to a previous study suggesting little influence of
mismatch repair gene mutations on breast cancer risk.19
However, excluding patients with breast cancer who had a
personal or family history of colorectal cancer removed all
evidence of an influence on breast cancer. Family-based seg-
regation studies will be needed to determine whether vari-
ants in this gene have no influence on breast cancer risk or
predispose to complex phenotypes involving breast and colo-
rectal cancer. Additional studies of the influence of CDKN2A
and MSH2 on breast cancer are also needed following the
observation that pathogenic variants in these genes may be
associated with moderate breast cancer risk.
Of equal importance, however, are the findings that patho-
genic variants in NF1, BRIP1, RAD51C, the MLH1 (GenBank,
NM_000249.3) and PMS2 (GenBank, NM_000535.6) mis-
match repair genes, and the MRE11A, RAD50, and NBN MRN
complex genes did not confer any appreciable risks of breast
cancer. Although the BRIP1 ovarian cancer gene was associ-
ated with modestly increased risk of breast cancer overall (OR,
1.63; 95% CI, 1.11-2.41), exclusion of cases with a personal or
family history of ovarian cancer to account in part for com-
peting risks of cancer substantially reduced the risks of breast
cancer (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.81-1.99) to effect sizes observed for
the BRIP1 p.Arg798Ter variant (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.58-2.03)
in other large case-control studies.20 In contrast, the results
for NBN differed from those in a large study of the Slavic
founder variant (c.657del5) that associated the variant with a
moderate risk of breast cancer (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9-3.7).21 Like-
wise, pathogenic variants in NF1 among patients with neuro-
fibromatosishavebeenassociatedwithmoderaterisksofbreast
cancer (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1-3.2),22,23 whereas we failed to ob-
serveanyinfluenceonbreastcancerrisk.Thus,additionalstud-
ies of the influence of NF1 pathogenic variants on breast can-
cer risk in individuals with and without neurofibromatosis are
needed. In contrast, results demonstrating no increased risk
for breast cancer for pathogenic variants in RAD51C, MLH1,
PMS2, RAD50, MRE11A, and NBN were consistent across all
stratified analyses, suggesting that these genes may not be rel-
evant in clinical testing for breast cancer risk. However, it re-
mains to be determined whether specific missense variants in
these genes influence risk.

We acknowledge the limitations of the public reference
data set; however, extensive data cleaning and filtering were
used in an effort to normalize the breast cancer cases and con-
trol data.
Limitations
This study was focused on patients qualifying for clinical ge-
netic testing and was not a population-based study. In addi-
tion, associations between pathogenic variants in panel genes
andbreastcancerwereevaluatedusingsequencingresultsfrom
breast cancer cases and the database of ExAC reference
samples. The use of results from unmatched cases and con-
trols that were sequenced on different platforms could have
caused inflation of ORs for breast cancer. This limitation could
be addressed in the future using combined case-control stud-
ies matched on age and race. However, when considering
sequence quality, variant allele frequency, race, and ethnic-
ity, and excluding known cancer samples, the ExAC-NFE non-
TCGA data set offered a reasonable approximation of white
population-basedallelefrequencies.24ExACcontrolshavebeen
used to identify genes that predispose to ovarian and pros-
tate cancer,11,12 to exclude other genes from involvement in
these cancers, and to approximate risks associated with vari-
ants when comparing ExAC data with variants detected on
otherplatforms.12Similarly,ExACdatahavebeenusedtoevalu-
ategenesassociatedwithincreasedcardiovascularrisk.25Thus,
although variants in ExAC and ovarian or prostate cancer cases
were derived from different sequencing platforms and were
identified using different algorithms, the studies success-
fully identified genes associated with increased risks.
Conclusions
We present breast cancer risk estimates in a clinical, multi-
gene panel testing cohort as useful indicators of the clinical
relevance of pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibil-
ity genes. The breast cancer cases qualifying for clinical ge-
netic testing were enriched for a clinical history of early-
onset, bilateral, and triple-negative breast disease and a family
history of breast cancer. Therefore, the risk estimates derived
in this study are likely to be inflated over estimates from
population-based studies, as previously reported for PALB2
pathogenic variants from high-risk families.13 Although the
risks presented herein may not be generalizable to all muta-
tion carriers, they are highly relevant to those with clinical
histories suggestive of hereditary breast cancer predisposi-
tion. Future studies involving patients with breast cancer
unselected for age at diagnosis, tumor pathology, and family
cancer history and incorporating a broader range of altera-
tions in addition to segregation studies in families are needed
to further inform breast cancer risks for mutation carriers.
