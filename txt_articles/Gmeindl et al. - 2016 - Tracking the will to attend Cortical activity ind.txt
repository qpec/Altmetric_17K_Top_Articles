Abstract The neural substrates of volition have long tanta-
lized philosophers and scientists. Over the past few decades,
researchers have employed increasingly sophisticated technol-
ogy to investigate this issue, but many studies have been lim-
ited considerably by their reliance on intrusive experimental
procedures (e.g., abrupt instructional cues), measures of brain
activity contaminated by overt behavior, or introspective self-
report techniques of questionable validity. Here, we used
multivoxel pattern time-course analysis of functional magnet-
ic resonance imaging data to index voluntary, covert percep-
tual acts—shifts of visuospatial attention—in the absence of
instructional cues, overt behavioral indices, and self-report.
We found that these self-generated, voluntary attention shifts
were time-locked to activity in the medial superior parietal
lobule, supporting the hypothesis that this brain region is en-
gaged in voluntary attentional reconfiguration. Self-generated
attention shifts were also time-locked to activity in the basal
ganglia, a novel finding that motivates further research into
the role of the basal ganglia in acts of volition. Remarkably,
prior to self-generated shifts of attention, we observed early
and selective increases in the activation of medial frontal (dor-
sal anterior cingulate) and lateral prefrontal (right middle fron-
tal gyrus) cortex—activity that likely reflects processing
related to the intention or preparation to reorient attention.
These findings, which extend recent evidence on freely cho-
sen motor movements, suggest that dorsal anterior cingulate
and lateral prefrontal cortices play key roles in both overt and
covert acts of volition, and may constitute core components of
a brain network underlying the will to attend.

Humans have a highly developed ability to attend voluntarily
to some stimuli while ignoring others—an ability that sup-
ports a spectrum of behavior, from searching for objects in a
cluttered environment to multitasking and problem solving.
Impaired performance arising from diminished attentional
control is associated with aging, neurological diseases and
disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and
substance abuse. Yet, fundamental questions about how the
brain implements voluntary control of attention persist.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
have indicated that the medial superior parietal lobule
(mSPL), a component of the dorsal attention network
(Corbetta & Shulman, 2002), is activated during shifts of at-
tention between spatial locations (Greenberg, Esterman,
Wilson, Serences, & Yantis, 2010; Kelley, Serences,
Giesbrecht, & Yantis, 2008; Vandenberghe, Gitelman,
Parrish, & Mesulam, 2001; Yantis et al., 2002), features
(Greenberg, Esterman, Wilson, Serences, & Yantis, 2010;
Liu, Slotnick, Serences, & Yantis, 2003), objects (Serences,
Schwarzbach, Courtney, Golay, & Yantis, 2004), sensory mo-
dalities (Shomstein & Yantis, 2004), task sets (Chiu & Yantis,
2009), and working memory representations (Tamber-
Rosenau, Esterman, Chiu, & Yantis, 2011). However, in these
and other studies (Hopfinger, Camblin, & Parks, 2010; Taylor,
Leon Gmeindl and Yu-Chin Chiu contributed equally to this work.

 Rushworth, & Nobre, 2008), participants were presented with
instructional cues indicating when to shift attention, or they
were required to report when they had voluntarily shifted at-
tention by making a motor response. These methods introduce
at least two substantial challenges regarding analysis and in-
terpretation: First, external cues and behavioral responses
evoke their own patterns of neural activity that somehow must
be dissociated from the activity associated with the intention
or preparation to perform an action. Second, initiating osten-
sibly voluntary actions in response to external cues is not
purely voluntary; rather, it is partly stimulus-driven. It is there-
fore unclear whether or under what circumstances the ob-
served activity in mSPL reflects a purely voluntary orienting
of attention, or instead involves the anticipation and subse-
quent processing of an external instruction (e.g., processes
involved in cue interpretation and stimulus–response
mapping).
Here we introduce a novel method to track attention in the
absence of both external cues and overt behavior, allowing us
to isolate the neural mechanisms engaged in self-generated,
voluntary shifts of attention. Participants were instructed to fix
their gaze on a central fixation stimulus while covertly attend-
ing alternately to one of two locations throughout a continu-
ous multistream rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task
(Fig. 1). In the Buncued^ condition, participants were further
instructed to shift attention voluntarily (without moving their
eyes) roughly three or four times per minute; they were not
required to execute these shifts at any particular times during
the task, and no instructional cues were used to evoke atten-
tion shifts. Furthermore, participants did not indicate explicitly
(e.g., by motor response or retrospective report; Hopfinger,
Camblin, & Parks, 2010; Lau, Rogers, & Passingham, 2006;
Libet, Gleason, Wright, & Pearl, 1983) their intention or de-
cision to shift attention, the time at which the shift occurred, or
the location to which they shifted attention. Instead, we
exploited the fact that attention to different spatial locations
evokes systematically distinct patterns of brain activity in vi-
sual cortex. This activity was used to track the focus of atten-
tion over time.
Specifically, we first trained a multivoxel pattern analysis
(MVPA) classifier to distinguish the visual cortex activity as-
sociated with covert attention to left versus right locations by
using the fMRI data from a separate Bcued^ condition, in
which participants occasionally were cued to attend to the left
or the right location, thus eliciting cued shifts of attention on a
subset of trials (Fig. 1). In the cued condition, participants
were instructed to shift attention only when the cues were
presented. The classifier trained on data from the cued condi-
tion was then was applied to the fMRI data from the uncued
condition, thereby tracking the focus of attention on a
moment-by-moment basis. At each time point, the partici-
pant’s attention was classified as being oriented to the left or
to the right location. We then demarcated time points when the
activation patterns indicated a transition from a leftward to a
rightward focus of attention, or vice versa. These temporal
markers of attention shifts were then employed in subsequent
analyses to identify the neural mechanisms engaged for self-
generated shifts of attention.
Furthermore, we analyzed the time course of activity in
some brain regions that were engaged for both uncued and
cued shifts of attention, to test whether there was an earlier
increase in activity in these regions prior to self-generated
shifts of attention—an increase that should reflect the prepa-
ration or intention (i.e., the will) to shift attention.
Method
Ethics statement
All experimental procedures were approved by the Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutional Review Board. All participants
passed an fMRI safety screening prior to the scan and provid-
ed written informed consent.
Participants
Twelve neurologically intact, right-handed, healthy adults
(seven females, five males; mean age = 26, SE = 1.9 years)
were recruited from the Johns Hopkins University communi-
ty. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Each participant completed one behavioral training session
and one 2-h scanning session, on separate days. They were
paid $10/h for the behavioral training session and $25/h for
the scanning session.
Apparatus
In the training session, visual stimuli were presented on an 18-
in. CRT monitor located 79 cm in front of a chinrest, used to
equate visual angles across participants, and buttonpress re-
sponses were made on a computer keyboard. In the fMRI
session, the visual stimuli were projected onto a screen placed
at the end of the magnet bore and viewed with a mirror
mounted above the head coil. Each participant was fitted with
a custom-molded dental impression block clamped to the head
coil cage, to minimize head motion; buttonpress responses
were made on a custom-built MR-compatible response box.
Stimulus presentation and behavioral data collection were
controlled by custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) code
using the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997). Eye posi-
tion was monitored with a closed-circuit video system during
the practice session, and with a custom MR-compatible infra-
red camera (MRA, Inc.) and ViewPoint 2.8.3 eyetracking soft-
ware (Arrington Research, Inc.) during the fMRI session.

 Stimuli and procedures
Participants were instructed to fix their gaze on a white central
fixation dot 0.2° in diameter while performing a multistream
RSVP task (Fig. 1). Task-relevant alphanumeric RSVP
streams were located 3.5° to the left and right of the fixation
dot along the horizontal meridian. Each of these two relevant
streams was flanked 3.3° (center to center) above, below, and
laterally by three irrelevant distractor streams in order to max-
imize the demand for selective attention. The alphanumeric
characters subtended 1.4° in height and 1.0° in width and were
presented in fixed-width Monaco font (letters in uppercase).
Participants were instructed to make four-alternative
buttonpress responses to infrequent target digits embedded
within the task-relevant RSVP streams. Simultaneously, a dig-
it from 2 to 5 was presented in one stream and a different digit
from 2 to 5 was presented in the other stream. Participants
pressed the right index-, middle-, ring-, or little-finger button
to indicate the identity of the digit (2, 3, 4, or 5, respectively)
presented in the currently attended RSVP stream. The filler
(nontarget) items consisted of the letters A through Z, except
for L and R (see below). All visual stimuli were presented on a
gray background, and each target and filler item was rendered
in one of eight randomly chosen colors (excluding red), with
the constraint that every item within the same RSVP frame
was rendered in a different color. The stimulus duration (i.e.,
RSVP frame duration) was 133.3 ms, and targets were infre-
quent, appearing on average two or three times per minute.
The stimuli requiring motor responses were rare and included
only to ensure that the participants remained vigilant.
Each fMRI scanning run consisted of one trial block of the
cued condition and one trial block of the uncued condition
(see below). Block order was counterbalanced across runs
and across participants, and printed instructions (Bred cues^
or Bself-paced^) indicating the relevant condition were pre-
sented immediately prior to each block. Each run lasted
410.2 s (189.1 s per block), including an initial 12-s fixation
period, as well as a 20-s fixation period inserted between the
two blocks. Each participant completed ten runs in the fMRI
session, conducted at the F. M. Kirby Research Center for
Functional Brain Imaging in Baltimore, Maryland.
In the cued condition, participants occasionally were
instructed either to shift attention to the other task-relevant
RSVP stream or to maintain attention (Bhold^) on the current
stream. Shift and hold instructions were conveyed by the let-
ters L and R rendered in bright red, which appeared unpredict-
ably within the currently relevant stream. When an R appeared
in the left stream, participants were to shift attention to the
right stream; in contrast, when an L appeared in the left
stream, participants were to maintain attention to the left
stream—L and R signaled the reverse instructions when pre-
sented in the right stream. Only the shift and hold cues were
rendered in bright red, so that participants could easily dis-
criminate cues from the other stimuli; this discriminability was
verified during the practice session. The onset asynchrony
between critical events (i.e., the presentation of a cue or a
target) in the cued condition varied randomly among 5.067,
6.000, 7.067, 8.000, 9.067, or 10.000 s. Approximately half of
the cues were shift cues, and approximately half were hold
cues. A variable number of hold cues were presented between
Fig. 1 Task. Two task-relevant streams of characters (immediately to the
left and right of a central fixation) were flanked by task-irrelevant streams.
In the cued-attention condition (illustrated here), uniquely red stimuli (L
and R, corresponding to left and right, respectively) cued participants
either to shift attention to the other stream (e.g., an R cue appearing in
the left stream) or to hold attention on the currently relevant stream (e.g.,
an R cue appearing in the right stream). Participants indicated the identity
of targets (digits) that appeared within the currently attended stream. In
the uncued-attention condition, the cues were omitted; participants were
to shift attention between the relevant streams occasionally and at will. In
both conditions, digits occurred only rarely, and they appeared
simultaneously in both the left and right streams

 successive shift cues (resulting in unpredictable cue se-
quences), and, of particular importance, the mean onset asyn-
chrony between shift cues was 19.8 s (observed asynchrony
range = 5.067–44.267 s, between-participants SD = 1.5 s).
Targets were always separated from cues by a minimum onset
asynchrony of 5.067 s.
In the uncued condition, the shift and hold cues were omit-
ted (replaced by filler letters). Instead, participants were
instructed to shift attention voluntarily from one task-
relevant stream to the other a few (roughly three or four) times
each minute, and to respond to targets appearing within the
currently attended (relevant) stream just as they had responded
in the cued condition. Participants were not required to shift
attention at any particular times in the uncued condition. A
previous study (Gmeindl, Gao, Yantis, & Courtney, 2008)
employing a very similar design, but one in which buttonpress
responses were used to verify the accurate timing of the
indexed attention shifts, indicated that with these instructions
participants shifted attention between the left and right RSVP
streams every 21.1 s on average (SE = 2.3 s).
Prior to the fMRI session, each participant completed a
training session in our laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University. Throughout the training session, the RSVP stimu-
lus frame duration was incrementally decreased from 400 to
133.3 ms, a rate at which participants were able to maintain an
accuracy in the cued condition of at least 80 % correct across
two successive blocks. In the practice session, accuracy feed-
back was provided at the end of each block. In the fMRI
session, the RSVP stimulus frame duration was fixed at
133.3 ms and accuracy feedback was omitted.
Imaging procedures
Data acquisition Functional MRI data were acquired with a
Philips Intera 3-T scanner and an eight-channel SENSE head
coil (MRI Devices). High-resolution, whole-brain anatomical
volumes were acquired with an MPRAGE T1-weighted se-
quence yielding 200 1-mm coronal slices (1 × 1 mm in-plane
resolution, matrix = 256 × 256, TE = 3.7 ms, TR = 8.1 ms, flip
angle = 8°). Whole-brain functional volumes were acquired
with a T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging sequence yielding
30 2.5-mm axial slices (1-mm gap, 2.5 × 2.5 mm in-plane
resolution, matrix = 76 × 76, TE = 30 ms, TR = 1.5 s, flip
angle = 70°). Eight subsequently discarded volumes were col-
lected at the beginning of each run to allow magnetization to
reach a steady state prior to task presentation.
Imaging data preprocessing The functional MRI data were
preprocessed using the BrainVoyager QX software, version
1.10 (Brain Innovation). The data from each run were
corrected for slice-time acquisition and motion, and then tem-
porally high-pass filtered (three cycles per run). To correct for
between-run motion, each participant’s functional volumes
were all coregistered to his or her high-resolution anatomical
volume. Voxels were resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm. No other
spatial smoothing or normalization was performed. After pre-
processing, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
time course was extracted from each voxel for each run. The
BOLD amplitude at each time point (i.e., the functional vol-
ume, or TR) was transformed into a z score with respect to the
mean and standard deviation of the voxel’s time course for
that run, and then entered into MATLAB for the MVPA (see
below). To conduct the Cued-Shift > Cued-Hold contrast re-
ported below, each participant’s anatomical and functional
volumes were transformed into Talairach space using a
rigid-body transformation. Then, for each participant, a gen-
eral linear model of the cued-attention data was formed. This
model included regressors for shift cues, hold cues, and targets
that were each created by convolving a single-gamma hemo-
dynamic response function with Kronecker delta (stick) func-
tions that marked the onsets of the corresponding events; head
movements in the x, y, and z dimensions were included as
regressors of no interest. A standard group-level analysis
(one-sample t test) was then performed on the results of a
Cued-Shift > Cued-Hold contrast, with statistical maps being
corrected for multiple comparisons by applying a cluster-size
threshold [voxel-wise p < .001, t(11) = 3.5, corrected α = .05].
Multivoxel pattern analysis1 For each participant, we first
used data from only the cued condition to train an MVPA
classifier (linear support vector machine LIBSVM; Chang &
Lin, 2011; www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm) to distinguish
between the patterns of activity associated with sustained
attention to the left versus the right RSVP stream. These
were relatively long epochs (up to 44.3 s) during which
1 For researchers who want to use participants brain activity to track the
focus of attention—but without implementing MVPA—it is worth noting
that in a preliminary study we used an alternative method that likewise
revealed activation in mSPL, right middle frontal gyrus, and dorsal ante-
rior cingulate cortex related to uncued, self-generated shifts of attention.
Briefly, for each participant we (1) extracted the BOLD time courses from
regions that were found to be reliably activated (or deactivated), accord-
ing to an Attend Left > Attend Right whole-brain contrast performed on
the data from the cued condition; (2) at each time point (TR), computed
the ratio of mean BOLD signals between (striate and extrastriate) regions
that were reliably more active for Attend Left epochs versus those that
were reliably more active for Attend Right epochs; (3) computed the first
derivative of this ratio; (4) optimized a velocity (i.e., change in ratio over
time) threshold used to demarcate cued attention shifts, such that it max-
imized hits (i.e., identifying high-velocity deflections in the BOLD ratio
following presentation of the shift cues) and minimized false alarms; and
(5) applied this optimized velocity threshold to the BOLD-ratio time
course observed for these same regions in the uncued condition, thereby
indexing self-generated shift-time points. These time points could then be
used to create event-related average time courses as in the primary meth-
od reported above. Also, it may be noted that essentially the same
methods, both MVPA-based and the alternative method above, could be
used to track attention to some nonspatial stimulus features and objects
(e.g., faces vs. scenes).

 participants had been cued to attend to the RSVP stream on
the left (Attend Left) or the right (Attend Right) of fixation.
We trained the classifier on these Attend Left and Attend
Right epochs using multivoxel patterns recorded from 7.5 s
after the onset of the corresponding epoch (to account for the
hemodynamic response lag) to 1.5 s after the offset of the
corresponding epoch, with each constituent time point (i.e.,
TR) treated as a training sample. The MVPA was conducted
first using all voxels within a whole-brain mask (ventricles
excluded) created separately for each participant in the native
anatomical space. The number of voxels in the mask ranged
from 41,608 to 50,314 across participants (M = 47,525). A
standard leave-one-run-out cross-validation procedure was
used to evaluate classification accuracy. This initial whole-
brain MVPA provided a set of weights (one per voxel), for
each participant, that indicated how much information each
voxel contributed to the correct classification. To select those
voxels that were most informative, we ranked all of the voxels
according to the absolute values of their weights and then
repeated the cross-validation procedure with increasingly larg-
er subsets (1, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, etc.) of the most informative
voxels. Classification accuracy, averaged across participants,
varied approximately as an inverted-U function of the number
of voxels included in the MVPA, with a peak mean accuracy
at 3,000 voxels. Therefore, we selected for each participant the
3,000 most informative voxels and trained a new, optimized
classifier on the cued-condition data from these 3,000 voxels
(no run left out).
This optimized classifier was then applied to the data from
the uncued condition, resulting in a multivoxel pattern time
course (MVPTC; Chiu, Esterman, Gmeindl, & Yantis, 2012;
see also Greenberg et al., 2010) that indicated, for each time
point, the degree to which the pattern of activity across the 3,
000 voxels corresponded to the patterns associated with
Attend Left versus Attend Right. The MVPTC was temporally
smoothed by averaging the MVPTC value at each time point
with the MVPTC values for the subsequent two time points,
and then the MVPTC was binarized. The time points at which
the classification reversed (i.e., shifting from left to right or
vice versa) were demarcated as attention-shift points.
To verify that the MVPTC could be used to reliably index
attention shifts, we used a leave-one-run-out cross-validation
procedure in which, for each participant, we iteratively left
out the data from one run of the cued condition (e.g., Run 1)
and trained the classifier using the rest of the data from the
cued condition (e.g., Runs 2–10). For each run left out, we
then compared the onsets of attention shifts indexed by the
MVPTC to the actual onsets of the shift cues. If the onset of
an indexed attention shift fell within three TRs (i.e., 4.5 s, to
account for hemodynamic response lag) of the onset of a
shift cue, we considered this a hit. Across participants, the
mean hit rate was 87.6 % (SE = 2.3 %). The false-alarm rate,
as defined by the three-TR threshold, was comparatively low
(M = 34.3 %, SE = 5.1 %) and may reflect that attention
likely did fluctuate occasionally during performance
(resulting, e.g., in missed targets). The hit rate was signifi-
cantly higher than the false-alarm rate [t(11) = 7.29, p <
.001], indicating that the MVPTC reliably indexed attention
shifts across participants and across runs within each scan-
ning session.
A priori regions of interest A recent study (Chiu et al., 2012)
using a novel MVPTC analysis revealed that two cortical re-
gions—right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) and dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC)—and one subcortical cluster in the
basal ganglia (BG) demonstrated functional connectivity with
the mSPL during cued shifts of attention. Furthermore, rMFG
and dACC had also been implicated in our preliminary study
(Gmeindl et al., 2008), in which participants engaged in
uncued attention shifts during a similar task, but one in which
buttonpress responses were used to verify the timing of the
demarcated attention shifts. Of particular interest, that study
indicated that rMFG and dACC were activated reliably more
for self-generated than for cue-driven shifts. On the basis of
these findings, we therefore included in the present study
rMFG, dACC, and BG a priori regions of interest (ROIs;
Table 1) that were functionally defined on the basis of the data
from Chiu et al. (2012), and we tested for increased prepara-
tory processing in these regions prior to self-generated shifts
of attention.
Event-related average time-course analysis To test the di-
rectional hypothesis that self-generated attention shifts are as-
sociated with earlier rises in activity within the a priori ROIs
(Table 1) than are cued attention shifts, we performed an
event-related time-course analysis (Serences, 2004).
We first extracted time courses from the mSPL, rMFG,
dACC, and BG regions (see Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 2) by
calculating the mean BOLD amplitude across all voxels with-
in the region for each time point, covering 12 s centered on the
uncued-shift time point identified by the MVPA classifier (i.e.,
from 6.0 s before to 6.0 s after the uncued-shift time point).

 BOLD amplitudes were then transformed to percent signal
changes, relative to the mean BOLD amplitude calculated
within the region across the run.
Note that because the MVPA classifier, although op-
timized, was associated with some degree of error in
classification, resulting in a smoothing of the distribu-
tion of the demarcated shift points, we also computed
event-related average BOLD time courses for cued shifts
of attention using the same algorithm. This was
achieved by time-locking the BOLD signal to demarcat-
ed cued-shift points based on the output from the clas-
sifier when it was applied to the data from the cued-
attention condition (using a leave-one-run-out proce-
dure), rather than by time-locking to the actual onsets
of the shift cues. Importantly, this method incorporates
classifier error for the demarcation of both types of
shifts (and avoids the need to correct for hemodynamic
response lag at this stage), therefore allowing for a more
appropriate and direct comparison between the uncued-
shift and cued-shift event-related averages.
Finally, we performed a single planned contrast (i.e., the
interaction between shift condition and time, one-tailed, α =
.05, N = 12) on the event-related averages for each of these
ROIs. Post-hoc tests of simple main effects were conducted
following evidence for a reliable shift condition × time inter-
action; the statistical threshold for these post-hoc tests was
Bonferroni-corrected (α = .025).

 Results
Behavioral performance
In the cued condition of the fMRI session, response accuracy
was 75.6 % correct on average (SE = 4.1 %). Note that chance-
level accuracy of responses would have been only 25 % cor-
rect. Most of the errors that participants made were misses
(i.e., failures to respond to the presence of a target; M =
18.6 %, SE = 3.3 %) rather than incorrect buttonpresses (M
= 5.8 %, SE = 1.0 %). These results suggest that participants
rarely, if ever, were attending to the wrong RSVP stream when
responding to a target (otherwise, the rate of incorrect
buttonpresses would have been comparatively high), consis-
tent with the fact that the shift and hold cues (see the Method
section) were uniquely colored (bright red), whereas the tar-
gets were not salient and required focused attention. In the
uncued condition of the fMRI session, participants similarly
missed 16.1 % of targets on average (SE = 3.4 %); there was
no reliable difference in miss rates between the two condi-
tions, F(1, 11) = 1.57, p > .1. Note that because in the uncued
condition participants were free to attend to either RSVP
stream and two different targets were presented simultaneous-
ly, response accuracy could not be calculated to enable a direct
comparison across the task conditions. However, the classifier
trained on data from the cued condition enabled us to predict
participants’ behavioral responses in the uncued condition
with much greater than chance accuracy. Specifically, because
attention could be classified as being directed toward the left
or the right target at the time of target onset, this classification,
together with the identity of the corresponding target, led to a
prediction of the specific buttonpress that the participant
would make. For example, if attention was classified as being
directed toward the left target, which was the digit 4, then it
was predicted that the participant would press the button cor-
responding to 4, rather than a button corresponding to the
other possible targets: 2, 3, or 5. Using this simple binary
classification, we correctly predicted participants’ responses
to 62.1 % of the targets, on average (whereas chance accuracy
would be only 25 % correct).
Frequency of attention shifts in the cued condition
In the cued condition, the mean onset asynchrony between
shift cues was 19.8 s (SD = 1.5 s; see the Method section).
We first validated the classifier’s ability to demarcate attention
shifts within the cued condition. As expected, the MVPA
model produced a mean onset asynchrony between the
indexed cued shifts of attention of 18.49 s (SD = 0.8 s), which
is within one TR of the actual shift-cue onset asynchrony. This
result confirms that the classifier trained to discriminate
Attend Left from Attend Right epochs during the cued condi-
tion was highly accurate in demarcating the transitions in
attention between left and right locations (i.e., attention shifts)
in the cued condition for the test (left-out) runs. When the
MVPA model was then applied to the data from the uncued
condition, it produced a similar mean onset asynchrony be-
tween demarcated shifts of attention of 18.45 s (SD = 0.9 s),
which is consistent with the instructions given to participants
(i.e., to shift attention roughly three or four times per minute).
Neural mechanisms for self-generated, voluntary shifts
of attention
We first replicated the primary finding of previous studies
(Kelley et al., 2008; Yantis et al., 2002) that the mSPL was
transiently active during cue-driven shifts of attention: A
whole-brain Cued-Shift > Cued-Hold contrast (Table 2)
yielded a suprathreshold cluster that was centered in left
mSPL but extending into the right mSPL (Fig. 2A). We next
extracted the event-related average time courses from this
cluster, time-locked to the uncued attention shifts that were
demarcated by the MVPA model. Transient activation in
mSPL was revealed for uncued shifts [main effect of time:
F(8, 88) = 8.05, p < .001], indicating that mSPL was engaged
for both self-generated and cue-driven shifts of attention
(Fig. 2A). An additional cluster in the left inferior parietal
lobule (Table 2) that survived the whole-brain Cued-Shift >
Cued-Hold contrast also clearly demonstrated transient acti-
vation time-locked to the demarcated uncued attention shifts
[F(8, 88) = 3.13, p = .004], indicating that this region, like
mSPL, was engaged for both self-generated and cue-driven
shifts of attention. None of the remaining clusters in Table 2
exhibited reliable increases in activity time-locked to the
uncued shifts of attention.
Within the rMFG (Fig. 2B), we found a reliable interaction
between time and type of attention shift [F(8, 88) = 1.79, p =
.04], potentially consistent with the hypothesis that self-
generated shifts are associated with earlier rises in activity
than are cue-driven shifts. Post-hoc tests of the simple main
effects indicated that rMFG was transiently activated for
uncued shifts [F(8, 88) = 3.48, p = .002], and although there
appeared to be a trend for transient rMFG activity time-locked
to the cued shifts, this effect was not reliable [F(8, 88) = 1.05,
p = .40]. Similarly, within the dACC (Fig. 2C), a reliable
interaction emerged between time and type of attention shift
[F(8, 88) = 5.70, p < .001], potentially consistent with the
hypothesis that self-generated shifts are associated with earlier
rises in activity than are cue-driven shifts. Post-hoc tests of the
simple main effects indicated that dACC was transiently acti-
vated for uncued shifts [F(8, 88) = 6.87, p < .001], but not for
cued shifts [F(8, 88) = 1.12, p = .36].
Within the BG ROI (Fig. 2D), we observed transient acti-
vation time-locked to demarcated uncued shifts [effect of time
on percent signal change: F(8, 88) = 4.04, p < .001]. The
transient activation in the BG ROI time-locked to cued shifts
2182
Atten Percept Psychophys (2016) 78:2176–2184
 was not reliable [F(8, 88) = 1.47, p = .18]. The corresponding
interaction approached statistical significance [F(8, 88) =
1.83, p = .08]. These results warrant the conclusion that the
BG (left caudate nucleus and putamen) are transiently en-
gaged for self-generated shifts of attention, but whether they
are differentially engaged for cue-driven shifts of attention
remains to be determined.
Discussion
Our first result of note is that mSPL is engaged not only for
cue-driven shifts of attention, but also for self-generated shifts
of attention. This finding was revealed by employing a novel
method to identify self-generated, voluntary attention shifts
occurring in the absence of instructional cues or overt re-
sponses that might otherwise have had confounding influ-
ences. Briefly, we first trained a classifier to discriminate
multivoxel patterns of brain activity recorded following the
presentation of instructional cues to attend to the left or the
right location, over sustained epochs. We then applied this
trained classifier to independent sets of data acquired while
the participants freely shifted their attention between the two
locations, to classify on a moment-by-moment basis each par-
ticipant’s focus of attention as being oriented to the left or the
right location. Finally, we demarcated the time points at which
the classifier indicated a leftward or a rightward shift of atten-
tion. During these uncued, self-generated shifts of attention,
mSPL was transiently active (Fig. 2A), consistent with the
hypothesis that it plays a role in reconfiguring attention. This
finding also disconfirms the hypothesis that mSPL activation
during cued shifts of attention merely reflects the processing
of an external instruction to shift attention or the need to make
an overt response.
In addition, we found that rMFG activity increased prior to
self-generated attention shifts, and it increased earlier than the
activity associated with cue-driven attention shifts (Fig. 2B).
This finding suggests that rMFG participates in the prepara-
tion to reorient attention, much like premotor cortex partici-
pates in the preparation of overt movements (Wise, 1985). We
also observed an early increase in dACC activity that was
associated with self-generated, but not cue-driven, attention
shifts (Fig. 2C). This result echoes evidence that medial fron-
tal cortex participates in initiating or preparing self-generated,
rather than externally triggered, overt actions such as hand
movements (Krieghoff, Brass, Prinz, & Waszak, 2009;
Passingham, Bengtsson, & Lau, 2010; Soon, Brass, Heinze,
& Haynes, 2008). Together, these findings suggest that medial
frontal cortex activity reflects a common locus of early-stage
processing that gives rise to self-generated behavior, including
both overt action and covert orienting of attention. We suggest
that the dACC and rMFG are core components of the brain
network underlying the will to act.
One might note that both of the a priori ROIs that demon-
strated greater activity for self-generated than for cued shifts
of attention prior to the demarcated attention shifts (rMFG and
dACC) were regions that had been identified in an earlier
study (Chiu et al., 2012) as being involved in cued shifts of
attention. The evidence that these regions are involved in cued
shifts of attention, however, was revealed in the earlier study
only by MVPTC functional connectivity analyses, not by
standard voxel-wise magnitude analyses. The present study
indicates that, prior to the demarcated attention shifts, there
is an increase in the magnitude of activation of these regions
for self-generated shifts that is not observed reliably for cued
shifts of attention, consistent with the earlier study. Chiu et al.
also uncovered, via an MVPTC functional connectivity anal-
ysis, reliable activity in the BG related to cued shifts of atten-
tion that a standard method was unable to detect. The BG
constitute a subcortical component within a network of func-
tionally connected brain regions engaged for cue-driven shifts
of attention (Chiu et al., 2012; Gitelman et al., 1999; Grande
et al., 2006; Perry & Zeki, 2000; Shulman et al., 2009). In the
present study, the BG (including clusters in the left caudate
nucleus and putamen) exhibited transient activity related to
self-generated attention shifts (Fig. 2D), a new finding that
suggests a role of the BG in covert acts of volition.
Together, the results of this and previous studies indicate that
magnitude of activation, functional connectivity, and
multivoxel patterns of activity may each reveal different roles
of brain regions in both cued and self-generated shifts of at-
tention, and they suggest that future studies should provide
direct comparisons between these types of data to tease apart
the roles of brain regions in different acts of attention.
In summary, our study introduces a novel approach to the
investigation of willed behavior and cognition that monitors
participants’ ongoing brain activity, in the absence of instruc-
tional cues and overt responses, to index covert acts of voli-
tion—in this case, self-generated, voluntary shifts of visuo-
spatial attention. This method revealed that mSPL, which
was previously implicated in cue-driven shifts of attention,
is also engaged in self-generated shifts of attention, a finding
consistent with its hypothesized role in the reconfiguration of
competitive interactions within sensory cortex (Yantis et al.,
2002). Of particular note, regions in medial frontal and lateral
prefrontal cortex (dACC, rMFG) exhibited early and selec-
tive increases in activation prior to self-generated shifts of
attention. Activity within these regions likely reflects pro-
cessing related to the intention or preparation to reorient at-
tention. These results extend findings from investigations of
other domains of cognitive control (e.g., Kühn et al., 2009;
Schel et al., 2014). For example, a recent study (Schel et al.,
2014) showed that whereas some brain regions were in-
volved in both self-generated and cue-driven forms of re-
sponse inhibition, self-generated inhibition additionally in-
volved medial prefrontal cortex (Schel et al., 2014). The

 present results also extend the findings of other studies (Soon
et al., 2008) that have investigated freely chosen overt ac-
tions such as hand movements. Thus, our study provides
critical new evidence for the core neural mechanisms under-
lying willed behavior in nonmotoric domains. It furthermore
demonstrates the feasibility of an analysis method that can be
adapted to investigate other domains of cognition (e.g., per-
ceptual decision making and social judgments) that otherwise
may be difficult or impossible to index in the absence of
instructional cues or overt responses.
