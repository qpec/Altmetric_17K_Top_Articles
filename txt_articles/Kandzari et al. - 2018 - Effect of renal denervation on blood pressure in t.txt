SUMMARY    
29 
BACKGROUND: Previous catheter-based renal denervation studies reported variable efficacy 
30 
results. Our study evaluated the effect of renal denervation on blood pressure (BP) in the 
31 
presence of specified anti-hypertensive medications and assessment of adherence.  
32 
METHODS: SPYRAL HTN-ON MED is a multicentre, international, blinded, randomised, 
33 
sham control, proof-of-concept trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02439775). Patients were enrolled at 
34 
25 centres worldwide. Eligible patients were on one to three anti-hypertensive medications with 
35 
stable doses for at least six weeks. Patients with an office systolic BP (SBP) ≥150 mmHg and 
36 
<180 mmHg, a diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mmHg and a 24-hour ambulatory SBP ≥140 mmHg and 
37 
<170 mmHg at second screening underwent renal angiography and were randomised to renal 
38 
denervation with the Symplicity SpyralTM multielectrode catheter or sham control. Patients, 
39 
caregivers, and those assessing BP were blinded to randomisation assignments. The primary 
40 
endpoint, change in 24-hour blood pressure at six months, was compared between groups. Drug 
41 
surveillance was used to assess medication adherence. The primary analysis was done in the 
42 
intention-to-treat population. Safety events were assessed through six months.   
43 
FINDINGS: Eighty patients were randomised and followed through six months. Office and 24-
44 
hour ambulatory BP decreased significantly from baseline to six months in the renal denervation 
45 
group (n=38). Mean baseline-adjusted treatment differences [95% confidence intervals] are: 24-
46 
hour SBP (-7·0 mmHg [-12·0, -2·1], p=0.0059), 24-hour DBP (-4·3 mmHg [-7·8, -0·8], 
47 
p=0.0174), office SBP (-6·6 mmHg [-12·4, -0·9], p=0.0250), and office DBP (-4·2 mmHg [-7·7, 
48 
-0·7], p=0.0190). Evaluation of hourly changes in 24-hour SBP and DBP showed BP reduction 
49 
throughout 24 hours for the renal denervation group. Three-month BP reductions were not 
50 
 4 
 
significantly different between groups. Medication adherence was ~60% and varied for 
51 
individual patients throughout the study. There were no major adverse events.  
52 
INTERPRETATION: Renal denervation in the main renal arteries and branches significantly 
53 
reduced BP compared to sham control with no major safety events. Incomplete medication 
54 
adherence was common.

INTRODUCTION 
58 
Against the background of preclinical and early human feasibility studies demonstrating 
59 
reductions in renal and systemic sympathetic tone with catheter-based renal denervation,1,2 
60 
subsequent trials of variable size, design and method have demonstrated inconsistent blood 
61 
pressure results in the setting of treatment resistant hypertension.3−5 More recently, as an 
62 
exploratory trial intended to verify biologic proof-of-concept in the absence of antihypertensive 
63 
therapy, the blinded, sham-controlled SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial demonstrated statistically 
64 
significant and meaningful blood pressure reductions in a hypertension population utilizing a 
65 
revised procedural method.6  
66 
 
Despite these promising results, uncertainty regarding the efficacy of renal denervation in 
67 
the setting of concurrent antihypertensive medications persists. Previous study of renal 
68 
denervation amidst prescribed antihypertensive therapy has been challenged by variability in 
69 
medication classes, frequent medication and dose changes and unpredictable patient adherence.7,8 
70 
although one of these trials, performed open label, did report a significant effect of renal 
71 
denervation compared with control in patients receiving antihypertensive medications.3 
72 
However, whether changes in blood pressure associated with this method of catheter-based 
73 
therapy are amplified or instead muted by pharmacotherapy is unstudied. Further, estimates 
74 
regarding the temporal pattern and magnitude of blood pressure change, and comparison of these 
75 
measures with those observed in the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial population are only 
76 
speculative.  
77 
 
In parallel with the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED study, a trial of similar design was 
78 
performed to evaluate the application of renal denervation in a setting more representative of 
79 
 6 
 
clinical practice for which integrating drug and procedural strategies may be anticipated. To this 
80 
purpose, the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study9 was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
81 
of catheter-based renal denervation for treatment of moderate, uncontrolled hypertension despite 
82 
ongoing therapy with commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications. 
83 
 
84 
METHODS 
85 
Trial design and patients 
86 
SPYRAL HTN-ON MED is a global, multicentre, blinded (patient and assessor), randomised, 
87 
sham-controlled, proof-of-concept trial. Details of the design have been reported (Appendix, 
88 
Figure S1).9 In brief, eligible patients were 20 to 80 years old with uncontrolled hypertension on 
89 
one, two, or three standard antihypertensive medications. Medications were required to be 
90 
prescribed at 50% or more of the maximum manufacturer’s recommended dosage of a thiazide-
91 
type diuretic, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, an ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor 
92 
blocker (ACE-I/ARB), or a beta blocker. In Japan, patients could be prescribed less than 50% of 
93 
maximum manufacturer’s recommended dosage of a thiazide-type diuretic per standard of care. 
94 
Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as office systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥150 and <180 
95 
mmHg, office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg, and a mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP 
96 
≥140 and <170 mmHg. Patients were enrolled at 25 centres in the USA, Germany, Japan, United 
97 
Kingdom, Australia, Austria, and Greece. The protocol was approved by all local ethics 
98 
committees and all patients provided written informed consent to participate in the trial. The trial 
99 
was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at 
100 
www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02439775 
101 
 7 
 
Screening and randomisation 
102 
The first screening visit was conducted to confirm that patients had been prescribed 
103 
antihypertensive pharmacotherapy without change in dose for a minimum of 6 weeks and met 
104 
the office blood pressure criteria for inclusion. During screening visit 2 patients knowingly 
105 
underwent drug screening to assess antihypertensive mediation adherence using tandem high 
106 
performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy of urine and plasma by an 
107 
independent laboratory.10 If office blood pressure, measured using an automatic blood pressure 
108 
monitor (Omron, see appendix), remained within the required range (SBP ≥150 mmHg and <180 
109 
mmHg and DBP ≥90 mmHg) patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
110 
(ABPM, Mobil-O-Graph; I.E.M GmbH, Stolberg, Germany). Before the ABPM was initiated, 
111 
study personnel documented pill identity and observed the patient swallowing their 
112 
antihypertensive medication(s) (directly observed therapy). Ambulatory blood pressure was 
113 
measured every 30 minutes. A minimum of 21 daytime (7:00 to 21:59) and 12 night-time (22:00 
114 
to 6:59) measurements were required for inclusion in the analysis. The ABPM could be repeated 
115 
once if the required number of readings was not reached or the average 24-hour SBP was 
116 
between 135-140 mmHg or between 170-175 mmHg. Patients who met all inclusion and 
117 
exclusion criteria at the second screening visit were scheduled for renal angiogram and, if 
118 
anatomical suitability was confirmed, proceeded to randomisation.  
119 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to renal denervation or sham procedure. Randomisation was 
120 
stratified by trial centre, using block randomisation with a block size of four. SAS-based 
121 
software was used to generate the lists of randomisation codes and participants were assigned to 
122 
an intervention by ICON plc via the website. 
123 
 
124

Procedure 
125 
Details of the renal denervation procedure were identical to those described in the SPYRAL 
126 
HTN-OFF MED trial.9 In brief, the Symplicity SpyralTM multielectrode renal denervation 
127 
catheter (Symplicity Spyral catheter, Medtronic, Galway, Ireland), and the Symplicity G3TM 
128 
renal denervation RF generator (Symplicity G3 generator) were used to provide circumferential 
129 
radiofrequency ablation treatments in a spiral pattern in the four quadrants of the renal artery and 
130 
branch vessels between three and eight mm in diameter. All cases were performed by 
131 
experienced proceduralists and proctored using detailed treatment plans.  
132 
The control group received a sham procedure consisting of only a renal angiogram and were 
133 
required to remain on the procedure table for at least 20 minutes with sensory masking post-
134 
angiogram to help prevent possible unblinding of randomisation allocation.  
135 
 
136 
Maintenance of blinding  
137 
Patients and selected trial staff were blinded to the randomisation allocation. During the 
138 
procedures (renal angiogram alone or followed by renal denervation) blinding was maintained by 
139 
the use of conscious sedation, blindfolding, music and patients’ lack of familiarity with the 
140 
procedures.  The blinded trial staff conducted all follow-up visits and the patient’s 
141 
referring/managing physicians were unaware of a patient’s treatment assignment. A blinding 
142 
assessment form was completed by patients and the blinded blood pressure assessors prior to 
143 
discharge and at three and six-month follow-up visits. In accordance with the study protocol, 
144 
blinding of patients and blood pressure assessors was maintained for up to 12 months after 
145 
randomisation.  
146 
 
147 
 9 
 
Follow-up 
148 
Patients returned for office follow-up visits at one, three and six-months post procedure. All 
149 
patients underwent urine and blood analysis to assess adherence to their prescribed medications 
150 
and staff witnessed patients taking their medication prior to the 24-hour ABPM at three and six 
151 
months. Adherence was defined as detectable levels of all prescribed antihypertensive 
152 
medications at each follow-up visit and includes cases in which an extra antihypertensive 
153 
medication was also detected. No antihypertensive medication changes were allowed through six 
154 
months unless the escape criteria were met (office SBP exceeded 180 mmHg or was below 115 
155 
mmHg with symptoms of hypotension). Blood chemistries, including sodium, potassium, 
156 
glucose and serum creatinine, were obtained at each follow-up visit as well. Estimated 
157 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the four variable Modification of Diet in 
158 
Renal Disease (MDRD) Formula or the local Japanese criteria for patients enrolled in Japan.11 
159 
Renal artery imaging using duplex ultrasound was performed at the six-month office visit. MRA, 
160 
CT or angiogram was suggested if the duplex ultrasound was deemed non-diagnostic.    
161 
  
162 
Efficacy endpoints 
163 
The key efficacy endpoint was the blood pressure change from baseline (measured at screening 
164 
visit two) based on ABPM measurements assessed at six months. This endpoint was based on the 
165 
prespecified requirement for patients to be maintained on the same specified antihypertensive 
166 
medication regimen through six-months follow-up. Office and 24-hour SBP and DBP were 
167 
measured at three and six months post randomisation. The change in office and 24-hour blood 
168 
pressure measurements were then compared between the two treatment groups.  
169 
 10 
 
Office and 24-hour heart rate change from baseline was assessed at six months. The rate pressure 
170 
product (RPP) was then calculated using 24-hour heart rate and SBP measurements as follows: 
171 
heart rate x SBP = RPP.12,13  
172 
 
173 
Safety endpoints 
174 
Safety endpoints included all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease, new renal artery stenosis 
175 
>70% (assessed at six months), any significant embolic event resulting in end-organ damage, 
176 
hospitalization for hypertensive crises not related to medication non-adherence, new myocardial 
177 
infarction, new stroke, renal artery re-intervention, major bleeding, major vascular 
178 
complications, dissections, perforations and increase in serum creatinine >50% from screening 
179 
assessment. End-stage renal disease is defined as two or more eGFR measurements <15 
180 
mL/min/1·73 m2 at least 21 days apart and requiring dialysis.  
181 
 
182 
Statistical analysis 
183 
Like the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial, the current proof-of-concept trial was designed in 
184 
collaboration with and approved by the U.S. FDA with consideration of the recommendations in 
185 
the 2014 Scientific Statement by the American Society of Hypertension14 and by a consortium of 
186 
investigators15−17 that suggested a phase two-type trial in hypertensive patients. Given the 
187 
uncertainty regarding the future role of renal denervation for management of hypertension after 
188 
the results of SYMPLICITY HTN-3 it was decided to proceed with two smaller proof-of-concept 
189 
trials that would minimize exposure of patients to an interventional procedure but have the 
190 
potential to establish sufficient evidence to justify moving to a larger, powered trial. The 
191 
 11 
 
SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED proof-of-concept trial has been published, and this report represents 
192 
the primary results of the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED trial.  The protocol allowed up to 110 
193 
patients to be randomised with prospectively planned interim analyses after 40, 60, and 80 
194 
patients completed at three follow up, respectively. Because the current study prespecified that 
195 
patients should be maintained on the same medication regimen through six-months follow-up, 
196 
analysis of the 80-patient cohort was then performed to assess the pattern and progression of 
197 
blood pressure change over time. The purpose of each interim analysis was to confirm the safety 
198 
of the procedure and determine if the blood pressure lowering effect of renal denervation was 
199 
sufficient to support design of future trials.   
200 
There are no powered endpoints in the trial. Statistical analyses were performed based on the 
201 
intention-to-treat principle. For patients meeting escape criteria, the last observation was carried 
202 
forward for the six-month blood pressure assessment. A modified intention-to-treat cohort 
203 
excluded patients who met escape criteria (SBP ≥180 mmHg or <115 mmHg with symptoms). A 
204 
per-protocol analysis was also performed which excluded patients meeting escape criteria, were 
205 
non-adherent with their baseline anti-hypertensive regimen and who had at least one non-
206 
standardised blood pressure assessment. Analysis ofCovariance (ANCOVA) was employed to 
207 
adjust for baseline blood pressure measurements. For specific daytime and night-time BP 
208 
measurements, daytime was defined as 7:00AM to 9:59 PM, and night-time defined as 10:00 PM 
209 
to 6:59 AM.  Individual sleep/wake times were used to compare hourly BP measurements 
210 
between patients where time zero was specified as wake time for patients who self-reported wake 
211 
times. If a patient did not report a wake time, they were assigned a waking time of 7:00AM. 
212 
Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations. Between group differences 
213 
and blood pressure differences from baseline to the three- and six-month follow-up assessment 
214 
 12 
 
were tested using unpaired and paired t-tests, respectively. Counts and percentages are presented 
215 
per treatment group for categorical variables; values were tested using the exact test for binary 
216 
variables and the chi-square test for multilevel categorical variables.  
217 
A blinding index was calculated from the completed blinding assessment forms at hospital 
218 
discharge and at three and six months to verify the effectiveness of blinding.10  
219 
Role of the funding source 
220 
The SPYRAL HTN-ON MED trial was funded by Medtronic. The executive committee designed 
221 
the protocol and identified clinical sites in collaboration with the funder. The funder was 
222 
responsible for collection, monitoring and analysis of the data. The manuscript was written by 
223 
the lead author with contributions from the executive committee and co-authors. The funder 
224 
assisted in figure and table generation, copy editing and formatting. The authors had unrestricted 
225 
access to the data and were responsible for the decision to submit for publication.   
226 
 
227 
RESULTS 
228 
Between July 2015 and September 2017, 467 patients were screened and enrolled. This analysis 
229 
presents results for the first 80 patients randomly assigned to renal denervation (n=38) and sham 
230 
control (n=42; Figure 1). Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between groups, except 
231 
there were more patients with obstructive sleep apnea in the sham control group (ten vs. two 
232 
patients, p=0·0277; Table 1). Mean baseline office and 24-hour SBP, DBP and heart rate were 
233 
similar between groups.  
234 
 
235 
 13 
 
There was no difference in the number of prescribed anti-hypertensive medication classes at 
236 
baseline between groups (2·2 ± 0·9 for renal denervation and 2·3 ± 0·8 for sham control, p=0·70; 
237 
Table 1). The proportion of patients in each treatment group prescribed 3 classes of 
238 
antihypertensive medications was also similar (52·6% in the renal denervation group and 52·4% 
239 
in the sham control group; p=1·00). Calcium channel blockers were prescribed in 71·1% of the 
240 
renal denervation group and 73·8% of the sham control group (p=0·81), ACE-I/ARB for 81·6% 
241 
and 83·3% (p=1·00), and diuretics for 57.9% and 59.5% (p=1.00).  Subject adherence to 
242 
prescribed medications was not consistent at different time points (Appendix Figure S2).  
243 
 
244 
 
245 
All patients underwent renal angiography and angiographic documentation of catheter position 
246 
for the renal denervation group was required.  During the procedure, a mean of 270·8 ± 101·6 cc 
247 
of contrast was used in the renal denervation group compared with 86·0 ± 50·0 cc in the sham 
248 
control group. For the renal denervation group, proceduralists performed an average of 45·9 ± 
249 
13·7 total ablations and treated an average of 2·3 ± 0·5 main arteries (19·3 ± 8·9 ablations) and 
250 
5·8 ± 2·2 branch vessels (26·6 ± 11·7 ablations; Appendix, Table S2).  
251 
 
252 
The blinding index was 0·78 (95% CI 0·70, 0·85) at discharge, 0·68 (0·57, 0·79) at 3 months and 
253 
0·64 (0·54, 0·74) at 6 months, indicative of effective blinding.18  
254 
 
255 
Adherence was similar between groups (at baseline, 65·8% for renal denervation and 59·5% for 
256 
sham control, p=0·65; at three months, 52·6% vs. 57·1%, p=0·82; at six months, 60·5% vs. 
257 
64·3%, p=0·82; Appendix Table S3). Anti-hypertensive medications not prescribed by 
258 
 14 
 
physicians were detected in 10-15% of patients at each time point. There were no significant 
259 
differences in baseline laboratory values or in six-month change in values between renal 
260 
denervation and sham control groups (Appendix, Table S4).   
261 
Changes in SBP and DBP from baseline to six months for both 24-hour ambulatory and office 
262 
measurements in the renal denervation and sham control groups are displayed in Figure 2 and 
263 
Table 2.  The change in blood pressure was significantly greater at six months for the renal 
264 
denervation group vs. sham control for office SBP (difference -6·8 mmHg [-12·5, -1·1], 
265 
p=0·0205), 24-hour SBP (difference -7·4 mmHg [-12·5, -2·3], p=0·0051), office DBP 
266 
(difference -3·5 mmHg [-7·0, -0·0], p=0·0478) and 24-hour DBP (difference -4·1 mmHg [-7·8, -
267 
0·4] p=0·0292). Individual changes in 24-hour and office BP at six months are displayed in 
268 
Appendix Figure S3. Comparison of changes in 24-hour blood pressure measurements at three 
269 
and six months for renal denervation and sham control groups is shown in Figure 3, where blood 
270 
pressure reduction for the renal denervation group was greater at six months compared to three 
271 
months. Three-month changes in office and 24-hour ambulatory BP are listed in Appendix Table 
272 
S5, and BP measurements at baseline and three and six months for all available patients in 
273 
Appendix Table S6. Hourly changes in ambulatory SBP and DBP for renal denervation and 
274 
sham control groups at baseline and six months are presented in Figure 4.

Six-month changes in 24-hour and office SBP and DBP in the two treatment groups for the 
276 
adherent patients and those incompletely or not adherent are shown in Appendix Figure S4. All 
277 
patients receiving renal denervation had a significant drop from baseline at six months but 
278 
between group differences are not significant in the adherent patients. The sham control response 
279 
was minimal in the incomplete/nonadherent group and 24-hour SBP was significantly different 
280 
between renal denervation and sham in these patients.  
281 
 15 
 
Comparison of six-month changes, adjusted for baseline measures using ANCOVA, also showed 
282 
significant differences, with a 24-hour SBP between group difference of -7.0 mmHg [-12·0, -
283 
2·1], p=0·0059 and 24-hour DBP between group difference of -4·3 mmHg [-7·8, -0·8], 
284 
p=0·0174.  Office SBP difference was -6·6 [-12·4, -0·9], p=0·0250 and office DBP difference 
285 
was -4·2 mmHg [-7·7, -0·7], p=0·0190 (Table 2).  Results for the modified ITT population 
286 
provided similar outcomes (Appendix, Table S7). The small number of patients in the per-
287 
protocol population (15 renal denervation and 14 control patients) limits comparison of 
288 
outcomes.   
289 
There was no significant difference in office or 24-hour heart rate at six months (Table 2). To 
290 
further explore the effect of renal denervation on heart rate and blood pressure the RPP was 
291 
analysed (appendix Figure S5). The hourly 24-hour RPP change at six months was lower in the 
292 
renal denervation patients at all time points. This consistent change over time was not observed 
293 
in the sham control group. 
294 
  
295 
Similar to reported results for SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED,6 there were no procedural or safety 
296 
events through six months follow up in SPYRAL HTN-ON MED (Appendix, Table S8).

DISCUSSION 
300 
In this trial designed to explore the safety and efficacy of catheter-based renal denervation in 
301 
moderate, uncontrolled hypertension despite specified antihypertensive therapy, the salient 
302 
findings of this study are: (1) in patients receiving medical therapy, renal denervation extending 
303 
into branch arteries was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions 
304 
 16 
 
in office and ambulatory measures compared with a sham procedure; (2) the extent of blood 
305 
pressure reduction with renal denervation increased over temporal follow-up through six months;  
306 
(3) no procedural- or intermediate-term adverse safety events associated with renal denervation 
307 
were observed; and (4) non-adherence to antihypertensive medications was common. These 
308 
promising results both encourage further study with this method of renal denervation for 
309 
persistent hypertension despite the prescription of medical therapy and inform the design and 
310 
conduct of subsequent trials.  
311 
 
Similar to the SPYRAL HTN OFF-MED study6 and unlike prior investigations of renal 
312 
denervation,3−5 the ON MED trial differs considerably regarding the patient population enrolled, 
313 
procedural method and restriction to selected antihypertensive medication classes. Regarding the 
314 
latter feature, antihypertensive therapy was limited to four pharmaceutical categories (ACE 
315 
inhibitors/ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and thiazide diuretics) routinely 
316 
prescribed in clinical practice in part to minimize potential confounding suggested in previous 
317 
studies.4,19  Further, enrolled patients had moderate, combined hypertension20 (mean office SBP 
318 
164·6 ± 7·1 mm Hg and DBP 99·9 ± 6·9 mm Hg) requiring up to three antihypertensive agents 
319 
in comparison, for example, with the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 study in which the mean office SBP 
320 
was 179·7 ± 16·1 mm Hg with no diastolic requirement in patients prescribed an average 5·1 
321 
medications. Also, like the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED study, renal denervation using a multi-
322 
electrode catheter that permitted simultaneous or sequential energy delivery to the main renal 
323 
arteries with extension into distal renal artery branches was performed to enable more complete, 
324 
circumferential ablative treatment based on an evolving understanding in renal nerve 
325 
anatomy1,21,22 and procedural technique.8  
326 
 17 
 
 
Investigation of renal denervation in the setting of concurrent medical therapy for 
327 
hypertension was necessary to better understand the role of device therapy in clinical indications 
328 
anticipated to be common in routine patient care. Specifically, in the treatment of difficult to 
329 
control hypertension, consideration of an interventional therapy may factor into the decision 
330 
process after patients have been prescribed guideline-recommended drug therapy11,23−25 that 
331 
commonly begins with one or two medications and may eventually include a third agent in more 
332 
difficult cases. By 24-hour ambulatory measurement at six months, average systolic and diastolic 
333 
blood pressure reductions were 9 and 6 mm Hg, respectively, with a corresponding similar 
334 
magnitude of decline in office systolic and diastolic measures. Importantly, the magnitude of 
335 
blood pressure decline is clinically significant, associated with lower rates of both cardiovascular 
336 
events and mortality in prior studies.26−28 Notably, the absolute reduction in 24-hour ABPM at 
337 
three months in this study was similar that observed in the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED study,6 
338 
despite greater variance in the sham control cohorts. Yet a progressive trend for the fall in blood 
339 
pressure was observed across all blood pressure measures in the renal denervation cohort 
340 
between three and six months raising the possibility that further time may be required to fully 
341 
realize the benefit of renal denervation therapy associated with resetting of systemic sympathetic 
342 
tone.  
343 
In comparison with office measurement that has been associated with greater 
344 
variability,29 24-hour ABPM demonstrated directionally consistent findings at three and six 
345 
months with progressive blood pressure decrease in the treatment group and in parallel, relatively 
346 
modest change in the control group. Compared with traditional office measurement changes, 
347 
variance in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure is less susceptible to measurement bias, placebo 
348 
effects, and day-to-day variability. This method provides more stable and reproducible blood 
349 
 18 
 
pressure values than office or random home measurements,30 and the ability to provide frequent, 
350 
serial blood pressure readings permits dynamic assessment over a time course that yields 
351 
prognostic relevance associated with reduced nocturnal blood pressure fall,31 increased short-
352 
term blood pressure variability32 and excessive morning blood pressure surge.33 In addition, 
353 
ambulatory blood pressure is also more strongly correlated with cardiovascular risk than office 
354 
measures,34,35 and the extent of ambulatory blood pressure reduction in the present study is 
355 
consistent with that deemed clinically meaningful by expert consensus.15,16  
356 
 
As another revision to trial conduct compared with most prior renal denervation studies, 
357 
inclusion of surveillance methods to objectively document protocol adherence was important to 
358 
interpreting results of an interventional therapy in the presence of prescribed pharmacologic 
359 
therapy.  Monitoring is informative given that imbalances in drug adherence between treatment 
360 
groups may either over- or underestimate the treatment effect observed with the experimental 
361 
therapy. Indeed, in both previous pharmacologic and renal denervation studies for hypertension, 
362 
medical adherence despite protocol mandate is largely unpredictable as it was not objectively 
363 
measured. Among contemporary studies involving renal denervation, for example, the 
364 
prevalence of medical non-adherence commonly approaches 50%, with 5% to 30% of patients 
365 
demonstrating complete absence of prescribed medical therapy by biochemical assay.36 For those 
366 
patients treated with a standardised antihypertensive regimen and randomised in open-label 
367 
fashion to renal denervation or control in the DENER HTN trial, only half of patients were fully 
368 
adherent to drug therapy by urine and blood analysis performed at six months.7 The present study 
369 
confirms observations regarding the frequency of medical non-adherence in hypertension trials 
370 
and also highlights the dynamic pattern and influences of patient behaviour in the context of 
371 
protocol mandate and pre-existing awareness of drug surveillance. Despite documentation of a 
372 
 19 
 
stable drug regimen for at least two months prior to randomisation and requirement of only 50% 
373 
maximal dose, adherence with prescribed medical therapy was approximately 60% with highly 
374 
variable individual patient adherence at all timepoints (Appendix, Figure S2). If the benefit of 
375 
renal denervation is proven consistent and durable in future study, a constant, ‘always on’ 
376 
treatment effect distinguishes it from pharmaceutical therapy reliant upon patient daily action 
377 
and complicated by intolerances, dosing frequency or other common issues that challenge 
378 
adherence. Further, the more constant reduction in sympathetic tone with renal denervation may 
379 
reduce variation in blood pressure control associated with pharmaceutical trough levels, 
380 
especially at early morning and evening levels. Supporting this premise, ambulatory readings 
381 
demonstrate persistent blood pressure suppression at all time points during the 24-hour period for 
382 
patients treated with renal denervation. Combining blood pressure with heart rate, 24-hour 
383 
lowering of the RPP may also support a more consistent reduction in sympathetic activity.   
384 
 
385 
 
Altogether, these results reaffirm the safety and efficacy of renal denervation observed in 
386 
previous trials but further extend our understanding in the context of medical therapy and with a 
387 
modified procedural technique. Nevertheless, limitations exist to the present study. As an 
388 
exploratory, proof-of-concept trial, the study did not prespecify a hypothesis for differences in 
389 
blood pressure measurements at any particular time interval. If the analyses were prespecified, 
390 
however, assuming a treatment difference of 7 ± 11 mm Hg between renal denervation and sham 
391 
control groups, and two-sided alpha level of 0·05, a sample size of 80 patients (40 per cohort) 
392 
would provide 80% statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment difference 
393 
between groups. Instead, the investigational plan included prospectively planned interim 
394 
analyses to ascertain whether an adequate treatment effect with acceptable reduction in blood 
395 
 20 
 
pressure variability in the control cohort could be achieved and therefore inform further study. 
396 
To this purpose, a particular limitation—and challenge for future investigation— relates to the 
397 
prevalence of medical non-adherence despite patient education and awareness of drug testing. 
398 
Although absence of detectable drug at a single timepoint implies more frequent non-adherence, 
399 
it is not predictable for a single patient at interval assessments, and increasing recognition of this 
400 
potential confounder as common among both pharmaceutical and device trials raises the question 
401 
whether such assays should be imposed as common practice in hypertension trials. In part related 
402 
to this issue, the present findings are suggestive of effect in both adherent and non-adherent 
403 
populations but cannot confirm the benefit of renal denervation among patients with higher drug 
404 
adherence given the small sample size. Nevertheless, the prevalence of both number of 
405 
medications and adherence were similar in both groups, and critically, as previously stated, 
406 
ambulatory blood pressure measurements were obtained only following witnessed pill ingestion 
407 
in all patients. For the same reasons related to size of the study population, the safety of renal 
408 
denervation involving main artery and branch treatment cannot be confirmed; however, the 
409 
absence of safety events through six months in the current study is consistent with none observed 
410 
at three months applying the same procedural method in the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial.6 
411 
Also, as in prior studies of renal denervation, there is no measure of effective renal nerve 
412 
ablation; however, the number of ablations per patient and procedural technique were similar to 
413 
those observed in the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial that demonstrated similar and significant 
414 
reductions in 24-hour blood pressure at three months using the same procedural method and 
415 
technology. In addition, the inclusion criteria in the protocol for number of required 
416 
antihypertensive medications was revised during enrollment to allow patients to be on up to three 
417 
medications, instead of exactly three, to facilitate enrollment. We did not assess sodium intake or 
418 
 21 
 
impose any restrictions on dietary or lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking), and these factors could have 
419 
influenced blood pressure measurements. Finally, the results observed with this therapy and in 
420 
this specific population may not be generalizable to more varied clinical populations and 
421 
alternative interventional therapies for hypertension or medication classes not represented in this 
422 
trial.  
423 
 
In conclusion, we found clinically and statistically significant greater reductions in blood 
424 
pressure six months post-renal denervation compared to the sham control group. Both main renal 
425 
arteries and branches were treated with no major safety events. Although patients were aware of 
426 
planned medication adherence assessments, roughly half the patients were not adherent to their 
427 
prescribed anti-hypertensive medication regimen.

Research in Context 
495 
Evidence before this study  
496 
We searched PubMed using the search terms “renal denervation”, “hypertension” and clinical 
497 
trial for papers published from November 1, 2012, to February 1, 2018. 34 clinical trial reports of 
498 
renal denervation for treatment of hypertension were identified, as well as 46 systematic reviews, 
499 
consensus statements, or meta-analyses published from Jan 1, 2015, to February 1, 2018. In 
500 
addition, a search for “renal denervation,” “hypertension” and “medication adherence” identified 
501 
25 clinical trial reports of renal denervation in the presence of medication adherence assessment.  
502 
 
503 
Added value of this study  
504 
This trial addresses the application of renal denervation in a setting representative of clinical 
505 
practice for which integrating drug and procedural strategies may be anticipated. Although not 
506 
powered for efficacy endpoints, renal denervation inpatients receiving medical therapy for moderate, 
507 
uncontrolled hypertension,  was safe and associated with significant and clinically relevant reductions in 
508 
blood pressure measures compared with a sham procedure. The temporal pattern of blood pressure 
509 
reduction with renal denervation is characterized with progressive reduction through six-month follow-up. 
510 
Frequent non-adherence to medical therapy informs the design and conduct of future trials. 
511 
 
512 
Implications of all the available evidence 
513 
The results of the proof of concept study reaffirm the safety and efficacy of renal denervation 
514 
observed in previous trials but further extend our understanding in the context of medical therapy 
515 
and with a modified procedural technique. The findings both encourage further study with this 
516 
 26 
 
method of renal denervation for persistent hypertension despite the prescription of medical therapy and 
517 
inform the design and conduct of subsequent trials.
