Prevalence, Severity, Exposures, and Treatment Patterns
of Tinnitus in the United States
Jay M. Bhatt, MD; Harrison W. Lin, MD; Neil Bhattacharyya, MD
IMPORTANCE Tinnitus is a common problem for millions of individuals and can cause
substantial negative effects on their quality of life. A large epidemiologic study of tinnitus and
its management patterns in the US adult population is lacking.
OBJECTIVES To quantify the epidemiologic features and effect of tinnitus and to analyze the
management of tinnitus in the United States relative to the 2014 American Academy of
Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) clinical practice guidelines.
DESIGN, METHODS, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional analysis of the representative
2007 National Health Interview Survey (raw data, 75 764 respondents) identified a weighted
national sample of adults (age, �18 years) who reported tinnitus in the preceding 12 months.
Data were collected in November 2014 at the University of California, Irvine, and Harvard
Medical School.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In addition to quantifying prevalence, severity, duration,
and regularity of tinnitus, specific data regarding noise exposure and tinnitus management
patterns during health care visits were analyzed.
RESULTS Among an estimated (SE) 222.1 (3.4) million US adults, 21.4 (3.4) million (9.6%
[0.3%]) experienced tinnitus in the past 12 months. Among those who reported tinnitus, 27%
had symptoms for longer than 15 years, and 36% had nearly constant symptoms. Higher rates
of tinnitus were reported in those with consistent exposure to loud noises at work (odds
ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.7) and during recreational time (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.3-2.9).
Years of work-related noise exposure correlated with increasing prevalence of tinnitus
(r = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.10-0.16). In terms of subjective severity, 7.2% reported their tinnitus as a
big or a very big problem compared with 41.6% who reported it as a small problem. Only
49.4% had discussed their tinnitus with a physician, and medications were the most
frequently discussed recommendation (45.4%). Other interventions, such as hearing aids
(9.2%), wearable (2.6%) and nonwearable (2.3%) masking devices, and cognitive behavioral
therapy (0.2%), were less frequently discussed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of tinnitus in the United States is
approximately 1 in 10 adults. Durations of occupational and leisure time noise exposures
correlated with rates of tinnitus and are likely targetable risk factors. Management options
suggested by the recently published AAO-HNSF guidelines were followed infrequently.

Given its high prevalence and effect on quality of life, the
American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery
Foundation (AAO-HNSF) recently published its first-ever, mul-
tidisciplinary,evidence-basedclinicalpracticeguidelinestopro-
vide clinicians a framework for managing tinnitus.13 In addi-
tiontooutliningasuggestedworkupforpersistenttinnitus,the
authorsprovidedrecommendationsforandagainstvarioustreat-
ment options, including education and counseling, sound
therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medications, di-
etary supplementation, and acupuncture, among others.
To achieve targeted improvement in tinnitus manage-
ment relative to the AAO-HNSF guidelines, we analyzed data
from the 2007 Integrated Health Interview Series. The Inte-
grated Health Interview Series is a project funded by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to supplement the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS), a household-based, personal-
interview survey administered by the US Census Bureau and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1957. The
NHIS serves as the largest source of health information in the
US civilian population. The information is collected from
trained interviewers via a personal household interview. The
sample is chosen at random, and starting in 2006, the minor-
ity population was oversampled to allow for more precise es-
timation of the socioeconomically mixed US population.
In 2007 only, the Integrated Health Interview Series sur-
veyaskedrespondentsnumerousquestionsabouttinnitussymp-
toms, including inquiries about treatment strategies offered by
their health care professionals. These data represent the na-
tional trends in the management of tinnitus before the formu-
lationoftherecentguidelinesreferencedabove.Theymayserve
as a benchmark for the state of tinnitus counseling and treat-
mentduringthistimeand,bycomparingandcontrastingthesur-
vey results with the AAO-HNSF guidelines, we can identify and
addressdeficienciesandareasforimprovement.Thus,inthepre-
sent study, we extracted data from this survey to (1) determine
the prevalence, duration, frequency, and severity of and com-
mon risk factors for tinnitus symptoms and (2) report common
interventions for tinnitus discussed by physicians with symp-
tomatic patients. We then compared these survey results with
the AAO-HNSF recommendations to identify areas of potential
improvement in the management of tinnitus and to guide fu-
ture studies after the implementations of the guidelines.
Methods
Adult responses in the household-based 2007 NHIS were ana-
lyzedasaggregatedintheIntegratedHealthInterviewSeries.14
DatawerecollectedinNovember2014andanalyzedattheUni-
versity of California, Irvine, and Harvard Medical School, Bos-
ton, Massachusetts. The study protocol was reviewed and
deemed exempt from review by Partners Committee on Clini-
cal Investigations because it analyzes publicly available, de-
identified data that do not require informed consent.
Previousstudies15,16haveusedtheNHIStodescribetheepi-
demiology of various otologic conditions in the United States.
However,in2007,theNHIScontainedaspecificmodulethatas-
sessed multiple tinnitus-related variables, including the pres-
ence or absence of tinnitus, the duration, frequency, and per-
ceived severity of the problem, and health care–seeking
behaviors with respect to the tinnitus and treatments offered.
Theresponseswereobtainedbytrainedinterviewersviahouse-
hold surveys. Questions asked were typically simple, for ex-
ample: “In the past 12 months, have you been bothered by ring-
ing, roaring, or buzzing in your ears or head that lasts for 5
minutes or more?” The answer choices included options rang-
ingfrom“notaproblem”to“asmall/moderate/big/verybigprob-
lem,
” as well as declining to answer. Because these responses
werecollectedthrougharigorous,interview-basedprocess,we
presumethatthequestionswereunderstood,unbiased,andap-
propriately guided by the interviewers. In addition to tinnitus
variables, respondents were queried on noise exposure at work
and during recreational time. When surveying work noise ex-
posure, interviewers defined loud environments as those in
which one must speak in a raised voice to be heard. In an effort
to maintain uniformity, several particular recreational time ac-
tivities,includingtheuseofgardeningandworkshoptools,ma-
chinery, motorcycles and other motor engines, loud household
appliances, MP3 players, and concert attendance, among oth-
ers, were queried.
Corresponding responses were extracted for adult pa-
tients (aged ≥18.0 years). Data were imported into SPSS soft-
ware (version 22.0; SPSS, Inc) for analysis. We determined the
prevalence of self-reported tinnitus with various factors that
further characterized the tinnitus symptom, including dura-
tion, frequency, and severity. These data were used to deter-
mine the associations between the prevalence of tinnitus and
noise exposures. Thereafter, the proportion of respondents
who discussed their tinnitus with their physician and the pro-
portions who subscribed to various remedies for their tinni-
tus were also calculated. We applied sample design weights to
Key Points
Question How are the epidemiologic features and management
of tinnitus before the implementation of the 2014 American
Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation
clinical practice guidelines on tinnitus quantified?
Findings Results from this cross-sectional analysis indicated that in
9.6% of respondents experienced tinnitus in the past year, 36.0% of
whom had nearly constant symptoms. Fewer than half of the
patients had discussed their problem with a physician, who most
commonly provided medications for management of tinnitus.
Meaning The national prevalence of tinnitus is approximately 1 in
10 adults, who were typically not treated in accordance with
recent guidelines.

Results
Among an estimated 222.1 (3.4) million adults (raw number,
75 764), 21.4 (3.4) million adults (9.6% [0.3%]) had experi-
enced tinnitus in the past 12 months. When asked about the
duration of symptoms, 56.1% of respondents with tinnitus ex-
perienced the problem for longer than 5 years, and 27.0% had
symptoms for longer than 15 years. Adults who had experi-
enced tinnitus in the prior 12 months were significantly older
than those who did not have tinnitus (mean age, 53.1 vs 45.0
years; mean difference, 8.1 years; 95% CI, 7.2-9.0 years). In ad-
dition, those individuals with more severe symptoms tended
to be older, with a direct correlation seen between increased
tinnitus severity and increased age (r = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.04-
0.13) (Figure). Furthermore, tinnitus tended to be more preva-
lent in men (10.5%) than women (8.8%; mean difference, 1.8%;
95% CI, 0.9%-2.7%), with no significant differences in sever-
ity between the 2 groups. Men were more likely than women
to discuss tinnitus with their physician (52.8% vs 48.0%; mean
difference, 4.8%; 95% CI, 0.5%-9.1%) (Table 1).
Of those who reported experiencing tinnitus, 36.0% re-
ported having nearly constant symptoms, 15.0% had notice-
able symptoms at least once a day, 14.6% had noticeable symp-
tomsatleastonceaweek,andtheremainderhadsymptomsless
than weekly. Regarding subjective severity, 7.2% believed tin-
nitus to be a big or a very big problem; 20.2%, a moderate prob-
lem; and 41.6%, a small problem. The remaining 31.0% was not
bothered by tinnitus. When asked about when they noticed the
symptoms, 38.4% noted their tinnitus at bedtime.
Among all respondents, 25.0% reported a history of regu-
lar loud noise exposure at work, with duration of such expo-
sure reported as 0 to 2 years by 27.7%, 3 to 14 years by 38.0%,
and 15 or more years by 34.3%. Those with a history of regu-
lar noise exposure at work had a 19.2% prevalence of tinnitus
compared with 6.8% for those without (odds ratio, 3.3; 95%
CI, 2.9-3.7). Furthermore, we found an associated increase in
the prevalence of tinnitus based on number of years exposed
to work noise, including 0 to 2 years with a tinnitus preva-
lence of 12.9%, 3 to 14 years with a prevalence of 18.0%, and
15 or more years with a prevalence of 25.7% (r = 0.13; 95% CI,
0.10-0.16) (Table 2). A significant number of adults also re-

posure to loud noise in leisure time was 17.1% compared with
7.4% for those without such exposure (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI,
2.3-2.9).

pared with the recommendations elaborated by the AAO-

for tinnitus, and the associated increase in risk depends on the
severityofhearingimpairment.5,12,17,18Furthermore,theriskfor
tinnitus is elevated in people with a history of head injury, de-
pressive symptoms, target shooting, arthritis, use of nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory medications,5,19 hypertension, and
smoking.7 In addition, individuals with intolerable tinnitus of-
tenhavehigherratesofanxiety,depression,lowself-esteem,and
poorqualityoflifecomparedwiththosewithouttinnitus.12,20-23
Moreover, tinnitus is the most common service-related disabil-
ity among veterans, with more than 1.1 million US veterans re-
ceiving disability payments for intolerable tinnitus in 2013.24
Wide ranges of tinnitus prevalence have been reported
from previous studies, possibly the result of variations in
survey questioning and statistical methods. Most
studies3-12,25 found that the prevalence of tinnitus in adults
ranged from 8% to 30%. Although our reported prevalence
among adults in the United States reporting tinnitus symp-
toms in the prior 12 months is on the lower end of the range,
the study that reported the highest prevalence of tinnitus
(30%) limited their survey population to adults older than
55 years.12 This restriction likely contributed to the rela-
tively higher prevalence rate.
We also found that more men than women reported
tinnitus, which is consistent with previously published
findings.26,27 In addition and similar to other large epidemio-
logic studies in the United States, tinnitus severity directly cor-
relatedwithage.4,7,27,28However,wealsoseeinthiscohortthat
although the prevalence of tinnitus increased with age, it de-
creased in the older populations, beginning in the seventh de-
cade of life, and this change is reported elsewhere (Figure).6,7
Loud noise exposure has been consistently linked to
increased odds of hearing loss.1,5,7,26 In particular, the risks
of occupational noise exposure have been associated with
the development of tinnitus symptoms.10,25,27,29-31 In con-
trast, the Beaver Dam Offspring Study5 failed to demon-
strate an association between occupational noise exposure
and the prevalence or incidence of tinnitus. In our sampled
cohort, most of the respondents denied regular loud noise
exposure at work or during leisure hours and did not experi-
ence 1 episode of loud noise exposure at work in the prior 12
months. However, among the respondents with regular
occupational noise exposure, the prevalence of tinnitus was
higher than in those without such exposure, and the rates of
tinnitus increased with the reported duration of occupa-
tional noise exposure (Table 2). A similar association was
seen among adults who reported monthly exposure to loud
noise during leisure time. The data suggest that although
most of the respondents do not have regular exposure to
loud noise at work or during leisure time, tinnitus occurs at
much higher rates during regular exposure to environments
with loud noise, which are furthermore correlated with
duration of noise exposure.
The AAO-HNSF guidelines are intended to address the
treatment of the subset of patients with tinnitus and symp-
tom persistence for at least 6 months, which constitutes a large
portionofourstudycohort.Mostoftherespondentsinoursur-
vey noted symptoms for longer than 12 months. However, in-
dependentofsymptomduration,mostoftherespondentswith
tinnitus believed their symptoms to be “not a problem” or only
“a small problem.
” Similarly, 55.5% of respondents in the Blue
Mountains Hearing Study26 reported their symptoms to be
mild. Thus, for many patients with chronic tinnitus, the se-
verity of symptoms may actually be tolerable, and they may
not require any intervention.

Patientswithintolerableandbothersometinnitusoftenex-
perience sleep disturbance and poor quality of life, which can
lead to mental distress, worsened anxiety and depression
symptoms,anddisability.7,20-23Despitethisevidence,wefound
that most respondents had not discussed their problem with
a physician, and many more had never tried any form of rem-
edy. These figures are similar to those reported in the Blue
Mountains Hearing Study,12 where only 37% sought help de-
spite 50% of participants reporting a tinnitus problem for 6
years or more. Similar to our cohort, only 6% of patients re-
porting tinnitus in their study received a form of treatment.12
Of note and in the present study, fewer than 1 in 4 pa-
tients who discussed their tinnitus symptoms with their phy-
sician received management recommendations in concor-
dance with the current AAO-HNSF guidelines. As seen in
Table 3, the most commonly discussed intervention for tinni-
tus management was medical therapy. Although the treat-
ment of comorbid mood disorders with psychoactive medi-
cations has been shown in some studies to reduce the severity
of tinnitus,32,33 the AAO-HNSF recommends that clinicians
shouldnotusemedicaltherapy,includingantidepressants,an-
ticonvulsants, and intratympanic medications, for routine
management of tinnitus. Anxiolytics are also not recom-
mended owing to the lack of consistent benefit and the po-
tential for adverse effects. The recommendation against medi-
cal therapy is primarily owing to insufficient data from clinical
trials and meta-analyses to reliably demonstrate a reduction
in the perception of tinnitus.13
Although evaluation for a hearing aid for patients with
hearing loss and tinnitus was recommended in the AAO-
HNSF guidelines,13 we found that this topic was rarely dis-
cussed (Table 3). A hearing aid–like device can be used to de-
liver sound therapy, which may provide respite from tinnitus.
Although conclusive evidence behind the efficacy of sound
therapy in the treatment of tinnitus is lacking,34 the AAO-
HNSF guidelines encourage clinicians to regularly present it
as an option for patients with persistent and bothersome tin-
nitus, given that adverse effects and potential harm are mini-
mal to nonexistent.13 Moreover, masking sound therapy can
be delivered in the form of wearable and nonwearable appli-
ances and can provide some benefit to patients with tinnitus,
but our results show that these therapeutic management strat-
egies were infrequently discussed with our respondents seek-
ing medical advice (Table 3).
Tinnitus symptoms can also lead to sleep, concentration,
and emotional difficulties,35 for which CBT has been shown
to be beneficial.36,37 Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to re-
structure distressful and dysfunctional thoughts that lead to
cognitive distortions into a more effective response to stress-
ors. These techniques promote habituation and adaptive be-
haviorsthatmayimprovetinnitustolerance,depressionscores,
and quality of life without directly affecting the severity or vol-
ume of tinnitus.37 However, the evidence supporting or refut-
ingtheeffectivenessofCBTinimprovingtinnitus-specificqual-
ityoflifeisconsideredtobegenerallyinsufficientinsomelarge
reviews, mostly secondary to inconsistent study methods and
lack of high-powered studies.38 Regardless, although CBT is a
favored recommendation in the AAO-HNSF guidelines for the
management of bothersome tinnitus and the good-practice
guidelines of the Department of Health in the United
Kingdom,38 CBT was rarely discussed with our cohort during
physician-patient conversations regarding tinnitus (Table 3).
Cognitive behavioral therapy can furthermore be combined
witheducationandcounselingviainformationalbrochuresand
self-help books, as well as stress management techniques, to
provide effective management strategies for tinnitus. Unfor-
tunately, as seen in Table 3, these adjunctive therapies were
seldom discussed with patients who presented to a physician
with tinnitus symptoms.
The AAO-HNSF recommended against dietary supple-
ments, such as Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and zinc, among oth-
ers, given the preponderance of harm over clear benefit dem-
onstrated in randomized clinical trials for any dietary
supplement.13 Nevertheless, nutritional supplementation was
more often discussed than nearly every other recommended
intervention listed in Table 3. In addition, unconventional and
unproven strategies, such as surgical transection of the audi-
tory nerve and alternative medicine, were also discussed with
patients (Table 3).
Tinnitus-related disability has been reported to be among
the most common of chronic conditions and in some popula-
tions even more prevalent than back and neck pain, knee prob-
lems, and diabetes mellitus.24 The negative effect on quality
of life due to chronic tinnitus is well-established, and, similar
to chronic daily headache39 and low back pain,40 has been re-
ported to adversely affect all 5 measures of validated health-
relatedqualityoflifesurveys,includingmobility,self-care,per-
formance of usual activities, pain and/or discomfort, and
anxiety and/or depression.41 Moreover, mood disorder comor-
bidity among individuals with tinnitus has been reported to
be as high as 60% to 80%42,43 and can lead to increases in mea-
sures of tinnitus annoyance.44 Similar findings are also seen
in other common conditions, such as chronic pain. Preva-
lenceofmajordepressivedisorderamongpatientswithchronic
pain has been reported to be more than 50%,45 and low back
pain is also associated with higher rates of depression, anxi-
ety, and sleep disorders.46
Our study has several strengths and limitations. The data
arederivedfromanationaldatabasethatrepresentsalargeand

thermore, to our knowledge, this study is also the first to re-
port the epidemiologic data on the treatments for tinnitus dis-
cussed by physicians with their patients. However, the data
analyzed herein were extracted from the 2007 NHIS and may
therefore not reflect the current tinnitus management prac-
tices of physicians nationally. Consequently, and with more re-

of this study, the potential for recall bias from the respondents

to fully understand the discussion of tinnitus and manage-
ment recommendations from their health care professionals.
Conclusions
The analysis of responses from 75 764 US adults, represent-
ing a sample of more than 220 million people, confirms that
tinnitus is prevalent in the general adult population. Re-
ported rates of tinnitus are significantly higher in those with
regular exposure to noisy environments at work and during
leisure time. The recent guidelines published by the AAO-
HNSF provide a logical framework for clinicians treating these
patients,butthecurrentresultsindicatethatmostpatientsmay
not be offered management recommendations consistent with
the suggested protocol. With the newly published guidelines
from the AAO-HNSF, otolaryngologists may play a greater role
in addressing this issue, not only with treating their patients
accordingly, but also in educating other physicians and health
careprofessionals.Futureworkcanbedirectedtoshowchang-
