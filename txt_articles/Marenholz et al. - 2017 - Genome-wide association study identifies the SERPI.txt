Genetic factors and mechanisms underlying food allergy are largely unknown. Due to het-
erogeneity of symptoms a reliable diagnosis is often difficult to make. Here, we report a
genome-wide association study on food allergy diagnosed by oral food challenge in 497 cases
and 2387 controls. We identify five loci at genome-wide significance, the clade B serpin
(SERPINB) gene cluster at 18q21.3, the cytokine gene cluster at 5q31.1, the filaggrin gene, the
C11orf30/LRRC32 locus, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Stratifying the results
for the causative food demonstrates that association of the HLA locus is peanut allergy-
specific whereas the other four loci increase the risk for any food allergy. Variants in the
SERPINB gene cluster are associated with SERPINB10 expression in leukocytes. Moreover,
SERPINB genes are highly expressed in the esophagus. All identified loci are involved in
immunological regulation or epithelial barrier function, emphasizing the role of both
mechanisms in food allergy.

 F
ood allergy (FA) is a worldwide increasing public health
problem. Disease prevalence ranges from 1 to 5% in Eur-
opean countries to over 10% in Australia and most studies
have demonstrated a consistent increase over the past two dec-
ades. In infancy, allergic responses against hen’s egg (HE) and
cow’s milk (CM) are most common whereas in childhood, peanut
(PN) allergy becomes more frequent1–4. Affected children can
experience severe allergic reactions rendering food allergy the
most
common
cause
of
life-threatening
anaphylaxis
in
childhood5–7. Food allergy is a complex disease with genetic and
environmental factors involved. Twin studies estimated food
allergy heritability at about 80%8, 9. Previous genetic studies
mainly focused on PN allergy. They pointed to a few genes which
were repeatedly associated with the disease. Loss-of-function
(LOF) mutations in the epidermal barrier gene filaggrin (FLG)
increased the risk for PN sensitization and PN allergy, likely due
to increased allergen penetration and sensitization to PN through
a defective skin barrier10. In addition, association of the HLA-
DQB1 locus with PN allergy has been reported by several inde-
pendent groups11–13. The first genome-wide association study
(GWAS) defined food allergy based on a convincing history of an
allergic reaction to a specific food and evidence of sensitization to
the same food. This study confirmed the HLA locus on chro-
mosome 6 to be associated with PN allergy14. Although a skin
barrier defect and immunological dysfunction seem to play a role
in the development of food allergy, additional genetic factors
remain to be identified.
Many studies on food allergy suffer from weak phenotype
definitions as they rely on individual or parental reports of an
adverse reaction to food. However, due to the large spectrum of
disease symptoms which may affect any organ system, a reliable
diagnosis is often difficult to obtain. A systematic review of the
literature revealed that the point prevalence of self-reported food
allergy was approximately six times higher than the point pre-
valence of challenge-proven food allergy3, suggesting that over
80% of history-based food allergy diagnoses cannot be confirmed
in an oral food challenge (OFC). Even if the diagnosis was based
on reported allergic symptoms plus elevated specific IgE or a
positive skin prick test, the prevalence of food allergy was over-
estimated by a factor of 3 compared with challenge-proven food
allergy3. As a consequence, and in order to standardize the
diagnostic criteria of food allergy, current guidelines recommend
oral food challenges as the diagnostic gold standard for food
allergy3, 15.
Here, we report a GWAS on OFC-proven food allergy in a
German study population. The discovery set includes 523 food
allergic children and 2682 population-based controls. We repli-
cate the results in a second data set of 380 German cases and 986
controls. As additional replication set the Chicago Food Allergy
Study, comprising 671 FA cases and 1526 mostly family based
controls, is available14. We identifiy five genomic regions to be
associated with food allergy at genome-wide significance, of
which the SERPINB gene cluster has not been linked to allergic
disease previously. The identified food allergy susceptibility loci
support the role of epithelial barriers and of the immune response
in the development of food allergy.
Results
Study design and quality control. To identify genes involved in
food allergy, we performed a GWAS in a discovery set of 523 food
allergic cases and 2682 population-based controls from the Ger-
man Heinz Nixdorff Recall Study (HNR)16. All cases were from
the Genetics of Food Allergy Study (GOFA) in which the diag-
nosis of food allergy was based on OFCs according to current
guidelines3. After applying stringent quality control criteria (see
“Methods”), the discovery set consisted of 497 cases and 2387
controls with high quality genotype data. For imputation, we used
the Haplotype Reference Consortium data at the University of
Michigan as reference17. In order to ascertain high quality of
imputed genotypes, we filtered for a quality score of r2>0.5 and
excluded low frequency variants (minor allele frequency (MAF)
<5%), yielding over five million single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) available for analysis. The study design is summarized in
Fig. 1. Association with disease was calculated with FastLMM
using an additive allele-dosage model. The main analysis was
performed on any food allergy (Fig. 2). In addition, we investi-
gated the three most common allergies against specific foods
separately, including HE (n = 288), PN (n = 220), and CM
(n = 169; Fig. 2). There was no evidence for inflation of the test
statistics neither in the GWAS on any food allergy (λ = 1.03) nor
in the allergen-stratified analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). For
replication, we considered all loci with moderate association in
the discovery set (P < 1 × 10−3; Supplementary Data 1a–d). If
multiple SNPs from the same locus reached the selection
threshold, we selected the best SNP. For the remaining SNPs, we
calculated linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the lead variant. If

 SNPs in low LD (r2 < 0.2) were present, again the best SNP was
selected for replication.
To replicate the findings, we investigated 380 additional food
allergic cases of the GOFA study and 986 population-based
controls of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP)18, of which
379 and 984 samples passed the quality check. All individuals of
the discovery and replication set were of European ancestry as
confirmed by principal component analysis. A detailed char-
acterization of both data sets is provided in Table 1.
Furthermore, variants replicating with the same risk allele as
the GOFA discovery set at nominal significance (P < 0.05) and
not reaching the Bonferroni corrected P value in the GOFA
replication set were confirmed in the Chicago Food Allergy Study
(Supplementary Table 1) comprising 671 food allergic children,
144 non-allergic, non-sensitized normal controls, and 1382
controls of unknown phenotype (234 children and 1148 parents),
all of European ancestry (Fig. 1)14.
Loci associated with food allergy. In the main analysis on any
food allergy, two loci already showed association at genome-wide
significance (P < 5 × 10−8) in the discovery set (Table 2, Fig. 2).
The respective lead SNPs, rs12123821 on chromosome 1q21.3
(odds ratio (OR), 2.55; P = 8.4 × 10−10) and rs11949166 on 5q31.1
(OR, 0.60; P = 1.2 × 10−13), were also significantly associated with
food allergy in the GOFA replication set after correction for the
number of tests performed (for FA; n = 847, P < 5.9 × 10−5,

 and with similar effect sizes (rs12123821; OR, 2.86; P = 6.1 × 10−7
and rs11949166; OR, 0.69; P = 3.0 × 10−5). Meta-analysis of the
two sets yielded highly significant associations at 1q21.3 and
5q31.1 (rs12123821; OR, 2.65; P = 2.6 × 10−15 and rs11949166;
OR, 0.63; P = 4.3 × 10−17).
Variant rs12123821 at 1q21.3 is located within the epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC) near the epidermal barrier gene
filaggrin (FLG, Supplementary Fig. 2a) which was previously
associated with PN allergy10. Since we identified LD between
rs12123821 and a LOF mutation in FLG, c.2282del4 (r2 = 0.19, Dʹ
= 0.78), we evaluated whether the association signal at 1q21.3 was
due to known FLG mutations. We included the two most
common FLG LOF mutations in European populations, FLG
c.2282del4 (tagged by rs12123821) and p.R501X (rs61816761) as
covariates in the analysis which eliminated the highest association
peaks within the EDC (Supplementary Table 2). While our results
confirmed the role of FLG null mutations in food allergy, a
residual association was still detectable between FLG and the
repetin gene (RPTN; Supplementary Fig. 2b, Supplementary
Table 2), which could point to additional genetic risk factors in
this region.
FLG mutations are known to be strong risk factors for
eczema19 which often co-occurs with food allergy4. In order to
exclude that the observed association was due to an underlying
association with eczema, we performed the association analysis in
the subset of children without eczema (n = 152, Table 3). The
effect of rs12123821 remained significant with similar effect size
(OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.15–2.74; P = 0.0094), demonstrating an
eczema-independent effect of FLG null mutations on food allergy.
Finally, we investigated the effect of FLG null mutations on
allergies to specific foods. While the association of FLG null
mutations with PN allergy is well-documented10, we show that
FLG mutations also confer risk for HE and CM allergy with
similar and large effect sizes (Table 2).
On
chromosome
5q31.1,
the
strongest
association
was
observed for rs11949166 located between the interleukin 4 gene
(IL4) and the kinesin family member 3a gene (KIF3A) within the
cytokine gene cluster (Table 2). Variants spanning the whole
0.2 Mb region from IL5 to KIF3A were associated with food
allergy at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8, Supplementary
Fig. 3a). We tested whether LD within the cytokine gene cluster
accounted for the multitude of associated SNPs or whether
several independent signals were present. We identified two
groups of SNPs covering IL5/RAD50 and IL4/KIF3A, which were
significantly associated with food allergy (Supplementary Figs. 3a
and 4a). There was high LD between the SNPs of each group, but
low LD between SNPs of different groups. Mutual adjustment for
the lead SNP of each group pointed to two independent signals
(Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figs. 3b and 4b). Since
this chromosomal region is a known eczema locus, we again
stratified the association analysis for the eczema status and
confirmed an eczema-independent effect of rs11949166 on food
allergy with nearly identical effect sizes in the subgroups with
eczema (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.50–1.91) and without eczema (OR,
1.61; 95% CI, 1.27–2.04; Table 3).
Two novel susceptibility loci were identified at genome-wide
significance after replication in the Chicago Food Allergy Study
(Supplementary Table 1). The lead variant at 11q13.5, rs2212434
(Supplementary Fig. 5), was consistently associated with the same
risk allele in all three study populations (Table 4). The same SNP
was identified as the best associated variant at this locus in the
largest eczema GWAS20 to date. The eczema-stratified analysis
revealed a strong and significant effect (OR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.25–1.58; P = 1.9 × 10−8) in the food allergy plus eczema group

 and a residual effect (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.90–1.44; P = 0.29) that
was, however, not significant in a small set of 152 food allergic
children without eczema (Table 3).
Another new susceptibility locus, which had not yet been
linked to any allergic disease, was identified in chromosomal
region 18q21.3 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). SNP rs12964116 located
in intron 1 of SERPINB7 (serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B,
member 7) was associated with food allergy in the GOFA
discovery set (OR, 1.9; P = 5.7 × 10−6, Table 2) and replicated
with the same risk allele and a similar effect size in the GOFA
replication set (OR, 1.69; P = 9.4 × 10−3). Since rs12964116
did not reach the Bonferroni corrected P value in the replication
set
(P < 5.9 × 10−5),
we
investigated
the
Chicago
Food
Allergy Study14 in order to confirm this locus. Again, the SNP
was significantly associated with food allergy and with PN
allergy
(Table
4),
reaching
genome-wide
significance
for
both phenotypes in the meta-analysis including all three studies
(P = 1.8 × 10−8 for any food allergy and P = 1.9 × 10−10 for
PN allergy). Within the SERPINB gene cluster, a second
SNP (rs1243064) in moderate LD with rs12964116 (r2 = 0.06,
Dʹ = 0.71) was associated with food allergy (Supplementary
Fig. 7a). In order to explore whether the two SNPs represented
independent association signals we mutually conditioned on the
two lead variants (Supplementary Table 5). In both cases,
association of the other variant with food allergy decreased but
was still present suggesting more than one risk haplotype at this
locus (Supplementary Figs. 6b and 7b, Supplementary Table 5).
Association of rs1243064 was confirmed in the GOFA
replication set for HE allergy at nominal significance, reaching
genome-wide
significance
in
the

of
GOFA
discovery and replication set (P = 4.2 × 10−8, Table 2). In the
Chicago Food Allergy Study the same risk allele was identified
(Table 4). However, association did not reach significance (P =
0.15) which may be due to reduced power in a small sample with
a less stringent phenotype definition that was not based on OFCs.
Overall, association at the serpin locus was consistent and strong
for any food allergy, PN, and HE allergy.
To better understand the potential functional basis of the novel
food allergy locus, we used LDLink21 to identify all variants
within the SERPINB gene cluster which are in high LD (r2 > 0.8)
with the two lead SNPs, rs12964116 and rs1243064. None of the
identified candidate SNPs altered any protein sequences as
predicted by the ENSEMBL variant effect predictor (Supplemen-
tary Table 6)22. We therefore evaluated their association with
gene expression in expression databases including the Genotype-
Expression database (GTEx, version V6p), and reviewed their
functional annotations in the ENCODE Consortium (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/)23.
rs12964116 is located in an intron of SERPINB7 in a binding
site for several members of the transcription factor activator
protein (AP)-1 complex, which is involved in diverse cellular
processes including cell growth and differentiation (Supplemen-
tary Table 6). In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq
experiments
this
site
has
also
been
shown
to
bind
the
transcription
factor
CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein
beta
(CEBPB)24 which regulates the expression of genes involved in
immune
and
inflammatory
responses,
including
cytokines
interleukin-6, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and TNF-alpha, as
well as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
which mediates the transcriptional activation in response to
multiple cytokines and growth factors. The other lead SNP,
rs1243064, is a tissue-specific expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL), with the risk allele rs1243064A being negatively
correlated with SERPINB10 expression in whole blood (Supple-
mentary Table 6).
We then used LD score regression analysis in order to quantify
the liability-scale heritability of food allergy that was explained by
the lead variants identified in our study. Altogether, the food
allergy susceptibility loci identified in this study explained
∼10.2% of the variance in liability (Supplementary Table 7).
Loci associated with allergy to specific foods. Association results
within the HLA region at 6p21 (Supplementary Fig. 8a) con-
firmed a previously reported locus for PN allergy14. We found LD
(r2 = 0.48, Dʹ = 0.85) between rs9273440, which was strongly
associated with PN allergy in the discovery and in the replication
set (Table 2), and rs9275596, which was the lead SNP in the
previous GWAS14. Although several SNPs reached the selection
threshold (P < 1 × 10−3) in the discovery set, conditioning on
rs9273440 eliminated all association signals within the region
(Supplementary Fig. 8b), pointing to a single signal at this locus.
Notably, children with HE or CM allergy did not contribute to
the association with rs9273440 (Table 2) demonstrating a PN-
specific locus.
In the analysis of HE allergy, 896 candidate variants were
identified in the discovery set (Supplementary Data 1b). Apart
from the susceptibility loci for any food allergy at 1q21.3 and
5q31.1
(Table

two
additional
SNPs
were
significantly
associated in the GOFA replication set and selected for replication
in the Chicago Food Allergy Study in which neither SNP reached
significance (Supplementary Table 1). In the analysis of CM

Study.
Discussion
Here we report a GWAS on OFC-proven food allergy which
stratified the results for the three most common food allergens.
We identified five loci at genome-wide significance including the
SERPINB gene cluster at 18q21.3 which was not previously linked
to any allergic disease. We demonstrated that the association of
FLG at 1q21.3, the cytokine gene cluster at 5q31.1, the C11orf30/
LRRC32 region on chromosome 11q13.5, and the SERPINB gene
cluster with food allergy was independent of the allergen whereas
the HLA locus at 6p21 was clearly identified as a PN allergy-
specific susceptibility locus. Moreover, we showed that the effect
on food allergy was independent of eczema for 4 out of 5 sus-
ceptibility loci.
Two recent GWAS focussed on PN allergy. The Chicago Food
Allergy Study defined cases based on a reported history of food
allergy in combination with elevated specific IgE against the same
food and confirmed a previous association of the HLA region
with PN allergy14. The HLA association with PN allergy was also
confirmed in the HealthNuts Study. In the latter report, PN
allergy was diagnosed by OFC but results did not reach genome-
wide significance, likely due to the small sample size (73 cases and
148 controls)25. In the present study, the strongest association at
6p21 was observed for rs9273440 located in the 3ʹ-untranslated
region (UTR) of HLA-DQB1. This marker was in LD with the
two variants reported by Hong et al.14, rs9275596 (r2 = 0.48, Dʹ =
0.85) and rs7192 (r2 = 0.25, Dʹ = 0.69). The functional investiga-
tion revealed high LD with a missense variant in HLD-DQB1.
Although this variant is located in a highly conserved region there
is no additional evidence for a disease-causing role. Our study
design enabled us to investigate the effect of HLA markers on
food-specific allergies. Clearly, the lead SNP in the HLA region,
rs9273440, was only associated with PN allergy and not with HE
or CM allergy.
A strong association with food allergy, reaching genome-wide
significance already in the discovery stage, was found in the EDC
on chromosome 1. We showed that this association was attri-
butable to null mutations in the filaggrin gene which encodes an
epidermal barrier protein. Filaggrin null mutations are strong risk
factors for eczema and eczema-associated asthma or allergic
rhinitis19, 26, 27. In addition, an association of FLG mutations with
PN allergy has previously been reported10. Here, we demonstrate
that FLG mutations have an effect on food allergy regardless of
the causing allergen with consistently large effect sizes for HE,
PN, and CM (Table 2). Furthermore, and in contrast to a pre-
vious study that reported an association of FLG mutations with
food allergy only in the context of eczema28, our large study
population enabled us to compare the FLG effect between food
allergic children with and without eczema. Although the effect
size in children with eczema was moderately larger (OR = 2.13,
95% CI 1.74–2.62), we clearly observed a significant, strong effect
of FLG mutations on food allergy in the absence of eczema (OR
1.77, 95% CI 1.15–2.74). This finding is distinct from asthma for
which a FLG effect was only detectable in the presence of
eczema19, 26, 27. Interestingly, filaggrin is expressed in the oral and
esophageal mucosa, but not in airway epithelia29, 30. While in
eczema-associated asthma allergic sensitization through the
defective skin barrier seems to play a pivotal role in disease
development, in food allergy, enhanced penetration of allergens
may occur through a leaky epithelial barrier in the upper gas-
trointestinal tract independently of the skin. A recent study
suggested a link between downregulation of filaggrin in the eso-
phageal mucosa and impairment of the corresponding epithelial
barrier30.
Association with food allergy was also observed within the
cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 5q31.1, spanning the whole
region from IL5 to KIF3A. This region has previously been linked
to a number of inflammatory and immune-related diseases
including Crohn’s disease31, psoriasis32, and eczema33. Since food
allergy is often associated with eczema, we demonstrated that the
observed association was independent of eczema. In both sub-
groups,
food
allergic
children
with
and
without
eczema,
rs11949166 showed highly significant association with nearly
identical effect sizes. The lead SNP at this locus, rs11949166, was
located between IL4 and KIF3A. Using conditional analysis we
clearly identify a second independent association signal in the
RAD50/IL13 region which also contains the well-known coding
IL13 variant (IL-13 R130Q) involved in allergic disease34. Recent
studies provided evidence that IL-4/IL-13 pathways play an
important role in food allergy. Mouse models have demonstrated
that IL-4 and IL-13 production by group 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2s) blocked the generation of mucosal allergen-specific reg-
ulatory T cells and promoted food allergy35.
The C11orf30/LRRC32 region is a known risk locus for
eczema36, asthma37, 38, and other inflammatory diseases such as

 inflammatory bowel disease39. The lead SNP rs2212434 has
previously been identified in the largest meta-GWAS on eczema,
in which the odds ratio was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.07–1.12)20. For food
allergy, we estimated an OR of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.20–1.51) which
was even higher when considering the combined food allergy plus
eczema phenotype (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.25–1.58). Since C11orf30/
LRRC32 was also strongly associated with the atopic march
(rs2155219, OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.24–1.43)40, our results support a
key role of this locus in the development of multiple allergic
disorders including food allergy.
Importantly, we report a novel, genome-wide significant
association of food allergy with the SERPINB gene cluster on
chromosome 18q21.3. Two SNPs in moderate LD were found to
be associated with disease. One lead SNP, rs12964116, is located
in an intron of SERPINB7 which belongs to the serine protease
inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. SERPINB7 shows a very specific
expression pattern. It is highly expressed in the upper layers of
the epidermis. Loss-of-function mutations in SERPINB7 cause
“Nagashima-type” palmoplantar keratosis (NPPK), an autosomal
recessive hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles which is asso-
ciated with skin barrier deficiency41. Apart from the skin, SER-
PINB7 is expressed in few other organs lined by stratified
squamous epithelia including the esophagus (Supplementary
Table 8). Its expression there suggests a potential role in the
epithelial integrity and function of the upper digestive tract that
may be relevant to the development of food allergy. rs12964116
alters a binding site for several transcription factors, including
CEBPB and STAT3. CEBPB regulates the expression of genes
involved in allergic inflammation, including the Th2 cell (type 2
helper T cells) effector cytokines interleukin-1342, interleukin-4,43
and interleukin-544, and also promotes mucosal immunity in a
mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis45. Furthermore,
transcription factor STAT3 binds to this locus which is required
for Th2 cell development in a mouse model of allergic inflam-
mation46. The other lead SNP, rs1243064, is a tissue-specific
eQTL, with the risk allele rs1243064A being negatively correlated
with the expression of SERPINB10 in whole blood. SERPINB10 is
expressed in leukocytes, blood, esophagus, and skin, but little is
known about its function.
Although the functional data point to SERPINB7 and SER-
PINB10, other SERPINB genes also represent good candidates as
they constitute a tightly linked gene cluster on chromosome 18.
Clade B serpins are involved in several biological functions
including protease inhibition, tumor suppression, regulation of
apoptosis and inflammation. Of note, many clade B serpins have
very restricted expression patterns with high expression levels in
the esophageal mucosa (Supplementary Table 8).
SerpinB3 and serpinB4 were upregulated in affected skin of
eczema patients and in the airway epithelia of patients with
allergic asthma, induced via a pathway involving the Th2 cyto-
kines IL-4 and IL-1347–49. In a mouse model, allergen exposure
induced Serpinb3a expression in the epidermis which promoted
barrier dysfunction and skin inflammation50. In contrast, Ser-
pinb2 had a protective effect on the skin barrier; a knockout
mouse revealed loss of stratum corneum integrity and reduced
barrier function51. SerpinB2 was upregulated in airway epithelial
cells from asthmatic patients52 and upon allergen challenge53.
After enteric nematode infection, IL-4 and IL-13 induced SER-
PINB2 expression in the intestinal mucosa where it affects diverse
immunological processes; serpinB2 protects macrophages from
apoptosis and is involved in the regulation of cytokines54.
Functional studies will be required to gain a better understanding
of the physiological role of clade B serpins in food allergy.
We estimated the FA heritability from our GWAS summary
statistics to be 24.4%. This is in contrast to previous estimates
from twin studies which yielded estimates around 80%. Similar
discrepancies have been reported for other complex diseases55.
The difference between the heritability estimates from GWAS and
from pedigree or twin studies may be due to an underestimation
of the contribution of common environmental factors in twin
studies, gene-environment interactions or model misspecifica-
tion56. The five lead variants of the food allergy susceptibility loci
identified in this study explained 10.2% of the heritability.
Some limitations of our study need to be discussed. Although
we performed the largest GWAS on food allergy to date, the
sample size was relatively small for a GWAS on a complex genetic
trait. This was due to the strict phenotype definition used in our
study. Though recommended in current guidelines3, 15, OFCs are
not always performed as the diagnostic standard method. As a
consequence for challenge-proven food allergy, large numbers of
patients are difficult to obtain. This study was powered to detect
loci of relatively large effect sizes. While the combined GOFA set
had a power of 99% to detect a risk variant with an OR of 1.6
(using an allelic model with 5% prevalence, 20% risk allele fre-
quency, and alpha <5 × 10−8)57, the power dropped to 10% for
variants with a moderate OR of 1.3. Additional studies in larger
samples will be required to evaluate variants with low effect sizes.
In the context of limited study power, the finding of allergen-
specific associations should be interpreted cautiously since the
lack of association between an allergen-specific SNP and other
FAs may be due to limited sample size of the subgroups. Likewise,
our assessment of association with FA in the context of eczema
was affected by sample size. In particular in the relatively small
subset of patients without eczema (n = 152), a moderate SNP
effect might not be detected. Accordingly, the effect of C11orf30/
LRRC32 on food allergy in the absence of eczema (OR, 1.14; 95%
CI, 0.90–1.44, p = 0.29) might become significant, if larger study
populations are analyzed. In contrast to the well phenotyped cases
included in this study, there was no reliable information on food
allergy available for the controls. Therefore, the presence of
affected individuals among controls may have decreased the
power of our study. Given a food allergy prevalence of about 5%
in Western Europe, the loss of power was probably minor.
In summary, the identification of five food allergy susceptibility
loci demonstrates that a strict phenotype definition, as set forth
by recent medical guidelines on food allergy, is important for
studies on the genetics of food allergy. The discovery of the
SERPINB gene cluster in food allergy susceptibility emphasizes
the importance of proteolytic pathways in the regulation of the
immune response and in the maintenance of the epithelial bar-
rier, both of which are impaired in food allergy.
Methods
Study populations and study design. Children of the GOFA were recruited at
clinical centers in Berlin, Wangen, Hannover, and Oldenburg, Germany. In total,
523 food allergic children were recruited for the GOFA discovery phase. Apart
from any FA, we investigated the three most common food allergies against HE,
PN, and CM. In total, 2682 German control individuals without information on
food allergy originated from the HNR. HNR is a population-based cohort study for
cardiovascular disease16 comprising 4800 individuals from Ruhr area in Germany.
The GOFA replication set comprised another 380 children with food allergy and
986 unphenotyped control individuals from the SHIP, a population-based cohort
from North-Eastern Germany18. The second replication set, the Chicago Food
Allergy Study, has previously been described in detail14. This study included 671
food allergic children of European ancestry of whom 316, 291, and 217 were
allergic against PN, CM, and HE, respectively. In total, 144 non-allergic non-
sensitized normal controls and 1382 individuals of unknown phenotype (234
children and 1148 parents) served as controls. This study has been approved by the
ethics committees of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Hannover Medical
School, and the Medical Associations of Berlin and Baden-Wurttemberg. The study
protocol of the Chicago Food Allergy Study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and the
Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Written informed consent has been given by all participants or their legal
guardians.

 For each phenotype under study (FA, HE, PN, and CM), all SNPs with
moderate association in the discovery set (P < 1 × 10−3) were identified (FA 7699
SNPs, HE 8959 SNPs, PN 6794 SNPs, and CM 6955 SNPs). To define a locus, we
grouped all consecutive SNPs with P < 1 × 10−3 and a distance <1 Mb to the next
SNP (FA 611 loci, HE 634 loci, PN 595 loci, and CM 612 loci). At each locus, we
selected the SNP with the lowest P value as lead SNP. To identify additional,
independent association signals within each locus, we identified all SNPs in low LD
with the lead SNP (r2 < 0.2) and again selected the best SNP. Thus the number of
additional LD-selected SNPs was 236, 262, 223, and 233 SNPs, and the total
number of candidate SNPs selected in the GOFA discovery set were 847, 896, 818,
and 845 for the phenotypes FA, HE, PN, and CM, respectively.
In the GOFA replication set, significant association was defined as an
association with the same risk allele as in the discovery set at the Bonferroni
corrected P value (0.05/number of SNPs tested for a given phenotype). The
Bonferroni corrected significance thresholds were P < 5.9 × 10−5 for any FA, P <
5.6 × 10−5 for HE, P < 6.1 × 10−5 for PN, and P < 5.9 × 10−5 for CM. The threshold
for genome-wide significance was P < 5 × 10−8 in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1).
Variants replicating at nominal significance (P < 0.05) in the GOFA replication
set and yielding a P < 10−6 in the meta-analysis of GOFA discovery and GOFA
replication, but not reaching the Bonferroni corrected P value, were additionally
confirmed in the Chicago Food Allergy Study.
Diagnostic criteria for food allergy. According to the current guidelines, food
allergy was diagnosed based on OFC (n = 775), most of which (n = 650, 83.9%)
were conducted in a double-blind placebo controlled setting. Children with a
convincing history of an immediate, severe allergic reaction plus specific sensiti-
zation to the same food (IgE > 0.35 kU l−1) were included as cases without further
challenge (n = 127), as OFC is contraindicated due to the risk of severe allergic
reaction.
OFCs were performed in an inpatient hospital setting under physicians’
supervision. Only one food or placebo was investigated per 24 h period and was
administered in seven escalating doses at 30 min intervals. Consistent with
PRACTALL guidelines, food challenges were scored as positive if objective
cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory or cardiovascular reactions attributable to
the allergen, but not to placebo were observed15.
Diagnostic criteria for eczema. A physician’s diagnosis of eczema was made
according to standard criteria in the presence of a chronic or chronically relapsing
pruritic dermatitis with the typical morphology and distribution58, 59. More
detailed information on eczema onset in the GOFA study sets is provided in
Supplementary Note 1.
Genotyping and quality control. Samples were genotyped on Illumina’s
HumanOmniExpressExome-8 v1.2, HumanOmniExpress-12 v1.0, or
HumanOmni1-Quad v1 (Supplementary Table 9). For the discovery and the
replication set, the same QC criteria were applied. Individuals with a call rate <0.97
or with high heterozygosity (>0.35) were excluded. Individual SNPs were filtered
according to the following criteria: (i) low call rate (<0.96 in cases or controls), (ii)
low MAF <0.005 in cases or controls), (iii) genotypes out of Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE, P < 0.00001 in cases or P < 0.0001 in controls). SNPs with a
call rate lower than 0.99 were excluded if having a MAF < 0.05 or if they were out
of HWE (P < 0.001). Only SNPs fulfilling the above mentioned QC were used in
subsequent steps. Genotypes of cases and controls were recoded to the “+” strand
using the –flip command in PLINK60. Furthermore markers were deleted if allele
frequencies in the HNR control population differed by more than 0.15 compared
with the frequency in 379 Europeans available from the 1000 Genomes project.
After quality control, the GOFA discovery and GOFA replication sets included 497
(before QC 523) and 379 (before QC 380) cases as well as 2387 (before QC 2682)
and 984 (before QC 986) 1526 controls, respectively.
Imputation. Genotype imputation was performed separately for the discovery and
the replication set on the Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputationserver.
sph.umich.edu/index.html)61 using the updated Haplotype Reference Consortium
(version r1.1) panel17. Since genotyping was performed on different Illumina SNP
arrays, we used only those SNPs for imputation which were genotyped on all arrays
of a data set62. Cleaned SNP data were converted into vcf format and uploaded on
the imputation server. For phasing SHAPEIT v2 was used63, imputation was done
with minimac3. After downloading the imputed data, we performed additional
filtering steps; in both sets, we excluded SNPs with poor imputation quality (r2 <
0.5), low allele frequency (MAF<5%), and deviation from HWE (P < 10−12, in
controls).
Statistical analyses. Association analysis and population stratification control was
performed using FaST-LMM (v2.07) with imputed genotype dosages64. For each
chromosome, a relationship matrix was computed using all autosomal, genotyped
SNPs except those on the chromosome being analyzed. For conditional analyses,
allele dosages of the corresponding SNPs were included as covariates. Odds ratios
were obtained from association analysis with Mach2dat using logistic regression
with sex and the first seven principal components as covariates. Association of the
lead SNPs with food allergy dependent on the eczema status was calculated by
logistic regression with PLINK60 using sex as covariate. The genomic inflation
factor was calculated for each trait under study. P values were meta-analyzed with
METAL using the weighted Z-score method taking into account the sample size
and the effect direction65. LD between SNPs in the control population of set 1 was
calculated with PLINK60. Association analysis of the Chicago Food Allergy Study
was performed using the modified quasi-likelihood score test under an additive
genetic model.
Functional annotation. To identify potential functional variants within the food
allergy loci, we used LD link21 to identify all SNPs in high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the
lead SNPs. We subsequently used the Ensembl variant effect predictor22, and the
Genotype-Expression database (GTEx, V6p)66 to review their functional annota-
tions with respect to potential impact on protein structure, regulatory elements,
tissue-specific gene expression, and transcription factor binding.
To detect associations of the food allergy loci with gene expression levels, we
used the single nucleotide polymorphism annotator67 tool to query publically
available databases on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in relevant tissues.
If a SNP was associated with the expression of a gene in a tissue, we identified all
independent eQTLs for that gene/tissue pair. To this end, we selected the best
eQTL of the gene/tissue pair, then used LD link21 to identify all eQTLs in low LD
(r2 < 0.05) with the best SNP, and again selected the best SNP. This procedure was
performed iteratively to create a list of independent eQTLs for the gene/tissue pair.
To reduce the number of spurious co-localizations, we only report variants in high
LD with the FA lead variants that represented an independent eQTLs for the
respective gene/tissue pair. Fine mapping and functional assessment of the cytokine
gene cluster at 5q31.1 and the HLA region at 6p21 were performed in detail
previously14, 68,therefore, we only report proxy SNPs if they were predicted to have
a “high” or “moderate” impact on the functionality of the resulting protein by the
Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor22. The lead SNP at 1q21 (FLG) was excluded,
since we demonstrate that the signal was due to LD with the known loss-of-
function variants in FLG.
Estimating the heritability explained by the identified loci. The overall SNP-
based heritability was estimated with LD score regression69. From the GWAS
results on food allergy, we used a subset of 1.2 million HapMap SNPs. In order to
quantify the heritability on the liability-scale the population prevalence was set to
5%. We then adjusted the GWAS results for the effects of the five lead variants
(rs12123821 on chr. 1, rs11949166 on chr. 5, rs9273440 on chr. 6, rs2212434 on
chr. 11, and rs12964116 on chr. 18) identified in our study. Again, we estimated the
SNP-based heritability using the adjusted GWAS results. The heritability explained
by the identified lead SNPs was calculated as the difference between the unadjusted
heritability and the adjusted heritability.
