ABSTRACT
Background During adolescence, prevalence of pain and health risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use and poor mental health all rise
sharply. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between back pain and health risk factors in adolescents.
Methods Cross-sectional data from the Healthy Schools Healthy Futures study, and the Australian Child Wellbeing Project was used, mean
age: 14–15 years. Children were stratified according to back pain frequency. Within each strata, the proportion of children that reported
drinking alcohol or smoking or that experienced feelings of anxiety or depression was reported. Test-for-trend analyses assessed whether
increasing frequency of pain was associated with health risk factors.
Results Data was collected from ~2500 and 3900 children. Larger proportions of children smoked or drank alcohol within each strata of
increasing pain frequency. The trend with anxiety and depression was less clear, although there was a marked difference between the children
that reported no pain, and pain more frequently.
Conclusion Two large, independent samples show adolescents that experience back pain more frequently are also more likely to smoke, drink
alcohol and report feelings of anxiety and depression. Pain appears to be part of the picture of general health risk in adolescents.

Background
Substance use and psychological distress are causes of con-
cern in adolescents. Population-based surveys report sub-
stantial prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and illicit substance
use in teenagers in numerous countries including the USA,1
the UK2,3 and Australia.4 This is of concern because the
developing brain may be acutely susceptible to negative
influences of toxic substances, and use in early adolescence
may increase the risk of substance use disorders and mental
health problems in later life.5,6 Psychological distress, includ-
ing anxiety, stress and depression are major contributors to
the burden of disease among adolescents. Major depression,
anxiety, and conduct disorders rank third, fourth and sev-
enth of all conditions for years lived with disability in 15–19
years old.7 Similar to substance use, these conditions are not
only responsible for a concurrent burden, but are drivers of
poor health into adulthood.8 It is accepted that substance
use issues and mental health are closely related, although
causal associations are undoubtedly complex.9

 During adolescence, the prevalence of musculoskeletal
(MSK) pain (pain arising from the bones, joints or muscles)
in general, and back pain in particular rises steeply.10,11
Although often dismissed as trivial and transient, there is
mounting evidence that adolescent back pain is prevalent,12,13
associated with a large disability burden in its own right,7 and
responsible for substantial health care utilization,14 medication
usage,15 school absence,16 and interference with physical and
day-to-day activities.11 Of further concern is the fact that per-
sistent episodes of pain during adolescence appear to be
related to development of chronic pain in adulthood.17–19
Previous studies have reported associations between MSK
pain, substance use, and poor mental health, but the relation-
ships between them are unclear. Evidence from a systematic
review shows a small but robust relationship between smok-
ing and chronic back pain among teenagers.20 Studies investi-
gating the relationship between pain in adolescents and
alcohol consumption report inconsistent results including
positive associations,21,22 no association,23 and a study that
reported adolescents with pain to be less likely to drink alco-
hol.24 There is robust evidence that demonstrates links
between MSK pain and indicators of poor mental health,25
for example; between recurrent MSK pain and anxiety,26
MSK pain and internalizing (anxiety, depression, withdrawal)
and externalizing (aggression, rule-breaking) behaviours,27 as
well as evidence of mental health factors associated with, and
influencing substance use. Greater clarity is required on the
relationships between MSK pain, substance use, and poor
mental health, specifically regarding pain type, e.g. transient
pain compared to pain that is persistent.
Much of the epidemiological research into MSK pain in
children does not distinguish between the presence of ‘any’
pain, and pain that persists or is experienced frequently. This
may contribute to inconsistency in the body of literature.
Because pain is a part of everyday life, for children as with
adults, it is important to distinguish between pain of conse-
quence (e.g. persistent pain, frequent pain, or pain associated
with activity limitation, school absenteeism, health care seek-
ing) and trivial, transient episodes. Stratifying pain by fre-
quency offers one way of attempting to make this distinction.
The aim of this study was to determine whether adoles-
cents that experience back pain more frequently were also
more likely to report other indicators of adverse health risk,
e.g. alcohol use, smoking, school absenteeism and indicators
of poor mental health, e.g. depression and anxiety.
Methods
We used data from two samples of adolescents to address the
study aim. We chose to examine the study aim independently
in the two datasets as a check on generalizability of the
findings.
The Healthy Schools Health Futures study (HSHF) is a
cluster randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness
of a resilience intervention on substance use in high school
children. The HSHF trial included 32 high schools in the
Hunter New England region of NSW, Australia. Schools
were eligible if they were: (i) located in disadvantaged Local
Government Areas (score of <1000 on the SEIFA Index
of Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage) and (ii) co-
educational with at least 400 students in Years 7–10.
Comprehensive details of the study methods have been
reported elsewhere.28 At follow up for the HSHF trial in
2015, Year 9 students provided data for the current study.
Based on cultural advice processes within the project gov-
ernance, including consultation with a cultural advice
group, students identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres
Strait Islander were not asked to provide information on
pain outcomes. This was because Aboriginal students
were already receiving additional items relating to com-
munity and culture, and further addition to the survey
was not reasonable. Surveys were administered online
during class time.
Ethical approval for the original study was obtained from
the Hunter New England Health Human Research Ethics
Committee (Ref. no. 09/11/18/4.01), The University of
Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref. no. H-
2010-0029), the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research
Council (Ref. no. 776/11), the New South Wales Department
of Education and Training State Education Research
Approval Process (Ref. no. 2 008 118), and the relevant
Catholic Schools Offices. The trial is registered with the
Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (Ref.
no. ACTRN12611000606987).
The Australian Child Wellbeing Project (ACWP) is a
cross-sectional survey of Australian school children. The
ACWP is a nationally representative survey of children in
years 4, 6 and 8 conducted in 2014. Data from children
in Year 8 attending 180 government, catholic and inde-
pendent schools across all states in Australia were used
for this study. Surveys were administered online, with
audio support for children with low literacy levels.
Comprehensive details of the study methods are available
elsewhere.29
Ethical approval for the ACWP project was obtained
from the Australian Council for Educational Research,
Flinders University and the University of NSW. Further per-
missions were received from state/territorial authorities and
dioceses and participation required written informed consent
from parents and children.

 Measures
Back pain was measured slightly differently, but comparably
in the two datasets. The questions were as follows:
• HSHF: ‘In the last 6 months, how often have you had
any pain in your back?’ (never, rarely once or twice,
about every month, about every week, more than 1x/
week, about every day)
• ACWP: ‘In the last 6 months, how often have you had
backache?’ (rarely or never, about every month, about
every week, more than 1x/week, about every day)
Adverse health risk indicators were measured as per below, cre-
ation of dichotomous indicators was defined prior to analysis:
• Smoking:
o
HSHF ‘Have you smoked a cigarette in the last 4
weeks?’ (no, yes).
o
ACWP ‘On how many occasions have you smoked in
the last 30 days?’ dichotomized: never/1–2 times,
3–5, 6–9, 10–19, 20–39, 40 or more.
• Drinking:
o
HSHF ‘In the last 4 weeks, how many times have you
had 5 or more alcoholic drinks in row?’ dichotomized:
none/once, twice, 3–6 times, 7 or more times.
o
ACWP ‘On how many occasions have you been
drunk in the last 30 days?’ dichotomized: never/1–2
times, 3–5, 6–9, 10–19, 20–39, 40 or more.
• Depression:
o
HSHF ‘How much of the time during have you felt
down hearted or blue?’ dichotomized: none/a little bit
of the time, some of the time, a good bit of the time,
most of the time, all of the time.
o
ACWP ‘In the past 6 months how often have you
(had the following) feeling low?’ dichotomized: rarely
or never/about every month, about every week, more
than 1x/week, about every day.
• Anxiety:
o
HSHF ‘How much of the time during the past month
have you been a very nervous person?’ dichotomized:
none/a little bit of the time, some of the time, a good
bit of the time, most of the time, all of the time.
o
ACWP ‘In the past 6 months how often have you
(had the following) feeling nervous?’ dichotomized:
rarely or never/about every month, about every week,
more than 1x/week, about every day.
• Missed school:
o
ACWP ‘Last term how many times have you missed
school?’ dichotomized: never, hardly ever/~1x/week,
most days, every day.
We reported age, and selected sociodemographic measures
to characterize the sample.
Analysis
Data were analysed using the Mantel–Haenszel test-for-
trend using SPSS version 24. The analysis provides an indi-
cation of whether the odds of the adverse health indicators
rise incrementally with increasing frequency of pain. Analyses
were conducted separately in each dataset, and the findings
compared to provide an indication of generalizability.
Results
Sample characteristics
Characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1,
both samples are similar with respect to age, gender propor-
tion and language spoken at home. The fact that the HSHF
study preferentially recruited schools from lower socio-
economic areas is reflected in the distribution of socio-
economic status variable, frequency of back pain was also
higher in this dataset.
Primary analysis
In both the samples, the proportion of participants reporting
smoking, drinking and missing school (ACWP data only)
rose incrementally with increasing frequency of pain. The
test-for-trend was significant for all risk factors in both sam-
ples. With respect to the mental health indicators, the pro-
portion reporting feelings of depression or anxiety was
much lower in the group that never or rarely experienced
pain, but did not increase substantially in the other groups.
Test-for-trend analyses for these mental health factors were
statistically significant (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The absolute
rates for all health risks were generally higher in the HSHF
sample.
Discussion
Main findings
In both samples, more frequent back pain was associated
with adverse health risk indicators. In most cases there was
an apparent dose–response relationship as pain frequency
increased, as indicated by the significant test-for-trend find-
ings. These data indicate that back pain forms part of a
wider picture of poor health risk profile. There were key dif-
ferences between the datasets, in that the HSHF study pref-
erentially recruited schools from socioeconomic strata lower
than the Australian population norm, and that the mean age
of the HSHF sample was approximately one year older.
BACK PAIN, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

 Although the overall rate of adverse health risk indicators
and frequency of back pain report was higher in this sample,
the relationship with back pain frequency was the same.
This provides support for generalizability of the findings.
There are several potential explanations for the relation-
ships observed. These include causal pathways that flow in
either direction, the action of confounders or complex feed-
back loops between pain and the other adverse health risk
indicators. The cross-sectional structure of the data does not
allow us to explore the form of these relationships. However,
a narrow focus on aetiology may obscure important consid-
erations. Report of frequent pain appears to be a marker of
other potentially less visible issues, such as use of alcohol and
tobacco, and poor mental health. This information could be
used to identify an at-risk population to target interventions.
For adolescents seeking care for back pain, these health risk
factors may be related to poor long-term outcome of their
back complaints. While we cannot be sure that prognostic
relationships are causal, this points to a promising role for
addressing these issues in the context of their clinical care.
Conversely, it is plausible to suggest that the presence of pain
is a barrier to the effectiveness of public health interventions
aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle habits, related to physical
activity, substance use and mental health. This may point to a
place for addressing pain in the context of broader public
health interventions.
Interpretation
These findings confirm previous literature that identifies
associations between MSK pain and other indicators of poor
health and health risk. As is the situation in research in adult
populations, systematic reviews show a robust relationship
between MSK pain and indicators of poor mental health,
including depression and anxiety.11,25 There is inconsistency
with regard to reported relationships between adolescent
pain and alcohol use and tobacco. This study provides sup-
porting evidence that such an association is real, a conclu-
sion that is strengthened by the dose–response relationship
between frequency and likelihood of drinking or smoking
apparent in both datasets.
There are numerous potential explanations for the rela-
tionships between pain and health risk factors. Tobacco use
may increase pain levels via physiological pro-inflammatory
and vasoconstriction processes.30 Alternately experience of
pain may see adolescents seeking analgesic effects of sub-
stance use as has been demonstrated in adult populations.31
Further, behavioural or cultural influences may lead to both
pain report and alcohol use or smoking, e.g. a study has
shown maternal influences on self-medication behaviours
for pain management and coping in children.32 Similarly,
anxiety or depression could be a consequence of frequent
pain experience, or make pain more likely via behavioural or
cognitive processes. Socioeconomic, or genetic factors may
also provide a common explanatory pathway for psycho-
logical dysfunction and pain.
Strengths and limitations
The findings from this study come from two, relatively large
and independently collected datasets. The fact that analyses
reported similar relationships between the factors of interest
is a strength of the study. Despite the combined sample of
over 6000 participants, data was collected from only one
country, which means that findings may not generalize
beyond Australia. This may be of particular issue in coun-
tries where societal attitudes and access to alcohol and
tobacco use are different. The study also makes use only of

BACK PAIN, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

 cross-sectional data, this means that the findings are
unsuited to drawing conclusions about causal relationships.
Implications
These findings may have implications for clinical practice.
They point to the fact that adolescents with frequent pain
are at increased risk of other health problems. In the event
that these other health risks influence the prognosis of pain-
ful conditions, then addressing health-related behaviours and
mental health issues should form part of clinical manage-
ment. Even if not causally related to the course of MSK
pain, there is an argument that comprehensive health care of
the individual should include management of these factors.
In either case, screening for health-related risk behaviours
and indicators of poor mental health is indicated in adoles-
cents with frequent MSK pain.
From a research perspective this study suggests that con-
sideration of behavioural health risks, and mental health
should be incorporated into research aimed at understanding
the pathology of MSK pain in adolescents. Understanding
these relationships will also require longitudinal studies, with
careful planning of the timing of data collection. These find-
ings also point toward the potential for developing and
evaluating treatment models that integrate best-practice clin-
ical management of pain with interventions that target life-
style, health-related behaviours and mental health.33
Finally, public health interventions commonly target sub-
stance use, and mental health in children and adolescents
but they do not address pain. If it is the case that the same
children that are at-risk of poor health outcomes due to sub-
stance use and/or mental health issues are also likely to
experience pain more frequently, this may have implications
for the design and content of public health interventions.
Conclusions
Adolescents that report more frequent pain are also more
likely to report higher rates of adverse health risk behaviours
and indicators of poor mental health. Back pain may play a
role in characterizing poor overall health and risk of chronic
disease in adulthood.
