OBJECTIVES: To estimate medical expenditures attrib-
utable to older adult falls using a methodology that can
be updated annually to track these expenditures over
time.
DESIGN: Population data from the National Vital Statis-
tics
System
(NVSS)
and
cost
estimates
from
the
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System
(WISQARS) for fatal falls, quasi-experimental regression
analysis of data from the Medicare Current Beneficiaries
Survey (MCBS) for nonfatal falls.
SETTING: U.S. population aged 65 and older during 2015.
PARTICIPANTS:
Fatal
falls
from
the
2015
NVSS
(N528,486); respondents to the 2011 MCBS (N53,460).
MEASUREMENTS: Total spending attributable to older
adult falls in the United States in 2015, in dollars.
RESULTS: In 2015, the estimated medical costs attribut-
able to fatal and nonfatal falls was approximately $50.0
billion. For nonfatal falls, Medicare paid approximately
$28.9 billion, Medicaid $8.7 billion, and private and other
payers $12.0 billion. Overall medical spending for fatal
falls was estimated to be $754 million.
CONCLUSION: Older adult falls result in substantial
medical costs. Measuring medical costs attributable to
falls will provide vital information about the magnitude of
the problem and the potential financial effect of effective
prevention strategies. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:693–698, 2018.

O
lder adult falls are a common, serious, growing pub-
lic health problem. Approximately 30% of adults
aged 65 and older fall each year,1,2 and these falls often
result in serious injuries, decreases in mobility, and loss of
independence.3,4 Only one-third of those who fall seek
medical care.5 With the aging of the “boomer” generation,
the growth of the older population in the United States is
accelerating. Problems with mobility, balance, and loss of
muscle strength contribute to the likelihood of falling. In
addition, people are living longer and living with chronic
conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes melli-
tus, and arthritis. These illnesses, as well as many of the
medications used to treat them, can increase fall risk.
The high incidence, long-term effects, and costs of
falls will affect our healthcare system increasingly as time
goes on. Over the next 20 years, the number of falls and
the associated costs are projected to increase substan-
tially.6
This
study
was
designed
to
estimate
falls-
attributable medical costs using a methodology that can
be updated annually to track the effect of this rapidly
evolving public health problem.
Although a number of studies have calculated the cost
of fall injuries,7–12 the results are difficult to compare and
update. Methods for estimating the medical costs of falls
vary because of the differing methods used to identify falls
or fall injuries, the treatment facilities and populations
included, the perspective from which costs are measured
(e.g., societal, payer, provider), and variations in modeling
methods. For example, 2 recent studies estimated the
healthcare costs for falls across all types of healthcare pro-
viders.13,14 These studies used multiple data sources to
estimate the rate of falls and their associated costs, esti-
mating falls using International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis and external cause
codes. Research has shown that fall rates estimated using
ICD-9 and external codes can vary substantially based on
the combination of codes used.15 Another approach is to
include all fall costs in a defined period after a medically
treated fall by comparing fallers and nonfallers.7,8,16 These
studies have the benefit of measuring changes in costs
induced by a fall but use data specific to certain healthcare
payers and do not estimate costs for all healthcare spend-
ing associated with falls.

 In this study, we proposed a different approach for
estimating the cost of nonfatal falls using data that con-
tained comprehensive information on healthcare spending
and collected information on nonfatal falls: the Medicare
Current Beneficiaries Survey (MCBS). The MCBS includes
information on payments to hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders, including those that other data sources exclude
(e.g., payments for professional services and payments that
hospitals receive). The MCBS was used to estimate the
attributable fraction (AF) of medical expenditures associ-
ated with a reported nonfatal fall in the previous year
using the same methodology used to estimate healthcare
costs attributable to smoking17 and obesity.18 This method
treats falls as a risk factor for greater healthcare spending
and does not attempt to match falls to specific healthcare
events. These estimates were then applied to data from the
National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEAs) to derive
total healthcare expenditures associated with falls19 To
measure the cost of fatal falls, we used the Web-based
Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS)
to obtain the latest counts and costs of fatal falls. This
study produced estimates similar in magnitude to prior
estimates but can be updated annually using vital statistics
and national healthcare spending data.
METHODS AND DATA
The incidence and costs of fatal and nonfatal falls were
calculated separately because no single data source meas-
ured fatal and nonfatal falls.
Fatal Falls
The 2015 incidence and healthcare-related costs of unin-
tentional fatal falls in older adults were obtained from
WISQARS.20 Information on fatal injuries in WISQARS
comes from the National Center for Health Statistics Mul-
tiple Cause of Death (MCD) data. The MCD data are
coded using the ICD-10, with unintentional falls coded
W00-W19. Healthcare costs for fatal falls were estimated
using the WISQARS cost module that estimates healthcare
costs based on place of death (on scene or at home, dead
on arrival at hospital, emergency department, hospital
after admission, nursing home, hospice). All cases, regard-
less of location of death, were assigned the average cost of
coroner
or
medical
examiner
administration.
Deaths
recorded as having an autopsy performed had the average
costs of an autopsy added. Deaths that occurred in health-
care facilities had the average costs for facilities included
based on the diagnosis and mechanism of injury. Specific
details of how the cost estimates were developed is avail-
able elsewhere.21 All cost estimates were based on 2015
dollars.
Nonfatal Falls
The data source for the incidence and attributable cost of
nonfatal falls was the MCBS Cost and Use file. The
MCBS is a nationally representative rolling cohort survey
of Medicare beneficiaries. It combines a survey of Medi-
care beneficiaries with Medicare administrative data from
billing files that include Medicare payments for services
provided. Self-reported survey data include beneficiary
demographic characteristics, living arrangements, health
status, and physical functioning, as well as payments of
Medicare
supplemental
plans
(directly
purchased
and
employer sponsored) and Medicaid for low-income benefi-
ciaries. The survey also collects information on health
services that Medicare does not cover, most notably nurs-
ing home and other long-term care. This analysis used
data from the 2011 Cost and Use files limited dataset (the
most recent survey year of the research team’s data use
agreement).
Sample
Of the 10,901 respondents in the 2011 MCBS, 10,102
completed the section on health status and functioning.
The sample evaluated here included 3,460 individuals.
Respondents were excluded if they were younger than 65
or employed, died during the survey period, or lived in
Puerto Rico or in a long-term care facility. These exclu-
sions were made because the healthcare spending measures
were unreliable for these groups (e.g., employees may be
covered by employer insurance, and it is difficult for
employees to report how much the employer plan pays),
or full-year data were not available which might have
resulted in double counting of the fatal cost estimates
(e.g., died during the survey year). Respondents were also
excluded if they had a full year of private managed care
insurance or Medicare Advantage because the MCBS does
not report spending for these respondents because of capi-
tated payment.
Regression models of healthcare spending
To estimate the effect of falls on medical spending, we
used a regression model with total individual spending as
the dependent variable and falls and demographic, health,
and other factors as control variables. MCBS includes two
falls questions annually: “Since (last interview), have you
fallen down?” and “Since (last interview), how many
times have you fallen down?” Both falls questions are in
the Survey Health Status and Functioning file and the R61
Health Status Functioning questionnaire section. Because
the primary focus of this study was to estimate the health-
care costs attributable to all falls and not the increase in
costs as the number of falls increases, this analysis used
the first question to create a dichotomous variable repre-
senting having fallen versus not having fallen in the past
year.
Control variables included sex, race, age, income, edu-
cation, region of residence, and health status measures,
including
self-rated
health,
several
chronic
conditions
(Table 1), and body mass index. The health status meas-
ures
are
associated
with
medical
spending,
and
if
excluded, their costs could incorrectly be attributed to
falls. Regression models were estimated according to
healthcare payer category (Medicare; Medicaid (condi-
tional on having coverage from this source); private, out
of pocket, other) and service type category (hospital, phy-
sician or other health professional, dental, prescription

 drugs, other). The regression models used a generalized
linear model with a gamma distribution and a log link. In
cases in which there was a substantial percentage of obser-
vations with no expenditures (for hospital, dental, and
other service types), a 2-part model was used22 that had a
logit regression for any expenditures and a generalized lin-
ear model for expenditure level.
Attributable Fractions
The AF of medical expenditures is the percentage of total
expenditures attributable to a particular condition or risk
factor. The AF for nonfatal falls was calculated in two
steps. First, total expenditures were estimated at the
observed values of all independent variables in the regres-
sion model. Then, the hypothetical level of expenditures if
no falls had occurred was estimated, with the “any falls”
variable equal to 0 and all other independent variables left
at their observed values. The AF due to falls was calcu-
lated as: falls AF 5 (total expenditures–total expenditures
if no falls)/total expenditures.
The resulting fraction estimated the percentage of all
expenditures attributable to falls, controlling for the other
variables in the regression model. Bootstrap estimates
were replicated 1,000 times to develop a distribution of
estimates for calculating confidence intervals.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pro-
duces the NHEA annually, which provides the official
measure of total healthcare consumption in the United
States. The NHEA provides spending amounts according
to type of service (e.g., hospital care, professional services)
and source of funds (e.g., out of pocket, private health
insurance, Medicare, Medicaid)19 and provides periodic
measures of spending according to age, sex, and state of
residence. The current study used the 2013 NHEA to mea-
sure overall healthcare spending according to type of serv-
ice and source of funds and the 2012 age and sex report
to estimate the share of expenditures for persons aged 65
and older.23 A detailed description of the NHEA method-
ology is available elsewhere.24
Overall healthcare expenditure levels for the older
adult population were extrapolated from the NHEA using
a 2-step process. First, the percentage of total national
health expenditures for the population aged 65 and older
was derived from 2012 estimates,23 which are the most
recently published NHEA breakdowns according to age.
These proportions were estimated separately for each
payer and service type category used in our regression
models. Then, these proportions were multiplied by total
expenditures from the 2015 NHEA data for each payer
and service type category. These calculations can be
shown as: expenditures for aged 65 and older 5 (expendi-
tures for aged 65 and older/total expenditures in current
year)*total expenditures.
Once the estimated expenditures for the population
aged 65 and older were determined for each payer and
service type category, these expenditure amounts were
multiplied by the falls AF to estimate falls attributable
expenditures: falls attributable expenditures5 expenditures
for aged 65 and older in current year*falls AF.
Confidence intervals for the expenditure estimates
were calculated using the upper and lower confidence lim-
its of the AF estimates.
RESULTS
Fatal falls
WISQARS identified 28,486 unintentional fall deaths in
people aged 65 and older in 2015, which represented a
rate of 59.64 unintentional fall deaths per 100,000 popu-
lation aged 65 and older. The estimated medical costs
associated with these deaths were approximately $754
million in 2015.

MEDICAL COSTS OF FALLS
695
 Nonfatal falls
One-quarter of older adults reported falling in the past
year (Table 1). Of those who fell, 52.1% fell once, 21.3%
fell twice, and 24.1% fell three or more times. Those who
fell were significantly more likely to be female, Caucasian,
older, and lower income. Fallers also had significantly
lower self-rated health and reported more chronic condi-
tions. A substantial share of healthcare expenditures for
adults aged 65 and older was attributable to falls (Table
2). Approximately 6.0% of Medicare expenditures and
8.0% of Medicaid expenditures were attributable to falls.
Five percent of other sources of payment, which included
private insurance and out-of-pocket spending, was attrib-
utable to falls. These percentages suggest falls-attributable
expenditures of $28.9 billion for Medicare, $8.7 billion
for Medicaid, and $12.0 billion for other payment sources.
In 2015, total healthcare spending attributable to falls was
more than $49.5 billion. The Medicaid AF was not signifi-
cant (p<.10), which may have been because of the small
sample of persons covered (n5571).
Healthcare expenditures attributable to older adult
falls varied according to service type (Table 3); 4.4% of
hospital expenditures ($12.9 billion), 5.7% of physician
and other health professionals expenditures ($10.8 bil-
lion), and 2.0% of prescription drug expenditures ($2.1
billion) were due to falls. The “other” category had the
highest falls AF, which included spending for home health
services, long-term care facilities, and durable medical
equipment. Older adult falls accounted for 11.8% of
expenditures in this category, which represented spending
of $29.2 billion.
DISCUSSION
Older adult falls impose a large economic burden on the
U.S. healthcare system.6 The estimated costs of fatal and
nonfatal falls combined totaled approximately $50.0 bil-
lion. Almost 99% of this cost was attributable to health
care for nonfatal falls. In comparison, a 2013 estimate of
U.S. healthcare spending on medical events for specific
conditions estimated $38 billion (adjusted to 2015 dollars)
in total spending for nonfatal older adult falls.14 By apply-
ing an AF to the NHEA, the current study was able to
incorporate a more comprehensive set of healthcare costs,
including outpatient expenditures that were not directly
associated with hospitalization or an emergency depart-
ment visit.
This study estimated that Medicare spending attribut-
able to nonfatal older adult falls totaled $28.9 billion.
This estimate is consistent with estimates from prior stud-
ies of $30.8 billion to $34.5 billion (adjusted to 2015 dol-
lars) and validates the approach used here.13,25 Previous
studies have used methodology similar to that of the cur-
rent study and estimated Medicare costs for other causes
of disease that are comparable with ours. For example,
one previous study18 estimated that Medicare expenditures
attributable to obesity were $39 billion (data inflated to
2015 dollars from published 2008 estimate). Another
study17 estimated Medicare costs attributable to smoking
of $48 billion (data inflated to 2015 dollars from pub-
lished 2010 estimate), although the obesity and smoking
estimates
included
all
persons
covered
by
Medicare
(including disabled persons aged <65), not only older
adults, as in our estimates.
The methodology used here estimated total health
expenditures for falls across all payers and provides a
more comprehensive picture of the economic burden of
falls. Only two datasets, the MCBS and the NHEA, were
required
to
produce
the
estimate
for
nonfatal
falls.
Because the NHEA is updated annually, this method can
be used for yearly healthcare cost estimates for older adult
falls. Approximately 10,000 Americans turn 65 each day26
and people aged 85 and older are the fastest growing seg-
ment of the older population27 and those at highest risk of
falls.1 Therefore, the economic burden from falls is likely
to increase substantially in the coming years.1 Monitoring
cost trends is important, because 75% of the cost of older
adult falls is financed through public health insurance pro-
grams that are already financially stressed.14
This study is subject to several limitations. The coding
of cause of death for fatal falls may have varied across
jurisdictions.28 Healthcare costs for fatal falls were derived
from secondary sources based on average cost per case.
Nonfatal falls were treated as a risk factor for greater

 health care spending and were estimated using regression
modelling. If the likelihood of falls was correlated with
comorbid conditions not in our model or unobserved indi-
vidual characteristics in our sample, the fall AF estimates
would be biased. The study applied the falls AF based on
community-dwelling older adults who had fee-for-service
Medicare coverage and were not currently employed to all
older adult health expenditures. Excluded groups, such as
those with Medicare Advantage plans or who were institu-
tionalized, could have different fall rates and healthcare
costs. Applying the falls AF to subsequent years of health-
care expenditure data assumed that the AF was constant
over time. Summation of expenditures according to service
category produced an estimate of total expenditures that
was
approximately
12%
larger
than
the
total
when
summed according to payer type ($55.4 billion). It is likely
that this discrepancy is due to the nonlinear models used
to estimate the AFs. Somewhat different results were pro-
duced when summing across different category definitions,
although the service category total was within the confi-
dence interval of the payer category total (and vice versa).
Finally, many costs of older adult falls are not addressed
here, such as poor quality of life and costd to informal
caregivers.
Preventive strategies that reduce falls in older adults
could lead to a substantial reduction in healthcare spend-
ing. Evidence-based strategies including medication man-
agement and strength and balance exercises (e.g., tai chi),
have been associated with reductions in older adult falls.29
Strength and balance programs usually charge the partici-
pant, although some Medicare Advantage plans cover
some of these programs. Multifactorial interventions, often
conducted in clinical settings, address multiple fall risk
factors. These types of interventions have been shown to
reduce falls as much as 24%.29 Screening and assessing
for falls risk is one of the minimum requirements for the
Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, with no beneficiary
charge. Medicare also reimburses medication review by a
pharmacist, but most healthcare providers do not routinely
screen patients for falls or conduct fall factor risk assess-
ments to identify individuals who would benefit from pre-
vention strategies.30
To help healthcare providers implement the American
Geriatrics Society’s and British Geriatrics Society’s clinical
guidelines for the prevention of older adult falls, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Injury Center
developed the Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Inju-
ries (STEADI) initiative, which incudes screening older
adults to identify their fall risk, assessing at-risk individuals
to identify their modifiable fall risk factors, and intervening
by using effective strategies to reduce fall risk factors.
Clinical care is an important component of falls pre-
vention. By broadly implementing and scaling up initia-
tives like STEADI, we can improve health and decrease
the future economic burden of older adult falls.
