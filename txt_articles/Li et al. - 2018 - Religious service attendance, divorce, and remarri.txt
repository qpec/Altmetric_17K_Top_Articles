Abstract
Prior research has suggested religious participation can promote marital satisfaction and
stability. However, current literature has mainly focused on early life divorce, and used
cross-sectional data, leaving open the question of the directionality of effects. We evaluated
the prospective associations between service attendance and marital stability in mid and
late life considering either 1) divorce or separation; or 2) remarriage, as separate outcomes.
Data were drawn from the Nurses’ Health Study, a large prospective cohort study that con-
sisted of US female nurses in their 50s at study enrollment, with repeated measures of ser-
vice attendance and marital status over 14 years of follow-up from 1996–2010. During
follow up, among 66,444 initially married nurses who were mainly Christians, frequent ser-
vice attendance was associated with 50% lower risk of divorce (95% CI: 32%, 63%), and
52% lower risk of either divorce or separation (95%CI: 37%, 63%). Among initially divorced
or separated women, frequent service attendance was not associated with subsequent like-
lihood of remarriage; however, among widowed women, women who attended services fre-
quently had 49% increased likelihood of remarriage (95% CI: 13%, 97%) compared to those
women who did not. The study provides evidence that in this cohort of US nurses, frequent
service attendance is associated with lower risk of becoming divorced in mid- and late- life,
and increased likelihood of remarriage among widowed nurses, but not among divorced or
separated nurses.
Introduction
The United States is a religious country. The Pew Research center reported that 92% U.S.
adults in 2007 and 89% U.S. adults in 2012 believe in God, with a majority (71%) identifying as
Christian [1]. Religion plays an important role in marriage and church attendance has been
shown to be a strong predictor for remaining married versus divorcing [2]. Marriage, either
marriage cohesiveness or divorce, are a special case of social groups cohesiveness [2],

 conferring psychological and economic benefits to couples and society [3–5]. However, despite
these positive perspectives on marriage, the crude marriage rate declined from 8.2 per 1,000
total population in 2000 to 6.9 in 2015 [6]. Divorce rates have fallen somewhat over this time,
with 4.0 per 1,000 reported in 2000 which declined to 3.1 in 2015 [6, 7]. Divorce rates in mid-
dle aged groups however doubled from 1990 to 2010 [8, 9]. There is some evidence that the
tendency for divorced men and women, particularly aged 50 years older, to get remarried has
increased in recent years [7, 10, 11]. Prior research has mainly focused on early-life divorces
[7, 9, 12–14]. There is limited evidence on subsequent re-marriage among the increasingly
growing group of late life divorcees. The baby boomers in the U.S. are now in mid- to late- life.
With late-life divorce rate doubling in recent years, there is a need to better understand divorce
and remarriage for mid- and late- life women [13, 15].
Classic Durkheimian theory suggests that the institutions of religion contribute to human
well-being, fostering and supporting marriage; and married couples who are religious may be
happier and more satisfied with life [7–11, 16–23]. Marriage may be viewed as an end in itself,
but is also associated longitudinally with better physical and mental health and greater life sat-
isfaction [4, 5, 24–34]. Although marital conflicts can sometimes seem irreconcilable, interven-
tions, counseling, or shared activity that might be available earlier in the relationship, when
problems first begin to develop, could be effective ways to prevent divorce and promote well-
being [12, 35]. Current evidence on service attendance and the likelihood of remarriage after
widowhood or separation is sparse. It is unclear whether religious service attendance is associ-
ated with subsequent likelihood of remarriage generally, and whether this depends on whether
the marriage ended or someone was widowed.
In addition, other research has suggested religious participation can play an important role
in promoting strong marital bonds, happiness, and stability [35–40]. On the other hand, reli-
gious attendance and affiliation may operate as a barrier to divorce [41, 42]. Religious service
attendance might affect marital stability because of religious teaching of marriage as sacred,
teachings against divorce, a place to meet other couples and families, and programs, counsel-
ing and retreats that support marriage and family life. Religious affiliation may affect family
life because of different teachings and practices concerning marriage, divorce, and remarriage
[35, 38]. Literature on remarriage has suggested that there are significant denominational sub-
cultural variations for remarriage among Americans [15]. For example, conservative Protes-
tants are most likely to remarry and least likely to cohabit [15, 43]. Moreover, remarriage after
a divorce may be viewed less favorably than remarriage after widowhood or separation by
some religious denominations [15, 35, 38]. Despite many qualitative studies that have exam-
ined religious participation, affiliation and marriage, the quantitative assessment of the joint
effects of religious service attendance and religious affiliation on marriage is currently unclear.
Here we will examine differences comparing Catholic and Protestant denominations.
A number of methodological concerns limit research to date in the field of religion and
marriage. Most existing studies on religion and marital status have used cross-sectional data
[40, 44, 45], which may be subject to reverse causation issues with divorce itself affecting subse-
quent service attendance [46]. Data from prospective cohort studies on the interrelationship
between religion and marital status over time are sparse [38, 39, 47]. Contemporary data with
longer follow up are needed. Prior research has also included only a limited set of potential
confounders when examining these associations, leaving open the strong possibility of unmea-
sured and residual confounding. For example, most covariates considered in prior studies
focused on socio-economic related variables. Health and lifestyle related information, such as,
parity (number of times that the nurse has given birth), depression, or good physical function,
were not available. Various lifestyle factors may affect both service attendance and marital con-
flict and stability, thereby confounding the association [25, 48–52]. In addition, existing

 literature has not taken into account prior religious service attendance, to further rule out
issues of reverse causation.
To address these gaps in knowledge, we conducted a more rigorous test of the hypothesis
that frequent religious service attendance is associated with a lower likelihood of divorce, and
increased likelihood of remarriage among nurses in mid- to late- life. Using data from a large
prospective cohort study of 66,444 US female nurses who were mainly Christians, we tested
the following two hypotheses: 1) frequent religious service attendance is associated with lower
subsequent odds of divorce or separation; and 2) frequent religious service attendance is asso-
ciated with higher likelihood of remarriage. We also evaluated these associations by Catholic
versus Protestant affiliation to assess the joint effects of attendance and affiliation.
Materials and methods
The Nurses’ Health Study
Our study sample was from the Nurses’ Health Study which began in 1976 when 121,700 mar-
ried female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years, completed a mailed questionnaire about
their medical history, dietary and lifestyle habits. They resided in 1 of 11 US states with the
largest number of registrants (New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, Michigan, Texas, Florida, Connecticut, and Maryland). Among those invited, 71.2%
participants returned the questionnaire. The overall NHS in 1976 was 98% white, with a rela-
tively higher socioeconomic status. While this limits generalizability, the homogeneity does
enhance the interval validity of the NHS, as does also the high quality data as well as high fol-
low-up rates [53].
Follow-up questionnaires were sent every 2 years, with follow-up for more than 90% the
cohort remaining complete. Data on service attendance was available starting in 1992, 1996
and every four years subsequently; for these analyses we thus restricted the study population to
nurses who were currently married in 1996 and also reported their religious service attendance
information in 1996 (n = 66,444). For analyses on remarriage, we restricted the study popula-
tion to nurses who were divorced (n = 7,311), separated (n = 986), or widowed (n = 21,372) in
1996 and also reported their religious service attendance information in 1996. Follow up data
for these women is available through 2010. The Nurses’ Health Study was approved by the
Brigham and Women’s hospital and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health Institutional
Review Board of (Boston, MA).
Ascertainment of religious service attendance and religious affiliation
Information on religious service attendance was collected from self-administered question-
naires in 1992 and 1996, and every four years subsequently. The study participants were asked,
“How often do you go to religious meetings or services?” Response categories included “more
than once a week, once a week, 1–3 times per month, less than once per month, never or
almost never.” Previous literature suggested that even though religious service attendance
tends to be over-reported, it is still a good indicator of communal religious practice [54].
Moreover, relative rank ordering across frequency may still be preserved.
Religious affiliation was self-reported, with a majority of the NHS participants being Protes-
tant or Catholic. Due to small numbers in other religious group in our study sample, we
restricted our analyses on religious affiliation to women who reported being either “Protes-
tant” or “Catholic”.
Religious service attendance was modeled as four categories: “more than once a week, once
a week, less than once per week, never or almost never.”

 Ascertainment of divorce or separation
The NHS participants self-reported their marital status every four years from 1992 to 2010. We
defined a divorce as the study participant self-reporting any divorce event during the follow up
period from 1996 to 2010 (ever been divorced, yes or no) and evaluated both the presence and
timing of such [55, 56]. Divorce or separation was defined by self-report as either divorce or
separation during 1996–2010 (either being divorced or separated, yes or no). During the fol-
low-up period, we identified 685 total events for self-reported divorce, and 924 total events for
self-reported divorce or separation.
Ascertainment of remarriage
We defined a remarriage event as women who previously reported being divorced, separated,
or widowed at baseline 1996, but self-reported being currently married in any of the follow-up
questionnaires from 2000 until 2010. Widowhood information was obtained through women’s
self-reported questionnaire. We categorized remarriage among four groups of women: 1) all
previously married women who self-reported as unmarried for any reason (i.e., divorced or
separated or widowed) in 1996; 2) only women who self-reported being divorced in 1996; 3)
only women who self-reported being separated in 1996; and 4) only women who self-reported
as widows in 1996.
Covariates
Potential confounders for the association between religious service attendance and marital sta-
tus (divorce, remarriage) were selected a priori based on the literature and subject knowledge
[57, 58]. We included the socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants, includ-
ing husband’s education, median family income, geographic region, and unemployment in the
past two years. We also evaluated lifestyle and health characteristics that associated with service
attendance and marriage, self-reported prior religious attendance frequency (never, < 1/week,
> 1/week in 1992), and prior divorce history (yes, no). We included the following various
health-related lifestyle factors and health conditions because health may affect both service
attendance and marital conflict and stability: alcohol consumption and healthy eating index
measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire, good physical or function measured by
the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), depression measured by the Center for Epide-
miologic Studies Depression -10 Scale, parity (number of times that the nurse has given birth),
physical exercise, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, menopausal status and
postmenopausal hormone use, physical exam in the past 2 years, smoking status, pack-years,
and body mass index (BMI). Prior history of divorce was defined as “ever reported divorce in
the past 20 years (1976–1996 (our analytic baseline)).
Statistical analyses
The primary exposure was religious service attendance in 1996, with prior attendance in 1992
controlled for as a covariate in an effort to mitigate concerns about reverse causation. Cox pro-
portional hazard model and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the longitudi-
nal association between the 1996 service attendance and likelihood of divorce/separation over
the follow-up period. Model 1 was age adjusted. Model 2, the fully adjusted model, included
baseline religious service attendance level in 1992, demographics (age, husband’s education,
median family income, geographic region, unemployed in past two years, prior history of
divorce), health conditions (parity (Number of times that nurses has given birth to a fetus with a
gestational age of 24 weeks or more), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes,

 menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, physical function, depression status), health
lifestyle behaviors (smoking status, pack years, physical exercise, alcohol consumption, healthy
diet, physical exam in past 2 years, BMI). For Cox model, we also adjusted for calendar year
and questionnaire cycle. We tested proportional hazard assumption by adding an interaction
term between services attendance and time.
We performed interaction subgroup analyses comparing self-identified Protestants and
Catholics. Specifically, we evaluated interaction both on multiplicative and additive scales
(using the relative excess risk due to interaction) [59, 60]. As a sensitivity analyses, we further
used propensity score subclassification by quintiles to obtain effect estimates (comparing ever
vs. never service attendance). We also assessed how substantial unmeasured confounding (for
example, unmeasured marital status of the nurses’ parents in childhood) would have to be to
explain away the associations [46].
Results and discussion
Association of religious service attendance with subsequent divorce
Of 66,444 women who were currently married at baseline year 1996, 924 of them became
either divorced (n = 685), or separated (n = 239) from 1996–2010. Compared to women who
never attended religious services, those who attended more than once per week in 1996 had
lower prevalence of depression, drank less alcohol in midlife, were less likely to be current
smoker, and less likely to be nulliparous (Table 1). The majority of our study participants were
Caucasian (98%, S1 Table).
Compared to women who never attended religious services, those who attended services
more than once per week were 42% less likely to get divorced, or 47% less likely to get either
divorced or separated (HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44–0.74, p trend <0.0001 for divorce only,
HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.42–0.67, p trend <0.0001 for divorce or separation, Table 2). Results
were similar using propensity score stratification by quintiles (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.41–0.69
for divorce only, HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.39–0.62 for divorce or separation). We also found simi-
lar results when using logistic regression mode (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37–0.68, p trend
<0.0001 for divorce only, OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37–0.63, p trend <0.0001 for divorce or sepa-
ration, S2 Table).
In our study, we did not have information on duration of current marriage, which may be a
potential unmeasured confounder. This is so because there is some evidence that religious peo-
ple tend to marry young, and divorce rate varies by marriage duration. However, for unmea-
sured confounding to explain away the odds ratio estimate of 0.50 for divorce, an unmeasured
confounder associated with both divorce and regular religious service attendance by risk ratios
of 3.4-fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could do so but weaker con-
founding could not. For an unmeasured confounder to bring the upper confidence limit of
0.68 for this estimate above 1, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both
divorce and regular service attendance by risk ratios of 2.3-fold each could do so, but weaker
confounding could not. Similar substantial confounding would be needed to explain away the
other estimates.
We further examined the joint effects of service attendance and religious affiliation. We
found multiplicative interaction for divorce. Attending religious services once or more per
week was associated with 52% lower (95% CI: 40%-66%) likelihood of divorce for Catholics,
but only a 32% lower (95% CI: 10%-43%) likelihood of divorce for Protestants (p-value for
multiplicative interaction = 0.02). The large effect size for Catholics was in part due to the
higher likelihood of divorce for those not attending (Table 3, S3 Table).

 Association of religious service attendance with subsequent remarriage
During the follow-up from 1996–2010, we identified 1567 remarriage events among women
who had divorced, separated, or widowed in 1996, with a total of 723 events among women
divorced in 1996, 197 events among women separated in 1996, and 695 events among women
widowed in 1996.
Women who attended religious services once per week or more, and who were widows in
1996, had significantly higher likelihood of remarriage (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.52–2.80, p for
trend � 0.001, Table 4), but those who were divorced or separated did not. Results were similar
using logistic regression model (S4 Table) or propensity score subclassification by quintiles
(OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.17–1.93 for remarriage after widowhood; OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.70–1.20
for remarriage after divorce, OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.44–1.25 for remarriage after separation). In

 remarriage, there was perhaps some indication that Catholics regularly attending religious ser-
vices were less likely to remarry than Protestants when results were aggregated over divorced,
widowed, and separated women (Table 5, S5 Table). Among women who attended services
once or more per week, Catholics had 34% lower likelihood of remarriage than Protestants
(95% CI: 22%-45%; p value for multiplicative interaction = 0.09, p value for additive
interaction = 0.06).
Discussion
In this large prospective cohort study of 66,444 married U.S. nurses with 14 years of follow up
from mid to late life, and repeated measurements of service attendance to allow for control of
prior service attendance, nurses who attended religious service more than once per week had a
50% lower likelihood of subsequent divorce or separation, compared to those who never
attend. Among widowed nurses, those who attended services more than once per week had a
49% higher likelihood of remarriage, compared to those who never attended services. How-
ever, for divorced or separated -nurses, religious service attendance was not significantly asso-
ciated with the likelihood of remarriage. We found the associations between religious service
attendance divorce, and remarriage were stronger for Catholics than Protestants.

 Existing research on religion and marriage has mainly focused on early-life divorces [7, 9,
12–14]. Currently little is known regarding late life marriage, divorce and remarriage. Given
the increasingly growing group of late life divorcees and with the late-life divorce rate doubling
in recent years, there is a need to advance our understanding regarding divorce and remarriage
for mid- and late- life women [13, 15]. Social science literature on religiosity and marital status
has been based mostly on two measures of religious participation: service attendance [16, 47,
61–64] and religious affiliation [16, 57, 58, 65]. Religious service attendance might affect
divorce and remarriage because of religious teaching of marriage as sacred, marriage counsel-
ing, and providing a place to meet other couples and families, and support family life. There is
evidence that religiosity reduces the likelihood of marital infidelity among these couples, and
may further indirectly reduce the likelihood of subsequent divorce by increasing levels of

 marital satisfaction [36]. Religious service attendance had previously been shown to be predic-
tive of stronger marital bonds, greater marital happiness, and stability [38, 66]. In our study,
we found that among a group of US nurses in their 50s, those who attended religious services
more than once per week had a 50% lower likelihood of subsequent divorce or separation,
compared to those who never attend. Our results on associations between service attendance
and divorce are consistent with findings from previous research [7, 38, 67]. We expanded
prior literature on this by focusing on mid and late life marriage and divorce.
Evidence on religious participation and late life divorce is sparse, but the literature on stud-
ies of remarriage after divorce or widowhood are even more limited [15, 68–70]. Remarriage is
a complex and understudied process [71, 72]. Bohannan proposed six important developmen-
tal tasks of remarriage including emotional, psychic, community, parental, economic, and
legal aspects of remarriage [71]. Compared with first marriages, remarriage has its own distinct
assortative mating patterns and gender specific dynamics [73, 74]. For a first marriage, both
men and women emphasize spousal economic status as a valuable trait; however, for remar-
riage, high-status men tend to marry less-educated, young women regardless of economic sta-
tus [73].
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior study focused on the link between
religion and remarriage in mid- and late- life, a period in which most divorces/remarriage
occurs. Only one study has prospectively examined the effects of religion on remarriage, but
was focused on young adulthood [15]. The authors reported a positive association between
religious service attendance and likelihood of remarriage among American women aged 15–
44 years, and reported differences in religious affiliations [15]. However, this study was based
on pooling of two cross-sectional surveys in 1988 and 1994. It is unknown whether this obser-
vation is still true with longitudinal data, longer follow-up, and among contemporary elderly
Americans. Our study provided evidence by using a prospective cohort design with contempo-
rary data 1996–2010, repeated measurements of service attendance and marital status, and
controlling for past service attendance in an effort to rule out possible reverse causation [46,
75]. In our study, we were able to examine these associations among US nurses in their 50’s, an
age group of women that has previously been understudied. We found that among widowed
nurses, those who attended services more than once per week had a 49% higher likelihood of
remarriage, compared to those who never attended services. However, the associations were
not significant for those women who were divorced or separated. Religion may place a certain
stigma on divorce [67]. Catholic teaching prohibits remarriage after divorce, unless an annul-
ment of the prior marriage takes place. Such teachings may in part contribute to the lower rate
of divorce, but may also help explain the result that service attendance is only associated with
high likelihood of remarriage for those who are widowed but not for those who are divorced
or separated [76]. Another possible explanation is that women who experience a divorce or
separation event may have been extremely unhappy in marriage, and thus less likely to enter a
marriage again. In contrast, a woman who is a widow may benefit from the support from reli-
gious community, and may be more willing to remarry.
Strengths of our study include large sample size, prospective cohort design, long duration
of follow-up, availability of repeated measures of marital status and religious service atten-
dance, extensive covariates control, with over a 90% follow-up rate. We provided long-term
evidence on religion, divorce, and remarriage among contemporary Americans. In our study,
we were able to examine these associations among US nurses in their 50’s, an age group of
women that has previously been understudied. Our study sample included only U.S. nurses
and consisted mostly of Caucasian healthcare professionals. Compared with the general popu-
lation, they generally have higher levels of education and socioeconomic status. Our results
may not therefore be generalizable to the overall general population in the US, and women in

 other race/ethnicity, age, and cultural groups. However, this relative homogenous group does
ensure excellent internal validity of our study. Further, our sensitivity analysis suggested that
the results were robust to potential unmeasured confounding, such as marital duration.
Although our study was an observational study, we adjusted for a number of major potential
confounders of the association between religious service attendance and divorce. The results
from sensitivity analyses were relatively robust. Another strength of our study is that we have
detailed lifestyle factor information and were able to additionally account for the confounding
factors by these variables, such as depression, and good physical function, as literature has sug-
gested that marriage promotes health and healthy behavior which may in turn affect marital
stability.
Existing literature suggests the following variables are relevant predictors for divorce: mar-
rying as a teenager, poverty, unemployment, low education, living with one’s future spouse or
another partner prior to marriage, having a premarital birth, bringing children from a previous
union into a new marriage, inter-racial marriage, and growing up in a household without two
continuously married parents [2, 7, 77]. We did not have data on all of these and some of these
might also be related to religious service attendance. Introducing unmeasured confounding
For example, religious participation is also associated with earlier timing of marriage [78]:
those who attend religious services more frequently and those who report religion being
important are more likely to get married at a younger age [79], which is itself a risk factor for
divorce. In our study, we did not have detailed information about the duration of a study par-
ticipant’s current marriage, and age at first marriage. However, we did perform sensitivity
analyses to assess how strong unmeasured confounding would have to be to explain away the
observed association. For an unmeasured confounder to explain away the association of ser-
vice attendance with divorce, an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with
both divorce and regular religious service attendance by risk ratios of 3.4-fold each, above and
beyond the measured covariates. Such substantial confounding by unmeasured factors seems
very unlikely given adjustment for an extensive set of covariates and relatively homogenous
study population in the NHS study.
Our study is subject to certain other limitations as well. First, men and women perceive
marriage differently. Previous studies have suggested that there is a gender difference in per-
ceptions of martial problems [7] and attitudes toward remarriage. The association we observed
between religiosity and divorce/remarriage might be gender-specific. Our study focused on
wives’ religious participation only. Currently, very few studies have information regarding the
religiosity of both spouses, and joint service attendance [38, 80]. Future studies on religious
participation and divorce/remarriage specifically for men, and for men and women jointly are
needed. Second, service attendance in our study was self-reported but this has been widely
used in the sociology literature and may at least preserve relative ordering of attendance. In
our study, marital status was measured through self-reported questionnaire. For women who
experienced both divorce and remarriage events within a 4-year interval, we were not be able
to capture these events and may have misclassified them as remaining married. However, such
misclassifications are probably rare. In the NHS, information was not collected regarding
whether the couples were of the same sex. At the time of the NHS study baseline, same-sex
couple were likely not common among married women and such misclassification would
likely be rare. Third, religiosity is a multi-dimensional construct. One single measure of service
attendance does not capture other aspects of religiosity, such as beliefs in religious teaching,
personal spirituality, and practices of prayer or joint prayer with one’s spouse. In our study,
religious affiliation information was collected through self-report and we could not separate
out Protestants into conservative and mainline Protestants, as more specific groups may have
heterogeneous effects. Further, the majority of our study participants reported being

 “Protestant” or “Catholic”, and very few women reported being in other religious groups. Our
results may not generalizable to people with different cultural backgrounds, and religious
beliefs. Fourth, some have argued that even though religiosity and religious service attendance
may increase marital quality, and decrease marital problems [81], it may also increase the
stigma associated with divorce [7] and perhaps thereby further decreases the likelihood of
divorce [82]. In our study among US female nurses, we did not have marital quality and satis-
faction information and it is possible that some women remained married despite low satisfac-
tion with their marriage [83]. Future studies are needed to examine the association between
frequency of religious service attendance, divorce stigma, and marital quality and satisfaction.
Future studies on both spouses are still needed.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in this prospective cohort study of U.S. female nurses over a 14-year period of fol-
low-up from mid- to late- life, we found that frequent religious services attendance halved the
risk of divorce among married women. Additionally, frequent religious service attendance was
also associated with increased likelihood of remarriage among widowed women, but not for
divorced or separated women. Future studies on religion and divorce/remarriage are needed
with other religious beliefs other than Christianity, with other dimensions of religiosity, informa-
tion on both couples, and the incorporation of information on marital satisfaction and quality.
