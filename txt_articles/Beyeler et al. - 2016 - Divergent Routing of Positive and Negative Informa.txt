SUMMARY
Although the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is known
to play a critical role in the formation of memories
of both positive and negative valence, the coding
and routing of valence-related information is poorly
understood. Here, we recorded BLA neurons during
the retrieval of associative memories and used op-
togenetic-mediated phototagging to identify popu-
lations of neurons that synapse in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), the central amygdala (CeA), or
ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that despite
heterogeneous neural responses within each popu-
lation, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited
by reward predictive cues and of BLA-CeA neurons
excited by aversion predictive cues were higher
than within the entire BLA. Although the BLA-
vHPC projection is known to drive behaviors of
innate negative valence, these neurons did not
preferentially code for learned negative valence.
Together, these findings suggest that valence en-
coding in the BLA is at least partially mediated via
divergent activity of anatomically defined neural
populations.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to appropriately recognize stimuli imbued with either
positive or negative valence is critical for survival as well as
mental health. The neural circuits underlying the assignment
of valence to environmental stimuli are thought to be highly
conserved in the mammalian brain (Janak and Tye, 2015) and
are
dysfunctional
in
psychopathologies
including
anxiety,
depression, and addiction (Allsop et al., 2014; Etkin and Wager,
2007; Lammel et al., 2014; Mervaala et al., 2000; Tye et al.,
2011, 2013). Distributed and interconnected brain structures
have been tied to valence coding (Berridge and Robinson,
2003; Namburi et al., 2015a; Nieh et al., 2013), but real-time dy-
namics within circuits processing valence information during
behavioral selection remain largely unexplored. The basolateral
complex of the amygdala (BLA) receives inputs from multiple
sensory modalities (Bordi and LeDoux, 1992; Fontanini et al.,
2009; McDonald, 1998; Pitka
¨ nen, 2000) and neurons therein
respond to cues of both positive and negative valence (Paton
et al., 2006; Shabel and Janak, 2009). However, the BLA con-
tains a diversity of neurons projecting to different downstream
targets (Pitka
¨ nen, 2000) known to drive opposing behaviors
(i.e., approach and avoidance, Namburi et al., 2015b; Stuber
et al., 2011), and the naturally occurring firing patterns of these
distinct subsets of BLA neurons during information processing
remain unknown.
Previous evidence suggests that valence assignment during
memory retrieval is supported by differences in real-time activity
among anatomically defined populations of BLA neurons. The
BLA and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in
the formation of cue-reward associations (Ambroggi et al.,
2008; Namburi et al., 2015b; Tye et al., 2008) and optogenetic
activation of BLA terminals in the NAc drives positive reinforce-
ment (Britt et al., 2012; Stuber et al., 2011). By contrast, the
assignment of negative valence has been linked to BLA projec-
tions to the central amygdala (CeA; Amorapanth et al., 1999;
Ciocchi et al., 2010; Goosens and Maren, 2001), and disconnec-
tion between the BLA and the CeA abolishes fear responses to
cues associated with an aversive outcome (Jimenez and Maren,
2009). Valence processing in the BLA may also mediate innate
emotional states; both the BLA and the ventral hippocampus
(vHPC) are linked to anxiety (Adhikari, 2014; Etkin et al., 2009;
Somerville et al., 2004) and optogenetic activation of BLA termi-
nals in the vHPC increases anxiety-related behaviors (Felix-Ortiz
et al., 2013).
We recently showed that projection-target-defined popula-
tions of BLA neurons play distinct roles in valence learning (Nam-
buri et al., 2015b). However, the real-time activity and mecha-
nisms by which the BLA produces distinct emotional and
motivational states have yet to be identified.
Here, we hypothesized that during the retrieval of positive or
negative associative memories, opposite valences are encoded
by anatomically divergent BLA circuits. Using an intersectional,
dual-virus approach, we employed optogenetic-mediated ‘‘pho-
totagging’’ in combination with large-scale in vivo electrophysio-
logical recordings to reveal the specific neural code of BLA

 neurons that synapse in the NAc, CeA, or vHPC, in response to
the presentation of cues associated with either rewarding or
aversive outcomes.
RESULTS
Optogenetic-Mediated Photoidentification of BLA
Projection Neurons during Retrieval
In order to ‘‘photoidentify’’ distinct populations of BLA neu-
rons, we used a dual-virus approach to express the light-acti-
vated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in a subpop-
ulation of BLA neurons, defined by axonal termination within a
specific downstream region (NAc, CeA, or vHPC; Figure 1A).
To this end, we used an anterograde viral vector carrying a
construct allowing for cre-dependent ChR2 expression in the
BLA and a retrograde viral vector carrying cre-recombinase
in the downstream target (see Experimental Procedures;
Nieh et al., 2015; Senn et al., 2014). This strategy allows
specific targeting and identification of BLA neurons terminat-
ing in the region of interest and avoids spurious identification
of BLA neurons sending axons of passage through this region,
which is a shortcoming of electrical and optical antidromic
stimulation. So that we could evaluate the activity of photoi-
dentified cells during valence retrieval, we trained mice to
discriminate between two auditory stimuli: one associated
with a rewarding outcome of positive valence (sucrose) and
the second associated with an aversive outcome of negative
valence (quinine; Figures 1B and 1C). After mice learned the
reward predictive significance of the conditioned stimulus
associated with sucrose delivery (CS-S), as indicated by
licking after tone onset and before the delivery of sucrose
(Figures 1C and 1D), we introduced a second auditory condi-
tioned stimulus (CS-Q) associated with the delivery of a bitter
tastant (quinine; Figure 1B). Mice initially generalized the two
tones, exhibiting licking responses for both the CS-S and
CS-Q, and progressively learned to discriminate between the
two stimuli (Figure 1E; Movie S1). When the mice reached
performance criteria for the sucrose association (at least
70% of sucrose deliveries collected during the session) and
for the quinine association (at least 70% of quinine deliveries
avoided during the session), we performed acute recordings
in the BLA over 2 successive days in 21 animals (Figures
1D–1G and S1).
Half of BLA Neurons Respond to Sucrose and/or Quinine
Cues
To determine the functional response profiles of BLA neurons,
we performed recordings with silicon optrodes (Figure 2A), and
analyzed neural data after histological confirmation of the place-
ment of the recording electrodes and of the spread of viral
expression (Figures 1G, S1, and S2A). During each recording
session, �30 sucrose and �30 quinine trials were presented,
and the firing rate of every isolated unit was analyzed in response
to the two cues. Of the 1,626 neurons recorded in the BLA, 50%
of the neurons were task responsive, meaning that they showed
a significant firing rate change in response to one or both cues
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.01; Figures 2B–2D; Table
S1). 28% of neurons significantly changed firing rate selectively
during the conditioned stimulus associated with sucrose (CS-S)
and 9% selectively during the conditioned stimulus associated
with quinine (CS-Q). 13% of the units significantly changed their
firing rate in response to both cues in a qualitatively similar
manner (either excitatory or inhibitory responses), which we
termed the ‘‘same’’ way, and less than one percent changed
their firing rate in response to both cues in qualitatively distinct
directions, which we termed ‘‘opposite’’ ways (Figure 2C).
When averaging the proportion of cells responding with excita-
tion or inhibition within the three categories (responsive to the
CS-S only, responsive to the CS-Q only, and responsive to
both cues in the same way), we found that 53% ± 2% of the units
showed excitatory responses, while 47% ± 2% showed inhibi-
tory responses (Figure 2E, illustrated as percentage of total
units).
We also tested the response of each unit to the uncondi-
tioned stimulus (US; Figure S2) and found that 32% of the units
responding to the CS also significantly changed their firing rate
during the first 500 ms after the delivery of the US (sucrose or
quinine), while 18% responded to the US without changing
their firing rate to the cues (Figures S2C and S2D). Overall,
50% of the units responded to the delivery of the US (Fig-
ure S2E). 37% of the units responded only during the sucrose
delivery, 6% responded only during quinine delivery, and 7%
responded during both US deliveries (5.7% in a ‘‘same’’ quali-
tative way and 1.5% in qualitatively ‘‘opposite’’ ways; Figures
S2E and S2F). Overall, we found that more cells were inhibited
than excited by the US, irrespective of valence (34% ± 3%
excitatory compared to 66% ± 3% inhibitory responses;
Figure S2F).
BLA Projectors Send Collaterals to Multiple
Downstream Targets
Because previous studies suggest that a subset of BLA neurons
collateralize to multiple downstream targets (Shinonaga et al.,
1994), we estimated the extent of collateralization in each of
the BLA neural populations projecting to the NAc, CeA, and
vHPC by measuring fluorescence in multiple downstream struc-
tures of the BLA (Figures 3A and 3B) from animals expressing
ChR2-eYFP selectively in one projector population (BLA-NAc,
BLA-CeA, or BLA-vHPC). This approach allowed us to evaluate
the presence of neurites from each of these projection-target-
defined populations; however, the presence of fluorescent pro-
cesses may include fibers of passage and not faithfully represent
functional synaptic terminals.
We estimated the extent of collateralization based on mem-
brane fluorescence relative to a reference location, shown in
Figure 3B. Each of the three BLA projector populations sent
collaterals to multiple downstream targets (Figure 3C); however,
the fluorescence within the intended target structure always
surpassed that in the collateral regions we examined (Figure 3D).
In the images we collected, the average relative fluorescence
from BLA-NAc projector neurites outside the NAc was 33% ±
9%. The collateral fluorescence observed for BLA-vHPC
projectors was 24% ± 5% and only 17% ± 4% for BLA-CeA
projectors. We found that BLA-NAc projectors expressed neu-
rites extending across the NAc subregions, and outside the
NAc to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), CeA, and vHPC

 (Figures 3C–3D and S3). The relative fluorescence of BLA-NAc
projectors in the CeA was 57% of the fluorescence in NAc ven-
tro-lateral core, which could be partly due to axons of passage
that do not locally terminate or form functional synapses. The
BLA-vHPC projector population displayed more fluorescence
in the medial than in the lateral NAc shell (paired t test, t =
3.77, p < 0.05). However, there was no detectable difference in
the amount of membrane fluorescence of BLA-CeA projectors

Licking behavior during one recording session 
Figure 1. Experimental Design and Behavioral Training
(A) Anterograde AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP was injected in the BLA and retrograde CAV2-cre was injected in one of the following downstream targets: NAc,
CeA, or vHPC. A head bar was cemented to the skull to enable subsequent head-fixed training and recording.
(B) Schematic of conditioning and retrieval task. On days 1–2, an auditory cue (CS-S) was paired with a sucrose delivery and on days 3–6, a second auditory cue
(CS-Q) was paired with quinine deliveries. The number of quinine cues was gradually increased from 10% to 50% of total trials. On days 7–8, during the retrieval of
rewarding and aversive associations, an optrode was inserted into the BLA to record neural activity, and laser stimulation was used to photoidentify neurons
expressing ChR2.
(C) Time courses of a reward trial (left) and an aversive trial (right). The cues were played for 4 s and a 3 mL drop of solution (sucrose or quinine) was delivered
�500 ms after the onset of the cue. Anticipatory licking before the sucrose delivery indicates acquisition of the reward association and no licking indicates
expression of the aversive association.
(D) Licking behavior of a representative mouse in response to the CS-S (left raster) and the CS-Q (right raster) presentations during a recording session.
(E) Performance for the reward association (CS-S performance = sucrose trials with licks/number of sucrose trials) and for the aversive association (CS-Q
performance = quinine trials without licks/number of quinine trials) increased during learning of the task (left) and the latency of the first lick after the CS-S onset
decreased across training (right). The thinner lines represent the SEM, and the dashed line at 500 ms indicates the time of US delivery.
(F) Licking behavior during the recording sessions, averaged across all animals. Left panel represents the licking behavior and right panel represents the
probability of first lick in response to the cues. The shaded areas represent SEM.
(G) Representative image of a recording track in the BLA. The recording optrode was coated with red fluorescent microspheres before insertion into the brain (left

isolated from one recording site (average ± 99.7% confidence interval).
(B) Peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) of the firing rate of a single unit, to the onset of 30 sucrose-predicting cues (CS-S). For each unit, a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test determined whether the firing rate during the first 500 ms of the cue was significantly different from the 2 s baseline window (p < 0.01).
(C) 1,626 BLA units were recorded from 21 mice. 810 (50%) had a significantly different firing rates during the first 500 ms of the cue compared to the 2 s before the
cue (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.01). 28% responded selectively to the CS-S, 9% to the CS-Q, 13% responded to both cues in the same way, and less than
1% responded to both cues in an opposite way.
(D) Heat maps of the Z score of all recorded units in response to the CS-S (vertical teal line, left map) and in response to the CS-Q (vertical orange line, right map).
26% of the units showed a significant excitatory response to one and/or the other auditory cue (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.01). 14% of the units were
selectively excited by the CS-S and 4% by the CS-Q, while 7% were excited by both cues. 24% of the units showed a significant inhibitory response to one and/or
the other cue. 14% were selectively inhibited by the CS-S and 5% by the CS-Q, while 5% were inhibited by both cues. The black arrows indicate units responding
to both cues in an opposite manner (top arrow: excited by the CS-S and inhibited by the CS-Q [0.5%]; bottom arrow: inhibited by the CS-S and excited by the
CS-Q [0.2%]).
(E) Proportion of units responding to the rewarding cue only (CS-S selective), to the aversive cue only (CS-Q selective), or to both cues in the same way, with an

 between the medial and lateral NAc shell (paired t test, t = 0.67,
p = 0.27). Notably, among our samples, BLA-CeA projectors
scarcely expressed membrane fluorescence in the vHPC
(�1% relative eYFP fluorescence).
To quantify the extent of synaptic terminals from BLA-NAc
projectors in the CeA, we expressed synaptophysin fused to
the fluorescent protein mCherry (Calhoun et al., 1996; Oh
et al., 2014). In mice expressing mCherry in the synaptic termi-
nals and eYFP in the cell membranes of BLA-NAc projectors,
the relative mCherry fluorescence in the CeA was only 20% (Fig-
ures S3A and S3B), while the relative eYFP fluorescence was
57% (Figure 3D). This finding suggests that BLA-NAc projectors
collateralize to the CeA, albeit to a lesser extent than expected
by quantifying neurite fluorescence alone, which likely includes
fibers of passage.
ChR2-Expressing Neurons Have Shorter Photoresponse
Latencies Compared to Non-expressing Neighbors
The BLA is known to be an epileptogenic region (Ben-Ari et al.,
1980) and recurrent collaterals between pyramidal cells in the
BLA have been anatomically described (McDonald, 1984). To
unequivocally distinguish the BLA projection neurons express-
ing ChR2-eYFP (ChR2+) from the non-expressing neighbors
that receive excitatory inputs from projectors in vivo, we
empirically determined the photoresponse latencies ex vivo,
where visual and electrophysiological validation of opsin ex-
pression is possible (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4). We classified
neurons in three categories using whole-cell patch-clamp re-
cordings in the BLA (Figures 4B and 4C): (1) projectors
that exhibit a peak/steady-state current, characteristic of
ChR2-expressing neurons in response to a 1 s blue light
illumination (ChR2+, 21% of 91 cells), (2) ChR2-negative neigh-
bors receiving direct or indirect synaptic input from ChR2-
expressing projectors (responsive neighbors, 25%), and (3)
ChR2-negative neighbors that did not respond to illumination
(non-responsive neighbors, 54%). We then measured the
latencies of the light-evoked action potentials (APs) or excit-
atory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from the onset of a
5 ms light pulse to the peak of the response, in mice express-
ing ChR2 in BLA-NAc projectors (n = 40 cells), in BLA-CeA
projectors (n = 19 cells), or in BLA-vHPC projectors (n = 32
cells; Figure 4D). While all ChR2+ projectors fired after photo-
stimulation, only one of the responsive neighbors reached a
suprathreshold response, with a latency of 17.3 ms (BLA-
NAc neighbor; Figures 4E and 4F). Firing latencies ranged
from 2 to 8 ms for BLA-NAc projectors and were signifi-
cantly shorter than the light-evoked EPSP latencies of their
responsive neighbors (10–36 ms, Student’s t test, ***p <
0.01). BLA-CeA projectors expressing ChR2 responded faster
than their responsive neighbors (1–5 versus 12–18 ms, Stu-
dent’s t test, ***p < 0.01). Finally, the photoresponse latencies
of BLA-vHPC projectors ranged from 2 to 5 ms and were
shorter than the photoresponse latencies of their responsive
neighbors (11–24 ms, Student’s t test, ***p < 0.01; Figure 4F).
Based on these data, we defined the in vivo photoresponse
latency threshold as <9 ms for the NAc-projecting BLA neu-
rons, and <6 ms for both the BLA-CeA and BLA-vHPC
projectors.
BLA Projector Populations Differentially Respond to
Sucrose and Quinine Cues
In order to perform optogenetic-mediated ‘‘phototagging’’ to
identify BLA projectors in vivo, at the end of every recording
session, we provided different patterns of photostimulation to
compute the photoresponse latency and classify neurons as
ChR2-expressing projectors (Figure 5A; see Experimental Pro-
cedures). After applying the identification threshold defined
by our ex vivo recordings, we found a similar distribution of
latencies across the three projector populations (Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests, p > 0.05; Figure 5B). There were no detectable dif-
ferences in the distribution of firing rates between the BLA-NAc
and BLA-vHPC populations compared to the distribution in the
BLA (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p > 0.05), while BLA-CeA pro-
jectors have a different distribution of firing rates compared to all
BLA neurons (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.01; Figure 5C).
Finally, there were no detectable differences in the distribution
of the action potential duration (peak-trough) between each of
the three projector populations compared to the BLA distribution
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p > 0.05; Figure 5D). Altogether, 7%
of the units recorded met our criteria for photoidentification (Fig-
ure 5E; see Experimental Procedures). Compared to the entire
set of BLA neurons, in which 50% were cue-responsive, we
found that BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC projecting pop-
ulations contained 61%, 52%, and 69% cue-responsive units,
respectively (Figure 5F).
To visualize the response of each projector population to su-
crose and quinine cues without applying any predetermined cat-
egories, we computed the average Z score of all recorded BLA
neurons, BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC projectors (Fig-
ure 6A) in response to the sucrose cue (CS-S) and to the quinine
cue (CS-Q). We compared Z score distances between the CS-S
and CS-Q among the four populations (average within cell differ-
ences for BLA = 0.28, BLA-NAc = 0.63, BLA-CeA = �0.69, and
BLA-vHPC = 1.26; Figure 6B) and found that the response profile
of BLA-CeA projectors differed from each of the other three
groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001, BLA-CeA post hoc com-
parisons: to BLA-NAc ***p < 0.001, to BLA *p < 0.05, and to BLA-
vHPC **p < 0.01; Figure 6B).
To compare CS representation dynamics in BLA projector
populations, we projected the Z score time course of each
neuron from 500 ms before to 500 ms after cue-onset onto a
two-dimensional space using principal components analysis
(PCA; Figures 6C, 6D, and S6). The time period between 100
and 500 ms after the cue-onset contributed to the component
explaining the highest amount of variance in the dataset (PC1),
while the first 100 ms following cue-onset contributed the most
to the second principal component (PC2; Figure 6C). Interest-
ingly, PC1 separates responses to the sucrose and quinine
cues in all populations as illustrated by the separation of the
CS-S and CS-Q vectors along PC1 (Figures 6D, S6B, and
S6C). Additionally, PC2 separates the responses between the
projector populations, especially separating CeA projectors
from NAc and vHPC projectors (Figures 6D and S6C). Altogether,
the PCA of the Z score time course suggests that the late cue-
response (R100 ms) contains more information regarding the
valence of the cue, while the early cue-response (%100 ms) con-
tains more information regarding the projection target of the cell.

(B) Representative peak/steady-state current of a neuron expressing ChR2 (ChR2+, sky-blue trace) in response to a 1 s light pulse (sky-blue rectangle). In non-

(C) Proportion of all cells recorded ex vivo expressing ChR2-eYFP (ChR2+, 21%, sky-blue), responsive neighbors (25%, gray), and non-responsive neighbors
(54%, black). Numbers indicate the number of recorded neurons.
(D) Proportion of ChR2+ neurons, responsive neighbors, and non-responsive neighbors recorded in the BLA of mice expressing ChR2-eYFP in BLA-NAc (green),
BLA-CeA (red), or BLA-vHPC (dark blue) projectors.
(E) Representative traces of neural responses to a 5 ms light pulse of BLA projectors expressing ChR2-eYFP (green, red, or dark blue traces), in responsive

(F) Light-evoked peak response latency in BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC projectors expressing ChR2 and in non-expressing neighbors. Light-evoked
response latencies are significantly shorter in BLA-NAc (unpaired t test, t17 = 4.64, ***p < 0.001), BLA-CeA (unpaired t test, t10 = 10.64, ***p < 0.001), and BLA-
vHPC (unpaired t test, t9 = 5.62, ***p < 0.001) projectors compared to their non-expressing neighbors. The distribution of the latency in expressing and non-
expressing cells was used to define the latency threshold for in vivo photoidentification (9 ms for BLA-NAc projectors and 6 ms for BLA-CeA and BLA-vHPC
projectors).

 BLA Neurons Projecting to NAc and CeA Preferentially
Code for Opposite Valence
After classification of the units depending on their qualitative
response type, we found heterogeneity within each population
(Figures 7A and 7B). We categorized the functional responses
into six classes: selectively excited by the CS-S, selectively
excited by the CS-Q, excited by both cues, selectively inhibited
by the CS-S, selectively inhibited by the CS-Q, or inhibited by
both cues (Figures 7C and 7D). Examination of the population
profiles of specific projector responses reveals noteworthy ab-
sences: for example, zero BLA-NAc neurons were excited by
the CS-Q and zero BLA-CeA neurons were inhibited by the
CS-Q (Figure 7C).
When comparing the proportions of neurons excited or in-
hibited by one cue (Figure 7D), we found a larger proportion of
BLA-NAc projectors excited by the CS-S (10/13 units; 77%),
compared to the entire BLA neural population (228/448 units,
51% in the BLA, binomial distribution, +p < 0.1; Figure 7D). We
also found that all BLA-CeA projectors responding only to the
quinine cue showed an excitatory response (5/5 units; 100%),

Figure 5. Neural Response of BLA Projection Neurons to Cues Predicting Sucrose or Quinine
(A) Photoresponse latencies in vivo were calculated by measuring the time from stimulation onset to the first bin in which firing rate increased at least 4 SDs above
baseline.
(B) No differences were detected in photoresponse latency distributions among BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC projectors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests,
p > 0.05).
(C) The distribution of firing rates in BLA-NAc and BLA-vHPC projectors was not different from the BLA distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p > 0.05), while
the firing rate distribution in BLA-CeA projectors was different from the BLA distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p < 0.01).
(D) Scatterplot depicting the action potential (AP) duration (peak-trough) as a function of the firing rate of all the recorded units (gray) and in the three photo-

 compared to 71/145 units (49%) of the BLA units (binomial distri-
bution, *p < 0.05). We also observed that all recorded BLA-NAc
projectors that responded only to the quinine cue showed inhib-
itory responses (2/2 units, 100%; Figures 7C and 7D). Regarding
responses to the unconditioned stimuli (Figures S5 and S7), we
did not detect differences in the proportion of excitatory and
inhibitory responses to the sucrose and quinine deliveries (bino-
mial distribution, p > 0.05).
Finally, we compared the response profiles to the conditioned
stimuli in the BLA neural population as a whole and in the three
projection-target-defined BLA populations using different classi-
fication criteria for the representation of valence previously
described in the literature (Figure 7E; for review see Namburi
et al., 2015a).
Using a simple classification emphasizing cue selectivity
(termed ‘‘valence selectivity’’ in Namburi et al., 2015a), we can
categorize neurons based upon their selectivity to the sucrose
predictive (CS-S) or quinine predictive (CS-Q) cue, regardless
of the response direction (excitation or inhibition). Among all re-
corded BLA neurons that responded selectively to one cue, we
found �3-fold more neurons selective to the CS-S (448/593,
76%; Figure 7E, left) than units selective to the CS-Q. We did
not detect differences in the proportion of units selectively re-
sponding to the CS-S in the three projector populations
compared to the whole BLA population (13/15, 87% in BLA-
NAc; 8/13, 62% in BLA-CeA; 13/21, 62% in BLA-vHPC, binomial
tests, p > 0.05; Figure 7E).
Another classification, the ‘‘valence index,’’ defines the propor-
tion of cells encoding valence as those with distinct responses to
the CS-S and CS-Q (i.e., combining units responding selectively
to one of the cues with units showing opposite responses to both
cues) relative to all CS-responsive cells (Figure 7E, middle). By
using this classification, we found that within the BLA task-
responsive units we sampled, the majority encode valence during
the retrieval of the positive and negative associations (605/810,
75%). This proportion was not detectably different in the three
projector populations compared to the BLA population (15/23,
65% in BLA-NAc; 13/17, 76% in BLA-CeA; 21/27, 78% in BLA-
vHPC, binomial tests, p > 0.05; Figure 7E).
Within the context of BLA projector populations, we utilize a
third classification, the ‘‘valence bias,’’ which defines the propor-
tion of a population encoding positive or negative valence among
all the cells encoding valence (Figure 7E, right). Using this metric,
positive valence is encoded at a population level by neurons that
increase their firing upon presentation of the reward-predicting
cue (CS-S), that decrease their firing in response to a cue predict-
ing an aversive outcome (CS-Q), or exhibit both of these opposing
responses. Contrastingly, negative valence is encoded at the
population level by cells inhibited by reward-predicting cues

Figure 6. Category-Independent Coding Properties of BLA Popula-
tions
We first analyzed responses within each population independent of qualitative
classifications.
(A) Z score time courses averaged across all BLA units (black), all BLA-NAc
projectors (green), all BLA-CeA projectors (red), or all BLA-vHPC projectors
(blue), in response to the CS-S (top) and in response to the CS-Q (bottom).
Shaded areas represent the SEM. The gray shaded box depicts the interval
from CS onset to US onset.
(B) Difference between CS-S and CS-Q Z scores, averaged from the onset of
the CS to the US delivery, for each BLA units (black bar) and for neurons of the
three projector populations (green, red, and blue bars). Positive values indicate
greater magnitude responsiveness to the CS-S, while negative values indicate
greater magnitude responsiveness to the CS-Q. BLA-CeA projectors respond
more to the CS-Q than the CS-S compared to all other populations (Kruskal-
Wallis test p < 0.01, BLA-CeA post hoc comparisons: to BLA-NAc ***p < 0.001,
to BLA *p < 0.05, and to BLA-vHPC **p < 0.01). Error bars represent SEM.
(C) The Z score time course of each neuron from �500 ms to 500 ms relative to
cue-onset was projected onto two dimensions using principal component
analysis (PCA). In order to visualize the time periods that contribute most
significantly to the principal components depicted in (D), we plotted the
contribution of each 50 ms time bin to principal component 1 (PC1) and
principal component 2 (PC2). Bins prior to the cue onset did not contribute to
either principal component, whereas the first time bins after CS onset
contribute most strongly to PC2 and subsequent bins contribute to PC1.
(D) Neural responses to the sucrose predictive cue (CS-S) and quinine
predictive cue (CS-Q) in all BLA units, BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC
projector populations, visualized along PC1 and PC2. Neural dynamics in
principal component (PC) space across all neurons in each population were
averaged for each cue to obtain the position of the vectors.

 and/or excited by cues predicting aversive outcomes. Using this
operationaldefinitioninourdataset, we found that 51%of valence
encoding BLA neurons code for positive valence (310/605 cells),
whereas 49% code for negative valence (295/605 cells). Within
the BLA projector populations, we found a significantly larger pro-
portion of BLA-NAc projectors encoding positive valence (12/15
cells, 80%) compared to the whole BLA (binomial test *p < 0.05;
Figure 7E). Within our sample, fewer BLA-CeA projectors en-
coded positive valence (4/13 cells, 31%) and instead tended to
preferentially encode negative valence (9/13 cells, 69%). In
contrast, positive and negative valence encoding neurons were
evenly represented among valence-responsive BLA-vHPC neu-
rons (9/21 cells, 43% encoding positive valence; Figure 7E).
Altogether, quantitative analysis of the neural response of BLA
populations (all BLA, BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC) and
analysis of the proportion of units responding with excitation and
inhibition to the cues of positive and negative valence both show
that BLA-NAc and BLA-CeA populations have divergent profiles
in response to cues predicting rewarding and aversive outcomes.

Figure 7. Distinct Roles in Coding Positive
and Negative Valence Defined by Projection
Target
For these analyses, we grouped neurons based
upon their qualitative response to the CS-S and
CS-Q.
(A) PSTHs of the firing rates (FR) of three
units photoidentified as BLA-NAc projectors,
one showing an excitatory response to the
cue
associated
with
sucrose
(CS-S,
top),
one showing an inhibitory response to the cue
associated with quinine (CS-Q, middle), and one
showing an inhibitory response to both cues (B,
bottom).
(B) Perievent raster histograms of the firing rates of
three units photoidentified as BLA-CeA pro-
jectors, one inhibited by the cue associated with
sucrose (CS-S, top), one excited by the cue
associated with quinine (CS-Q, middle), and one
excited by both cues (B, bottom).
(C) Distribution of units excited (left, filled bars) or
inhibited (right, open bars) by the CS-S [S], by
the CS-Q [Q], or by both cues in the same way
[B], in all the BLA units (black), in the BLA-NAc
photoidentified units (green), in the BLA-CeA
photoidentified units (red) and in BLA-vHPC pho-
toidentified units (blue).
(D) Proportion of units excited and inhibited by
the sucrose cue (S) or the quinine cue (Q), in the
four neural populations. A larger proportion of
BLA-NAc neurons (77%) showed phasic excita-
tions to the CS-S than in the nonspecific BLA
neural population as a whole (51%; binomial
distribution, +p = 0.093). A larger proportion of
BLA-CeA neurons (100%) showed phasic exci-
tation to the CS-Q than in the nonspecific BLA
neural population (49%; binomial distribution,
*p < 0.05).
(E) Valence definitions applied to all BLA units and
the three projector populations. Cue selectivity:
proportion of cue responsive cells responding
exclusively to the sucrose cue (filled bars) or to the
quinine cues (open bars). Valence index: propor-
tion of task-responsive cells encoding valence
(including those responsive to only one cue, or
responding oppositely to both cues; closed bars)
compared to those responding in the same way to
both cues. Valence bias: relative proportion of
neurons responding to positive valence (filled bars) and negative valence (open bars). The BLA-NAc projector population has a greater proportion of cells
encoding positive valence than the nonspecific BLA population based upon this valence bias metric (binomial distribution, *p < 0.05).

 the retrieval of rewarding and aversive Pavlovian associations.
Within this behavioral task, two cues of the same sensory
modality (tones) were predictive of either a positive or negative
outcome, themselves of matched modality (the tastants, sucrose
or quinine). In so doing, we observed heterogeneous responses
to the conditioned stimuli within BLA projector populations, yet
provided evidence that information regarding the sucrose and
quinine predictive cues is differentially routed to divergent cir-
cuits (Figures 6 and 7).
BLA Neurons Respond to Cues Associated with Positive
and Negative Valence
Our results are consistent with previous studies reporting that
intermingled neurons in the BLA respond to the valence of
learned cues in rats (Shabel and Janak, 2009) and monkeys (Fus-
ter and Uyeda, 1971; Paton et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2013b). The
proportion of cue-responsive BLA units that we identify in mice is
similar to that recorded by Fuster and Uyeda in monkeys (53%,
while we found 50%). Moreover, the proportions of units differ-
entially modulated by cues predicting positive or negative out-
comes (responding to the CS-S only, to the CS-Q only, or to
both cues in an opposite manner) are also strikingly consistent
between mice and monkeys in these two studies (37% in
both). Fuster and Uyeda also identified a similar proportion of
units responding to both cues in the same qualitative way
(excited by both cues or inhibited by both cues; 16%, while we
found 13%). These marked similarities suggest that the coding
properties of BLA neurons are preserved across mammalian
phylogeny.
The critical novel finding that we present is that projection-
target-defined populations of BLA neurons play distinct roles in
valence retrieval in vivo. These distinctions are not exclusively
based upon opposing excitatory responses, but also involve
inhibitory responses. When all BLA neurons are considered
together, approximately half of the cells responding selectively
to the CS-S, selectively to the CS-Q, or similarly to both cues
displayed inhibitory responses (Figure 2D). As most of the BLA
neurons displayed low but stable firing rates (Figure 5D), this
suggests that inhibition of an ensemble of cells during a specific
cue may carry valence information through a decrease in synap-
tic activation of the downstream target(s) of these cells.
Design Advantages
Here, we introduce important advances for photostimulation-as-
sisted identification of neural populations within a recurrent
excitatory network. Recently, the in vivo activity of projection-
target-defined cells has been examined by expressing ChR2
in neurons of interest and using light-evoked firing as an instru-
ment to identify these neurons in intact animals (Ciocchi et al.,
2015; Jennings et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013a). However, two
confounds could undermine the stringent identification of
projection-target-defined neurons using these methods. First,
lateral synaptic contacts between glutamatergic neurons may
result in the inclusion of non-projectors in the photoidentified
group. To avoid the inappropriate inclusion of indirectly excited,
non-expressing neighboring cells, we have refined this method
by establishing projection-specific cutoffs for photostimulation-
evoked action potential latency based upon direct ex vivo obser-
vations. The second confound arises from ‘‘antidromic’’ photo-
tagging approaches that can inaccurately identify neurons via
antidromic activation of fibers of passage. Here, we circumvent
this confound using a dual-virus recombination strategy, which
requires co-infection at terminal and somatic sites in order for
ChR2 expression to occur. Using this approach, we eliminate
the need for antidromic stimulation and collision tests and can
photoidentify cells at the level of the soma.
We have also taken strides to facilitate the interpretation of our
neural data as they relate to valence encoding. Previous studies
examining valence processing in the BLA have used different
sensory modalities for the conditioned stimuli paired with
rewarding and aversive outcomes (Shabel and Janak, 2009),
as well as for the outcomes themselves. For instance, palatable
foods or liquids are often presented as rewarding unconditioned
stimuli, whereas electric shocks or air puffs are used as aversive
unconditioned stimuli (Cohen et al., 2012; Fuster and Uyeda,
1971; Paton et al., 2006; Shabel and Janak, 2009). These dis-
crepancies in stimulus modality require sensory processing
along distinct streams, which may result in the recruitment of
distinct subpopulations of BLA neurons independent of valence
processing. To reduce this potential confound, we matched the
modality of the rewarding and aversive unconditioned stimuli
(gustatory) and conditioned stimuli (auditory).
To further reduce variability in the detection of sensory signals
during the behavioral task, we head restrained mice. In a head-
fixed configuration, the mice receive auditory conditioned stimuli
at a consistent intensity throughout all trials. Further, acute re-
cordings in head-fixed mice allow for multiple recording tracks
within each animal, increasing the yield of recorded units and
photoidentified cells compared to previous studies.
‘‘Both’’ Cells and Collaterals: Hypotheses
We found evidence of collateralization to multiple downstream
targets among BLA projector populations. We hypothesize that
certain cells collateralize within these distributed circuits to
enhance overall arousal through increased excitability of post-
synaptic cells in the entire valence system. Congruent with this
idea, a recent study identified a population of dorsal hippocam-
pal neurons sending collaterals to the NAc, the BLA, and the
mPFC, which was activated across behavioral conditions of
different valence (Ciocchi et al., 2015). We speculate that BLA
neurons targeting multiple downstream structures respond simi-
larly to positive and negative valence in order to increase overall
arousal in response to salient conditioned stimuli.
An alternative possibility is that certain valence encoding neu-
rons in the BLA project to multiple downstream targets in order to
promote behavioral flexibility. Within natural environments,
valence exists on a continuum wherein sensory cues predict
rewards and dangers of various magnitude, and these pairings
are often subject to change. In order to survive, an animal
must shift behavioral strategies when environmental contin-
gencies change. Individual BLA neurons that innervate multiple
projection targets have the ability to send information both to
canonical fear and reward pathways. These cells may track
changing environmental contingencies via selective strength-
ening of inputs to one target over the other(s), potentially
through the formation of increased synaptic contacts, through

 compartment-specific changes in release probability following
axo-axonal excitation, or through downstream local inhibition.
Valence: Operational Definitions
If we consider all cells in a population, and define valence coding
within that population to be its net responsivity to either a
rewarding or an aversive cue, our results indicate that all the as-
sayed BLA populations increase activity in response to positive
and negative valence (Figure 6A). However, if we further calcu-
late the difference between the responses induced by the su-
crose cue and by the quinine cue (Figure 6B), we find that cells
in the entire BLA population, the BLA-NAc projector population,
and the BLA-vHPC population tend to be more excited/less in-
hibited by the sucrose cue compared to the quinine cue,
whereas the cells in the BLA-CeA projector population were
overall more excited/less inhibited by the quinine cue compared
to the sucrose cue. These results suggest that the BLA-NAc pro-
jector population is sending a stronger excitatory drive to the
NAc in response to reward predictive cues than to aversion pre-
dictive cues and that, conversely, the BLA-CeA projector popu-
lation is sending a stronger excitatory drive to the CeA during
retrieval of an aversive association.
Within the recorded BLA populations, we found that cells
responding exclusively to the reward predictive cue were over-
represented among cue-selective neurons (Figure 7E). As the
mice did not consume the quinine during most trials, the bias
in cue selectivity may represent the relative magnitude of
valence predicted by the two cues (sucrose consumption versus
quinine smell). Alternatively, the bias toward neurons responding
to the reward predictive cue could reflect a larger computational
load required to take action (go) compared to that required to
suppress action (no go).
To further decode the nature of valence processing during the
retrieval of associative memories, we classified BLA neural re-
sponses to the sucrose predictive cue and the quinine predictive
cue based upon their directionality. The valence index quantifies
the proportion of a task-responsive population that encodes
valence. Within this classification, neurons that respond similarly
to both cues are not considered to be valence encoding, as
these neurons might encode the salience of the cues or general
arousal. Using this definition, among the task-responsive cells,
we found that 75% of BLA neurons encoded valence, and this
proportion was similar regardless of their projection target.
Among the valence encoding BLA neurons identified using the
valence index, we examined the relative proportion of cells en-
coding positive or negative valence using the valence bias metric
(Figure 7E). Despite the limitation that the downstream cell type
contacted by BLA projectors is unknown, we found that a larger
proportion of BLA-NAc projectors encode positive valence
compared to the entire BLA, whereas the BLA-CeA projectors
tend to preferentially encode negative valence. By contrast,
and to our surprise, positive and negative valence encoding
neurons were equally represented among valence-responsive
BLA-vHPC neurons. Given that activation of this projection is
anxiogenic (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013), we hypothesized that BLA
neurons projecting to the vHPC would code for negative valence
during retrieval. Our contrasting findings raise the possibility that
innate and learned emotional valence could be processed by
distinct circuitry emerging from the BLA. For this reason, we
examined neural responses to the unconditioned stimuli.
Innate versus Learned Valence: Responses to the US
While thevalue of thepredictive cues mustbe learned acrossmul-
tipleconditioning sessions,thevalenceofsucroseandquinineare
innate and do not require training. Analyzing responses of BLA
neurons to these stimuli presents two limitations, however. First,
the US is delivered during the CS, and second, the rewarding
US (sucrose) is consumed by the animal, whereas the aversive
US (quinine) can be smelled but is not consumed after the mice
acquired the association (Figure 1D; Movie S1). The majority of
the BLA neurons selectively responding to the sucrose or quinine
delivery changed their firing upon the sucrose delivery (595/698,
85%, Figures S2E and 7E). This disparity may be because the
sucrose is actively consumed, whereas the quinine is avoided.
Among the US-valence-responsive BLA neurons we re-
corded, the majority encode innate negative valence (518/723,
58%), while 305/723 (42%) encoded innate positive valence (Fig-
ure S7D). Compared to our findings regarding responses to
conditioned stimuli, in which 49% of valence-encoding BLA neu-
rons encoded negative valence, these results suggest that a
greater proportion of BLA neurons encoded innate negative
valence than learned negative valence. This encoding of the
innate valence of the US by BLA neurons may promote the attri-
bution of valence to the CS during learning (Gore et al., 2015).
If we categorize the units depending on their response type to
the US and calculate the US-valence bias (Figure S7D), we find
that the NAc projector population preferentially encodes innate
positive valence (11/18, 61%), and that CeA projectors we re-
corded preferentially encode innate negative valence (12/17,
71%). If we assume that most of the BLA-CeA projectors that
we recorded in this study are projecting to the viral injection
site in the CeM, and consider anxiety-related behaviors as a
state of innate negative valence, our results are consistent with
previous findings showing that activation of the BLA-CeA projec-
tion is anxiolytic, via disynaptic inhibition of the CeM through
feedforward recruitment of the CeL by the BLA (Tye et al., 2011).
Surprisingly, we found that the vHPC projectors did not prefer-
entially encode innate negative valence (9/19, 47%), despite our
previous finding that activation of the BLA-vHPC is anxiogenic
(Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013). This discrep-
ancy may result from recruitment of different BLA-vHPC projec-
tors for the initiation of anxiety-like behaviors and the processing
of discrete sensory stimuli.
Looking Forward
The heterogeneity of response types within different populations
suggests that combinatorial activity within the BLA in response
to a conditioned cue ultimately recruits the motor output that trig-
gers the appropriate behavior. Despite this heterogeneity, our re-
sults suggest that BLA-NAc projectors preferentially encode
positive valence, when valence is defined (1) as the differential
response of the entire population to rewarding versus aversive
cues (Figures 6A and 6B), (2) as excitation/inhibition balance of
cue selective cells (Figure 7D), or (3) as a valence bias (Figure 7E).
Conversely, we found that BLA-CeA projectors preferentially
encode negative valence when valence is defined using any of
Neuron 90, 348–361, April 20, 2016

 these three definitions. However, other BLA outputs including
projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the prefron-
tal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex
represent promising avenues for future study of valence pro-
cessing in anatomically defined BLA populations. The results
that we present here detail functional differences in valence en-
coding based upon anatomically defined circuits and offer
insight toward mechanisms by which emotional and motivational
information may be routed through the brain.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Stereotaxic Surgery and Viral Vectors
All procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines from the NIH
and with approval of the MIT committee on animal care (CAC). Adult wild-type
male C57BL/6J mice were used. We injected an anterograde adeno-associ-
ated viral vector (AAV5), carrying ChR2 fused to eYFP in a cre-recombinase-
dependent double-inverted open reading frame (DIO) construct, under the
control of the pan-neuronal promotor EF1a (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP) in
the BLA to transduce local cell bodies, and injected a retrogradely traveling
canine adenovirus of type 2 carrying cre-recombinase (CAV2-cre), into the
downstream target of interest (NAc, CeA, or vHPC).
Behavioral Conditioning
�3 months after surgery, mice were food restricted and head fixed daily over
6 days to learn to associate two auditory cues with two gustatory outcomes of
positive and negative valence. During the first days, the mice learned to asso-
ciate one conditioned stimulus (CS-S) with a delivery of sucrose before we
introduced a second conditioned stimulus (CS-Q) associated with a delivery
of an aversive solution (quinine). When the mice showed anticipatory licking
in response to the CS-S and reached a performance criterion of 70% success-
ful trials for sucrose (lick) and for quinine (no lick), we performed acute record-
ings in the BLA over 2 consecutive days in 21 animals (Figures 1 and S1).
In Vivo Electrophysiology
Once the mice recovered from surgery, they were head fixed and a silicon op-
trode coated with red fluorescent microspheres was lowered into the BLA. The
optrode was then lowered at �1 mm/s until we observed a neural response to
473 laser stimulation. We then started a recording session presenting �30 su-
crose and �30 quinine interleaved trials. Following completion of the task, a
phototagging session, during which pseudorandomly dispersed stimulations
of 1 s constant light, 10 s of 1 Hz (10 ms pulses), 2 s of 10 Hz (5 ms pulses),
and 100 ms of 100 Hz (5 ms pulses) were delivered, with at least five iterations
each.
Ex Vivo Electrophysiology
Coronal sections of 300 mm containing the BLA were collected from animals
that had the same viral surgery as the animals used for in vivo recordings.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were taken from visually identified fluores-
cent projectors and neighboring non-expressing cells. BLA cells expressing
ChR2 were activated using a 470 nm LED. Response latencies of action poten-
tials (APs) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were measured for
20 pulses of 5 ms delivered at 10 Hz and averaged for each neuron (Figure S4).
Confocal Microscopy
Mice included in this study were trained, recorded, and perfused before the
brain was extracted for histological verification of the viral injections and the
recording location. Brains were fixed, frozen, and sliced in 50 mm coronal sec-
tions. Sections were then incubated with a DNA-specific fluorescent probe,
slide mounted, and imaged using an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser-scanning
microscope.
Statistical Analysis
Changes in neural firing rate in response to the CS and US were tested using a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing an experimental window of 500 ms to a
baseline window of 2 s (Figures 2B and S2C; Table S1). Significance threshold
was placed at p < 0.01 to classify a neuron as responding to the event. We
used the same signed-rank test for light responses (100 ms baseline window
and experimental window of 9 ms for BLA-NAc projectors and 6 ms for
BLA-CeA and BLA-vHPC projectors), in addition to a threshold on the light-
evoked response magnitude (average Z score > 0.5). Paired statistical com-
parisons were made with a two-tailed paired Student’s t test. Comparison of
distributions was performed using a two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Comparisons of Z score differences were realized with a non-parametric Krus-
kal-Wallis test. Comparisons of proportion of excitation and inhibition within
populations were made using binomial distribution tests. Threshold for signif-
icance was placed at +p < 0.1, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001). All data
are shown as mean ± SEM.
