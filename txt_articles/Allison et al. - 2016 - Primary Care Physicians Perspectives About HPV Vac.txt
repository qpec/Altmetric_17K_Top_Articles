abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Because physicians’
 practices could be modified to reduce 
missed opportunities for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, our goal was to: (1) 
describe self-reported practices regarding recommending the HPV vaccine; (2) estimate 
the frequency of parental deferral of HPV vaccination; and (3)identify characteristics 
associated with not discussing it.
METHODS: A national survey among pediatricians and family physicians (FP) was conducted 
between October 2013 and January 2014. Using multivariable analysis, characteristics 
associated with not discussing HPV vaccination were examined.
RESULTS: Response rates were 82% for pediatricians (364 of 442) and 56% for FP (218 of 
387). For 11-12 year-old girls, 60% of pediatricians and 59% of FP strongly recommend HPV 
vaccine; for boys,52% and 41% ostrongly recommen. More than one-half reported ≥25% 
of parents deferred HPV vaccination. At the 11-12 year well visit, 84% of pediatricians and 
75% of FP frequently/always discuss HPV vaccination. Compared with physicians who 
frequently/always discuss , those who occasionally/rarely discuss(18%) were more likely to 
be FP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–3.5), be male (aOR: 
1.8 [95% CI: 1.1–3.1]), disagree that parents will accept HPV vaccine if discussed with other 
vaccines (aOR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.3–4.2]), report that 25% to 49% (aOR: 2.8 [95% CI: 1.1–6.8]) 
or ≥50% (aOR: 7.8 [95% CI: 3.4–17.6]) of parents defer, and express concern about waning 
immunity (aOR: 3.4 [95% CI: 1.8–6.4]).
CONCLUSIONS: Addressing physicians’
 perceptions about parental acceptance of HPV vaccine, 
the possible advantages of discussing HPV vaccination with other recommended vaccines, 
and concerns about waning immunity could lead to increased vaccination rates.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: TheHPV vaccine 
could prevent thousands of cancers in the United 
States each year; however, HPV vaccine coverage is 
lower than for other adolescent vaccines and lower 
for boys. HPV vaccination is recommended for all 11- to 
12-year-olds, but missed opportunities are common.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Eighteen percent of 
physicians are not discussing the HPV vaccine at the 
11- to 12-year-old well-child visit, likely contributing 
to missed opportunities. Physicians’ likelihood 
of initiating a conversation is diminished by an 
expectation that parents are likely to defer the 
vaccine.

ALLISON et al 
Almost 1 in 4 people in the United 
States is infected with at least 1 
strain of human papillomavirus 
(HPV), and ∼27 000 cancers are 
likely caused by HPV each year.1,2 
Among these HPV-attributable 
cancers, 17 600 cases were diagnosed 
in women, with >10 000 of these 
cancers occurring in the cervix; 9300 
cases were diagnosed in men, with 
>7000 occurring in the oropharynx.1 
Although cervical cancers are 
more common, the incidence of 
oropharyngeal cancers is increasing, 
and these cancers are 4 times more 
common in men than in women.1,3,4 
HPV infection also causes the 
majority of vulvar, vaginal, and anal 
cancers among women, and penile 
and anal cancers among men.1,5
The Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices 
recommended the HPV vaccine for 
routine use in girls in 2006 and 
for boys in 2011.6 The committee 
recommended the vaccine for 11- 
to 12-year-olds because it is most 
effective if given before initiation of 
sexual activity and exposure to HPV 
and because 2 additional vaccines, 
the quadrivalent meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine and the tetanus, 
diphtheria, and acellular pertussis 
vaccine, are also recommended at 
this age. HPV vaccine coverage has 
remained lower than coverage for 
the other recommended adolescent 
vaccines.7 National data suggest 
that 60% of 13- to 17-year-old girls 
have received at least 1 dose of HPV 
vaccine, and 40% have received 
all 3 doses. Boys have lower HPV 
vaccination rates than girls, with 
42% coverage for 1 dose and 22% 
coverage for all 3 doses among 13- to 
17-year-olds.
Missed opportunities for HPV 
vaccination at 11 to 12 years of 
age are common.8 Several factors, 
including financial issues, patient 
and parent refusal or deferral, and 
health care providers’
 practices, 
likely contribute to these missed 
opportunities.9 Because physicians’
 
practices could be modified to reduce 
missed opportunities and increase 
HPV vaccine coverage, the goal of 
the present study was to understand 
physicians’
 current perspectives and 
practices related to HPV vaccination 
for girls and boys. Using a national 
sample of pediatricians and family 
physicians (FP), our objectives 
were to: (1) describe physicians’
 
self-reported practices regarding 
recommending and administering 
the HPV vaccine; (2) estimate how 
frequently physicians report parental 
deferral of HPV vaccination for their 
children in different age groups; 
and (3) estimate how frequently 
physicians discuss the HPV vaccine 
and identify physician and practice 
characteristics associated with not 
discussing the HPV vaccine at the 11- 
to 12-year-old well-child visit.
METHODS
Study Setting
The Vaccine Policy Collaborative 
Initiative, a program designed 
collaboratively with the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
to assess primary care physicians’
 
attitudes regarding vaccine-related 
issues, administered a survey to a 
national network of pediatricians 
and FP. The human subjects review 
board at the University of Colorado 
Anschutz Medical Campus approved 
the study as exempt research.
Population
The survey was conducted among 
networks of physicians previously 
recruited from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and 
the American Academy of Family 
Physicians (AAFP) to respond to 
several surveys annually.10 After 
obtaining twice the number of 
recruits needed for each network, 
a quota strategy was applied to 
assure the representativeness of the 
samples.10,11 In a previous evaluation, 
demographic characteristics, practice 
attributes, and reported attitudes 
about vaccination issues were shown 
to be generally similar between 
network physicians and physicians 
of the same specialties randomly 
sampled from the American Medical 
Association master physician 
listing.10
Survey Design
The survey instrument was 
developed in collaboration with 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. It included 21 questions, 
most with multiple parts, about 
characteristics of physicians and 
practices; physicians’
 practices 
related to administration of, 
recommendation for, and discussion 
of the HPV vaccine; reasons for 
deferring discussion of the HPV 
vaccine; physicians’
 knowledge and 
attitudes about HPV infection and 
the HPV vaccine; and physicians’
 
estimates of how often parents had 
deferred the HPV vaccine when it 
had been offered to their child. The 
survey also included questions about 
discussion of sexual health issues and 
barriers to vaccine administration, 
but these questions were not 
included in the present analysis. The 
survey was pretested in an advisory 
panel of 8 pediatricians and 5 FP 
from across the country and was 
pilot-tested among 81 pediatricians 
and 19 FP.
Physicians’
 self-reported practices 
and attitudes about the HPV vaccine 
and HPV infection were measured 
by using 4-point Likert scales. 
Physicians’
 knowledge about the HPV 
vaccine and HPV-related diseases 
were measured by using statements 
to which respondents answered 
“agree,” “disagree,” or “don’
t know/
not sure.” Finally, physicians’
 
experience with deferral of the HPV 
vaccine was measured by asking 
them to estimate the proportion of 
parents who had deferred in the 
following categories: <1%, 1% to 
9%, 10% to 24%, 25% to 49%, and 
≥50%.

Survey Administration
The survey was administered 
between October 2013 and January 
2014 by using an Internet version 
or regular mail based on physicians’
 
preferences. The Internet survey 
was administered with a Web-
based program (Vovici Corporation, 
Dulles, Virginia). The Internet group 
received an initial e-mail with a link 
to the survey and up to 8 e-mail 
reminders to complete the survey; 
the mail group received an initial 
mailing and up to 2 additional mailed 
surveys at 2-week intervals. The 
Internet nonresponders also received 
up to 2 paper surveys by mail. The 
physicians received no financial 
incentives for their participation.
Analytic Methods
Internet and mail surveys were 
pooled for all analyses because 
provider attitudes have been found 
to be comparable when obtained by 
using either method.12 We compared 
pediatricians and FP responses 
by using χ2 tests for questions 
with dichotomous responses and 
Mantel-Haenszel tests for questions 
with Likert scale responses. When 
responses of the pediatricians 
and FP were similar, they were 
combined for subsequent analyses. 
The Cochran-Armitage test for trend 
was used to compare the strength of 
recommendation for HPV vaccination 
across different age groups, and 
McNemar’
s test was used to compare 
the strength of recommendation 
between boys and girls in each age 
group.
A bivariate analysis was also 
conducted to compare the practice 
characteristics of physicians who 
reported experiencing more parental 
deferral (≥25%) versus physicians 
who reported less parental deferral 
(<25%) at the 11- to 12-year-old 
visit. Because physicians’
 reported 
estimates of parental deferral 
were not significantly different 
between 11-to 12-year-old boys 
and girls overall, 1 deferral variable 
was created for each physician by 
choosing the higher estimate of 
deferral if an individual physician’
s 
response differed for boys and girls.
We compared physicians who 
reported that they rarely/never 
or occasionally discussed the HPV 
vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old 
well-child visit with physicians who 
reported that they frequently or 
almost always/always discussed HPV 
vaccination at this age. Physicians 
who indicated that they rarely see 
11- to 12-year-old girls or boys 
were excluded. Predictor variables 
were chosen based on existing 
literature and our hypothesis that 
physicians who had experienced 
more parental deferral at the 11- 
to 12-year-old visit would be less 
likely to discuss HPV vaccination at 
this visit. We compared physician 
and practice characteristics, belief 
that it is necessary to discuss sexual 
health issues when discussing the 
HPV vaccine, belief that parents 
are more likely to accept the HPV 
vaccine if discussed in the context 
of other vaccines given at the 11- to 
12-year-old visit, knowledge that the 
antibody response to the HPV vaccine 
is stronger in younger adolescents 
compared with adults, concern about 
waning immunity, and estimates 
of the proportion of parents who 
had deferred the HPV vaccine for 
the discussion outcome; Wilcoxon 
tests and χ2 tests were used, as 
appropriate. Predictor variables 
with a P value ≤.25 were included in 
a multivariable logistic regression 
model. Variables were retained in the 
final model for P < .05.
Finally, we conducted multivariable 
analyses comparing physicians 
who reported that they strongly 
recommend the HPV vaccine for 
11- to 12-year-olds versus those 
who do not, with separate analyses 
for girls and boys. We used the same 
predictor variables and methods as 
described earlier for the analysis of 
discussion of HPV vaccine at the 11- 
to 12-year-old visit.
RESULTS
Response Rates and Respondent 
Characteristics
The survey response rate was 70% 
overall (582 of 829), with 82% 
of pediatricians (364 of 442) and 
56% of FP (218 of 387) responding. 
Pediatrician responders did not 
differ from nonresponders in terms 
of gender, age, practice type, urban 
versus rural location, or region 
of the country. Compared with 
nonresponders, FP responders were 
more likely to be female and less 
likely to practice in the southern 
United States (Table 1).
Physicians’ Current Practices
Ninety-nine percent of pediatricians 
and 87% of FP administer the 
HPV vaccine to 11- to 18-year-old 
girls in their practices, whereas 
98% of pediatricians and 81% 
of FP administer the vaccine to 
boys. Physicians were more likely 
to strongly recommend the HPV 
vaccine for older age groups (Mantel-
Haenszel χ2 tests, P < .0001 for girls 
and boys), and in every age group, 
physicians were more likely to 
strongly recommend the vaccine for 
girls than for boys (McNemar’
s test, 
P < .0001 for each age group) (Table 
2). Pediatricians were more likely to 
strongly recommend the HPV vaccine 
than FP except for 11- to 12-year-old 
girls (P ≤.0001).
Physicians’ Report of Parental 
Deferral of HPV Vaccination
More than one-half of physicians 
reported that when they offered 
the HPV vaccine, ≥25% of parents 
deferred vaccination for their 11- 
to 12-year-old children (Fig 1). 
Physicians reported that parental 
deferral of the HPV vaccine was more 
common for 11- to 12-year-olds than 
for 13- to 15-year-olds (P < .0001 for 
both genders); frequency of deferral 
did not differ between 11- to 12-year-
old girls and boys (P = .56) but was 
slightly higher for boys than for girls 
in the 13- to 15-year-old age group

(P < .0001). As shown in Table 
3, being in private practice, in a 
suburban location, having ≥50% 
of patients with private insurance, 
and having ≥50% of patients 
who are non-Hispanic white were 
characteristics associated with 
reporting higher frequency of 
parental deferral. Eighty-eight 
percent of pediatricians and 67% 
of FP reported that they were very 
likely to bring up HPV vaccination 
again at a future visit if a parent had 
previously deferred initiation of the 
vaccine series; 10% of pediatricians 
and 23% of FP were somewhat 
likely to bring it up again; and 2% of 
pediatricians and 10% of FP were not 
at all or only a little likely to bring it 
up again.
Physician Discussion of HPV Vaccine
As shown in Table 4, 67% of 
pediatricians and 50% of FP almost 
always or always discuss HPV 
vaccination among 11- to 12-year-
olds. Among the 118 pediatricians 
who did not almost always/always 
discuss the HPV vaccine at well 
visits for all age groups, the most 
commonly reported reasons for not 
discussing the topic were: “I know 
the patient is not yet sexually active” 
(54%), “I think the patient is too 
young” (38%), “the patient is already 
getting other vaccines at that visit” 
(35%), and “I expect the parents to 
refuse” (29%). Among the 104 FP 
who did not almost always/always 
discuss the HPV vaccine, the most

commonly reported reasons for not 
discussing the vaccine were: “I don’
t 
have enough time to discuss” (47%), 
“I know the patient is not yet sexually

too young” (28%), and “I expect the

Physician and Practice 
Characteristics Associated With 
Discussion and Recommendation of 
HPV Vaccine
Compared with physicians who 
frequently or almost always/always 
discuss the HPV vaccine at the 11- to 
12-year well-child visits for girls and 
boys (n = 419), those who rarely/
never or only occasionally discuss 
the HPV vaccine (n = 92) were more 
likely to be FP (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR]: 2.0 [95% confidence interval 
(CI): 1.1–3.5]), be male (aOR: 1.8; 
95% CI 1.1–3.1), disagree that 
parents are more likely to accept 
the HPV vaccine if discussed in 
context of other vaccines (aOR: 2.3 
[95% CI: 1.3–4.2]), report 25% to 
49% (aOR: 2.8 [95% CI: 1.1–6.8]) or 
≥50% (aOR: 7.8 [95% CI: 3.4–17.6]) 
of parents defer the vaccine when 
offered to their child at 11 to 12 
years of age, and express concern 
about waning immunity (aOR: 3.4 
[95% CI: 1.8–6.4]). Practice location, 
setting, knowledge that the HPV 
vaccine produces a stronger antibody 
response in younger adolescents 
compared with adults, and belief 
that it is necessary to discuss sexual 
health issues were not significantly 
associated with physician discussion 
of HPV vaccination at 11 to 12 years.

recommend giving the vaccine to 
girls at 11 to 12 years of age versus 
physicians who do not strongly 
recommend the vaccine using the 
same predictor variables described 
earlier, significant factors and aORs 
were similar to those reported except 
specialty and physician gender 
were not significant factors. In the 
multivariable analysis comparing 
physicians who strongly recommend 
the vaccine be given to boys at 11 
to 12 years of age versus physicians 
who do not recommend it, results 
were similar to those reported earlier 
except physician gender and concern 
about waning immunity were not 
significant factors.
DISCUSSION
Our survey of a nationally 
representative sample of 
pediatricians and FP indicates that 
although most administer the HPV 
vaccine, more than one-third are not 
strongly recommending this vaccine 
at age 11 to 12 years and are less 
likely to strongly recommend the 
vaccine for boys. Similarly, one-third 
of pediatricians and one-half of FP do 
not always discuss HPV vaccination 
at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. FP, 
physicians who are concerned about 
waning immunity, physicians who 
disagree that parents are more likely 
to accept the HPV vaccine if discussed 
in the context of other recommended 
vaccines, and physicians who 
perceive that parents are likely to 
defer the vaccine for their children 
are less likely to discuss HPV 
vaccination at 11 to 12 years of age.
An analysis of data from the 2010 
National Immunization Survey–
Teen indicated that 31% of parents 
of teen-aged girls had delayed or 
refused the HPV vaccine.13 Compared 
with girls whose parents had neither 
delayed nor refused the HPV vaccine, 
girls whose parents had delayed 
the vaccine were more likely to 
be non-Hispanic white, live in a 
higher income household, and not 
be Vaccines for Children Program 
entitled. Although we cannot 
compare our results regarding 
physicians’
 perceptions of parental 
delay directly with the data from 
the National Immunization Survey–
Teen, our findings were similar in 
that physicians in private practice, 
with a higher percentage of patients 
with private insurance, and a 
higher percentage of non-Hispanic 
white patients were more likely to 
report parental deferral than other 
physicians.
Physicians’
 perceptions of parental 
attitudes may not always be accurate. 
A recent study asked parents to rank 
the importance of several vaccines 
on a scale of 0 to 10 and then asked 
health care providers to estimate 
parental responses.14 The median 
ranking from parents for the HPV 
vaccine was 9.3, which was similar 
to their rankings for other vaccines. 
However, the median physician 
estimate of parental ranking for the 
HPV vaccine was 5.2, which was 
considerably lower than physician 
estimates for other vaccines (mostly 
>9).
Physicians’
 perceptions are 
important for vaccine delivery 
because physicians who perceive 
that parents are likely to defer HPV 
vaccination are less likely to discuss 
the vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-
old visit based on findings from our 
study and others.15,16 In addition, 
we found that 12% of pediatricians 
and 33% of FP were only somewhat 
likely or unlikely to bring up the 
HPV vaccine again if parents initially 
deferred. If physicians do not discuss 
the vaccine, they have no opportunity 
to provide a strong recommendation 
or to understand and address 
parents’
 knowledge gaps or to elicit 
concerns. Physicians themselves 
may have knowledge gaps about 
the prevalence of HPV infection and 
burden of HPV-attributable cancers. 
Our finding that physicians were 
less likely to strongly recommend 
the HPV vaccine to boys than to girls 
is concerning given that more than 
one-third of HPV-attributable cancers 
occur in men.1 The lack of a strong 
recommendation may contribute 
to missed opportunities for HPV 
vaccination because it is accepted 
that a strong recommendation for 
HPV vaccination from a physician 
is associated with receipt of the 
vaccine.9,17–19 Qualitative and survey 
data, as well as some preliminary 
intervention studies, suggest that 
many parents may accept the 
HPV vaccine for their child at 11 
to 12 years if their knowledge 
gaps and concerns are addressed 
by the physician in conjunction 
with a strong recommendation for 
vaccination.8,20–24
In addition to expecting parents 
to refuse the HPV vaccine, FP and 
pediatricians who do not routinely 
discuss HPV vaccination at the 
11- to 12-year-old visit reported 
patient age and knowing the patient 
is not sexually active as reasons for 
deferring discussion. Physicians may 
defer discussion of HPV vaccination 
because they perceive that their 
patient population is likely to return 
for visits later in adolescence. 
However, in studies of adolescent 
visit patterns with mainly white and 
privately insured patients, preventive 
care visits declined after the age of 
13 to 14 years.25,26 Physicians may 
perceive that their patient population 
is unlikely to acquire HPV. Although 
the average age of sexual debut 
differs according to gender, race, and 
ethnic group, approximately one-
third of all youth will have had sexual 
intercourse by 16 years of age, and 
HPV infection occurs within a few 
years of becoming sexually active.6,27 
Physicians who defer discussion 
of HPV vaccine may change their 
practices if they understand these 
reasons for vaccinating early. In our 
multivariable analysis, physicians 
who were concerned about waning 
immunity were less likely to 
routinely discuss the HPV vaccine 
at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. This

concern may be partly based on the 
recommendation for a booster dose 
of the quadrivalent meningoccocal 
conjugate vaccine at age 16 years 
after a prior recommendation for 
1 dose at age 11 to 12 years.28 The 
data available show no evidence of 
waning protection for 9 to 10 years’
 
postvaccination.6,29 Physicians 
should be provided with this 
information and updated as new 
data emerge over time. Because FP 
are less likely to routinely discuss 
the HPV vaccine at 11 to 12 years, 
they should be targeted in education 
efforts. Finally, physicians who 
believed that parents are less likely 
to accept the HPV vaccine if discussed 
in the context of other adolescent 
vaccines were less likely to discuss 
it at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. 
In contrast, qualitative studies of 
health care providers’
 approaches 
to HPV vaccination have found that 
those who recommend all adolescent 
vaccines together believe this 
approach leads to higher uptake.15,24
Our study has some limitations. 
Although we have previously 
shown that the surveyed physicians 
are generally representative of 
physicians in the AAP and AAFP 
with respect to demographic and 
practice characteristics and locations 
throughout the United States, those 
who agreed to be surveyed might 
have different attitudes and practices 
than those who chose not to be in 
the network and those who did not 
respond to the survey.10 Physicians’
 
practices were self-reported and not 
directly observed, and we did not 
specifically define what behaviors 
constituted discussion of HPV vaccine 
or a “strong recommendation.”
CONCLUSIONS
Many physicians report experiencing 
parental deferral of HPV vaccine for 
their 11- to 12-year-old patients, and 
this expectation of deferral may cause 
them to avoid discussing the HPV 
vaccine. Ongoing public health efforts 
may promote positive parental 
attitudes about the HPV vaccine and 
reduce physicians’
 experience with 
parental deferral. Because some 
physicians could be overestimating 
the likelihood of parental deferral, 
they should be encouraged to rethink 
their assumptions about parental 
attitudes regarding the HPV vaccine 
and strongly recommend it at every 
11- to 12-year-old well-child visit. 
Our results indicate that physicians 
themselves may need a clearer 
understanding of the reasons to 
vaccinate against HPV at 11 to 12 
years old versus later in adolescence 
and the reasons to vaccinate boys. 
In addition, physicians may need 
guidance on discussing these 
reasons with parents. Future 
research could investigate whether 
public health efforts directed at 
parents, education of physicians 
by professional organizations, 
and tools from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
and professional organizations will 
increase physicians’
 discussion of 
the HPV vaccine and strength of 
recommendation for 11- to 12-year-
old girls and boys.30
