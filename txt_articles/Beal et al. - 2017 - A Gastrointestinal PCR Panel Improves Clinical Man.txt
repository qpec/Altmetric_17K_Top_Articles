ABSTRACT
Conventional methods for the identification of gastrointestinal patho-
gens are time-consuming and expensive and have limited sensitivity. The aim of this
study was to determine the clinical impact of a comprehensive molecular test, the
BioFire FilmArray gastrointestinal (GI) panel, which tests for many of the most com-
mon agents of infectious diarrhea in approximately 1 h. Patients with stool cultures
submitted were tested on the GI panel (n � 241) and were compared with control
patients (n � 594) from the year prior. The most common organisms detected by
the GI panel were enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC, n � 21), norovirus (n �
21), rotavirus (n � 15), sapovirus (n � 9), and Salmonella (n � 8). Patients tested on
the GI panel had an average of 0.58 other infectious stool tests compared with 3.02
in the control group (P � 0.0001). The numbers of days on antibiotic(s) per patient
were 1.73 in the cases and 2.12 in the controls (P � 0.06). Patients with the GI panel
had 0.18 abdomen and/or pelvic imaging studies per patient compared with 0.39
(P � 0.0002) in the controls. The average length of time from stool culture collec-
tion to discharge was 3.4 days in the GI panel group versus 3.9 days in the controls
(P � 0.04). The overall health care cost could have decreased by $293.61 per patient
tested. The GI panel improved patient care by rapidly identifying a broad range of
pathogens which may not have otherwise been detected, reducing the need for
other diagnostic tests, reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics, and leading to a
reduction in hospital length of stay.

iarrheal diseases are a major cause of emergency department (ED) visits and
hospitalization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported
that foodborne diseases account for approximately 76 million illnesses per year in the
United States (1). Conventional methods for identification of a pathogen, for example,
antigen tests, microscopic examinations, and culture, are time-consuming and expen-
sive and have limited sensitivity. These limitations cause several downstream effects.
Patients who may benefit from antibiotics may not receive them in a timely manner
because an organism is not identified within a time frame that would be reasonable to
initiate treatment. While awaiting results, patients with severe disease or complex
clinical histories (i.e., numerous comorbidities) may be admitted to the hospital or
undergo more invasive or expensive testing, such as colonoscopy or abdominal imag-
ing studies. The CDC recommends that patients with suspected infectious diarrhea be

 put on contact precautions empirically (2); therefore, in the absence of laboratory
results, patients may be isolated unnecessarily (3).
This study aimed to determine the clinical impact of a new comprehensive molec-
ular panel, the FilmArray gastrointestinal panel (GI panel) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake
City, UT). This PCR panel tests for many of the most common agents of infectious
diarrhea, including bacteria, parasites, and viruses, in approximately 1 h. We hypothe-
sized that patients with a sample tested on the GI panel would have a shorter length
of hospital stay and decreased time on antibiotics, which are often not needed for
many causes of gastroenteritis. Also, we sought to determine if the GI panel lessened
the need for more invasive and expensive tests, and we used certain abdominal
imaging studies as a marker of these. Many of the organisms on the GI panel are not
routinely tested for, and this enabled us to determine the rate at which organisms were
detected that would have otherwise not been found.
(Part of this research was presented in a poster at the American Academy of Clinical
Chemistry Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, July 2017.)
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. This study took place at the University of Florida (UF) Health Shands Hospital, a
972-bed, tertiary care, academic medical center in Gainesville, Florida. The microbiology laboratory
identified ED or admitted patients (n � 241) with stool samples submitted with an order for stool culture
from 6 June 2016 to 5 June 2017. The sample that was submitted for stool culture was additionally tested
on the GI panel. Physicians were not informed that the GI panel would be performed when they ordered
a stool culture. Prior to implementation, there was no formal communication to providers that the
evaluation was beginning; there was essentially no education regarding the new assay. Historical
controls (n � 594) were those patients with stool cultures from 1 June 2015 to 31 December 2015. The
following data were collected from the patients’medical records: age, gender, date of admission, date
of discharge, disposition from the ED (admitted versus discharged), date/time of stool sample collection,
and date/time of GI panel result in the GI panel patients or stool culture result in historical control
patients. Patients with a length of stay greater than 14 days were excluded from our study. Additional
stool tests, antibiotic days, and imaging studies were identified if they were performed within the
patient’
s hospital stay after the stool collection. Additional stool tests included Clostridium difficile PCR in
GI panel patients and C. difficile PCR, ova and parasite examination, Giardia/Cryptosporidium antigen
enzyme immunoassay (EIA), Microsporidia stain, modified acid fast stain, rotavirus antigen EIA, Shiga-like
toxin EIA, Yersinia stool culture, and Vibrio stool culture in the historical control patients. “Antibiotic days”
comprised the number of days in which at least one dose of any of the following medications was given:
erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole,
vancomycin, nitazoxanide, and ceftriaxone. Imaging studies included computed tomography (CT),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and X-ray, of the abdomen and/or pelvis. The pediatric
study population included patients �18 years of age at the time of admission to the hospital. Length of
stay (LOS) analyses excluded patients who were discharged directly from the ED or who died during
admission. For patients included in LOS analyses, the LOS did include time spent in the ED.
Standard methods. All conventional tests that were ordered on the stool specimen were performed
(unless excluded due to sample requirements), and results were released throughout the study period,
regardless of initiation of the GI panel. Stool cultures were performed by inoculating blood, MacConkey
agar, Hektoen enteric agar, campylobacter (CAMPY) agar, and Gram-negative broth. Non-lactose-
fermenting organisms on MacConkey agar were further worked up with Gram staining, biochemical
testing, spot tests, Vitek II (bioMérieux, Marcy l’
Etoile, France) identification cards, and/or matrix-
associated laser desorption–ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) performed on
the Vitek MS (bioMérieux, Marcy l’
Etoile, France). Vibrio and Yersinia cultures were ordered and performed
separately using specialized media. Ova and parasite examination included gross examination, concen-
trated wet preparation, and trichrome staining. Other assays included the Cepheid Xpert C. difficile assay
(Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), the ImmunoCardStat! rotavirus assay (Meridian Biosciences, Cincinnati, OH),
the ImmunoCardStat! enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) assay (Meridian Biosciences, Cincinnati,
OH) for Shiga toxins 1 and 2, Giardia/Cryptosporidium Quik Chek (Alere, Inc., Waltham, MA), and IBD EZ
VUE (TechLab, Blacksburg, VA) for fecal lactoferrin. Of note, norovirus PCR must be ordered via a
miscellaneous test order; this test is mailed to our reference laboratory.
FilmArray GI panel. The GI panel tests for Campylobacter (C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. upsaliensis),
Clostridium difficile (toxin A/B), Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio (V.
parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. cholerae), Vibrio cholerae, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC),
enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) lt/st, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli
Stx1/Stx2, E. coli O157, Shigella/enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora cayetanensis,
Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, adenovirus F40/41, astrovirus, norovirus genogroup I/II, rotavirus
A, and sapovirus (I, II, IV, and V). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’
s instructions
on a FilmArray 2.0 system. Hands-on time is less than 3 min, and run time is approximately 1 h. Tests were
performed in real time or near real time on stool samples submitted from the ED or hospital ward with
an order for a stool culture Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and results were released into the

 electronic health record (EHR). Results were accompanied by a statement regarding the product
evaluation and, depending on the organism, a comment about the significance of the organism (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material). The Department of Infection Prevention and Control also
reviewed the results in real time during business hours via Theradoc (Premier, Inc., Charlotte, NC) to
determine the appropriate level of isolation precautions. Results from the GI panel for C. difficile were not
included in the EHR results.
Historical control population. Patients with stool cultures submitted in the year prior to imple-
mentation of the GI panel served as a historical control group. These patients were limited by stool
culture collection Monday through Friday, irrespective of time (i.e., not limited to 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. like the
intervention group). Additionally, patients with a length of stay of �14 days were excluded from the
study.
Cost analysis. The cost per test for conventional tests is shown below (see Table 4). These costs are
direct laboratory costs and do not include personnel time. The list price of the FilmArray GI panel is $155
per test. Hospital stay costs were approximated to be $800 per day, and radiology costs were as follows:
X-ray, $55; ultrasound, $55; CT scan, $51; and MRI, $165 (as published by Sistrom and McKay [4]). All costs
listed were irrespective of patient charges or reimbursement.
Data and statistics. Clinical data for endpoint variables were obtained from electronic medical
records through the use of report writing software (SAP Business Objects).
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3. Descriptive statistics and frequency tables were
used to summarize our data, and unpaired t tests (Student’
s t test) were used to determine if there was
a statistically significant difference in endpoint variables between our case and control populations. In
SAS, we used “proc ttest”and obtained our P values via the “pooled”method. We used “proc univariate”
to obtain descriptive statistics for our continuous dependent variables.
This project was registered in the University of Florida’
s Quality Improvement Project Registry
(project ID 236).
RESULTS
A total of 241 patients (180 adults and 61 children) were tested on the GI panel.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of all organisms identified. The most common organ-
isms identified were EPEC (n � 21), norovirus (n � 21), rotavirus (n � 15), sapovirus (n �
9), and Salmonella (n � 8). All organisms on the GI panel, except Entamoeba histolytica,
were identified at least once. The overall positivity rate was 32.8% (55.8% in pediatric
patients versus 15.6% in adults).
There were 19 (7.9% of total and 24% of positive specimen) samples with more than
one organism identified by the GI panel. Five of these had three organisms identified.
There were numerous combinations of organisms, as shown in Table 1. EPEC was
involved in 12 of these mixed infections.

 Table 2 shows the order frequency and percent positivity of conventional methods
performed on patients tested by the GI panel. Of 4 patients who were positive for
Campylobacter on the GI panel, 2 (50%) were positive by culture. The patient with
Cyclospora found on the GI panel did not have a modified acid-fast stool smear ordered.
Of the five patients with Cryptosporidium and Giardia identified by the GI panel, only 2
had an ova and parasite examination ordered, and samples from both patients were
improperly collected and could not be tested. None of these patients had a Crypto-
sporidium/Giardia antigen EIA ordered. Of two patients found with Vibrio cholerae, one
had a Vibrio stool culture ordered. The patient with Shiga-like toxin had an EIA ordered,
which was negative. Of 15 patients with rotavirus, 2 had a rotavirus EIA ordered, both
of which were positive. None of the 21 patients with norovirus had a norovirus PCR
ordered.

 In the historical control cohort (n � 594), the positivity rate for conventional
methods was 6.7% (3.4% in adults and 15.6% in pediatric patients). The most common
organisms identified were Salmonella (n � 20) and Campylobacter (n � 7). The full
distribution of organisms identified by various conventional methods is shown in Table
3. There was a single mixed infection (one sample with both Giardia and Cryptospo-
ridium identified by EIA). The conventional tests that were performed and the cost per
test are shown in Table 4. The average cost of testing per patient in the historical cohort
was $61.18.
Table 5 shows demographics and clinical outcomes. The GI panel result was
available in the EHR after an average of 8.94 h versus 54.75 h for stool culture results.
Stool cultures which were positive for a pathogen often had a preliminary result
available in the EHR in a shorter period of time, but these data were not captured.
Patients with the GI panel had an average of 0.58 additional stool tests (C. difficile PCR)
versus an average of 3.02 additional stool tests per patient (P � 0.0001) in the historical

(95% confidence limit, 1.89 to 2.35) days per patient (P � 0.06) in the GI panel and
historical control groups, respectively. Patients with the GI panel had 0.18 imaging
studies per patient compared with 0.39 (P � 0.0002) studies per patient in the historical
control group (Table 6).
A total of 222 patients with the GI panel and 505 historical control patients were
included in the length-of-stay analysis (18 GI panel and 77 historical control patients
were discharged from the ED; 1 GI panel patient and 12 historical control patients died
during their admission). The average length of stay was 5.2 � 3.2 days in the GI panel
group versus 5.6 � 3.4 days in the control group (P � 0.14). The time from stool
collection to discharge was 3.4 � 2.9 days in the GI panel group and 3.9 � 3.1 days in
the control group (P � 0.04). The LOS index (observed divided by Vizient expected) was
1.1 in the GI panel group versus 1.2 in the historical control group (P � 0.11). Twelve
patients (5.4%) in the GI panel group were discharged before a result was available
compared with 172 (34.1%) patients in the historical control group. Of these patients,
5 (2.3%) in the GI panel group and 18 (3.6%) in the historical group had a positive result
unknown at the time of discharge. Details are shown in Table 7. Considering all the
above factors, the total health care costs were estimated to be $293.61 per patient
lower in GI panel patients than in historical controls (Table 8).

 DISCUSSION
Our study evaluated 241 stool culture samples on the FilmArray GI panel. Results
were released into the EHR. We then retrospectively analyzed downstream clinical
management in these patients in comparison with a historical control population. We
found that the GI panel had a high (32.8%) positivity rate which was similar to that of
other published studies (5–8). Piralla et al. (9) tested 168 adult and pediatric patients
with diarrhea and found an overall 54.8% positivity rate, with 28.3% having more than
one organism. We found that 24% of positive samples had more than one organism.
The slightly lower numbers seen in our study may be accounted for by C. difficile, which
was reported in the study of Piralla et al. but not ours. They also only tested unformed
stool samples, but we did not have this requirement.
Syndromic testing has been the standard of care for respiratory diseases for many
years. In a point-counterpoint (10) discussion regarding respiratory panels, the coun-
terpoint author stated that testing should be guided by clinical history and symptoms.
This is certainly how physicians were previously taught to select from the myriad of
tests available for gastroenteritis. Our study design allowed us to analyze the provider’
s
orders with the GI panel result since they could not order the GI panel and did not
know that they were going to obtain the GI panel result. Organisms that may have been
missed included significant pathogens, such as Campylobacter in two patients, Vibrio
cholerae in one patient, Cyclospora in one patient, Shiga-like toxin in one patient,

 Giardia in four patients, both Cryptosporidium and Giardia in one patient, and norovirus
in 21 patients. It is possible that the physicians had become used to seeing the results
of the GI panel and assumed that they did not need to order the conventional tests;
alternatively, they could have been using a stepwise approach to ordering, starting with
a stool culture, and would have then progressed to additional tests if needed but did
not need to do so because the result of the GI panel was released. One final possibility
is that the Campylobacter, Shiga toxin, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia results identified by
the GI panel were false positives, as they were not confirmed by conventional methods;
however, this is unlikely, as these organisms fit well with the patients’clinical scenarios
and the sensitivity of PCR is higher than that of culture, microscopy, or EIA (9).
Stockmann et al. (7) retrospectively performed the FilmArray GI panel on 378 diarrhea
samples which had been collected for C. difficile and/or other stool pathogen testing.
In 91 patients who had a sample submitted only for C. difficile testing, the GI panel
identified Salmonella, Campylobacter, norovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, and Giardia alone
or in combination with C. difficile. Similar to what was seen in our study, tests for these
additional organisms were not otherwise done.
Our study analyzed clinical data with the goal of assessing the downstream impact
of the test. Patients who had samples tested by the GI panel had fewer additional stool
tests, fewer imaging studies, and fewer days on antibiotics. Since a large portion of the
results did not require antimicrobial treatment, numerous patients were able to avoid
additional days of antibiotic exposure and the associated adverse effects. Additionally,
perhaps the GI panel result enabled the clinical team to choose not to pursue imaging
studies in search of a reason for the patient’
s symptoms. One patient had previously
been worked up extensively over a 6-month period for right upper quadrant pain with
several colonoscopies, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCP), up-
per endoscopies, and several other procedures and tests before coming to our hospital
for evaluation. Her stool sample was submitted for stool culture and the GI panel
identified Cyclospora. No further testing was performed, and she was discharged with
appropriate treatment.
The overall length of stay decreased by 0.5 days in the GI panel group, as did the
length of time from stool collection to discharge. It is likely that knowledge of the
etiology of the patient’
s signs and symptoms allowed for prompt clinical management.
As a large proportion of patients were negative for pathogens, this information may
have allowed clinicians to pursue and treat other potential causes of gastrointestinal
disease.
There are limited publications regarding cost savings with the use of any gastroin-
testinal pathogen panel. In our study, overall health care costs were $293.61 lower in
the GI panel group. This is mostly attributable to a decreased length of stay. One study
(11) performed in the United Kingdom used a parallel diagnostic model on 800
patients. They estimated that lab costs would have been an additional �$34,800 if a
multiplex PCR panel had been used instead of conventional testing but that there
would have been a savings in isolation costs of �$69,500. We were unable to collect
isolation data due to the complexity of the isolation process and because of the
numerous reasons for isolation. There were patients in our study who were found to
have norovirus, rotavirus, and sapovirus who were not in isolation. Of note, we did not
report C. difficile and therefore performed an additional test when ordered. Cost savings
might be more substantial if C. difficile had been reported from the GI panel. Of note,
personnel time was not calculated in the cost analysis. If the GI panel had been used
instead of conventional methods, medical technologist time may likely have been
saved or (more likely) utilized for other laboratory tests.
Our study has several limitations. We did not inform clinicians that we were
performing the GI panel at the time of stool culture order entry, and the GI panel results
were not actively communicated to the provider, so the clinicians may not have
thought to follow up on the stool culture result within hours of submitting the sample.
We did not confirm results in which the GI panel and the conventional testing did not

 agree. Finally, we used a historical cohort of patients to serve as a control group; a
randomized controlled trial would have been superior.
Subjective feedback from the hospital medical staff and the medical technologists
was overwhelmingly positive. After the study concluded and the lab no longer per-
formed the GI panel, the lab received several calls requesting it. Numerous patients
with acute gastroenteritis do not ever have an infectious disease workup ordered
because of the low sensitivity and long turnaround time of conventional diagnostic
methods (12), but we speculate that these newer, more rapid, and comprehensive
methods may lead to increased stool testing and pathogen identification.
Conclusions. Multiplex gastrointestinal panels have the potential to increase the
detection of important pathogens. This coupled with a rapid turnaround time has
several downstream effects, such as more appropriate use of antibiotics and isolation.
Knowledge of the etiology of the patient’
s symptoms was associated with shorter
length of stay and fewer imaging studies. Although in-lab costs increased with the use
of the GI panel, our study observed a decrease in overall health care costs.
