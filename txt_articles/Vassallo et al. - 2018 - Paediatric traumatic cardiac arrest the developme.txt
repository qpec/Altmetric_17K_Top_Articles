Key messages
What is already known on this subject
 
► Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest is a high 
acuity, low frequency event.
 
► Key to the improvement in survival observed 
in the adult population has been the adoption 
of an aggressive and standardised approach 
to resuscitation in victims of traumatic cardiac 
arrest.
 
► There is currently a lack of consensus as to 
the optimum management of the paediatric 
patient in traumatic cardiac arrest, with no 
standardised approach available.
What this study adds
 
► Based on a previously reported Delphi study, 
this paper provides the first consensus-based 
algorithm for the management of paediatric 
traumatic cardiac arrest.
 
► By providing this algorithm, we believe that 
a standardised and aggressive approach can 
be undertaken in major trauma centres and in 
trauma units.
AbsTrACT
Introduction Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) 
is a high acuity, low frequency event. Traditionally, 
survival from TCA has been reported as low, with 
some believing resuscitation is futile. Within the adult 
population, there is growing evidence to suggest that 
with early and aggressive correction of reversible causes, 
survival from TCA may be comparable with that seen 
from medical out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Key to 
this survival has been the adoption of a standardised 
approach to resuscitation. The aim of this study was, by 
a process of consensus, to develop an algorithm for the 
management of paediatric TCA for adoption in the UK.
Methods A modified consensus development meeting 
of UK experts involved in the management of paediatric 
TCA was held. Statements discussed at the meeting were 
drawn from those that did not reach consensus (positive/
negative) from a linked three-round online Delphi study. 
19 statements relating to the diagnosis, management 
and futility of paediatric TCA were initially discussed 
in small groups before each participant anonymously 
recorded their agreement with the statement using ’yes’, 
’no’ or ’don’t know’. In keeping with our Delphi study, 
consensus was set a priori at 70%. Statements reaching 
consensus were included in the proposed algorithm.
results 41 participants attended the meeting. Of 
the 19 statements discussed, 13 reached positive 
consensus and were included in the algorithm. A single 
statement regarding initial rescue breaths reached 
negative consensus and was excluded. Consensus was 
not reached for five statements, including the use of 
vasopressors and thoracotomy for haemorrhage control 
in blunt trauma.
Conclusion In attempt to standardise our approach 
to the management of paediatric TCA and to improve 
outcomes, we present the first consensus-based 
algorithm specific to the paediatric population. While 
this algorithm was developed for adoption in the UK, 
it may be applicable to similar healthcare systems 
internationally. 
InTrOduCTIOn
Paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is a high 
acuity, low frequency event. Less than 15 cases 
are reported per year in the UK.1 Traditionally, 
survival has been reported as low, with some studies 
suggesting that resuscitation of children in TCA is 
futile with universally poor outcomes.2 However, 
there is growing evidence that with early and aggres-
sive correction of potentially reversible causes in 
the adult population, survival rates from TCA are 
comparable with that seen with medical out-of-hos-
pital cardiac arrests.3 4 Key to this survival has been 
the adoption of a standardised approach to TCA 
management and the development of specific TCA 
algorithms.4 These are now taught as part of trauma 
life support courses including the European Trauma 
Course and are endorsed by the European Resus-
citation Council.5 Currently, there is no specific or 
standardised approach to paediatric TCA, but both 
the APLS and European Paediatric Advanced Life 
Support courses advocate the standard basic life 
support approach, along with the correction of 
identified reversible causes and the regular adminis-
tration of epinephrine.6 7
In 2013, both Lockey and Sherren published 
guidelines for the management of TCA in adults 
within their respective organisations (London’s 
Air Ambulance and Sydney HEMS), describing 
the evidence-based rationale for the approaches 
contained within.8 9 Subsequently in 2015 and

Concept/definition of paediatric traumatic cardiac arrest 
(TCA)
 
► Blunt and penetrating trauma should be treated differently.
 
► Absent palpable pulses or no signs of life should trigger a 
paediatric TCA algorithm.
 
► The absence of cardiac activity on ultrasound should trigger 
a paediatric TCA algorithm.
Process
 
► Whole blood therapy improves survival.
 
► Warmed blood/fluids improves survival.
 
► Rapid volume replacement improves survival.
 
► Thoracotomy in penetrating trauma improves survival.
 
► Pericardiocentesis should not be performed in paediatric TCA.
 
► Ensuring oxygenation (via an endotracheal tube or 
supraglottic device) improves survival.
 
► Providing ventilatory support improves survival.
decision to stop
 
► Duration of arrest in paediatric TCA is helpful in determining 
the futility of continued resuscitation.
 
► The lack of response to any intervention is helpful in 
determining the futility of continued resuscitation.
 
► If all invasive procedures have been completed and there 
is no return of spontaneous circulation, this is helpful in 
determining the futility of continued resuscitation.
 
► Cardiac standstill on ultrasound is helpful in determining 
the futility of continued resuscitation, in the presence of 
appropriate resources and a trained operator.

2017, both the European and UK Resuscitation Councils 
published TCA treatment algorithms for adults to inform clin-
ical priorities and intervention.5 However, there is currently no 
accepted national or international guidance specific to children 
in TCA. With a paucity of evidence surrounding the manage-
ment of paediatric TCA and with the majority of clinicians 
only having limited experience, we undertook a programme of 
work to derive expert consensus opinion to define the optimum 
management of paediatric TCA and construct an algorithm to 
guide clinical practice.
We have previously reported a three-round Delphi process 
with an expert panel of 73 participants that achieved consensus 
on 14 statements relating to the recognition, management and 
cessation of paediatric TCA (box 1).10
In this element of the development package, we aimed to: (1) 
explore the statements not reaching consensus during the online 
Delphi phase and (2) incorporate the consensus from both 
phases to develop a national standardised TCA algorithm for 
the paediatric patient (defined as a patient aged 0–16 
years in 
keeping with previous studies).
MeThOds
A modified consensus development conference was held in 
Birmingham, UK, on 8 March 2017. Those who were invited to 
take part in the first round of the Delphi process (n=133) were 
invited to attend the meeting, and additional invitations were 
circulated via the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Paedi-
atric Emergency Research in the UK and Ireland (PERUKI) and 
the Faculty of Prehospital Emergency Care. PERUKI is a collab-
orative network of clinicians from 63 sites across the UK and 
Ireland (including all paediatric major trauma centres), which 
has a focus on improving paediatric emergency care through 
evidence.11
As an open forum, participants (n=41) were not blinded to 
one another. The initial part of the conference involved the 
presentation of existing evidence in the form of topic-specific 
systematic reviews.
The second part of the meeting was dedicated to exploring 
statements that did not reach consensus during the Delphi 
process.10 Nineteen questions relating to the definition, diag-
nosis management and termination of resuscitation of paediatric 
TCA were given to the participants to discuss in small groups of 
between five and seven participants. After 5 
minutes, key points 
from the discussions were presented from each small group to 
all participants.
Subsequently, each individual participant was asked to vote on 
their agreement with the statement in question using electronic 
voting devices, by voting ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘don’t know’. Participants 
were not blinded to one another, but the use of the individual 
electronic voting devices allowed for anonymous voting. The 
study team facilitated the discussions and presented the ques-
tions but did not take part in the voting process.
Consensus was set a priori at 70% of the total number of 
participants responding to each statement. This process was 
repeated for each statement with a single round of voting 
conducted for each statement. For standardisation of responses, 
those not recording a vote for a statement were included in the 
‘don’t know’ category. Results were collated using a Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheet. An algorithm was then constructed using 
statements reaching positive or negative consensus and based 
on adult TCA algorithms previously published. Statements 
that failed to reach consensus have not been included in the 
algorithm.
In keeping with previous work, TCA was defined as cardiac 
arrest following a primary traumatic mechanism of injury, that 
is, as a result of energy transfer or traumatic body cavity penetra-
tion. Patients in cardiac arrest following mechanisms associated 
with asphyxia or suffocation, drowning and electrocution were 
not included in this definition as their management differs from 
that of TCA.1 4 10

resulTs
In total, 41 individuals from a variety of backgrounds attended 
the consensus development meeting (table 1). The overwhelming 
majority of participants were consultants, mostly from paedi-
atric emergency medicine. Responses to questions are shown in 
table 2, along with the number of participants responding for 
each statement.
Of the 19 statements, 13 reached positive consensus and were 
included in the paediatric TCA algorithm (figure 1). The state-
ment ‘in paediatric TCA, rescue breaths should be given at entry 
to the algorithm’ reached negative consensus and was therefore 
not included in the algorithm. Consensus was not reached for 
five statements.
discussion and rationale for algorithm
This process has for the first time enabled the production of an 
algorithm (figure 1) to guide the management of TCA in the 
paediatric population and to provide a basis for the evaluation 
of outcomes and for identifying areas of further research into 
developing effective systems for the provision of optimal care. 
The algorithm provided in figure 1 bears similarity to existing 
published algorithms for the adult population, focusing on the 
rapid management of potentially reversible causes.7–9 12
Resuscitation algorithms are commonly used in emergency 
medicine, with clinicians trained in their use for the medical 
management of cardiac arrest in both adults and children. In 
high acuity, low frequency situations such as paediatric TCA, the 
provision of an algorithm ensures a standardised and structured 
approach, which can mitigate inevitable human factors stressors. 
This could be even more relevant in hospitals that are not 
designated major trauma centres (equivalent to level 1 trauma 
centres), where resuscitation is being coordinated by a team less 
familiar with managing severe trauma in children. Despite the 
regionalisation of trauma services, 50%–60% of severely injured 
children present initially to hospitals not designated as major 
trauma centres, as a result of either self-presentation, geograph-
ical location or the severity of their injuries.1 13
During the development meeting, it was agreed that paediatric 
TCA should be treated with the same principles across the paedi-
atric age range (0–16 years). The definition of TCA is a patient 
sustaining trauma with no palpable central pulse and either 
agonal or absent spontaneous respirations.5 In clinical practice, 
it was agreed that the absence of signs of life, no palpable pulses 
or a lack of cardiac activity on ultrasound should prompt entry 
into the paediatric TCA algorithm. The lack of cardiac activity 
on ultrasound assumes that an appropriately trained and quali-
fied operator is available to perform the procedure.9
simultaneous life-saving interventions
In keeping with the 2016 updated APLS guidelines, control 
of external haemorrhage is included in initial life-saving inter-
ventions.6 Over the last decade, terrorist incidents in Western 
Europe have increased, bringing a pattern of injuries that have 
traditionally only been seen on the battlefield, including trau-
matic limb amputations and blast injuries.14 While not specific 
to the paediatric population, the indiscriminate nature of these 
attacks frequently results in children being affected.15 When

to a blast injury), the control of external haemorrhage using 
tourniquets and haemostatic dressings is a simple intervention 
associated with increased survival.16 17
In keeping with adult TCA algorithms, consensus was 
reached regarding the initial management of paediatric TCA, 
with the rapid identification and simultaneous correction of 
hypoxia, hypovolaemia, tension pneumothorax and cardiac 
tamponade.8 9 18 This has been represented in the algorithm 
in box 1, which describes a bundle of potentially life-saving 
interventions that should be undertaken simultaneously by the 
resuscitating team. The intention is to provide one algorithm to 
guide management in all circumstances, but there may be occa-
sions where not all of these interventions are appropriate, if a 
reversible cause can be excluded or if the situation is judged to 
be futile, guided by senior clinical decision makers. In the pres-
ence of a multidisciplinary trauma team, the interventions can 
be undertaken simultaneously, but this may be limited by the 
number and skills of the team.
Effective oxygenation and ventilation is a key principle of 
trauma resuscitation, and correcting hypoxia is essential in the 
reversal of hypoxic cardiac arrest.5 During the Delphi process, 
consensus was reached that the correction of hypoxia should 
be optimised where possible by using an endotracheal tube or 
supraglottic device placed by an appropriately skilled individual 
in either the prehospital or hospital environment.
Performing bilateral finger thoracostomies is recommended 
in adult TCA and has replaced needle thoracocentesis in the 
initial management of tension pneumothorax in the context of 
TCA.8 9 This topic was reviewed during the consensus develop-
ment meeting, where it was strongly supported (95.0%) that 
bilateral thoracostomies should be performed instead of needle 
thoracocentesis in paediatric TCA.19 However, we acknowledge

that needle thoracocentesis continues to be taught as the primary 
method of chest decompression on paediatric life support 
courses, and individuals may therefore elect to perform needle 
thoracocentesis ahead of thoracostomy.7
With severe haemorrhage implicated in the majority of revers-
ible cases of paediatric TCA, the rapid identification and reversal 
of hypovolaemia is vital in the attempt to improve survival.1 
Epidemiological studies in both the adult and paediatric popu-
lation demonstrate that, within the UK, the majority of severe 
haemorrhage is within the thoracic cavity and is therefore 
non-compressible.1 4 Consensus was reached during the Delphi 
study that hypovolaemia should be corrected by the rapid resto-
ration of blood volume using warmed whole blood. When blood 
is not immediately available, the temporary use of warmed crys-
talloid infusions was advised. As with the management of the 
critically unwell medical paediatric patient, early circulatory 
access, either via the intravenous or intraosseous route, is essen-
tial in the management of paediatric TCA.20 21
In the context of blunt trauma, the application of an appropri-
ately sized pelvic binder (if not already done in the prehospital 
setting) is part of the management of non-compressible haemor-
rhage and reversal of hypovolaemia for lower girdle injuries.22
Cardiac tamponade following penetrating trauma is well 
described in the adult population, and survival following thora-
cotomy (within 10 
min of cardiac arrest) in this group of patients 
is as high as 18%.23 In keeping with adult recommendations, 
the Delphi group reached consensus favouring thoracotomy for 
penetrating trauma to relieve possible cardiac tamponade. There 
was discussion about the role of thoracotomy in blunt trauma, as 
it can be used to relieve tamponade, contain pulmonary bleeding 
and to apply aortic compression for proximal control of haem-
orrhage below the diaphragm.24 25 However, the group failed to 
reach consensus for or against thoracotomy in blunt paediatric 
TCA, and it is therefore presented as an option for consider-
ation, but without clear recommendation, within the algorithm. 
This remains a key area for future trauma registry work.
While cardiac chest compressions are recommended as the 
mainstay of basic life support for both adult and paediatric 
patients in medical cardiac arrest,26–28 in the TCA setting, 
cardiac chest compressions have been deprioritised in adults 
until potential reversible causes have been addressed.5 The 
consensus meeting achieved unanimous 100% agreement in the 
deprioritisation of chest compressions in both penetrating and 
blunt paediatric TCA. However, the group achieved consensus 
in supporting the delivery of chest compressions once interven-
tions to address the main potentially reversible causes (hypoxia, 
tension pneumothorax, hypovolaemia and cardiac tamponade) 
have been achieved.
The use of vasopressors in the context of trauma to allow 
catch-up with blood products is an area of controversy in adult 
trauma practice, with currently little or no evidence for their use 
and one study demonstrating potential harm from their admin-
istration.29 30 The group failed to reach positive or negative 
consensus on the use of vasopressors (either by bolus or infu-
sion) before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the 
context of any paediatric TCA (including paediatric TCA from 
suspected isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI)). We acknowl-
edge that there may be a small cohort of paediatric patients in 
TCA where the use of vasopressors will be required, particu-
larly in the context of neurogenic shock combined with hypo-
volaemia. After ROSC from paediatric TCA, the group failed 
to achieve consensus regarding the use of vasopressors except 
in the context of those patients with isolated TBI, in which case 
a blood pressure should be maintained at a level sufficient to 
provide neuroprotection but balancing this against the risk of 
destabilising other injuries (including clot formation).
The group supported the deprioritisation of defibrillation of 
a shockable rhythm in the setting of paediatric TCA while other 
reversible causes were addressed (see suggested algorithm). Once 
reversible causes have been addressed, the group supported defibril-
lation in such circumstances where a shockable rhythm is present.
The cessation of resuscitation attempts in children in TCA 
is challenging, and recognition of features suggesting futility is 
important in supporting such a decision. In adult medical cardiac 
arrest, end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) has been used to deter-
mine the futility of continued resuscitation.31 32 While we are 
unaware of similar studies in either the paediatric population 
or TCA cohort, the group agreed that the use of ETCO2 may 
be useful in determining the futility of ongoing resuscitation. 
Reaching the end of the suggested algorithm without ROSC was 
also discussed as a marker of futility and a point at which further 
resuscitation efforts may be withdrawn.
The main limitation for this study is that the algorithm was by 
necessity based on consensus rather than robust clinical evidence. 
The lack of evidence suggests that future research is needed to 
answer some of these research questions. In the meantime, it is 
hoped that reaching consensus on at least some aspects of the recog-
nition and management of patients in TCA will provide a useful 
framework on which clinicians might base their management.
COnClusIOn
Within the UK, paediatric TCA is a high acuity, low frequency 
event. In attempt to standardise our approach to its management 
and to improve outcomes, we present the first consensus-based 
algorithm specific to the paediatric trauma population. This may 
be applicable to similar healthcare systems internationally.
