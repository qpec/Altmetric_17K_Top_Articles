Abstract
Background: Persons unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection account for approximately 40% 
of ongoing transmissions in the United States. Persons are unaware of their infection because of delayed HIV diagnoses 
that represent substantial missed opportunities to improve health outcomes and prevent HIV transmission.
Methods: Data from CDC’s National HIV Surveillance System were used to estimate, among persons with HIV infection 
diagnosed in 2015, the median interval (and range) from infection to diagnosis (diagnosis delay), based on the first CD4 
test after HIV diagnosis and a CD4 depletion model indicating disease progression and, among persons living with HIV 
in 2015, the percentage with undiagnosed infection. Data from CDC’s National HIV Behavioral Surveillance were 
analyzed to determine the percentage of persons at increased risk for HIV infection who had tested in the past 12 months 
and who had missed opportunities for testing.
Results: An estimated 15% of persons living with HIV in 2015 were unaware of their infection. Among the 39,720 
persons with HIV infection diagnosed in 2015, the estimated median diagnosis delay was 3.0 years (interquartile 
range = 0.7–7.8 years); diagnosis delay varied by race/ethnicity (from 2.2 years among whites to 4.2 years among Asians) 
and transmission category (from 2.0 years among females who inject drugs to 4.9 years among heterosexual males). 
Among persons interviewed through National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, 71% of men who have sex with men, 58% 
of persons who inject drugs, and 41% of heterosexual persons at increased risk for HIV infection reported testing in the 
past 12 months. In each risk group, at least two thirds of persons who did not have an HIV test had seen a health care 
provider in the past year.
Conclusions: Delayed HIV diagnoses continue to be substantial for some population groups and prevent early entry to 
care to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV transmission to others.
Implications for Public Health Practice: Health care providers and others providing HIV testing can reduce HIV-
related adverse health outcomes and risk for HIV transmission by implementing routine and targeted HIV testing to 
decrease diagnosis delays.
Introduction
Persons unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection are estimated to account for approximately 
40% of ongoing transmissions in the United States (1). As a 
result of increased testing, the percentage of persons living with 
HIV who are aware of their infection has steadily increased; 
at the end of 2014, an estimated 85% of persons living with 
HIV were aware of their infection, approaching the national 
goal of 90% by 2020 (2). Persons aware of their HIV infection 
reduce their transmission risk behaviors and can enter HIV care 
and take antiretroviral treatment to achieve viral suppression 
(a viral load result of <200 copies/mL, or undetectable levels) 
(3). Viral suppression not only preserves immune function, 
decreasing a person’s risk for morbidity and mortality, but also 
profoundly reduces risk for sexual transmission to others (4–6). 
Early detection of HIV infection maximizes these benefits.
CDC recommends routine testing for HIV infection for 
persons aged 13–64 years in health care settings and testing 
at least annually for persons at high risk for HIV infection 
(7). Yet, according to National HIV Behavioral Surveillance 
(NHBS), one third of gay, bisexual, and other men who have 
sex with men (MSM) have not been tested in the past year, 
with even lower percentages of recent testing reported among 
other population segments at high risk for HIV infection.

* Past year testing was assessed during the interview by asking participants, “When 
did you have your most recent HIV test? Please tell me the month and year.” 
A missed opportunity was defined as a visit to a health care provider in the past 
12 months for a person who did not report past year HIV testing or as not being 
offered an HIV test at any health care visits for a person who did not report past 
year HIV testing and had visited a health care provider in the past year.
† During 2008–2015, 20 cities were included; during 2016, 17 cities were 
included. The following cities were included in all years: Atlanta, Georgia; 
Boston, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Los Angeles, 
California; Miami, Florida; Nassau–Suffolk, New York; New Orleans, 
Louisiana; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Diego, 
California; San Francisco, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Washington, D.C. 
Additional cities were included as follows: 2008–2015, Baltimore, Maryland; 
Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Houston, Texas; New York City, New 
York; Seattle, Washington; 2016, Memphis, Tennessee; Portland, Oregon; 
Virginia Beach/Norfolk, Virginia.
§ Social-structural variables were used to identify a representative sample for 
NHBS of heterosexual persons at increased risk of HIV infection. Heterosexual 
persons at increased risk were defined as male or female (not transgender) in a 
metropolitan statistical area with high AIDS prevalence, who had sex with a 
member of the opposite sex in the past 12 months, never injected drugs, and 
met low income or low education criteria. Low income was defined as not 
exceeding U.S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines 
and low education as having a high school education or less.
were used to estimate the total number of persons living 
with HIV infection (diagnosed and undiagnosed infection, 
or prevalence) at year-end 2015 and the median number of 
years and interquartile range between infection and diagnosis 
(diagnosis delay) of persons with HIV diagnosed in 2015 (8,9). 
The first CD4 test after HIV diagnosis and a CD4 depletion 
model indicating disease progression were used to estimate 
year of infection and the distribution of time from HIV infec-
tion to diagnosis among persons with diagnosed infection (9). 
The distribution of diagnosis delay was used to estimate the 
annual number of HIV infections, which includes persons with 
diagnosed infection and persons with undiagnosed infection. 
HIV prevalence (persons with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV 
infection) was estimated by subtracting reported cumulative 
deaths among persons with HIV infection from cumulative 
HIV infections.
The number of persons with undiagnosed HIV infection was 
estimated by subtracting the number of reported cumulative 
diagnoses from the number of estimated cumulative infections. 
The percentage of undiagnosed infections was determined by 
dividing the number of undiagnosed infections by the total 
HIV prevalence.
Data from NHBS were used to determine the percentage of 
persons at increased risk for infection who were tested in the 
past 12 months and the percentage who missed opportunities 
for testing.* NHBS monitors HIV-associated behaviors and 
HIV prevalence in cities† with high acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence among three populations 
with HIV risk behaviors: MSM, persons who inject drugs, 
and heterosexual persons at increased risk for HIV infection.
Cross-sectional data reported in this analysis are from MSM, 
persons who inject drugs, and heterosexual persons at increased 
risk for HIV infection recruited for face-to-face interviews 
and HIV testing through venue-based sampling (MSM) and 
respondent-driven sampling (persons who inject drugs and 
heterosexual persons) in NHBS surveys from 2008 to 2016. 
NHBS sampling procedures have been previously described (10). 
Persons were eligible to participate if they resided in a participat-
ing city, could complete the survey in English or Spanish, and 
met cycle-specific inclusion criteria (MSM: born male, aged ≥18 
years, identified as male, and had oral or anal sex with another 
man; persons who inject drugs: aged ≥18 years, injected drugs 
in the past 12 months; and heterosexual persons: male or female 
[not transgender], aged 18–60 years, had sex with a member of 
the opposite sex in the past 12 months, never injected drugs, and 
met low income or low education criteria).§ For inclusion in cur-
rent analyses, participants must have tested negative during the 
NHBS cycle, MSM must have had sex with another man in the 
past 12 months, and persons who inject drugs must have been 
male or female (not transgender). Data were analyzed by sex, age, 
and race/ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; 
black or African American [blacks]; Hispanic or Latino; Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; white; and multiple race).
Key Points
• Persons unaware of their human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection account for approximately 40% 
of ongoing transmissions in the United States.
• Eighty-four percent of sexual transmission from men 
who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals is 
estimated to occur from MSM.
• Among persons with HIV infection diagnosed in 2015, 
the estimated median interval from infection to 
diagnosis was 3 years.
• Prior year testing increased over time among groups at 
high risk for HIV infection. However, 29% of MSM, 
42% of persons who inject drugs, and 59% of 
heterosexual persons at increased risk did not report 
testing in the past 12 months. 
• In each risk group, at least two thirds of persons who 
did not have an HIV test had seen a health care provider 
in the past year.
• Continued efforts to ensure routine and targeted testing 
can help reduce the number of persons who are unaware 
of their infection, diagnosis delays, missed opportunities 
for care and treatment, and HIV transmission.

Results
In 2015, among 1,122,900 persons living with HIV infec-
tion, 162,500 (14.5%) were unaware of their infection. The 
percentage of undiagnosed HIV infections ranged from 
5.7% to 18.5% across states (Figure 1); 50.5% of undiag-
nosed infections were in the South. Among 39,720 persons 
with HIV infection diagnosed in 2015, 21.6% had stage 3 
infection (AIDS) at the time of diagnosis, and the estimated 
median interval from HIV infection to diagnosis was 3.0 years 
(Table 1). Diagnosis delays were longer among persons who 
were older at diagnosis than among those who were younger 
(median = 4.5 years among persons aged ≥55 years compared 
with 2.4 years among persons aged 13–24 years) (p<0.01). By 
race/ethnicity, median diagnosis delay ranged from 2.2 years 
among whites to 4.2 years among Asians (p<0.01). Diagnosis 
delay was longer among males (median = 3.1 years) than 
among females (median = 2.4 years) (p<0.01). By transmission 
category, diagnosis delay was longest among males with infec-
tion attributed to heterosexual contact (median = 4.9 years).
Among persons interviewed through NHBS, the percentage 
reporting an HIV test in the 12 months preceding the interview 
increased over time among MSM (from 63% in 2008 to 71% 
in 2014), persons who inject drugs (from 50% in 2009 to 
58% in 2015), and heterosexual persons at increased risk for 
infection (from 34% in 2010 to 41% in 2016) (Figure 2). The 
prevalence of testing in the past 12 months was higher among 
females than among males, among both persons who inject 
drugs (males, 57%; females, 59%), and heterosexual persons 
at increased risk (males, 39%; females, 42%). Prevalence of 
testing was also higher among black persons who inject drugs 
(and heterosexual Asians, although the numbers were small) 
than among persons of other race/ethnicity and persons aged 
25–34 years (and persons aged 35–44 years who inject drugs) 
than among other age categories in each risk group (Table 2).
Among persons interviewed through NHBS who were not 
tested in the past year, most MSM reported that their main 
reason for not testing was that they believed their risk for 
infection was low, whereas most persons who inject drugs and 
heterosexual persons at increased risk reported that they had 
no particular reason for not testing. In each risk group, at least 
two thirds of persons who did not have an HIV test had seen 
a health care provider in the past year (Table 2). Among those 
who had not tested in the past year and had visited a health 
care provider, approximately three quarters reported not hav-
ing been offered an HIV test at any of their health care visits.
Discussion
Fifty percent of persons with HIV infection diagnosed in 
2015 had been infected for at least 3 years, and a quarter had 
been infected for ≥7 years. Diagnosis delays varied substantially 
by population. Although the percentage of persons testing 
increased over time among groups at high risk, overall, 15% 
of persons were unaware of their infection. The prevalence of 
persons unaware of their infection varied among states, and half 
(50.5%) of persons with undiagnosed HIV infection in 2015 
were living in the South. Gaps in testing remain, and missed 
opportunities for testing at health care visits are prevalent. 
Improved testing coverage and frequency are needed to meet 
the goal of at least 90% of persons living with HIV know-
ing their infection status and to reduce diagnosis delays and 
ultimately reduce HIV incidence in the United States (11).
Cultural factors (e.g., stigma, fear, discrimination, and 
homophobia) might contribute to longer diagnosis delays 
in some populations (12). Asians accounted for the highest 
percentage of persons living with undiagnosed HIV infec-
tion compared with all other race/ethnicity groups (13). 
Although blacks were more likely than whites to report 
testing in the past 12 months across all groups at risk, 
the median diagnosis delay was 1 year longer for blacks 
(median = 3.3 years) than for whites (median = 2.2 years). 
The testing results might reflect national efforts to improve 
access to testing among blacks, and black MSM in par-
ticular, through prevention programs and media campaigns. 
In 2007, CDC launched the Expanded Testing Initiative 
(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/eti.html) to facilitate HIV 
diagnosis and linkage to care among blacks and continues to 
support high levels of testing. CDC’s MSM Testing Initiative 
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287201580) scaled

up HIV testing and linkage-to-care activities among black and 
Hispanic or Latino MSM in 11 cities. In addition, CDC imple-
mented Testing Makes Us Stronger (https://www.cdc.gov/
actagainstaids/campaigns/tmus), a public education campaign 
to increase testing among black MSM, from 2011 to 2015.
The longer diagnosis delay among non-white racial/ethnic 
groups might partly reflect the higher proportion of infec-
tions attributable to heterosexual contact among these groups 
compared with whites (14), given that heterosexual persons 
had longer diagnosis delays. Among all transmission catego-
ries, males with infection attributed to heterosexual contact 
had the longest median diagnosis delay (4.9 years). This 
observation was consistent with the finding that heterosexual 
males at increased risk for infection were less likely to report 
testing in the past 12 months than were heterosexual females 
at increased risk. Heterosexual men are less likely to visit a 
health care provider than are both women and MSM, leading 
to fewer opportunities for testing (15). Moreover, compared 
with other risk groups, heterosexual persons at increased risk 
were less likely to have been offered an HIV test even when 
visiting a health care provider in the past 12 months, possibly 
because of low perceived risk for infection (15,16). This finding 
highlights the importance of implementing routine screening 
in health care settings.
A previous estimate¶ of diagnosis delays among persons who 
received a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2011 indicated that 
half had been infected for 3.6 years. The median diagnosis delay 
of 3.0 years among HIV diagnoses in 2015 reflects an absolute 
reduction of 0.6 years (7 months) and a relative reduction of 
17%, representing a considerable decrease over a 4-year period 
(8). Earlier detection of HIV combined with prompt linkage 
¶ The 2011 estimate of diagnosis delay is based on the same CD4 methodology 
used in this report, but CD4 model parameters were updated, and more CD4 
data are available in recent years; therefore, results are not directly comparable.

to care and initiation of antiretroviral treatment enhances 
preservation of immune function and, if viral suppression is 
achieved and maintained, reduces risk for sexual transmission 
of HIV (4). In addition, persons who know they have HIV 
infection substantially reduce their HIV-related risk behaviors: 
the prevalence of unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse was 
found to be 53% lower among persons aware of their HIV 
status than among those who were unaware of their status (17).
For HIV treatment to be effective in reducing HIV inci-
dence, infections need to be diagnosed as quickly as possible. 
This requires increasing HIV testing coverage and frequency. 
CDC recommends testing all persons aged 13–64 years at least 
once as a routine part of medical care and more frequent testing 
(at least annually) for persons at high risk for HIV infection (7). 
A large proportion (84%) of HIV sexually transmitted from 
MSM and heterosexual persons is transmitted by MSM (1). 
Some sexually active MSM might benefit from more frequent 
testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months) (18). Testing according to 
CDC guidelines is critical to diagnosing HIV infection, so that 
anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV infection can start 
antiretroviral treatment. Overall, prior year testing increased 
among groups at high risk over time. However, 29% of MSM 
(in 2014), 42% of persons who inject drugs (in 2015), and 
59% of heterosexual persons at increased risk (in 2016) did 
not report testing in the past 12 months. In addition, it is 
important to note that these data are from persons residing in 
large metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Studies 
have found that persons residing in rural areas are less likely 
to report prior HIV testing, including in the past 12 months, 
compared with their urban counterparts, and that persons 
living in rural areas are more likely to have HIV infection 
diagnosed at a late stage (19,20). Barriers to implementing

routine testing include lack of time, competing priorities, and 
concerns about reimbursement on the health care provider’s 
part and stigma and lack of perceived risk on the client’s part 
(21). Lack of perceived risk was also one of the main reasons 
cited by MSM in NHBS for not testing in the past 12 months.
A recent analysis of HIV testing frequency using NHBS data 
indicated that among persons at high risk for HIV infection 
who were ever tested, the estimated average interval between 
two successive HIV tests decreased from 10.5 months (2009) 
to 7.7 months (2014) among MSM, from 14.4 months (2009) 
to 11.5 months (2015) among persons who inject drugs, and 
from 21.1 months (2010) to 19.9 months (2013) among het-
erosexual persons at increased risk for HIV acquisition (22). 
Although the decreases in testing intervals are encouraging and 
indicate that, on average, MSM and persons who inject drugs 
are meeting recommendations for annual testing, these data are 
among persons already testing. Limited data suggest that MSM 
who have never been tested for HIV might engage in higher 
risk behaviors than do MSM who have been previously tested. 
One study found that MSM who had never been tested were 
1.46 times as likely (95% confidence interval = 1.17–1.81) 
to report condomless anal sex in the past 3 months with an 
HIV-positive or serostatus-unknown partner than were persons 
who tested previously (23).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, missing CD4 test results could be caused by either 
incomplete reporting or not having had a CD4 test done. 
However, 89.4% of persons with HIV infection diagnosed 
in 2015 had a first CD4 test after diagnosis reported by June 
2017. Second, adjustment for missing risk factors might be 
inaccurate if factors associated with these were not accounted 
for in the model. Third, NHBS is not a nationally representa-
tive sample, so results are not generalizable to all cities or to all 
groups at high risk in participating cities. Finally, behavioral 
data are self-reported and subject to social desirability bias.
The interval from HIV infection to diagnosis has decreased 
in recent years, but diagnosis delays continue to be substantial 
for some population segments. Whereas testing in the past 
12 months has increased in recent years among groups at high 
risk, a high proportion of persons in all risk groups remain 
untested, with many missed opportunities for testing. Diagnosis 
delays lead to missed opportunities for HIV care and treatment 
and prolong the time a person is unaware of their infection, 
increasing the potential for HIV transmission. For care and 
treatment to reduce HIV incidence effectively, a high proportion 
of cases need to be diagnosed and treated soon after infection 
occurs. Continued efforts to determine why cases are not being 
diagnosed soon after infection and to assure implementation of 
routine and targeted testing can help reduce both the number of 
persons unaware of their infection and diagnosis delays.
