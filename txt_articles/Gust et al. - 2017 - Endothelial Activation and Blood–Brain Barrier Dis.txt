ABSTRACT 
 
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of CD19-targeted chimeric 
antigen receptor–modifi
 ed T (CAR-T) cells can be complicated by neurologic 
adverse events (AE) in patients with refractory B-cell malignancies. In 133 adults treated with CD19 
CAR-T cells, we found that acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high CD19 
+ cells in bone marrow, high 
CAR-T cell dose, cytokine release syndrome, and preexisting neurologic comorbidities were associated 
with increased risk of neurologic AEs. Patients with severe neurotoxicity demonstrated evidence of 
endothelial activation, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, capillary leak, and increased 
blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The permeable BBB failed to protect the cerebrospinal fl
 uid from 
high concentrations of systemic cytokines, including IFNγ, which induced brain vascular pericyte stress 
and their secretion of endothelium-activating cytokines. Endothelial activation and multifocal vascular 
disruption were found in the brain of a patient with fatal neurotoxicity. Biomarkers of endothelial activa-
tion were higher before treatment in patients who subsequently developed grade ≥4 neurotoxicity. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: We provide a detailed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characterization of neuro-
toxicity after CD19 CAR-T cells, and identify risk factors for neurotoxicity. We show endothelial 
dysfunction and increased BBB permeability in neurotoxicity and fi
 nd that patients with evidence of 
endothelial activation before lymphodepletion may be at increased risk of neurotoxicity.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of 
autologous T cells that are genetically modifi
 ed to express a 
CD19-specifi
 c chimeric antigen receptor (CD19 CAR-T cells) 
has produced high response rates in phase I studies in refrac-
tory CD19 
+ 
 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma (NHL; refs.  
1–6 
). When CD19-specifi
 c CAR-T cells 
encounter CD19 
+ 
 target cells  
in vivo 
, signaling through the 
CAR induces CAR-T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, 
and target cell lysis ( 
7 
). Thus, most patients develop cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS), a systemic infl
 ammatory response 
initiated by T-cell activation and characterized by fever and 
hypotension within the fi
 rst 2 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion 
( 
8, 9 
). Neurologic adverse events (AE) are frequently observed 
in association with or following CRS occurring with CD19 
CAR-T cell therapy, and in rare instances can be fatal ( 
1–6 
); 
however, the pathogenesis of neurotoxicity remains obscure. 
 
Here 
, we provide a detailed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic 
characterization of neurotoxicity resulting from CD19 CAR-T 
cell therapy. The data provide strong evidence for cytokine-
mediated endothelial activation causing coagulopathy, capil-
lary leak, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which 
allows transit of high concentrations of systemic cytokines into 
the cerebrospinal fl
 uid (CSF). In autopsy studies of 2 patients 
who had fatal toxicity, we identifi
 ed evidence of endothelial 
activation that in 1 patient resulted in loss of cerebral vascular 
integrity manifesting as multifocal hemorrhage. We developed a 
predictive classifi
 cation tree algorithm based on the presence of 
fever and high serum IL6 and MCP1 concentrations to identify 
patients within the fi
 rst 36 hours after CAR-T cell infusion who 
are at high risk of subsequent severe neurotoxicity and might 
be candidates for early intervention. Patients with evidence of 
endothelial activation before treatment were at increased risk 
of neurotoxicity after CAR-T cell infusion. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Neurologic AEs after CD19 CAR-T Cell 
Immunotherapy 
 
We studied neurologic AEs in 133 adults with refractory 
B-ALL, NHL, or CLL who received lymphodepletion chemo-
therapy (Supplementary Table S1), followed by infusion of 
CD19 CAR-T cells engineered to express a CD19-specifi
 c CAR 
containing a 4-1BB costimulatory domain (Supplementary 
Data; refs.  
5, 6 
). Within 28 days of CD19 CAR-T cell infusion, 
53 of 133 patients (40%) had 1 or more grade ≥1 neurologic 
AEs ( 
Fig. 1A and B 
), presenting a median of 4 days after CAR-T 
cell infusion. The median time from onset of neurotoxicity to 
the highest neurotoxicity grade was 1 day (range, 0–19), and the

median duration of reversible neurologic AEs was 5 days (range, 
1–70 days). Forty-eight of 53 patients with any neurologic AE 
(91%) also had CRS (Fig. 1C). Five patients with neurologic 
AEs (9%) did not develop CRS; however, all neurologic AEs 
in patients without CRS were mild (grade 1), subjective, and 
transient. CRS with fever (≥38°C) preceded the onset of neu-
rotoxicity in all patients who developed grade ≥3 neurotoxicity 
 
(n = 28). In patients with CRS, neurotoxicity presented a median 
of 4.5 days (range, 2–17 days) after the first fever. Fever occurred 
earlier after CAR-T cell infusion in patients who subsequently 
developed grade ≥3 neurotoxicity compared with those who 
developed grade 1–2 neurotoxicity (P = 0.0007). However, the 
time from CAR-T cell infusion to the onset of neurotoxicity 
 
(P = 0.17) as well as the time to the maximum grade of neurotox-
icity (P = 0.78) were similar (Fig. 1D). These data show that an 
early onset of CRS after CAR-T cell infusion is associated with a 
higher risk of subsequent developing severe neurotoxicity.
Among the 53 patients with neurotoxicity, the most com-
mon finding was delirium with preserved alertness (35/53, 
66%; Supplementary Table S2), which was grade ≤2 in 13 of

35 patients (37%), and present for a median of 4 days (range, 
1–24 days). Headache was observed in 29 of 53 patients 
(55%), was grade ≤2 in 26 of 29 patients (90%), and persisted 
for a median of 3 days (range, 1–12 days). Grade 1–2 head-
ache was the only neurologic AE in 9 patients. A decreased 
level of consciousness occurred in 13 of 53 patients (25%), 
and in 6 cases was associated with coma requiring ventila-
tory support. In those who recovered, the median duration 
of the decreased level of consciousness was 2 days (range, 
1–12 days). Language disturbance was observed in 18 of 53 
patients (34%) for a median of 4 days (range, 1–9) and was 
accompanied in 15 of 18 patients (83%) by decreased level of 
consciousness and/or delirium, which complicated the dis-
tinction between impaired attention and aphasia as the etiol-
ogy of language disturbance. Focal neurologic deficits, ataxia, 
and other abnormal movements were infrequent. Seizures 
occurred in 4 of 53 patients (8%). Seizures in 2 patients with 
grade 5 neurotoxicity occurred in the absence of a prior sei-
zure history. The other 2 patients were among 6 in the study 
with an antecedent seizure history. Macroscopic intracranial 
hemorrhage (ICH) was rare (1/53; 2%), and focal large vessel 
ischemic stroke was not observed by imaging.
Of the entire cohort of 133 patients treated with lym-
phodepletion chemotherapy and CAR-T cells, 7 (5%) devel-
oped grade ≥4 neurotoxicity. Six of these 7 patients were 
treated during the dose-escalation phase of the protocol and 
received CAR-T cell doses that were subsequently determined 
to be above the MTD for each disease and tumor burden. 
Only 1 of 79 patients (1.3%) treated after completion of the 
CAR-T cell dose-escalation phase developed grade ≥4 neuro-
toxicity. Four of 133 patients (3%) died due to neurotoxic-
ity: 1 from multifocal brainstem hemorrhage and edema 
associated with DIC and 2 from acute cerebral edema, and 
1 developed cortical laminar necrosis with a persistent mini-
mally conscious state until death 4 months after CAR-T cell 
infusion. With the exception of those with fatal neurotoxic-
ity and 1 patient in whom a grade 1 neurologic AE resolved 2 
months after CAR-T cell infusion, neurotoxicity completely 
resolved in all patients by day 28 after CAR-T cell infusion 
(Fig. 1B).
Of 53 patients with neurotoxicity, 23 underwent brain MRI 
within 28 days of CAR-T cell infusion. Acute abnormalities 
on MRI were evident in 7 of 23 patients (30%), 4 of whom 
had fatal neurotoxicity, indicating that an abnormal MRI 
scan during acute neurotoxicity is associated with a high risk 
of a poor outcome. T2/FLAIR changes indicative of vaso-
genic edema, leptomeningeal enhancement, and/or multifo-
cal microhemorrhages were present in a majority of patients 
with severe neurotoxicity and abnormal MRI scans. Contrast 
enhancement, consistent with breakdown of the BBB, was 
also seen in some T2/FLAIR lesions (Fig. 2A–F). One patient 
developed extensive cortical diffusion restriction indicative 
of cytotoxic edema (Fig. 2G–I), which appeared distinct from 
vasogenic edema observed in other patients and evolved into 
cortical laminar necrosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) was 
performed in 17 of 53 patients during acute neurotoxicity. 
Diffuse slowing was present in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Focal 
slowing was noted in 1 patient (6%) with known epilepsy, and 
clinical and subclinical seizures were observed in 1 patient. 
EEG was normal in 2 of 17 patients (12%).
Treatment of Neurotoxicity
Tocilizumab, an antagonistic IL6R mAb, effectively ame-
liorates fever and hypotension in most patients who develop 
severe CRS after CD19 CAR-T cells and is frequently admin-
istered with or without corticosteroids to patients with 
neurotoxicity (5, 6). Twenty of 53 patients diagnosed with 
neurotoxicity (38%) received tocilizumab (4–8 mg/kg i.v.) 
and dexamethasone (10 mg i.v. twice a day), 1 (2%) received 
tocilizumab alone, and 6 (11%) received dexamethasone alone 
either before or after the onset of neurotoxicity (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1). Fourteen patients received 1 dose of tocili-
zumab, 5 received 2 doses, and 2 received 3 doses. A median of 
2 doses (range, 1–31) of dexamethasone 10 mg i.v. twice a day 
was administered, and 1 patient received methylprednisolone 
(1,000 mg i.v. ×9). In 14 of the 21 patients (67%) who received 
tocilizumab, the peak grade of neurotoxicity occurred after 
the first dose of tocilizumab, and in 8 of those patients, 
the first presentation of neurotoxicity occurred after tocili-
zumab had been administered for CRS. In patients in whom 
neurotoxicity resolved, the time from the first tocilizumab 
and/or dexamethasone dose to resolution of neurotoxicity 
(median, 4 days; range, 1–64 days) was longer than the time to 
resolution of fever (temperature <38°C for at least 48 hours; 
median, 0.4 days; range, 0–3.8 days; P < 0.0001), suggesting 
that once established, neurotoxicity is less responsive than 
CRS to interventions that suppress IL6 activity or CAR-T cell 
function.
Baseline Characteristics Associated with 
Subsequent Neurotoxicity
We analyzed the baseline patient characteristics to iden-
tify factors associated with an increased risk of subsequent 
neurotoxicity. In univariate analyses (Table 1), neurotoxic-
ity of any grade was more frequent in younger patients (P = 
0.094), those with B-ALL (P = 0.084), a high burden of tumor 
(P = 0.072) and CD19+ cells in bone marrow (P = 0.062), and 
a high CAR-T cell dose (P < 0.0001). The presence of any 
preexisting neurologic comorbidity was also associated with 
neurotoxicity (P = 0.0059). The infused CAR-T cell dose was 
the only factor associated with the occurrence of more severe 
neurotoxicity (grade ≥3 vs. grade 1–2, P = 0.014). The selec-
tion of CD8+ T-cell subset in CAR-T cell manufacturing, the 
patient’s sex and race, the number of prior chemotherapy 
regimens, previous hematopoietic stem cell transplanta-
tion, and pretreatment performance score were not associ-
ated with neurotoxicity in univariate analyses. Multivariable 
analysis showed that preexisting neurologic comorbidities 
 
(P = 0.0023), and factors associated with increased in vivo 
CAR-T cell numbers, including cyclophosphamide and 
fludarabine lymphodepletion (P = 0.0259), higher infused 
CAR-T cell dose (P = 0.0009), and higher burden of malignant 
CD19+ B cells in marrow (P = 0.0165) were associated with an 
increased risk of neurotoxicity (Table 1).
Severe Neurotoxicity Is More Frequent in  
Patients with Severe CRS and Is Associated with 
Systemic Vascular Dysfunction
Consistent with the baseline factors that were associ-
ated with more severe neurotoxicity, we found that patients 
who developed grade ≥3 neurotoxicity had more severe CRS

Stepwise multivariable proportional odds models were performed to assess the impact of baseline factors on the occurrence of neurotoxicity (grade 
0 vs. 1–2 vs. 3–5), where log 
10 values were used to transform data as appropriate, with 0.001 substituting for marrow disease values of 0. Although the 
lymphodepletion regimen did not signifi
 cantly affect the risk of neurotoxicity in the univariate model, it was included in the multivariable model because of 
its association with increased  
in vivo CAR-T cell proliferation. After controlling for CAR-T cell dose and pretreatment tumor burden, the lymphodepletion 
regimen was found to have a signifi
 cant impact on the risk of neurotoxicity. CRS was not included in the stepwise multivariable model, because it is not a 
pretreatment variable. The percentage of all CD19 
+ cells in bone marrow was not included in the stepwise multivariable model, as it strongly correlates with 
the percentage of marrow CD19

CAR-T cell peak counts in blood compared with those with 
grade ≤2 neurotoxicity (Fig. 3A). Patients with grade ≥3 
neurotoxicity also had earlier and higher fever, more severe 
hemodynamic instability and tachypnea, and more severe 
hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and weight gain, con-
sistent with loss of vascular integrity and systemic capil-
lary leak (Fig. 3B). Severe neurotoxicity was accompanied by 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with elevated 
prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, 
and d-dimer beginning 2 to 5 days after CAR-T cell infu-
sion, prolonged thrombocytopenia, and a late reduction in 
fibrinogen to a nadir approximately 1 to 2 weeks after CAR-T 
cell infusion (Fig. 3C). The severity of neurotoxicity corre-
lated with higher peak concentrations of C-reactive protein 
(CRP), ferritin, and multiple cytokines, including those that

(Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. S2). In line with the association

 Neurotoxicity Associated with CD19 CAR-T Cells
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
December  2017 CANCER DISCOVERY | 1411 
between early-onset CRS and subsequent development of 
severe neurotoxicity (Fig. 1D), an earlier peak of the IL6 
serum concentration was associated with a higher risk of 
grade ≥4 neurotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. S3). Within the 
first 6 days after CAR-T cell infusion, 5 of 5 patients (100%) 
with an IL6 concentration ≥501 pg/mL developed grade 
≥4 neurotoxicity, whereas only 2 of 11 patients (18%) who 
reached the same serum IL6 concentration more than 6 days 
after CAR-T cell infusion developed grade ≥4 neurotoxicity. 
These findings indicate that neurotoxicity is associated with 
vascular dysfunction and early onset of high concentrations 
of serum cytokines.
Endothelial Activation in Patients  
with Severe Neurotoxicity
The clinical evidence of vascular leak and DIC in patients 
with severe neurotoxicity was consistent with widespread 
endothelial activation. The angiopoietin (ANG)–TIE2 axis 
regulates the balance between endothelial quiescence and 
activation (10). ANG1 is produced constitutively, primarily 
by vascular pericytes and platelets, and when bound to the 
endothelial TIE2 receptor, ANG1 favors EC quiescence and 
stabilization. ANG2 is stored in endothelial Weibel–Palade 
bodies and released upon EC activation by stimuli includ-
ing inflammatory cytokines, displacing ANG1 and causing 
increased activation and microvascular permeability. We eval-
uated the concentrations of ANG2 and ANG1 in serum from 
patients 1 week after CAR-T cell infusion and found that the 
serum ANG2 concentration (P = 0.0003) and the ANG2:ANG1 
ratio (P = 0.0014) were higher in patients with grade ≥4 neu-
rotoxicity compared with those with grade ≤3 neurotoxicity 
(Fig. 4A). To confirm the presence of in vivo endothelial activa-
tion in patients with severe neurotoxicity, we evaluated the 
concentration of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein 
involved in hemostasis that like ANG2 is stored in endothe-
lial Weibel–Palade bodies and released on EC activation (11). 
Compared with patients with grade 0–3 neurotoxicity after 
CAR-T cell infusion, those with grade ≥4 neurotoxicity had 
higher concentrations of VWF in serum (P = 0.004), which 
in some patients was 4- to 5-fold higher than those observed 
in pooled serum from healthy donors (Fig. 4B). IL8 is seques-
tered with VWF in Weibel–Palade bodies and was also elevated 
during severe neurotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 12). 
These findings indicated endothelial activation and Weibel–
Palade body release during severe neurotoxicity.
We considered that patients with evidence of endothelial 
activation before embarking on CAR-T cell immunotherapy 
might be at higher risk of subsequent cytokine-mediated 
vascular injury and neurotoxicity. We evaluated ANG2 and 
ANG1 concentrations in serum from patients prior to com-
mencing lymphodepletion chemotherapy and found that the 
ANG2:ANG1 ratio was higher in patients who subsequently 
developed grade ≥4 neurotoxicity compared with those with 
grade ≤3 neurotoxicity (Fig. 4C), suggesting that before lym-
phodepletion, biomarkers of endothelial activation might 
identify patients at high risk of subsequent neurotoxicity. 
Furthermore, in paired samples between day 0 and day 1 after 
CAR-T cell infusion, the magnitude of the change in ANG2 
concentration correlated with increasing severity of subse-
quent neurotoxicity (grade 0–2, median 80 ng/mL; grade 
3, median 394 ng/mL; grade ≥4, median 6,392 ng/mL; P = 
0.0039), indicating that endothelial activation occurs early 
after CAR-T cell infusion and precedes the onset of neurotox-
icity (Fig. 1D).
We hypothesized that cytokines or other factors in serum 
of patients treated with CAR-T cell infusion induced EC 
activation. We found that serum collected from patients 
with evidence of early neurotoxicity 3 to 5 days after CAR-T 
cell infusion induced the formation of a greater number 
of VWF-platelet strings on human umbilical vein ECs 
(HUVEC) compared with serum from normal donors (Fig. 
4D; Supplementary Fig. S4). Formation of these strings 
requires release of endothelial VWF stores and subsequent 
platelet attachment. When we examined VWF-platelet 
string formation in HUVECs incubated with serum col-
lected 7 to 14 days after CAR-T cell infusion, we found 
lower VWF-platelet string formation using serum from 
patients with grade ≥4 neurotoxicity compared with serum 
from patients with grade 0–3 neurotoxicity (Fig. 4E). Lower 
VWF-platelet string formation occurred despite the pres-
ence of higher serum concentrations of IL6, IFNγ, ANG2, 
and VWF in patients with grade ≥4 neurotoxicity. We con-
sidered that the low string unit formation during severe 
neurotoxicity might be due to relative deficiency of high 
molecular weight (HMW) VWF multimers, which bind 
activated endothelium more efficiently than low molecular 
weight (LMW) VWF multimers and can be consumed dur-
ing acute presentations of thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (TTP; refs. 13, 14). Indeed, we found that patients 
with grade ≥4 neurotoxicity had a lower fraction of HMW 
VWF multimers in serum and a higher fraction of LMW 
VWF multimers compared with those with grade ≤3 neuro-
toxicity (Fig. 4F). We also examined the levels and activity 
of ADAMTS13, a protease that cleaves HMW VWF from 
activated endothelium (11). When the ADAMTS13 activity 
was normalized to the VWF serum level (ADAMTS13:VWF 
ratio), we found that during grade ≥4 neurotoxicity, the 
ADAMTS13:VWF ratio was lower than observed with 
grade 0–3 neurotoxicity (grade ≥4 vs. 0–3; 26.4% vs. 35.2%; 
 
P = 0.007), suggesting that patients with grade ≥4 neuro-
toxicity inefficiently remove bound HMW VWF multimers 
from activated endothelium. Together, these data suggest 
that serum from patients with neurotoxicity induces acti-
vation of ECs, which release and bind VWF, and in severe 
cases causes sequestration of  
HMW VWF multimers and 
contributes to the consumptive coagulopathy.
The BBB Does Not Shield the CSF from  
High Serum Cytokine Concentrations during  
Acute Neurotoxicity
The presence of endothelial activation and systemic capil-
lary leak raised the possibility that severe neurotoxicity after 
CD19 CAR-T cells might be associated with disruption of the 
BBB. No evidence of infectious etiology was found in CSF 
from patients with neurotoxicity, and only 1 patient had con-
current detection of leukemia blasts in CSF. CSF during acute 
neurotoxicity had a high protein concentration and leukocyte 
count compared with CSF collected before lymphodepletion, 
consistent with increased permeability of the BBB (Fig. 5A). 
We did not detect a correlation between the CSF protein

concentration and leukocytosis and the severity of neurotoxic-
ity, in part because CSF sampling from patients with the most 
severe toxicity was frequently unable to be performed due to 
concurrent coagulopathy. Both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cells 
were detected in the CSF by flow cytometry (CD4+/EGFRt+, 
median 2.6 cells/μL; CD8+/EGFRt+, median 2.1 cells/μL). 
CAR-T cells comprised a higher fraction of the CD4+ T-cell 
subset in CSF compared with blood (Fig. 5B), indicating that 
distinct mechanisms might regulate the migration of CD4+ 
and CD8+ CAR-T cells across the BBB and their retention or 
proliferation in CSF or brain parenchyma. CD4+ and CD8+ 
CAR-T cells persisted in CSF at high frequency in a subset of 
patients after recovery from and/or stabilization of neuro-
toxicity, but were infrequent in CSF from patients who had 
not previously developed neurotoxicity (Fig. 5C). These CSF 
analyses show that protein and cells, including CAR-T cells, 
transit into the CSF in patients with neurotoxicity, consistent 
with increased permeability of the BBB.
Serum cytokines can access the CSF through saturable 
transporters, circumventricular organs, and during BBB 
breakdown (15). To determine whether increased BBB per-
meability during severe CRS would permit transit of plasma 
cytokines into the CSF, we evaluated cytokine concentra-
tions in paired blood and CSF samples obtained before 
lymphodepletion and during acute neurotoxicity. Prior to 
lymphodepletion, there was a cytokine concentration gra-
dient between serum and CSF, with IFNγ, TNFα, and the 
TNFα-stabilizing soluble receptors TNFR p55 and TNFR 
p75 being higher in blood (Fig. 5D). During acute neurotox-
icity, the concentrations of IFNγ, TNFα, IL6, and TNFR p55 
had increased markedly and were comparable between serum 
and CSF, suggesting either that the BBB did not prevent high 
plasma cytokine concentrations from transitioning into the 
CSF or that there was local cytokine production in the CSF 
(Fig. 5D).
We considered that high concentrations of cytokines 
crossing the BBB might activate brain vascular pericytes, 
which together with ECs play an important role in main-
tenance of the BBB (16, 17). We evaluated the effects of 
IFNγ and TNFα by exposing primary human brain vascu-
lar pericytes in vitro to concentrations of these cytokines 
that are observed in patients with severe neurotoxicity. 
Pericytes exposed to IFNγ secreted increased amounts of 
IL6 and VEGF, each of which activates endothelial cells and 
increases BBB permeability (Fig. 5E; ref. 10). Incubation of 
pericytes with TNFα induced an even more marked increase 
in IL6 secretion (Fig. 5E). IFNγ also induced downregula-
tion of PDGFRβ and upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 
expression, consistent with induction of pericyte stress (Fig. 
5F; ref. 17). Together, these findings show that increased 
permeability of the BBB allows transit into CSF of high con-
centrations of serum cytokines, including IFNγ and TNFα, 
which induce pericyte stress and secretion of cytokines that 
promote a further increase in BBB permeability.
Endothelial Activation and Vascular  
Disruption in Fatal Neurotoxicity
We examined autopsy tissue from the brains of 2 patients 
who developed fatal CRS and neurotoxicity after CD19 
CAR-T cell therapy to evaluate endothelial activation and vas-
cular injury in severe neurotoxicity. One patient died 13 days 
after CAR-T cell infusion with CRS and neurotoxicity char-
acterized by brainstem hemorrhage and edema. Neuropatho-
logic examination showed multifocal microhemorrhages 
and patchy parenchymal necrosis in the pons, medulla, and 
spinal cord. Red blood cell (RBC) extravasation was observed 
from multiple vessels in both morphologically affected and 
nonaffected areas of the brain parenchyma (Fig. 6A). Associ-
ated with small areas of infarction were more severe vascu-
lar lesions with karyorrhexis, fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis 
(Fig. 6B), and perivascular CD8+ T-cell infiltration (Fig. 6C), 
representing the vast majority of the brain T cells by IHC. 
Flow cytometry on fresh pons tissue obtained at autopsy 
showed T cells constituted 56.9% of CD45+ cells and that 
most of the T cells in the brain were CAR-T cells, with 93% 
of the T cells in the pons expressing the EGFRt transduction 
marker (CD4−/CD8+ CAR-T cells, 51.9%; CD4+/CD8− CAR-T 
cells, 48.1%). This was consistent with the data from CSF 
collected at autopsy, in which 82% of the CD45+ cells were 
CD3+ T cells and of these 94.9% were CAR-T cells (CD4−/
CD8+ CAR-T cells, 48%; CD4+/CD8− CAR-T cells, 42.5%). 
We observed intravascular VWF binding and CD61+ platelet 
microthrombi (Fig. 6D and E), consistent with endothelial 
activation, and CD31 IHC demonstrated disrupted endothe-
lium in some vessels (Fig. 6F). Reactive microglia were noted 
in a perivascular distribution, but marked and diffuse micro-
glial activation was not observed (Supplementary Fig. S5). 
No CD79a+ tumor cells were detected (Supplementary Fig. 
S5). The brain of a patient who died due to severe CRS with 
multiorgan failure and grade 4 neurotoxicity (on day 3 after 
CAR-T cell infusion) also showed intravascular CD61+ plate-
let microthrombi.
Identification of Patients at High Risk of 
Subsequent Neurotoxicity
Early identification of patients at risk of developing the 
most severe neurotoxicity might allow intervention with toci-
lizumab and/or corticosteroids, enabling reduction in serum 
cytokine concentrations that could mitigate or prevent sub-
sequent toxicity. Fever ≥38.9°C occurring within 36 hours of 
CAR-T cell infusion had a 100% sensitivity for subsequent 
grade ≥4 neurotoxicity; however, the specificity was only 
82%, in part due to other causes of fever in these patients 
with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Because IL6, IFNγ, 
MCP1, IL15, IL10, and IL2 were higher (P < 0.001) within the 
first 36 hours after CAR-T cell infusion in those who sub-
sequently developed grade ≥4 neurotoxicity, we investigated 
whether testing of serum cytokines could better identify 
patients at risk of severe neurotoxicity compared with evalu-
ation of the temperature alone within 36 hours of CAR-T 
cell infusion. Classification tree modeling demonstrated that 
patients with fever ≥38.9°C and serum IL6 ≥16 pg/mL and 
MCP1 ≥1,343.5 pg/mL in the first 36 hours after CAR-T cell 
infusion were at high risk of subsequent grade ≥4 neurotox-
icity (sensitivity 100%; specificity 94%; Supplementary Fig. 
S6). The model misclassified 8 of 133 patients, of whom only 
1 (0.75%) did not subsequently develop moderate or severe 
grade 2–3 neurotoxicity and/or grade ≥2 CRS, indicating that 
unnecessary early intervention guided by the classification 
tree model is rare.

DISCUSSION
Neurologic AEs occur frequently after lymphodepletion 
chemotherapy and CD19 CAR-T cell immunotherapy, and 
the incidence of grade ≥3 neurotoxicity in our study was simi-
lar to that described in previous reports (1–4). The presenta-
tion of neurotoxicity was heterogeneous, with most events 
being consistent with nonspecific brain dysfunction without 
focal signs. The diagnosis of CAR-T cell–associated neuro-
toxicity required the appearance of new neurologic signs 
or symptoms within the first 1 to 3 weeks after CAR-T cell 
infusion without attribution to other etiologies. Imaging by 
MRI or CT was normal in most cases and was mainly used 
to exclude other possible causes of neurologic AEs; however,

acute abnormalities on MRI were observed in patients with 
severe neurotoxicity. EEG showed diffuse slowing in most 
cases and was primarily used to exclude seizure activity. CSF 
analysis did not reveal findings specific for neurotoxicity but 
did demonstrate evidence of increased BBB permeability, with 
transit of protein, leukocytes, and elevated concentrations of 
serum cytokines into the CSF. Although most neurologic 
AEs were mild and transient, a subset of patients developed 
severe neurotoxicity with presentations that included focal 
neurologic signs, seizures, and/or cerebral edema. Six of the 
7 patients with grade ≥4 neurologic AEs were treated during 
the dose-escalation stage of the study with CAR-T cell doses 
that were subsequently established to be above the MTD for 
the patient’s disease and tumor burden. After establishment 
of the CAR-T cell MTDs, the incidence of grade ≥4 neurotox-
icity was only 1.3%.
Neurotoxicity was almost invariably associated with CRS 
and preceded by fever, allowing for hospital admission of 
febrile patients who received outpatient CAR-T cell immuno-
therapy. The association between CRS and neurotoxicity was 
supported by the high cytokine concentrations in serum and 
high CAR-T cell counts in blood in patients with severe neu-
rotoxicity. Baseline factors, including higher disease burden, 
infused CAR-T cell dose, and addition of fludarabine to cyclo-
phosphamide-based lymphodepletion that are associated with 
robust CAR-T cell proliferation in blood, were also associated 
with an increased risk of subsequent neurotoxicity. It is prob-
able that the increase in neurotoxicity in patients who received 
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion in our study 
is due to greater in vivo CAR-T cell expansion; however, a 
contribution from a direct toxic effect of fludarabine on the 
brain or endothelium cannot be excluded. Neurotoxicity has 
been reported after immunotherapy with T cells that are 
engineered with CD19 CARs that incorporate either 4-1BB or 
CD28 costimulation, but no studies have examined whether 
the selection of costimulatory molecule affects risk (1–6). 
Neurotoxicity also occurs after immunotherapy with blinatu-
momab, a bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 T-cell engager, support-
ing a role for T-cell activation in the pathogenesis (18). It is 
intriguing that neurotoxicity is observed more frequently after 
T cell–mediated immunotherapies targeting CD19 compared 
with other antigens. It seems likely that the higher risk of neu-
rotoxicity after CD19-targeted therapies reflects their capacity 
for robust T-cell activation compared with T-cell therapies tar-
geting other antigens expressed on different tumors. Factors 
that could contribute to the differences in T-cell activation 
after targeting CD19 compared with other antigens include 
accessibility of the tumor to T cells, the level of antigen expres-
sion, the presence of regulatory molecules, and the affinity of 
the antigen-targeting moiety (CAR vs. T-cell receptor). A direct 
effect of targeting CD19 cannot be excluded.
In addition to the high serum and CSF cytokine levels in 
patients during acute neurotoxicity, we observed that the 
severity of neurotoxicity was greater in patients who reached 
a peak IL6 concentration early after CAR-T cell infusion, sug-
gesting that the rate of rise in serum cytokine concentration, 
as well as the peak concentration, may be a determinant of 
the severity of neurotoxicity. Consistent with this, we noted 
that patients who subsequently developed severe neurotox-
icity had a shorter time to first fever and had higher serum 
cytokine concentrations early after CAR-T cell infusion com-
pared with those with mild neurotoxicity.
In patients with severe neurotoxicity, we noted clinical evi-
dence of endothelial dysfunction, including vascular instabil-
ity, capillary leak, DIC, and BBB disruption, associated with 
elevated serum biomarkers of endothelial activation (ANG2 
and VWF). The concentrations of VWF observed in a subset 
of patients with severe neurotoxicity were extremely high, 
which along with thrombocytopenia and consumption of 
HMW VWF multimers in these patients indicated profound 
endothelial activation. Similar findings have been identified 
in children with cerebral edema due to P. falciparum malaria 
and in patients with TTP (11). Although endothelial activa-
tion and loss of HMW VWF multimers can be seen during 
acute presentations of TTP, microangiopathic RBC morphol-
ogy and renal failure were not characteristic of neurotoxicity 
associated with CAR-T cell therapy, suggesting a distinct 
pathogenesis from TTP (11). Because of the small numbers 
of patients in the study who developed grade ≥4 neurotoxic-
ity, the relationships between the clinical factors and these 
biomarkers will need validation in subsequent cohorts.
Among the cytokines that were elevated in serum from 
patients with severe neurotoxicity were those that induce 
endothelial activation (IL6, IFNγ, and TNFα). IL6, IFNγ, 
and TNFα were increased in both blood and CSF during 
acute neurotoxicity, consistent with either the failure of the 
BBB to exclude transit of the high concentrations of serum 
cytokines or local production of these cytokines within the 
CSF. Because of the risks of obtaining CSF early after CAR-T 
cell infusion from patients without neurotoxicity, we cannot 
definitively exclude the presence of a BBB leak in asymp-
tomatic patients. However, the presence of CAR-T cells in 
CSF from patients after resolution of active neurotoxicity, 
but not from patients without prior neurotoxicity, suggests 
a BBB leak in asymptomatic patients is unlikely. We identi-
fied CAR-T cells in CSF and in a patient who died of severe 
neurotoxicity that appeared to be the major component of 
the T-cell population in the brain, suggesting that the egress 
of CAR-T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) might 
contribute to high CSF cytokine levels and neurotoxicity. 
Other cells in the CNS might contribute to high cytokine 
levels in CSF. We show that incubation of primary human 
brain pericytes with TNFα resulted in increased secretion of 
IL6, and that incubation with IFNγ increased secretion of IL6 
and VEGF and induced pericyte stress. These findings are 
consistent with the combination of high serum cytokines, 
endothelial activation, and BBB leak leading to a cascade 
that progressively amplifies endothelial activation and BBB 
injury (Supplementary Fig. S7). In support of this, autopsy 
studies identified evidence of endothelial activation manifest 
by platelet aggregation and VWF binding in small capillaries, 
which was accompanied by RBC extravasation, a perivas-
cular CD8+ T-cell infiltrate, vascular wall destruction, and 
multifocal hemorrhage. Microhemorrhages were observed 
on MRI scans in other patients with severe neurotoxicity. A 
recent study in a murine tumor model found that IFNγ and 
TNFα contributed to tumor vessel regression and occlusion, 
and vascular burst, respectively (19); however, the relative 
contributions of distinct cytokines to BBB injury were not 
determined in these studies.

 Neurotoxicity Associated with CD19 CAR-T Cells

We did not observe profound morphologic changes in 
microglial cells at autopsy. However, the finding of hyperfer-
ritinemia in patients with neurotoxicity raises the possibility 
that activation of macrophage-lineage cells may contribute 
to the pathogenesis of neurotoxicity, akin to the neurologic 
manifestations observed in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocy-
tosis (20). Although there are as yet no animal models of neu-
rotoxicity after CD19 CAR-T cell immunotherapy that reflect 
the human presentation, future improvements of these mod-
els may be of value in further exploring the pathogenesis of 
human CAR-T cell–associated neurotoxicity.
Treatment of established neurotoxicity has largely been 
directed toward management of CRS by suppression of T-cell 
activation with corticosteroids, and control of IL6-mediated 
inflammatory pathways using tocilizumab. Other mainstays 
of management include supportive care to maintain organ 
function and prevent seizures. Tocilizumab and dexametha-
sone were highly effective at controlling fever and hypoten-
sion during CRS, but it is unclear whether the near-uniform 
resolution of neurotoxicity is a result of these interventions or 
the natural history of CAR-T cell proliferation, contraction, 
and quiescence. Furthermore, the observation that neurotox-
icity still occurred in some patients despite prior administra-
tion of tocilizumab for CRS suggests that targeting IL6R in 
isolation during established CRS is insufficient to prevent 
subsequent neurotoxicity. Because tocilizumab may not pen-
etrate the CNS (21, 22), we and others have considered that its 
use might increase CSF IL6 levels and worsen neurotoxicity 
and have suggested that siltuximab, an IL6 antagonist, may 
be preferred. Strategies to target other cytokines and/or their 
receptors warrant further investigation. In the absence of data 
from randomized studies, the optimal approach to manage-
ment remains unknown. In addition to regulating CAR-T cell 
activation and reducing production of cytokines that might 
activate ECs, strategies to stabilize ECs and minimize BBB 
disruption might be suitable to treat or prevent neurotoxic-
ity. For example, recombinant Bow-ANG1 was used to effec-
tively prevent cerebral edema associated with malaria in mice 
(23), and modification of TIE2 signaling minimized injury 
associated with BBB disruption in stroke models (24). Other 
strategies, such as hypertransfusion of platelets to augment 
ANG1 levels, or plasma exchange to deplete cytokines and 
HMW VWF multimers, could be studied in animal models or 
suitably designed clinical trials.
An alternative approach to the management of neuro-
toxicity is to prospectively identify and either exclude or 
preemptively treat those at highest risk. Patients with preex-
isting neurologic comorbidities were more likely to develop 
neurotoxicity, although the significance is unclear because 
the study was not powered to determine the risk associated 
with individual neurologic comorbidities. Given the potential 
benefits of CAR-T cell immunotherapy and the almost uni-
versally poor outcomes without this approach, exclusion of 
patients with previous comorbidities does not seem justified; 
however, reduction of the CAR-T cell dose may be appropri-
ate in a subset of high-risk patients, for example those with 
biomarkers that might indicate preexisting endothelial acti-
vation, such as a high ANG2:ANG1 ratio in serum before 
lymphodepletion or CAR-T cell infusion. Our finding that 
the serum concentrations of IL6 and MCP1 within 24 hours 
of CAR-T cell infusion identified patients who subsequently 
developed severe neurotoxicity provides an opportunity to 
monitor concentrations of these cytokines to identify those 
at highest risk. Additional studies will be required to deter-
mine whether preemptive therapy with dexamethasone, IL6 
or IL6R blockade, or endothelial stabilizing agents will pre-
vent severe neurotoxicity in high-risk patients.
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy is a promising therapy for 
patients with refractory B-cell malignancies that can be com-
plicated by neurotoxicity in a subset of patients. Identifica-
tion of the pathologic characteristics of neurotoxicity, related 
biomarkers, and risk factors will facilitate further studies of 
the mechanisms of neurotoxicity and will enhance efforts to 
safely deliver CAR-T cell immunotherapy.
METHODS
Patient Characteristics, Lymphodepletion Chemotherapy, 
and CAR-T Cell Infusion
We conducted a single-center study of neurologic AEs in 133 
patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD19+ B-ALL, NHL, or CLL 
who received lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CD19 CAR-T cells 
in a phase I/II CAR-T cell dose escalation/deescalation clinical trial 
(5, 6). The study is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT01865617 and was conducted with approval of the Fred Hutch-
inson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. Informed 
consent was obtained from all patients. Patients received lymphode-
pletion chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S1) 36 to 96 hours 
before CAR-T cell infusion. CD19 CAR-T cells were manufactured in 
a 1:1 ratio of CD4+:CD8+ CAR-T cells as described previously (Sup-
plementary Data) and infused at 1 of 3 dose levels (2 × 105/kg, 2 × 
106/kg, or 2 × 107/kg) 2 to 4 days after completion of chemotherapy 
(5, 6). A nonsignaling truncated human EGFR (EGFRt) encoded in 
the transgene allowed precise enumeration of transduced CD4+ and 
CD8+ CAR-T cells by flow cytometry. This article reports neurologic 
AEs presenting within 28 days after the first CAR-T cell infusion.
Assessment of Neurologic Adverse Events
Neurologic symptoms and signs were prospectively assigned an 
AE term and maximal severity score according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.03). 
The prospective assignment was made by the principal investigator 
and coinvestigator who managed the patient. An independent ret-
rospective review of the electronic medical record was performed by 
a member of the neurology team, who assigned AE terms and daily 
severity scores for each term according to the CTCAE version 4.03. 
Where a discrepancy between prospective severity scoring by the 
principal investigator and coinvestigator and retrospective scoring 
by the neurology team was identified, the final score was allocated 
by consensus review. Neurologic assessment was performed daily on 
inpatients by the managing oncology team and as clinically indicated 
by the neurology team. Because of the heterogeneous presentation 
of neurotoxicity, we retrospectively grouped AEs into term subsets 
(Supplementary Table S2). “Delirium” encompassed acute cognitive 
impairment manifesting as confusion, agitation, or difficulty with 
attention or short-term memory and was distinguished by preserved 
alertness from “decreased level of consciousness.” Additional AE 
subsets included “ataxia,” “focal weakness,” “generalized weakness,” 
“hallucinations,” “headache,” “ICH,” “language disturbance,” “ocu-
lomotor disorder,” “seizure,” “stroke,” “tremor,” “other abnormal 
movements,” and “visual changes.” Neurologic AEs not captured in 
the preceding list were designated “other.” The overall neurotoxicity 
grade assigned for a given patient was the highest grade of all neuro-
logic AEs identified in that patient.

Neuroimaging
CT and MRI scans of the head were performed when clinically 
appropriate using standard clinical sequences. All available imaging 
was reviewed for this study and retrospectively classified as normal, 
acutely abnormal, or chronically abnormal. Abnormalities on MRI 
scans performed during clinical neurotoxicity within 28 days after 
CAR-T cell infusion were designated acute when findings were con-
sistent with an acute event (edema, blood, enhancement, or diffusion 
restriction) and were either new compared with prior imaging or 
evolved on follow-up. Abnormalities were designated chronic when 
there were nonspecific white-matter changes that are typical sequelae 
of chemotherapy or age-related microvascular disease, when abnor-
malities were due to an unrelated prior process, and when findings 
were stable in baseline or follow-up scans.
CSF and Blood Samples
CSF was collected from patients when appropriate for clinical 
care: before lymphodepletion (Pre), during the presence of acute 
neurotoxicity (Acute), or when patients had recovered from the 
acute toxicities associated with CAR-T cell immunotherapy (Recov-
ery, approximately 3 weeks or more after CAR-T cell infusion). CD4+ 
and CD8+ CAR-T cell counts in blood and CSF were evaluated by 
flow cytometry, as described previously (5, 6). The absolute CAR-T 
cell count was determined by multiplying the percentage of CAR-T 
cells identified by flow cytometry in a lymphocyte FS-SS gate by the 
absolute lymphocyte count established by automated hemocytom-
eter. Patients with progressive CNS malignancy detected by flow 
cytometry analysis of CSF were not included in the CSF analyses. 
Concentrations of all cytokines except ANG1 and ANG2 in serum 
and CSF were evaluated by Luminex assay, as described previously 
(5, 6). Serum ANG1 and ANG2 concentrations were evaluated using 
an immunoassay-based method on the Meso Scale Discovery Quick-
plex SQ 120 instrument (Meso Scale Diagnostics) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
VWF and ADAMTS13 Assays
The VWF concentration in patient sera was measured by sand-
wich ELISA as described previously (13), using polyclonal rabbit 
anti-human VWF as a capture antibody and horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP)–conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF as a detection 
antibody (Dako). ADAMTS13 activity in patient sera was measured 
using an enzyme-linked assay to evaluate cleavage of an HRP-conju-
gated peptide from the VWF A2 domain as described previously (25).
Serum-Induced Activation of ECs
HUVECs (Lonza) were cultured for 7 days in parallel-plate flow 
chambers coated with rat tail type I collagen. Serum, from either 
patients or healthy donors, was incubated with HUVECs at 37°C 
for 30 minutes under static conditions. The chambers were perfused 
with PBS to remove serum and then perfused with a suspension of 
fixed platelets (Dade Behring, Siemens Medical Solutions) to deco-
rate VWF strings attached to the surface of the HUVECs. The num-
ber and length of the VWF-platelet strings were quantified as string 
units on 16 random nonoverlapping brightfield images per chamber, 
as described previously (13). The values for string units obtained 
from HUVECs incubated with serum were normalized to those from 
HUVECs stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, which was des-
ignated as 100%.
Cytokine Stimulation of Primary Human Brain Pericytes
Primary human brain vascular pericytes were cultured in Specialty 
Medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories) alone or supplemented 
with IFNγ 30 ng/mL (Peprotech) after 24 and 72 hours. After 
96 hours, IL6 and VEGF concentrations were analyzed in the culture 
supernatant by Luminex, and PDGFRβ (BioLegend) and cleaved 
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) expression on pericytes were 
determined by flow cytometry.
Histology and IHC
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissue blocks were 
sectioned at 4 μm and mounted on positively charged slides. A 
hematopathologist, an anatomic transplant pathologist, and a neu-
ropathologist examined hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides of 
available autopsy tissues. Histologic features were identified and 
graded by consensus. IHC was performed on brainstem sections 
of pons at the level of the locus coeruleus using a standard auto-
mated immunodetection system with the following antibodies: anti-
CD3 (Ventana), anti-CD8 (Ventana), CD31 (Dako), CD61 (Ventana), 
CD68 (Dako), CD79a (Ventana), and VWF (Dako). Appropriate 
positive and negative controls were included with each antibody run.
