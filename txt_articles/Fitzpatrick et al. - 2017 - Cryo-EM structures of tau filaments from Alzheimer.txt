Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there are no 
mechanism-based therapies. AD is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and 
neuritic plaques in cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary lesions are made of paired helical and straight 
Tau filaments (PHFs and SFs), whereas Tau filaments with different morphologies characterize 
other neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of Tau filaments are available. 
Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4–3.5 Å resolution and 
corresponding atomic models of PHFs and SFs from AD brain. Filament cores are made of two 
identical protofilaments comprising residues 306–378 of Tau, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-
helix structure and define the seed for Tau aggregation. PHFs and SFs differ in their inter-
protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs. These findings 
demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-
derived material, and pave the way to study a range of neurodegenerative diseases.
Neurofibrillary lesions strongly correlate with cognitive deficits, making them an important 
therapeutic target for AD1. Dominantly inherited mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal 
dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17T), showing that 
dysfunction of Tau is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia2.

 Ultrastructurally, Tau inclusions are made of PHFs and SFs3–5. By negative-stain electron 
microscopy, the core of PHFs and SFs consists of a double helical stack of C-shaped 
subunits6, whereas the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of Tau are disordered and 
project away from the core to form the fuzzy coat7. In AD, Tau filaments form from full-
length Tau in cells, but have lost most of their fuzzy coat in extracellular ghost tangles.
Neurofibrillary lesions appear to propagate in the course of AD through connected 
pathways, from subcortical areas to transentorhinal cortex, limbic system and neocortex8. 
Although the molecular Tau species responsible for neurodegeneration are unknown, short 
filaments constitute the major species of seed-competent Tau in the brains of mice transgenic 
for human P301S Tau9.
Six Tau isoforms ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids are expressed in adult human brain, 
produced by alternative mRNA splicing of transcripts from MAPT, the Tau gene10. They 
differ by the presence or absence of inserts of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal 
half, and the inclusion or not of the 31 amino acid microtubule-binding repeat, encoded by 
exon 10 of MAPT, in the carboxy-terminal half. Inclusion of exon 10 results in the 
production of three Tau isoforms with four repeats each (4R), and its exclusion in a further 
three isoforms with three repeats each (3R). The four repeats (R1-R4) comprise residues 
244–368, in the numbering of the 441 amino acid Tau isoform.
Neurodegenerative diseases with abundant filamentous Tau inclusions are referred to as 
tauopathies11. Besides AD, they include tangle-only dementia (TD), chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy (CTE), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), globular glial tauopathy (GGT) and Pick’s disease 
(PiD)11. Unlike AD, these other diseases lack Aβ plaques. In AD, TD and CTE, all six Tau 
isoforms (3R and 4R) are present in the disease filaments. In AGD, PSP, CBD and GGT, 
only 4R Tau isoforms are found, whereas in PiD only 3R Tau inclusions are present. The 
existence of human tauopathies with distinct filament morphologies12 has led to the 
suggestion that different molecular conformers of aggregated Tau may exist. Multiple 
molecular conformers may also explain why AD brain-derived filaments are more effective 
than in vitro assembled filaments of recombinant protein in inducing Tau pathology in 
mouse brain13.
Progress in understanding tauopathies is hampered by the lack of atomic structures of Tau 
filaments from brain. Studies of amyloids are complicated by potential differences in 
structure between filaments in the brain and those assembled in vitro. Low-resolution cryo-
EM structures are available of in vitro assembled filaments of Aβ14, and solid-state NMR 
has been used to study the structures of recombinant Aβ15–17 and α-synuclein18. Even when 
seeding in vitro filament growth with extracts from diseased brain16,18, structures may not 
be amplified according to their relative abundance in the brain. Here, we present atomic 
models, as determined by cryo-EM, for the core of PHFs and SFs that were purified from 
AD brain.

 Neuropathological characteristics
We used cerebral cortex (Figure 1a) of a 74 year-old female (patient B.J.C.) with a 
neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis of AD. The interval between clinical diagnosis and 
death was 10 years. The patient’s Apolipoprotein-E genotype was ε3/ε4. Exons 16 and 17 of 
the Amyloid precursor protein gene, exons 3–13 of the Presenilin-1 gene, as well as exons 4, 
5, 7 and 12 of the Presenilin-2 gene (including adjacent intronic sequences) were sequenced 
and no disease-causing mutations were found. The patient’s mother had died aged 86 with a 
16 year history of AD. Thioflavin S staining showed the presence of abundant 
neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in cerebral cortex (Figure 1b). The sarkosyl-
insoluble fraction of the patient’s neocortex contained numerous PHFs and SFs, which were 
composed of full-length, hyperphosphorylated Tau, as assessed by immuno-gold EM 
(Extended Data Figure 1). Negatively stained PHFs had a longitudinal spacing between 
crossovers of 650–800 Å and a width of about 300 Å at the widest part and 100–150 Å at the 
narrowest. SFs were about 150 Å wide with crossover distances ranging from 700–900 Å 
(Figure 1c). By Western blotting, pathological Tau bands of 60, 64, 68 and 72 kDa were 
present (Extended Data Figure 1a). These characteristics are like those described previously 
for PHFs and SFs from AD brains19. Sarkosyl-insoluble material seeded aggregation of full-
length human Tau in cultured cells20.
PHFs and SFs are ultrastructural polymorphs
The sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of the patient’s cerebral cortex was purified by differential 
centrifugation and gel filtration (Methods) with no disruption to the structures of PHFs and 
SFs (Extended Data Figure 2a–c). The purified sarkosyl-insoluble fraction also seeded the 
aggregation of full-length human Tau in cultured cells (Extended Data Figure 2d). The two 
types of filaments could be readily distinguished in cryo-EM images, and corresponding 3D 
reconstructions were calculated separately to overall resolutions of 3.4 and 3.5 Å (Extended 
Data Figure 3) using helical reconstruction in RELION21. The maps showed clear side-chain 
densities (Figure 2) and β-strands were well separated in the direction along the helical axis 
(Figure 1e), allowing us to propose stereo-chemically refined atomic models for the cores of 
PHFs and SFs (Methods).
Consistent with previous findings6, both PHFs and SFs are composed of two protofilaments 
with C-shaped subunits. Successive rungs of β-strands along a protofilament are related by 
helical symmetry: with a rise of 4.7 Å and a twist of approximately −1° in both PHFs and 
SFs. In PHFs, but not SFs, the two protofilaments are related by an approximate 21 screw 
symmetry. A clear pattern of side chain densities and various landmark features in the two 
maps revealed that the core of both protofilaments in PHFs and in SFs is composed of 
residues V306-F378, i.e. all of R3 and R4, as well as 10 amino acids carboxy-terminal to the 
repeats (Extended Data Figure 4). The protofilament cores of PHFs and SFs are similar 
(Extended Data Figure 5), showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs, reminiscent of 
fibrils formed by a peptide of transthyretin22.
Additional, weaker densities appear at both the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the 
core (orange density in Figure 2). The weaker densities suggest that these regions

 correspond to a mixture of peptides and/or a more dynamic or transiently occupied structure 
than the filament core. The weaker density at the amino-terminal region can accommodate 
approximately 16 residues in a β-sheet-like conformation that may represent a mixture of the 
C-termini of R1 and R2, which would result from the 3R and 4R alternative splicing 
products. This is consistent with our Western blotting results, which indicated that all six 
brain Tau isoforms were present in PHFs and SFs (Extended Data Figure 1a). Another 
region of additional density is interacting with the sidechains of K317, T319 and K321 in both 
types of filaments (red arrows in Figure 2). This density is strongest in SFs where it forms 
part of the protofilament interface, whereas in PHFs it occurs at the surface of both 
protofilaments.
Generality of PHF and SF structures
We used pronase treatment, mass spectrometry and antibody labeling to corroborate our 
model of a structured R3:R4 core with extending densities at the amino- and carboxy-
termini. Pronase treatment has previously been shown to remove the fuzzy coat of PHFs and 
SFs, while leaving the structured core intact7. We confirmed that cryo-EM structures of the 
core of both PHFs and SFs do not change upon pronase-treatment (Extended Data Figure 6). 
Mass spectrometry of the pronase-treated filaments showed that residues I260-R406 of 3R 
and residues K281-R406 of 4R Tau are present in the structured core of the filaments, with 
R3:R4 (V306-R406) being by far the most abundant species (Extended Data Figure 7a). This 
finding is also in good agreement with peptides identified in earlier work23,24, and a recent 
report on mass spectrometry of trypsin-treated PHFs and SFs from 10 AD cases25.
In addition, to confirm that R2 is not part of the pronase-resistant core, we used Anti-4R, an 
antibody raised against V275-C291 of R2 (with D279)26. In agreement with a pronase-
resistant R3:R4 core, Anti-4R detected both PHFs and SFs before, but not after, pronase 
treatment. By contrast, antibody MN423, which recognizes tau truncated at E39124, detected 
PHFs and SFs only after pronase treatment (Extended Data Figure 7b), as reported 
previously19. The model of an ordered R3:R4 core is also consistent with the observation 
that antibodies BR135 and TauC4, which recognize sequences inside R310 and R425, 
respectively, do not label either PHFs or SFs, whereas they do label PHF Tau on denaturing 
gels (Extended Data Figure 1a). Sequence analysis of the PHF core also showed the 
presence of R3:R4 of Tau24.
Thus, we propose that PHFs and SFs have a common core structure composed primarily of 
R3:R4, with a mixture of R1 and R2 directly preceding V306.
Structure of the common protofilament
The core of PHFs and SFs is composed of eight β-sheets (β1-8) that run along the length of 
the protofilament, adopting a C-shaped architecture. Each C is comprised of a β-helix 
region, where three β-sheets are arranged in a triangular fashion, and two regions with a 
cross-β architecture, where pairs of β-sheets pack anti-parallel to each other (Figure 3a–b). 
Forming such a continuous β-strand architecture along the chain of an individual Tau 
molecule (80% of residues are in a β-strand conformation occupying only 13.3% of the total

 ϕ/ψ space) is achieved by interspersing the β-strand regions with β-breaking prolines (P312, 
P332, P364), β-turn glycines (G323, G355) or β-arc residues (E342, D348). The strain of having 
many twisted β-strand regions is further relieved by changes in the height of the chain along 
the helical axis, resulting in differences of up to 10 Å between the highest point in β1 and 
the lowest point in the tip of the β-helix (Figure 3c). Thereby, an ordered, in-register, parallel 
hydrogen-bonding pattern is maintained throughout the protofilament structure. Additional 
hydrogen bonds that stabilize the protofilament are implied by the side chains of ladders of 
asparagines and glutamines.
Starting from the termini (Figure 3d), there is a heterotypic cross-β interface formed 
between β1-2 and β8. The amino-terminal end of the ordered core is formed by the 
hexapeptide 306VQIVYK311, which forms a complementary packing interface with residues 
374–378 from the opposing β8 by face-to-face packing of hydrophobic groups. Strands β2 
and β8 pack against each other through a polar-zipper motif. Next, there is a right-angle turn 
accomplished through G323 and G326 on one side and a compact 364PGGG367 motif on the 
other side. It is possible that cysteine C322 forms intra-sheet disulphide bonds, but we were 
unable to detect a regular pattern that would allow us to visualise density for such bonds in 
our helical reconstruction. A hydrophobic cluster of L324, I326 and V363 stabilizes the region 
immediately following the turn and the cross-β interface between β3 and β7 is further 
cemented by hydrogen bonds between the sidechains of H328 and T361. Following β3, 
residues 332PGGG335 adopt an extended β-spiral conformation. Finally, the two sides meet 
through a β-helix structure that is defined by three β-strands in R4 (β4-6). Two-residue 
(E342, K343) and three-residue (347KDR349) β-arc corners punctuate the triangular β-helix 
geometry, which is closed with a pivotal ~70° glycine conformation (G355). Hydrophobic 
clustering, aliphatic stacking (V339, L344, V350, and I354) and aromatic stacking (F346) 
stabilize the interior of the β-helix. Alternating charged residues between E338 and R349 on 
the solvent exposed surface of the β-helix provide intramolecular charge compensation that 
offsets the repulsive effects of stacking sidechains with identical charge.
PHFs and SFs form different interfaces
The ultrastructural polymorphism between PHFs and SFs is due to differences in lateral 
contacts between the two protofilaments. In PHFs, the two protofilaments form identical 
structures that are related by helical symmetry, and the interface is formed by the anti-
parallel stacking of residues 332PGGGQ336 (Figure 4a). The offset of half the β-strand 
distance along the helical axis results in a staggered packing of 333GGG335 from both 
protofilaments in PHFs. In particular, the glycine tripeptide adopts a characteristic 
polyglycine II, β-spiral structure27 that forms a hydrogen-bonding pattern both within and 
between the two protofilaments. The PHF interface is further stabilized by the formation of 
two hydrogen bonds between Q336 and the backbone carboxyl of K331 on the opposite 
protofilament.
In SFs, the two protofilaments pack asymmetrically (Figure 2b). The weaker β-sheet-like 
density at the amino-terminal end of the structured core is only visible in one of the 
protofilaments, as steric hindrance at the protofilament interface prevents the formation of a 
peripheral β-strand on the second protofilament. Although the β-helices of the two

 protofilaments appear to be in a similar chemical environment, the β-helix of the second 
protofilament is more disordered. The backbones of the two protofilaments are nearest each 
other between residues 321KCGS324 of the first and 313VELSK317 of the second 
protofilament, where the protofilaments are packed against each other at approximately the 
same position along the helical axis (Figure 4b). However, these residues do not form inter-
protofilament salt-bridges or hydrogen bonds, nor does the interaction seem to be mediated 
by hydrophobic packing. Instead, the SF protofilament interface appears to be stabilized 
through the region of additional density that is interacting with the side chains of K317, T319 
and K321 of both protofilaments (red arrow, Figure 2b). These residues are part of the 
epitope of the Alz-50 and MC-1 antibodies28 that is formed by two discontinuous portions 
of Tau: 7EFE9 and 313VDLSKVTSKC322. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments 
on heparin-induced filaments of recombinant 4R Tau confirm the interaction between the 
amino-terminus and residues 313–322 of the structured core29, which is strongly affected by 
ionic strength, and takes place mainly through intra-molecular interactions29,30. Therefore, 
although we cannot preclude the role of other poly-anionic molecules, we speculate that the 
additional density corresponds to 7EFE9, and that salt bridges between the negatively 
charged glutamates of the amino-terminus and the positively charged lysines of the core 
stabilize the interaction between the two protofilaments. Similar additional density is also 
interacting with K317 and K321 in PHFs, where it does not contribute to the protofilament 
interface (red arrows, Figure 2a). Mutations directly preceding the 7EFE9 motif, i.e. R5L31 
and R5H32, have been observed in FTDP-17T.
Discussion
AD PHFs and SFs consist of an ordered core of pairs of protofilaments comprising residues 
306–378, and disordered amino- and carboxy-termini forming the fuzzy coat (Figure 5). The 
core forms a sufficient platform for the incorporation of both 3R and 4R Tau into the 
growing filament. As we were unable to detect any order in the fuzzy coat, this 
heteromolecular addition may occur in a random manner. This would explain why PHFs and 
SFs are able to seed in vitro aggregation of recombinant samples containing only 3R Tau, 
only 4R Tau, or a mixture of 3R and 4R Tau13. It may also explain why the intracerebral 
injection of PHFs and SFs from AD brain leads to neuronal uptake, seeding and propagation 
in wild-type mice13,33, since the Tau306-378 sequence is identical in humans and mice. The 
ordered core is probably necessary and sufficient for the seeded assembly of Tau in AD 
brain.
The protofilament core is composed of a combination of two structural motifs that are 
closely associated with amyloid and prion structures – cross-β packing34 and β-helices35. 
This structure is markedly different from the conformation of Tau bound to microtubules, 
where residues 269–284 and 300–312 adopt a hairpin conformation and the rest of the 
structure appears disordered by NMR36. The generic cross-β structure is widely accessible 
to peptides of varying lengths with unrelated amino acid sequences37. In AD Tau, in-register, 
anti-parallel β-sheet packing is mediated through a mixture of hydrophobic and polar 
interactions. The amino-terminal part of the cross-β structure is formed by the 
hexapeptide 306VQIVYK311, which is essential for the assembly of Tau filaments38,39. In 
contrast to homotypic interactions seen in microcrystals of isolated peptides40, the

 hexapeptide in AD Tau packs through a heterotypic, non-staggered interface with the 
opposing residues 373–378. The same packing interface is absent in the widely used K18 
and K19 constructs41, which span three or four repeat domains of recombinantly expressed 
Tau, and terminate at E372. Therefore, filaments made of K18 and K19 proteins cannot 
represent the complete core structure of AD brain-derived PHFs and SFs, and care should be 
taken when extrapolating experimental results derived from the use of constructs ending 
before F378 to Tau aggregation in vivo42.
In contrast to generic cross-β structures, β-helices are mediated by specific interactions that 
are not accessible to most amino acid sequences43. β-Helices can only arise from sequences 
with a specific pattern of hydrophobic residues on the inside, polar residues on the outside, 
and a pivotal β-arch forming glycine at the end of the motif. An example of such β-helices is 
the prion-forming domain of HET-s from the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina44. The 
HET-s prions form a β-solenoid core, which is essential for infectivity, composed of two 
charge-complementary left-handed β-helical windings and a linker region. Despite having 
little sequence similarity, the β-helices in AD Tau and HET-s218-289 (PDB-entry 2RNM44) 
adopt a similar fold (Extended Data Figure 8), raising the possibility that this motif may 
serve as a scaffold for prion-like, templated misfolding45. The β-helix in Tau is closed by 
G355, which is located in the 353KIGS356 motif of R4 that comprises the potential 
phosphorylation site S356.
Knowledge of the atomic coordinates of Tau filaments may be useful for the rational design 
of specific inhibitors of Tau aggregation, as well as tracer compounds. Luminescent 
conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) bind to HET-s218-289 through exposed lysine ladders on 
the surface of the β-solenoid46. Therefore, LCOs such as pentameric formyl thiophene acetic 
acid (pFTAA), a fluorescent dye that identifies neurofibrillary lesions in AD brain 
sections47, may bind to aggregated Tau in a similar way. The specific structure of the β-helix 
(or possibly the protofilament interface), as opposed to the more generic cross-β structure 
near the termini of the core, may also provide a binding site for positron emission 
tomography ligands that show specific binding to AD Tau filaments, but not to Tau filaments 
from non-AD diseases, Aβ, or α-synuclein48.
Different molecular conformers of Tau have been suggested to be related to specific 
neurodegenerative diseases. The structures presented here show how different protofilament 
packing interactions lead to ultrastructural polymorphism in Tau filaments. Protein 
sequencing and mass-spectrometric analyses of Tau filaments from various diseases have 
indicated that in PiD, CBD and PSP, R1 and R2 are more resistant to trypsin digestion than 
in AD25. This raises the possibility of another type of polymorphism, where Tau 
protofilaments may form from alternative combinations of the repeats (R1:R2 and R2:R3 
from 4R Tau, and R1:R3 from 3R Tau) (Extended Data Figure 9). Whether these 
hypothetical conformations exist in other tauopathies remains to be seen.
Conclusion
The cryo-EM structures of AD PHFs and SFs establish a basis for understanding the 
differences between molecular conformers of Tau aggregates, and explain how different

 isoforms are incorporated into the filaments. Our results demonstrate that amyloid structures 
from human brain may be obtained by cryo-EM. This opens up new possibilities for 
studying the molecular mechanisms underlying a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.
Methods
Extraction of Tau filaments from AD brain
Sarkosyl-insoluble material was extracted from grey matter of frontal and temporal cortex as 
described19. The resuspended pellet (10 μl/g tissue) was further purified by 30-fold dilution 
in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 800 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA with a final 
concentration of 10% (w/v) sucrose, followed by centrifugation at 20,100 × g for 30 min at 
4°C. The pellet, containing large contaminants such as collagen, was discarded. The 
supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 containing 100 mM NaCl at 10 μl/g tissue, and run over a Superose 6 
Increase 3.1/300 column (GE Healthcare). PHFs and SFs eluted in the void volume, whereas 
ferritin, the main contaminant, and residual sucrose were retained. The filaments were 
concentrated using a Vivacon 500 centrifuge device (Viva Products) at 3,000 × g and stored 
at 4°C. Pronase treatment was carried out as described19.
Immunolabeling, histology and molecular genetics
Western blotting and immunogold EM were carried out as described19. For Western blotting, 
samples were resolved on 4–20% or 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex), and the primary 
antibodies were diluted in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA. BR133, BR134 and 
BR13510 at 1:4000; AT8 (Thermo; catalogue nr. MN1020) at 1:1000; MC-128 at 1:10; HT7 
(Thermo; catalogue nr. MN1000) at 1:2500, Anti 4R-tau (Cosmo Bio; catalogue nr. CAC-
TIP-4RT-P01) and TauC425 at 1:2000; and MN42324 at 1:500. For immunogold EM, 
primary antibodies were diluted as follows: BR133, BR134, BR135, AT8, Anti 4R, TauC4 
and MN423 at 1:50; and MC-1 at 1:10. Neurohistology, immunohistochemistry, and 
molecular genetics were carried out as described49. For immunohistochemistry, the 
following antibody dilutions were used: RD3 (Millipore; catalogue nr. 05-803) at 1:3000; 
Anti-4R at 1:100; and AT8 and AT100 (Thermo; catalogue nr. MN1060) at 1:300. The brain 
sections were 8 μm thick, and were counterstained with haematoxylin.
Seeded aggregation
Seeded aggregation in cells was carried out as described50. HEK 293T cells (ECACC) 
expressing full-length wild-type 0N4R tau were incubated for 3 h with the Tau filament 
preparation used for cryo-EM diluted 1:1000 in OptiMEM, followed by a change to 
complete medium (DMEM plus Glutamax and 10% foetal calf serum) and growth for 72 h. 
Cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 800 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA 
with a final concentration of 10% (w/v) sucrose by freeze-thaw, followed by sarkosyl 
extraction and Western blotting. Band densities were calculated using ImageJ (NIH).
Mass spectrometry
Purified Tau filaments were disaggregated using 4 M guanidinium hydrochloride and 
digested with trypsin. The proteolytic peptides were injected for analysis by liquid

 chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and identified by matching 
molecular mass to a peptide-fragment database. Pronase-treated Tau filaments were 
processed in a similar way, but with an additional ultracentrifugation step to separate 
pronase-cleaved “fuzzy” coat regions from the core of the filament. In this case, the pellet 
containing the pronase-resistant core of the PHFs and SFs was disaggregated, trypsin 
digested and analysed by LC-MS/MS. Relative abundances of peptide fragments were 
quantified by measuring the areas under the readout curves from ion-mass chromatography.
Cryo-Electron Microscopy
For cryo-EM, aliquots of 3 μl of purified Tau filaments at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were 
applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh), blotted 
with filter paper to remove excess sample, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI 
Vitrobot Mark IV. Cryo-EM images were acquired on a Gatan K2-Summit detector in super-
resolution counting mode on an FEI Titan Krios at 300 kV. A GIF-Quantum energy filter 
(Gatan) was used with a slit width of 20 eV to remove inelastically scattered electrons. For 
full-length filaments (FL), fifty movie frames were recorded each with an exposure time of 
200 ms using a dose rate of 1.2 electrons per Å2 per frame for a total accumulated dose of 60 
electrons per Å2 at a pixel size of 1.04 Å on the specimen. For pronase-treated filaments 
(PT), twenty movie frames were recorded, each with an exposure time of 800 ms using a 
dose rate of 2.75 electrons per Å2 per frame, resulting in a total accumulated dose of 55 
electrons per Å2 at a pixel size of 1.15 Å on the specimen. The final data sets are composed 
of 1560 (FL) and 523 (PT) micrographs with defocus values in both data sets ranging from 
−1.0 to −3.0 μm.
Helical Reconstruction
Similar procedures were applied to the FL and PT data sets. All super-resolution frames 
were corrected for gain reference, binned by a factor of 2, motion-corrected and dose-
weighted using MOTIONCOR251. Aligned, non-dose-weighted micrographs were then used 
to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) using Gctf52. All subsequent image-
processing steps were performed using helical reconstruction methods in RELION 2.021.
Filaments were picked manually, and segments were extracted using a box size of 280 Å and 
an inter-box distance of ~10% (30 Å) of the box length. Reference-free 2D classification to 
identify homogeneous subsets was initially performed using a regularisation value of T=2. 
Selected class averages were repositioned onto the original micrographs according to the 
classification of individual segments to aid manual separation of the filaments into PHFs and 
SFs, which were then processed as separate data sets. An additional round of reference-free 
2D classification was performed on the PHF and SF data sets yielding distinct classes for 
different views of the filaments.
Initial models for 3D classification were created from previously derived PHF and SF cross-
sections6. Similar results could also be obtained from alternative initial models that were 
reconstructed from 2D class averages of segments that were extracted in a box that was large 
enough to almost comprise an entire pitch length. We first used 3D classification of the PHF 
and SF datasets with a regularisation parameter of T=4. These calculations yielded sub-

 nanometer (in the x-y plane only) reconstructions, in which individual β-sheets were clearly 
separated within the C-shaped subunits of both PHFs and SFs, but no structure was 
discernable along the (helical) z-axis. These results reflect the difficulty in reconstructing 
amyloid filaments, which have notoriously few layer lines visible in their power spectra 
between very low resolutions (~50Å) and the distance between β-strands (4.7Å).
We experimented with higher values of T in order to force the use of higher spatial 
frequencies in the regularised likelihood optimisation. 2D classifications with T-values as 
high as 20 yielded 2D class averages with clearly discernable β-strand separation, but 
possibly due to overfitting most of the segments were assigned to a single class representing 
a mixture of different views. More conservative regularisations with T=8 yielded a more 
representative number of different 2D class averages that still showed clear β-strand 
separation.
We then selected those segments from the PHF and SF data sets that were assigned to 2D 
class averages with β-strand separation for subsequent 3D classification runs. For these 
calculations, we used a single class (K=1); a T-value of 20; and we used the previously 
obtained sub-nanometer PHF and SF reconstructions, low-pass filtered to 15 Å, as initial 
models. Imposing a helical rise of 4.7 Å and a helical twist of −1° (as estimated from the 
cross-over distances of filaments in the micrographs) led to 3D reconstructions of both PHFs 
and SFs in which β-strands were clearly resolved. At this point, we tested a range of 
different helical parameters. Optimizations of the helical twist all converged onto values of 
approximately −1° per 4.7 Å rise. Helical rises of multiples of 4.7 Å all led to β-strand 
separation, but in agreement with the observed absence of layer lines between 50 and 4.7 Å 
(Extended Data Figure 3d) we were unable to detect any repeating patterns among 
successive rungs of β-strands. Therefore, we decided to impose a helical rise of 4.7 Å, which 
results in a reconstruction in which all rungs of β-strands are identical. Finally, as we 
realised that PHFs consist of two identical protofilaments related by an approximate 21 
screw, we imposed additional helical symmetry on the PHFs by using a rise of 4.7/2Å and a 
twist of (360°-1°)/2. This additional symmetry was absent in SFs, where the two 
protofilaments pack in an asymmetrical manner.
3D classifications with local optimisation of the helical twist and rise were used for all four 
data sets to further select segments for high-resolution refinement. Although these 
classifications resulted in relatively small subsets of the initial data sets (Extended Data 
Table 1), reconstructions from much larger subsets gave similar reconstructions, albeit to 
lower resolutions, that were still in full agreement with our atomic interpretation (see 
below). This indicates that image classification did not select for a specific structure from a 
conformationally heterogeneous data set, but instead was successful in distinguishing the 
better segments from data sets with images of varying quality, which is in line with 
observations in single-particle analysis. Image classification also did not separate variable 
twists of PHFs and SFs. Instead, RELION combines segments from filaments with variable 
twists into a single 3D reconstruction and reduces the corresponding blurring effects by only 
using the central part of an intermediate asymmetrical reconstruction for real-space helical 
symmetrisation21. For both PHFs and SFs, we used a 10% value for the corresponding 
helical_z_percentage parameter.

 High-resolution refinements were performed using RELION’s 3D auto-refinement, during 
which both the helical twist and rise were optimised21. As initial models, we used 7 Å low-
pass filtered maps of the PHF and SF from the 3D classification runs with K=1. In some 
refinements, the two half-maps converged onto different translations along the helical axis. 
In such cases, it was necessary to halt the run, align the two half-maps outside RELION, 
before resuming the refinement. Final, overall resolution estimates were calculated from 
Fourier shell correlations at 0.143 between the two independently refined half-maps, using 
phase-randomisation to correct for convolution effects of a generous, soft-edged solvent 
mask53. Local resolution estimates were obtained using the same phase-randomisation 
procedure, but with a soft spherical mask that was moved over the entire map. Final PHF 
and SF reconstructions were sharpened using standard post-processing procedures in 
RELION, resulting in B-factors of approximately −100 Å2 on all maps (Extended Data 
Table 1), and helical symmetry was imposed on the post-processed maps using the 
relion_helix_toolbox program21. The PHF reconstructions from the FL and PT data 
sets were very similar, with overall resolution estimates of 3.4 and 3.5 Å (cf. Figure 2 and 
Extended Data Figure 6). The SF map from the FL data set had an overall resolution of 3.4 
Å, but due to a lower abundance of SFs after pronase treatment, the corresponding map only 
reached 5.1 Å and β-strands were thus not separated.
Model Building and Refinement
The PHF and SF maps from the PT and FL data sets have complementary regions for model 
building. The β-helix motif at the tips of the C-shaped protofilaments is better ordered in the 
PHFs than in SFs, whereas the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends of the protofilament cores 
are best ordered in the SF map from the FL data set. Moreover, density for the cross-β 
structures near the termini of the PHFs is better defined in the PT reconstruction than in the 
FL reconstruction. Combined, the different maps allow for unambiguous main-chain tracing 
of the atomic models (Figure 2; Extended Data Figures 4 and 6). Initial model building 
started by fitting the L-type β-helix from the magic-angle spinning NMR-derived structure 
of filaments of the prion-forming domain HET-s218-289 (PDB-entry 2RNM) in the tip of the 
protofilaments of the PT PHF reconstruction. The sequence of only one of the four 
microtubule-binding repeats of Tau had a sequence that was compatible with the observed 
density in both PHFs and SFs (Extended Data Figure 4). Using the β-helix region as a 
starting point, we then built the remainder of the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions by 
manually adding amino acids and targeted real-space refinement in COOT54.
Fourier-space refinement of the complete atomic model against the PHF and SF maps was 
performed in REFMAC55. A stack of three consecutive monomers from each of the 
protofilaments was refined in order to preserve nearest-neighbour interactions for the middle 
chain. Local symmetry restraints were imposed in REFMAC to keep all β-strand rungs 
identical. Since most of the structure adopts a β-strand conformation, hydrogen-bond 
restraints were imposed to preserve a parallel, in-register hydrogen-bonding pattern in earlier 
stages of the model building process. In addition, ϕ/ψ angle restraints were imposed for the 
polyglycine II region, 333GGG335, and the three-residue β-arc, 347KDR349. The dihedral 
angles for polyglycine II were taken from Crick’s proposed fold27 (ϕ = −80, ψ =150) and 
those for the three-residue β-arc from the crystal structure of PDB-entry 1QRE56. Side-chain

 clashes were detected using MOLPROBITY57 and corrected by iterative cycles of real-space 
refinement in COOT and Fourier-space refinement in REFMAC. Refinements of atomic 
models were performed for the FL and PT PHFs and for the FL SF. The refined model from 
the FL SF was rigid-body fitted into the PT SF map. For each refined structure, separate 
model refinements were performed against a single half-map, and the resulting model was 
compared to the other half-map to confirm the absence of overfitting. The final models were 
stable in refinements without additional restraints. Statistics for the final models are shown 
in Extended Data Table 1.

 Figure 1. Structure of Tau filaments from Alzheimer’s brain
a. Coronal section at the level of the precentral gyrus of the brain used in this study shows an 
enlarged lateral ventricle (grey background). Grey matter from frontal cortex (red) and 
temporal cortex (magenta) was used for cryo-EM. b. Thioflavin S staining light microscopy 
showing abundant neurofibrillary tangles (yellow arrows) and a neuritic plaque (white 
arrow) in temporal cortex. c. Negatively stained electron micrograph of purified Tau 
filaments, in which PHFs (blue arrows) and SFs (green arrows) are readily distinguished. d–
e. Cryo-EM reconstructions of PHFs (blue) and SFs (green).

 Figure 2. Cross-sections of the PHF and SF cryo-EM structures
Cryo-EM density and atomic models of PHFs (a) and SFs (b). Overviews of the helical 
reconstructions (left) show the orientation of the cross-sectional densities (right). Sharpened, 
high-resolution maps are shown in blue (PHFs) and green (SFs). Red arrows point at 
additional densities in contact with K317 and K321. Unsharpened, 4.5 Å low-pass filtered 
density is shown in grey. Unsharpened density highlighted with an orange background is 
reminiscent of a less-ordered β-sheet and could accommodate an additional 16 amino acids, 
which would correspond to a mixture of residues 259–274 (R1) from 3R Tau and residues 
290–305 (R2) from 4R Tau.

 Figure 3. The common protofilament core
a. Sequence alignment of the four microtubule-binding repeats (R1–R4) with the observed 
eight β-strand regions coloured from blue to red. The sixteen residues from R1 or R2 that 
may form an additional, less-ordered β-sheet are indicated with grey dashed lines. b. 
Rendered view of the secondary structure elements in three successive rungs. c. As in b, but 
in a view perpendicular to the helical axis, revealing the differences in height along the 
helical axis within a single molecule. d. Schematic view of the protofilament core.

 Figure 4. Protofilament interface in PHFs and SFs
a. Packing between residues 332PGGGQ336 of the two protofilaments in PHFs. Inter-
protofilament hydrogen bonds are shown in orange and green. Intra-protofilament hydrogen 
bonds are shown in yellow. b. Packing between residues 317–324 and residues 312–321 of 
the protofilaments in SFs. Additional density between the side chains of lysines 317 and 321 
is shown as a green mesh.

 Figure 5. Schematic representation of full-length Tau filaments
a. Primary structure of the longest Tau isoform in human brain. The two inserts near the 
amino-terminus are labeled N1 and N2. The microtubule-binding repeats are labeled R1-4. 
The 7EFE9 motif near the amino-terminus is marked with a blue circle. b. The six different 
isoforms pack randomly along the helical axis. c. In PHFs, the amino-terminal region of Tau 
monomers in both protofilaments folds back to form an additional, less ordered β-sheet 
against β1–β2 of the ordered core, then becomes disordered, and folds back to form an 
interaction between 7EFE9 and lysines 317 and 321 of the core. d. In SFs, only a single 
additional β-sheet can form, and the amino-terminus of one of the protofilaments forms part 
of the protofilament interface.
