Abstract 
Objective: To measure chronological changes in penile length (PL) before and after 
radical prostatectomy (RP), and to investigate the underlying mechanisms for the same. 
Patients and Methods: Stretched PL (SPL) of 102 patients was measured before, 10 
days after, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after RP. The perpendicular distance 
from the distal end of the membranous urethra to the midline of the pelvic outlet was 
measured on mid-sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice at three time-points: 
preoperatively, 10 days after RP and 12 months after RP. Pre- and postoperative SPLs 
were compared using paired Student’s t-test. Predictors of PL shortening at 10 days and 
at 12 months after RP were evaluated on univariate and multivariate analyses. 
Results: The SPL was shortest at 10 days after RP (mean PL shortening from 
preoperative level: 19.9 mm); it gradually recovered thereafter. SPL at 12 months after 
RP was not significantly different from preoperative SPL. On MRI examination, the 
distal end of membranous urethra was found to have moved proximally (mean proximal 
displacement: 3.9 mm) at 10 days after RP, and to have returned to the preoperative 
position at 12 months after RP. Only the volume of the removed prostate was a predictor 
of SPL change at 10 days after operation on univariate analysis; on multivariate analysis, 
 2 
 
2 
 
the association was not statistically significant. No predictor of SPL change was shown 
at 12 months after RP. 
Conclusion: The SPL was shortest at 10 days after RP and gradually recovered 
thereafter in this study. Anatomically, glans and corpus spongiosum surrounding urethra 
is an integral structure, and the proximal urethra is drawn into pelvis during 
urethrovesical anastomosis. This is the first report showing that slight vertical 
repositioning of the membranous urethra after RP causes chronological changes in SPL. 
The information is useful for patients to know penile appearance changes after RP.

Introduction 
Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a standard treatment for localized prostate cancer. The 
main complaints after RP are urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction [1, 2]. In 
addition, many patients complain of penile shortening (PS) [3]. This self-assessed PS 
was showed to be associated with low-to-moderate self-esteem [3]. Several studies have 
shown PS after RP; however, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not 
well-elucidated [4-9].  
The relationship between changes in penile length (PL) and sexual function have been 
reported [10], and nerve sparing (NS) procedures reportedly help minimize PS after RP 
[3]. On the other hand, another report mentioned no relationship between NS and PS 
after RP [5]. Furthermore, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) has been 
found to be effective for preventing PS after RP [11-13]; however, another report 
claimed no effect of penile rehabilitation on PS [10]. 
In the current study, chronological changes in PL before and after RP were measured 
and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after RP were compared to 
evaluate any anatomical changes. In addition, potential predictive factors for PS were 
also evaluated.

Patients and Methods 
Patient Population 
Patients with clinically localized prostatic cancer scheduled to undergo RP at Kanazawa 
University Hospital (Japan), between October 2011 and May 2014, were included in the 
current study. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. During the 
study reference period, all RPs were performed by robot-assisted surgery. All patients 
provided written informed consent. All data were collected prospectively. Patients who 
received pre- or postoperative androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and/or radiation 
therapy, or those who had a history of penile disease or had undergone penile surgery, 
were excluded. Prostate-specific antigen levels were measured prior to prostate biopsy; 
Gleason score was determined at biopsy. Removed prostate weight was measured just 
after surgery. PDE5-Is were administered 1 month after operation to patients who 
wanted to use these (on-demand use). 
 
Stretched PL (SPL) measurement 
Stretched PL was measured from the pubopenile skin junction to the distal end of the 
glans with maximum extension by Y.K., who was blinded to previous measurements. 
 5 
 
5 
 
All measurements were taken with a ruler and rounded to the nearest 0.5 cm [4]. The 
SPL was measured in the room temperature maintained at > 22 °C with the patient lying 
in the supine position with the penis placed at a 90° angle to the body before surgery, 
about 3 days after catheter removal and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after RP.  
 
Erectile function assessment 
The erectile function was assessed using the erectile function domain of International 
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EFD) [14] and the erection hardness score (EHS) [15] 
preoperatively, about 3 days after catheter removal, and at approximately 12 months 
after RP.  
 
MRI, distal end of membranous urethra to pelvic outlet (DMU-PO) distance, and 
thickness of the subcutaneous fat 
MRI was performed with a 1.5-T MRI system (Sigma HDx; GE Medical Systems, 
Milwaukee, WI, USA) using a SENSE Flex-M coil (Philips Medical Systems, 
Amsterdam, Netherland) preoperatively, about 3 days after catheter removal, and at 
approximately 12 months after RP. To measure the perpendicular distance from the 
distal end of membranous urethra to the midline of the pelvic outlet clearly, the 
 6 
 
6 
 
landmarks were defined as follows. The midline of the pelvic outlet was defined as the 
line between the bottom edge of the pubic bone and lowest end of the coccyx. DMU-PO 
distance was defined as the perpendicular distance from the most proximal attachment 
point of the urethra and bulb of penis, to the midline of the pelvic outlet (Fig. 1); 
DMU-PO distance was measured using the MRI slice in which the urethra was most 
observable by magnified sagittal, first-spin, echo T2-weighted imaging (repetition time, 
3200 ms; echo time, 113 ms; slice thickness, 3 mm) and rounded 1 mm. The sagittal 
MRI slice, in which the difference between the urethra and the lowest end of the coccyx 
was most observable, was used to mark the lowest end of the coccyx. Leaving these 
markings in place, the view was shifted to the sagittal MRI slice in which the urethra 
was most visible, and the midline of the pelvic outlet was drawn from the mark 
denoting the lowest end of the coccyx to the bottom edge of the pubic bone. MRI was 
performed 30–60 min after urination, and estimated bladder capacity in each case was 
30 - 100 mL based on MRI results. The thickness of the subcutaneous fat of each 
patients was also measured at lower abdomen using midsagittal plane of MRI, and the 
thickness of each time point was defined as the average of different 5 points at 2 cm 
intervals of subcutaneous fat thickness at lower abdomen (Fig. 1).

Statistical analysis 
Categorical variables used to calculate the incidence and percentage of each factor and 
continuous variables were summarized by mean ± standard deviation. Pre- and 
postoperative SPL were compared using a paired Student’s t-test. Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient was used for univariate analysis and multiple linear regression was used for 
multivariate analysis. The variables assessed for potential predictive ability were: age, 
body mass index, preoperative EHS, NS status, and weight for the removed prostate 
gland at 10 days after operation and age, body mass index, preoperative EHS, NS status, 
and PDE5-Is use at 12 months after operation because all users were administered 
PDE5-Is 1 month after operation. All data analyses were performed using SPSS for 
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 
 
Results 
Patient Population 
A total of 153 patients who underwent RP during the study reference period at the 
Kanazawa University Hospital, 32 patients who had received neoadjuvant ADT, 10 who 
underwent adjuvant ADT or radiation therapy, and nine who did not complete the 2-year 
 8 
 
8 
 
follow-up, were excluded. Therefore, the SPL was measured for 102 patients 2 years 
post-RP. No patients had grade III and over complications of RP according to Clavian 
Classification. The demographics of the study population are shown in Table 1. 
Catheters were removed after a median period of 7 days after RP; therefore, 
measurements of first post-operative SPL and MRI were performed at median 10 days 
after RP.  
 
Penile length 
Chronological changes in SPL are shown in Figure 2. The SPL was shortest at 10 days 
after RP; mean shortening from pre-operative measurement was 19.9 mm, which 
gradually recovered in length thereafter. SPL at 12 months after RP was not statistically 
different from the preoperative SPL (Fig. 2).  
 
DMU-PO distance, the thickness of subcutaneous fat and erectile function 
Preoperative MRI and postoperative MRI at 10 days and 12 months after RP are shown 
in Figure 3. The DMU-PO distance at 10 days after RP was shorter than the 
preoperative measurement (mean shortening [N = 88]: 3.9 mm). However, the 
shortening was found to have reversed at 12 months after RP (Fig. 3) (Fig. 4). There 
 9 
 
9 
 
was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative thicknesses of 
subcutaneous fat (Fig. 4). IIEF-EFD and EHS deteriorated at 10 days after RP, and 
recovered at 12 months after RP although only slightly (Fig. 4).  
 
Predicting SPL shortening  
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in Table 2. Only the removed 
prostate volume was a predictor of SPL shortening at 10 days after RP on univariate 
analysis; the tendency to predict SPL shortening at 10 days was observed on 
multivariate analysis; however, the association was not statistically significant (Table 2). 
PDE5-Is were used twice a week regularly in 7 patients since 1 month after operation; 
in other 19 patients, usage tended to vary from only once after operation to once a week 
on demand. No predictor of SPL shortening was shown at 12 months after RP (Table 2). 
 
Discussion 
The current study is the first to focus on pelvic anatomical changes after RP, which 
cause chronological changes in PL. Measurement of SPL provides the closest 
approximation of the erect PL [16]; therefore, several studies have employed SPL as a 
measure of PL [4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18]. To maintain measurement quality, only Y.K. 
 10 
 
10 
 
measured SPLs and was blinded to previous results. Further, only patients who 
completed the entire 2-year study were included in this analysis. 
In the current study, SPL was shortest 10 days after RP and then gradually recovered to 
pre-RP levels after 12 months. Similar to the present study, SPL measurements taken 1 
week after RP in past studies were reportedly the shortest [7, 19]. However, the reported 
chronological changes in SPL have tended to differ; some reports state the SPL kept 
shortening for up to 1 year after RP [7, 11], while others have shown post-RP recovery 
of SPL to preoperative levels 3–5 years later [8]. Another report mentioned that 
postoperative SPL recovered to the preoperative level after 6–12 months after surgery, 
which is consistent with our results [10]. Long-term follow-up studies have been 
affected by a substantial drop-out rates [8, 10]; however, our study was able to 
chronologically obtain SPL measurements from over 100 cases over the 2-year study 
period.  
Animals studies in rats have suggested cavernosal nerve injury, hypoxia-induced 
structural alterations in the penis and/or sympathetic hyperinnervation as the cause of 
PS after RP [20]. However, these hypotheses were based on histological changes, which 
do not explain how the PL immediately after RP was the shortest. Comparison of pre- 
and postoperative MRI in the present study revealed proximal retraction of the 
 11 
 
11 
 
membranous urethra and bulb of penis immediately after RP, which was found to have 
returned to its former position 1 year later (Fig. 3). Anatomically, the corpus 
spongiosum which surrounds the urethra continues as the bulb of penis on the proximal 
side and the glans of penis on the peripheral side, thereby integrating these structures 
(Fig. 1) [21]. Because the bladder is thought to be loosely fixed by vascular pedicles and 
connective tissues, it can be moved down towards the bottom of the pelvis after removal 
of the prostate, albeit with some resistance. Moreover, the proximal side of urethra can 
retract towards the bladder after urethrovesical anastomosis (Fig.5B).  
Indeed, we observed intrapelvic retraction of the urethral stump during urethrovesical 
anastomosis in operation. Since the urethra pierces the urogenital diaphragm but is 
thought to be loosely connected, it is liable to be pulled down slightly into the pelvic. A 
past report posited the membranous urethra as being fixed to the urogenital diaphragm 
and not easily retractable into the pelvis [20]. Although the urogenital diaphragm is 
fixed to the pelvic bone, it is a membranomuscular structure and not very firm. 
Therefore, the urogenital diaphragm itself, as well as the membranous urethra, can 
move somewhat vertically (Fig. 5). We usually apply perineal pressure during 
urethrovesical anastomosis to push the urethral stump intrapelvically for easy 
observation during robot-assisted RP [22]. According to our MRI findings, the bulb of 
 12 
 
12 
 
penis is thought to have retracted towards bladder 10 days after RP; this indicates that 
the membranous urethra and urogenital diaphragm were lifted proximally. Comparison 
of MRI findings at 10 days and 12 months post-RP revealed the bulb of penis returned 
to almost the same pre-RP position; therefore, the tension of the vascular pedicles and 
connective tissues, which pull the bladder proximally, are speculated to loosen over the 
course of a year (Fig. 5C). MRI revealed that the bulb of penis was lifted proximally by 
an average of 3.9 mm at 10 days after RP (Fig. 3) (Fig. 4).  
On Pearson’s correlation analysis, the correlation between SPL change at 10 days after 
RP and the removed prostate weight was statistically significant. However, on 
multivariate linear regression analysis, the correlation was not statistically significant. 
Excision of a large prostate is liable to leave a space at the bottom of the pelvis; 
therefore, bladder neck is likely to experience traction that displaces it downwards 
towards the bottom of the pelvis. This may exert a greater proximal pull to the point of 
urethrovesical anastomosis after removal of large prostate gland as compared to that in 
case of small prostate removal. A significant correlation was observed between 
IIEF-EFD and EHS (r = 0.612, P < 0.001). However, EHS was used as the predictor in 
multivariate analysis for predicting SPL shortening in this study as it is considered to be 
more suitable than IIEF-EFD to be used for a cohort, such as that of Japanese men, with 
 13 
 
13 
 
low sexual activity [23]. There were no statistically significant changes between mean 
preoperative SPL before RP and that at 12 months after RP, and no predictive factor for 
SPL shortening at 12 months were found on multivariate analysis.  
The present study has some limitations. The sample size was not large enough to allow 
definitive conclusions. With respect to penile measurement, only SPL was evaluated, 
and the circumferences and the rigidity of the penis was not evaluated in our study. Our 
results tended to differ from those of previous studies in some respects. PDE5-Is 
showed no association with SPL shortening in our study; however, most user of 
PDE5-Is used it on demand. Past reports have mostly addressed the correlation between 
PL changes after RP and sexual function [5, 24]. Preoperative sexual functions of our 
study population were very low; therefore, it is difficult to mention the correlation 
between PL changes after RP and sexual function in our study. Administration of 
PDE5-Is has been shown to effectively prevent PS [12, 13]; therefore, PDE5-Is might 
have a positive impact on the blood supply to the penis and influence PL long-term. 
Therefore, the effect of PDE5-Is to SPL shortening requires further investigation. The 
early use of the vacuum erection device (VED) after RP also reported to help to 
preserve penile length [25]; however, the VED was not used and evaluated in our study. 
A NS technique has been reported to be protective for PS [3], and a preserved 
 14 
 
14 
 
postoperative PL has been shown to correlate well with maintenance of erectile function 
after NS RP [10, 24]. Thus, it is possible that patients with less PS might preserve more 
erectile function; however, the present study did not show any affect of NS status on PS 
after operation. ADT or ADT and radiation therapy reportedly shorten PL [17, 18]; 
therefore, testosterone would affect PL long-term. Further research is necessary to 
elucidate the long-term relationship between PL and erectile function.  
In conclusion, this is the first report showing that slight vertical repositioning of the 
membranous urethra after RP causes chronological changes in SPL. Anatomically, glans 
and corpus spongiosum surrounding urethra is an integral structure, and proximal 
urethral is drawn into pelvis during urethrovesical anastomosis. Changes in PL represent 
one phenomena of chronological anatomical changes induced by RP and could be 
elucidated in short-term after RP due to the results of our study. However, further 
research is needed to elucidate long-term changes of PL with respect to the influence of 
sex hormones or changes in penile blood flow after RP. The information is useful for 
patients to know penile appearance changes after RP.

Fig. 3 Mid-sagittal magnetic resonance imaging 
The line connecting the lowest end of the pubic bone and tip of the coccyx represents 
the pelvic outlet; red lines with bidirectional arrowheads show the perpendicular 
distance from the distal end of membranous urethra to the midline of the pelvic outlet (= 
DMU-PO distance) (A) before, (B) 10 days after, and (C) 12 months after radical 
prostatectomy.
