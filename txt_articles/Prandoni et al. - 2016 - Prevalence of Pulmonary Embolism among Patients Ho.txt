BACKGROUND
The prevalence of pulmonary embolism among patients hospitalized for syncope 
is not well documented, and current guidelines pay little attention to a diagnostic 
workup for pulmonary embolism in these patients.
METHODS
We performed a systematic workup for pulmonary embolism in patients admitted 
to 11 hospitals in Italy for a first episode of syncope, regardless of whether there 
were alternative explanations for the syncope. The diagnosis of pulmonary embo-
lism was ruled out in patients who had a low pretest clinical probability, which 
was defined according to the Wells score, in combination with a negative d-dimer 
assay. In all other patients, computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or 
ventilation–perfusion lung scanning was performed.
RESULTS
A total of 560 patients (mean age, 76 years) were included in the study. A diagno-
sis of pulmonary embolism was ruled out in 330 of the 560 patients (58.9%) on 
the basis of the combination of a low pretest clinical probability of pulmonary 
embolism and negative d-dimer assay. Among the remaining 230 patients, pulmo-
nary embolism was identified in 97 (42.2%). In the entire cohort, the prevalence of 
pulmonary embolism was 17.3% (95% confidence interval, 14.2 to 20.5). Evidence 
of an embolus in a main pulmonary or lobar artery or evidence of perfusion defects 
larger than 25% of the total area of both lungs was found in 61 patients. Pulmo-
nary embolism was identified in 45 of the 355 patients (12.7%) who had an alterna-
tive explanation for syncope and in 52 of the 205 patients (25.4%) who did not.
CONCLUSIONS
Pulmonary embolism was identified in nearly one of every six patients hospitalized 
for a first episode of syncope. (Funded by the University of Padua; PESIT Clinical-
Trials.gov number, NCT01797289.)

Pulmonary Embolism in Patients Hospitalized for Syncope
S
yncope is defined as a transient 
loss of consciousness that has a rapid on-
set, short duration, and spontaneous reso-
lution and is believed to be caused by temporary 
cerebral hypoperfusion.1-3 According to current 
classifications, syncope can be neurally mediated 
(i.e., vasovagal, situational, or carotid-sinus syn-
cope), can be caused by orthostatic hypotension 
(i.e., drug-induced hypotension or hypotension 
due to primary or secondary autonomic failure 
or due to volume depletion), or can have a cardio-
vascular origin (i.e., arrhythmias, structural car-
diovascular diseases, or pulmonary embolism).1
Although pulmonary embolism is included in 
the differential diagnosis of syncope in most text-
books, rigorously designed studies to determine 
the prevalence of pulmonary embolism among 
patients hospitalized for syncope are lacking. In-
deed, current international guidelines, including 
those from the European Society of Cardiology 
and the American Heart Association, pay little 
attention to establishing a diagnostic workup for 
pulmonary embolism in these patients.1,2 Hence, 
when a patient is admitted to a hospital for an 
episode of syncope, pulmonary embolism — a 
potentially fatal disease that can be effectively 
treated — is rarely considered as a possible cause.
In this study, we used a systematic diagnostic 
workup to assess the prevalence of pulmonary 
embolism in a large number of patients who 
were hospitalized for a first episode of syncope, 
regardless of whether there were potential alter-
native explanations for the syncope.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
This was a cross-sectional study that was aimed 
at determining the prevalence of pulmonary em-
bolism among patients older than 18 years of 
age who were hospitalized for a first episode of 
syncope. The study was designed by the first and 
last authors. The first author vouches for the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the data and analyses 
and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. 
The protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board at each participating hospital.
Syncope was defined as a transient loss of 
consciousness with rapid onset, short duration 
(i.e., <1 minute), and spontaneous resolution, 
with obvious causes such as epileptic seizure, 
stroke, and head trauma ruled out.1-3 All patients 
with syncope who visited the emergency depart-
ment and were admitted to the medical ward of 
1 of 11 participating general hospitals (2 aca-
demic and 9 nonacademic hospitals, each serving 
more than 100,000 inhabitants) were potentially 
eligible for enrollment in the study. Reasons for 
hospital admission were trauma related to falls, 
severe coexisting conditions, failure to identify 
an explanation for the syncope, or a high prob-
ability of cardiac syncope on the basis of the 
Evaluation of Guidelines in Syncope Study score.4 
Patients were excluded if they had had previous 
episodes of syncope, if they were receiving anti-
coagulation therapy, or if they were pregnant. All 
the patients provided written informed consent.
Study Assessments
All study assessments were completed within 48 
hours after a patient was admitted to a hospital, 
as specified in the study protocol. All the patients 
were interviewed and evaluated by trained study 
physicians, who were investigators in the Pulmo-
nary Embolism in Syncope Italian Trial (PESIT). 
The workup to be performed for each patient 
was prespecified in the study protocol and was 
based on the 2014 guidelines of the European 
Society of Cardiology.5 A medical history was 
obtained that included the presence of prodro-
mal symptoms of autonomic activation (sweating, 
pallor, or nausea), the presence of known car-
diac disease, recent bleeding, causes of volume 
depletion or venous pooling, and recent exposure 
to new or stronger hypotensive drugs or drugs 
that could potentially cause bradycardia or tachy-
cardia. In addition, study physicians asked pa-
tients about symptoms (pain and swelling) in 
their legs and recorded the presence of risk fac-
tors for venous thromboembolism, including re-
cent surgery, trauma, or infectious disease with-
in the previous 3 months; ongoing hormonal 
treatment; prolonged immobilization of 1 week 
or longer; active cancer (i.e., recurrent or metas-
tasized cancer or cancer that had been treated 
with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the previ-
ous 6 months); and history of venous thrombo-
embolism.
Patients were evaluated for the presence of 
arrhythmias, tachycardia (i.e., heart rate >100 
beats per minute), valvular heart disease, hypoten-
sion (i.e., systolic blood pressure <110 mm Hg), 
autonomic dysfunction (as assessed by measur-
ing blood pressure and pulse rate in the arms

and legs with the patient in a supine and an 
upright position), tachypnea (i.e., respiratory rate 
>20 breaths per minute), and swelling or redness 
of the legs. All patients underwent chest radiog-
raphy, electrocardiography, arterial blood gas 
testing, and routine blood testing that included 
a d-dimer assay. Further diagnostic workup in-
cluded carotid sinus massage, tilt testing, echo-
cardiography, and 24-hour electrocardiography 
recording, if applicable. Soon after hospital ad-
mission, patients received prophylaxis for venous 
thromboembolism, if indicated clinically.6
Ascertainment of Pulmonary Embolism
The presence or absence of pulmonary embolism 
was assessed with the use of a validated algo-
rithm that was based on pretest clinical proba-
bility and the result of the d-dimer assay.7 The 
d-dimer level was measured by the quantitative 
assay used routinely in each participating center; 
the cutoff for a positive result versus a negative 
result ranged between 250 and 500 μg per milli-
liter, depending on the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The pretest clinical probability of pulmo-
nary embolism was defined according to the 
simplified Wells score, which classifies pulmo-
nary embolism as being “likely” or “unlikely” 
(Table 1).8 In the patients who had a low (“un-
likely”) pretest clinical probability and a negative 
d-dimer assay, no further testing was performed 
and a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was 
ruled out. In patients who had a high (“likely”) 
pretest clinical probability, a positive d-dimer 
assay, or both, computed tomographic pulmo-
nary angiography or ventilation–perfusion lung 
scanning (in the case of patients with severe 
renal impairment or allergy to contrast material) 
was performed.
The criterion for the presence of pulmonary 
embolism was an intraluminal filling defect on 
computed tomography or a perfusion defect of at 
least 75% of a segment with corresponding nor-
mal ventilation.9,10 In the event that a patient died 
before the completion of this diagnostic algo-
rithm, an autopsy was requested. In patients with 
pulmonary embolism, the thrombotic burden 
was assessed by a central adjudication commit-
tee through identification of the most proximal 
location of the embolus on the computed tomo-
graphic scan or measurement of the severity of 
the perfusion defect on the ventilation–perfusion 
lung scan.11
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of pilot data (6 of 50 patients who 
were admitted to a hospital for syncope had 
pulmonary embolism), we assumed a prevalence 
of pulmonary embolism of 10 to 15% among 
patients with a first episode of syncope. To ob-
tain a two-sided 95% confidence interval of 2.5% 
for the prevalence of pulmonary embolism, we 
estimated that a sample size of 550 patients 
would be required. All participating centers were 
asked to enroll patients until the estimated 
sample size was reached.
The prevalence of pulmonary embolism and 
the associated 95% confidence interval were 
calculated for the entire group of patients and 
for relevant subgroups. To compare the baseline 
characteristics between patients with and those 
without pulmonary embolism, we used the chi-
square test for categorical variables and Student’s 
t-test for continuous variables. Odds ratios with 
95% confidence intervals were calculated with 
the use of logistic regression. The 95% confi-
dence intervals and P values were calculated ac-
cording to the normal approximation of the bi-
nomial distribution. No adjustments were made 
for multiple testing. All calculations were per-
formed with the use of SPSS software, version 
22.0 (SPSS).

Pulmonary Embolism in Patients Hospitalized for Syncope
ments of the 11 study hospitals (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org) because of syncope. 
A total of 1867 of the 2584 patients (mean age, 
54 years; range, 16 to 79) were either not admit-
ted to the hospital or declined hospitalization 
(Fig. 1). Of the 717 patients (27.7%) who were 
admitted, 157 (21.9%) were excluded from the 
study because they were receiving ongoing anti-
coagulation therapy (118 patients, 82 of whom 
were receiving it for atrial fibrillation and 36 for 
other reasons), had had previous episodes of syn-
cope (35 patients), or did not provide informed 
consent (4 patients). Hence, 560 patients with a 
first episode of syncope were included in the 
study. The main demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of the patients are provided in Table 2. 
Most of the patients were elderly (>75% were 
≥70 years of age). Clinical evidence suggested an 
explanation for syncope other than pulmonary 
embolism in 355 of the 560 patients (63.4%).
Prevalence of Pulmonary Embolism
In 330 of the 560 patients (58.9%), a diagnosis of 
pulmonary embolism was ruled out on the basis 
of the combination of low pretest clinical prob-
ability of pulmonary embolism and a negative 
d-dimer assay. Of the remaining 230 patients, 
135 (58.7%) had a positive d-dimer assay only, 
3 (1.3%) had a high pretest clinical probability

of pulmonary embolism only, and 92 (40.0%) 
had both. In 229 of these patients, either com-
puted tomography or ventilation–perfusion lung 
scanning was performed; in the case of 1 patient 
who died before objective testing could be per-
formed, an autopsy was performed after permis-
sion had been obtained. Pulmonary embolism 
was diagnosed in 72 of the 180 patients (40.0%) 
who underwent computed tomography and in 24 
of the 49 patients (49.0%) who underwent ventila-
tion–perfusion scanning (see the Supplementary 
Appendix) and was the cause of death of the 
1 patient in whom an autopsy was performed. 
Hence, pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 
97 of the patients who had a positive d-dimer 
assay, a high pretest clinical probability, or both 
(42.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 35.8 to 
48.6). In the entire cohort, the prevalence of 
pulmonary embolism was 17.3% (95% CI, 14.2 
to 20.5).

Among the 72 patients in whom pulmonary em-
bolism was detected by computed tomography,

Pulmonary Embolism in Patients Hospitalized for Syncope
a lobar artery in 18 patients (25.0%), a segmen-
tal artery in 19 patients (26.4%), and a subseg-
mental artery in 5 patients (6.9%). Among the 24 
patients in whom pulmonary embolism was de-
tected by ventilation–perfusion lung scanning, 
the perfusion defect involved more than 50% 
of the area of both lungs in 4 patients (16.7%), 
26 to 50% of the area of both lungs in 8 patients 
(33.3%), and 1 to 25% of the area of both lungs in 
the remaining 12 patients (50.0%). In the 1 patient 
who died, pulmonary embolism involved both 
main pulmonary arteries.
Additional Observations
Pulmonary embolism was detected in 52 of the 
205 patients who had syncope of undetermined 
origin (25.4%; 95% CI, 19.4 to 31.3) and in 45 of 
the 355 patients who were regarded as having 
a potential alternative explanation for syncope 
(12.7%; 95% CI, 9.2 to 16.1). Of the latter 45 pa-
tients, 31 (68.9%) had a lobar or more proximal 
location of the thrombus on computed tomogra-
phy or a perfusion defect of more than 25% of 
the area of both lungs on ventilation–perfusion 
scanning.
The prevalence of tachypnea was higher among 
the patients with pulmonary embolism than 
among the patients without pulmonary embolism 
(occurring in 45.4% vs. 7.1% of the patients), as 
were the prevalences of tachycardia (in 33.0% vs. 
16.2%), hypotension (in 36.1% vs. 22.9%), clini-
cal signs or symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis 
(in 40.2% vs. 4.5%), previous venous thrombo-
embolism (in 11.3% vs. 4.3%), and active cancer 
(in 19.6% vs. 9.9%). Of the 97 patients with 
pulmonary embolism, 24 (24.7%) had no clinical 
manifestations of the diagnosis, including tachy-
pnea, tachycardia, hypotension, or clinical signs 
or symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis.
Discussion
Our study used a systematic workup for pulmo-
nary embolism in a large series of patients who 
were hospitalized for a first episode of syncope 
and showed a high prevalence of pulmonary 
embolism among these patients; pulmonary em-
bolism was confirmed in approximately one of 
every six patients (17.3%). Although the preva-
lence of pulmonary embolism was highest among 
patients who presented with syncope of undeter-
mined origin (25% of patients), almost 13% of 
patients with potential alternative explanations 
for syncope had pulmonary embolism. Not sur-
prisingly, patients with dyspnea, tachycardia, 
hypotension, or clinical signs or symptoms of 
deep-vein thrombosis were more likely to have 
pulmonary embolism, as were those with active 
cancer. However, the proportion of patients who 
did not have these features yet had an objective 
confirmation of pulmonary embolism was not 
negligible.
The unexpectedly high prevalence of pulmo-
nary embolism among our patients with syncope 
contrasts with that reported elsewhere.12-17 It 
should be noted, however, that in the few con-
temporary studies that involved patients present-
ing with syncope, diagnostic testing for pulmo-
nary embolism was performed only in selected 
subgroups, which may have resulted in a poten-
tial underestimation of the prevalence of this 
vascular disorder. In contrast, our study involved 
consecutive patients, all of whom underwent a 
guidelines-based workup for pulmonary embo-
lism,5 regardless of whether another explanation 
was suggested clinically. Our study also involved 
multiple centers, and the results across the cen-
ters were consistent, with the prevalence of pul-
monary embolism ranging from 15 to 20% across 
centers.
Some methodologic issues in our study re-
quire comment. First, patients were included in 
the study if they were admitted to a medical 
ward after being examined in the emergency de-
partment for syncope, which was defined as full 
loss of consciousness for less than 1 minute, 
followed by spontaneous, complete resolution. 
As a consequence, this study did not include 
patients who were cared for on an ambulatory 
basis or patients who visited the emergency de-
partment but for whom hospitalization was not 
considered necessary. Second, syncope is a diag-
nostic challenge, because the diagnosis is based 
largely on the history of the patient, which could 
be supported by observations of bystanders who 
are usually not medically trained. In addition, 
there is often uncertainty about the causal rela-
tionship between an identified disorder (such as 
a self-terminating arrhythmia) and the episode of 
syncope. Third, all participating hospitals used 
a standardized protocol for the diagnostic work-
up of syncope that was based on international 
guidelines,1,2 but a specific workup was not man-
dated by the study protocol. In addition, the study

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
protocol specified that a diagnosis of pulmonary 
embolism should not affect the usual workup for 
syncope. Fourth, diagnostic imaging for pulmo-
nary embolism was performed only in patients 
who had an elevated d-dimer level or a high 
pretest clinical probability of pulmonary embo-
lism. Nevertheless, well-conducted clinical stud-
ies have shown conclusively that pulmonary 
embolism is highly unlikely in patients who have 
a low pretest clinical probability and a negative 
d-dimer assay.7,8,18-22 Fifth, the study protocol did 
not mandate objective confirmation of deep-vein 
thrombosis in symptomatic patients; thus, we 
are not aware of the rate of this complication 
among patients who reported pain or swelling in 
their legs. However, none of the patients who 
were included in the study spontaneously report-
ed these symptoms or visited the emergency de-
partment because of these symptoms. Sixth, the 
search for other causes of syncope was left to 
the discretion of the attending physicians. Hence, 
other causes of syncope may have been under-
reported. This may have been partly responsible 
for the fact that a definite cause of the syncope 
could not be determined in 205 patients. Seventh, 
pulmonary embolism is unlikely in patients who 
have had multiple episodes of syncope and in 
patients who are receiving anticoagulation ther-
apy; therefore, these patients were excluded from 
our study, and accordingly, our study results are 
not applicable to such patients. Finally, we did not 
collect information on treatment decisions and 
patient follow-up after completion of the diag-
nostic algorithm for pulmonary embolism be-
cause this was not a study objective.
Syncope is generally expected to occur in 
patients with pulmonary embolism if they have 
a sudden obstruction of the most proximal pul-
monary arteries that leads to a transient depres-
sion in cardiac output.23-25 In 49 of the 73 pa-
tients (67.1%) in our cohort who had pulmonary 
embolism that was diagnosed according to find-
ings from computed tomography or autopsy, the 
most proximal location of the embolus was a 
main pulmonary artery or a lobar artery. Simi-
larly, among the 24 patients who were assessed 
with ventilation–perfusion scanning, the perfu-
sion defect was larger than 25% of the total 
lung area in 12 patients (50.0%). These find-
ings suggest that, in at least half of the patients 
with pulmonary embolism in our study, the ex-
tent of thrombosis was large enough to produce 
an abrupt obstruction of the blood flow that 
would be likely to result in a sudden loss of con-
sciousness.
However, in approximately 40% of the pa-
tients, the extent of pulmonary vascular obstruc-
tion was smaller. Because there was no standard 
approach to the evaluation of syncope, a number 
of patients with small pulmonary emboli may 
have had syncope that was associated with an-
other condition that was missed. However, other 
mechanisms may be involved in the occurrence 
of syncope once a pulmonary embolism has de-
veloped, such as vasodepressor or cardioinhibi-
tory mechanisms.26-28 In addition, when a clot 
dislodges from the venous system and lodges in 
the pulmonary circulation, it may induce arrhyth-
mias when it passes through the heart. Hence, 
even smaller clots could be a potential cause of 
syncope. Studies addressing the mechanisms that 
trigger syncope in patients who have limited ob-
struction of the pulmonary arteries are warranted.
In conclusion, among patients who were hos-
pitalized for a first episode of syncope and who 
were not receiving anticoagulation therapy, pul-
monary embolism was confirmed in 17.3% (ap-
proximately one of every six patients). The rate 
of pulmonary embolism was highest among those 
who did not have an alternative explanation for 
syncope.
