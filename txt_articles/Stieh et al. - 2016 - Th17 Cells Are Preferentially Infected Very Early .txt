SUMMARY
The difficulty in detecting rare infected cells immedi-
ately after mucosal HIV transmission has hindered
our understanding of the initial cells targeted by the
virus. Working with the macaque simian immuno-
deficiency virus (SIV) vaginal challenge model, we
developed methodology to identify discrete foci of
SIV (mac239) infection 48 hr after vaginal inoculation.
We find infectious foci throughout the reproductive
tract, from labia to ovary. Phenotyping infected cells
reveals that SIV has a significant bias for infection of
CCR6+ CD4+ T cells. SIV-infected cells expressed
the transcriptional regulator RORgt, confirming that
the initial target cells are specifically of the Th17 line-
age. Furthermore, we detect host responses to infec-
tion, as evidenced by apoptosis, cell lysis, and
phagocytosis of infected cells. Thus, our analysis
identifies Th17-lineage CCR6+ CD4+ T cells as pri-
mary targets of SIV during vaginal transmission.
This opens new opportunities for interventions to
protect these cells and prevent HIV transmission.
INTRODUCTION
Developing effective prevention measures for HIV is hindered by
incomplete knowledge of the phenotype and localization of the
initial target cells of infection after mucosal viral exposure. Previ-
ous studies examining the earliest events after vaginal transmis-
sion have been limited by their inability to reliably detect rare
infected cells using general surveys of exposed tissues. Thus,
the earliest targets of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV
mucosal transmission remain an area of debate. Studies utilizing
a variety of approaches have differentially implicated all CD4+
cells as the earliest targets of infection after vaginal challenge
in macaques or human tissue explant models (Blauvelt et al.,
2000; Gupta et al., 2002; Hladik et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2000; Miller
and Hu, 1999; Peters et al., 2015; Reece et al., 1998; Zhang et al.,
1999). A small number of studies have attempted to identify the
cells infected by SIV in the first days after vaginal inoculation in
rhesus macaque (RM) models. Utilizing the SIVmac251 virus
swarm, Langerhans cells were identified as the major viral tar-
gets 18–24 hr postinfection (Hu et al., 2000; Miller and Hu,
1999). Likewise, studies identifying infected cells with in situ
PCR implicated dendritic cells as primary targets in the female
reproductive tract (FRT) 2 days postchallenge with SIVmac251
(Spira et al., 1996). In contrast, another study with SIVmac251
found infected T cells in the endocervix of RMs after 3 days,
although the paucity of infected cells identified by in situ hybrid-
ization prevented complete definition of infected cell phenotype
(Zhang et al., 1999). Studies quantifying cells infected with
SIVmac251 at time points of 4 days or longer, with a focus on
the endocervix, found T cells are principle targets of infection
(Li et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 1999). To advance our understand-
ing of transmission and the relevant target cells, it is clear that
more studies of the earliest time points after vaginal challenge
with SIV are required.
We have previously shown, through vaginal inoculation of RMs
with a high-titer SIV-based dual reporter vector (LICh) that
expresses luciferase, that initial infection events can be wide-
spread throughout the FRT and highly variable in their localiza-
tion (Stieh et al., 2014). Using LICh as a guide gives us the ability
to systematically identify and study small foci of infection events
in situ 48 hr after viral challenge. By mixing wild-type SIV with
LICh, we utilize the reporter system to identify discrete sites of
susceptibility to infection and determine if SIVmac239 infection
is also established. Utilizing this approach to SIV challenge, we
routinely identify infected cells and their fates in the FRT 48 hr
after vaginal challenge. By phenotyping infected cells, we find
that primary targets of infection are Th17 cells. This expands
upon the previously reported susceptibility of Th17 cells to infec-
tion and their early depletion by SIV/HIV infection following
vaginal transmission (Cecchinato and Franchini, 2010; Cecchi-
nato et al., 2008). Knowing the preference for Th17 cells during
transmission paves the way to unprecedented characterization
of host-virus interactions taking place during the earliest events
in transmission, and ultimately designing more effective treat-
ment and prevention strategies.
RESULTS
LICh Reporter Reveals SIV Infection
We hypothesized that our single round nonreplicating LICh
reporter could be used as a macroscopic guide to identify sites
susceptible to SIV infection shortly after inoculation, enabling

 identification of sites where transmission occurred. To test this,
a 3 mL mixed vaginal challenge of SIVmac239 and high-titer
LICh was administered to five female mature RMs, and the
animals were sacrificed 48 hr later as described in the Experi-
mental Procedures. The 48 hr time point provides a ‘‘snapshot’’
into the state of SIV infection very early after challenge, before
widespread systemic response to the virus. This time point
was chosen because it was the earliest interval at which we
could reliably detect reporter expression (Stieh et al., 2014).
Reproductive tracts were removed and soaked in luciferin to
reveal luciferase expression, and sites of infection were de-
tected using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) as previously
described (Stieh et al., 2014).
To test for SIVmac239 infection at each site in the FRT in the
mixed challenge, we extracted DNA from luciferase-positive
and random tissue blocks to probe for reverse-transcribed
DNA specific to the LICh LTR or SIV gag with single-copy sensi-
tivity. Nested PCR was performed on 56 tissues, representing
diverse sites throughout the FRT. Comparing the proportion of
reactions that were positive for LICh and SIVmac239 revealed
that their localization is highly correlated (Figure 1A; Pearson
R = 0.5746, p < 0.001). SIVmac239-infected cells were present
at all sites where there was detectable luciferase signal from
LICh. The sites where infection was found by PCR and confirmed
by microscopic analysis were widespread throughout the FRT
and highly variable between animals (Figure 1B). These findings
recapitulate the dispersed distribution of vector-susceptible
sites found previously with LICh, where we detected transduc-
tion from the vaginal vault to ovary. Most foci of infection were
found in vaginal tissue, where infection was identified in three
animals. Detection of SIVmac239 infection in the ovary of two
animals also confirms our finding that the ovary is a site of early
infection after vaginal challenge. Additionally, we found infection
in the uterus of one animal (CM38).
Validating SIV-Infected Cells by Detection of Altered
Surface Protein Expression
Having identified that sites of SIVmac239 infection span the FRT
by PCR, we sought to identify individual infected cells in tissues.
Because the wild-type virus was not tagged, we identified in-
fected cells utilizing antibodies to SIV antigens. To gain insights
into the appearance of SIV-infected cells and identify optimal
reagents, we optimized detection of SIV Gag and Env in RM
PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) infected with
SIVmac251 infectious molecular clone 766 (Figure S1, available
online) (Del Prete et al., 2013). Structured-illumination super-
resolution microscopy showed Gag and Env expression had
distinct localizations. Gag was typically detected in puncta,
consistent with assembling virions (Ivanchenko et al., 2009;
Jouvenet et al., 2008), while Env primarily associated with inter-
nal cellular membranes and the plasma membrane of the cell
surface (Hunter and Swanstrom, 1990; Rowell et al., 1995).
Denucleated, apoptotic bodies were also identified in these
cultures (Figure S1H).
Staining tissue sections from luciferase-positive tissue identi-
fied SIV Gag- and Env-positive cells with anticipated expression
patterns. To further validate that we were detecting SIV-infected
cells within tissue, we attempted to detect known changes in
cellular protein levels and localization within infected cells. To
this end, we costained for CD4, which is internalized and
degraded in infected cells (Garcia and Miller, 1991; Vincent
et al., 1993). In uninfected cells, CD4 localizes primarily to the
plasma membrane, while in SIV infected cells, CD4 is internal-
ized and fluorescence intensity decreases (Figure 2A). CD4
signal in infected cells varies from levels seen in uninfected cells
(Figure 2B, top row) to just above background levels (Figure 2B,
bottom row) as degradation becomes complete. To determine
the spatial distribution of CD4, internalization was quantified by
measuring the intensity-weighted size distribution of the CD4

 fluorescence, calculated as the radius of gyration (RoG) of CD4-
positive pixels. We examined the relationship between CD4 fluo-
rescence intensity and RoG to quantify the difference between
SIV-infected and uninfected cells (Figure 2C). We employed a
repeated-measures model including SIV status, RoG, and the
interaction between these factors as predictors of CD4 intensity
and found both SIV status and the interaction of SIV status
and RoG are significant predictors (parameter estimates ± SE;

0.21 ± 0.09, p = 0.011) and the CD4
RoG is lower (–1.47 ± 0.25, p < 0.001).
There is a negative correlation between
Env fluorescence and CD4 RoG (Fig-
ure 2D; –0.14 ± 0.05, p = 0.010). The cells
with the smallest CD4 RoG were those
with the highest levels of Env fluores-
cence, consistent with greater levels of
viral protein expression potentially reflect-
ing longer duration of infection.
Similarly, CD3 internalization without
subsequentdegradation hasbeendemon-
strated in vitro (Bell et al., 1998; Swigut
et al., 2003). CD3 expression in SIV-
infected cells shows punctate intracellular
localization, while uninfected cells have
CD3 on the cell surface (Figures 2E and
2F). In a similar analysis, as was used to
analyze CD4, only CD3 RoG was a signifi-
cant predictor of CD3 intensity (Figure 2G;
–139.01 ± 48.86, p = 0.006). The RoG is
decreased (–1.36 ± 0.32, p < 0.001) in
infected cells, while fluorescence intensity
is unchanged. Unlike the CD4 results, no
correlation is seen between Env intensity
and CD3 RoG (Figure 2H; 0.003 ± 0.065,
p = 0.968). The observation of CD4 inter-
nalization and degradation and the inter-
nalization, but not degradation, of CD3 in
SIV Gag/Env-expressing cells validate that we are observing
SIV-infected cells within the FRT 48 hr postchallenge.

 expression in four animals where foci of infection were identified.
Of 229 SIVmac239-infected cells characterized, 75.1% (172)
were CD3+, consistent with our previous study (Stieh et al.,
2014). This indicates a significant portion of CD3-negative target
cells (24.9%), including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs),
are infected during or shortly after transmission.
Although T helper cells represent the major target of SIV, not all
subsets are equally susceptible to infection and are depleted at
different rates from the mucosa (Alvarez et al., 2013; Brenchley
et al., 2008; Cartwright et al., 2014; Cecchinato and Franchini,
2010; Guillot-Delost et al., 2012; Paiardini et al., 2011; Prender-
gast et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2014; Veazey et al.,
2000). Th17 cells have been identified as being highly suscepti-
ble in vitro and selectively depleted from the gut and FRT (Canary
et al., 2013; Klatt et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012, 2014). We hypoth-
esized that the virus would also preferentially target these cells
during transmission. Infected cells were stained for Gag and
Env simultaneously, combined with staining for CD3 and
CCR6 or CCR10 and CCR6 (Figures 3A–3C). This established
approach can identify a distinct population containing Th17 cells
(Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007; Annunziato et al., 2007; Duhen
et al., 2009; Gosselin et al., 2010; Hirota et al., 2007; Wan
et al., 2011). Diverse cells were infected by SIV, including
CD3�CCR6+ (Figure 3B) and CD3�CCR6� (Figure 3C) cells,
which could be immature DCs and macrophages, respectively.
Remarkably, 84.3% (145) of the 172 SIV-infected T cells
expressed CCR6, indicating they were most likely Th17 cells
(Tables 1 and 2). Regardless of the animal (Table 1), the anatomic
site (Table 2) or the staining approach employed (CD3 and CCR6;
Figures3A–3C; orCCR10andCCR6;datanot shown),theCCR6+
T cell population represented the majority of cells with productive
SIV infection. Infected cells in all sites identified, including vagina,
ectocervix, endocervix, uterus,andovary, showed a major prefer-
ence for infection of CD3+CCR6+ Th17-like cells. Other T cells
totaled only 11.8% (27 out of 229) of infected cells.
Although all Th17s are included within the CCR6+ CD4 T cell
population, not all CCR6+ fit the definition of IL-17-producing
cells (Wan et al., 2011). While chemokine receptor expression
is commonly used to define T helper subsets, the most conclu-
sive mechanism to determine a cell’s functional phenotype is
measurements of cytokine production. However, stimulation
techniques are unavailable to studies of frozen tissue. An alter-
native approach is to examine the expression of lineage-specific
transcription factors: one such Th17-specific factor is the reti-
noic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma T (RORgt)
(Yang et al., 2008). We performed fluorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion for the RORc transcription variant encoding RORgt, com-
bined with IF labeling of CD3 and CCR6. Both CD3+ and
CD3� cells can express RORgt, as expected (Figures 3D and
3E). Further, we find that the vast majority (93.7%) of CCR6+
T cells are also RORgt+ in all animals that received the SIV and
LICh mixed challenge (Figure 3F). CD3�CCR6+ cell populations
expressing RORgt are presumably type 3 innate lymphoid cells
(Sawa et al., 2010).
In order to confirm that what we classified as Th17 cells has
the potential to be functional, we looked for evidence of IL-17A
expression by SIV-infected cells. Intracellular bodies of IL-17A
were found in a subset of SIV-infected cells (Figure S2A). Mito-
genic stimulation of PBMCs or vaginally derived CD4 T cells
from uninfected RMs demonstrated that all IL-17-producing
cells are from the CCR6+ population and that their frequency
in vaginal tissue is substantially enriched relative to the periphery
(Figures S2B and S2C), consistent with previous human and
murine studies.
If infection were occurring stochastically in all susceptible cell
types, the frequency of infected cells would mirror the frequency
of SIV-susceptible cells in the reproductive tract, or at least at the
specific sites where focal infection occurs. To test this, vaginal
and ectocervical tissue adjacent to sites where SIV infection
was identified was stained for chemokine receptor expression
to measure the makeup of the T helper cell populations. Th1-
like cells (defined as CD3+CD4+CXCR3+) were 51% ± 2.1%
of CD3+CD4+ cells (Figure S3). In contrast, the Th17 cells
(CD3+CD4+ CCR6+) were far less frequent in tissues, making
up 19.1% ± 2.8% of CD4 T cells. The density of the Th17 cells
(CD3+CD4+ CCR6+) counted in Figure S3 were further evalu-
ated for enriched localization at sites of either high T cell density,
representative of the sites where SIV infection was most
commonly found, and at low T cell density, more typically seen
throughout the FRT (Figure S4). In both vaginal (18.1% ± 2.3%)
and ectocervical tissue (20.2% ± 2.1%), no large change in the
relative proportion of Th17-like cells was observed. This gener-
ally agrees with the proportion of Th17 cells throughout the
human FRT as described by Rodriguez-Garcia et al. (Rodri-
guez-Garcia et al., 2014). Finally, Th2-like cells (CD3+CD4+
CCR4+) were less abundant than either Th1 or Th17 cells
(9.6% ± 3.8%; Figure S3). Other T cell populations were not
quantified based on local lymphocyte density.
With random targeting, out of the 172 SIV-infected T cells
(Table 2), we would expect 88 infected cells to be Th1 cells, and
only 33 cells to be Th17s because they represent 19% of the
FRT CD4 T cell population (Figure S3). Instead, Th17 infectedcells
totaled 84.3% of all T cell infections. There was a 4.4-fold
enhancement in their frequency of being infected relative to their
proportion of T helper cells. This represents a highly significant
deviation from stochastic targeting (p < 0.001), demonstrating
a strong selective preference for infection of Th17 cells by
SIVmac239 in the first 48 hr after vaginal exposure. Accounting
for all CD4+CCR5+ cells and not only T cells would demonstrate
an even greater preferential targeting of Th17 cells during trans-
mission, but this analysis is not achievable with four-color IF in
tissue sections.
Further, SIV-infected cells were often found in areas of
increased immune cell density below the basal layer of the
epithelium, similar to lymphoid aggregates previously reported
in the FRT (Kobayashi et al., 2002). We find SIV infection occurs
in small foci and is not evenly distributed. Immune cells more
densely populate sites of SIV infection relative to the tissue
average. However, not all lymphocyte clusters are sites of infec-
tion. When we stain for SIV antigens combined with CD3 and DC
marker CD11c, we typically see SIV infection associated with a
subset of lymphocyte aggregates, while nearby ones have
limited evidence of infected cells (Figure S5). This is similar to
previous studies of transmission, where infection was found in
focal regions at later time points of 4 days and beyond (Zhang
et al., 1999). The presence of these regions of dense immune
cell localization so early after infection may indicate that they
are pre-existing sites of inflammation.

 Other cellular factors have been shown to be key determinants
of susceptibility to infection, including coreceptor expression
and the replicative state of T cells. To relate these previously
defined parameters to our observations of preferential infection
of CCR6+ T cells, we measured CCR5 and Ki-67 expression
on vaginally derived CD4+ T cells from a different cohort of
four naive, five acutely infected (7–14 days), and three chronically
infected (>3 months) RMs by flow cytometry (Figure 4). CD4
T cell frequency was maintained early in vaginal tissue but almost
completely eliminated during chronic infection (Figure 4A). This
depletion prevented us from further characterizing vaginal
T cells from chronically SIV-infected RMs. The frequency of
CCR6+ CD4 T cells was similar in naive and acutely infected
RMs, and over 60% of their CCR6+ CD4 T cells also expressed

 CCR5, regardless of infection status (Figures 4B and 4C).
Expression levels of CCR6 in vaginal lymphocytes were also un-
changed during acute infection. The levels of CCR5 expression
on CCR6+ and CCR6� vaginal CD4 T cells were similar between
uninfected and acutely infected animals, indicating that receptor
expression levels are not the reason for preferential infection
(Figure 4E).
The Ki-67+CCR6+ fraction of CD4 T cells was not changed
during acute infection and averaged 5.2% in uninfected animals
(Figure 4F). Similarly, the frequency of Ki-67-positive cells within
CCR6+ vaginal CD4 T cells averaged 11.9% and did not change
during acute infection relative to uninfected animals. In a limited
survey of SIV-infected cells from animal EB11, no infected cells
found expressed Ki-67, unlike basal karatinocytes, which were
proliferating (Figure 4H). While this does not confirm that these
cells were not dividing at the time infection was established,
we do see that SIV proteins are actively expressed in nonprolif-
erating cells. Thus, the exact metabolic state of cells that permit
establishment of mucosal SIV infection remains an open ques-
tion. Separately, in PBMCs from uninfected RMs we looked
for any increase in expression of CCR6 after in vitro SIV infec-
tion, which may offer an alternate explanation of infection in
CCR6+ T cells. However, neither the frequency nor MFI of
CCR6 on the CD4 T cell populations increased over 3 (data
not shown) or 5 days in the presence of a spreading SIV infec-
tion (Figures 4I and 4J), and instead had a slight but insignificant
decrease.
SIV-Infected Cell Fates in the FRT
In addition to finding infected cells that still appear to be viable
and nucleated, we also identified other apparent fates of SIV-
infected cells. First, similar to our experience in PBMC infec-
tion (Figure S1H), we find denucleated apoptotic bodies in vivo
where Gag, Env, and cellular proteins, such as CD3 and CD4,
are still detectable (Figure 5A). These apparent apoptotic
bodies are typically small, measuring 2–5 mm in diameter.
Second, we observe cell lysis where SIV Gag and Env are
spread over larger areas and not associated with any partic-
ular cell (Figure 5B; Movie S1). Finally, we see phagocytosis
of infected T cells by myeloid cells, including macrophages
and DCs (Figure 5C). This was initially suggested by discrete
localization of SIV Gag and Env in cells lacking CD3. Phagocy-
tosis of infected cells was demonstrated in two ways: first,
where SIV Gag and Env localized in one dense cluster within
a CCR10+ or CD11c+ cell, or second, where SIV antigens
and CD3 colocalize within a CD11c+ cell, indicating a T cell
contained within a DC (Figure 5C). This has been reported to
represent the main mechanism by which macrophages and
DCs acquire viral antigens during SIV infection (Calantone
et al., 2014).
The relative frequency of these infectious outcomes was
evaluated, only including events where SIV Gag and Env were
stained for in separate channels. This ensured discrimination be-
tween apoptotic bodies or lysed cells and nonspecific fluores-
cence, while also seeing infected cells and phagocytosis. These
events were not easily distinguished in the infected cells where
staining was focused on Th17 phenotyping and SIV Gag and
Env were stained with the same fluorophore. In total, 218 infec-
tion events met these criteria (Figure 5D). Infected, nucleated
cells were the most common, but lysed and apoptotic cells
made up 10.6% and 9.2% of infection events, respectively.
Phagocytosis of infected cells comprised only 1.9% of infection
events, but this potentially underrepresents the actual frequency
due to difficulty in identifying SIV Gag- and Env-positive regions
within antigen-presenting cells. The subsequent degradation of
viral proteins in phagolysosomes will remove the ability to detect
phagocytosed cells by IF imaging. An additional confounder of
this analysis is that the half-life of SIV-infected cell fates in vivo
is not defined.
DISCUSSION
Utilizing a mixed vaginal challenge model with LICh and
SIVmac239 allows routine identification of SIV-infected cell foci
48 hr after exposure. The initiation of mucosal infection in such
foci has been reported by others (Miller et al., 2005). Character-
ization of these foci provides insights into the earliest steps
of vaginal transmission of wild-type SIV. By identifying multiple
small foci of infection, we can phenotype and quantify the
diverse cell types susceptible to infection and determine the po-
tential outcomes of SIV infection at sites of transmission. Over
the course of 48 hr, viral replication can occur, and the cells iden-
tified here likely include others than those infected by the initial
inoculum. In total, data describing over 500 infection events
are included in this study. We show SIV infection is found
throughout the FRT, from the labia to the ovaries, demonstrating
that prevention measures must protect the entire organ system
to afford maximal protection.
Phenotyping infected cells reveals a significant bias for
infection of Th17-like, CCR6+ cells during vaginal infection.

aInfected cells in the labia and lymph node are not included in the analysis of CCR6 expression because the foci of infection in these tissues were
depleted in our immune cell phenotyping studies.

Cell Host & Microbe 19, 529–540, April 13, 2016
 Confirmation that the CCR6+ CD4 T cells that we find infected
by SIV express the transcriptional regulator RORgt provides
further evidence that the cells targeted are specifically of the
Th17 lineage. A variety of reports indicate that Th17 cells are
acutely susceptible to SIV and HIV infection and are systemati-
cally depleted during early infection. The reasons for increased
susceptibility of these cells are not yet clear. Th17 cells have
been reported to express high levels of CCR5, facilitating entry.
However, enhanced susceptibility to SIV is independent of
route of entry, with VSVg pseudotyped virions also preferentially
infecting Th17 cells (El Hed et al., 2010; Monteiro et al., 2011). We
find similar CCR5 levels when comparing CCR6+ and CCR6�
vaginally derived CD4 T cells in naive or acutely SIV-infected
RMs, in agreement with others (Alvarez et al., 2013). A potential
caveat in comparing the SIVmac239-based studies here to
previous work with SIVmac251 is potential difference in target
cell tropism. The clonal SIVmac239 virus has been reported
to have a preference to infect T cells, while the SIVmac251
swarm can better infect macrophages (Hu et al., 2000; Miller
and Hu, 1999). It is notable that we do detect 25% of our infec-
tions in dendritic cells and macrophages with SIVmac239.
Future studies are required to determine how SIV and HIV enve-
lope tropism influences target cell preference after vaginal
challenge.
Preferential infection of Th17 cells extending to the earliest
events of transmission is unexpected and has important implica-
tions. These cells are critical for maintaining mucosal epithelial
integrity, and their loss may play a role in the ensuing inflamma-
tion that drives further viral replication, facilitating dissemination.
Sites that are susceptible to SIV infection in this challenge model
comprise only a small proportion of the entire FRT. Most sites
have intact epithelial or mucus barriers that prevent viral ingress
(Carias et al., 2013), but where barrier integrity is weakened, im-
mune cells are recruited. In particular, the role of Th17 cells in
maintaining epithelial integrity through the CCL20/CCR6 axis is
an important mechanism for stimulating keratinocyte production
(Martin et al., 2013). This establishes a model of transmission
where epithelial sites with weakened barrier function that are
susceptible to viral entry sense increased antigen levels and in-
crease production of CCL20. In response, these same sites are
locations to which highly susceptible Th17 cells are recruited
and stimulated. Rather than relying on the broadcasting of
a small founder population of infected cells, SIV instead can
most easily cross the epithelium where a pre-existing cluster of
target cells is activated. Further, rapid elimination of these cells
prevents epithelial repair, permitting additional antigenic expo-
sure and further recruitment of target cells, rapidly facilitating
spread of infected foci.
The studies presented here reveal a rapid innate and intrinsic
antiviral response to SIV infection in the FRT. Which alternatives
are beneficial to the spread of infection and which, if any, result
in improved control remain open questions. Rapid host re-
sponses are consistent with developing models of transmission,
suggesting transmitted viruses are more resistant to interferon
responses and that PAMP receptors detect SIV very early.
Apparent lysed cells have been previously described in lymphoid
tissues during acute SIV infection (Wang et al., 2009) and may
reflect cell death by pyroptosis, defined by cell lysis in response
to signals from pathogens (Fink and Cookson, 2005; Lamkanfi
and Dixit, 2010). There have been other recent reports of immu-
nodeficiency viruses inducing bystander cell death by pyropto-
sis, unlike the lysed infected cells observed here (Doitsh et al.,
2014). Lytic cells at the portal of infection suggest proinflamma-
tory cell death begins very early after infection. In contrast, we
also find apoptosis, which is a highly controlled noninflammatory
cell death mechanism and avoids elicitation of inflammatory
responses.
Defining the location and phenotype of SIV-infected cell foci
and early host responses informs the development of interven-
tions designed to decrease HIV acquisition. Preferential infec-
tion of cells from the Th17 lineage could explain the known
conditions that increase HIV acquisition, including sexually
transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis. How these condi-
tions precisely influence mucosal barrier function or the density
of target cells remains to be determined. However, the system
presented here provides essential sampling of these foci, facil-
itating characterization of the earliest host responses to SIV/
HIV infection.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by
Northwestern University and Tulane National Primate Research Center Local
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs), protocol P0153.
This study was carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH and with the recommendations of the
Weatherall report ‘‘The use of nonhuman primates in research.’’ All procedures
were performed under anesthesia using ketamine hydrochloride, and all efforts
were made to minimize stress, improve housing conditions, and provide
enrichment opportunities. Animals were euthanized by sedation with ketamine
hydrochloride injection followed by intravenous barbiturate overdose in accor-
dance with the recommendations of the panel on euthanasia of the American
Veterinary Medical Association.
Reporter Vector, Virus Production, and Characterization
SIVmac251 infectious molecular clone 766 (SIVmac766) was generated
as previously described by transfection of 239T cells with pSIVmac766.4
complexed with polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Del Prete et al., 2013).
LICh reporter was produced as previously reported (Stieh et al., 2014).
Briefly, reporter virus is produced by transfection of 293T cells with four plas-
mids complexed with PEI: LICh reporter genome, SIV3+ packaging vector,
REV expression plasmid DM121, and JRFL envelope. Viruses containing su-
pernatants were collected 48 hr posttransfection, purified through 0.22 mm
filters, concentrated over sucrose cushions, and resuspended in DMEM.
Concentrated virus was stored at –80�C.

 SIVmac239 was generated by transfection and expansion in CEMx174 cells.
Virus production was monitored by measuring p27 antigen. Cells were main-
tained with RPMI and addition of new cells every 3–4 days. At 24 hr before
harvest, cells are washed and resuspended in fresh RPMI. Virus containing su-
pernatant is then centrifuged, filtered, aliquoted, and stored at –80�C. The p27
concentration of the challenge stock was 1,130 pgmL�1. Infection of Ghost-
Bonzo cells revealed infection of �4% of the cells at 1:2 dilution 48 hr after viral
exposure. Infectivity of viral stock was determined by measuring infection of
CEMx174 cells by at the limiting viral dilution that was positive for p27 after
21 days of culture; this gave a TCID50 determination of 105.91 per mL.
Nonhuman Primate Studies
In total, seven female and two male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; RM)
were challenged in this study, all of which were fully mature. Estimation of
SIVmac239 50% animal infectious dose (AID50) was performed by increasing
dose mucosal challenge. Two female macaques were inoculated vaginally and
two male macaques were inoculated rectally every 2 weeks beginning with 1 in
100,000 dilution and increasing 10-fold. Challenge with 0.5 mL of a 1 in 10 dilu-
tion resulted in one vaginally inoculated animal and one rectally inoculated
animal becoming infected. This allows us to estimate the challenge dose
used in subsequent vaginal inoculations at an AID50 of 101.30 per mL.
Five female animals received a 2 mm vaginal pinch biopsy in the upper
vagina/fornix and were observed for 3–4 min using a vaginal speculum
to insure there was no excessive bleeding. The vaginal viral inoculations
were performed immediately after using a pliable, blunt no. 8 French
pediatric feeding tube attached to the inoculum syringe and inserted
2–3 cm into the vaginal vault; the inoculum is slowly expelled into the
vaginal vault. After delivery the tube is flushed with air to ensure that the
entire volume of material has been delivered. The feeding tube is slowly
removed and the animal is maintained in ventral recumbency with the
pelvis elevated for 15 min. The animal is then returned to her cage and
monitored until fully recovered from anesthesia. Animals were sacrificed
48 hr after inoculation, and their genital tracts were removed and shipped
on ice overnight for further processing as previously described (Stieh et al.,
2014).
Tissue Staining and Microscopy
Antibody clones and suppliers used are as follows: SIV Gag (Ag3.0, hybrid-
oma supernatant), SIV Env (KK41 and KK42, AIDS Reagent Repository),
CD3 (SP7, Abcam), CD4 (OKT4, hybridoma supernatant), CCR4 (551121,
BD Pharmigen), CXCR3 (ab125255, Abcam), CCR6 (53103, R&D Systems),

 (3.9, Life Technologies). All secondary antibodies were raised in donkey
and supplied by Jackson Immuno Research. PBMCs were adhered to cov-
erslips with CellTak and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PIPES buffer and
stained with anti-SIV Gag and Env antibodies in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cryo-
sections of tissue (15 mm thick) were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PIPES
buffer. When multiple primary antibodies of the same species were used,
one was labeled with a Xenon IgG labeling kit using AlexaFluor fluoro-
chromes. After antibody staining, cells and tissue were incubated with
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for visualization of nuclei. Fluorescent
in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect RORc transcript variants encoding
RORgt was performed with CAL Fluor Red 590 conjugated RNA probes
generated using Stellaris RNA FISH probe designer. FISH staining was per-
formed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for sequential IF
and FISH (Biosearch Technologies). Secondary-only antibody control im-
ages were used to set specificity thresholds for each channel, as previously
documented (Stieh et al., 2014). Specificity of the fluorescent signal is
established by comparing images to that of control slides to identify
patterns of autofluorescent background that are present. Four-color
image stacks containing 30 sections in the Z plane in 0.5 mm steps were
acquired and deconvolved using softWoRx software (Applied Precision)
on a DeltaVision inverted microscope. Quantitative image analysis of viral
antigens, CD3 and CD4 fluorescence signal, and radius of gyration was
performed in IDL 7.1.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses of CD3 and CD4 behavior on infected cells were performed using
repeated-measures models accounting for repeats within animal assuming
a compound symmetric covariance structure. Assumptions were as-
sessed by examining the distribution of the outcome and model diagnos-
tics to decide on the outcome’s functional form and fit of the model.
For tissues stained for SIV antigens and CD4, we evaluated if the data sug-
gest relationships between the following variables: (1) log-transformed
fluorescence intensity outcome with SIV status, radius of gyration (RoG),
and their interaction; (2) outcome of RoG with SIV status; and (3) fluores-
cence intensity log-transformed outcome with RoG stratified by signal
type (Env and DAPI). These analyses were repeated for CD3. The models
were performed in SAS 9.4 using a significance level of 0.05. Chi-square
test in Microsoft Excel was used to test for nonrandom infection of Th17
cells.
