Association of Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy
With Behavioral Problems in Childhood
Evidence Against Confounding
Evie Stergiakouli, PhD; Anita Thapar, FRCPsych, PhD; George Davey Smith, MD, DSc
IMPORTANCE Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is used by a large proportion of pregnant
women. Research suggests that acetaminophen use in pregnancy is associated with
abnormal fetal neurodevelopment. However, it is possible that this association might be
confounded by unmeasured behavioral factors linked to acetaminophen use.
OBJECTIVE To examine associations between offspring behavioral problems and (1) maternal
prenatal acetaminophen use, (2) maternal postnatal acetaminophen use, and (3) partner’
s
acetaminophen use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From February 2015 to March 2016, we collected and
analyzed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a
prospective birth cohort. We studied 7796 mothers enrolled in ALSPAC between 1991 and
1992 along with their children and partners.
EXPOSURES Acetaminophen use was assessed by questionnaire completion at 18 and 32
weeks of pregnancy and when the child was 61 months old.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Maternal reports of behavioral problems using the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the children were 7 years old. We
estimated risk ratios for behavioral problems in children after prenatal, postnatal, and
partner’
s exposure to acetaminophen and mutually adjusted each association.
RESULTS Maternal prenatal acetaminophen use at 18 (n = 4415; 53%) and 32 weeks of
pregnancy (n = 3381; 42%) was associated with higher odds of having conduct problems (risk
ratio [RR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.25-1.62) and hyperactivity symptoms (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.49),
while maternal acetaminophen use at 32 weeks was also associated with higher odds of
having emotional symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.53) and total difficulties (RR, 1.46; 95%
CI, 1.21-1.77). This was not the case for maternal postnatal (n = 6916; 89%) or partner’
s
(n = 3454; 84%) acetaminophen use. We found the associations between maternal prenatal
acetaminophen use and all the SDQ domains unchanged even after adjusting for maternal
postnatal or partner’
s acetaminophen use.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children exposed to acetaminophen prenatally are at
increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties, and the associations do not appear to be
explained by unmeasured behavioral or social factors linked to acetaminophen use insofar as
they are not observed for postnatal or partner’
s acetaminophen use. Although these results
could have implications for public health advice, further studies are required to replicate the
findings and to understand mechanisms.

A
cetaminophen (paracetamol) is one of the most com-
mon pain-relieving medications and is considered gen-
erally safe for use during all stages of pregnancy, mak-
ing it the first-choice pain and fever medication for pregnant
women. Given the large number of pregnant women using the
drug (>50% in the United States1; 50%-60% in the European
Union2), even a small increase in risk of adverse outcomes in
theoffspringcanhaveimportantimplicationsforpublichealth.

pregnancyhasbeenfoundtodisruptendocrinetesticularfunc-
tion in male embryos, and long-term acetaminophen use has
been linked to an increase in risk of cryptorchidism.5
Acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with
a higher risk of hyperkinetic disorders and attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors. This has been
observed in a very large sample of children and their mothers
from the Danish National Birth Cohort.6 Similar results were
also reported in a cohort of children and their mothers from
New Zealand.7 In addition, a sibling-controlled cohort study
that partially controlled for familial confounding found that
long-term acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associ-
ated with adverse developmental outcomes at age 3 years.8
Although a large number of potential confounders were
accounted for in the previous studies, there is still the possi-
bility of unrecognized confounding. Maternal behaviors dur-
ing pregnancy, including acetaminophen use, can be associ-
ated with multiple maternal factors, including socioeconomic
ones, as well as disease and health outcomes such as behav-
ioral difficulties in the offspring.9 One mechanism behind the
associationbetweenmaternallyinfluencedprenatalfactorsand
offspring outcome is genetic confounding, whereby a risk fac-
tor and a disease have shared genetic influences. For ex-
ample, genetic confounding has been shown to be present in
the association between smoking during pregnancy, another
prenatal risk factor, and ADHD10 and behavioral problems.11
To best inform public health advice, study designs must
accountforunmeasuredandfamilialconfoundingwhenevalu-
ating acetaminophen use during pregnancy.12 Although these
designs have been used to control for confounding in studies
of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and asthma,13 they have
not been used to investigate the association of prenatal acet-
aminophen use with offspring behavioral difficulties. The de-
sign of these studies includes comparisons between mater-
nal prenatal exposures and maternal postnatal exposures as
well as partner’
s exposures during pregnancy. If an intrauter-
ine effect of acetaminophen exposure on offspring behavior
is present, one would expect association with maternal pre-
natal exposure but not with maternal postnatal exposure or
partner’
s exposure because only the maternal prenatal expo-
sure has direct biological effect on the fetus.14 For example,
effects of maternal smoking in pregnancy on birth weight14 but
not offspring fat mass15 were stronger than that of partner’
s
smoking in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Chil-
dren (ALSPAC),16,17 in line with other evidence suggesting a
causal intrauterine mechanism.
In this study, we assessed associations between behav-
ioral problems in offspring at age 7 years in the ALSPAC popu-
lation cohort and (1) maternal prenatal acetaminophen use,
(2) maternal postnatal acetaminophen use, (3) partner’
s acet-
aminophen use.
Methods
Study Population
The ALSPAC is a prospective birth cohort study that recruited
pregnant women from Bristol, England with expected delivery
dates between April 1991 and December 1992. A total of 14 541
pregnant women were initially enrolled with 14 062 children
born. Detailed information on health and development of chil-
dren and their parents were collected from regular clinic visits
andcompletionofquestionnaires.Adetaileddescriptionofthe
cohorthasbeenpublishedpreviously.16,17Thestudywebsitecon-
tains details of all the data available through a fully searchable
data dictionary: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers
/access/. Written informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants, and ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC
law and ethics committee and the local ethics committees.
Acetaminophen Use by the Mother and Her Partner
Mothers were asked at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy if they
had used acetaminophen in the previous 3 months. The same
question was asked again of the mother and her partner when
the child was 61 months old. They were also asked if they had
muscle and joint problems, infections (including cold or flu,
urinary,orotherinfections),migraine,orheadachesatthesame
periods. However, they were not asked detailed questions on
dose or duration or indications of use.
Outcomes
Weassessedchildren’

andDifficultiesQuestionnaire(SDQ),18achildbehaviorscreen-
ing questionnaire (age range, 4-16 years) that includes ques-
tions in 5 domains: emotional symptoms, conduct problems,
Key Points
Question Is the association between maternal acetaminophen
use during pregnancy and behavioral problems in children
consistent with an intrauterine mechanism?
Findings In this longitudinal birth cohort study of parents and
children, maternal prenatal acetaminophen use was associated
with increased odds of behavioral problems in children, whereas
maternal postnatal and partner’
s acetaminophen use were not.
Meaning Children exposed to acetaminophen use prenatally are
at increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties, and the
associations do not appear to be explained by unmeasured
behavioral or social factors, since they are not linked to postnatal
or partner’
s acetaminophen use.

hyperactivity symptoms, peer relationship problems, and pro-
social behaviors scored from 0 to 10 each.18 A total difficul-
ties score (range, 0-40) can be obtained by summing the scores
from the following 4 subscales: emotional symptoms, con-
duct problems, hyperactivity symptoms, and peer relation-
ship problems (not including prosocial behavior, for which a
higher score indicates less behavioral problems) (http://www
.sdqinfo.com). Mothers’reports on their children’
s behavioral
problems were obtained when the children were 7 years old.
Cutoffs were used to dichotomize each of the 5 SDQ subscales
as well as the total difficulties score as in previous studies.18
Confounding Factors
We repeated all our analyses including the following poten-
tial confounding factors: maternal age at birth, parity, socio-
economic status, smoking and alcohol consumption during
pregnancy, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), maternal
self-reported psychiatric illness, and possible indications for
acetaminophen use. Mothers were asked to report whether
they smoked or consumed alcohol during pregnancy by com-
pleting a questionnaire at 32 weeks of pregnancy. At the same
time, they were also asked if they had muscle and joint prob-
lems, infections (including cold or flu, urinary, or other infec-
tions), migraine, or headaches in the previous 3 months. We
decided to include these factors in the model because they are
the most common indications for acetaminophen use.
Genetic Confounders
Composite scores of molecular genetic risk factors for ADHD
(polygenic risk scores) were calculated for 8340 ALSPAC moth-
ers using available genotype data (details on the quality con-
trol procedure have been published previously19) according to
the method described by the International Schizophrenia
Consortium.20Polygenicriskscoreswerecomputedusing“risk
alleles” based on the results of an independent case-control
UnitedKingdom/IrelandADHDgenome-wideassociationstudy
(GWAS) (discovery sample). Quality control procedures, ascer-
tainment of these samples, and GWAS results have been de-
scribed in detail previously.21 In line with previous studies,22,23
a threshold of P < .50 was used to select alleles more common
in cases than controls from the discovery sample (single-
nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] in relative linkage equilib-
rium in the discovery sample GWAS were selected first). These
identifiedSNPswereusedtocalculateapolygenicscoreforeach
individual in ALSPAC, corresponding to the mean number of
scorealleles(weightedbythelogarithmoftheoddsratio)across
the set of SNPs. Analysis was performed using PLINK.24 Logis-
tic regression was used to test if maternal ADHD polygenic risk
scores were associated with maternal prenatal and postnatal
acetaminophen use. Paternal genotype data were unavailable.
Statistical Analyses

were also analyzed as continuous outcomes after logarithmic
transformation.
To address potential confounding by unmeasured ge-
netic and nongenetic confounders, we compared maternal

carried out to compare maternal prenatal acetaminophen use
with partner’

All analyses were repeated with the inclusion of potential
confounding factors. All information on confounding factors
was obtained by questionnaire completion from the mother
and her partner.
Results
Acetaminophen use was reported by 4415 mothers (53%) at 18
weeks of pregnancy and by 3381 mothers (42%) at 32 weeks.
A total of 6916 mothers (89%) and 3 454 partners (84%) used
acetaminophen postnatally, and 5% of children had behavioral
problems,asindicatedbythetotaldifficultiesscoreoftheSDQ.
(SeeeTable1intheSupplementfordetailsonthenumberofchil-
dren with behavioral problems.) The mean (SD) age of children

(1.3) months. Other characteristics of mothers reporting acet-
aminophenuseinALSPACandtheirchildrenarelistedinTable1.
Allofthesecharacteristicswereincludedintheadjustedanaly-
ses reported in eTables 2 through 5 in the Supplement.
Maternal prenatal acetaminophen use at 18 weeks of preg-
nancy was associated with higher odds of offspring conduct
problems(RR,1.20;95%CI,1.06-1.37)andhyperactivitysymp-
toms (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.39), while maternal acetamino-
phen use at 32 weeks of pregnancy was associated with higher
odds of offspring having emotional symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95%
CI, 1.09-1.53), conduct problems (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.25-1.62),
hyperactivity symptoms (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.49), and total
difficulties (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.21-1.77), as assessed by the SDQ
(Table 2). This was not the case for maternal postnatal acet-
aminophen use or partner’
s acetaminophen use, which were
not associated with any of the SDQ domains (Table 3). Inclu-
sion of covariates did not change the RRs, although CIs were
wider owing to the reduced sample size when covariates were
included (eTables 2 and 3 in the Supplement).
After mutual adjustment of maternal prenatal and mater-
nal postnatal acetaminophen use, the associations between
maternal prenatal acetaminophen use and all the SDQ do-
mains remained unchanged, while the associations for mater-
nal postnatal acetaminophen use were attenuated (Table 4).
When adjusting maternal prenatal acetaminophen use for
partner’
s acetaminophen use, we found that the effect was un-
changed despite the smaller sample size in this analysis
(Table 5).
All analyses were repeated with potential confounders in-
cluding genetic ones, and results are summarized in eTables
2 through 5 in the Supplement. In linear regression models,
results were similar (eTables 6 through 9 in the Supplement).
There was little evidence of association between mater-
nal ADHD polygenic risk scores and maternal prenatal acet-
aminophen use at 18 weeks of pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] per
SD of polygenic risk score, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05; P = .90),
32 weeks of pregnancy (OR per SD of polygenic risk score, 0.98;
95% CI, 0.94-1.03; P = .48), or with postnatal acetaminophen
use (OR per SD of polygenic risk score, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-
1.00; P = .06.
Discussion
Inthisstudy,wehavedemonstratedthatchildrenexposedpre-
natally to acetaminophen in the second and third trimesters
are at increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties, includ-
ing hyperactivity and conduct problems. Prenatal acetamino-
phen exposure at 32 weeks’gestation was also associated with
emotionalproblems.Theassociationsdidnotchangewhenma-
ternal postnatal or partner’
s acetaminophen use were in-
cluded in the model. Similar to the Danish National Registry
observations,6 the associations were also not confounded by
maternal migraine, infections, and other measured factors. In
addition, an index of ADHD genetic risk in the mothers was not
associated with acetaminophen use during pregnancy. These
findings, when coupled with those from the previous discor-
dant sibling design study,8 suggest that the association be-
tween prenatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood be-
havioral problems is not explained by unmeasured familial
factors linked to both acetaminophen use and childhood be-
havioral problems and that the findings are consistent with an
intrauterine effect. Our results could have important implica-
tions for public health advice, which currently considers
acetaminophen safe to use during pregnancy.

Our results also suggest that the timing of acetaminophen
use might be important. More specifically, we found stronger
association between maternal acetaminophen use and mul-
tiple behavioral and emotional problem domains during the
third trimester than during the second trimester, in agreement
with previous studies that have included multiple measure-
ment times during pregnancy.8 Given that there is active brain
development and growth during the third trimester, this find-
ing could indicate that there are developmental periods when
the brain is more sensitive to acetaminophen exposure.
The mechanism through which adverse effects of acet-
aminophen on fetal neurodevelopment might be mediated are
not well understood.12 One mechanism might involve the en-
docrine-disrupting properties of acetaminophen. The disrup-
tion of the maternal hormonal environment could affect fetal
braindevelopment.Itiswellknownthatthyroidhormones,for
example, are important for fetal brain development.4 It is also
known that acetaminophen crosses the placenta,25 and ani-
mal studies have shown that the fetus is capable of producing
the toxic metabolites of acetaminophen.26 This highlights the
need for further experimental research to identify potential
causal mechanisms. Another possibility is that acetamino-
phendisruptsbraindevelopmentthroughoxidativestress.Stud-
ies in humans suggest that long-term use of acetaminophen re-
duces serum antioxidants and disrupts oxidant-antioxidant
balance.27 Increased amounts of oxidants in the fetus can then
lead to neuronal death at critical points during development.28
One strength of this study is the availability of prospective
informationonacetaminophenuseduringthesecondandthird
trimesters of pregnancy and postnatally by the mother and by
her partner. This enabled us to use a nested quasi-experimen-
taldesigninwhichweassessedtheeffectofacetaminophenuse
during pregnancy on offspring behavioral difficulties and com-
pare it with maternal postnatal acetaminophen use and part-
ner’
s acetaminophen use. Postnatal and partner use are likely
associated with stable social and familial factors, as is prenatal
maternal use, but cannot have a biological effect on fetal brain
development. This approach has been used previously in
ALSPAC to suggest that the association between prenatal acet-
aminophen use and asthma in the offspring is not confounded
by unmeasured behavioral factors.13 Our study also had the ad-
vantage of assessing the effect of acetaminophen at 2 different
times in fetal development.

confounding. This has been shown to contribute to the asso-
ciation between maternal smoking during pregnancy and off-
spring ADHD.10 However, ADHD polygenic risk scores were not
associated with maternal acetaminophen use during preg-
nancy in ALSPAC. Another advantage of our study was the use
of the SDQ, which is a validated and reliable screening instru-
ment for behavioral problems in children.29 Finally, recall bias
for acetaminophen use should not be present in this study be-
cause the questionnaire on acetaminophen use was adminis-
tered several years before the SDQ.
A limitation of this study is that there was no maternally
reported information on the indications for acetaminophen
use.However,wewereabletoadjustforthemostcommonrea-
sons for use, which include headaches, musculoskeletal prob-
lems, and infections during pregnancy. While there is little evi-
denceofapossiblecorrelationbetweenthesehealthconditions
during pregnancy and behavioral problems in the offspring,
we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding or
fetal effects on maternal health during pregnancy. We also did
not have information on dosage or duration of acetamino-
phen use to test whether long-term use or large doses of ac-
etaminophen are more detrimental than casual use. How-
ever, only 0.1% of women reported acetaminophen use every
day during the previous 3 months.
Anotherconcerncouldbethatinformationonpostnatalac-
etaminophenusewasonlycollectedwhenthechildwas5years
old. However, regardless of the timing, postnatal acetamino-
phen use for mother and partner cannot have a causal biologi-
cal intrauterine effect, and it is a valid indicator of stable con-
founding factors shared within families. Nonetheless, this will
notbethecaseforconfoundingfactorsthathavechangedsince
thebirthofthechild.Inaddition,althoughthemajorityofpart-
ners (97%) considered themselves the biological father of their
child, and they were all living with the mothers at the time the
questionnaire was completed, there were no genetic data on
partners to confirm paternity. An additional limitation is that
polygenicriskscoresforcomplexdisordersexplainonlyasmall
proportion of phenotype variance.30 However, there is no rea-
sontobelievethatthegeneticcontributiontoADHDnotpicked
up by these scores would have a different association with
acetaminophen use. Finally, measures of exposures and out-
comesinvolvedmaternalreports;thus,sharedratereffectscan-
not be completely ruled out. However, mothers also reported
on postnatal use of acetaminophen.
Conclusions
Children exposed to acetaminophen use prenatally are at in-
creased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties. The associa-
tions were not observed for postnatal or partner’
s acetamino-
phen use, which indicates that these behavioral difficulties
mightnotbeexplainedbyunmeasuredbehavioralorsocialfac-
tors linked to acetaminophen use. Our findings suggest that
the association between acetaminophen use during preg-
nancy and offspring behavioral problems in childhood may be
due to an intrauterine mechanism. Further studies are re-
quiredtoelucidatemechanismsbehindthisassociationaswell
as to test alternatives to a causal explanation. Given the wide-
spreaduseofacetaminophenamongpregnantwomen,thiscan
have important implications on public health advice. How-
ever, the risk of not treating fever or pain during pregnancy
should be carefully weighed against any potential harm of
acetaminophen to the offspring.
