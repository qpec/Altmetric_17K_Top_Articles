Abstract
Background: Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for at least five decades. Incidence
rates in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont are about 20% higher than the United States overall. We explored reasons for
this excess, focusing on arsenic in drinking water from private wells, which are particularly prevalent in the region.
Methods: In a population-based case-control study in these three states, 1213 bladder cancer case patients and 1418 control
subjects provided information on suspected risk factors. Log transformed arsenic concentrations were estimated by linear
regression based on measurements in water samples from current and past homes. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Bladder cancer risk increased with increasing water intake (Ptrend ¼ .003). This trend was statistically significant
among participants with a history of private well use (Ptrend ¼ .01). Among private well users, this trend was apparent if well
water was derived exclusively from shallow dug wells (which are vulnerable to contamination from manmade sources,
Ptrend ¼ .002) but not if well water was supplied only by deeper drilled wells (Ptrend ¼ .48). If dug wells were used pre-1960,
when arsenical pesticides were widely used in the region, heavier water consumers (>2.2 L/day) had double the risk of light
users (<1.1 L/day, Ptrend ¼ .01). Among all participants, cumulative arsenic exposure from all water sources, lagged 40 years,
yielded a positive risk gradient (Ptrend ¼ .004); among the highest-exposed participants (97.5th percentile), risk was twice that
of the lowest-exposure quartile (odds ratio ¼ 2.24, 95% confidence interval ¼ 1.29 to 3.89).
Conclusions: Our findings support an association between low-to-moderate levels of arsenic in drinking water and bladder
cancer risk in New England. In addition, historical consumption of water from private wells, particularly dug wells in an era
when arsenical pesticides were widely used, was associated with increased bladder cancer risk and may have contributed to
the New England excess.

 Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern
New England for at least five decades (Figure 1) (1). Incidence
rates for Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont show a similar
pattern with rates between 2001 and 2004 about 20% higher
than that for the United States overall. In 2001 to 2004, the age-
adjusted incidence rate in these three states combined was
38.8/100 000 compared with 32.0/100 000 in the United States.
This elevation is particularly provocative because bladder can-
cer rates in the United States tend to be higher in urban com-
pared with rural areas (2,3). The persistent excess in New
England has been observed in both sexes, suggesting the role of
a shared environmental etiologic factor. Historically, a number
of exposures have been hypothesized to be responsible, includ-
ing established factors such as smoking and occupation (4,5)
and suspected risk factors that are prevalent in the region
(French/French Canadian ancestry [4], consumption of shellfish
[6], and bracken fern [fiddlehead greens] [7], and use of wood
burning stoves [exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]
[5,8]). More recently, it was recognized that a unique feature of
this region is the high proportion of the population using
private wells for drinking water (9,10). Because of the region’s
geology, well water in northern New England often contains
low-to-moderate levels of arsenic (generally <100 mg/L) (9).
Additionally, extensive use of arsenical pesticides from the
1920s to 1960s on blueberry, apple, and potato crops was a man-
made source of arsenic in the region (11). Arsenic is an estab-
lished cause of bladder cancer, largely based on observations in
highly exposed populations (�100 lg/L) (5,12); however, emerg-
ing
evidence
from
two
studies,
including
one
in
New
Hampshire, suggests that low-to-moderate levels may also in-
crease bladder cancer risk (13,14).
To explore possible reasons for the excess incidence of blad-
der cancer in northern New England, we conducted a large, com-
prehensive, population-based case-control study in Maine, New
Hampshire, and Vermont. We examined the role of known and
suspected bladder cancer risk factors with a focus on private well
water consumption and arsenic levels in drinking water.
Methods
Study Population
As described elsewhere (15), case patients included all patients
with histologically confirmed carcinoma of the urinary bladder
(including carcinoma in situ) newly diagnosed between 2001
and 2004 among residents of Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont, age 30 to 79 years. Patients were ascertained through
hospital pathology departments and hospital and state cancer
registries.
We interviewed 1213 bladder cancer patients (64.6% of 1878
eligible). The median time from diagnosis to interview was 5.9
months. Based on a review of diagnostic slides by the study’s
expert pathologist (AS) (16), 20 case patients with no evidence of

 bladder cancer were excluded. We also excluded 44 case
patients with missing information on arsenic exposure and 70
nonwhite case patients because only about 5% of the population
in these states is nonwhite and the excess risk in the region is
apparent only in whites (1); 1079 case patients remained.
Control
subjects
were
selected
randomly
from
state
Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) records (age 30-64 years)
and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) benefi-
ciary records (age 65-79 years), frequency matched to case
patients by state, sex, and five-year age group at diagnosis. We
interviewed 1418 (594 DMV, 824 CMS) control subjects (64.8% of
eligible DMV and 64.7% of eligible CMS control subjects). We ex-
cluded 47 control subjects missing information on arsenic expo-
sure and 84 nonwhite control subjects; 1287 control subjects
remained.
All participants gave written consent. The study protocol
was approved by the institutional review boards of the National
Cancer Institute, the US Geological Survey, Westat, Inc., Geisel
School of Medicine at Dartmouth, and the departments of
health for the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
Interviewed case patients and control subjects were compa-
rable with respect to age at diagnosis/interview, sex, state, and
race/ethnicity (Supplementary Table 1, available online).
Risk Factors
Information on ancestry, smoking, occupation, and use of
wood-burning stoves was obtained by in-person interview.
Shellfish and bracken fern intakes were assessed through a self-
administered dietary history questionnaire (17) on usual adult
diet over the five years preceding the interview. We queried par-
ticipants about the amount of water they had typically con-
sumed over their lifetime, including water alone and water
from beverages and foods made with water, and used this infor-
mation to calculate their total water intake (L/day), hereafter re-
ferred to as “drinking water” intake. The lifetime arsenic
exposure
assessment
is
described
in
the
Supplementary
Material (available online). We focus here on four arsenic expo-
sure metrics: 1) average drinking water arsenic concentration
(mg/L), calculated by summing the concentration for each year
and dividing by the number of years with an assigned arsenic
value; 2) average daily arsenic intake (mg/day), calculated by
multiplying the average concentration by the drinking water in-
take (L/day); 3) cumulative intake (mg), calculated by multiply-
ing the average daily intake by the number of days with an
assigned arsenic level; and 4) number of years drinking from a
source containing more than 10 lg/L arsenic (current regulatory
limit). We were able to assign an arsenic level for at least 85% of
the lifetime exposure-years for 88.2% of the case patients and
89.5% of the control subjects.
Statistical Analysis
We computed odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for each risk factor using unconditional logistic regression
models, adjusting for age, sex, Hispanic ethnicity, state of resi-
dence, smoking, education, employment in a high-risk occupa-
tion (18), and exposure to disinfection byproducts (represented
by total trihalomethanes [THMs]) (19), which are possible blad-
der carcinogens that occur only in chlorinated public water sup-
plies (20). For arsenic metrics 1-3, we also conducted analyses
lagged 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 years (Supplementary Table 2,
available online). The Odds ratios peaked with a 40-year lag,
and thus we also present results lagged 40 years.
To test for linear trend, we used the Wald test, treating the
median value for each category among control subjects as con-
tinuous. To test for heterogeneity between trends, we included
an interaction term in the model and conducted a likelihood ra-
tio
test
of
the
statistical
significance
of
the
interaction.
Statistical tests were two-sided, with type I error a of .05.
We computed population-attributable risks (PARs) using the
method of Bruzzi et al. (21) and their two-sided 95% confidence
intervals by the method of Benichou and Gail (22). The PARs
were adjusted for the same potential confounding variables as
the odds ratios.
Results
Of the known and suspected factors that are unrelated to drink-
ing water (Table 1), statistically significantly increased risk was
observed
only
for
smoking
and
occupation,
both
well-
established bladder cancer risk factors (5). The PARs for smoking
(men: 55.4%, women: 50.8%) were comparable with those ob-
served in a recent nationwide cohort study (men: 50%, women:
52%) (23). The PARs for high-risk occupation (men: 26.2%,
women: 13.7%) were also consistent with previous studies in-
cluding a national, population-based case-control study (men:
21-25%, women: 11%) (5,24,25). Because the PARs for these risk
factors were similar to those observed elsewhere in the country,
neither is likely to have played an important role in the New
England bladder cancer excess.
We observed a statistically significant trend in risk with
increasing drinking water intake (L/day) from all sources
(Ptrend ¼ .003) (Table 2). Compared with participants in the low-
est quartile (�1.1 L/day), the odds ratios were 1.07 (95% CI ¼ 0.83
to 1.38), 1.17 (95% CI ¼ 0.91 to 1.50), 1.22 (95% CI ¼ 0.94 to 1.59),
and 1.86 (95% CI ¼ 1.23 to 2.81) for water intake categories corre-
sponding to the 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles among
control subjects, respectively.
Because of the high prevalence of private well use in north-
ern New England (46.0% among control subjects in this study
compared with 15% in the total US [26]), we examined the asso-
ciation between water intake and bladder cancer risk according
to whether subjects ever used private wells as their primary
drinking water source (Table 2). The trend in risk with water
intake was statistically significant among private well users
(Ptrend ¼ .01) despite the absence of an increased risk among
those who had ever used a private well compared with those
who had never used a private well (OR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI ¼ 0.72 to
1.09) (data not shown). Duration of private well use was not as-
sociated with risk (data not shown). Among those who never
used private wells, no trend was apparent although risk was el-
evated in the highest water intake category (OR ¼ 1.94, 95%
CI ¼ 0.76 to 4.98) (Table 2).
We further examined the association with water intake by
type of private well, both in subjects whose private well use was
limited to dug wells and subjects whose private well use was
limited to drilled wells. We found a strong, statistically signifi-
cant trend in risk with increasing water intake with exclusive
use of dug wells (Ptrend ¼ .002), with a quadrupling of risk in the
highest water intake category (OR ¼ 4.01, 95% CI ¼ 1.06 to 15.14)
(Table 2). No trend with water intake was present among those
with exclusive use of drilled wells (P ¼ .48) although heavy wa-
ter drinkers had a statistically marginally significant doubling
of risk. The trends in water intake among exclusive dug well

 users compared with exclusive drilled well users were statisti-
cally significantly different (Pheterogeneity ¼ .01). Among heavy
water drinkers (>2.2 L/day), the odds ratio for exclusive use of a
dug well was 1.87 (95% CI ¼ 1.05 to 3.33) (data not shown).
We explored the potential influence on risk of arsenical pes-
ticide use as a possible source of arsenic contamination of dug
wells in this region during the past century (11). Although infor-
mation on historical arsenical pesticide application rates in
New England is limited, reports indicate that use was highest
between 1920 and 1960 (Figure 2) (11). Among those who used
dug wells before 1960, we observed a statistically significant
trend in risk with increasing water intake (Ptrend ¼ .01), with a
two-fold risk if consumption exceeded 2.2 L/day (Table 2). No as-
sociation was apparent among subjects using dug wells only af-
ter 1960 (Ptrend ¼ .15). We then developed a crude proxy for
exposure to arsenical pesticides using information on historic
(1935-1977) acreage planted with blueberries, apples, and pota-
toes in New England by census tract (27), census tract locations
of participants’ past residences, and number of years of
pre-1960 dug well use by home (see Supplementary Material).
We observed no effect of water intake among participants in
the lowest quartile of cumulative acres per square mile (0-6.1),
but a statistically significant trend in risk with increasing water
intake was apparent among subjects above the lowest quartile
(>6.1 acres per square mile, Ptrend ¼ .004), with water intake
odds ratios of 1.00, 1.08 (95% CI ¼ 0.56 to 2.07), 1.53 (95% CI ¼ 0.76
to 3.06), and 2.30 (95% CI ¼ 1.20 to 4.40) (Supplementary Table 3,
available online).
Table 3 shows the bladder cancer risk associated with the
primary
arsenic
exposure
metrics.
For
lifetime
exposure
unlagged, no evidence of an association with average arsenic
concentration in drinking water was apparent. Risk increased
slightly, but was not statistically significant, with increasing av-
erage daily and cumulative arsenic intakes unlagged, with a
50% to 60% increased risk among subjects in the 97.5% percen-
tile of each metric. Lagging exposure 40 years yielded stronger
associations for all three metrics. For average arsenic concen-
tration, the odds ratio was 1.49 (95% CI ¼ 0.85 to 2.61) in the

 highest exposure category (>8.7 lg/L), with no trend in risk with
increasing exposure. For average daily and cumulative arsenic
intakes lagged 40 years, trends with increasing exposure were
statistically significant (Ptrend ¼ .01 and .004, respectively). For
the latter, the highest-exposed participants (>124.8 mg) had
twice the risk of those in the lowest-exposure quartile (<3.5 mg)
(OR ¼ 2.24, 95% CI ¼ 1.29 to 3.89). Restricting these analyses to
participants with greater than 85% coverage had little impact on
risk estimates. The PAR for cumulative arsenic intake above the
lowest quartile, lagged 40 years, was 13.8% (95%CI ¼ 0 to 29.2%).
For those drinking from a source containing more than 10 lg/L
for 40 years or more, we observed a modestly increased risk
(OR ¼ 1.47, 95% CI ¼ 0.50 to 4.26) based on small numbers (8 case
patients, 7 control subjects), with no evidence of a trend for
duration (Table 3). Our evaluation of additional arsenic expo-
sure metrics, including limiting exposure to current homes with
measured values and maximum level of exposure, did not sug-
gest increased risk. We observed no pattern of risk by tumor
stage and grade for any exposure metric (data not shown).
Discussion
The primary purpose of our study was to identify the factors re-
sponsible for the elevated incidence of bladder cancer in north-
ern New England. We examined several a priori suspect
exposures including arsenic in drinking water, smoking, occu-
pation, French/Canadian ancestry, shellfish and bracken fern

 consumption, and use of wood-burning stoves. Factors unre-
lated to drinking water do not appear to have played an impor-
tant role because they were either not associated with risk or
the PARs (ie, smoking and occupation) were similar to those in
national studies. We observed a trend in risk with increasing
daily water intake, suggesting the possible presence of a bladder
carcinogen in the drinking water. We explored whether this
trend might be attributable to arsenic in private wells, which
are highly prevalent in the region. We observed a strong associ-
ation with water intake among participants who derived all of
their private well water from dug wells and among those who
used dug wells before 1960. This is noteworthy as arsenical pes-
ticides were widely used in this region during the first half of
the 20th century (Figure 2) and dug wells were potentially vul-
nerable to contamination from arsenic leaching from the
treated soils (28). That the water intake/bladder cancer associa-
tion was most pronounced among people who drank from dug
wells during the period of heavy arsenical pesticide use and ab-
sent in areas with lowest use points to arsenic as a possible link
between water intake and bladder cancer risk.
We observed statistically significant and consistent trends
in risk with average daily arsenic intake and cumulative arsenic
intake, lagged 40 years. Four previous studies have suggested an
association between low-to-moderate arsenic exposure and
bladder cancer risk (13,14,29,30). To our knowledge, this is
the first large-scale study to report a statistically significant
exposure-response relationship for arsenic in drinking water
and bladder cancer in a low to moderately exposed population.
Our 40-year lag period for cumulative arsenic is remarkably con-
sistent with the observed elevated risk among heavily-exposed
subjects in Chile who ceased arsenic exposure more than 40
years before diagnosis (31,32). Such Chileans experienced a
seven-fold risk compared with those with little or no exposure.
In our study, average arsenic concentration lagged 40 years ap-
peared unrelated to risk, although those with exposures in the
top 97.5th percentile experienced a 50% elevated risk. The con-
trast in our findings for cumulative arsenic intake and average
arsenic concentration underscores the importance of incorpo-
rating water intake when estimating an individual’s total arse-
nic exposure in low to moderately exposed populations such as
that in northern New England.
Arsenic levels in drinking water were estimated based on an
extensive exposure assessment effort involving drinking water
sampling and statistical modeling (33). Despite our best efforts,
estimates were accompanied by substantial uncertainty due, in
part, to the large spatial variability of arsenic in groundwater
over short distances (33) and our limited ability to account for
potentially important temporal variability. For example, the
overall agreement between a dichotomous classification of 2 or
fewer or more than 2 mg/L arsenic in over 1400 drilled wells
based on predicted and observed values in our study did not ex-
ceed 60%, and the specificity and sensitivity were only 57% and
77%, respectively (33). These uncertainties can lead to nondiffer-
ential exposure misclassification and an underestimation of
risk (34). Importantly, our exposure assessment was unable to
account accurately for the potential effect of historical arsenical
pesticide use on arsenic levels in dug wells. To our knowledge,
no data are available on arsenic levels in dug wells over 50 years
ago, and prediction modeling is difficult because of uncertain-
ties related to changes in land use, pesticide application rates,
and the complex mechanisms governing arsenic fate and trans-
port. Although applied arsenic has been shown to be adsorbed
strongly in the soil (35), excess arsenic could have been trans-
ported to the water table if the sorption capacity of the soil was
exceeded because of pH changes and anoxic conditions associ-
ated with agricultural practices (36–40).
It is noteworthy that the longstanding excess bladder cancer
mortality rates in this region date back to the 1950s or earlier
(Figure 1), when arsenical pesticides were still widely used and
dug
wells
were
commonplace
(11).

 northern New England have changed markedly over the past
century. Although deep-drilled wells now far outnumber dug
wells, the reverse was true during the first half of the 20th cen-
tury (Figure 2). If ingestion of arsenic-contaminated water from
dug wells during this time period was indeed causing bladder
cancer, given the widespread use of private wells in this area
relative to the rest of the country, this may have contributed to
the historical bladder cancer excess in this region.
Ingestion of water from drilled wells containing low-to-
moderate (and sometimes high) levels of predominantly natu-
rally occurring arsenic originating from minerals in the bedrock
may have also contributed to the bladder cancer excess. Heavy
consumers of water who drew all of their private well water
from drilled wells experienced a doubling of risk, with no clear
trend in risk with increasing water intake. Recent sampling
demonstrates that drilled wells currently are the predominant
source of elevated arsenic in this region’s drinking water sup-
plies (9,33,39); future research should focus on the health effects
of the low-to-moderate levels found in these wells.
It is possible that a historical drinking water contaminant
other than, or in interaction with, arsenic explains the asso-
ciations observed here. We measured levels of two other sus-
pect bladder carcinogens, nitrate and gross alpha emissions,
in private wells of current homes and found that more than

 50% were undetectable. Among those with detectable levels,
concentrations were similar in case patients and control sub-
jects, providing no evidence of increased risk for either con-
taminant. Thus, arsenic appears to be the only recognized
bladder carcinogen (5) known to be present in the well water
of northern New England (9).
The most important limitation of our study is the impreci-
sion of the arsenic exposure assessment, hampering our ability
to detect an effect for average arsenic concentration in our
study population and, thus, to accurately quantify the contribu-
tion of arsenic exposure to the New England bladder cancer ex-
cess. Therefore, we believe our PAR estimate of 13.8% for
cumulative arsenic lagged 40 years is likely to be an underesti-
mate because nondifferential misclassification of exposure re-
sults in underestimation of risk. In addition, our data on water
intake and the proportion from the home tap are self-reported
and recall bias is a concern in case-control studies. To address
this concern, we queried subjects regarding whether they made
a major change in their total water intake during their adult life.
When we excluded subjects reporting any major change in wa-
ter intake, the odds ratios by water intake were not affected
(ORs ¼ 1.00, 1.25, 1.31, 1.32, and 2.27 for water intakes of � 1.1,
>1.1-1.5, >1.5-2.2, >2.2-3.8, and >3.8 L/day, respectively), sug-
gesting that recall bias is not a major concern. Additionally, we
asked subjects if they were aware of any news reports of health
risks that may be related to drinking water containing arsenic.
The trend in risk with increasing water intake was stronger
among subjects who reported no knowledge that drinking water
could be injurious to health (unaware ¼ 1.00, 0.89, 1.37, 1.39, and
2.18; aware ¼ 1.00, 1.29, 1.02, 1.13, and 1.56 for water intakes
of � 1.1, >1.1-1.5, >1.5-2.2, >2.2-3.8, and >3.8 L/day, respec-
tively). If recall bias was seriously impacting our findings, it is
unlikely that unaware subjects would have a more pronounced
water intake effect than aware subjects. Lastly, our response
rate of 65% in both case patients and control subjects raises the
question of whether selection bias could have threatened the
generalizability of our findings. To address this concern, we
compared respondents and nonrespondents with respect to the
opportunity for exposure based on current residence at the time
of the interview among subjects age 30 to 64 years (we did not
have comparable data for the older control subjects). This com-
parison was based on the percent of subjects with a current res-
idence outside a designated census place, which is typically a
town boundary and is directly related to having a private well.
For case patients, 58.7% of respondents and 62.0% of nonres-
pondents lived outside a designated census place and were thus
likely to be private well users. For control subjects, 64.8% of re-
spondents and 60.1% of nonrespondents lived outside a desig-
nated census place. The similarity between respondents and
nonrespondents provides evidence that selection bias is likely
not a serious concern in this study and that our findings are
likely generalizable to the general populations of Maine, New
Hampshire, and Vermont.
To our knowledge, our study is the largest case-control study
to date to evaluate bladder cancer risk associated with exposure
to low-to-moderate levels of arsenic. Additional strengths are
the population-based design and use of histologically confirmed
incident bladder cancer case patients. Risk estimates were con-
trolled for confounding by smoking and other bladder cancer
risk factors, including exposure to THMs from drinking water.
In our large, population-based case-control study, we ob-
served an association between lifetime cumulative arsenic ex-
posure from drinking water and bladder cancer risk in New
England. In addition, historical consumption of water from
private wells, particularly from dug wells, was associated with
increased bladder cancer risk and may have contributed to the
longstanding bladder cancer excess in northern New England.
Although challenges in estimation of historical arsenic levels in
private wells precluded us from definitively indicting or exoner-
ating arsenic as the responsible agent, our findings are consis-
tent with a potential role for the widespread application of
arsenical pesticides in agricultural areas of the region during
the first half of the 20th century. Although the likelihood of ex-
posure from dug wells has diminished in recent years because
arsenical pesticides are no longer used and dug wells are rarely
used, possible current exposure to arsenic in drinking water
through use of deep domestic-supply wells drilled into fractured
bedrock is a potential public health concern.
