FOREWORD 
 
Malaria is noteworthy for the burden it places on both individuals and families. In Uganda, the 
illness exacts a high economic toll from the losses in productivity that result from ill-health and death. 
For the past five years, major interventions have been undertaken as a part of the country’s 
strategic planning effort to help bring malaria under control in Uganda. The Ministry of Health, in 
partnership with many of the stakeholders in the fight against malaria, has intensified efforts to increase 
access to and use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), which are more durable and cost-effective than 
untreated nets. The first line of treatment for malaria has shifted from largely ineffective antimalarial 
drugs to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are more efficacious and cost-effective. 
The home-based management of fever is a strategy that was rolled out nationwide, although its impact has 
suffered from having an inadequate supply of ACTs for treatment at the community level. Indoor residual 
spraying (IRS) of the walls of houses with insecticide has been implemented in selected districts in 
northern Uganda, and many individuals have chosen to spray their own homes. 
Despite these many efforts to combat malaria over the years, the Ministry of Health has 
previously never conducted a comprehensive survey to measure the extent of treatment efforts on 
morbidity and mortality. The 2009 Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey (UMIS) is the first nationally 
representative survey of malaria in Uganda, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to repeat this survey 
every two to three years. Another key source of information about malaria indicators is the Uganda 
Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS), last conducted in 2006 and now conducted every five years. 
This report presents national and regional estimates of a range of malaria indicators and thus 
provides a robust and comprehensive picture of malaria control in Uganda. It captures both biological and 
behavioural information relevant to malaria and will provide a useful reference tool and evidence base for 
national policy decision making. Both the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) and all 
stakeholders will know where to focus their efforts in designing interventions for malaria control. 
Although this report shows that the country has made significant strides in improving strategies 
designed to control malaria, many challenges remain if Uganda is to attain its 2010 Abuja targets in 
prevention and treatment. This report is a call to action as we seek to expand our efforts to control and to 
eventually eliminate malaria from Uganda.

 Summary of Findings  |  xvii 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
 
The 2009 UMIS was carried out between 
November 4, 2009 and December 24, 2009, using 
a nationally representative sample of 4,760 
households. All women age 15-49 years in these 
households were eligible to be individually 
interviewed and were asked questions about the 
prevention of malaria during pregnancy and the 
treatment of childhood fevers. In addition, the 
survey included testing for anaemia and malaria 
among children age 0-59 months. Using a finger 
(or heel) prick blood sample, results from anaemia 
and malaria testing were available immediately 
and were provided to the children’s parents or 
guardians. Thick and thin smears were also 
prepared in the field and taken to the Uganda 
Malaria 
Surveillance 
Project 
Molecular 
Laboratory in Kampala for microscopy. 
The 2009 UMIS was designed to provide data 
to monitor all key malaria indicators in Uganda. 
Specifically, the UMIS collected information on 
ownership and use of mosquito bed nets, 
intermittent preventive drug treatment for pregnant 
women, timing and type of treatment for 
childhood fever, and prevalence of anaemia and 
malaria among children. 
BEDNET OWNERSHIP AND USE 
The survey showed a substantial increase in 
household ownership of mosquito bed nets. 
Overall, 59 percent of households in Uganda have 
at least one mosquito net (treated or untreated), 47 
percent have at least one insecticide-treated net 
(ITN), and 46 percent have at least one long-
lasting insecticidal net (LLIN). Compared with 
statistics for 2006, when 34 percent of households 
owned at least one mosquito net and only 16 
percent owned at least one ITN, ownership of 
mosquito nets has increased quite significantly. In 
Uganda, universal bednet coverage is defined as 
three ITNs per household. However, only 8 
percent of households have three or more ITNs, 
which falls far short of the 2010 target of 50 
percent. 
Only a third (33 percent) of children under age 
5 in all households were reported to have slept 
under an ITN the night before the survey (an 
increase from 10 percent in 2006), although the 
survey took place just after the height of the 
malaria transmission season. Thirty-three percent 
of all women reported that they slept under an ITN 
the night before the survey (an increase from 10 
percent in 2006), and 44 percent of pregnant 
women reported that they slept under an ITN (an 
increase from 10 percent in 2006). 
INTERMITTENT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT FOR 
PREGNANT WOMEN 
Women who had a live birth in the two years 
preceding the 2009 UMIS were asked if they had 
taken any drugs to prevent getting malaria during 
that pregnancy and, if they answered yes, which 
drug. Only 32 percent said they received IPT 
during the last pregnancy (compared with 16 
percent in 2006). 
TREATMENT OF CHILDHOOD FEVER 
Mothers were asked whether their children 
under age 5 had had a fever during the two weeks 
preceding the survey and, if so, whether the child 
was given any medicine and, if so, what kind. 
Survey results show that 45 percent of children 
under age 5 had a fever in the two weeks 
preceding the survey and among these children, 60 
percent took some type of antimalarial drug, 23 
percent took an artemisinin-combination therapy 
(ACT), and 19 percent took quinine. Fourteen 
percent received the recommended treatment of 
ACT within 24 hours of the onset of fever 
according to national treatment policy. Survey 
findings also show that 80 percent of households 
live within 5 km of a health facility, compared 
with 72 percent as stated in the HSSP-II. 
 xviii  |  Summary of Findings 
ANAEMIA IN CHILDREN 
Survey data show that anaemia is a significant 
public health problem in Uganda. Malaria 
accounts for a significant proportion of anaemia in 
children under age 5. Six out of ten Ugandan 
children 
under 
age 
5 
are 
anaemic 
(Hb 
concentration levels below 11 g/dl). Twenty-one 
percent are mildly anaemic, 30 percent are 
moderately anaemic, and 10 percent are severely 
anaemic. 
MALARIA PREVALENCE IN CHILDREN 
Malaria prevalence among children age 0-59 
months was measured in the 2009 UMIS in two 
ways. In the field, health technicians used the 
Paracheck Pf® rapid diagnostic blood test (RDT) 
to determine whether children had malaria. In 
addition, thin and thick smears from each child’s 
blood were made in the field and transported to the 
UMSP Molecular Laboratory for confirmatory 
microscopy testing. 
Using microscopy, 42 percent of children age 
0-59 months (45 percent of children age 6-59 
months) tested positive for malaria.

COUNTRY PROFILE 
The republic of Uganda is a small, landlocked East African country positioned between latitudes 
1° south and 4° north of the equator. It shares borders with Sudan in the north, Kenya in the east, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo in the west, and Tanzania and Rwanda in the south (see map). Owing to 
its relatively high altitude (1,300-1,500 metres above sea level), it experiences a favourable tropical 
climate, with mean annual temperatures between 16°C in the southwest; 25°C in the centre, east, and 
northwest; and close to 30°C in the northeast. Uganda experiences two peaks of rainfall, from March to 
May and from September to December. Vegetation is varied, with tropical rain forests in the south and 
savannah woodland and semi-desert conditions in the north (UBOS, 2001). 
The country covers an area of about 241,039 square kilometres and is divided into 80 districts.1 
Power is decentralized at the local government level within the districts. The central government, 
however, sets policy and supervises standards. 
The public sector, private not-for-profit sector, and private for-profit sector comprise the formal 
health care system. There is a fairly large informal health care sector, including traditional medicine 
providers, medicine vendors and shops, and complementary and alternative practitioners. The public 
health facility sector ranges from large referral hospitals serving about 2,000,000 people to parish-level 
health centres that provide basic preventive and curative health services for approximately 5,000 people. 
Also included in the public sector are community health centres. These centres provide mobile health 
services through volunteers who are increasingly organized to form village health teams and often include 
community medicine distributors (CMDs). Selected development indicators for Uganda are provided in

BACKGROUND ON MALARIA IN UGANDA 
1.2.1 
Malaria Transmission 
Malaria remains one of the most important diseases in Uganda, causing significant morbidity, 
mortality, and economic loss. Children under age 5 and pregnant women are disproportionately affected. 
Hospital records suggest that malaria is responsible for 30 to 50 percent of outpatient visits, 15 to 20 
percent of admissions, and 9 to 14 percent of inpatient deaths. According to the 2008 World Malaria 
                                                 
1 There were 80 districts at the time of designing and collecting data for the 2009 UMIS. Currently there are 112 
districts in Uganda. 
 2  |  Introduction 
Report, Uganda ranks 6th worldwide in number of malaria cases and 3rd in number of malaria deaths 
(World Health Organization, 2008). The overall malaria-specific mortality is estimated to be between 
70,000 and 100,000 child deaths annually in Uganda, a death toll that far exceeds that for HIV/AIDS 
(Lynch et al., 2005). 
Uganda has stable, perennial malaria transmission in 90 to 95 percent of the country. In the rest of 
the country, particularly in the highland areas, there is low and unstable transmission, with potential for 
epidemics. The areas of stable transmission are divided into 3 epidemiological zones: 
1. Areas of very high transmission levels with more than 100 infective bites per person per year 
(70 percent of the country) 
2. Areas with medium to high transmission levels with 10-100 infective bites per person per 
year (20 percent of the country) 
3. Areas of low transmission with fewer than 10 infective bites per person per year (10 percent 
of the country) (Figure 1.1). 
Areas of unstable transmission (very low or no malaria) include the southwest area of the country, 
Mt. Rwenzori in the west and Mt. Elgon in the east, and areas with altitudes above 1,800 metres.

Although transmission is largely stable, there is some seasonal variation associated with the rainy 
seasons in different geographic areas of Uganda. Malaria transmission levels are highest following the 
rainy seasons. 
 Introduction  |  3 
All four human Plasmodia species coexist in Uganda; however, P. falciparum is by far the most 
common, responsible for 90 to 98 percent of diagnosed cases, and the most common cause of severe 
malaria. P. malariae contributes to about 1 to 3 percent of all malaria cases. 
The most common malaria vectors in Uganda include members of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and A. 
funestus, species that are known to be endophagic and endophilic, that is, they bite and rest indoors. These 
malaria vectors are able to breed in very small pools of water such as cattle hoof prints. 
1.2.2 
Malaria Policy 
The Uganda government, through the Uganda National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), which 
was started in 1995, is implementing the Uganda Malaria Control Strategic Plan (UMCSP) 2005/06-
2009/10. This plan details national prevention and control strategies that include: 
• 
Use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) 
• 
Indoor residual spraying (IRS) 
• 
Environmental management (where feasible and effective) 
• 
Uncomplicated malaria case management with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) 
at the community level and in health units (with emphasis on improved diagnosis and 
management of severe malaria) 
• 
Treatment and prevention of malaria during pregnancy, including intermittent preventive 
treatment (IPT) 
• 
Early detection and response to malaria epidemics 
Major national prevention activities include distribution of LLINs, IRS, and changes to the 
recommended diagnostic and treatment regimes. About 6 million LLINs had been distributed before the 
Uganda malaria indicator survey data collection. National IRS coverage has focused on epidemic-prone 
areas, including geographically vulnerable populations and those in internally displaced persons camps in 
the north. In 2006, the Ugandan government rolled out a new case management policy in which the 
recommended first line of treatment was changed from chloroquine plus Fansidar (CQ + SP) to 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which was deemed more efficacious and cost-effective. In 
addition, a home-based management of fever (HBMF) strategy was rolled out nationwide. Unfortunately, 
the sustainability of HBMF suffered due to inadequate ACT supplies at the community level following 
the suspension of the Global Fund grant for Round 4 Phase II. 
1.2.3 
Sources of Malaria Data in Uganda 
Malaria case reporting 
Routine morbidity case reports through the Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) 
represent the main source of malaria data in Uganda. According to these reports, there were 11.7 million 
outpatient cases of malaria in 2008 alone.2 However, given that HMIS in the country rely solely on the 
public sector and NGO health facilities for malaria morbidity and mortality data, the above figures most 
likely represent a gross underestimation of the burden of malaria in Uganda. With recent estimates 
                                                 
2 The majority of these reported cases of malaria are not laboratory confirmed. 
 4  |  Introduction 
specifying that 60 to 80 percent of fever cases are treated in the informal and private sector, the true 
burden of malaria in Uganda likely approximates 60 million cases annually. 
Malaria surveillance project 
Through a collaborative project that involved the government of Uganda; Makerere University, 
Kampala; and the University of California, San Francisco, malaria sentinel sites were established at health 
facilities in Uganda and have been operational since 1998. Although these sites were traditionally used to 
monitor antimalarial drug resistance, the focus in the recent past has shifted to measure other malaria 
indicators. Indicators collected include monthly outpatient malaria morbidity; laboratory-confirmed cases 
of malaria based on positive smears and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); parasite densities; and antimalarial 
drug usage. Currently, six sites are operational, and a pilot inpatient surveillance site, which will also 
capture mortality data, has been started. 
Demographic and Health Surveys 
Population-based Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS surveys) complement facility-based 
malaria data sources by providing strategic information to guide programmes. These surveys are based on 
nationally representative household samples that give national and sub-national estimates of a range of 
demographic and health indicators. In Uganda, four DHS surveys were conducted in 1988-89, 1995, 
2000-01, and 2006. These surveys provide important data on malaria, including information on household 
ownership and use of mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying, intermittent preventive treatment for 
pregnant women, and treatment of childhood fever. 
1.3 
OBJECTIVES OF THE UGANDA MALARIA INDICATOR SURVEY 
Since 1995, the NMCP and its partners have been scaling up malaria interventions in all parts of 
the country. To determine the progress made in malaria control and prevention in Uganda, the 2009 
Uganda Malaria Indicator Survey (UMIS) was designed to provide data on key malaria indicators, 
including mosquito net ownership and use, as well as prompt treatment using ACT.  
The key objectives of the 2009 UMIS were to: 
• 
Measure the extent of ownership and use of mosquito bed nets 
• 
Assess coverage of the intermittent preventive treatment programme for pregnant women 
• 
Identify practices used to treat malaria among children under age 5 and the use of specific 
antimalarial medications 
• 
Measure the prevalence of malaria and anaemia among children age 0-59 months 
• 
Determine the species of plasmodium parasite most prevalent in Uganda 
• 
Assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding malaria in the general population 
1.4 
METHODOLOGY OF THE UGANDA MALARIA INDICATOR SURVEY 
The 2009 UMIS was carried out during November and December 2009, using a nationally 
representative sample of 4,760 households in 170 census enumeration areas. All women age 15-49 years 
in these households were eligible for individual interviews, during which they were asked questions about 
malaria prevention during pregnancy and treatment of childhood fevers. In addition, the survey included 
testing for anaemia and malaria among children age 0-59 months using finger (or heel) prick blood 
samples. Test results for anaemia (using the HemoCue portable machine) and malaria (using malaria 
RDT) were available immediately and were provided to the children’s parents or guardians. Thick and 
thin blood smears were also made in the field and transported to the Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project 
 Introduction  |  5 
Molecular Laboratory at the Mulago Hospital in Kampala where they were tested for the presence of 
malaria parasites and where the species of plasmodium parasite was determined. 
1.4.1 
Survey Organization 
The 2009 UMIS was implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) and the Uganda 
Malaria Surveillance Project (UMSP) on behalf of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). 
UBOS was responsible for general administrative management of the survey, including overseeing the 
day-to-day operations, designing the survey, and processing the data. UBOS assisted NMCP in the design 
of the UMIS, especially in the area of sample design and selection. In this regard, they provided the 
necessary maps and lists of households in the selected sample points. NMCP took primary responsibility 
for organizing the Technical Working Group, developing the survey protocol, and ensuring its approval 
by the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology prior to the data collection. Also, NMCP 
helped UBOS recruit, train, and monitor field staff and provided the medicines to treat children who 
tested positive for malaria during the survey. 
The Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project (UMSP) Molecular Laboratory at the Mulago Hospital 
complex in Kampala trained field technicians and implemented the microscopic reading of the malaria 
slides to determine malaria parasite infection. 
Technical assistance was provided by ICF Macro. ICF Macro staff assisted with overall survey 
design, sample design, questionnaire design, field staff training, field work monitoring, collection of 
biomarkers (anaemia testing, rapid diagnostic testing for malaria, and making and reading blood smears), 
data processing, data analysis, and report preparation. 
Financial support for the survey was provided by the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) 
through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 
1.4.2 
Sample Design 
The 2009 UMIS survey was designed to provide national, regional, urban, and rural estimates of 
key malaria indicators. The sample was stratified into 9 survey regions of the country, plus Kampala. 
Each of the nine regions consisted of 8 to 10 contiguous administrative districts of Uganda that share 
similar languages and cultural characteristics. Kampala district, because it had a unique character as an 
entirely urban district and also was the capital city of Uganda, comprised a separate region. The 10 
regions contained the following districts: 
1. North East region: Kotido, Abim, Kaabong, Moroto, Nakapiripirit, Katakwi, Amuria, 
Bukedea, Soroti, Kumi, and Kaberamaido 
2. Mid Northern region: Gulu, Amuru, Kitgum, Pader, Apac, Oyam, Lira, Amolatar, and 
Dokolo 
3. West Nile region: Moyo, Adjumani, Yumbe, Arua, Koboko, Nyadri, and Nebbi  
4. Mid Western region: Masindi, Buliisa, Hoima, Kibaale, Bundibugyo, Kabarole, Kasese, 
Kyenjojo, and Kamwenge 
5. South Western region: Bushenyi, Rukungiri, Kanungu, Kabale, Kisoro, Mbarara, Ibanda, 
Isingiro, Kiruhura, and Ntungamo 
6. Mid- Eastern region: Kapchorwa, Bukwa, Mbale, Bududa, Manafwa, Tororo, Butaleja, 
Sironko, Pallisa, Budaka, and Busia  
 6  |  Introduction 
7. Central 1 region: Kalangala, Masaka, Mpigi, Rakai, Lyantonde, Sembabule, and Wakiso 
8. Central 2 region: Kayunga, Kiboga, Luwero, Nakaseke, Mubende, Mityana, Mukono, and 
Nakasongola 
9. East Central region: Jinja, Iganga, Namutumba, Kamuli, Kaliro, Bugiri, and Mayuge 
10. Kampala: Kampala 
The sample was not spread geographically in proportion to the population, but rather equally 
across the regions, with 17 sample points or clusters per region. As a result, the UMIS sample is not self-
weighting at the national level, and sample weighting factors have been applied to the survey records in 
order to bring them into proportion. 
The survey utilized a two-stage sample design. The first stage involved selecting sample points or 
clusters from a list of enumeration areas (EAs) covered in the 2002 Population Census. A total of 170 
clusters (26 urban and 144 rural) with probability proportional to size were selected. Several months prior 
to the main survey, a complete listing of all households in the 170 selected clusters was carried out. This 
provided a sampling frame from which households were then selected for the survey. The second stage of 
selection involved the systematic sampling of households from the list of households in each cluster. 
Twenty-eight households were selected in each cluster. 
All women age 15-49 years who were either permanent residents of the households in the sample 
or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed in the 
survey. All children age 0-59 months who were listed in the household were eligible for the anaemia and 
malaria testing component of the survey. 
1.4.3 
Questionnaires 
Two questionnaires were used in the UMIS: a Household Questionnaire and a Woman’s 
Questionnaire for all women age 15-49 in the selected households. Both instruments were based on the 
standard Malaria Indicator Survey Questionnaires developed by the Roll Back Malaria and DHS 
programmes. In consultation with the Technical Working Group, NMCP and ICF Macro staff modified 
the model questionnaires to reflect issues relevant to malaria in Uganda. The questionnaires were 
translated into the 6 major local languages commonly spoken in Uganda (Ateso-Karamojong, Luganda, 
Lugbara, Luo, Runyankore-Rukiga, and Runyoro-Rutoro). 
The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected 
households. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including 
age, sex, and relationship to the head of the household. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire 
was to identify women who are eligible for the individual interview and children who are age 0-59 
months for anaemia and malaria testing. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on 
characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water; type of toilet facilities; 
materials used for the floor, roof, and walls of the house; ownership of various durable goods; and 
ownership and use of mosquito nets. In addition, this questionnaire was used to record consent and results 
with regard to the anaemia and malaria testing of young children. 
The Woman’s Questionnaire was used to collect information from all women age 15-49 years 
and covered the following topics: 
• 
Background characteristics (age, residential history, education, literacy, and dialect) 
• 
Full reproductive history and child mortality 
• 
Antenatal care and preventive malaria treatment for most recent birth 
 Introduction  |  7 
• 
Prevalence and treatment of fever among children under age 5 
• 
Knowledge about malaria (causes, ways to avoid, types of medicines, and so on). 
The questionnaires and process of biomarker collection were pretested prior to the main data 
collection. The pretest involved 12 interviewers and 12 health technicians/nurses (2 for each of the 6 local 
languages into which the questionnaires were translated). The interviewers were trained for five days and 
collected data in the six languages for three days in areas close to Kampala. The purpose of the pretest 
was to assess the appropriateness of the wording of the questions as well as to verify the translations and 
skip patterns. 
1.4.4 
Anaemia and Malaria Testing 
The 2009 UMIS incorporated three biomarkers, which were collected through finger (or heel) 
prick blood samples from children age 0-59 months to perform on-the-spot testing for (1) anaemia and 
malaria and (2) to prepare thick and thin blood smears to be read in the laboratory to determine malaria 
parasitemia. Children age 0-5 months were included in the survey because previous studies in Uganda 
revealed malaria parasites in this group, but no national estimates of prevalence exist for reference. Each 
data collection team included two health technicians who implemented the malaria and anaemia testing 
and made the blood smear slides. Also on each team was one medically trained staff person (nurse or 
clinical officer) who ensured that medications for malaria were given in accordance with the appropriate 
treatment protocols. Verbal informed consent for testing of children was requested from the child’s parent 
or guardian at the end of the household interview. The protocol for the blood specimen collection and 
analysis was approved by ICF Macro’s Institutional Review Board as well as by the Uganda Virus 
Research Institute (UVRI), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Uganda National 
Council for Science and Technology (UNCST). 
Anaemia testing: Because of the strong correlation between malaria infection and anaemia, the 
UMIS included anaemia testing for children age 0-59 months. After obtaining informed consent from the 
child’s parent or guardian, blood samples were collected using a single-use, spring-loaded, sterile lancet 
to make a finger prick. Health technicians then collected blood on a microcuvette from the finger or heel 
prick. Haemoglobin analysis was carried out on site using a battery-operated portable HemoCue analyzer, 
which produces a result in less than one minute. Results were given to the child’s parent or guardian 
verbally and in written form. Those whose children had a haemoglobin level of under 8 g/dl were urged to 
take the child to a health facility for follow-up care and were given a referral letter with the haemoglobin 
reading to show staff at the health facility. Results of the anaemia test were recorded on the Household 
Questionnaire as well as in a brochure explaining the causes and prevention of anaemia that was left in 
the household. 
Malaria testing using rapid diagnostic testing (RDT): Another major objective of the UMIS 
was to provide information about the extent of malaria infection among children age 0-59 months. Using 
the same finger (or heel) prick used for anaemia testing, a drop of blood was tested immediately using the 
Paracheck Pf™ rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which tests for Plasmodium falciparum. The test includes a 
loop applicator that comes in a sterile packet. A tiny volume of blood is captured on the applicator and 
placed on the well of the device. Malaria RDTs (HRP2) have been available in various commercial 
formats for several years, have shown good sensitivity in a variety of field settings, and are increasingly 
advocated as a diagnostic test where reliable microscopy is not available. A potential problem for HRP2-
based assays is persistence of detectable circulating antigen for up to several weeks after parasites have 
been eradicated (Tjitra et al. 2001; Singh et al. 2002; Mayxay et al. 2001). This would result in 
overestimation of disease prevalence. 
All field technicians were trained to perform the RDT in the field according to manufacturers’ 
instructions. They read, interpreted, and recorded RDT results after 15 minutes. They recorded the RDT 
 8  |  Introduction 
results as either positive or negative, with faint test lines being considered positive. Test results were 
provided to the child’s parent/guardian in oral and written form and were recorded on the Household 
Questionnaire. 
Children who tested positive for malaria using the rapid diagnostic test were offered a full course 
of treatment according to standard procedures for treating malaria in Uganda, provided they were not 
currently on treatment and had not completed a full course of ACT during the preceding 2 weeks. To 
ascertain the correct dose, the medically trained staff on each team were instructed to ask about any 
medications the child might already be taking. They then provided the age-appropriate dose of ACT—
Coartem® (Artemether lumefantrine)—along with instructions on how to administer the medicine to the 
child.3, 4 
Malaria testing using blood smears: In addition to the RDT, thick and thin blood smears were 
made in the field from each child’s blood. Each of the two blood smear slides was given a bar code label, 
with a triplicate label attached to the Household Questionnaire on the line showing consent for that child. 
A fourth copy of the same bar code label was affixed to a Blood Sample Transmittal Form in order to 
track the blood samples from the field to the laboratory. The slides were dried in a dust-free environment 
and stored in slide boxes. Technicians fixed the thin smears in the field lab at the end of each day by 
dipping the slide in 100 percent methanol. The thick and thin slides were periodically collected in the 
field along with the completed questionnaires and transported to UBOS headquarters in Kampala for log 
in, after which they were taken to the UMSP Molecular Research Laboratory at Mulago Hospital in 
Kampala. Thick smears were first examined to determine malaria infection. Thin smears of all positive 
thick smears were then read to determine the species of plasmodium parasite. 
1.4.5 
Training 
Interviewers/Supervisors: UBOS recruited 59 interviewers and 18 nurses for a 2-week 
interviewer/supervisor training session, which took place from October 19-31, 2009, at the Africana Hotel 
in Kampala. Training consisted of a review of how to fill out the Household and Woman’s 
Questionnaires, mock interviews, and sessions covering tips on interviewing, how to locate selected 
households, and how to code interview results. Training also included 2 field practices. Two quizzes were 
administered to assess how well the participants understood what they were being trained on. Of the 59 
interviewer attendees in the interviewer/supervisor training, 17 were selected as team supervisors, 34 
were selected as interviewers, and the rest were held in reserve. Seventeen of the 18 nurses were selected 
as team nurses, and 1 was held in reserve. The nurses were also trained on informed consent procedures 
and malaria treatment. 
Laboratory field technicians: The NMCP Molecular Research Laboratory identified 39 
technicians who were trained for the anaemia and malaria testing. All technicians went through classroom 
training and practice and also attended three days of additional practice at the Mulago Hospital. The 
classroom training involved presentation, discussion, and actual testing for anaemia and malaria. Training 
for anaemia testing was done using HemoCue equipment, and Paracheck RDT was used for malaria 
testing. Technicians were also trained on the preparation of thick and thin smears, as well as how to fix 
the thin slides in the field and store and transfer the slides from the field to the lab. Finally, the technicians 
were taught how to administer the informed consent and report the results to the parent/caretaker of the 
child. Thirty-four of the 39 technicians were eventually selected for field work. 
                                                 
3 Dosage of the ACT during the survey was based on the age of the recipient. The proper dosage for a child under 3 
years of age is 1 tablet of Coartem® to be taken twice daily for three days, while the dosage for a child age 3-8 years 
is two tablets of Coartem® to be taken twice daily for three days. 
4 Children below 4 months of age who tested positive to the malaria RDT were referred to the nearest facility for 
treatment. 
 Introduction  |  9 
Joint training sessions: All trainees (interviewers, nurses, and laboratory technicians) received 
lectures on the epidemiology of malaria in Uganda and correct treatment protocols by a senior member of 
the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP). To simulate field work, all trainees participated in two 
field practice exercises in and around Kampala. Laboratory technicians, team supervisors, and the nurses 
on each team received more specific instructions on how to record children’s anaemia and malaria test 
results on the anaemia and malaria brochure meant to be left in every household in which children were 
tested. Team members learned how to complete the referral forms for any child with severe anaemia. 
1.4.6 
Fieldwork 
Seventeen teams were organized for the data collection, each consisting of one team supervisor, 
two interviewers, one nurse (or clinical officer), two field laboratory technicians, and one driver. Two 
senior staff from UBOS and one from NMCP were designated to be field coordinators and were each 
assigned a number of teams to monitor. 
Data collection for the UMIS started on schedule on November 4, 2009. Fieldwork was 
completed by all teams by December 24, 2009. However, one team had to revisit 1 cluster in Kampala 
region where there were some challenges in obtaining permission from the local government. This final 
cluster was completed in January 2010. 
1.4.7 
Laboratory Testing 
The blood slides for malaria were read at the UMSP Molecular Research Laboratory in Mulago 
Hospital. The purpose of the thick blood slides was to provide a ‘gold standard’ for malaria infection 
while that of the thin smear was to ascertain the type of parasite. 
The protocol for microscopy of the blood slides was as follows: thick and thin blood smears were 
stained with 2 percent Giemsa for 30 minutes. Thick blood smears were evaluated for the presence of 
parasites (asexual forms only) and gametocytes. Parasite and gametocyte densities were calculated from 
thick blood smears by counting the number of asexual parasites and gametocytes, respectively, per 200 
leukocytes (or per 500, if the count was less than 10 parasites or gametocytes per 200 leukocytes), 
assuming a leukocyte count of 8,000/μl. A thick blood smear was considered negative when the 
examination of times 100 high power fields did not reveal asexual parasites or gametocytes. For quality 
control, all slides were read by a second microscopist, and a third reviewer settled any discrepant 
readings. Of the 4,075 thick slides evaluated, there were only 176 (4.3 percent) discrepant readings that 
were settled by a third reviewer. The corresponding thin blood smears of all positive thick smears were 
evaluated to determine parasite species. 
1.4.8 
Data Processing 
The processing of the UMIS questionnaire data began soon after the fieldwork commenced. 
Completed questionnaires were returned periodically from the field to the UBOS office in Kampala, 
where they were coded by data processing personnel recruited and trained for this task. The data 
processing staff consisted of a supervisor from UBOS, a questionnaire administrator, data entry operators, 
and data editors, all of whom were trained by a MEASURE DHS data processing specialist. Data were 
entered using the CSPro computer package. All data were entered twice (100 percent verification). 
1.5 
RESPONSE RATES 
Table 1.2 shows response rates for the 2009 UMIS. Of the 4,760 households selected in the 
sample, 4,536 were found to be occupied at the time of the fieldwork. The shortfall is due to dwellings 
 10  |  Introduction 
that were found to be vacant or destroyed. Of the existing households, 4,421 were successfully 
interviewed, yielding a household response rate of 98 percent. 
In the households interviewed in the survey, a total of 4,312 eligible women were identified, of 
whom 4,134 were successfully interviewed, yielding a response rate of 96 percent. The household and 
women’s response rates were slightly lower in the urban than in the rural sample. The principal reason for 
non-response among eligible women was the failure to find them at home despite repeated visits to the 
household.

This chapter presents summary information on some socioeconomic characteristics of the 
households1 interviewed in the 2009 UMIS. The Household Questionnaire (Appendix E) included 
questions about age, sex, and relationship to the head of the household for all usual residents and visitors 
who spent the night preceding the interview. This method of data collection allows the analysis of the 
results for either the de jure (usual residents) or de facto (those who are there at the time of the survey) 
populations. The Household Questionnaire also obtained information on housing facilities (e.g., source of 
water supply and sanitation facilities) and household possessions. These latter items are used to create an 
index of relative wealth, which is described in this chapter. 
The information presented in this chapter is intended to facilitate interpretation of the key 
demographic, socioeconomic, and health indicators presented later in the report. It is also intended to 
assist in the assessment of the representativeness of the survey sample. 
2.1 
POPULATION BY AGE AND SEX 
Age and sex are important demographic variables and are the primary basis of demographic 
classification. Table 2.1 shows the reported distribution of the de facto household population in the 2009 
UMIS by five-year age groups, sex, and urban-rural residence.

1 For the purpose of the survey, a household is defined as a person or a group of persons, related or unrelated, who 
live together and share a common source of food. 
 12  |  Characteristics of Households 
The data show that almost 21,000 people were enumerated in the survey, with women 
constituting 51 percent of the population and men constituting 49 percent. The sex composition of the 
population does not show significant variation by urban-rural residence. The data further depict Uganda 
as a young population, with a large proportion of the population being in the younger age groups. The 
population under age 15 constitutes 52 percent of the total population, similar to 2006 UDHS estimates, 
and only 3 percent are 65 or older (Figure 2.1). There is an implausibly large drop-off between ages 10-14 
and 15-19, especially for females. Examination of the distribution by single year (Appendix C Table C.1) 
shows evidence that interviewers may have intentionally underestimated women’s ages to be younger 
than the age cut-off of 15 so as to make them ineligible for the individual interview; for example, whereas 
the number of boys age 14 and 15 enumerated in the household are identical (280 and 254), the number of 
girls age 14 is much higher than the number age 15 (337 and 212).

HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION 
Information 
on 
key 
aspects 
of 
the 
composition of households including the sex of the 
head of the household and the size of the household 
is presented in Table 2.2. These characteristics are 
important because they are associated with the 
welfare of a household. Female-headed households 
are, for example, typically poorer than male-headed 
households. Economic resources are often more 
limited in larger households. Moreover, where the 
size of the household is large, crowding can lead to 
health problems. 
Survey results show that households in 
Uganda 
are 
predominantly 
male-headed 
(70 
percent), a common feature in African countries. 
Nevertheless, three in ten households are headed by 
women, with the proportion of female–headed 
households just slightly higher in urban than in rural 
areas. 
The mean household size is 4.7 persons. This is only slightly lower than the figure of 5.0 obtained 
from the 2006 UDHS. The mean household size is larger in rural areas (4.9 persons) than in urban areas 
(3.8 persons). One-person, two-person, and three-person households are more likely to be found in urban 
areas than in rural areas; on the flip side, large households are more likely to be found in rural areas than 
in urban areas. This scenario is similar to what was reported in the 2006 UDHS. 
 
 
2.3 
HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENT 
The physical characteristics of the dwelling in which a household lives are important 
determinants of the health status of household members, especially children. They can also be indicators 
of the socioeconomic status of households. UMIS household respondents were asked a number of 
questions about their household environment, including questions on the source of drinking water; type of 
toilet facility, cooking fuel, flooring, roof, and walls; and the number of rooms in the dwelling used for 
sleeping as well as the number of sleeping spaces available in the household. The results are presented 
both in terms of households and of the de jure population. 
2.3.1 
Drinking Water 
Increasing access to improved drinking water is one of the Millennium Development Goals that 
Uganda, along with other nations worldwide, has adopted (United Nations General Assembly, 2001). 
Table 2.3 shows the percent distribution of households and of population by the source of the household’s 
drinking water. Sources that are likely to provide water suitable for drinking are identified as ‘improved 
sources’. They include a piped source within the dwelling or plot, public tap, tube well or borehole, 
protected well or spring, rainwater, and bottled water.2 It should be noted, however, that even if water is 
obtained from an improved source, it may be contaminated during transportation or storage. 
 
                                                     
 
2 The categorization into improved and non-improved sources follows that proposed by the WHO/UNICEF Joint 
Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (WHO and UNICEF, 2004).

 1 Bottled water is considered an improved source of drinking water.
 
 
 
Seventy percent of Ugandan households have an improved source of drinking water, very similar 
to the figure of 67 percent reported in the 2006 UDHS. Urban households (94 percent) are much more 
likely than rural households (66 percent) to use an improved source of drinking water (88 vs. 63 percent 
in 2006). By far the most common single source of drinking water is the borehole (34 percent of 
households). Results further show that about one-third of rural households obtain drinking water from 
non-improved sources, with up to 15 percent getting their drinking water from surface water (lakes and 
ponds, rivers and streams). Thus, exposure to preventable, waterborne illnesses such as intestinal worms, 
dysentery, and cholera is likely to be high in rural parts of Uganda. 
2.3.2 
Household Sanitation Facilities 
Households without proper sanitation facilities are more exposed to the risk of diseases like 
dysentery, diarrhoea, and typhoid fever than those with improved sanitation facilities. Table 2.4 presents 
data on type of toilet facilities used by the household. Only 3 of 10 Ugandan households use an improved 
toilet facility, while the remaining 7 use a non-improved facility, mostly covered pit latrines with no slab 
(43 percent). Eight percent of households either have no facility or use the bush, a slight improvement 
from the 12 percent reported in the 2006 UDHS.

consequently, the data are not comparable to the 2006 UDHS results.
 
  
 
 
2.3.3 
Housing Characteristics 
Table 2.5 presents information on a number of characteristics of the dwelling in which UMIS 
households live. These characteristics reflect the household’s socioeconomic situation. They also may 
influence environmental conditions—for example, in the case of the use of biomass fuels, exposure to 
indoor pollution—that have a direct bearing on the health and welfare of household members. 
Ninety percent of Ugandan households do not have electricity. Forty-five percent of households 
in urban areas have access to electricity, compared with only three percent of households in rural areas. 
This finding is similar to results of the 2006 UDHS when 42 percent of households in urban areas had 
electricity.

 Characteristics of Households  |  17 
Seventy-two percent of households live in dwellings with earth, sand, or dung floors, while 26 
percent live in dwellings with concrete or cement floors. Differences by urban-rural residence are large. 
Three-quarters of urban households have concrete or cement floors, while 82 percent of rural households 
have earthen floors. This information is important because flooring material used in dwellings is not only 
an indicator of household wealth status but is also often an indicator of the quality of the health 
environment in which the household lives. 
Almost two-thirds of households in Uganda live in dwellings with iron roofs, and the remaining 
one-third live in dwellings with thatched roofs. Not surprisingly, about 90 percent of urban households 
live in dwellings with iron roofs compared with 60 percent of rural households. 
With regard to the main wall material of the dwelling, 38 percent of households live in structures 
with mud walls, while 27 percent live in structures having walls made of burnt bricks with cement. Urban 
households are more likely to live in dwellings with walls made of burnt brick with cement. 
The number of rooms a household uses for sleeping is an indicator of socioeconomic level; it can 
also be used to assess crowding, which can facilitate the spread of disease. In the 2009 UMIS, household 
respondents were asked how many rooms were used for sleeping, regardless of whether they were 
bedrooms or not. Results show that 43 percent of households use only one room for sleeping, 30 percent 
use two rooms, and 26 percent use three or more rooms. These statistics are very similar to figures 
reported in the 2006 UDHS where 47 percent used one room, 29 percent used two rooms, and 23 percent 
used three or more rooms. Urban households are more likely than rural households to use only one room 
for sleeping (66 vs. 39 percent). In terms of sleeping spaces, 19 percent of households have one sleeping 
space, 33 percent have two, and 48 percent have three or more sleeping spaces. 
Table 2.5 also shows the distribution of households by the type of fuel used for cooking, which 
relates to air quality in the household. Seventy-seven percent of Ugandan households use wood for fuel, 
and 19 percent use charcoal. Six out of ten urban households use charcoal for cooking, while close to 90 
percent of rural households use wood. Overall, 96 percent of households use solid fuel3 for cooking. 
2.4 
HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS 
The availability of durable consumer goods is a good indicator of a household’s socioeconomic 
status. Moreover, particular goods have specific benefits. For instance, having access to a radio or a 
television exposes household members to mass media and messages; a refrigerator prolongs the 
wholesomeness of foods; and a means of transport allows greater access to many services that may be 
unavailable locally. Table 2.6 shows the availability of selected consumer goods by residence. 
                                                     
 
3 Solid fuel includes charcoal, wood (firewood), straw, shrubs, grass, and animal dung.

Sixty-eight percent of households have a radio, an improvement from 61 percent in the 2006 
UDHS. Forty-four percent of households have a mobile phone, but only 9 percent have a television. There 
is noticeable urban-rural variation in the proportion of households owning these durable goods, and this is 
important to highlight since these are key channels for communicating messages about malaria. 
Comparison with the 2006 UDHS shows mostly minor differences in the proportion of 
households owning these various possessions. One exception, however, is mobile phone ownership. The 
proportion of households with a mobile phone has increased from 16 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 
2009. Ownership of mobile phones has increased in both rural areas and urban areas, rising from 53 to 79 
percent of households in urban areas and from 10 to 37 percent of rural households. 
2.5 
WEALTH INDEX 
The wealth index is a background characteristic that is used throughout this report as a proxy for 
long-term standard of living of the household. It is calculated using data on the household’s ownership of 
consumer goods, dwelling characteristics, source of drinking water, sanitation facilities, and other 
characteristics that relate to a household’s socioeconomic status. To construct the index, each of these 
assets was assigned a weight (factor score) generated through principal component analysis, and the 
resulting asset scores were standardized in relation to a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero 
and standard deviation of one (Gwatkin et al., 2000). Each household was then assigned a score for each 
 Characteristics of Households  |  19 
asset, and the scores were summed for each household. Individuals were ranked according to the total 
score of the household in which they resided. The sample was then divided into quintiles from one 
(lowest) to five (highest). A single asset index was developed on the basis of data from the entire country 
sample, and this index is used in all of the tabulations presented. 
Table 2.7 shows the distribution of the de jure household population into five wealth levels 
(quintiles) based on the wealth index by urban-rural residence as well as by region. These distributions 
indicate the degree to which wealth is evenly (or unevenly) distributed by geographic areas. 
The table shows that urban respondents and those in Kampala are much more likely to fall in the 
higher wealth quintiles. Only 2 percent of the urban population falls in the lowest wealth quintile, 
compared with 23 percent of the rural population. Similarly, none of the residents in Kampala fall into the 
poorest quintile, while almost nine of every ten persons in Kampala (87 percent) fall in the highest 
quintile. These statistics are very similar to figures reported in the 2006 UDHS. 
Also included in Table 2.7 is the Gini Coefficient, which indicated the level of concentration of 
wealth. A low Gini coefficient indicates a more equal distribution (0 being total equality), while a higher 
Gini coefficient indicates more unequal distribution (100 corresponds to total unequal distribution). 
Survey results show that wealth is relatively more evenly distributed in urban areas (21 percent) than in 
rural areas (32 percent). The results also show that wealth is most evenly distributed in Kampala (8 
percent) and least evenly distributed in East Central (33 percent), West Nile (34 percent), and North East 
(47 percent) regions.

NEAREST HEALTH FACILITY AND NEAREST MARKET 
The government of Uganda defines access to health facilities as having a health facility within 
five kilometres. The 2009 UMIS collected information on the distance to the nearest health facilities. 
Table 2.8 shows that 80 percent of households reported that a health facility was within five kilometres of 
their household or community, compared with 72 percent of households as reported in the HSSP-II. The 
distances to the nearest health facility were far shorter for urban households than for rural households. 
Sixty percent of urban households reported a distance of less than one kilometre compared with 
19 percent of rural households. 
 20  |  Characteristics of Households 
Information was also collected on the distance to the nearest market. Proximity to a market is 
important since health services, such as a medicine shop or clinic, are usually in the vicinity of markets. 
The results show that 77 percent of households are within five kilometres of the nearest market. Similar to 
distances to the nearest health facility, urban households are more likely than rural households to have 
markets nearby.

CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN 
3
 
This chapter provides a descriptive summary of the demographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics of the women who were interviewed in the 2009 UMIS. 
3.1 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS 
Table 3.1 presents the distribution of women age 15-49 by age group, ethnicity, urban-rural 
residence, region, education level, and wealth quintile. In general, the proportion of respondents in each 
age group declines as age increases, reflecting the comparatively young age structure of the population. 
The slightly lower proportion of women who are categorized as age 15-19 could be due to deliberate age 
misreporting on the part of interviewers. As mentioned in Chapter 2 and shown in Appendix C Table C.1, 
there were many more girls listed on the Household Questionnaire as being age 14 than age 15. This 
pattern is almost certainly due to interviewers deliberately displacing the ages of these adolescents to 
avoid having to do an individual interview. 
The largest ethnic groups among the female survey participants are the Baganda (16 percent), 
Langi and Banyankore (13 percent each), and Basoga (12 percent). The smallest ethnic groups are the 
Karimojong (1 percent) and Batoro (2 percent). Seventeen percent of the female respondents live in urban 
areas, and 83 percent live in rural areas. More than 17 percent live in the South Western region, 13 
percent live in the Mid Northern region, and 12 percent live in the East Central region. 
A quarter of the interviewed women are in the highest wealth quintile, while the remaining three-
quarters are fairly evenly distributed among the first four wealth quintiles. 
3.2 
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF WOMEN 
Education is a key determinant of the lifestyle and status an individual enjoys in a society. Studies 
have consistently shown that educational attainment has a strong effect on health behaviours and 
attitudes. In general, the higher the level of education that a woman attains, the more knowledgeable she 
is about the use of health facilities and health care services for herself, her children, and her family. Table 
3.1 presents general educational characteristics of women, and Table 3.2 presents an overview of the 
relationship between the respondent’s level of education and other background characteristics. 
The results in Table 3.2 show that 17 percent of women age 15-49 have no education, 39 percent 
have completed at least primary school, and only 6 percent have completed secondary school. Overall, the 
median number of years of education is 5. Younger women have generally reached higher levels of 
school than older women. For example, only 6 percent of women age 15-24 have never been to school 
compared with 33 percent of women age 40-44 and 42 percent of women age 45-49 years. In addition, 
younger women are more likely than older women to have completed secondary school. Urban women 
are better educated than rural women; this is illustrated by the higher median years of schooling for urban 
women (9 years) compared with rural women (5 years). 
Excluding Kampala, where educational attainment is comparatively high, the East Central, North 
East, and South Western regions have relatively higher proportions of women who have attained more 
than secondary schooling (5 to 6 percent) compared with between 1 and 3 percent of women in other 
regions. The educational level of women in the West Nile region is particularly low, with 30 percent of 
the women having no schooling at all, and with the median years of completed education being only 2.6.

 Characteristics of Women  |  23 
Table 3.2 also shows that poorer women tend to be less educated than richer women. 
Approximately 9 in 10 women in the lowest wealth quintile either have no education or only some 
primary education, compared with 2 in 10 women in the highest wealth quintile. On the other hand, only 
25 percent of women in the lower three wealth quintiles have at least some secondary education, 
compared with 63 percent of women in the highest wealth quintile. 
Overall, the educational attainment of women seems to have improved compared with findings 
reported in the 2006 UDHS.

EXPOSURE TO MASS MEDIA 
Access to various sources of information increases people’s knowledge and awareness of their 
environment, which may eventually affect their perceptions and behaviour. In the 2009 UMIS, exposure 
to the media was assessed by asking how often a respondent reads a newspaper, watches television, or 
listens to a radio. Table 3.3 shows the variation in exposure to mass media by background characteristics. 
The results show that radio is the most common mass medium of exposure, with three in four 
women listening to a radio broadcast at least once a week. Smaller proportions read a newspaper (16 
percent) or watch a television (14 percent) at least once a week. Only 7 percent of women report using all 
three media at least once a week. Generally, the proportion of women who are exposed to any media 
declines with age.

Only 11 percent of women in rural areas, compared with 41 percent of urban women, read a 
newspaper at least once a week. About 7 percent of rural women and almost 50 percent of urban women 
watch television at least once a week. About three-quarters of rural women listen to the radio, compared 
with 82 percent of urban women. 
Survey results reveal regional variations in media exposure, particularly for reading newspapers 
and watching television at least once a week; there is less regional variation in radio listenership. 
Exposure to media is positively associated with educational attainment. For example, 57 percent 
of the women with no education listen to the radio at least once a week compared with 91 percent of 
women with more than secondary education. A similar pattern is observed for the reading of newspapers 
and watching television. 
Similar to educational attainment, exposure to media is positively associated with wealth. Women 
in the higher wealth quintiles are more likely to be exposed to any or all of the three forms of media than 
women in the lower wealth quintiles.

1 “Currently employed” is defined as having done work in the past seven days. Includes persons who did not work in 
the past seven days but who are regularly employed and were absent from work for leave, illness, vacation, or any 
other such reason. 
  
 
The data show that 54 percent of women age 15-49 are currently employed. Younger women (15-
24 years) and those with no children are less likely to be currently employed compared with older women 
(25-49 years) and women with at least one living child. 
 26  |  Characteristics of Women 
Current employment is slightly higher in the rural areas than in the urban areas. Regionally, 
women in the North East region are most likely to be currently employed (80 percent) followed by 
women in the Mid Eastern region (70 percent). Apart from women with secondary education only, current 
employment levels seem to relate directly to the educational level of women; women with no education or 
with a primary education are less likely to be currently employed than women with more than a secondary 
education. 
The data also show that current employment seems to decline with wealth. Women in the lower 
wealth quintiles are more likely to be currently employed compared with women in the higher wealth 
quintiles. 
3.5 
OCCUPATION, TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT, AND UNEMPLOYMENT STATUS OF WOMEN 
Currently employed respondents were asked to state their occupation and type of employment, 
and the results are presented in Tables 3.5 and 3.6. Respondents who said that they were unemployed 
during the 12 months preceding the survey were asked what they had been doing during that period, and 
the results are presented in Table 3.7. 
Among currently employed women, 57 percent are engaged in agriculture, and 26 percent are 
engaged in sales and services (Table 3.5). The results further show that only 5 percent of working women 
age 15-49 are employed in the professional/technical/managerial occupations, fields which typically 
require more skills and attract higher financial returns. 
The most common occupation among employed women in rural areas is agriculture (65 percent) 
whereas in the urban areas it is sales and services (a little more than half of working women). Apart from 
Kampala and Central 1 regions, where sales and services is the predominant type of occupation, in almost 
all of the other regions, agriculture is the predominant activity. 
Table 3.6 shows the distribution of women employed during the 12 months preceding the survey 
by type of employment and earnings. Overall, 54 percent of women employed during the 12 months 
preceding the survey are not paid at all, regardless of type of employment. Sixty-one percent of women 
employed in agriculture and 44 percent of women engaged in non-agricultural activities are not paid at 
all; however, among women engaged in non-agricultural work, 46 percent are paid in cash only. 
Table 3.7 shows the percent distribution of women who were unemployed during the 12 months 
preceding the survey according to what they were doing most of the time. Overall, 56 percent of the 
women reported that they were engaged in household care activities (housework or child care), and 
another 36 percent declared that they were attending school. Those attending school were mostly found to 
be in the younger age groups, whereas those engaged in housework or child care tended to be older. 
Those women going to school tended also to be those who had secondary or more than secondary 
education and who were in the higher wealth quintiles. The data also show that women engaged in 
housework/child care are most likely to be women with less education and wealth. Unemployed women, 
regardless of wealth, are more likely to engage in housework/child care than attend school; however, the 
proportion of unemployed women attending school increases linearly with increasing wealth, whereas the 
proportion engaged in housework/child care decreases with increasing wealth. 
Overall, only 4 percent of unemployed women reported that they were looking for work at the 
time of the survey. Household work and school attendance are the dominant activities for unemployed 
women in all regions.

4.1 
ANTENATAL CARE 
All pregnant women are at risk of developing complications, many of which are unpredictable. It 
is during an antenatal care (ANC) visit that screening for complications and advice on a range of issues, 
including place of delivery and referral for complications, occurs. The major objective of antenatal care, 
therefore, is to identify and address problems that may arise during pregnancy, such as anaemia and 
infections. Information on antenatal care is of great value in identifying subgroups of women who do not 
use such services and is useful in planning improvement of the services. Table 4.1 presents the percent 
distribution of women age 15-49 who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey by the type of 
antenatal care provider consulted1 during the pregnancy for the most recent birth. 
The data show that practically all mothers (95 percent) receive antenatal care from a skilled 
provider (doctor, nurse, midwife, medical assistant, or clinical officer). Differences by age of mother, by 
birth order, and by urban-rural residence are on average small; however, urban mothers are more likely 
than rural mothers to receive antenatal care from doctors, whereas rural women are more likely to receive 
antenatal care from nurses or midwives. Compared with women in other regions, women in Central 1 
region are relatively less likely to receive ANC services from a skilled provider. 
Although the difference is not great, use of antenatal care services seems to be related to a 
woman’s educational level. Ninety-six percent of mothers with primary or more education receive 
antenatal care services from a skilled provider, compared with about 90 percent of mothers with no 
education. 
The relationship between wealth and antenatal care is not very clear. Women in the lower three 
wealth quintiles are almost as likely as women in the highest wealth quintile to receive antenatal care 
from a skilled provider (between 95 and 96 percent). However, mothers in the fourth wealth quintile seem 
less likely to receive antenatal care from a health professional (92 percent). Women in the highest wealth 
quintile are twice as likely to receive antenatal care from a doctor compared with women in the lowest 
wealth quintile (24 versus 12 percent). 
There has been little change since 2006 in the proportion of mothers who receive antenatal care 
from a skilled provider. However, the proportion that receives care from a doctor has increased from 9 to 
16 percent. 
                                                     
 
1 For the 2009 UMIS, if a woman received antenatal care from more than one provider, the provider with the highest 
qualification was recorded.

BREASTFEEDING 
Early initiation of breastfeeding has several benefits for both the mother and the newborn. In 
addition to fostering bonding between mother and child, early breastfeeding stimulates breast milk 
production and facilitates the release of oxytocin, which helps the contraction of the uterus and reduces 
postpartum blood loss. The first breast milk contains colostrum, which is highly nutritious and has 
antibodies that protect the newborn from diseases. Table 4.2 shows the percentage of all children born in 
the 5 years preceding the survey who were ever breastfed, and among those who were ever breastfed, the 
median number of months they were breastfed, by background characteristics.

Note: This table is based on births in the last five years preceding the survey 
regardless of whether the children are living or dead at the time of the interview. 
 
 
 
Breastfeeding is nearly universal in Uganda, with 97 percent of children born in the five years 
preceding the survey having been breastfed at some time. There is little difference by background 
characteristics. 
The median number of months of breastfeeding for children born in the five years preceding the 
survey who were ever breastfed is about 17 months. There is little difference by sex of the child or by 
urban-rural residence. However, children in the Mid Northern and West Nile regions are more likely to 
breastfeed a little longer (median of 21-23 months), and children in Kampala and Mid Eastern region 
breastfeed a little less (median of 12 months) than children in other regions. In addition, children born to 
women with the highest education as well as children born to the wealthiest women breastfeed 2 to 3 
fewer months than children born to other women.

WOMEN’S KNOWLEDGE OF MALARIA 
4.3.1 
Knowledge of Causes of Malaria 
Ignorance of how malaria is spread interferes with the ability to take appropriate preventive 
measures. Women were asked several questions to ascertain their knowledge of causes of malaria. Table 
4.3 presents information on responses provided by women age 15-49 when asked what causes malaria.

 Note: Percentages may add to more than 100.0, since multiple responses were allowed. 
  
 
Eighty-seven percent said that malaria is caused by mosquitoes, 16 percent said malaria is caused 
by drinking unboiled water, and another 15 percent said it is caused by cold or changing weather. 
Differences by background characteristics are not large; however, younger women and women in urban 
areas are more likely to mention mosquitoes as the cause of malaria compared with older women and 
women in rural areas. The data also show that women with more education and those with more wealth 
are more likely than the less educated and the less wealthy women to mention mosquitoes as the cause of 
malaria. Seven percent of respondents could not name any cause of malaria.

Women were also asked during the survey if they know of ways to avoid getting malaria. Those 
who knew of ways to avoid getting malaria were further asked to name specific ways to avoid getting 
malaria. Table 4.4 shows responses provided by women age 15 to 49 on ways to avoid getting malaria.

Eighty-six percent of women said that there are ways to avoid getting malaria. Urban women and 
those in Kampala and Central 1 regions are most likely to respond that there are ways to avoid getting 
malaria. Further, women with secondary or more education and those in wealthier quintiles are more 
likely than other women to say that malaria is avoidable. Women in West Nile (78 percent) are notably 
less likely than average to say that there are ways to avoid getting malaria. 
When asked to cite specific ways to avoid getting malaria, 83 percent of women said sleeping 
under a mosquito net, 22 percent said destroying mosquito breeding sites, and 13 percent cited sleeping 
under an insecticide-treated mosquito net as ways to avoid getting malaria. Only 7 percent cited taking 
preventive medication as a way to avoid malaria, and 4 percent mentioned spraying the house with 
insecticide. Because women were asked, without prompting, to cite specific ways to prevent getting 
 34  |  Antenatal Care, Knowledge of Malaria, and Management of Fever in Children 
malaria, it is likely that those who mentioned mosquito nets used the term ‘mosquito nets’ to refer to all 
types of mosquito nets, including insecticide treated nets (ITNs). Among women who said there are ways 
to avoid getting malaria, only 3 percent in Mid Northern region mentioned spraying the house as a 
method of avoiding malaria despite the fact that an indoor residual spraying exercise was being carried 
out in the region around the same time data were being collected for this survey. 
4.3.3 
Knowledge of Medicines to Avoid Getting Malaria during Pregnancy 
Women who said there are ways to avoid getting malaria were asked to cite specific medicines 
that can be given to pregnant women to avoid getting malaria. Women who mentioned SP/Fansidar as a 
medicine to give to pregnant women to avoid getting malaria were then asked to cite the number of times 
a pregnant woman should take the medicine during pregnancy to avoid getting malaria. Results are 
presented in Table 4.5. 
 Table 4.5  Knowledge of medicines to avoid getting malaria during pregnancy 
 
Among women age 15-49 who say there are ways to avoid getting malaria, the percentage that cite specific medicines that can be given to pregnant women to help them 
avoid getting malaria, and among women citing SP/Fansidar, the percentage that cite a specific number of times a pregnant woman needs to take SP/Fansidar to avoid getting 
malaria, by background characteristics, Uganda MIS 2009

 Antenatal Care, Knowledge of Malaria, and Management of Fever in Children  |  35 
Half of women who said there are ways to avoid getting malaria did not know of any medicines 
that a pregnant woman can take during pregnancy to avoid getting malaria. This knowledge gap is more 
pronounced among the youngest (age 15-19) and oldest (age 45-49) women, and in the two Central 
regions. Only 36 percent of the women cited SP/Fansidar, 7 percent mentioned Coartem®/ACT, 5 percent 
named chloroquine, and 2 percent mentioned chloroquine with Fansidar. Urban women, women with the 
most education, and women in the highest wealth quintile are more likely than other women to cite 
SP/Fansidar as the medicine that may be given to pregnant women to avoid getting malaria in pregnancy. 
Among women who cited SP/Fansidar as a medicine that may be given to pregnant women to 
avoid getting malaria, 25 percent said SP/Fansidar is to be taken 2 times, and 51 percent said it should be 
taken 3 times or more during the course of a pregnancy in order to avoid getting malaria. 
4.3.4 
Exposure to Malaria Messages 
A crucial element in the fight to eliminate malaria is the ability to reach the population with 
information and educational materials. In an effort to assess the coverage of communication programmes, 
women interviewed in the UMIS were asked if they had seen or heard any messages about malaria in the 
few months before the survey. 
As shown in Table 4.6, approximately 6 in 10 women had seen or heard a message about malaria. 
The proportion is 50 percent or higher in all categories of background characteristics except among 
women in the Mid Northern region and women in the lowest wealth quintile where less than 50 percent 
have seen or heard a malaria message in the 12 months preceding the survey. The proportion who have 
seen or heard a malaria-related message increases with educational level and with wealth and is higher in 
urban compared with rural settings. 
Table 4.6 also presents information on the places women say they saw or heard malaria-related 
messages. The most commonly cited sources are the radio (77 percent) and health worker/community 
medicine distributor (19 percent of women). Other sources of information (TV, newspaper, neighbour, 
community leader) were each mentioned by less than 10 percent of women. TV was cited mostly by 
women in Kampala and by women in the highest wealth quintile and with the highest level of education.

MANAGEMENT OF FEVER AMONG CHILDREN 
Most fevers occur at home, and they can rapidly progress to severe illness if treatment is not 
received promptly. 
4.4.1 
Knowledge of When a Child with Fever Should Be Taken for Treatment 
Table 4.7 presents information on women’s knowledge of when a child with fever should be 
taken for treatment. Two-thirds of women age 15-49 reported that a child with fever should be taken for 
treatment the same day. The proportion is highest among women age 20-24 years (73 percent) and among 
urban women (74 percent) compared with rural women (65 percent). In addition, the proportion increases 
with education level of the women, and is highest among women in the highest wealth quintile, although 
there is no clear correlation with wealth.

Seventeen percent of women age 15-49 reported that a child with fever should be taken for 
treatment the next day, and 6 percent said 2-3 days after onset of the fever. Another 6 percent said the 
severity of the fever will determine when the child should be taken for treatment. 
4.4.2 
Prevalence and Prompt Treatment of Fever in Children 
The 2009 UMIS asked mothers whether any of their own children under 5 years had had a fever 
in the two weeks preceding the survey and, if so, whether any treatment was sought. Questions were also 
asked about blood testing, the types of drugs given to the child, and how soon and for how long the drugs 
were taken. Other questions determined the first place they sought advice or treatment, the number of 
days after onset of fever when advice or treatment was sought, feeding practices during the episode of 
fever, and knowledge of when a child with fever should be taken to a provider for treatment. Table 4.8 
shows the percentage of children under age 5 who had fever in the two weeks preceding the survey and 
the actions taken to care for them.

About 45 percent of children under age 5 had a fever in the two weeks preceding the survey. The 
prevalence of fever is lowest among children under age 6 months (32 percent) and among children in the 
South Western region and Kampala (each 22 percent); prevalence is also low among children of mothers 
who have more than secondary school education (33 percent) and among children in the highest wealth 
quintile (36 percent). It is highest among children in the Mid Northern region (66 percent). 
Survey findings show that advice or treatment from a health facility or provider was sought for 70 
percent of the children with a fever in the two weeks preceding the survey; 60 percent took some type of 
antimalarial drug, and 23 percent took ACT. However, only 36 percent took antimalarial drugs on the 
same or the next day, and only 17 percent of children with fever were reported to have had a drop of 
blood taken from a finger or heel for testing (Figure 4.1). 
Children with fever in rural areas are more likely than those in urban areas to take antimalarial 
drugs for fever.

4.4.3 
Care Seeking Behaviour 
Mothers who reported that they sought advice or treatment from a health facility or provider for 
fever in a child were asked about the first place where care was sought for the child. Findings are 
presented in Table 4.9. 
Forty-four percent of children who had fever in the two weeks preceding the survey were taken to 
a public sector health facility, while 56 percent were taken to a private sector health facility. Children of 
wealthier mothers tend to be sent to a private hospital or clinic, while those with less wealthy mothers are 
taken to government health centres. 
The data further show that advice or treatment was sought for 50 percent of children within 24 
hours of onset of fever (Table 4.10). Advice or treatment is more likely to be sought on the same day or 
the next day for urban children than for rural children. Differentials by other background characteristics 
are not pronounced.

About one-fourth (23 percent) of children under age 5 who had fever in the two weeks preceding 
the survey took an ACT, while one-fifth (19 percent) took quinine for the management of the fever 
(Figure 4.2). Use of ACT ranges from 15 percent in children under age 1 to 28 percent of children 48-59 
months; however, this does not follow any particular pattern. There is little difference in the use of ACT 
by urban-rural residence, but there is some regional variation. Use of ACT is least common in the South 
Western region (10 percent of children with fever) and most common in the Mid Northern region (41 
percent of children with fever). 
It is interesting to note that while 23 percent of children with a fever in the two weeks preceding 
the survey took an ACT for the management of fever, only 14 percent of children took the medicine the 
same day or the next day.

Community Medicine Distributors 
The presence of community health workers or community medicine distributors (CMDs) who 
distribute antimalarial medicines at the household level enhances prompt management of malaria. Their 
functionality is affected by many factors, including the availability of medicines and other supplies. In 
interpreting the results, it is important to note that at the time of the survey, many CMDs were not 
functional because of the lack of antimalarial medicines for use in home-based management of fever in 
most areas. Households were asked whether there was a community health worker or community 
medicine distributor in the village or community who distributes malaria medicines. Findings are 
presented in Table 4.12.

Only 18 percent of households reported the existence of a community worker or community 
medicine distributor (CMD) in the village or community. These community workers/community 
medicine distributors are more likely to be available in rural areas (20 percent) compared with urban areas 
(4 percent), and they are particularly prevalent in the Mid Northern region (78 percent). The Ministry of 
Health and partners run CMD projects in these areas, which might explain the high percentage in this 
region.

Background 
Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are one of the most effective preventive measures for malaria. 
Since 2005, the government of Uganda, with support from several partners, has distributed approximately 
six million nets across the country. In addition, education on the importance of nets has increased, leading 
to a greater demand for the nets. The market for all nets (treated and untreated) has grown significantly. 
The Ministry of Health (MoH) plans to distribute an additional 17.7 million nets across the country in 
2010-11 to achieve universal coverage (currently defined as one net per two people). 
5.1.2 
Ownership of Mosquito Nets 
The 2009 UMIS included questions on bed net ownership and use, type and source of net, and 
reasons for not using a net, when applicable. In addition, questions were asked to determine who slept 
under the net the previous night and, if no one had, the reasons why the net was not used. 
Table 5.1 presents information on the percentage of households that have any type of mosquito 
net, an ever-treated net, an insecticide-treated net (ITN), and a long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN), by 
residence, region, and wealth quintile.

1 An ever-treated net is 1) a factory-treated long-lasting insecticidal mosquito net (LLIN) which does not require any further treatment, or 2) a factory net, with or without an 
insecticide kit, which has subsequently been soaked with insecticide at any time, or 3) a home-made net which has subsequently been soaked with insecticide at any time. 
2 An insecticide-treated net (ITN) is 1) a factory-treated long-lasting insecticidal mosquito net (LLIN) which does not require any further treatment, or 2) a factory net, with or

 46  |  Malaria Prevention 
Overall, 59 percent of households have at least one mosquito net, 47 percent have at least one 
ITN, and 46 percent have at least one LLIN. This implies that almost all ITNs owned by households in 
Uganda are LLINs. Compared with 2006, when 34 percent of households owned at least one mosquito net 
and only 16 percent owned at least one ITN (UBOS and Macro, 2007), ownership of mosquito nets has 
increased quite significantly in Uganda over the years (Figure 5.1). However, only 8 percent of 
households have three or more ITNs.

Ownership of at least one LLIN varies widely across regions, ranging from 22 percent of 
households in Central 2 region to 76 percent of households in North East region (Figure 5.2). Survey 
findings also show that the average number of LLINs per household is about 1 in most regions and 
approximately 2 for households in North East region. This variation in LLIN ownership across regions is 
likely due to the fact that several LLIN distribution campaigns focused on the northern and eastern 
regions of the country. 
There are no significant differences in LLIN ownership by rural and urban residence or by wealth 
quintile.

There are several ways to procure or obtain a mosquito net in Uganda. A pregnant woman may 
receive a mosquito net during routine antenatal care visits. Parents of children under 5 years of age may 
receive them during routine immunization visits to health facilities. Mosquito nets can also be obtained 
during mass distribution campaigns, and they can be purchased directly through various avenues. The 
percent distribution of nets by source and according to background characteristics is shown in Table 5.2.

As in 2006, shops, pharmacies, and open markets remain the main distribution channels for 
mosquito nets; however, the percentage of nets obtained through these channels has drastically dropped, 
from 60 percent in 2006 to only 33 percent in 2009. On the other hand, the proportion of nets obtained 
 48  |  Malaria Prevention 
from government health facilities has increased considerably, from 6 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 
2009. Similarly, the proportion of mosquito nets obtained from projects, NGOs, or churches has also 
increased, from 14 percent in 2006 to 26 percent in 2009. 
At the regional level, Mid Eastern and North East regions have the highest percentage of nets 
obtained from projects, NGOs, or churches (49 percent and 43 percent, respectively). Thirty-eight percent 
of nets in the Mid Northern region and 35 percent of nets in the West Nile region come from a 
government health facility. Only 3 percent of nets in Kampala come from government health facilities, 
and 5 percent come from projects, NGOs, or churches, while 63 percent are obtained from pharmacies, 
shops, or open markets. 
Wealthier households are less likely to obtain mosquito nets from government health facilities or 
a project, NGO, or church, but they are more likely to obtain their mosquito nets from the open market, a 
pharmacy, or a shop. 
5.1.3 
Use of Mosquito Nets by Children under Age 5 
The use of mosquito nets by children under age 5 is summarized in Table 5.3. Figure 5.4 provides 
information on trends in use of ITNs. Forty-one percent of children under age 5 in all households were 
reported to have slept under any net the night before the survey, while 33 percent slept under an ITN, and 
32 percent slept under an LLIN (Figure 5.3, Figure 5.4). This is an increase from 2006 when 22 percent of 
children were reported to have slept under any net, and only 10 percent slept under an ITN the night 
before the survey (UBOS and Macro, 2007).

Among children living in households that own an LLIN, however, 59 percent slept under an 
LLIN the night before the survey. Although the data do not show a clear trend or pattern in net usage by 
age or sex of the child, or by urban-rural residence, they suggest that children under 1 year of age are 
slightly more likely than older children to sleep under any mosquito net. 
 Malaria Prevention  |  49 
The data, however, do show some regional variation, with 78 percent of children under age 5 in 
households with an LLIN in North East region sleeping under an LLIN compared with only 43 percent of 
children in Central 2 region, and 49 percent of children in East Central and Mid Western regions. Wealth 
does not seem to have any clear effect on usage of mosquito nets among children under age 5 in 
households with LLIN.

2 An insecticide-treated net (ITN) is (1) a factory-treated long-lasting insecticidal mosquito net (LLIN) that does not require any further treatment, or 
(2) a factory net, with or without an insecticide kit, which has subsequently been soaked with insecticide within the past 12 months, or (3) a net

3 A long-lasting insecticidal mosquito net (LLIN) is a factory-treated net that does not require any further treatment. 
  
 
Forty-two percent of all women reported that they slept under any net the night before the survey 
(an increase from 23 percent in 2006), and 33 percent of all women reported that they slept under an ITN 
the night before the survey (an increase from 10 percent in 2006). The data further show that 32 percent 
slept under an LLIN the night before the survey. Among women in households with an LLIN, 62 percent 
slept under an LLIN the night before the survey. Regardless of the type of net (any net, ever-treated, ITN, 
or LLIN), net usage is higher among urban than among rural women. Women in households with an 
LLIN in East Central and North East regions were more likely than women in other regions to sleep under 
an LLIN the night before the survey. 
Fifty-four percent of pregnant women age 15-49 reported they slept under any net the previous 
night (Table 5.5) (an increase from 24 percent in 2006). Forty-four percent reported that they slept under 
an ITN (an increase from 10 percent in 2006). Among pregnant women living in households with an 
LLIN, 77 percent slept under an LLIN the previous night. Due to the small number of pregnant women in 
the survey (10 percent of all women), differences in net usage by residence and region are difficult to 
evaluate; however, it appears that level of education relates to net usage; only 47 percent of pregnant 
women with no education slept under any net the previous night compared with 61 percent of pregnant 
women with a secondary education.

Reasons for Not Using a Mosquito Net 
Net ownership does not necessarily guarantee usage. Table 5.6 presents information on 
households that own nets that were not used the night before the survey. Overall, 17 percent of 
households had at least one net that was not slept under the previous night. Only 6 percent of households 
in East Central reported a net that was not slept under the previous night. Among households with a net 
that was not slept under the previous night, the most common reason cited for non-usage was that the net 
was not hung (58 percent of households), especially in North East region (99 percent). Sixteen percent 
reported that the net was not used because it was too hot, and 11 percent said the net had too many holes 
or was too old.

5.2 
INDOOR RESIDUAL SPRAYING 
Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is another extremely effective method of malaria prevention 
through vector control. IRS has been instrumental in eliminating malaria in many countries across the 
world. Uganda first used IRS in the 1960s but then discontinued use following a ban on the chemical 
DDT for almost 50 years. IRS was reintroduced in 2006 with the spraying of one district. Currently, eight 
districts are being sprayed: Kitgum, Pader, Gulu, Amuru, Apac, and Oyam, which are all in the Mid 
Northern region, and Katakwi and Kumi which are in the North East region. Cost has been a major 
challenge for the Ugandan IRS programme; however, the government of Uganda is increasing its 
commitment to this intervention, and therefore, coverage could increase in the future. 
The 2009 UMIS included questions on whether a household had been sprayed within the previous 
12 months, how long ago it was sprayed, who sprayed the household, and whether or not the household 
paid to have the house sprayed. Table 5.7 presents information on IRS coverage as well as the percentage 
of households covered by either IRS or at least one ITN.

On average, only 6 percent of all households have been sprayed in the previous 12 months, 
similar to IRS coverage in 2006. In line with the IRS programme coverage thus far, households in the 
Mid Northern region have the highest IRS coverage (32 percent of households). Unlike in 2006 when 
urban households and wealthier households were more likely to have been sprayed in the 12 months 
preceding the survey, currently, there is very little difference between urban and rural households. 
Households in the lower two wealth quintiles, however, are more likely to have been sprayed compared 
with houses in the higher wealth quintiles. 
Forty-nine percent of Ugandan households have either been sprayed in the 12 months preceding 
the survey or own at least one ITN, that is, the household is covered by either IRS or an ITN. Households 
in the Mid Northern (78 percent) and North East (77 percent) regions are more likely to be covered by 
either an IRS or an ITN compared with, for example, households in Central 2 (26 percent). There is very 
little difference by urban or rural residence or by wealth. 
5.3 
INTERMITTENT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT OF MALARIA IN PREGNANCY 
To reduce the risks of pregnant women getting malaria, the current policy under the National 
Malaria Control Programme calls for all pregnant women to receive at least two doses of sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine (SP/Fansidar), at a minimum of one month apart after quickening.1 Women receive 
SP/Fansidar during their antenatal care visits under directly observed therapy. It is also possible that 
pregnant women obtain SP from sources outside of antenatal care visits. 
                                                 
1 Quickening occurs when the pregnant women begin to experience foetal movement. 
 Malaria Prevention  |  55 
The 2009 UMIS included questions to women with a live birth in the two years preceding the 
survey regarding the time they were pregnant with their most recent birth. They were asked if they had 
taken any antimalarial medicine to prevent getting malaria during the pregnancy, and if so, what type of 
antimalarial medicine. If respondents had taken SP/Fansidar, they were further asked how many times 
they took it and whether they had received it during an antenatal care visit. Table 5.8 shows the 
percentage of women who took any antimalarial medicine and the percentage who took SP/Fansidar.

1 IPT: Intermittent preventive treatment is preventive treatment with a dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
(SP/Fansidar) to pregnant women at each scheduled antenatal visit after the first trimester, but not more 
frequently than once a month. The percentages included in these columns may include SP/Fansidar from 
sources other than ANC, since women can get SP/Fansidar from a variety of sources.
  
 
 56  |  Malaria Prevention 
Sixty-four percent of women with a live birth in the two years preceding the survey reported they 
took some type of antimalarial medicine to prevent getting malaria during the last pregnancy (compared 
with 45 percent of women in 2006). Forty-seven percent said they took SP/Fansidar at least once during 
the pregnancy (compared with 37 percent in 2006), and 33 percent said they took two or more doses of 
SP/Fansidar during the last pregnancy (compared with 18 percent in 2006). Intermittent preventive 
treatment (IPT) is defined as the percentage of pregnant women who received two or more doses of 
SP/Fansidar, at least one of which was during an antenatal visit. In the UMIS, IPT was estimated at 32 
percent, compared with 16 percent in 2006 (Figure 5.5).

Note: IPT is defined as percentage of women with a live birth in the 2 years preceding the
survey who received 2+ doses of SP/Fansidar, at least one of which was during an ANC visit.
 
These findings show some urban-rural variation in taking antimalarial medicines to prevent 
malaria during pregnancy; women in urban areas are more likely to use malaria prophylaxis during 
pregnancy than women in rural areas. Also, women with more education as well as those in higher wealth 
quintiles are more likely than women with no or little education and women in lower wealth quintiles to 
use malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy.

ANAEMIA AND MALARIA IN CHILDREN

6.1 
ANAEMIA AND MALARIA AMONG CHILDREN 
Anaemia, defined as a low level of 
functional haemoglobin in the blood, de-
creases the amount of oxygen reaching the 
tissues and organs of the body, thereby 
reducing their capacity to function. Be-
cause all human cells depend on oxygen 
for survival, anaemia in children can lead 
to severe health consequences, including 
impaired cognitive and motor develop-
ment, stunted growth, and increased mor-
bidity from infectious diseases. There are 
several types of anaemia, produced by a 
variety of underlying causes; inadequate 
intake of iron, folate, vitamin B12, or other 
nutrients usually account for the majority 
of cases of anaemia in many populations. 
However, in malaria endemic areas, ma-
laria accounts for a significant proportion 
of anaemia in children under age 5. Other 
causes of anaemia include thalassemia, 
sickle cell disease, and intestinal worms. 
As anaemia is a major cause of morbidity 
and mortality associated with malaria, pre-
vention and treatment of malaria among 
children and pregnant women is essential. 
Promotion of the use of insecticide-treated 
mosquito bed nets and deworming medica-
tion every six months for children under 
age 5 are two important measures that can 
be taken to reduce the prevalence of 
anaemia among children. 
All children age 0-59 months liv-
ing in the households selected for the 2009 
UMIS were eligible for haemoglobin and 
malaria testing. In the 2009 UMIS, the 
HemoCue system was used to measure the 
concentration of haemoglobin in the blood, 
and the Paracheck Pf® rapid diagnostic 
blood test for detection of HRP2 in blood 
(supplied by Orchid Biomedical Systems, 
Goa, India) was used to detect malaria. 
Table 6.1 shows the total number of chil-
dren age 0-59 months (and children age 6-59 months) eligible for testing and the percentages actually 
tested for anaemia and malaria.

 58  |  Anaemia and Malaria in Children 
Of the 4,045 children age 0-59 months eligible for testing, 97 percent were tested for anaemia 
using the HemoCue portable machine, 97 percent were tested for malaria using the rapid diagnostic test, 
and blood smears were collected for 97 percent. The coverage levels were uniformly high across most of 
the population; however, rural children were more likely than urban children to be tested. Testing tended 
to decrease with increasing education of mothers and with increasing household wealth. In addition, 
testing levels were significantly lower in Kampala compared with other regions. As shown in Table A-2, 
the overall response rate was slightly lower in Kampala than in other regions and could potentially 
explain the lower testing rates in Kampala.

1 Given that haemoglobin requirements differ substantially depending on altitude, anaemia data are normally 
adjusted for altitude using the formulas recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 1998). 
 Anaemia and Malaria in Children  |  59 
The results of the 2009 UMIS show that 6 out of 10 Ugandan children (62 percent) under the age 
of 5 years are anaemic (Hb concentration levels are below 11 g/dl). Twenty-one percent are mildly 
anaemic (Hb concentration levels of 10-10.9 g/dl), 30 percent are moderately anaemic (Hb concentration 
levels of 8.0-9.9 g/dl), and 10 percent are severely anaemic (Hb concentration levels of less than 8 g/dl). 
Based on these findings, anaemia seems to be a significant public health problem in Uganda. Anaemia is 
highest among children age 6-17 months old; the proportion of children with anaemia then decreases with 
age. 
There is little difference in the proportion of children with anaemia by sex. However, rural 
children are more likely to be anaemic than urban children (63 versus 54 percent); this pattern holds for 
moderate anaemia (31 percent rural vs. 26 percent urban) as well as for severe anaemia (11 percent rural 
vs. 3 percent urban). There are also significant regional differences; anaemia appears to be more prevalent 
among children in East Central (70 percent) and Mid Northern (74 percent) regions than among children 
in South Western region (40 percent). In addition the data suggest that wealthier children are less likely to 
be anaemic (or severely anaemic) compared with less wealthy children. 
Comparison with the 2006 UDHS data is difficult because of differences in definitions of 
moderate and severe anaemia. Nevertheless, the proportion of children age 6-59 months with anaemia has 
declined from 73 to 62 percent. 
6.1.2 
Malaria Prevalence among Children 
Malaria prevalence among children age 0-59 months was measured in the 2009 UMIS in two 
ways. In the field, health technicians used the Paracheck Pf® rapid diagnostic blood test (RDT) to 
determine whether children had malaria; blood was obtained from finger or heel prick samples. Children 
with positive RDT results were offered antimalarial treatment according to Uganda malaria treatment 
protocol. In addition, thin and thick smears from each child’s blood were made in the field, dried in a 
dust-free environment, stored in slide boxes, and transported to the UMSP Molecular Laboratory for 
confirmatory microscopy testing. Table 6.3 shows the results of both malaria tests (RDT and microscopy) 
for children age 0-59 months (and children age 6-59 months) by background characteristics. 
Survey results show that the prevalence of malaria is higher using RDTs than using microscopy. 
This is expected because of the possibility of false positive RDT test results in a few percent of the tests 
(Chansuda Wongsrichanalai et. al, 2007). Using RDT, 52 percent of children 0-59 months (55 percent of 
children 6-59 months) tested positive for malaria. Using microscopy, 42 percent of children 0-59 months 
(45 percent of children 6-59 months) tested positive for malaria (Table 6.3, Figure 6.1). Prevalence is also 
higher in rural areas than in urban areas (47 versus 15 percent using microscopy) and is higher in the Mid 
Northern region (63 percent using microscopy) than in other regions. 
Regardless of which test was used, there is little difference in prevalence by sex of the child; 
however, malaria prevalence increases with the age of the child and decreases with the mother’s 
educational level as well as with her wealth (Figure 6.2).

Malaria Speciation 
Another objective of the survey was to determine the type of Plasmodium parasite found in 
children with positive thick smears. Table 6.4 shows the prevalence of each Plasmodium species in 
children age 0–59 months and the percentage with mixed infections by background characteristics. 
Ninety-nine percent of infected children had Plasmodium falciparum, 2 percent P. vivax, 2 
percent P. malariae and less than one percent P. ovale; three percent carried mixed species infections.

 Lessons Learned, Conclusions, and Recommendations  |  63 
LESSONS LEARNED, CONCLUSIONS, AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
LESSONS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UGANDA MIS 
Uganda started planning for a combined AIDS indicator and malaria indicator survey in mid-2007 
with the intent to start field work in November 2008 during peak malaria transmission season. The surveys 
were combined to cost-share and to minimize survey fatigue of the Ugandan population. Also, there was the 
intent to study the effects of one disease on the other. This attempt to field a combined AIS and MIS was 
abandoned early on when the complexity of data collection was recognized. In the end, because of the 
technical challenges and the numerous delays caused by these challenges, Uganda decided to separate the 
surveys. The malaria indicator survey (MIS) was able to progress quickly, and field work started on time in 
peak season in November 2009. The following are some of the lessons learned from attempting to conduct a 
malaria indicator survey (MIS) concurrently with another type of survey, such as an AIDS indicator survey:  
1. Compromises in laboratory testing may need to be made in both surveys. 
2. Questionnaires need careful scrutiny to ensure that all questions are relevant because a combined 
survey will inevitably require a time commitment from the interviewee. 
3. Cost savings may not be significant. 
4. Timing of the survey can be difficult in a country with malaria seasonality. As the AIS survey is 
season-independent, it will have to be flexible and timed to coincide with the peak season for 
malaria, which is when the MIS survey should be done. 
5. In many countries, including Uganda, HIV programmes tend to overshadow other programmes. 
Malaria control programmes suffer similar challenges. 
6. Involvement of Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partners in the implementation of a malaria indicator 
survey is important in order for the partners to own the results. 
CONCLUSIONS FROM THE MIS FINDINGS 
This was the first MIS survey conducted in Uganda. The results provide a robust array of coverage 
indicators critical to monitoring and evaluating performance of interventions of the National Malaria Control 
Programme. 
By comparing some of the key interventions with data from the 2006 Uganda Demographic Health 
Survey (where available), a mixed picture is observed. Some of the indicators have recorded a moderate 
increase while others have not improved at all, leaving the programme very far from achieving the national, 
Abuja, and Roll Back Malaria in Africa targets for 2010. 
Moderate to substantial increase in coverage is observed for: 
• 
Overall knowledge level of malaria 
• 
Household ownership of ITNs, children and pregnant women sleeping under an ITN the previous 
night, although malaria prevalence is still high 
• 
Proportion of pregnant women who received IPT during last pregnancy 
 64  |  Lessons Learned, Conclusions, and Recommendations 
• 
Prompt treatment of fever with an ACT within 24 hours of onset according to the Uganda national 
treatment policy 
In conclusion, there has been an upward trend in most malaria indicators, albeit far from RBM targets.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Data on malaria should be collected by the Uganda National Malaria Control Programme 
regularly, preferably every three years, to monitor the performance of the programme and its 
interventions and to guide development of strategies for malaria prevention, control, and 
elimination. 
2. For Uganda to achieve national targets for malaria control, the country, with support from its 
development partners, must make efficacious, life-saving ACTs available to all health facilities 
for prompt treatment of fever within 24 hours of onset, in addition to scale up of vector control 
efforts. 
3. Underlying all interventions is the need for a sustained information, education, and 
communication (IEC) and behaviour, change, communication (BCC) campaign (radio and mobile 
phones) to increase use of preventive and curative services for malaria. As mobile phone 
ownership is rising, innovative approaches to engage telecommunication companies to use mobile 
technology to mobilise and sensitise the population on malaria prevention could be explored.

SAMPLE DESIGN 
Appendix A
 
A.1 
INTRODUCTION 
The 2009 UMIS was designed to allow reliable estimation of key malaria indicators for the country as 
a whole, for urban and rural areas separately, and for Kampala and each of the 9 regions comprised of 8-10 
contiguous administrative districts of Uganda that share similar languages and cultural characteristics. 
Kampala district, because of its unique character as an entirely urban district and capital city of Uganda, 
comprised a separate region. Thus there were 12 reporting domains: 
1. Urban areas 
2. Rural areas 
3. North East Region: Kotido, Abim, Kaabong, Moroto, Nakapiripirit, Katakwi, Amuria, Bukedea, 
Soroti, Kumi and Kaberamaido. 
4. Mid Northern Region: Gulu, Amuru, Kitgum, Pader, Apac, Oyam, Lira, Amolatar, Dokolo. 
5. West Nile: Moyo, Adjumani, Yumbe, Arua, Koboko, Nyadri and Nebbi.  
6. Mid Western region: Masindi, Buliisa, Hoima, Kibaale, Bundibugyo, Kabarole, Kasese, 
Kyenjojo and Kamwenge. 
7. South-Western Region: Bushenyi, Rukungiri, Kanungu, Kabale, Kisoro, Mbarara, Ibanda, 
Isingiro, Kiruhura and Ntungamo. 
8. Mid Eastern Region: Kapchorwa, Bukwa, Mbale, Bududa, Manafwa, Tororo, Butaleja, Sironko, 
Pallisa, Budaka and Busia.  
9. Central 1: Kalangala, Masaka, Mpigi, Rakai, Lyantonde, Sembabule, and Wakiso. 
10. Central 2: Kayunga, Kiboga, Luwero, Nakaseke, Mubende, Mityana, Mukono and Nakasongola. 
11. East-Central: Jinja, Iganga, Namutumba, Kamuli, Kaliro, Bugiri and Mayuge. 
12. Kampala: Kampala. 
A.2 
SAMPLING FRAME 
Administratively, Uganda is divided into 80 districts1. In turn, each district is subdivided into 
counties, and each county into parishes. In addition to these administrative units, during the last population 
census, each parish was subdivided in convenient areas called census enumeration areas (EAs). Each EA is 
either totally urban or rural. The list of EAs has census information on households and population 
information, and grouped by each administrative unit. The available demarcated cartographic material for 
each EA in the last census made such census as an adequate sample frame for the 2009 UMIS. 
                                                 
1 There were 80 districts at the time of designing and collecting data for the 2009 UMIS. Currently there are 112 districts 
in Uganda. 
  
68  |  Sample Design 
In the census frame, EAs were grouped by districts, and by rural and urban location. Therefore such 
stratification by districts and urban and rural areas is also reflected in the 2009 UMIS sample. 
A.3 
SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION 
The primary sampling units were census enumeration areas of the 2002 National Housing and 
Population Census. The sample was designed to provide malaria prevalence estimates for each of the 10 
regions with a sampling error of approximately 12 percent. Determination of the sample size for the UMIS 
was based on an estimated prevalence for plasmodia parasitemia in the country of 20 percent among children 
under age five. The survey used a cluster design, so a design effect of 1.69 was assumed. 
Assuming a sampling error of 12 percent, the sample size, n was estimated using the following 
formula: 
n= 
p(1-p) 
X
DEFF
se2 
R 
 
where  
 
p = 0.20 or 20% (prevalence of malaria) and 1-p = 1-0.20, or 0.8 
se = sampling error = (12%*0.20) = 0.024 
DEFF = design effect = 1.22 = 1.44 
R = response rate (estimated at 0.98 or 98%) 
n = 408 children aged 0-59 months per region 
A sample size of 408 children per region or 4,080 children in the 10 regions of the country will be 
required. With slightly less than one child under age five per household, about 425 households would be 
required per region or 4,250 households for the 10 regions in the country. Selecting 28 households per EA 
will ensure that about 25 per EA will be interviewed. The sample required will be a total of 170 census EAs 
or approximate 17 per region. 
A.4 
SAMPLE ALLOCATION AND SAMPLE SELECTION 
The sample was not spread geographically in proportion to the population, but rather equally across 
the regions, with 17 clusters per region and a total of 170 clusters for the country. Table A.1 presents the final 
allocation of EAs by region and by urban-rural residence, as well as the number of households selected by 
region. 
The sample for the 2009 UMIS was selected using a stratified two-stage cluster design. The first stage 
involved systematically selecting the 170 EAs from a list of enumeration areas covered in the 2002 census 
with probability proportional to size using the formula: 
P1i = (b mi / Σ mi) 
where 
b: 
number of EAs allocated for region , with EAs ordered first urban and the rural 
 
mi: 
measure of size of i-th EA 
 
Σ mi: 
measure of size for the corresponding region

Among the 170 clusters selected, 26 were in urban areas and 144 were in rural areas.

In the second stage, a fixed number of households (28) was selected in each of the sampled 
enumeration areas, using an equal probability systematic sampling from a list of households residing in the 
EA. The total number of households selected was therefore 4,760. Since the 2009 UMIS sample is unbalanced 
among regions, it will require a final weighing adjustment procedure to provide estimates at every other 
domain of study. 
In a given selected EA, if 28 is the fixed number of households selected out of the total households 
(Li) found in the 2009 listing process for the i-th selected EA, then the household probability in the selected i-
th cluster can be expressed as: 
P2i = (c / Li) 
 
The final households overall probability in the i-th cluster could be calculated as:  
fi = P1i * P2i 
and the sampling design weight  for the i-th cluster is given as: 
1/fi   = 1 / (P1i * P2i) 
All women age 15-49 years who were either permanent residents of the households in the sample or 
visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed in the survey. 
In addition, all children age 0-59 months who were listed in the household were eligible for the anaemia and 
malaria testing component.

 Estimates of Sampling Errors  |  71 
ESTIMATES OF SAMPLING ERRORS 
Appendix B
 
Estimates derived from a sample survey are affected by two types of errors: 1) non-sampling 
errors, and 2) sampling errors. Non-sampling errors are the results of mistakes made in implementing data 
collection and data processing, such as failure to locate and interview the correct household, 
misunderstanding of the questions on the part of either the interviewer or the respondent, and data entry 
errors. Although numerous efforts were made during the implementation of the 2009 Uganda malaria 
indicator survey (2009 UMIS) to minimize this type of error, non-sampling errors are impossible to avoid 
and difficult to evaluate statistically. 
Sampling errors, on the other hand, can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents 
selected in the 2009 UMIS is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same 
population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ 
somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability 
between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated 
from the survey results. 
A sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic 
(mean, percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to 
calculate confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed 
to fall. For example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will 
fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all 
possible samples of identical size and design. 
If the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been 
possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the 2009 UMIS 
sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use a more 
complex formula. The computer software used to calculate sampling errors for the 2009 UMIS is the 
sampling error module in ISSA (Integrated System for Survey Analysis). This module uses the Taylor 
linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. Another 
approach, the Jackknife repeated replication method is used for variance estimation of more complex 
statistics such as fertility and mortality rates. 
The Taylor linearization method treats any percentage or average as a ratio estimate, r = y/x, 
where y represents the total sample value for variable y, and x represents the total number of cases in the 
group or subgroup under consideration. The variance of r is computed using the formula given below, 
with the standard error being the square root of the variance:

where h 
represents the stratum which varies from 1 to H, 
mh 
is the total number of clusters selected in the hth stratum, 
yhi 
is the sum of the weighted values of variable y in the ith cluster in the hth stratum, 
xhi 
is the sum of the weighted number of cases in the ith cluster in the hth stratum, and 
f 
is the overall sampling fraction, which is so small that it is ignored. 
 
In addition to the standard error, the design effect (DEFT) for each estimate is also calculated. 
The design effect is defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the 
standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used. A DEFT value of 1.0 indicates 
that the sample design is as efficient as a simple random sample, while a value greater than 1.0 indicates 
the increase in the sampling error due to the use of a more complex and less statistically efficient design. 
Relative errors and confidence limits for the estimates are also computed. 
Sampling errors for the 2009 UMIS are calculated for selected variables considered to be of 
primary interest for the sample of women. The results are presented in this appendix for the country as a 
whole, for urban and rural areas separately, for Kampala and for each of the 9 regions. For each variable, 
the type of statistic (mean, proportion, or rate) and the base population are given in Table B.1. Tables B.2 
to B.14 present the value of the statistic (R), its standard error (SE), the number of unweighted (N-
UNWE) and weighted (N-WEIG) cases, the design effect (DEFT), the relative standard error (SE/R), and 
the 95 percent confidence limits (R±2SE), for the selected variables. The DEFT is considered undefined 
when the standard error considering a simple random sample is zero (when the estimate is close to 0 or 1). 
The confidence interval e.g., as calculated for child slept under an ITN last night can be 
interpreted as follows: the overall proportion from the national sample is 0.328 and its standard error is 
0.022. Therefore, to obtain the 95 percent confidence limits, one adds and subtracts twice the standard 
error to the sample estimate i.e., 0.328 ± 2×0.022. There is a high probability (95 percent) that the true 
proportion of children under five who slept under an ITN the night before the survey is between 0.283 
and 0.372. 
For the total women sample, the value of the design effect (DEFT) averaged over all variables is 
2.4, which means that due to multi-stage clustering of the sample the average standard error is increased 
by a factor of 2.4 over that in an equivalent simple random sample.

 INTRODUCTION AND CONSENT
Hello.  My name is ___________________________. I am working with UBOS in collaboration with MOH.  
We are conducting a national survey about malaria and would very much appreciate your participation in this 
survey.This information will help the government to plan health services. As part of the survey we would first 
like to ask some questions about your household. These questions will take about 15 minutes to complete. 
Whatever information you provide will be kept strictly confidential, and will not be shared with anyone 
other than members of our survey team.
Participation in this survey is voluntary, and if we should come to any question you don't want to answer, 
just let me know and I will go on to the next question; or you can stop the interview at any time. However, 
we hope you will participate in the survey since your views are important.
At this time, do you want to ask me anything about the survey? May I begin the interview now?

 CONSENT STATEMENT FOR ANEMIA TEST
As part of this survey, we are asking that children all over the country take an anemia test. Anemia is a serious health problem that
usually results from poor nutrition, infection, or disease.  This survey will help the government to develop programs to prevent
and treat anemia.
We request that all children under 5 years participate in the anemia testing part of this survey and give a few drops of blood
from a finger. The equipment used in taking the blood is clean and completely safe.  It has never been used before and will be
thrown away after each test.
The blood will be tested for anemia immediately and the result will be told to you right away. The result will be kept confidential.
Do you have any questions about the anemia test?
You can say yes to the test or you can say no. It is up to you to decide. 
Will you allow [NAME(S) OF CHILD(REN)] to participate in the anemia test?  
CONSENT STATEMENT FOR MALARIA TEST
As part of this survey, we are asking that children all over the country take a test to see if they have malaria. Malaria is a serious
illness caused by a parasite transmitted by a mosquito bite. This survey will help the government to develop programs to prevent malaria.
We request that all children under 5 years participate in the malaria testing part of this survey and give a few drops of blood
from a finger. The equipment used in taking the blood is clean and completely safe.  It has never been used before and will be
thrown away after each test. (We will use blood from the same finger prick made for the anemia test).
The blood will be tested for malaria immediately and the result will be told to you right away. The result will be kept confidential.
Do you have any questions about the malaria test?
You can say yes to the test or you can say no. It is up to you to decide. 
Will you allow [NAME(S) OF CHILD(REN)] to participate in the malaria test?  
TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN WITH POSITIVE MALARIA TESTS
IF MALARIA TEST IS POSITIVE: The malaria test shows that your child has malaria. We can give you free medicine.
The medicine is called COARTEMACT. COARTEM/ACT is very effective and in a few days it should get rid of the fever and other symptoms.
BEFORE PROVIDING COARTEM/ACT FIRST ASK IF THE CHILD IS ALREADY TAKING OTHER MEDICINES AND IF SO ASK TO SEE THEM
BEFORE PROVIDING COARTEM/ACT, FIRST ASK IF THE CHILD IS ALREADY TAKING OTHER MEDICINES AND IF SO, ASK TO SEE THEM.
IF CHILD IS ALREADY TAKING COARTEM/ACT, CHECK ON THE DOSE ALREADY AVAILABLE. FOLLOW THE NATIONAL TREATMENT
GUIDELINE FOR MALARIA. BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERTREAT.
You do not have to give the child the medicine. This is up to you. Please tell me whether you accept the medicine or not.  
Weight (in Kg) – Approximate age
Dosage *
5 kgs. to less than 15 kgs. (under 3 years)
1 tablet twice daily for 3 days
15 kgs. to less than 25 kgs. (3 -8 years)
2 tablets twice daily for 3 days
First day starts by taking first dose followed by the second one 8 hours later; on subsequent 
days the recommendation is simply “morning” and “evening” (usually around 12 hours apart).
Take the medicine (crushed for smaller children) with high fat food or drinks like milk. 
Make sure that the FULL 3 days treatment is taken at the recommended times, otherwise the infection may return.
If your child vomits within an hour of taking the medicine, you will need to get get additional tablets and repeat the dose.
ALSO TELL THE PARENT/CARE TAKER:
If [NAME] has any of the following symptoms, you should take him/her to a health professional for treatment immediately:
-- High fever
-- Fast or difficult breathing
-- Not able to drink or breastfeed
-- Gets sicker or does not get better in 2 days

 INTRODUCTION AND CONSENT
Hello.  My name is ___________________________. I am working with the MOH and UBOS.  We 
are conducting a national survey about malaria and would very much appreciate your participation in this survey. 
This information will help the government to plan health services. These questions will take about 15 minutes 
to complete. Whatever information you provide will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with 
anyone other than members of our survey team.
Participation in this survey is voluntary, and if we should come to any question you don't want to answer,
 just let me know and I will go on to the next question; or you can stop the interview at any time. However, 
we hope you will participate in the survey since your views are important.
At this time, do you want to ask me anything about the survey? May I begin the interview now?
