Background: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a preventive intervention for
anxiety disorders and depression by targeting excessive levels of repetitive negative thinking (RNT;
worry and rumination) in adolescents and young adults.
Methods: Participants (N ¼ 251, 83.7% female) showing elevated levels of RNT were randomly allocated
to a 6-week cognitive-behavioral training delivered in a group, via the internet, or to a waitlist control
condition. Self-report measures were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 m and 12 m
follow-up.
Results: Both versions of the preventive intervention significantly reduced RNT (d ¼ 0.53 to 0.89), and
symptom levels of anxiety and depression (d ¼ 0.36 to 0.72). Effects were maintained until 12 m follow-
up. The interventions resulted in a significantly lower 12 m prevalence rate of depression (group
intervention: 15.3%, internet intervention: 14.7%) and generalized anxiety disorder (group intervention:
18.0%, internet intervention: 16.0%), compared to the waitlist (32.4% and 42.2%, respectively). Mediation
analyses demonstrated that reductions in RNT mediated the effect of the interventions on the prevalence
of depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
Conclusions: Results provide evidence for the efficacy of this preventive intervention targeting RNT and sup-
port a selective prevention approach that specifically targets a known risk factor to prevent multiple disorders.

1. Introduction
Anxiety disorders and depression are highly prevalent (Kessler,
Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005), are associated with reduced quality
of life for patients (Olatunji, Cisler, & Tolin, 2007; Strine et al., 2009),
and enormous economic costs for society (Simon, VonKorff, &
Barlow, 1995). Although evidence-based treatments for anxiety
disorders and depression are available, large numbers of people do
not seek treatment (Eisenberg, Hunt, Speer, & Zivin, 2011), do not
respond to treatment (Griffiths & Griffiths, 2015), or experience a
new episode over time (Bruce et al., 2008; Curry et al., 2011).
Therefore, it is increasingly being argued that treatment alone is
not sufficient to alleviate the individual and societal burden
associated with these disorders, but that this needs to be com-
plemented by prevention (Topper, Emmelkamp, & Ehring, 2010).
A growing number of programs for the prevention of depression
and anxiety disorders have been developed and evaluated. Recent
meta-analytic studies have focused on the effects of universal
prevention programs (i.e. interventions offered to all individuals
without pre-selection) on depressive symptom severities relative
to randomized control groups. Results demonstrate small effect
sizes at post-intervention (d ¼ 0.04-.121) (Horowitz & Garber, 2006;
Merry et al., 2012; Stice, Shaw, Bohon, Marti, & Rohde, 2009) and

1 Several effect size indices were reported in these meta-analyses, including
Cohen's d, the correlation coefficient r, and Hedges' g. To facilitate interpretation, all
effect size indices were converted to Cohen's d according to Cohen (Cohen, 1988),
and Rosenthal (Rosenthal, Cooper, & Hedges, 1994). Criteria for Cohen's d are used
to classify effect sizes as small (0.20-0.30), medium (0.50) and large (0.80).

 follow-up (d ¼ 0.02-0.12) (Horowitz & Garber, 2006; Merry et al.,
2012; Stice et al., 2009). Similarly, meta-analyses evaluating uni-
versal prevention programs for anxiety demonstrate small effect
sizes at post-treatment (d ¼ 0.12-0.29) (Fisak, Richard, & Mann,
2011; Teubert & Pinquart, 2011; Zalta, 2011) and follow-up
(d ¼ 0.15) (Teubert & Pinquart, 2011). Evidence for efficacy of se-
lective (i.e., provided for individuals at risk of psychopathology)
and indicated prevention programs (i.e., offered to individuals
showing early symptoms of a disorder) is somewhat more favor-
able. Programs focusing on the prevention of depression have been
found to produce small to moderate effect sizes in the reduction of
depressive symptoms levels at post-intervention (d ¼ 0.23-0.31)
(Horowitz & Garber, 2006; Merry et al., 2012; Stice et al., 2009), and
follow-up (d ¼ 0.22-0.34) (Horowitz & Garber, 2006; Merry et al.,
2012; Stice et al., 2009). For anxiety, meta-analytic studies
demonstrate small to moderate effect sizes for these programs at
post-intervention (d ¼ 0.21-0.32) (Fisak et al., 2011; Teubert &
Pinquart, 2011; Zalta, 2011), and follow-up (d ¼ 0.23) (Teubert &
Pinquart, 2011).
Several researchers have argued that the comparison of symp-
tom levels as described above does not reflect true prevention ef-
fects (Cuijpers, van Straten, Smit, Mihalopoulos, & Beekman, 2008;
Horowitz & Garber, 2006). Instead, it has been proposed that the
incidence rates of disorders across intervention and control groups
should be compared (Cuijpers et al., 2008). Following up on this
recommendation, Garber et al. (2009) conducted an indicated
prevention study comparing a group cognitive behavioral preven-
tion program to usual care in 316 adolescents of parents with
depression. At 9 months follow-up, the prevention program
resulted in a 34% reduction of the risk of developing a depressive
disorder. In a recent meta-analysis, Merry et al. (2012) demon-
strated that both universal and targeted (selective and indicated)
prevention programs significantly reduced incidence rates of
depression at post-treatment and 3e9 months follow-up. At 1 year
follow-up, this effect disappeared for universal programs, but
remained evident for targeted programs. However, a more recent
meta-analysis did not find significant differences in the reduction
of incidence rates of depression between universal, selective and
indicated prevention programs (Van Zoonen et al., 2014), with an
average incidence reduction of 21%. Only a few studies have
investigated the effect of preventive interventions on the reduction
of the incidence of anxiety disorders. For example, Seligman,
Schulman, DeRubeis, and Hollon (1999) evaluated the effects of a
selective prevention program targeting a maladaptive attributional
style in 231 college students. Participants assigned to a group
cognitive behavioral prevention program were less likely (14%) to
develop a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder than partici-
pants assigned to a no-intervention control group (21%). When
conducting a systematic literature search, Stockings et al. (2016)
were able to identify only seven studies testing universal preven-
tion, and one study testing selective and indicated prevention,
respectively. Although the incidence of anxiety disorders was
significantly reduced when compared to control groups at post-
intervention, this effect was only maintained at longer-term
follow-up for indicated prevention. In sum, although the provi-
sion of prevention for depression and anxiety disorders appears
generally promising, there is clearly room for improvement in this
area. Moreover, despite the high levels of co-morbidity between
anxiety and depression (Kessler et al., 2003), relatively few studies
have tested preventive interventions for both symptom clusters
simultaneously.
For example, in their systematic review and meta-analysis,
Stockings et al. (2016) identified 12 studies testing universal pre-
vention, 6 studies on selective prevention and 9 studies on indi-
cated prevention targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Results of these studies mostly showed that the preventive in-
terventions are efficacious in reducing both symptom clusters.
Importantly, however, these effects were not maintained at the 12
months assessment (universal prevention) or were not assessed
(selective and indicated prevention).
A number of suggestions have been proposed in the literature to
increase the efficacy of preventive interventions. Many authors
have interpreted the findings described above as evidence that the
effects of universal prevention fall behind that of selective and
indicated prevention and that prevention should therefore mainly
focus on high risk individuals (Bienvenu & Ginsburg, 2007; Craske
& Zucker, 2001; Horowitz & Garber, 2006). 2 In addition, it appears
promising to select participants based on risk factors that are
modifiable, and to then specifically target these risk factors in the
preventive
intervention
(Craske
&
Zucker,
2001;
Zvolensky,
Schmidt, Bernstein, & Keough, 2006). In contrast to prevention
programs consisting of broadband cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) strategies, a focus on modifiable risk factors may ensure a
more individualized approach that is tailored to the needs of an
individual and is thereby likely to boost motivation and engage-
ment (Vitiello, 2011). Studies using this strategy in the past have
targeted factors such as maladaptive attributional style (Seligman
et al., 1999), anxiety sensitivity (Balle & Tortella-Feliu, 2010), body
dissatisfaction (Stice, Mazotti, Weibel, & Agras, 2000) or behavioral
inhibition (Rapee, Kennedy, Ingram, Edwards, & Sweeney, 2005).
Finally, the efficacy of prevention may be increased by focusing on
preventive interventions that target transdiagnostic risk factors
that predispose for the development of a range of disorders (Dozois,
Seeds, & Collins, 2009; Nehmy, 2010). There is some evidence that
targeting transdiagnostic risk factors, such as body dissatisfaction
(Stice & Shaw, 2002), attributional style (Seligman et al., 1999), and
perfectionism (Musiat et al., 2014) can reduce the risk for different
types of psychopathology.
In the current study, we applied the general strategy outlined
above to develop a novel prevention program for depression and
generalized anxiety disorder targeting repetitive negative thinking
(RNT; e.g., worry, rumination). RNT appears to be a promising target
for prevention for a number of reasons (see also Topper et al., 2010).
First, there is substantial evidence showing that RNT is a trans-
diagnostic risk factor. Longitudinal studies have shown that rumi-
nation predicts future onset of major depressive episodes, diagnosis
and symptom severities of PTSD, levels of anxiety, and bulimic as
well as substance abuse symptoms (Ehring & Watkins, 2008;
Watkins, 2008). Similarly, worry has been found to predict future
levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. A relationship between
RNT and emotional disorders is also found in childhood and
adolescence
(Abela,
Brozina,
&
Haigh,
2002;
McLaughlin
&
Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Nolen-Hoeksema, Stice, Wade, & Bohon,
2007; Schwartz & Koenig, 1996), with increased RNT predicting the
onset of depression (Wilkinson, Croudace, & Goodyer, 2013). Due to
the early onset of depression (Fergusson, Horwood, Ridder, &
Beautrais, 2005) and anxiety disorders (McEvoy, Grove, & Slade,
2011), preventive interventions are typically targeted at this
period of development. In experimental studies, the induction of
rumination
has
been
shown
to
exacerbate
already existing
dysphoric mood and negatively impacts depressogenic processes
such as increased negative thinking and poorer problem solving
(Hubbard, Faso, Krawczyk, & Rypma, 2015; Lyubomirsky & Nolen-
Hoeksema, 1995). Experimental induction of worry has been
2 One methodological issue to consider when comparing the different types of
preventive interventions is that greater power is needed to demonstrate the effects
of universal interventions because a larger number of participants are not at risk of
developing emotional problems, and there is a lower base-rate of incidence.

 shown to result in increased negative affect (Lyonfields, Borkovec,
& Thayer, 1995; McLaughlin, Borkovec, & Sibrava, 2007), delayed
decision-making speed (Metzger, Miller, Cohen, Sofka, & Borkovec,
1990), poor problem-solving confidence (Davey, 1994), and inter-
ference with emotional processes associated with the extinction of
fear responses (Borkovec, Ray, & Stober, 1998).
Second, studies investigating the differences between worry and
rumination, as the two main variants of RNT, have demonstrated
that worry and rumination are highly similar (Ehring & Watkins,
2008).
Recent
studies
using
structural
equation
modelling
showed that factor solutions that include a common variance
component for worry and rumination provided a better fit than
factor solutions in which worry and rumination were considered
separate constructs (McEvoy & Brans, 2013). Moreover, this com-
mon variance component of worry and rumination was sufficient to
predict future levels of depression and anxiety (Topper, Molenaar,
Emmelkamp, & Ehring, 2014a,b). This implies that worry and
rumination can be reduced simultaneously using the same inter-
vention strategies. Evidence suggests, however, that cognitive
behavioral strategies to reduce negative cognitions (e.g., thought
challenging) will not directly target worry and rumination, as RNT
does not appear to be simply interchangeable with negative
cognition in general. For example, RNT has been found to predict
risk for depression above and beyond other types of negative
thinking and/or mediates the effects of other types of negative
thinking, such as self-criticism (e.g., Spasojevic & Alloy, 2001;
Verplanken, Friborg, Wang, Trafimow, & Woolf, 2007). With respect
to treatment by CBT, symptoms for individuals reporting higher
levels of RNT improved at a slower rate from standard cognitive
behavioral approaches than those with lower levels of RNT (Ciesla
& Roberts, 2002; Price & Anderson, 2011; Schmaling, Dimidjian,
Katon, & Sullivan, 2002).
Third, a number of evidence-based treatments that are effective
in reducing RNT are available (Topper et al., 2010; Watkins, 2015;
Watkins et al., 2011). The intervention principles within these
treatments can be adapted to make them suitable for use in a
prevention program. As a consequence, the development and
evaluation of preventive interventions targeting RNT have been
recommended (Topper et al., 2010; Watkins, 2015; Wilkinson et al.,
2013). However, despite the robust evidence implicating RNT in the
development of anxiety and depression, to date, no trial has spe-
cifically evaluated a preventive intervention that explicitly targets
RNT as its main focus. Of course, it can be expected that participants
in existing CBT-based prevention programs also bring up worry and
rumination as an intervention target. However, these programs
typically use traditional cognitive restructuring to deal with the
content of rumination or worry but do not include interventions
that explicitly and specifically target the process of RNT.
The aim of the current study was to test the feasibility and ef-
ficacy of a preventive intervention targeting RNT in adolescents and
young adults. Following up on the above mentioned recommen-
dations, the intervention was selectively offered to individuals
showing elevated levels of both worry and rumination. The content
of the preventive intervention was derived from a treatment pro-
tocol (Rumination-focused CBT; RFCBT) that has been shown to
effectively reduce levels of RNT as well as symptom levels of
depression, and to prevent relapse in individuals with residual
depression (Watkins & Moberly, 2009; Watkins et al., 2007, 2011).
Whilst still grounded within the core principles and techniques
of standard CBT for depression, RFCBT includes several novel ele-
ments and features several key differences (see Watkins, 2015, 2016
for further details). First, the RFCBT intervention does not involve
cognitive restructuring or challenging of individual thoughts, un-
like many CBT programs, but rather is focused on helping in-
dividuals to spot the sequence of RNT and trying to replace or
interrupt that pattern of thinking. Second, as part of that process, it
explicitly targets RNT as a habit (Watkins & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2014)
by identifying antecedent cues to worry/rumination, controlling
exposure to these cues, and by repeated practice of alternative
helpful responses to these cues, using behavioral activation (BA)
techniques such as functional analysis and scheduling contingency
plans (Martell, Addis, & Jacobson, 2001). Third, building on research
indicating that an abstract, decontextualized, and global thinking
style, characteristic of RNT, causally contributes to its maladaptive
consequences (Watkins, 2008), patients are taught to shift into a
more adaptive concrete and specific thinking style, using imagery,
behavioral experiments, and experiential approaches that include
focusing on recreating experiences of being absorbed (e.g., ‘flow’
experiences), and experiences of increased compassion to self or
others.
Two versions of the preventive intervention were tested. In the
first condition, the intervention was delivered in a group format.
Group formats are considered a cost-effective way to deliver pre-
vention as one therapist can work with multiple individuals at the
same time. In the second condition, the intervention was delivered
via the Internet. In the field of prevention, highly scalable in-
terventions enabling widespread coverage and access are needed
(Kazdin & Blase, 2011). While showing comparable efficacy
(Christensen, Batterham, & Calear, 2014; Van der Zanden, Kramer,
Gerrits,
&
Cuijpers,
2012),
internet-based
psychological
in-
terventions have a number of potential advantages relative to face-
to-face formats, including greater accessibility, anonymity and
convenience.
We predicted that both versions of the preventive intervention
would reduce levels of worry and rumination. In addition, the
intervention was hypothesized to reduce symptom levels of anxiety
and depression as the primary target. Because symptoms of bulimia
and alcohol abuse (i.e., binge drinking) have also been associated
with RNT (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2007), we predicted that these
symptoms would also be reduced by the preventive interventions.
Furthermore, we predicted that both versions of the intervention
would reduce the future prevalence of major depression and
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). As the group and internet
versions followed the same basic principles, we did not have any
predictions regarding whether one or the other type of delivery
would be more efficacious.
A second aim of this study was to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of the preventive intervention. Specifically, we pre-
dicted that the effect of the interventions on the prevalence of
depression and GAD would be mediated by precedent changes in
RNT.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
In line with earlier research, an effect size of at least d ¼ 0.66 was
expected for the critical Time (pre-intervention, post-intervention,
3 m follow-up assessment,12 m follow-up assessment) x Condition
(group intervention, internet intervention, wait list control group)
interaction effect with rumination as the dependent variable
(Watkins et al., 2011), whereas smaller effect sizes (d ¼ 0.20) were
expected for symptom severity levels as the dependent variables
(Merry et al., 2012). Using a conservative estimate of d ¼ 0.20, alpha
was set at 0.05 and power at 0.80. A two-tailed power calculation
(using G*power) showed that a minimal sample size of 207 was
required, but more participants were recruited to hedge against
attrition, which was estimated at 20%.
All secondary schools (n ¼ 23) providing education to pupils
preparing for university within the greater Amsterdam area were

125
 informed about the prevention trial and invited to participate.
Pupils attending class at the final three grades (ages 15 to 18) of the
13 schools that were willing to participate were informed and
recruited between September 2010 and May 2012. Their parents
were informed about the project via a letter. Following this
announcement, research assistants visited the schools during reg-
ular class to screen for excessive levels of worry and rumination by
administering the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) (Meyer,
Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990) and the Ruminative Response
Scale (RRS) (Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991).
In addition, two faculties of social sciences of two local univer-
sities agreed to participate in this prevention trial. At these uni-
versities, recruitment was organized through an e-mail, website,
and poster campaign. 3 A link directed first-year students (ages
18e22) interested in the project to a website where they could fill
out the PSWQ and RRS.
To screen positive for elevated levels of worry and rumination,
participants had to have a total score at or above the 75th percentile
on one of the screening measures and a total score at or above the
66th percentile on the other screening measure. For the PSWQ and
RRS, the 75th percentiles corresponded to scores of 50 and 40,
whereas the 66th percentiles corresponded to scores of 47 and 38
respectively. 4
A CONSORT diagram (Schulz, Altman, Moher, & CONSORT
Group, 2010) illustrating participant flow throughout the study is
presented in Fig.1. Inclusion criteria included (1) being between the
ages of 15 and 22, (2) scoring above the cutoffs for excessive worry
and rumination described above at both the initial screening and
the pre-intervention assessment, (3) absence of self-reported cur-
rent diagnoses of major depression and/or generalized anxiety
disorder as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9;
Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Patient Health Questionnaire Primary
Care Study Group, 1999) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Questionnaire-IV (GADQ-IV; Newman et al., 2002), and (4) absence
of concurrent treatment for mental health problems. Randomiza-
tion was stratified by gender and student type (secondary school
student, university), and was carried out by a person independent
from the study via a true randomization process and delivered in
closed envelopes. The first author informed all participants about
their allocation to either the group intervention (n ¼ 82), the
internet intervention (n ¼ 84), or the wait list control condition
(n ¼ 85). Participants’ demographic characteristics are shown in
Table 1. The randomization method was successful in that there
were no significant differences between the three groups on any
demographic characteristic during the pre-intervention assess-
ment.

intervention and 3 m follow-up (FU) assessments, and V20 for

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Self-report measures of repetitive negative thinking
2.2.1.1. Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). The PSWQ (Meyer
et al., 1990) measures the tendency, intensity and uncontrollability
of worry and consists of 16 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale,
with values ranging from 1 (not at all typical of me) to 5 (very
typical of me) (sample items: “I am always worrying about
something”; “Once I start worrying, I cannot stop”). The PSWQ has
been shown to have high internal consistency in clinical and non-
clinical samples (a ¼ 0.86-0.95), high test-retest reliability in a
variety of samples (r ¼ 0.74-0.92), good convergent and discrimi-
nant validity, and good predictive validity in the prediction of
depression and anxiety (Hong, 2007; Meyer et al., 1990; Van
Rijsoort, Emmelkamp, & Vervaeke, 1999) (as in this study ¼ 0.76-
0.89).
2.2.1.2. Ruminative
Response
Scale
(RRS). The
RRS
(Nolen-
Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991) consists of 22 items on a Likert-type
scale, with values ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost al-
ways). It assesses the tendency to respond to depressed mood with
a focus on self, (sample item: “Why do I have problems that other
people don't have?”), symptoms (sample item: “Think about your
feeling of fatigue and achiness.”), and possible consequences and
causes of this depressed mood (sample item: “I won't be able to do
my job if I don't snap out of this.”). The RRS has been shown to have
good internal consistency (a ¼ 0.82-0.90), moderate to high test-
retest reliability (r ¼ 0.47-0.80), good convergent validity as well
as good predictive validity in the prediction of depression and
anxiety (Just & Alloy, 1997; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000; Nolen-
Hoeksema, Parker, & Larson, 1994) (as in this study ¼ 0.80-0.92).
2.2.1.3. Perseverative
Thinking
Questionnaire
(PTQ). The
PTQ
(Ehring et al., 2011) is a 15-item questionnaire assessing the ten-
dency to engage in RNT independent of a disorder-specific content.
Items are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost al-
ways) (sample items: “The same thoughts keep going through my
mind again and again.”; “I keep asking myself questions without
finding an answer.”). Assessment of the psychometric properties of
the PTQ has demonstrated high internal consistency (a ¼ 0.93-
0.95), acceptable test-retest reliability (r ¼ 0.69-0.75), good
convergent validity as well as good predictive validity in the pre-
diction of symptom levels of anxiety and depression (Ehring, Raes,
Weidacker, & Emmelkamp, 2012) (as in the current study ¼ 0.86-
0.93).
2.2.2. Self-report measures of symptomatology
2.2.2.1. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II (Beck, Steer,
& Brown, 1996) is a measure of depressive symptomatology. Re-
spondents are asked to endorse 21 sets of statements varying in
severity from 0 (e.g., “I do not feel sad.”) to 3 (e.g., “I am so sad or
unhappy that I can't stand it.”). The highest rating for each item is
summed across all items to create a continuous measure of
depressive symptoms. High internal consistency (a ¼ 0.88-0.92),
and test-retest reliability (r ¼ 0.93-0.96) has been reported, as well
as high convergent validity with self-report measures and a
structured interview measure of depressive symptomatology (Beck
et al., 1996; Sprinkle et al., 2002) (as in this study ¼ 0.87-0.88).
2.2.2.2. Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-D30 (MASQ-
D30). The MASQ-D30 (Wardenaar et al., 2010) is a 30-item measure
designed to measure nonspecific general distress and symptoms
specific to depression and anxiety. In this study, only the 10-item
Anxious Arousal (e.g., “My heart was racing or pounding.”) and
General Distress scales (e.g., “I felt inferior to others.”) were used, as
depressive symptomatology was measured with the BDI-II. Items
are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).
Acceptable to high internal consistency has been demonstrated in
clinical and non-clinical samples for the anxiety (a ¼ 0.70-0.85) and
nonspecific symptom (0.84-0.91) scale, as well as good convergent
validity with other self-report measures of symptomatology
(Wardenaar et al., 2010). (as in the current study ¼ 0.82-0.93).
3 Although the recruitment procedure for secondary schools and universities
differed, there were no pre-intervention differences in levels of RNT between pupils
(PSWQ: M ¼ 58.36, SD ¼ 6.74; RRS: M ¼ 48.89, SD ¼ 8.51) and university students
(PSWQ: M ¼ 59.21, SD ¼ 6.80; RRS: M ¼ 47.19, SD ¼ 7.58), t(249) ¼ �0.97, p ¼ 0.33,
and t(249) ¼ 1.61, p ¼ 0.11, respectively.
4 These scores were based on the distribution of PSWQ and RRS scores from the
first recruitment wave at the participating secondary schools (n ¼ 1258).

 2.2.2.3. Eating Disorder Inventory-2, bulimia subscale (EDI-2-BU).
The EDI-2 (Garner, 1991; Van Strien, 2002) is a 91-item question-
naire assessing behavioral and attitudinal dimensions common in
eating disorders. The bulimia scale consists of 7 items on a 1 (never)
to 6 (always) scale designed to measure the tendency to binge and
purge (e.g., “I stuff myself with food.”; “I eat when I get upset.”).
High internal consistency (a ¼ 0.78-0.93) and test-retest reliability
(r ¼ 0.75-0.94) of the bulimia subscale has been reported, as well as
good construct and discriminant validity (Thiel & Paul, 2006; Van
Strien & Ouwens, 2003); as in this study ¼ 0.84-0.89).
2.2.2.4. Quick Drinking Screen (QDS). The QDS (Sobell et al., 2003)
consists of 5 items assessing alcohol consumption. Respondents are
asked to estimate the frequency and quantity of alcohol con-
sumption. We adjusted the items of this measure so that they
applied to alcohol consumption over the last 2 weeks (e.g., “In the
last two weeks, how many times have you had 5 or more alcoholic
beverages?”). The QDS has shown to produce reliable brief sum-
mary measures of alcohol consumption (Sobell et al., 2003). In this
study, we used the frequency of binge drinking as an outcome
measure.
2.2.3. Self-report measures of clinical diagnoses
2.2.3.1. Patient
Health
Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9). The
PHQ-9
(Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & He, 1999) consists of 9 items that
can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression. The items
correspond to the DSM-IV criteria for major depression. For each of
the nine symptoms of depression, respondents indicate whether
the symptom has bothered them in the past 2 weeks: 0 ¼ not at all,
1 ¼ several days, 2 ¼ more than half of the days, 3 ¼ nearly every

 day (e.g., “Little interest or pleasure in doing things?”). Gilbody,
Richards, Brealey, & Hewitt, (2007) in a meta-analysis of 17 vali-
dation studies concluded that the PHQ9 has good diagnostic
properties for depression (sensitivity 92%; specificity 80%).
2.2.3.2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-IV (GADQ-IV).
The GADQ-IV (Newman et al., 2002) is a 9-item measure that can be
used to provide a self-report diagnostic assessment of generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD), as well as a severity score of generalized
anxiety symptoms. The items correspond to DSM-IV criteria for
GAD. The validity of the GADQ-IV is supported by comparisons
between GADQ-IV diagnoses and clinician-administered Anxiety
Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV) diagnoses in a treatment-
seeking sample, and a non-anxious comparison group (Luterek,
Turk, Heimberg, Fresco, & Mennin, 2002). The GADQ-IV showed a
sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 96%.
2.2.4. Additional self-report measures
2.2.4.1. Life
Events
Checklist
(LEC). The
LEC
(Johnson
&
McCutcheon, 1980) is a measure of child and adolescent life
stress listing 46 life events (e.g., “Death of a parent.”). As recom-
mended by Turner and Wheaton (Turner & Wheaton, 1995, pp.
29e58), some items were adapted to increase the potential rele-
vance to the current study sample. We used a simple unit rating
procedure (sum of life events indicated as present within the past
year) as an index of life stress. The LEC was administered at the pre-
intervention and 12 m FU assessments.
2.2.4.2. Additional treatment/medication. At 12 m FU, participants
indicated whether they had received psychopharmacological and/
or psychological treatment outside of the trial.
2.2.4.3. Treatment satisfaction evaluation form. This questionnaire
was adapted from Gallego, Emmelkamp, Van Der Kooij, and Mees
(2011). Perceived usefulness of the intervention (e.g., Did you
experience the program as relevant for your problems and diffi-
culties?”), and participants’ satisfaction with the intervention (e.g.,
“Have you been able to trust the facilitators?”) are assessed with a
number of yes/no responses; in addition, an overall satisfaction
rating on a 1e10 scale is given.
2.2.5. Preventive intervention
The preventive intervention was developed by the authors and
consisted of a modified version of the Rumination-focused CBT
(RFCBT) protocol developed by Watkins et al. (Watkins et al., 2007).
The efficacy of RFCBT has recently been assessed in an RCT allo-
cating 42 patients with medication-refractory residual depression
to treatment as usual (TAU) alone, or to TAU plus up to 12 sessions
of individual RFCBT (Watkins et al., 2011). TAU consisted of ongoing
antidepressant medication and outpatient clinical management.
TAU plus RFCBT significantly reduced rumination and depression
relative to TAU alone (remission rates: TAU 21%; TAU þ RFCBT 62%),
comparing favorably to remission rates (25%) found for TAU plus
standard CBT in another trial for residual depression (Paykel et al.,
1999).
Our preventive intervention is based on (1) evidence showing
that worry and rumination are forms of avoidance (Giorgio et al.,
2010; St€
ober, Tepperwien, & Staak, 2000), and (2) experimental
research showing that dysfunctional forms of RNT are characterized
by an abstract and evaluative style of processing, which causally
contributes to a number of maladaptive consequences, including
poor problem solving, increased emotional reactivity, relative to a
concrete and contextualized style of processing (Watkins &
Baracaia, 2002; Watkins & Moulds, 2005; Watkins, 2008). A
functional-analytic
approach
is
used,
in
which
RNT
is
conceptualized as a learned habitual behavior that acts as a form of
avoidance and that develops through negative reinforcement
(Watkins & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2014). Functional analysis examines
how, when and where RNT does occur, and its antecedents and
consequences, to formulate its possible functions and to make
plans that systematically reduce or replace it (Watkins, 2015, 2016).
The intervention uses psycho-education, functional analysis, iden-
tification of warning signs and the planning of alternative re-
sponses in contingency or If-Then plans, reflective exercises/group
discussion,
experiential
exercises,
behavioral
activation,
and
behavioral
experiments
designed
to
facilitate
a
shift
from
dysfunctional worrisome/ruminative thinking into a more helpful
concrete thinking style and to increase approach behavior. The
internet and group version of the intervention only differed in the
format delivered, and were identical in content.
The group intervention was delivered in six weekly sessions
lasting for 1.5 h each, and followed a session-by-session manual.
The groups ranged in size from five to nine participants. The
internet intervention consisted of six sessions that could be
completed on a designated website. The program was self-paced,
yet participants were advised to complete at least half a session
at a time. Upon completion of a session, therapists could securely
access the online platform to provide personalized written feed-
back. In both versions of the intervention, participants received
regular reminders for their sessions/online tasks.
Prior to administering the intervention, study therapists atten-
ded a 2-day training workshop, led by the developers of the
intervention. The group intervention was delivered by four thera-
pists, graduated in clinical psychology, who had several years of
experience in group treatment with the target groups. In addition, a
graduate student served as a co-therapist during the sessions. All
sessions were audiotaped to guide supervision which was provided
by the second author after each session. Infractions in the form of
elements of the protocol left out and prohibited behaviors/in-
terventions, were discussed during supervision to prevent future
protocol violations. The internet intervention was delivered by six
different therapists graduated in clinical psychology. All therapists
had at least six months of experience with internet treatment and
followed a manualized response protocol. The content of their
feedback on each of the completed sessions was checked by the
first author. When necessary, adjustments were made before the
feedback was sent to the participant.
2.2.5.1. Content. The first sessions of the intervention were used to
define worry, rumination and avoidance, and to conduct a func-
tional analysis of participants' use of these maladaptive strategies.
Subsequent sessions included interventions that taught partici-
pants to be more aware of when their attempts at coping with
distress (do not) work and to increase their use of strategies that
work. Participants identified their triggers for worry and rumina-
tion, and practiced alternative behaviors incompatible with RNT.
Directed imagery was used to evaluate the cognitive, emotional and
behavioral effects of an abstract evaluative thinking style compared
to a more specific, concrete thinking style that is grounded in direct
experience. Additional experiential exercises were used to recreate
previous mental states of being completely absorbed in an activity
(e.g., ‘flow’ experiences), and experiences of increased compassion
to self and others. Guidelines were provided that instructed par-
ticipants on how to employ a more grounded, concrete and
compassionate thinking style. In the final session, participants were
a) taught to increase action-oriented, assertive behavior when
engaging with others, and b) to create an individualized summary
of strategies that they considered to be useful.
In the group intervention, a workbook was used that guided the
participants through the program content and exercises. Most of
M. Topper et al. / Behaviour Research and Therapy 90 (2017) 123e136
128
 the exercises were introduced using group discussion. In the
internet intervention, writing exercises were used to obtain input
from the participants and exercises were illustrated by film clips of
two peer actors talking about their experiences. Both versions of
the program contained homework exercises.
2.2.5.2. Adherence. Intervention adherence was only measured for
the group intervention as the written feedback in the internet
intervention was standardized in a way that adherence was guar-
anteed. Two audiotaped sessions for each group were randomly
selected (33%). Ratings of adherence in delivering the therapy were
provided independently by the first author and a researcher who
was not involved in this study. For each session of the protocol,
essential elements were listed such that the number of prescribed
and prohibited infractions per session could be tallied. The inter-
rater agreement between raters was high, k ¼ 0.87. On average, 93%
of the essential and required elements of the protocol were
completed
per
session.
Prohibited
behaviors/interventions
comprised content that was not part of the protocol and originated
from other interventions
(e.g., challenging thoughts). Raters
observed an average of 1.13 infractions per session. There were no
differences in the proportion of infractions to completed elements
between therapists, c2 (3) ¼ 0.73, p ¼ 0.87.
2.2.6. Procedure
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the local
institutional review board. In addition, the trial was registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT01223677). All assessments were
administered online. After providing written informed consent,
participants received an e-mail with a link directing to the pre-
intervention
assessment.
Eligible
participants
were informed
about intervention allocation via telephone or e-mail. For all par-
ticipants, the post-intervention assessment followed 1 week after
the intervention had been completed, i.e., 8e10 weeks post-
randomization. After the 12 m FU, participants in the waitlist
condition were given the opportunity to follow the internet version
of the program.
2.2.7. Data analytic approach
Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the
effect of the intervention on RNT and symptom measures of anxi-
ety, depression, bulimia, and alcohol abuse. Multilevel regression is
an intent-to-treat procedure that does not impute missing data but
deals with incomplete data by assuming that the available data for a
given subject are representative of that subject's deviation from the
average trends across time (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006). The level-1
model included the time variable, which captures within-person
change over time. In the level-2 model, between-person charac-
teristics such as intervention condition were used to predict the
slope estimates representing change in the dependent variables.
We estimated a linear trend indicating the direction and rate of
change, and a quadratic trend indicating whether the rate of change
increased or decreased over time. The assumption that data were
missing at random was evaluated by using binary logistic regres-
sion to predict measurement dropouts and by comparing the group
of participants with measurement dropout(s) (n ¼ 65) to the group
of participants without measurement dropout (n ¼ 186) on base-
line measures. Baseline characteristics did not predict attrition and
did not differ significantly between conditions (all ps > 0.05)5.
Allowing intercepts and slopes to covary did not significantly
improve any of the models, and therefore unstructured covariance
structures were used. Contrast coding was used to evaluate the
effect of the categorical variable intervention condition (Hox,
Moerbeek, & Van de Schoot, 2010). The first contrast compared
both interventions (coded 1
=
3) to waitlist control (coded �2
=
3), and
the second contrast compared the group RFCBT intervention
(coded 1
=
2) to the internet RFCBT intervention (coded �1
=
2). Within
group effect sizes (Cohen's d) for each outcome measure were
calculated by subtracting the mean score for each successive
measurement from the pre-intervention mean and by dividing this
difference score by the pooled standard deviation across time
points. Between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) from pre-to post-
intervention were calculated using the linear trend estimate of the
time by contrast interactions divided by the pooled standard de-
viation (Feingold, 2013).
Cox regression survival analyses were performed to examine the
effect of the preventive intervention on self-reported episode on-
sets of major depression and GAD. Participants were censored upon
measurement dropout or end of study. Although condition was the
main covariate included in the model, we also considered age,
gender, school level, treatment history, medication, additional
treatment, additional medication and life events during the study
course. Similar to the multilevel regression described above,
dummy variables were created for condition to compare both in-
terventions together against the waitlist control, and against each
other.
Two separate mediation analyses were conducted to determine
whether reductions in RNT (PTQ6) mediated the prevalence of 1)
major depression (PHQ-9) and 2) GAD (GADQ-IV) at the 12 m FU.
Following the recommendations of Hayes (Hayes, 2009), a bias-
corrected bootstrapping procedure with 5000 resamples was per-
formed using structural equation modelling. This method offers
more power than more traditional approaches while maintaining
reasonable control over the Type I error rate. As the outcomes of the
mediation analyses were dichotomous (0 ¼ does not fulfil criteria
for major depression or GAD, 1 ¼ fulfils criteria of major depression
or GAD), probit regression analyses were performed (MacKinnon,
2008) using the WLSMV estimator in Mplus 5.0 (Muth�
en &
Muth�
en, 2007). A prerequisite for conclusively establishing medi-
ation is that changes in the mediator variable precede changes in
the outcome variables (Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh, 2015). To
this end, pre to post-intervention change scores were computed for
the PTQ. Confidence intervals (CI; 95%) were derived for the indi-
rect effect of condition (group/online intervention vs. waitlist
control) via the hypothesized mediator (change in RNT) on the 12 m
prevalence of depression and GAD. Mediation is said to occur if the
derived confidence interval does not contain zero (Preacher &
Hayes, 2004). To obtain an effect size of the mediation effect, we
calculated the proportion of the total effect that is mediated by pre-
to post-intervention reductions in RNT (MacKinnon, 2008).
3. Results
3.1. Pre-intervention group differences
Table 1 demonstrates the demographic characteristics of par-
ticipants per condition.
There was a significant difference in the number of life events
experienced in the year previous to the pre-intervention assess-
ment, F (2, 248) ¼ 4.80, p ¼ 0.009. Participants in the waitlist
control condition (M ¼ 5.27, SD ¼ 2.66) had experienced a larger
5 Moreover, analyses performed over participants with complete data produced
highly similar results indicating no relationships with measurement attrition.
6 The PTQ as a measure of RNT with items that do not refer to a disorder-specific
content was chosen as a mediator, yet mediation analyses were also carried out for
the other two measures of RNT (PSWQ and RRS).

 number of life events compared to participants in the group
intervention (M ¼ 4.28, SD ¼ 2.34, p ¼ 0.01) and internet inter-
vention conditions (M ¼ 4.21, SD ¼ 2.44, p ¼ 0.01). We therefore
entered this variable as a covariate in the main analyses. Differences
between conditions in the number of life events at the 12 m FU
assessment just missed significance, F (2, 205) ¼ 3.024, p ¼ 0.05,
but were nevertheless also entered as a covariate to account for
potential influences. Thirty-five participants had received addi-
tional psychological treatment and 24 participants had taken
additional
(psycho)pharmacological
treatment
during
the
FU
period (allergies: n ¼ 6, pain medication: n ¼ 5, stomach problems:
n ¼ 3, Crohn's disease: n ¼ 1, ADHD: n ¼ 6, sleep medication: n ¼ 2,
anti-depressants: n ¼ 2), but there were no differences between
conditions, c2 (2) ¼ 0.75, p ¼ 0.69, and c2 (2) ¼ 3.47, p ¼ 0.18.
Descriptives for RNT and symptom severity measures per condition
are presented in Table 2. There were no significant differences be-
tween conditions at the pre-intervention assessment (ps ¼ 0.09 to
0.99), on any of these measures.
3.2. Intervention attrition
The percentage of non-starters was not significantly different
between the two active conditions (group: 6.1%; internet: 9.9%), c2
(2) ¼ 3.03, p ¼ 0.08. However, participants who had started the
group intervention attended significantly more sessions (M ¼ 4.59;
SD ¼ 1.43) than starters in the internet condition (M ¼ 3.96;
SD ¼ 1.65), t (147) ¼ 2.28, p ¼ 0.02, d ¼ 0.38.
3.3. Effect of the intervention on measures of repetitive negative
thinking
Both versions of the preventive intervention demonstrated
medium to large effects in the reduction of RNT, whereas the
waitlist control group demonstrated no to small effects in the
reduction of RNT (see Table 2). The two intervention groups led to
significantly greater reductions in RNT than the control group, with
no significant differences between the two active conditions (see
Table 3).
3.4. Effect of the intervention on symptom measures
Both the group intervention and internet intervention led to
reductions in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and general distress
that were maintained over time, whereas no significant reductions
were found in the control group (see Table 2). For all measures, the
intervention groups demonstrated superiority to the control group
(see Table 3). However, there were no significant differences be-
tween the intervention groups and the waitlist control group in the
reduction of bulimia symptoms and binge drinking. For all outcome
measures, symptom reduction did not differ between the group
RFCBT intervention and the internet RFCBT intervention. 7,8
3.5. Effect of the intervention on prevalence of depression and GAD
Survival analysis indicated a significantly lower prevalence of
depression at 12 m FU in the intervention conditions (group: 15.3%,
internet: 14.7%) compared to the waitlist control group (32.4%) (see
Fig. 2), Wald c2 (1) ¼ 4.89, p ¼ 0.03, hazard ratio ¼ 2.12 (95% CI,
1.09e4.13). Similarly, a second survival analysis also indicated a
significantly lower prevalence of GAD in the intervention condi-
tions (group: 18.0%, internet: 16.0%) compared to the waitlist con-
trol group (42.2%) (see Fig. 3), Wald c2 (1) ¼ 9.07, p ¼ 0.003, hazard
ratio ¼ 2.52 (95% CI, 1.38e4.59). There were no differences in the
prevalence of disorders between the two versions of the preventive
intervention for depression, Wald c2 (1) ¼ 0.02, p ¼ 0.88, and GAD,
Wald c2 (1) ¼ 1.38, p ¼ 0.58. 9
3.6. Mediation
3.6.1. Depression
The significant effect of condition on pre to post-intervention
changes in RNT was estimated at 4.83, p < 0.001. The significant
effect of pre to post-intervention changes in RNT on the prevalence
of major depression at the 12 m FU assessment was equal to 0.05,
p < 0.001. The direct effect of condition on the prevalence of major
depression was not significant (0.364, p ¼ 0.49). The total indirect
effect of condition on the prevalence of major depression at 12 m
FU was significant, Z ¼ 0.232, p ¼ 0.003, and the true indirect effect
was estimated to lie between 0.099 and 0.417 with 95% CI. Because
zero is not in the 95% CI, it can be concluded that the indirect effect
is significantly different from zero at p < 0.05 and, thus, that change
in RNT from pre-to post-intervention mediated the relationship
between condition and prevalence rates of major depression at
12 m FU. The ratio of the indirect effect to the total effect suggests
that reductions in RNT explained 38.9% of the effect on the preva-
lence of major depression.
3.6.2. GAD
The significant effect of pre to post-intervention changes in RNT
on the prevalence of GAD at the 12 m FU assessment was equal to
0.05, p < 0.001. The direct effect of condition on the prevalence of
GAD was not significant (0.290, p ¼ 0.22). The total indirect effect of
condition on the prevalence of GAD at 12 m FU was significant,
Z ¼ 0.237, p ¼ 0.002, and the true indirect effect was estimated to lie
between 0.109 and 0.408 with 95% CI. Because zero is not in the 95%
CI, it can be concluded that the indirect effect is significantly
different from zero at p < 0.05 and, thus, that change in RNT from
pre-to post-intervention mediated the relationship between con-
dition and prevalence rates of GAD at 12 m FU. The ratio of the
indirect effect to the total effect suggests that reductions in RNT
7 As explained in the method section, note that we used contrast coding to
compare the combined effect of the preventive interventions against waitlist control
for the measures of RNT and symptom levels. The coding we used also allowed us to
compare the preventive interventions against each other, yet the contrasts did not
allow us to compare each of the interventions separately to waitlist control.
Separate group intervention vs. waitlist and internet intervention vs. waitlist
comparisons showed a similar pattern of results, except for the effect of reductions
in the anxious arousal scale of the MASQ which showed no significant difference in
the internet intervention group compared to waitlist control (p ¼ 0.09).
8 Although the number of sessions attended was higher for participants in the
group intervention versus participants in the internet intervention, there were no
significant differences between interventions on RNT and symptom levels over
time. Analyses exploring whether the mode of delivery (internet, group) and time
interacted with demographic variables or initial RNT and symptoms levels showed
no significant results (all p's < 0.05), and thereby provided no information on who
benefited most from the internet versus group mode of delivery.
9 As we did for the measures of RNT and symptom levels, we also ran analyses in
which we separately compared each of the preventive interventions to the waitlist
control condition. For the internet intervention condition, there was a significantly
lower prevalence of depression, Wald c2 (1) ¼ 3.94, p ¼ 0.04, hazard ratio ¼ 2.36
(95% CI, 1.01e5.52), and GAD, Wald c2 (1) ¼ 9.12, p < 0.01, hazard ratio ¼ 3.55 (95%
CI, 1.56e8.09), compared to the waitlist control group. However, for the group
intervention condition compared to waitlist control, we did not find any differences
in the prevalence of depression, Wald c2 (1) ¼ 2.34, p ¼ 0.13, hazard ratio ¼ 1.91
(95% CI, 0.83e4.40), and GAD, Wald c2 (1) ¼ 2.51, p ¼ 0.11, hazard ratio ¼ 1.77 (95%
CI, 0.87e3.60).

 explained 45% of the effect on the prevalence of GAD. 10
3.7. Acceptability of the intervention
The majority of participants allocated to the preventive inter-
vention indicated that the training was adequate for their problems
(group: 87%; internet: 93%), and that the trainers were sufficiently
proficient (group: 94%; internet: 92%), could be trusted (group:
100%; internet: 98%), and were respectful (group: 100%; internet:
97%). Participants in the group condition provided an overall rating
of 8.2 (SD ¼ 0.75; 1e10 scale), whereas the mean rating was 7.9
(SD ¼ 0.52) in the internet condition.
4. Discussion
The present study is the first randomized controlled trial
investigating the efficacy of a preventive intervention for depres-
sion and anxiety that specifically and explicitly focuses on reducing
RNT. Our results demonstrate that both versions of the new pre-
ventive intervention reduced the tendency to engage in RNT as well
as symptom levels of anxiety and depression, whereas only mini-
mal change took place in the waitlist control group. These inter-
vention effects were maintained at 3 m and 12 m FU. Similarly, the
prevalence of depression at 12 m FU was as high as 32.4% for par-
ticipants on the waitlist, whereas depression prevalence rates for
participants who had been offered the preventive intervention
were reduced to 14.7%e15.3%. This translates into a 45e47%
reduction in depressive disorders achieved by our preventive
intervention. This compares favorably to the average decrease in
incidence of 21% achieved in past depression prevention trials
according to the recent meta-analysis by Van Zoonen et al. (2014),
and is consistent with the effects of a small number of earlier
prevention trials (e.g., Brent et al., 2015; Clarke et al., 1995; Stice,
Rohde, Gau, & Wade, 2010). Similarly, the prevalence of GAD at
12 m FU was 42.2% in the waitlist condition compared to 16e18% in
the intervention conditions, which translated into a 38e43%
reduction in GAD. To our knowledge, this is the first trial investi-
gating prevention of GAD, and our findings show that targeting the
transdiagnostic risk factor for RNT can reduce the prevalence of
depression and GAD to a similar degree. Importantly, our results
also support assumptions regarding mechanisms of change in the
new intervention as reductions in worry and rumination were
shown to mediate the effects of the interventions on the prevalence
rate of major depression and GAD.
Both types of preventive interventions enabled participants to
reduce their tendency to engage in worry and rumination towards
normal levels, according to recently reported norms and de-
scriptives for the PSWQ, RRS, and PTQ (Ehring et al., 2012; Topper,
Emmelkamp, Watkins, & Ehring, 2014a,b; Van der Heiden, Muris,
Bos, Van der Molen, & Oostra, 2009). The between-group effect
sizes for the symptom measures of depression and anxiety range
from 0.36 to 0.72. These effect sizes are larger than those reported
in recent meta-analyses of universal, selective, and indicated pre-
ventive interventions for depression and anxiety disorders (Topper
et al., 2010). Participants who had been offered either variant of the
prevention program were at least 2.5 times less likely to report a
diagnosis of depression or GAD within the next year. Note that the
results on prevalence levels of depression and GAD were somewhat
weaker for the group intervention compared to the internet
intervention. Survival analyses comparing each of the interventions
separately to the waitlist control intervention showed no signifi-
cantly reduced prevalence levels for the group intervention,
whereas prevalence levels remained significantly lower for the
internet intervention condition. However, from this result, it cannot
be concluded that the internet intervention is more effective than

 the group intervention. Both interventions resulted in similar re-
ductions of RNT and symptom levels, and although the hazard ra-
tios were still indicative of a preventive effect for participants in the
group intervention condition, the study was not sufficiently pow-
ered to detect this effect.
Together, the findings reported in this study point towards the
potential value of this prevention program for clinical practice. On a
more general level, the findings underscore the potential value of
targeted prevention programs focused on modifiable risk factors as
a means to improve the field of prevention.
One of the proposed advantages of the present targeted
approach was the possibility to affect multiple symptom clusters as
a consequence of the transdiagnostic status of RNT. These trans-
diagnostic effects were observed to the extent that the intervention
changed the course of both depression and anxiety symptoms.
However, one finding in the current study undermines the trans-
diagnostic status of RNT. The transdiagnostic effects did not extend
to bulimic symptoms and alcohol abuse. An explanation for this
finding could be that RNT is a more important risk factor for anxiety
and depression than for bulimia and alcohol abuse. However, this is
at odds with a recent study demonstrating that rumination in fe-
male adolescents predicts increases in bulimic and substance abuse
symptoms at least as well as it predicts increases in depressive
symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2007). A more plausible
explanation for the symptom-dependent effects in this trial con-
cerns lifetime prevalence data on mental disorders. The prevalence
rates for bulimia and alcohol abuse are well below the rates for
anxiety disorder and depression (Swanson, Crow, Le Grange,
Swendsen, & Merikangas, 2011). Therefore, larger sample sizes
are required to demonstrate effects for the former two symptoms.
Furthermore, future studies should include a more thorough
assessment of bulimic symptoms and alcohol abuse, as current
measures were very brief and may lack content validity.
Although the number of sessions completed was lower in the
internet version of the program, the efficacy was nevertheless at
least as good as in the group version on all outcome measures,
which
replicates
earlier
findings
on
internet
interventions
(Richardson, Stallard, & Velleman, 2010). This suggests that the
efficacy of the new intervention is independent of the mode of
delivery, which may facilitate dissemination to different contexts.
Although cost-effectiveness is often mentioned as one of the ad-
vantages of internet interventions in the literature (Christensen
et al., 2014), it should be noted that a guided online intervention
(as opposed to online self-help interventions) is relatively time
consuming and may not be more time efficient than a group ses-
sion, as trainers reported to have spent at least 20 min to provide
feedback on each completed internet session.
The current findings need to be considered in light of a number
of limitations. First, all participants were actively recruited via
screening procedures and advertisements and thus might not have
participated in the preventive intervention on their own. It is,
however, likely that future implementation will adopt a similar
approach. Routine screening procedures at secondary schools car-
ried out by mental health organizations are common practice in the
Netherlands. Increased stigma as a result of participation in a tar-
geted prevention program has arisen as a major point of concern
(Offord, Kraemer, Kazdin, Jensen, & Harrington, 1998). Yet, levels of
perceived
stigma
related
to
participation
in
preventive
in-
terventions have been reported to be very low (Rapee et al., 2006),
and can be circumvented by delivering intervention outside school-
hours, either via internet or at a different location than the school
setting. The focus on targeting worry in this intervention may also
reduce stigma and enhance engagement as worry is a common
experience that young people can easily identify with, without
necessarily having connotations of mental illness.
Second, participants’ past history of psychopathological di-
agnoses were not assessed upon entry into this study. Therefore, it
cannot be established whether the effects observed concern the
prevention of first episodes of depression and GAD vs. relapse/
recurrence. Third, although we aimed to test the effect of this
preventive intervention across multiple symptom clusters, we were
unable to include all potentially relevant groups of symptoms. For
example, future studies should include a measure of social anxiety
as social anxiety disorder is both prevalent in adolescents and
young adults and related to RNT (Ehring & Watkins, 2008). Fourth,
participants were mainly female and all prepared for or attended
university, which may limit the generalizability of our findings.
However, a predominance of female participants is a natural
consequence of the risk factors screened for in this study. Alongside
higher prevalence rates for depression and anxiety disorders
(Bekker & van Mens-Verhulst, 2007), females consistently report
higher levels of worry and rumination (Robichaud, Dugas, &
Conway, 2003). Fifth, diagnostic interviews were not conducted
during the assessments and the observed effects solely relied on
self-report measures. Moreover, these self-report measures only
assessed the point prevalence of a diagnosis of depression and GAD.
The period between assessments was ignored, which may reduce
sensitivity to a diagnosis of depression and GAD. The high preva-
lence of depression and generalized anxiety disorder at 1-year
follow-up (32.4% and 42.2% respectively in the waitlist control
group) could be due to the increased risks arising from selecting a
sample with elevated worry and rumination, although we need to
be cautious about false positives because of the reliance on self-
report questionnaire data only. To obtain insight into how excep-
tional the prevalence rates of depression and GAD are, it is tempting
to compare them to what is observed in other prevention trials.
However, it will be difficult to conclude anything from this com-
parison, because of the preselection (elevated levels of RNT) that
has taken place before participants were enrolled in this trial,
which was especially chosen because RNT is a risk factor for anxiety
and depression, and, as such, we anticipated high prevalence of
depression and GAD in this high-risk sample. Previous selective
prevention trials have used different inclusion criteria and any
difference that may result from this comparison could signify the
high risk to develop depression or GAD for individuals with
elevated levels of RNT, as well as any false positive rates from self-
reported measures. Note, however, that high false-positives on both
self-report measures do not explain the differential prevalence
rates reported between the waitlist control and the active in-
terventions. Nevertheless, to overcome this limitation of potential
false positives, future trials on the efficacy of this intervention
should aim to include interview measures for clinical diagnoses.
Sixth, we used a waitlist control condition, as opposed to an
active or attention control condition. In future trials, we recom-
mend the use of a placebo condition or an attention control, as it
will enable determination of the extent to which the benefits of the
RFCBT interventions are due to non-specific effects such as positive
expectancy versus specific effects of the interventions. Finally,
preventive effects were assessed up to 1 year after intervention,
whereas it would be interesting to see the potential of this pre-
ventive intervention over the longer term. Results therefore need to
be replicated using structured clinical interviews and longer-term
follow-up intervals.
Despite these limitations, the results of this randomized
controlled trial provide the first indication of the efficacy for a
preventive intervention for anxiety disorders and depression tar-
geting excessive worry and rumination. On a broader level, this
study adds to emerging evidence for selective prevention programs
targeting transdiagnostic risk factors as a promising approach to
advance the field of prevention.
