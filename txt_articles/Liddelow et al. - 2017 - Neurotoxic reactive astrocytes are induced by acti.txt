Summary
Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease but 
their role is poorly understood. Here we show that A1 reactive astrocytes are induced by 
classically-activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1s 
by secreting Il-1α, TNFα, and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient 
to induce A1s. A1s lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and 
phagocytosis, and induce death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS 
neurons in vivo is prevented when A1 formation is blocked. Finally, we show that A1s are highly 
present in human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, 
ALS, and Multiple Sclerosis. Taken together these findings explain why CNS neurons die after 
axotomy, strongly suggest that A1s help to drive death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in 
neurodegenerative disorders, and point the way forward for developing new treatments of these 
diseases.
Introduction
Astrocytes are abundant cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that provide trophic 
support for neurons, promote formation and function of synapses, and prune synapses by 
phagocytosis, in addition to fulfilling a range of other homeostatic maintenance functions1–4. 
Astrocytes undergo a dramatic transformation called “reactive astrocytosis” after brain 
injury and disease and up-regulate many genes5,6 and form a glial scar after acute CNS 
trauma1,6,7. Functions of reactive astrocytes have been a subject of some debate, with 
previous studies showing they both hinder and support CNS recovery1,6–9. It has not been 
clear under what contexts they may be helpful or harmful and many questions remain about 
their functions.
We previously purified and gene profiled reactive astrocytes from mice treated either with a 
systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or received middle cerebral artery occlusion 
to induce ischemia5. We found neuroinflammation and ischemia induced two different types 
of reactive astrocytes that we termed “A1” and “A2” respectively (in analogy to the “M1”/
“M2” macrophage nomenclature, a nomenclature under current refinement because 
macrophages clearly can display more than two polarization states8,9). A1s highly up-
regulate many classical complement cascade genes previously shown to be destructive to

 synapses, so we postulated that A1s might be harmful. In contrast, A2s up-regulated many 
neurotrophic factors and we thus postulated that A2s are protective. Consistent with this 
latter possibility, previous studies have provided evidence that reactive astrocytes induced by 
ischemia promote CNS recovery and repair1,10,11.
Here we show that A1 reactive astrocytes are induced by activated microglia. A1s lose most 
normal astrocyte functions but gain a new neurotoxic function, rapidly killing neurons and 
mature differentiated oligodendrocytes. We show A1s rapidly form in vivo after CNS injury 
and are highly present in many human neurodegenerative diseases. Lastly we show that 
inhibition of A1 reactive astrocyte formation after acute CNS injury, prevents death of 
axotomized neurons. Thus A1 reactive astrocytes are harmful, contributing to neuron death 
after acute CNS injury. Understanding the multidimensional roles of reactive astrocytes has 
great potential to contribute to development of new treatment strategies to reduce CNS cell 
loss and neurological impairment after acute CNS injury as well as in neurodegenerative 
diseases.
1. Screen for cellular and molecular inducers of the A1 phenotype
We first investigated whether microglia induce A1 reactive astrocytes because LPS is a 
strong inducer of A1s1 and is an activator of TLR4 signaling, a receptor expressed 
specifically by microglial in the rodent CNS12–15. We took advantage of Csf1r−/− knock-out 
mice that lack microglia16 (Extended Data Fig. 1) to ask whether A1s can be produced 
without microglia. To assess astrocyte reactivity, we used a microfluidic qPCR screen to 
determine gene expression changes in astrocytes purified by immunopanning from saline- 
and LPS-treated wild type control or Csf1r−/− mice. As expected, wild-type littermate 
controls had a normal response to LPS injection5,17, with robust induction of an A1 response 
(Fig. 1a), however astrocytes from Csf1r−/− mice failed to activate A1s. These findings show 
reactive microglia are required to induce A1 reactive astrocytes in vivo.
To determine what microglia-secreted signals induce A1s, we next performed a screen to 
individually test various candidate molecules. We used immunopanning18 to prepare highly 
pure populations of resting (non-reactive) astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). We cultured 
purified astrocytes in serum-free conditions and tested effects of various molecules on gene 
expression using our microfluidic assay. As a control, we first investigated if astrocytes in 
culture can respond to LPS and found they do not (Extended Data Fig. 2). This was expected 
as rodent astrocytes lack receptors and downstream signaling components required for LPS-
activation (TLR4 and MYD88)12–14. We found however, that several cytokines could induce 
some, but not all, A1 reactive genes. Our best inducers of a partial A1 phenotype were 
interleukin 1 alpha (Il-1α), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and complement 
component 1, q subcomponent (C1q,). When purified astrocytes were cultured with all three 
cytokines, astrocytes exhibited an A1 phenotype nearly identical to the A1 phenotype 
induced by LPS in vivo (Fig. 1a). All three of these cytokines are highly expressed 
specifically by microglia13,15, again suggesting a critical role for microglia in inducing A1 
reactive astrocytes.

 2. Reactive microglia induce A1 reactive astrocytes by secreting Il-1α, 
TNFα and C1q
To further confirm that microglia induce A1 reactive astrocytes, we purified microglia by 
immunopanning and cultured astrocytes in control microglia conditioned medium (MCM) or 
MCM from microglia that had first been made reactive with LPS. LPS-activated MCM, but 
not resting MCM, strongly induced A1 reactive astrocytes (Fig. 1a). The level to which these 
transcripts were induced was comparable to that seen in vivo following systemic LPS 
injection5 (Extended Data Fig. 3).
To verify which cytokines microglia use to signal A1 induction, we purified microglia by 
immunopanning and determined which cytokines are secreted by resting and LPS-activated 
microglia. Levels of Il-1α, TNFα and C1q were all significantly elevated after microglial 
activation (Fig. 1b, c). Il-1β secretion also increased in LPS-activated MCM, but was unable 
to induce expression of A1 transcripts (Fig. 1a). We also tested a range of other microglia-
secreted cytokines that were unable to induce A1s (Extended Data Fig. 2). The combination 
of Il-1α, TNFα and C1q however, closely mimicked that of LPS-reactive MCM (Fig. 1a).
To ensure no other factors secreted by LPS-activated microglia could also make A1s, we 
collected LPS-activated MCM and pre-treated it with neutralizing antibodies to Il-1α, 
TNFα, and C1q. This pre-treated MCM was unable to induce reactive astrocyte genes (Fig. 
1a, Extended Data Fig. 3e). Thus Il-1α, TNFα and C1q together are sufficient to induce the 
A1 phenotype, and are necessary for LPS-reactive microglia to induce A1s in vitro.
Does cessation of Il-1α, TNFα, and C1q signaling enable A1 reactive astrocytes in vitro to 
revert back to resting astrocytes or is the A1 phenotype stable? To find out, we removed all 
three cytokines from A1 cultures, and added neutralizing antibodies to all three to make sure 
they were fully inhibited. After 7 days, we assessed levels of A1 transcripts and found the 
A1 phenotype remained. As a proof of principal, we also investigated if additional molecules 
could revert A1s to a non-reactive phenotype. We tested the anti-inflammatory cytokine 
TGFβ and FGF (as it has been previously shown that astrocyte activation is suppressed in 
the injured brain by FGF signaling19). We grew A1s in culture, then treated with TGFβ or 
FGF and found both significantly decreased reactive astrocyte transcript levels (Fig. 1d, 
Extended Data Fig. 3). Whether or not there are additional signaling processes that can 
revert A1s in vivo is an important question for future studies.
We next investigated if genetic deficiency of Il-1α, TNFα, or C1q would be sufficient to 
prevent A1 astrocyte reactivity in vivo. First we checked if single knock mice (Il-1α−/−, 
TNFα−/−, or C1q−/−) were still able to produce neuroinflammatory reactive microglia 
following systemic LPS injection. Using qPCR we saw microglia from these animals still 
had many reactive transcripts15 highly upregulated 24 h following LPS injection (Extended 
Data Fig. 4). We next used astrocytes purified from these same mice and used our 
microfluidic qPCR screen to determine whether they were reactive. Each knock-out mouse 
had significantly decreased A1 astrocyte reactivity (Fig. 1e). Additionally, we looked at 
double (Il-1α−/−TNFα−/−) and triple knock-out mice (Il-1α−/−TNFα−/−C1q−/−) and saw 
decreases in A1 reactivity, with triple knock-out animals having no response following

 systemic LPS injection (Fig. 1e). Microglia from these same knock-out mice still upregulate 
inflammatory mediators in response to LPS injection, but simply fail to release A1 initiators 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). Taken together our data show that microglia-derived Il-1α, TNFα, 
and C1q work together to mediate A1 reactive astrocytes.
3. A1 reactive astrocytes lose many normal astrocyte functions
A1 reactive astrocytes have decreased synaptic functions
Can A1 reactive astrocytes induce formation of functional synapses in vitro? We cultured 
purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with resting or A1 reactive astrocytes and quantified 
synapse number by double immunostaining for pre- and post-synaptic proteins (Fig. 2a, 
Extended Data Fig. 5). RGCs cultured with A1s had 50% less synapses compared to those 
grown with control astrocytes (Fig. 2b). When RGCs were cultured with control astrocytes 
to induce synapse formation and then cultured with A1s, synapse number significantly 
decreased by about 40%, suggesting that A1s are either unable to maintain these synapses or 
actively disassemble them.
Astrocytes induce formation of excitatory synapses by secreting GPCG4/620, SPARCL121, 
and thrombospondins (THBS1/2)22, so we next investigated whether reactive astrocytes still 
produce these factors. Quantitative PCR showed decreased Gpc6 and Sparcl1, while 
simultaneously showing increased expression of Thbs1/2 (Fig. 2c). This increase in 
thrombospondins (which should increase synaptic number) suggests the decreased synapse 
number may reflect an A1-induced toxicity to synapses (see below). To determine effects of 
A1 reactive astrocytes on synapse function we used whole-cell patch clamp recording on 
RGCs cultured with resting astrocytes or A1s. RGCs cultured with A1s had significantly 
decreased frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents when 
compared to RGCs cultured with resting astrocytes (Fig. 2d–g). Taken together these results 
show A1 reactive astrocytes induce formation of fewer synapses, and the few synapses they 
do induce are significantly weaker when compared to those produced by healthy resting 
astrocytes.
A1 reactive astrocytes have decreased phagocytic capacity
To compare phagocytic ability of normal and A1 astrocytes, we measured engulfment of 
purified synaptosomes. A1s engulfed 50–75% fewer synaptosomes than control astrocytes 
(Fig. 3a,b). Similarly, we found control astrocytes are able to robustly phagocytose myelin 
debris, but upon conversion to an A1 reactive phenotype almost completely lose this 
capacity (Fig. 3a,c). This phagocytic deficit corresponded with a 90% decrease in Mertk and 
60% decrease in Megf10 mRNA, phagocytic receptors we have previously found mediate 
synaptic phagocytosis3 (Fig. 3f). To determine whether A1s also display decreased 
phagocytic ability in vivo, we used Aldh1l1-eGFP transgenic mice and LPS injection 
(Extended Data Fig. 6) to visualize phagocytosis of Alexa594-conjugated cholera toxin-β, 
CTB-594, labelled synapses by control and A1 astrocytes. Confocal microscopy was used to 
visualize engulfed CTB-labelled synapses inside Aldh1l1-eGFP fluorescent astrocytes as we 
previously reported3. We found A1 reactive astrocytes in the LGN in vivo show the same 
significant loss of synaptic engulfment ability (around 50% compared to astrocytes in saline-

 treated control animals) as was seen in our in vitro assay (Fig. 3a,b,d,e). Combined, these 
data show A1 reactive astrocytes have deficiencies in phagocytosis of both synaptosomes 
and myelin debris in culture, that this deficiency can also influence efficiency of synaptic 
pruning in vivo, and suggest that A1s may well lose the capacity to clear myelin debris in 
vivo, an important area for future investigation.
4. A1 reactive astrocytes are powerfully neurotoxic
Normally astrocytes promote CNS neuronal survival23. To determine whether A1s also 
promote neuronal survival, we co-cultured control and A1 reactive astrocytes with purified 
RGCs and measured viability. We found RGCs rapidly died when grown with increasing 
concentrations of A1 reactive astrocyte conditioned media (ACM, Fig. 4a,c). At the highest 
concentrations there was almost 100% death of cells (Fig. 4c). A1s were similarly toxic to 
cortical neurons, embryonic spinal motor neurons, and mature differentiated 
oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4b,d), however even at high doses spinal motor neurons remained 
around 20% viable; we found that preganglionic and gamma motor neurons were not 
susceptible to A1-induced toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 7m). Although not toxic to 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells, A1s were able to slow their differentiation and division 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). In addition, we tested susceptibility of human dopaminergic neurons 
to A1-induced toxicity and found that, like rodent cells, they also showed decreased viability 
with 25% of human dopaminergic cells dying due to A1-induced toxicity (Fig. 4e). This 
death could not be attributed to Il-1α, TNFα, and C1q alone, which did not cause death of 
cells in purified cultures. Death was blocked by caspase-2/-3 inhibitors but not by 
necrostatin or glutamate blockers and thus appeared to be due to apoptosis (Extended Data 
Fig. 9). Thus, A1s secrete a soluble toxin that rapidly kills a subset of CNS neurons and 
mature oligodendrocytes, but not other CNS cell types.
5. Death of CNS neurons after axotomy in vivo is prevented by inhibiting A1 
reactive astrocyte formation
It has been a longstanding mystery why CNS neurons die after axotomy. One idea has been 
that axotomy interrupts a retrograde neurotrophic signal. Because injured spinal cords 
contain neuroinflammatory microglia and/or macrophages24, we hypothesized axotomy 
could also induce formation of A1s which in turn kill axotomized neurons. We used optic 
nerve crush (ONC) in postnatal rats and mice as a model system. ONC rapidly induced 
robust A1 generation that was temporally paired with death of RGCs (Fig. 4i–o). Weekly 
injection of neutralizing antibodies to Il-1α, TNFα, and C1q together into the vitreous of the 
eye from the time of injury inhibited A1 formation and prevented death of RGCs at least as 
long as 14 days post-ONC (Fig. 4g–j). Finally, we performed optic nerve crushes in double 
(Il-1α−/−TNFα−/−) and triple (Il-1α−/−TNFα−/−C1q−/−) knock-out mice that fail to generate 
A1s, and found that 7 days following optic nerve crush RGCs remained viable unlike their 
wild-type control counterparts (Fig. 4k). These data provide strong evidence that death of 
RGCs after axotomy is not due to trophic deprivation but is instead due to release of a toxic 
signal from nearby neurotoxic A1 reactive astrocytes.

 6. A1 reactive astrocytes in human disease
Because A1s are induced after injury and by LPS (a well-described neurodegeneration 
sensitizer that causes extensive neuroinflammation25,26), and because reactive microglia are 
found in neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated whether A1s are present in human 
neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Because complement component C3 is 
one of the most characteristic and highly upregulated genes in A1s and is not expressed by 
ischemic A2 reactive astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 10), we carried out in-situ hybridization 
and immunochemistry on post-mortem tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 
Huntington’s disease (HD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) to identify whether there are C3-expressing A1 astrocytes in 
these diseases. We found many GFAP and S100β positive astrocytes that were C3 positive 
(either in situ or immunofluorescent) in regions traditionally associated with each disease 
(Fig. 5), and qPCR analysis confirmed upregulation of C3 in postmortem tissue samples. In 
demyelinating lesions of MS, C3-positive astrocytes were typically closely associated with 
CD68 positive activated microglia/macrophages (Fig. 5; Extended Data Fig. 11). In human 
AD, nearly 60% of GFAP positive astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex were positive for C3, 
suggesting that A1 activated astrocytes make up a large proportion of astrocytes in AD in 
CNS regions affected by neurodegeneration, and may thus be integral for disease initiation 
and progression. In addition to C3, reactive astrocytes in these diseases were also 
immunoreactive for several other A1 specific markers (Extended Data Fig. 11). These 
findings demonstrate that A1-like reactive astrocytes are present in most major 
neurodegenerative diseases, where they are likely to help to drive neurodegeneration.
7. Concluding Remarks
Here we have identified A1 neurotoxic reactive astrocyte formation as a fundamental 
pathological response of the CNS to LPS-induced neuroinflammation, acute CNS injury, and 
most or all neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings identify a new role for activated 
microglia in inducing A1s via secretion of Il-1α, TNFα, and C1q in vitro and in vivo. In 
contrast to A2 reactive astrocytes, which are induced by ischemia5 and strongly promote 
neuronal survival and tissue repair10,27–29, A1s secrete a neurotoxin that induces rapid death 
of neurons and oligodendrocytes. A1s have lost many characteristic astrocyte functions 
including: ability to promote neuronal survival and outgrowth, promote synapse formation 
and function, and to phagocytose synapses and myelin debris. A1s are rapidly induced after 
acute CNS injury and responsible for the death of axotomized RGCs. A1s are also highly 
present in neurodegenerative diseases where their presence may well contribute to 
neurodegeneration and help to drive disease progression.
These findings raise important questions. First, what is the identity of the neurotoxin? We 
are presently using biochemical approaches to purify and characterize it. Second, to what 
extent are A1s present in spinal cord injury, CNS brain trauma, and other neuroinflammatory 
and neurodegenerative diseases, and are A1s actively driving death of neurons, axons, and 
synapses and/or oligodendrocytes in these diseases? Astrocytes have been found to be toxic 
to spinal motor neurons in ALS30,31 – do they have an A1 phenotype? In Alzheimer’s 
disease, oligomeric amyloid beta is a strong activator of microglia32 and our findings 
Liddelow et al.

 provide evidence that A1s are present in regions of neurodegeneration in human post 
mortem tissue. Although we found that activated microglia were insufficient by themselves 
to kill neurons, they strongly induce A1s, which could drive neurodegeneration not only by 
secreting a neurotoxin but by releasing multiple complement components that help to drive 
synapse degeneration33. In acute relapsing and remitting MS, we also observed C3-
expressing A1s in demyelinating plaques. This suggests the possibility that demyelinating 
lesions, which generally also contain unmyelinated axons and OPCs, fail to remyelinate 
because A1s inhibit OPC proliferation and differentiation and kill any newly-generated 
oligodendrocytes (in the chronic progressive phase of the disease A1s might also drive axon 
degeneration). Would drugs that prevent or revert A1 formation or block action of the A1 
neurotoxin prevent neurodegeneration in these diseases and stimulate spontaneous 
remyelination in MS and new synapse formation in diseases such as Alzheimer’s? Similarly, 
would drugs that prevent or revert A1s save axotomized CNS neurons after spinal cord 
injury and promote regeneration by stimulating growth and allowing these astrocytes to clear 
myelin debris? Future studies should test these possibilities in animal models, as antibody 
drugs that inhibit human IL-1α and TNFα are already FDA approved and in use for other 
medical conditions. Lastly, do epithelial cells outside the CNS undergo an A1-like 
neurotoxic transformation after injury or disease that contributes to cell death of non-CNS 
cell types, for instance beta islet cells in diabetes?
A mystery is why the injured and diseased CNS would ever produce a neurotoxic reactive 
astrocyte. Although A1s are not directly toxic to bacteria, they do secrete many classical 
complement cascade components that are expected to greatly enhance clearance of bacteria 
by the immune system. Similarly, future studies should address whether A1s can recognize 
and kill virally-infected neurons in order to prevent spread of CNS viral infections, and 
whether A1s might control CNS immune response by recruiting or killing specific 
infiltrating immune cell types. Whatever the answers, new drugs that prevent A1 formation, 
promote A1 reversion, or block the A1 neurotoxin, hold great potential to treat a variety of 
chronic neurological diseases and acute CNS injuries.

Methods Summary
All Procedure were conducted in accordance with the animal care standards of the National 
Institute of Health and approved by Stanford University’s Administrative Panel on 
Laboratory Animal Care. Astrocytes and all other CNS cells were purified from postnatal 
day 5 rat or mouse cortex and cultured in serum-free conditions. All experiments with 
mutants were performed blindly without knowledge of their genotype.
Animals
Sprague Dawley rats were from Charles River. TNFα−/− (B6.129S-Tnftm1Gkl/J) transgenic 
mice and wild type C57BL/6J mice were from Jackson Laboratories. C1q(a)−/− (C57BL/6) 
were from previous studies in our lab34. Il-1α−/− mice were a gift from Dr Russell E. Vance, 
UC Berkeley. Tg(Aldh1l1-EGFP)OFC789Gsat/Mmucd mice were used to visualize 
astrocytes in in vivo phagocytic assays. Double (Il-1α−/− TNFα−/−) and triple (Il-1α−/−

 TNFα−/−C1q−/−) animals were developed in-house. All lines were maintained by breeding 
with C57BL/6 mice. Animals were randomly assigned numbers and evaluated thereafter 
blind (to both experimental condition and genotype).
Immunopanning and cell culture
Astrocytes were purified by immunopanning from postnatal day 5 rats or mice (see above) 
forebrains and cultured as previously described18. Briefly, cortices were enzymatically 
(papain) then mechanically dissociated to generate a single cell suspension that was 
incubated on successive negative immunopanning plates to remove microglia, endothelial 
cells, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells before positively selecting for astrocytes with an 
Itgb5-coated panning plate. Isolated astrocytes were cultured in a defined, serum-free base 
media containing 50% neurobasal, 50% DMEM, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml 
streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 292 μg/ml L-glutamine, 1× SATO and 5 μg/ml of N-
acetyl cysteine. This media was supplemented with the astrocyte-required survival factor 
HBEGF (Peprotech, 100–47) at 5ng/ml as previously descried18. A similar immunopanning 
protocol was used for other central nervous system cell types, with positive selection using 
THY1 (cortical neurons), 192 hybridoma clone (embryonic spinal motor neurons35), CD31 
(endothelial cells36), O4 (oligodendrocyte lineage cells), PDGFRβ (pericytes37), CD45 
(microglia/macrophages). A1 reactive astrocytes were generated in vitro by growing purified 
astrocytes for 6 days and then treating for 24 h with Il-1α (3 ng/ml, Sigma, I3901), TNFα 
(30 ng/ml, Cell Signaling Technology, 8902SF), and C1q (400 ng/ml, MyBioSource, 
MBS143105).
Microfluidic qPCR (pooled cell samples)
Total RNA was extracted from immunopanned cells using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) and 
cDNA synthesis performed using the SuperScript® VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, 
Grand Island, NY, USA) according to supplier protocols. We designed primers using NCBI 
primer blast software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) and selected primer 
pairs with least probability of amplifying nonspecific products as predicted by NCBI primer 
blast. All primers had 90–105% efficiency. We designed primer pairs to amplify products 
that span exon–exon junctions to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. We tested the 
specificity of the primer pairs by PCR with rat and mouse whole-brain cDNA (prepared 
fresh), and examined PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis. For microfluidic qRT-
PCR, 1.25 μl of each cDNA sample was pre-amplified using 2.5 μl of 2× Taqman pre-
amplification master mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1.25 μl of the 
primer pool (0.2 pmol each primer/μl, primer sequences for rat and mouse are provided in 
Supplemental Data Tables 1–2). Pre-amplification was performed using a 10 min 95 °C 
denaturation step and 14 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 4 min at 60 °C. Reaction products were 
diluted 5 times in TE Buffer (Teknova, Hollister, CA, USA). Five microliters from a sample 
mix containing pre-amplified cDNA and amplification Master mix (20 mm Mgcl2, 10 mm 
dNTPs, FastStart Taq polymerase, DNA binding Dye loading reagent, 50× ROX, 20× 
Evagreen) was loaded into each sample inlet of a 96.96 Dynamic Array chip (Fluidigm 
Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA) and 5 μl from an assay mix containing DNA assay 
loading reagent, as well as forward and reverse primers (10 pmol/μl) was loaded into each 
detector inlet. The chip was then placed in the NanoFlexTM 4-IFC Controller (Fluidigm) for

 loading and mixing. After loading, the chip was processed in the BioMark™ Real-Time 
PCR System (Fluidigm) using a cycling program of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles 
of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. After completion of qPCR, a melting 
curve of amplified products was determined. Data were collected using BioMark™ Data 
Collection Software 2.1.1 build 20090519.0926 (Fluidigm) as the cycle of quantification 
(Cq), where the fluorescence signal of amplified DNA intersected with background noise. 
Fluidigm data were corrected for differences in input RNA using the geometric mean of 
three reference genes Aldh1l1, Gapdh, Rplp0. Data preprocessing and analysis was 
completed using Fluidigm Melting Curve Analysis Software 1.1.0 build 20100514.1234 
(Fluidigm) and Real-time PCR Analysis Software 2.1.1 build 20090521.1135 (Fluidigm) to 
determine valid PCR reactions. Invalid reactions were removed from later analysis. 
Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted following the MIQE (minimum information for 
publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments) guidelines38. The array 
accommodated reactions for 96 samples and 96 genes in total. The pre-amplified cDNA 
samples from the stimulation experiments were measured together with no reverse 
transcriptase and no template controls on 96.96 Dynamic Array chips (Fluidigm). Cell-type 
specific transcripts were also detected for microglia, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and 
neurons, with any astrocyte samples containing measurable levels of other cell types 
removed from further analysis. All primer sequences for rat and mouse are listed in 
Supplemental Data Tables 1 and 2.
Microfluidic qPCR (single cell samples)
Experiments were performed on mice from the transgenic mouse line Tg(Aldh1l1-
EGFP)OFC789Gsat/Mmucd. For neuroinflammatory injury, postnatal day 5 (P5) mice 
received a single intraperitoneal injection of either endotoxin-free PBS, or the endotoxin 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli O55:B55 (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in normal saline 
and diluted into endotoxin-free PBS (5 mg/kg).
For ischemic injury, published protocols39 for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 
were modified as follows for P5 mice. Pups were anesthetized and maintained with 2–3% 
isoflurane in O2 on a rectal thermometer feedback heat pad at 37 °C. The animal’s heads 
were shaved, and cleaned with chlorhexidine, then sterile saline. Mice were injected 
subcutaneously with antibiotic (25 mg/kg cefazolin) and analgesic (0.1 mg/kg 
buprenorphine). A 4 mm horizontal incision and a 4 mm vertical incision were made to 
create a skin flap over the temporalis muscle. The temporalis muscle was also incised in a 
similar manner so that the skull was exposed. A micro drill was used to create a 2 mm 
diameter hole directly over the middle cerebral artery, the meninges were removed, and the 
middle cerebral artery was cauterized. The brain surface was rinsed with saline, and the 
temporalis muscle was folded back in to place and the skin was sealed with surgical glue. 
Animals were placed in a warm cage to recover from anesthesia until awake and ambulatory. 
Animals were left for 24 hours, at which time animals were killed by decapitation and 
single-cell suspensions for each control and experimental condition were made for 
downstream FACS analysis (see below).

 For both treatment groups, cortices from individual animals were collected separately from 
four LPS-injected or saline-injected control animals. The hippocampus, cerebellum, and 
olfactory bulbs were removed, as were the meninges. For the MCAO model, the ipsilateral 
cortex was collected, while the contralateral cortex, and other brain regions were discarded. 
Four mice that had undergone MCAO and four sham-operated control surgery were used. 
Dissected tissue was treated as described previously12 – briefly, dissected tissue was first 
diced to 1–3 mm and then digested with 200 U of papain enzyme for 90 min at 34 °C in 
bicarbonate-buffered Earle’s balanced salt solution with 0.46% glucose, 26 mM sodium 
bicarbonate, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 125 U/ml DNase I (Worthington Biochemicals). Digested 
tissues were dissociated into single-cell suspensions by gentle trituration, and myelin 
removed using O4, Mog, and GalC supernatants (1:30 at room temperature for 30 minutes). 
Myelin and larger tissue clumps were removed by filtering through 3 layers of Nitex mesh, 
and cells collected by centrifugation, before resuspension in Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) 
containing 0.02% BSA and 125 U/ml DNase I and with LIVE/DEAD® Fixable Far Red 
Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, L34973) for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
For FACS analysis live astrocytes were isolated at room temperature by FACS at the 
Stanford Shared FACS Facility on the basis of their GFP expression on a BD Aria II or BD 
Influx. Cell suspensions were sorted twice sequentially using forward light scatter and SSC 
to gate single cells, followed by gating for GFP fluorescence in the absence of LIVE/DEAD 
stain to select live astrocytes. Individual cells were collected directly into 96-well PCR 
plates containing RT-STA Mix solution (see below) for microfluidic qPCR. Flowjo software 
(Treestar) was used to analyze purity of final astrocyte populations.
For single cell microfluidic qPCR Fluidigm Advanced Development Protocol #41 for single 
cell gene expression using SsoFast Evagreen Supermix with Low ROX was used. Single 
cells were collect by FACS into a solution containing 5 μl CellsDirect™ 2× Reaction Mix 
(Thermo Scientific, 11753100), 1.0 μl Superscript® III RT Platinum® Taq Mix, 2.0 μl 10× 
primer mix (as for other microfluidic assays, primers at 500 nM), and 2.0 μl nuclease-free 
water, and frozen at -20 °C until processed.
For microfluidic qPCR, cells were defrosted on ice and preamplification PCR completed 
using the following thermocycling protocol: 50 °C for 15 minutes, 95 °C for 2 minutes, 18 
cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 4 minutes, hold at 4 °C. Excess primers were removed 
with 3.6 μl of Exonuclease I from E. Coli according to manufacturer protocol (New England 
BioLabs, M0293S): 37 °C for 30 minutes, 80 °C for 15 minutes, hold at 4 °C. This final 
preamplified sample was diluted 5-fold in TE Buffer (TEKnova, T0224). Five microliters of 
diluted sample were loaded into each sample inlet of a 96.96 Dynamic Array chip (Fluidigm 
Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA) and 5 μl from an assay mix containing DNA assay 
loading reagent as well as forward and reverse primers (10 pmol/μl), was loaded into each 
detector inlet. The chip was then placed in the NanoFlexTM 4-IFC Controller (Fluidigm) for 
loading and mixing. After loading, the chip was processed in the BioMarkTM Real-Time 
PCR System (Fluidigm) using a cycling program of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles 
of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. After completion of qPCR, a melting 
curve of amplified products was determined. Data were collected using BioMarkTM Data

Data preprocessing and analysis was completed using Fluidigm Melting Curve Analysis 
Software 1.1.0 build 20100514.1234 (Fluidigm) and Real-time PCR Analysis Software 2.1.1 
build 20090521.1135 (Fluidigm) to determine valid PCR reactions. Invalid reactions were 
removed from later analysis. Data was analyzed following published protocols for single cell 
RT-qPCR40.
Standard qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized as above. Quantitative RT-PCR was run 
using 2 μl cDNA and SYBR green chemistry (Applied Biosystems/ThermoFisher Scientific, 
4334973) using supplier protocol and a cycling program of 2 min at 95 °C followed by 40 
cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s on a Mastercycler epgradient S (Eppendorf). After 
completion of qPCR, a melting curve of amplified products was determined. Data were 
collected using Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex v2.2 (Eppendorf). Primer sequences for 
rat and mouse are listed in Supplemental Data Tables 1,2. Primer sequences for human as 
follows: hALDH1L1 (FWD – AGGGGCTGTTTTTCTCTCGG, REV – 
CATGGTAGCAGGAGGGTTGG), hC3 (for AD, HD, PD, ALS, FWD – 
AAAAGGGGCGCAACAAGTTC, REV – GATGCCTTCCGGGTTCTCAA; for MS, FWD

Western blot
Protein samples (conditioned growth media) were collected at 4 °C in PBS buffer containing 
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 
centrifugal filter units, with a 30kDa size exclusion (EMD Millipore). Total protein 
concentration of samples was determined via Bradford assay (Sigma) and equal amounts of 
total protein were loaded onto 12% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis (100 
V for 45 minutes), proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (EMD Millipore). 
Blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with 1:200 rabbit anti-GLYPICAN2 (abcam, 
ab129526), 1:200 rabbit anti-VERSICAN (abcam ab19345), 1:1000 rabbit anti-
SYNDECAN1 (Invitrogen, 36-2900), 1:1000 rabbit anti-BREVICAN (MyBioSource, 
MBS710876), 1:1000 mouse anti-NEUROCAN (EMD Millipore, MAB5234), 1:200 mouse 
anti-NG2 (abcam, ab50009), 1:50 goat anti-mouse C1q (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 
sc-365301). Blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:5000 for 
2 hours at room temperature and developed using ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection 
Reagent (GE Healthcare). Visualization and imaging of blots was performed with a 
FluorochemQ System (ProteinSimple).
Cytokine array screen
Conditioned media from immunopanned purified and cultured microglia grown in non-
reactive, or LPS-induced reactive state was collected as above and 100 μg of total protein 
was incubated with a Rat Cytokine Antibody Array Kit (R&D Systems, ARY008) according 
to manufacturer protocols.

 Immunohistochemistry – rodent
Animals were anaesthetized with a ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (20 mg/kg) cocktail, and 
perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde at approximately 
70% cardiac output. Dissected brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 
4 °C, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. For retinal immunohistochemistry, whole eyeballs 
were dissected and placed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, and then 
washed in dPBS before dissecting the retina away from the rest of the eyeball and post-
fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight a 4 °C. Both brains and whole retinas were 
embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek) and 10 μm tissue sections were prepared with a 
Leica cryostat. The following antibodies were used: 1:5000 rabbit anti-GFAP (DAKO, 
Z0334), 1:500 rat anti-GFAP (Invitrogen, clone 2.2B10), rabbit anti-AQP4 (Sigma, 
HPA014784), 1:500 rabbit anti-RBPMS (PhosphoSolutions, 1830-RBPMS), 1:500 mouse 
anti-CD68 (AbD Serotec, clone 514H12), 1:500–1500 rabbit anti-hC3D (DAKO, A0063). 
Primary antibodies were visualized with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with 
Alexa fluorophore (Invitrogen).
Immunohistochemistry – human
Immunohistochemistry of human post mortem MS tissue (see Supplemental Data Table 3) 
was completed on 20 μm thick snap-frozen sections, fixed with ice-cold methanol. Blocking 
steps included peroxidase blocking with H2O2, avidin and biotin blocking (Vector), and 
normal serum blocking with 10% serum of species in which secondary antibodies were 
raised, diluted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.01% Triton-X (PBST). 
Incubations with primary antibodies diluted in PBST were overnight at 4 °C (mouse anti-rat 
MOG, Millipore MAB5680 1:1000; MHC-II, abcam HLA DR ab80658 1:50; mouse anti-
human CD68, AbD Serotec MCA1815 1:200; rat anti-GFAP, Invitrogen MA5-12023 1:500; 
mouse anti-human S100A10, Invitrogen MA5-15326 1:1000; rabbit anti-human C3D, 
DAKO A0063 1:1000), and detection was achieved by signal amplification using 
biotinylated secondary antisera (Vector) followed by avidin–peroxidase (Vectastain ABC; 
Vector). Diaminobenzidine (DAKO) was used as chromogenic substrate. Negative control 
sections without primary antibodies were processed in parallel. Sections were counterstained 
with either hematoxylin, or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Double and triple 
fluorescence staining was performed with fluorochromes tagged to streptavidin and 
secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 647, Invitrogen).
Immunofluorescent double labelling for GFAP and C3 of human postmortem AD tissue (see 
Supplemental Data Table 4) and PD tissue (see Supplemental Data Table 5) was completed 
on 16 μm thick snap-frozen sections, fixed with ice-cold 1:1 methanol:acetone for 5 minutes 
at room temperature. Endogenous protein activity was blocked with 10% serum of species in 
which secondary antibodies were raised, diluted in 1× PBST for 2 hours at room 
temperature. Primary antibody incubations were made overnight at 4 °C – for AD, rat anti-
mouse GFAP (1:1000, Sigma G3893) and for PD, mouse anti-porcine GFAP (1:1000, 
Millipore MAB360), and rabbit anti-human C3D (1:1000, DAKO A0063). Detection was 
achieved with appropriate Alexa fluorescent secondaries for 3 hours at room temperature 
(diluted 1:5000 in PBST, Invitrogen).

 Fluorescence in situ hybridization of human post mortem tissue
Immunofluorescent double labelling for S100β and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization 
(FISH) for C3 on 10 μm thick frozen sections of human tissue fixed with 4% PFA and 
cryopreserved in 30% sucrose (see tissue sample details in Supplemental Data Tables 4, 6, 
7). To generate the C3 antisense RNA probe C3 was synthesized from the pCMV SPORT6 
C3 plasmid (Open Biosystems reference MHS6278-202800305), digested with SalI and 
RNA was transcribed from the T7 promoter. Dioxigenin labeling was carried out using an 
RNA labeling kit (Roche) before performing alkaline hydrolysis at 60°C for 16 min. A sense 
probe was also generated from the same plasmid but in this case digestion was carried out 
with Xhol and RNA transcribed form the SP6 promoter. For ISH tissue sections were 
incubated with RNA probes overnight at 64 °C, and then detected with anti-Digoxigenin 
antibodies (Roche). Staining was amplified using a TSA staining Kit (Perkin Elmer). 
Immunostaining for S100β (1:1000 DAKO Z0311) was subsequently performed as 
described above for IHC with GFAP and C3.
Synapse formation assay
We purified retinal ganglion cells from postnatal day 5 rats by sequential immunopanning to 
greater than 99% purity and cultured them in serum-free medium as previously described41. 
Control and A1 reactive astrocytes were plated on inserts and co-cultured with RGCs for 5–
10 days. For quantification of structural synapses, RGCs were fixed and stained with 
antibodies against the presynaptic marker Bassoon and postsynaptic marker Homer. Synapse 
number and size were quantified by a custom-written MATLAB program14.
Survival/cell toxicity assay
Control or A1 reactive astrocytes (see above) were grown for 7 d in serum-free media 
supplemented with 5 ng/ml HBEGF18. Cells were then treated with Il-1α, TNFα, and C1q 
or an equivalent volume of 1× dPBS and cells left for an additional 24 h. At this time, 
conditioned media was collected with cOmplete™, Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Sigma/Roche, 04693159001) and concentrated at 30kDa with Amicon Ultra-15 
Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore, UFC903024) until approximately 30–50× concentrated. 
A Bradford assay was performed to determine total protein concentration, and 1–50 μg/ml 
total protein was added to purified cell cultures of neurons, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, 
endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes or microglia (plated at 1,000 cells/well in poly-d-
lysine-coated (PDL) 96-well plates, grown for 5 days in serum-free base media) and 
viability assed using the LIVE/DEAD® Kits for mammalian cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
L3224). Additional experiments were done on RGCs and oligodendrocytes using heat 
inactivated A1 ACM (20-minute treatment at 60 °C) or protease treatment of A1 ACM (0.01 
U/ml plasmin from human plasma, Sigma – P1867), 2 h at room temperature. Protease 
treatment was halted with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, 78830) and aprotinin 
(Sigma, A4529) – final concentrations: 2 mM and 0.55 TIU/ml, respectively. Equivalent 
amounts of astrocyte base media proteins (BSA, transferrin, HBEGF etc.) were added back 
to protease-treated A1 ACM before treating cells). Viability was again assessed at 24 h as 
before. At least 6 independent experiments were conducted for each condition. For each 
experiment, 4 non-overlapping 20× fields per well were quantified in six wells.

 Motor neuron subtype toxicity assays
Motor neurons were purified using immunopanning (192 hybridoma clone)35, plated at 
1,000 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated (PDL) 96-well plates and grown for 5 days in 
serum-free base media. At this time cells were treated with A1 ACM (50 μg/ml total protein) 
and cells left until maximum death was seen (approximately 72–120 h), as determined by 
LIVE/DEAD® Kit for mammalian cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3224). Total RNA from 
remaining (resistant) cells was extracted using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) and cDNA 
synthesis performed using the SuperScript® VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Grand 
Island, NY, USA) according to supplier protocols, and RT-PCR for motor neuron subtype 
specific transcripts completed: all motor neurons, Ngfr (FWD – 
CTGCTGCTGATTCTAGGGATGT, REV – ATCTGCACACTGCATCGTCT), FoxP1 (FWD 
– CAACGTGCCCATTTCTTCAGC, REV – AGATTCAAGAATGGCCTGCCT); pre-
ganglionic motor neurons, Ne2f2 (FWD – AAGCACTACGGCCAGTTCAC, REV – 
CCTCTGTACAGCTTCCCGTC); alpha motor neurons, Rbfox (FWD – 
CTTGTCCGTTTGCTTCCAGG, REV – GGAAGGTTTCACATGGTTCCG); gamma 
motor neurons, Wnt7a (FWD – CGGACGCCATCATCGTCATA, REV – 
CTCCCGACTCCCCACTTTGA), Esrrg (FWD – TTGAACCCGAGACTCTCCCA, REV – 
GCAGAGAAGCCTTTCCGACT).
Bacteria cultures and killing assays
Bacterial strains include Salmonella typhimurium (SL1344), Burkholderia thailandensis 
(E264), and Shigella flexneri (M90T). S. typhimurium was grown in LB broth (BD 
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). B. thailandensis and S. flexneri were grown in tryptic soy broth 
(TSB; BD Biosciences). All strains were grown in 2 mL broth overnight from a frozen stock 
with aeration at 37°C. Bacteria were subcultured 1:1000 into broth (S. typhimurim and S. 
flexneri into Mgm-MES media42 and B. thailandensis into TSB) and 50% supernatant from 
control astrocytes or A1 (bad) astrocytes at serial dilutions from 0–100 μg/mL. At 16 hours 
of growth the OD600 was recorded.
Differentiation of hES cells to dopaminergic neurons
H1 human embryonic stem cells (hES, Wi Cell, Madison, WI) were cultured using standard 
protocols on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Differentiation of hES cells to 
dopamine neurons was done as described previously43. Human ES cells were cultured on 
matrigel (Corning, CB-40234)-coated plates at a density of 40,000 cells/cm2 in SRM media 
containing growth factor and small molecule including FGF8a (100ng/ml, R&D Systems, 
423-F8-025/CF), SHH C25II (100ng/ml, R&D Systems, 464-SH-025/CF), LDN193189 
(100nM, Stemgent Inc., 04-0074-02), SB431542 (10μM, Stemgent Inc., 04-0010), 
CHIR99021 (3μM, Stemgent Inc., 04-0004-02) and Purmorphine (2μM, Stemgent Inc., 
04-0009) for first five days. For the next six days’ cells were maintained in neurobasal 
medium containing B27 minus vitamin A (Life Technologies, 12587-010), N2 supplement 
(Life Technologies, 17502048) along with LDN193189 and CHIR99021. In the final stage 
cultures were lifted and replated at a density of 400,000/cm2 on polyornithine- and laminin-
coated plate in a neurobasal media containing B27 minus Vitamin A, BDNF (20ng/ml, R&D 
Systems, 248-BD-025/CF), GDNF (20ng/ml, R&D Systems, 212-GD-010/CF), TGFβ

(0.5mM, Sigma D0627) and DAPT (10μM, Stemgent, 04-0041) till maturation. Once mature 
(approximately 60 days) toxicity assays with A1 ACM were performed as outlined above.
TUNEL staining of apoptotic cells in mouse hippocampus
Neuronal cell death was detected in vivo in wildtype and single knock-out animals (Il1α−/−, 
TNFα−/−, or C1q−/−) using TUNEL staining of 12 μm 4% paraformaldehyde fixed frozen 
sections of hippocampus using the in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red (Roche, 
12156792910) using supplier protocol.
Depletion of microglia using Pexidartinib (PLX-3397)
Pexidartinib (PLX-3397, SelleckChem, S7818), a CSF1R inhibitor, was administered ad 
libitum to P21 wildtype C57Bl/6 mice at 290 mg/kg in AIN-76A Rodent Diet (Research 
Diets Inc., D10001) for 7 days to eliminate microglia44. At this stage flow cytometry 
showed around 95% decrease in microglia cell number (Extended Data Fig. 1). These 
microglia-depleted animals were used for optic nerve crush (see below) and 
neuroinflammatory investigation (with i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg LPS).
Flow cytometry analysis of Csf1r−/− and PLX-3397-treated animals
Both Csf1r−/− and PLX-3397 treated animals (and appropriate controls: Csf1r+/+, control 
chow-treated animals) received an i.p. injection of LPS (5 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours after 
LPS injection, animals were killed and brains prepared for downstream processing (see 
below).
For P28 PLX-3397-treated animals, brain cell dissociation and staining were performed as 
described previously15 with minor changes, specifically the addition of cold PBS 
intravascular perfusion, dissection of cortex rather than whole brain, and the use of a 
different fluorophore panel. Briefly, cortices from PLX-3397 and control treatments were 
dissected from anesthetized, cold PBS-perfused mice at P28. Cortices were homogenized in 
ice cold HBSS supplemented with 15mM HEPES and 0.5% glucose by 5 gentle strokes in a 
7 mL glass dounce homogenizer. Dissociated cell suspensions were run through MACS 
myelin depletion columns, stained with a dead cell marker (LIVE/DEAD, Life 
Technologies, L23101), and then immunostained using antibodies specific to TMEM119 
(custom antibody15, secondary Ab Biolegend 406410), CD45 (eBioscience 25-0451-82), 
and CD11b (Biolegend 101228). Samples were analyzed on an LSR II (Becton Dickinson), 
and data processed using Flowjo software (Treestar). Data was collected on an instrument in 
the Stanford Shared FACS Facility obtained using NIH S10 Shared instrument Grant 
(S10RR027431-01). Debris, doublets, and dead cells were excluded using fsc/ssc, fsc-h/fsc-
w, and green florescence gates, respectively.
For P8 Csf1r−/− animals, brains were processed identically except that the myelin depletion 
step was removed and cells were passed through fine nylon mesh to filter debris (Tetko 
HC3-20).

 Retro-orbital nerve crushes
Postnatal day 14 Sprague Dawley rats or P21-28 mice were anaesthetized with 2.5% inhaled 
isoflurane in 2.0 L O2/min. Without incision to the orbital rim, the supero-external orbital 
contents were blunt-dissected, the superior and lateral rectis muscles teased apart, and the 
left optic nerve exposed. The nerve was crushed for 3–5 seconds at approximately 2 mm 
distal to the lamina cribrosa. After surgery, the eye fundi were checked to ensure retinal 
blood flow was intact. Some rats also received a 2 μl intravitreal injection of neutralizing 
antibodies to Il-1α (150 μg/μl, abcam, ab9614), TNFα (150 μg/μl, Cell Signaling 
Technology, #7321), and C1q (Quidel, A301), rabbit IgG control (150 μg/μl, abcam, 
ab27472), or PBS at day 0 (the time of optic nerve crush, for 7 and 14 day experiments) or 
day 7 (for some 14 day experiments). Retinas were collected for qPCR analysis and 
immunofluorescent analysis at 7 and 14 days.
Synaptosome/myelin purification and in vitro engulfment assay
Synaptosomes45 and crude CNS myelin46 were purified as described previously, and 
conjugated with pHrodo™ Red, succinimidyl ester (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36600) in 
0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 9.0) at room temperature with gentle agitation. After two-hour 
incubation, unbounded pHrodo was washed-out by multiple rounds of centrifugation and 
pHrodo-conjugated synaptosomes/myelin were re-suspended with isotonic buffer containing 
5% DMSO for subsequent freezing. Purified control and A1 reactive astrocytes from P6 rat 
pups (see above) were incubated with 5 μl pHrodo-conjugated synaptosomes for 24 h, or 
800 μg/ml media pHrodo-conjugated myelin debris and imaged at 1 h intervals. Live 
astrocytes were imaged with epifluorescence time lapse microscope (IncuCyte Zoom ® 
System) to reveal engulfed pHrodo-conjugated particles. For image processing analysis, we 
took 9 images/well using 20× objective lens from random areas of the 24 well plates and 
calculated the phagocytic index (PI) by measuring the area of engulfed synaptosomes/
myelin (fluorescent signal) normalized to the area of astrocytes, using ImageJ. Relative 
engulfment ability was calculated by normalizing the PI of control (non-reactive) astrocytes 
by that of A1 reactive astrocytes3.
In vivo synapse engulfment assay
Tg(Aldh1l1-EGFP)OFC789Gsat/Mmucd transgenic mice were used to visualize astrocytes 
in all in vivo engulfment assays. Pups were anaesthetized with isoflurane and 5 mg/kg LPS 
was injected i.p. at postnatal day 3. Twenty hours later 1 μl of cholera toxin-β subunit (CTB) 
conjugated with Alexa594 (Invitrogen, 1 mg/ml in normal saline) was injected into the 
contralateral eye. After 24 h mice were sacrificed and half had the dorsal LGN dissected out 
for microfluidic qPCR analysis, while the remainder were perfused with PBS followed by 
4% paraformaldehyde at 70% cardiac output and brains were dissected, post-fixed overnight 
for 4 °C and transferred to 15% and 30% sucrose for 24 h each at 4 °C. Brains were 
sectioned at 50 μm and floating coronal sections containing dLGN were mounted on slide 
glasses and used for analysis of the dLGN. For each dLGN, two fields (the tip and medial 
portions of dLGN that contain both contra- and ipsilateral projections) were imaged using 
Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscopy to obtain 50–70 consecutive optical sections 
with 0.3 μm interval thickness. ImageJ was used to remove outliers (radius 2.0 pixels and

 threshold 20) from all channels and subtract background from CTB images (rolling bar 
radius 50 pixels). An image-processing algorithm (MATLAB, Mathworks) was used to 
localize CTB-labelled RGC projections engulfed by astrocytes by subtracting CTB-labelled 
projections outside of the Aldh1l1-eGFP positive cells. The phagocytic index was calculated 
by measuring the total volume of engulfed CTB-labelled RGC projections normalized to the 
total volume of astrocytes in a given z-stack. Relative engulfment ability was calculated by 
normalizing the phagocytic index of experimental groups to control group3.
Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cultured RGC neurons were performed at room 
temperature in an isotonic saline solution (in mM: NaCl 125, NaHCO3 25, KCl 2.5, 
NaH2PO4 1.25, glucose 25, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2). Patch electrodes with resistances of 2.5–3.5 
MΩ were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries and were filled with an 
internal solution containing (in mM) potassium gluconate 130, NaCl 4, EGTA 5, CaCl2 0.5, 
10 HEPES, MgATP 4, Na2GTP 0.5 (pH 7.2 with KOH). Miniature excitatory postsynaptic 
currents (mEPSCs) were recorded in TTX (1 μM, Alomone) from a holding potential of -70 
mV. Series resistance was monitored throughout the recording and was <20 MΩ. Data were 
sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz using pClamp 9.2, and offline analysis of mEPSCs 
was performed using Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices).
Proliferation, differentiation and motility assays
Cultures of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were prepared by immunopanning and 
grown as outlined in Methods. To measure proliferation, OPCs were grown for 24 hours in 
OPC proliferation media47 and then changed into OPC media containing 10μM EdU 
(ThermoFisher, C10339) and varying concentrations of A1 or resting ACM (0–50 μg/ml 
total protein). After 5 days, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for EdU and 
DNA (Hoechst 33342) according to the protocol for the Click-It® Edu Imaging Kit. To 
measure differentiations of OPCs into mature OLs, 1ug/ml A1 ACM was added to OPC 
cultures and they were imaged at 24 h intervals with phase time lapse microscope (IncuCyte 
Zoom ® System). Images were analyzed and number of primary processes extending from 
the cell soma were counted. A cell was considered an OPC with 0–2 processes, a 
differentiating OL with 4–5 processes, and a mature OL with 5+ primary processes. Before 
differentiation into mature OLs, OPC migration was measured using the Template Matching 
and Slice Alignment and MTrackJ plugins for ImageJ. Astrocyte motility was measured 
using the same ImageJ plugin, with cells grown at a density of 5000 cells/cm2 in HBEGF-
containing astrocyte growth media.
Statistical analysis and power calculations
All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 7.00 software. Most data were 
analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple post-hoc test for comparing 
more than three samples, and two-sample unpaired t-test for comparing two samples with 
95% confidence. Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with 95% confidence was used for 
electrophysiology experiments in Fig. 2g. Power calculations were performed using 
G*Power Software V 3.1.9.248. Group sizes were used to provide at least 80% calculable 
power with the following parameters: probability of Type I error (0.05), conservative effect

 Figure 1. Serum-free culture model for A1 reactive astrocytes
a, Heat map of reactive transcripts. Csf1r−/− mice (which lack microglia) fail to produce A1 
astrocytes following LPS injection. LPS-activated microglia, or a combination of Il-1α, 
TNFα, and C1q are able to induce A1s in culture. b, Cytokine array analysis of LPS-
activated microglia conditioned media (MCM) with increases in Il-1α, Il-1β and TNFα 
(Il-1β was not A1-specific). c, Western blot analysis of LPS-activated MCM for C1q protein. 
d, TGFβ was able to reset A1 reactive astrocytes to a non-reactive state. e, Individual knock-
out (Il-1α−/−, TNFα−/−, C1q−/−), double (Il-1α−/−TNFα−/−), and triple knock-out 
(Il-1α−/−TNFα−/−C1q−/−) mice fail to produce A1s following LPS injection. Mice treated 
with Pexidartinib (PLX-3397) for 7 days to deplete 95% of microglia (Extended Data Fig. 1) 
still respond to LPS by producing A1s. f, Representative phase and fluorescent

 Figure 2. A1 reactive astrocytes do not promote synapse formation or function
a, Representative images of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) grown without astrocytes, or with 
control or A1 reactive astrocytes, immunostained with pre- and post-synaptic markers 
HOMER (green) and BASSOON (red). Co-localization (yellow puncta) was counted as a 
structural synapse. b, Total number of synapses normalized per each individual RGC, n = 50 
neurons in each treatment. c, Quantitative PCR for astrocyte secreted synaptogenic factors. 
d, Representative traces of whole-cell patch clamp mEPSC recordings from RGCs. e, 
Frequency of mEPSCs was significantly decreased in presence of A1s (RGCs without 
astrocytes: 0.19 ± 0.05 Hz n = 12 neurons, RGCs with resting astrocytes: 2.28 ± 0.51 Hz n = 
14 neurons, RGCs with A1s: 0.95 ± 0.19Hz n = 16 neurons). f, A1s significantly decreased 
mean amplitude of mEPSCs (RGCs without astrocytes: 21.81 ± 0.78 pA n = 12 neurons, 
RGCs with resting astrocytes: 23.89 ± 0.38 pA n = 14 neurons, RGCs with A1s: 22.32 
± 0.37 pA n = 16 neurons). g, RGCs cultured with A1s had significantly more small 
amplitude mEPSCs in cumulative probability histograms (p < 0.0001 Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test, n = 12–16 neurons per condition). * p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA. Error bars indicate 
s.e.m. Scale bar: 10 μm.
