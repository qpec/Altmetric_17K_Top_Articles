Abstract
BACKGROUND & AIMS—It is not clear whether symptoms alone can be used to estimate the 
biologic activity of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We aimed to evaluate whether symptoms can 
be used to identify patients with endoscopic and histologic features of remission.
METHODS—Between April 2011 and June 2014, we performed a prospective, observational 
study and recruited 269 consecutive adults with EoE (67% male; median age, 39 years old) in 
Switzerland and the United States. Patients first completed the validated symptom-based EoE 
activity index patient-reported outcome instrument and then underwent 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with esophageal biopsy collection. Endoscopic and histologic 
findings were evaluated with a validated grading system and standardized instrument, respectively. 
Clinical remission was defined as symptom score <20 (range, 0 100); histologic remission was 
defined as a peak count of <20 eosinophils/ mm2 in a high-power field (corresponds to 
approximately <5 eosinophils/median high-power field); and endoscopic remission as absence of 
white exudates, moderate or severe rings, strictures, or combination of furrows and edema. We 
used receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the best symptom score cutoff values 
for detection of remission.
RESULTS—Of the study subjects, 111 were in clinical remission (41.3%), 79 were in endoscopic 
remission (29.7%), and 75 were in histologic remission (27.9%). When the symptom score was 
used as a continuous variable, patients in endoscopic, histologic, and combined (endoscopic and 
histologic remission) remission were detected with area under the curve values of 0.67, 0.60, and 
0.67, respectively. A symptom score of 20 identified patients in endoscopic remission with 65.1% 
accuracy and histologic remission with 62.1% accuracy; a symptom score of 15 identified patients 
with both types of remission with 67.7% accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS—In patients with EoE, endoscopic or histologic remission can be identified 
with only modest accuracy based on symptoms alone. At any given time, physicians cannot rely 
on lack of symptoms to make assumptions about lack of biologic disease activity in adults with 
EoE. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT00939263.

 to esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation.”1,2 
Dysphagia is the leading EoE symptom in adult patients, but swallowing-associated pain and 
heartburn not responding to acid-suppressive medication can also occur.1,2 In Europe and the 
United States, a steady increase in EoE incidence and/or prevalence has been observed 
during the past 2 decades with a current prevalence of about 1/2,000 inhabitants.3–10
Despite the urgent need for EoE-specific therapies, to date, no such therapy has been 
approved by regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the 
European Medicines Agency. There are 2 major hurdles in the way of seeking regulatory 
approval for EoE-specific therapies: first, standardized and validated instruments for reliable 
assessment of disease activity have been lacking for a long time and, second, there is an 
ongoing debate among different stakeholders regarding the choice of clinically relevant end 
points for use in clinical trials and natural history studies.11,12
Recently, considerable progress has been made toward developing and validating 
instruments for standardized disease activity assessment. Among others, the EoE endoscopic 
reference score, developed by Hirano et al, for grading the severity of distinct EoE-
associated endoscopic features (edema, rings, exudates, furrows, and strictures) and the 
eosinophilic esophagitis activity index (EEsAI) patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument 
for assessing clinical activity in adult patients, are now available for use in various studies.
13,14
A dissociation between EoE symptom severity and histologic activity was documented in 
some, but not other studies.15–18 This leaves clinicians with uncertainty as to the elements 
upon which their therapeutic decisions should be based. Specifically, it is currently unknown 
whether physicians can rely solely on EoE-related symptoms when estimating the severity of 
endoscopic and histologic activity in a given patient.
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between clinical activity and 
biologic activity (endoscopy, histology) of EoE. Specifically, we aimed to examine the 
ability of the EEsAI PRO score to detect endoscopic and histologic remission in adult EoE 
patients. We also aimed to examine whether the previous EoE-specific treatment impacts the 
relationship between clinical and biologic EoE activity, and, in so doing, alters the ability of 
the EEsAI PRO score to detect biologic remission. This study may help to elucidate whether 
treatment decisions can be based solely on symptoms, or whether the biologic findings 
obtained during more invasive procedures, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) 
with biopsy sampling, should also be taken into consideration.

 Adult EoE patients (≥17 years of age) were consecutively recruited in 1 ambulatory care 
clinic and 5 hospitals in Switzerland and the United States between April 2011 and June 
2014. All patients were treated by 6 gastroenterologists (AMS, JA, ED, NG, IH, and AS) 
specializing in EoE (each gastroenterologist has treated >50 EoE patients and performed 
>1000 EGDs). Patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study. All 
patients in need of an EGD for initial diagnosis, for confirming a suspected diagnosis, or for 
monitoring previously diagnosed EoE were invited to participate in the study. Patients were 
diagnosed by investigators according to standardized criteria.1,2 EoE patients with 
concomitant gastro-esophageal reflux disease were also included, provided that they fulfilled 
the following criteria: they were on continued proton-pump inhibitor therapy at the time of 
EGD; they had no symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease; and they had no evidence 
of acute reflux-related lesions. Before undergoing EGD, patients completed the EEsAI PRO 
instrument (in paper form).14
Assessment of Symptoms and Behavioral Adaptations to Living With Dysphagia
Development and validation of the EEsAI PRO instrument has been described recently.14 
The EEsAI PRO instrument was developed in accordance with the US Food and Drug 
Administration guidelines.19,20 The instrument queries the following symptoms and 
behavioral adaptations to living with dysphagia recalled during a 7-day period: frequency of 
trouble swallowing, duration of trouble swallowing, thoracic pain when swallowing, trouble 
swallowing caused by foods of different consistencies, and behavioral adaptations to living 
with dysphagia, including avoidance; modification; and slow eating.14 The EEsAI PRO 
score ranges from 0 to 100 points.
Assessment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis Associated Endoscopic and Histologic Findings
During EGD, at least 4 biopsies from the proximal and 4 biopsies from the distal esophagus 
were obtained. For this study, we defined “distal” esophagus as the section of the esophagus 
5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and “proximal” esophagus as the section spanning 
the top half of the esophagus. Assessment of severity of EoE-associated endoscopic 
findings, such as edema, rings, exudates, furrows, and stricture(s) in the proximal and distal 
esophagus, was carried out by the treating physician in accordance with the EoE Endoscopic 
Reference Score classification and grading system.13 For the purposes of this study, white 
exudates, furrows, and edema were considered to represent endoscopic features associated 
with acute inflammation, and fixed rings and strictures were considered to represent features 
associated with chronic inflammation.13,21
Histologic evaluation of esophageal biopsies was performed by the local center pathologist 
with expertise in EoE. Five-micrometer sections were cut from paraffin blocks and then 
stained with H&E for examination by light microscopy. At least 5 levels of every esophageal 
biopsy specimen were surveyed, and the eosinophils in the most densely infiltrated area 
were counted under high-power examination (magnification 400×). The following features 
were recorded: size of high-power field (hpf [in mm2]), quality of sample orientation, 
percentage of the hpf covered by the tissue, peak number of eosinophils/hpf, distribution of 
eosinophils in an hpf, distribution of inflammation, presence of abscesses, basal layer 
enlargement, and lamina propria fibrosis.

 Definitions of Endoscopic and Histologic Remission
We used the following definitions of endoscopic remission: Endoscopic inflammatory 
remission
•
absence of white exudates
•
furrows and edema may be present, but not in combination Endoscopic fibrotic 
remission
•
absence of moderate and severe rings
•
absence of strictures
Total endoscopic remission (inflammatory and fibrotic remission):
•
absence of white exudates
•
furrows and edema may be present but not in combination
•
absence of moderate and severe rings
•
absence of strictures
We used the following definitions of histologic remission: peak count of <20 
eosinophils/mm2 of hpf and peak count of <60 eosinophils/mm2 of hpf. The data on peak 
eosinophil counts are presented as per mm2.22 The rationale for the definitions of histologic 
remission was as follows: median hpf size was 0.26 mm2 (interquartile range, 0.26 0.307 
mm2; range, 0.204 0.545 mm2). Therefore, <20 eosinophils/mm 2 and <60 eosinophils/mm2 
correspond to approximately <5 eosinophils/ median hpf and <15 eosinophils/median hpf, 
respectively.
We defined “deep remission” as the combination of endoscopic inflammatory and fibrotic 
remission, as well as histologic remission (peak eosinophil count <20/mm2 of hpf).
Data Handling and Statistical Analysis
The investigators at various centers sent the completed instruments to the data center at the 
Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (University of Bern, Switzerland). Two 
researchers (ES, NH) double-entered the data into an EpiData database (version 3.1, EpiData 
Association, Odense, Denmark). The original records were checked to resolve any 
discrepancies. The study dataset was imported into Stata (version 13, Stata-Corp, College 
Station, TX) for analysis.
Descriptive results are presented as frequencies and corresponding percentages of the group 
total or median and interquartile range. To obtain the severity of the EoE-associated 
endoscopic and histologic findings for the esophagus overall, the most severe category for a 
given finding identified in proximal and distal esophagus was chosen. If data on severity of a 
given finding in one part of the esophagus were missing, then severity of that finding for 
another part of the esophagus was chosen as the one representing severity of that finding for 
the esophagus overall.

 We performed several analyses in order to evaluate the accuracy of distinct EEsAI PRO 
values to detect endoscopic or histologic remission. First, we calculated the sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of 
distinct EEsAI PRO score values to detect endoscopic and histologic remission at all 
possible EEsAI PRO values. The diagnostic accuracy is expressed as a proportion of the 
correctly classified subjects (true positive and true negative) among all subjects (true and 
false positive as well as true and false negative). Second, to determine the optimal cutoff 
value of the EEsAI PRO score for detecting endoscopic or histologic remission, we 
constructed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The ROC curve is a plot of the 
true-positive rate (sensitivity) vs the false-positive rate (1 – specificity) for the different 
possible cutoff values of a diagnostic test. The closer the curve follows the left-hand border 
and the top border of the ROC space, the more accurate the diagnostic test is.23 Therefore, 
the optimal cutoff value is the highest PRO score, which sits closest (Euclidean distance) to 
the top-left corner of the ROC space. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated 
from fitting logistic regression models (for each remission type) with the EEsAI PRO score 
as a continuous variable. A perfect test for discrimination between individuals with and 
without a given outcome has an AUC of 1.0, and a test that discriminates between these 
individuals with and without this outcome no better than chance has an AUC of 0.50. To 
examine whether the association between the EEsAI PRO score and the remission depends 
is modified by previous treatments (esophageal dilation, hypoallergenic diet, or swallowed 
topical corticosteroids), interaction tests between the EEsAI PRO score and different 
treatments were performed. The ROC curve analysis was repeated for treatment subgroups, 
if the interaction test with the EEsAI PRO score proved significant (P < .05).
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 269 adult patients with previously diagnosed EoE according to the established 
criteria were prospectively included into the study.1 Patient characteristics are shown in 
Table 1. One hundred and fifty-nine patients (59.1%) had EoE symptom onset of >5 years 
before being recruited into the study. At the time of the study, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, 
eczema, and food allergies were self-reported by 97 patients (36.1%), 163 patients (60.6%), 
52 patients (19.3%), and 113 patients (42.0%), respectively. Gastroesophageal reflux disease 
was diagnosed in 64 patients (23.8%). In the last 12 months before their participation in this 
study, 141 patients (52.4%), 37 patients (13.8%), and 53 patients (19.7%) had been treated 
for EoE with swallowed topical corticosteroids, hypoallergenic diets, and esophageal 
dilation, respectively.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis Associated Endoscopic and Histologic Features
The EoE-associated endoscopic and histologic findings in proximal and distal esophagus, as 
well as for “esophagus overall,” are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Endoscopic findings 
were graded in accordance with the EoE endoscopic reference score.13 The frequency of 
distinct endoscopic findings was similar when the proximal esophagus was compared with 
the distal esophagus. If esophagus overall was examined, the following frequencies of

 endoscopic features were observed: exudates in 91 patients (33.8%), rings in 195 patients 
(72.5%), edema in 155 patients (57.6%), and strictures in 90 patients (33.5%).
The prevalence of distinct histologic findings was similar when the distal esophagus was 
compared with the proximal esophagus. Median peak eosinophil count was 92 per mm2 of 
hpf (interquartile range, 14–260; range, 0–1293 peak eosinophils/mm2). Eosinophilic 
abscesses were observed in 53 patients (19.7%).
Relationship Between Clinical, Endoscopic, and Histologic Activity
The proportion of patients with distinct EEsAI PRO scores, as well as endoscopic 
inflammatory, endoscopic fibrotic, total endoscopic, histologic, and deep remission at the 
time of inclusion in the study is shown in Table 2.
Test accuracy of distinct EEsAI PRO score cutoff values to detect endoscopic inflammatory, 
endoscopic fibrotic, and total endoscopic remission is shown in Table 3. Results of the ROC 
curve analysis are shown in Figure 1 for endoscopic inflammatory remission (Figure 1A), 
endoscopic fibrotic remission (Figure 1B), and total endoscopic remission (Figure 1C). The 
AUC was 0.6719 for detection of total endoscopic remission when compared with 0.6680 
and 0.6238 for detection of endoscopic fibrotic and endoscopic inflammatory remission, 
respectively. A PRO score of 20 identified patients in endoscopic inflammatory remission 
with 62.1% accuracy and in total endoscopic remission with 65.1% accuracy; a score of 30 
identified patients in endoscopic fibrotic remission with 62.1% accuracy.
We evaluated the test accuracy of distinct EEsAI PRO score cutoff values to detect 
histologic remission. These results are shown in Table 4. The results of ROC curve analysis 
are shown in Figure 1D and E. The AUC was 0.6007 and 0.6060 for detecting histologic 
remission defined as peak eosinophil count of <20/mm2 and <60/mm2 of hpf, respectively. 
A PRO score of 20 points identified patients in histologic remission of <20 eosinophils/mm2 
of hpf with overall accuracy of 62.1% and in histologic remission of <60 eosinophils/mm2 
of hpf with 61.7% accuracy.
Lastly, we examined the diagnostic accuracy of distinct EEsAI PRO score cutoff values to 
detect deep remission (Table 5). The corresponding ROC curve with EEsAI PRO score as 
continuous variable for detection of deep remission is shown in Figure 1F. The AUC was 
0.6719. An EEsAI PRO score of 15 points had an overall accuracy of 67.7% to detect 
patients in deep remission.
Impact of Treatment on the Relationships Among Clinical, Endoscopic, and Histologic 
Activity
We found that interaction terms between EEsAI PRO score and previous EoE-specific 
treatments were not significant for treatment with hypoallergenic diets and swallowed 
topical corticosteroids. However, a statistically significant interaction term (P = .0412) 
suggested that the relationship between EEsAI PRO score and total endoscopic remission 
changes, depending on whether a patient was treated with a dilation in the 12 months before 
inclusion. Therefore, we evaluated whether dilation influences the relationships among 
clinical, endoscopic, and histologic activity by first examining the frequency of the EoE-

 associated endoscopic and histologic findings in proximal and distal esophagus, as well as 
for esophagus overall (shown in Supplementary Table 2) in the patient group that underwent 
dilation in the last 12 months before inclusion in the study (n = 53) and in the patient group 
that did not undergo dilation (n = 213; dilation status of 3 patients was unknown). Patients 
that underwent dilation in the last 12 months before inclusion into the study were more 
likely to have strictures, moderate and severe rings, as well as white exudates and 
eosinophilic microabscesses when compared with patients that did not undergo dilation. The 
results of ROC curve analysis in patients stratified into groups based on absence or presence 
of dilation are shown in Supplementary Table 3. In the group of patients that underwent 
dilation, we found a good diagnostic accuracy for the EEsAI PRO instrument to detect 
patients in endoscopic fibrotic remission (AUC 0.768, optimal PRO value 25 points) and in 
deep remission (defined as endoscopic fibrotic and inflammatory as well as histologic 
remission) (AUC 0.863, optimal PRO value 25 points) (Supplementary Figure 1). In the 
nondilated patients, the AUC for all types of remission were similar to those observed when 
the entire study population was examined together.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the relationship between symptoms as measured by EEsAI PRO 
score and biologic findings in adults with EoE. We found that endoscopic and/ or histologic 
remission can be identified with only modest accuracy based on symptoms alone. Therefore, 
at any given time, physicians cannot rely on lack of symptoms to make assumptions about 
lack of biologic disease activity in adult EoE patients.
Accurate detection of endoscopic or histologic remission by the means of a symptom-based 
instrument would reduce the need to perform regular endoscopic and histologic follow-up 
examinations. This, in turn, would considerably reduce the burden of disease for patients and 
EGD-associated health care costs. We found that the overall accuracy of detecting 
endoscopic and histologic remission based on distinct EEsAI PRO score cutoff values was 
modest (AUC ranging between 0.6 and 0.7). At present, data on the accuracy of other EoE-
specific symptom-based activity instruments to detect endoscopic and histologic remission 
are lacking. When comparing the accuracy of the EEsAI PRO instrument to clinically based 
instruments used in other conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, we found that the EEsAI PRO 
score (using a score of 20 points as a cutoff) was better at detecting endoscopic remission 
(accuracy 65%) in EoE patients when compared with detection of endoscopic remission by 
means of the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI).24 Specifically, a CDAI score <100 
points had an overall accuracy of 55% in detecting endoscopic remission, and a CDAI score 
of <150 points had an overall accuracy of 56% in detecting endoscopic remission.24 As of 
yet, no data on the accuracy of various clinical scores to detect histologic remission in 
Crohn’s disease patients have been published. This is related, in part, to the fact that no 
formally accepted definition of histologic remission exists for both EoE and Crohn’s 
disease. Given that the size of an hpf varied, we standardized the peak eosinophil count per 
mm2. We chose a cutoff value of <20 eosinophils/hpf to define histologic remission, which 
corresponds to a value of <5 eosinophils/ hpf for a median hpf size of 0.26 mm2. An EEsAI 
PRO score of 20 points had an overall accuracy of 62% to detect histologic remission.

 Why is the test accuracy of detecting biologic remission based on the adult EEsAI PRO 
score only modest (AUC 0.6 0.7)? First, we found in a previous study that the perception of 
mild and moderate endoscopic or histologic alterations in adult EoE patients seems to be 
relatively poor.14 Only patients with severe endoscopic features had relevant symptoms.14 
We made similar observations when we analyzed the relationship between patient quality of 
life (as assessed by an adult EoE quality of life instrument) and endoscopic and histologic 
alterations.25,26 Patients with mild or moderate endoscopic and histologic features had 
relatively good quality of life (low adult EoE quality of life instrument score). However, the 
quality of life score was considerably poorer in patients with severe endoscopic 
inflammatory and/or fibrotic alterations or histologic inflammation (eg, presence of 
microabscesses).25 These results together suggest that endoscopically and histologically 
mild disease does not cause any symptoms or else very mild symptoms to which patients 
become accustomed over time. These findings are corroborated by a long diagnostic delay 
observed in EoE patients.21 Second, symptoms in EoE patients are mainly generated by 
altered esophageal motility caused by the presence of eosinophil-predominant inflammation 
and/or subepithelial fibrous tissue deposition (esophageal remodeling) that decreases the 
esophageal compliance.27,28 Sampling 4 proximal and 4 distal esophageal biopsies has a 
very good accuracy (>95%) for detecting the degree of mucosal eosinophilic inflammation.
29 However, consistently sampling subepithelial esophageal tissue with standard biopsy 
forceps might be quite difficult. Only 61% of all patients included into our study had 
subepithelial tissue that could be evaluated for presence of fibrosis. As such, our knowledge 
of processes occurring deeper in the esophageal wall and contributing to subtle stricture 
formation and loss of distensibility is limited. In other words, using biopsy sampling alone, 
we underestimate the degree of esophageal remodeling processes and inflammation that 
could potentially contribute to symptom generation. Indeed, upon histologic examination of 
specimens obtained from patients that underwent esophagectomy, an extensive lamina 
propria fibrosis contributing to increased wall thickness was observed.30,31 In addition, 
eosinophilic infiltration was observed not only in the mucosa, but throughout the esophageal 
wall as well, this infiltration penetrated the submucosa.30,31 In the future, technologies such 
as the Endolumenal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe, which allows assessment of 
esophageal diameter and esophageal compliance, will help physicians to better estimate the 
extent of esophageal remodeling and overall EoE activity beyond the endoscopic and 
histologic alterations.32 Given that untreated subclinical eosinophilic inflammation can lead 
to stricture formation (which represents the main risk factor for the food bolus impactions), 
we conclude that physicians should not only rely on patient-reported symptoms, but also on 
endoscopic and histologic findings when assessing disease severity in studies or during the 
clinical follow-up of adult EoE patients.21
When we examined the effect of different EoE-specific therapies on the relationship between 
EEsAI PRO score and various types of remission, we found that this relationship was not 
affected by treatment with hypoallergenic diets and swallowed topical corticosteroids in the 
3 months before inclusion into the study. However, the relationship between EEsAI PRO 
score and the total endoscopic remission changes, depending on whether patients underwent 
dilation in the 12 months before inclusion or not. In the attempt to explain this phenomenon, 
we examined the frequency of various endoscopic fibrotic and inflammatory findings, such 
Safroneeva et al.

 as mild and severe exudates, moderate and severe rings, as well as strictures in dilated and 
non-dilated patients. We found that patients that underwent dilation were actually more 
likely to have these findings when compared with patients that did not undergo dilation. As 
previously discussed, patients seem to perceive more extreme endoscopic findings. 
Therefore, over-representation of extreme findings in the group of patients that underwent 
dilation is the reason behind a good diagnostic accuracy of the EEsAI PRO score for 
detection of endoscopic fibrotic remission (and by extension total endoscopic remission and 
deep remission). However, this raises another important issue relating to the kind of effect 
that various EoE-specific treatments have on underlying disease biology and symptoms. 
Although treatment with hypoallergenic diets and swallowed topical corticosteroids impacts 
the underlying disease biology and, in so doing, leads to symptom improvement, treatment 
with dilation does not change underlying disease biology.33 However, dilation can lead to 
long-lasting improvement in symptoms. This disconnect between disease biology and 
symptoms might be another reason behind the perturbed relationship between EEsAI PRO 
score and remission in patients that underwent dilation.
Our study has strengths and some limitations as well. We evaluated the relationship between 
symptom severity on the one hand, and endoscopic and histologic activity on the other, using 
validated instruments for assessment of clinical and endoscopic activity in a well-defined, 
prospectively enrolled EoE population. However, the findings of our study should be 
interpreted with a number of considerations in mind. First, we did not evaluate the 
relationship between clinical activity and various novel tests, such as blood biomarkers (eg, 
blood eosinophil levels or serum levels of eosinophilic cationic protein), the esophageal 
string test, cytosponge, or the Endolumenal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe.32,34 36 Some 
of these might further enhance our ability to estimate EoE activity. Second, the EEsAI PRO 
instrument was designed specifically for use in adult patients; we do not know whether 
similar observations would also hold true in a pediatric population, where symptoms related 
to inflammation rather than fibrosis predominate.
In summary, given the imperfect concordance between patient-reported symptoms and 
endoscopic/histologic findings, physicians cannot rely on lack of symptoms to make 
assumptions about lack of biologic disease activity in adult EoE patients.
