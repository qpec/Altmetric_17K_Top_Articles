BACKGROUND. Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is challenging because efforts for effective,
timely treatment of men with significant cancer typically result in over-diagnosis and repeat
biopsies. The presence or absence of epigenetic aberrations, more specifically DNA-
methylation of GSTP1, RASSF1, and APC in histopathologically negative prostate core
biopsies has resulted in an increased negative predictive value (NPV) of �90% and thus
could lead to a reduction of unnecessary repeat biopsies. Here, it is investigated whether, in
methylation-positive men, DNA-methylation intensities could help to identify those men
harboring high-grade (Gleason score �7) PCa, resulting in an improved positive predictive
value.
METHODS. Two cohorts, consisting of men with histopathologically negative index
biopsies, followed by a positive or negative repeat biopsy, were combined. EpiScore, a
methylation intensity algorithm was developed in methylation-positive men, using area
under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic as metric for performance. Next, a
risk score was developed combining EpiScore with traditional clinical risk factors to further
improve the identification of high-grade (Gleason Score �7) cancer.
RESULTS. Compared to other risk factors, detection of DNA-methylation in histopathologi-
cally negative biopsies was the most significant and important predictor of high-grade cancer,
resulting in a NPV of 96%. In methylation-positive men, EpiScore was significantly higher for
those with high-grade cancer detected upon repeat biopsy, compared to those with either no
or low-grade cancer. The risk score resulted in further improvement of patient risk
stratification and was a significantly better predictor compared to currently used metrics as
PSA and the prostate cancer prevention trial (PCPT) risk calculator (RC). A decision curve

biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS. Low DNA-methylation levels in PCa-negative biopsies led to a NPV of
96% for high-grade cancer. The risk score, comprising DNA-methylation intensity and
traditional clinical risk factors, improved the identification of men with high-grade cancer,
with a maximum avoidance of unnecessary repeat biopsies. This risk score resulted in
better patient risk stratification and significantly outperformed current risk prediction
models such as PCPTRC and PSA. The risk score could help to identify patients with
histopathologically negative biopsies harboring high-grade PCa. Prostate 76:1078–1087,

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) patient management is chal-
lenging when trying to achieve high sensitivity, in
order not to miss clinically significant cancer, while
retaining high specificity, to avoid false positives.
Effective, timely treatment of potential aggressive
PCa can be achieved through early detection by
adequate screening, for example, by means of pros-
tate-specific antigen (PSA) [1,2]. However, these same
first-line diagnostic techniques quite often result in
over-diagnosis and over-treatment of patients with
indolent disease and unnecessary biopsies [3–6]. In
the US alone, over one million biopsies are performed
each year, with �25% of these resulting in a PCa
diagnosis [7]. Furthermore, only a fraction of these
would be considered at high risk for harboring
clinically significant, aggressive PCa [8].
No single biomarker has proven to be efficient
enough to be used as the sole diagnostic or prognostic
tool. While serum PSA is easy to assess, there is no
optimal cut point simultaneously resulting in high
sensitivity and specificity as high-grade tumors can
be missed even when applying low PSA cutoffs [1,9].
Histopathological examination of prostate biopsies,
the diagnostic gold standard, suffers from a sampling
bias, due to a limited amount of the prostate tissue
being examined [10–12]. When, over time, risk factors
persist and the risk for missed PCa is considered too
high, those men will undergo one or more repeat
biopsies. However, because the high false positive
rate [9], these (repeat) biopsies can be an unnecessary
patient burden and healthcare cost, and can also lead
to complications [13,14].
Epigenetic profiling by determining the DNA-
methylation status of GSTP1, APC, and RASSF1 has
been validated in two large, independent cohorts to
be able to increase the negative predictive value
(NPV) for men with PCa-negative biopsy tissue.
When no methylation of either one of these three
markers is detected in any of the residual tissues from
previously cancer-negative prostate biopsy cores, this
biomarker panel has been shown to result in an NPV
of 88–90% for all PCa [15,16]. This is a significant
increase over the gold standard histopathological
evaluation of these same biopsies and could result in
a decrease in unnecessary repeat biopsies [17].
Due to the high rate of unnecessary (repeat) biopsies,
attention has shifted towards identifying men with
significant PCa, often characterized as the presence of
Gleason pattern four or five, non-organ-confined dis-
ease and larger tumor volume [18]. In addition, patients
with insignificant or low-risk disease under active
surveillance, are at risk for disease reclassification,
upgrading and upstaging, warranting faster radical
treatment for these men [19–22]. A large, contemporary
study in over 34,000 men found that Gleason score (GS)
upgrading in GS6 patients is still very frequent when
comparing the clinical and pathological scores [23,24].
In current clinical practice, multimodal approaches
are used, with experts integrating several information
sources to determine the best course of action for each
patient. This entails both classical clinical risk factors,
such as digital rectal examination (DRE) and histo-
pathological examination of biopsy tissue, and tradi-
tional biomarkers, such as PSA. More recently, better
molecular biomarkers with higher specificity for PCa
have been introduced into clinical practice to improve
patient management, in particular DNA-methylation
profiling of GSTP1, RASSF1, and APC [25,26]. The
goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of an
existing DNA-methylation assay [15,16], to predict
men at risk of harboring high-grade cancer. Interest-
ingly, the three genes involved in this assay have all
been associated with PCa prognosis and might there-
fore also be predictive of PCa aggressiveness [27,28].
Therefore, two main objectives were set; first, absence
or low levels of DNA-methylation of the genes in the
assay should reach a high NPV for high-grade cancer,
and second, assay-positive patients should be further
accurately stratified according to the risk of harboring
high-grade cancer.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two previously published cohorts, of which all
patients had two consecutive biopsies within 24–
30 months, were combined into one set of 803 patients
[15,16]. Each center received institutional review
board approval, exemption, or waiver to use archived
clinical samples for research purposes (Western Gen-
eral Hospital, Edinburgh, UK; University Hospital of
Li�
ege, Belgium; Institut de Pathologie et G�
en�
etique,
Belgium; Cleveland Clinic, USA; Eastern Virginia
Medical School, USA; Lahey Hospital and Medical
Center, USA; Johns Hopkins University, USA; Univer-
sity of California Los Angeles, USA). Because this is a
non-interventional, retrospective, subject-anonymized
study, written patient consent was not required by the
ethics committees. All men had a negative index
biopsy followed by either a positive (179 men) or
negative (624 men) repeat biopsy. The cohorts were
joined and annotation was harmonized for histopa-
thology of the first, PCa-negative biopsy, that is,
benign, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(HGPIN) or atypia, and DRE, that is, normal or
abnormal.
The DNA-methylation profile based on GSTP1,
RASSF1, and APC was measured using quantitative
real-time PCR as described before [15,16]. Besides
the final assay result per patient (methylation positive
or negative), the methylation intensity of each individ-
ual marker in each core of the index biopsy was
evaluated.
Patients were classified according to the histopath-
ological outcome of the repeat biopsy. Men with high-
grade PCa (GS �7) detected upon repeat biopsy
(n ¼ 67) were considered high-risk patients, while
men with GS �6 disease (n ¼ 106) potentially/likely
have indolent PCa. Six PCa patients (3.4%) were not
classified due to incomplete Gleason scoring. Men
without PCa detected, after repeat biopsy, are consid-
ered control patients, although cancer could be missed
due to biopsy sampling error.
Patients are also stratified according to their overall
methylation status (positive or negative) as deter-
mined in MATLOC and DOCUMENT [15,16]. Only
36.2% of all control patients are methylation positive,
compared to almost the double (64.8%) for men with
cancer detected upon repeat biopsy. A risk score was
developed to improve stratification of methylation-
positive patients according to their risk of harboring
occult, high-grade cancer. In addition to the epigenetic
profiling, the contribution of standard risk factors,
that is, histopathology of the negative index biopsy,
digital rectal examination, PSA, and age were consid-
ered. Clinical risk was also examined by the risk
calculator (RC) of the prostate cancer prevention trial
(PCPT) [29]. Logistic regression models were opti-
mized and the final selection was based on the overall
predictive accuracy as measured by the area under
the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteris-
tic (ROC) and DeLong confidence intervals.
All statistical analyses were performed in R [30].

butions and a binomial test was applied when
comparing
proportions.

using the false discovery rate for multiple hypothesis
testing, resulting in a q-value [31]. Calculations
that are dependent on prevalence all made used
of the overall cancer detection rate upon repeat
biopsy observed in MATLOC, that is, 18%. Finally,
clinical utility was determined used a decision curve
analysis (DCA), and executed with the available R
package [32].
RESULTS
Combined Cohort Description
A total of 7,899 prostate core biopsies from 803
patients in the unified cohort were epigenetically
profiled. The most important clinical and demo-
graphic characteristics are shown in Table I. Each
individual patient typically had 10 evaluable cores
and the repeat biopsy often took place within 1 year
of the index biopsy. The NPV of finding low levels
of DNA-methylation in the combined cohort was
89.2% for all cancers. The positive predictive value
(PPV) of the epigenetic assay performed on the index
biopsies was 28.2% for detecting any cancer upon
repeat biopsy. Of note, none of these cancers were
identified at the time of the index biopsy, and based
on the cancer detection rate after repeat biopsy, the
epigenetic assay had a significantly increased PPV
(P < 0.001) compared to current clinical practice. Of
the traditional clinical risk factors, only histopathol-
ogy was significantly different between the distinct
groups, however, this did not allow a straightforward
separation between controls, patients with low-grade
cancer and men with high-grade cancer.
Limiting Delayed Diagnosis of High-Grade Cancer
While no tumors were found at time of the index
biopsy, both high- and low-grade disease were found
during repeat biopsy. Here, 106 out of 173 men with
PCa had GS6 disease, thus 38.7% of all cancers
identified at repeat biopsy were considered clinically

 significant, based on the clinical grade. High-grade
cancer is found in merely 7.0% (18% of men will have
PCa detected upon repeat biopsy, of which 38.7% will
have high-grade [GS �7] disease) of men undergoing
repeat biopsy. Because frequent upgrading of GS6
patients, the NPV of high-grade cancer cannot easily
be determined based on clinical GS. When including
all patients with clinical GS6 as control, a lower
boundary for the NPV for high-grade cancer of 95.7%
was obtained. When GS6 patients were omitted from
the calculations, the NPV was 95.9% for high-grade
cancer.
Stratifying Methylation-Positive Men for
High-Grade PCa Risk
From the entire cohort, a subset consisting of the 43
men with high-grade PCa and the 226 men without
PCa detected in a repeat biopsy was taken, however,
all of which had a DNA-methylation positive index
biopsy. This subset was used to evaluate whether men
with high-grade PCa can be identified by determining
DNA-methylation intensities in their PCa-negative
index biopsies. GS6 patients were not included due to
the high reclassification risk of under-graded disease.
Several methylation parameters were evaluated, that
is, the relative number of methylation positive cores,
the relative number of methylation events, and the
number of distinct, methylated genes. These methyla-
tion-based metrics were compared with traditional
risk factors in their ability to identify men with
high-grade PCa, but with histopathologically cancer-
negative biopsies (Table II). DNA-methylation metrics
and age at the time of the index biopsy were
significantly higher in the men with high-grade PCa
upon repeat biopsy. Pathology, PSA and DRE did not
perform better than random (all P > 0.05; Table II).
EpiScore: Measuring Epigenetic Risk Via
DNA-Methylation Intensity
Because the level of DNA methylation was the
most significant and strongest predictor (Table II) of
a methylation-positive man having high-grade can-
cer detected upon repeat biopsy, a general epigenetic
risk score was developed based on methylation
intensities of the three genes in individual cores. Per
core, the methylation intensity of each gene was
divided by a normalization factor, optimally weigh-
ing
each
gene’s
contribution.
These
normalized
intensities were added per core and subsequently
averaged over all evaluable cores per patient, to
obtain one final epigenetic score. This EpiScore
summarizes all available methylation signals that
can help in identifying men with high-grade PCa
detected upon repeat biopsy, that is, methylation
intensity, number of methylated cores, and number
of methylated genes.
A saturation parameter was applied to avoid over-
weighing a limited number of patients with very high
methylation signals. Gene weights and the saturation

Risk Score Predicts High-Grade Prostate Cancer

The Prostate
 parameters were exhaustively optimized to reach a
maximal AUC of 0.742 (Fig. 1). In addition to the
AUC, the mean EpiScore for the control group was
compared to that in the group of men with high-grade
PCa during the optimization process, to assure ro-
bustness of the algorithm, and only models with
q < 0.001 were retained. In the final model, EpiScore
was significantly higher for those men with high-
grade PCa detected upon repeat biopsy compared to
those with a non-cancer diagnosis (P < 0.001; Fig. 2).
EpiScore and Potentially Indolent Cancer
As an additional test of robustness of the algo-
rithm,
EpiScore
was
calculated
for
methylation-
positive men with likely indolent disease (GS �6),
detected at time of repeat biopsy. This confirmed the
original hypothesis concerning these men, with inter-
mediate EpiScores compared to the other two groups
(Fig. 2). Indeed, overall there were significant differ-
ences between the three groups (P < 0.001). A more
detailed analysis of the differences indicated signifi-
cantly higher EpiScores for those men with high-
grade disease versus the control group (P < 0.001) and
the men with GS6 PCa detected upon repeat biopsy
(P < 0.001), while the increase of EpiScore for GS6
patients versus the control patients was not significant
(P ¼ 0.184).
Holistic, Multimodal Risk Score for Clinically
High-Grade Cancer
It was evaluated whether the EpiScore logic could
be improved further by adding classical risk factors to
the algorithm. First a logistic regression model was
built, including EpiScore, age, PSA, DRE, and histopa-
thology of the PCa-negative index biopsy. When the
logarithm (base 10) of PSA was used instead of the
actual PSA value (in ng/ml), the relevance of PSA in
the model increased, most likely due to the restricted
weight of very high PSA values. EpiScore was the
only significant factor in this model with an odds ratio
(OR) of 9.80 (95%CI: 2.12–45.23) (Fig. 3). PSA was
borderline significant and a positive trend was ob-
served for the presence of atypia and age at time of
the index biopsy (all P > 0.05). HGPIN was the only
risk factor that inversely correlated with the detection
of high-grade PCa upon repeat biopsy (OR < 1).
A stepwise forward selection procedure was imple-
mented. When combining two risk factors, pathology
of the cancer-negative index biopsy was added to the
EpiScore and, next, age was selected as third factor.
Adding more factors did not further improve the
model, however, missing data for PSA (not available
for 11.5% of patients) and DRE (not available for
23.4% of patients) could lead to an underestimation of
their effects. In this final logistic regression model

 containing EpiScore, age and histopathology, the
trends for these risk factors remained unchanged
relative to those depicted in Figure 3. However, now
age was a significant contributor (P ¼ 0.010) and the
OR for EpiScore increased to 14.12 and appeared
more robust (95%CI: 12.59–15.84; P < 0.001). The final
model, based on EpiScore, histopathology of the first,
cancer negative biopsy and age, reached an AUC of
0.762 (Fig. 1).
To further evaluate the role of missing clinical data,
the risk score was generated using all available risk
factors for each individual patient. The risk score was
calculated based on EpiScore, pathology, age, DRE
and PSA, however, models were also optimized for all
combinations of missing data, that is, most often DRE
and PSA in this cohort. With this strategy an AUC of
0.77 (95%CI: 0.69–0.84) was obtained, which was not
significantly higher than the model only including
EpiScore, pathology and age (P ¼ 0.688).
Clinical risk was also calculated by means of the
PCPTRC version 2. Due to the small, and sometimes
counterintuitive, effect of DRE in this cohort, PCPT
risk for high-grade cancer was calculated with and
without DRE, but always including PSA, age and
race. Because of missing values, the cohort was
limited to those men with a valid PCPT risk score,
since PSA is a necessary parameter for this algorithm.
While EpiScore alone reached an AUC of 0.714 in
this subset of the cohort, the PCPT risk was far
less predictive, with an AUC of 0.618, regardless of
DRE inclusion. Combining EpiScore with the risk
predicted by the PCPT risk calculator increased the
AUC to 0.742 (without DRE; or 0.741 with DRE).
Relative to EpiScore, the single most significant
parameter in the model, the addition of the PCPTRC
traditional clinical risk represents an increase of
3.9% for the AUC, compared to 2.7% (increase from
0.742 to 0.762) with the addition of clinical risk as
specifically optimized in this cohort. The risk score
resulted in a significantly higher AUC compared to
currently used risk stratification algorithms, that is,
PSA (P ¼ 0.004) and PCPTRC (P ¼ 0.029).
Clinical Utility
A DCA was executed to determine the clinical
utility of the risk score and to obtain an accurate
assessment of the net benefit, in terms of high-grade
PCa detected corrected for performing unnecessary
repeat biopsies, and net avoidance rate, that is, the
reduction in repeat biopsies corrected for missing
high-grade cancers. Test harm, that is, the fact that a
larger number of men needs to be tested in order to
identify a subset of men with high-grade PCa, was
not included in the DCA, since no additional testing
would be required. PSA and DRE (included in
PCPTRC) were obtained at the time of the first biopsy,
and EpiScore was calculated as the DNA-methylation
intensity observed in the previous, cancer-negative
biopsy. Hence, all information was already available
at the time when a repeat biopsy was considered,
with no additional testing required.
Compared to PSA and PCPTRC, the risk score
clearly had the highest net benefit in terms of identify-
ing men with high-grade PCa (Fig. 4A). Taking into
account the 7.0% prevalence of high-grade PCa in the
general repeat biopsy population, and 16.0% for those
men with a methylation-positive prior biopsy, the risk
score proved to have a large net benefit, even for
those men who are very risk averse, that is, at low
probability thresholds. The net benefit of the risk
score was larger compared to a biopsy strategy where
all men receive a repeat biopsy, as soon the accepted
risk was �3%, that is, starting well below the overall
risk of having high-grade PCa detected in either the
general or the methylation-positive population repeat
biopsy population. The risk score showed the largest
net benefit over the entire range of clinically applica-
ble and acceptable probability thresholds that high-
grade PCa will be found upon repeat biopsy.
Importantly, the risk score also resulted in the
largest reduction of unnecessary repeat biopsies com-
pared to PSA and PCPTRC. If a risk, or the probability
threshold below which an intervention is not consid-
ered desirable, of having high-grade PCa detected
upon repeat biopsy of 15% is considered, that is,
similar to the overall prevalence of high-grade cancer
in the methylation-positive population, then the risk
score resulted in a 3.3- and 5.0-fold net reduction
in repeat biopsies compared to PCPTRC and PSA,
respectively. This net reduction is the unnecessary
repeat biopsy part of interventions avoided and
hence does not come at the cost of additional
high-grade PCa missed. In summary, in methylation-
positive men, and applying the same probability

 threshold of 15%, an additional 30 unnecessary repeat
biopsies per 100 patients would be avoided with the
risk score, compared to only nine and six for the
PCPTRC and PSA, respectively.
DISCUSSION
PCa screening and diagnosis debates center around
two goals that are often hard to reconcile. First, all
men with high-grade cancer should be identified as
early as possible, as these patients usually require
radical treatment. Second, men with low-grade PCa
should not be over-treated, especially because the
treatment could cause more harm than benefit [14].
The absence of DNA-methylation of GSTP1, APC,
or RASSF1 in PCa-negative, residual biopsy tissue
resulted in a NPV of 96% for high-grade cancer,
successfully addressing the over-treatment issue.
To better stratify methylation-positive patients for
the risk of harboring high-grade cancer missed by
biopsy, a novel algorithm was developed. EpiScore
weighs the DNA-methylation intensities of GSTP1,
RASSF1, and APC across a patient’s biopsy cores,
with significantly higher intensities observed in
men with high-grade PCa detected upon repeat
biopsy. EpiScore successfully identified men with
high-grade PCa that was missed by a prior biopsy,
and stratified men who are likely in higher need of
a repeat biopsy, due to an increased risk of occult,
high-grade cancer.
An important aspect of current and future clinical
research is a multimodal approach, integrating several
information sources to obtain the best possible,
most objective assessment for each individual patient.
Therefore, known, traditional risk factors were com-
bined with EpiScore into one holistic model, albeit
with the epigenetic component of this risk score being
the most significant and important risk factor. The
risk score consists of EpiScore, histopathology of
the cancer-negative index biopsy (atypia, HGPIN, or
benign) and a patient’s age at time of the index biopsy.
In this cohort the risk score resulted in an improved
patient segregation, with a higher AUC than EpiScore
alone. While the cohort was sufficiently complete for
all risk factors, at least to get an idea about the
potential contribution to the risk score, the missing
data for PSA and DRE might have led to over- or
under-interpretation of the actual effect for these
two factors. When available, the addition of PSA or
DRE to the risk score led to a minor, non-significant
increase of the overall model’s performance. How-
ever, in particular for DRE, inter-observer variability
could have an unexpected impact. When the risk
score was defined as the combination of EpiScore
and the clinical risk as predicted by the PCPT
risk calculator, EpiScore remained the most predictive
and
significant
factor,
however,
a
small
benefit
was again observed by adding clinical risk to the
molecular, epigenetic risk. Finally, the risk score
significantly outperformed currently used risk predic-
tion models such as the PCPTRC and PSA. In
summary, this risk score combines clinical risk factors
with EpiScore, resulting in an improved risk stratifica-
tion of high-grade PCa in histopathologically negative
biopsies.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of sufficient long-
term follow-up data, for example, pathological grades
were not available, and more extensive clinical infor-
mation, men with high-grade cancer were defined as
those with PCa-positive, GS �7 repeat biopsies. In
addition, data on Gleason patterns were also not
recorded, so a more detailed analysis of Gleason 3 þ 4

DCA illustrating the overall clinical utility of the risk score compared to PCPTRC and PSA. Clinical utility of the risk score is
demonstrated by the overall net benefit in detecting high-grade PCa corrected for unnecessary biopsies (A) and the net reduction in
interventions corrected for missed high-grade cancers (B).

The Prostate
 versus 4 þ 3 patients was not possible. While more
accurate risk classification tools exits, such as the
guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network, most of these are dependent, at least to
some extent, on the clinical GS used here [33]. Men
with GS6 cancer were not included in the cohort for
the development of the risk score, because risk
for men with clinical GS6 is harder to predict. This
also reflects a clinical reality, since upgrading of
clinical GS6 patients occurs frequently [23]. Inter-
observer variability could also play a role, since
centralized pathology review occurred only within
the DOCUMENT sub-cohort.
While it can be debated whether GS6 patients
should be detected by screening, such a statement
would only hold value when knowing the true
pathological GS. In addition, if disease progresses
over time, it would be more efficient to have such
patients monitored closely or predict who is at
increased risk for disease progression. For these two
reasons, men with clinical GS6 disease would still
benefit from being identified, however with lower
priority compared to men likely harboring high-grade
cancer.
While unique, optimal solutions were found for
the weighing factors in both EpiScore and the risk
score, closely related algorithms resulted in a similar
performance in terms of AUC. Therefore, cohorts for
validation studies would benefit from enrichment
for men with high-grade PCa detected upon repeat
biopsy, making the risk score more robust. In addi-
tion, future studies would also benefit from including
long-term follow-up, that is, radical prostatectomy
results and pathological GS. The same or a similar
algorithm could also be validated as an identification
tool for those patients diagnosed with GS6 that are
at risk of being under-graded. It remains to be
evaluated whether these epigenetic-based algorithms
or the applied molecular methodology could also
help triage such patients in active surveillance pro-
grams and separate those who are likely under-
graded or likely to progress, from those with stable,
low-grade disease.
Finally, besides the clinical performance, the clini-
cal utility of the risk score was investigated. A DCA
was executed, evaluating clinically acceptable proba-
bility thresholds above which a repeat biopsy is
warranted. Because this probability threshold is per-
sonal, it is important to note that the risk score
resulted in a net benefit, and the largest benefit
compared to PCPTRC and PSA, across the entire
range of clinically relevant probability thresholds. In
addition, the risk score also resulted in the largest
reduction of unnecessary repeat biopsies, again over
the entire range of clinically relevant probability
thresholds. This demonstrates the large clinical utility
of the risk score for men with a PCa-negative,
methylation-positive index biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS
Clinical practice is shifting towards more com-
plex integrations of several risk factors, rather than
relying on an individual (bio) marker. Here, a risk
score was developed that combines EpiScore and
known
clinical
risk
factors
into
one
algorithm,
identifying men at risk of harboring high-grade
PCa, despite a negative biopsy result. EpiScore is
an
epigenetic
profiling
algorithm
based
on
the
DNA-methylation
intensities
of
GSTP1,
RASSF1,
and APC and was the most significant and best
performing risk factor to identify men with occult,
high-grade PCa based on residual tissue of a prior
biopsy negative for PCa. A DCA indicated that the
risk
score
was
associated
with
the
largest
net
benefit and the largest avoidance of unnecessary
repeat biopsies, compared to two commonly used
methods for decision-making, that is, the PCPTRC
and PSA, demonstrating clinical utility.
