Abstract
Background and objectives Extended criteria donors represent nowadays a main resource for kidney trans-
plantation, and recovery criteria are becoming increasingly inclusive. However, the limits of this approach are not
clear as well as the effects of extreme donor ages on long-term kidney transplantation outcomes. To address these
issues, we performed a retrospective study on extended criteria donor kidney transplantation.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements In total, 647 consecutive extended criteria donor kidney
transplantations performed over 11 years (2003–2013) were included. Donor, recipient, and procedural variables
were classified according to donor age decades (group A, 50–59 years old [n=91]; group B, 60–69 years old
[n=264]; group C, 70–79 years old [n=265]; and group D, $80 years old [n=27]). Organs were allocated in single- or
dual-kidney transplantation after a multistep evaluation including clinical and histologic criteria. Long-term
outcomes and main adverse events were analyzed among age groups and in either single- or dual-kidney
transplantation. Kidney discard rate incidence and causes were evaluated.
Results Median follow-up was 4.9 years (25th; 75th percentiles: 2.7; 7.6 years); patient and graft survival were
comparable among age groups (5-year patient survival: group A, 87.8%; group B, 88.1%; group C, 88.0%; and
group D, 90.1%; P=0.77; graft survival: group A, 74.0%; group B, 74.2%; group C, 75.2%; and group D, 65.9%;
P=0.62) and between dual-kidney transplantation and single-kidney transplantation except for group D, with a
better survival for dual-kidney transplantation (P=0.04). No difference was found analyzing complications in-
cidence or graft function over time. Kidney discard rate was similar in groups A, B, and C (15.4%, 17.7%, and
20.1%, respectively) and increased in group D (48.2%; odds ratio, 5.1 with A as the reference group; 95% confi-
dence interval, 2.96 to 8.79).
Conclusions Discard rate and long-term outcomes are similar among extended criteria donor kidney trans-
plantation from donors ages 50–79 years old. Conversely, discard rate was strikingly higher among kidneys from
octogenarian donors, but appropriate selection provides comparable long-term outcomes, with better graft
survival for dual-kidney transplantation.

Introduction
In 1999, the analysis of .46,000 patients waitlisted for
kidney transplantation (KT) provided the first strong
evidence of KT superiority over dialysis as therapy
for ESRD (1). Subsequently, significant improvements
were also observed for elderly, diabetic, obese, and
cardiopathic patients as well as most of the subjects
displaying other major comorbidities (2–6).
Since then, the widening gap between transplant
demand and supply has prompted the expansion of
kidney recovery criteria (7). The use of elderly donors
resulted in acceptable but reduced graft survival, with a
greater susceptibility to delayed graft function (DGF)
and KT rejection (8,9). In this field, several strategies
have been proposed to improve organ allocation poli-
cies; among them, old for old protocols aim to match
the supposed graft survival to recipient life expectancy
(often irrespective from HLA match) (10), and the dual-
kidney transplantation (DKT) is intended to overcome
the imbalance between limited nephron mass from
older donors and the recipient metabolic request (11,12).
Nowadays, in many countries, about 30%–60% of
deceased kidney grafts are included in the so-called
extended criteria (13,14). However, as witnessed by
the heterogeneity of organ discard rate across the trans-
plant community (15), the limits of this policy are not
well defined, despite the development of several scor-
ing systems (16–18). In particular, donor age still
represents a major reason for organ discard, and to
our knowledge, very few studies have evaluated the
outcomes of kidneys from donors older than 70 years
old (19). To address these questions, we retrospectively
analyzed our experience over 11 years by classifying
KT from extended criteria donors (ECDs) in donor age
classes and emphasizing the most relevant long-term
outcomes together with the associated risk factors.

 Materials and Methods
Study Design
All of the deceased donor KTs performed at Turin
University Renal Transplant Center “A. Vercellone” from
January of 2003 to December of 2013 were considered.
From 1199 consecutive transplants, we excluded multi-
organ grafts; within the remaining 1124, we identified a
total of 647 KTs from ECDs. According to Crystal City
criteria (7), we defined ECDs as all of the donors older
than 60 years old and those ages 50–59 years old with at
least two of the following characteristics: serum creati-
nine at procurement .1.5 mg/dl, cerebrovascular cause
of death, or history of hypertension. The recipients’ follow-
up was performed with scheduled clinical visits or hos-
pital admissions when major complications occurred.
Data were collected from patients’ individual charts.
All procurement and post-transplant kidney biopsies
were analyzed by a single group of pathologists un-
changed throughout the study period. Follow-up ended
in November of 2015.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee
and performed in adherence with the last version of the
Helsinki Declaration. The clinical and research activities
being reported are consistent with the Principles of the
Declaration of Istanbul as outlined in the Declaration of
Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism.
Patients were divided in four groups according to donor
age: group A, 50–59 years old; group B, 60–69 years old;
group C, 70–79 years old; and group D, $80 years old.
Main outcomes were graft and patient survival. Secondary
outcomes were graft function at 1, 2, and 5 years, DGF
incidence, and acute rejection. Furthermore, we evaluated
the causes of graft failure and patient death as well as the
occurrence of other relevant post-transplant complications.
DGF was defined as the need for hemodialysis during the
first post-transplant week. Acute rejection was biopsy
proven. Kidney discard rate (KDR) was defined as the ra-
tio between recovered but not transplanted and total re-
covered kidneys.
Organ Allocation Policy
Suitable candidates were preselected by an algorithm on
the basis of three parameters: AB0 blood group, HLA (with a
minimum requirement of one DR and one A locus match),
and age range between donors and recipients 67 years.
Lack of dialysis access, high titer of panel reactive
antibodies, and time on waiting list .10 years were crite-
ria for preferential listing.
Subsequently, several parameters (donor age, cause of
death, kidney function, proteinuria, echography renal size,
cardiovascular or metabolic comorbidities, and smoking)
were analyzed to allocate kidneys directly to single-kidney
transplantation (SKT) or histologic evaluation.
When needle biopsy was performed, organ allocation
was accomplished on the basis of Karpinsky score. Between
2003 and 2006, we applied the policy proposed by Remuzzi
et al. (20) (score 0–3 to SKT, 4–6 to DKT, and $7 discar-
ded); subsequently, score 4 was considered suitable for
SKT on the basis of our favorable results in a pool of pa-
tients transplanted in 2006 (M. Messina, G.P. Segoloni, L.
Biancone, unpublished data). The efficacy of this approach
was later confirmed by other authors (21,22). When donor
age was .82 years old, organs were independently allo-
cated to DKT for any score ,7.
In the few doubtful cases, SKT/DKT allocation was on
the basis of a multidisciplinary assessment (nephrologist,
surgeon, and pathologist), and the other considered var-
iables were donor eGFR, renal size, and macroscopic organ
appearance at surgeon inspection.
Main recipient exclusion criteria for DKT were age $70
years old, chronic anticoagulant therapy, coronary artery
disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
and previous KT.
Immunosuppressive protocols were homogeneous for the
whole study period and specifically designed for ECD KT:
induction mainly with anti-CD25 antibody, use of steroid
and mycophenolate from the beginning, and sequential
introduction of calcineurin inhibitor at the established graft
functional recovery (serum creatinine #2.5 mg/dl) (23).
None of the retrieved kidneys had pulsatile perfusion.
Statistical Methods
Discrete data were described as percentages and ana-
lyzed with the Pearson chi-squared test or for small
samples, the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were
described as mean6SD when normal and median (25th;
75th percentile) when non-normally distributed.
Mann–Whitney test, Kruskal–Wallis test, paired t test,
or ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test were used when
appropriate. Cumulative graft and patient survival were
analyzed by Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves including only
the first transplant (n=573). Differences among groups
were established by log rank tests. Relevant variables
were checked first in univariate analysis and then, in-
cluded in a multivariate Cox model on the basis of statis-
tical and clinical significance. Transplant after the first
transplant is considered in this model. The risk of organ
discard was displayed as the odds ratio (OR) calculated
by logistic regression using donor age class as the cova-
riate; the reference population was group A. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 22
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Significance level for all tests was
set at P,0.05.
Results
Baseline KT Variables
The selected population was classified by donor age:
group A (50–59 years old) included 91 patients, group B
(60–69 years old) included 264 patients, group C (70–79
years old) included 265 patients, and group D ($80 years
old, with a maximum age of 88 years old) included 27
patients. Main donor-, recipient-, and transplant-associated
characteristics are comparable among the four classes
(Table 1).
The only dissimilarities were observed in DKT preva-
lence and recipient age as a consequence of our allocation
criteria (Materials and Methods). Age distribution is
showed in Supplemental Figure 1.
Another significant difference was found when analyz-
ing recipients’ native nephropathies, with the highest in-
cidence of glomerular diseases in group A, whereas
hypertensive nephropathy predominated in group D
(P=0.05) (Supplemental Table 1).

 In total, 688 kidneys from ECDs were transplanted in 647
recipients; in the 567 preimplantation biopsies available, no
differences were found in Karpinsky score among the four
groups (group A, 2.561.1; group B, 2.461.0; group C,
2.461.0; and group D, 2.961.4; P=0.09).
Effect of Donor Age and KT Allocation on Patient and Graft
Outcomes
By KM curve analysis, we investigated the donor age
association with patient and graft survival (Figure 1).
Median follow-up was 4.9 (2.7; 7.6) years without dif-
ferences in the four subpopulations (Supplemental
Figure 2).
In the KM model, patient survival was similar among
the four groups, irrespective of the allocation policy in
SKT or DKT (at 5 years: group A, 87.8%; group B, 88.1%;
group C, 88.0%; and group D, 90.1%; P=0.77), as it was
for graft survival (5 years: group A, 74.0%; group B,
74.2%; group C, 75.2%; and group D, 65.9%; P=0.62),
even in death-censored curves (5 years: group A,
82.3%; group B, 83.8%; group C, 83.9%; and group D,
76.5%; P=0.66) (Figure 1). No significant difference was
found when death and graft loss causes were compared
among the four subsets (P=0.10 and P=0.87, respectively)
(Supplemental Tables 2 and 3), even if oncologic mortal-
ity displayed an age-related trend (0% in group A versus
7.4% in group D).
Likewise, by comparing SKT and DKT, irrespective from
donor age classes, we found no significant difference for
patient or graft survival, even when data were censored for
death.
We subsequently analyzed DKT and SKT within the
study groups, with the exception of group A, which was
excluded due to its negligible number of DKT (one of 91).
Outcome similarities between DKT and SKT were con-
firmed in groups B and C, whereas DKT from octogenar-
ians showed better overall graft survival (P=0.04) (Figure
2). Group D SKT also had worse results compared with
SKT from the other groups (P=0.03) but not after death
censoring (Figure 3).
Also, graft function in the four groups was comparable at
all considered time points (Supplemental Figure 3A). Like-
wise, no differences were found when the same analysis
was performed within DKT or SKT (Supplemental Figure
3, B and C).
Donor age classes did not correlate with the vast majority
of considered adverse events, including vascular and
urologic complications, new-onset diabetes, and malignan-
cies (Supplemental Table 4). An appropriate statistical
power was reached when analyzing groups A, B, and C;
this was not true for group D due to the relatively small
sample size and number of the events.
Acute rejection rates were comparable in the four groups
(P=0.80). Regarding DGF, the maximum incidence was
reached in SKT in octogenarians (nearly 60%), much
higher than in DKT of the same group (27.3%); however,
this difference did not reach statistical significance. Addi-
tionally, primary nonfunction was absent in group A. It is
noteworthy that infection rates seemed to be lower in
group D (Supplemental Table 5). This was particularly
true for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (11.1% versus
26.4% of group A, 31.8% of group B, and 28.3% of group
C; P=0.04), and it was not related to pretransplant donor
or recipient serology.
Influence of Others Variables on Long-Term Graft
Outcomes
We then investigated the effect of other variables
on main transplant outcomes. Univariate analysis
highlighted a significant association of DGF with patient

classes.

 death. Graft loss was more common in older recipients and
those who had experienced DGF or acute rejection; how-
ever, after death censoring, the association with recipient
age was no longer significant, whereas CMV infection
emerged as a relevant cause. To confirm these results and
exclude potentially confounding factors, a multivariate Cox
model was attempted; DGF occurrence and acute rejection
but not donor or recipient age were found to be indepen-
dent predictors of worse death-censored graft outcomes
(Table 2).
KDR
Finally, we analyzed KDR, its underlying causes, and
its correlation with donor age (Table 3). KDRs of the three
younger donor age classes were similar (50–59 years old:
15.4%; 60–69 years old: 17.7%; OR, 1.22; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.78 to 1.91; 70–79 years old: 20.1%;
OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.38). Conversely KDR of octo-
genarian donors was significantly increased (48.2%; OR,
5.10; 95% CI, 2.96 to 8.79). Most of discard causes were
age related; in particular, macroscopic flaws and Karpin-
sky score .6 were found in 20% and 11.8%, respectively,
of organs harvested from donors $80 years old versus
4.8% and 3.7%, respectively, of those from the youngest
ECDs (P,0.001).
Discussion
In this study, we analyzed outcomes of ECD KT
according to donor age decades from 50 to .80 years old.
Grafts were allocated as SKT or DKT or discarded after a
multistep evaluation. Overall, we did not find significant
outcome difference among the four age groups; conversely,
when SKT/DKT allocation was considered, SKT from very
old donors performed worse compared with both DKT
from the same class or the other SKT.
ECDs are nowadays the most relevant pool of deceased
kidney donors in several transplant centers worldwide
(14). Very old donors may represent a reliable resource to
further expand this class; nevertheless, data on extreme
age decades are currently limited. Collini et al. (24) showed
encouraging results in 38 KTs from donors .75 years old:
graft survival, complication rates, and renal function were
only slightly worse than in recipients of younger ECDs.
More recently, Gallinat et al. (19) showed fairly good

 long-term outcomes in 52 KTs from donors ages $75 years
old using an old for old allocation policy, where only low-
comorbidity patients were suitable to receive organs from
this ECD group. Conversely, in a large analysis of the
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data, trans-
plants from ECDs older than 70 years old were associated
with high risks of graft loss and patient death, especially
when allocated to recipients ,60 years old (25). These re-
sults are partially contradictory, with local experiences
outperforming registry data but displaying a relatively short
follow-up and a lower number of patients. Additionally,
data on donors $80 years old are currently anecdotal (26).
In this paper, we retrospectively reviewed about 650 KTs
from ECDs with a median follow-up of 4.9 years; moreover,
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
specifically focused on donors $80 years old and the first
study to divide the ECD cohort into decades to specifically
investigate age class-related outcomes.

 Indeed, a previous paper on the UNOS registry data
(1995–2008) by Tullius et al. (27) analyzed donor age de-
cades from 40 to 70 years old, but it was not focused on
ECD and did not considered octogenarian donors.
In our population, donor age classes displayed similar
patient and graft survival rates, and renal function was
comparable among groups at different times. The over-
lapping outcomes between SKT and DKT in the three
donor age decades from 50 to 79 years old suggest that our
allocation system is efficient to avoid underperforming SKT
or a DKT excess. Conversely, SKT from octogenarian
donors had a significantly lower graft survival rate com-
pared with DKT of the same group. This difference was not
confirmed for patient- and death-censored graft survival or
when SKTs from group D were compared with those of the
other age classes, even if a strong tendency is evident. We
than speculated that kidneys from octogenarian donors
should be preferentially allocated to DKT. However, our
results might be influenced by our recipient selection policy
and should be confirmed with larger studies.
According to these findings, organs from extremely aged
donors represent a resource that should be accurately
evaluated. In the near future, by routinely expanding novel
evaluation tools (i.e., analyzing vascular resistance and
perfusate biomarkers during kidney machine recondition-
ing or donor urinary biomarkers for ischemia-reperfusion
injury [28–30]), an even more accurate allocation will be
possible.
A possible criticism of our multistep algorithm is the
increase in cold ischemia time (CIT), which may be
particularly relevant for these fragile organs as reaffirmed
in a recent work by Aubert et al. (15).
This putative additional risk has to be counterbalanced
by an efficient multidisciplinary approach able to restrain
procedural times. In our experience, CIT was limited to 18
hours, shorter than the threshold of 20 hours associated
with worse outcomes in a large cohort of KTs (31). Inter-
estingly, Tanriover et al. (12) analyzed UNOS records of
ECD KT performed almost in the same period of this study
(i.e., 2002–2012); data were classified according to donor
risk categories and CIT ranged between 18.1 and 25.5
hours.
It should be highlighted that we used an ECD-dedicated
induction protocol to avoid early calcineurin-inhibitor
toxicity and limit DGF occurrence (23).
With regard to infections, it is intriguing to find lower
rates in recipients from the oldest donor class, discordantly
with previous literature evidences (32), even if this study is
not empowered to analyze this issue. This could possibly
be because of tailored maintenance immunosuppressive
protocols aimed to spare steroids and mycophenolate
and/or reduce calcineurin-inhibitor levels in the older re-
cipients. Another explanation might be the a priori selec-
tion of candidates for DKT who are at a greater extent in
the oldest class of donors.
Despite the tailored immunosuppressive load, we found
comparable acute rejection rates in the four classes. This
result could be expected as a cause of impaired immuno-
reactivity of the elderly. On the other side, the higher
immunologic risk associated with an organ from an older
donor as underlined by Tullius et al. (27) must be taken
into account.
As confirmed by the Cox regression model, DGF and
rejection rate remain key risk factors, even in the ECD
scenario; CMV infection is an additional risk accordingly
to a previous report (33).
A monocentric study is perceived as inferior with respect
to multicentric or registry data analysis. However, retro-
spective multicenter studies may include data from groups
applying different allocation policies or heterogeneous
immunosuppressive strategies. Also, registry studies
have the advantage of analyzing a large amount of data;
however, several aspects are not included in databases, and
again, data are collected from centers with different clinical
policies. Our study is characterized by a wide range of data
coming from 650 KTs performed with the same surgical
and clinical management, the same team of expert pathol-
ogists, and the same team of transplant nephrologists who
followed the patients in the long term with all data
recorded in patients’ charts. These prerequisites may

 consistently limit several confounding variables that could
have deeply affected study results.
Organ selection policy deeply influences the reliability of
transplant programs and concerns the extent of waiting lists
and short- and long-term KT outcomes; thus, we considered
KDR analysis as an essential element of this study. Com-
pared with the largest KT registries worldwide, KDR of
donors ages 50–80 years old was lower than in the UNOS
reports and consistent with the Eurotransplant program re-
ports (12,34); conversely, a striking increase is evident for
donors older than 80 years old. Major causes of organ dis-
card were biopsy findings (Karpinsky score .6) and macro-
scopic flaws; both were strictly age related. Surprisingly, this
trend was not observed for donor-related contraindications
discovered after organ harvesting (especially neoplasia).
Notably, selection criteria remained unchanged for all
donor classes. These findings suggest that organs from
octogenarians require an accurate evaluation; however,
they should not be excluded from KT programs as under-
lined by the acceptable outcomes displayed.
In conclusion, in this study, we analyzed the long-term
experience of ECD KT including very old donors (70–79
and $80 years old). Our data suggest that these extreme
ECDs are a valid source of organs but that they have to be
accurately selected and managed with dedicated proto-
cols, especially with regard to octogenarian donors. There-
fore, an a priori selection of donors only on the basis of age
cutoff is unjustified for not only donors between 70 and 79
years old with KDRs similar to those of younger ECDs but
also, donors 80 years old and older, among whom .50%
of harvested kidneys were transplanted with acceptable
long-term results.
