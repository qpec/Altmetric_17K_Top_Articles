Impact of disease screening on awareness
and management of hypertension and
diabetes between 2011 and 2015: results
from the China health and retirement
longitudinal study
Chihua Li1 and L. H. Lumey2*
Abstract
Background: There has been a limited recognition of hypertension and diabetes in China which has compromised
optimal treatment. It is not clear if a screening program implemented by a national health survey has improved
awareness and management of these conditions.
Methods: The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is an ongoing longitudinal health survey
conducted since 2011 among Chinese people aged 45 years and older. Participants have been assessed every two
years by interviews, physical examinations, and fasting glucose samples were taken in 2011. In 2013 and 2015,
participants were asked about awareness and management of selected chronic diseases, and they first became
aware of these conditions.
Results: Of the 11,000+ participants screened in 2011, 4594 were identified with hypertension and 1703 with
diabetes by medical examinations. Over 80% of the middle-aged and elderly Chinese diagnosed with hypertension
and/or diabetes in 2011 reported in 2015 that they were unaware of the disease(s). Although some improvement
was observed between 2011 and 2015, the main reason for the increase in awareness was a medical examination
initiated by the study participant (over 75%), by their work unit or community (12–15%), and rarely (less than 3%)
by the CHARLS examination. Participants with a rural household registration status and lower BMI were the most
likely to be unaware and to remain unaware of their condition(s).
Conclusions: Disease screening in CHARLS did not lead to significant improvements in awareness of hypertension
and diabetes. Improvements should be made by the systematic feedback of screening results to survey participants
and the monitoring of disease awareness over time. This will be essential to improve disease recognition and
facilitate optimal management.

 Background
The rapidly increasing burden of chronic diseases in low
and middle-income countries poses a major public
health challenge across the world [1–3]. Recent studies
also document the high prevalence of unrecognized dia-
betes [4, 5] and hypertension [6–9] among the Chinese
population, and suggest that the low awareness of these
conditions impedes their effective control and manage-
ment [4–9]. Because hypertension and diabetes are im-
portant risk factors not only for cardiovascular but also
for other diseases, their timely diagnosis and adequate
management is crucial for the prevention of adverse
health outcomes [10–17].
Although epidemiologic studies highlight the urgent
need to improve awareness and treatment of hypertension
and diabetes in China [4–9], they have not yet examined if
screening for disease does improve participants’ awareness
and disease management. In addition, it is not known how
individuals with hypertension or diabetes in China first be-
came aware of their condition(s) and what factors may
have contributed to changes in awareness over time.
In this study, we examine the impact of a screening
program on an individual’s awareness of hypertension
and diabetes between 2011 and 2015 and the manage-
ment of these conditions using data from the China
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).
We identify sources of disease awareness and factors
that contribute to improved awareness. Our findings are
relevant to help formulate more effective programs to
improve awareness and management of these chronic
conditions in China and other developing countries.
Methods
Study design and procedures
Starting in 2011, participants for the China Health and
Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were selected
using a four-stage stratified cluster sampling method [18].
First, 150 county-level units from 28 provinces in China
were sampled to represent a mix of urban and rural sit-
tings with a wide variation of economic development.
Then three primary sampling units (PSU), administrative
villages in rural areas or residential neighborhoods in
urban areas, were sampled within each county, resulting
in a total of 450 villages/neighborhoods. Next, the dwell-
ings in each PSU were mapped and 24 of the mapped
households in each PSU were sampled for further studies.
At every stage, further sampling was done by random se-
lection. In each selected household, one individual aged
45 or older was invited to participate together with his or
her spouse, if available. Overall, 17,708 participants from
10,257 households were interviewed; the overall house-
hold response rate was 80.5%.
The 2011 structured home interview was designed
to collect information on basic demographics, family
characteristics, participants’ health status, health care and
insurance, and family economics, including employment
and pensions, household and individual income and fam-
ily expenditures. Participants were asked if they had ever
been diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension. Later phys-
ical examinations included the measurement of height,
weight, and blood pressure. These results were communi-
cated to participants during the examination. Medically
trained staff from the Chinese Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) collected fasting venous blood
samples using a standard protocol. Assays of the fasting
glucose level and HbA1c were later carried out by central
study laboratories in Beijing. Based on the informed
consent, blood test results were mailed to participants
three weeks after specimen collection [19]. However,
we found no records how and when the diabetes
blood test results were reported to study participants.
Among those interviewed, 13,610 (76.9%) underwent
a physical examination and 11,018 (62.2%) agreed to
provide a fasting blood sample.
After 2011, study participants were re-interviewed
every two years to monitor any changes over time in
their health, economic, or social conditions. Participants
were asked again if they had ever been diagnosed with
hypertension or diabetes. Physical examinations were
repeated in 2013 and 2015. Over 80% of participants
interviewed in 2011 continued to participate in 2015, of
this 85% underwent a physical examination in 2015.
Blood samples were collected again in 2015, but to date,
no assay results have been distributed for this year.
Measures
For this study, hypertension was defined as (1) a mean
systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg or higher; or
(2) a mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg
or higher; and/or (3) a current use of anti-hypertensive
medication [6]. Diabetes was defined as (1) a fasting
plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or
higher; or (2) HbA1c concentration of 6.5% or higher; or
(3) a self-report of doctor diagnosed diabetes [20].
Patients with hypertension or diabetes were defined as
being aware of their condition if they reported they had
ever been diagnosed. If so, they were asked how they be-
came aware of the diagnosis: (1) by a physical examin-
ation for specific health conditions; (2) by a physical
examination organized by their work unit or community;
(3) by a physical examination organized by CHARLS; (4)
or by other means.
Patients were then interviewed how their hypertension
or diabetes was managed and/or monitored in the past
12 months and if they had received any specific treat-
ments or medical advice. For hypertension, participants
were asked if they had their blood pressure measured for
at least once in the past year; if the treatments had
Li and Lumey BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:421

 included Chinese traditional medicine or Western medi-
cine; and if medical recommendations had included
weight control, exercise, diet or smoking control. Also,
hypertensive participants whose SBP was lower than
140 mmHg and DBP was lower than 90 mmHg were
considered to have their hypertension well-controlled.
For diabetes, participants were asked if they had been
given blood/urine glucose tests, or fundus examinations,
or micro-albuminuria tests; if the treatments had in-
cluded Chinese traditional medicine, Western medicine,
or insulin injections; and if the medical recommenda-
tions had included weight control, exercise, diet, smok-
ing control, or foot care.
Participants’ age was categorized into three groups
(45–59, 60–69, and > =70 years), resident status was cat-
egorized into rural or urban Hukou (household registra-
tion status), and education was categorized as illiterate
(cannot read or write), literate (received informal educa-
tion or primary school education less than 5 years), pri-
mary school (5 to 6 years education), and junior school
and above (received education for over 6 years). Per capita
monthly household expenditure (PCE) (log-transformed)
rather than income was used to define household resources
following previous studies [5, 21]. Body mass index (BMI)
was reported in three categories based on Asian-specific
cutoffs: < 23 kg/m2 (Normal), 23 to < 27.5 kg/m2 (Over-
weight), and ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 (Obese) [22, 23].
Statistical analysis
Demographic characteristics for CHARLS participants in
2011 and 2015 were tabulated separately for individuals
with hypertension and diabetes, stratified by diagnosis
awareness. National (‘weighted’) estimates were made
using the survey sampling weights for each participant.
These weights take the multi-level sampling design of
the study into account and any missing information among
study participants on anthropometric measures and/or
blood assays. Analyses were performed with and without
the survey sampling weights and the results were in close
agreement. The main findings reported here reflect the ori-
ginal survey results. National (‘weighted’) estimates are pre-
sented in Additional file 1. Data collected in 2013 were also
examined and are presented in Additional file 1.
Among individuals diagnosed with diabetes and/or
hypertension in 2011 who were not aware of their condi-
tion, we compared the characteristics of those who were
still not aware of their condition in 2015 with those
who were. All analyses were conducted with StataSE
15 (StataCorp, College Station, USA).
Results
Overall, full data were available for 9357 participants
who completed surveys in both 2011 and 2015. Their
baseline characteristics in 2011 are presented in Table 1.
In 2011, 4594 (49.1%) of participants had a positive
screening result for hypertension, 53.7% (n = 2466) of
these were aware of their condition and 46.3% (n =
2128) were not, and 27.2% (n = 1251) did not have their
hypertension well-controlled. Aware hypertension pa-
tients were more likely to be women, older, have urban
Hukou status and have higher BMIs compared to those
not aware. They were less likely to be current smokers
or to be consuming alcohol. For diabetes, 1703 (18.2%)
of participants had a positive screening result, and only
33.4% (n = 568) of these participants were aware of their
condition and 66.6% (n = 1135) were not aware. Similar
associations between hypertension awareness and dia-
betes awareness and demographic characteristics were
observed.
In 2015, the majority of unaware hypertension patients
(1704 of 2128, 80.1%) and diabetes patients (972 of 1135,
85.6%) were still not aware of their condition (Additional
file 1: Table S1), in spite of their positive screening re-
sults in 2011. And 25.7% (n = 1180) of those 4594 partic-
ipants with positive hypertensive screening results in
2011 did not have their hypertension well-controlled in
2015. The disease awareness for hypertension and dia-
betes was somewhat higher in 2015 compared to 2011.
Similar associations with demographic characteristics
were observed in 2011 and 2015. Findings related to the
awareness of hypertension and diabetes were similar in
2013 and 2015, but any changes relative to the 2011 sur-
vey were not yet as pronounced in 2013 as in 2015
(Additional file 1: Table S2).
Some improvements in awareness and management of
diabetes and hypertension were observed between 2011
and 2015 (Fig. 1). Among participants who had a posi-
tive screening result for hypertension in 2011, the pro-
portion aware of this condition increased from 53.7 to
62.9%
(17.1%
improvement),
having
blood
pressure
monitored at least once in the past 12 months increased
from 39.9 to 42.8% (7.3% improvement), having received
current medication increased from 41.6 to 51.0% (22.6%
improvement), and having received medical advice from
doctors at least once in the past 12 months increased
from 29.2 to 36.6% (20.2% improvement).
Among participants who had a positive screening re-
sult for diabetes in 2011, the proportion aware of this
condition increased from 33.4 to 42.9% (28.4% improve-
ment), having received tests to monitor their diabetic
condition at least once in the past 12 months increased
from 26.4 to 37.8% (43.2% improvement), having re-
ceived current medication increased from 23.6 to 33.6%
(42.4% improvement), and having received medical ad-
vice from doctors at least once in the past 12 months in-
creased from 25.0 to 31.2% (24.8% improvement).
Above improvements, especially in disease aware-
ness, can be mainly attributed to sources other than

 CHARLS screening (Table 2). Among 2890 hyperten-
sion patients who were aware of their condition in
2015, 76.8% reported that they learned the diagnosis
(either before or after 2011) from a physical examin-
ation (unrelated to CHARLS screening) for specific
health conditions, 11.9% from a physical examination
organized by their work unit or community, and only
2.6% from the screening organized by CHARLS. A
similar pattern was observed among the 731 aware
diabetes patients. From the CHARLS documentation,
it is not clear if the physical examination for specific
health conditions was prompted by a visit to medical
doctors for other ailments or not.
Baseline characteristics of hypertension and diabetes
patients who were unaware of their condition in 2011
are compared between those who in 2015 became aware
of their condition or not (Table 3). Among the 2128 par-
ticipants with unknown hypertension and 1135 partici-
pants with unknown diabetes in 2011, those with urban
Hukou status and higher BMI were more likely to be-
come aware of their condition in 2015.
National estimates based on the survey findings were
obtained by using the survey sampling weights, extend-
ing our findings to the entire Chinese population aged
45 and older (Additional file 1: Table S3). Over 80%
(83.4 of 101.7 million) of all middle-aged and elderly

 Chinese with undiagnosed hypertension in 2011 are
likely to still be unaware of their condition in 2015, and
over 85% (42.3 of 48.1 million) of those with undiag-
nosed diabetes.
Discussion
Our findings show that CHARLS participants diagnosed
with hypertension and/or diabetes showed some im-
provement in disease awareness and between 2011 and
2015. Many more reported they were unaware of their
condition, four years after the health survey. Improve-
ments in disease awareness came mostly from a physical
examination for specific health conditions unrelated to
CHARLS (over 75%) or an examination organized by a
work unit or community (12–15%). The CHARLS
screening in 2011 contributed less than 3% to the im-
provement in disease awareness.
Several reasons could explain the limited increase in
reported disease awareness in 2015. First, some partici-
pants may not have received the physical examination
and blood test results from the 2011 survey; second, they
may have not understood the results; or third, they may
have forgotten the results. Alternatively, they may have
been unwilling to recognize that they had been diag-
nosed with diabetes or hypertension and also failed to
take appropriate measures for disease management. This
will need further study.
According to available CHARLS documentation (Add-
itional file 2), the blood test results included cell counts
processed by local Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
units. These were mailed to addresses provided by study
participants. No information is provided in CHARLS
documentation on the nature of any health consultations,
either what specific clarifications or medical advice might
have been given at the time the physical examination or
when diabetes blood test results were reported to study
participants.
Further
analyses
including
glucose
and
HbA1c assays were later carried out by central study la-
boratories in Beijing. The CHARLS documents make no
mention of communication of further diabetes testing to
study participants. However, based on the follow-up inter-
views in 2013 and 2015, we know that only a small pro-
portion of CHARLS participants reported that they
learned about their hypertension and/or diabetes status by
this screening. Future CHARLS protocols will need to
clarify how a systematic and effective feedback of screen-
ing results to survey participants will be accomplished. In
CHARLS, there were still many participants who did not
have any hypertension or diabetes treatment in 2015 des-
pite being informed of their condition in 2011. It will be
interesting to explore reasons for why those participants
did not have treatment in future studies.
Our findings on disease awareness and management were
in agreement with results from earlier cross-sectional

 studies [3, 4, 9, 24]. This study further demonstrates
through a well-conducted follow-up study that disease
screening may only have limited impact on improving
awareness of disease. This study highlights that con-
ducting a good follow-up study does not necessarily
translate into imparting adequate or appropriate infor-
mation on hypertension and diabetes status to study
participants. It appears that more effective follow-up
procedures will be needed to improve the awareness
and management of diabetes and hypertension after
CHARLS examinations. This will require specific at-
tention to the distribution of test results, counseling,
and the provision of health care services.
Documenting changes of disease awareness and man-
agement over time in surveys is important, as this could
also help identify individuals at risk who remain unaware
of their conditions. Overall, we found that CHARLS par-
ticipants with rural Hukou status are less likely to be
aware they have diabetes or hypertension and were less
likely to benefit from the CHARLS screening. Compar-
ing patients with hypertension and diabetes, we noticed
that patients unaware of one condition were also more
likely to be unaware of the other, suggesting a cluster of
unawareness.
Extensive evidence has shown that blood pressure con-
trol and blood glucose control can significantly reduce

 adverse cardiovascular events [10–13, 25, 26] and pre-
vent other adverse health outcomes [14–17]. For ex-
ample, one clinical trial has shown that even a small
reduction in blood pressure could significantly reduce
the risk of heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarc-
tion [26]. Therefore targeted interventions should be
considered in individuals with hypertension or diabetes
identified by the CHARLS survey. It must be assured
that they have adequate access to relevant health infor-
mation and opportunities to take appropriate actions.
Since CHARLS is one of the cohort studies that fol-
lows the design of the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) in the United States, we reviewed the reporting of
physical examination results in other studies of the HRS
family. Among the 18 HRS family studies worldwide, most
had collected blood samples [27, 28]. Some [29, 30] but
not all studies reported test results back to study partici-
pants and some [18, 31–33] provided specific advice to
study participants that they seek a health consultation. As
an example, the HRS protocol lists specific procedures for
the reporting of blood test results to study participants. In
all, the protocol lists 27 items, including complete blood
cell counts, fasting glucose, and HbA1c [29, 34, 35]. In the
English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), all blood test
results from study participants are reported to their pri-
mary care physicians (‘general practitioners’) [32]. To the
best of our knowledge, however, no studies from the HRS
family have at this point systematically evaluated the rela-
tion between a positive disease finding in earlier survey
rounds and changes in disease awareness in subsequent
examinations. The observed variations in the reporting of
screening results across HRS studies could reflect cultural
differences in participant expectation and the role and
function of health surveys. This needs further exploration.
Our findings raise important questions about the ef-
fective communication of screening results not only in
CHARLS but also in other health surveys. In CHARLS,
the change in awareness was similar for hypertension
and diabetes. One possible explanation is that screening,
in either health surveys or other contexts, is seen simply
as an isolated process and not as a tool for follow-up,
treatment, or referral. In China, individuals were too
often expected to take actions by themselves after re-
ceiving the screening results [36]. It is important there-
fore that increased efforts are made to make sure that
participants do understand the medical examination re-
sults and are motivated to access the appropriate health
services where needed. As part of these efforts, separate
studies should be initiated to identify effective tools for
the communication of screening results. Several methods,
including follow-up phone calls or even direct medical re-
ferrals, could be explored to address this problem. In gen-
eral, we recommend the systematic monitoring of disease
awareness over time in longitudinal studies so that
communication
procedures
can
be
improved
where
needed. Thereby the impact of these and other screening
programs on participants’ health can be maximized.
Conclusions
While we observed an increase in hypertension and dia-
betes awareness over time in the CHARLS survey, the
persistent limited awareness of these conditions remains
a major public health concern. Our findings suggest a
‘failure to act on the findings from screening’ [36] as also
reported for a previous hypertension program. To be
more effective, disease screening programs need to pay
attention not only to effective diagnosis but also to the
systematic evaluation of measures related to disease
awareness and management. If awareness remains low,
communications with study participants will need to be
improved. The CHARLS findings to date suggest that
populations with rural Hukou status are most likely to
benefit most from targeted screening studies that in-
corporate these insights.
