Abstract
Background: Repeated nucleotide sequences combined with proteins called telomeres cover chromosome ends
and dictate cells lifespan. Many factors can modify telomere length, among them are: nutrition and smoking habits,
physical activities and socioeconomic status measured by education level.
The aim of the study was to determine the influence of above mentioned factors on peripheral blood mononuclear
cells telomere length.
Methods: Study included 28 subjects (seven male and 21 female, age 18–65 years.), smokers and non-smokers
without any serious health problems in past and present. Following a basic medical examination, patients completed
the food frequency questionnaire with 17 foods and beverages most common groups and gave blood for testing.
PBMC telomere length were measured with qualitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) method and
expressed as a T/S ratio.
Results: Among nine food types (cereal, fruits, vegetables, diary, red meat, poultry, fish, sweets and salty snacks) and
eight beverages (juices, coffee, tea, mineral water, alcoholic- and sweetened carbonated beverages) only intake of red
meat was related to T/S ratio. Individuals with increased consumption of red meat have had higher T/S ratio and the
strongest significant differences were observed between consumer groups: “never” and “1–2 daily” (p = 0.02). Smoking
habits, physical activity, LDL and HDL concentrations, and education level were not related to telomere length, directly
or as a covariates.
Conclusions: Unexpected correlation of telomere length with the frequency of consumption of red meat indicates the
need for further in-depth research and may undermine some accepted concepts of adverse effects of this diet on the
health status and life longevity.

Introduction
Telomeres are special structures consisting of repeating
DNA chain sequences (TTAGGG) and a complex of few
proteins. They are located at the ends of chromosomes
and play a role in covering the cell genome and control-
ling number of cell divisions. Thus, affect cell lifespan.
When shortening of telomeres during cell division
reaches a critical length, cellular senescence is triggered.
Since cellular longevity is affected by telomere length,
individuals with longer telomeres should expect higher
life expectancy. Very short telomere lengths may activate
different repair mechanisms e.g. unlock telomerase –
enzyme that can rebuild telomere sequences or ALT
(Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres), which can lead
to cell immortalization and tumor growth.
Numerous factors can affect shortening and rebuilding
of telomeres [1–4], but previous studies did not yield a
clear answer to the question what is a relationship
between telomere length and some disorders [5, 6] or
life expectancy [7, 8].
Diet is a common variable that can have significant
impact on human health. Compliance with dietary

 pyramid is required for maintaining wellbeing. At the
top of the pyramid is red meat, which should be eaten
with moderation, preferably two or three times a week.
Red meat is a good source of high amounts of protein
and vitamins, especially B1, B12, PP and easily assimilable
iron. Excessive consumption of red meat is accompanied
by an increased ingestion of dietary fat with low level of
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and toxic substances
formed during thermal treatment of meat. It may also
affect the serum lipid profile while raising LDL concen-
tration – which is widely recognized as a risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases [9]. Several studies have shown
that high red meat consumption can increase the inci-
dence of colorectal and breast cancer [10–14], and DNA
damage. Greater intake of red meat can induce DNA
damage and may have an impact on the “Telomere
Length” (TL). Main sources of DNA damage are oxida-
tive stress [15] and inflammation. Heme iron from meat
can cause DNA damage in vitro through lipid peroxida-
tion products [16]. Increased intake of saturated fatty
acids (SFA) may induce oxidative stress and thus en-
hance DNA-damage [17, 18].
The aim of this 3-year prospective observational study
was to determine the effect of diet, smoking habit, phys-
ical activity and education on telomere length of periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Results of a
cross-sectional analysis of baseline data are presented.
Materials and methods
Study population
The study included 28 individuals, (21 females and seven
males). A detailed description of the study population is
presented in Table 1. Inclusion criteria were: age 18–65
years, smoking habit: never smoker and current smoker,
no significant abnormalities on physical examination,
signed informed consent form to participate in the study.
Exclusion criteria: previous or ongoing major diseases in-
cluding proliferative diseases and mental health disorders,
pregnancy (excluded by pregnancy urine test), running
disease during the follow-up to severe or poor prognosis.
Study design
Patients enrolled to the study, after a routine physical
examination, were asked to fill out a questionnaire. This
questionnaire was especially developed by the authors
for the study. To simplify the filling, questions with dif-
ferent answers (checkbox) were used. The questionnaire
consisted of three parts concerning: nutrition habits,
food and beverages types and physical activity. It was
filled out offhand during a visit, in the presence of a
physician or nurse, for additional help. After completing
the survey, anthropometric measurements were con-
ducted and detailed information about smoking habit
was obtained from smokers. Previous laboratory test
results (up to 12 months before enrollment) were ob-
tained from patients’ medical records. At the end of the
visit, blood was collected to determine telomere length.
Telomere measurement
Telomere length was assessed as a relative average telo-
mere length (T/S ratio) by PCR according to the method
described by Cawthon R.M [19]. Firstly, 9 mL of venous
blood was collected into EDTA tubes. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from human
peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation using
Histopaque® 1077 solution (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis,
MO) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Afterwards, the PBMCs were washed three times in PBS
and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. DNA was
isolated from PBMC using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The concentration and quality of DNA obtained were
assessed by spectrophotometry (Picodrop). After collect-
ing enough samples telomere length was assessed by
quantitive real-time PCR.

The reaction was carried out in triplicate. In order to
perform a standard curve, dilution series of DNA were
prepared (concentration range from 0.6 ng/μL to 5 ng/
μL). The real-time PCR was on a 7900 HT Fast Real-
Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Precise reaction conditions for PCR (primer concen-
tration, reaction time and temperature) were determined
empirically. The specificity of the PCR reaction was
checked based on melting curves, obtained at the end of
each PCR.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or
median and range. Differences between groups with nor-
mal distribution were calculated with t-test, ANOVA
and adequate post-hoc tests. Survey data not normally
distributed were assessed with nonparametric tests.
ANCOVA models were used to adjust potential preexist-
ing differences e.g. the effect of age or smoking habit on
telomere length. All analyses were performed using the
STATISTICA (data analysis software system), version 12.

Results
Diet
Results of analysis of diet survey are shown in Table 2.
This survey has been limited to provide eating times of
a specific food per unit of time (day or week) due to
the difficulty in determining the accurate food portion
size. It was assumed that subjects have eaten average
portion size. Available food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) proved to be too long and complicated. The
survey was constructed in a comprehensible form,
easy to be filled-up by all subjects and assess the
average
intake
of
groups
of
products
(food
and
drinks) on a basis of daily nutrition. The survey used
quantitative research methods to identify 6 “frequency
consumption groups”:
F0 never
F1 once weekly or less,
F2 once daily in 2–3 days of week,
F3 once daily in 4–6 days of week,
F4 1–2x daily (at least one meal),
F5 3–5x daily (every meal),
We found no association between telomere length
and the number of meals eaten per day. Eating break-
fast - important for the proper diet - turned out to be
irrelevant to telomeres. Neither the beginning nor the
end of the daily diet had any effect on telomeres
though shown its impact on external appearance.
After analysis of obtained data it was found that only
red meat consumption was associated with the relative
length of telomeres (T/S ratio) (Table 2). The detailed
relationship between consumption groups is shown
in Fig. 1. Post-hoc analysis (HSD test) showed sig-
nificant difference between group F0 and F3 (# p <
0.05). ANCOVA model indicated, that there was no

 Other data
Age, anthropometric data (BMI, WHR) and cholesterol
levels (LDL, HDL) did not correlate with T/S ratio.
The additional aim of this study was to determine the
influence of cigarette smoking on telomere length, but
there was no difference between active smokers and
non-smokers. In the group of smokers, daily and total
burden of cigarette smoking were not correlated with T/
S ratio and red meat consumption.
Physical activity, a necessary element of a healthy life-
style was not related to telomere status. Study conditions
exceed the possibilities of using more objective but time-
and cost-intensive methods for determining the level of
physical activity. Survey data allowed to divide partici-
pants into five groups of physical activity depending on
the frequency and time of physical activity:
None - total lack or medical contraindications for exercise
Low - till 30 min/week
Moderate - above 30 min/week, but less than 4x a week
Increased - above 30 min/week and at least 4x a week
Intensive - practicing an amateur sport with regular training
We found no differences among particular levels and
T/S ratio.
Four levels of education were identified among partici-
pants (Table 1). Participants were divided into two
groups – with and without higher education. PBMC
telomere length T/S ratio between these groups did not
differ significantly (p = 0.26) (Table 3).

 Discussion
This study established a relationship between the relative
length of telomeres in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and the frequency of eating red meat. This finding
differs from those published by Lee YJ et al. [21] on the
impact of dietary patterns on telomere length. This study
showed that diet rich with red meat can decrease leuco-
cyte telomere length 10 years after receiving diet data.
Our participants had had blood samples collected just
after filling out food frequency questionnaire. Hence we
analyzed the relationship without any time shift. Our
study population was a little younger (18–65 vs. 40–69
at baseline) and eating habits differ between Poland and
Korea. Similarly to Lee YJ et al., a relationship was ob-
served in colonocytes of patients who consume higher
amounts of red meat [22] but not in those who ate white
meat. As mentioned in the introduction, substances that
enter the body along with red meat (lipids, heme iron,
N-nitroso compounds) can damage the genetic material.
This process is well researched in cells directly related to
the digestion of red meat products, in terms particularly
of carcinogenesis [23–25] can damage the genetic mater-
ial. Cooking, frying and especially grilling generates sub-
stances with mutagenic activity: heterocyclic amines
(HCA), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), lipid
peroxides, wherein the amount is dependent on the
temperature of meat processing [26]. Increased con-
sumption of processed meat correlates positively with
the likelihood of breast cancer [27, 28] and negatively
with leucocyte telomere length [29]. Telomere sequences
may also be the site of DNA damage [15]. However,
some lipid peroxidation products can reduce the risk of
carcinogenesis [30]. Carnosine, a dipeptide found in red
meat may have a protective effect on telomeres [31].
There is also a published study indicating the negative
influence of diet devoid of meat on health status, espe-
cially increased incidence of cancer and mental health
disorders [32]. This finding can support the concept of
positive effects of red meat on health and is also consist-
ent with the results of our study. The positive relation-
ship between diet rich in red meat and the occurrence of
tumors of distant organs from the digestive tract may be
due to activity of red meat derivatives in the whole body.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells seem to be a good
material for the analysis of the impact of red meat deriv-
atives on the body. They are easy to isolate and count.
They circulate all over the body and are exposed to the
nutrient. Analysis of genetic material derived from these
cells allows detection of factors that can influence
changes in the genome of other tissues [33].
Our study on a small group of people managed to
demonstrate the relationship between the frequency of
consumption of red meat and telomere length. Although
no attempt was made to estimate the amount of food
products. Some studies indicate the risk of underesti-
mating the amount of food products when using the
food frequency questionnaires [34]. Micronutrients (e.g.
vitamins) can be related to telomere biology, although
there are large discrepancies in publications [35–39].
Our study included healthy subjects without symptoms
of vitamin deficiency and who were not taking vitamin
supplement. At baseline we did not measure micronu-
trient levels, assuming that there will not be any differ-
ences between physiological values in healthy subjects.
Age-related telomere shortening also occurs in PBMC,
but there is a large variation in individual - reduction,
stabilization and even increase in length [40] and it is
still not fully explained [41]. Intake of food rich in small-
to-medium-chain saturated fatty acids (SMSFA: milk,
butter, cheese) may be associated with PBMC telomere
length – inversely relative [42]. In our study we did not
find such a relation (dairy products p = 0.81). Small
amounts of SMSFA contained in the meat or used for its
preparation (e.g. frying with use of butter) can be one of
the TL-modifying factors mentioned above. Although
high levels of LDL and HDL concentrations are associ-
ated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, we
did not find any association between these parameters
and telomere length. Similar findings were noted in
other publications [43].
The study did not confirm negative effect of smoking
on telomere length. This finding is probably associated
with insufficient sample size. Statistical analysis also
excluded the effects of smoking as a covariate modifying
the TL among red meat consumers. The observation study
continues and we expect changes after its completion.
Physical activity of participants did not correlate with
telomere length. Two study participants with the highest
physical activity had longer telomere length than others,
but this difference could not be included in statistical
calculations. This may suggest that only intense physical
effort as opposed to mild or moderate may modify the
biology of telomeres [44, 45]. Body mass index (BMI)
can be associated with telomere length and there are
studies in large groups of people defining the rate of TL
change per BMI unit [46, 47]. We did not find any an-
thropometric associations – straight or reverse. Adjust-
ing data with BMI or WHR as continuous factors did
not significantly change red meat diet impact on PBMC
telomere length.
Many studies indicate the relationship between TL
and education level [48–50]. Less educated people are
on lower incomes, often consume poor-quality foods
(stale or processed) [51] containing harmful substances,
which damage the genetic material. Our participants did
not differ in TL among education levels, mentioned
studies were based on the analysis of large populations
where identifying weak dependence is easier and effect
Kasielski et al. Nutrition Journal  (2016) 15:68

 of covariates is smaller. Additionally - in contrast to our
study - tests were performed among groups of people
with similar age.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study findings are at the baseline of
further observations of TL changes in response to food
and behavior factors. Although we found a relatively
strong relationship, it should be treated as a guide for
further research on a larger group of people.
