Abstract
We have previously documented improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation with
a Bikram (hot) yoga intervention in middle-aged adults. At present, the effect of environmental
temperature in hot yoga on endothelial function is unknown. The purpose of this investigation
was to determine the effects of Bikram yoga interventions performed in heated or thermo-
neutral conditions on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Fifty-two sedentary but apparently
healthy adults aged 40–60 years were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Bikram yoga
practised at 40.5◦C (n = 19), Bikram yoga practised at 23◦C (n = 14) or sedentary time control
(n = 19). The yoga interventions consisted of 90 min Bikram yoga classes three times a week
for 12 weeks. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was measured non-invasively using brachial
artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). Body fat percentage determined via dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry was significantly lower in the hot yoga group after the intervention than in
the thermoneutral yoga and control conditions. Brachial artery FMD increased (P < 0.05) in
the thermoneutral yoga group and tended to increase in the hot yoga group (P = 0.056). No
changes occurred in the control group. There were no significant differences in FMD change
scores between groups. We conclude that Bikram yoga practised in thermoneutral conditions
improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in healthy, middle-aged adults. These new
findings highlight the effectiveness of hatha yoga postures alone, in the absence of a heated
practice environment, in improving vascular health and are of clinical significance given the
increased propensity for heat intolerance in ageing adults.

INTRODUCTION
Both preclinical studies and clinical trials indicate that endothelial
function plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis
(Chan et al., 2003; Landmesser, Hornig, & Drexler, 2004). Endothelium-
dependent vasodilatation declines with advancing age, contributing
to a higher susceptibility for the development and progression of
coronary artery disease among middle-aged and older adults (Seals,
Desouza, Donato, & Tanaka, 2008). Given these data, prevention
and therapeutic correction of endothelial dysfunction are of great
importance from the public health standpoint.
Bikram yoga is a highly standardized sequence of 26 hatha
yoga postures combined with two breathing exercises practised

worldwide. Also known as ‘hot yoga’, this style of yoga is practised
in 40.5◦C heat with 40–60% relative humidity. Research studies
investigating the health benefits associated with this practice have
been emerging in recent years. Improved endothelium-dependent
vasodilatation has been observed after 8 weeks of Bikram yoga
practice in apparently healthy, middle-aged adults (Hunter et al.,
2017). However, it is not clear which element of Bikram yoga
(strictly standardized hatha yoga postures and breathing exercises
or high heat and humid environment) augments endothelium-
dependent vasodilatation. In this context, we have previously
reported that beginners’ hatha yoga, which incorporated a non-
standardized posture sequence and shorter-duration classes practised
in thermoneutral conditions, did not improve endothelium-dependent

• What is the main finding and its importance?
The primary finding from this investigation is that the
hatha yoga postures in the Bikram yoga series produce
similar enhancements in endothelium-dependent vaso-
dilatation in healthy, middle-aged adults regardless of
environmental temperature. These findings highlight the
efficacy of yoga postures in producing improvements in
vascular health and downplay the necessity of the heated
practice environment in inducing vascular adaptations.

(Hunter,
Tarumi,
Dhindsa,
Nualnim,
&
Tanaka,
2013b).
The heated practice environment could play an additive role given
previous documentation of enhancements in endothelial function with
thermal therapy. Both sauna (Imamura et al., 2001) and hot water
immersion (Brunt, Howard, Francisco, Ely, & Minson, 2016) have been
shown to increase endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in healthy
and clinical populations. Accordingly, the main aim of this investigation
was to determine the effects of Bikram yoga practised in standard
heated and thermoneutral environmental conditions on endothelium-
dependent vasodilatation in healthy, middle-aged adults. Our working
hypothesis was that endothelium-dependent vasodilatation would be
improved with both yoga practices, with a greater increase in yoga
practised in the heated conditions.

METHODS
2.1
Ethical approval
The study protocol was approved by the University of Texas at
Austin Institutional Review Board (#2012-12-0043) in compliance
with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was registered
on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02488148). All participants signed
informed consent forms before any data collection.
2.2
Subjects
Eighty adults between the ages of 40 and 60 years were recruited
via flyers posted on campus and studio email correspondence from
October 2013 until January 2016. All subjects were sedentary
(<2 days per week of moderate physical activity) for a minimum
of 6 months before study participation. Upon prescreening via
questionnaire, exclusion from participation was based upon the
following criteria: (i) pregnancy; (ii) uncontrolled hypertension (blood
pressure >160/100 mmHg while on hypertensive medications); (iii)
infection within the previous 4 weeks; (iv) having adrenal or endocrine
tumours; (v) renal disease; (vi) prior myocardial infarction; (vii) known
coronary artery disease; (viii) personal history of stroke; (ix) heart
failure; (x) cardiac arrhythmias; (xi) chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease; (xii) personal history of psychosis; (xiii) recent chest pain or
dyspnoea; (xiv) orthopaedic limitations that would inhibit yoga posture
execution; (xv) heat intolerance; (xvi) having undergone a barium test
within the previous 2 weeks; and (xvii) having had a nuclear medicine
scan or injection with X-ray dye within the previous week.
Using randomization software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA), enrolled participants were randomly assigned to one of the
following three groups: Bikram yoga practised in standard conditions
(40.5◦C); Bikram yoga practised in thermoneutral conditions (23◦C);
or time control. Members of the research team were not blinded to
group assignment. However, this information was withheld from study
participants until after the completion of baseline testing. Control
group participants were instructed not to alter their current physical
activity patterns for the 12 week duration of the study. All study
participants were instructed not to alter their diet and other physical
activity throughout the intervention periods.
2.3
Yoga interventions
Both yoga interventions consisted of 12 weeks of 90 min classes
performed three times a week at local Bikram Yoga studios in Austin,
TX, USA. Classes were taught by certified instructors who had under-
gone a 10 week training course in the instruction and practice of
Bikram yoga using a standardized instruction script. The standard,
heated yoga group practised at a temperature of 40.5◦C, whereas the
thermoneutral yoga group practised at 23◦C. Class instructions and
the yoga postures and sequence were identical for both groups, and
classes consisted of the following postures: standing deep breathing
(pranayama), half-moon pose, awkward pose, eagle pose, standing
head to knee, standing bow, balancing stick, standing separate leg
stretching, triangle pose, standing separate leg head to knee pose, tree
pose, toe stand, dead body pose (savasana), wind removing pose, sit-
up, cobra, locust pose, full locust pose, bow pose, fixed firm pose, half
tortoise, camel, rabbit pose, head to knee and stretching pose, spine-
twisting pose, blowing in firm pose and dead body pose (savasana).
Each posture is practised twice, with the exception of spine-twisting
pose, and sit-up and dead body pose (savasana) are both practised in
between each posture after tree pose.
Class attendance was tracked by the studio upon sign-in and
checked weekly by the investigators. In an attempt to facilitate
recruitment, classes were offered to the study participants at a
discounted rate, and full reimbursement was provided in the form of
prepaid debit cards upon the completion of follow-up testing. Yoga
group participants were required to complete a minimum of 80% of the
classes. Subjects in the control group received debit cards for the same
amount as the other two groups along with the same discounted class
rate for 3 months upon the completion of follow-up testing.
2.4
Measurements
Study participants were instructed to fast for a minimum of 4 h, to
avoid ingesting caffeinated beverages and exercise for ≥12 h, and to

393
abstain from vitamin C, vitamin E and 𝛼-lipoic acid supplementation
at least 3 days before testing for both baseline and post-intervention
measures. Post-intervention measures were obtained within 2 h of the
time of the original (pre) measurement to avoid the influence of diurnal
variations. Premenopausal female subjects were tested during the
same menstrual cycle phase before and after the 12 week intervention.
Menstrual cycle phase was determined by tracking the dates of menses
for two consecutive months over the course of the 12 week inter-
vention. Follow-up testing was scheduled during the same menstrual
cycle phase approximated using the two dates of menses reported
by the participants. Additionally, all post-intervention testing was
conducted ≥24 h after the final yoga session to avoid any potential
lasting acute changes in vascular function.
Height and weight measures were obtained on the physician's
balance scale, and body composition was determined via dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a Lunar Dual Energy X-ray
Absorptiometry DPX (General Electric Medical Systems, Fairfield, CT,
USA). Blood samples were analysed for total, low-density lipoprotein-
and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose
concentrations using the Cholestech LDX Analyzer (Cholestech Corp.,
Hayward, CA, USA). Blood pressure was assessed while subjects
lay in the supine position in preparation for the vascular measures
after ≥5 min of rest. Measurements were obtained three times, and
averages are reported.
Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was measured
to
determine
endothelium-dependent
vasodilatation
(Eskurza,
Myerburgh, Kahn, & Seals, 2005; Harrison, Parkhurst, Tarumi, Lin, &
Tanaka, 2011). Longitudinal ultrasound images of the brachial artery
were attained 5–10 cm proximal to the antecubital fossa using a
Doppler ultrasound machine equipped with a high-resolution linear
array transducer (Philips iE33 Ultrasound System, Bothel, WA, USA).
A pneumatic arm cuff placed around the forearm was inflated to a
pressure of 100 mmHg above the subject's resting systolic blood
pressure for 5 min using a rapid cuff inflator (E20 Rapid Cuff Inflator;
D.E. Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA). At the end of the 5 min, the
cuff was rapidly deflated, and brachial artery images were captured
over the course of four 20 s frames. Brachial Analyzer Software
(Vascular Tools, Medical Imaging Application, Coralville, IA, USA)
was used to quantify changes in arterial diameter from baseline to
post-cuff occlusion. Flow-mediated dilatation was calculated as the
percentage change in arterial dimeter from averages of 10 baseline
diastolic diameters and three maximal systolic diameters post-cuff
occlusion. Test administrators and analysts were not blinded to group
assignment.
2.5
Statistical analyses
Data normality was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and all
data were analysed using SPSS Statistics Software, Version 24 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Post-intervention FMD in the hot yoga group
and pre- and post-intervention FMD means in the control group did
not meet the criteria for a normal distribution. Repeated-measures
ANOVAs were used to analyse within-group changes in FMD and,
in addition, Wilcoxon signed rank tests were also used to compare
pre- and post-intervention FMD means in the hot yoga and control
groups. ANCOVAs were used to compare post-intervention means
between groups, entering baseline variables as covariates for all other
variables. To determine whether the magnitude of change in FMD
differed between hot and thermoneutral yoga groups, change scores
were analysed via one-way ANOVA with post hoc analyses. Statistical
significance was set a priori at the P < 0.05 level.

RESULTS
Of the 80 participants initially enrolled, 52 completed the inter-
ventions and returned for follow-up testing. The final numbers were
19 in the hot yoga group, 14 in the thermoneutral yoga group, and
19 in the time control group. Dropouts were primarily attributable to
personal reasons (e.g. time commitment). One subject was excluded
owing to a substantial dietary change (conversion to a vegan diet)
during the intervention. One subject reported pulling a hamstring
muscle during half-moon pose, but no other injuries were reported.
The ethnic and racial composition of the final study participants was
as follows: Hispanic (n = 9), non-Hispanic (n = 43), Caucasian (n = 43),
African-American (n = 4), Asian (n = 3), Native American (n = 1) and
other (n = 1). Owing to the menstrual cycle irregularities, menstrual
cycle phase was not tightly controlled in four subjects (two in the hot
and thermoneutral yoga groups each). The exclusion of these subjects
did not change the major outcome.
Selected subject characteristics are shown in Table 1. Two
participants in the thermoneutral yoga group were on statin
medications, and six participants from the total were currently
taking hormone replacement therapy at the time of the study. All
medication dosages remained constant throughout the 12 week
intervention. A significant effect of group was found (P = 0.001) for
post-intervention body fat percentage, with pairwise comparisons
revealing significantly lower body fat percentage in the hot yoga group
versus control (P < 0.001) and thermoneutral conditions (P < 0.01)
after the intervention. No other main effects were found for other
outcome variables.
Brachial artery FMD results are displayed in Figure 1. Repeated-
measures ANOVA revealed significant increases in brachial artery
FMD in the hot and thermoneutral yoga groups (P < 0.05 for both). The
Wilcoxin signed rank test demonstrated a trend towards an increase
in FMD in the hot yoga group (P = 0.056) and no change in the control
group (P = 0.865). Additionally, no significant differences were found
in change scores between the two yoga groups.

DISCUSSION
The seminal finding from this investigation was that Bikram yoga
practised in a thermoneutral environment produced significant
improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in middle-
aged adults and that a 12 week hot yoga practice tended to improve
this measure. These results indicate that the set sequence of 26

Changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in the time control, hot yoga and thermoneutral yoga intervention groups.
Brachial artery FMD increased significantly in the thermoneutral yoga group and tended to increase in the hot yoga group, with no changes
occurring in the control subjects. Data are presented as means ± SD
postures and two breathing exercises may be the key ingredient in
producing favourable changes in endothelial function with yoga.
To our knowledge, this is the first interventional study that has
attempted to isolate the effects of the heated practice environment
in Bikram yoga on vascular health. Our hypothesis was that yoga
practised in a hot and humid environment would provide a greater
stimulus for vascular adaptation, based on previous studies showing
that thermal therapy alone produced an upregulation of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase in an animal model (Akasaki et al., 2006) and
an increase in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in patients with
coronary heart disease risk factors (Imamura et al., 2001). Our findings
of no additional effects of the heated environment on the vasculature
highlight the efficacy of the yoga postures alone in producing vascular
adaptations.
Results from our laboratory have previously documented acute
increases in stroke volume and cardiac output during Bikram yoga
 HUNTER ET AL.
395
postures (Miles et al., 2013). These acute increases in blood flow
during the postures may have induced a shear-stress-mediated
upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, a mechanism
previously documented (Seals, Jablonski, & Donato, 2011) that leads
to improvements in endothelial function. Although some inherent
variation exists, the two predominant components of yoga postures
are stretching and isometric muscular contractions, both of which
have been associated with enhancements in endothelium-dependent
vasodilatation (Badrov et al., 2013; Badrov, Freeman, Zokvic, Millar,
& McGowan, 2016; Shinno et al., 2017). In addition to the savasana
after ‘tree pose’, each of the postures in Bikram yoga beginning with
‘wind removing pose’ is followed by 20 s of savasana or lying supine
with arms close to the body, palms up and heels together (mimicking
the anatomical position). When considered postures, these savasanas
can also be thought of as bouts of supine recovery facilitating systemic,
shear-stress-mediated vascular adaptations by maintaining higher
stroke volume and cardiac output in between the postures. Indeed,
supine postexercise recovery has been associated with sustained
elevations in stroke volume and cardiac output when compared with
recovery in the seated position (Raine, Cable, George, & Campbell,
2001).
We have previously reported that hatha yoga performed in thermo-
neutral conditions did not improve endothelium-dependent vaso-
dilatation (Hunter et al., 2013b). In the present study, we demonstrated
that Bikram yoga performed in the thermoneutral condition was
effective in enhancing endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. These
contrasting results could be ascribed to different volumes of yoga
provided in these studies. Our previous hatha yoga study (Hunter
et al., 2013b) used a frequency of two classes per week, whereas
participantsinthe presentstudyperformed yoga three timesper week.
Additionally, the 75 min yoga classes in our prior thermoneutral yoga
study largely consisted of introductory floor postures, with some back
bends and sun salutations. Approximately half of the 90 min class
time in Bikram yoga in the present study was spent in standing post-
ures, many of which require proficiency at balancing on one leg before
the full expression of the posture can be executed. This results in the
sustained activation of the lower body muscle groups and is likely to be
more taxing than the postures in the previous intervention.
Body fat percentage was lower after the intervention than in the
thermoneutral and control conditions. This finding is in contrast to
our previous study, which showed no change in body fat percentage
with 8 weeks of Bikram yoga and suggests that a longer intervention
could be required in order to see significant changes in this measure
in middle-aged adults (Hunter et al., 2013a). A higher rate of energy
expenditure during exercise in the heat compared with thermoneutral
conditions could account for this divergence, although no significant
weight loss occurred. It should, however, be noted that the magnitude
of change was relatively small and might not have significant physio-
logical impact.
The present investigation is not without limitations. First, no
additional measures providing physiological mechanisms underlying
the changes in FMD were included. This investigation was an initial
step in isolating the potential additive effects of the heated practice
environment in Bikram yoga. Future studies should incorporate
measures providing mechanistic insight into the relationship between
yoga and vascular function. Second, subjects were required to fast for
only 4 h before the measurements. A longer fasting period was not
recommended because all sessions were conducted in the afternoons.
Owing to the previously recommended 6 h minimal fasting duration
(Thijssen et al., 2011), we do recognize that this could have introduced
a degree of confounding of our primary outcomes. Third, the shear
stress stimulus was not reported, and FMD was not normalized to
shear rate. Future studies investigating the relationship between yoga
and FMD should incorporate this measure to improve our under-
standing of the changes in vascular function elicited by yoga.
4.1
Conclusions
We conclude that a 12 week, thermoneutral Bikram yoga inter-
vention increased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in pre-
viously sedentary, middle-aged adults. The addition of the heated
environment did not produce additional beneficial adaptations, as the
hot yoga intervention only tended to improve this measure. Changes
in body composition were observed with the heated practice. These
results lend further insight into the health benefits of Bikram yoga that
have previously been purported but had not been explored fully.
