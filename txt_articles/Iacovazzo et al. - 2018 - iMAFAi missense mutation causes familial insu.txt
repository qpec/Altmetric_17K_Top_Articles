The β-cell–enriched MAFA transcription factor plays a central role
in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion while also
demonstrating oncogenic transformation potential in vitro. No
disease-causing MAFA variants have been previously described.
We investigated a large pedigree with autosomal dominant in-
heritance of diabetes mellitus or insulinomatosis, an adult-onset
condition of recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by
multiple insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors of the pan-
creas. Using exome sequencing, we identified a missense MAFA
mutation (p.Ser64Phe, c.191C>T) segregating with both pheno-
types of insulinomatosis and diabetes. This mutation was also
found in a second unrelated family with the same clinical pheno-
type, while no germline or somatic MAFA mutations were iden-
tified in nine patients with sporadic insulinomatosis. In the two
families, insulinomatosis presented more frequently in females
(eight females/two males) and diabetes more often in males
(12 males/four females). Four patients from the index family, in-
cluding two homozygotes, had a history of congenital cataract
and/or glaucoma. The p.Ser64Phe mutation was found to impair
phosphorylation within the transactivation domain of MAFA and
profoundly increased MAFA protein stability under both high
and low glucose concentrations in β-cell lines. In addition, the
transactivation potential of p.Ser64Phe MAFA in β-cell lines was
enhanced compared with wild-type MAFA. In summary, the p.Ser64Phe
missense MAFA mutation leads to familial insulinomatosis or di-
abetes by impacting MAFA protein stability and transactivation
ability. The human phenotypes associated with the p.Ser64Phe
MAFA missense mutation reflect both the oncogenic capacity of
MAFA and its key role in islet β-cell activity.

T
he V-Maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene
homolog A (MAFA) basic leucine zipper-containing protein
is unique among the many distinct islet-enriched transcription
factors, as it plays a pivotal role in the regulation of insulin se-
cretion in vivo, while at the same time displaying oncogenic
transformation potential in vitro (1–3). MAFA belongs to the
family of large Maf transcription factors, also including MAFB,
MAF, and NRL. MAFA and MAFB are both expressed in islet
β-cells, but only MAFA is required for postnatal function of mu-
rine β-cells (4–6), acting as transactivator of insulin and several
genes involved with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (1, 7–9).
The transformation potential of MAFA was shown by its ability
to induce proliferation of quail neuroretina cells (2) and chicken
embryo fibroblasts (3) when overexpressed in vitro. Notably, the
MAF gene is up-regulated in 50% of human multiple myelomas
and 60% of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphomas (10, 11). In
addition, recurrent translocations involving MAF, MAFB, and
MAFA are identified in 5–10% of multiple myelomas (12–14),
highlighting the significant role of these oncogenes in hematolog-
ical malignancies.
In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic etiology of
insulinomatosis, a condition characterized by the occurrence of
multicentric insulinomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
with β-cell–like features causing hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.
Insulinomatosis usually occurs sporadically (15), although it had
Significance
We report a disease-causing mutation in the β-cell–enriched
MAFA transcription factor. Strikingly, the missense p.Ser64Phe
MAFA mutation was associated with either of two distinct
phenotypes, multiple insulin-producing neuroendocrine tu-
mors of the pancreas—a condition known as insulinomatosis—
or diabetes mellitus, recapitulating the physiological properties
of MAFA both as an oncogene and as a key islet β-cell tran-
scription factor. The implication of MAFA in these human phe-
notypes will provide insights into how this transcription factor
regulates human β-cell activity as well as into the mechanisms of
Maf-induced tumorigenesis.

 also been described to occur in a familial setting in one single
kindred where hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was paradoxically
associated with a strong family history of diabetes mellitus (16).
Due to the multicentric nature of the disease, patients with
insulinomatosis have a significantly higher chance of persistent
or recurrent disease following conservative surgery compared
with patients with a single sporadic insulinoma, and their man-
agement is often challenging (15). By sequencing the exomes of
multiple affected individuals from a large autosomal dominant
pedigree with insulinomatosis and diabetes, we identified a
missense p.Ser64Phe (c.191C>T) mutation in the MAFA gene
segregating with both phenotypes. Targeted sequencing in a
second independent family with an identical clinical phenotype
revealed the same MAFA mutation, while no pathogenic variants
were found in a series of patients with insulinomatosis with
sporadic clinical presentation. Functional analysis demonstrated
that the p.Ser64Phe mutation not only significantly increased the
stability of MAFA, whose levels were unaffected by variable
glucose concentrations in β-cell lines, but also enhanced its
transactivation activity.
Results
Exome and Targeted Sequencing Identify the p.Ser64Phe MAFA
Mutation. The study population consisted of an index family
with autosomal dominant insulinomatosis and diabetes (family 1;
Fig. 1A; 29 subjects, 17 females), a second family with the same
phenotype, whose case was previously clinically described (16)
(family 2; Fig. 1B; 7 subjects, 2 females), and nine cases of
sporadic insulinomatosis (8 females). All subjects were of white
Caucasian ethnic background.
Exome sequencing of subjects III/1, III/2, III/8, and IV/4 from
family 1 identified 59, 85, 80, and 84 previously not reported het-
erozygous variants, respectively, annotated as missense, nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site variants. Only one of these, MAFA p.
Ser64Phe (c.191C>T; NM_201589.3), was shared by all four af-
fected individuals (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2). This variant
affects a highly conserved amino acid within the transactivation
domain of MAFA, and has not been reported before (ExAC,
GnomAD, ESP, dbSNP, and 1,000 Genomes databases). In silico
prediction supported a pathogenic role (SI Appendix, Table S3).
Testing for this MAFA missense variant in 25 additional members
from family 1 identified 14 further heterozygous individuals (18 in
total) and two homozygotes (IV/2 and IV/5). Nine unaffected
family members did not inherit the variant (Fig. 1A). Seven of the
18 heterozygotes had insulinomatosis, 10 had diabetes, and one was
clinically unaffected (IV/3, age 35). No DNA was available from
patient III/10, who was an obligate carrier of the MAFA variant
(Fig. 1A) and known to have impaired fasting glucose.
Targeted sequencing of MAFA in family 2 identified the same
heterozygous p.Ser64Phe MAFA mutation in the proband (III/1,
with insulinomatosis) and in four additional family members, one
currently affected with insulinomatosis (III/3), one with diabetes
(IV/1), and two who were not known to be affected (IV/2, age
47 and IV/3, age 41). The three deceased affected subjects in
family 2—two with diabetes (II/2 and III/5) and one with insu-
linomatosis (II/1)—were obligate carriers (Fig. 1B). Disease
penetrance for both phenotypes (insulinomatosis or diabetes)
was 90%. Haplotype analysis within the two families suggested
that the mutations had arisen on separate alleles (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1), although a recombination event within a 364-kb region
encompassing MAFA could not be excluded. DNA sequence
analysis of the nine sporadic insulinomatosis cases did not detect
germline or somatic MAFA pathogenic variants.
Individuals with the p.Ser64Phe MAFA Mutation Develop Either
Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia or Diabetes Mellitus. In the two
families we report, 10 subjects had hyperinsulinemic hypoglyce-
mia secondary to insulinomatosis (SI Appendix, Table S4), while
15 patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (SI Appendix,
Table S5). Most subjects with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
were females (male-to-female patient ratio was 1:4), and the
mean age at diagnosis was 39.4 ± 13.1 y. There was no history of
early-onset hypoglycemia suggestive of congenital hyperinsulin-
ism. In four of the six patients that underwent imaging investi-
gations, multicentric pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (ranging
in size between 0.4 and 1.1 cm) were shown, while local or distant
metastases were not observed. In 1 patient with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia from family 2 (III/1) who was diagnosed before
cross-sectional imaging investigations became available, a 5-mm
insulinoma was found in the resected sample following pancre-
atic surgery (16). Overall, 6 patients underwent surgery, with
persistent or recurrent disease in all cases, and 4 patients un-
derwent more than one operation. The subjects with persistent
or recurrent disease, and those who did not undergo pancreatic
surgery, were managed with medical treatment with generally
poor results and recurrent symptomatic hypoglycemia.
Most patients diagnosed with diabetes or impaired fasting glu-
cose were males (male-to-female ratio was 3:1), and the mean age
at diagnosis was 38.4 ± 16.5 y. The mean body mass index (BMI) of
patients with diabetes with available data was 25 ± 3 kg/m2. There
were no other clinical features of insulin resistance, no history of
diabetic ketoacidosis, and islet autoantibodies were negative, con-
figuring a phenotype resembling maturity-onset diabetes of the
Fig. 1.

 young (MODY) (17). Diabetes was managed with diet or oral
medications (i.e., metformin and/or sulphonylureas) in most cases,
with current HbA1c levels ranging between 37 and 74 mmol/mol
(5.5–8.9%). There was no history of clinically significant micro- or
macrovascular complications. Among the subjects with diabetes,
two homozygous patients from family 1 born to consanguineous
parents presented with congenital glaucoma (IV/2) and congenital
cataract (IV/5), while two heterozygous subjects (III/16 and III/20)
from the same family had congenital cataract associated, in one of
these (III/16), with congenital glaucoma. There was no history of
congenital eye disorders in family 2.
Insulinomatosis and diabetes seemed to be mutually exclusive
diagnoses in most patients. However, one subject from family 2
(III/3) might have developed the two phenotypes in a sequential
manner. This subject was diagnosed with gestational diabetes at
the age of 27. After giving birth, she had impaired glucose tol-
erance and was treated with sulphonylureas between ages 33 and
35. An oral glucose tolerance test while off treatment at the age
of 39 y was reported normal. This patient started to show
symptoms of hypoglycemia at the age of 55, and was later
diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and multiple
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors on 18F-DOPA PET imaging
(Fig. 2 A and B).
The three unaffected heterozygotes had normal HbA1c and
fasting glucose levels in the absence of clinical symptoms of hy-
poglycemia. Subject IV/2 (family 2) was prospectively diagnosed
with impaired glucose tolerance following an oral glucose tolerance
test (oGTT) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The insulinogenic index cal-
culated for this patient on the basis of baseline and 30-min glucose
and insulin levels was 37.6 pmol/mmol, with a normal homeostatic
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) of 1.7, in
keeping with impaired insulin secretion. An oGTT in one of the
unaffected heterozygotes from family 1 (IV/3) showed normal
glucose tolerance, with 120-min glucose levels of 5.4 mmol/L.
Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia in Patients with the p.Ser64Phe MAFA
Mutation is Due to Multiple Insulinomas. In the subjects with hyper-
insulinemic hypoglycemia that underwent surgery, histopathology
showed the presence of small (microadenomas, <5 mm) and larger
(macrotumors, >5 mm) multifocal well-differentiated neuroendo-
crine tumors (Ki-67 <2%) with a trabecular tissue architecture
(Fig. 2 C and D). The number of lesions was variable, depending
on the type of surgery and extension of sampling. Over 100 lesions
were identified in a patient from family 2 (III/1) whose surgical
specimen was fully sampled (15). Islets with β-cell hyperplasia
transforming into microadenomas were not observed. None of the
tumors exceeded 2 cm in size. All tumors expressed insulin, while
immunostaining for the other pancreatic hormones was negative.
MAFA immunostaining revealed a diffuse positivity in one case
from family 1 (III/19), which was less intense compared with the
neighboring normal islets (Fig. 2E), and a patchy positivity in the
index case from family 2 (III/1). Notwithstanding the limitations
due to the small number of tissue samples available for further
analysis, the MAFA staining intensity did not appear to be dif-
ferent in MAFA mutation-positive tumor cells compared with
MAFA mutation-negative sporadic insulinomatosis or sporadic
insulinomas (SI Appendix, Table S6).
The p.Ser64Phe MAFA Mutation Affects MAFA Protein Stability and
Transactivation Activity. Ser64 is found within the N-terminal
transactivation domain of MAFA (Fig. 3A). The neighboring
Ser65 residue was previously shown to act as a priming phos-
phorylation site, as phosphorylation at Ser65 enables glycogen
synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) to phosphorylate Ser61, Thr57, Thr53,
and Ser49 in a sequential manner (Fig. 3A) (18, 19). We found the
mobility of the p.Ser64Phe mutant protein to be indistinguishable
from the kinase priming defective mutant, p.Ser65Ala (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that the substitution of serine with a phenylalanine at
residue 64 prevents phosphorylation at the priming Ser65 site, and
the subsequent GSK3-mediated phosphorylation within the
transactivation domain of MAFA. However, both p.Ser65Ala
and p.Ser64Phe MAFA were still heavily phosphorylated pro-
teins at the many other phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3A), as shown
by the ability of an endogenous phosphatase(s) to alter protein
mobility when incubated in the presence of NaCl, but not the

 phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) (Fig.
3B) (20).
The p.Ser64Phe mutation was found to have a profound effect
on MAFA turnover. The stability of the mutant protein was
dramatically increased in both the human EndoC-βH1 β-cell line
(Fig. 4) and MIN6 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) in the presence of
cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Normally, MAFA is
highly unstable in β-cells at low, nonstimulating glucose con-
centrations, while its stability is enhanced in the presence of high
glucose concentrations (19). However, the p.Ser64Phe mutant
was stable and abundant regardless of glucose levels (Fig. 4 A
and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). No significant difference was
observed between transfected wild-type (WT) and mutant MAFA
mRNA levels (Fig. 4C), confirming the posttranscriptional na-
ture of the effect observed on protein turnover.
We next tested whether the p.Ser64Phe mutation affected
stimulation of an insulin enhancer/promoter-driven reporter.
There appeared to be no difference in the transactivation ca-
pacity in HeLa cells, as no predictable change in the specific
activity pattern was observed between constructs (SI Appendix,
Fig. S4). Notably, there was a nonlinear relationship in WT or
mutant construct activity in relation to increasing amounts of
protein, presumably due to the inability to properly phosphory-
late the protein at its many phosphorylation sites (21) under
these conditions. To focus on the impact of the p.Ser64Phe
mutation on transactivation activity, chimeric proteins containing
the N-terminal transactivation domain fused to the yeast Gal4
DNA-binding domain were produced. When analyzed in Gal4-
binding site-driven reporter assays, the Gal4-Ser64Phe MAFA
chimera was found to be more active than the WT chimera in
INS-1 β-cells compared with HeLa cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A).
Importantly, the chimeric WT and p.Ser64Phe mutant proteins
were expressed at equal levels (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B), as they
both lack the lysine residues targeted for ubiquitination in the
C-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization region (20). Collectively,
these results suggest that the activity of p.Ser64Phe MAFA
would be enhanced due to both increased transactivation ca-
pacity and increased protein stability.
Discussion
We report a disease-causing mutation in the β-cell–enriched
MAFA transcription factor. A p.Ser64Phe MAFA missense
mutation was identified in 25 individuals from two unrelated
families who were affected with either insulinomatosis or
noninsulin-dependent diabetes resembling MODY. Our results
are in keeping with previous evidence highlighting the role of
MAFA in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and at the same
time suggest that the p.Ser64Phe missense mutation can allow
the oncogenic potential of MAFA—previously described in
different cell contexts —to be manifested in the β-cell.
MAFA regulates the expression of insulin and several genes
involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (1, 7–9), and
serves as a glucose “barometer,” since its stability and activity
in β-cells are increased under high glucose-stimulating condi-
tions and repressed in the presence of low glucose (19). The
p.Ser64Phe mutation affects a highly conserved residue within
the N-terminal transactivation domain of MAFA, neighboring the
priming kinase Ser65 phosphorylation site. Significantly, no mis-
sense variants have been reported in publicly available databases
at any of the N-terminal residues in MAFA subjected to se-
quential phosphorylation (Ser49, Thr53, Thr57, Ser61, or Ser65)
or at immediately neighboring residues, including Ser64. The
identical mobility of the p.Ser64Phe and p.Ser65Ala mutants
strongly suggests that the p.Ser64Phe mutation impairs phos-
phorylation at Ser65, and the consequent GSK3-mediated phos-
phorylation within the transactivation domain of MAFA. These
phosphorylation events in the N-terminal transactivation domain
of MAFA induce both transactivation capacity (22) and protein
degradation (18–20), the latter resulting from ubiquitination in
the C-terminal domain. Consistently with the impaired phos-
phorylation within the transactivation domain, the p.Ser64Phe
MAFA protein was strikingly more stable compared with WT
MAFA, and its turnover was unaffected by different glucose
concentrations in β-cell lines. Moreover, the activity of the Gal4-
Ser64Phe chimeric protein was found to be greater than Gal4-WT
MAFA in INS-1 β-cells compared with non-β HeLa cells.

 Previous studies have shown that the transactivation activity of
the Gal4-Ser65Ala protein was reduced in non-β cells (20),
while the activity of chimeric proteins lacking the priming
phosphorylation and the GSK3 phosphorylation sites was found
to be enhanced in an insulinoma cell line (19). This suggests
that phosphorylation within the transactivation domain may
affect MAFA function in a cell context-dependent way, likely
through interactions with other β-cell–specific transcription
factors and/or coregulators. Together, our results suggest
that the p.Ser64Phe mutation increases the activity of endoge-
nous MAFA in β-cells by impacting both protein stability and
transactivation potential.
The family of Maf transcription factors derives its name from
v-maf, which is transduced as a viral oncogene capable of in-
ducing muscoloaponeurotic fibrosarcoma in chickens (23, 24).
MAF, MAFB, and MAFA all display oncogenic activity (25),
with MAFA having the greatest transformation potential in vitro
(3). Notably, only high copy number Maf expressing transgenic
mice develop T cell lymphomas (10), and the translocations
occurring in human multiple myelomas (12, 13) determine the
ectopic overexpression of large Maf proteins, suggesting that cell
transformation is dependent on the overexpression of these
transcription factors. Both the higher protein levels and the in-
creased activity of the p.Ser64Phe mutant are predicted to in-
duce the expression of genes involved with cell cycle regulation,
including CCND2, a known target of MAFA (6) and key regu-
lator of β-cell proliferation (26), presumably causing β-cell
transformation and occurrence of insulinomatosis. Our data also
suggest that the p.Ser64Phe mutation alters the tight regulation
of MAFA stability in response to changes in glucose concen-
tration. The lack of up-regulation of MAFA in response to hy-
perglycemia is expected to impair glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion, consistent with the results of the oGTT in one of the
prospectively identified mutation carriers, and this mechanism
presumably underlies the diabetes phenotype.
The mechanisms explaining how the same gene mutation can
lead to diabetes or insulinomatosis remains to be fully eluci-
dated, and in vivo models will have to be developed to further
investigate the effects of the p.Ser64Phe mutation. A similarly
paradoxical phenotype has been described for mutations in the
transcription factor HNF4A (27–29) and the potassium channel
gene ABCC8 (30), where diabetes can be preceded, in some
patients, by transient congenital hyperinsulinism. Insulinoma-
tosis is, however, a very different disease, as it only manifests in
adults, and is a neoplastic condition defined by the occurrence of
multicentric insulin-producing neuroendocrine tumors, as op-
posed to congenital hyperinsulinism, characterized by islet cell
hypertrophy in the absence of neoplastic changes (31). Although
we cannot exclude the possibility that patients with insulinoma-
tosis had diabetes before developing symptoms of hyper-
insulinemic hypoglycemia, in most cases the two phenotypes
seemed mutually exclusive, and interindividual factors might
determine the development of either insulinomatosis or di-
abetes. Interestingly, in our two families, patients with insulino-
matosis were mostly females and those with diabetes were more
frequently males. The reasons for this gender difference are not
known, although sporadic insulinomas also occur more fre-
quently in females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.4 (32).
Treatment with estrogens has been shown to promote pro-
liferation (33) and increase insulin release in human β-cells and
human insulinomas in vitro (34, 35). Moreover, the expansion of
β-cell mass observed during pregnancy is thought to be induced
by prolactin and placental lactogen signaling, mediated by the
prolactin receptor (PRLR) (36–38). Notably, Prlr was signifi-
cantly down-regulated in Mafa knockout islets and in MIN6
β-cells following siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mafa (39), and,
in the same study, the Prlr promoter was shown to be directly
activated by MAFA in luciferase reporter assays. Estrogens and
prolactin could potentially promote β-cell proliferation, predis-
posing female carriers of the p.Ser64Phe MAFA mutation to
develop insulinomatosis—remarkably all insulinomatosis female
patients manifested symptoms of the disease after puberty and
most of them displayed the first hypoglycemic symptoms either
during (16) or after pregnancy—although we cannot exclude the
possibility that additional factors might influence the develop-
ment of either phenotype.
Four subjects, including the only two homozygotes, presented
with congenital cataract and/or glaucoma. MAFA is expressed in
the developing lens (40), and mutations in the MAF gene have
been previously linked with congenital cataract and disorders of
the anterior segment (41), supporting a role for the p.Ser64Phe
MAFA mutation in the pathogenesis of the ocular phenotype.
Moreover, no MAFA mutations, either at the germline or so-
matic level, were detected in patients with insulinomatosis with
sporadic clinical presentation, implying that MAFA-independent
mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic
insulinomatosis. Similarly, no MAFA pathogenic variants were
previously identified in a series of patients with genetically un-
determined MODY (42), indicating that MAFA mutations are
specifically linked to the association of diabetes and familial
insulinomatosis.
In conclusion, we identified a MAFA missense mutation as the
cause of a dual familial condition of diabetes mellitus or hyper-
insulinemic hypoglycemia secondary to insulinomatosis. Our data
show that the p.Ser64Phe mutation impairs phosphorylation in the
transactivation domain of MAFA, leading to significantly enhanced
protein stability and activity in β-cell lines. The implication of a
MAFA mutation in human disease is expected to provide further
insights on the role of this transcription factor in the β-cell.
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples. We recruited two families with autosomal dominant insu-
linomatosis and diabetes mellitus (36 subjects, 19 females), and nine patients
with sporadic insulinomatosis (eight females; clinical features are summa-
rized in SI Appendix, Table S7). All patients and family members agreed to
take part in our multicenter study approved by the National Research Ethics
Service Committee East of England–Cambridge East by providing signed
informed consent.
Genetic Analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leuko-
cytes, saliva, or formalin-fixed archival tissue using commercially available kits
(further details are provided in SI Appendix). Exome sequencing was per-
formed in four individuals affected with insulinomatosis from family 1 (III/1,
III/2, III/8, and IV/4) using the SureSelect Human All Exon Kit (v5) (Agilent) with
sequencing on an HiSeq2500 system (Illumina). Sequencing metrics for the
four samples are reported in SI Appendix, Table S8. We assumed a rare au-
tosomal dominant model of inheritance to filter heterozygous variants (not
previously reported in the ExAC, ESP, dbSNP, and 1,000 Genomes databases)
annotated as missense, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site variants. The effect
of the identified MAFA missense variant was investigated in silico using SIFT
(sift.jcvi.org/), PolyPhen-2 (genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), and Align GVGD
(agvgd.hci.utah.edu/) prediction tools. Sanger sequencing was used for vali-
dation and cosegregation studies in family 1, and for the sequencing of the
whole coding sequence of MAFA in family 2 and in patients with sporadic
insulinomatosis. Primer sequences are provided in SI Appendix, Table S9.
Methods for haplotype analysis are reported in SI Appendix.
Pathological Assessment and MAFA Immunohistochemistry. Immunohisto-
chemistry on archival pancreatic tissue for neuroendocrine markers, Ki-67,
and pancreatic hormones (insulin, gastrin, glucagon, and pancreatic poly-
peptide) was performed as previously described (43). MAFA expression was
assessed using immunohistochemistry in two familial insulinomatosis sam-
ples, eight sporadic insulinomatosis, and six sporadic insulinoma controls and
classified as negative, weak, moderate, strong, or patchy. All cases were
reviewed by an experienced endocrine pathologist (G.K.). Further details are
reported in SI Appendix.
Protein Mobility Analysis. Details for plasmid preparation are reported in SI
Appendix. Nuclear extracts of WT, p.Ser64Phe, and p.Ser65Ala MAFA-trans-
fected HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C for 40 or 80 min in the presence of
sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4, 10 mM) or NaCl (10 mM). The samples were
analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with
an anti-MAFA antibody (A300-611A, Bethyl Laboratories).

GENETICS
 Luciferase Assays. The rat insulin II enhancer/promoter driven −238 firefly
luciferase plasmid (Promega) was transfected in HeLa cells along with
pCMV4-MAFA and phRL-TK (Promega) using the Lipofectamine protocol
(Life Technologies). Gal4-MAFA(1–167) was transfected in HeLa and INS-1
832/13 cells along with (Gal4)5E1bLuc and phRL-TK. Cellular extracts were
collected 48 h posttransfection, and the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer’s directions. MAFA
protein levels were normalized to endogenous β-actin by immunoblotting
with anti-MAFA (A300-611A, Bethyl Laboratories) and anti–β-actin (4967S, Cell
Signaling) antibodies.
Cycloheximide Chase Experiments. WT and p.Ser64Phe MAFA-Myc were in-
troduced into EndoC-βH1 cells (44) using the Amaxa Nucleofector 2 (program
G-016, Lonza). The medium was changed 48 h following nucleofection to
either 1.1 or 15.5 mM glucose for 12 h, and cycloheximide (Sigma) was then
added at a concentration of 25 μg/mL for the time indicated. Nuclear ex-
tracts were prepared for immunoblotting and probed with anti-Myc (clone
9E10, Roche) and anti–β-actin (4967S, Cell Signaling) antibodies. RNA from
EndoC-βH1 cells was collected 72 h postnucleofection using the TRIzol re-
agent (Life Technologies), and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was
used for cDNA synthesis. The qPCR reactions were performed with MAFA-
Myc, MAFA (endogenous), and GAPDH gene primers on a LightCycler 480 II
(Roche) and analyzed by the ΔΔCT method. Cycloheximide chase experiments
were also performed in MIN6 cells transfected with WT and p.Ser64Phe MAFA-Myc
using the Lipofectamine protocol. Each experiment was repeated at least
three times.
Statistical Analysis. Parametric data are presented as mean ± SD or SEM in the
figures. Normal distribution was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Ex-
perimental data (luciferase and qPCR experiments) were analyzed through
the Student’s t test using the software Prism v5 (GraphPad Software). Cy-
cloheximide chase experiments were analyzed using a one-phase decay
equation, and the degradation rate constant (k) was compared between the
mutant and the WT protein using the extra sum-of-squares F test. Signifi-
cance was set for P values < 0.05.
