Whether cognitive load—and other aspects of task difficulty—increases or decreases
distractibility is subject of much debate in contemporary psychology. One camp
argues that cognitive load usurps executive resources, which otherwise could be
used for attentional control, and therefore cognitive load increases distraction. The
other camp argues that cognitive load demands high levels of concentration (focal-
task engagement), which suppresses peripheral processing and therefore decreases
distraction. In this article, we employed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
protocol to explore whether higher cognitive load in a visually-presented task suppresses
task-irrelevant auditory processing in cortical and subcortical areas. The results show
that selectively attending to an auditory stimulus facilitates its neural processing in the
auditory cortex, and switching the locus-of-attention to the visual modality decreases the
neural response in the auditory cortex. When the cognitive load of the task presented
in the visual modality increases, the neural response to the auditory stimulus is further
suppressed, along with increased activity in networks related to effortful attention. Taken
together, the results suggest that higher cognitive load decreases peripheral processing
of task-irrelevant information—which decreases distractibility—as a side effect of the
increased activity in a focused-attention network.

INTRODUCTION
When people are mentally engaged in a challenging or entertaining task, they sometimes
fail to notice what is going on in the surrounding environment. Whilst driving alone on a
strait highway, for example, we easily pick up what is said on the radio in the background,
but as we cross the center of a large city in heavy traffic, and maneuvering becomes more
complex, we may even fail to notice our children calling from the back seat. Situations
such as this, when higher task difficulty makes us less likely to detect what is happening
in the background, are sometimes referred to as effects of concentration. Here, the concept
‘‘concentration’’ refers to the deliberate attempt to compensate for high task difficulty. As
people concentrate, they engage more into the task with the purpose to maintain a desirable
level of performance. One consequence of this task-engagement is that concentration reduces
peripheral processing and shields against distraction (Sörqvist and Marsh, 2015), which could be

Cognitive Load Reduces Distraction
why we sometimes fail to notice when someone calls out our own
name (Conway et al., 2001).
Our view of mental concentration is that it refers to the
ability to selectively attend to a target stimulus and ignore other
sources of information (selective attention), and it also refers
to the dynamic mechanism of task-engagement. For example,
a person at a cocktail party can selectively move the locus-of-
attention from talker to talker in the room (selective attention),
while either being fully engaged in the listening activity (as
when the talker says something interesting or challenging) or
not especially engaged (as when the talker is uninteresting). The
need for concentration is largely determined by the difficulty of
the current task, but task-engagement can also vary with other
factors such as motivation and expertise (Sörqvist and Marsh,
2015).
Task demands can vary as a function of perceptual load (i.e.,
the number of potentially relevant but ultimately irrelevant/non-
target sources of information in the current environment),
sensory load (i.e., the difficulty with which target information
can be perceived) and cognitive load (i.e., the burden posted
by the task requirements in relation to the cognitive system’s
capacity). For instance, when looking across a town center
searching for a specific person, the number of other people
present will determine the degree of perceptual load (Jenkins
et al., 2005); background noise masking a speech signal
determines sensory load in the listening task (Stenfelt and
Rönnberg, 2009); and the number of items that have to be
kept in mind when solving mental arithmetic determines the
task’s cognitive load (Klinger et al., 2011). The conceptual
distinction between these forms of load is not always clear
cut and their effects on selective attention are debated (Benoni
and Tsal, 2013). Although there are reports on the failure
to find effects of perceptual load—in the visual modality—on
auditory distractor processing (Murphy et al., 2013) and on
visual distractor processing (Yeshurun and Marciano, 2013),
the vast majority of evidence agrees that perceptual load
and sensory load decrease distractor processing (Lavie, 2010;
Hughes et al., 2013; Marsh et al., 2015). Furthermore, visual-
perceptual load suppresses not only processing of distractors
presented in the visual modality (Lavie et al., 2004; Jacoby
et al., 2012; Mevorach et al., 2014) but also processing of
distractors presented in the auditory modality (Macdonald and
Lavie, 2011; Halin et al., 2014a). Moreover, perceptual/sensory
load inhibits processing of both externally generated distractors
(Halin et al., 2014b)—such as background noise—and internally
generated distractors (Forster and Lavie, 2009)—such as task-
unrelated thought. Hence, when task difficulty is high—due to
perceptual or sensory load—the compensatory upward shift in
concentration shields against distractor processing (Linnell and
Caparos, 2013). The reasons for this could be that high task
difficulty locks the locus of attention to the target information
(whereby surprising, rare or unexpected information loses
its ability to capture attention) and suppresses the neural
processing of task-irrelevant information (Sörqvist and Marsh,
2015).
Whether high cognitive load also shields against distraction,
similar to perceptual/sensory load, is more debatable. One
source of evidence suggests that cognitive load increases
distractor processing (Lavie and De Fockert, 2005; Dalton
et al., 2009). On this view, working memory and executive
resources are needed to combat distraction, and when cognitive
load is high (e.g., when several items have to be maintained
in working memory), the necessary resources are usurped,
whereby susceptibility to distraction increases (Lavie, 2005).
Another source of evidence indicates that higher cognitive
load decreases distractor processing (Berti and Schröger, 2003;
Kim et al., 2005; SanMiguel et al., 2008; Halin et al.,
2015).
On
this
view,
cognitive
load—just
as
perceptual
and sensory load—increases task difficulty, which reduces
susceptibility to distraction, because of the increase in focal
task-engagement (i.e., concentration), emerging through the
compensatory processes needed to maintain a high level of
performance when task difficulty is high (Sörqvist and Marsh,
2015).
As in the context of behavioral data, there are some
neuroimaging studies which suggest that higher cognitive load
in the attended task (e.g., listening to a speech stream presented
in one ear) increases the neural activity in response to the ignored
stimuli (e.g., sound presented in the other ear; Sabri et al., 2014);
and, conversely, there are some neuroimaging studies which
suggest that higher task difficulty in the attended task suppresses
the cortical activity in response to distractors. For example,
increasing auditory working memory load decreases activity in
brain areas serving visual processing (Klemen et al., 2010) and
vice versa (Zhang et al., 2006; Regenbogen et al., 2012).
These inconsistent effects of cognitive load motivated an
empirical replication of the key results from previous studies on
the effects cognitive load on auditory processing (Sörqvist et al.,
2012). In the experiment reported here, we used an functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol to explore whether
cognitive load—as manipulated with a visual-verbal working
memory task—influences the cortical processing of background
sound. Participants were requested to view a sequence of visual
items and indicate whether the current item was the same as
the item presented n steps back in the sequence. n was 1 in the
low demand condition and 3 in the high demand condition. A
background sound was presented concurrently with the visual
items. Participants were told to ignore the sound, except in an
active listening condition without a visual task. We hypothesized
that active attention to the auditory stimulus would facilitate its
processing in auditory cortex, and when the locus of attention is
directed towards a visual stimulus instead, the neural response to
the auditory stimulus should be attenuated. The auditory cortex’
response to the auditory stimulus should be further suppressed
when the difficulty of the visual-verbal working memory task
increases. Moreover, the activity in frontoparietal areas and
areas involved in monitoring of saliency and effort (i.e., the
anterior cingulate and insula) should increase as task difficulty
increases (because the burden on working memory is higher;
Owen et al., 2005; see also Menon and Uddin, 2010), even though
the actual sensory input is kept constant when task difficulty
varies.
While the effects of cognitive load on a cortical level have
been extensively studied, effects of cognitive load on a subcortical

level are—to the best of our knowledge—less explored. The small
body of evidence indicates that similar suppression effects of high
cognitive load also arise at subcortical stages in the stimulus-
processing chain. Selectively attending a visual stimulus reduces
brainstem responses to task-irrelevant background sound (Ikeda,
2015). Attending the sound increases the amplitude of the
brainstem response; the brainstem response decreases when
attention is shifted from the auditory modality toward the visual
modality; and the brainstem response is further suppressed
when the cognitive load of the visual task increases—even when
the visual stimulus input remains the same (Sörqvist et al.,
2012).
Because of the theoretical interest in exploring how far
the effects of cognitive load reach, our intention here was
to expand the analysis of the effects of cognitive load to
include a classical and much researched subcortical area—the
amygdala (Pessoa et al., 2005; Diekhof et al., 2011; Okon-Singer
et al., 2014). The amygdala is known for its role in emotional
behavior and receives direct and indirect connections from
the posterior thalamus (Doron and Ledoux, 2000). However,
the amygdala is also interconnected with the sensory and
associative auditory cortices (Bzdok et al., 2013) and hence
is involved in sound processing; in particular in the analysis
of non-linguistic, environmental sounds (Strobel et al., 2015).
For example, hearing the sound of instruments used in dental
treatment—a sound that is associated with what many people
view as unpleasant—activates the amygdala along with the
prefrontal cortex (Yu et al., 2015). Moreover, cognitive load
appears to have an effect on amygdala responses (Kellermann
et al., 2012; see also Cohen et al., 2015, for pupillary responses).
The introduction of a cognitively demanding task can down-
regulate the brain’s responses to the negative stimuli in the
amygdala, at least when the cognitive task is introduced
after exposure to emotionally negative stimuli (Van Dillen
et al., 2009). It is unclear, however, whether high cognitive
load has corresponding suppression effects on the amygdala’s
responsiveness to a stimulus that is not emotionally loaded.
An adaptive cognitive system, designed to facilitate selective
attention, which deals with a cognitively demanding task might
downregulate the activity in amygdala as a preventive measure to
shield from the potential influence of emotional responses, even
when the environmental stimulus is not emotionally loaded. If
this is the case, higher cognitive load in a visual-verbal working
memory task might not only suppress the auditory cortex’
responses to a non-emotional task-irrelevant sound, but it might
also suppress the amygdala’s responsiveness to the background
sound.
To summarize, we were particularly interested in the
effects of visual-verbal cognitive load with respect to the
activity in the auditory cortex and the amygdala. For the
auditory cortex, we used the nomenclature established by
Morosan et al. (2001), which is considered more accurate
than the conventional notion of an auditory cortex (e.g.,
Morosan
et
al.,
2005).
This
categorization
divides
the
auditory cortex into three regions: Te1.0, Te1.1, and Te1.2.
In addition, we included the auditory parainsular cortex,
Brodmann area (BA) 22. BA2, which is located in the
lateral postcentral gyrus and is a prominent part of the
somatosensory cortex, was used as a reference, since we did
not expect to find effects of sound or effort in this sensory
region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A total of 32 students (18 females and 14 males, mean age = 24.97
years) were recruited from the Linköping University Campus
student pool. Inclusion criteria were right-handedness, normal
hearing, native Swedish language, no serious tinnitus, no known
neurological disease and no implants incompatible with MR-
scanning. The study protocol was approved by the regional
ethics review board (Dnr 2012/128). All participants gave written
consent to take part in the study and all procedures followed
standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.
Experimental Design
An experimental design with three conditions was used: one
condition without visual task but with active listening to a sound
sequence, one condition with a low demand visual task and
one condition with a high demand visual task. The sound was
also presented concurrently with the visual tasks, but here the
participants were requested to ignore the sound. In addition, a
silent/rest condition was used for baseline comparisons.
Materials and Tasks
Sound
The background sound played back to the participants comprised
a rapidly presented sequence of tones (for an easy way to
get an idea of what the tone sequence sounded like to the
participants, read ‘‘DRRRRRRRRRRRRR. . .’’ aloud). Two tone
bursts, presented binaurally, were used for stimulation, a 1.0
kHz stimulus (standard tone) and a 1.2 kHz stimulus (deviant
tone). The standard stimulus and the deviant stimulus consisted
of four cycles of the tone: one cycle rise, two cycles plateau, and
one cycle fall. The tone burst length was 4.0 ms for the 1.0 kHz
stimulus and 3.33 ms for the 1.2 kHz stimulus. The 1.0 kHz tone
was presented rapidly and repeatedly, with a presentation rate
of 39.9 stimulus/s. However, once every 2–9 s the standard tone
was replaced by the deviant tone. During these time windows,
the deviant tone was presented repeatedly and rapidly, with a
presentation rate of 39.9 stimulus/s, for a total of 1002.5 ms.
Thereafter, the standard tone was again presented until the next
deviant tone block occurred. The purpose of the deviant tone
blocks was to control that the participants properly followed the
task instructions when performing the active listening task.
Active Listening Task
In the active listening condition, participants were instructed to
focus on the sound sequence and to rest their eyes on a fixation
cross on the screen. To make sure that the participants were
indeed listening to the sound, they were requested to indicate
with their right hand’s index finger whenever the frequency of
the tones changed (i.e., increased from 1 to 1.2 kHz).

Visual Working Memory Task
In the visual working memory task, a sequence of letters (drawn
pseudo-randomly from the set: k, m, q, r, s, t, w) were presented
visually. Each letter was presented individually. Participants were
requested to press yes (using right hand’s index finger) or no
(using right hand’s middle finger) in response to each presented
letter, to indicate whether the presented letter was a target (i.e.,
the same letter as the letter n steps back in the sequence) or
not a target (i.e., a letter that did not meet the criterion). In the
low demand version of the task, n was 1. In the high demand
version, n was 3. The visual sequences also contained ‘‘lures’’
(i.e., items that would meet the criterion for being a target in
the other of the two task difficulty conditions but not in the
present task difficulty condition). The presentation order of
the letters was counterbalanced over the experiment and their
presentation was organized into nine 8-item-lists (each including
2 targets and 0 lures), 18 12-item-lists (each including 3 targets
and 1 lure), and 15 16-item lists (each including 4 targets and
2 lures). The total number of lists was 42 (528 trials in total),
half was presented in the 1-back condition and half in the 3-back
condition.
Task During Silence/Rest
In the silent/rest condition, no sound sequences were presented.
The participants were asked to rest, with their eyes fixating a cross
in the center of screen.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Scanner Data Collection and Analysis
Procedure
A sparse imaging design (Hall et al., 1999) was used, to exclude
measurement of scanner noise, where the activation measured
derives from stimuli presented in a silent period between
successive scans. The length of the stimuli presentation, the inter-
stimulus intervals and the number of stimuli for each TR was
setup to fit with time to scan one volume (2352 ms): presentation
of each stimulus for 2000 ms, a 352 ms inter-stimulus interval,
and four such events for each volume (TR = 9408 ms). The order
of the conditions followed a pseudo-randomized sequence where
1-back, 3-back and active listening were each followed by each
of the other conditions six times, and where silent/rest preceded
the other conditions eight or nine times and followed the other
conditions eight or nine times (Table 1). The duration of 1-back,
3-back and active listening differed between two, three or four TR
(Table 2), and the durations were distributed in such a manner
that a condition of a specific duration was never followed by a
condition of same duration (Table 3).
Stimulus Presentation, Data Collection and Analysis
The MR imaging was performed on a Philips Ingenia 3.0
Tesla scanner with a standard eight element head coil at the
Centre for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV) at
Linköping University, Sweden. T2∗-weighted functional images
were acquired using a Gradient echo EPI sequence, with in-plane
resolution of 3.0 × 3.0 mm; slice thickness of 3.0 mm with
enough slices (40) to cover the whole brain; echo time (TE) = 40

ms; number of image volumes per session = 237. The slices
were horizontal oblique. In addition to the functional data, a
whole-brain 3D T1-weighted anatomical image (voxel sized of
1 × 1 × 1 mm3, TR = 25 ms, TE = 4.6 ms, 175 sagittal slices) was
acquired for each participant at the start of the session.
All visual stimuli were projected to the participants on a
screen which participants viewed via a mirror. Auditory stimuli
were presented via NordicNeuroLab headphones (calibrated to
65 dB at 1 kHz). The presentation of the visual as well as
the auditory stimuli was controlled using E-prime 2.0 software
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
The statistical analysis comprised two steps. First, an
overall, whole brain analysis was conducted. This analysis was
supplemented by a Regions of Interest (ROI) analysis, involving
brain areas of particular interest in the present context. The
whole brain analysis employed FWE correction, ROI analyses
employed Bonferroni correction of omnibus analysis of variance
(ANOVA) results. Hence, for the three ROI conducted, a p-value
smaller than 0.01 was considered statistically significant.
All image analyses were performed using SPM8 software
(Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University
College, London, UK). Images were realigned, coregistered,
normalized and smoothed (10 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel)

following SPM8 standard pre-processing procedures. The
analyses were conducted by fitting a general linear model (GLM)
with regressors representing each of the four conditions, six
movement parameters (derived from the realignment procedure)
were included to control for movement during the session, and
three regressors were used to remove the mean signal from the
three runs. A high-pass filter with a cut-off of 128 s was modeled
to eliminate low-frequency signal confounds such as scanner
drift. These models were then fitted using a least-mean-squares
method to each individual’s data, and parameter estimates were
obtained.
Whole Brain Analysis
Contrasts
for
each
experimental
condition
([Condition > Baseline]) were defined individually for each
participant. The individual contrast estimates from the first
level analysis were then entered into a second level analysis
involving the following contrasts: Active listening > silence;
3-back > 1-back; 3-back > silence; 1-back > silence; active
listening < silence; 3-back < 1-back; 3-back < silence; and
1-back < silence. These four contrasts were analyzed by means
of four one-sample t-tests.
ROI Analysis
For the first four contrasts, ROI beta values were extracted by
means of the Marsbar software (Brett et al., 2002). Individual
ROIs were extracted with the SPM Anatomy Toolbox 2.0
probability atlas (Eickhoff et al., 2005; see this citation for
references to the individual areas). Auditory areas were: TE1.0,
TE 1.1, TE 1.2, and TI1. In addition, ROIs were extracted
for the Amygdala, and, for reference, BA2. BA2, which is
located in the lateral postcentral gyrus and is a prominent
part of the somatosensory cortex, was used as a reference,
since we did not expect to find effects of sound or effort
in this sensory region. Statistical analysis of contrast-related
beta values were undertaken by means of two-way or one-way
within groups ANOVA, using Greenhouse-Geisser correction
of degrees of freedom where the sphericity assumption was
violated.
RESULTS
Whole Brain Analysis
The results, corrected for familywise error rate (FWR) from
the four comparisons of primary interest for the purposes
of this study (active listening > silence; 3-back > 1-back;
3-back > silence; 1-back > silence), are presented in Table 4. The
contrasts are based on the second level whole-brain analysis.
The difference between the active listening and the silent
condition reflects the effects of sound. The difference between
the 3-back and the 1-back condition is the number of items
that have to be maintained in working memory to meet
the task requirements. The visual and auditory input is the
same, but cognitive load differs between the two conditions.
Hence, this contrast represents the effects of working memory.
The remaining contrasts—3-back vs. silence and 1-back vs.
silence—were used to construct the working memory contrast,
superimposed on sound.
The difference in neural activation between these two
conditions aligned with this assumption. Activation in a
frontoparietal
network,
typically
associated
with
working
memory involvement, was highest in the high cognitive load
condition (3-back) in comparison with the low cognitive load
condition (1-back). The 3-back > 1-back contrast resulted in
activation of a network typically involved in effortful attention
tasks, spanning the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate, the
inferior parietal cortex, and the anterior thalamus (Figure 1). The
remaining 3-back and 1-back contrasts represent combinations
of these results. Finally, active listening produced activation
across a wide network of areas in the temporal, insular, and
frontal cortices. The behavioral data for the n-back task
was lost due to technical errors. Therefore, behavioral data
cannot be used as a manipulation check, but the comparisons
reported in Table 4 confirm the success of the cognitive load
manipulation.
ROI Analysis: Effects of Cognitive Load on
Distractor Processing
We now turn to the test of the main hypothesis of the current
study; higher visual-verbal cognitive load should suppress
activation in areas serving auditory processing. Figure 2 presents
the results for the ROIs related to the auditory areas and Figure 3
depicts the amygdala ROI.
As can be seen in Figure 2, the neural activity of the primary
auditory cortex was more suppressed when the task-difficulty
of the visual task was high (3-back) in comparison with when
the task-difficulty was low, even though the sensory input is
the same in the two task difficulty conditions. As a control,
Figure 2 also displays the difference between active listening (no
n-back task) and 1-back, and suggests that the auditory cortex
was more responsive to the sound when the locus-of-attention
was set on the sound (active listening) in comparison with
when it was set on visual stimuli (1-back). A repeated measures
4 × 4 (Comparison by Auditory Areas) analysis of variance
disclosed a two-way interaction, F(3.81,118.32) = 5.44, p < 0.01,
in addition to statistically significant main effects: Comparison
F(1.97,61.09) = 50.72 p < 0.01; Auditory Areas F(2.45,75.89) = 24.04,
p < 0.01. Of particular importance to the purpose of this
study, Scheffé post hoc test disclosed statistically significant
differences between all auditory areas when the sound (active
listening vs. silence) contrast was compared to the working
memory (3-back vs. 1-back) contrast (all p’s < 0.01). The 3-back
vs. sound contrast mimicked the working memory contrast
whereas the 1-back vs. sound depicted an attenuated sound
contrast.
Figure 2 also displays, for reference purposes, how the
primary somatosensory area (BA 2) does not respond to
the experimental manipulations the same way as the primary
auditory cortex does (this region, BA2, was not included in
the ANOVA). For BA2, the effect of Contrast was statistically
significant: F(2.19,67.93) = 11.02, p < 0.01. Scheffé post hoc
comparisons revealed that the 3-back vs. Silence and 1-back vs.

Silence comparisons were different from the Active listening
vs. Silence comparison and the 3-back vs. 1-back comparisons
(p < 0.05). While active listening and cognitive load failed to
produce signal changes in BA2, the added cognitive load of
sensory feedback related to motor responding yielded a slight
activation in BA2. Hence, the effects of the cognitive load
manipulation are selective.

Cognitive Load Reduces Distraction

suggest that the cognitive system protects goal-directed behavior
by shielding itself from both exogenous and endogenous sources
of distraction.
DISCUSSION
The results show that the selective attention toward an auditory
stimulus facilitates neural processing in the auditory cortex,
consistent with the assumption that the neural activity in
areas serving target processing is ‘‘boosted’’ when the target
is selectively attended (Gazzaley et al., 2005). When attention
is instead localized to a visual input, the neural response in
the auditory cortex is lower than when the auditory input is
actively attended. This is consistent with the idea of a cross-
modal suppression of the neural activity responding to the
distractor modality (Weissman et al., 2004). Moreover, when
cognitive load of the visual-verbal working memory task is
higher, the neural response to the auditory stimulus is further
suppressed, even though the visual input is the same as when
cognitive load is lower. Finally, the results also suggest that
amygdala activity decreases when cognitive load escalates. Taken
together, the results suggest that higher cognitive load shields
against distraction, as a side-effect of the recruitment of a
network typically associated with effortful attention and working
memory processing (middle frontal gyrus, the anterior insula, the
cingulate, and the inferior parietal cortex).
The results reported here expand on a previous study on
the effects of cognitive load on brainstem activity (Sörqvist
et al., 2012) by showing that higher cognitive load in a
FIGURE 2 | The figure shows the auditory cortex’s activation in various
conditions. The activity is greater when attention is directed toward the
sound (active listening) in comparison with when it is directed away from the
sound toward a visual task (1-back). When the difficulty of the visual task
increases (3-back), the neural activity of the auditory cortex is further
suppressed. As the n-back task involves sub-vocal rehearsal, and to preserve
statistical power, the left hemisphere only is shown, but the result pattern was
the same for right hemisphere. Error bars represent standard error of means.
Activation (red) and deactivation (green) is rendered on the left hemisphere for
the active listening vs. silence contrast and the 3-back vs. 1-back contrast.
The contrasts displayed in the Figure resulted from four one-sample t-tests,
testing for the effect of sound (active listening vs. silence, T = 5.39, FWE
corrected p < 0.05, k = 0), working memory load (3-back > 1-back,
T = 5.31, FWE corrected p < 0.05, k = 0), 3-back vs. silence (T = 5.30, FWE
corrected p < 0.05, k = 0), and 1-back vs. silence (T = 5.40, FWE corrected
p < 0.05, k = 0). The coordinates for the contrasts are shown in Table 4.
visually-presented task suppresses task-irrelevant processing at
the cortical level (auditory cortex) as well as at the sub-cortical
level (amygdala). As such, the results speak to the debate about
the effects of cognitive load on distractor processing. One group
of researchers argues that cognitive load increases undesired
responsiveness to distractors in the periphery (e.g., Lavie et al.,
2004; Lavie and De Fockert, 2005; Dalton et al., 2009; Sabri et al.,
2014); while another group of researchers argues that cognitive
load decreases distractor processing (e.g., Kim et al., 2005;
SanMiguel et al., 2008; Sörqvist and Marsh, 2015). Although
the current experiment cannot resolve these inconsistencies, the
experiment reported here supports the view that cognitive load
decreases distractibility.
One possibility is that cognitive load has different effects
depending on whether the to-be-attended and the to-be-ignored
stimuli are presented in the same modality or in different
modalities. Evidence in favor of the view that cognitive load
decreases distractor processing, comes from studies wherein
target and distractor information are presented in different
modalities (the current study, and extant research; Kim et al.,
2005; SanMiguel et al., 2008; Regenbogen et al., 2012; Sörqvist
et al., 2012; Halin et al., 2015). When target and distractors
are presented in different modalities, the stimulus-competition
is low (i.e., the cognitive system can easily distinguish target
from non-target stimuli). This could facilitate the suppression of

Cognitive Load Reduces Distraction
FIGURE 3 | The figure shows the amygdala’s activation in various
conditions. The left hemisphere only is shown for simplicity, but the result
pattern was the same for right hemisphere. The suppression of amygdala is
greater when the cognitive load of the visual-verbal working memory task is
high in comparison with when load is low. Error bars represent standard error
of means. The inserts shows results (bars indicate means of parameter
estimates (±SEM, arbitrary units) at the level of the amygdala (crossmark).
Activation is depicted in red and deactivation is depicted in blue for the active
listening vs. silence contrast and the 3-back vs. 1-back contrast. As can be
noted, there is no discernable activation in the active listening vs. silence
contrast. The contrasts displayed in the Figure resulted from four one-sample
t-tests, testing for the effect of sound (active listening vs. silence, T = 5.39,
FWE corrected p < 0.05, k = 0), working memory load (3-back > 1-back,
T = 5.31, FWE corrected p < 0.05, k = 0), 3-back vs. silence (T = 5.30, FWE
corrected p < 0.05, k = 0) and 1-back vs. silence (T = 5.40, FWE corrected
p < 0.05, k = 0). The coordinates for the contrasts are shown in Table 4.
distractor processing, because the distractor modality is clearly
distinguishable from the target modality (cf., Schwartz et al.,
2005).
Conversely, evidence in favor of the view that cognitive
load increases distractor processing comes from studies wherein
target and distractor information are presented in the same
modality. In this case, higher cognitive load increases the neural
responses toward the distractors (Sabri et al., 2014). The reason
for this could be that the system is insufficiently fine-tuned to
hit the distractor processing neurons with suppression (cf., Parks
et al., 2013).
It should also be noted that the timing between distractor
presentation and target presentation modulates the magnitude
of distraction. For example, when a sequence of words is
presented visually, and the participants’ task is to recall the
words, recall is more impaired by auditory distractor-words
when the distractor words are presented simultaneously with
the visual words, in comparison with when the distractor
words are sandwiched in-between the visual words (Marsh
et al., 2015). In the current study, the visual task and the
auditory distractors were presented simultaneously. It is unclear
whether cognitive load would have the same effect on distractor
processing if the presentation of the task-materials and the
presentation of the distractor materials are chronologically
separated.
The similarity between the targets and the distractors can
also play a role (Kim et al., 2005; Park et al., 2007). In the
current study, the items in working memory (letters) and the
distractors (tone sequences) were unrelated, and did, arguably,
not share features. It is unclear whether cognitive load would
have had a different effect if the items in working memory and
the distractors would have shared features.
There is yet another crucial difference between the studies
in favor of the view that cognitive load increases distraction
and those in favor of the view that cognitive load decreases
distraction. Studies showing that cognitive load decreases
distraction, have studied the effects of cognitive load when
the participants are performing a single task. Here, distractor
processing is not evaluated by its effect on a secondary task.
Instead, distractor processing has been measured by task-
unrelated neural responses (the current study; SanMiguel et al.,
2008; Sörqvist et al., 2012), by long-term memory of what has
been presented in the to-be-ignored channel (Halin et al., 2015),
or by the behavioral effects of distractors on performance in the
task that is used to manipulate cognitive load (Kim et al., 2005).
Studies suggesting that cognitive load increases distractibility
have instead often used a dual-task setting (Lavie and De
Fockert, 2005; Dalton et al., 2009). Here, the participants perform
one task that is used to manipulate cognitive load, while
they also perform a concurrent task that is used to measure
distraction. For example, a working memory task can be used
to manipulate cognitive load by requesting the participants to
maintain either a small set or a large set of items in memory, and
a visual search task is performed during the working memory
retention interval. Distraction is operationalized as the effect
visual distractors have on response times in the visual search
task, not as the cost the distractors cause to the working memory
task.
Attentional engagement could be responsible for this
difference between single-task and dual-task studies. In a dual-
task study, executive resources must be spent on two sources of
task-relevant information. Therefore, the attentional engagement
is low in the task that is used to measure distractibility, especially
when the cognitive load is high in the task which is not used to
measure distractibility. And a consequence of this low attentional
engagement is greater susceptibility to distraction (Sörqvist and
Marsh, 2015). Conversely, in a single task study, the executive
resources can be fully focused upon a single source of task-
relevant information. Consequently, a high state of focal-task
engagement can be reached. And a consequence of this high
attentional engagement is lower susceptibility to distraction
(Sörqvist and Marsh, 2015), as seen in a suppression of the neural
processing of distractors (current study; SanMiguel et al., 2008 ;
Sörqvist et al., 2012) and other indices (Kim et al., 2005; Halin
et al., 2015).
The effects of the upward shift in concentration—in response
to a rise in task difficulty—are not limited to cortical areas
of the brain. They also expand to suppression of subcortical
areas such as the amygdala (Kellermann et al., 2012) and the
brainstem (Sörqvist et al., 2012). The amygdala is suppressed
when the cognitive system is challenged, perhaps because the
system inhibits emotional responses to protect the current goal-

Cognitive Load Reduces Distraction
directed behavior (Van Dillen et al., 2009; Okon-Singer et al.,
2013). The study reported here provides further evidence for
the view that higher cognitive load suppresses amygdala activity,
and the study shows that cognitive load does so even when the
distractor stimulus is non-emotional.
In conclusion, higher demands for concentration appear to
recruit a dynamic fronto-insular neural network and—perhaps
as a side effect—suppress peripheral processing at cortical
and subcortical areas. Therefore, higher cognitive load shields
against distraction, at least distraction to a task that can be
fully attended to. The ecological value of the suppression
effects of cognitive load would be to protect the cognitive
system when it is challenged by a demanding task, so that a
desired goal can be reached. This protection would arguably
require not only an act on current distractors (e.g., a present
background sound) but also potential future distractors (e.g.,
the possibility of emotionally alarming stimuli), which could
be why the suppression acts on both cortical and subcortical
levels.
