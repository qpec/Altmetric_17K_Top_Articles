Although neutrophils are known to be fundamental in controlling
innate immune responses, their role in regulating adaptive immunity
is just starting to be appreciated. We report that human neutrophils
exposed to pregnancy hormones progesterone and estriol promote
the establishment of maternal tolerance through the induction of a
population of CD4+ T cells displaying a GARP+CD127loFOXP3+ phe-
notype following antigen activation. Neutrophil-induced T (niT) cells
produce IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF and promote vessel growth in vitro.
Neutrophil depletion during murine pregnancy leads to abnormal
development of the fetal-maternal unit and reduced empbryo devel-
opment, with placental architecture displaying poor trophoblast in-
vasion and spiral artery development in the maternal decidua,
accompanied by significantly attenuated niT cell numbers in draining
lymph nodes. Using CD45 congenic cells, we show that induction of
niT cells and their regulatory function occurs via transfer of apopto-
tic neutrophil-derived proteins, including forkhead box protein 1
(FOXO1), to T cells. Unlike in women with healthy pregnancies, neu-
trophils from blood and placental samples of preeclamptic women
fail to induce niT cells as a direct consequence of their inability to
transfer FOXO1 to T cells. Finally, neutrophil-selective FOXO1 knock-
down leads to defective placentation and compromised embryo de-
velopment, similar to that resulting from neutrophil depletion. These
data define a nonredundant function of neutrophil–T cell interactions
in the regulation of vascularization at the maternal–fetal interface.

E
stablishment of immune tolerance at the fetal–maternal in-
terface has long been associated with the induction of mul-
tiple adaptive immunoregulatory mechanisms. For example, the
presence of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase can dampen maternal
T-cell responses to paternal alloantigens, leading to fetal protection
(1). Moreover, the programmed cell death ligand (PDL1) is crucial
for maternal tolerance in allogeneic pregnancies (2). Finally, the
presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is instrumental to the main-
tenance of maternal tolerance (3), where fetus-specific Tregs re-
main after pregnancy (4) and can expand in subsequent pregnancies
(5). Immune tolerance of the fetus relies on the concerted actions of
hormones and cytokines, as well as cross-talk between innate and
adaptive immune cells (6). Dysregulation of one or more of these
components can lead to complications of pregnancy, including fetal
growth restriction, preeclampsia, and recurrent miscarriages (7).
Neutrophils, classically considered short-lived cells, provide a
first line of defense during infection to help ensure tissue restitution
to physiology (8, 9). Emerging evidence indicates that neutrophils
also may regulate specific processes typical of adaptive immune re-
sponses (10), including antibody production from B cells (11), T-cell
suppression (12), and antigen presentation by dendritic cells (13).
The ability of neutrophils to affect adaptive immunity appears to be
dictated by their activation status (14). Recent studies have suggested
the presence of neutrophils in the human decidua that release pro-
angiogenic factors (15, 16); however, their direct influence on pre-
gnancy outcome has not been shown.
In the present study, we describe a role for neutrophils in
the establishment of adaptive tolerance during pregnancy. We
demonstrate that a population of neutrophils, generated by ex-
posure to pregnancy hormones, is able to induce a unique pop-
ulation of T cells that have regulatory-like and proangiogenic
phenotypes. These neutrophil-induced T (niT) cells are neces-
sary for normal placental vascularization and fetal growth during
allogeneic pregnancy.
Materials and Methods
Healthy Volunteer and Patient Samples. All volunteers provided informed
consent before participating in the study. For in vitro experiments, blood
was collected from healthy male volunteers (aged 21–35 y) between 10
and 11 AM. This collection was approved by the East London and
The City Local Research Ethics Committee (QMREC2014.61). For patient
samples, blood and placental samples from healthy and preeclamptic
women were collected at University College, under approval from the
London and South-East Research Ethics Committee (13/LO/0287). Patient
demographic information is provided in SI Appendix, Table S1. Both
healthy volunteer and patient blood samples were collected in 3.2%
sodium citrate.

Significance
Neutrophils are typically known as short-lived cells that act as
the first line of defense in response to pathogens. However,
emerging data indicate that neutrophils have wider implications
in the immune system and have a direct influence on the ensu-
ing immune response. Establishment of successful pregnancy
requires immune tolerance at the maternal–fetal interface. Ab-
errations in normal placental development can lead to compli-
cations, including preeclampsia. In this study, we examined a
role for maternal neutrophils in maintaining normal pregnancy
through their interactions with T cells, resulting in a population
of T cells that are both regulatory and proangiogenic and are
required for normal placental development. Such interactions
are absent in patients with preeclampsia, suggesting a potential
therapeutic target for pregnancy-related pathologies.

 BL/6 females. Following identification of a vaginal plug, circulating maternal
neutrophils were depleted at days 5 and 8 using a monoclonal neutralizing
antibody (Biolegend, clone IA8; 50 μg i.v.). Neutrophils were reconstituted at
indicated times during the pregnancy. Neutrophils were made from bone
marrow progenitors. Progenitors were isolated via negative selection (Stem
Cell Technology). Following an initial lentiviral transduction (24 h) to knock
down forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1), cells were washed and incubated in
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 100
ng/mL recombinant murine GCSF for 5 d. Female CD45.1 (Ly5.1) mice were
kindly provided by Andrew Cope, King’s College London. Mice were origi-
nally obtained from Charles River Italy. To check for congenic markers after
adoptive transfer of donor CD45.1 neutrophils, cells were stained with Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse CD45.1 (Biolegend; clone A20), along with
Alexa Fluor 450-conjugated CD45.2 (eBioscience; clone 104).
Imaging. Neutrophils and autologous T cells were cocultured as described
above in Nunc Lab-TekII Chamber Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After
coculture, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then blocked for 3 h with PBS
containing 0.1% fish skin gelatin and 1% FCS. Anti-human MRP8 (Abcam;
clone CF-145) at 4 °C overnight, followed by staining with secondary anti-
bodies mouse Alexa Fluor 555 and mouse Alexa Fluor 488 along with nuclear
stain DAPI (Life Technologies). Human cells were labeled with mouse anti-
human FOXO1/FKHR MAb (R&D Systems; clone 597554). Images were ac-
quired using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope
equipped with a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective.
Mouse placentas were embedded in paraffin, and cross-sectional sections
were made and imaged to identify all placental layers. Antigen retrieval was
carried out using sodium citrate buffer and staining for H&E. Some placental
sections were also stained for CD31 (AbD Serotec; clone ER-MP12), cyto-
keratin-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FITC-conjugated, clone RCK-105), and
DAPI (Life Technologies). H&E images were acquired on a Pannoramic 250
high-throughput scanner (3DHISTECH) at 43× magnification. Immunofluo-
rescence images were acquired on a Leica Ariol System at 20× magnification.
Image analysis was performed using ImageJ, and scale bars were added onto
the overlaid images.
Statistics. Data were analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA, followed by
Bonferroni’s post hoc test using GraphPad Prism 5. Alternatively, several ex-
periments were analyzed by Student’s t test. Data are presented as mean ± SEM,
and a P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Human Neutrophils Exposed to Pregnancy Hormones Induce T Cells
with a Regulatory-Like Phenotype and Proangiogeneic Activity. To
study a potential role for neutrophils in maternal tolerance, we
tested whether neutrophils exposed to pregnancy hormones
could affect T-cell responses. Neutrophils from healthy male
donors were used to minimize any effects from endogeneous
progesterone and estrogen. Male cells express the same levels of
estrogen and progesterone receptors on leukocytes as females
(17), and thus respond to both hormones. Neutrophils (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S1A) were incubated with either progesterone (P; SI
Appendix, Fig. S1B) or the placental estrogen estriol (E3), or
in combination (hereinafter E3P), at 100 ng/mL, physiological
pregnancy levels. Treatment of neutrophils for 30 min with E3P
led to a distinct CD16loCD62LloCD11bloAnxA1hi phenotype
(Fig. 1A), typical of an anti-inflammatory/quiescent neutro-
phil status (14, 18). The addition of E3P neutrophils to autol-
ogous carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled
T cells (+ anti-CD3, anti-CD28 mAbs), enhanced T-cell pro-
liferation (Fig. 1B). These T cells produced significant levels of
IL-10, IL-17, IL-2, and IL-5, but not of IFN-γ, compared with
T cells activated in the presence of vehicle-treated neutrophils
or on their own (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). Neutro-
phils cultured alone did produce cytokines, confirming their
purity and the absence of contaminating monocytes (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S1C).
Given the increased levels of regulatory cytokines detected in
E3P-treated neutrophil–T-cell cocultures, we defined their phe-
notypic and functional characteristics. A significant increase in the
proportion of total CD4+CD45RO+ T cells expressing high levels
of FOXP3 was quantified in the divided T-cell population, with
low levels of CD127 and high levels of the latency-associated
peptide receptor Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant (GARP)
(Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Figs. S1D and S2A). The induction of
Tregs by E3P-treated neutrophils relied on TCR stimulation,
given that neutrophils failed to induce FOXP3 expression in
unstimulated T cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). Coculture with
neutrophils led to equal expansion of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells
from the starting naïve T-cell population, regardless of neu-
trophil hormone treatment (Fig. 1E, Left); however, expression
levels of FOXP3 and GARP were induced in CD45RO+ T-cells
selectively when cocultured with E3P neutrophils (Fig. 1F,
Right), indicating that this pathway of differentiation occurs
during T-cell priming.

 Further analyses revealed that these neutrophil-induced T (niT)
cells coexpressed GARP and PD1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C), a
phenotype typical of functionally suppressive human TCR-activated
FOXP3+ Tregs (19). Suppression assays revealed that niT cells
were also functionally suppressive, which was cell contact-dependent
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and E). This finding suggested signaling
of neutrophils to T cells during activation, either by direct cell–
cell contact or through the release of large cell material (>0.4 μm).
The hormone effect on neutrophils was specific to E3P; treat-
ment of neutrophils with third trimester levels of estrone,
17-β-estradiol, or β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (in the
presence or absence of 100 ng/mL progesterone) did not in-
duce niT cells following coculture (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A).
Neutrophils from healthy female donors (regardless of stage of
menstrual cycle) induced niT cells even without stimulation
with E3P (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B and C), likely owing to
continued exposure to high levels of progesterone, given that
this hormone on its own was sufficient to induce niT cells (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1D).
Further analyses revealed that niT cells produce IL-10 and
IL-17 (Fig. 2A). IL-17–producing Tregs have been described
previously (20). IL-17 has been shown to have proangiogenic
functions by inducing the release of growth factors, including
VEGF (21). Supernatants from T cells cocultured with E3P
neutrophils also contained significant levels of VEGF. To con-
firm that the VEGF production in our system was induced by
IL-17, we used an anti–IL-17 neutralizing strategy, which im-
paired VEGF production (Fig. 2B). More specifically, intracellular
staining confirmed VEGF production by niT cells (Fig. 2B). We
analyzed the proangiogenic function of niT cells in vitro using
Matrigel-based assays. Fig. 2D shows that supernatants from niT
cells (E3P), but not controls, significantly augmented both vessel
length and number of branch points, and was inhibited on IL-17 or
VEGF neutralization.
Depletion of Neutrophils During Pregnancy Leads to Impaired Embryo
and Placenta Development. Although activated neutrophils have
been implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (22),
very little is known about the physiological role of quiescent
neutrophils in pregnancy, despite their increased circulating
numbers during gestation (23). Our observations in the human
system in vitro indicate a potential protective role for quiescent
neutrophils in pregnancy. Therefore, we sought to validate this
hypothesis in murine pregnancy. Pregnant C57BL/6 females
previously mated with BALB/c males were treated with anti-
Ly6G monoclonal antibody (clone IA8, 50 μg i.v.; SI Appendix,
Fig. S3) to deplete maternal neutrophils. Depletions were per-
formed on days 5 and 8 of pregnancy, a time of active placental
development in the mouse (24).
Analysis of pregnant mice at day 12 revealed systemically fewer
Ly6G+ neutrophils in neutrophil-depleted mice compared with
isotype control-treated mice. Importantly, neutrophil depletion led
to a significant reduction in the numbers of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs
retrieved in the draining lymph nodes (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
Figs. S4 and S5). The physiological role of niT cells in pregnancy
was confirmed by our finding of significantly smaller fetuses
(Fig. 3 B and C) and placentas (Fig. 3 C and D) of neutrophil-
depleted pregnancies compared with control pregnancies, a phe-
notype typical of preeclampsia in humans (25).
Histological analyses of placentas in neutrophil-depleted mice
revealed a disorganized structure with reduced thickness of the
maternal decidua, which contains the maternal spiral arteries
(decidua basalis; Db) (Fig. 3E), coupled with poor trophoblast
invasion into the maternal layer (Fig. 3F). Both fetal and pla-
cental size are determined by maternal uteroplacental perfusion
of the placenta, which requires coordinated trophoblast invasion
and recruitment and remodeling of the maternal spiral arteries
(26). Given that IL-17 can promote trophoblast invasion in vitro
(27), it is conceivable that niT cell-derived IL-17 might play a
role in this event. Loss of peripheral (induced) Tregs is known to
hinder placental development (28). Collectively, this evidence
suggests that maternal neutrophils are required for efficient
uteroplacental circulation.
Transfer of Neutrophil-Derived FOXO1 Is Required for niT Cell
Induction. Neutrophils can regulate specific host responses through
the release of microstructures, including neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETS) (29), apoptotic bodies, and microvesicles, which con-
tain a variety of immune-modulatory proteins (30). Exposure to
E3P induced a proapoptotic neutrophil phenotype with low surface
expression of CD16 (31) (Fig. 1A). Conversely, the cytokine GM-
CSF, which promotes leukocyte survival (32), attenuated the pro-
portion of late apoptotic neutrophils (annexin-V+, PI+) by 30% and
50% in control and E3P-treated neutrophils, respectively (Fig. 4A).
Time-course analyses indicated that neutrophil apoptosis following
exposure to E3P begins at 24 h of coculture (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A).

with the supernatants of cocultures described in Fig. 1A. In some cases, IL-17
was blocked during coculture at a concentration of 630 ng/mL, which was
the optimal dose to inhibit the level of IL-17 released in these cocultures
(950 pg/mL). As a positive control, recombinant human IL-17 was added to
medium at the same concentration as in the cocultures. (C) Intracellular staining

 To gain insight into the mechanism of niT-cell induction, we
investigated the ability of E3P- and/or GM-CSF–treated neu-
trophils to transfer cytoplasmic material [monitored through
myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) staining] to T cells. Whereas
treatment of neutrophils with E3P significantly promoted the
transfer of neutrophil proteins to T cells, leading to the gener-
ation of niT cells, this response was reduced and/or inhibited
when neutrophils were treated with GM-CSF (Fig. 4 B and C).
Finally, induction of FOXP3 expression was specific to neutro-
phil-derived apoptotic bodies, as demonstrated by the ineffective
coculture of T cells with monocytic apoptotic bodies (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S6B).
We next sought to identify the molecular interactions medi-
ating niT-cell induction. We first interrogated the role of the
neutrophil-abundant protein Annexin-A1 (AnxA1), because its
up-regulation is a feature of an anti-inflammatory neutrophil
phenotype as promoted by female sex hormones (14, 18). Pre-
treatment of freshly isolated human neutrophils with recombi-
nant AnxA1, at an optimal concentration of 3 nM, reproduced
E3P exposure and subsequent niT-cell induction; however, direct
addition of AnxA1 to T-cells failed to do so (Fig. 5A).
These observations were confirmed by experiments with neu-
trophils and T cells from AnxA1 KO (33) and WT mice. Neu-
trophils from AnxA1 KO or WT mice were treated with E3P and
cocultured as described above. E3P-treated neutrophils from
WT animals induced FOXP3 expression equally in WT T cells
and AnxA1 KO T cells. In contrast, neutrophils from AnxA1 KO
mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression in T cells irrespective

 of hormone treatment (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7A).
Taken together, these data indicate that AnxA1 does not di-
rectly induce differentiation of niT cells, but it may facilitate the
transfer of neutrophil-derived signaling proteins necessary for
niT-cell formation.
The transcription factor FOXO1 is the master regulator nec-
essary for FOXP3 expression in inducible Tregs (34–36). In-
triguingly, FOXO1 is expressed by neutrophils, where it is endowed
with proapoptotic functions (37). Both estrogen and progesterone
can up-regulate FOXO1 in the placenta during pregnancy, and this
transcription factor is important for normal placental development
and decidualization (38, 39). Therefore, we tested whether E3P
exposure up-regulates FOXO1 expression in neutrophils, which on
apoptosis could then transfer the transcription factor via apoptotic
bodies to induce FOXP3 expression in the targeted T cells. Con-
focal microscopy revealed an ∼30-fold increase in FOXO1 ex-
pression in neutrophils treated with E3P compared with untreated
cells (Fig. 5C). Subsequently, EP3 neutrophils were labeled with
anti-FOXO1 antibody by brief osmotic shock and kept overnight in
serum-free media to generate neutrophil apoptotic bodies. Feeding
these apoptotic bodies to autologous T cells effectively transferred
substantial amounts of neutrophil-derived FOXO1 to T cells (Fig.
5D) and FOXP3 expression (Fig. 5E), whereas this transfer did not
occur with apoptotic bodies from control neutrophils. Consistent
with a causal link between FOXO1 transfer via apoptosis and niT-
cell induction, pharmacologic inhibition of FOXO1 significantly
inhibited their ability to undergo apoptosis (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B)
and failed to induce Tregs (Fig. 5F). Neutralization of AnxA1 on
E3P-derived neutrophil apoptotic bodies significantly attenuated
the transfer of FOXO1 via neutrophil apoptotic bodies on in-
duction of FOXP3 (Fig. 5G; compare with 5D).
Activated Neutrophils from Preeclamptic Pregnancies Fail to Induce
niT Cells. Many of the pathological features that we observed in
our in vivo model are compatible with those previously reported
in preeclamptic pregnancies, including loss of neutrophil quies-
cence (22) and reduction of circulating Tregs (40). Preeclampsia
is a multiorgan syndrome of pregnancy that most commonly af-
fects first-time pregnancies in the second trimester of pregnancy
(2–7%) and it is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity
and mortality (41). Lower levels of estriol have been associated
with this pathology (42).
Although the vascular alterations occurring in pre-eclampsia
are well established (43), the impact of immune components
in its pathogenesis is less clear (7). Thus, we next interro-
gated the role of neutrophils in niT-cell induction in women
with preeclampsia. We observed a significant attenuation in
plasma levels of both progesterone and estriol in preeclamptic
women compared with healthy pregnancies (SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
We next compared neutrophil phenotypes in healthy and
preeclamptic patients (SI Appendix, Table S1). Elevated CD11b
expression in neutrophil from preeclamptic patients has been
reported previously (22). Our present analysis demonstrated that
blood and placental neutrophils from preeclamptic patients
displayed an activated phenotype, with high levels of CD16,
CD62L, and CD11b but lower levels of AnxA1 (Fig. 6A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S9 A and B). In this context, we note how de-
fective AnxA1 signaling has been associated with preeclampsia,
because it may result from autoantibodies to the protein or from
reduced placental expression of its receptor FPR2/ALX (44, 45).
To make a direct comparison with the observed attenuation in
fetal size following our in vivo neutrophil depletion model during
pregnancy (Fig. 3), we could quantify that offspring born to our
preeclamptic group had a significantly lower median birth weight
percentile compared with offspring born to mothers in our
healthy group [preeclampsia: 22nd percentile (range, 11th–35th
percentile) vs. healthy: 52nd percentile; range, 44th–68th per-
centile], suggesting fetal growth restriction in our preeclamptic
population, akin to that seen in our mouse model.
We also found that a lower proportion over 24 h of neutro-
phils from preeclamptic patients entered apoptosis (∼10% vs.
20% of healthy) (Fig. 6C), suggesting attenuated apoptotic body
formation. In line with this hypothesis and congruent with the
data in human neutrophils and T cells, we found a significant
reduction in the transfer of neutrophil-derived MRP8 and
AnxA1 in preeclamptic patient-derived T cell/neutrophil cocul-
tures compared with cocultures of cells from healthy pregnancies
(Fig. 6C). This finding was also associated with attenuated
FOXO1 transfer to T cells from neutrophils from preeclamptic
patients compared with their healthy counterparts (Fig. 6D).
In line with previous reports (40, 46), we observed a significant
reduction in circulating and placental CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs in
our preeclamptic patients (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 C and D).
Therefore, we compared the ability of neutrophils isolated from
preeclamptic and healthy donors to induce niT cells. Coculture
of freshly isolated neutrophils and T cells from healthy samples
(blood and placenta) led to the induction of functionally sup-
pressive niT cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S10 A and B), which pro-
duced both IL-10 and IL-17 (SI Appendix, Fig. S10 D and E). In

 contrast, neutrophils from preeclamptic patients failed to induce
niT cells, and the minute proportion of these cells found in the
cocultures displayed low levels of IL-10 and IL-17 (Fig. 6E).
Importantly, treatment of neutrophils from preeclamptic patients
with E3P rectified their defect and led to the induction of niT cells
and ensuing production of IL-10 and IL-17 (Fig. 6E and SI Appendix,
Fig. S9 D and E). Production of IL-17 by niT cells may deliver im-
portant functions, including microbial defense and promotion of
angiogenesis (21), both of which are vital during pregnancy.
FOXO1-Deficient Neutrophils Fail to Induce niT Cells and to Restore
Embryo and Placental Development. To validate the mechanistic
importance of neutrophil-derived FOXO1 transfer to T cells, we
investigated whether neutrophil-derived protein could be trans-
ferred to T cells in vivo, and whether loss of neutrophil-derived
FOXO1 was responsible for the pregnancy defects observed
following neutrophil depletion. We tested the former question by
injecting CFSE-labeled neutrophils at day 6 of pregnancy, fol-
lowing an initial neutrophil depletion at day 5. Spleen, uterine-
draining para-aortic lymph nodes, and nondraining brachial
lymph nodes were harvested 48 h later. As shown in SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S11A, T cells from draining lymph nodes expressed
high levels of CFSE, whereas spleen and nondraining lymph
node T cells did not. More specifically, a large proportion of
CD4+FOXP3+ T cells expressed Ly6G+ CFSE+ (SI Appendix,
Fig. S11B), suggesting transfer of neutrophil-derived products
to T cells in vivo.
To validate the relevance of the FOXO1/FOXP3 axis to niT-cell
generation in pregnancy, we selectively knocked down FOXO1 in
murine neutrophils using lentiviral delivery. Two different short-
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific for FOXO1 (FOXO1 30 and
FOXO1 42) and a nonspecific control were transduced into bone
marrow progenitor cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 A and B). After
24 h, progenitor cells were stimulated with GCSF for 5 d to
develop into Ly6G+ neutrophils (∼80% after puromycin treat-
ment; SI Appendix, Fig. S12C). In vitro, FOXO1-sufficient neu-
trophils were capable of inducing niT cells when cocultured with
naïve T cells, whereas FOXO1-deficient neutrophils were ineffective
(SI Appendix, Fig. S13A). This correlated with a reduced ability to
induce IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF (SI Appendix, Fig. S13 B–D).
In a final series of experiments, we wished to establish the
physiological relevance of this mechanism in vivo. To this end,
we reconstituted neutrophil-depleted pregnant mice with either
FOXO1-sufficient (nonspecific) or FOXO1-deficient (FOXO1
30 or FOXO1 42) neutrophils (3 × 106 i.v.) at days 6 and 9 of
pregnancy. Neutrophil depletion was performed at days 5 and 8
as described above. Pregnant mice were analyzed at day 12 of
gestation. Similar numbers of Ly6G+ neutrophils were present in
the uterine-draining lymph nodes following reconstitution with
either FOXO1-sufficient or FOXO1 knockdown neutrophils
(Fig. 7A, Left). Similarly, there was no difference in the number
of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7A, Middle). In contrast, the number of
CD4+FOXP3+ T cells was significantly decreased (∼75%) fol-
lowing reconstitution with FOXO1-deficient neutrophils com-
pared with FOXO1-sufficient neutrophils (Fig. 7A, Right). This
was accompanied by a diminished proportion of cells making
IL-10, IL-17, and VEGF following reconstitution of FOXO1
knockdown neutrophils.
To conclusively establish the effects of reconstituted donor
neutrophils on Treg induction and to confirm the results shown
in SI Appendix, Fig. S11, we used neutrophils from CD45.1
congenic mice. The purity of injected donor CD45.1+ neutro-
phils is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. 13E. Bone marrow progenitors
from these mice were transduced, cultured into neutrophils, and
finally injected into pregnant CD45.2 recipients. We evaluated
the presence of donor CD45.1+ neutrophils at two distinct time
points after injection: 16 h and 3 d later. We observed two dis-
tinct populations of neutrophils within the draining lymph nodes
at 16 h postinjection: CD45.2+ resident neutrophils and CD45.1+
donor neutrophils. The proportion of neutrophils did not change
significantly despite FOXO1 knockdown, suggesting that FOXO1

 is not required for migration of neutrophils to the draining lymph
nodes; however, we did not find any CD45.1+ donor neutrophils in
nonpregnant controls (Fig. 7B, contour plots). At 3 d postinjection
(day 12 of pregnancy), we failed to see any live CD45.1+ donor
neutrophils (Fig. 7B, dot plots). This finding was expected, given
that neutrophils need to undergo apoptosis to induce Tregs in this
system. Interestingly, despite the low number of CD45.1 Ly6G+
neutrophils identified in the draining lymph nodes, we still ob-
served no difference in total number of Ly6G+ neutrophils in the
draining lymph nodes (Fig. 7A, Left), suggesting that migration of
endogenous neutrophils to the draining is not affected. This could
be related to the IL-17 made by T cells in the draining lymph
nodes (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) following reconstitution of non-
specific transduced neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, FOXO1
knockdown neutrophils, because this cytokine has been shown to
promote neutrophil migration into draining lymph nodes (47).
Although we did not detect CD45.1 neutrophils in the drain-
age, we did detect a CD45.1+ signal within the CD4+FOXP3+

 T cell population (Fig. 7C). Importantly, this effect was observed
only when mice were injected with CD45.1 neutrophils transduced
with nonspecific virus, and not with FOXO1-depleted CD45.1
neutrophils. The CD45.1+ signal within the Treg population was
of neutrophil origin, because it was accompanied by Ly6G staining
(which was not seen on CD45.2+ cells; Fig. 7C for histograms and
SI Appendix, Fig. 13F for singlet gating). Moreover, this phenom-
enon was pregnancy-specific, because injection of CD45.1 neutro-
phils into nonpregnant females did not yield a CD45.1 signal in the
Treg population recovered from the draining lymph nodes, and was
not seen in the nondraining lymph nodes or spleens of pregnant
mice (Fig. 7C and SI Appendix, Fig. 13G). Taken together, the
foregoing data conclusively demonstrate that neutrophils are
able to transfer their protein content directly to T cells in vivo to
induce Tregs during pregnancy and is hindered in the absence of
neutrophil-derived FOXO1.

 those in mice that did not undergo neutrophil depletion (Fig. 7
D–F, Left), coupled with an organized placental structure and
normal trophoblast invasion into the maternal layer (Fig. 7G,
Left and SI Appendix, Fig. 13H). Pregnant mice reconstituted
with FOXO1-knockdown neutrophils yielded significantly smaller
embryos and placentas (Fig. 7 D–F, Middle and Right). The pla-
cental layers of these mice displayed a disorganized morphology
with poor trophoblast invasion and were comparable to placentas
following neutrophil depletion (Fig. 7G, Middle and Right). This
difference in placental phenotype between total loss of neutrophil
(depletion) and selective loss of neutrophil FOXO1 suggests
that, in addition to niT-cell induction by FOXO1 transfer, ma-
ternal neutrophils might exert other direct effects (i.e., niT cell-
independent) on placental development.
Discussion
The ability of neutrophils to impact adaptive immunity has re-
cently emerged (10), although it has not been considered in the
context of a regulatory/tolerant phenotype. Here we describe a
role for a specific neutrophil functional phenotype—consequent
to exposure to maternal and placental hormones—in the in-
duction of a population of proangiogenic T cells with regula-
tory properties in pregnancy. The differentiation of niT cells is
reliant on AnxA1-facilitated transfer of FOXO1 contained
in neutrophil apoptotic bodies to T cells during activation; niT
cells are required to maintain normal pregnancy outcomes as
depletion of neutrophils during pregnancy leads to smaller
embryo sizes and abnormal placentation in mice. Whereas the
presence of activated neutrophils in the maternal circulation
has been reported to be detrimental in pregnancy complica-
tions, including preeclampsia (22, 48), our observations suggest
that a regulatory nonactivated proapoptotic neutrophil phe-
notype promoted by pregnancy hormones might be essential for
normal placentation, including its vascular development. The
cytokine milieu that results from niT-cell generation could favor
the establishment of a proangiogeneic environment, with both
IL-10 and IL-17 promoting vessel development (21, 49) and IL-17
promoting trophoblast invasion (27, 50), both key processes in
spiral artery remodelling (26). In addition, and more specifically,
we have shown that niT cells make IL-17–dependent VEGF,
lending further support to their proangiogenic function within the
placenta.
Analyses carried out in samples from women with pre-
eclampsia provide pathological relevance to this mechanistic
work, identifying defects in this physiological circuit that may be
contributory to poor pregnancy outcomes of preeclampsia.
During healthy pregnancy, the maternal immune system adapts
to allow survival of a partially histoincompatible fetus, and fail-
ure of this adaptation contributes to poor placental invasion that
predates the clinical onset of preeclampsia. Studies have sug-
gested that impaired expansion of inducible Treg (iTreg) cells
(40, 51), particularly in the decidua, might represent a patho-
genic defect in preeclampsia. A key feature of the niT-cell
population that we describe is its ability to produce IL-17. Whereas
there is general agreement that in healthy pregnancy, there is a
preferential differentiation of iTreg cells over Th17 cells sys-
temically, the functional significance of Th17 cells in the decidua
is controversial. An increased decidual Th17 cell percentage in
women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages compared with
those with healthy pregnancies has been described previously
(52); however, another study reported higher percentages of
Th17 cells in the decidua in healthy pregnancies (27). Our ob-
servations suggest that IL-17–producing niT cells rather than
“conventional” Th17 effectors in the placenta might in fact be re-
quired to support vascular development in healthy pregnancy, given
that IL-17 is known to promote angiogenesis and tissue growth (21).
Neutrophil-derived FOXO1 plays an important role in niT-
cell induction and the maintenance of embryo size and normal
placentation. FOXO1 is a known important transcription factor
that promotes FOXP3 expression in T cells; however, FOXO1
has broader implications in placentation and indeed is necessary
for normal placental development, as indicated by the abnor-
malities observed in FOXO1-null mice (38). Similarly, the role of
Tregs in pregnancy might not be confined to regulating immune
responses; broader effects of Tregs on the maternal vasculature
have been reported, with downstream relevance in controlling
hypertension and other cardiovascular events (53). Moreover,
Tregs can modulate cell surface proteins on endothelial cells,
leading to an anti-inflammatory endothelial cell phenotype (54).
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that failure to promote appro-
priate niT-cell generation might prevent the establishment of a
proangiogenic environment within the placenta. Further studies
are warranted to test this hypothesis.
The induction of niT cells by neutrophils likely occurs physio-
logically in the uterine-draining lymph nodes during the pre-
sentation of paternal antigens to circulating allospecific T cells, as
reported previously (55). In this context, we have shown that neu-
trophils can access lymph nodes where they exchange cellular ma-
terial with T cells. In our system, neutrophil protein transfer occurs
selectively in the uterine-draining lymph nodes, the only likely site
of active immunity during pregnancy in otherwise healthy mice,
suggesting that T-cell activation is also required for the transfer of
neutrophil material—as we have shown in our in vitro studies—and
that TCR triggering likely induces a permissive status for the
“acceptance” of neutrophilic proteins into T cells. The molecular
features of this permissive status remain to be established.
Importantly, as the induction of this neutrophil phenotype
occurs in the absence of other signals (e.g., inflammatory) as a
consequence of exposure to circulating hormones, it is conceiv-
able that this functional status might arise in neutrophils sys-
temically during pregnancy and might affect ongoing T-cell
activation in sites other than the fetal-maternal unit—hence the
well described remission of antigenically unrelated autoimmune
responses during pregnancy (56).
In conclusion, we report a cell-to-cell cross-talk whereby E3P
programs neutrophils to induce proangiogenic T cells, thus en-
abling sustainable placenta/fetus interface development. We
predict that neutrophil regulatory properties in several facets of
the adaptive immune response, tolerance in particular, can be
further identified to decipher the way in which innate and
adaptive immune systems cooperate, providing both opportu-
nities for defining new pathogenic mechanisms and novel
modes for therapeutic interventions.
