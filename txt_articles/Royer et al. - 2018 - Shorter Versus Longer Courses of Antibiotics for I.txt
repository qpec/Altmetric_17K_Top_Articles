A
cute infections are a leading cause of hospitaliza-
tion and are associated with high cost, morbidity, 
and mortality.1 There is a growing body of litera-
ture to support shorter antibiotic courses to treat 
several different infection types.2-6 This is because longer 
treatment courses promote the emergence of multidrug re-
sistant (MDR) organisms,7-9 microbiome perturbation,10 and 
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).11 They are also associated 
with more drug side effects, longer hospitalizations, and in-
creased costs.  
Despite increasing support for shorter treatment courses, 
inpatient prescribing practice varies widely, and redundant an-
tibiotic therapy is common.12-14 Furthermore, aside from venti-
lator-associated pneumonia (VAP),15,16 prior systematic reviews 
of antibiotic duration have typically included outpatient and 
pediatric patients,3-6,17-19 for whom the risk of treatment failure 
may be lower.
Given the potential for harm with inappropriate antibiotic 
treatment duration and the variation in current clinical prac-
tice, we sought to systematically review clinical trials compar-
ing shorter versus longer antibiotic courses in adolescents 
and adults hospitalized for acute infection. We focused on 
common sites of infection in hospitalized patients, including 
pulmonary, bloodstream, soft tissue, intra-abdominal, and uri-
nary.20,21 We hypothesized that shorter courses would be suf-
ficient to cure infection and associated with lower costs and 
fewer complications. Because we hypothesized that shorter 
durations would be sufficient regardless of clinical course, we 
focused on studies in which the short course of antibiotics was 
specified at study onset, not determined by clinical improve-
ment or biomarkers. We analyzed all infection types together 
because current sepsis treatment guidelines place little em-
phasis on infection site.22 In contrast to prior reviews, we fo-
cused exclusively on adult and adolescent inpatients because 
the risks of a too-short treatment duration may be lower in pe-
diatric and outpatient populations.

BACKGROUND: Infection is a leading cause of 
hospitalization with high morbidity and mortality, but 
there are limited data to guide the duration of antibiotic 
therapy.  
PURPOSE: Systematic review to compare outcomes 
of shorter versus longer antibiotic courses among 
hospitalized adults and adolescents.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Embase databases,  
1990-2017.  
STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were human 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English comparing 
a prespecified short course of antibiotics to a longer 
course for treatment of infection in hospitalized adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older.  
DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently 
extracted study characteristics, methods of statistical 
analysis, outcomes, and risk of bias.  
DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 5187 unique citations identified,  
19 RCTs comprising 2867 patients met our inclusion 
criteria, including the following: 9 noninferiority trials,  
1 superiority design trial, and 9 pilot studies. Across  
13 studies evaluating 1727 patients, no significant 
difference in clinical efficacy was observed (d = 1.6% [95% 
confidence interval (CI), −1.0%-4.2%]). No significant 
difference was detected in microbiologic cure (8 studies,  
d = 1.2% [95% CI, −4.1%-6.4%]), short-term mortality  
(8 studies, d = 0.3% [95% CI, −1.2%-1.8%]), longer-term 
mortality (3 studies, d = −0.4% [95% CI, −6.3%-5.5%]),  
or recurrence (10 studies, d = 2.1% [95% CI, −1.2%-5.3%]). 
Heterogeneity across studies was not significant for any  
of the primary outcomes.  
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available literature, shorter 
courses of antibiotics can be safely utilized in hospitalized 
patients with common infections, including pneumonia, 
urinary tract infection, and intra-abdominal infection, 
to achieve clinical and microbiologic resolution without 
adverse effects on mortality or recurrence. Journal of

METHODS
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analyses.23 The review was registered on the 
Prospero database.24
Information Sources and Search Strategy
We performed serial literature searches for articles in English 
comparing shorter versus longer antibiotics courses in hospital-
ized patients. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed and Embase 
(January 1, 1990, to July 1, 2017). We used Boolean operators, 
Boolean logic, and controlled vocabulary (eg, Medical Sub-
ject Heading [MeSH] terms) for each key word. We identified 
published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of conditions of 
interest (MeSH terms: “bacteremia,” “sepsis,” “pneumonia,” 
“pyelonephritis,” “intra-abdominal infection,” “cellulitis,” 
“soft tissue infection”) that compared differing lengths of an-
tibiotic treatment (keywords: “time factors,” “duration,” “long 
course,” “short course”) and evaluated outcomes (key words: 
“mortality,” “recurrence,” “secondary infections”). We hand 
searched references of included citations. The full search strat-
egy is presented in supplementary Appendix 1.
Study Eligibility and Selection Criteria
To meet criteria for inclusion, a study had to (1) be an RCT; (2) in-
volve an adult or adolescent population age ≥12 years (or report 
outcomes separately for such patients); (3) involve an inpatient 
population (or report outcomes separately for inpatients); (4) 
stipulate a short course of antibiotics per protocol prior to ran-
domization and not determined by clinical response, change 
in biomarkers, or physician discretion; (5) compare the short 
course to a longer course of antibiotics, which could be deter-
mined either per protocol or by some other measure; and (6) 
involve antibiotics given to treat infection, not as prophylaxis.  
Two authors (SR and HCP) independently reviewed the title 
and/or abstracts of all articles identified by the search strategy. 
We calculated interrater agreement with a kappa coefficient. 
Both authors (SR and HCP) independently reviewed the full 
text of each article selected for possible inclusion by either 
author. Disagreement regarding eligibility was adjudicated by 
discussion.  
Data Abstraction
Two authors (SR and HCP) independently abstracted study 
methodology, definitions, and outcomes for each study using a 
standardized abstraction tool (see supplementary Appendix 2). 
 
 
 
Study Quality
We assessed article quality using the Cochrane Collaboration’s 
tool,25 which evaluates 6 domains of possible bias, including 
sequence generation, concealment, blinding, and incomplete 
or selective outcome reporting. The tool is a 6-point scale, 
with 6 being the best score. It is recommended for assessing 
bias because it evaluates randomization and allocation con-
cealment, which are not included in other tools.26 We did not 
exclude studies based on quality but considered studies with 
scores of 5-6 to have a low overall risk of bias.  
Study Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
Our primary outcomes were clinical cure, microbiologic 
cure, mortality, and infection recurrence. Secondary out-
comes were secondary MDR infection, cost, and length of 
stay (LOS). We conducted all analyses with Stata MP version 
14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). For each outcome, we 
reported the difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) be-
tween treatment arms as the rate in the short course arm mi-
nus the rate in the long course arm, consistent with the typ-
ical presentation of noninferiority data. When not reported 
in a study, we calculated risk difference and 95% CI using re-
ported patient-level data. Positive values for risk difference 
favor the short course arm for favorable outcomes (ie, clini-
cal and microbiologic cure) and the long course arm for ad-
verse outcomes (ie, mortality and recurrence). A meta-anal-
ysis was used to pool risk differences across all studies for 
primary outcomes and for clinical cure in the community-ac-
quired pneumonia (CAP) subgroup. We also present results 
as odds ratios and risk ratios in the online supplement. All 
meta-analyses used random effects models, as described 
by DerSimonian and Laird,27,28 with variance estimates of 
heterogeneity taken from the Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects 
model. We investigated heterogeneity between studies us-
ing the χ2 I2 statistic. We considered a P < .1 to indicate sta-
tistically significant heterogeneity and classified heteroge-
neity as low, moderate, or high on the basis of an I2 of 25%, 
50%, or 75%, respectively. We used funnel plots to assess for 
publication bias.
RESULTS
Search Results
We identified 5187 unique citations, of which 110 underwent 
full-text review (Figure 1). Reviewer agreement for selection of 
title and/or abstracts for full evaluation was 99.1% (kappa = 
0.71). Nineteen RCTs with a total of 2867 patients met inclusion 
criteria and were included in the analysis.29-47
Characteristics of Included Studies
Publication years ranged from 1991 to 2015 (Table). Study pop-
ulations were primarily from Europe (n = 9) or the United States 
(n = 5). Pneumonia was the most common infection studied, 
with 3 studies evaluating VAP and 9 studies evaluating CAP
. 
There were also 3 studies of intra-abdominal infections, 2 stud-
ies of urinary tract infections (UTIs), 1 study of typhoid fever, 
and 1 study of hospital-acquired infection of unknown origin. 
No studies of bacteremia or soft tissue infections met inclusion 
criteria. Short courses of antibiotics ranged from 1 to 8 days, 
while long courses ranged from 3 to 15 days.  
Common study outcomes included clinical cure or efficacy 
(composite of symptom cure and improvement; n = 13), infec-
tion recurrence (n = 10), mortality (n = 9), microbiologic cure (n 
= 8), and LOS (n = 7; supplementary Table 1).  
Nine studies were pilot studies, 1 was a traditional supe-
riority design study, and 9 were noninferiority studies with 
a prespecified limit of equivalence of either 10% (n = 7) or 
 
15% (n = 2).

Clinical Cure and Efficacy 
Thirteen studies of 1727 patients evaluated clinical cure and 
efficacy (Figure 2).29,30,33,35-40,44-47 The overall risk difference was d 
= 1.6% (95% CI, −1.0%-4.2%), and the pooled odds ratio was 
1.11 (95% CI, 0.85-1.45; supplementary Table 2). There was no 
heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 0%, P = .55). Five of 6 stud-
ies with a noninferiority design met their prespecified margin, 
while 1 study of VAP failed to meet the 15% noninferiority mar-
gin (d = −11.2% [95% CI, −26.3%-3.8%]).37  
Nine studies of 1225 patients evaluated clinical cure and ef-
ficacy in CAP (supplementary Figure 1).29,35,38-40,44-47 The overall 
risk difference was d = 2.4% (95% CI, −0.7%-5.5%). There was 
no heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 0%, P = .45). 
Microbiologic Cure
Eight studies of 366 patients evaluated microbiologic cure 
(supplementary Figure 2).32-34,36,38,40,41,47 The overall risk differ-
ence was d = 1.2% (95% CI, −4.1%-6.4%). There was no sta-
tistically significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 13.3%, 
P = .33).
Mortality
Eight studies of 1740 patients evaluated short-term mortality 
(in hospital to 45 days; Figure 2),30-32,37,39,41,43 while 3 studies of 
654 patients evaluated longer-term mortality (60 to 180 days; 
supplementary Figure 3).30,31,33 The overall risk difference was d 
= 0.3% (95% CI, −1.2%-1.8%) for short-term mortality and d = 
−0.4% (95% CI, −6.3%-5.5%) for longer-term mortality. There 
was no heterogeneity between studies for either short-term 
 
(I2 = 0.0%, P = .66) or longer-term mortality (I2 = 0.0%, P = .69).
Infection Recurrence
Ten studies of 1554 patients evaluated infection recurrence 
(Figure 2).30-34,40-42,45,46 The overall risk difference was d = 2.1% 
(95% CI, −1.2%-5.3%). There was no statistically significant 
heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 21.0%, P = .25). Two of 
the 3 studies with noninferiority design (both evaluating 
 
intra-abdominal infections) met their prespecified margins.41,42 
In Chastre et al.,31 the overall population (d = 3.0%; 95% CI, 
−5.8%-11.7%) and the subgroup with VAP due to nonferment-
ing gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB; d = 15.2%; 95% CI, −0.9%-
31.4%) failed to meet the 10% noninferiority margin.  
Secondary Outcomes
Three studies30,31,42 of 286 patients (with VAP or intra- 
abdominal infection) evaluated the emergence of MDR 
 
organisms. The overall risk difference was d = −9.0% (95% CI, 
−19.1%-1.1%; P = .081). There was no statistically significant

heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 7.6%, P = .34).
Seven studies examined LOS—3 in the intensive care unit 
(ICU)30,31,43 and 4 on the wards32,36,40,41—none of which found sig-
nificant differences between treatment arms. Across 3 studies 
of 672 patients, the weighted average for ICU LOS was 23.6 
days in the short arm versus 22.2 days in the long arm. Across 4 
studies of 235 patients, the weighted average for hospital LOS 
was 23.3 days in the short arm versus 29.7 days in the long arm. 
This difference was driven by a 1991 study41 of spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis (SBP), in which the average LOS was 37 
days and 50 days in the short- and long-course arms, respec-
tively.  
Three studies32,41,43 of 186 total patients (with SBP or hospi-
tal-acquired infection of unknown origin) examined the cost 
of antibiotics. The weighted average cost savings for shorter 
courses in 2016 US dollars48 was $265.19. 
Three studies30,33,43 of 618 patients evaluated cases of CDI, 
during 10-, 30-, and 180-day total follow-up. The overall risk dif-
ference was d = 0.7% (95% CI, −1.3%-2.8%), with no statistically 
significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 0%, P = .97).  
Study Quality
Included studies scored 2-5 on the Cochrane Collaboration 
Risk of Bias Tool (supplementary Figure 4). Four studies had 
an overall low risk of bias,36,37,43,46 while 15 had a moderate to 
high risk of bias (supplementary Table 3).29-35,38-42,44,45,47 Common 
sources of bias included inadequate details to confirm ade-
quate randomization and/or concealment (n = 13) and lack of 
adequate blinding (n = 18). Two studies were stopped early,37,42 
and 3 others were possibly stopped early because it was un-
clear how the number of participants was determined.29,33,47 
Covariate imbalance (failure of randomization) was present in 
2 studies.37,47 There was no evidence of selective outcome re-
porting or publication bias based on the funnel plots (supple-
mentary Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-anal-
ysis of RCTs of shorter versus longer antibiotic courses for 
adults and adolescents hospitalized for infection. The rate of 
clinical cure was indistinguishable between patients random-
ized to shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic therapy, 
and the meta-analysis was well powered to confirm noninferi-
ority. The lower 95% CI indicates that any potential benefit of 
longer antibiotics is not more than 1%, far below the typical 
margin of noninferiority. Subgroup analysis of patients hospi-
talized with CAP also showed noninferiority of a prespecified 
shorter treatment duration. 
The rate of microbiologic cure was likewise indistinguish-
able, and the meta-analysis was again well powered to confirm 
noninferiority. Any potential benefit of longer antibiotics for 
microbial cure is quite small (not more than 4%).  
Our study also demonstrates noninferiority of prespeci-
fied shorter antibiotic courses for mortality. Shorter- and lon-
ger-term mortality were both indistinguishable in patients 
randomized to shorter antibiotic courses. The meta-analyses 
for mortality were well powered, with any potential benefit of 
longer antibiotic durations being less than 2% for short-term 
and less than 6% for long-term mortality.    
We also examined for complications related to antibiotic 
therapy. Infection recurrence was indistinguishable, with any 
potential benefit of longer antibiotics being less than 6%. Se-
lect infections (eg, VAP due to NF-GNB, catheter-associated 
UTI) may be more susceptible to relapse after shorter treat-
ment courses, while most patients hospitalized with infection 
do not have an increased risk for relapse with shorter treatment 
courses. Consistent with other studies,8 the emergence of 
FIG 2. Forest plots (clinical efficacy, short-term mortality, infection recurrence). 
NOTE: Fifteen percent was used as the limit of equivalence for the difference 
between short-course and long-course groups in 2 studies (Kollef et al.37 
and Runyon et al41). Ten percent was used as the limit of equivalence for the 
difference between short-course and long-course groups in 7 studies (Capellier 
et al.,30 Chastre et al.,31 Darouiche et al.,33 Dunbar et al.,35 Leophonte et al,39 
Sawyer et al,42 and Zhao et al.47). For favorable outcomes (eg, clinical efficacy), 
positive values favor the short-course arm, and the lower limit of the 95% confi-
dence interval must be >−10% or >−15% to confirm noninferiority. For adverse 
outcomes (eg, mortality and infection recurrence), negative values favor the 
short course group, and the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval must 
be <10% or <15% to confirm noninferiority. **Met prespecified noninferiority 
margin. *Evaluated noninferiority but did not meet prespecified margin.

 Antibiotic Duration Systematic Review   |   Royer et al
An Official Publication of the Society of Hospital Medicine 
Journal of Hospital Medicine    Vol 13  |  No 5  |  May 2018          341
MDR organisms was 9% less common in patients randomized 
to shorter antibiotic courses. This difference failed to meet sta-
tistical significance, likely due to poor power. The emergence 
of MDR pathogens was included in just 3 of 19 studies, under-
scoring the need for additional studies on this outcome. 
Although our meta-analyses indicate noninferiority of short-
er antibiotic courses in hospitalized patients, the included 
studies are not without shortcomings. Only 4 of the included 
studies had low risk of bias, while 15 had at least moderate risk. 
The nearly universal source of bias was a lack of blinding. Only 
1 study37 was completely blinded, and only 3 others had partial 
blinding. Adequate randomization and concealment were also 
lacking in several studies. However, there was no evidence of 
selective outcome reporting or publication bias.
Our findings are consistent with prior studies indicating non-
inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses in other settings and 
patient populations. Pediatric studies have demonstrated the 
success of shorter antibiotic courses in both outpatient49 and 
inpatient populations.50 Prior meta-analyses have shown non-
inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses in adults with VAP15,16; in 
neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients with bacteremia17; and 
in pediatric and adult patients with pneumonia and UTI.3-6,18,19 
Our meta-analysis extends the evidence for the safety of short-
er treatment courses to adults hospitalized with common in-
fections, including pneumonia, UTI, and intra-abdominal infec-
tions. Because neonatal, pediatric, and nonhospitalized adult 
patients may have a lower risk for treatment failure and lower 
risk for mortality in the event of treatment failure, we focused 
exclusively on hospitalized adults and adolescents.  
In contrast to prior meta-analyses, we included studies of 
multiple different sites of infection. This allowed us to assess 
a large number of hospitalized patients and achieve a nar-
row margin of noninferiority. It is possible that the benefit of 
optimal treatment duration varies by type of infection. (And 
indeed, absolute duration of treatment differed across stud-
ies.) We used a random-effects framework, which recognizes 
that the true benefit of shorter versus longer duration may vary 
across study populations. The heterogeneity between studies 
in our meta-analysis was quite low, suggesting that the results 
are not explained by a single infection type.  
There are limited data on late effects of longer antibiot-
ic courses. Antibiotic therapy is associated with an increased 
risk for CDI for 3 months afterwards.11 However, the duration 
of follow-up in the included studies rarely exceeded 1 month, 
which could underestimate incidence. The effect of antibiotics 
on gut microbiota may persist for months, predisposing pa-
tients to secondary infections. It is plausible that disruption in 
gut microbiota and risk for CDI may persist longer in patients 
treated with longer antibiotic courses. However, the existing 
studies do not include sufficient follow-up to confirm or refute 
this hypothesis.    
Our review has several limitations. First, we included studies 
that compared an a priori-defined short course of antibiotics 
to a longer course and excluded studies that defined a short 
course of antibiotics based on clinical response. Because we 
did not specify an exact length for short or long courses, we 
cannot make explicit recommendations about the absolute 
duration of antibiotic therapy. Second, we included multiple 
infection types. It is possible that the duration of antibiotics 
required may differ by infection type. However, there were not 
sufficient data for subgroup analyses for each infection type. 
This highlights the need for additional data to guide the treat-
ment of severe infections. Third, not all studies considered 
antibiotic duration in isolation. One study included a catheter 
change in the short arm only, which could have favored the 
short course.33 Three studies used different doses of antibiotics 
in addition to different durations.35,45,47 Fourth, the quality of 
included studies was variable, with lack of blinding and inade-
quate randomization present in most studies.
CONCLUSION
Based on the available literature, shorter courses of antibiotics 
can be safely utilized in hospitalized adults and adolescents 
to achieve clinical and microbiologic resolution of common 
infections, including pneumonia, UTI, and intra-abdominal in-
fection, without adverse effect on infection recurrence. More-
over, short- and longer-term mortality are indistinguishable 
after treatment courses of differing duration. There are limited 
data on the longer-term risks associated with antibiotic dura-
tion, such as secondary infection or the emergence of MDR 
organisms.
