Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at markedly increased 
risk for duodenal polyps and cancer. Surgical and endoscopic management of duodenal neoplasia 
is difficult and chemoprevention has not been successful.
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the effect of a combination of sulindac and erlotinib on duodenal 
adenoma regression in patients with FAP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trial, enrolling 92 participants with FAP, conducted from July 2010 through June 2014 at 
Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah.
INTERVENTIONS—Participants with FAP were randomized to sulindac (150 mg) twice daily 
and erlotinib (75 mg) daily (n = 46) vs placebo (n = 46) for 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The total number and diameter of polyps in the 
proximal duodenum were mapped at baseline and 6 months. The primary outcome was change in 
total polyp burden at 6 months. Polyp burden was calculated as the sum of the diameters of polyps. 
The secondary outcomes were change in total duodenal polyp count, change in duodenal polyp 
burden or count stratified by genotype and initial polyp burden, and percentage of change from 
baseline in duodenal polyp burden.
RESULTS—Ninety-two participants (mean age, 41 years [range, 24–55]; women, 56 [61%]) 
were randomized when the trial was stopped by the external data and safety monitoring board 
because the second preplanned interim analysis met the prespecified stopping rule for superiority. 
Grade 1 and 2 adverse events were more common in the sulindac-erlotinib group, with an acne-
like rash observed in 87% of participants receiving treatment and 20% of participants receiving 
placebo (P < .001). Only 2 participants experienced grade 3 adverse events.

 research is necessary to evaluate these preliminary findings in a larger study population with 
longer follow-up to determine whether the observed effects will result in improved clinical 
outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT 01187901
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant, inherited disorder caused 
by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene.1 The disease is 
characterized by the formation of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the 
colorectum and a nearly 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer, if left untreated.2 
Prophylactic colectomy has become the standard of care, once the extent of colorectal 
polyposis is beyond endoscopic control and abrogates the risk of colorectal cancer. Patients 
with FAP are also at greatly increased risk for duodenal neoplasia, with duodenal adenomas 
eventually forming in more than 50% of participants and duodenal adenocarcinoma 
occurring in up to 12%.2,3 Following colectomy, duodenal adenocarcinoma is the leading 
cause of cancer death in these patients, and prevention of duodenal adenocarcinomas by 
endoscopic surveillance with polyp resection, duodenectomy, Whipple surgical procedure, 
and ampullectomy are often challenging and suboptimal.4
Multiple studies have shown that the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, sulindac (a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID]) significantly inhibits colorectal adenomatous 
polyps in patients with FAP5,6; however, NSAIDs have much less efficacy in duodenal 
adenomas.7,8 Celecoxib use resulted in a modest reduction of duodenal9 and colorectal 
polyps,10,11 but is no longer US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved for this 
indication, due to lack of complete follow-up studies.12
Studies have suggested that APC inactivation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
signaling promote cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression and the subsequent development 
of intestinal neoplasia.13,14 The convergence between the Wnt and EGFR signaling 
pathways and COX-2 activity was demonstrated in a mouse model of FAP, in which a 
combination of sulindac and an EGFR inhibitor diminished small intestinal adenoma 
development by 87%.15 These results led us to test the hypothesis that a combination of 
COX and EGFR inhibition would reduce adenoma formation in the duodenum of patients 
with FAP.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of participants with FAP 
conducted at a single academic cancer center from July 2010 to June 2014 (Figure 1). 
Participants were identified and recruited from Huntsman Cancer Institute research 
registries.
Participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study, and ethical 
approval was obtained from the University of Utah institutional review board. The study 
protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1.

 Eligible participants were aged 18 to 69 years at time of enrollment and either were proven 
carriers of a pathologic mutation of the APC gene (genetic diagnosis) or had more than 100 
adenomas in the large intestine and were members of a family with FAP (clinical diagnosis). 
Participants with attenuated FAP and an APC genetic diagnosis were included. Randomized 
participants were required to have the presence of duodenal polyps with a minimum sum of 
diameters of 5 mm or more at baseline.
Exclusion criteria included the following: unwillingness to discontinue taking NSAIDs 
within 1 month of treatment initiation, absence of the use of effective birth control in women 
of childbearing age, pregnancy or breastfeeding, a white blood cell count of less than 
4000/µL, a platelet count of less than 100 × 103/µL, a hemoglobin level of less than 12 g/dL, 
a serum creatinine level of more than 1.5 mg/dL (to convert to µmol/L, multiply by 88.4), 
transaminases/ bilirubin/alkaline phosphatase elevations 1.5- to 2-fold above the upper limit 
of normal, symptoms or features of active gastrointestinal bleeding, history of allergy or 
hyper-sensitivity to sulindac, erlotinib, or its excipients, history of cancer within the past 3 
years (except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix or basal/squamous cell 
carcinoma of the skin), unstable cardiorespiratory condition, active uncontrolled infection, 
liver disease (such as cirrhosis), active or chronic hepatitis, or prior treatment with an 
investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks.
Randomization and Study Intervention
Participants were randomly assigned with an equal probability in a uniform 1:1 allocation 
ratio. Separate randomization tables were created using a computer program for participants 
with classic and attenuated FAP. The randomization was done in blocks of 2 or 4. Upon 
enrollment, each participant was assigned a randomization number that corresponded to a 
treatment on a randomization list available only to the unblinded study pharmacist. 
Participants were randomly assigned to receive combination therapy with sulindac at a dose 
of 150 mg twice daily and erlotinib at a dose of 75 mg per day or identically appearing 
placebo for 6 months. Erlotinib (FDA IND exemption 108086) and identically appearing 
placebo tablets were provided by the National Cancer Institute’s Division of Cancer 
Prevention, through a contract with the drug manufacturer. Huntsman Cancer Institute 
Investigational Pharmacy provided encapsulated sulindac and identically appearing placebo 
capsules filled with corn starch or microcrystalline cellulose. The investigators and 
participants were blinded to study group assignments. After endoscopic examination at 
study entry to determine eligibility, study drugs were provided to participants and refilled at 
1- to 3-month intervals based on scheduled study visits. Drug compliance was assessed by 
pill count review of participant diaries.
Primary Outcome
The burden of duodenal adenomatous polyps was assessed by endoscopy with flexible video 
endoscopes. Endoscopic evaluations were performed within 30 days before treatment 
initiation with sulindac-erlotinib or placebo was begun (month 0) and 6 months after 
treatment was initiated (month 6). At each examination, 1 of 4 experienced endoscopists 
counted and mapped the total number and size of all polyps to the nearest millimeter in a 10-
cm segment of the duodenum measured from the first portion of the duodenum to a tattoo

 placed at 10 cm distal to the first portion of the duodenum at the baseline endoscopy. 
Multiple passes with the endoscope were made to achieve optimal polyp assessments. Each 
polyp in the duodenal segment was measured once. The primary end point was change in 
total polyp burden at 6 months. Polyp burden was calculated as the sum of the diameters of 
polyps and was determined at baseline and following 6 months of treatment.
Secondary Outcomes
Eleven secondary efficacy end points included (1) change in duodenal polyp number, (2) 
percentage of change from baseline in duodenal polyp burden, (3 and 4) duodenal polyp 
burden stratified by attenuated or classic FAP genotype, (5 and 6) polyp burden stratified by 
low vs high initial polyp burden, (7) per-protocol change in duodenal polyp burden, (8) 
duodenal polyp burden in the subset of participants with a genetic diagnosis, (9 and 10) 
duodenal polyp number stratified by attenuated or classic FAP genotype, and (11) duodenal 
polyp number in the subset of participants with a genetic diagnosis.
Evaluation of Safety
Participants were instructed to contact the study team if there were any changes in health. 
Safety was monitored by telephone interview every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, then 
monthly, with specific review of adverse events. Adverse event documentation included date 
reported, date of onset, description, toxicity grading, action taken, and physician review and 
assessment (if it was an expected adverse reaction, related to study drug, or conferred a 
change in risk). Regular telephone interviews were conducted and documented until 
resolution of the event. Physical examination was done at baseline and months 3 and 6 of 
treatment, and measurement of vital signs and clinical laboratory values were done at 
baseline and months 1, 2, 3, and 6. Adverse events were graded according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, from the US Department of Health 
and Human Services.
Measurement of EGFR Activation Status
Polyps frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of biopsy were dounce homogenized in lysis 
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology #9803), incubated on ice for 10 minutes, and then 
centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 minutes. Protein concentrations were determined (Pierce 
#23225) and then 50 µg of cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The levels of phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr1148) in 
EGFR (Cell Signaling Technology #4404), total EGFR (Epitomics #1902), and actin (MP 
Biomedicals #0869100) were detected by Western blotting according to manufacturer’s 
guidelines.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 50 participants in each treatment group (total, 100 participants) was 
calculated to provide the study with 95% power with a 2-sided α of .05 to detect a 30% 
reduction in the sum of polyp diameters in the treatment group from a mean of 53.0 mm to a 
mean of 37.1 mm. Two planned interim analyses were taken into account in these

 calculations. A 2-sided nominal P value of less than .05 for the final analysis of the primary 
outcome was regarded as statistically significant to account for the 2 interim analyses.
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the 2 groups according to an intention-to-
treat (ITT) principle for the primary and secondary efficacy end points. A per-protocol 
analysis was also performed and included all participants who had an endoscopy 6 months 
after initiating treatment.
Bootstrap sampling was used to create multiple imputation estimates for the 19 participants 
missing end point duodenal polyp burden and polyp count (9 missing in the treatment group 
and 10 missing in the placebo group). For each bootstrap sample, missing values were 
imputed based on linear regression prediction adjusted for randomized treatment group, 
baseline demographics (age, sex, height, weight, and classic or attenuated FAP 
classification) and baseline endoscopy results (baseline duodenal burden, total number of 
duodenal polyps, total gastric polyps, and largest duodenal polyp). Hodges-Lehmann 
estimates of net difference and Mann-Whitney U statistics were calculated for each sample. 
Percentile bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated for the Hodges-Lehmann 
estimator. The bootstrap Mann-Whitney U statistics, adjusted to have mean 0 under the null 
hypothesis, and bootstrap standard error were used to compute a z score. Separate bootstrap 
samples were run for each subgroup to create equal treatment groups and subgroups that had 
the same balance as the randomized group.
The Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the significance threshold for the ITT 
analysis of the 11 secondary outcomes. Nominal P values less than .05/11 = .005 were 
regarded as statistically significant for the ITT analysis of the secondary efficacy outcomes 
as per the Bonferroni correction. Descriptive statistics were used for study variables 
(including age, sex, and months in the study) with frequency tabulations for categorical 
variables and summary statistics (mean and range) for continuously distributed variables. 
Safety was assessed in participants completing the study using descriptive statistics. 
Statistical analysis was performed using R (R Foundation), version 3.2.1. The parallel line 
plot was created using SAS (SAS Institute), version 9.4.
Early Termination Criteria
Two interim analyses for demonstration of efficacy were planned (after the primary outcome 
had been ascertained for one-third and two-thirds of the 100 targeted evaluable participants), 
using an O’Brien-Fleming boundary to preserve studywise type I error of 2.5% (1-sided). 
The nominal P values for significance at the 2 interim and final analyses were less than .
001, .007, and .02, respectively. There was no formal early stopping criterion based on 
futility.
Results
Demographic Characteristics of Participants
From July 2010 through June 2014, 156 participants were assessed for eligibility (Figure 1). 
Sixty-four participants were excluded, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria or declined 
to participate. Ninety-two participants were randomized after the baseline endoscopy. The

 data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed the study at the first interim analysis of 
33 participants. Although the prespecified interim stopping rule had been met the at that 
point, the DSMB recommended continuation of the study. Study investigators were not 
made aware of the results of the interim analysis. The study was stopped after the second 
interim analysis of 67 participants by the DSMB because the prespecified stopping rule for 
the primary end point was met. All participants and investigators remained blinded to 
randomization status until the final study participant completed their end point endoscopy. 
At the time of the DSMB decision to stop the study, 92 participants had been randomized 
and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 46 participants in the sulindac-erlotinib 
group and 46 in the placebo group. Fourteen participants withdrew before the end point 
endoscopy examination and 5 participants did not receive end point examinations due to the 
early halt of the study; thus, 73 randomized participants completed the study with 
pretreatment and posttreatment endoscopy results and were included in the per-protocol 
analysis: 37 participants received sulindac-erlotinib and 36 placebo (Figure 1).
Demographic characteristics between the treatment and placebo groups, including age, were 
similar (Table 1). Overall, 61% of participants were women, with sexes equitably distributed 
between the treatment and placebo groups. Participants with classic and attenuated FAP 
were randomized to the treatment groups separately, yielding similar distributions (30% 
attenuated FAP and 70% classic FAP) in each group. A germline APC mutation was 
confirmed in 88% of participants, including all participants with attenuated FAP.
Outcomes
Primary Outcome—The change in total duodenal polyp burden, defined as the change in 
the median sum diameter of polyps, was significantly different between the placebo and 
sulindac-erlotinib groups at 6 months. There was an 8-mm median increase from baseline in 
the placebo group and an 8.5-mm median decrease from baseline in the sulindac-erlotinib 
group (between-group difference, −19.0 mm [95% CI, −32.0 to −10.9], P < .001) (Figure 2 
and Table 2). This is also presented as a percentage of change in duodenal polyp burden in 
Table 2, showing a 30.6% increase from baseline in the placebo group and a 37.9% decrease 
from baseline in the sulindac-erlotinib group (between-group difference, −71.2% [95%CI,–
100.2% to-45.3%], P < .001).
Secondary Outcomes—In a subgroup analysis of participants with classic FAP (n = 64) 
or attenuated FAP (n = 28), the differences in duodenal polyp burden with treatment vs 
placebo were still significant for both results (between-group difference for treatment vs 
placebo: for participants with classic FAP, −20.0 mm [95% CI, −37.0 to 9.7], P < .001; for 
participants with attenuated FAP, −18.0 mm [95% CI, −33.0 to −8.8], P < .001) (Table 2).
Both a per-protocol analysis (n = 73) and a subgroup analysis limited to the 81 participants 
with a confirmed germline APC mutation (genetic diagnosis subgroup analysis) showed 
consistent results. In both analyses, treatment was associated with a significant reduction in 
duodenal polyp burden compared with placebo (between-group difference for treatment vs 
placebo: for per-protocol analysis, −19.5 mm [95% CI, −33.0 to −11.0], P < .001; for

 germline APC mutation subgroup analysis, −19.2 mm [95% CI, −30.8 to −11.7, P < .001) 
(Table 2).
For total duodenal polyp count, the median increase was 4.3 polyps in the placebo group, but 
decreased by 2.8 polyps in the sulindac-erlotinib group (between-group difference, −8.0 
polyps [95% CI, −12.2 to −4.7], P < .001) (Table 3). Subgroup analyses confirmed similar 
findings in participants with classic or attenuated FAP and a genetic diagnosis.
The chemopreventive effect was evaluated across participants with a wide range of polyp 
numbers at baseline endoscopy. The median total duodenal polyp burden decreased by 6.5 
mm (between-group difference, −9.1 mm [95% CI, −15.5 to −3.8], P < .001) compared with 
baseline among participants with a low initial polyp burden (sum of diameters, ≤21 mm). 
For participants with a high initial duodenal polyp burden (sum of diameters, >21 mm) the 
treatment effect size was much larger, with a median decrease of 13.3 mm in polyp burden 
(between-group difference, −36.6 mm [95% CI, −57.8 to −19.5], P < .001) compared with 
baseline (Table 2). An endoscopic view of duodenal polyposis before and after 6 months of 
treatment with sulindac and erlotinib is shown in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2.
To assess the activation status of EGFR in the polyps, we determined the level of 
phosphorylated EGFR in polyp lysates and found detectable phosphorylated EGFR in 6 of 7 
polyps from the placebo group (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2; placebo group shown in lanes 8–
14, with phosphorylated EGFR detectable in lanes 9–14), but minimal or no phosphorylated 
EGFR in 7 of 7 polyps harvested from the sulindac-erlotinib–treated group (eFigure 2 in 
Supplement 2; in lanes 1–7). These data indicate that the sulindac-erlotinib treatment 
effectively limited activation of EGFR.
Study Safety
Treatment with sulindac-erlotinib for a 6-month period was generally well tolerated. 
Adverse events were reported in 76 individuals (83%), with 27 of the total 92 enrolled 
participants (29%) having grade 2 or 3 adverse events (Table 4). No grade 4 events were 
reported. The most common adverse event was an erlotinib-induced acneiform-like rash, 
which occurred in 87% of the treatment group (n = 40) and 20% of the placebo group (n = 
9) (P < .001). The rash was managed with topical cortisone and/or clindamycin therapy. 
Additional adverse events commonly increased in the treatment group included oral 
mucositis (39.1%; n = 18), diarrhea (26%; n = 12), and nausea (23.9%; n = 11). More 
individuals in the treatment group (46%; n = 21) vs placebo group (13%; n = 6) experienced 
grade 2 or 3 adverse events. Nineteen participants (10 taking placebo and 9 taking treatment) 
withdrew from the study; 5 due to early study halt, 5 due to drug-induced adverse effects or 
possible allergic reaction, 3 due to unrelated health reasons, 3 were lost to follow-up, 1 was 
noncompliant, and 2 for pregnancy beginning during study course (both of whom were 
taking placebo).
Of those who completed the study, 28% of participants taking placebo and 73% of 
participants taking treatment had erlotinib-dose reduction. Twenty-eight percent of patients 
taking placebo and 54% of patients taking treatment had sulindac-dose reduction at some 
point during the study. Erlotinib-dose reductions included 16 cases of grade 1 and 2 rash,

 which were found to be intolerable by the participant. In addition, there were 11 patients for 
whom study drugs were temporarily discontinued due to concern for gastrointestinal 
bleeding (n = 6), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (n = 1), elevated blood pressure (n 
= 1), ocular pain or change in vision (n = 2), and tonsillitis (n = 1). Three participants had 
their erlotinib dose reduced to 50 mg per day, 13 participants had a reduction to 25 mg per 
day, and 11 participants had a temporary discontinuation of both study drugs. When 
symptoms improved, erlotinib and sulindac were reescalated as tolerated. Only 4 
participants had their erlotinib dose fully reescalated to 75 mg per day, 7 participants ended 
at 50 mg per day, 16 participants ended at 25 mg per day. The median administered dose of 
sulindac was 287.4 mg/d (range, 131.7–300.0) and erlotinib was 48.7 mg/d (range, 23.3–
75.0). There was no correlation between total drug consumed and response, indicating that 
the study was conducted within the range of efficacy, even when participants reduced their 
dose.
Discussion
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, sulindac in combination with 
erlotinib effectively reduced the total duodenal polyp burden and polyp number in 
participants with FAP compared with placebo. This effect was significant after 6 months of 
therapy and was observed in both classic and attenuated FAP participants.
Several investigators have described regression of colorectal adenomatous polyps in patients 
with FAP who received sulindac alone; however, sulindac has not been effective in reducing 
duodenal polyposis.5,6
Preclinical data suggested a beneficial role for EGFR inhibition in FAP. These studies 
showed a greater than 85% decrease in the progression of intestinal microadenomas through 
genetic or biochemical inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in the ApcMin/+ mouse 
model of FAP.15,16 ApcMin/+ mice form predominantly small intestinal adenomas, 
suggesting potential efficacy of EGFR inhibition in the duodenum. EGFR inhibitors are 
successfully used in the current treatment of non–small cell lung cancer lacking oncogenic 
KRAS mutation.17–19 Although KRAS mutations are frequent in colorectal tumors, they are 
infrequent in aberrant crypt foci in patients with FAP,17–19 suggesting that EGFR inhibitors 
might be more active in early vs late intestinal neoplasms in patients with FAP. Our trial 
suggests the effects of COX and EGFR inhibition observed in the murine models may be 
observed in the small intestine of patients with FAP as well.
Mortality from colorectal cancer in FAP has been markedly reduced by colorectal 
surveillance with colonoscopy and prophylactic colectomy, whereas the increased risk of 
duodenal adenocarcinoma remains.20–22 For patients with advanced neoplasia of the 
duodenum, surgical therapy has been the standard of care. However, duodenectomy and 
Whipple procedure are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and surgical or 
endoscopic polypectomy results in a high rate of recurrent polyps.23,24 Our study suggests 
the possibility of an effective chemoprevention strategy for duodenal neoplasia in patients 
with FAP and supports the need for future longer-term studies to establish clinically 
meaningful outcomes.

 There was a high rate of grade 1 and grade 2 adverse events in our study, the most notable 
were an acneiform rash in 87% of participants and oral mucositis in 39% of participants in 
the treatment group. Although the dosing of sulindac was based on prior chemoprevention 
studies,5,6 the dosing of erlotinib was estimated from cancer treatment and lung cancer 
chemotherapy trials.25,26 Dose-ranging studies will be needed to determine if lower and/or 
less-frequent dosing of erlotinib could diminish these adverse effects, but retain efficacy. 
Though all participants started the trial taking fixed standard doses of the 2 study 
medications, dose modifications due to intolerance led to a range of doses. We found equal 
efficacy in causing polyp regression across the resulting range of erlotinib doses used. The 
incomplete efficacy of sulindac and erlotinib in some participants necessitates continued 
endoscopic surveillance and surgery for advanced duodenal neoplasia at the dosing levels 
and duration of our study.
Limitations to this study should be noted. First, because the study measured polyp 
regression, it is unknown if sulindac and erlotinib would be effective in preventing the 
emergence of new duodenal adenomas. This issue arose in a pediatric FAP trial that 
suggested sulindac may be ineffective in preventing the emergence of colonic adenomas in 
children with FAP.27 Second, without long-term follow-up data, the durability of the effect 
of sulindac and erlotinib, the potential to develop resistance to either drug, and whether 
patients ultimately undergo fewer surveillance endoscopies/surgery or develop fewer cancers 
are unknown. Studies in Apcmin/+ mice have suggested long-term use of sulindac resulted in 
an eventual loss of efficacy28,29 and breakthrough cancers in humans have been reported, 
raising concern about its ability to reduce malignant transformation.30,31 Third, both 
sulindac and erlotinib can be associated with rare and serious adverse effects such as 
cardiotoxicity32 and interstitial lung disease,33,34 respectively, though no such effects were 
encountered in our study. Fourth, our study did not randomize according to Spigelman 
classification, because polyps were not removed for histologic analysis unless it was 
medically indicated; however, the preventive effect was seen in participants stratified by high 
or low duodenal polyp burdens. Fifth, this cohort was not sufficient in size to study the 
effects of erlotinib or sulindac alone, and the potential of synergistic activity led to the 
testing of the combination instead. Sixth, studies that are terminated early for efficacy may 
overestimate the true effect size. These issues emphasize the need for further research, 
including more definitive clinical chemoprevention trials in FAP to investigate resistance, 
long-term, clinically meaningful end points, dose-ranging, and need for continuous or cyclic 
therapy.
Conclusions
Among participants with FAP, the use of sulindac and erlotinib compared with placebo 
resulted in a lower duodenal polyp burden after 6 months. However, the frequency of 
adverse events may limit the use of these medications at the doses used in this study. Further 
research is necessary to evaluate these preliminary findings in a larger study population with 
longer follow-up to determine whether the observed effects will result in improved clinical 
outcomes.

 Figure 2. Per-Protocol Analysis of Change in Total Sum of Diameters of Duodenal Polyps for 
Each Participant Taking Sulindac-Erlotinib vs Those Taking Placebo
Each participant is represented by a vertical bar starting at their baseline polyp burden and 
running to the 6-month polyp burden. The length of the vertical bar portrays the magnitude 
of change. The participants are ordered by baseline polyp burden. One participant not 
included in this Figure was described as “carpeted” with small polyps throughout the 
duodenum.
Polyp burden at baseline was estimated as 700 mm. Endoscopy at the 6-month time point 
indicated no change for this participant. Circles indicate baseline data; data for some 
individuals were unchanged at 6 months (circles alone).

aChange is calculated individually for each participant (6-month polyp burden minus baseline polyp burden and the associated percentage of change). The median change within treatment and placebo 
groups represents the 50th percentile of these calculated changes.
bThe median of the differences does not necessarily equal the difference between the medians.
cHodges-Lehmann estimates of net difference and the associated percentage of change reflect the difference in the group change from 6 months to baseline. These estimates were calculated for each sample. 
Percentile bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated for the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.
dClassic FAP was defined as presentation with more than 100 colonic adenomas and either (1) multiple family members with a classic FAP phenotype or (2) an adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation 
in a region of the gene known to correlate with classic FAP, or (3) both.
eAttenuated FAP was defined as the presence of a mutation in a portion of the APC gene known to correlate with attenuated FAP and presentation of a milder phenotype in terms polyp density in the 
participant and the family. All participants with attenuated FAP had a confirmed mutation in the APC gene.
fHigh polyp burden was defined as baseline total sum of diameters is greater than the median of 21 mm.
gLow polyp burden was defined as baseline total sum of diameters is less than or equal to the median of 21 mm.
hGenetic diagnosis was defined as participants identified with a pathologic mutation of the APC gene. Data presented are that for polyp burden.

aChange is calculated individually for each participant (6-month polyp burden minus baseline polyp burden). The median change within treatment and placebo groups represents the 50th percentile of these 
calculated changes.
bThe median of the differences does not necessarily equal the difference between the medians.
cHodges-Lehmann estimates of net difference reflect the difference in the group change from 6 months to baseline. These estimates were calculated for each sample. Percentile bootstrap confidence 
intervals were calculated for the Hodges-Lehmann estimator.
dClassic FAP was defined as presentation with more than 100 colonic adenomas and either (1) multiple family members with a classic FAP phenotype or (2) an adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation 
in a region of the gene known to correlate with classic FAP, or (3) both.
eAttenuated FAP was defined as presence of a mutation in a portion of the APC gene known to correlate with attenuated FAP and presentation of a milder phenotype in terms polyp density in the participant 
and the family. All participants with attenuated FAP had a confirmed mutation in the APC gene.
fGenetic diagnosis was defined as identification of a pathologic mutation of the APC gene.
