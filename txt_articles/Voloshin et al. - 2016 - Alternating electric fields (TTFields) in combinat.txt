Long-term survival rates for advanced ovarian cancer patients have not changed appreciably over the past four decades; there-
fore, development of new, effective treatment modalities remains a high priority. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), a clinically
active anticancer modality utilize low-intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields. The goal of this study was
to evaluate the efficacy of combining TTFields with paclitaxel against ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro applica-
tion of TTFields on human ovarian cancer cell lines led to a significant reduction in cell counts as compared to untreated cells.
The effect was found to be frequency and intensity dependent. Further reduction in the number of viable cells was achieved
when TTFields treatment was combined with paclitaxel. The in vivo effect of the combined treatment was tested in mice ortho-
topically implanted with MOSE-LTICv cells. In this model, combined treatment led to a significant reduction in tumor lumines-
cence and in tumor weight as compared to untreated mice. The feasibility of effective local delivery of TTFields to the human
abdomen was examined using finite element mesh simulations performed using the Sim4life software. These simulations dem-
onstrated that electric fields intensities inside and in the vicinity of the ovaries of a realistic human computational phantom
are about 1 and 2 V/cm pk-pk, respectively, which is within the range of intensities required for TTFields effect. These results
suggest that prospective clinical investigation of the combination of TTFields and paclitaxel is warranted.
Ovarian cancer continues to be the leading cause of death
among all gynecological malignancies and is the fourth cause
of death in women in Western countries.1 Most ovarian
tumors originate from the surface epithelium lining the ova-
ries or the fallopian tubes and are usually diagnosed in the
advanced Stage III or IV of the disease (accounting for 75%
of all ovarian cancer cases).2 The lack of obvious symptoms
in early stages, when the tumor is localized to the ovary,
decreases the likelihood of early detection and, thus, the
probability of successful treatment. The standard of care for
epithelial ovarian cancer consists of surgical debulking and
combination chemotherapy with platinum and taxane (usual-
ly paclitaxel) chemotherapy agents.2 Although primary treat-
ment is generally characterized by a high response rate, the
disease reoccurs in nearly 70% of the patients.3 Second-line
treatment offers only modest improvement in survival, thus
rendering the reported 5-year relative survival rate at 27.4%
for patients with metastatic disease.4,5 Current efforts are
focused on developing novel strategies that can enhance
treatment efficacy and prevent disease recurrence. Most
attempted treatment strategies, however, did not show a sur-
vival
advantage,
while
some
showed

in
progression-free survival (PFS) without improving overall
survival (OS).2,5–7 The limited effectiveness of front-line and
maintenance therapy drives a search for new strategies that

 PFS and OS. Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are a clinically
active anticancer modality delivered via continuous noninva-
sive
application
of
low-intensity,
intermediate-frequency,
alternating electric fields to the region of a tumor.8 TTFields
are delivered through two sets of transducer arrays so that
they generate two electric fields oriented perpendicular to
one another, within the patient’s body.8 Previous studies have
demonstrated
the
effectiveness
of
TTFields
application
against various cancerous cell lines and animal tumor mod-
els.8–12 Several pilot clinical trials and larger randomized
studies in patients with solid tumors including glioblastoma
and non-small cell lung cancer, have demonstrated the safety
as well as effectiveness of continuous TTFields application in
patients.13,14 Previous studies provide evidence on the direct
effect of TTFields on spindle assembly in replicating cells.
Specifically, TTFields were shown to destabilize microtubules
consequently
leading
to
spindle
disruption
and
mitotic
catastrophe.15
Paclitaxel chemotherapy constitutes one of the major com-
ponents in the backbone for the initial therapy of ovarian can-
cer. Conventional first-line chemotherapy for patients with
optimally, as well as sub-optimally debulked disease, consists of
combination chemotherapy with platinum agent (carboplatin
or cisplatin) plus paclitaxel, administered as described in the
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols 158 and 111.16
Paclitaxel is also administered as standard second-line treat-
ment for patients who developed platinum resistance. Here, we
investigated the effects of TTFields in combination with pacli-
taxel on ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo. A realistic
human abdomen computational phantom was utilized in order
to verify whether clinically TTFields of sufficient intensity can
be delivered within the abdomen for potential therapeutic use
in ovarian cancer patients.
Material and Methods
Cell culture and drugs
The human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 was obtained
from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. The human
ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 (HTB-161) and
Caov-3 (HTB-75) were obtained from the American Type
Culture
Collection
(ATCC).
Spontaneously
transformed
mouse ovarian surface epithelium (MOSE) were developed
from C57BL/6 mice and characterized previously.17 MOSE
cells were transduced with firefly luciferase lentiviral particles
(GeneCopoeia) (MOSE-LTICv) to facilitate live in vivo imag-
ing of tumor outgrowth. Paclitaxel (Sigma Aldrich, Rehovot,
Israel) stock solution was prepared in DMSO and diluted in
cell culture media immediately prior to use so that final
DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.1%.
TTFields application in vitro
TTFields were applied for 72 hrs using the inovitro system
(Novocure, Israel) as previously described.8,11
Cell count and cell volume
Inhibition of cell growth was analyzed by quantitatively deter-
mining cell count using a Scepter 2.0 automated cell counter
(EMD Millipore). Cell volume measurements were also collect-
ed. The relative number of cells at the end of treatment was
expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells. The com-
bination index (CI) for quantification of the interaction
between TTFields and paclitaxel was calculated as described18
with a correction to the sigmoidal shape of the A2780 response
curve to the drug.
Flow cytometry
For detection of apoptosis, cells were double-stained with
FITC-conjugated Annexin V (MEBCYTO 4700 Apoptosis Kit;
MBL) and 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; BioLegend) as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Data acquisition was obtained
using iCyt EC800 (Sony Biotechnology) flow cytometer. For
cell cycle analysis, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed
with 70% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min. After fixation, cells were
pelleted and incubated in PBS containing 10 lg/ml RNase and
7.5 lg/ml 7-AAD (Sigma-Aldrich) at 378C for 30 min. Cell
cycle distribution was then quantified using iCyt EC800. Fluo-
rescence signals were collected at the wavelengths of 525/
50 nm for Annexin V and 665/30 nm for 7-AAD. The data was
analyzed using the Flowjo software (TreeStar).
Microscopy
For mitotic figures analysis, cells were grown on glass cover
slips and treated using the inovitro system for 72 hrs. At the
end of the experiment, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol
for 10 min. The cells were then serum-blocked, and stained
with rabbit anti-human a-tubulin antibodies (Abcam) for 2
hrs. Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody was used
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). DNA was stained with the dye
What’s new?
Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), in which tumor cell division is disrupted by exposure to alternating electric fields, are a prom-
ising therapeutic strategy against cancer. In this study, TTFields are shown to enhance the efficacy of paclitaxel in ovarian
cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. The feasibility of effectively delivering TTFields across a large nonuniform volume, encom-
passing ovaries and potential metastatic sites, is demonstrated via electric field measurements in mice and through finite-
element mesh simulations. The results have given impetus to an open-label pilot investigation of TTFields administered in
combination with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.2
mg/ml for 20 min. Images were collected using a LSM 700 laser
scanning confocal system, attached to an upright motorized
microscope with 320 and 363/1.40 oil objective (ZeissAxio
Imager Z2).
Efficacy of the combination therapy in animal models
All animal studies were approved by the Novocure Internal
Animal Care Committee in accordance with the Technion-
Israel Institute of Technology guidelines for the care of labo-
ratory animals. Female C57Bl/6 mice, 10–12-weeks of age
(Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), were injected (5 ml)
directly into the ovarian bursa with MOSE cells transfected
with the luc gene (MOSE-LTICv) (1 3 103 cells), suspended
in high concentration growth factor reduced matrigel (1:1
volume, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Treatment was initi-
ated 2 days after the tumor luminescence intensity was deter-
mined to be within the range of 200–5,000 photons per
second per steradian (p/s/sr) for the whole mouse or per sig-
nal area (cm2). Mice received a single IP injection of paclitax-
el (20 mg/kg body weight). Mice that did not receive
chemotherapy, received an IP injection of Saline solution
with DMSO (vehicle control). Application of TTFields began
immediately after paclitaxel injection and was maintained for
7 days. For the application of TTFields, a set of four insulat-
ed transducers was placed around the mouse abdomen so as
to generate fields in perpendicular directions. Control mice
were treated by means of sham heat transducers. The trans-
ducers were connected to the NovoTTF-100A device or the
sham device. At the end of treatment, transducers were
removed and the tumor luminescence was determined as
described. After the luminescence measurements, mice were
euthanized and the tumors were removed. The total tumor
weight was determined using analytical scales.
Tumor imaging
At different time points after tumor cells injection, mice were
anesthetized and injected with luciferin to a final concentra-
tion of 150 mg/kg body weight. Mice were placed inside the
Biospace photon imager equipped with a highly sensitive,
cooled charge coupled device camera mounted in a light-
tight specimen box (Biospace Lab, France), and monitored
for 10 min for a bioluminescent reaction. Identical illumina-
tion settings were used for all images. Luminescence emission
from the bioluminescent cells was normalized to p/sec/sr for
the whole mouse or per signal area (cm2).
Finite element mesh simulations
The finite element method (FEM) is a commonly used tech-
nique for calculating the electric field distribution in complex
geometries such as the human body.19 To calculate the distri-
bution of TTFields in the abdomen, FEM simulations were
performed using the Sim4Life 1.2 Software package (ZMT,
Zurich, Switzerland). The Ella computational phantom of a
healthy 26-year-old female was used for the simulations. The
permittivity and conductivity of all tissues other than skin
and fat were assigned to the phantom based on the Gabriel
Model,20 which is built into the software material database.
In order to match the total resistance of the model to the
typical resistance measured in patients, the conductivity val-
ues for skin and fat were set manually to 0.02 S/m (instead
of 0.0007 for dry skin) and 0.08 S/m (instead of 0.024),
respectively. These values are at the higher range of conduc-
tivity reported for these tissue types.21,22 To “generate”
TTFields within the phantom, transducer arrays were placed
on the phantoms body, and Derichlet boundary conditions of
a 200 V pk-pk voltage difference were set between the two
arrays. The low frequency quasistatic electric field solver of
the software package was used to perform the simulations.
To simulate a possible treatment protocol, two pairs of trans-
ducer arrays were placed on the phantom body. One pair of
arrays was placed on the abdomen and the back of the phan-
tom, and the other pair of arrays was placed on the left and
right sides of the body. Both pairs of arrays were placed just
above the pelvic bone. The electric field distribution generat-
ed by each pair was calculated separately for each voxel. The
maximal field intensity at each voxel was used for all the
calculations.
Statistical analysis
Unless stated otherwise, data are expressed as mean 6 SE.
Multiple comparisons were analyzed by a one way ANOVA,
and differences in the mean values among groups were con-
ducted by a Dunnett post-hoc correction. All experiments
were repeated at least three times.
Results and Discussion
TTFields induce frequency and intensity dependent
reduction in viability of human ovarian cancer cells in vitro
The inhibitory effect of TTFields on ovarian cancer cell
growth in vitro was investigated using three human ovarian
cancer cell lines (A2780, OVCAR3, and Caov-3). Our previ-
ous observations suggest a cell type–specific optimal effective
frequency for TTFields therapy.9,10 Therefore, for in vitro
studies, TTFields (4.6 V/cm pk-pk) were applied at the fre-
quency range of 100 to 400 kHz. Frequency titration curves
demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields were
maximal at 200 kHz for all tested ovarian cancer cell lines
(Figs. 1a–1c). Application of 200 kHz TTFields for 72 hrs
resulted in a 77, 70 and 75% reduction in the cell count of
A2780
(p < 0.001),
OVCAR3
(p < 0.001),
and
Caov-3
(p < 0.001) cells, respectively, compared to the control. It had
been previously suggested that the cell volume is a decisive
feature in determining the optimal TTFields frequency.11
This hypothesis was based on the assumption that membrane
and cytoplasm permittivity and resistivity are similar between
various cell lines. However, our results show that while the
optimal frequency was identical for all three cell lines tested,
significant differences were observed in their cell volume
(A2780:2.51pL; OVCAR3: 5.4 pL; Caov-3: 4.25 pL). This

 indicates that other parameters, such as cell specific mem-
brane electrical properties or plasma contents, could influence
the optimal frequency to a greater extent than the cell vol-
ume. The relationship between TTFields intensity at 200 kHz
and cell counts was also evaluated. In all cell lines, treatment
efficacy was a function of electric fields intensity (Figs. 1d–
1f). Significant reduction in cell counts were observed already
at 1.53 V/cm [A2780 (p < 0.05), OVCAR3 (p < 0.001), and
Caov-3 (p < 0.05)].
Combination of TTFields and paclitaxel chemotherapy
enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in treatment
of ovarian cancer cells in vitro
To assess whether adding TTFields to paclitaxel affects the
responsiveness of ovarian carcinoma cells, we treated the cells
with paclitaxel alone and in combination with TTFields (2.7 V/
cm pk-pk, 200 kHz) for 72 hrs. Dose-response curves demon-
strate that combining TTFields with paclitaxel enhances treat-
ment efficacy in all tested cell lines, as expressed by a shift to
the left of the combined treatment dose curve (Figs. 2a–2c).
Specifically, the combination indexes (CI) were 1.03 (A2780),
0.81 (OVCAR-3) and 0.86 (Caov-3), indicating additive effect
in A2780 cells and synergism of the two regimens in OVCAR-
3 and Caov-3 cell lines. We next investigated whether TTFields
application increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Consistent
with the cell growth inhibition, TTFields significantly increased
apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in a concentration dependent
manner (Figs. 2d–2f). These preclinical data are in line with
prior studies which demonstrated efficacy benefits for the com-
bination of TTFields and paclitaxel derivatives in other cancer
models including: breast, kidney, and non-small cell lung can-
cers.10,12 The enhanced effect of the combined treatment may
be attributed to the fact that TTFields and paclitaxel share
tubulin as their cellular target. Tubulin dimers are known to
have a very large electrical dipole.23 It was postulated that the
forces exerted by the electric fields on these dimers, interfere
with microtubule dynamics, thus leading to the disruption of
normal mitotic spindle assembly.8,11 Paclitaxel prevents nor-
mal formation of mitotic spindle by enhancing the affinity of
the interaction between individual tubulin dimers, subsequent-
ly increasing the fiber length of the spindle microtubules.24
This in turn, leads to an increase in the average fiber dipole
moment, which could potentially increase TTFields-induced
forces and sensitize cells to TTFields. As both TTFields and
paclitaxel exert their toxicity on mitotic cells that exhibit rapid
microtubule dynamics,15,25 we examined cell cycle progression
upon treatments. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that cells
exposed to paclitaxel were blocked in cell cycle progression
and accumulated in G2/M phase. Similar to the induction of
growth arrest and apoptosis, this accumulation in G2/M was
also dose dependent, confirming previous reports demonstrat-
ing that paclitaxel acts as a phase-specific agent.25,26 Cells
exposed to TTFields exhibited only a small increase in the
accumulation in G2/M phase. Importantly, 72 hrs simulta-
neous treatment with low dose of paclitaxel (2, 4 and 10 nM)
and TTFields, dramatically increased the number of Caov-3

 and OVCAR-3 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Figs.
3a–3d). A2780 cells exposed to the combination of low dose
paclitaxel and TTFields accumulated in G2/M even after short
treatment duration (8 hrs). After longer treatment duration
(72 hrs) G2/M accumulation was replaced by polyploid
appearance of cells in G1 (data not shown). To verify these
effects observed by flow cytometry, we examined the appear-
ance of mitotic figures following the different treatments using
confocal microscopy. In all tested cell lines, combination treat-
ment with TTFields and low dose paclitaxel displayed a sub-
stantial increase in mitotic figures, indicative of mitotic arrest
(Fig. 3e). Interestingly, while abnormal spindle formation and
improper attachment of chromosomes to the spindle fibers
were prevalent amongst cells treated with TTFields, as previ-
ously described,15 multipolar spindles were common in the
combined treatment. Taken together, these results provide fur-
ther evidence for the synergy between paclitaxel and TTFields
in the treatment of ovarian cancer cells. Clinical trials studying
combination of spindle poisons have already shown superior
antitumoral activity for combination treatments.27,28 It is pos-
sible that TTFields therapy concomitant with paclitaxel can be
an active therapeutic modality, provided that the overall toxici-
ty is tolerable. Concomitant TTFields therapy and paclitaxel
can complement paclitaxel dosing strategy in recurrent ovarian
cancer.29 More efficacious low toxicity, well tolerated weekly
low-dose paclitaxel regimens, could positively impact treat-
ment outcome.
Application of TTFields and paclitaxel enhances treatment
efficacy in murine model of ovarian cancer
Models that closely resemble human ovarian cancer were
developed by several groups utilizing similar methodologies.17
In this study, we used spontaneously transformed MOSE cells
transfected with the firefly luciferase gene (MOSE-LTICv) for
the establishment of a syngeneic ovarian cancer model in
mice.17 This model was used for testing the efficacy of the com-
bined treatment of TTFields and paclitaxel in vivo. For this
purpose, MOSE-LTICv cells were orthotopically implanted into
the ovarian bursa of female C57BL/6 mice. Treatment was ini-
tiated 2 days after the tumor luminescence intensity was deter-
mined to be within the range of 200–5,000 p/sec/sr, and
applied for 7 days (Fig. 4a). Tumor volume (expressed as lumi-
nescence intensity) (Fig. 4b) and tumor weight (Fig. 4c) were
compared to sham control tumors. Paclitaxel significantly
reduced the tumor volume (p < 0.05); while the tumor volume
in the TTFields-treated mice was lower than control mice, this

 was not statistically significant. However, the combination
treatment of paclitaxel and TTFields resulted in a significantly
lower tumor volume compared to the untreated controls
(p < 0.001), paclitaxel (p < 0.05) or TTFields (p < 0.05) treated
mice. Since ascites, common in patients with advanced disease,
could alter field distribution and intensity, in a separate experi-
ment, we also performed in vivo field measurements in the
ovaries of control mice that had saline infused IP to mimic
accumulation of ascitic fluid. These measurements demonstrat-
ed that IP injection of 1.5 ml saline to mice with an average
weight of 20 g (7.5% v/w; equivalent to ascitic fluid volume of
up to 3 l in human) led to a 14% reduction in the electric fields
intensities (Fig. 4d).
Simulations of distribution of TTFields intensity
inside and in the vicinity of ovaries
In locally advanced disease, ovarian cancer cells disseminate into
the peritoneal cavity and form cell clusters in the ascitic fluid. As
metastatic dissemination progresses, tumor cells encase the
reproductive organs and sigmoid colon. Other common sites for
distant metastatic dissemination are the omentum and peritone-
um.30 Therefore, we calculated TTFields intensities in the vicini-
ty of the ovaries to encompass possible dissemination sites. For
this purpose, we performed finite-element mesh (3-dimensional
mesh) simulations of TTFields electric field intensity and distri-
bution inside and in the vicinity of ovaries of a realistic human
computational phantom (array layouts used for simulation are
illustrated in Figs. 5a and 5b). The simulations demonstrated
effective distribution of fields in the abdomen at an average
intensity of 1.85 V/cm pk-pk, which according to our prior
measurements is expected to lead to an effective response (Fig.
5c). Specifically, 95% of the abdomen received field intensity
higher than 1.53 V/cm pk-pk, and about 60% received field
intensity higher than 2.55 V/cm pk-pk. TTFields intensities
were particularly high in the peritoneal interstitial fluid, allowing
for effective electric fields to be delivered to the ascitic fluid.
Organ specific TTFields intensities are summarized in Figure 5d.
While targeting potential metastatic sites should improve

 treatment outcome, other proliferating cells in the abdomen
(e.g., intestinal epithelial cells) can potentially be affected by
TTFields. The intestinal mucous membrane is subjected to spa-
tial relocation due to peristaltic movement of the intestine,
which can in turn reposition the intestinal epithelial cells from
the direction of the electric fields. As TTFields possess direction-
al specificity, such repositioning can spare intestinal epithelial
cells from being affected by the electric fields.8 Moreover,
although other proliferating cells in treated tissue are also subject
to forces exerted by the electric fields, given differences in opti-
mal frequencies, the probability for an effect on these cells is rel-
atively low. In summary, this study is the first preclinical
demonstration that combination of paclitaxel chemotherapy
with TTFields could provide a novel, potentially more effective
therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer compared with chemo-
therapy alone. Based on these results, an open-label, pilot study
of TTFields therapy concomitant with paclitaxel for recurrent
ovarian-carcinoma has been initiated.
