Abstract
BACKGROUND—A report from a high-volume single center indicated a survival benefit of 
receiving a kidney transplant from an HLA-incompatible live donor as compared with remaining 
on the waiting list, whether or not a kidney from a deceased donor was received. The 
generalizability of that finding is unclear.
METHODS—In a 22-center study, we estimated the survival benefit for 1025 recipients of kidney 
transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors who were matched with controls who remained on 
the waiting list or received a transplant from a deceased donor (waiting-list-or-transplant control 
group) and controls who remained on the waiting list but did not receive a transplant (waiting-list-
only control group). We analyzed the data with and without patients from the highest-volume 
center in the study.
RESULTS—Recipients of kidney transplants from incompatible live donors had a higher survival 
rate than either control group at 1 year (95.0%, vs. 94.0% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control 
group and 89.6% for the waiting-list-only control group), 3 years (91.7% vs. 83.6% and 72.7%, 
respectively), 5 years (86.0% vs. 74.4% and 59.2%), and 8 years (76.5% vs. 62.9% and 43.9%) 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons with the two control groups). The survival benefit was significant at 
8 years across all levels of donor-specific antibody: 89.2% for recipients of kidney transplants 
from incompatible live donors who had a positive Luminex assay for anti-HLA antibody but a 
negative flow-cytometric cross-match versus 65.0% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group 
and 47.1% for the waiting-list-only control group; 76.3% for recipients with a positive flow-
cytometric cross-match but a negative cytotoxic cross-match versus 63.3% and 43.0% in the two 
control groups, respectively; and 71.0% for recipients with a positive cytotoxic cross-match versus 
61.5% and 43.7%, respectively. The findings did not change when patients from the highest-
volume center were excluded.

 CONCLUSIONS—This multicenter study validated single-center evidence that patients who 
received kidney transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors had a substantial survival benefit 
as compared with patients who did not undergo transplantation and those who waited for 
transplants from deceased donors. (Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases.)
More than 32,000 patients awaiting kidney transplantation in the United States have anti-
HLA antibodies.1 The presence of anti-HLA antibodies makes it very difficult to find a 
match with a compatible donor, and these “sensitized” patients can remain on the waiting list 
for a kidney transplant for years without a suitable donor ever being identified.2,3 Those 
fortunate enough to have a willing but incompatible live donor can either participate in 
paired kidney donation, for which the chance of a compatible match is also limited,4–9 or 
undergo desensitization and subsequent transplantation with a kidney from an incompatible 
live donor.10–22
Several centers have reported that outcomes after transplantation with a kidney from an 
incompatible live donor were inferior to outcomes after transplantation with a kidney from a 
compatible live donor,11,23,24 and we recently confirmed those findings in a 22-center cohort 
study.25 Since HLA incompatibilities are not accounted for in case-mix–adjusted 
benchmarks, centers performing transplantations with kidneys from incompatible donors 
may be subjected to regulatory scrutiny and loss of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services certification. Given such pressures, many centers have avoided transplanting 
kidneys from incompatible live donors. However, for most sensitized patients, receiving a 
compatible kidney is not an option: their choice is to undergo desensitization or remain on 
the waiting list, which is associated with a high mortality rate. In other words, it may be in 
the best interest of the individual patient to receive a transplant from an incompatible donor, 
even though the success rate is lower for such transplants than for those from compatible 
donors.
Thus, it is critical to determine whether there is a survival benefit from undergoing 
desensitization and transplantation with a kidney from an incompatible live donor. Three of 
us previously reported a survival benefit for desensitization at a single large center (Johns 
Hopkins University).19 However, at this center, a very high volume of transplantations with 
kidneys from incompatible live donors are performed, and it was unclear whether our results 
were generalizable. To quantify the effect of transplantation with kidneys from incompatible 
live donors on survival among patients at transplantation centers across the United States, we 
compared recipients of such transplants in a multicenter cohort with carefully matched 
controls who remained on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.

STUDY POPULATION AND DEFINITIONS
The study population consisted of adults (≥18 years of age) who underwent kidney-only 
transplantation with transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors performed at 22 
transplantation centers in the United States between 1997 and 2011 (for the list of centers, 
see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org), as well as matched controls drawn from the Scientific Registry of Transplant 
Recipients (SRTR). The SRTR data system includes data on all donors, wait-listed 
candidates for transplants, and transplant recipients in the United States, submitted by the 
members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The Health 
Resources and Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, 
provides oversight of the activities of the OPTN and SRTR contractors. Some of the data 
reported here have been supplied by the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation 
(MMRF) as the contractor for the SRTR.
Recipients of kidney transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors were defined as those 
undergoing perioperative desensitization therapy for donor-specific antibodies detected 
before transplantation, as previously defined.25 Briefly, each participating transplantation 
center classified the donor-specific antibody level as low, moderate, or high before 
administering the desensitization protocol of the center’s own choosing. A positive Luminex 
assay (a sensitive assay for donor-specific anti-HLA antibody) with a negative flow-
cytometric cross-match indicated a low donor-specific antibody level, a positive flow-
cytometric assay with a negative cytotoxic cross-match indicated a moderate antibody level, 
and a positive cytotoxic cross-match indicated a high antibody level (Table 1). Patients with 
anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies who were also ABO-incompatible (5.8% of the cohort) 
were included and categorized on the basis of their anti-HLA donor-specific antibody level, 
in light of the minimal risk associated with crossing ABO barriers.26,27
DATA LINKAGE
Data provided by the participating transplantation centers were linked to the SRTR for 
ascertainment of additional patient and donor characteristics and for reliable ascertainment 
of deaths. The SRTR supplements death ascertainment through linkage to Medicare data and 
the Social Security Death Master File.
WAIT-LISTED MATCHED CONTROLS
Two sets of matched controls were drawn from the SRTR waiting list. The first group 
consisted of wait-listed patients, some of whom subsequently received a transplant from a 
deceased donor (waiting-list-or-transplant control group). The second group consisted of 
wait-listed patients who never underwent kidney transplantation (waiting-list-only control 
group). Controls in the waiting-list-or-transplant group were drawn from a pool of 349,844 
unique patients, and controls in the waiting-list-only group were drawn from a pool of 
200,769 unique patients. The waiting-list-or-transplant group was selected to compare

 transplantation with a kidney from an incompatible live donor with the next best real-world 
treatment option (i.e., continuing to be wait-listed for a transplant). The waiting-list-only 
group was selected to quantify the possible survival benefit associated with transplantation 
of a kidney from an incompatible live donor.
For each recipient of a kidney from an incompatible live donor, five matched controls were 
drawn from the waiting-list-or-transplant group, and five were drawn from the waiting-list-
only group. Matching was performed with the use of an iterative, expanding-radius matching 
algorithm, as previously described19,28–32 (for details, see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). For panel-reactive antibody matching, peak values were 
determined, with the use of calculated panel-reactive antibody when available. Among 
recipients of kidneys from incompatible live donors, those with a panel-reactive antibody 
level of 100% were matched only to controls with an antibody level of 100%, and those with 
an antibody level of 98 to 99% or 95 to 97% were matched to controls with antibody levels 
in the same range. Recipients with a panel-reactive antibody level of 85 to 94% were 
matched to controls with a panel-reactive antibody level in the same range plus or minus 2 
percentage points, those with an antibody level of 65 to 84% were matched to controls with 
a level in the same range plus or minus 5 percentage points, and those with an antibody level 
of 1 to 64% were matched to controls with a level in the same range plus or minus 10 
percentage points but higher than 0%. Recipients with a panel-reactive antibody level of 0% 
were matched to controls with a level of exactly 0%.
Patients who had not received renal-replacement therapy before undergoing transplantation 
with a kidney from an incompatible live donor were matched to eligible controls who had 
received renal-replacement therapy for 3 months or less. Patients who had received renal-
replacement therapy for any length of time before undergoing transplantation with a kidney 
from an incompatible live donor were matched to controls receiving renal-replacement 
therapy within a radius of 1 year but were not matched to controls who had not received any 
renal-replacement therapy. Recipients of kidneys from incompatible live donors were 
matched exactly to controls for age, blood group, number of previous kidney 
transplantations, race, sex, and diabetes status; they were also matched for the percentage of 
time with a functioning kidney transplant during renal-replacement therapy (plus or minus 
10 percentage points) and for the transplantation date, which was matched to the date of 
placement on the waiting list (within 30 days).
In the event that a sufficient number of controls could not be found for a given transplant 
recipient with the use of the strict criteria described above, we relaxed the criteria as follows, 
and in the following order, until five matches were found: by expanding the allowable age 
difference 1 year at a time for up to 5 years; ignoring blood-group differences; expanding the 
allowable difference in the number of previous kidney transplantations one at a time until it 
was necessary to ignore any differences; further expanding the allowable age difference 1 
year at a time up to 10 years; expanding the allowable difference in the percentage of time 
receiving renal-replacement therapy with a functioning kidney transplant 5% at a time up to 
60%; further expanding the allowable age difference 1 year at a time for up to 15 years; 
expanding the allowable difference in the duration of renal-replacement therapy 1 year at a 
time for up to 4 years; further expanding the allowable age difference 1 year at a time for up

 to 35 years; further expanding the duration of renal-replacement therapy 1 year at a time for 
up to 10 years; ignoring differences in race, sex, and then diabetes status; and expanding the 
allowable difference between the transplantation date and the date of placement on the 
waiting list for controls 1 month at a time for up to 60 months. Every time the secular-
difference radius was expanded, all other radii were reset to their initial (restrictive) settings, 
and matches were sought with the new secular-difference radius.
MISSING DATA
In the case of missing data on panel-reactive antibody levels for recipients of transplants 
from incompatible live donors (accounting for 6.7% of all such recipients), we used the 
mean panel-reactive antibody level for each level of donor-specific antibody among 
recipients for whom such data were available. All other variables were missing in less than 
1% of the recipients of transplants from incompatible live donors. Controls with missing 
data on any matching variables were excluded.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used Pearson’s chi-square test to compare categorical variables between groups, and we 
used the Somers D rank statistic test for comparisons of continuous variables to account for 
clustering.33–35 Mortality was estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method and was 
compared between groups by means of Cox modeling with shared frailty, a modeling 
method that accounted for the clustering of the matched controls to the recipients of 
transplants from incompatible live donors.36 Comparisons with the matched controls were 
performed separately for each control group. A two-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was 
considered to indicate statistical significance. Administrative censoring of data was 
performed for patients who were alive at the end of the study (March 2014). Given that 
patients at the highest-volume center (Johns Hopkins University) accounted for 25.8% of the 
cohort, a sensitivity analysis was performed in which data from this center were excluded. 
Statistical analysis was performed with the use of Stata software, version 13.0 (StataCorp).
RESULTS
RECIPIENTS OF TRANSPLANTS FROM INCOMPATIBLE LIVE DONORS
We enrolled 1025 patients at 22 centers who received kidney transplants from incompatible 
live donors: 185 with a positive Luminex assay but a negative flow-cytometric cross-match, 
536 with a positive flow-cytometric cross-match but a negative cytotoxic cross-match, and 
304 with a positive cytotoxic cross-match (Table 2). The mean age was 45.4, 45.5, and 43.8 
years among recipients with a positive Luminex assay, those with a positive flow-cytometric 
cross-match, and those with a positive cytotoxic cross-match, respectively. The majority of 
patients were women (125 [67.6%], 365 [68.1%], and 197 [64.8%] in the three subgroups, 
respectively), 413 (40.3%) had previously received a kidney transplant (60 [32.4%], 204 
[38.1%], and 149 [49.0%] in the three subgroups), and 168 (16.4%) were black (32 [17.3%], 
100 [18.7%], and 36 [11.8%] in the three subgroups). The median percentage of panel-
reactive antibody was 51.0% among recipients with a positive Luminex assay, 57.5% among 
those with a positive flow-cytometric cross-match, and 85.0% among those with a positive

 cytotoxic cross-match, and the mean duration of renal-replacement therapy was 5.6, 6.9, and 
9.0 years, respectively.
MATCHED CONTROLS
The mean age of the overall group of patients who received kidney transplants from 
incompatible live donors was 45.0 years, as compared with 45.9 years in the group of 
matched controls who remained on the waiting list or received a transplant from a deceased 
donor (P = 0.07) and 46.6 years in the group of matched controls who remained on the 
waiting list and never underwent kidney transplantation; the difference in mean age between 
the recipients of transplants from incompatible live donors and the waiting-list-only control 
group, although clinically negligible, was significant (P=0.001) (Table 3). Recipients of 
transplants from incompatible live donors had a history of slightly more kidney transplants 
than the waiting-list-or-transplant control group (P = 0.004) or the waiting-list-only control 
group (P = 0.02). There were no significant between-group differences in sex, black race, 
percentage of panel-reactive antibody, diabetes status, or mean number of years of renal-
replacement therapy. In the waiting-list-or-transplant control group, 2326 controls (45.4%) 
ultimately received a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. The mean (±SD) follow-up 
time for these patients was 7.3±2.8 years from the time of matching and 5.0±3.0 years from 
the time of transplantation. Among patients in the waiting-list-or-transplant control group 
who did not receive a transplant, the follow-up time was 4.8±3.0 years from the time of 
matching.
SURVIVAL
Recipients of kidney transplants from incompatible live donors had a significant survival 
benefit as compared with the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and the waiting-list-
only control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig. 1). The survival rate was higher for 
recipients of transplants from incompatible live donors at 1 year (95.0%, vs. 94.0% for the 
waiting-list-or-transplant control group and 89.6% for the waiting-list-only control group), 3 
years (91.7% vs. 83.6% and 72.7%, respectively), 5 years (86.0% vs. 74.4% and 59.2%), 
and 8 years (76.5% vs. 62.9% and 43.9%) (Table 4). In other words, receiving a kidney from 
an incompatible live donor was associated with an absolute increase of 13.6 percentage 
points in the survival rate at 8 years, as compared with remaining on the waiting list or 
receiving a transplant from a deceased donor (risk of death reduced by a factor of 1.83; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.58 to 2.12; P<0.001) and an absolute increase of 32.6 percentage 
points, as compared with remaining on the waiting list and not receiving a transplant from a 
deceased donor (risk reduced by a factor of 3.37; 95% CI, 2.92 to 3.90; P<0.001).
SURVIVAL BENEFIT AND CROSS-MATCH STRENGTH
Receipt of a kidney transplant from an incompatible live donor was associated with a 
survival benefit at all donor-specific antibody levels. Recipients with a positive Luminex 
assay but a negative flow-cytometric cross-match (185 recipients, or 18.0% of the cohort) 
had higher survival rates than either group of controls at 1 year (98.4%, vs. 94.0% for the 
waiting-list-or-transplant group and 90.6% for the waiting-list-only group), 3 years (95.1% 
vs. 85.2% and 76.3%, respectively), 5 years (91.2% vs. 74.6% and 61.9%), and 8 years 
(89.2% vs. 65.0% and 47.1%) (P<0.001 for the overall comparison of survival between the

 group that received transplants from incompatible live donors and each of the control 
groups) (Fig. 2A). The survival rate for the transplant recipients with a positive Luminex 
assay exceeded the rate for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group beginning at 1 month, 
and the survival curves never crossed for the comparison between the transplants recipients 
with a positive Luminex assay and the waiting-list-only control group. At 8 years, the 
survival rate for transplant recipients with a positive Luminex assay but a negative flow-
cytometric cross-match was increased by 24.2 percentage points as compared with the rate 
for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group (risk of death reduced by a factor of 3.49; 
95% CI, 2.13 to 5.70; P<0.001) and was increased by 42.1 percentage points as compared 
with the rate in the waiting-list-only control group (risk reduced by a factor of 6.48; 95% CI, 
3.98 to 10.56; P<0.001).
Transplant recipients with a positive flow-cytometric cross-match but a negative cytotoxic 
cross-match (536 recipients, or 52.3% of the cohort) had higher survival rates at 1 year 
(96.1%, vs. 94.5% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and 89.7% for the waiting-
list-only control group), 3 years (93.3% vs. 83.8% and 72.1%, respectively), 5 years (87.1% 
vs. 74.9% and 58.4%), and 8 years (76.3% vs. 63.3% and 43.0%) (P<0.001 for the overall 
comparison of survival between the group that received transplants from incompatible live 
donors and each of the control groups) (Fig. 2B). The survival rate for this group of 
transplant recipients exceeded the rates in the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and the 
waiting-list-only control group beginning at 2.2 months and 0.02 months, respectively. At 8 
years, the survival rate among transplant recipients with a positive flow-cytometric cross-
match but a negative cytotoxic cross-match was increased by 13.0 percentage points as 
compared with the rate in the waiting-list-or-transplant control group (risk of death reduced 
by a factor of 1.89; 95% CI, 1.54 to 2.33; P<0.001) and was increased by 33.3 percentage 
points as compared with the rate in the waiting-list-only control group (risk reduced by a 
factor of 3.56; 95% CI, 2.90 to 4.36; P<0.001).
Transplant recipients with a positive cytotoxic cross-match (304 recipients, or 29.7% of the 
cohort) had a survival rate at 1 year that was similar to the rates in the waiting-list-or-
transplant and waiting-list-only control groups (91.1%, 93.0%, and 88.9% in the three 
groups, respectively) but had higher survival rates at 3 years (86.8%, vs. 82.2% and 71.8% in 
the two control groups, respectively), 5 years (80.9% vs. 73.2% and 58.8%), and 8 years 
(71.0% vs. 61.5% and 43.7%) (P<0.001 for the overall comparison of survival between the 
group that received transplants from incompatible live donors and each of the control 
groups) (Fig. 2C). The survival rate for transplant recipients with a positive cytotoxic cross-
match exceeded the rates for the waiting-list-or-transplant and waiting-list-only control 
groups beginning at 21.7 months and 4.8 months, respectively. At 8 years, the survival rate 
for transplant recipients with a positive cytotoxic cross-match was increased by 9.5 
percentage points as compared with the rate for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group 
(risk of death reduced by a factor of 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.79; P = 0.004) and was 
increased by 27.3 percentage points as compared with the rate for the waiting-list-only 
control group (risk reduced by a factor of 2.50; 95% CI, 1.99 to 3.15; P<0.001).

 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The results were similar in an analysis that excluded patients from the highest-volume 
center. The survival rate after receipt of a kidney transplant from an incompatible live donor 
was similar to the rate in the primary analysis (P = 0.57), as were the rates for the matched 
controls (P = 0.98 for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and P = 0.38 for the 
waiting-list-only control group) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similarly, 
receipt of a transplant from an incompatible live donor was associated with reductions in the 
risk of death that were similar to the reductions in the primary analysis for the comparisons 
with the waiting-list-or-transplant control group (risk reduced by a factor of 1.95; 95% CI, 
1.64 to 2.32; P<0.001) and the waiting-list-only control group (risk reduced by a factor of 
3.71; 95% CI, 3.13 to 4.40; P<0.001) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, receipt of a kidney transplant from an incompatible live donor was 
associated with a significant survival benefit as compared with the other options available to 
sensitized patients, with absolute increases in the 8-year survival rate of 13.6 and 32.6 
percentage points as compared with the respective rates among controls who remained on 
the waiting list or received a transplant from a deceased donor (risk of death reduced by a 
factor of 1.83) and controls who remained on the waiting list and did not receive a transplant 
from a deceased donor (risk of death reduced by a factor of 3.37). This survival benefit was 
seen across all donor-specific antibody levels. Survival rates were increased by 24.2 and 42.1 
percentage points as compared with the respective rates in the waiting-list-or-transplant and 
waiting-list-alone control groups (risk of death reduced by a factor of 3.49 and by a factor of 
6.48, respectively) for transplant recipients with a positive Luminex assay but a negative 
flow-cytometric cross-match, by 13.0 and 33.3 percentage points (risk reduced by a factor of 
1.89 and by a factor of 3.56) for those with a positive flow-cytometric cross-match but a 
negative cytotoxic cross-match, and by 9.5 and 27.3 percentage points (risk reduced by a 
factor of 1.41 and by a factor of 2.50) for those with a positive cytotoxic cross-match. The 
results of an analysis that excluded patients from the highest-volume center were consistent 
with these findings.
Previously reported outcomes for patients receiving a kidney transplant from an 
incompatible live donor at one center, Johns Hopkins University,19 included a survival rate 
of 80.6% at 8 years as compared with 76.5% in the present multi-center study. The single-
center results were similar to the results of this multicenter study when stratified according 
to the donor-specific antibody level, with a 4-year survival rate of 90.8% in the single-center 
study and an 8-year survival rate of 89.2% in the multicenter study for transplant recipients 
with a positive Luminex assay; 8-year survival rates of 79.7% and 76.3% in the single-center 
and multicenter studies, respectively, for recipients with a positive flow-cytometric cross-
match; and 8-year survival rates of 78.0% and 71.0%, respectively, for recipients with a 
positive cytotoxic cross-match. These findings suggest that the outcomes of transplantation 
with kidneys from incompatible live donors are generalizable from a single center that 
provides specialized care for sensitized patients to multiple centers performing such 
transplantations.

 The strengths of the current study include its multicenter design (22 centers), large sample 
(1025 recipients of kidneys from incompatible live donors), and robust matching of the 
transplant recipients with controls. One limitation of the study is the heterogeneity in 
antibody testing and in the interpretation of test results among the centers.37–40 We 
accounted for these differences by including only transplant recipients who underwent 
perioperative desensitization — that is, only patients considered by the centers to have a 
large enough donor-specific antibody burden to warrant desensitization — and by asking the 
centers to classify the donor-specific antibody level on the basis of the decreasing relative 
sensitivities of the Luminex assay, flow-cytometric cross-match testing, and cytotoxic cross-
match testing. A second limitation is the change in the measure of sensitization in 2009, 
when the calculated panel-reactive antibody supplanted the traditional panel-reactive 
antibody system. However, since we matched controls according to the transplantation date 
for the transplant recipients, equivalent systems of measuring panel-reactive antibody were 
used for recipients of kidneys from incompatible live donors and their matched controls. 
Finally, desensitization protocols and their success rates, induction and maintenance 
immunosuppressive regimens, and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection vary across 
centers, and our study was not designed to assess those differences. The likelihood of 
substantial heterogeneity in these practices among the centers enhances the external validity 
of the survival benefit with transplantation of kidneys from incompatible live donors in 
clinical settings other than that of a single, specialized, high-volume center.19

 Figure 1. Overall Comparison of Survival between the Group That Received Kidney Transplants 
from HLA-Incompatible Live Donors and Each Group of Matched Controls
In one control group, the controls remained on the waiting list or received a transplant from 
a deceased donor. In the other control group, controls remained on the waiting list and did 
not receive a transplant from a deceased donor.

 Figure 2. Survival Benefit for Recipients of Kidney Transplants from HLA-Incompatible Live 
Donors as Compared with the Two Groups of Matched Controls, According to Donor-Specific 
Antibody Level
The survival benefit is shown for transplant recipients who had a positive Luminex assay but 
a negative flow-cytometric cross-match (Panel A), those who had a positive flow-cytometric 
cross-match but a negative cytotoxic cross-match (Panel B), and those who had a positive 
cytotoxic cross-match (Panel C).

Table 1
Antibody-Detection Methods and Sensitivity.*
Assay
Method
Cytotoxic cross-match
Donor lymphocytes, recipient serum, and complement are added together. If serum from the recipient contains 
donor-specific anti-HLA antibody at a level sufficient to kill recipient cells, it is called a positive cross-match. 
This requires a high level of antibody.
Flow-cytometric cross-match
Donor lymphocytes, recipient serum, and fluorescein-labeled antibodies against human IgG are mixed together. 
If recipient serum contains moderate levels of donor-specific anti-HLA antibody, it will be detected by flow 
cytometer and is called a positive flow-cytometric cross-match. Flow cytometry detects a moderate level of 
antibody.
Luminex antibody testing
Recipient serum is run through a column of beads coated with a wide range of polymorphic HLA molecules 
tagged with unique, identifying immunofluorescence. If recipient serum contains donor-specific anti-HLA 
antibody, even at a very low level, it can be detected by the Luminex assay.
*The assays are listed in order from least sensitive (requires high levels of antibody for a positive result) to most sensitive (can detect low levels of 
antibody).
