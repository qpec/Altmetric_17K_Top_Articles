ABSTRACT
Background: Prevalence of young adult hearing loss is high in low-
resource societies; the reasons for this are likely complex but could
involve early childhood undernutrition.
Objective: We evaluated preschool childhood stunting, wasting, and
underweight as risk factors for hearing loss in young adulthood in
Sarlahi District, southern Nepal.
Design: Ear health was assessed in 2006–2008 in a cohort of 2193
subjects aged 16–23 y, who as children <60 mo of age participated
in a 16-mo placebo-controlled, randomized vitamin A supplementa-
tion trial from 1989 to 1991. At each of five 4-mo assessments, field
staff measured children’
s weight, height, and mid-upper arm circum-
ference (MUAC) and recorded validated parental history of ear dis-
charge in the previous 7 d. Children were classified as stunted [<–2
z score height-for-age (HAZ)], underweight [<–2 z score weight-
for-age (WAZ)], or wasted [<–2 z score MUAC-for-age (MUACAZ)
or body mass index-for-age (BMIAZ)]. At follow-up, hearing was
tested by audiometry and tympanometry, with hearing loss defined
as pure-tone average >30dB in the worse ear (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz)
and middle-ear dysfunction as abnormal tympanometric peak height
(<0.3 or >1.4 mmho) or width (<50 or >110 daPa).
Results: Hearing loss, present in 5.9% (95% CI: 5.01%, 7.00%) of
subjects, was associated with early childhood stunting (OR: 1.64;
95% CI: 1.10, 1.45), underweight (OR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.44) and
wasting by BMIAZ (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.97) and MUACAZ
(OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.47, 3.12). Abnormal tympanometry, affecting
16.6% (95% CI: 15.06%, 18.18%), was associated with underweight
(OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.84) and wasting by BMIAZ (OR: 1.80;
95% CI: 1.32, 2.46) and MUACAZ (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.84),
but not stunting (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.49) in early childhood.
Highest ORs were observed for subjects with both hearing loss and
abnormal tympanometry, ranging from 1.87 to 2.24 (all lower 95%
CI >1.00).
Conclusions: Early childhood undernutrition is a modifiable risk fac-
tor for early adulthood hearing loss. Am J Clin Nutr 2018;107:268–

INTRODUCTION
Hearing loss ranks as the fourth leading cause of years lived
with disability, and 80% of the estimated 1.1 billion people liv-
ing with hearing loss globally reside in low- and middle-income
countries (1). Children with hearing loss are at risk for speech,
language, and cognitive delays (2–5), decreased school perfor-
mance (6–9), and increased likelihood of limited employment
opportunities as adults (10, 11). Where examined in South Asia,
the prevalence of school-aged to adolescent and early adult hear-
ing loss ranges from 14.2% (95% CI: 7.9%, 26.4%) in males and
9.1% (95% CI: 4.9%, 17.4%) in females aged 5–19 y to 27.7%
(95% CI: 16.1%, 45.1%) in men and 18.9% (95% CI: 10.6%,
33.3%) in women aged 20–34 y (12). Taken together, these esti-
mates suggest that >116 million young people in the region are
hearing impaired (12). However, the epidemiology, causation and
preventable pathways to hearing loss remain poorly characterized
and prevention a virtually unattended public health priority (13).

 UNDERNUTRITION AND HEARING LOSS IN NEPAL
269
Micronutrient deficiencies that often coexist with generalized
undernutrition at critical stages of development have been linked
to hearing impairment. Missing from the literature is a rigor-
ous exploration of the risk of hearing loss imposed by general-
ized undernutrition in early life (13). Undernutrition, expressed
as stunted linear growth and suboptimal weight for a child’
s age,
remains the dominant form of childhood malnutrition throughout
rural South Asia. The prevalence of stunting, wasting, and under-
weight in South-Central Asia is 37.8%, 16.1% and 31.8%, respec-
tively, affecting an estimated 162 million children and account-
ing for substantial preschool morbidity and mortality (14). While
there are plausible mechanisms by which chronic protein and en-
ergy deprivation during development may interfere with ear for-
mation and function in fetal and early postnatal stages (15–17),
virtually no population evidence exists to associate early child-
hood wasting, stunting, or their joint expression as underweight
with risk of later-life hearing loss.
In this paper, we report associations between early childhood
undernutrition and risks of hearing loss and middle-ear dysfunc-
tion in a cohort of young adults in rural southern Nepal, where
high burdens of early childhood wasting, stunting (18,19), and
ear infections (20) coexist with hearing loss in later childhood and
adulthood (20,21). During their preschool years, this cohort par-
ticipated in a randomized trial of vitamin A supplementation that
also assessed nutritional status by anthropometry (18). Our pri-
mary hypothesis was that stunting, wasting, and underweight dur-
ing the preschool-aged years would be positively associated with
hearing loss, as measured during a 16-y follow-up study in early
adulthood. The presence of such a longitudinal association would
be consistent with a hypothesis that adequate nutrition early in
life could help reduce hearing disability in later life, providing
an as-yet little appreciated argument for preventing childhood
malnutrition.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
This study was carried out from 2006 to 2008 in the
population-dense district of Sarlahi in the plains of southern
Nepal, an area resembling in ecological, cultural, and demo-
graphic terms the greater Gangetic floodplain of South Asia.
Participants were 2193 young adults aged 16–23 y who as
preschool-aged children participated in a cluster-randomized vi-
tamin A supplementation trial between 1989 and 1991 (Nepal
Nutrition Intervention Project-1, NNIPS-1) (18). Details of the
original trial design and methods have been previously described
(18). Briefly, 261 administrative wards in 29 contiguous Village
Development Communities in Sarlahi District were randomized
for preschool children to receive every 4 mo either vitamin A
or placebo supplements, containing either 200,000 IU or 300
IU (placebo) of vitamin A, respectively. Every 4 mo during the
16-mo trial, children’
s weight, height, and mid-upper arm cir-
cumference (MUAC) were measured, and a validated parental
history of ear discharge in the previous 7 d was recorded,
with multiple positive weekly histories interpreted as individual
episodes (19, 22). Household socioeconomic status and demo-
graphic information were recorded at the second 4-mo household
visit. Socioeconomic variables included asset (e.g., radios) and
land ownership, drinking water source, house construction mate-
rials, and household size. Literacy status, education, and occupa-
tion of the head of the household were also recorded.
In a subsample of 40 wards, randomly and equally sampled
from 4 quadrants of the study area to obtain geographic balance
across the ∼200 km2 study area, parents or guardians brought
their children to a central site in their community for an enhanced
protocol of anthropometry, ocular, and ear health assessments.
Baseline measures included the following: 1) standing height for
children ≥24 mo of age or recumbent length for children 0–23
mo, read to the nearest 0.1 cm on a steel tape attached to a wooden
board with a foot plate and sliding head block (Shorr Produc-
tions); 2) weight, with children lightly clothed or naked, read to
the nearest 0.1 kg on a hanging spring scale (Salter Ltd); and 3)
left MUAC read to the nearest 0.1 cm measured using a Zerfas
insertion tape (23, 24). All measures were repeated at each sub-
sequent 4-mo visit.
Census and residence status update survey
A follow-up health and nutritional status assessment was con-
ducted in this trial in 2006–2008. An initial census was carried
out between June and August 2006 to update vital and residential
status of cohort subjects who were recorded as alive at the end
of the original NNIPS-1 trial in 1991. Subjects from the origi-
nal subsample of 40 wards were considered to be eligible to be
visited for the follow-up study if they were found to be living
in their original home or tracked to another residence within the
larger NNIPS study area, regardless of their physical presence on
the day of the census.
Ear health and hearing study
Details of the present ear health study protocol have been pre-
viously described (27). Eligibility was restricted to adolescents
and young adults in the 40-ward subcohort who were enrolled at
the first (baseline) visit of the original trial when <5 y of age,
exited the trial alive in 1991, and were reported to be resident in
the study area in the 2006 census. Subjects were excluded from
analysis if their original trial records lacked baseline anthropom-
etry data (height, weight, and MUAC). The follow-up ear health
study consisted of 2 activities on separate days: a household so-
cioeconomic survey carried out by trained interviewers, and an
ear examination and screening test for hearing and middle-ear
dysfunction, which was performed by a clinically trained team.
Verbal consent was obtained from subjects aged ≥18 y. Assent
from subjects plus verbal consent from parents or guardians were
obtained for individuals aged <18 y, unless subjects were married
in which case their consent was obtained as emancipated minors.
Clinical ear examinations and hearing tests were conducted by
2 trained technicians at a convenient site in each participant’
s
community (20). An additional consent, specific to the hearing
disorders assessment protocol, was obtained before the exam.
The tympanic membrane was examined using a lighted otoscope
(HEINE mini 2000). The presence of cerumen impaction, defined
as >80% canal occlusion by ear wax, was recorded. Audiomet-
ric testing was performed using a digital audiometer (240 dig-
ital audiometer; Amplivox) with foam-tipped insert earphones
(Auditory System; E-A-R). Cerumen was not removed prior to
hearing assessment. In pure-tone audiometry, an individual is
presented with tones at different frequencies (kHz) and inten-
sities (measured in decibels hearing level, dB) to determine the

quietest audible sound at each frequency. The standard frequen-
cies tested in audiometric evaluation (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz) in-
clude the speech frequencies. Thresholds ≤25dB are considered
normal (25). Participants who failed to respond to a screening
tone of 30 dB in either ear at ≥1 frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz)
were considered to have failed screening and proceeded to full
audiometric testing to establish air conduction thresholds at 0.5,
1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz bilaterally. For those who failed to respond at
the limit of the audiometer’
s range, the next intensity level beyond
the audiometer’
s limit, 125 dB hearing level, was assigned for fre-
quencies with no response (20, 26). The thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2,
and 4 kHz were averaged to generate a pure-tone average (PTA).
Hearing loss was defined by PTA >30 dB (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) in
the worse hearing ear. Background noise levels were separately
measured and recorded before hearing screening (Quest 2100 Ba-
sic Sound Level Meter) and full audiometric testing (Quest 2700
Advanced Sound Level Meter with Octave Band Filter).
A portable tympanometric device (Welch-Allyn Micro Tymp
2 Tympanometer) was used to assess middle-ear health and func-
tion in this study. Tympanometry measures the volume of the
external auditory canal and the compliance of the tympanic mem-
brane (27). It is an important adjunct to pure-tone audiome-
try, particularly in populations that experience high prevalence
of ear infections (28). Middle-ear dysfunction was defined as
an abnormal tympanometric peak height (<0.3 or >1.4 mmho)
or abnormal width, defined by the distance in daPa across the
tympanogram at a height 50% down from the peak (<50 or
>110 daPa) based on norms recommended by the manufacturer
for the specific device (29). Standard calibration was applied, as
the study region has an average elevation of 125 m above sea
level.
Compliance
A substantial proportion of subjects listed as resident during
the 2006 census were absent during the initial ear assessment.
In order to raise response rates, field teams continued to revisit
households of unmeasured subjects during a period of 8 mo fol-
lowing completion of the first set of visits in the ear health study
whenever subjects were reported as having returned home by lo-
cal staff or family. In addition, for a period of 2 wk in Novem-
ber 2007, field teams relocated to Kathmandu to assess subjects
whose residence had changed to the capital city and for whom
approximate addresses were available.
All completed data forms were checked for errors and attempts
were made to resolve inconsistencies in the field before transmit-
tal by vehicle to a data-processing center in Kathmandu. Upon
data entry, data were again checked for errors and, if valid to do
so, returned to the field for resolution.
Statistical analysis
Preschool nutritional anthropometric indicators, including
height-for-age z score (HAZ), weight-for-age z score (WAZ),
BMI-for-age z score (BMIAZ) and MUAC-for-age z score
(MUACAZ), were expressed as SD (z) scores by compar-
ing the anthropometric measures to age-sex specific distribu-
tions from the WHO Multicenter Growth Reference Study child
growth standards (WHO Anthro, version 3.2.2) (30). Implau-
sible z score values were coded as missing for the present
study. BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms
by the square of height in meters. Stunting was defined by
HAZ <–2, underweight by WAZ <–2, and wasting by either
BMIAZ <–2 or MUACAZ <–2.
Initial analysis assessed the potential of selection bias by com-
paring a number of early childhood characteristics of study par-
ticipants with subjects who were listed as area residents in the
project’
s 2006 census but who, after several months of periodic
checking, remained absent from home. Distributions of discreet
characteristics between groups were tested for significance by
a chi-square test. Risks of young adult hearing loss and mid-
dle ear dysfunction associated with early childhood nutritional
status were estimated by ORs and 95% CIs derived from unad-
justed logistic regression models. Statistical significance of un-
adjusted OR estimates (i.e., P value <0.10) guided selection of
most variables for inclusion into the multivariable model. How-
ever, certain conventional demographic and socioeconomic vari-
ables were included in the risk estimation models irrespective of
the statistical significance of their association with hearing loss
outcomes (31). Model adequacy was evaluated using the Hosmer-
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
Data from both randomly assigned supplementation groups in
the original trial (vitamin A or placebo) were used in this anal-
ysis. An interaction term representing the effect of supplemen-
tation was added to each final model to assess whether vitamin
A supplementation modified the risk of hearing loss in young
adulthood associated with baseline anthropometric indicator lev-
els of preschool undernutrition. All analyses were conducted us-
ing SAS, version 9.3. (SAS Institute Inc.).
This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional re-
view boards at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University,
Kathmandu, Nepal and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.
RESULTS
Follow-up of study participants
A total of 4765 children aged <5 y entered the original trial
during the baseline visit from September to December 1989, of
whom 4375 were recorded as alive and resident in the study area
at the end of the trial (follow-up visit 7) in 1991 (Figure 1).
Among these children, 414 did not have requisite baseline an-
thropometry data from the original trial. Of the 3961 remaining
children, 846 reportedly moved and 129 died over the subsequent
15 y. Thus, 2986 children were reported to be resident in the study
area at the time of the 2006 prestudy census, representing the tar-
get group for the follow-up ear health survey. Between the cen-
sus and the ear health assessment, a period that spanned 3–13 mo,
114 additional children had moved, 16 had died, and 619 were re-
peatedly found to be absent for the hearing assessment. A small
number of either parents or children refused to participate on the
day of the ear health assessment (n = 9), leaving longitudinal data
available for 2193 subjects, representing 50% of the subjects who
were alive at the close-out of the trial (n = 4375) in 1991 and 73%
of the study’
s target group (n = 2986) reported resident at the time
of the pre-study census.
Comparability of participants and nonparticipants in
hearing assessment

sumed survivors who exited the original trial. Thus, to evaluate

potential nonresponse biases, early childhood household, health,
and nutritional characteristics were compared between subjects
who participated in the ear health and hearing study (n = 2193)
and those who did not for reasons of having moved or other-
wise not found for assessment (n = 1623) (Table 1). Young
adult participants in the ear health and hearing study were more
likely than those not assessed to have been raised in house-
holds of higher socioeconomic status, reflected in head of house-
hold literacy (45.4% compared with 38.0%; P < 0.001), edu-
cation through secondary school (7.5% compared with 5.6%;
P < 0.05), and occupation as farmer (69.0% compared with
59.2%; P < 0.001). Households of participants were more likely
to be from higher castes (Brahmin or Chettri) (21.8% compared
with 17.9%; P < 0.05) and own land (79.7% compared with
71.4%; P < 0.001) and other assets such as watches, bicycles, and
radios compared with nonparticipants (all P < 0.001). Subjects
who participated in the study were more likely than nonpartici-
pants to be male (59.9% compared with 43.8%) and younger in
age (79.8% compared with 85.3% ≥1 y of age at the time of the
baseline visit of the original trial) (both P < 0.001). Participants,
as preschoolers, were also slightly less likely at the original base-
line visit to have been wasted by arm circumference (MUACAZ
<–2: 23.7% compared with 26.8%; P < 0.05), although general
levels of early childhood illness were comparable as reported by
repeated 7-d histories of symptoms of infectious morbidity, in-
cluding ear discharge, throughout the original trial. This compa-
rability in health suggests that the differences in socioeconomic
and demographic status in early childhood likely had minimal in-
fluence on nutritional and infectious exposures being examined in
relation to hearing loss in young adulthood. Within the ear health
and hearing study cohort itself there were no significant differ-
ences in socioeconomic or demographic characteristics measured
in early childhood by hearing status in young adulthood, further
suggesting that early childhood demographic and socioeconomic
factors had little influence on later-life hearing loss in this cohort
(data not shown). All further analyses are restricted to cohort par-
ticipants in the ear health and hearing study for whom the requi-
site risk factor data from early childhood exists.
Preschool nutritional status
Preschool nutritional status at the baseline visit of the trial was
poor (Figure 2), reflected by low values (mean ± SD) of HAZ
(–2.4 ± 1.4), WAZ (–2.0 ± 1.1), BMIAZ (–0.7 ± 1.1), and
MUACAZ (–1.4 ± 0.9).
Adolescent and young adulthood hearing and
tympanometry status
Of 2193 subjects assessed, 5.93% (n = 130/2193; 95% CI:
5.01%, 7.00%) demonstrated hearing loss. Further, a total of
16.56% (n = 360/2174; 95% CI: 15.06%, 18.18%) exhibited ab-
normal tympanometry by abnormal peak height or width, with
abnormal peak height evident in 13.47% (n = 293/2175; 95% CI:
12.10%, 14.97%) and abnormal width in 10.29% (n = 224/2176;
95% CI: 9.09%, 11.64%) of subjects, respectively.
Risk of hearing loss in young adulthood by preschool
nutrition status
Subjects who were malnourished (<–2 z for standardized indi-
cators) as children were consistently at higher risk of being hear-
ing impaired as young adults (Table 2). Hearing loss was asso-
ciated with early childhood stunting (HAZ OR: 1.64; 95% CI:
1.10, 2.45), underweight (WAZ OR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.44),
and wasting (MUACAZ OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.47, 3.12; BMIAZ
OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.97), associations that remained after
adjustment for age, sex, and multiple indicators of socioeconomic
status (SES) (Table 2). ORs for hearing loss with each indicator
of early childhood undernutrition remained nearly the same af-
ter further controlling for ear infections with discharge (Adjusted

Model 2, Table 2), a leading early childhood cause of hearing
loss (32). Tympanometry can assist in delineating whether hear-
ing loss is sensorineural (permanent, nerve-related loss) or con-
ductive (middle ear-related and often mediated by infection), with
hearing loss independent of abnormal tympanometry more likely
to be sensorineural in nature. When adjustment for abnormal tym-
panometry was performed, hearing loss remained associated with
early childhood stunting (HAZ OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.13, 2.86).
The hearing loss associations with underweight (WAZ OR: 1.42;
95% CI: 0.95, 2.12) and wasting (BMIAZ OR: 1.33; 95% CI:
0.77, 2.30; MUACAZ OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.73) were dimin-
ished, with declines in ORs for all 3 indicators and only MUAC
maintaining significance (Adjusted Model 3, Table 2). All asso-
ciations between hearing loss and indicators of early childhood
undernutrition remained when adjusting for cerumen impaction,
which can cause temporary hearing loss (Adjusted Model 4,
Table 2).
Risk of abnormal tympanometry in young adulthood by
preschool nutrition status
Middle-ear dysfunction, reflected by abnormal tympanome-
try, was not associated with early childhood stunting (HAZ OR:
1.18; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.49) but was associated with underweight
(WAZ OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.84) and wasting by both BMI
and MUAC (BMIAZ OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.46 and

Risk of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in young
adulthood by preschool nutrition status
The risk of having both hearing loss and abnormal tympanom-
etry by early childhood anthropometric status is summarized in
Table 4. Hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry were asso-
ciated with stunting (HAZ OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.72), un-
derweight (WAZ OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.92), and wasting
(BMIAZ OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.32, 3.79; MUACAZ OR: 2.15;
95% CI: 1.37, 3.40) in the unadjusted models. ORs remained
comparable or stronger after controlling for SES factors and for
preschool ear infections with discharge (Adjusted Models 1 and
2, Table 4).
Preschool vitamin A receipt
Four-monthly vitamin A compared with placebo receipt, as
randomly assigned during the original trial, was introduced as an
interaction term with each nutritional indicator in each outcome
model and was found to be not significant (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest population-based study
with the longest follow-up period conducted in a developing
country to document poor nutritional status during preschool
years as a risk factor for hearing loss in adult life. Hearing loss
has been associated with malnutrition in other settings, including
prisoners of war (33–35) and periods of acute food deprivation in
civilians (36, 37). In these scenarios, the observed hearing loss is
sensorineural and is often accompanied by neuropathies and vi-
sion problems. The severity of hearing loss has ranged from mild
to profound and has been noted to persist beyond resolution of
other symptoms. Theories on the underlying pathophysiology in-
clude demyelination of the 8th cranial nerve (34) and metabolic
lesions such as mitochondrial damage that selectively affect neu-
rons with high energy consumption (36). Studies of protein mal-
nutrition in rats support the vulnerability of the auditory brain-
stem pathway to nutritional insults (22, 23).
In our study, anthropometric indicators of early childhood
wasting and stunting were consistently associated with a 1.8- to
2.2-fold higher risk of early-adult hearing loss. An important dis-
tinction emerged in the risk associated with tympanometric find-
ings to suggest potentially distinct pathways underlying these as-
sociations. Acute undernutrition in early childhood, represented
by a low BMI or thin arm circumference for age, was associated
with both an ∼2-fold higher risk of hearing loss and a 1.4- to
1.8-fold increased risk of abnormal tympanometry. When con-
trolling for abnormal tympanometry, the relation between hear-
ing loss and indicators of acute undernutrition were weakened.
This is an expected reduction in the risk relation given the co-
existence between infection and acute or wasting malnutrition.
A similar pattern is observed with weight-for-age, a composite
indicator that is highly influenced by BMI. Stunting, by contrast,
was associated with a 1.6-fold increased risk of hearing loss in
young adulthood that remained when controlling for abnormal
tympanometry. When considering the risk of hearing loss and ab-
normal tympanometry in combination, however, the relative odds
of hearing loss in children with early childhood stunting was in-
creased to 2.2, suggesting that infections were likely to have been
at least partially involved in the pathophysiology of hearing loss
associated with both wasting and stunting (38, 39). Several obser-
vational studies have similarly noted that children who are under-
weight or acutely malnourished are at higher risk for otitis media
(40, 41). The susceptibility to infectious disease among malnour-
ished children is presumed to be related to decreased immune
system function (42, 43), although animal studies of middle-ear
mucosa have not been conducted to confirm this relation specific
to middle-ear pathology.
Aside from the increased risk of hearing loss with abnor-
mal tympanometry, chronic undernutrition, indicated by stunt-
ing, was also associated with later-life hearing loss with nor-
mal middle-ear function. This association with sensorineural
hearing loss suggests involvement of an alternative mechanism
in addition to the infectious pathway. Early childhood stunt-
ing reflects not only poor postnatal nutrition and morbidity, but
also in utero nutritional exposures and impaired growth (44).
Christian et al. (45) recently evaluated the relation between
small-for-gestational age and stunting in early childhood using
19 longitudinal birth cohorts worldwide that included >44,000
children. Small-for-gestational age at birth was associated with a
2.4–4.5 times increased odds of early childhood stunting, with a

population-attributable risk of 20%. Thus, our young adult sub-
jects who were stunted as preschoolers likely experienced sub-
stantial fetal growth restriction. Therefore, it is plausible that the
observed associations between early childhood nutritional status
and hearing loss reflect, in part, a consequence of in utero nutri-
tional exposures, suggesting an etiologically relevant period for
hearing loss in association with malnutrition that extends from
fetal life through the preschool years.
Given that periodic preschool vitamin A receipt reduced hear-
ing loss associated with early childhood otitis media (46), we
tested and found no evidence of interaction between vitamin A
receipt in the original trial and relative odds of hearing loss or ab-
normal tympanometry associated with wasting or stunting. This
suggests that the risk of hearing loss posed by protein-energy
malnutrition was independent of protective effects of vitamin
A against otitis media-related hearing loss during the preschool
years.
A limitation to this study is the substantial number (45%) of
subjects eligible for follow-up at the end of the preschool trial
who were not assessed for hearing ability in young adulthood.
Those young adults whom we did not measure were more likely
to be women, older in age, and of lower SES. However, bias is
unlikely to threaten the validity of our findings because the early
childhood demographic and socioeconomic factors that differed
between the 2 assessment groups were not related to hearing loss
in young adulthood.
We did not collect information on history of hearing loss at
birth, speech-language delay, cleft lip or palate, or noise expo-
sure in the original trial. These factors would have been helpful in
eliciting timing and etiology of hearing loss in our cohort and rep-
resent limitations in the study design. There are known infectious
etiologies of perinatal sensorineural hearing loss, such as congen-
ital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which were not consid-
ered within this study (47). While CMV-associated hearing loss
has been well studied in the United States and Europe, there are
no data published to date on prevalence of CMV-associated hear-
ing loss in Nepal (48, 49). Considering the emerging evidence
on geographic and socioeconomic disparities of CMV infection,
evaluation of CMV-related hearing loss in low-resource settings,
and its relation with undernutrition, are areas that warrant future
study (50, 51).
This study was conducted in a rural, chronically undernour-
ished South Asian population with limited access to health-
care services, representing the type of population to which these
findings may be most relevant. However, the extent to which
these findings reported here reflect conditions in better-nourished,
healthier populations remains unknown. Caution should be used
when generalizing these findings to populations with better ac-
cess to healthcare.
