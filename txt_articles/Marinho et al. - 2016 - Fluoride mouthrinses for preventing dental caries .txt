Background
Fluoride mouthrinses have been used extensively as a caries-preventive intervention in school-based programmes and by individuals at
home. This is an update of the Cochrane review of fluoride mouthrinses for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents that
was first published in 2003.
Objectives
The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride mouthrinses in preventing dental caries in the child and
adolescent population.
The secondary objective is to examine whether the effect of fluoride rinses is influenced by:
• initial level of caries severity;
• background exposure to fluoride in water (or salt), toothpastes or reported fluoride sources other than the study option(s); or
• fluoride concentration (ppm F) or frequency of use (times per year).
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (whole database, to 22 April 2016), the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 22 April 2016),
Embase Ovid (1980 to 22 April 2016), CINAHL EBSCO (the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1937 to
22 April 2016), LILACS BIREME (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database, 1982 to 22 April 2016),
BBO BIREME (Bibliografia Brasileira de Odontologia; from 1986 to 22 April 2016), Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 22
April 2016) and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 22 April 2016). We undertook a search for ongoing trials on the US
National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching electronic databases. We also searched
reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers.

 Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials where blind outcome assessment was stated or indicated, comparing fluoride
mouthrinse with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years of age. Study duration had to be at least one year. The main
outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces in permanent teeth (D(M)FS).
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We contacted study
authors for additional information when required. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF), that is, the difference
in mean caries increments between treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group.
We conducted random-effects meta-analyses where data could be pooled. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity in random-
effects metaregression analyses. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials.
Main results
In this review, we included 37 trials involving 15,813 children and adolescents. All trials tested supervised use of fluoride mouthrinse
in schools, with two studies also including home use. Almost all children received a fluoride rinse formulated with sodium fluoride
(NaF), mostly on either a daily or weekly/fortnightly basis and at two main strengths, 230 or 900 ppm F, respectively. Most studies
(28) were at high risk of bias, and nine were at unclear risk of bias.
From the 35 trials (15,305 participants) that contributed data on permanent tooth surface for meta-analysis, the D(M)FS pooled PF
was 27% (95% confidence interval (CI), 23% to 30%; I2 = 42%) (moderate quality evidence). We found no significant association
between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and baseline caries severity, background exposure to fluorides, rinsing frequency
or fluoride concentration in metaregression analyses. A funnel plot of the 35 studies in the D(M)FS PF meta-analysis indicated no
relationship between prevented fraction and study precision (no evidence of reporting bias). The pooled estimate of D(M)FT PF was
23% (95% CI, 18% to 29%; I² = 54%), from the 13 trials that contributed data for the permanent teeth meta-analysis (moderate
quality evidence).
We found limited information concerning possible adverse effects or acceptability of the treatment regimen in the included trials. Three
trials incompletely reported data on tooth staining, and one trial incompletely reported information on mucosal irritation/allergic
reaction. None of the trials reported on acute adverse symptoms during treatment.
Authors’ conclusions
This review found that supervised regular use of fluoride mouthrinse by children and adolescents is associated with a large reduction
in caries increment in permanent teeth. We are moderately certain of the size of the effect. Most of the evidence evaluated use of
fluoride mouthrinse supervised in a school setting, but the findings may be applicable to children in other settings with supervised or
unsupervised rinsing, although the size of the caries-preventive effect is less clear. Any future research on fluoride mouthrinses should
focus on head-to-head comparisons between different fluoride rinse features or fluoride rinses against other preventive strategies, and
should evaluate adverse effects and acceptability.

Fluoride mouthrinses for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents
Review question
How effective and safe is the use of fluoride mouthrinse for preventing tooth decay (dental caries) in children and adolescents compared
with placebo (a mouthrinse without the active ingredient fluoride) or no treatment?
Background
Tooth decay is a health problem worldwide, affecting the vast majority of adults and children. Levels of tooth decay vary between and
within countries, but children in lower socioeconomic groups (measured by income, education and employment) tend to have more
tooth decay. Untreated tooth decay can cause progressive destruction of the tops of teeth (crowns), often accompanied by severe pain.
Repair and replacement of decayed teeth is costly in terms of time and money and is a major drain on the resources of healthcare
systems.

Fluoride mouthrinses for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Preventing tooth decay in children and adolescents is regarded as a priority for dental services and is considered more cost-effective
than treatment. Use of fluoride, a mineral that prevents tooth decay, is widespread. As well as occurring naturally, fluoride is added to
the water supply in some areas, and is used in most toothpastes and in other products that are available to varying degrees worldwide.
As an extra preventive measure, fluoride can be applied directly to teeth as mouthrinses, lozenges, varnishes and gels.
Fluoride mouthrinse has frequently been used under supervision in school-based programmes to prevent tooth decay. Supervised
(depending on the age of the child) or unsupervised fluoride mouthrinse needs to be used regularly to have an effect. Recommended
procedure involves rinsing the mouth one to two minutes per day with a less concentrated solution containing fluoride, or once a week
or once every two weeks with a more concentrated solution. Because of the risk of swallowing too much fluoride, fluoride mouthrinses
are not recommended for children younger than six years of age.
This review updates the Cochrane review of fluoride mouthrinses for preventing tooth decay in children and adolescents that was first
published in 2003. We assessed existing research for Cochrane Oral Health, and evidence is current up to 22 April 2016.
Study characteristics
We included 37 studies in which more than 15,000 children (aged six to 14 years) were treated with fluoride mouthrinse or placebo
(a mouthrinse with no active ingredient) or received no treatment. All studies assessed supervised use of fluoride mouthrinse in school
settings, with two studies also including home use. Most children received a sodium fluoride (NaF) solution, given at 230 parts per
million of fluoride (ppm F) daily or a higher concentration of 900 ppm F weekly or fortnightly. Studies lasted from two to three years.
Reports were published between 1965 and 2005, and studies took place in several countries.
Key results
This review update confirmed that supervised regular use of fluoride mouthrinse can reduce tooth decay in children and adolescents.
Combined results of 35 trials showed that, on average, there is a 27% reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces in permanent
teeth with fluoride mouthrinse compared with placebo or no mouthrinse. This benefit is likely to be present even if children use fluoride
toothpaste or live in water-fluoridated areas. Combined results of 13 trials found an average 23% reduction in decayed, missing and
filled teeth (rather than tooth surfaces) in permanent teeth with fluoride mouthrinse compared with placebo or no mouthrinse. No
trials have looked at the effect of fluoride rinse on baby teeth. We found little information about unwanted side effects or about how
well children were able to cope with the use of mouthrinses.
Conclusion
Regular use of fluoride mouthrinse under supervision results in a large reduction in tooth decay in children’s permanent teeth. We
found little information about potential adverse effects and acceptability.
Quality of the evidence
Available evidence for permanent teeth is of moderate quality. This means we are moderately confident in the size of the effect. Very
little evidence is available to assess adverse effects.

 GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
different.
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
aPF = 1 - (mean increment in control group/ mean increment in treatment group) (expressed as percentages). PF values
between 1% and 10% are considered to be a small effect; between 10% and 20%, a moderate effect; above 20% a large or
substantial effect.
bAll studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. Trials had unclear or high risk of bias in sequence generation and allocation
concealment. Most studies had supervised mouthrinsing conducted in the school setting - this was considered for indirectness
but downgrading considered unnecessary.
cWide confidence interval - small number of participants analysed.
dHigh unexplained heterogeneity observed.
eIncomplete information from one to three trials with unclear or high risk of bias. Outcome downgraded for concerns of risk
of bias and serious imprecision.

Description of the condition
Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic disease, afflicting a
significant proportion of the world population, including around
60% to 90% of school-aged children and the vast majority of
adults (Marcenes 2013; Petersen 2004). Dental caries levels vary
considerably between and within countries, but children in lower
socioeconomic status (SES) groups have higher caries levels than
those in upper SES groups, and in high-income countries the
association between socioeconomic position and caries might be
stronger (Chen 1995; Reisine 2001; Schwendicke 2015). Un-
treated caries causes progressive destruction of the crowns of the
teeth, often accompanied by severe pain and suffering, especially
in children, where it can result in poorer quality of life and gen-
eral health (Sheiham 2005). Untreated caries in permanent teeth
was the most prevalent condition among all those evaluated in
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study, affecting 35%
of the global population, or 2.4 billion people; untreated caries
in deciduous teeth was the 10th most prevalent condition, af-
fecting 9% of the population, or 621 million children worldwide
(Kassebaum 2015). Repair and replacement of carious teeth is ex-
cessively time consuming and costly, representing a major drain
of resources for healthcare systems. On a population basis, dental
caries is the fourth most expensive chronic disease to treat accord-
ing to the World Health Organization (Petersen 2008).
Dental caries occurs because of demineralisation of tooth struc-
ture by organic acids formed by oral bacteria present in dental
plaque through the anaerobic metabolism of dietary sugars. The
causal role of sugars in caries is well established (Sheiham 2001).
Most caries lesions in children’s permanent teeth progress rela-
tively slowly, with an average lesion taking three years to progress
through tooth enamel to dentine (Mejare 1998). The dental caries
process is influenced by the susceptibility of the tooth surface, the
bacterial profile, the quantity and quality of saliva and the presence
of fluoride, which promotes remineralisation and inhibits dem-
ineralisation of the tooth structure.
Description of the intervention
Fluoride mouthrinses have been used extensively for the past 40
years to prevent dental caries in children. The use of rinses was es-
pecially widespread in school-based programmes in countries ex-
periencing high caries prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s. Doubts
about the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinse as a population
strategy began in the mid-1980s, in view of the decline in den-
tal caries, and their presumed cost-effectiveness was challenged
(Disney 1990; Stamm 1984). The current view is that fluoride
mouthrinsing programmes are appropriate only for children at
high risk of caries (FDI 2002). The fluoride compound most
commonly used in mouthrinse is sodium fluoride. Supervised,
school-based, weekly rinsing programmes using 900 ppm fluoride
(F) solutions of 0.2% sodium fluoride have been popular in the
United States in non-fluoridated communities (Horowitz 1996).
In Scandinavian countries and in several other countries, such pro-
grammes have been discontinued on the basis of the above-noted
caries decline and widespread use of fluoride toothpastes (Seppa
1989; Twetman 2004). Mouthrinse solutions of 0.05% sodium
fluoride, containing 230 ppm F, are available commercially for
daily home use in some countries. Rinses containing 100 ppm
F are also available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale and are rec-
ommended for twice-daily use. Fluoride mouthrinses have thus
moved from being a tool mainly advocated in the public health set-
ting; through the force of commercial marketing, they have gained
greater prominence in the personal dental products market. By
virtue of the widespread use of other oral mouthrinse products,
from simple breath fresheners to products formulated to counter
inflammatory periodontal (gum) diseases, it has been argued that
the procedure could in fact be cost-effective if those already using
non-fluoride mouthrinses convert to using fluoride rinses (Stamm
1993).
Although the procedure is not recommended for children younger
than six years of age because of the risk of acute and chronic flu-
oride ingestion, data have implicated use of fluoride mouthrinse
by preschool children as a risk factor for dental fluorosis (enamel
defects caused by chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of fluo-
ride during the period of tooth formation) because some young
children might swallow substantial amounts (Ripa 1991; Stookey
1994). Accidental swallowing of the usual 10 mL rinse volume
of a 0.05% (230 ppm F) NaF solution daily by a child of five
or six years of age will result in ingestion of 2.3 mg of fluoride
(the average dosage ingested would be twice the optimum level in
a fluoridated area). Although this dose is far below the probable
toxic dose (PTD) of fluoride, estimated to be 5 mg/kg body weight
(Whitford 1992), or approximately 100 mg of fluoride for a child
of five or six years (20 kg), this amount would be available in just
434 mL of the standard daily rinsing solution.
A large number of clinical trials have extensively investigated the
effect of fluoride mouthrinses on the incidence of caries in chil-
dren during the past five decades. Besides sodium fluoride solu-
tions,mouthrinsescontainingotherfluoride compounds in several
concentrations and rinsing frequencies have been tested. Numer-
ous articles and textbook chapters have reviewed evidence from
these primary studies on the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinses
(Birkeland 1978; Bohannan 1985; Leverett 1989; Petersson 1993;
Ripa 1991; Ripa 1992; Torell 1974). In one review article from
the mid-1980s, review authors used a meta-analytical approach to
synthesise the results of US fluoride mouthrinse studies carried out
in fluoride-deficient communities (Stamm 1984). Two systematic
reviews on the caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride mouthrinses have
been published more recently (Twetman 2004; Weyant 2013).
It is evident from these reviews and meta-analyses that fluoride

 mouthrinses are caries-inhibitory treatments. However, the au-
thors of these reviews failed to conduct a comprehensive search for
individual trials or to formally evaluate the risk of bias in included
trials, despite obvious drawbacks in the design and methods of the
included trials.
How the intervention might work
The most important anti-caries effect of fluoride present in dental
plaque and saliva is considered to result from its local action on
the tooth/plaque interface, through promotion of remineralisa-
tion of early caries lesions and reduction in tooth enamel solubility
(Featherstone 1988). Enamel demineralisation is markedly inhib-
ited if fluoride is present at the time of the acid challenge because,
as cariogenic bacteria metabolise carbohydrates and produce acid,
fluoride diffuses with the acid from dental plaque into the enamel
in response to lowered pH, and acts at the enamel crystal surface
to reduce mineral loss. When pH rises following enamel deminer-
alisation, released fluoride and fluoride present in the saliva can
combine with dissolved calcium and phosphate ions to precipi-
tate or grow fluorapatite-like crystalline material within the tooth,
thereby establishing an improved enamel crystal structure. Thus,
fluoride enhances this mineral gain and provides a material that
is more resistant to subsequent acid attack (Ten Cate 1999). This
occurs with all forms and concentrations of topical fluoride, al-
though to a variable extent. With high-concentration topical flu-
oride vehicles (such as varnishes and gels), calcium fluoride is pre-
cipitated on the enamel surface and in the plaque. This calcium
fluoride acts as a fluoride reservoir, which is released when the oral
pH falls, and the amount of fluoride deposited in the subsurface
lesion is greater after topical application with such high-concen-
tration fluoride vehicles (Horowitz 1996; Ogaard 1994; Ogaard
2001). Regular use of fluoride toothpaste or mouthrinse results
in sustained elevated fluoride concentrations in oral fluids during
the demineralisation-remineralisation cycle, as small amounts are
maintained constantly in the mouth (Clarkson 1996).
Why it is important to do this review
The Cochrane Oral Health Group undertook an extensive pri-
oritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles
that were the most clinically important ones to maintain in The
CochraneLibrary(Worthington 2015). The paediatricexpertpanel
identified this review as a priority title (Cochrane OHG priority
review portfolio).
Prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents is gener-
ally regarded as a priority for dental services and is considered
more cost-effective than treatment (Burt 1998). Fluoride ther-
apy has been the centrepiece of caries-preventive strategies since
water fluoridation schemes were introduced over six decades ago
(Murray 1991), when caries was highly prevalent and severe, and
when even modest prevention activities led to considerable reduc-
tion in disease levels. Over the past 30 years, with the substan-
tial decline in dental caries rates in many western countries, the
increase in dental fluorosis levels in some countries and intensive
research on the mechanism of action of fluoride highlighting the
primary importance of its topical effect, greater attention has been
paid to the appropriate use of other fluoride-based interventions
(Featherstone 1988; Featherstone 1999; Glass 1982; Marthaler
1996; O’Mullane 1994; Ripa 1991).
Use of topically applied fluoride products in particular, which
are much more concentrated than the fluoride in drinking water,
has increased over recent decades. By definition, the term ’topi-
cally applied fluoride’ is used to describe those delivery systems
that provide fluoride to exposed surfaces of the dentition, at el-
evated concentrations, for a local protective effect, and therefore
are not intended for ingestion. Fluoride-containing toothpastes
(dentifrices), mouthrinses, gels and varnishes are the modalities
most commonly used at present, alone or in combination. Vari-
ous products are marketed in different countries, and a variety of
caries-preventive programmes based on these products have been
implemented. Toothpastes are by far the most widespread form
of fluoride usage (Murray 1991a; Ripa 1991); although reasons
for the decline in prevalence of dental caries in children from dif-
ferent countries have been the topic of much debate (De Liefde
1998; Krasse 1996; Marthaler1996; Marthaler2004; Nadanovsky
1995), this event has been attributed mainly to the gradual in-
crease in, and regular home use of, fluoride in toothpaste (Bratthall
1996; Glass 1982; Marthaler 1994; O’Mullane 1994; Ripa 1991;
Rolla 1991).
At the same time, the lower caries prevalence in many countries
now and the widespread availability of fluoride from multiple
sources have raised the question of whether topically applied fluo-
rides are still effective in reducing caries, and whether they are safe,
mainly in terms of the potential risk of fluorosis (mottled enamel).
This is particularly important, as nearly all child populations in
high-income countries are exposed to some source of fluoride, no-
tably in toothpaste, and adverse effects may be rare (such as acute
fluoride toxicity) or more subtle (such as mild dental fluorosis)
(Marthaler 2004; Murray 1991a).
Traditional narrative reviews have extensively reviewed evidence
on the effects of topically applied fluoride products on prevention
of dental caries in children. Several systematic reviews focusing
on evaluation of specific fluoride active agents within specific de-
livery systems have used a quantitative meta-analytical approach
to synthesise trial results (Ammari 2003; Bartizek 2001; Chaves
2002; Clark 1985; Helfenstein 1994; Johnson 1993; Petersson
2004; Stamm 1984; Stamm 1995; Steiner 2004; Strohmenger
2001; Twetman 2004; Van Rijkom 1998; Weyant 2013). How-
ever, no systematic investigation has been conducted to evaluate
and compare effects of the main modalities of topically applied
fluoride treatments and to examine formally the main factors that
may influence their effectiveness.

Fluoride mouthrinses for preventing dental caries in children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 This review, which is one in a series of Cochrane systematic re-
views of topical fluoride interventions, assesses the effectiveness of
fluoride rinses for prevention of dental caries in children (Marinho
2003a; Marinho 2003b; Marinho 2004; Marinho 2004a; Marinho
2013; Marinho 2015). This is an update of the review first pub-
lished in 2003, which showed clear evidence of a caries-inhibiting
effect of fluoride mouthrinse in the permanent teeth of children
(Marinho 2003). It is generally recognised that blinding is partic-
ularly important when outcome measures require specific criteria
to improve objectivity in measurement, as in assessment of dental
caries. Of note in this series of topical fluoride reviews is that lack
of blinding in the main outcome assessment (caries increment)
or lack of any indication of blind outcome assessment remains
an exclusion criterion - that is, we have excluded studies if open
outcome assessment is reported, or if blind outcome assessment is
not reported and is unlikely to have been used.
O B J E C T I V E S
The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety
of fluoride mouthrinses in preventing dental caries in the child/
adolescent population.
The secondary objective is to examine whether the effect of fluo-
ride rinses is influenced by:
• initial level of caries severity;
• background exposure to fluoride in water (or salt),
toothpastes or reported fluoride sources other than the study
option(s); or
• fluoride concentration (ppm F) or frequency of use (times
per year).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials
where ’blind outcome assessment’ was stated or indicated (e.g.
caries examinations performed independently of previous results,
radiographic examinations registered separately from clinical ex-
aminations/added later, examiners clearly not involved in giving
treatment, use of placebo described), and in which the length of
follow-up was at least one year/school year. We included cluster-
randomised trials, except when only one cluster was assigned to
each study group .
We excluded randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials
with open outcome assessment or no indication of blind assess-
ment of outcome (blind assessment was considered unlikely if the
following were not described: a caries examination performed in-
dependently of previous results, X-rays registered independently
of clinical examination, examiners clearly not involved in giving
treatment and use of placebo), or lasting less than one year/school
year, or where random or quasi-random allocation was not used
or indicated. We also excluded split-mouth studies as they are un-
suitable for fluoride mouthrinse owing to unavoidable contami-
nation.
Types of participants
Children or adolescents aged 16 or younger at the start of the study
(irrespective of initial level of dental caries, background exposure
to fluorides, dental treatment level, nationality, setting where in-
tervention was received or time when it started).
We excluded studies where participants were selected on the basis
of special (general or oral) health conditions.
Types of interventions
Intervention: topical fluoride in the form of a mouthrinse that
is swished and expectorated, not swallowed. We included fluoride
mouthrinses irrespective of formulation, concentration (ppm F),
volume, duration or frequency of application, or application tech-
nique of application.
Comparison: placebo or no treatment.
Therefore, the following comparison is of interest: fluoride mouth
rinse versus placebo or no treatment.
We excluded studies where the intervention consisted of use of
any other caries-preventive agent or procedure (e.g. other fluo-
ride-based measures, chlorhexidine, sealants, oral hygiene inter-
ventions, xylitol chewing gums), in addition to fluoride rinse.
Types of outcome measures
The primary outcome measure in this review is caries increment,
as measured by change from baseline in the number of decayed
(missing) and filled permanent tooth surfaces (D(M)FS), or in the
number of decayed (extracted/missing) and filled primary tooth
surfaces (d(e/m)fs) or both (and change in the number of perma-
nent or primary teeth (D(M)FT/d(e/m)ft). Dental caries is de-
fined here as clinically and radiographically recorded at the dentin
level of diagnosis. If caries data were reported only with dentin
and enamel lesions combined, this was used in the analysis. (See
Data collection and analysis for different ways of recording caries
and reporting D(M)FT/S and d(m)ft/s scores in permanent and
primary dentitions in clinical trials of caries preventive interven-
tions, and for ways in which data were selected for analysis.)
We excluded studies reporting no dental caries data, reporting only
on plaque/gingivitis/gingival bleeding, calculus, dentin hypersen-

 sitivity or fluoride physiological outcome measures (fluoride up-
take by enamel or dentin, salivary secretion levels, etc).
Primary outcomes
• Caries increment in permanent tooth surfaces (D(M)FS),
reported as change from baseline (and D(M)FT, whenever
reported)
• Caries increment in primary tooth surfaces (d(e)fs),
reported as change from baseline (and d(e)ft, whenever reported)
Secondary outcomes
• Development of new caries, reported as change in the
proportion of children developing new caries
• Children not remaining caries-free, reported as a change in
the proportion
• Tooth staining, measured as change in the proportion of
children
• Signs of acute toxicity during application of treatment
(such as nausea/gagging/vomiting)
• Mucosal irritation/oral soft tissue allergic reaction
• Dropouts or withdrawals during the trial (as an indirect
measure of treatment acceptability)
Search methods for identification of studies
To identify trials for inclusion in this review, we developed detailed
search strategies for each database searched. These were based on
the search strategy developed for MEDLINE Ovid but revised ap-
propriately for each database. The search strategy used a combina-
tion of controlled vocabulary and free text terms and was linked
with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (CHSSS)
for identifying randomised trials (RCTs) in MEDLINE: sensitiv-
ity maximising version (2008 revision) as referenced in Chapter
6.4.11.1 and detailed in Box 6.4.c of the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 5.1.0 (updated March
2011) (Higgins 2011). We have provided details of the current
MEDLINE search strategy in Appendix 3. The search of Embase
was linked to Cochrane Oral Health’s filter for identifying RCTs.

We searched the following electronic databases:
• Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (searched 22 April
2016) (see Appendix 1);

Searching other resources
Reference searching
We scanned all eligible trial reports retrieved from the searches,
meta-analytical reports and systematic reviews/review articles for
relevant references. For the original version of this review, review
authors had also checked reference lists of relevant chapters from
preventive dentistry textbooks on topically applied fluoride inter-
ventions for relevant references (Ekstrand 1988; Fejerskov 1996;
Murray 1991c).
Handsearching
Review authors carried out some handsearching for the original
version of this review, using journals identified as having the high-
est yield of eligible RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs). We
handsearched the following journals:
• Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology (1990 to
2000);
• British Dental Journal (1999 to 2000);
• Caries Research (1999 to 2000);
• Journal of the American Dental Association (1999 to 2000);
• Journal of Dental Research (1999 to 2000);
• Journal of Public Health Dentistry (1999 to 2000); and
• European Journal of Oral Sciences (1999 to 2000).
For the update of this review, we did not undertake any hand-
searching.

 Personal contact
For the original review, we contacted experts in the field of pre-
ventive dentistry to identify any unpublished trials or trial reports
that may not have been indexed by the major databases. We sent
a letter to the author(s) of each included study published during
the 1980s and 1990s to request information on possible unpub-
lished trials eligible for inclusion. All authors of trials who had
been contacted to clarify reported information to enable assess-
ment of eligibility or obtain missing data were also asked for un-
published trials. In addition, on the basis of information extracted
mainly from included trials, we created a list of manufacturers of
fluoride rinses for locating unpublished trials, and we contacted
six fluoride rinse manufacturers in October 2000. We requested
information on any unpublished trials from GABA AG, Johnson
& Johnson, Oral-B Laboratories, Colgate Oral Pharmaceuticals,
Procter & Gamble and Warner Lambert. GABA provided a list
of 409 records obtained through a search performed in GALI-
DENT (Database of GABA Library in Dentistry) using the key-
word ’amine fluoride’; we incorporated in this update the search
results from this list of records from GABA.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
At least two review authors performed screening for eligibility in-
dependently for all reports identified from all searches performed.
We considered it essential to identify all reports related to the same
study. When a trial report thought to be potentially relevant was
written in a language not known to the review authors, it was trans-
lated and the inclusion criteria form completed by a review author
with reference to the translator. We attempted to contact authors
of trials that could not be classified to ascertain whether inclusion
criteria were met. We noted trials not fulfilling the inclusion cri-
teria and our reasons for excluding them in the Characteristics of
excluded studies table.
Data extraction and management
At least two review authors extracted data from all included stud-
ies in duplicate using a predesigned pilot-tested data extraction
form. We extracted numerical data presented only in graphs and
figures whenever possible. We attempted to contact study authors
by using an open-ended request to obtain missing information or
for clarification when necessary.
We extracted information related to study methods, including
study design, study duration (overall length of follow-up in years)
and objectivity/reliability of primary outcome measurement (di-
agnostic methods and thresholds/definitions used and included,
and monitoring of diagnostic errors).
We recorded information on sponsoring/funding institutions and
manufacturers involved.
We extracted characteristics related to participants, including age
(mean or range or both) at start, caries severity at start (aver-
age DMFS/dmfs, DFS/dfs or other caries increment measure, for
sample analysed), background exposure to other fluoride sources
(toothpaste, water, etc), year study began, location where study
wasconducted(country),settingwhere participants were recruited
(and setting of treatment) and total sample randomised (at base-
line) and analysed (at relevant final examination).
We extracted characteristics of the interventions, including mode
of application (how the intervention was delivered/supervision),
methods (technique/device) of application, before and after appli-
cation, fluoride active agents and concentrations used (in ppm F),
frequency and duration of application and amount applied. We
recorded information on what the fluoride mouthrinse was com-
pared with (no treatment or placebo), together with numbers for
each group. We have described these data in the Characteristics of
included studies table.
We recorded different ways of reporting caries increment (change
from baseline as measured by the DMF index) separately and/or
combined according to the components of the index chosen and
units measured (DMFT/S, or DFT/S, or DT/S, or FT/S), types
of tooth/surface considered (primary/permanent teeth/surfaces,
first molar teeth approximal surfaces, etc), diagnostic thresholds
used (cavitated/dentin lesions, non-cavitated incipient enamel le-
sions or both), methods of examination adopted (clinical or radio-
graphical, both or other), state of tooth eruption considered (teeth
erupted at baseline and/or erupting teeth (or surface) during the
trial) and approaches to account or not for reversals in caries in-
crement adopted (in a net caries increment or observed/crude in-
crement, respectively). In addition, we recorded caries increment
data at all reported time periods (at various follow-ups).
As we were aware that caries increment would be recorded dif-
ferently in different trials, we developed a set of a priori rules to
choose the main outcome data (D(M)FS) for analysis from each
study: DFS data would be chosen over DMFS data, and these
would be chosen over DS or FS; data for ’all surface types com-
bined’ would be chosen over data for ’specific types’ only; data for
’all erupted and erupting teeth combined’ would be chosen over
data for ’erupted’ only, and these over data for ’erupting’ only; data
from ’clinical and radiological examinations combined’ would be
chosen over data from ’clinical’ only, and these over ’radiological’
data only; data from ’clinical and FOTI examinations combined’
would be chosen over data from ’clinical’ examination only; data
for dentinal/cavitated caries lesions would be chosen over com-
bined data for dentinal/cavitated and for enamel/non-cavitated le-
sions, and these over enamel caries data only; net caries increment
data would be chosen over crude (observed) increment data; and
follow-up nearest to three years (often the one at the end of the
treatment period) would be chosen over all other lengths of fol-
low-up, unless otherwise stated. When no specification was pro-
11

 vided with regard to the methods of examination adopted, diag-
nostic thresholds used, groups of teeth and types of tooth eruption
recorded and approaches for reversals adopted, we assumed the
primary choices described above.
The Characteristics of included studies table provides a description
of all mainoutcome datareportedfromeach study, with the chosen
primary outcome measure featured at the top. When assessments
of caries increments were made during a postintervention follow-
up period, we noted the length of time over which outcomes were
measured after the intervention ended. We also listed in this table
all other relevant outcomes identified as assessed in the trials.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
At least two review authors independently undertook assessment
of risk of bias in all included trials. We resolved disagreements
by discussion or by involvement of another review author. This
was carried out using the tool of The Cochrane Collaboration
for assessing risk of bias, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), but accord-
ing to predefined criteria that were adapted and refined for the
Cochrane topical fluoride review updates. We assessed eight do-
mains according to the tool, namely, sequence generation, alloca-
tion concealment, blinding of participants/personnel, blinding of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome
reporting, balance of baseline characteristics and freedom from
contamination or co-intervention. Each domain included one or
more specific entries in a ’Risk of bias’ table. Within each entry, we
described information reported in the study and assigned a judge-
ment related to risk of bias for that entry. When the study clearly
reported the methods used, we made a judgement of ’low risk of
bias’ or ’ high risk of bias’ as appropriate. Where trial methods
were unclear, we judged a domain as at ’unclear risk of bias’ until
further information becomes available.
After taking into account additional information provided by trial
authors, we assessed the overall risk of bias in included trials over
all eight domains. We categorised studies as being at overall:
• low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the
results: all eight domains assessed as at low risk of bias);
• unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt
about the results: at least one domain assessed as at unclear risk
of bias, but none at high risk of bias); or
• high risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens
confidence in the results: at least one domain assessed as at high
risk of bias).
Measures of treatment effect
The chosen measure of treatment effect for the primary outcome,
caries increment, was the prevented fraction (PF), that is, mean in-
crement in control group minus mean increment in treated group,
divided by mean increment in controls. For an outcome such as
caries increment, where discrete counts are considered to approx-
imate to a continuous scale and are treated as continuous data,
we considered this measure more appropriate than the mean dif-
ference or the standardised mean difference because it allows the
combination of different ways of measuring caries increment and
a meaningful investigation of heterogeneity between trials. It is
also simple to interpret.
For outcomes other than caries increment, we planned that we
would summarise continuous data as average mean differences
(MDs) in treatment effects along with their 95% confidence in-
tervals (95% CIs), or, if different scales were used to measure the
same outcome in different trials, standardised mean differences
(SMDs) and their 95% CIs. We analysed dichotomous outcome
data by calculating risk ratios (RRs) or, for adverse effects of fluo-
ride treatment, risk differences (RDs).
Unit of analysis issues
Trials with multiple treatment arms
In trials with more than one relevant intervention group and a
common control group, such as those comparing different active
fluoride agents or concentrations of fluoride ions against a placebo
group, we combined summary statistics (the number of children
analysed, mean caries increments and standard deviations) from
all relevant experimental groups (and from any relevant control
groups, if this was the case) to obtain a measure of treatment effect
(the PF). This enabled the inclusion of all relevant data in the pri-
mary meta-analysis, although it might have slightly compromised
the secondary investigations of dose response.
Cluster-randomised trials
When cluster-randomised trials did not report results adjusted for
clustering present in the data, we performed an approximately
correct analysis by estimating the design effect for such trials (
Higgins 2011) by using:
• the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) if reported;
• an ICC value of 0.05 obtained from a similar study
(Lawrence 2008; ICC = 0.045) to reduce the numbers in
intervention and control groups to their ’effective sample size’; or
• an ICC value of 0.1 already used for the cluster trial in the
original review to inflate the standard error of the PF by
multiplying it by the square root of the design effect.
The design effect is (1 + (M-1) * ICC) where M is the average
cluster size.
Dealing with missing data
We decided that when missing standard deviations for caries in-
crements could not be obtained by contacting the original re-
searchers, we would impute these values through linear regression
12

 of log standard deviations on log mean caries increments. This
is a suitable approach for caries prevention trials because, as they
follow an approximate Poisson distribution, caries increments are
closely related (similar) to their standard deviations (Van Rijkom
1998).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity by inspecting a graphical display of es-
timated treatment effects from trials along with their 95% CIs
and by conducting formal tests of homogeneity undertaken be-
fore each meta-analysis (Thompson 1999). We quantified this by
using the I2 statistic and classified it according to the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
A rough guide to interpretation follows: 0% to 40% might not be
important, 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity,
50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity and 75% to
100% may indicate very substantial (“considerable”) heterogene-
ity.
Assessment of reporting biases
Reporting bias can be assessed as within-study outcomes reporting
bias or as between-study publication bias.
Outcomes reporting bias (within-study reporting bias)
Within-study reporting bias (one of the eight ’risk of bias’ domains
listed above, as selective outcome reporting) would ideally be as-
sessed by comparing outcomes reported in the published report
against the study protocol. As this was not possible, we compared
the outcomes listed in the Methods section with reported results.
If results were mentioned but were not reported adequately in a
way that allowed analysis (e.g. only mentioned whether or not the
results were statistically significant), we sought information from
the authors of study reports. Otherwise, this would be judged as
“high risk” of bias. If information was insufficient to judge the risk
of bias, we judged the risk as unclear (Higgins 2011).
Publication bias (between-study reporting bias)
We generated funnel plots (plots of effect estimates versus the in-
verse of their standard errors) when we identified sufficient trials
(more than 10). Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate pub-
lication bias and other biases related to sample size, although this
may also represent a true relationship between trial size and size
of effect. We performed a formal investigation of the degree of
asymmetry by using the method proposed by Egger 1997.
Data synthesis
We conducted meta-analyses for the PFs as inverse variance
weighted averages in Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 2014), where
the prevented fraction and standard error data [PF (SE)] were en-
tered by using the generic inverse variance (GIV) method. We
estimated variances using the formula presented in Dubey 1965,
which was more suitable for use in a weighted average, and for large
sample sizes the approximation should be reasonable. Two previ-
ous reviews (Marinho 2013; Marinho 2015) noted that this for-
mula was inappropriate for studies with small increments, and that
the data from such studies were to be excluded from the analysis
in this review. We used random-effects meta-analyses throughout
and analysed primary and permanent teeth separately throughout.
We used random-effects models to calculate a pooled estimate of
effect for outcomes other than caries increment data.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We specified three potential sources of heterogeneity a priori, as
these formed part of the primary objectives of this review. We hy-
pothesised that the effect of fluoride mouthrinses on caries dif-
fers according to: (1) baseline levels of caries severity; (2) ex-
posure to other fluoride sources (in water, in toothpastes, etc);
and (3) frequency of application and fluoride concentration. We
examined the association of these factors with estimated effects
(D(M)FS PFs) by performing random-effects metaregression anal-
yses in Stata version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station,
Texas, USA) using the ’Metareg’ command (Sharp 1998).
To allow such investigation, we dealt with relevant data as follows.
We calculated data on ’baseline levels of caries’ from the study sam-
ple analysed (final sample) unless otherwise stated, and we aver-
aged values among all relevant study groups. Data on ’background
exposure to other fluoride sources’ represented combined data on
use of fluoride toothpaste and consumption of fluoridated water
(or salt) and were grouped into two categories: one for studies that
were based on samples provided with non-fluoride toothpaste and
that were obtained from non-fluoridated areas (non-exposed), and
another for studies based on samples using fluoride toothpaste or
studies in fluoridated communities or both. We considered expo-
sure to water fluoridation when fluoride levels in water were stated
to be above 0.3 ppm F. Use of fluoride toothpaste reported for
30% or more of the study sample would indicate exposure to flu-
oridated toothpaste. When use or non-use of fluoride toothpaste
was not clearly indicated in studies carried out in high-income
countries, we assumed that fluoride toothpaste was widely used
from the middle of the 1970s (Ripa 1989); we sought this informa-
tion from study authors (or obtained it from other sources) when
missing from studies carried out in other locations. When data
on the year a study had begun were not provided, we calculated a
’probable date’ by subtracting the duration of the study (in years)
plus one extra year, from the publication date of the study. We
have not categorised data on ’frequency of application’ and ’con-
centration applied’. We averaged concentrations in multiple-arm
studies over fluoride mouthrinse groups. We dealt with incom-
plete data for frequency of mouthrinsing as follows: In studies of
supervised daily rinse at school where participants were provided
13

 with mouthrinse for home use, we assumed rinsing frequency of
365 times a year if not precisely reported. We assumed rinsing fre-
quency of 320 times a year in studies of ’unsupervised’ daily rinse
at home (even if instructions to rinse more than once a day were
given); we assumed frequency of 160 times (days) a year when it
was not precisely reported in studies of supervised daily rinse at
school where children were not provided with any rinse for home
use; frequency of 30 times a year for weekly rinse at school and
frequency of 17 times a year for fortnightly rinse at school.
We investigated further potential sources of heterogeneity by
metaregression - for different types of control groups (placebo (PL)
or no treatment (NT), length of follow-up (years) and dropout
rate (%). These ’post hoc’ analyses were reported as such and find-
ings should be treated with caution.
Sensitivity analysis
For the main meta-analysis of D(M)FS prevented fraction, we
planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis including trials with
an overall assessment of low risk of bias, but we found no trials
satisfying this criterion. We undertook a sensitivity analysis ex-
cluding trials where we imputed missing standard deviations. We
performed a sensitivity analysis to take account of additional un-
certainty related to the cluster-randomised trial by Ruiken 1987,
and another excluding one trial (Spets-Happonen 1991) in which
a non-fluoride active agent was present in both fluoride and con-
trol groups (the trial was different in this way from all others). We
also undertook a sensitivity analysis excluding trials at high risk
of bias for allocation concealment, and another excluding trials at
high and unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment.
We performed these meta-analyses using a random-effects model.
Presentation of main results - Summary of findings
We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach (
gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org) to rate the overall ’quality of evi-
dence’ forourprimaryoutcome andthe mostimportant secondary
outcomes in the main comparison. Summary of findings for the
main comparison providesoutcome-specificinformationconcern-
ing the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the
comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions exam-
ined and the sum of available data on all outcomes that we rate as
important to patient care and decision making.
The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are con-
fident that an estimate of effect is correct and apply this in our
interpretation of results. The four possible ratings are ’high’, ’mod-
erate’, ’low’ and ’very low’. A rating of ’high quality’ of evidence
implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and believe
that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in
the estimate of effect. A rating of ’very low quality’ quality implies
that any estimates of effect obtained are very uncertain.
The GRADE approach considers evidence from RCTs that do not
have serious limitations as ’high’ quality. However, the quality of
evidence can be decreased by:
• study limitations (risk of bias);
• inconsistency;
• Indirectness of evidence;
• imprecision; and
• publication bias.
Depending on the seriousness of limitations, we downgraded the
quality of evidence by one or two levels for each aspect.

 For this update, we identified 1823 records through searches (from
electronic databases and other sources) and screened 1231 after
removing duplicates and records already linked to the review in
Archie. After discarding 1099 records as irrelevant, we assessed
132 full-text articles (including some available only as abstracts or
summary reports) as potentially eligible, and considered 126 for
inclusion in this review. Of these 126 reports:
• 62 reports were related to 37 included trials (including the
36 trials included in the original 2003 review);
• 63 reports were related to 50 excluded trials (including the
43 trials excluded in the original review); and
• one report was related to one study that awaits classification.
We found no reports of ongoing studies.
Included studies
See Characteristics of included studies table for details of each
study.
We included37trialsinthe review. We treatedthe studyconducted
by Horowitz 1971 as two independent trials (Horowitz 1971 and
Horowitz 1971a) because results for the two age groups in the
study have been reported separately as distinct studies. Also, these
completely distinct studies were published concomitantly by the
same author: Koch 1967, Koch 1967a and Koch 1967b. All 62
study reports were published between 1965 and 2005. The 36
previouslyincludedtrialswere conductedbetween1962and1994:
10 during the 1960s, 19 during the 1970s, six during the 1980s
and one in the 1990s. The 2016 update of this review found
another trial conducted in the early 2000s (Moberg Sköld 2005).
Thirteen trials were conducted in the USA, four in the UK, six in
Sweden, two in Denmark, two in Canada, two in New Zealand,
three in Brazil and one in each of the following countries: Finland
(Spets-Happonen 1991), The Netherlands (Ruiken 1987), South
Africa (van Wyk 1986), Chile (Molina 1987) and Puerto Rico
(Duany 1981). Fifteen studies had more than one publication,
and one of these studies had seven published reports (Koch 1967).
Eleven trials acknowledged assistance (e.g. product provision) and/
or financial support from fluoride mouthrinse manufacturers; 13
trials acknowledged support from non-commercial sources, and
16 trials provided no information on sources of funding.
Design and methods
All included studies used a parallel-group design, and one was
cluster randomised (Ruiken 1987). Sixteen studies had more than
one fluoride mouthrinse treatment group compared with a control
(multi-treatment studies); among these, one trial had two treat-
ment groups and two placebo control groups (Ringelberg 1979).
Six trials used a factorial design to investigate the effects of multi-
ple topical fluoride interventions (Ashley 1977; Blinkhorn 1983;
DePaola 1980; Koch 1967; Ringelberg 1979; Torell 1965). With
regard to type of control group used, five trials used a no treatment
control group (Craig 1981; Moberg Sköld 2005; Moreira 1981;
Ruiken 1987; Torell 1965), and the remaining 32 used a placebo
control group, of which two used tap water as ’placebo solution’
(Moreira 1972; Petersson 1998). Study duration (indicated by to-
tal length of follow-up as well as treatment duration) ranged from
two to three years among included trials; only three trials lasted
less than two years (1.6 years) (Horowitz 1971; Horowitz 1971a;
Radike 1973).
Participants
Studieswere large;onlytwotrialsallocatedfewerthan100children
to relevant groups (Craig 1981; Spets-Happonen 1991). The total
number of children participating in the 37 included trials (given
by the sample analysed at the end of the trial periods) was 15,813,
and ranged from 95 in the smallest trial (Spets-Happonen 1991)
to 1238 in the largest trial (Ringelberg 1982), on average 427
participants per trial.
Investigators recruited all participants from school settings.
All included trials reported that participants were aged 14 or
younger at the start, with similar numbers of males and females
(where these data were reported). The age of children at the start
of trials ranged from five to 14 years (where these data were re-
ported); at least 18 trials included children who were 12 years old
at the start, and at least five trials included six-year-olds (but re-
ported no primary teeth caries data). Caries prevalence at base-
line (decayed, missing and filled surfaces (D(M)FS)), reported in
all but two studies, ranged from 0.94 (Horowitz 1971) to 14.6
D(M)FS (Koch 1967). With regard to ’background exposure to
other fluoride sources’, all but two studies reported whether or
not participants were exposed to water fluoridation: Four stud-
ies were conducted in fluoridated communities (Driscoll 1982;
Laswell 1975; Moreira 1981; Radike 1973), and 31 studies were
not. Of the 31 studies conducted in non-fluoridated areas, re-
searchers clearly reported no (or very low) background exposure
to fluoride toothpaste or to other fluoride sources in eight studies,
substantial exposure to fluoride toothpaste (over 95%) in seven
studies and exposure to other fluoride sources - varnish (Moberg
Sköld 2005) and tablets (Ruiken 1987) - in two studies; whether
or not participants were exposed to fluoride toothpaste had to be
assumed in 16 studies based on study location and year started, as
described above.
Interventions
All included trials reported supervised use of fluoride mouthrinse
in school programmes, and two trials also tested use of rinse at
16

 home (Spets-Happonen 1991; Torell 1965). Rinsing with sodium
fluoride (NaF) was tested in 33 trials, acidulated phosphate fluo-
ride (APF) in four trials (Finn 1975; Heifetz 1973; Laswell 1975;
Packer 1975), stannous fluoride (SnF2) in two (McConchie 1977;
Radike 1973) and sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP), amine
fluoride (AmF) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) each in a differ-
ent study (Bastos 1989; Ringelberg 1979 and DePaola 1977, re-
spectively). The fluoride concentration used in tested mouthrinses
ranged from 100 ppm F (0.02% NaF) to 3000 ppm F (0.66%
NaF), and frequency of application ranged from three to 330 times
a year, but these were unusually low and high concentrations and
frequencies. Eighteen studies used the concentration of 230 ppm
F (180 and 250 ppm F in a few studies), and 20 studies the concen-
tration of 900 ppm F (1000 ppm F in a few studies). It can be seen
that when rinsing was performed once a week or once every two
weeks, investigators employing 900 ppm F was usually used (17
trials). Conversely, when rinsing was performed once (or twice) a
day, the fluoride concentration used was 230 ppm F, or around
this concentration (13 trials). The only study (Duany 1981) where
information on rinsing frequency was not available is likely to have
used daily rinses for all three low concentrations of fluoride tested
(this was one of the four studies testing 100 ppm F rinsing solu-
tions). The most usual amounts of mouthrinse used per applica-
tion was 5 or 10 mL, and usual rinsing time was one or two min-
utes (these amounts and rinsing times were reported in 21 studies).
Four studies reported performance of some form of prior tooth
prophylaxis (brushing without paste or with a non-fluoride paste
before rinsing, which was not considered a separate intervention
on its own but as a possible part of the rinsing procedure) (Ashley
1977; Blinkhorn 1983; Craig 1981; Spets-Happonen 1991).
Outcome measures
Caries increment data
All but two of the 37 trials (Brandt 1972; De Liefde 1989) reported
caries increment data (or data from which these could be derived)
at the tooth surface level (D(M)FS), and 13 trials reported caries
increment at the tooth level (D(M)FT) for permanent dentition;
no trial reported caries increment data for the primary dentition
[d(e/m)fs/d data]. With regard to components of the DMFS in-
dex used (and types of teeth/surfaces assessed), 20 trials reported
DMFS data (one trial for premolars and molars only, and 19 tri-
als for all tooth surface types), and 17 trials reported DFS data
(two trials for approximal surfaces of premolars and molars only,
and 15 trials for all tooth surface types). No choice had to be
made between DMFS or DFS data in any one trial. Sixteen trials
presented D(M)FS data at more than one follow-up time (which
ranged from 1.6 to three years); 27 trials reported follow-up of 2
or 3 years. Three trials also assessed D(M)FS increments during a
postintervention follow-up period.
Two studies did not include a visual examination to detect caries
(Moberg Sköld 2005; Petersson 1998) when caries was diagnosed
by X-rays only. In five studies where a visual examination was em-
ployed, investigators did not report use of a probe including tactile
criteria (Ashley 1977; Blinkhorn 1983; Brandt 1972; Rugg-Gunn
1973; Ruiken 1987). Twenty trials used X-rays in addition to vi-
sual examination for caries detection. Clinical (35 trials) and ra-
diographic (22 trials) examinations provided the definition of dif-
ferent levels or grades of caries lesions, which have been grouped
into two basic grades for each method of examination: NCA =
non-cavitated incipient enamel lesions clinically visible as white
spots or discoloured fissures; CA = lesions showing loss of enamel
continuity that can be recorded clinically (undermined enamel,
softened floor/walls) or showing frank cavitation; ER = any radi-
olucency in enamel/enamel-dentine junction; DR = radiolucency
into dentine. Eighteen trials presented results using the dentine
cavitation level of diagnosis for caries (CA/DR), and two trials
presented results using the enamel level (NCA/ER) (Ashley 1977;
Heifetz 1973). The 17 trials remaining did not report the diag-
nostic level/grade used for caries (14 trials), in which case CA/DR
was assumed, or reported both levels of diagnosis (Moberg Sköld
2005; Petersson 1998; Ruiken 1987), in which case CA/DR was
chosen where viable. Nineteen trials specified data on the state
of tooth eruption considered: seven trials reported data for teeth
erupted at baseline (although data were recorded on erupting and
erupted teeth in some), and 12 trials reported combined data for
erupting and erupted teeth.
Other outcome data
Five trials reporting caries increment also used other similar mea-
sures/indices - caries incidence/attack rate in permanent teeth/sur-
faces (Heidmann 1992; Koch 1967; Koch 1967a; Koch 1967b;
Moreira 1981). Three trials reported data on the proportion of
children developing new caries (Finn 1975; Heidmann 1992;
Torell 1965). One trial also reported data on caries progression
(Moberg Sköld 2005), but no trials have reported data on children
not remaining caries-free.
A few trials reported assessment of data on adverse effects, but
incompletely: stain score (Ringelberg 1979); proportion of chil-
dren with tooth staining (McConchie 1977; Radike 1973), with
incomplete data; signs of sensitivity (allergic reactions) in oral soft
tissue (Rugg-Gunn 1973), with the following statement in the
trial: “no cases of mucosal hypersensitivity after periodical exam-
inations of every subject”; any side effects (Bastos 1989; DePaola
1977; McConchie 1977), with incomplete or no useable data and
with the following statement in all three trials: “no adverse side
effects observed”. No trials reported adverse acute symptoms (nau-
sea/vomiting during treatment).
Four of the five non-placebo (no-treatment) control trials provided
data for unacceptability of the treatment regimen (as measured by
dropouts/exclusions) (Craig 1981; Moberg Sköld 2005; Moreira
17

Excluded studies
See Characteristics of excluded studies for a description of our
reasons for rejecting each study.
We excluded 50 trials for a variety of reasons. We have categorised
these as related to study design, intervention/comparison or out-
come, as given below, on the basis of the main or most obvious
reason(s) for exclusion.
Study design
• Not an RCT or quasi-RCT or unlikely to be so - 34 studies
(Arcieri 1981; Badersten 1975; Bohannan 1985a; Boyd 1985;
Bristow 1975; Chen 2010; Chikte 1996; Cichocka 1981; Clark
1985a; Corpus 1973; De Canton 1983; Disney 1989; Esteva

McCormick 1970; Mendonca 1995; Moungtin 1975; Nenyei
1971; Roberts 1948; Rodriguez Miro 1983; Shimada 1978;
Suntsov 1991; Torell 1969; Weisz 1960; Widenheim 1989;
Wilson 1978; Wycoff 1991).
• Open assessment stated or blinded outcome assessment not
stated or unlikely - 33 studies: four studies owing to lack of
blinding in outcome assessment (Brodeur 1989; Castellanos
1983; Mendonca 1995; Ramos 1995) and the other 29 studies
owing to other features that met the exclusion criteria (Arcieri
1981; Axelsson 1976; Badersten 1975; Birkeland 1973;
Bohannan 1985a; Chen 2010; Chikte 1996; Cichocka 1981;
Corpus 1973; DePaola 1967; Disney 1989; Esteva Canto 1991;
Fernandez 1979; Hall 1964; Irmisch 1974; Ivanova 1990; Kani
1973; Kasakura 1966; Kunzel 1978; Louw 1995; Morgan 1998;
Morozova 1983; Moungtin 1975; Nenyei 1971; Shimada 1978;
Suntsov 1991; Weisz 1960; Widenheim 1989; Wycoff 1991).
Intervention/comparison
• Other intervention or active agent applied with fluoride
mouthrinse - 16 studies: five studies owing to use of additional
intervention (Gray 1980; Heifetz 1979; Kitsugi 1978; Luoma
1978; Zickert 1982 ) and the other 11 studies owing to other
features that met the exclusion criteria (Axelsson 1976; Badersten
1975; Boyd 1985; Bristow 1975; De Canton 1983; DePaola
1967; Disney 1989; Irmisch 1974; Morgan 1998; Morozova
1983; Rodriguez Miro 1983).
• Fluoride rinse solution swallowed after rinsing - two studies
(Aasenden 1972; Frankl 1972).
Outcome
• Followed up for less than one year - we excluded three
studies on this basis (Birkeland 1973; Boyd 1985; Swerdloff
1969), but only one study solely on this basis (Swerdloff 1969).
We excluded no studies or the reason that the children/adolescent
population enrolled had been medically/dentally compromised.

Risk of bias graph: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item presented as
percentages across all included studies (a plot of the distribution of judgements (low risk of bias, unclear risk of
bias and high risk of bias) across studies for each risk of bias item)
All included studies were published between one and four decades
ago, and ratings considered the overall context of those papers and
correspondence with studyauthorswhere available.We considered
none of the included studies to be at low risk of bias overall. We
considered nine studies to be at unclear risk of bias (Ashley 1977;
Blinkhorn 1983; Gallagher 1974; Heidmann 1992; Heifetz 1982;
Petersson 1998; Poulsen 1984; Radike 1973; Rugg-Gunn 1973)
and the remaining 28 studies to be at high risk of bias.
Allocation
None of the studies were at low risk of selection bias overall, that
is, low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation
concealment. Most (23 studies) were at unclear risk of bias for
sequence generation and allocation concealment. We rated three
of the studies as having high risk of bias for both sequence gener-
ation and allocation concealment because researchers very likely
used a quasi-randomisation method (Bastos 1989; Moreira 1972;
Moreira 1981).
At least 20 studies had described attempting to do some form of
stratification by sex, age, dental age, caries status, number of ex-
aminers, etc. Five of these (Bastos 1989; Gallagher 1974; Moreira
1972; Moreira 1981; Ruiken 1987) did not use participants as the
unit of randomisation. Ruiken 1987 had stratified schools accord-
ing to their socioeconomic status and used the schools as a unit
of randomisation. Bastos 1989 had divided children “randomly”
between two examiners according to gender and age, and had ar-
ranged them in ascending order in terms of number of permanent
teeth present and caries status (DMFS); investigators then formed
these children into groups of four before assigning rinsing solu-
tions “at random”. Moreira 1972 and Moreira 1981 had used a
similar method, forming “homogeneous” groups of four and as-
signing interventions “randomly”. It seems very likely that inves-
tigators used a quasi-randomised method, and allocation conceal-
ment would not have been effective. Gallagher 1974 divided the
children in each class into two “teams” on the basis of caries status
and dental age, then used a flip of a coin to decide which team
received the intervention.
We considered eight studies to be at low risk of bias related to ran-
dom sequence generation (Ashley 1977; Craig 1981; Heidmann
1992; Heifetz1982; Molina 1987; Radike 1973; Ringelberg 1979;
Torell 1965), but the adequacy of allocation concealment was un-
clear. In addition to the three studies mentioned above (Bastos
1989; Moreira 1972; Moreira 1981), another four studies were
likely to have used a quasi-randomised method for sequence gen-
eration. Three studies (Koch 1967; Koch 1967a; Koch 1967b) had
separated girls and boys into classes, arranged their names in al-
phabetical order and then assigned them to treatment or control in
alternation (quasi-randomisation). However, because all students

 were involved in the trial and the order of students appearing in
the class register cannot be changed, the risk of bias arising from
lack of concealment is low. Moberg Sköld 2005 had only described
randomising participants and did not provide details, but overall
descriptions in the report suggest that a quasi-randomised method
very likely was used.
Blinding
Performance bias
We considered five studies as having high risk of performance bias,
as a placebo group was not used (Craig 1981; Moberg Sköld 2005;
Moreira 1981; Ruiken 1987; Torell 1965) - the control group
did not use a mouthrinse (no treatment). Risk was unclear in
another six studies (Bastos 1989; Koch 1967; Koch 1967a; Koch
1967b; Moreira 1972; Petersson 1998); we are unclear whether
the “placebo” used was similar enough to maintain blinding. We
considered the rest of the studies as having low risk of performance
bias.
Detection bias
Only studies that indicated that outcomes assessors were blinded
were included in this review. Of all studies included, it was uncer-
tain if attempts to blind the examiners were adequate in eight stud-
ies: Five of these studies used no treatment as the control group
(Craig 1981; Moberg Sköld 2005; Moreira 1981; Ruiken 1987;
Torell 1965) and were at high risk of bias for participant/person-
nel blinding; three studies used a placebo control group (Finn
1975; Laswell 1975; Packer 1975) and indicated only blinding of
outcome assessment (examinations were done independently, or
X-rays were used). All studies described diagnostic methods used
(clinical or radiographic), but not all studies reported thresholds/
definitions used for caries and monitoring of diagnostic errors (see
’Notes’ in the Characteristics of included studies table for method-
ological features assessed). We rated the remaining 29 studies as
having low risk of bias for outcome assessment.
Incomplete outcome data
The risk of attrition bias was high for most of the included studies
(25 trials). We considered only two out of 37 studies to be at low
risk of attrition bias (Craig 1981; Poulsen 1984). We considered
another 10 studies to be at unclear risk of bias (Ashley 1977;
Blinkhorn 1983; Gallagher 1974; Heidmann 1992; Heifetz 1982;
Koch 1967; Petersson 1998; Radike 1973; Rugg-Gunn 1973;
Torell 1965).
All the participants considered at the end of each study as a pro-
portion of all the participants present at start was 65.3% (13,622
analysed out of 20,854 randomised); this excludes six studies
with no data by group on participants randomised (Ashley 1977;
De Liefde 1989; DePaola 1980; Duany 1981; Petersson 1998;
Spets-Happonen 1991). We could not obtain dropout rates for
five of the 37 included studies (De Liefde 1989; DePaola 1980;
Duany 1981; Petersson 1998; Spets-Happonen 1991). We noted
considerable variation in dropout rates, ranging from 8% at three
years to 62% at 2.5 years. Reasons for exclusions (when given)
included moving away, absence for follow-up examinations and
refusal to participate or poor compliance. A few trials reported
numbers excluded according to reason for attrition.
Selective reporting
Ideally, we would have compared outcomes listed in each study
protocol against outcomes reported in the papers, but this was sel-
dom possible. Most of the studies in this review were published be-
fore the year 2000 and provided very little information. We com-
pared results reported in the studies against what was stated in the
Methods section and used clinical judgement to consider whether
studies had reported data as expected. We considered two studies
to be at high risk of selective reporting bias (Brandt 1972; De
Liefde 1989). Brandt 1972 reported only matched-pair analyses
data (94 pairs; data from more than a quarter of available partic-
ipants not analysed).. In our correspondence, the trial author ex-
plained that this was an attempt to correct the baseline imbalance
observed, but unfortunately, the method of analysis broke the ran-
domisation, precluding inclusion of data in the meta-analysis. De
Liefde 1989 reported only results of combined non-randomised
and randomised groups (separate results for placebo group not
available, data could not be included for meta-analysis).
Seven other studies (Bastos 1989; DePaola 1977; Koch 1967;
McConchie 1977; Moberg Sköld 2005; Radike 1973; Ringelberg
1979) had unclear risk of bias, most often because of inadequate
reporting/non-reporting of adverse event data.
Other potential sources of bias
Baseline imbalance
We assessed whether imbalance of important prognostic factors
(baseline caries level) was evident between the arms of included
trials. We assessed 30 trials as having low risk of bias for this
domain.
We considered three studies to be at high risk of bias from baseline
imbalance. One trial did not report any baseline data (De Liefde
1989), whereas Brandt 1972 had described baseline imbalance in
caries level. Duany 1981 also observed baseline imbalance in caries
level.
We considered four studies to be at unclear risk of bias. DePaola
1980 described baseline data as “balanced” (for which randomi-
sation may have succeeded to produce nearly exact balance) but
did not report any of the actual values for baseline characteristics
(such as initial caries levels). A few trials reported some degree of
21

 imbalance (for characteristics considered most influential, usually
initial caries levels) and generally described this as not significant
or indicated that adjustment had resulted in trivial differences in
effect estimates (Koch 1967b; Laswell 1975; Rugg-Gunn 1973).
Contamination/co-intervention
We assessed 10 trials as having low risk of bias owing to freedom
from contamination. These trials provided information suggest-
ing no differences between groups in co-interventions that could
have affected observed outcomes, such as toothbrushing practices,
oral hygiene instructions, dental checkups/preventive treatments
or rinsing procedures. In the other studies, risk of bias was unclear,
as researchers provided no or not enough information.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Summary

treatment for preventing caries in children and adolescents
Fluoride mouthrinses versus placebo or no treatment
Effects of fluoride mouthrinses on dental caries increment
The included studies reported the effects of fluoride mouthrinses
on dental caries increment (as measured by the DMF index) in
a variety of ways. Where appropriate and possible, we have com-
bined these to produce pooled estimates. We have reported the
prevented fraction (PF) results separately here for:
• decayed (missing) and filled surface prevented fraction
(D(M)FS PF) (Analysis 1.1; 35 trials); and
• decayed (missing) and filled teeth prevented fraction
(D(M)FT PF) (Analysis 1.2; 13 trials).
We could not present in this review estimates of the effects of flu-
oride mouthrinse on caries increment in deciduous teeth/surfaces
(as measured by the dmf index) as no study contributed data.
Two included studies (Brandt 1972; De Liefde 1989) did not
contribute data suitable for meta-analysis, although we have re-
tained them in the review as part of the qualitative data synthe-
sis (we have described their characteristics in the Characteristics
of included studies table). We have extracted data from the other
trials as appropriate to produce the pooled estimates, as described
in the Methods section.
Imputation of missing standard deviations
Standard deviations (SDs) of mean caries increment data were
missing in 12 of the 35 studies reporting D(M)FS data (Bastos
1989; DePaola 1977; Driscoll 1982; Finn 1975; Gallagher 1974;
Heidmann 1992; Laswell 1975; McConchie 1977; Moreira 1972;
Poulsen 1984; Ruiken 1987; van Wyk 1986). In the original ver-
sion of this review, we estimated unreported SDs from analysis of
the 179 available treatment arms for the series of topical fluoride
reviews with complete information (as of October 1999). This
resulted in a regression equation of log (SD caries increment) =
0.64 + 0.55*log (mean caries increment) (R2 = 77%). We used this
equation to estimate missing SDs from mean D(M)FS increments
for meta-analyses. Similarly, we used this same regression equation
to estimate missing SD data for three of the 13 trials reporting
D(M)FT data (Bastos 1989; Finn 1975; McConchie 1977).
Inflating standard errors for approximate analyses of cluster-
randomised trials
One cluster-randomised trial did not account for clustering of the
data in its reporting of results (Ruiken 1987). As we had already
incorporated this in the original review, accounting for clustering
through the inflated variance approach, we decided that the same
approach would be used and we would conduct sensitivity analy-
sis again to take account of additional uncertainty related to the
cluster-randomised trial. We inflated the variance of the prevented
fraction estimate by an amount equal to (1 + (m-1) * ICC), where
m is the average cluster size and ICC the intraclass correlation co-
efficient. A conservative value of 0.1 was used for the ICC because
we could not find an ICC from this or a similar trial at the time.
Effects on tooth surfaces of permanent dentition: D(M)FS
prevented fraction (PF)
For all 35 trials combined, the D(M)FS PF pooled estimate was
0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23 to 0.30; P value <
0.0001), suggestingalarge caries-preventive benefitfromthe use of
fluoride mouthrinse. The CIs are relatively narrow, and although
not substantial, heterogeneity in results could be observed statis-
tically (Chi2 = 58.43 on 34 degrees of freedom, P value = 0.006;
I2 = 42%; Analysis 1.1).
Metaregression and sensitivity analyses: D(M)FS PF
Univariate metaregression suggested no significant association be-
tween estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and prespecified
factors: baseline cariesseverity, backgroundexposure tofluoridated
water, background exposure to fluoride toothpaste, background
exposure to any fluoride source, fluoride concentration and rinsing
frequency. We noted an association of ’total intensity of applica-
tion per year’ (frequency times concentration) with the prevented
fraction, but this became non-significant when we excluded from
the analysis the trial of DePaola 1977, a study with high influence
(an outlier).
Further univariate metaregression analyses on other characteristics
not specified a priori showed no significant association between es-
timates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and type of control group
22

 (placebo/no treatment), dropout rate or length of follow-up (du-
ration of study in years). We have not investigated other potential
effect modifiers (e.g. mode of mouthrinse use) because virtually
all trials were conducted in school settings under supervision.
We have presented the results of random-effects meta-analyses of
D(M)FS PFs (all trials) in Additional Table 1. We have provided
metaregression results for all potential effect modifiers investigated
in Additional Table 2. It should be noted that we omitted the
influential study by DePaola 1977 from the analysis intensity of
application with prevented fraction. These metaregression results
must be interpreted with caution given the observational nature
of the comparisons and the large number of comparisons made.
To determine the potential influence of data imputation and ap-
proximation, we undertook a sensitivity analysis, restricting pool-
ing of trials to those that were fully reported and suitable for analy-
sis (23 trials). Results of this gave rise to a very similar D(M)FS PF
value to the one obtained as a result of the full meta-analysis (PF =
0.28, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.31), although a large reduction in the indi-
cator of heterogeneity (I2 = 19%) was evident. We also performed
a sensitivity analysis for the main meta-analysis of D(M)FS pre-
vented fraction to take account of additional uncertainty related
to the cluster-randomised trial by Ruiken 1987 after accounting
for clustering using the inflated variance approach. The D(M)FS
PF pooled estimate was 0.26 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.30; P value <
0.0001). These results are nearly identical to results of the anal-
ysis ignoring the cluster-randomised design because the estimate
for this trial is similar to the meta-analysis result, and altering its
weight has minimal effect.
We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding the three trials at
high risk of bias for allocation concealment (Bastos 1989; Moreira
1972; Moreira 1981) and excluding the eight trials at high or
unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment (Craig
1981; Finn 1975; Laswell 1975; Moberg Sköld 2005; Moreira
1981; Packer 1975; Ruiken 1987; Torell 1965). For allocation
concealment, results were equal to those of the full meta-analysis
(PF = 0.27, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.30) with some increase in the
indicator of heterogeneity (from 42% to 46%); for blind outcome
assessment, results showed similar PF values (PF = 0.26, 95% CI
0.22 to 0.30) and a somewhat increased indicator of heterogeneity
(from 42% to 48%).
We performed yet another sensitivity analysis by excluding one
trial (Spets-Happonen 1991) in which a non-fluoride active agent
was present in both fluoride and control groups, making the trial
different in this way from all others that had been included. The
D(M)FS PF pooled estimate resulting from exclusion of this trial
was identical to the analysis that includes it (PF = 0.27, 95% CI
0.23 to 0.30). This is a small trial that carries little weight and
had minimal effect in a meta-analysis that includes so many larger
studies.
Funnel plot and test for funnel plot asymmetry: D(M)FS PF
A funnel plot of the 35 included trials reporting D(M)FS PFs does
not look asymmetrical, and the weighted regression test for asym-
metry (Egger 1997) was not statistically significant (asymmetry
intercept: -0.69 (95% CI -1.89 to 0.50; P value = 0.24)). There-
fore, we found no evidence of bias when this method was used.
Effects on whole teeth of permanent dentition: D(M)FT PF
Thirteen trials reported data that allowed calculation of the
D(M)FT PF. We included all 13 studies in the analysis of D(M)FS
PF. Results of this analysis are similar to those reported above (for
D(M)FS PF).
The pooled estimate of D(M)FT PF was 0.23 (95% CI 0.18 to
0.29; P value < 0.0001), suggesting moderate to large benefit of
fluoride mouthrinse within relatively narrow CIs. Heterogeneity
between trials (Chi2 = 26.04 on 12 degrees of freedom, P value =
0.01; I² = 54%) was not substantial, although it was statistically
significant.
We have also presented results of the random-effects meta-analysis
of D(M)FT PFs (all 13 trials) in Additional Table 1.
Effects on primary tooth surfaces/teeth: d(e/m)fs/t PF
None of the included trials reported on caries increment in decid-
uous teeth/tooth surfaces (no data were available).
Effects of fluoride mouthrinse on other outcomes
A few trials report data for other relevant outcomes (see “Outcome
measures” under Description of studies). Some of these are simply
other measures/indices for dental caries increment in permanent
teeth/surfaces and require no further consideration. Three trials
reported on the proportion of children developing new caries. Re-
sults of meta-analyses for the proportion of children developing
new caries are presented below. The few trials that reported on
adverse effects give no useable (incomplete) data for analysis. Four
of the non-placebo controlled trials reported data for unaccept-
ability of treatment (as measured by dropouts in the no-treatment
control trials). We have described below results of meta-analyses
of these data.
Development of new caries: risk ratio
Three trials reported results on the proportion of children devel-
oping one or more new caries (Finn 1975; Heidmann 1992; Torell
1965). The pooled estimate (random-effects meta-analysis) of the
risk ratio was 0.77 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.29), with considerable het-
erogeneity in the results (Chi2= 54.59 on 2 degrees of freedom, P
value < 0.0001; I² = 96%).

 Not remaining caries-free
None of the trials reported data on the proportion of children not
remaining caries-free.
Tooth staining
The only trial reporting average stain scores per individual within
each group did not provide standard deviations (SDs), and data
could not be summarised as average mean differences (MDs) in
treatment effects with their 95% confidence intervals (Ringelberg
1979). Study authors reported a significant difference in stain score
from control (n = 44; mean score = 1.05) in the group using an
amine fluoride mouthrinse (n = 84; mean score = 3.57) and a non-
significant difference from control (n = 52; mean score = 0.31)
in the group using a sodium fluoride mouthrinse (n = 87; mean
score = 0.97), concluding that use of amine fluoride mouthrinse
resulted in the highest stain score.
Reporting on tooth staining was incomplete in two other trials,
where stannous fluoride mouthrinsing was tested against placebo
rinsing: In McConchie 1977, researchers stated that “some stain-
ing was observed in a very small number of children in the trial,
where approximately six children had tenacious staining that re-
quiredarubbercupprophylaxiscarriedout”, buttheydid notindi-
cate to which groups these children belonged. In Radike 1973, re-
searchers stated that “most of the participants who exhibited poor
oral hygiene had some amount of yellow pigmentation, somewhat
more noticeable in the children in the test group”.
Mucosal irritation/oral allergic reaction
One trial reported incompletely on oral soft tissue irritation/signs
of sensitivity (allergic reaction) to the rinse (Rugg-Gunn 1973);
these researchers described “no cases of mucosal hypersensitivity
after periodical examinations of every subject”.
Signs of acute toxicity
None of the studies reported adverse acute symptoms (nausea/
vomiting during treatment).
Unacceptability of treatment (dropouts/exclusions)
The pooled estimate of the risk ratio of dropping out from the
mouthrinse arm as opposed to the non-treatment arm in the four
non-placebo-controlled trials that reported dropouts (Craig 1981;
Moberg Sköld 2005; Moreira 1981; Torell 1965) was 1.33 (95%
CI 0.62 to 2.83). Heterogeneity was evident in these results (Chi
2 = 14.15 on 3 degrees of freedom, P value = 0.003; I² = 79%).

Summary of main results
We have presented the key findings in Summary of findings for
the main comparison.
The main aim of this review was to estimate the effects on dental
caries of using fluoride mouthrinse compared with placebo or no
treatment in children. More than 15,800 children were included
in the 37 trials comparing a fluoride mouthrinse against a placebo
or no treatment. For almost all children, the fluoride rinse they
received was a sodium fluoride (NaF) formulation, provided in
supervised school-based mouthrinsing programmes, often on a
daily or weekly/fortnightly basis. Fluoride mouthrinsing at these
two rinse frequencies and two main different strengths (230 ppm F
(fluoride concentration)/900ppmF)hasprovedaversatile method
of self applied topical fluoride use, and an effective method when
used regularly over time under supervision.
An average caries reduction in terms of decayed, missing and filled
tooth surfaces (DMFS) in permanent teeth of about 27% can be
expected from use of this method. The meta-analysis of the 35
studies assessing the effect of fluoride mouthrinse on the perma-
nent dentition suggests that this reduction falls within narrow con-
fidence intervals (23% to 30%).
A secondary aim of this review was to determine whether we could
find any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness
of fluoride mouthrinse and a number of factors, including the
initial level of caries severity, background exposure to fluoride and
fluoride concentration and frequency of use. We were unable to
detect a clear relationship between any of these factors and the
magnitude of the treatment effect in the metaregression analysis
performed in spite of substantial variation between trials in these
factors. This result should, however, be interpreted with caution.
Even a meta-analysis including 35 trials has limited power to detect
such relationships and, like all analyses of observational data, is
subject to the problem of potential confounding. In addition,
some factors such as ’background exposure to fluoride’ introduce
the problem of potential misclassification due to the poor quality
of reported data on exposure to fluoride other than in water. We
were forced to make several assumptions, for instance, classifying
’use of fluoride toothpaste’ for 16 of the studies on the basis of
the year when the study was conducted and its location. We were
also forced to treat this as a dichotomous variable (before/after
mid 1970s), although it is likely that use of fluoridated toothpaste
gradually increased during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Similarly,
we groupedexposure tofluoride intoothpaste andfluoride inwater
into a single dichotomous variable, which is likely to group studies
whose participantshadquite differentlevelsof baseline exposure to
fluoride sources. These problems may bias any estimates of effect
towards the null hypothesis. Nevertheless, these results suggest
that fluoride mouthrinse may still be of benefit after the advent of
fluoride toothpaste, and in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated
areas.
We did observe a significantly greater treatment effect with
increased total intensity (frequency times concentration) of
24

 mouthrinse application. Although plausible, this relationship was
dependent on the inclusion of one study with particularly pow-
erful effects (DePaola 1977). After exclusion of this study from
the analysis, we noted no significant association with this factor. It
should be noted that in most studies where mouthrinse was per-
formed once a week (or once every two weeks), a rinse employing
higher fluoride concentrations (usually 900 ppm F) was used (16
trials). Conversely, in most studies where rinsing was performed
once (or twice) a day, a lower fluoride concentration (usually 230
ppm F) was used (13 trials). Moreover, in six multi-arm studies in-
vestigating both combinations of concentrations-frequencies (and
in seven studies testing the two main fluoride concentrations),
we averaged this intensity score over fluoride treatment groups to
combine study results, a decision that may have slightly affected
this particular investigation of heterogeneity (and that of dose re-
sponse). Nevertheless, looking specifically at the effectiveness of
the two most commonly used fluoride mouthrinse regimens in-
dicates that few choices may be available when the weaker (low
concentration) is used as a daily rinse and the stronger (high con-
centration) as a weekly or fortnightly rinse. This does not nec-
essarily imply that when both concentrations are used daily, or
both are used as weekly/fortnightly rinses, they will have a similar
effect. A weaker solution may well yield poorer results when used
less frequently. More robust investigations of these aspects of the
intervention require direct, head-to-head comparisons of different
fluoride concentrations, frequencies and intensities, which were
not within the scope of this review.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The evidence included in the review pertains to caries in chil-
dren and adolescents, where all studies that met the review’s in-
clusion criteria examined the caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride
mouthrinse used in supervised school-based schemes on perma-
nent teeth, with only two studies also looking at unsupervised
home use of rinse, and none of the studies reporting data on the
primary dentition. We found most of the evidence in the school
setting where children were supervised when rinsing, although the
evidence may be applicable to other settings where children use
mouthrinsing under supervision or not.
Although there is clear evidence that fluoride mouthrinses have
a caries-inhibiting effect, we found little information about the
effects of fluoride mouthrinses on other outcomes such as the pro-
portion of children developing new caries, or on the acceptability
of a fluoride rinsing regimen. We found little useful information
about possible adverse effects of the procedure, such as tooth stain-
ing or oral soft tissue irritation/allergic reactions, and none of the
studies reported on signs of acute toxicity. This scarcity of direct
evidence from clinical trials on relevant outcomes other than den-
tal caries makes it more difficult for clinicians and policy makers to
weigh the benefits of fluoride mouthrinse use in preventing caries
against possible shortcomings of the procedure, whether provided
in community dental health programmes or in the home environ-
ment.
The trials included in this review used a variety of fluoride rinsing
frequencies, agents and concentrations. In studies with more than
one relevant intervention group and a common control group,
such as those comparing different active fluoride agents or concen-
trations of fluoride ions, or rinsing frequencies, against a placebo
group, we combined summary statistics from the studies (num-
ber of children analysed, mean caries increments, standard devi-
ations) from all relevant intervention groups to obtain a measure
of treatment effect. This enabled the inclusion of all relevant data
in the primary meta-analyses assessing the caries-inhibiting effect
of fluoride mouthrinsing on children’s permanent tooth surfaces,
but it has limited a secondary investigation of dose response.
The trials included in this review were conducted with participants
who were at differing levels of caries risk, as evidenced by the
variability of caries increments in the control groups, and who
were based in different locations with variability in background
exposure to other sources of fluoride.
The caries increment prevented fraction appeared to be consis-
tent across different populations, levels of caries risk and expo-
sure to other fluoride sources. The absolute benefit from fluoride
mouthrinse will, of course, depend on the expected caries incre-
ment in the target population. When the expected caries incre-
ment is small, the absolute benefit of fluoride mouthrinse will
be small. Moreover, the Cochrane review (Marinho 2003b) that
evaluated the effects of all main topical fluoride interventions for
preventing caries in children and adolescents found evidence that
the relative effect of topical fluoride may be greater in those who
have higher baseline levels of caries.
An important issue in this review is whether the body of evidence,
which consists of older studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s
mainly with participants who were probably not exposed to fluo-
ride toothpaste, is applicable today, when fluoridated toothpastes
are widely available and level of use is generally high. Among the
31 studies conducted in non-fluoridated areas, seven studies re-
ported substantial exposure to fluoride toothpaste (over 95%).
In this update, we included only one new study (Moberg Sköld
2005), which was carried out in Sweden in the early 2000s. The
prevented fractions (PFs) observed in this trial comparing various
rinsing frequencies against a no-treatment control group where
participants would have had lifetime use of fluoride toothpaste
pointed out a large effect, greater than the overall pooled result.
Again, the Cochrane review (Marinho 2003b) summarising all the
evidence on the effects of the main topical fluoride interventions
found no evidence that the effect of topical fluoride was dependent
on background exposure to other fluoride sources.
We have found little information about the adverse effects of fluo-
ride mouthrinse; only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) re-
ported data on tooth staining, concluding that use of amine flu-
oride mouthrinse resulted in a high stain score. Substantial infor-

 mation on a particular type of adverse effect (fluorosis) of topically
applied fluoride treatments (especially toothpaste) can be found in
a Cochrane review on topical fluoride and risk of fluorosis (Wong
2010).
Quality of the evidence
We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to assess
the quality of evidence for fluoride mouth rinses versus placebo or
no treatment.
In terms of methodological limitations of the studies, we assessed
none of the trials included in this review as having low risk of bias;
most (28) were at high risk of bias. The domain most commonly
found to be at high risk of bias was incomplete outcome data (at-
trition bias), followed by random sequence generation and allo-
cation concealment (selection bias), and blinding of participants
and personnel (performance bias). Moreover, all but one of the
included studies were published before the year 2000, most in the
1970s and 1980s, and most papers provided little information on
topics considered important for assessment of bias. This meant
that many of the trials included in the review were at ’unclear’ risk
of bias. Most studies conducted supervised mouthrinsing in the
school setting - this was considered for indirectness, but down-
grading was considered unnecessary because the evidence may be
applicable to other settings where children use mouthrinsing un-
der supervision or not.
For the primary outcome, we downgraded the quality of evidence
on caries increment on permanent tooth surfaces (DMFS) to mod-
erate quality because of limitations in study design across the 35
trials (15,813 participants) contributing data to this meta-analy-
sis. The size of the treatment effect for the effectiveness outcomes
(caries increment) was clinically important. For the same reason,
the quality of evidence for the caries-preventive effect on perma-
nent teeth (DMFT increment) based on 13 trials (5105 partici-
pants) was also moderate; we are moderately confident in the effect
estimate - the true effect is likely to be close to the effect estimate,
but there is a possibility that it could be different.
Only three studies reported on developing one or more new caries
(1805 participants). It is unclear whether the other studies mea-
sured this outcome; therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of
reporting bias. We also downgraded the quality of evidence owing
to high risk of bias in two of the three studies and owing to highly
inconsistent findings across studies. Therefore quality of evidence
for this outcome is very low. Our confidence in the effect estimate
is very limited, and further research is very likely to have an im-
portant impact and is likely to change this estimate.
The quality of the evidence for dropping out from the mouthrinse
as opposed to dropping out from the control condition (as an
indirect measure of treatment acceptability) was also very low.
The four studies (1700 participants) that contributed data to the
pooled results have serious limitations in their methods; all are at
high risk of bias. We downgraded further for imprecision because
of the small numbersof eventsandparticipants, which contributed
to the wide confidence intervals. Serious, unresolved heterogeneity
was also observed. Besides, it is unclear how this outcome is linked
to participants’ lack of acceptance of treatment.
The quality of the evidence on another two outcomes - risk of
tooth staining (three trials) and oral mucosal irritation (one trial) -
is very low, owing to very incomplete reporting and concerns about
risk of bias. Too little information was provided for assessment of
whether risk was increased with fluoridated mouthrinses.
Potential biases in the review process
We used a sensitive search strategy to identify trials for inclusion
in this review and placed no restrictions on publication status nor
language. We translated many references to determine whether or
not they included trials eligible for inclusion in this review.
We made a thorough attempt to investigate sources of heterogene-
ity in this review, examining factors related to participants and
interventions, as discussed above (Summary of main results), and
study methodological/design quality. None of the a priori specified
factors discussed above (initial caries levels, background exposure
to fluoride, frequency of use, fluoride concentration) was clearly
related to heterogeneity. When we looked for any relationship be-
tween the caries-preventive effectiveness of fluoride rinse and a few
other factors posed post hoc (length of follow-up, prior prophy-
laxis, dropout rate, type of control group), we found no significant
associations. Even though the type of control group (placebo/no
treatment) might represent a strong indicator of study quality and
source of heterogeneity in the topical fluoride reviews (Marinho
2015), we did not observe a relationship between type of con-
trol group and prevented fraction in this review, possibly because
only five non-placebo-controlled trials were included. Moreover,
it should be pointed out that we observed a generally high attrition
rate across fluoride rinse trials (mean of 32%). Overall only 65% of
all participants at the start remained at the end of the studies, and
results were often based on compliant participants who actually
completed the study. Thus, the issue of longer-term compliance
should not be disregarded when such a procedure is administered.
We performed a sensitivity analysis for the main meta-analysis to
take account of additional uncertainty we may have about the
cluster-randomised trial by Ruiken 1987. This produced results
(pooled DMFS PF) virtually identical to those of the analysis ig-
noring the cluster-randomised design because the estimate for this
trial is similar to that for the meta-analysis result, and altering its
weight has minimal effect. We also performed sensitivity analyses
for the main meta-analysis to take into account the uncertainty
that we had about imputations for missing standard deviations
and for inclusion of trials at high risk of bias for allocation conceal-
ment and for blinding of outcome assessment. These sensitivity
analyses showed results that were very similar, albeit with some
variation in levels of heterogeneity, to those of the full DMFS PF

 meta-analysis. The unchanged sensitivity analysis result obtained
for the key domain of allocation concealment was possibly due
to the fact that this process was generally poorly described in the
included studies.
A degree of funnel plot asymmetry may be suggested by visual
inspection (Figure 4), but the Egger test provided no evidence of
a significant relationship between trial size and effect estimate.

Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The general directionof findingspresentedis in keeping with those
of other reviews (e.g. Twetman 2004; Weyant 2013), which also
found evidence for the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinse.
The estimate of caries reduction in this review remains similar to
that reported in the meta-analysis on the caries-preventive effect
of fluoride mouthrinses in Twetman 2004, which found a pooled
D(M)FS PF estimate of 29% (95% confidence interval (CI) 14%
to 53%) reduction in caries increment for children with no addi-
tional fluoride exposure, although trials including children with
no background fluoride exposure (pooled results combining both
subsets not reported) found a PF of 6% (95% CI 0% to 30%). It is
also similar to that reported in the most recently published meta-
analysis (Weyant 2013), where treatment effects for 900 ppm F
mouthrinse solutions only were presented as pooled D(M)FS stan-
dardised mean differences (SMDs), and a pooled estimate of -0.26
(95% CI -0.40 to -0.13) was obtained (owing to the character of
D(M)FS data, mean caries increments are closely related to their
standard deviations).
Nevertheless, there were substantial differences in selection crite-
ria and methods between these reviews, and consequently in the
27

 numbers and types of studies included. Of the 21 studies included
in D(M)FS PF meta-analyses in the review by Twetman 2004, we
did not include five in this review. We identified and included 16
additional studies in this review, including one published after the
Twetman 2004 review (Moberg Sköld 2005).
As for the other review (Weyant 2013), of the eight studies
included in its D(M)FS SMD meta-analysis of 900 ppm F
mouthrinses, we included seven in this review; in the trial that
did not meet the inclusion criteria for our review (Chikte 1996),
we found no indication of random or quasi-random allocation,
and blind outcome assessment, also not stated or indicated, was
unlikely. We identified 10 additional studies testing 900 ppm F
mouthrinses for inclusion in this review - all published before the
Weyant 2013 review.
This updated Cochrane review includes one additional RCT
(Moberg Sköld 2005) compared with the previous version (
Marinho 2003). This included trial is not included in the reviews
mentioned above (Twetman 2004; Weyant 2013).
The large body of evidence contained in this updated Cochrane
review provides the best available evidence of the effectiveness
of fluoride mouthrinses compared with placebo or no treatment
(the comparative effectiveness of topical-fluoride interventions is
addressed in another review in this series (Marinho 2004)).

Implications for practice
This review found that supervised regular use of fluoride
mouthrinse by children and adolescents is associated with a large
reduction in caries increment in permanent teeth (the quality of
evidence is moderate). Compared with control groups, daily and
weekly/fortnightly supervised rinse programmes result on average
in 27% (95% CI 23 % to 30% reduction) fewer decayed, missing
or filled permanent tooth surfaces. Most of the evidence is from
studies that evaluated use of fluoride mouthrinse supervised in a
school setting, but the findings may be applicable to children in
other settings with supervised/unsupervised rinsing, although the
size of the caries preventive effect is less clear.
We found no evidence that this relative effect was dependent on
baseline caries level nor exposure to other fluoride sources, fluoride
concentration and mouthrinsing frequency, although this result
should be interpreted with caution. A higher decayed (missing)
and filled surface (D(M)FS) prevented fraction was shown with
increased intensity of application (frequency times concentration).
This relationship was dependent on the inclusion of one study
with particularly powerful effects.
In line with the findings for permanent tooth surfaces, regular
mouthrinsing with fluoride results on average in 23% (95% CI,
18% to 29%; I² = 54%) fewer decayed, missing or filled permanent
teeth (moderate quality evidence).
Unfortunately, the review does not provide useful information on
the likelihood of significant side effects with the use of fluoride
mouthrinse, and information on acceptability is inconclusive.
The evidence seems applicable to current clinical practice. Al-
though the evidence base for fluoride mouthrinse is derived mainly
from studies conducted when fluoridated toothpaste was not
widely available in the 1960s and 1970s, the eight trials from the
1980s and 1990s show no evidence of smaller treatment effects.
Implications for research
We have identified a large number of trials, but the reporting of the
trials included in this review is relatively poor, with many lacking
important methodological details. This is likely due in part to the
fact that most are relatively old. Many characteristics considered
crucial for excluding bias, such as clearly stated randomisation and
allocation concealment, have been more emphasised only in recent
years, after most of the mouthrinse trials were reported. However,
given the clarity of study results, additional randomised compar-
isons of fluoride mouthrinse and placebo alone would be difficult
to justify. Head-to-head comparisons of fluoride rinses and other
preventive strategies, and of different fluoride rinse application
features, may provide more useful information.
It is important that future trials include assessment of other rele-
vant outcomes such as potential adverse effects and those related to
acceptability of treatment. Planning and conducting an economic
analysis alongside the clinical trial could be considered. In addi-
tion, evaluation of possible differences in effect associated with flu-
oride rinse application features, such as frequency/concentration
of application, should be based on trials that directly compare such
features. Future trials should be well-designed RCTs (adequate se-
quence generation and allocation concealment methods, blinding
of participants and outcome assessors) reported according to the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) state-
ment (www.consort-statement.org). Researchers should use core
outcomes on assessment of caries and the impact of caries, which
may be available through the Core Outcome Measures in Effec-
tiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (www.comet-initiative.org).

“The children selected to be exposed to an
experimental measure were divided into 2
groups by assigning every other child in the
class register to one group; the remainder to
the other group. In these alphabetical regis-
ter the boys and the girls were entered sep-
arately. In this way, both groups comprised
an equal number of boys and girls”
Comment: not randomised. Alternation
used to allocate into groups
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
Comment: The non-random method (al-
ternation) used for sequence generation
would not allow for allocation conceal-
ment. However, because every child in the
class was assigned according to the ordering
in the class register (alphabetically), lack of
allocation concealment could not influence
assignment of participants

Reasons for losses: “main reasons were:
scholastic failure and changing of schools”
Comment: numbers lost unduly high for
length of follow-up, with no differential
losses between groups. Reasons for missing
outcome data are acceptable and balanced.

For the 2016 update, all members of the new review team decided on the updated methods to be used for this review. Valeria Marinho
(VM) and Lee Yee Chong (LYC) undertook study selection, data extraction, ’Risk of bias’ assessments and analyses. Tanya Walsh (TW)
and Helen Worthington (HW) provided advice when consulted throughout the update and undertook some of the extra analyses. VM
and LYC prepared the full review, and all review authors were active in its revision and approval.
For the original review, all four review authors contributed to the development of the protocol. VM wrote the protocol, conducted
searches, selected studies and extracted data. Julian Higgins duplicated study selection and data extraction in a sample of studies, and
Stuart Logan and Aubrey Sheiham were consulted when necessary. VM entered and analysed the data in consultation with Julian
Higgins. VM prepared the full review, and all review authors were active in its revision and approval.

In the 2016 update, we further defined outcomes for clarity. We also trimmed the list of outcomes to those more relevant to patients.
Information on use of healthcare service resources (such as visits to dental care units, length of dental treatment time) was not available
from the studies and will no longer be collected. These data have limited applicability across settings.
Other changes implemented in this update are the addition of a full ‘Risk of bias’ assessment and the development of a ‘Summary of
findings’ table for the primary outcomes in the review.
Finally, we made changes to the measures of effect used for the meta-analysis of some secondary outcomes, as well as changes to some
of the investigations of heterogeneity performed through metaregression and subgroup analyses and to investigations of sensitivity
analyses, including changes to the way a few co-variates were analysed in each. We have reported these changes and the rationale for
them in relevant sections of the review.
