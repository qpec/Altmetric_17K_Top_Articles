to synchronize parental care

The high energetic demand of parental care requires parents to direct their resources towards
the support of existing offspring rather than investing into the production of additional young.
However, how such a resource flow is channelled appropriately is poorly understood. In this
study, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the physiological mechanisms
coordinating parental and mating effort in an insect exhibiting biparental care. We show a
hormone-mediated infertility in female burying beetles during the time the current offspring is
needy and report that this temporary infertility is communicated via a pheromone to the male
partner, where it inhibits copulation. A shared pathway of hormone and pheromone system
ensures the reliability of the anti-aphrodisiac. Female infertility and male sexual abstinence
provide for the concerted investment of parental resources into the existing developing
young. Our study thus contributes to our deeper understanding of the mechanisms
underlying adaptive parental decisions.

amily life creates a venue for cooperation and conflict1,2.
Parents of many species cooperate to rear offspring, but
nevertheless there can be intense conflicts between males
and females over mating rate or how much each sex should invest
in raising the young. Moreover, due to the high energetic and
temporal costs of parental care, parents are ultimately faced with
the reproductive dilemma of whether to continue to invest into
the current offspring or to produce additional ones3. In general,
parental care, such as offspring guarding or provisioning
increases offspring lifetime reproductive success and thus can
enhance parental fitness4. Consequently, as long as the benefits to
the parents outweigh the costs of parental care, the decision
should be made in favour of the current brood. However,
the proximate mechanisms regulating resource flow into the
appropriate direction are poorly understood. Especially, in
mothers that provision their offspring with food, mechanisms
should exist that direct nutrients and energy either into feeding
the offspring or the development of new eggs/foetuses. Moreover,
the entire family might benefit from parents synchronizing their
sexual activity and only investing in costly matings when new or
additional offspring are to be produced but not during the period
of intensive parental care. However, coordination of parental and
mating effort requires effective communication systems as the
female needs to inform her male partner about whether she
intends to reproduce or care. Although cues and signals of
female receptivity or fertility are known to exist in some animal
species5, our current knowledge of whether and how sexual
activity and parental care is synchronized between partners is
very limited. Mammals are one animal taxon where at least
some information about the regulation of the resource trade-off
within females as well as coordination of sexual activity between
individuals is available. In many mammalian species, including
humans, mothers are characterized by a postnatal infertility
during the time of lactation6. The hormone prolactin secreted
during lactation appears to be one factor suppressing ovulation7,8.
Consequently, nutritional resources are allocated towards the
existing young as long as they are needed, instead of developing
new foetuses. In addition, many female mammals produce visual
(for example, changes in colouration and/or swelling of the skin
of the external genitalia) or chemical signals indicating the time of
fertility9,10. These signals might help to synchronize mating
activities, but also other functions have been discussed, especially
as these signals often do not reveal the exact time of ovulation and
do not necessarily coincide with the fertile phase11.
In insects, parental care including offspring provisioning has
evolved many times12, but it is unknown how the conflicting
energetic and nutritional demand of a current brood and sexual
activity, including the development of new eggs, is balanced. To
shed light on the physiological basis of parental investment
strategies as well as on how sexual activity and parental care is
coordinated between breeding partners, we studied burying
beetles.
These
beetles
are
a
prime
example
of
insects
performing elaborate biparental care13–16 and are known for
their
complex
recognition
and
communication
systems17.
Burying beetles reproduce on small dead vertebrates and feed
their developing young with pre-digested carrion food. The larvae
of the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides beg for food until
about 3 days after hatching18. Afterwards they continue to feed
independently on the carrion. The benefits of parental care in N.
vespilloides are substantial. Not only larval survival rate but also
larval mass at dispersal are significantly increased in broods
receiving parental care compared with broods without parental
attendance19. Particularly larval mass at dispersal is a measure of
offspring quality, because it is highly correlated with adult body
size which in turn enhances the effectiveness of securing a carcass
needed for reproduction20,21. Hence, mothers are predicted to
allocate their energy and nutritional resources into their existing
larvae as long as they are needy instead of investing into the
production of new eggs. Also time- and energy-consuming sexual
activity distracting both parents from caring for their offspring
should be avoided during this crucial time period of offspring
feeding. Reliably communicating the reproductive status of the
female to the male partner would therefore be advantageous for
both parents and offspring.
The objectives of the current study were to investigate (1) how
the resource trade-off between caring for current offspring and
producing additional ones is regulated in females, (2) whether
females
signal
their
reproductive
state
to
facilitate
the
coordination of sexual activity and parental care and (3) how
the signal is reliably linked to fertility. Our first experiments
addressed the question whether the fertility of female burying
beetles is—similar to mammals—depressed during the time of
offspring feeding and if this transient infertility is mediated by a
hormone. Therefore, we determined egg production, hormone
profiles and gene expression pattern of offspring provisioning and
non-feeding females and manipulated the females’ hormone titres
experimentally. We demonstrate that females’ fertility is indeed
temporarily depressed when caring for nutritionally dependent
larvae and this infertility is directly or indirectly linked to juvenile
hormone (JH). In a previous study Engel et al.22 have shown that
during the time of intensive offspring tending males desist from
mating with their female partner. This observation and the
finding that breeding females release a volatile chemical23 led us
to the hypothesis that females produce a chemical signal linked to
hormone production to coordinate sexual activity during periods
of parental care. By conducting quantitative chemical analyses, we
show that the emission of the volatile methyl geranate coincides
with the presence of nutritionally dependent larvae and high JH
levels. We further reveal that methyl geranate and JH production
are linked via a shared pathway implying that females advertise
their
hormonal
and
therefore
reproductive
state.
Finally,
by means of electrophysiology and behavioural assays we
demonstrate that methyl geranate serves as an antiaphrodisiac
inhibiting male mating attempts. Overall, our results uncover
mechanisms underlying parental care decisions, and illustrate
how a physiological interplay between hormone and pheromone
systems guarantees that both parents draw their attention towards
the existing young as long as they are needy.
Results
Egg production and JH III during parental care. To investigate
whether oviposition is suppressed during provisioning of young,
we provided females under three different parenting conditions
with a new carcass to determine whether egg laying can be
triggered. Females of the first treatment group (without larvae)
had been allowed to lay eggs, but then were denied access to their
larvae before they were provided with a new carcass (see
Methods). Consequently, these females represented mothers that
did not engage in offspring provisioning. Females of the second
treatment group (old larvae) were caring for old, and already
nutritionally independent larvae (4 days after hatching), when
given a new carcass. Although these females had larvae, they also
represented non-feeding mothers. Females of the third treatment
group (young larvae) were caring for nutritionally dependent
larvae (1 day after hatching; Fig. 1a) when a new carcass was
provided. Hence, those females represented offspring provision-
ing mothers. Consistent with our hypothesis, mothers who were
denied access to their larvae as well as mothers caring for older
and already nutritionally independent larvae responded to the
new carcass with egg laying (Fig. 1b). In contrast, in the majority
of mothers with access to their newly hatched and therefore

 needy larvae oviposition was significantly suppressed (w2-test,

Juvenile hormone III (JH III), a multifunctional hormone of
insects, is well known to regulate female fertility by controlling
the biosynthesis of vitellogenin (Vg) and its uptake by the
growing oocyte24. JH III has been found to be elevated during
parental care in the nearctic burying beetle N. orbicollis15,25, but
its function remained unclear. In ants26,27, wasps28 and bees29
very high titres of JH or its analogues repress ovarian activity. We
thus hypothesized that high JH III levels are associated with
offspring feeding as well as suppression of ovarian activity and
offspring production in N. vespilloides females. We indeed found
that the JH III titres of mothers increased to very high levels
directly after the hatching of their larvae (Fig. 1c; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Corresponding to previous findings in N. orbicollis30,
JH III peaked when offspring begging and provisioning is known
to be most intense (24 h after hatching, day 4 in the breeding
cycle)18,31, while it declined to pre-hatching levels when larvae
can feed independently from the carrion resource (72 h after
hatching, day 6 in the breeding cycle)18. In contrast, mothers
whose larvae hatched but were experimentally prevented from
accessing their offspring had significantly lower JH III titres and
never reached the high levels of provisioning mothers (Fig. 1c;
Supplementary Fig. 1). Sixty-six per cent of these females
resumed egg laying, in contrast to zero per cent of offspring
provisioning mothers. To verify the link between JH III and
ovarian activity, we analysed the expression pattern of genes
associated with JH biosynthesis/regulation and ovarian activity.
Consistent with our prediction, offspring-provisioning mothers
showed significantly higher expression of genes associated with

 JH III synthesis but lower expression of genes involved in JH
degradation and egg production than non-provisioning mothers,
whose larvae were withheld (Fig. 1d). Moreover, when females
were treated with pyriproxyfen (PPN), a potent JH analogue29,
reproduction was significantly reduced, and females treated with
PPN produced fewer offspring than control females (Fig. 1e).
Consequently, our results strongly suggest that needy larvae
stimulate high JH levels in brood-caring mothers, which directly
or indirectly lead to oviposition suppression.
Linking hormone and pheromone production. During the time
when the offspring are still needy, not only egg production but
also costly male mating attempts distracting both parents from
caring for offspring should be avoided. Copulations, for example,
might
divert
the
attention
from
protecting
the
offspring
against enemies and restrain from offspring feeding. Therefore,
reliably signalling their hormonal state to the male should be
advantageous for females. Fathers in turn should respond to the
signal by ceasing sexual activities, as they do not gain any benefits
from copulating during the female’s period of infertility. An
excellent candidate for such a reliable signal is methyl geranate,
a volatile that has been shown to be emitted by breeding females
but has been studied hitherto only in the context of partner
recognition23. Methyl geranate is structurally related to JH III
(Fig. 2a) and has been hypothesized to share the same
biosynthetic pathway as the hormone, although experimental
evidence is missing23. To test for a functional linkage of the
hormone system and methyl geranate biosynthesis, we injected
deuterium-labelled geranyl pyrophosphate32, a known precursor
of JH III in insects33 and putative key component in the
postulated shared pathway (Fig. 2a), into offspring-provisioning
females.
Subsequent
headspace
analyses
revealed
that
injected females emitted deuterium-labelled methyl geranate
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Consequently, the volatile substance is
indeed a suitable candidate for reliably reflecting the female’s
hormone level and therefore her reproductive state, as it shares
the same metabolic pathway with the hormone. In fact, when
measuring JH III levels and released methyl geranate quantities of
females during an entire breeding cycle, we found a strong
correlation between the hormone and the volatile substance
(Pearson correlation, N ¼ 332, r ¼ 0.5, Po0.0001). In females
caring for larvae, methyl geranate emission tightly followed JH
levels and peaked along with the hormone titre at the time when
offspring begging and feeding is known to be most intense
(Fig. 2b). In contrast, mothers who were denied access to their
larvae emitted little or no methyl geranate (Fig. 2b). Furthermore,
methyl geranate emission closely matched the observed mating
pattern during a breeding cycle22. Males discontinue mating with
mothers during the time of offspring provisioning but do not stop
mating with females whose larvae had been withheld and
therefore resume egg laying22. To further confirm that methyl
geranate reliably reflects the female’s reproductive state, we
exploited the fact that females are less likely to resume egg laying
the more offspring they have to care for. An earlier study found
that one larva prevented about 20% of the mothers from
producing
a
new
clutch,
and
more
larvae
prevented
a
significantly higher percentage34. Consequently, we manipulated
the amount of larvae a female had to care for and quantified
methyl geranate emission. Indeed, methyl geranate quantity
reliably reflected oviposition probability: the more larvae the
mother had to care for, the higher was the amount of methyl

Function of methyl geranate as anti-aphrodisiac. Having
established that methyl geranate reliably reflects hormone
level and consequently the reproductive state of females, we
further evaluated its putative function as an anti-aphrodisiac,
a chemical substance that inhibits copulation35,36. Using gas
chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection
(GC-EAD), we found that male antennae respond to synthetic
methyl geranate (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we observed the
copulation behaviour of pairs of breeding N. vespilloides with
and without larvae for 90 min and quantified the methyl geranate
emitted by the females. Consistent with our expectation, we
found that the more methyl geranate was emitted by a female, the
lower was the probability that a male copulated with her (Fig. 3b).
In addition, the number of copulations performed was dependent
on the amount of methyl geranate emitted and females with lower
amounts of methyl geranate received more copulations than
females with higher amounts of methyl geranate (Poisson GLM,
N ¼ 31, Wald-w2
1;29 ¼ 7.7, P ¼ 0.006; Supplementary Fig. 3). To
verify the function of methyl geranate as an anti-aphrodisiac, we
established a bioassay in which females were equipped with a
septum emitting synthetic methyl geranate (430 ng±57.8 ng per
20 min; corresponds to four female equivalents based on the
maximum measured emission) fixed on their pronotum (Fig. 3c).
Control females also carried a septum that was treated with the
pure solvent. In agreement with our prediction, male copulation
activity was significantly decreased by methyl geranate emission
(methyl geranate: 23.08% copulating males, solvent control:
78.57% copulating males; w2-test, N ¼ 27, w2
1;25 ¼ 8.3, P ¼ 0.004;
number of copulations; Fig. 3c).
Two female burying beetles attracted to the same carcass
usually fight over its possession. On relatively large carcasses,
however, joint breeding can occur and the females cooperate in
providing parental care37. To corroborate that the primary
function of methyl geranate is to deter males from copulating, we
quantified methyl geranate released by mothers in female/female
and female/male couples breeding on a large carcass. In fact, the
sex of the breeding partner had a significant effect on methyl
geranate emission. When breeding with a male partner, females
emitted significantly higher amounts of methyl geranate than
when breeding with a female (Fig. 3d). Consequently, this result
confirms the idea that methyl geranate specifically evolved to
function as an anti-aphrodisiac.
Discussion
In insects, post-hatching parental care has evolved independently
in at least 10 different orders38, but little is known about the
physiological mechanisms underlying parental care and intra-
familial interactions. Here, we specifically addressed fundamental
questions about how the trade-off between care for current

 offspring and the production of new eggs is physiologically
regulated and how mating and parental effort is synchronized
between breeding partners.
Our first key finding was that oviposition is suppressed when
offspring fitness crucially depends on parental feeding, but that
females resume egg laying if they have no access to their larvae or
if larvae are already nutritionally independent. Furthermore,
hormonal profiles, expression pattern of genes involved in
hormone biosynthesis and egg production, and the result of
hormonal
treatment
strongly
suggest
that
JH
III
is
the
physiological key factor responsible for the reported temporary
suppression of fertility and for the maintenance of parental care
behaviour. The exact mode of action of JH III is not yet known,
but we suggest two possible mechanisms: In many female insects,
JH appears to be a critical factor modulating Vg biosynthesis in
the fat body and its uptake by the growing oocytes. Although JH
III has often been found to function as gonadotropic hormone
stimulating Vg production39,40, there are also examples where
very high titres supress Vg biosynthesis28,29. The fact that in our
study Vg genes were significantly downregulated at the same time
as JH III levels were drastically increased, but upregulated at
lower
JH
levels,
supports
this
hypothesis.
An
alternative
explanation is that JH III indirectly represses egg production by
diverting energy and nutrients away from reproduction and
towards parental care, especially towards predigestion of food and
its regurgitation to offspring. Such a novel role of JH III in
meeting the high energy demands of parental care has been
previously
suggested
by
several
authors25,41,42.
However,
irrespective of whether JH directly or indirectly causes a
suppression of fertility, the outcome is the same: energy and
nutrients which would otherwise have been invested in egg
development are now available for tending the current offspring.
Such a hormonally-induced infertility during the time of
offspring feeding is strongly reminiscent of the lactational
amenorrhea in female mammals. Here, the hormone prolactin
appears to simultaneously stimulate milk production and parental
behaviour in mothers and to inhibit ovulation7,8. Considering
these parallels between mammals and social beetles, we might
hypothesize that a hormone-mediated transient infertility is a
general scheme in non-seasonal breeding animals that feed their
offspring.
Due
to
the
fact
that
we
carefully
synchronized
and
standardized all the broods, we could show that it is the young
larvae that trigger the high rise in JH levels. This finding is also
supported by an earlier study in N. orbicollis, where a continuous
supply of first instar larvae led to a prolonged period of high JH
titre25. Currently, we can only speculate about the exact nature of
the stimulus that prompts JH production. In mammals, including
humans, it appears that it is the frequency of the suckling
stimulus of the pups/babies that induces and maintains prolactin
secretion43–45. In burying beetles, larvae show a specialized
begging behaviour, in which they rear up and wave their legs,
thereby touching the parents’ mouthpart to obtain food46,47.
Consequently, these mechanical cues might trigger JH III
production and release. Interestingly, studies on honey bees
have shown that the pheromone (E)-b-ocimene, produced
by young larvae, not only accelerates the onset of foraging
behaviour in workers48,49, but also inhibits the workers’ ovary
development50. Therefore, we suggest that future studies should
compare the chemicals released by young and old burying beetle
larvae, as substances might be involved that either act as an
honest signal of hunger state or as a primer pheromone inducing
JH production and therefore a repressed fertility in mothers.
Certainly, if a primer pheromone is involved that directly affects
the mother’s JH titre, offspring may gain substantial control over
maternal care, influencing the mothers’ trade-off between current
and future reproduction51. Irrespective of the nature of the
stimulus, our data also indicate that the response of the mother is
threshold dependent, as one larva is sometimes not enough to
trigger sufficient JH III to suppress egg production (see also
ref. 34). Furthermore, our findings shed new light on the
infanticide committed by male burying beetles after having taken
over the brood chamber of a resident couple52. By killing the
offspring sired by the previous male, the intruder hastens his own
reproduction, given that the resident mother would not resume
production of new eggs as long as the stimulus coming from
nutritionally dependent larvae is present. Again, this adaptation
finds its parallels in mammals53.
The second key finding of our study was that females
communicate their JH titre, and therefore their reproductive
state, to their male partner, thereby influencing male social
behaviour during parental care. In general, fertility5,54–57 or
infertility signals58–60 are common among females across animal
taxa, from insects to reptiles and mammals, but for the vast
majority of species the physiological processes linking fertility/
infertility and the communicational signal are unknown. An
exception are some teleost fish, in which it has been shown that
steroid hormones or derivatives of the hormones responsible for
oocyte
maturation
act
as sex
pheromones,
inducing
milt
production in males61,62. However, in contrast to aquatic
environments where high-molecular-weight substances such as
numerous hormones can directly function as attractants, in
terrestrial environments pheromone molecules must normally be
volatile and therefore of lower molecular mass. Here we report
the mechanism explaining the link between fertility and a
chemical signal in a brood-caring beetle. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time such a linkage has been found in
an insect. Using a stable isotope-labelling experiment, we revealed
that the pheromone methyl geranate derives from the same
biosynthetic pathway as the hormone modulating fertility.
The shared pathway therefore provides an explanation for how
the reliability of the communication system is maintained, as the
pheromone can only be produced if the mevalonate pathway, the
fundamental pathway of hormone biosynthesis, runs at a high
level. This has further implications for our understanding of the
evolution of communication systems. Within the framework of
sexual selection, it has been previously suggested that one way of
how condition-dependent ornament expression is linked to an
animal’s condition is by a shared pathway of ornament
production and vital biochemical processes63.
In a previous study, we have found that male N. vespilloides
copulate frequently in the beginning of a breeding attempt, stop
mating as soon as young larvae are present, but resume mating
when larvae are nutritionally independent22. Furthermore, males
never cease to mate if larvae do not arrive at the carcass to be
fed22. Our current study unravels the mechanism underlying the
observed male mating behaviour: the female-produced methyl
geranate acts as anti-aphrodisiac, inhibiting male copulation
behaviour. The methyl geranate emission profile of breeding
females matches the males’ mating behaviour remarkably well
and our behavioural assay using synthetic methyl geranate
conclusively shows that males respond to the volatile by
becoming sexually inactive. Overall, empirical and theoretical
considerations suggest that female fitness is maximized at a lower
mating rate than male fitness, giving rise to a sexual conflict over
mating rate64. For female burying beetles, about two mating
events are sufficient to fertilize all their eggs, and none of the
many experiments conducted so far could find any benefits for
females of repeated or multiple mating65,66. In view of this, and of
the fact that studies found substantial costs of mating to females
in a wide range of animal groups67, we can assume that the high
mating rate of N. vespilloides in the beginning of a reproductive

 bout is not in the interest of the female68. Such a sexual conflict
over mating rate would also exist during the periods of offspring
feeding, but due to the temporary infertility of the female there is
a sudden concurrence of interests between the breeding partners.
However, only thanks to the evolution of a reliable signal of
reproductive state could the common interests of both parents be
realized. We believe that methyl geranate is an important
component of family life in burying beetles, as it allows the
coordination of sexual activity and parental care. As mating
consumes time and energy and distracts from feeding and
defending the young, these chemical signal also benefits the
offspring.
Our final experiment with the two jointly breeding females
corroborates our hypothesis that the primary function of methyl
geranate is to deter male copulations, as it is only released in high
quantities by mothers breeding with a male but not with a female
partner. Previous studies have demonstrated that male and female
burying beetles can recognize their breeding partner and
distinguish them from non-breeding infanticidal intruders69,70.
Methyl geranate is one chemical component of the odour bouquet
males use for partner recognition23. However, Steiger17 already
hypothesized that it is unlikely that this is the main function of
methyl geranate, as it is only emitted by females, while the partner
recognition mechanisms work reciprocally for both sexes. On the
basis of the results of the present study, we conclude that the
signal evolved as an anti-aphrodisiac. Because breeding females
release methyl geranate at a certain point of their breeding cycle,
it is—during the process of template updating—incorporated into
the male’s recognition template used for discriminating between
their own partner and female intruders. Finally, the fact that
females can adjust their methyl geranate emission according to
their social environment irrespective of their own physiological
condition suggests that the volatile is not an inadvertent
by-product of juvenile hormone synthesis, but rather that its
production and/or release can be switched on and off adaptively.
This does not compromise the reliability of the signal, as the
prerequisite of pheromone production is an active mevalonate
pathway, which might necessarily lead to a high JH titre.
In conclusion, our study allows novel insights into the
physiological mechanisms underlying parental decisions. Similar
to non-seasonal mammals, a physiological interplay between the
hormone and communication systems guarantees that parents do
not invest in costly sexual activity or the development of new
offspring as long as the existing young are nutritionally
dependent. However, in contrast to many mammalian species,
where females appear to communicate periods of fertility, that is,
the time close to ovulation, burying beetles broadcast their
temporary infertility during the period of intensive parental care.
The emission of an anti-aphrodisiac reliably reflecting a female’s
hormonal state facilitates a synchronization of mating events
between the sexes and ensures that parental attention is directed
towards the developing young.
Methods
Insects. Experimental N. vespilloides animals were the first- to fourth-generation
offspring of beetles collected from carrion-baited pitfall traps in a deciduous forest
near the University of Ulm, Germany (48� 250 N, 09� 570 E). Beetles were
maintained in temperature-controlled chambers at 20 �C with a 16:8 h light:dark
cycle. Before the experiments, groups of up to five adults of the same sex and family
were kept in small plastic containers (10 � 10 cm and 6 cm high) filled with moist
peat and fed freshly decapitated mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) twice a week. At the
time of experiments all experimental animals were virgin, between 20 and 40 days
old and not related to each other within a specific treatment group of an
experiment.
General experimental design. All experimental beetles, unless otherwise stated,
were handled as follows: non-related males and females were placed pairwise in
plastic containers (10 � 10 � 6 cm) half-filled with moist peat and provided with a
mouse carcass (10, 20 or 430 g, depending on the experiment; Ma
¨u-Ra Farm,
Radensleben, Germany). Once the carcass was buried, the containers were kept in
darkness and all following manipulations were performed under red light. After
48 h the beetles and their carcass were transferred to a new container. The old
container was provided with a small piece of mouse. As larvae crawl towards the
carrion immediately after hatching, this procedure allowed us to determine the
time when a pair’s larvae began to hatch. Embryonic development takes, on
average, 56 h at 20 �C (ref. 34). We first checked for the presence of larvae 64 h after
the adults had been provided with a carcass and every 6 h thereafter. As soon as the
first larva was observed, the parents were transferred to a new box and a
standardized number of first-instar larvae were placed on or near the carcass to be
fed by the adults. The standardization of larval number allowed us to control for
effects of brood size on parental physiology or care behaviour71. All experiments
were performed in temperature-controlled chambers at 20 �C.
Oviposition and offspring provisioning. To test whether non-feeding mothers
oviposit, whereas mothers caring for needy larvae do not engage in egg laying, we
randomly assigned experimental females to three different treatment groups. All
experimental females were provided with a male partner and a 10-g carcass, but
after a specific time the old carcass was replaced by a fresh carcass. This was done
to test whether a new carcass triggers oviposition or not. Females of one treatment
group (old larvae) were allowed to care for 10 of their larvae for 4 days before we
exchanged carcasses (the larvae remained with the female). At this point in their
development, larvae are already nutritionally independent18. In the two other
treatment groups, carcasses were exchanged after the larvae started to hatch, but
only females of one group (young larvae) received 10 freshly hatched larvae to care
for; such larvae are needy and are fed by the females. Females of the other group
(without larvae) did not receive any larvae and therefore were not able to engage in
offspring provisioning. After having exchanged the carcasses, females were left
undisturbed for a specific amount of time to give them a chance to discover the
new carcass and to produce new eggs. Females usually begin to oviposit about 12 h
after carcass detection72 and the mean duration of egg-laying period is about 30 h
(refs 34,73). Forty-eight hours after carcass exchange, beetles along with the new
carcass were transferred to new containers and the old containers were searched for
eggs. This was done by scanning the peat of the old container manually, as the
white eggs are easy to detect in the dark background of the peat. The procedure of
transferring the beetles along with their carcasses to a new container and searching
for new eggs was repeated a second time with any pairs that had not laid any eggs
during the first period. We used a w2-test to test for differences in oviposition
events between treatment groups. Pairwise comparisons were corrected following
the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure74. This and all further statistical analysis were
done using SPSS 19 (IMB SPSS Statistics, Germany).
JH III and methyl geranate profile during a breeding cycle. To gain insight into
the pheromonal and hormonal profiles of the female during an entire breeding
cycle (B9 days), N. vespilloides females (N ¼ 387) were randomly assigned to two
treatment groups (‘with larvae’, ‘without larvae’), each consisting of 10 subgroups
(see Supplementary Table 1 for sample size of each subgroup). Each subgroup
represents a day in the breeding cycle (day 0–day 9). Experimental females were
provided with a male partner and a 10-g mouse carcass. Pairs from the treatment
group ‘with larvae’ were allowed to care for 10 of their own and therefore related
larvae; in the treatment group ‘without larvae’, larvae were withheld from their
parents to force females to resume egg laying. Each female was subjected once to
volatile (‘headspace analysis’, see below) and haemolymph collection (see below) at
a pre-designated time. Females of the subgroup ‘day 0’ were sampled before carcass
introduction. The females of the next groups (‘day 1’ and ‘day 2’) were sampled and
48 h after they had been provided with a carcass. Females of the subgroups ‘day 3’
were sampled at the time of larval hatching, which is not necessarily 72 h after
carcass provisioning, as egg laying and consequently larval hatching does not occur
in perfect synchrony between different breeding pairs. Females of all subsequent
subgroups were sampled 24 h (day 4), 48 h (day 5) and so on, after the larvae of the
respective female had hatched (for example, if larvae of a female of the subgroups
‘day 7’ hatched at 06:00, sampling took place 96 h later at 06:00). We chose this
non-repeated measurement design as it is very likely that haemolymph collection
has an effect on subsequent female behaviour and physiology. Therefore, all beetles
were freeze-killed after haemolymph collection.
After headspace sampling (see below), each female was weighed and all her
haemolymph was collected. Haemolymph samples were obtained by piercing the
intersegmental membrane between pro- and mesothorax with a fine cannula and
aspirating the oozed haemolymph into a calibrated glass capillary. After
quantifying the volume, the haemolymph was transferred to a 1.5-ml cone-shaped
glass vial by blowing nitrogen through the capillary. An amount of 100 ml hexane
containing 20 ng of vernolic acid methyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen,
Germany) as an internal standard was added to the vial. The mixture was vortexed
for 30 s and the clear hexane phase was transferred to a new vial, concentrated
to a volume of 25 ml and subjected to size exclusion high performance liquid
chromatography (SE-HPLC) for cleaning. SE-HPLC settings and all further steps
for quantifying JH III, including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis
and calibration, were performed following the protocol described in ref. 75. We
used Gaussian GLMs to test for effects of treatment and day on methyl geranate

 emission and JH level and a Pearson correlation to test for relationship between
pheromone and hormone levels. As we measured the absolute amount of methyl
geranate emitted by an individual, we also used the absolute amount of JH per
individual for statistical analyses. However, as studies usually provide hormone
titres, we additionally calculated JH titres (ng JH III per ml haemolymph;
Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we calculated the proportion of females that
resumed egg laying. Because females were freeze-killed subsequent to the
treatment, we could only consider females whose larvae had already hatched (day 4
to day 9). To determine whether a female had resumed egg laying, we counted the
number of larvae in the treatment group with larvae; in the treatment group
without larvae, females were transferred every 48 h to a new box and the old box
was checked daily for newly hatched larvae.
RNA isolation. RNA was extracted from females that had been caring for 10 larvae
for 24 h (corresponds to the treatment group ‘with larvae, day 4’, Fig. 1b) and
females whose larvae had hatched 24 h earlier, but were not allowed to care for
their larvae (corresponds to the treatment group ‘without larvae, day 4’; Fig. 1b;
each N ¼ 3). Individual beetles (a single female per biological replicate per
treatment) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with a mortar and pestle,
and total RNA was extracted from a fraction of the powdered material, using
TriReagent (Molecular Research Centre, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and further
purified using the DirectZol Kit (Zyme Research) following the manufacturers’
guidelines. The integrity of the RNA was verified using an Agilent 2,100
Bioanalyzer and a RNA 6,000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
The quantity of RNA was determined using a Nanodrop ND-1,000 UV/Vis
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
Illumina sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing of each of the six RNA samples
(two different female samples with three biological replicates each) was performed
with RNA fragmented to an average of 150 nucleotides. Sequencing was carried out
by the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne (MPGCC) on an Illumina HiSeq2500
Genome Analyzer platform using paired-end (2 � 100 bp) read technology. This
yielded B25–28 million reads for each of the six samples, respectively. Quality
control measures, including the filtering of high-quality reads based on the score
given in fastq files, removal of reads containing primer/adaptor sequences and
trimming of read length, were carried out using CLC Genomics Workbench v6.5
(http://www.clcbio.com).
Transcriptome assembly and annotation. The de novo transcriptome assembly
was carried out with the same software, combining all of the six RNAseq samples,
and selecting the presumed optimal consensus transcriptome as described in
ref. 76. Any conflicts among the individual bases were resolved by choosing the
base with highest frequency. Contigs shorter than 250 bp were removed from
the final analysis. The resulting final de novo reference transcriptome assembly
(backbone) of N. vespilloides contained 55,934 contigs with a N50 contig size of
954 bp and a maximum contig length of 18,454 bp. The transcriptome was
annotated using BLAST, Gene Ontology and InterProScan searches using
BLAST2GO PRO v2.6.1 (www.blast2go.de)77 as described in ref. 76.
Digital gene expression analysis. Digital gene expression analysis was carried out
by using QSeq Software (DNAStar Inc.) to remap the Illumina reads from all six
samples onto the reference transcriptome and then counting the sequences to
estimate expression levels, using previously described parameters for read mapping
and normalization76. Biases in the sequence data sets and different transcript sizes
were corrected using the RPKM algorithm (reads per kilobase of transcript per
million mapped reads) to obtain correct estimates for relative expression levels.
To control for the effect of global normalization using the RPKM method, we also
analysed a number of highly conserved housekeeping genes, including several genes
encoding ribosomal proteins (rpl3, rpl5, rpl9, rpl22e, rps3a, rps5, rps8, rps18 and
rps27), elongation factor 1alpha and eukaryotic translation initiation factors 4
and 5. The overall expression levels across samples and treatments for these
housekeeping genes was lower than 1.3-fold between samples (based on log2
transformed RPKM values), indicating they were not differentially expressed.
Transcript abundances of genes of the different treatment groups were compared
using a Student’s t-test with multiple testing correction using FDR (Benjamini and
Hochberg) as implemented in the QSeq Software.
Pyriproxyfen treatment. PPN is a potent JH analogue, which mimics the effects
of JH but is metabolically more stable. We applied 5 mg PPN (Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) dissolved in 2 ml acetone topically on the intersegmental
membrane between pro- and mesothorax of female beetles. The control group was
treated with 2 ml acetone only. Afterwards females were provided with a 10-g
mouse carcass in a box filled with peat to trigger oviposition. After 24 h, the
PPN/acetone procedure was repeated. Two days after carcass provisioning the
parents were removed and newly hatched larvae counted until hatching ceased.
The total amount of applied PPN was similar to the amount used in other
studies26,29. To test whether the treatment (PPN versus control) had an effect on
the number of offspring produced, we performed a Poisson GLM.
Effect of brood size on methyl geranate emission. Pairs of N. vespilloides beetles
were provided with a 20-g mouse carcass and allowed to care for 1, 5, 10 or 20
larvae, respectively. After caring for larvae for 24 h, the number of surviving larvae
was counted and the females were subjected to headspace analyses. To be able to
provide each experimental pair with the planned number of larvae, we additionally
provided a large number of N. vespilloides pairs with a 10-g mouse carcass, and use
these pairs as ‘larvae donors’78. A Gaussian GLM was performed with the number
of larvae as fixed factor and the amount of methyl geranate as dependent variable.
Deuterium labelling experiment. To test whether the production of JH III and
methyl geranate is physiologically linked via the mevalonate pathway33 (Fig. 2),
we injected a deuterium-labelled geranyl pyrophosphate precursor32,79
((E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl-2-d diphosphate, [2-2H]-GPP, kindly provided
by W. Boland, Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany; see
Supplementary Fig. 2) into the body cavity of brood-caring N. vespilloides females.
Geranyl pyrophosphate is a well-known metabolic precursor of JH III33. Pairs of
beetles were provided with a 10-g mouse carcass and left undisturbed until we
started to control for larval hatching. After the beetles had cared for their larvae for
up to 13 h, the female was removed and subjected to [2-2H]-GPP injection. We
injected 10 mg [2-2H]-GPP per female diluted in 1 ml distilled water either into the
abdomen, into the intersegmental membrane between pro- and mesothorax, or
into the ventral cervical membrane using a pointed glass microcapillary, which was
mounted to a micromanipulator and connected to a model 2010 Nanoliter Injector
(World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). After injection, females were
returned to their respective brood and male partner and were subjected to
headspace analyses as described below between 2 and 6 h later. The incorporation
of the deuterium-labelled geranyl pyrophosphate into methyl geranate was
concluded from the increase in the abundance of diagnostic ions of methyl
geranate80.
Gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection. The
electrophysiological response of N. vespilloides male antennae towards methyl
geranate was tested using GC-EAD. The same GC-EAD set-up as in ref. 81 was
used, but the GC was equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m � 0.25 mm i.d.,
25 mm film thickness, J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) and the oven
temperature was raised from 50 �C to 220 �C at a rate of 10 �C per min. The final
temperature was held for 2 min. The responses of three male antennae were tested
to 50 ng of synthetic methyl geranate (100 ng ml � 1 pentane, 1 ml injected, Split
FID:EAD ¼ 1:1, mixture of isomers, Santa Cruz Biothechnology, USA). The
antennae were cut at their base and at the tip. The excised antenna was mounted
between two glass electrodes filled with insect Ringer solution (see ref. 81 for
further details).
Copulation behaviour and natural methyl geranate emission. Mating behaviour
of N. vespilloides males in two different breeding contexts was analysed by
observing them continuously for 90 min. Experimental N. vespilloides pairs were
provided with a 10-g mouse carcass and divided in two different treatment groups.
In the first treatment group, pairs were allowed to care for 10 of their own larvae
and in the second treatment group larvae were withheld from their parents.
Observation took place 48 h after larval hatching. During observation we recorded
whether they copulated or not, and if they did, how often they engaged in
copulations. At the end of each observation period the females were directly
subjected to headspace analyses to quantify methyl geranate emission. To test
whether male copulation behaviour (yes/no) or the number of copulations
was/were dependent on the amount of methyl geranate a female emitted,
a logistic regression and a Poisson GLM was performed.
Bioassay with synthetic methyl geranate. To test the effect of synthetic methyl
geranate on male copulation behaviour, we used triangular shaped pieces
(4 � 4 � 5 mm, 1 mm thick) of Supelco Molded Thermogreen LB-2 silicone septa
(Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), which were either conditioned for 7 h in
1 ml n-hexane (control) or a solution of 10 mg synthetic methyl geranate diluted in
1 ml n-hexane. Subsequently the silicon pieces were left under a fume hood for 15 h
to allow the solvent to evaporate. Headspace analyses (N ¼ 7) of the silicone pieces
revealed that after this procedure they emitted a relatively constant amount of
methyl geranate (430 ng±57.8 ng per 20 min) over a long time period. The silicon
pieces were attached to females that were breeding with a male at a 10-g carcass for
about 120 h, but were not allowed to care for larvae (corresponds to the treatment
group ‘without larvae, day 5’. These females thus emitted no or only trace amounts
of their own methyl geranate; Fig. 1d). After fixing the silicon pieces on a female’s
pronotum with superglue, the female and the male and their carcass were trans-
ferred to a small plastic container (7 � 3 � 3 cm) with a plaster floor and observed
continuously for 60 min. During observation, the following parameters were
recorded: the number of encounters between male and female, whether they
copulated or not and how often they engaged in copulations. Recording started
after observation of the first encounter. To test whether the treatment (methyl
geranate versus control) had an effect on the occurrence (yes/no) or number of
copulations, we performed a w2-test and a Poisson GLM, respectively.

 Effect of breeding partner on methyl geranate emission. This experiment
aimed to test the effect of the sex of the breeding partner on methyl geranate
emission. Two females were kept together with a male for 48 h, so to that both
females were inseminated. Afterwards the females (without the males) were
transferred to a new container (20 � 20 � 6 cm) and provided with a large carcass
(430 g) to induce cooperative breeding. A 30 g carcass was prodvided because
cooperative same sex brood care usually only occurs on large carcasses82. As soon
as the first larva had hatched the respective female pair was provided with up to
30 first instar larvae to care for. Additionally, male-female pairs were established
and subjected to the same procedure. As in previous experiments, we also provided
a large number of N. vespilloides pairs with a 10 g mouse carcass to use them as
‘larvae donor’ in case a pair did not have enough of their own larvae to add78. After
24 h of larval care all females were subjected to individual headspace analyses and
then weighed. A Gaussian GLM was used with the sex of the breeding partner as
the fixed factor and the amount of methyl geranate emitted as dependent variable.
To verify that in the female–female dyads both females performed brood care, we
observed their feeding behaviour. In all tested cases, both females were feeding
larvae. Furthermore, there was no difference in the weight between females
breeding with a female and those breeding a male partner (Gaussian GLM, N ¼ 28,
F1,26 ¼ 0.01, P ¼ 0.92), which is a good indicator that all female had equal access to
the carrion resource.
Headspace analyses. To quantify methyl geranate emission, females were put
singly into a glass jar (inner diameter 3 cm) and left undisturbed to accumulate the
volatiles emitted by the beetles. Before use, all glasses were silanized with 5%
dimethyldichlorosilane solution in toluene to increase their hydrophobicity and
prevent adherence of chemical substances. Each glass jar was provided with a
moist, Soxhlet-cleaned ball of cotton wool to provide sufficient humidity for the
beetles. After an accumulation time of 20 min, air was sucked through the jar at a
rate of 200 ml min � 1 for 5 min using a membrane pump (DC 12/16FK, Fu
¨rgut,
Aichstetten, Germany). Incoming air was cleaned by an activated charcoal filter
(50 mg, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The effluent air stream passed through
the glass jar and the emitted volatiles were trapped on a thermal desorption filter
filled with a mixture of Tenax-TA and Carbotrap as described in ref. 83. For
quantification, 20 ng of methyl undecanoate (dissolved in 1 ml methanol) were
applied to each adsorbent filter as internal standard. A calibration curve was
created by analysing known amounts (5–100 ng) of synthetic methyl geranate that
were applied to the adsorbent filter together with 20 ng of the internal standard.
Headspace samples from the first experiment (Methyl geranate and JH profile
during a breeding cycle) were thermally desorbed (8 min at 300 �C) using a
Shimadzu TD20 automated thermal desorption system connected to a Shimadzu
GC 2010 gas chromatograph coupled to a QP2010 plus mass spectrometer. The GC
was equipped with a non-polar capillary column (BPX-5, 30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d.,
0.25 mm film thickness, SGE Analytical Science, Milton Keynes, UK) and helium
was used as carrier gas (50 cm s � 1 linear velocity). The oven programme started at
50 �C and was raised at a rate of 5 �C min � 1 to 200 �C, and then at a rate of
15 �C min � 1 to 280 �C that was held for 10 min. The mass spectrometer was run in
electron impact mode (70 eV) and set to a scan range from 35 to 450 m/z.
Headspace samples of all other experiments were analysed using an Agilent
Technologies 7820A gas chromatograph equipped with a non-polar capillary
column (DB-5, 30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness, J & W Scientific,
Folsom, CA, USA) and hydrogen as carrier gas (40 cm s � 1 linear velocity).
Adsorbent filter were introduced via ChromatoProbe kit (CPAV6890,
Aviv Analytical Ltd, Israel) and thermally desorbed for 1 min at 310 �C.
GC temperature settings were the same as described above.
