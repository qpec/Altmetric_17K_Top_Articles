Objectives. To evaluate trends in premature death rates by cause of death, age, race,
and urbanization level in the United States.
Methods. We calculated cause-specific death rates using the Compressed Mortality
File, National Center for Health Statistics data for adults aged 25 to 64 years in 2 time
periods: 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015. We defined 48 subpopulations by 10-year age
groups, race/ethnicity, and county urbanization level (large urban, suburban, small or
medium metropolitan, and rural).
Results.The age-adjusted premature death rates for all adults declined by 8% between
1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015, with decreases in 39 of the 48 subpopulations. Most
decreases in death rates were attributable to HIV, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. All
9 subpopulations with increased death rates were non-Hispanic Whites, largely outside
large urban areas. Most increases in death rates were attributable to suicide, poisoning,
and liver disease.
Conclusions. The unfavorable recent trends in premature death rate among non-Hispanic
Whites outside large urban areas were primarily caused by self-destructive health behaviors
likely related to underlying social and economic factors in these communities. (Am J Public
Health. 2017;107:1541–1547. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2017.303941)

R
ecently, Case and Deaton1 observed that
middle-aged White non-Hispanic
Americans have shorter lifespans, a reversal of
decades of progress that has not been observed
in any other industrialized nation. This trend
is becoming more pronounced in working-
aged adults, with newly released 2015 data
showing that the overall death rate increased
for the first time in a decade, particularly
among those aged younger than 65 years.2 A
2017 Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) publication3 highlighted
increased mortality rates among rural com-
munities in the United States compared with
urban locales. Missing from these noteworthy
observations were the roles of place and race
together—specifically, differences between
urban and rural communities and among
different racial groups, which might be driven
by underlying social and economic factors.
Recently, the County Health Rankings4
2016 Key Findings Report5 showed that rural
residents have a higher risk for premature
mortality relative to urban and suburban
residents. Similarly, Chetty et al.6 investigated
the gap in mortality between high- and
low-income Americans and found that ge-
ography was highly correlated with health in
low-income Americans, with the mortality
gaps between rich and poor narrowing in
some regions while widening in others.
However, there is a lack of a deeper exami-
nation of the causes of premature death
among rural populations in the United States,
as well as an investigation into which
demographic populations in each area are at
risk for adverse trends in health over time. In
this study, we examined death rates in 4 dif-
ferent levels of urbanization in working-age,
non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,
and Hispanic adults. To describe how the
deaths of each subpopulation changed over
arecent16-yearperiod,wecomparedtrendsin
death rates from 1999 to 2001 to those from
2012 to 2015 for each level of urbanization
(large urban, suburban, small or medium
metropolitan, and rural). Lastly, we identified
theleadingcausesofdeaththat resulted inthese
changes in death rates over time.
METHODS
Data for the present study came from
the National Center for Health Statistics’
(NCHS) Compressed Mortality File within
the Underlying Cause of Death database,
through CDC Wide-Ranging Online Data
for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER).
These data consist of information from death
certificates for US residents within counties,
which records demographic characteristics
and an International Classification of Diseases,
10th edition (ICD-10)7–coded underlying
cause of death. For a more detailed de-
scription of methodology of CDC

 Subpopulations Defined
Levels of urbanization (large urban, sub-
urban, small or medium metropolitan, and
rural) are an adaptation of the 2006 NCHS
Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for
counties (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/
oae/nchsurbruralfiledocumentation.pdf).
Table 1 shows the definitions for each level of
urbanization and describes the demographic
characteristics for each county using data from
2015 US Census estimates.
We studied three racial/ethnic categories:
non-Hispanic White (referred to herein as
White), non-Hispanic Black (referred to as
Black), and Hispanic. In addition, we cal-
culated death rates for all races/ethnicities,
a group that includes combined deaths of
White, Black, and Hispanic populations, in
addition to other race groups (Asians, Pacific
Islanders, and Native Americans) not in-
cluded in the White, Black, or Hispanic
subpopulations. These groups were excluded
from subpopulation analysis because of their
smallsamplesizes.Todescribedisparitiesindeath
rates between racial/ethnic groups at both time
intervals, we calculated the relative risk (RR) of
death for Blacks and for Hispanics, using Whites
as the reference group. Death rates for Hispanics
should be interpreted with caution because of
the relatively smaller absolute number of deaths
(see the “Limitations” section).
Because the study sample included persons
aged 25 to 64 years, which is an age range
below the average life expectancy in the
United States, we considered all deaths in our
study sample to be premature deaths. Four age
categories were explored: 25 to 34, 35 to 44,
45 to 54, and 55 to 64 years. Age groups were
determined in a manner that allowed ex-
amination of differences in mortality at dif-
ferent life stages, while allowing for enough
deaths per category. Age group–specific
rates were not age-adjusted. When
examining the entire population of adults
aged 25 to 64 years, we used age-adjusted
rates, directly adjusted to the 2000 US stan-
dard population.
Trends in All-Cause Deaths
We explored trends in deaths from all
causes by county level of urbanization, age,
and race/ethnicity. We calculated data using
3-year averages of death rates for 2 intervals:
1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015. We
calculated disparities in rates between
racial/ethnic groups or between places
during 1999 to 2001 and during 2013 to
2015 using RR (e.g., rate in Blacks divided
by the rate in Whites).
We calculated absolute changes in death
rates between the 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to
2015 intervals by finding the difference be-
tween the 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015
rates. We calculated percent changes in death
rates by dividing this difference by the 1999 to
2001 rate, and multiplying by 100. We de-
termined statistical significance of the percent
change with a t-test for independent samples,
using MedCalc version 16.8 for Windows
(MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).
Causes of Death
We explored the underlying causes of death
for all 48 subpopulations, which were defined
by combinations of age, race/ethnicity, and
county urbanization level. We ascertained the
leading causes of death during 1999 to 2015 for
each age–racial/ethnic group. We then calcu-
lated the absolute change for each of the leading
causes of death in each age group and sorted
these from largest absolute change to smallest
absolute change. For each age group, we in-
cluded up to 10 causes of death that contributed
the most to the overall difference in death rates.
All other causes (with small differences) were
included in the “other” causes of death cate-
gory. Causes of death categories are based on
ICD-10 codes and described in Appendix A
(available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
Causes of death with the largest absolute
change in death rates over time are displayed
for all 48 subpopulations in Figure 1. The
absolute changes in cause-of-death rates are
additive and yield the change in the overall
death rate. In Figure 1, the vertical line in the
middle of the x-axis represents no change in
death rate over time; causes of death with
decreasing rates are displayed to the left of this
line, and causes of death with increasing rates
are displayed to the right.
RESULTS
The age-adjusted premature death rates for
all adults decreased by 8% between 1999 to

 2001 and 2013 to 2015, with decreases in 39
of the 48 subpopulations. Most decreases in
death rates were attributable to HIV, car-
diovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. All 9
subpopulations with increased death rates
were among non-Hispanic Whites, largely
in rural or small or medium metropolitan
counties, mostly caused by deaths from sui-
cide, accidental poisoning, and liver disease.
Table 2 shows all-cause death rates as
3-year averages during 1999 to 2001 and
during 2013 to 2015 for each county ur-
banization level, racial/ethnic group, and age
group, as well as the percent change between
these 2 time periods. Figure 1 shows the
absolute changes in death rates for specific
causes of death by county urbanization level,
racial/ethnic group, and age group. Although
Whites had the most unfavorable trends in
premature death rates, Blacks had the highest
absolute rates of premature deaths during
both 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015. Rural
counties, relative to counties with higher
population densities, had the highest death
rates during both 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to
2015, together with the most unfavorable
trends in premature death.
Disparities in Death Rates During
1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015
Death rates were generally highest in
Blacks in all 4 age groups during both 1999 to
2001 and 2013 to 2015. The disparity in
premature death rates for Blacks compared
with Whites (as measured by RR) decreased
between 1999 to 2001 (RR = 1.9) and
2013 to 2015 (RR = 1.4) and was consistent
across the 4 age groups (1999–2001 RR
range = 1.7–2.1; 2013–2015 RR range =
1.4–1.5).RRsfor prematuredeathindicateda
stronger reduction in mortality in Hispanics
compared with Whites between1999 to 2001
(RR = 0.83) and 2013 to 2015 (RR = 0.66)
and were consistent across the 4 age groups
(1999–2001 RR range = 0.78–0.91; 2013–
2015 RR range = 0.61–0.71). Confidence
intervals for RR are described in Appendix B
(available as a supplement to the online ver-
sion of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
Death rates among those aged 25 to 64
years were highest in rural counties during
both 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015 (1999–
2001 = 399 per 100 000; 2013–2015 = 421

 (1999–2001 = 314 per 100 000; 2013–
2015 = 280 per 100 000). We observed this
among all racial/ethnic and age groups.
Across racial/ethnic subpopulations aged 25
to 64 years, RRs of premature death for rural
counties compared with suburban counties
ranged from 1.3 to 1.4 during 1999 to 2001
and from 1.4 to 1.5 during 2013 to 2015.
Across each age group, RRs of premature
death for rural counties compared with
suburban counties ranged from 1.2 to 1.4
during 1999 to 2001 and from 1.4 to 1.6 at
2013 to 2015. Confidence intervals for RR
are described in Appendix B.
Overall Death Rates by Age,
Race/Ethnicity, and Place
Death rates for Whites increased in sub-
populations aged 25 to 54 years from 1999–
2001 to 2013–2015 (Table 2). Among
Whites, only subpopulations aged 55 to 64
years saw declines in death rates. By contrast,
Black and Hispanic subpopulations of all ages
had dramatic reductions in death rates.
Death rates in rural subpopulations for all
races/ethnicities increased among those aged
25 to 64 years by 6%, whereas large urban,
suburban, and small or medium metropolitan
subpopulations had decreases in death rates by
2% to 20% (Table 2). These disparities were
most pronounced in Whites relative to other
racial/ethnic subpopulations and among

decreased by 19% in large urban counties but
increased by 15% in rural counties. In those
aged 25 to 34 years, although large urban
counties saw a 12% decrease in death rates,
increases were seen in suburban (20%), small
or medium metropolitan (16%), and rural
(18%) counties.
Specific Causes of Death by Age,
Race/Ethnicity, and Place
Figure 1 lists the causes of death that ac-
count for the largest changes in death rates for
each age group by race/ethnicity and county
urbanization level by displaying differences in
absolute rates for each cause of death from
1999–2001 to 2013–2015.
Figure 1a shows trends in death rates by
race and place for persons aged 25 to 34 years.
HIV and motor vehicle crash (MVC) deaths
declined among all racial/ethnic groups, al-
though deaths from poisonings increased in all
racial/ethnic groups. The large overall de-
creases in deaths among Blacks were caused
by decreases from HIV and MVCs, which
offset any increases in assault and poisoning
in these groups. Although assault deaths de-
clined among Blacks in large urban areas,
Blacks in all other areas had increased assault
deaths. Similar to Black subpopulations,
Hispanics had decreases in HIV and MVCs
that offset increased deaths from poisonings
and suicides. However, decreases in overall
deaths among Hispanics were smaller than
decreases among Blacks. Small decreases in
HIV and MVC deaths among Whites were
not enough to offset increases in poisonings
and suicides. Although increases in poisoning
deaths were seen in all groups, they were
more pronounced among Whites. White and
Hispanics in all areas had increases in deaths
from suicide, but Whites outside of large
urban areas had the largest increases.
Figure 1bshowstrends indeathrates byrace
and place for persons aged 35 to 44 years. As in
the youngest age group, death rates caused by
HIV declined in all groups, but contributed
most to the decreases among Blacks. Similarly,
deaths from MVCs, cancer, and CVD de-
creased in each group, but the decreases were
greatest among Blacks. By contrast, death rates
from poisoning and suicide increased only
among Whites, and these increases were
greatest among Whites in rural counties.
Figure 1c shows trends in death rates by
race and place for persons aged 45 to 54 years.
Blacks and Hispanics had an overall decrease
in death rates in all places, largely because of
decreases in deaths from chronic diseases such
as cancer and CVD. Whites in large urban,
suburban, and small metropolitan counties
also had decreases in these chronic disease
deaths, but the magnitude of these decreases
were smaller, and any progress was blunted by
increased deaths from accidental poisonings,
suicide, respiratory disease, and liver disease.
Whites in rural counties were the only sub-
population in these age groups who had an
increase in deaths from chronic diseases, such
as CVD and diabetes, in addition to the similar
increases in deaths from poisonings, suicide,
liver disease, and respiratory diseases also
observed in Whites in counties of other
urbanization levels.
Figure 1d shows trends in death rates by
race and place for persons aged 55 to 64 years.
All subpopulations in this older age group,
including rural Whites, had decreases in death
rates largely driven by decreases in chronic
diseases such as cancer and CVD. Blacks had
the largest decreases in cancer and CVD
deaths, leading to overall decreases in pre-
mature mortality despite increased deaths
from poisonings. Whites in all places had
increased deaths from poisonings, suicide, and
liver disease, but decreased deaths from
chronic diseases accounted for overall de-
creases in death rate in this age group.
DISCUSSION
Significant disparities exist in the rates and
the trends in premature death in the United
States among 48 subpopulations defined by
age, race/ethnicity, and urbanization level.
The disparities among races—with highest
rates among Blacks and lowest among
Hispanics—are longstanding.1,8 We exam-
ined trends for subpopulations by race and
place during 1999 to 2015 and found that all
9 subpopulations with increased death rates
were White, mostly outside of large urban
areas. The causes of death that drove these
increases in Whites in all areas were mostly
suicide, accidental poisoning, and liver dis-
ease. Rural Whites had the largest increases in
death rates among all middle-aged adults (45–
64 years), whereas suburban Whites had the
largest increases in death rates among all
young adults (25–34 years). In addition to
deaths from suicide, accidental poisoning, and
liver disease, Whites in rural areas saw in-
creases in chronic disease deaths, which
contributed to the overall higher increases in
death rates in these subpopulations. For ex-
ample, Whites aged 45 to 54 years in rural
areas had increased deaths from CVD and
respiratory disease deaths, which added to the
total burden of premature mortality, whereas
no other subpopulation had increases in
deaths from these causes.
The marked increases in suicide, accidental
poisonings, and liver disease death rates, to-
gether with unfavorable chronic disease
trends, are driving increased premature
mortality in Whites. A large portion of these
deaths are caused primarily by underlying
behavioral risk factors and poor behavioral
health. Case and Deaton1 coined such deaths
as “despair deaths” and showed that they are
increasing among “working class Whites,”
defined as Whites with a high school edu-
cation or less. They discussed the stress and
hopelessness faced by this population as they
enter the labor market and are met with
bleaker prospects and lower-paying job op-
portunities relative to the previous genera-
tion. This has led to compounding family
dysfunction, poor social support, and addic-
tion—conditions that are the drivers of de-
spair deaths. In a more recent Brookings
paper by Case and Deaton,9 they expanded
their discussion on how individual- and
population-level differences accounted for
how despair manifests in health, including
ending life intentionally or soothing through
opiates, food, tobacco, or alcohol use. Our
data supported their observations, showing
that Whites aged 45 to 54 years in rural
communities, in addition to having the
highest increases in despair deaths from liver
disease, poisonings, and suicide, also experi-
enced increased deaths from CVD and re-
spiratory disease.
In contrast to the increasing death rates
observed in White subpopulations, Black and
Hispanic subpopulations of all ages and living
in all places experienced significant decreases
in death rates. Although a dramatic disparity
in death rates between Blacks and Whites
persists in the United States, this gap is nar-
rowing. Recent observations showed that
since 1999, the mortality gap between Black

 and White adults with high school degrees or
less closed completely because of ground
gained by Blacks and lost by Whites.9 In our
observations, the decreases in Black and
Hispanic death rates were largely caused by
reductions in MVCs and HIV in younger
adults (aged 25–34 years), and reductions in
chronic diseases in middle-aged adults (aged
45–64 years). In younger adults, these large
decreases offset smaller increases in deaths
from poisoning and suicide in Hispanics and
deaths from poisoning and assault in Blacks.
Specifically, younger adult Blacks outside of
large urban areas had increases in deaths from
assault. Although not a focus of this study, this
was an important finding that deserves further
exploration, considering national attention
on trends in police brutality, community
violence, and structural racism that dispro-
portionately affect Blacks.10,11
Our findings showed that young adult
(aged 25–34 years) Whites in suburban areas
and middle-aged (aged 45–64 years) Whites
in rural areas had the most marked increase
in premature death relative to other sub-
population in each respective age group.
Although we were unable to analyze the role
of education and income, these findings
supported observations of premature death in
working class Whites by Case and Deaton.9
During 2000 to 2014, poverty rates in sub-
urban areas nearly tripled, with more people
living in poverty in the areas surrounding
large urban core areas than within them.12,13
In addition, rural areas had high relative
densities of working class Whites, many of
whom experienced a loss of manufactu-
ring jobs with subsequent permanent un-
employment.14,15 Once key contributors to
US economic growth, rural communities are
increasingly challenged by globalization and
the loss of young skilled workers, fewer op-
portunities for gainful employment, and de-
creased production of marketable goods.6
Adding to the economic burden are rural
disparities in access to quality health care,
higher levels of isolation, and striking dif-
ferences in health behavior and attitudes, such
as higher rates of smoking, sedentary activity,
and stigmatization of mental illness.16,17
Meanwhile, America’s urban communities
have undergone economic and population
growth, and are the sites of revitalization and
numerous public health initiatives targeting
vulnerable populations, providing vital
resources not available to many rural Amer-
icans.18 Taken together, these economic,
behavioral, and social factors leave rural
Whites more susceptible to poor health
outcomes.
If changing demographic and economic
characteristics in suburban and rural areas play
a role in increased premature mortality, then
why are only Whites affected, whereas Blacks
and Hispanic subpopulations in these areas
enjoyed relative improvement? The answer is
beyond the scope of this study; however,
previous demographic observations offer
potential explanations. First, segregation is
still pervasive throughout the United States in
urban, suburban, and rural areas.19,20 Within
these areas, many neighborhoods remain
segregated so that the schools, health care
facilities, churches, and other social support
systems are not shared by various racial/ethnic
groups. Second, these groups have unique
perspectives on their history and their future
prospects. Unlike Blacks and Hispanics in the
sameareas,workingclassWhitesarefaringworse
than their parents economically, which in-
tensifies feelings of despair.9,21 As working class
Whites lose their stronghold in the rural com-
munities of the American Heartland, their hope
may be diminishing along with their health.
In recent analyses that compared the
longevity of the American working class with
their counterparts in other high-income na-
tions, only the American White working class
has had an epidemic of premature death.8,18,19
Although working classes in other nations
have faced similar challenges from recent
economic recession and trends in globaliza-
tion, they have not experienced the rise in
despair deaths. Case and Deaton9 posited that
the more generous safety net in these other
nations preserved their middle class and pro-
vided more opportunities for these populations.
Meanwhile, the American middle class has
increasingly contracted since the 1970s, after
enjoying decades of strength stimulated by the
NewDeal.21AccordingtoananalysisbyPew,22
the middle class decreased by 7% during 2001
to 2015—the years included in our study—
a decline caused by downward movement of
households into a lower income bracket.23
Limitations
This study was limited by the lack of
information about the educational and
economic status of decedents and the effects
of racial/ethnic misclassification. Economic
and educational disparities played a role in the
mortality advantage of urban Whites versus
rural Whites.24,25 Although we examined
trends, death rates, and cause of death by age,
race/ethnicity, and place, we could not
stratify by individual income or education
level. Because of differences in reporting
of race between the US Census (where race
is self-reported) and mortality data (where
race is determined by a coroner or funeral
home), inconsistencies might exist between
racial/ethnic subpopulation count and death
count that affected the mortality rate.26
Particularly, data for Hispanics should be
interpreted with caution because of possible
bias of under-ascertainment.27 Despite the
likelihood of this bias, underestimation of
Hispanic deaths at a given time point are
unlikely to fully explain the trends. Previous
research found that US Census reporting
identified an additional 5% of Hispanics
compared with death certifications, a dis-
crepancy that did not significantly change
over a 20-year reporting period.28 Thus, the
reduction in the death rate for Hispanics likely
reflects an actual decrease in premature death
over time, with only a small portion of the
difference between Hispanics and Whites
explained by reporting inconsistencies. Our
focus on deaths in adults younger than 65
years, which have lower rates of ICD-10
misclassification relative to deaths in older
adults, strengthens the content validity of
our analysis.29–31 In addition, the novel de-
scription of the underlying causes driving
trends in death rates for subpopulations by
race/ethnicity and place contributes a new
layer to existing premature mortality
literature.
Conclusions
In summary, significant disparities exist in
the trends of premature death rates in the
United States by race/ethnicity and level of
urbanization. These disparities in trends in
death rates among Whites living outside of
large urban communities are likely driven by
underlying social and economic factors, such
as a lack of economic opportunity in these
communities relative to their counterparts in
previous generations. To reverse unfavorable
trends in death rates among Whites and to

 continue improving trends for Hispanics and
Blacks, culturally and geographically unique
socioeconomic, behavioral, and environ-
mental factors must be considered, in addition
to access to high quality care.21 If social
programs are responsible for improving trends
for working class individuals in other high-
income nations, these programs should be
broadened in the United States to strengthen
the diminishing middle class and combat
despair. Only then can reductions in pre-
mature death be enjoyed by populations of all
races/ethnicities and in all places.
