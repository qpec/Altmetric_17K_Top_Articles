Abstract The mammalian heartbeat is thought to begin just prior to the linear heart tube stage
of development. How the initial contractions are established and the downstream consequences of
the earliest contractile function on cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis have not been
described. Using high-resolution live imaging of mouse embryos, we observed randomly
distributed spontaneous asynchronous Ca2+-oscillations (SACOs) in the forming cardiac crescent
(stage E7.75) prior to overt beating. Nascent contraction initiated at around E8.0 and was
associated with sarcomeric assembly and rapid Ca2+ transients, underpinned by sequential
expression of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) and L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC). Pharmacological
inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC revealed rapid development of Ca2+ handling in the early heart and
an essential early role for NCX1 in establishing SACOs through to the initiation of beating. NCX1
blockade impacted on CaMKII signalling to down-regulate cardiac gene expression, leading to
impaired differentiation and failed crescent maturation.

Introduction
The heart is the first organ to form and function during mammalian embryonic development. In the
mouse, mesoderm originating from the primitive streak forms a bilateral pool of progenitor cells
that at E7.5 give rise to the cardiac crescent (CC). The CC subsequently expands and migrates to
the midline whereupon, between E8.25 and E8.5, the two sides of the CC fuse and form the linear
heart tube (LHT) (reviewed in Buckingham et al., 2005). The first cardiac contractions have been
described during the transition from CC to LHT. Studies of heart development in model organisms
have historically focused on the origin and spatial-temporal allocation of cardiac progenitors and car-
diovascular lineage determination (Buckingham et al., 2005; Saga et al., 1996; Cai et al., 2003;
Meilhac et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2006; Moretti et al., 2006; Evans et al., 2010; Devine et al.,
2014). Whilst insight into the identification and regulation of cardiac cell types is important for
improved understanding of congenital heart disease (Bruneau, 2008), an anatomical and cellular
bias has overlooked a role for the onset of cardiac function. Early descriptions of initial cardiac con-
tractions (Navaratnam et al., 1986), including suggested pacemaker activity on either side of the
embryonic midline (Goss, 1952), as well as optical mapping of spontaneous action potentials per-
formed in both chicken (7 somite stage) and rat (3-somite stage) (Fujii et al., 1981; Hirota et al.,
1985), have been informative, but lack resolution. Subsequent studies in mouse (3-somite stage)
could only infer early electrical activity based on irregular fluctuations in basal Ca2+ (Nishii and Shi-
bata, 2006). Given the forming heart contracts from an early stage, this raises the important

 question of when and how contractile activity of cardiomyocytes is first initiated during development
and to what extent this influences the progression of differentiation and subsequent cardiac mor-
phogenesis. This is especially important as the forces exerted by cardiac contractions have been
shown in several models to be required for proper heart development (Granados-Riveron and
Brook, 2012), and to modulate gene expression (Miyasaka et al., 2011) at later developmental
stages.
In mature cardiomyocytes, coordinated electrical excitation is coupled to physical contraction in a
process termed excitation contraction coupling (ECC) (Bers, 2002). ECC relies on changes in the
intracellular concentration of the second messenger Ca2+ via release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR) in a process termed Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) (Fabiato and Fabiato, 1979). Increases
in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ result in cardiomyocyte contraction due to Ca2+ binding to
troponin and myofilament activation. ECC involves a number of specific proteins including L-type
Ca2+ channels (LTCC, sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx), ryanodine receptors (RyR2, SR Ca2+ release), the
sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA, SR Ca2+ uptake) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
(NCX, Sarcolemmal Ca2+ efflux). Targeted disruption of genes encoding ECC proteins in mice has
shown that contractile activity of immature cardiomyocytes does not require ECC. Embryonic cardio-
myocytes have a less developed SR and T-tubule system as well as an increased requirement for sar-
colemmal Ca2+ flux (Conway et al., 2002; Seki et al., 2003) and whilst they express a variety of ion
channels and exchangers present in the adult heart (Seisenberger et al., 2000; Cribbs et al., 2001;
Linask et al., 2001), the expression and activity of these proteins is distinct from that in mature car-
diomyocytes (Liang et al., 2010). Using isolated cells as well as genetically manipulated animals, two
contrasting mechanisms have been proposed for how Ca2+ transients are generated in the develop-
ing heart from approximately E8.5 onwards. Early studies suggested that myocyte contraction is trig-
gered by sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx through voltage activated Ca2+ channels with little or no
contribution from the SR (Nakanishi et al., 1988; Takeshima et al., 1998). In contrast, more recently
it has been shown that at ~E8.5–9, Ca2+ transients originate from the SR, via RyR together with InsP3
channels, to trigger electrical activity as well as contraction (Viatchenko-Karpinski et al., 1999;
eLife digest The heart is the first organ to form and to begin working in an embryo during
pregnancy. It must begin pumping early to supply oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryo.
Coordinated contractions of specialised muscle cells in the heart, called cardiomyocytes, generate
the force needed to pump blood. The flow of calcium ions into and out of the cardiomyocytes
triggers these heartbeats. In addition to triggering heart contractions, calcium ions also act as a
messenger that drives changes in which genes are active in the cardiomyocytes and how these cells
behave.
Scientists commonly think of the first heartbeat as occurring after a tube-like structure forms in
the embryo that will eventually develop into the heart. However, it is not yet clear how the first
heartbeat starts or how the initial heartbeats affect further heart development.
Tyser, Miranda et al. now show that the first heartbeat actually occurs much earlier in embryonic
development than widely appreciated. In the experiments, videos of live mouse embryos showed
that prior to the first heartbeat the flow of calcium ions between different cardiomyocytes is not
synchronised. However, as the heart grows these calcium flows become coordinated leading to the
first heartbeat. The heartbeats also become faster as the heart grows. Using drugs to block the
movement of calcium ions, Tyser, Miranda et al. also show that a protein called NCX1 is required to
trigger the calcium flows prior to the first heartbeat. Moreover, the experiments revealed that these
early heartbeats help drive the growth of cardiomyocytes and shape the developing heart.
Together, the experiments show that the first heartbeats are essential for normal heart
development. Future studies are needed to determine what controls the speed of the first
heartbeats, and what organises the calcium flows that trigger the first heartbeat. Such studies may
help scientists better understand birth defects of the heart, and may suggest strategies to rebuild
hearts that have been damaged by a heart attack or other injury.

 Me
´ry et al., 2005; Sasse et al., 2007; Rapila et al., 2008). Whilst these studies characterised SR
function at ~E8.5–9, they did not investigate how Ca2+ transients are regulated at the earliest stages
of cardiac crescent development when contraction is initiated, and relied on experiments performed
using isolated cells cultured for between 12 to 70 hr (Sasse et al., 2007; Rapila et al., 2008). Thus
there is a lack of cellular resolution in vivo and no current mechanistic insight into the onset of Ca2+
handling and its impact on differentiation and cardiogenesis.
We report here, for the first time, high-resolution live imaging of Ca2+ transients during the earli-
est manifestation of murine heart development well before any indication of spontaneous cardiac
contractions. We employed the use of multiple pharmacological inhibitors to address the contribu-
tion of the NCX1 and LTCC Ca2+ channels during this process and reveal an essential early role for
NCX1-dependent Ca2+ handling on downstream cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis.

Staging of early cardiac development and sarcomeric assembly
It is commonly stated that initiation of contraction begins with the formation of the LHT (Bru-
neau, 2008), and whilst cardiac contractions have been reported just prior to the ‘linear heart tube’
stage (Navaratnam et al., 1986; Nishii and Shibata, 2006; Linask et al., 2001; Kumai et al., 2000;
Porter and Rivkees, 2001), a precise study on the initiation of cardiac function has not been con-
ducted. A difficulty with these reports is the use of ‘embryonic day’ or ‘somite number’ to stage the
developing heart. Somite number is variable in its correlation to the overall embryonic stage
(Kaufman and Navaratnam, 1981), can depend on genetic background (Me
´ry et al., 2005;
Porter and Rivkees, 2001) and importantly, is not a sufficiently fine-grained proxy for the develop-
mental stages of the heart. This can lead to ambiguities, as a ‘3-somite’ embryo may range from the
cardiac crescent to early LHT stages. We, therefore, created a staging system specific to the early
heart, from early crescent to LHT (Supplementary file 1a), similar to studies at later stages when a
more precise morphological characterization is necessary (Biben and Harvey, 1997). On this basis,
we defined four stages (0, 1, 2 and 3) of cardiac crescent development prior to the LHT stage, based
on clear morphological differences. Stage 0 hearts represented the first discernible crescent struc-
ture situated beneath the developing head folds, being the widest (360–390 mm along the medio-
lateral axis) and thinnest (70–80 mm along the rostro-caudal axis) of the crescent stages
(Supplementary file 1a). Whilst stage 1 was morphologically similar to stage 0, the cardiac crescent
had become narrower (300–370 mm) and thicker (75–95 mm). By stage 2, folding of the cardiac cres-
cent is evident based on the formation of a trough at the embryonic midline and two lobes on either
side. As the embryo transitions to stage 3 this trough becomes less obvious with a rostral-caudal
elongation of the heart as the LHT begins to form. Transition from stage 3 to the LHT was defined
by
the

fusion
of
the

and

(Figure

To molecularly characterize these stages, we performed immunostaining for three proteins of the
cardiac contractile machinery: sarcomeric a-actinin (a-Act), a protein of the Z-line; Myomesin
(Myom), a protein of the M-line and cardiac Troponin T (cTnT), the Tropomyosin binding subunit of
the troponin complex (Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). At stage 0, cTnT was the most
evident contractile protein within the early cardiac crescent, albeit without sarcomeric banding (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1A). Both a-Actinin and Myomesin appeared in small clusters of cells at
stage 0 (Figure 1A). Sarcomeric banding of these proteins, indicative of contractile capability, only
manifested later in discrete regions within stage 1 and 2 crescents (Figure 1B,C; Figure 1—figure
supplement 1B,C). This was surprising given that the crescent stages of early heart development
are thought to correspond to non-differentiated cardiac mesoderm (reviewed in Harvey, 2002),
without prior reports of contractile machinery or functionality. By stage 3, sarcomere assembly and
myofibrilar banding became more uniform, coincident with coalescence of the paired crescent pri-
mordia to the embryonic midline. This increased through to the linear heat tube stage, consistent
with progressive cardiomyocyte maturation (Figure 1D,E; Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E). To
further characterize stage development in relation to sarcomere assembly, qRT-PCR was performed
on isolated cardiac crescents, to assess the corresponding gene expression of Myom1 (encoding
Myom), Actn2 (encoding a-actinin) and Tnnt2 (encoding cTnT) (Figure 1F). Myom1, Actn2 and

 Tnnt2 expression significantly increased between stages 0 and 1 and continued to increase until for-
mation of the LHT (Supplementary file 1b).
The onset of Ca2+handling in the cardiac crescent
Coincident with sarcomere formation at stage 1 (Figure 1B; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), we
observed the onset of beating in discrete foci in the lateral regions of cardiac crescents of cultured
mouse embryos, by differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging (Video 1), significantly earlier
than previously described (Navaratnam et al., 1986; Nishii and Shibata, 2006). These foci generally
contracted at the same rate, indicative of either synchronization or a shared intrinsic beat rate for
nascent cardiomyocytes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The earliest cardiac contractions had a
frequency of approximately 30 beats per minute (BPM), which increased significantly by stage 3
(after approximately 5 hr) to around 60 BPM (Figure 2A). Contractile activity requires cytosolic Ca2+
flux, therefore, to investigate the earliest manifestations of Ca2+ handling within the cardiac crescent,
we loaded embryos with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Cal-520 followed by live imaging using con-
focal microscopy. From stage 1 crescents until late stage 3, lateral propagation of Ca2+ transients
was observed across the embryonic midline (Figure 2B), even through regions of non-contractile tis-
sue (Video 2). As the cardiac crescent starts to fuse to form the LHT, the transients switch from a lat-
eral to a more caudal-rostral propagation (data not shown). At stage 0 spontaneous asynchronous
Ca2+ oscillations (SACOs) were observed within the forming crescent, in the absence of contractile
activity and sarcomeric banding of cTnT (Figure 2C; Video 3). SACOs were observed in all stage 0
cardiac crescents imaged (n = 35), propagated within individual cells (Figure 2D’’) and displayed a
range of Ca2+ dynamics with variable frequencies and durations (Figure 2D’, Video 4). Compared
to Ca2+ transients at later stages (Figure 2A)
SACOs were significantly slower, with fluores-
cence reaching peak intensity between 0.79 and
11.9 s and decreasing with a similar slow rate of
efflux (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). During
a ~20 s recording period we observed only 10.3
± 0.7 individual SACOs per embryo (n = 35)
occurring in different sites. Consecutive SACOs in
the same site were rarely observed within the 20
s imaging window and, therefore, we conclude
that SACOs in individual cells occur at a fre-
quency < 3 bpm. The appearance of Ca2+ transi-
ents in the embryonic heart prior to beating
(Figure 2A,B) is consistent with the idea that
Ca2+ signalling within early cardiac progenitors
may be important to promote sufficient differen-
tiation
for
subsequent
contractile
function
(Mesaeli et al., 1999; Li et al., 2002).

and Supplementary file 1a for morphological staging. Stage 1, n = 12; stage 2, n = 8; stage 3, n = 10; LHT, n = 7), revealed a significant increase in
heart rate from stages 2 to 3 (A). Ca2+ signal following Cal520 loading of stage 1 embryos revealed lateral propagations of transients across the
crescent that correlated with the onset of beating at stages significantly earlier than previously described (B). Ca2+ signal following Cal-520 loading of
stage 0 embryos revealed spontaneous asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations in individual cells prior to beating, highlighted by white arrows (C), temporal

 differentiation. While ESC-derived cardiogenesis is aligned with stages of mesoderm induction, pre-
cardiac mesoderm, cardiomyocyte specification and differentiation based on temporal patterns of
gene expression (reviewed in Kattman and Keller, 2007; Willems et al., 2009; Van Vliet et al.,
2012), this has not been rigorously mapped onto embryonic stages of heart development. We,
therefore, performed a principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering of 12 cardiac
related gene expression profiles of whole embryos across embryonic stages E7.5 to E8.5, compared
with ESC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) from days 0 to 7 inclusive and day 14 of differentiation.
Whole embryos were used to reflect the myriad of cell types present in the ESC-cardiomyocyte dif-
ferentiation assay.
Hierarchical gene clusters were evident with the onset of beating at E7.5 and day 4 and 5 of EB
formation, coincident with cardiac progenitor gene expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).
Expression profiles by days 6 and 7 correlated with E8.0 (stage 0 to stage 2) when beating was well
established in both ESC-derived EBs and the embryonic heart, whereas day 14 was equivalent to the
more mature E8.5 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). Key cardiac genes Myh6, Tnnt2 and Mef2c
revealed comparable trends of increased expression over time of differentiation in both EBs and
embryos (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The cardiac specification program, characterized by
expression of Mesp1, was evident by day 4 in EBs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2I) following Bra-
chyury expression, an indicator of mesoderm formation, and loss of pluripotency markers such as
Pou5f1 (encoding Oct-4; Figure 2—figure supplement 2J–K). Mesp1 up-regulation in EBs was con-
sistent with expression at E7.5 in the embryo (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E) and preceded beat-
ing at day 6 and 7. These later stages revealed an up-regulation of Ca2+-handling genes such as
Slc8a1, Cacna1c and Ryr2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2L–N).
Sarcomere assembly in ESC-derived cardiomyocytes accompanied the onset of beating at day 7
(Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B) and, interestingly, the rate of beating was comparable at the
outset (day 7 of differentiation) with that observed in the developing heart at stage 1 (Figure 2—fig-
ure supplement 3C), consistent with an intrinsic rate for early cardiomyocytes contractions. Further-
more, Ca2+ transients were observed in day 7 EBs as both large propagating waves (Figure 2—
figure supplement 3D,F; Video 5) and within
small regions of cells prior to beating, similar to
that observed in the stage 0 embryonic heart
(Figure 2—figure supplement 3E,G; Video 6).

Between
E7.75
(as
defined by the presence of clear head-folds but not a cardiac crescent) and stage 0, Slc8a1 signifi-
cantly increased 21 fold (p-value<0.001), whilst Cacna1c revealed a modest but non-significant
increase of 2.5 fold (p-value>0.05) and Cacna1d a significant 4-fold increase (p-value <0.01). From
stage 1 onwards Slc8a1, Cacna1c and Cacna1d expression continued to significantly increase until
stage 3 (Figure 3A,B; Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, Slc8a1, 234-fold; Cacna1c, 38-fold; Cac-
na1d, 41-fold). Between stage 3 and the LHT, expression of Slc8a1 and Cacna1c was maintained
whilst Cacna1d significantly decreased (Supplementary file 1b; p-value<0.05). Previous studies have
suggested a non-ECC dependent role for the SR during development, implicating both InsP3 and
RyR channels (Me
´ry et al., 2005; Sasse et al., 2007; Rapila et al., 2008). While Ryr2 significantly
increased 30 fold between E7.75 and stage 0 (p-value<0.001), expression of Atp2a2 only increased
1.7 fold (p-value<0.05) and Iptr2 did not significantly change (p-value>0.05; Figure 3—figure sup-
plement 1C,D).
We performed a similar analysis on EB derived cardiomyocytes. Slc8a1 expression increased sig-
nificantly in EBs prior to Cacna1c (day 2 versus day 4; Figure 3B,C) and to a much greater extent
with the onset of beating (110 fold versus 38 fold; Figure 3B,C), suggesting NCX1 might play a
more immediate role in the onset of beating. This was supported by the lack of any further increase
in Slc8a1 expression from E9.5 through to birth (P0) and adulthood (Figure 3—figure supplement
2), whereas Cacna1c expression fluctuated across later developmental stages and significantly
increased post-natally (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B) with increased maturation.
Since the sarcolemmal channel genes revealed the most significant increases over the develop-
mental timecourse, we proceeded to investigate spatiotemporal protein expression of NCX1 and
CaV1.2 in embryos (Figure 3D,E), and ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (Figure 3F,G). Whilst NCX1 was
clearly detectable within the cardiac crescent at stage 0 (Figure 3D), CaV1.2 was absent (Figure 3E).
Differences in the expression of NCX1 and LTCC prior to beating were not maintained at later
stages, after established contraction (stage 2 onwards), when both channels were expressed
(Figure 3H,I). In EBs at day 7 of culture, both NCX1 and CaV1.2 were expressed, but whilst NCX1

became upregulated later from stage 1 onwards. Of note, while NCX1 and CaV1.2 signal was
detected in other regions of the embryo, notably in the head folds, in contrast to the heart it was
not membrane localised in these regions, indicative of non-functional protein. Furthermore qRT-PCR

Ca2+ transients within the forming cardiac crescent are dependent upon
NCX1
To functionally assess the roles of the sarcolemmal and SR channels in establishing and maintaining
heartbeat, we employed pharmacological blockade on embryos maintained ex-vivo and ESC-derived
cardiomyocyte cultures. We inhibited NCX1 using the specific inhibitors CB-DMB (Secondo et al.,
2009) or KB-R7943 (Kimura et al., 1999), the LTCC using nifedipine (McDonald et al., 1994) and
Ryanodine together with 2-APB to simultaneously block RyR and InsP3, similar to that described pre-
viously (Sasse et al., 2007; Rapila et al., 2008). Treated embryos were imaged for contractile activ-
ity by DIC imaging and Ca2+ transients were recorded in parallel with confocal fluorescence imaging
of Cal-520. Acute treatment (for a maximum of 30 min) with NCX inhibitors (CB-DMB and KB-R7943)
or LTCC inhibitor (Nifedipine), affected the embryos in a stage dependent-manner (Figure 4). Both
NCX1 and the LTCC were required for Ca2+ transients during stages 1 and 2 (Figure 4A), and their
inhibition led to an initial confinement of Ca2+ transients to one side of the crescent (within approxi-
mately 5 min of treatment, which persisted through to 15 min) followed shortly afterwards by com-
plete loss of Ca2+ signal (Figure 4C,D). At stage 3 and later, only the LTCC was required for Ca2+
transient generation (Figure 4B). Whilst NCX1 can function in both forward (Ca2+ efflux from the
cell) and reverse (Ca2+ influx into the cell) modes, our data suggested that NCX1 in the early cardiac

 crescent was functioning in reverse mode, as KB-R7943, that is reported to specifically inhibit reverse
mode NCX1 function (Hoyt et al., 1998; Iwamoto, 2004), recapitulated the results with CB-DMB
and acted as a control for off-target effects of the latter. These data suggests that reverse mode
NCX function may contribute to Ca2+ transient generation at the earliest stages of cardiac contrac-
tion, potentially via inward Ca2+ flux. The inhibitor experiments were repeated on day 7 and day 14
EBs. The relative effects of CB-DMB, KB-R7943 and nifedipine were consistent with those observed
in stages 1 and 2 of the embryonic heart (Figure 4E–G). Treatment with Ryanodine + 2-APB only
affected more mature embryos that had already undergone both cardiac looping and embryonic
turning (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) and did not prevent Ca2+ transients within cardiac cres-
cents at stage 3 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). This suggest that a functional SR is only
required once cardiac looping has been fully initiated, more than 18 hr later than the first observable
SACOs within the cardiac crescent.
Taking into account the earlier upregulation of NCX1 relative to Cav1.2 at stage 0 (Figure 3A),
we tested the possibility that NCX1 might be pivotal in initiating the SACOs observed in the early
cardiac crescent (Figure 2C). Treatment of stage 0 embryos with CB-DMB and KB-R7943 resulted in
a 90% decrease in the number of cells with SACOs after drug application when compared to base-
line. This was significantly greater than following application of nifedipine to inhibit LTCC, or the
DMSO control (CB-DMB, 90% inhibition + 6.6, mean + SEM, n = 10 embryos, p-value <0.01; KB-
R7943, 91% inhibition + 7.0, n = 9 embryos, p-value <0.001; nifedipine, 39% inhibition + 11.4; n = 8
embryos, p-value=0.44; DMSO, 29% inhibition + 7.6, n = 10; Figure 4H–J; Supplementary file 1d).
These data suggest that NCX1 is required for establishing the earliest pre-contractile SACOs.
Ca2+ channel blockade inhibits ESC differentiation into cardiomyocytes
Chronic treatment of Eomes-GFP ESC cultures (ESCs containing a knock-in of a GFP reporter into
the endogenous Eomes locus (Arnold et al., 2009); marking nascent mesoderm (Ciruna and Ros-
sant, 1999), with CB-DMB or Nifedipine, from days 0 to 14 of differentiation, resulted in a reduction
in the percentage of beating EBs at day 14, down to 22% and 52% (Percentage beating EBs; DMSO,
76.53% (n = 196); CB-DMB, 22.37%, p-value<0.001 (n = 152); Nifedipine, 52.11%, p-value<0.001 [n
= 71]) in the presence of CB-DMB and nifedipine respectively, compared to controls (Figure 5A),
whilst not effecting cell number (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C). The reduction in beating EBs
was supported by a down-regulation of key cardiac genes Myh6 (mean+ SEM: 0.57 ± 0.058;
p-value<0.05; n = 6; Figure 5B) and Tnnt2 (0.66 ± 0.095; p-value<0.05; n = 6; Figure 5B) specifically
following treatment with CB-DMB relative to control DMSO treatment. The decrease in cardiac gene
expression associated with CB-DMB treatment could be observed from day 4 of Eomes-GFP ESC
differentiation, at the initiation of cardiomyocyte differentiation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–
N). In an Nkx2.5-EGFP ESC line (ESCs containing a vector expressing eGFP under the control of a
murine Nkx2.5 promoter and regulatory region; marking cardiac progenitor cells [Wu et al., 2006])
this was associated with loss of GFP+ cardiac progenitors by day 14 (Figure 5—figure supplement
2A–E) and the significant down-regulation of key cardiac markers following treatment with CB-DMB
relative to control DMSO treatment (Figure 5—figure supplement 2F). Importantly not all cardiac

 genes were effected by chronic exposure to the channel inhibitors including Slc8a1, Cacna1c and
Camk2d downstream of Ca2+ signalling (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A), suggesting that the
inhibitors did not simply have a global negative effect on gene expression or cardiomyocyte survival.
Given the proposed role for inward Ca2+ via NCX1, we cultured ESCs in media containing
reduced concentrations of Ca2+ (0.1 mM and 1.0 mM) relative to the normal level of 1.8 mM
(Figure 5C). At the end of the differentiation protocol (14 days) we accessed the percentage of
beating EBs after returning to media with normal levels of Ca2+ for 2 hr. Culture in 0.1 mM Ca2+
resulted in an inhibitory effect on EB beating to the same extent (percentage beating EBs; 1.8 mM,
78.38%, n = 74; 0.1 mM, 28.75%, n = 80; p-value<0.001) as with CB-DMB treatment (Figure 5C) and
culture in 1.0 mM resulted in an equivalent inhibitory effect to that following treatment with nifedi-
pine (Figure 5C; 1.0 mM, p-value<0.01; n = 61). This suggested that influx of external Ca2+ is
required for cardiomyocyte maturation/beating and supports a potential role for NCX1 working in
reverse mode to bring Ca2+ into early cardiac progenitors.
We next investigated whether Ca2+ handling prior to, and concurrent with, the earliest contractile
function impacted on known Ca2+-signalling pathways to activate foetal gene expression, as has
been reported during adult pathological hypertrophy (Molkentin et al., 1998). Calmodulin-depen-
dent kinase II (CaMKII) is a key component of Ca2+ and calcineurin signalling which directly impacts

(Wu
et
al.,
2006;
Molkentin et al., 1998; Passier et al., 2000; Zhang, 2007). Following CB-DMB-induced NCX1 inhi-
bition at day 7 of EB differentiation, activated phospho-CaMKII (pCaMKII) levels were significantly
reduced compared to either DMSO control or nifedipine treatment (mean ± SEM: DMSO, 1.18 ±
0.13; CB-DMB, 0.69 ± 0.15; nifedipine, 1.13 ± 0.06. DMSO vs. CB-DMB, p-value<0.01; CB-DMB vs.
nifedipine, p-value<0.05; n = 3; Figure 5D,D’). NCX1 inhibition at day 4, a stage prior to cardiac
progenitor specification, had no effect on pCaMKII levels (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B,B’).
NCX1 inhibition reduced Ca2+ influx and decreased activation of CaMKII accompanied by signifi-
cantly reduced expression of Mef2c and Myh7 relative to DMSO control (mean ± SEM: Mef2c, 0.71
± 0.13; Myh7, 0.55 ± 0.18; p-value<0.05; n = 6) which, whilst previously associated with pathological
cardiac
hypertrophy,
contribute
here
towards

cardiomyocyte
differentiation
(Figure 5B). In contrast, nifedipine treatment resulted in decreased Myh7, whereas Mef2c remained
unaffected at early stages (Figure 5B).
NCX1 is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation and cardiac
crescent formation
To determine the effect of NCX1 blockade on the subsequent development of the heart, we cul-
tured embryos isolated at E7.25 (the onset of head fold formation and pre-cardiac crescent stage) in
the presence of DMSO, CB-DMB or Nifedipine for 12 hr (Figure 5E). Whilst the embryos remained
viable during the culture period, initiation of heart development was impaired in those treated with

series of Ca2+ transients on stage1-2 embryos at different time points of either CB-DMB or nifedipine treatment, revealed a confinement to the right
side of the embryo prior to complete block (C, D). ESC-derived cardiomyocytes at different days of differentiation were treated with the same channel
blockers: inhibition of NCX1 with CB-DMB (10 mM) significantly reduced contractions only in day 7 cardiomyocytes, whereas KB-R7943 (30 mM) affected
cardiomyocytes at both day 7 and 14 (E). Inhibition of LTCC with nifedipine (10 mM) significantly reduced contractions in both day 7 and 14
cardiomyocytes and to a much greater extent than KB-R7943 at the later stage (F; day 7: DMSO, n = 38; CB-DMB, n = 36; KB-R7943, n = 7; nifedipine,
n = 10; day 14: DMSO, n = 25; CB-DMB, n = 36; KB-R7943, n = 15; nifedipine, n = 15). Time series of Ca2+ transients on day 7 ESC-derived
cardiomyocytes at different time points of either CB-DMB or nifedipine treatment, revealed a confinement prior to complete block (F, G), equivalent to
that observed in the treated embryos (C, D). Treatment of stage 0 embryos prior to the onset of beating with CB-DMB (20 mM) and KB-R7943 (30 mM)
resulted in inhibition of slow asynchronous Ca2+ transients after 15 min application relative to baseline (H, I; DMSO, n = 10; CB-DMB, n = 8; KB-R7943,
n = 9) whereas treatment with nifedipine (10 mM) had no discernible effect on the slow transients (H, J; nifedipine n = 8), supporting the earlier role for
NCX1 in initiating Ca2+ handling and beating. All scale bars 100 mm. Statistics: Freeman-Halton extension of Fisher exact probability test

 CB-DMB compared to DMSO controls (Figure 5E). This was in contrast to treatment with Nifedipine
alone, in which the crescent developed normally and progressed to an equivalent stage as DMSO
treated embryos (Figure 5E). More specifically embryos cultured in the presence of CB-DMB had
reduced expression of cTnT compared to embryos cultured in other conditions. However, most cells
were still positive for Nkx2.5, suggesting delayed or impaired differentiation likely accounted for the
failure of crescent formation under conditions of NCX1 blockade. The relative effects of NCX1 and
LTCC inhibition on developmental progression and crescent formation were supported by corre-
sponding gene expression data from cultured embryos (Figure 5F,G). While Tnnt2 was down-regu-
lated in both CB-DMB and Nifedipine treated embryos, Nkx2.5 was only down-regulated in CB-
DMB treated embryos (Figure 5F,G). Equally Slc8a1, was down-regulated exclusively in the presence
of CB-DMB (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C), whereas Cacna1c was unaltered in the presence of
either inhibitor (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C,D). These data collectively support a role for NCX
in cardiomyocyte differentiation and crescent formation.
Discussion
Previous studies have attempted to investigate how cardiac function develops within the early
embryo. Whilst these studies are informative they rely on the dissociation and culture of embryonic
cardiomyocytes to facilitate physiological measurements resulting in the loss of critical spatial and
temporal information regarding Ca2+-handling and downstream changes in gene expression and
morphology. Using a staging method based on morphological landmarks (stages 0–3), we character-
ized in detail the in vivo progression of physiological activity during early heart development. The
stage series defined correlates with gradual expression of several cardiac related genes and sarco-
mere assembly. We observed spontaneous asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations (SACOs) at stage 0 in the
developing cardiac mesoderm, before any detectable cardiac contractions. These transients
appeared sporadically in individual cells within the forming cardiac crescent and did not appear to
be synchronized. At stage 1, periodic Ca2+ transients began to be propagated laterally through the
cardiac crescent, and traversed the midline of the crescent where there were no visible contractions.
This was a rapid and dynamic process occurring through stages 0–3 that involved sarcolemmal ion
channel and exchanger function. NCX1 was exclusively required for SACOs at stage 0, whereas both

but not with nifedipine (n = 6). EBs cultured for 14 days in different concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ (1.8 mM is the normal culture medium
concentration) revealed significantly decreased incidence of beating following culture with reduced Ca2+ when assessed in media containing 1.8 mM
Ca2+ (C; 1.8 mM, n = 74; 1.0 mM, n = 61; 0.1 mM n = 80). Cultured ESC derived-cardiomyocytes exposed to NCX1 inhibitors effected downstream Ca2+
signalling via alterations in the levels of phosphorylated CaMKII (pCaMKII; D). pCamKII to total CamKII ratio was decreased in the presence of 1 mM
CB-DMB as compared to 10 mM nifedipine and DMSO (D’; n = 3). E7.5 embryos were dissected and cultured for 12 hr in media containing either
DMSO, nifedipine (10 mM) or CB-DMB (3 mM) and stained for cTnT and Nkx2.5 (E; maximum intensity projections, 30 stacks each). Embryos developed
normally in culture, as indicated by head fold formation, coalescence of the cardiac crescent and addition of somites (not shown). Embryos cultured in
CB-DMB were delayed in terms of cardiac crescent formation and show a weaker cTnT signal compared to either DMSO alone or nifedipine-treated (E;
number of affected embryos: DMSO – 1/7; CB-DMB – 7/8; Nifedipine – 1/6). Cultured E7.5 embryos in the presence of either CB-DMB or nifedipine for
12 hr, revealed that CB-DMB significantly down-regulated the expression of both early Nkx2.5 and Mef2c and late Tnnt2 (F, G) cardiac genes,
coincident with impaired cardiac crescent formation, whereas nifedipine-treatment did not appear to have any effect on cardiac gene expression (H).

 NCX1 and LTCC appeared to play equally important roles at stage 1 and 2. NCX1 was no longer
required from stage 3 onwards when the LTCC channels maintained Ca2+ transients. We observed
no contribution of the SR in regulating Ca2+ transients within the cardiac crescent, as assessed by
simultaneous
blockade
of
RyR2
and
InsP3.
However,
consistent
with
previous
studies
(Sasse et al., 2007; Rapila et al., 2008), our data did show that the SR becomes functional at later
stages during cardiac looping (~E8.5). This may represent a period in which SR Ca2+ filling is
required before a threshold for Ca2+ release from the SR can occur, as has been proposed in the
adult setting (Stokke et al., 2011). Overall our data reveals that during the time frame from the ear-
liest cardiac morphogenesis (crescent maturation) to looping of the heart (approximately 18 hr) there
is a rapid transition in the mechanism by which the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ is elevated,
based on distinct channel and exchanger function.
The observation of spontaneous asynchronous calcium oscillations (SACOs) within the forming
cardiac crescent was a surprising finding that, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been
reported in any type of excitable cell. The specific role of SACOs is currently unknown and we
hypothesise that they are required in cells that need to optimally activate Ca2+-dependent signalling
(via the CAMKII pathway) in order to up-regulate genes necessary for further differentiation and
morphogenesis. This would explain why SACOs are present much earlier than complete sarcomere
assembly. An alternative hypothesis is that SACOs are a by-product of cells that are already commit-
ted to specific cardiac lineages and, therefore, arise with the expression of specific channels required
for future function. This could explain the variation in duration and frequencies of SACOs observed
within the same embryo. At this point, quite how SACOs become synchronised transients is
unknown. We speculate that release of a Ca2+-dependent signal from a ’pacemaker’ cell may entrain
neighbours to have synchronised transient periodicity. To this end we observed highly variable Ca2+
periodicity but also regions containing cells of similar periodicity (Video 2). Since blockade of NCX1
prior to the formation of the cardiac crescent, and chronic treatment in ESCs, leads to impaired car-
diac differentiation it is also possible that SACOs may be present in mesoderm cells earlier than
reported here, which we were not able to image due to the limitations of the current experimental
set-up.
In the embryonic heart, Ca2+ handling is assigned to sequential roles for the NCX and LTCC chan-
nels, whereby NCX has been assumed to compensate, at least in part, for the rudimentary (non-func-
tional) SR in the developing mouse heart (Conway et al., 2002). In zebrafish embryos it has recently
been demonstrated that Ca2+ handling and not contraction per se is essential for regulating cardio-
myocyte development (Andersen et al., 2015). Previous studies characterised functional expression
of NCX from E8.5-E9.5 (post-LHT formation) in mouse (Linask et al., 2001; Reppel et al., 2007)
coincident with cardiac looping and significantly later than the onset of the first heat beat described
herein. NCX1 knock-out mice have been generated by multiple groups, with conflicting results in
regards to the phenotype, extent of mutant heart development and the stage at which embryonic
lethality occurs (Wakimoto et al., 2000; Koushik et al., 2001; Reuter et al., 2002; Cho et al.,
2003). This suggests that loss of NCX1 may be compensated for at the level of early cardiomyocyte
specification, differentiation and contraction. In mammals there are three different Na+-Ca2+
exchangers (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3), and it has been previously demonstrated that these three
exchangers share similar physiological properties (Linck et al., 1998; Lytton, 2007). Furthermore,
NCX1 has several splicing variants with exon 1 being mutually exclusive to exon 2 (Lytton, 2007;
Quednau et al., 1997). It is, therefore, possible that either a different NCX or an alternative splice
variant will compensate for loss of the NCX1 variant targeted in the previous studies. Indeed, in all
of the previous NCX1 generic loss-of-function studies, mutant mice were created by targeting exon
2, supporting the possibility that an alternately spliced variant may be able to compensate. Further-
more, precedent for genetic ablation being compensated for over the course of development exists,
whereby patterning defects were muted over time (Bloomekatz et al., 2012). In contrast, our use of
pharmacological channel blockers CB-DMB and KB-R7943, resulted in an acute stage-specific-loss of
NCX1 function which attributed an essential role for NCX1 in generating SACOs, and potentially act-
ing as a trigger to establish the onset of beating in the cardiac crescent and subsequent cardiomyo-
cyte differentiation and morphogenesis. These findings are consistent with the situation in tremblor
(tre) zebrafish which have a mutation in NCX1 leading to absence of normal calcium transients and
cardiac fibrillation (Langenbacher et al., 2005) as well as earlier findings in rodents demonstrating a

 requirement for elevated cytoplasmic calcium to drive cardiac myofibrillogenesis in developing cardi-
omyocytes (Webb and Miller, 2003).
Parallel analyses on ESC-derived cardiomyocytes revealed that lowering the concentration of
Ca2+ in the media had a similar effect on reducing the number of beating EBs as treatment with CB-
DMB. This both reinforced the relative importance of NCX1 and also provided the first indication
that the exchanger may be working in reverse mode, facilitating inward Ca2+ as necessary for cardio-
myocyte differentiation. Furthermore, our use of the inhibitor KB-R7943, previously reported to spe-
cifically inhibit reverse mode NCX1 activity (Brustovetsky et al., 2011), replicated observations
made with CB-DMB, such that at stage 1 and 2 both LTCC and NCX1 are required for sufficient
Ca2+ influx. Whilst inhibition of NCX1 clearly blocked SACOs in stage 0 cardiac crescents, the mech-
anism by which NCX1 alone could lead to periodic oscillations in Ca2+ is still unclear, and may
require oscillations in other ions, such as Na+, and/or contribution of other sarcolemmal proteins,
such as the Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), to regulate Ca2+ efflux while NCX1 is working
in reverse mode. Due to the slow nature of SACOs, oscillations in energy production along with
adenosine triphosphate levels could also be involved in SACO generation, especially with reduced
SR function. Whilst SR inhibition did not prevent stage 3 Ca2+ transients, we have not tested the
involvement of SR function at stage 0 and, therefore, cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca2+ releases
from the SR are involved in the generation of SACOs. The latter has been reported in cultured E8.5–
9 embryonic cardiomyocytes as a pace making mechanism (Sasse et al., 2007; Rapila et al., 2008)
at later stages than were the focus in this study. To further understand the mechanism of NCX1 in
SACO generation will require in vivo electrophysiological analysis to more accurately determine
whether the inhibitory effect of NCX1 blockade with CB-DMB and KB-R7943 is due to effects on
reverse mode NCX1 function (inhibition of translemmal Ca2+ influx) or forward mode NCX1 function
(inhibition of Ca2+ efflux leading to Ca2+ overload), imbalance of Ca2+ homeostasis or off-target
effects. Although the existence of the NCX1 acting in reverse mode is contentious, and the precise
function of KB-R7943 is still debated in the field, it is difficult to otherwise explain how inhibition of
NCX1 can block SACOs. That said, regardless of mode of action, the observation that at stage 0
SACOs were abolished with both CB-DMB and KB-R7943 treatment, but persisted when treated
with nifedipine, suggests that NCX1, and not the LTCC, plays a major role in Ca2+ transient genera-
tion within the early cardiac crescent.
As cardiomyocytes matured, transition to LTCC became the predominant mechanism for inward
Ca2+ entry, as demonstrated by nifedipine-induced inhibition of beating at later stages in both the
embryo and ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. NCX1 expression was further maintained at high levels
during more advanced stages (stage 0-LHT), suggesting a later role in ensuring Ca2+ removal via its
forward mode of action. Of note, the early versus late roles for mammalian NCX1 and LTCC, respec-
tively, are further supported by studies on tre zebrafish, whereby sarcomeric assembly defects in
developing cardiomyocytes following loss of NCX1 function are not recapitulated by mutations in
LTCC (Ebert et al., 2005). Increased expression of NCX1 has also been linked with pathological
hypertrophy and heart failure (reviewed in Sipido et al., 2002), whereby elevated NCX1 is thought
to compensate for defective ECC and depressed function of SERCA but also produce arrhythmo-
genic-delayed after-depolarisations (Go
´mez et al., 1997; Schultz et al., 2004; Venetucci et al.,
2007). Transgenic mice over-expressing NCX1 within the myocardium exhibited a proportional
decrease in contractile function and increased incidence of heart failure, suggesting a decompensa-
tory mechanism with regards to Ca2+ handling (Roos et al., 2007).
Delta isoforms of CaMKII predominate in the heart and are involved in multiple signalling cas-
cades to regulate gene expression, as well as cardiomyocyte physiology including Ca2+ and Na+
homeostasis (Wagner et al., 2006; Aiba et al., 2010). In this study, CaMKII activation was impaired
following NCX1 inhibition in embryonic stem cells, and, moreover, canonical hypertrophy genes,
including Mef2c and Myh7 were down-regulated in response to impaired NCX function during devel-
opment. Whilst changes in gene expression did differ between embryos and ESCs in response to
treatment with different drugs, this likely reflects inherent differences between the in vitro versus in
vivo models, as well as the timing and length of drug exposure. ESCs were exposed at a relatively
earlier stage of cardiac lineage specification and for longer periods, which was not feasible in the
live embryo cultures, resulting in a stronger down-regulation of the genes investigated. Overall
though these findings suggest analogous roles for NCX1 in early heart development and adult

 hypertrophy, with regards Ca2+-handling and foetal cardiac gene induction to promote physiological
or pathological myocyte growth, respectively.
There is recent precedent for a role for Ca2+ in the establishment of other embryonic lineages;
most notably Ca2+ signals are involved in the earliest steps of neurogenesis, including neural induc-
tion and the differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons (Leclerc et al., 2012). Here we show
that pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 and dysregulation of Ca2+ handling from the outset had an
adverse effect on early cardiomyocyte differentiation and led to impaired cardiogenesis in the
embryo (Figure 5). Thus, an early induction of Ca2+-handling preceding beating within cardiac mus-
cle is pivotal for subsequent terminal differentiation and normal heart development.
Materials and methods
Mouse strains, husbandry and embryo collection
All animal experiments were carried out according to UK Home Office project license PPL 30/3155
and 30/2887 compliant with the UK animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the
local Biological Services Ethical Review Process. To obtain wild-type embryos C57BL/6 males (in
house) were crossed with CD1 females (Charles River, England). All mice were maintained in a 12-hr
light-dark cycle. Noon of the day finding a vaginal plug was designated E0.5. In order to dissect the
embryos the pregnant females were culled by cervical dislocation in accordance with the schedule
one of the Animal Scientific Procedures Act. Embryos of the appropriate stage were dissected in M2
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, England).
Embryo staging
Progressive crescent stages were defined based on morphological criteria: the length (medio-lateral
axis) and the maximum height (rostral-caudal axis) of the cardiac crescent was measured for each
embryo. Embryos were considered to be at the LHT stage once both sides of the cardiac crescent
were completely folded and fused. The ratio between width and maximum height measurements
(mm) was used to categorize the embryos from stage 0 through to stage 3 (Supplementary file 1a).
Live imaging – DIC, Ca2+, embryos and cells
Live imaging of embryos, including Ca2+ imaging was performed as previously described, with some
adaptations (Chen et al., 2014). Briefly, freshly dissected embryos were imaged in a mix of 50% phe-
nol red-free CMRL (PAN-Biotech, Germany) supplemented with 10 mM L/glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 50% Knockout Serum Replacement (Life Technologies, England). Initial characterisation of car-
diac contractions was performed using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) imaging on a Spinning
Disk Confocal microscope at 37˚C and an atmosphere of 5% CO2 + Air. Images were acquired at 10
frames per second (fps) for up to 20 s. For all experiments involving Ca2+ imaging, embryos were
loaded with 8 mM of Cal-520 by incubating the embryos in 50% CMRL + 50% Knockout Serum
Replacement with the dye for 15 min at 37˚C and an atmosphere of 5% CO2 + Air. The embryos
were then transferred to fresh media in a MatTek dish (MatTek Corporation, Framingham, MA) with-
out the dye and imaged. To image Ca2+ transients in embryoid bodies (EBs), ESCs were cultured in
hanging drops in MatTek dishes for four days under differentiation conditions. At day 7, the cells
were loaded with 8 mM Cal-520 for 30 min in media without serum at room temperature and then
transferred into media with serum and cultured in the presence of the dye for 10 min at 37˚C and an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 + Air. All Ca2+ imaging was performed with a Zeiss 710 LSM fitted with an
environmental chamber to maintain the embryos at 37˚C at 5% CO2. Embryos were imaged with a
20� air objective (0.6 NA) with a single optical section every 97 ms (~10 frames per second). Images
were captured at 256 � 256 pixel dimensions, with a 2� line step and no averaging to increase the
scan speed. For acute inhibition of Ca2+ transients in embryos (stage 1 to LHT) and EBs, Ca2+ transi-
ents were first imaged at baseline, drug containing media was then added and imaging was per-
formed at 5, 15 and 30 min post drug treatment. Inhibition was defined as the complete cessation
as well as confinement of Ca2+ transients to small regions of the cardiac crescent. For inhibitor
experiments involving stage 0 embryos, imaging was carried out at baseline, 5 and 15 min post
treatment. For all the experiments involving calcium imaging of embryo the overlying yolk sac endo-
derm had to be dissected out in order to allow proper drug and dye penetration, as well as better

 visualisation of the cardiac mesoderm. For experiments involving embryos Nifedipine (Sigma-aldrich)
was used at a final concentration of 10 mM, CB-DMB (Sigma-aldrich) at 20 mM, KB-R7943 (Sigma-
aldrich) at 30 mM, Ryanodine (Tocris Bioscience, England) at 100 mM and 2-APB at 200 mM, all
diluted in DMSO (Sigma-aldrich). We found that most drugs had to be used at a higher concentra-
tion than previously used in studies involving isolated cells, presumably due to penetration difficul-
ties inherent with using whole embryos. Control experiments for Nifedipine, CB-DMB and KB-R7943
were performed with 0.002% DMSO, and for experiments involving dual inhibition with Ryanodine +
2-APB with 0.6% DMSO. All experiments involving embryos were repeated with at least three differ-
ent litters (6–10 embryos). Both embryo and ESC experiments were performed on at least three
independent days.
Embryo culture
Embryos were cultured in the presence of drug (CB-DMB or nifedipine) for 12 hr, from E7.5 to E8.0
using a rolling culture system. Embryos were cultured in a mix of 50% CMRL and 50% Knockout
Serum Replacement at 37˚C and with an atmosphere of 5% CO2+ Air. Only embryos at E7.5, prior
to cardiac crescent and head fold formation were cultured. For these experiments embryos were cul-
tured in the presence of either in 10 mM Nifedipine, 3 mM CB-DMB or 0.0003% DMSO. Experiments
for immunostaining were performed on three independent days, while experiments for qRT-PCR
were performed on four different days for Nifedipine treatments and five days for CB-DMB
treatments.
ES cell culture and cardiomyocyte differentiation
Cardiomyocyte differentiation from ESCs was carried out as previously described using an Nkx2.5-
GFP (Moretti et al., 2006) and Eomes-GFP (Arnold et al., 2009) cell line. Briefly, ESCs were main-
tained in an undifferentiated state by culturing with KO-DMEM (Gibco, England) supplemented with
glutamax (2 mM; Gibco), embryomax FBS (15%; Millipore), nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM; Invi-
trogen, England), penicillin (60U/mL; Gibco), streptomycin (60 mg/mL; Gibco), b-mercaptoethanol
(0.1 mM; Sigma-aldrich) and Leukaemia inhibitory factor (1000 U/ml; Millipore, England). Cardiomyo-
cyte differentiation was induced using the hanging drop culture method (Kattman and Keller,
2007). Approximately 500 ESCs were plated in 20 ml drops of differentiation media (4.5 g glucose/
DMEM, embryomax FBS (20%), nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM), penicillin (60 U/ml), streptomycin
(60 mg/ml), b-mercaptoethanol [0.1 mM]) on the lids of petri dishes and cultured as hanging drops
throughout the first four days of differentiation, allowing embryoid bodies (EBs) to form. At day 4,
the EBs were transferred onto 0.1% gelatin coated plates for a further 10 days of culture before
being collected at day 14 of differentiation. 1 mM CB-DMB and 10 mM Nifedipine were added to the
differentiation media at day 0. For control experiments, DMSO was added at the same concentra-
tion as drug containing media. Once the EBs had been plated at day 4, drug-containing media was
changed every two days up until day 14. To assess the percentage of EBs which were beating, drug
containing media was removed 2 hr prior to assessment and replaced with fresh drug-free culture
media. Culturing of ESCs in different Ca2+ concentrations was achieved using Ca2+ free DMEM
(Gibco) with Ca2+ being added back to the desired concentration (0.1 mM, 1.0 mM, 1.8 mM). For
immunostaining, ESCs were cultured on 0.1% gelatin coated glass coverslips before being fixed with
3.7% PFA for 30 min on ice. For RNA isolation tissue samples were dissociated for 2 min using
0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37˚C prior to snap freezing.
Immunostaining
Dissected embryos were fixed for 1 hr at room temperature with 4% PFA in PBS. The embryos were
then washed 3x in PBT-0.1% (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 15 min, permeabilised in PBT-0.25%
for 40 min and washed again 3x in PBT-0.1%. The embryos were transferred to blocking solution

(Supplementary file 1e) were then added to the solution and incubated o/n at 4˚C. The embryos

shield mounting media with DAPI for at least 24 hr at 4˚C. After fixation ESC samples were rinsed
with PBS before being permeabilised with PBT-0.1% for 10 min, followed by blocking with 10% goat

 serum, 1% BSA in PBT-0.1% for 1 hr. Incubation with primary antibodies, diluted in blocking buffer,
was carried out o/n at 4˚C. After incubation with primary antibodies samples were washed for 3x for
10 min with PBT-0.1% and then incubated with secondary antibodies (Supplementary file 1e)
diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibodies
samples were washed 5x for 5 min in PBS. Samples were mounted using Vectashield mounting
media with DAPI for at least 24 hr prior to imaging with either a 40x oil (1.36 NA) or water (1.2 NA)
objective. Images were captured at a 512 � 512 pixel dimension and tiled 2x2 with a Z-step of 1.5
mm. For embryos each staining was repeated for at least three litters (6–10 embryos per litter). Both
experiments involving embryos and ESCs were performed on at least three independent days and
with two different secondary antibodies.
RNA-extraction and qRT-PCR
RNA extraction of whole embryos, embryonic hearts, head folds and ESC samples was performed
using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, England) according to manufacturer’s instructions: briefly,
homogenisation was carried out with a 21G needle and the extract run through an on-column DNase
I treatment. For P0 and adult heart samples, RNA extraction was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen,
England), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, additional DNase I (Promega, England) treat-
ment on Trizol-extracted RNAs was carried out to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. In order
to collect enough RNA for isolated cardiac crescent and head fold development, each biological
replicate was composed of 10 individual cardiac crescents or head folds. For both types of extrac-
tion, RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free water and the RNA quality and quantity determined
by Nanodrop readings at 260, 280 and 230 nm wavelengths. cDNA was generated from 1 mg of
RNA using random primers and SuperScript III polymerase (Invitrogen). The expression of mRNAs
for genes of interest (Supplementary file 1f), together with endogenous controls (treated embryos
and differentiated ES cells, HPRT, GAPDH, 18 s; in vivo timecourse, GAPDH & HPRT; ES cell differ-
entiation, GAPDH & 18 s (Murphy and Polak, 2002) were measured in triplicate for each sample by
quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, England). Each reaction con-
tained: 8 ng cDNA, 0.5 ml of each primer, 6.5 ml water and 12.5 ml 2 x SYBR Green, made up with
H2O to a final volume of 22 ml. Primers (Sigma-aldrich) were either designed using Primer-BLAST
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health) or obtained from Pri-
merBank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank; Primer 3) or previous publications (primer
sequences in Supplementary file 1f). Primers were designed to span exon-intron boundaries, have
annealing temperatures around 60˚C and generate amplicons between 50–200 bp. The reaction mix-
ture and samples were loaded into either a MicroAmp Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates or MicroAmp
Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates and sealed with Optical Adhesive Films (Life Technologies).
Quantification was performed on a ViiA 7 Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using a PCR pro-
gramme of 95˚C 15 min followed by 40 cycles of (95˚C 15 s melting phase and 60˚C 1 min annealing
and extension). Amplification of a single amplicon was confirmed by obtaining dissociation curve
(melt curve) profiles as well as using gel electrophoresis to separate the reaction product. Cycle
threshold (Ct) values were generated using either Viia7 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene
expression levels were obtained using the DDCt method, in which expression of each gene of inter-
est was normalised to endogenous controls (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008) (Murphy and Polak,
2002), and presented as fold change over a reference sample. For time course data fold-change was
calculated in relation to the earliest stages (E7.75 in vivo, D0 ESC models), whilst for drug treated
experiments fold change was calculated relative to control (DMSO) samples. Non-template controls
were performed by replacing cDNA with water, to test for non-specific amplification.
Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted on ice using direct lysis of cells with NP-40 extraction buffer (150 mM NaCl,
1.0% NP-40, 50 mM Tris (pH8.0)) and 1x protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Eng-
land). Lysates were span at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4˚C and supernatant collected. An aliquot was
taken for protein quantification using a DC protein assay (Bio-rad, England). Supernatants were pre-
pared for SDS-PAGE with the addition of 4x Laemmli sample buffer and boiling at 95˚C for 5 min.
Western blotting was performed using standard SDS-PAGE methods using HRP-conjugated second-
ary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare, England).

 Statistics
All data involving beat rate and qPCR gene levels was compared using one-way ANOVA followed
by a Tukey test for multiple comparisons. In cases where the raw data failed to map to a normal dis-
tribution with consistent variance, we applied Taylor’s law to choose the best transformation for the
data. All data to be analysed passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Bartlett test for homoge-
neous variances. To compare the number of affected embryos upon acute treatments, a Freeman-
Halton extension of Fisher exact probability test was applied due to a smaller number of samples.
To compare the effect of different treatments on the number of beating EBs, due to a large number
of samples, a Chi Square test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed
instead. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out to directly compare temporal gene
expression data from EBs with that derived from embryos; each biological replicate for embryonic
stage was composed of 5–6 embryos and for EBs was composed of 10–80 EBs, depending on the
day of differentiation. The data from each sample was normalized by assessing the ratio with the
maximum value of all samples. A log transformation was applied to the normalized data and the
principal components were calculated using R environment. The 3D representation of the PCA was
constructed by plotting the 3 first components given that these explained more that 95% of the
observed variance. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using Ward’s minimum variance
method as a more precise clustering algorithm to divide the samples in different groups
(Ward, 1963).
Image analysis
A variant of absolute image filter was used to visualize and plot measurements of cardiac contrac-
tions in the developing cardiac crescent as described elsewhere (Chen et al., 2014). Briefly, pixel
displacement, indicative of contractions, was visualized and represented by increased grey levels
within the crescent. Change in pixel intensity was assessed in a selected region, to reveal the con-
traction dynamics. Background Ca2+ signal was subtracted from all frames of a given time-lapse
using ImageJ. To obtain the profiles for Ca2+ transients, regions of interest were plotted using the
ratio between observed fluorescent and minimum fluorescent (F/F0) after background subtraction.
