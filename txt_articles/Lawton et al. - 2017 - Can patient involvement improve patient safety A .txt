ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate the efficacy of the Patient
Reporting and Action for a Safe Environment
intervention.
Design A multicentre cluster randomised
controlled trial.
Setting Clusters were 33 hospital wards within
five hospitals in the UK.
Participants All patients able to give informed
consent were eligible to take part. Wards were
allocated to the intervention or control condition.
Intervention The ward-level intervention
comprised two tools: (1) a questionnaire that
asked patients about factors contributing to
safety (patient measure of safety (PMOS)) and (2)
a proforma for patients to report both safety
concerns and positive experiences (patient
incident reporting tool). Feedback was
considered in multidisciplinary action planning
meetings.
Measurements Primary outcomes were
routinely collected ward-level harm-free care
(HFC) scores and patient-level feedback on safety
(PMOS).
Results Intervention uptake and retention of
wards was 100% and patient participation was
high (86%). We found no significant effect of
the intervention on any outcomes at 6 or
12 months. However, for new harms (ie, those
for which the wards were directly accountable)
intervention wards did show greater, though
non-significant, improvement compared with
control wards. Analyses also indicated that
improvements were largest for wards that
showed the greatest compliance with the
intervention.
Limitations Adherence to the intervention,
particularly the implementation of action plans,
was poor. Patient safety outcomes may represent
too blunt a measure.
Conclusions Patients are willing to provide
feedback about the safety of their care.
However, we were unable to demonstrate any
overall effect of this intervention on either
measure of patient safety and therefore cannot
recommend this intervention for wider uptake.
Findings indicate promise for increasing HFC
where wards implement ≥75% of the
intervention components.

INTRODUCTION
Rates of adverse events during hospital-
isation have been estimated at between
3%
and
16%
globally
and,
despite
increasing attention, have demonstrated
very little improvement over the last
10 years.1 The role that patients could
play in promoting safety and reducing
adverse events is now an international
policy priority. For example, the WHO’s
W
orld Alliance for Patient Safety cites
mobilisation
and
empowerment
of
patients as one of six action areas that
will be taken forward in its ‘Patients for
Patient
Safety’
programme.2
Despite
international emphasis and repeated calls
for greater patient involvement,3 W
achter
referred to the lack of progress in this
area as a ‘troubling gap’, when rating the
achievements of healthcare in promoting

 safety.4 Perhaps even more troubling is the dearth of
research evidence on how best to involve patients and
whether such involvement leads to improvements in
safety. The evidence that does exist indicates that
patients are willing and able to participate in error
prevention
strategies5
that
have
the
potential
to
improve safety.6–9 However, there can be a reluctance
to challenge staff and provide negative feedback that
might directly impact on the quality of their care,10 11
and there is a risk of shifting responsibility for safety
onto
patients.12
Patient
involvement
comes
in
a
variety of forms, from patient education about risk
through to involvement in monitoring the safety prac-
tices of healthcare professionals. The potential for
such interventions to improve communication and
patient experience as well as save money and improve
outcomes is great,13 and early findings suggest that
such outcomes are feasible.14 However, research in
this field is lacking, with systematic reviews conclud-
ing that there is limited and poor quality evidence
that patient involvement has any benefits for patient
safety.15–17
Previous work18–20 has described the development
of tools, based on Reason’s model of organisational
safety,13 that allow patients to provide feedback on
the safety of their care environment to inform local
and
organisational
changes.
One
tool,
patient
measure of safety (PMOS), asks patients to report on
those factors that have been identified in the litera-
ture21 and by patients18 as contributing to patient
safety. These include communication and teamwork,
roles and responsibility, and ward environment. The
second tool, patient incident reporting tool (PIRT)22
asks patients to report on patient safety incidents they
have experienced or witnessed as well as any positive
experiences. Together, information from these two
tools is assimilated and feedback provided to ward
teams, who are asked to convene as a multidisciplin-
ary group to consider the feedback and to make and
implement action plans based on this information.
The feasibility of this intervention known as Patient
Reporting
and
Action
for
a
Safe
Environment
(PRASE) has been reported elsewhere.23 Here, we
evaluate the costs and benefits of the PRASE interven-
tion and its effect on measures of patient safety when
implemented on hospital wards. This study represents
the first randomised control trial (RCT) of the effect-
iveness of a patient feedback intervention to improve
patient safety.
METHODS
This evaluation employed a multicentre, cluster, wait-
list, RCT design to assess the efficacy of the PRASE
intervention in achieving patient safety improvements
over a 12-month period. The published protocol for
the trial is available elsewhere.20
Participants
This study was conducted in 33 hospital wards, across
five hospitals (three National Health Service (NHS)
Trusts) in the UK. At the small district hospital, all
adult non-intensive wards were recruited (N=9). At
the medium-sized teaching hospital Trust, the chief
nurse recruited 10 adult wards to the study. Within
the large Trust, wards (N=14) were asked to volun-
teer to take part. An average of 25 patients meeting
the following eligibility criteria within each ward were
recruited at three different time points: ≥aged 16,
able to give informed consent and minimum period of
4 hours on the ward before questionnaire adminis-
tered. Patients were excluded if they were too ill or
distressed to take part and had already been in the
study within the previous month or were non-English
or non-Mirpuri-speaking patients.
Intervention
The
PRASE
intervention
uses
two
theoretically
informed and validated tools to collect patient feed-
back about the safety of care as a means of achieving
patient-centred service improvement (see logic model
in online supplementary appendix 1). The first tool,
PMOS, is a 44-item questionnaire asking patients to
report on a range of upstream factors that contribute
to safety, for example, communication and teamwork,
physical environment, staff roles and responsibil-
ities.18 19 The second, PIRT
, asks patients to report on
any safety concerns they have experienced during
their inpatient stay and provide detail about what hap-
pened, why they felt it happened, what could be done
to prevent it happening again, and the severity and
preventability of the concern from their (non-clinical)
perspective.
This patient feedback is then collated and presented
to each ward as part of a multidisciplinary meeting
during which ward staff are supported to agree a set
of ward-specific actions to address areas of patient
concern. The philosophy of this intervention is that it
is an iterative process with a cycle of measurement,
feedback and change lasting for a period of 6 months.
W
ard staff engaged in two cycles during the 12-month
intervention period. Following the feasibility study,22
changes were made to the intervention to support
effective implementation. The research team facili-
tated action planning meetings using an action plan-
ning proforma to capture the ward improvement
plans. W
e also launched the project in Trusts at a
start-up meeting and hosted a meeting after the first
set of action planning meetings had been completed
and another at the end of the project. Senior man-
agers were invited to attend these meetings and
agreed to support the wards in delivering change.
Researchers were equally visible on both the control
and intervention wards, as data were collected for the
purposes of feedback as part of the intervention and
outcome measurement. Control wards received their

 PRASE feedback in a single report at the end of the
12 months follow-up period accompanied by a 1-hour
training session on how to interpret and use this
feedback.
Intervention fidelity
Assessment of fidelity followed a previously published
framework24 and was informed by the intervention’s
logic model. W
e conducted a detailed process evalu-
ation to understand how the intervention was received
and used by each of the 17 intervention wards (sub-
mitted for publication). Adherence was assessed in
relation to eight components of the intervention listed
below;
each
was
rated
independently
by
three
members of the research team and, through discus-
sion, consensus was achieved. These scores were based
on data collected by senior researchers (LS, JKO and
CM) who (1) observed and recorded attendance at all
meetings, (2) obtained copies of all action plans devel-
oped by ward teams and (3) conducted a telephone
follow-up with the nominated PRASE lead for each
ward and recorded the extent to which each action
plan was reported to have been implemented. Box 1
shows the scoring of the fidelity of implementation of
each of the eight intervention components.
It was decided a priori that the values of 0 and 1 on
each
of
the
components
would
be
classed
as
non-adherence while scores of 2 or 3 would imply
adherence. Thus, overall fidelity scores ranged from 0
(non-adherence with all components) to 8 (adherence
to all eight components) for each ward.
Outcomes
Each hospital attended a start-up meeting at which the
study was introduced. Baseline data collection then
proceeded on all wards in participating hospitals after
which the wards were then randomised to the two
groups. Follow-up data collection occurred at 6 and
12 months post randomisation on all wards.
Patient safety thermometer
The patient safety thermometer (PST) is a ward-level
routinely collected compulsory measure of patient
harm that was introduced in the NHS in 2012 shortly
prior to the start of this trial. Information is collected
on new and existing cases of four types of possible
‘harm’ (pressure ulcers, venous thromboembolism,
catheter- associated urinary tract infections and falls)
from all patients on a ward on a single day each
month. The key outcome for analysis was harm-free
care (HFC) at the ward level that can range between
0% and 100%; higher scores indicate greater HFC (so
are positive). A baseline was calculated using the
average of the 3 months prior to randomisation; for
the 6-month and 12-month time points, the month
during the collection of patient feedback and the pre-
ceding
and
following
months
were
averaged.
Following experience with the measure during the
trial, a summary from the PST focusing on new harms
only was added as a key outcome. This excluded his-
torical harms occurring prior to admission of the
patient to the specific ward and was therefore deemed
a more sensitive measure of the efficacy of the
intervention.
Patient measure of safety
The 44-item PMOS questionnaire was completed by
patients as part of the intervention and was also used
as an outcome measure. Patients were given the
choice of completing the questionnaire themselves via
a tablet computer or providing responses verbally,
which the researcher then input. Forty-three items
were scored on Likert scales from 1 to 5; one addi-
tional item also required a qualitative response. An
overall PMOS score was calculated for those respond-
ing to at least 80% of items by averaging over item
scores; overall scores were means that ranged from 1
to 5, with high scores indicating more positive
response.
Secondary outcomes
Three secondary outcome measures were also mea-
sured.

 about your care and treatment?”). Second, partici-
pants were asked to complete the ‘NHS Friends and
Family T
est’ question:26 “How likely are you to rec-
ommend this ward to friends and family if they
needed similar care or treatment?”. Both of these
measures are routinely collected within the NHS as
patient-reported indicators of quality of care. Third,
we measured staff perceptions of safety culture using
the four outcome questions from the Hospital Survey
of Patient Safety.27 For further details of secondary
outcome
measures
collected,
see
the
published
protocol.20
Outcome data collection
PMOS data were collected by research nurses during
three periods over 12 months (at baseline, and 6 and
12 months post randomisation). Informed consent was
taken prior to data collection. Research nurses visited
each ward on a daily basis until a minimum of 20
patients were recruited. Routinely available PST data
were
extracted
via
the
Health
and
Social
Care
Information Centre website.28 Data for the purposes of
the assessment of fidelity (see above) were collected by
LS, CM and JKO and were coded by LS, GA and RL.
Sample size
The study was powered to detect a small-to-medium
difference (effect size (ES) =0.3) between the allo-
cated groups with respect to the PMOS score. A
small-to-medium ES seemed a reasonable assumption
as each ward would be focusing on developing and
implementing their own action plans, tailored using
their initial feedback. The intervention was therefore
specific to individual wards and was not expected to
impact on all areas measured by the PMOS. Any
improvement on the PMOS overall score, which sum-
mates across various domains, was therefore likely to
be small. In order to achieve 80% power (with
alpha=0.05) with an average cluster size of 25
patients and assumed intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC) of 0.05, 32 wards were required. This estimate
of ICC seemed reasonable for a trial in secondary care
with a patient-reported outcome.29
The PST was newly introduced shortly prior to the
start of the trial, and the way in which the data would
be formatted (eg, individual data, ward level) for
public availability was unclear at the time.
Randomisation
W
ards were randomly assigned to the intervention or
control group on an equal basis by York Trials Unit.
Minimisation was used to balance groups with respect
to ward type (medical or surgical), age (low, middle
or high based on tertiles), male/female/mixed sex
wards and ward size (low, middle or high based on
tertiles). It was not possible to blind wards to group
allocation, but research nurses who collected data
were blinded.
Statistical methods
Analysis was conducted in Stata V
.13 using the princi-
ples of ‘intention-to-treat’, meaning that wards (and
associated patients) were analysed according to their
randomised trial arm regardless of intervention imple-
mentation or fidelity. Minimisation factors and clus-
tering were accounted for where required; all ES s are
Cohen’s d.30 Statistical significance was assessed at the
two-sided 5% level. Analyses for PST and Hospital
Survey of Patient Safety were conducted at the ward
level; all other outcomes were available and analysed
at the patient level.
The primary analysis on the PST outcome used a
ward-level linear regression model with weighting to
assess differences between the allocated groups in the
percentage of HFC at 12 months. Adjustment was
made for baseline HFC and minimisation factors.
T
wo
sensitivity
analyses
were
preplanned,
an
unadjusted analysis and the primary model adjusted
for ward-level characteristics. T
wo further post hoc
sensitivity analyses were carried out, one repeated
the
analysis
including
one
ward
with
partially
missing baseline data and the second analysed the
data using a repeated measures logistic regression
model with random effects for ward. The primary
analysis was repeated considering new HFC as was
the repeated measures model. A linear mixed model
with random effects to account for clustering at the
ward
level
and
fixed
effects
for
baseline
ward
average and minimisation factors were used for ana-
lysis of the 12-month PMOS data. Cronbach’s alpha
was used to assess the internal reliability (alpha
>0.7) of the PMOS. Complier average causal effect
(CACE)
analysis
was
applied
to
account
for
non-adherence.
Secondary analyses repeated the primary models at
6 months. Similar regression models were used to
analyse the CQUIN and Hospital Survey of Patient
Safety
outcomes
at
the
patient
and
ward
level,
respectively.
For the cost-consequences analysis, we estimated
resource use related to (1) collection of patient data;
(2) action planning meetings; (3) management of the
PRASE intervention via start-up, midpoint and closing
meetings with senior managers and all teams in a hos-
pital; and (4) actions. Resource use was estimated in
terms of the mean value per ward. Unit costs were
retrieved from Personal Social Services Research Unit

RESULTS
Participant flow and recruitment
Thirty-four wards were recruited, two extra than
required to allow for drop out. One ward was
excluded prior to randomisation due to insufficient
number of patients available (figure 1). Thirty-three
wards were randomised (16 allocated to control, 17
to intervention). All wards were retained throughout

periods
ran
between May and July 2013, January and April 2014
and June and September 2014.
The percentage of patients approached who pro-
vided feedback was 89%, 88% and 82% for each time
point, respectively (86% overall). For PST
, average
cluster sizes were large as 3 months worth of data was
used at each time point in order to capture the data
over the same time period as the PMOS; average
PMOS cluster sizes were 25 patients as planned.
Fidelity of the intervention
At 12 months, 11 of the 17 (64.7%) intervention
wards complied with at least 50% of the intervention
components;
a
total
of
four
intervention
wards
(23.5%) complied with at least 75%. These data are
shown in figure 2. One ward barely engaged with the
intervention in either cycle, did not make an action
plan and in the second cycle only the ward manager
met to consider feedback. This ward5 scored zero on
implementation fidelity. Where adherence was low,
this was because wards struggled to pull a multidiscip-
linary team together to develop long-term solutions
to problems and/or to implement action plans.

 observed on all variables (patient age, gender and eth-
nicity) at each time point between allocated groups.
Raw summary scores
Table 2 shows unadjusted summary statistics. At each
time point, both the mean percentage HFC and per-
centage new HFC were high (>90). A ceiling effect
was not observed in the PMOS scores with only three
patients at the highest score of 5. Both PMOS and
PST scores were similar between allocated groups at
each time point. Routinely collected PST data were
not available for one control ward at baseline.
Primary analyses
The reliability of the PMOS questionnaire was high at
each time point (alpha>0.9). A linear mixed model,
conducted on 656 individuals who completed ≥80%
of the questionnaire items, showed a non-significant
difference of 0.08 (p=0.09, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.17,
ES =0.20) between the allocated groups in overall
PMOS score at 12 months (table 3 and figure 3). The
marginal mean was lower in the control group at 3.96
(95% CI 3.90 to 4.02) than in the intervention group
(4.04, 95% CI 3.98 to 4.10). An ICC of 0.03 was
observed; the lower-than-expected ICC counteracts
the loss of power caused by exclusions due to incom-
plete questionnaires. Sensitivity analyses produced
consistent results (table 3). Effects of the intervention
were greater though still non-significant when compli-
ance with the intervention was accounted for.
There was no evidence of a difference in HFC at
12 months between the allocation groups (p=0.99) in
a ward-level analysis, with a non-significant decrease of
0.03% for intervention wards compared with control
wards (95% CI −3.59 to 3.53, ES=−0.01). Adjusted
mean HFC was 92.30% and 92.26% for control and
intervention wards, respectively. Sensitivity analyses
(table 3) produced consistent results.
Harm-free care (excluding old harms)
When the percentage HFC score excluded old harms
that occurred prior to the patient being on the partici-
pating ward, there was again no evidence of a signifi-
cant
difference
between
the
allocated
groups
at
12 months
(p=0.15)
in
a
ward-level
analysis;
however, a larger increase of 1.60% (95% CI −0.62
to 3.83, ES=0.51) was observed for intervention over
control wards. Results from the repeated measures
logistic regression model conducted on individual-
level data were consistent. CACE analysis showed
greater improvements in HFC excluding old harms of
2.42% (50% compliance) and 5.38% (75% compli-
ance) for the intervention group compared with the
control when intervention fidelity was high.
Secondary analyses
Regression models on PST and PMOS 6-month data
produced similar conclusions to the primary analyses
(p=0.57 and 0.58, respectively).

 There was no evidence of a difference between allo-
cated groups in relation to the ward recommendation
to family and friends or the CQUIN component of
finding staff to talk to about worries/fears (p=0.44
and 0.92, respectively). In terms of the Hospital
Survey of Patient Safety, there was also no evidence of
a difference between allocated groups in the propor-
tion of staff favourably grading their ward on percep-
tion of patient safety (p=0.22 and 0.87, respectively).
Costs
Costs largely consisted of collection of patient data
£24,463.80 (35%) and implementation of action
plans £34,639.20 (50%). Implementation had a mean
cost of £1018.80 (SD 1500.03) per ward. There was
no information available to report whether actions
plans related to the second cycle of action planning
were implemented or not. It was assumed that those
actions were partially implemented; therefore, imple-
mentations costs might be underestimated.
DISCUSSION
The RCT was successful in that all wards were
retained throughout the study period and data were
collected from 86% of patients approached. However,
while patients were willing and able to provide feed-
back about safety, many ward teams found it difficult
to meet to develop action plans and implement
change.
The analyses reveal that there was no evidence of a
difference in total HFC or the overall PMOS score
between the allocated groups at 6 or 12 months.
There was also no evidence of a difference in the new

 HFC score (those harms attributable to participating
wards) between the allocated groups at 12 months.
The difference between the two groups was 1.60%
with an ES of 0.51 for this outcome. ESs were higher
for differences in harm reduction between the inter-
vention wards that complied with the intervention
and matched controls. This suggests the possibility
that for those wards that implement the intervention
effectively, reductions in patient harm are feasible. It
should be noted that the study was not powered for
these analyses.
The main costs associated with the intervention
arose from staff time (1) involved in the design and
implementation of actions and (2) associated with
patient
data
collection.
Future
models
for
the
PRASE intervention might use volunteers to collect
patient
data that
would
reduce
substantially
the
overall cost of the intervention. Indeed, this is an
approach
currently
being
piloted
in
three
acute
Trusts in the UK.
Possible explanations for the trial findings—meas-
urement and fidelity—are discussed below.
Measurement issues
Patient safety is universally acknowledged to be diffi-
cult to measure,32 particularly when the intervention
is upstream with the potential to impact on a wide
range of safety and quality outcomes. Our original
primary outcome, the PMOS score, was also part of
the intervention; therefore, we expected action plans
would be focused on improving aspects of this and so
we would be most likely to see an effect using this
measure. The other primary outcome was the inci-
dence of four patient safety harms on participating
wards that was added to assess the impact on patient
safety more generally. There were, however, some
issues with this measure as high levels of HFC were
routinely reported at baseline with a mean score of
>90% and for new harms of >95%, meaning that
achieving a substantial improvement within the trial
was challenging. As with all routine NHS perform-
ance metrics, there is also the possibility of reporting
bias; however, there was no reason that this would
differ systematically between the control and interven-
tion wards.
The intervention provides staff with feedback on
the safety of the care environment, to which they are
asked to respond by implementing local changes and
making senior management aware of broader issues.
This makes it difficult to predict in advance what
changes a ward will choose to make and therefore
what outcomes it might be appropriate to measure.
One ward might focus on noise at night; another
might focus on staff roles and responsibilities. It may
not be possible to pick up improvement in these areas
via the measurement of typical patient safety out-
comes, for example, pressure ulcers, falls and venous
thromboembolisms.
Fidelity of intervention delivery
W
e collected information on the delivery of the inter-
vention, following published guidance.24 The majority
of wards met to consider feedback and many action
planning groups included different types of staff.
However, only three action planning teams included
doctors and nine meetings were attended by only two
people.
For each of the outcomes, and particularly new
harms, the CACE analysis demonstrated larger differ-
ences between the allocated groups as adherence to
the intervention improved. This suggests that when
adherence is high and the ward is able to produce
good quality action plans that are then implemented,
safety
improvements
are
more
likely
to
follow.
Unfortunately, within the current cohort of 17 inter-
vention wards, only 4 were able to comply at this
level, which illustrates the challenge of implementing
changes to practice and clinical routines.
What this study adds to the existing evidence base
A recent systematic review33 identified recommenda-
tions for which patient safety interventions were
strongly encouraged for adoption based on current
evidence. Interventions involving patient feedback or
other patient involvement strategies did not appear on
the list because there are too few rigorous studies of
patient involvement in safety to provide a reliable evi-
dence base. In recent years, a number of studies have
investigated
direct
patient
engagement
in
patient
safety, for example, patient encouragement of hand
hygiene practices.6
7 Systematic reviews of patient
engagement strategies have concluded that there is
currently “insufficient high-quality evidence informing
real-world implementation”.17 Moreover, there is cur-
rently no evidence available that addresses the specific
question of whether patient feedback on patient safety
has an impact on patient safety; therefore, direct com-
parison of our own work with other similar studies is
not possible. However, current and previous studies
on
the
feedback
of
patient-reported
outcomes34
suggest that patients are willing and able to provide
such feedback. What may be more difficult to address
is the engagement of staff with this feedback and the
use of this feedback by healthcare teams to improve
services.
W
e
found
that
staff
needed
additional
support to respond to patient feedback. This finding
echoes that of a study of patient experience feed-
back35 in which feedback of patient experience to
staff had little impact unless supported by ward meet-
ings that were facilitated by research staff. In fact, in
our trial, staff struggled to implement what seemed
like relatively easy changes if they involved the need
for support from other departments in the organisa-
tion, such as pharmacy or estates. These findings res-
onate strongly with recommendations of a recent
report that evaluated the Health Foundation’s Safer
Clinical Systems initiative.36

 Strengths and limitations
This study represents the first RCT of the effectiveness
of a patient feedback intervention to improve patient
safety and was conducted across different wards from
a range of hospitals. One of the key limitations of this
trial was that we did not collect information about the
impact of completing a questionnaire about safety on
the patients themselves. It is possible that completing
such a measure might lead to improvements in
patients’ knowledge and understanding of safety that
could, in turn, lead to a more active role in monitoring
safety but could also have the negative effect of indu-
cing anxiety among patients who were previously
unaware of the potential for things to go wrong. Our
model for change focused on the feedback to staff and
changes
in
their
behaviour
rather
than
patient-
mediated change. Furthermore, it was not possible for
the purpose of the trial to include patients who were
unable to speak English or Mirpuri (a language
spoken by the local Pakistani population). Thus, other
patients were unable to take part. This limitation
could be addressed by the translation of the materials
into common languages spoken by the hospital popu-
lation. However, for the purposes of the research this
was not possible because we did not have the resources
to employ multilingual research staff who would then
be able to take consent from patients in the many dif-
ferent languages spoken across our hospital sites.
Also important to consider are the potential difficul-
ties in the choice of outcome measures for interven-
tions where flexibility in the changes implemented is
actually encouraged. In other words, this was not an
intervention that targeted falls and so where falls
would be the obvious outcome measure. W
ard teams
involved in PRASE might choose to deliver one or
more of a potentially finite number of changes, target-
ing many different patient safety issues, for example,
speeding up the availability of medicines, reducing
noise at night, removing clutter from corridors and
making information about ward team roles available
to patients. Measuring the impact of such changes
without knowing in advance what they might be was
not possible here. Agreement on how best to capture
the impact of such upstream safety interventions is an
important aim for researchers in this field.
CONCLUSION
There is insufficient evidence from this cluster RCT
to recommend the funding of the PRASE intervention.
However, the trial demonstrates that patient reporting
and feedback is feasible and acceptable to patients and
that, where compliance with the intervention is high,
there is potential for it to be effective in reducing
patient harm.
