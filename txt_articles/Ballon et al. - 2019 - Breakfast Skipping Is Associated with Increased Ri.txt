ABSTRACT
Background: Epidemiologic studies have indicated that breakfast skipping is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
However, the shape of the dose-response relation and the influence of adiposity on this association have not been
reported.
Objective: We investigated the association between breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes by considering the
influence of the body mass index (BMI).
Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to August 2017
.
Prospective cohort studies on breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes in adults were included. Summary RRs and
95% CIs, without and with adjustment for BMI, were estimated with the use of a random-effects model in pairwise and
dose-response meta-analyses.
Results: In total 6 studies, based on 96,175 participants and 4935 cases, were included. The summary RR for type 2
diabetes comparing ever with never skipping breakfast was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.46, n = 6 studies) without adjustment
for BMI, and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.34, n = 4 studies) after adjustment for BMI. Nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis
indicated that risk of type 2 diabetes increased with every additional day of breakfast skipping, but the curve reached a
plateau at 4–5 d/wk, showing an increased risk of 55% (summary RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.41, 1.71). No further increase in
risk of type 2 diabetes was observed after 5 d of breakfast skipping/wk (P for nonlinearity = 0.08).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that breakfast skipping is associated with an increased risk of type
2 diabetes, and the association is partly mediated by BMI.

Introduction
Diabetes is a major public health problem and accounts
for the most common noncommunicable diseases in the
21st century (1). Worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes has
increased dramatically, and in 2017 it was estimated that 451

million adults aged 20–79 y had diabetes (8.8% of the world
population). This number is expected to rise to 629 million by
2045 (2). The risk of type 2 diabetes (the most common form
of diabetes) is multifactorial, and lifestyle factors, including
diet, play an important role in the etiology. Evidence from
epidemiologic studies has shown that high intake of red meat
(3), food with high glycemic index or load (4), and sugar-
sweetened beverages (5) were associated with increased risk of
type 2 diabetes, whereas whole-grain products (6) and coffee
consumption (7) were associated with reduced risk. There is also
evidence available that a healthy dietary pattern (e.g., adherence
to a Mediterranean diet) is associated with lower risk of type
2 diabetes (8). Beyond this, studies have indicated that eating
patterns including breakfast skipping are not only related to
weight gain and obesity, but also with insulin resistance and
risk of type 2 diabetes (9, 10). In 2010, between 1.7% and

 30% of adults reported skipping breakfast worldwide (11).
Breakfast skipping is a modifiable behavior factor, and thus of
great public health interest regarding the prevention of type 2
diabetes and its associated burden and costs. A meta-analysis
examining the association between breakfast skipping and type
2 diabetes reported a positive association (12). However, the
influence of BMI, a potential mediator for this association,
was only evaluated in cross-sectional, but not in cohort,
studies (n = 4 studies). In addition, no dose-response meta-
analysis was conducted. Since then, 2 further prospective cohort
studies that investigated breakfast skipping and risk of type 2
diabetes have been published, and thus analyses can be updated
and amplified.
Thus, the aim of our study was to conduct a systematic
review on breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes, and
to summarize findings on ever compared with never skipping
breakfast, in a linear (per 1 d/wk) and nonlinear dose-response
meta-analysis. In addition, we will evaluate if BMI is a mediator
for this association.
Methods
The systematic review was planned and conducted according to
the standards of the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (13).
Search strategy and study selection
The literature search and study selection were conducted by 2 investi-
gators (AB, MN). The search focused on meal patterns, eating habits,
and risk of type 2 diabetes in general, but for this systematic review
and meta-analysis we only included breakfast skipping as exposure.
PubMed and Web of Science were searched until August 2017. The
following search terms were used in combination: (“dining out” OR
“breakfast”OR “lunch”OR “dinner”OR “snack”OR “meal skipping”
OR “eating out” OR “meal” OR “evening meal” OR “meal timing”
OR “meal frequency” OR “eating patterns” OR “meal patterns”
OR “feeding behaviour” OR “meal regularity” OR “fast food”
OR “home food preparation”) AND (“Diabetes” OR “T2D”) AND
(“observational study” OR “prospective” OR “cohort” OR “cohorts”
OR “longitudinal”OR “case-control”OR “retrospective”OR “follow-
up” OR “cross-sectional” OR “population-based” OR “relative-risk”
OR “odds ratio” OR “hazard ratio” OR “incidence rate ratio”).
Studies that were included had to investigate the association between
breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes. The title and abstract of
each study were reviewed. If the title or abstract seemed relevant, the
full text of the record was assessed. We only included peer-reviewed
prospective cohort studies published in English. Abstracts (14–16),
reviews and meta-analyses (12, 17), non-English studies (18), studies
with no RR estimates (19), studies with no relevant data (20), studies
with nonrelevant exposure (21–28) or nonrelevant outcome (29–38),
cross-sectional studies (30–32), ecologic studies (39), and duplicates
were excluded for this report.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The following data were extracted from each study: last name of the first
author, year of publication, the country where the study was conducted,
the cohort name (if any), duration of follow-up, characteristics of the
cohort at baseline (age, sex), total number of participants, number
of cases of type 2 diabetes, exposure (breakfast skipping), exposure
assessment (questionnaire with or without validation, interviews),
outcome assessment (self-report of diabetes with or without objective
medical details, use of diabetes medication, blood test, medical records),
categories of exposure and risk estimates expressed as RRs or HRs with
corresponding 95% CIs, and the adjustment factors. We extracted risk
estimates and 95% CIs with and without adjustment for BMI, if data
were available.
Study quality was evaluated by 2 investigators (AB, SS) with the use
of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (40). Studies were rated on a scale from
0 to 9 following the checklist. A study having a quality score between 4
and 6 or between 7 and 9 was considered as having a moderate or high
quality score, respectively.
Statistical analysis
We used a random-effects model, which takes into account both within-
and between-study variability (41), to calculate summary RRs and 95%
CIs for the associations between breakfast skipping and type 2 diabetes.
The I2 test and Cochran’
s test were used to evaluate the heterogeneity
between studies. I² values of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicated low,
moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively (42). Publication bias
was assessed through the use of Egger’
s test and funnel plots. Asymmetry
of the funnel plot, added to a P value for Egger’
s test <0.10, was
considered to indicate possible publication bias (43).
Different types of analyses were conducted: first, summary RRs and
95% CIs were calculated for ever and never skipping breakfast. Because
obesity is a potential intermediate risk factor on the causal pathway
between breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes, separate models
adjusting for BMI were conducted to evaluate if associations between
breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes were independent of
general body fatness. BMI was not included in all studies as a potential
confounder, and thus, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for this subset
of studies by showing summary RRs (95% CIs) without and with
adjustment for BMI. In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses
to assess potential heterogeneity between studies. The analyses were
stratified by sex, geographic location (United States, Asia), duration
of follow-up (<10 and ≥10 y of age), number of cases (<1000
and 1000 to <2000), quality score (<7 or ≥7), and adjustment for
confounding factors (age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake, total energy,
family history of diabetes mellitus, physical activity, and education).
Heterogeneity between subgroups was evaluated by a meta-regression
analysis (42). Second, we conducted a dose-response meta-analysis on
breakfast skipping per 1 d/wk and summary RR (95% CI) of type 2
diabetes via the method described by Greenland and Longnecker (44).
We computed study-specific slopes (linear trends) and 95% CIs from
the natural log of the RRs and 95% CIs across categories of breakfast
skipping per week. For this analysis we needed the number of cases
per category, the number of person-years, and the exposure value with
RRs and corresponding 95% CIs of ≥3 categories. The distribution
of cases has been estimated for studies that did not report these, but
which provided information on the total number of cases and number
of total participants plus the follow-up period as previously described
in detail (45, 46). For this, the number of person-years per category
was multiplied by the RR in each category (“new person-years per
category”), and summed to obtain “total new person-years.” Then the
proportion between “new person-years per category” and “total new
person-years” was calculated for each category. Finally, this proportion
was multiplied with the total number of cases (reported in the paper),
which yields the number of cases for each category. Studies that did not
quantify the days of breakfast skipping per week were excluded from
the dose-response analysis. If studies reported the breakfast categories
according to ranges (e.g., breakfast skipping 0–3, 4–5, and 6–7 d/wk),
the midpoint between the lower and upper limits was calculated for each
category. For open categories (e.g., breakfast skipping at >5 d/wk), a
similar range to the adjacent category was assumed.
Third, a potential nonlinear dose-response relation between break-
fast consumption and summary RR (95% CI) of type 2 diabetes was
assessed, through the use of a restricted cubic spline model, with 3 knots
at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the frequency of breakfast
skipping (47). To evaluate the difference between the linear and the
nonlinear model, a likelihood ratio was used to test for nonlinearity.
All statistical analyses were performed with the use of Stata version
14.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

 Results
Literature search
Out of the 2920 studies identified, 45 articles were considered
for inclusion, and after screening the full texts, 6 met the
inclusion criteria (Supplemental Figure 1). The characteristics of
the studies are shown in Supplemental Table 1 with according
Supplemental References. Four studies were conducted in the
United States and 2 in Japan. The duration of follow-up ranged
from 6 to 18 y of age. According to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
2 studies had a moderate quality score and 4 had a high quality
score (Supplemental Table 1).
Ever or never skipping breakfast and risk of type 2
diabetes
Six studies (9, 10, 48–51) were included in the meta-analysis
of ever or never skipping breakfast and risk of type 2 diabetes,
involving 4935 cases among 96,175 participants. The summary
RR for type 2 diabetes was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.46;
I2 = 16.5%, Pheterogeneity = 0.307; n = 6 studies), comparing ever
with never skipping breakfast (Figure 1A). Out of the 6 studies,
4 (9, 10, 48, 51) provided results both adjusted and not adjusted
for BMI. The summary RR for the risk of type 2 diabetes not
adjusted for BMI was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.44) in these studies
and adjusted for BMI 1.22 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.34; I2 = 15.3%,
Pheterogeneity = 0.315) (Figure 1B), respectively.
There was no significant heterogeneity between subgroups
after stratification by sex, geographic location, duration of
follow-up, quality scores, and adjustments for confounding
factors (Table 1).
There was an indication of publication bias with P < 0.001
from Egger’
s test and according to the funnel plot. Asymmetry
was represented by the lack of small studies with negative results
(Supplemental Figure 2). Through the use of the trim and fill
method, 3 studies were added and findings did not change
appreciably (summary RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.44; based on
6 studies without adjustment for BMI), compared with our main
findings.
Dose-response meta-analysis on breakfast skipping and
risk of type 2 diabetes
Three studies were included in the dose-response meta-analysis
(48, 49, 51). The summary RR for type 2 diabetes per 1
d of breakfast skipping/wk was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.09;
I2 = 15.1%, Pheterogeneity = 0.308) (Figure 2A). When we
considered adjustment for BMI in our linear dose-response
meta-analysis, 2 studies remained and the summary RR for
type 2 diabetes was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09; I2 = 0%,
Pheterogeneity = 0.405).
The summary RR of type 2 diabetes increased with
the
number
of
days
of
breakfast
skipping,
reached
a
peak at 4–5 d of breakfast skipping/wk, and no further
increase in risk of type 2 diabetes was observed beyond this
(Figure 2B). However, the test for nonlinearity did not reach
statistical significance (P for nonlinearity = 0.08). Skipping
breakfast for 4–5 d/wk was associated with 55% increased RR
of type 2 diabetes (summary RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.41, 1.71)
(Figure 3). When we included the BMI-adjusted RRs (95% CIs)
(available in 2 out of 3 studies) in our nonlinear dose-response
meta-analysis, the shape of the associations remained similar,
but the summary RRs were slightly attenuated. The summary
RR of type 2 diabetes for 4–5 d breakfast skipping/wk was
1.40 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.70), with P for nonlinearity = 0.19.

The result of our meta-analysis on breakfast skipping and
risk of type 2 diabetes, in prospective studies only, is in
line with the result of the previous meta-analysis (12). Ever
compared with never skipping breakfast was associated with
a 32% increased RR of type 2 diabetes. Even though the
effect was slightly attenuated after adjustment for BMI, the
association persisted. The linear dose-response meta-analysis
adds to current knowledge that breakfast skipping 1 d/wk
was associated with a 6% increased RR of type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, the most important adverse effect was observed
for 4–5 d/wk of breakfast skipping.
There are several potential mechanisms that can explain
the association between breakfast skipping and risk of type
2 diabetes. It has been shown that breakfast skipping was

associated with an increase in body weight and higher
prevalence of obesity, which are known risk factors for type
2 diabetes (52, 53). In our analysis, we compared the findings
without and with adjustment for BMI. Our findings showed
that the association between breakfast skipping and type 2
diabetes was partly mediated by BMI, but a positive association
still persisted, which indicates that other factors might have
an influence on this association. Studies have reported that
the consumption of breakfast is not only associated with
increased satiation and appetite regulation, but also with a
higher dietary quality in general including higher intake of
fiber, vitamins, and minerals and lower intake of added sugars
(54), which might have an influence on the risk of type 2
diabetes. Most of the studies included in our systematic review
and meta-analysis adjusted for dietary factors (51), dietary
pattern scores (9, 10), or a dietary quality score (48), indicating
that breakfast skipping is independently associated with risk
of type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, the strongest association with
type 2 diabetes was observed for the combination of breakfast
skipping and having a Western dietary pattern among men from
the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (10). Moreover, it has
been shown that breakfast skipping was associated with poor
glycemic control (defined by fasting plasma glucose) in patients
with type 2 diabetes and in healthy individuals (55, 56), as well
as with other cardiometabolic risk markers such as LDL- and
HDL-cholesterol in young adults (57). A recent clinical study
indicated that longer fasting periods, due to breakfast skipping,
were associated with a higher inflammatory response after
lunch (29). These cardiometabolic and inflammatory alterations
might influence the risk of type 2 diabetes. Beyond breakfast
skipping, it has been recently reported that the quality of
breakfast also has an influence on long-term hyperglycemia
and cardiometabolic risk markers (58). A breakfast high in
processed meat and low in whole-grain cereals was associated
with higher levels of adverse cardiometabolic risk, defined
by glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, TGs, and LDL
and HDL cholesterol. Altogether, these findings emphasize the
importance of the consumption of a high-quality breakfast
regarding the prevention of type 2 diabetes.
For this meta-analysis of observational studies, possible lim-
itations must be taken into consideration. Different definitions
of breakfast skipping were used among the included studies [less
than just a roll and a cup of coffee (49), no evidence of a given
definition (10, 48, 50, 51), or less than coffee and tea (9)]. In
addition, the categories of breakfast skipping or consumption,
respectively, varied from yes/no to every day/almost every
day/3–5 days per week/1–2 days per week/none. However, we
conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to account for these
different comparisons. Moreover, the underlying studies only
adjusted for BMI, a marker of general obesity, but not for
markers of abdominal obesity, such as waist circumference.
Studies have shown that BMI was strongly correlated with
waist circumference and even with body fat (59); however, BMI
does not control for body fat distribution, which might be of
greater importance regarding the risk of type 2 diabetes (60).
Furthermore, breakfast skipping might also be associated with
other unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. For example, it has been
reported that breakfast skippers are more often smokers, are
less physically active, and have a higher alcohol consumption
and a higher intake of total energy compared with breakfast
consumers (54). However, most of the studies included in
our meta-analysis adjusted for known confounding factors
(physical activity, fat intake, total energy, etc.), although residual
confounding cannot be ruled out. There was evidence for
publication bias indicating that small studies with negative
results were missing. The Cochrane collaboration recommends
that ≥10 studies are necessary to obtain clear conclusions on
publication bias (61). We used the trim and fill method and our
findings did not change substantially. However, more research
investigating the association between breakfast skipping and
risk of type 2 diabetes is needed. Finally, included studies were
only performed in the United States and in Asia, hence the
results obtained can only be applied for those regions.
Strengths of the present report include the prospective study
design of the underlying studies, which avoids recall bias
and reduces the potential for selection bias. In addition, to
our knowledge this is the first report focusing on linear and
nonlinear dose-response relations between breakfast skipping
and risk of type 2 diabetes, which clarified the shape of the
association.
In conclusion, the study indicated that there is an association
between breakfast skipping and risk of type 2 diabetes. The
association is partly mediated by obesity, but associations
are still significant after adjustment for BMI. To strengthen
the evidence on this association, more studies are warranted,
especially from different geographic locations because the
current evidence came from only the United States and Asia.
Future studies should also focus on breakfast quality to
support public health recommendations regarding breakfast
consumption and health.
