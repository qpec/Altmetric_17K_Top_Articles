BACKGROUND
Antiarrhythmic drugs are used commonly in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for 
shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, but with-
out proven survival benefit.
METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared parenteral amiodarone, lido-
caine, and saline placebo, along with standard care, in adults who had nontrau-
matic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulse-
less ventricular tachycardia after at least one shock, and vascular access. Paramedics 
enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival 
to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at 
discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly 
assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial 
drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless 
ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.
RESULTS
In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amioda-
rone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, 
respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for 
amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval 
[CI], −0.4 to 7.0; P 
= 
0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% 
CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P 
= 
0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage 
points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P 
= 
0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar 
in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to 
whether the arrest was witnessed (P 
= 
0.05); active drugs were associated with a 
survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among pa-
tients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. 
More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients 
of lidocaine or placebo.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of 
survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among pa-
tients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular 
fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung,

O
ut-of-hospital cardiac arrest is 
responsible for more than 300,000 deaths 
each year in North America.1 Many out-
of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ven-
tricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachy-
cardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless 
ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most 
treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest because of its responsiveness to shock,2 
most defibrillation attempts do not result in 
sustained return of spontaneous circulation.3 
Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular 
tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after 
shock, and there is a significant inverse relation-
ship between the duration of ventricular fibrilla-
tion or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the 
frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation 
outcome.4-6
Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly 
to promote successful defibrillation of shock-
refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ven-
tricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In 
controlled trials involving patients with out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest, those who received ami-
odarone were more likely than those who received 
placebo or lidocaine to have a return of sponta-
neous circulation and to survive to be admitted 
to the hospital,7,8 but the effects of amiodarone 
on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic 
outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowl-
edge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, 
lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital 
discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due 
to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulse-
less ventricular tachycardia.
Methods
Trial Conduct and Oversight
The background and methods of the trial were 
described previously.9 Paramedics from 55 emer-
gency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled 
patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 
North American sites participating in the Resus-
citation Outcomes Consortium (ROC).10 The trial 
was conducted under exception from informed 
consent in emergency research in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by 
the Food and Drug Administration and Health 
Canada, approval by institutional review boards in 
participating communities, and monitoring by an 
independent data and safety monitoring board 
appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI).
The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and oth-
ers (see the support statement at the end of the 
article). In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided 
the trial drugs without cost and tested the stabil-
ity of these products over the trial duration but 
otherwise played no role in the trial. The investi-
gators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, 
analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the 
manuscript draft (the first author); and made the 
decision to submit it for publication. The trial 
statisticians had full access to all trial data and 
take responsibility for their integrity, analytic 
accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity 
of this report to the trial protocol, which is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
Patients
The trial included patients 18 years of age or 
older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrilla-
tion or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined 
as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or re-
current (restarting after successful termination) 
ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular 
tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime 
during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms inter-
preted as being shockable by an automated ex-
ternal defibrillator). Eligible patients were also 
required to have intravenous or intraosseous 
vascular access. We excluded patients who had 
already received open-label intravenous lidocaine 
or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known 
hypersensitivity to these drugs. A complete list 
of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org.
The trial protocol specified that the primary 
analysis population (the per-protocol population) 
would include only those randomly assigned par-
ticipants who actually met the eligibility criteria, 
who received any dose of a trial drug during 
shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulse-
less ventricular tachycardia, and who were con-
firmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) 
cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation 
or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses 
were also performed in all randomly assigned 
patients (the intention-to-treat population).

Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Cardiac Arrest
Interventions
The trial evaluated licensed parenteral prepara-
tions of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently 
approved Captisol-based formulation of amioda-
rone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is de-
signed to reduce hypotensive effects.11,12 Trial 
drugs were packaged in identically appearing, 
sealed kits each having three identically formu-
lated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of color-
less fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone 
(totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg 
of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or 
normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents 
were indistinguishable except by numerical code 
and were randomly distributed to EMS providers 
in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed 
in permuted blocks of concealed size and was 
stratified according to participating site and agen-
cy. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability 
and were confirmed to maintain their integrity 
in the simulated climates of trial communities.9
Treatment Protocol
Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
treated in accordance with local EMS protocols 
that complied with American Heart Association 
(AHA) guidelines for advanced life support.13 Some 
patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial com-
paring continuous chest compressions with in-
terrupted chest compressions during cardiopul-
monary resuscitation (CPR).14
After the failure of one or more shocks to 
terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless 
ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, 
eligible patients received a vasopressor and were 
then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s 
act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked 
contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) de-
termined the patient’s random assignment (de-
tails are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel 
were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The 
initial dose of a trial drug, approximating cur-
rent clinical practice, consisted of two syringes 
(one syringe if the estimated body weight was 
<100 lb [45.4 kg]) that were administered by 
rapid bolus.10,15,16 If ventricular fibrillation or pulse-
less ventricular tachycardia persisted after the 
initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscita-
tion measures, and additional shocks, a supple-
mental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was 
administered. Thereafter, standard interventions 
for advanced life support ensued according to 
local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or 
amiodarone before hospitalization.
Post–Cardiac Arrest Care
All trial interventions were completed before hos-
pital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers 
were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the 
trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac 
arrest care in accordance with published AHA 
guidelines,17 including open-label amiodarone or 
lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital 
care were monitored but were not standardized 
by the trial protocol, and their performance was 
reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s 
trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care 
providers, investigators, or site personnel unless 
emergency unblinding was requested, and then 
only to the treating physicians.
Data Collection and Outcomes
Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-
process measures, and data from hospital medi-
cal records were collected as described in the 
Supplementary Appendix. The primary outcome 
of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. 
The main aim was to compare survival in amio-
darone recipients versus placebo recipients, with 
secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine 
recipients versus placebo recipients and in amio-
darone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The 
secondary outcome was survival with favorable 
neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score 
on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symp-
toms] to 6 [death]) of 3 or less, indicating the 
ability to conduct daily activities independently 
or with minimal assistance.18 These outcomes 
were determined in both the per-protocol popu-
lation (the primary analysis) and in the inten-
tion-to-treat population.
Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for 
exploratory purposes included the number of de-
fibrillation shocks administered after receipt of 
the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation 
at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital 
treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sus-
taining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were 
defined according to status with respect to wit-
nessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, 
witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt 
of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location 
of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-

of trial-drug administration (intravenous or in-
traosseous), treatment group in the concurrent 
trial of continuous or interrupted chest compres-
sions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the 
trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administra-
tion practice (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse events were considered to be drug-
related if they were reported previously with these 
medications19,20 (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophle-
bitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical 
seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring tem-
porary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 
24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious 
or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial 
interventions21 and complications related to vas-
cular access were also assessed. Other adverse 
events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or 
pneumonia, which are common after out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were 
not considered to be drug-related unless imbal-
anced between trial groups.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the 
per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) 
would provide 90% power to detect an absolute 
difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of 
survival to hospital discharge between the amio-
darone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 
23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated 
from patients with a first recorded rhythm of 
ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular 
tachycardia who received at least two shocks in 
previous ROC trials.22,23 The projected difference 
in survival with amiodarone was estimated from 
a previous trial database7 and was the compari-
son for which this trial was powered.
Survival was evaluated across groups with the 
use of the z-test for comparison of binomial pro-
portions with pooled variance, with a one-sided 
significance level of 0.025 for comparisons be-
tween an active drug and placebo (based on the 
monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05 when comparing amio-
darone with lidocaine.9 All comparisons in this 
report, including testing interactions, were recal-
culated as two-sided with P values of less than or 
equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance (as most comparisons were initially per-
formed), which did not substantially change the 
results.
The data and safety monitoring board per-
formed interim reviews twice a year with the use 
of group sequential methods with formal stop-
ping boundaries; final differences and 95% con-
fidence intervals for the primary outcome were 
adjusted accordingly.9 Apart from this, there were 
no adjustments for multiple comparisons.
Results
Trial Populations
The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed 
enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 pa-
tients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventric-
ular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycar-
dia at some time and were potentially eligible for 
enrollment in the trial (Fig. 1). The intention-
to-treat population of 4653 patients was com-
posed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 
6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 
8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 com-
prised the per-protocol population of trial-eligi-
Figure 1 (facing page). Screening and Randomization.
The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on 
their clinical and cardiac‑rhythm characteristics at the 
time of potential trial‑drug receipt. Of 46 patients in 
protected populations who were determined to be in‑
eligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were 
prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had 
“other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination 
and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lido‑
caine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for 
nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, 
arrival at the hospital before the trial‑drug kit was 
opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted 
defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) ac‑
cess, and a need for extrication of the patient. The in‑
tention‑to‑treat population excluded patients in protect‑
ed populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children 
and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned 
to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The 
intention‑to‑treat population included all patients for 
whom a trial‑drug kit was opened, regardless of their 
eligibility, initial cardiac‑arrest rhythm, or actual re‑
ceipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the 
intention‑to‑treat population were excluded from the 
per‑protocol population (Table S1 in the Supplemen‑
tary Appendix). The per‑protocol population was com‑
posed of randomly assigned, trial‑eligible patients 
whose initial cardiac‑arrest rhythm was ventricular fi‑
brillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), 
who continued to have shock‑refractory VF/VT, and 
who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes

and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrilla-
tion or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were 
randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 
patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), ex-
cluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol 
criteria (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug as-
signment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and 
was proportionately similar across trial groups.
The baseline patient characteristics and event 
characteristics in the per-protocol population 
were well balanced across trial groups (Tables 1 
and 2). The first dose of the trial drugs was 
given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the 
initial call to EMS and after a median of three 
shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been 
administered.
Outcomes
Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all pa-
tients in the per-protocol population (Fig. 1). 
Among amiodarone recipients in the per-proto-
col population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital 
discharge (the primary outcome), as compared 
to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 
(21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk 
difference for the primary comparison of amio-

=

age points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P

the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus 
lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, 
−3.2 to 4.7; P 
= 
0.70) (Table 3). Rates of survival 
with favorable neurologic status (the secondary 
outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group 
(182 patients [18.8%]), lidocaine group (172 
[17.5%]), and placebo group (175 [16.6%]). The 
risk difference for the secondary outcome for 
amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage 
points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P 
= 
0.19); for lido-
caine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% 
CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P 
= 
0.59); and for amiodarone 
versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, 
−2.1 to 4.8; P 
= 
0.44).
Subgroups
There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with 
respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest was witnessed (P 
= 
0.05 for inter-
action); active drugs were associated with a 
higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than 
the rate with placebo among patients with wit-
nessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Among 1934 pa-
tients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the sur-
vival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or 
lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). 
This absolute risk difference was significant for 
amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 
95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P 
= 
0.04) and for lidocaine 
versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 
0.5 to 9.9; P 
= 
0.03), but did not differ signifi-
cantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 
percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P 
= 
0.97). 
The survival rate was also higher among amio-
darone recipients than placebo recipients with 
EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 
percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P 
= 
0.01). 
Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival 
did not differ significantly between trial groups. 
No other significant interaction with treatment 
was found in other prespecified subgroups.
Mechanistic Outcomes
After randomization, placebo recipients were 
more likely to require an additional dose of 
blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone 
or lidocaine, and they received a greater number 
of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control 
medications (Table 2). More lidocaine recipients 
than placebo recipients had sustained return of 
spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival (Ta-
ble 3). Patients were more likely to survive to 
hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone

or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer 
recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of pla-
cebo required CPR during hospitalization (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Use of open-
label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-
label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of 
hospitalization was also less common in the amio-
darone group than in the lidocaine or placebo 
groups.
Adverse Events
In the per-protocol population, the overall fre-
quency of prespecified drug-related adverse 
events did not differ significantly among pa-
tients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or 
placebo, nor did serious adverse events (Table 4, 
and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
There was a greater need for temporary cardiac 
pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than 
after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).
Intention-to-Treat Population
Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat popu-
lation had balanced baseline characteristics 
across trial groups (Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). There were no significant differ-
ences between the trial groups in the rates of the 
primary and secondary outcomes (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). There were also 
no significant differences between the trial groups 
in the rates of drug-related adverse events or seri-
ous adverse events (Tables S7 and S8 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, prehospital trial, we found that treat-
ment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not re-
sult in a significantly higher rate of survival to 
hospital discharge or favorable neurologic out-
come at discharge than the rate with placebo 
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by 
shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or 
pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also 
no significant differences in these outcomes be-
tween amiodarone and lidocaine.
Two previous small, randomized trials showed 
significantly higher rates of return of spontane-
ous circulation and hospital admission with 
amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after 
shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.7,8 
The current trial, which was larger and per-
formed in the context of well-executed CPR, 
showed similar benefits with respect to short-
term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time 
to treatment with these drugs was typically late 
across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from 
the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 
minutes in the others.7,8 Such delays may attenu-
ate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interven-
tions as patients progress to the metabolic phase 
of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular 
injury and physiological derangements may be 
irreversible despite restored circulation.24
Our results could be interpreted in several 
ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be 
ineffective in this population because they lack 
antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circula-
tion. This explanation seems unlikely, given that 
both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termi-
nation of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibril-
lation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with 
fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with 
higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted 
in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic thera-
pies during hospitalization, which could even be 
taken as potential mechanisms for improved 
survival. Drug-related adverse events could also 
have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, 
because no significant between-group differences 
were observed in the frequency of adverse events. 
Conversely, because hospital care was not stan-
dardized, treatment imbalances between trial 
groups might have attenuated the survival ben-
efit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the 
trial was randomized and blinded throughout, 
and the frequency of coronary catheterization, 
therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-
sustaining treatments did not differ significantly 
across trial groups.
The effectiveness of active treatment could 
also depend on physiological conditions, timing, 
and patient characteristics. We observed an in-
teraction of treatment with the witnessed status 
of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often 
taken as a surrogate for early recognition of 
cardiac arrest, a short interval between the pa-
tient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the ini-
tiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of 
therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespeci-
fied, this subgroup analysis was performed in 
the context of an insignificant difference for the 
overall analysis, and the P value for heterogene-
 n engl j med 
 nejm.org

Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Cardiac Arrest
ity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for 
the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonethe-
less, the suggestion that survival was improved 
by drug treatment in patients with witnessed 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence 
of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, mer-
its thoughtful consideration.
Finally, the point estimates of the survival 
rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone 
group differed less than anticipated when the 
trial was designed, which suggests that the trial 
may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has 
a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, 
approximately 9000 patients across the three 
trial groups would be needed to establish this 
difference in outcome with 90% power. Though 
seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference 
of 3 percentage points in survival with drug 
therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives 
could be saved each year in North America alone 
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Several limitations of this trial should be 
considered. Selection bias could have influenced 
trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonen-
rollment were systematically tracked, and ques-
tionable instances of exclusion were numerically 
small. The trial tested only one administration 
strategy without active-treatment crossover; oth-
er strategies may produce different results. Last, 
enrollment of patients whose condition at ran-
domization afforded little or no chance of sur-
vival irrespective of treatment may have diluted 
the presence of a more robust treatment effect in 
others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than 
had eligibility been more selective.25
In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we 
found that overall neither amiodarone nor lido-
caine resulted in a significantly higher rate of 
survival to hospital discharge or favorable neuro-
logic outcome than the rate with placebo among 
patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due 
to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation 
or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
