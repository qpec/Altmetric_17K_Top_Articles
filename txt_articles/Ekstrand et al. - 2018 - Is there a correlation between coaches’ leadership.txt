background Do coaches’ leadership styles affect 
injury rates and the availability of players in professional 
football? Certain types of leadership behaviour may 
cause stress and have a negative impact on players’ 
health and well-being.
Aim To investigate the transformational leadership 
styles of head coaches in elite men’s football and to 
evaluate the correlation between leadership styles, injury 
rates and players’ availability.
Methods Medical staff from 36 elite football clubs 
in 17 European countries produced 77 reports at four 
postseason meetings with a view to assessing their 
perception of the type of leadership exhibited by the 
head coaches of their respective teams using the Global 
Transformational Leadership scale. At the same time, they 
also recorded details of individual players’ exposure to 
football and time-loss injuries.
results There was a negative correlation between 
the overall level of transformational leadership and 
the incidence of severe injuries (rho=−0.248; n=77; 
p=0.030); high levels of transformational leadership 
were associated with smaller numbers of severe injuries. 
Global Transformational Leadership only explained 6% 
of variation in the incidence of severe injuries (r2=0.062). 
The incidence of severe injuries was lower at clubs 
where coaches communicated a clear and positive 
vision, supported staff members and gave players 
encouragement and recognition. Players’ attendance 
rates at training were higher in teams where coaches 
gave encouragement and recognition to staff members, 
encouraged innovative thinking, fostered trust and 
cooperation and acted as role models.
Conclusions There is an association between injury 
rates and players’ availability and the leadership style of 
the head coach.
InTrOduCTIOn
Match, training and muscle injury rates in elite 
men’s football have remained largely unchanged 
overall since 2000.1 2 This would suggest that 
preventive strategies targeting player-related risk 
factors are not, on their own, sufficient to signifi-
cantly reduce injury rates at elite level.3 Accord-
ingly, alternative risk factors need to be investigated 
in order to determine whether there is a correlation 
with injury rates and allow the most appropriate 
preventive measures to be adopted.3 
When the chief medical officers of the clubs 
participating in the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study1 
were asked for their views on the most important 
risk factors contributing to injuries, the four most 
common factors listed were: (1) the workload 
imposed on players, (2) players’ well-being, (3) the 
quality of internal communication and (4) the head 
coach’s leadership style.1 3–5
Leadership involves influencing others with a 
view to achieving a common goal and facilitating 
circumstances and environments that will help to 
reach that goal.6 7 There are various ways of char-
acterising leadership, one of which is to look at it 
in terms of three major leadership styles: transfor-
mational (democratic/participative), transactional 
(authoritarian/directive) and laissez-faire.8 Trans-
formational leadership involves motivating and 
inspiring followers to go beyond their self-interest 
for the benefit of collective interests by providing 
vision, meaning, challenges and stimulation.8 
Transactional leadership is based on rewarding and 
disciplining followers on the basis of their achieve-
ments or failures, while laissez-faire leadership is, in 
essence, an absence of leadership.8
Research in the area of sports psychology indi-
cates that transformational leadership on the part of 
coaches is associated with higher levels of motiva-
tion and performance,9–12 improved development 
and skill gains,13 increased well-being,14 increased 
satisfaction,10 11 15 16 reduced aggression,17 increased 
task/team cohesion10 18–20 and increased willingness 
to make personal sacrifices for the good of the 
team.19 However, no study has yet investigated the 
correlation between leadership styles and physical 
injuries. A coach’s leadership style could cause an 
increase in stress levels and reduce a player’s ability 
to cope,21 22 and we know that stress, in turn, is 
linked to the risk of injury.23–26
We aimed to investigate the transformational lead-
ership of coaches of elite football teams and eval-
uate the correlation between their leadership styles 
and injury rates and the availability of players for 
training and matches. Our hypotheses were that (1) 
transformational leadership is negatively correlated 
with injury rates and positively correlated with the 
availability of players for training and matches and 
(2) that certain elements of transformational leader-
ship are more important than others in this regard.

their head coaches. A total of 77 reports were produced at those 
meetings. Data on injuries and exposure to football were also 
collected from the 36 teams for each of the four seasons.
The number of reports collected per club during the 4-year 
study period ranged from one to four, with a median of two.
data collection
Outcome measures/dependent variables: injury data
Data on injuries were collected in accordance with the consensus 
statement on injury definitions and data collection procedures in 
studies of football (soccer) injuries,27 and the general method-
ology was identical to that employed by Hägglund et al.28
An injury was defined as any physical complaint suffered by a 
player that resulted from a football match or a training session 
and led to that player being unable to participate fully in a future 
training session or match (ie, a time-loss injury). Players were 
regarded as injured until such time as the club’s medical staff 
allowed full participation in training and made the player avail-
able for selection for matches. A severe injury was defined as 
an injury causing an absence from training or matches lasting 
more than 28 days. Baseline data on players was collected when 
players were first included in the study, as was players’ consent 
to participate in the study. A member of the club’s medical staff 
recorded individual players’ exposure to football (in minutes) 
for all training sessions and matches. Injury and attendance 
reports were sent to the study group once a month. Reports were 
checked by the study group on receipt, with prompt feedback 
sent to the clubs in order to correct any missing or unclear data. 
Each injury was coded in accordance with a modified version of 
Orchard Sports Injury Classification System 2.0.9.
The risk of players being injured over a season was evaluated 
for each team on the basis of four criteria that have previously 
been found to be correlated with team performance.29
i. 
Injury burden: (total number of days of absence/total number 
of hours of exposure) × 1000. This variable accounts for the 
incidence and severity of injuries in a season.
ii. Incidence of severe injuries: (total number of injuries causing 
absences of more than 28 
days/total number of hours of 
exposure) × 1000.
iii. Attendance at training: average attendance rate at training 
over a season, expressed as a percentage.
iv. Availability for matches: average availability for matches 
over a season, expressed as a percentage.
Independent variable: coaches’ leadership styles
The Global Transformational Leadership (GTL) scale was 
used by medical staff to assess their coaches’ leadership styles. 
The GTL scale is a reliable and appropriate tool for assessing 
transformational leadership.30 Team doctors were asked seven 
questions relating to their perception of the transformational 
leadership behaviours of their club’s head coach. A 5-point 
Likert scale ranging from ‘rarely or never’ (1) to ‘very frequently, 
if not always’ (5) was used as a response format. Higher numbers 
denoted a more transformational leadership style. The seven 
scores were then combined to establish a mean score for each 
coach.
statistical analysis
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rho) was used to assess 
the relationship between GTL scores and the four outcome 
measures; that is, (1) injury burden, (2) incidence of severe inju-
ries, (3) attendance at training and (4) availability for matches. 
The scores for the seven GTL questions were combined to 
produce an overall score, and teams were placed in three groups 
depending on whether their coach was considered to display low 
(1–2), moderate (3) or high (4–5) levels of transformational lead-
ership. Differences between the low, moderate and high groups 
in terms of the four outcome measures were analysed using 
Kruskal-Wallis (KW) tests. If the results of the KW tests were 
statistically significant, comparisons of individual groups (low vs 
moderate, low vs high and moderate vs high) were carried out 
using Mann-Whitney tests.
In addition, effect sizes (r) were calculated using the results of 
the Mann-Whitney tests, whereby 0.1 was classified as a small 
effect, 0.3 was regarded as a medium-sized effect and 0.5 was 
classified as a large effect, as suggested by Cohen (1988).31 All 
analyses were two sided, and the significance level was set at 
p<0.05. Bonferroni correction was used for the comparison of 
individual groups, with the significance level set at p<0.0167. 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows V
.23.0 was used for all analysis.
resulTs
There was a negative correlation between the overall GTL 
score and the incidence of severe injuries (rho=−0.248; n=77; 
p=0.030), with high levels of transformational leadership being 
associated with smaller numbers of severe injuries. However, 
the coefficient of determination (r2=0.062) shows that the GTL 
score explained only 6% of total variation in the incidence of 
severe injuries. There was no significant correlation between the 
GTL score and the injury burden, attendance at training or avail-
ability for matches.
Correlation between individual behaviours and injury rates 
and players’ availability
Vision (coach communicates a clear and positive vision of the 
future)
As table 1 shows, there was significant variation in the incidence 
of severe injuries across the high, moderate and low groups for 
this aspect of leadership. The incidence of severe injuries was 
lower for the group that was rated high in terms of visionary 
leadership relative to the group that was rated low (p=0.005; 
r=0.37).
Staff development (coach treats staff as individuals, supporting and 
encouraging their development)
There was significant variation in the incidence of severe injuries 
and attendance at training across the high, moderate and low 
groups for this aspect of leadership (see table 2). The high group 
had a lower incidence of severe injuries and higher attendance

at training relative to the low group, with medium-sized effects 
for both variables (0.33 and 0.36, respectively). There was also a 
difference between the low group and the moderate group, with 
the low group having a significantly higher incidence of severe 
injuries (with a median value of 1.5 per 1000 
hours, compared 
with 1.0 for the moderate group; p=0.003; r=0.39), as well 
as lower attendance at training (with a median value of 81.1%, 
compared with 85.3% for the moderate group; p=0.011; 
r=0.33).
Supportive leadership (coach gives encouragement and recognition 
to staff)
There was significant variation in the incidence of severe inju-
ries and attendance at training across the high, moderate and 
low groups for this aspect of leadership (see table 3). The high 
group had a lower incidence of severe injuries and higher atten-
dance at training relative to the low group, with medium-sized 
effects for both variables (0.33 and 0.36, respectively). There 
was also a significant difference between the low group and the 
moderate group, with the low group having a higher incidence 
of severe injuries and lower attendance at training (with those 
effects totalling 0.31 and 0.28, respectively).
Empowerment (coach fosters trust, involvement and cooperation 
among team members)
There was significant variation in attendance at training across 
the three groups for this aspect of leadership (see table 4). The 
high group had a higher attendance rate than the low group 
(with a median value of 85.1%, compared with 81.5% for the 
low group; p=0.011; r=0.35), with a medium-sized effect.
Innovative or lateral thinking (coach encourages people to think 
about problems in new ways and question assumptions)
There was significant variation in attendance at training across 
the three groups for this aspect of leadership (see table 5). The 
high group had a higher attendance rate than the low group 
(with a median value of 85.3%, compared with 81.3% for the 
low group; p=0.011; r=0.32), with a medium-sized effect.
Leading by example (coach is clear about his values and practises 
what he preaches)
There was significant variation in attendance at training and 
availability for matches across the three groups for this aspect of 
leadership (see table 6). The low group had significantly lower 
attendance at training than the moderate group (with a median 
value of 81.4%, compared with 86.7% for the moderate group; 
p=0.006; r=0.36), as well as lower availability for matches 
(with a median value of 85.4%, compared with 90.7% for the 
moderate group; p=0.027; r=0.30).
Charismatic leadership (coach instils pride and respect in others and 
inspires players by being highly competent)
There were no significant differences between the various 
groups in terms of injury rates or players’ availability for this

aspect of leadership. There were 39 observations in the high 
group, 20 in the moderate group and 18 in the low group.
dIsCussIOn
Our study’s main finding was that clubs where coaches used a 
transformational or democratic leadership style had a lower inci-
dence of severe injuries. However, this correlation was weak, 
with GTL scores explaining just 6% of total variation in the inci-
dence of severe injuries.
Articulating a positive vision of the future reduces the risk of 
severe injuries
We found that leadership behaviours that communicated a clear 
and positive vision of the future appeared to reduce the risk of 
severe injuries. This is in line with the idea that transformational 
leaders develop an image of the future of their organisation and 
communicate that vision to their subordinates.30 Identifying new 
opportunities for the team and providing guidance regarding the 
future could increase players’ expectations and intrinsic motiva-
tion and result in extra effort.32
staff development is important in order to avoid severe 
injuries and increase attendance at training
In our study, a leadership style that treated staff as individuals 
and supported and encouraged their development was asso-
ciated with a 4% increase in attendance rates at training and 
a 33% decline in the incidence of severe injuries (comparing 
low levels of transformational leadership with moderate or 
high levels).
supportive leadership has a positive impact
A supportive leadership style, whereby the coach gives 
encouragement and recognition to staff, appears to reduce the 
incidence of severe injuries and increase attendance rates at 
training sessions. In our study, a leadership style involving low 
levels of support was associated with a 23% increase in the 
incidence of severe injuries and a 4% decline in attendance 
at training relative to a leadership style involving moderate 
levels of support.
This finding is in line with research indicating that supportive 
behaviour by coaches is associated with collective efficacy.6 
Supportive leadership is not just important for individual 
players; it is important for the team as a whole.30
Fostering trust and cooperation increases attendance rates at 
training
We found that coaches who trust their staff and support coop-
eration between staff members are more likely to have higher 
attendance rates at training.
Innovative thinking could increase attendance at training
A leadership style that encourages people to think about prob-
lems in new ways and question assumptions seems to increase 
attendance at training. Coaches with this leadership style 
encourage players to challenge inflexible thinking and patterns 
of behaviour in search of improvement and excellence.32 They 
are also willing to take risks to achieve their goals and accept that 
mistakes can be an opportunity to learn.30
leading by example appears to increase availability
In this study, low levels of clarity about a coach’s values were 
associated with a 5% decline in players’ availability for training 
and matches relative to moderate levels of clarity. This highlights 
the coach’s function as a role model that players can use as a 
source of guidance.32
Charisma has no impact on injury rates or players’ availability
It has been suggested in the past that charismatic leadership 
should be a good predictor of a leader’s effectiveness and the 
performance of a business unit.30 In our study, there was no 
correlation between charismatic leadership and injury rates or 
players’ availability. In a recent study in the sport of handball, 
charismatic leadership had a negative effect on teams’ perfor-
mance.32 Overall, our findings suggest that, to reduce the inci-
dence of severe injuries and increase attendance at training, 
coaches should establish an interpersonal environment charac-
terised by support, respect, trust and appreciation of staff and 
players.6
Theoretical framework: what might underpin these 
associations?
This is a prospective epidemiological study revealing significant 
associations; we cannot comment on causality. We can, however, 
speculate as to whether a coach’s democratic leadership style 
reduces stress on players and staff.26
Psychosocial stressors could increase the risk 
of injury.23 25 26 33–35 
The mechanism underlying a stress-induced injury is thought 
to be a physiological arousal that increases muscle tension and 
reduces motor coordination.26 The relationship between stress 
and injury could stem from a decline in concentration, resulting 
in a reduced ability to focus.36 A performance-oriented climate 
is linked to increases in injury risk, as this kind of environment 
could promote intrateam rivalry, forcing players to risk injury.35 
Thus, a coach’s leadership style may impact players’ stress levels 
and injury risk as a result of the demands placed on players, 
the availability of resources in order to handle demands or the 
general atmosphere within the team. Transformational lead-
ership, which specifically uses visionary, motivational and 
supportive leadership behaviours to unite the team,8 appears 
highly relevant when investigating the impact of psychosocial 
factors on injuries. Coaches may inadvertently expose players to 
injury risk because their leadership fails to produce an optimally 
functioning team.
In a recent study of psychological factors and overuse injuries 
in track and field athletes, Timpka et al37 concluded that a cause 
of overuse injuries was not the athletic load itself, but rather the 
load applied in situations when the athlete’s body was in need of

rest. Since coaches are responsible for footballers’ load and the 
balance between load and rest, it would be worth carrying out a 
similar study looking at football.
strengths and limitations
The strength of this study lies in its substantial dataset, which 
was obtained from a homogeneous group of male professional 
footballers. The Elite Club Injury Study is an appropriate, reli-
able and useful tool for evaluating injury risk and injury patterns 
in elite male footballers.28 We list several limitations. First of all, 
this study explored the opinions of medical staff regarding their 
head coach’s leadership. Their opinions are subjective and not 
necessarily representative of the views of other team members. 
That being said, doctors at this level work with their teams on 
a full-time basis and see the coaches and players every day. As 
a result of their medical training, they are, in our opinion, in 
the best position to observe and evaluate how different coaches 
act and cooperate in terms of their leadership styles. It could 
be argued that elite players are less able to provide an objec-
tive evaluation of coaches’ behaviour, since they often look at 
their situation in the group and their relationship with the coach 
in a subjective manner. Moreover, they usually stay at clubs for 
shorter periods of time, so team doctors are in a better position 
to provide evaluations over time.
Second, the opinions of those medical staff could be influenced 
by their relationships with the head coach or by the team’s results 
during the season. It would be interesting to look at whether 
prolonged exposure to the unique environment found in a football 
club makes certain behaviours more acceptable to individuals that 
work within it. A club’s culture could potentially affect its doctors’ 
perception and interpretation of the various transformational lead-
ership categories or their ability or willingness to report objectively 
on the head coach’s leadership.
Third, the evaluation was carried out after the end of each 
season. There is potential for bias in the fact that doctors at clubs 
with high injury rates could, as a result of those injuries, take the 
view that their coach has a poor leadership style.
Fourth, although the collection of data on injuries and players’ 
availability was prospective, the data on leadership styles were 
only collected once, so our study captures one snapshot in time. 
Cross-sectional studies do not capture dynamic aspects, as rela-
tionships and behaviour can change over the course of a season, 
and the relationships that are found may not necessarily be caus-
ative.6 Also, leadership styles could change in line with results and 
perceived pressure on the head coach, and this kind of change has 
the potential to undermine players’ trust and confidence.
Fifth, this study only covered elite men’s football, so the findings 
should not be applied to other areas of football, such as amateur, 
youth and women’s football (or, indeed, other sports). A further 
limitation stems from the fact that this study only investigated 
transformational leadership. The correlation between injuries and 
other leadership styles (such as transactional leadership or lais-
sez-faire leadership) has not yet been evaluated. Although transfor-
mational or democratic leadership has been a beneficial option in 
many types of organisation,8 transactional or authoritarian leader-
ship could be more appropriate in certain settings cases. Our work 
opens the discussion on this domain of sports injury analysis and 
determinants of performance.

What are the findings?
 
► There is a correlation between a head coach’s leadership  
style and the incidence of severe injuries and players’ 
availability.
 
► Teams whose coaches who tend to employ a transformational 
or democratic leadership style have a lower incidence of 
severe injuries in their teams. The correlation between the 
two explains 6% of total variation in the incidence of severe 
injuries.
 
► The incidence of severe injuries was 29%–40% lower in 
teams where coaches communicated a clear and positive 
vision of the future, supported staff members and gave staff 
encouragement and recognition.
 
► Attendance at training was higher in teams where coaches 
gave encouragement and recognised staff members, 
encouraged innovative thinking, fostered trust and 
cooperation among team members and acted as  
role models.
