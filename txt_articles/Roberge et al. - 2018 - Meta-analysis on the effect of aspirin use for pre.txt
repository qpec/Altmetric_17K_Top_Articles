ABSTRACT 
 
Background: Impaired placentation in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy is 
associated with increased risk of subsequent development of preeclampsia, birth 
of small for gestational age neonates and placental abruption. Previous studies 
reported that prophylactic use of aspirin reduces the risk of preeclampsia and 
small for gestational age neonates with no significant effect on placental 
abruption. However, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining the 
effect of aspirin in relation to gestational age at onset of therapy and dose of the 
drug reported that significant reduction in the risk of preeclampsia and small for 
gestational age neonates is achieved only if the onset of treatment is at ≤16 
weeks of gestation and the daily dose of the drug is ≥100 mg.  
 
Objective: To estimate the effect of aspirin on the risk of placental abruption or 
antepartum hemorrhage, in relation to gestational age at onset of therapy and the 
dose of the drug.  
 
Study design: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials that evaluated the prophylactic effect of aspirin 
during pregnancy using PubMed, Cinhal, Embase, Web of Science and 
Cochrane library from 1985 to September 2017. Relative risks (RR) of placental 
abruption or antepartum hemorrhage with their 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CI) were calculated using random effect models. Analyses were stratified

according to daily dose of aspirin (<100 and ≥100 mg) and the gestational age at 
the onset of therapy (≤16 and >16 weeks) and compared using subgroup 
difference analysis.   
 
Results: The entry criteria were fulfilled by 20 studies on a combined total of 
12,585 participants. Aspirin at a dose of <100 mg per day had no impact on the 
risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage, irrespective of whether it 
was initiated at ≤16 weeks’ gestation (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.36) or at >16 
weeks (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.39).  At ≥100 mg per day, aspirin was not 
associated with a significant change on the risk of placental abruption or 
antepartum hemorrhage, whether the treatment was initiated at ≤16 weeks of 
gestation (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.26), or at >16 weeks (RR 2.08 95% CI 0.86 
to 5.06), but the difference between the subgroups was significant (p=0.04). 
 
Conclusion: Aspirin at a daily dose of ≥100 mg for prevention of preeclampsia, 
initiated at ≤16 weeks of gestation rather than >16 weeks may decrease the risk 
of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage.

Introduction 
 
Impaired placentation in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy is associated with 
increased risk of subsequent development of preeclampsia, birth of small for 
gestational age neonates and placental abruption.1-6 Numerous randomized 
controled trials have investigated the potential value of prophylactic use of low-
dose aspirin in prevention of preeclampsia and an early meta-analysis reported 
that the risk of preeclampsia and small for gestational age is reduced by about 
10%.7 A recent individual patient meta-analysis by the same group reported that 
this modest reduction in risk was unrelated to the gestational age at onset of 
therapy (<16 vs. ≥16 weeks) or daily dose of aspirin (≤75 vs. >75 mg).8 In 
contrast, other meta-analyses reported that use of aspirin has a major effect on 
both preeclampsia and small for gestational age with a greater than 50% 
reduction in risk, provided the onset of therapy is ≤16 weeks of gestation and the 
daily dose of the drug is ≥100 mg; onset of therapy at >16 weeks or daily dose of 
<100 mg has no significant effect.9-11 These results were confirmed by the 
findings of a recent large multicentre randomized trial (ASPRE) which 
demonstrated that aspirin (150 mg per day) from 11-14 weeks of gestation to 36 
weeks was associated with a greater than 60% reduction in risk of preterm 
preeclampsia.12 
  
Placental abruption is a major cause of perinatal mortality and maternal 
morbidity.13,14 An early randomized trial on the use of aspirin (60 mg per day) for

the prevention of preeclampsia reported that aspirin use was associated with a 
significant increase in risk of placental abruption, which was attributed to the 
antiplatelet effect of the drug.15 Subsequent meta-analyses have reported that 
aspirin use for prevention of preeclampsia was not associated with increased risk 
of placental abruption; however, in these meta-analyses the effect of aspirin was 
not examined in relation to gestational age at onset of therapy or the daily dose 
of the drug.7,16  
 
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the effect 
of aspirin on the risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage, in relation 
to gestational age at onset of therapy and the dose of the drug.  
 
Method 
 
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
including studies that recruited women for the prevention of preeclampsia using 
aspirin. Treatment includes aspirin or dipyridamole compared to placebo or no 
treatment. Studies will be excluded if pregnant women started treatment before 
pregnancy or had preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction at randomization.

Keywords and MeSH terms related with aspirin for preeclampsia were searched 
using Embase, PubMed, Cinahl, Web of science, Cochrane CENTRAL library 
from 1985 to September 2017. No language restrictions were applied. 
 
Selection of the articles 
 
Titles were selected for first screening and abstracts were then revised by two 
independent reviewers (SR, EB). All eligible studies were then fully evaluated by 
the same reviewers, and disagreements were resolved by the opinion of a third 
party (KN). Studies reporting placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage were 
included in the final analysis.  
 
Quality evaluation 
 
The quality of this meta-analysis was assessed by PRISMA tool and the quality 
of each included trial was assessed by the Cochrane Handbook.17,18  
 
Analysis 
 
Subgroup analyses were performed in regards to the dose of aspirin (<100 and 
≥100 mg) and the gestational age at onset of treatment (≤16 and >16 weeks) and 
compared using mixed regression weighted by the size of each study.10,19

random effects will be performed.20 The cut-offs of 16 weeks of gestation and 
100 mg of the drug were selected because previous meta-analysis reported that 
aspirin is effective in prevention of preeclampsia only if the onset of therapy is 
≤16 weeks of gestation and the daily dose of the drug is ≥100 mg.9-11 Results 
was reported by relative risks (RR), calculated with their 95% confidence 
intervals (CI), using random effects (DerSimmonian and Laird).20 Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of aspirin alone.   
 
Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Higgins I2 was calculated for 
heterogeneity and was considered to be high if the score was ≥ 50%.21,22 
Analyses were carried out with Review Manager 5.3 software (Nordic Cochrane 
Center, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). 
 
Results 
 
The literature search identified 7,143 citations, 161 were reviewed and 20 trials 
on a combined total of 12,585 participants met the inclusion criteria (Table 1, 
Figure 1).12,15,23-41In 2 of the included trials, the data on onset of therapy (≤16 and 
>16 weeks of gestation) were not included in the original publications but they 
were kindly provided by the authors.15,27 In 15 of the 20 studies the reported 
outcome was placental abruption12,15,23,25-28,32,34,35,37-41 and in 5 antepartum 
hemorrhage.24,29-31,36

All but one of the included studies were considered to be of good or unclear 
quality; one study was considered at high risk of bias40 because in 20% of cases 
there was loss to follow-up (Figure 2). The heterogeneity between the studies 
was low (I2=0%-29%). Although the distribution of studies in the funnel plots 
appears to be good, the small number of studies cannot exclude the possibility of 
publication bias (Figure 3).   
 
In the case of aspirin at a daily dose of <100 mg (Table 2, Figure 4), there was 
no significant effect on risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage 
irrespective of the gestational age at onset of treatment and there was no 
significant difference between the subgroup with onset at ≤16 weeks and those 
with onset at >16 weeks (p=0.72). 
 
In the case of aspirin at a daily dose of ≥100 mg (Table 2, Figure 5), onset of 
therapy at ≤16 weeks’ gestation was associated with a non-significant reduction 
in the risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage (RR 0.62, 95% CI 
0.31 to 1.26), whereas onset at >16 weeks was associated with a non-significant 
increase in the risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage (RR 2.08 
95% CI 0.86 to 5.06) and the subgroup difference was significant (p=0.04). After 
excluding the study in which dipyridamole was used,25 the same trends were 
observed (aspirin ≥100 mg per day; ≤16 weeks: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.47; vs 
aspirin ≥100 mg per day; >16 weeks: RR 2.08 95% CI 0.86 to 5.06), but the 
difference between subgroups was not significant (p=0.07).

Discussion 
 
Principal findings of this study 
 
The findings of this study suggest that aspirin at <100 mg per day does not 
influence the risk of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage irrespective of 
the gestational age at onset of therapy. However, in the case of aspirin at ≥100 
mg per day we observed a significant difference in the risk of placental abruption 
or antepartum hemorrhage between women starting the treatment at ≤16 weeks 
of gestation and those starting at >16 weeks, with a non-significant tendency of 
benefit for the former and harm for the latter. 
 
Limitations of the study 
 
Data for placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage in relation to dosage and 
timing of aspirin were reported in only 20 of the 65 trials examining the effect of 
aspirin on prevention of preeclampsia; consequently, in our meta-analysis there 
is a potential risk of selection bias. Results are also limited by the low prevalence 
of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage, which was reported in only 173 
(1.5%) of the 11,585 participants in the included trials.

Placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage was a secondary outcome in all 
the included trials and although aspirin did not have a significant effect on the risk 
of placental abruption or antepartum hemorrhage, none of the trials was 
adequately powered for such outcome. Our approach for further subdivision of 
the study population according to dose and timing of onset of therapy could have 
resulted in even greater reduction of power to demonstrate significant effects. 
However, in the context of aspirin use for prevention of preeclampsia, our 
previous subgroup analyses had demonstrated the importance of subdividing the 
population according to both the dose and timing of onset of therapy.10,11  
 
In the ASPRE trial the beneficial effect of aspirin in the prevention of preterm 
preeclampsia appeared to depend on compliance.42 In our meta-analysis, it was 
not possible to evaluate the effect of compliance on the risk of placental 
abruption or antepartum hemorrhage, because in eight of the 20 trials 
compliance was not reported and 10 of the remaining 12 trials did not report 
results separately according to compliance. 
 
Clinical implications of the study 
 
National guidelines recommend that women, identified by their demographic 
characteristics and medical history as being at high-risk for development of 
preeclampsia, should be advised to take aspirin at a daily dose that varies 
between 75 and 80 mg depending on the country.16,43,44 However, on the basis of 
 MANUSCRIPT

12
the results of our meta-analyses, that aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of 
preeclampsia only if the daily dose is ≥100 mg, and the results of the ASPRE 
trial,9,10,12 it is likely that the recommended daily dose of aspirin will become 150 
mg. It would then be important to emphasise that while such therapy is beneficial 
if treatment is initiated before 16 weeks, it may increase the risk of abruption or 
antepartum hemorrhage without reducing the risk of preeclampsia if treatment is 
initiated after 16 weeks.  
 
Placental abruption has been considered, together with preeclampsia, to be the 
consequence of impaired placentation.45,46 In this respect, aspirin administration 
in women at increased risk of impaired placentation may actually lead to a 
reduction in the risk of abruption, as it does for preeclampsia, provided the dose 
is ≥100 mg and the gestational age at onset of the treatment is ≤16 weeks. 
Placentation is mostly completed by 18 weeks of gestation;19 if the mechanism 
whereby aspirin reduces the risk of preeclampsia is mediated by improving 
placentation, it should not be surprising that aspirin initiated after 16 weeks is not 
beneficial. In cases of persistent abnormal placentation, use of aspirin at ≥100 
mg per day could through its antiplatelet proprieties increase the risk of 
hemorrhage and abruption. It is therefore doubtful that universal use of aspirin is 
beneficial and it may actually be harmful.47

This study demonstrated that the prophylactic use of aspirin at a daily dose of 
≥100 mg may have different effects on the risk of placental abruption or 
antepartum hemorrhage depending on the gestational age at onset of treatment; 
if the onset of treatment is at ≤16 weeks, rather than >16 weeks, the risk is 
decreased.
