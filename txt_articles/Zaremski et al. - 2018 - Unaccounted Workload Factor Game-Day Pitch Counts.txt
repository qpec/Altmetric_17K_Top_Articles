Investigation performed at University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA
Background: Throwing injuries are common in high school baseball. Known risk factors include excessive pitch counts, year-
round pitching, and pitching with arm pain and fatigue. Despite the evidence, the prevalence of pitching injuries among high school
players has not decreased. One possibility to explain this pattern is that players accumulate unaccounted pitch volume during
warm-up and bullpen activity, but this has not yet been examined.
Hypotheses: Our primary hypothesis was that approximately 30% to 40% of pitches thrown off a mound by high school pitchers
during a game-day outing are unaccounted for in current data but will be revealed when bullpen sessions and warm-up pitches are
included. Our secondary hypothesis was that there is wide variability among players in the number of bullpen pitches thrown per
outing.
Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods: Researchers counted all pitches thrown off a mound during varsity high school baseball games played by 34 high
schools in North Central Florida during the 2017 season.
Results: We recorded 13,769 total pitches during 115 varsity high school baseball starting pitcher outings. The mean ± SD pitch
numbers per game were calculated for bullpen activity (27.2 ± 9.4), warm-up (23.6 ±8.0), live games (68.9 ±19.7), and total pitches
per game (119.7 ± 27.8). Thus, 42.4% of the pitches performed were not accounted for in the pitch count monitoring of these
players. The number of bullpen pitches thrown varied widely among players, with 25% of participants in our data set throwing fewer
than 22 pitches and 25% throwing more than 33 pitches per outing.
Conclusion: In high school baseball players, pitch count monitoring does not account for the substantial volume of pitching that
occurs during warm-up and bullpen activity during the playing season. These extra pitches should be closely monitored to help
mitigate the risk of overuse injury.

Baseball pitchers commonly experience injuries to the dom-
inant upper extremity, particularly the shoulder and elbow.
Recent data have indicated that shoulder injury rate is 1.39
per 10,000 athlete-exposures (AEs) and the overall elbow
injury rate is 0.86 per 10,000 AEs in high school baseball
players.46 The majority of shoulder (39.6%) and elbow
(56.9%) injuries were sustained by pitchers (between
40% and 57%), and most injuries were chronic and caused
by overuse.46 Moreover, injuries to the ulnar collateral
ligament of the elbow (UCL) associated with overhead
throwing continue to increase. The number of UCL surgical
reconstructions (Tommy John surgery) has increased
throughout all levels of play for the past 20 years, most nota-
bly at the youth and high school levels, where a more than
6-fold increase occurred from 1994 through 2011.2,11,17,44
Risk factors for overuse throwing injuries include lack of
adherence to recommended pitch counts, year-round pitch-
ing, rotator cuff weakness, kinetic chain deficits, scapular
dyskinesis, altered shoulder rotation, and pitching with
arm pain and fatigue.7,26,27,29,40,44 As a result, emphasis
on pitching safeguards has increased, particularly at the
youth and high school levels. Initially, Little League Base-
ball and the USA Baseball Medical Advisory Committee
developed pitch count restriction recommendations based
on age.1 More recently, Major League Baseball (MLB), with
expert recommendations from physical therapists, sports

 medicine practitioners, and athletic trainers, developed
Pitch Smart, a website that provides information to
players, coaches, parents, and health care practitioners
on prevention of overuse injuries in young pitchers.32
Among the website’s many features are game pitch count
as well as rest day recommendations for 8- to 22-year-olds.
Recently, media coverage reporting cases of baseball
pitchers throwing an inordinate number of pitches has
increased.42 During the Koshien Baseball Tournament, one
of the most popular sporting events in Japan showcasing
high school baseball teams, 42 of 201 (20.9%) pitchers threw
more than 120 pitches per game.52 There was also a report
that one pitcher threw 187 pitches in a single outing.52 This
media coverage, coupled with efforts by sports medicine
providers, coaches, and parents, prompted a shift of pitch
volume recommendations at the high school level. In the
United States, as recently as 2012, only 2 states had pitch
count restrictions (South Dakota and Vermont), with the
remainder of interscholastic state associations using inning
restriction recommendations only.19,45 As of the 2016-2017
academic year, the National Federation of State High
School Associations began requiring a pitch restriction pol-
icy based on the number of pitches thrown in a game rather
than the number of innings.23 On August 30, 2016, the
Florida High School Athletic Association approved a recom-
mendation to follow the MLB Pitch Smart guidelines.13,14
Furthermore, in 2017, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association stated it would explore the issue of pitch counts
at the collegiate level because of the concern over overuse
throwing injuries.24
The upper limit of pitch counts recommended for the old-
est high school athletes (17- to 18-year-olds) by MLB Pitch
Smart is 105 pitches per game.32 However, the recom-
mended guidelines for pitch count restrictions do not take
into consideration the number of pitches thrown in the bull-
pen or during warm-up. Players may be considered in the
“safe” zone of pitches thrown in a game based on the recom-
mended guidelines when, in reality, the unaccounted work-
load and number of pitches accrued during bullpen and
warm-up activities would push the overall pitching work-
load considerably higher. In addition, there is potential for
variability in the volume of pitches thrown in a bullpen
session prior to live-game competition, affecting the work-
load of a pitcher. Therefore, quantification of the pitches
accumulated during warm-up, bullpen, and live-game
activities would provide a more accurate assessment of the
workload volume per pitcher outing and could have poten-
tial effects for off-season and in-season monitoring and
training.
Our primary aim in this study was to quantify the total
number of pitches accumulated during a typical high school
varsity game experience, including bullpen, between-
innings warm-up, and game pitches. Our secondary aim
was to assess bullpen session volume variability. We
hypothesized that approximately 30% to 40% of pitches
thrown off a mound by high school pitchers during a
game-day outing are unaccounted for in current data but
will be revealed when bullpen sessions and warm-up
pitches are included. We based this percentage on prior
literature regarding the average number of game pitches
thrown at the high school level (approximately 70)29 in com-
bination with a likely number of bullpen pitches (20-30) and
warm-up pitches thrown. A typical number of pitches
thrown per inning is approximately 15 to 20 based on MLB
data.12 We anticipated that the pitchers would pitch an
average of 4 to 5 innings per start, which would amount
to approximately 20 to 30 warm-up pitches (8 pitches before
the first inning and 5 pitches before each subsequent
inning).34 Our secondary hypothesis was that the number
of bullpen pitches thrown per outing would demonstrate
wide variability among players. This is the first published
study to measure total pitch volume (bullpen, between-
inning warm-up, and game pitches).
METHODS
Design
This was an observational, prospective study of pitch
counts performed among high school baseball pitchers in
the counties of North Central Florida. Because this study
did not require collection of personal health information,
the institutional review board (IRB) granted expedited
review and did not require informed consent. The IRB
approved all procedures involved in this study.
Selection of High School Locations
This study included 34 high schools. These schools were
selected to represent a variety of different size classifica-
tions, demographics, and rankings. Schools included enroll-
ment sizes ranging from less than 300 to more than 2200
students located in North Central Florida, the Panhandle of
Florida, and Central Florida. The intent was to create a
study sample representative of the general high school
baseball population.
Data Collection
Researchers who collected the pitch counts received stan-
dardized directions on counting and documentation from

 the principal investigator (J.L.Z.). All researchers were
unaffiliated with any high school team. Researchers
attended varsity high school baseball games at the chosen
schools from February to May 2017. Each starting pitcher’s
total number of pitches thrown off a mound from the rubber
was counted. As this was an observational study only, we
did not collect data about injuries. Pitches from a mound
were counted in 3 different situations: while in the bullpen
(prior to game play), while warming up before each inning
on the field, and during the game (live-game pitches). Only
pitches while on a mound were counted. The reason for this
was to count all pitches performed in a similar manner. Any
throws that were made prior to warming up in the bullpen
and long tossing in the outfield were not counted. Total
innings pitched per outing were also collected to quantify
number of pitches per inning.
Definitions
We used the following definitions for purposes of the study.
Bullpen pitches: Throwing off the pitching mound in the
bullpen before the game
Warm-up pitches: Throwing off the pitching mound on
the playing field before each inning pitched during the
game
Live-game pitches: Throwing off the pitching mound
during the game
Total game-day pitches: Bullpen, warm-up, and live-
game pitches
Recommended Pitch Count Comparison
The upper limit of recommended pitch counts for the oldest
high school athletes (17- to 18-year-olds) was used for compar-
ison from the MLB Pitch Smart recommendations. Thus, we
used 105 pitches as our upper limit cutoff for “safe volume.”33
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were generated (ie, means and stan-
dard deviations; percentage of totals) for live-game pitches,
bullpen pitches, warm-up pitches, and total number of
pitches. We compared pitches in all subgroups by time of
the season by breaking the season into thirds, given that a
typical high school baseball season is approximately 12
weeks. An analysis of variance was run to compare differ-
ences in pitches thrown between pitch subgroups and time
of the season. Pearson correlation was run to assess the
association between total live-game pitches and bullpen
pitches as well as between total game-day pitches and bull-
pen pitches. Data were analyzed by use of the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v 24; IBM Corp).
RESULTS
We recorded 13,769 total pitches during 115 varsity high
school baseball starting pitcher outings. Table 1 provides
details of the volume of pitches and total innings pitched. All
of the live-game pitches met the recommended pitch counts
for 17- to 18-year-olds, as no pitcher exceeded 105 live-game
pitches. Additional bullpen and warm-up pitches increased
the total number ofpitchesforthe averageplayer to 119.7per
game. Figure 1 summarizes the distribution of pitch volume
during live-game, bullpen, and warm-up activities. The aver-
age number of total pitches thrown during a pitcher outing
was 42.4% greater than documented during the game alone.
Moreover, 70.4% of the pitcher outings (81/115 outings)
resulted in more than 105 game-day pitches thrown.
Tables 2 and 3 provide pitch number comparisons to
the recommended 105. The total number of pitches thrown
in a game was significantly greater than recommended

 (P < .0001). When excluding bullpen pitches, we found that
the total number of warm-up and live-game pitches
thrown was significantly less than the recommended
105 per game (P < .0001) (Table 3). Our data also
revealed variability between the number of bullpen
pitches per outing (11-pitch range). Out of 115 game-
day outings, 58 (50.4%) recorded bullpen pitch totals
of either less than 22 pitches (30/115 outings; 26.0%)
or more than 33 pitches (28/115 outings; 24.3%). Our
data indicated that bullpen volume adds an additional
8.7 pitches, on average, per inning thrown. Although no
significant correlation was found between warm-up and
live-game pitches versus bullpen pitches (r ¼ 0.002, P ¼
.98), a positive and statistically significant relationship was
found between total game-day pitches versus bullpen
pitches (r ¼ 0.34, P < .0001).
Withrespecttoseasonalpatternsofpitchvolume(Table4),
we did not find significant differences by time in season
for game pitches per inning or total pitches per inning.
DISCUSSION
We assessed the total throwing volume and the variability
in bullpen throwing volume of starting pitchers during a
typical varsity high school baseball game. Our data
revealed that the average number of total pitches thrown
during a pitcher outing was 42.4% greater than live-game
pitches and 28.3% greater than bullpen and live-game
pitches combined. Variability in bullpen throwing volume
existed as well. These findings support our hypotheses.
Potential predictors of pitching injury, such as pitch
counts and innings pitched, have been previously
reported.40,43 Comparative data on total pitch volume at
the high school baseball level are very limited. Two docu-
mented studies have assessed pitch counts at the collegiate
baseball level; however, they did not include the bullpen or
warm-up pitches.25,49 A study by Karakolis et al21 assessed
future injury risk in all pitchers under 25 years of age who
pitched at least one-third of an inning at the MLB level over
6 seasons. The authors reported no correlation between
innings pitched, inning restrictions, and future injury.
Hence, inning limits alone cannot be used to protect young
professional pitchers from injury.21 A prior study by Kara-
kolis et al20 examined the association of cumulative work-
load metrics and injury in MLB pitchers. Metrics included
games pitched, total innings pitched, total pitches thrown,
innings pitched per game, and pitches thrown per game. No
cumulative workload metric was a significant predictor for
future injury.20 However, interpretation of this finding
could be limited due to lack of detailed documentation of
bullpen and warm-up pitches.3
In addition to wide variability in the number of bullpen
pitches thrown, a positive and significant relationship was
found between total game-day pitches (n ¼ 13,769) and
bullpen pitches (n ¼ 3132) (P < .0001). Hence, more bullpen
pitches thrown correlates with total number of game-day
pitches thrown. Accounting for bullpen pitches in the game-
day pitch count would provide a more accurate quantifica-
tion of throwing volume.
Our study suggests there is a misunderstanding of the
workload volume in the high school–aged baseball pitcher.
Research has suggested that the occurrence of workload
spikes (sudden increased volume relative to regular train-
ing volume) significantly increases risk for throwing-
related injury.18,31 For example, cricket bowlers who
increase throwing workloads acutely during competition
compared with their chronic workloads are at increased
risk of injury.10,18,31,41,47 One study reported that injured
elite cricketers made only 12 more throws per day than
noninjured athletes, although intensity and work of throws
were not measured.47 When the number of balls bowled in a
session increased acutely, by more than 50% compared with
the chronic workload, the likelihood of injury more than
doubled.18 In baseball, the variability in bullpen pitches
as well as the unaccounted volume of bullpen and warm-
up pitches means that pitchers may be incurring an addi-
tional 30% to 40% of an acute workload that could increase
the likelihood of injury in a high school baseball pitcher.
Our data set can guide future pitching recommendations
by providing insight on previously unaccounted for throw-
ing volume.
Significance of Study
Our data set reveals uncounted pitches that may contribute
to overuse in high school varsity pitchers. Overuse can result
in defects to the kinetic chain,8,39 changes in hip strength
and glenohumeral range of motion,38 alteration in throwing

 mechanics,16,39,43 rotator cuff weakness and fatigue,15,29
forearm fatigue,51 and alterations of scapula, arm position,
and proprioception with resultant changes in arm and elbow
position.50 McHugh and colleagues29 examined the effect of
pitch volume on in-season and year-to-year range of motion
and strength adaptations in high school baseball pitchers.
Interestingly, supraspinatus strength decreased 13% in
high-volume pitchers, where high volume was defined as
more than 400 pitches per season. McHugh et al29 reported
an average of 71 pitches per game, very similar to our find-
ing of 68.9 pitches per game. At the collegiate level, a study
assessed throwing-related fatigue in the shoulder external
and internal rotator muscle groups in baseball pitchers after
a throwing protocol of 60 maximal-effort pitches arranged
into 4 innings of 15 pitches per inning with 5 warm-up
pitches per inning. Isokinetic testing revealed that
throwing-related fatigue affected the shoulder external and
internal rotators, which can have implications for rehabili-
tation and conditioning programs.9 However, the volume of
bullpen pitches was not taken into account, a difference of
approximately 28% based on our data set.
These studies suggest that fatigue is a factor in the break-
down of the kinetic chain, which is a known risk factor for
injury.7 The concept of kinetic chain breakdown and fatigue
in an overhead thrower is applicable to all overhead throw-
ing athletes, not just baseball players. Nun
˜o et al36 assessed
throwing accuracy and throwing velocity in elite handball
players as fatigue increased. Their findings suggest that
knowing when fatigue thresholds are reached can provide
coaches and the health care team with the means to design
appropriate off-season and in-season training regimens.36
Limitations
This is an observational study, and we made no attempt to
correlate total pitches with onset of injury. With respect to
the bullpen and warm-up pitches, it is difficult to account
for throwing effort, velocity, and intensity, which could
affect rate of muscular fatigue and stress on the shoulder
and elbow. These factors, in addition to workload, should
be included in overuse injury assessment.30 One might
assume that warm-ups are likely pitched at a submaximal
level, with less stress on the pitching arm; although prior
studies have shown that velocity is a major component of
increased pitching injury,6 other data have suggested that
overuse and fatigue were the factors that had the greatest
associations with chronic pitching injury.40 Coaches and
athletes must be mindful that chronic throwing injuries are
not necessarily the result of submaximal throws in one
game. Rather, it is the cumulative, voluminous build-up over
time (eg, in a week, season, year, and career) that can lead
to an overuse injury. Grantham and colleagues16 recom-
mended that “limiting fatigue-related injury risk may
assist injury prevention in addition to standardized limita-
tions of innings and pitches thrown.” However, the exact
number of pitches thrown on a game-day is required to
determine when fatigue levels are reached in order to pre-
vent chronic injury in baseball pitchers.39
We also did not assess whether different types of pitches
contributed to fatigue. However, previous research at the
youth level has indicated that pitching mechanics and mus-
cle activation did not change with various types of pitches
thrown.37
Our data did not account for non-game-day throwing or
warming up by playing catch before pitching off a mound,
which may add significant exposure load and potentially
affect injury risk. Finally, although bullpen volume varies
significantly, it would not be appropriate to regulate how a
pitcher warms up, as each pitcher has developed his or her
own warm-up routine to feel comfortable before entering
live-game competition. However, bullpen volume may be
modifiable through education of players and coaches
regarding safer types of warm-up sessions to prepare for
game competition.
CONCLUSION
Our data revealed an unaccounted workload factor of bull-
pen and warm-up pitches not included in the total pitch
count. We also found wide variation in the number of bull-
pen pitches thrown, making precise determination of pitch
volume challenging among high school players. Recommen-
dations to limit live-game baseball pitch counts at the high
school level have recently been enacted to reduce overuse
throwing injuries, as described in Table 5.23 This study
reinforces the importance of developing consistent systems
to monitor workloads.48
