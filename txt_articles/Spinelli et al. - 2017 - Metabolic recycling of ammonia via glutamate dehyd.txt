Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological
consequences of ammonia production are not fully understood, especially in cancer.
We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central
amino acid metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast
cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive amination catalyzed by
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other amino acids, such as
proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia
accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor
microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity.
These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental
nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.
I
ncreased nutrient consumption can supply
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur to ac-
commodate the extensive bioenergetic, bio-
synthetic, and prosurvival requirements of
rapidly proliferating cells (1–3). As a conse-
quence, such cells generate an excess of metabolic
waste products, which are cleared in mammals
through the excretory system. However, in the tu-
mor microenvironment, metabolic waste products
such as lactate and ammonia accumulate (4, 5).
Although lactate is well studied in cancer, little is
known about the mechanisms by which cancer
cells manage increased amounts of ammonia
(NH3) generated by glutamine and asparagine
catabolism, de novo cysteine synthesis through the
transsulfuration pathway, and salvage nucleotide
metabolism (6). Ammonia has been considered a
toxic by-product that must be exported from cells
and is subsequently cleared through urea cycle
activity in the liver (7–9).
Glutamine has been called a “nitrogen reser-
voir” for cancer cells because of its anabolic role in
nucleotide synthesis (6, 10). However, the role of
glutamine as a nitrogen reservoir is contradicted
in catabolic glutamine metabolism, because nitro-
gen is liberated as the by-product ammonia (11).
The fate of ammonia in the metabolism of pro-
liferating cells and tumors remains unclear. We
hypothesized that ammonia might be reassimi-
lated into central metabolism to maximize the
efficiency of nitrogen utilization. In this study, we
sought to clarify the role of ammonia as either a
toxic waste product or a biosynthetic metabolite
(Fig. 1A).
Mammals have three enzymes that can over-
come the thermodynamic hurdles of ammonia
assimilation: (i) carbamoyl phosphate synthe-
tase I (CPS1), the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–
dependent, rate-limiting step of the urea cycle;
(ii) glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), a NADPH
(reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate)–dependent enzyme that catalyzes
the reductive amination of a-ketoglutarate; and
(iii) glutamine synthetase (GS), which catalyzes
the ATP-dependent amination of glutamate to
generate glutamine (12, 13) (fig. S1A). Analysis
of transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome
Atlas for the ammonia-assimilating enzymes in
healthy and cancerous tissues revealed that ex-
pression of GS and GDH mRNA is significantly
increased across many cancer subtypes, whereas
CPS1 mRNA is increased only in the colon (Fig. 1B).
Among healthy tissues, GS and GDH are ubiqui-
tously expressed and CPS1 is expressed only in the
liver (fig. S1B). Breast cancers display increased
expression of both GS and GDH. Specifically, es-
trogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancers have
increased expression of GS and GDH relative to
that in other subtypes (14). Therefore, we used
ER+ breast cancer as a representative model to
probe for ammonia assimilation.
To investigate the fate of glutamine-derived
ammonia, we performed a metabolic tracing anal-
ysis with hydrophilic interaction liquid chroma-
tography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS)
and assessed the fate of [15N]amide-glutamine,
which liberates [15N]NH3 through glutaminase
activity (15). To identify the metabolic derivatives
of [15N]amide-glutamine in an unbiased manner,
we developed a method to screen the nitrogen
metabolome, which contained 211 15N-isotopologs
(table S1). The majority of the nitrogen meta-
bolome did not acquire 15N labeling; of 211 15N-
isotopologs, only 33 metabolites were labeled (fig.
S2). Consistent with previous studies, [15N]amide-
glutamine was incorporated into asparagine and
nucleotides (10) (Fig. 1C and fig. S3A). We also
identified 15N-isotopologs of proline, aspartate,
branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and gluta-
mate, which have no previous biosynthetic con-
nection to the amide nitrogen on glutamine (Fig.
1C and fig. S3B). The labeled nitrogen was liber-
ated as ammonia before production of these
metabolites, which suggests that an ammonia-
recycling pathway may synthesize the other glu-
tamine derivatives detected.
To test whether ammonia released during
glutaminolysis was necessary for production of
these unanticipated amide-nitrogen glutamine
derivatives, we treated cells with the glutamin-
ase inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-
thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), which at
1 mM is not cytotoxic or cytostatic in T47D and
MCF7 human breast cancer cell lines (16) (fig. S4,
A to C). BPTES treatment significantly decreased
15N-isotopologs of glutamate, proline, and as-
partate, whereas metabolites involved in direct
glutamine metabolism, such as nucleotides and
asparagine, remained labeled (Fig. 1D and fig.
S4D). Addition of ammonia to BPTES-treated
cells restored metabolites depleted by glutamin-
ase inhibition, demonstrating the specific contri-
bution of ammonia (fig. S4E). This is consistent
with findings that ammonia partially rescues pro-
liferative defects in glutamine-deprived breast
cancer cells (17).
We examined the potential mechanisms under-
lying assimilation of ammonia liberated during
glutaminolysis. Because [15N]amide-glutamine
did not elicit any isotopes of four urea cycle in-
termediates (ornithine, citrulline, argininosuc-
cinate, and arginine), we ruled out the activity
of CPS1 as a mechanism for ammonia assimi-
lation (fig. S2). Instead, our data indicated that
GDH was the primary point of ammonia as-
similation because glutamate is upstream of
proline, aspartate, glutamine, and BCAA syn-
thesis. However, the Michaelis-Menten constant
(Km) of GDH for ammonia is high (approximate-
ly 9 mM) and GDH reportedly favors oxidative
deamination over reductive amination in can-
cer cells (18–21). By contrast, GDH-catalyzed re-
ductive amination is prevalent in the liver, where
there is a sufficient concentration of ammonia
to enable catalysis in this direction (22). We
wondered whether increased concentrations
of ammonia in the tumor microenvironment
might also permit GDH-catalyzed reductive
amination.
To determine whether GDH assimilates ammo-
nia generated by glutamine catabolism, we used
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to deplete cells of
GDH, cultured them with [15N]amide-glutamine,
and then subjected them to nitrogen metabolome
scanning (fig. S4F). MCF7 and T47D cell lines
express both GDH1 and GDH2 isoforms, and
shRNAs targeted both isoforms (fig. S4G). The
abundance of 15N-isotopologs of glutamate and
downstream metabolites (proline, aspartate)
was significantly decreased in cells depleted of
GDH (Fig. 1E). Urea cycle intermediates (citrul-
line, argininosuccinate) remained unlabeled in
cells lacking GDH, underscoring the lack of
CPS1-mediated ammonia assimilation in breast

cient. We quantified the efficiency of ammonia

 recycling from glutamine catabolism by incu-
bating MCF7 cells with [15N2-13C5]glutamine.
Glutaminolysis generated [15N-13C5]glutamate
(glutamate M+6), and ammonia recycling was
measured by detection of [15N]glutamate (glu-
tamate M+1) (fig. S6D). We calculated the ratio
of the total amount of glutamate (glutamate
M+6 and glutamate M+1) to glutamate directly
generated in glutaminolysis (glutamate M+6)
(fig. S6E). In total, 1.57 molecules of gluta-
mate were generated from a single reaction
of glutaminolysis, indicating a 57% efficiency of
ammonia recycling (fig. S6F). Because both
processes are mitochondrial, localization may
support this high efficiency (24). GDH is a bi-
directional enzyme, so we also tested whether
the catalytic activity of oxidative deamination
or reductive amination was prevalent. In GDH-
depleted cells, ammonia recycling (glutamate
M+1) was decreased, but a-ketoglutarate (M+5)
was unchanged, suggesting a net activity of re-
ductive amination in this system (fig. S6, G and
H). In sum, these data indicate that ammonia
derived from glutaminolysis is recycled by re-
ductive amination catalyzed by GDH to support
the synthesis of glutamate and downstream me-
tabolites (Fig. 1F).
Because numerous reactions other than gluta-
minolysis generate ammonia, we investigated
whether free ammonia could be assimilated into
metabolicpathways. TooptimizeNH4Clfortracing
studies, we investigated whether exposure to in-
creasedconcentrationsofNH4Clwastoxictotumor
cells. Physiological concentrations of ammonia in
plasma are 0 to 50 mM in healthy human adults,
50 to 150 mM in newborns, and up to 1.0 mM in
patients with hyperammonemia (25). Supraphy-
siological concentrations of ammonia are toxic to
neurons and are sometimes assumed to be toxic
to tumor cells (7, 26, 27). However, NH4Cl was not
toxic to tumor cells, even at concentrations that
were toxic to primary human astrocytes (Fig. 2A
and fig. S7A). Previous reports have shown that
high concentrations of ammonia induce autoph-
agy in tumor cells (5). In MCF7 and T47D cell
lines, light chain 3 II (LC3II) lipidation was not
induced until 10 mM ammonia was added to
media—a concentration exceedinglevelsof ammo-
nia reported in the tumor microenvironment (fig.
S7B). Moreover, ammonia concentrations of 0
to 10 mM did not alter uptake of glucose or
glutamine, nor basal respiration (fig. S7, C to
E). Expression of the ammonia-assimilating en-
zymes GS, GDH, and CPS1 was not affected by
increasing ammonia concentration (fig. S7, F to
I), nor did 10 mM ammonia alter the pH of the
culture media (fig. S7J). These data indicate that
supraphysiological concentrations of ammonia
did not induce toxicity or metabolic stress in
breast cancer cells.
We also examined ammonia uptake by cells.
When breast cancer cells were cultured in low
concentrations of ammonia (0 to 1.0 mM), we ob-
served a net output of ammonia, which reverted
to net uptake as the extracellular concentration
of NH4Cl increased above 1 mM (fig. S7K). At
approximately 1.0 mM NH4Cl, ammonia was taken
up from the medium, such that ammonia entry
may be regulated by diffusion. In agreement with
this result, the characterized mechanism of am-
monium (NH4
+) import and export is through
facilitated diffusion with rhesus glycoproteins
(RhC and RhG) (28). Also, ammonia can diffuse
across the plasma membrane.
We performed steady-state and tracing ex-
periments in the presence of 0.75 mM NH4Cl
because it is the inflection point of ammonia
uptake and secretion and represents a low con-
centration of ammonia that is relevant to the

Downloaded from 
 tumor microenvironment. We used Metabo-
Analyst 3.0 to perform an unbiased pathway
analysis on the steady-state metabolites from
cells cultured with or without ammonia (fig.
S8A). The most significantly altered pathway
was glutamate, aspartate, and alanine metab-
olism. Exposure to NH4Cl elicited a signature
of increased transaminase activity, whereby the
abundance of ketoacids decreased and that of
amino acids derived from them increased
(Fig. 2B). Although amounts of nonessential
amino acids increased, the abundance of other
amino acids remained unchanged by ammo-
nia, indicating that ammonia did not affect
universal amino acid metabolism (fig. S8B).
Nor did ammonia alter the abundance of me-
tabolites from the urea cycle and nucleotides
(fig. S8, C and D).
MCF7and T47D cells were treated with 0.75 mM
[15N]NH4Cl and scanned for 15N-isotopologs
(fig. S9). Isotopolog abundances were scaled
to represent total ammonia pools, because treat-
ment with 0.75 mM enriched ~35% of the in-
tracellular ammonia pool (table S2). Consistent
with tracing performed with glutamine-derived
ammonia, we detected 15N labeling of gluta-
mate and downstream metabolites, such as pro-
line and aspartate (Fig. 2C). Upon tracing with
low levels of ammonia, a striking 20% of the
glutamate pool was labeled, implying an impor-
tant role for ammonia assimilation in gluta-
mate metabolism in cancer, as glutamate levels
are high (millimolar) (11). Tracing with high
levels of ammonia that have been reported in
the tumor microenvironment (3 mM) also eli-
cited the same signature of ammonia assimila-
tion (fig. S10A).
Consistent with steady-state data, all of the
amino acids labeled were generated through
glutamate-dependent transaminase reactions, ex-
cept proline and glutathione, which were made
in direct synthetic pathways from glutamate (fig.
S10B). Other nitrogen-containing metabolites
(particularly urea cycle intermediates) and es-
sential amino acids were not labeled by ammo-
nia (fig. S9). Furthermore, even though ammonia
generated 15N-isotopologs of glutamine, we de-
tected no 15N-isotopologs of any nucleotides,
which is distinct from ammonia metabolism in
serine-threonine kinase II (STKII)–low tumors
(29). We speculate that because labeled gluta-
mine is generated in the mitochondria, this pool
may not access the cytoplasm where de novo nu-
cleotide synthesis occurs, rendering nucleotides
unlabeled.
A time course of [15N]NH4Cl tracing revealed
that ammonia was rapidly converted into gluta-
mate, the first metabolite to reach steady state
(fig. S10, C to F). Thus, ammonia appears to be
primarily assimilated to generate glutamate, and
other labeled metabolites are produced in second-
ary reactions. We therefore investigated which
metabolic derivatives of ammonia required GDH
activity. In cells depleted of GDH, [15N]NH4Cl
labeling of glutamate was diminished, as was
labeling of metabolites downstream of glutamate
(Fig. 2, D and E). Indeed, this labeling was rescued
when shRNA-insensitive GDH1was overexpressed
(fig. S10, G and H). We did not observe adaptation
through the ammonia-assimilating enzymes GS
or CPS1 in cells lacking GDH. In both T47D and
MCF7 cells, glutamine and asparagine labeling
did not change in cells depleted of GDH (fig. S11).
Metabolites of the urea cycle were unlabeled in
cells depleted of GDH, indicating that adaptive
reprogramming of ammonia assimilation into
the urea cycle is not important in cultured breast
cancer cells (fig. S9). Our data reveal a general
mechanism by which free ammonia in the tumor
microenvironment can be harnessed for bio-
synthetic pathways.

 Ammonia assimilation in yeast has a funda-
mental role in supporting growth and proliferation
(30, 31). Because ammonia was not toxic to tu-
mor cells (Fig. 2A), we tested whether ammo-
nia might facilitate growth and proliferation
of breast cancer cells. As in yeast, addition of
NH4Cl to cell culture media increased prolif-
eration in breast cancer cell lines (fig. S12, A
and B). The culture medium was changed daily
to minimize ammonia accumulation, which
we measured to be approximately 0.3 mM per
day from glutamine degradation and cellular
metabolism (fig. S12, C and F). Moreover, in 3D
culture, in which cells are suspended in matrigel
and form “spheres” for growth, addition of
ammonia to media stimulated sphere growth
and cell proliferation (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig.
S12G). However, proliferation of primary hu-
man fibroblasts was not changed when am-
monia was added to culture media (fig. S13A).
Using [15N]NH4Cl tracing, we found that fibro-
blasts centrally assimilated ammonia to gener-
ate glutamine (fig. S13B), in line with their high
expression of glutamine synthetase (32). More-
over, [15N]amide-glutamine tracing revealed that
fibroblasts did not recycle glutamine-derived
ammonia to generate glutamate, aspartate, or
proline (fig. S13C). Thus, we hypothesized that
ammonia assimilation to generate glutamate
through GDH may be important for its role in
increased proliferation observed in breast can-
cer cells. Indeed, depletion of GDH prevented
the accelerated growth of breast cancer cells
treated with ammonia (Fig. 3C). Interestingly,
the glutamate derivatives proline, aspartate,
and glutathione are associated with prolifera-
tion and tumorigenesis (33–37).
To assess the effect of tumor-generated am-
monia on growth and proliferation, we com-
pared the ability of cancer cells to grow in 3D
cultures in which the medium was changed
either daily or every 3 days, allowing ammo-
nia to accumulate. The latter procedure pro-
vided a growth advantage for breast cancer
cells, which correlated with ammonia accumu-
lation in the media (Fig. 3, D and E). Therefore,
we tested whether ammonia recycling through
GDH was a critical aspect that influenced pro-
liferation. Cells depleted of GDH had no growth
defect when the culture medium was changed
daily, but the growth advantage when medium
was changed after 3 days was abrogated (Fig. 3F
and fig. S14, A to C). Furthermore, cells depleted
of GDH secreted more ammonia into the me-
dium, consistent with impairment of ammonia
recycling (Fig. 3G). In addition, treatment of
MCF7 cells in 3D culture with high ammonia
concentrations (3 mM NH4Cl) also stimulated
proliferation (fig. S14D).
To examine the physiological relevance of am-
monia in the tumor microenvironment in vivo,
we measured concentrations of ammonia that
accumulated in the interstitial fluids of ER+ xeno-
graft tumors. ER+ xenografts accumulated 0.8 to
3 mM ammonia in the interstitial fluids of the
tumor microenvironment, whereas plasma ammo-
nia concentrations were approximately 300 mM

 (Fig. 4A). This range of concentrations did not
induce autophagy and was shown to accelerate
growth and proliferation in vitro. Plasma ammo-
nia concentrations in mice harboring tumors
were not different from those in control mice
(fig. S15A).
We tested whether accumulated ammonia in
the tumor microenvironment was assimilated
into metabolic pathways in vivo. Mice harbor-
ing subcutaneous T47D breast tumors were
intraperitoneally injected with [15N]NH4Cl, and
the tumor, liver, and plasma were assessed for
15N-isotopologs over the next 1 to 4 hours (fig.
S15B). The liver and tumor used distinct meta-
bolic pathways for ammonia assimilation (Fig. 4B
and figs. S16 and S17A). In the liver, ammonia was
sequestered into the urea cycle, leading to labeling
of ornithine, citrulline, argininosuccinate, and
arginine (fig. S16). Although these labeled inter-
mediates of the urea cycle were also detected in
the plasma, they were undetectable in the tumor,
indicating that these breast tumors did not en-
gage the urea cycle for ammonia assimilation
in vivo (Fig. 4B and fig. S16). Proline and aspar-
tate, which were identified in vitro as metabolic
derivatives of ammonia, were also labeled in the
tumor in vivo. The metabolic pathways enabling
proline and aspartate labeling were likely from
tumor-autonomous metabolism, as labeled pro-
line and aspartate were not detected in the plasma
(Fig. 4B).
We also observed labeling of glutamine and
glutamate in the tumor. Because labeled gluta-
mine and glutamate were also found in the liver
and plasma, it is not clear whether these 15N-
isotopologs were generated tumor-autonomously.
Furthermore, the kinetics of glutamine labeling
in the tumor implied that a subset of the labeled
glutamine pool in the tumor may be taken up from
the plasma (Fig. 4B).
To distinguish systemic contributions of am-
monia metabolism from tumor-autonomous me-
tabolic pathways, we traced [15N]NH4Cl and
[15N]amide-glutamine in tumors ex vivo (fig.
S17, B to D). With [15N]NH4Cl, labeling of glu-
tamate, aspartate, proline, and glutamine was
recapitulated. Consistent with in vivo studies,
the urea cycle intermediates, nucleotides, and
other nitrogen-abundant metabolites were not
labeled. These data underscore a fundamental
role of ammonia for amino acid synthesis, par-
ticularly glutamate, aspartate, and proline in vivo.
Consistent with in vitro experiments, tumors
treated with [15N]amide-glutamine generated
labeled glutamate as well as the downstream
metabolites proline and aspartate, suggesting
that glutamine-derived ammonia may be recycled
in solid tumors (fig. S18A). In contrast to free
[15N]NH4Cl, which did not label metabolites of
the urea cycle in cells in vivo or in solid tumors
ex vivo, [15N]amide-glutamine, when added to
the tumors ex vivo, elicited labeling of the urea
cycle intermediate citrulline (fig. S17D). Thus,
an alternative pathway that does not require
ammonia may exist that connects the amide
nitrogen on glutamine to citrulline production
ex vivo.
We next generated a GDH-depleted xeno-
graft model to further investigate the mech-
anism of ammonia assimilation in vivo (Fig.
4C). Tumor-specific depletion of GDH signif-
icantly decreased tumor growth in vivo, con-
sistent with our findings that GDH-depleted
cells grow slower in conditioned media and are
insensitive to ammonia-induced growth in vitro
(Fig. 4D and fig. S18A). Because GDH-catalyzed
ammonia assimilation mediates growth and
proliferation in vitro, we used intraperitoneal
injection of [15N]NH4Cl in control and GDH-
depleted xenograft models to test whether GDH
also assimilates ammonia in vivo. Glutamate,
aspartate, and proline labeling were significant-
ly decreased in GDH-depleted tumors relative
to control tumors (Fig. 4E). GDH depletion did
not abrogate glutamine labeling, underscoring
the specificity of GDH for ammonia assimila-
tion to generate glutamate and the downstream
metabolites proline and aspartate.
To further validate that GDH-mediated
ammonia assimilation is tumor-autonomous,
we traced ammonia ex vivo in control and
GDH-depleted tumors. GDH depletion signif-
icantly decreased glutamate, aspartate, and
proline labeling (fig. S18B). Taken together,
these data show that tumor biomass is sup-
ported by both tumor-autonomous metabo-
lism of ammonia and systemic assimilation,
especially for glutamate-derived amino acids
(Fig. 4F).
Ammonia accumulates in the tumor micro-
environment because tumors are poorly vascu-
larized, making this a unique niche for ammonia
metabolism in the human body. Because ammo-
nia transport is mediated by diffusion, elevated
ammonia in the microenvironment leads to its
accumulation inside of tumor cells (fig. S18C).
Therefore, the ability to reassimilate this ammo-
nia into metabolic pathways is critical in this
context. In contrast, the liver reassimilates ammo-
nia to generate urea, which is a sink for excess
nitrogen and is excreted as metabolic waste to
protect against toxicity associated with systemic
ammonia accumulation. Tumor cells strictly re-
cycle this nitrogen to generate amino acids down-
stream of glutamate and do not engage the urea
cycle.
Our findings show that ammonia is an im-
portant nitrogen source for breast cancer me-
tabolism. Ammonia is not simply a metabolic
waste product, and it can be recycled to sup-
port the high demand for amino acid synthesis
in rapidly proliferating cells. Although ammo-
nia is sometimes considered a toxin, it stimu-
lated growth and proliferation in breast cancer
cells. This stimulatory effect appears to be me-
diated by GDH-catalyzed ammonia assimila-
tion. Furthermore, ammonia accumulated in
the tumor microenvironment and was used by
cancer cells for amino acid synthesis in vivo.
These biosynthetic pathways are supported in
both systemic and tumor-autonomous metab-
olism. Thus, metabolic recycling of ammonia
provides an important source of nitrogen for
breast cancer biomass.
