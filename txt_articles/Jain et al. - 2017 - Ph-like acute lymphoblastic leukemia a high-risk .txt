Key Points
• Approximately 20% to 25% of
adults with B-ALL have Ph-
like ALL with increased
frequency of Ph-like ALL in
adults with Hispanic ethnicity.
• Adult patients with CRLF21
ALL have poor long-term
outcomes; novel strategies
are needed to improve the
outcomes.
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a high-risk
subtype of ALL in children. There are conflicting data on the incidence and prognosis of
Ph-like ALL in adults. Patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL (B-ALL) who received
frontline chemotherapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center underwent gene expression
profiling of leukemic cells. Of 148 patients, 33.1% had Ph-like, 31.1% had Ph1, and 35.8%
had other B-ALL subtypes (B-other). Within the Ph-like ALL cohort, 61% had cytokine
receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) overexpression. Patients with Ph-like ALL had significantly
worse overall survival (OS), and event-free survival compared with B-other with a 5-year
survival of 23% (vs 59% for B-other, P 5 .006). Sixty-eight percent of patients with Ph-like
ALL were of Hispanic ethnicity. The following were associated with inferior OS on
multivariable analysis: age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.299; P < .001), white blood cell count (HR,
1.910; P 5 .017), platelet count (HR, 7.437; P 5 .005), and Ph-like ALL (HR, 1.818; P 5 .03).
Next-generation sequencing of the CRLF21 group identified mutations in the JAK-STAT
and Ras pathway in 85% of patients, and 20% had a CRLF2 mutation. Within the CRLF21
group, JAK2 mutation was associated with inferior outcomes. Our findings showhigh frequency of Ph-like ALL in adults, an increased
frequency of Ph-like ALL in adults of Hispanic ethnicity, significantly inferior outcomes of adult patients with Ph-like ALL, and
significantly worse outcomes in the CRLF21 subset of Ph-like ALL. Novel strategies are needed to improve the outcome of these
patients. (Blood. 2017;129(5):572-581)
Introduction
Treatment outcomes of adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (B-ALL) remain suboptimal with a long-term disease-free
survival (DFS) of around 40% to 45%.1,2 This is in contrast to
childhood B-ALL where DFS of .90% is routinely achieved.3 The
inferior outcome of older patients has been linked to several factors,
both disease-related (higher frequency of high-risk genomic subgroups
such as Philadelphia chromosome [Ph1]) and patient-related (poor
tolerance to chemotherapy). Recently, a high-risk subgroup of B-ALL
called Ph-like ALL was identified in children and adolescents and
young adults (AYAs).4-7 The leukemic cell gene expression profile of
Ph-like ALL is similar to that of Ph1 ALL; however, instead of BCR-
ABL1, such patients harbor a highly diverse range of genetic alterations
activating tyrosine kinase signaling.6,7 These patients have frequent
deletion of the transcription factor IKAROS family zinc finger 1
(IKZF1), also common in Ph1 ALL.4,5,8 Ph-like ALL comprises up to
15% of childhood B-ALL, and 20% to 25% in AYAs.7 These patients
have a very high rate of disease relapse and poor overall survival
(OS).7,9-11
There are conflicting data regarding the incidence and prognosis of
Ph-like ALL in adults.12-15 In a preliminary report of 692 patients with
B-ALL, Ph-like ALL comprised 26% of patients between 21 and
39 years of age and 20% of patients age $40 years.7,12 These patients
were treated on varying pediatric and adult ALL treatment regimens.
Significantly inferior outcomes were reported for patients with Ph-like
ALL, with a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS of 23.2% and
26.5%, respectively. In contrast, Herold et al analyzed outcomes of 207
patients across all age groups treated on German ALL trials, and
reported a lower incidence (13%) of Ph-like ALL in adults.14,15
Similarly, Boer et al analyzed patients treated on various Dutch-
Belgian HOVON trials and reported 17% incidence of Ph-like ALL

From 
 in adults (11% in $40-year age group).13 Both EFS and OS were
lower in the Ph-like ALL subgroup than in the other B-ALL
subgroup, albeit not statistically significant.
Two broad genetic subgroups of Ph-like ALL have been identi-
fied.7 Approximately 50% of patients with Ph-like ALL have
overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2).6,7,16-18
Almost half of the patients with CRLF2 overexpression have
concomitant JAK-STAT mutations, most commonly JAK2 R683G,
which result in JAK-STAT activation amenable to JAK inhibition.7
In Ph-like ALL patients without CRLF2 overexpression, fusions
involving JAK2, ABL1, ABL2, and many other tyrosine kinases are
common, and many are amenable to ABL-type inhibitors (tyrosine
kinase inhibitors [TKIs]) (fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, or
PDGFRB) or JAK inhibitors (rearrangements of JAK2 and EPOR).6,7,19
Thus, genomic characterization of Ph-like ALL has significant
therapeutic implications with the emerging use of kinase inhibitors
in this patient population.6,7,16,20-23 Therefore, it is imperative to
establish the incidence and clinical/genomic features of Ph-like
ALL in adults. Here, we report the genomic characteristics and
outcomes of adult patients with Ph-like ALL uniformly treated with
a hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,
and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) or an augmented Berlin-
Frankfurt-M¨
unster (BFM) regimen at a single institution. We also
report data on targeted next-generation sequencing of 303 recur-
rently mutated genes in 40 patients with CRLF2 overexpression. Our
data demonstrate a high frequency and poor outcome of Ph-like ALL
in adults.
Patients and methods
Study groups
A total of 173 samples from newly diagnosed patients with B-ALL underwent
genomic testing (see next section). These samples were tested as part of a larger
multicenter study defining the genomics of Ph-like ALL.24 Thirty-three of these
patients (age, ,40 years) were included in a previous report.7 All patients were
newly diagnosed and received induction chemotherapy at MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC). Twenty-five samples were excluded due to suboptimal
sample quality. An additional 7 previously untreated patients were found to have
CRLF2 overexpression by flow cytometry, and were confirmed by CRLF2
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; both flow cytometry and FISH were
performed at MDACC). These patients received induction chemotherapy at
MDACC, and were included in the outcome analysis (but not for subtype
frequency calculation). A total of 155 patients were included in the final data
analysis reported here. Patients were categorized as Ph-like ALL, Ph1 (BCR-
ABL1) ALL, and the remaining patients (not Ph-like, not Ph1) were categorized
asB-otherALL.Patientethnicitywasperpatientself-reportasdocumentedinthe
medical record at the time of the initial visit. Patients received either hyper-
CVAD–based therapies (all age groups) or an augmented BFM regimen (for
patients ,40 years of age). The details of these regimens have been published
previously.1,25-29 The choice of the 2 regimens was based on a variety of factors:
time period (hyper-CVAD, year 2000 onwards; augmented BFM, years 2006-
2012); age (18 years and older for hyper-CVAD–based regimens; 40 years and
younger for augmented BFM); clinical trial eligibility; insurance coverage of
clinical trials; and patient or physician preference. In the Ph1 cohort, all but 3
patients received TKIs (imatinib, n 5 12; dasatinib, n 5 24; ponatinib, n 5 7).
Response assessment was performed with bone marrow examination including
6-color flow cytometry after induction and every 1 to 2 months thereafter
(until the best response was achieved).30 Minimal residual disease (MRD)
was assessed by flow cytometry, with a sensitivity of 0.01%. This study was
approvedbytheMDACC,St.JudeChildren’sResearchHospital,andUniversity
of New Mexico (UNM) Cancer Center Institutional Review Boards and carried
out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Genomic profiling
Gene expression profiling was performed on 148 RNA samples using either
U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as previously
described (n 5 30),7 or a customized Taqman low-density array (LDA) card
(n 5 118) to identify patients with the Ph-like ALL gene signature,31 and
additional alterations including BCR-ABL1, ETV6-ABL1, TCF3-PBX1, P2RY8-
CRLF2, and ERG-deregulated ALL. Given the tight correlation between the
Ph-like prediction results of LDA and gene expression arrays,31 these were used
as alternative approaches. Patients with a coefficient of 0.5 to 1 by LDA card
were designated as Ph-like. High expression of CRLF2 was determined by LDA
(D cycle threshold #6), and CRLF2 rearrangement (IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-
CRLF2) was confirmed using FISH.
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis was performed
forcaseswithavailableDNAusingeitherSNP6.0microarrays(Affymetrix)orthe
Infinium Omni 2.5 Exome-8 BeadChip kit (Illumina) (details in supplemental
Methods, available on the Blood Web site). Targeted next-generation gene
sequencing of 303 recurrently mutated genes (L300 panel; MDACC) (see
supplemental Methods for details; supplemental Table 1 for gene list) was
performed in a cohort of patients with CRLF21 Ph-like ALL.
FISH
FISHforCRLF2rearrangementwasperformedwithsequentialhybridizationfor
CRLF2, P2RY8, and IGH using probes prepared from clones RP13-167H21,
RP11-309M23, and RP13-76L22 (CRLF2 39), WI2-3390E22, WI2-2865K18,
WI2-0735M13, and WI2-1570L13 (region between CRLF2 and P2RY8), RP13-
297E16 and RP11-449L4 (P2RY8 59), and RP5-998D24 and RP11-1065N8
(IGH enhancer).
Statistical analysis
The Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess
categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to asses OS and EFS using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The OS was
calculated as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or
deathofany cause.TheEFS wascalculatedfromthe beginningof treatment until
an event (relapse, treatment failure, death during induction, or death during
complete remission). Patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-
SCT) were not censored at the time of transplant. Univariable analysis (UVA)
and multivariable analysis (MVA) were performed to identify potential
prognostic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, white blood cell [WBC] $30 3 109/L,
hemoglobin ,10 g/dL, platelet ,100 3 109/L, central nervous system [CNS]
involvement at diagnosis, Ph-like ALL, treatment received) associated with OS.
For UVA/MVA, patients with Ph1 ALL were excluded. For MVA, we used the
Cox proportional hazards model for OS. A P value ,.05 (2-tailed) was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Of the 148 patients whose samples were analyzed by gene expression
profiling, 49 patients (33.1%) had Ph-like ALL, 46 patients (31.1%)
had Ph1 ALL, and 53 patients (35.8%) had B-other ALL (Figure 1). A
total of 14 patients within the B-other group had mixed-lineage
leukemia (MLL) rearrangements. In the Ph-like ALL cohort, 30
patients (61%) had overexpression of CRLF21, and 19 (39%) lacked
CRLF2 overexpression. In the patients younger than 40 years of age,
the incidence of Ph-like ALL was 42% compared with 24% in those
40 years or older (P 5 .02) (supplemental Figure 1). The incidence of
Ph-like ALL was similar in the 40- to 59-year and $60 year age
group (22% vs 26%, respectively). As expected, the incidence of
Ph1 ALL was higher in the older patients (41% in patients $40 years
compared with 22% in patients ,40 years of age).
For further analysis, we included the 7 additional CRLF21 patients
(see “Patients and methods”). The median age for the entire cohort

 (N 5 155) was 38 years (range, 15-84 years). Five patients were ,18
years of age. The baseline characteristics of Ph-like ALL, Ph1 ALL,
and B-other ALL are listed in Table 1. Patients with Ph-like ALL were
younger (median age, 33.5 years) compared with B-other (median age,
38 years; P 5 .23) and Ph1 ALL (median age, 49 years; P 5 .001 for
3 group comparison). There were significantly more men in the Ph-like
ALL group (66% in Ph-like vs 48% Ph1 vs 36% B-other; P 5 .006).
Interestingly, 68% of the patients with Ph-like ALL were of Hispanic
ethnicity.ThiswassignificantlyhighercomparedwithPh1ALL(35%)
and B-other (30%) (P , .001). A total of 124 patients (80%) received
hyper-CVAD–based induction chemotherapy. The remaining 20%
were treated with an augmented BFM regimen. A total of 21 patients
underwent allo-SCT in first remission (Ph-like [n 5 2, both CRLF21],
Ph1 [n 5 9], and B-others [n 5 10]).
Clinical outcomes
The rate of complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete platelet
recovery (CRp) was similar in the 3 disease subgroups (Ph-like ALL,
89%; Ph1 ALL, 93%; B-other, 94%; P 5 .57) (Table 2). However,
patients with Ph-like ALL were significantly less likely to achieve

 vs 56% for Ph1 ALL vs 87% for B-other; P , .001). Outcomes of the
Ph-like ALL and B-other group based on MRD status are shown in
supplemental Figure 2. Achievement of MRD negativity at the time of
remission had no impact on inferior long-term outcomes of Ph-like
ALL subset (median OS; MRD2 group, 26.2 months vs MRD1 group,
23.0 months; P 5 .318). Patients with Ph-like ALL had significantly
worse OS, EFS, and remission duration compared with B-other
(Figure 2; supplemental Figure 3). The 5-year OS for Ph-like ALL and
B-other were 23% and 59%, respectively (P 5 .006). Patients with
MLL rearrangements had very poor outcomes with a median OS of
10.2 months (supplemental Figure 3).
The poor outcome of Ph-like ALL was maintained when only
hyper-CVAD–treated patients were considered (Figure 3; supplemen-
tal Figure 4). For the hyper-CVAD–treated patients, the median OS
for Ph-like ALL and B-others was 23.4 months and 94.5 months,
respectively (P 5 .012).
WedidnotfindevidencethattheoutcomewiththeaugmentedBFM
regimen (n 5 19) was different from that of hyper-CVAD (n 5 18)
in Ph-like patients under 40 years of age (P 5 .505; supplemental
Figure 5), but due to smallpatient numbers we do not have the power to
address this question in this study.
Ph-like ALL characteristics, genomics, and outcomes
Table 3 lists the baseline characteristics of Ph-like ALL, divided by
CRLF2 expression status. The patients with CRLF2 rearrangement
tended to be older with higher WBC count at presentation than non-
CRLF2 Ph-like ALL. Seventy-eight percent of patients with CRLF2
overexpression were of Hispanic ethnicity compared with 48% with
non-CRLF2Ph-likeALLand30%withB-otherALL.From37patients
with CRLF2 overexpression, 29 patients had FISH performed for
CRLF2 rearrangement. The majority of patients had IGH-CRLF2
rearrangement (76%), followed by P2RY8-CRLF2 (17%). Two
patients had an unknown fusion partner.
There was no difference in the CR/CRp rate and MRD remission
rate between the Ph-like CRLF21 and Ph-like non-CRLF2 group
(supplemental Table 2). Patients with CRLF2 overexpression had
significantly inferior OS, EFS, and remission duration when compared
with other genomic subgroups, including Ph-like non-CRLF2 group
(Figure 4). Notably, 5-year survival in the CRLF21 group was ,20%.
IKZF1 status was analyzed in a subset of Ph-like ALL patients with
available material (n 5 41 of 56, 73%). IKZF1 deletions were detected
in 68% of patients(28 of 41) with Ph-like ALLand were more common
in the CRLF21 group (CRLF21, 21 of 25 [84%]; non-CRLF2, 7 of 16
[44%], P 5 .014). Within the Ph-like ALL subgroup, the presence of
IKZF1 deletions did not influence the OS (supplemental Figure 6).
We performed targeted sequencing of 303 genes (L300 panel;
MDACC) in 40 CRLF21 patients (32 treatment naive, 8 relapsed/
refractory), 15 of whom had matched germ line control (DNA from
remission bone marrow). The mutation spectrum is shown in Figure 5
and in supplemental Table 3. Overall, 85% of the patients had a gene
mutation leading to activation of JAK-STAT or the Ras pathway. JAK2
mutation was detected in 18 of the patients (45%) (clonal, n 5 8;
subclonal, n 5 10) (R683G, n 5 6; T875N, n 5 4; R683S, n 5 3;
R687Q, n 5 2; I682F, n 5 1; D873E, n 5 1; L611S, n 5 1), and JAK1
mutation in 4 patients (10%) (clonal, n 5 3; subclonal, n 5 1). KRAS
was found to be mutated in 10 patients (25%) (clonal, n 5 5; subclonal,
n 5 5) (G13D, n 5 3; G12D, n 5 2; G12V, n 5 2; A146T, n 5 2;
G13GG, n 5 1) and NRAS in 5 patients (12.5%) (clonal, n 5 2;
subclonal, n 5 3) (G12S, G12C, G12D, Q61R, and Q61L, each n 5 1).
OtherrecurrentmutationsincludedCRLF2(n58,20%)(clonal,n52;
subclonal, n 5 6), IKZF1 (n 5 7, 17.5%) (clonal, n 5 4; subclonal,
n 5 3), ASXL1 (n 5 5, 12.5%), and PAX5 (n 5 5, 12.5%). Four patients
had polyclonal mutations in the signaling pathways.
Notably, the CRLF2 mutation (F232C, n 5 7; W46C, n 5 1) was
identified in 20% of patients in this study. Of the 8 patients with a
CRLF2 mutation, CRLF2 FISH was performed on 6 patients; all had
CRLF2 translocation detected (IGH-CRLF2 [n 5 5]; P2RY8-CRLF2
[n 5 1]). CRLF2 mutation was mutually exclusive with K/NRAS
mutations but 2 patients had concomitant JAK2 and CRLF2 mutations.
Among the CRLF21 group, both IKZF1 deletion and mutation data
were available for 20 patients. Interestingly, all CRLF21 patients had
an IKZF1 aberration (13 deletion, 4 concomitant deletion and mutation,
and 3 mutation only).
Among the previously untreated patients with CRLF21 ALL
(n532),JAK2mutationwasdetectedin14(44%).ThemedianOSfor
JAK2-mutated patients was 18.8 months compared with 26.9 months
for patients with wild-type JAK2 (P 5 .012) (supplemental Figure 7).
UVA and MVA for OS
By UVA, the following variables were significant for survival: age
(,60vs$60years),WBCcount(,30vs$303109/L),plateletcount
(,100 vs $100 3 109/L), and Ph-like ALL (Table 4). In MVA
adjusting for the variables used in UVA, the same variables were
significant for survival (age: hazard ratio [HR], 3.299 [P , .001]; WBC
count: HR, 1.910 [P 5 .017]; platelet count: HR, 7.437 [P 5 .005];
Ph-like ALL: HR, 1.818 [P 5 .03]).
Discussion
We report here long-term clinical outcomes in one of the largest series
of newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph-like ALL. All patients
received induction chemotherapy at our institution with either hyper-
CVAD or an augmented BFM regimen. Our findings show (1) high
frequency of Ph-like ALL in adults, (2) increased frequency of Ph-like
ALL in adult patients of Hispanic ethnicity, (3) significantly inferior
outcomes of adult patients with Ph-like ALL in a previously untreated
patient cohort, and (4) among the Ph-like ALL group, significantly
worse outcomes in patients with CRLF2 overexpression.
In children, the incidence of Ph-like ALL is reported to be 10% to
15%, and is associated with poor outcomes.7,9-11 In adults, the data so
far are limited and conflicting.12-14 We report here a 33% incidence of
Ph-like ALL in adults with B-ALL. Analysis of 692 adult patients with
B-ALL that included a subset of patients described in this manuscript
reported 20% to25% incidence of Ph-like ALL.12,24 In contrast, 2 other
studies have reported a lower incidence of Ph-like ALL in adults at
around 10%.13,14 Notably, both studies that reported lower incidence of
Ph-like ALL are from Europe, and racial and ethnic differences in the
patient population studied may have contributed to these differences

From 
 (see next paragraph). Additionally, variance in the genetic signatures
used to classify Ph-like ALL could have led to these differences.32
We also report a significantly higher rate of Ph-like ALL in adult
patients of Hispanic ethnicity. This was striking for the CRLF21 group
where 78% of the patients were Hispanic. Harvey et al had reported
similar preponderance of children and adolescents with Hispanic
ethnicity in a Children’s Oncology Group study of patients with
CRLF21 ALL.9 Genome-wide association studies in children and
AYAs with ALL have identified inherited genetic variants in GATA3
that are associated with Ph-like ALL, and show an increased frequency
in Hispanics and individuals with Native American or indigenous
genetic ancestry.33,34 Together, these data provide a plausible explana-
tionforincreasedincidenceandpooroutcomesofHispanicpatientswith
B-ALL and may explain the higher incidence of Ph-like ALL seen in
adults within the United States vs other non-Hispanic Northern
European populations.35,36 The significantly high number of patients
of Hispanic ethnicity in our study reflects the referral pattern for our
institution.
The majority (148 of 155, 95.4%) of patients included in this series
had Ph-like ALL status determined by gene expression profiling. We
additionally included 7 patients in the Ph-like ALL cohort who had
overexpression of CRLF2 by flow cytometry and had CRLF2
rearrangements by FISH but were not tested by gene expression.
Recognizing this as a potential caveat, the presence of CRLF21
overexpression without the Ph-like gene signature is reportedly rare
(,5%) in young adults and older adults with B-ALL.7,12 Additionally,
the clinical outcomes data remained unaffected after the exclusion of
these 7 patients (supplemental Figure 8).
Children and adolescents with Ph-like ALL have poor clinical
outcomes.7Wecorroboratethesefindingsinalargecohortofuniformly
treated adult patients. The 5-year survival for Ph-like ALL was
markedly inferior to B-other ALL (23% vs 59%, respectively; P 5
.006). This was despite the fact that the patients with Ph-like ALL were
younger compared with those in the B-other group. At MDACC,
hyper-CVAD is used as a standard induction regimen for AYAs with
outcomes similartoaugmented BFMina nonrandomized study.29The
poor outcomes of Ph-like ALL were maintained when only hyper-
CVAD–treated patients were considered. In a multivariable analysis,
Ph-like ALL remained significant for inferior survival. Boer et al
reported lower EFS and OS in the Ph-like ALL subgroup than in the
other B-ALL subgroup in an analysis of patients treated on Dutch-
Belgium HOVON trials.13 This was, however, not statistically sig-
nificant likely due to small patient numbers. Again, the difference in the
patient population studied including differences in genetic ancestry,
treatment regimen used, and differences in the genetic signature and
detailed genomic classification used to classify Ph-like ALL may have
contributed to these inconsistent results. Only 2 of the 56 patients with
Ph-like ALL underwent allo-SCT in first remission in our study. Given

From 
 the limited data with transplant, we are unable to assess the role of
transplant for these patients.
In children, MRD-directed therapy has been reported to abolish the
prognosticsignificanceofPh-likeALL.37Weassessedtheoutcomesby
MRD status. In our analysis, the outcomes of Ph-like ALL, even if they
achieve MRD2 remission, remained suboptimal with a median OS
of 26.2 months compared with 23.0 months for MRD1 group
(supplemental Figure 2, P 5 .318). Because the majority of patients
withPh-like ALL received hyper-CVAD(an intensive regimen) based
treatment, we believe further intensification of chemotherapy treat-
ment is unlikely to benefit adult patients with Ph-like ALL. It
remains to be determined whether addition of novel monoclonal
antibodies (such as inotuzumab ozogamicin) or bispecific antibodies
(such as blinatumomab) could improve the outcome of this group
of patients.
We also report significant poor outcomes for adult patients with
CRLF2 rearrangement with a 5-year survival of ,20%. The reason for
the inferior outcomes of patients with Ph-like ALL and CRLF2
overexpressioncomparedwithnon-CRLF2Ph-likeALLisunclear,but
could be associated with high frequency of IKZF1 aberrations found in
this study. Roberts et al reported poor outcomes in young adults with
IKZF1 aberrations, irrespective of the Ph-like ALL status.7 Patients
with CRLF21 and concomitant JAK2 mutation had significantly
inferior outcomes compared with the CRLF21 JAK2 wild-type group,
consistent with previously reported findings in a cohort of children and
young adults.7 CRLF2, also known as thymic stromal lymphopoietin
receptor (TSLPR), is part of the heterodimeric receptor complex that
includes interleukin-7 receptor a chain and signals in response to
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP is a cytokine that upon
bindingtotheTSLPRinducesJAK/STATpathwaysignaling.Aberrant
TSLP/TSLPR signaling has been shown to activate multiple signaling
transduction pathways including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
STAT5, and others,38 many of which have been shown biologically
important for ALL blast survival.39,40
We alsoreport mutation profiling of adultCRLF21Ph-like ALL. A
majority of patients (85%) harbored a mutation in 1 or more genes
involved in activation of the JAK-STAT or RAS pathways. Notably,
we found a higher frequency of CRLF2 mutation, seen in 20% patients
in this study. This appears more frequent than in pediatric patients (3 of
134, 2.2%)41 and inrange with a smaller adult series (3 of 14, 21.4%).42

From 
 constitutive dimerization, cytokine-independent growth, and activation
of JAK/STAT signaling.42
Constitutive or ligand-dependent activation of JAK/STAT signal-
ing occurs in a large fraction of patients with Ph-like ALL (CRLF2
overexpression, JAK2/EPOR rearrangements, IL7R mutations).7,16,40
Preclinical data indicate antileukemia efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors such
as ruxolitinib or novel type II JAK2 kinase inhibitors in the in vivo
patient-derived xenograft models or genetically engineered mouse
models,7,19,43 and combination of ruxolitinib and standard chemother-
apy will be tested in ongoing or planned clinical trials.23 Patients with
ABL1, ABL2,and PDGFRB rearrangementscould be targeted by ABL-
type kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib.6,12,20,21,23 Allo-SCT remains
a viable option for this group of patients, though data in adult patients
is lacking. Preclinical data with TSLPR-targeted CAR T cells is
encouraging,44 and represents a potential therapy option.
In summary, Ph-like ALL represents a high-risk disease subtype of
adult B-ALL. In a group of patients uniformly treated with frontline
hyper-CVAD–based chemotherapy, the outcomes of Ph-like ALL
were significantly inferior to the B-other subgroup. Novel strategies are
needed to improve the outcome of this group of patients.
