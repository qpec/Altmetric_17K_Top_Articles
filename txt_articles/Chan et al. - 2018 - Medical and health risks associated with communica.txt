Introduction
Complex emergencies remain a major threat to human well-
being in the 21st century. More than 300 000 Rohingya people
from Myanmar, one of the most forgotten minorities globally
(International Organization for Migration, 2017a), have fled to
neighboring countries, mainly Bangladesh, over the past decades
(United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2017; Interna-
tional Committee of the Red Cross, 2017; Beyrer & Kamarulzaman,
2017; White, 2017). Using the Rohingya people in Bangladesh as a
case context, this perspective article synthesizes evidence in the
published literature regarding the possible key health risks
associated with the five main health and survival supporting
domains, namely water and sanitation, food and nutrition, shelter
and non-food items, access to health services, and information, for
the displaced living in refugee camp settlements in Asia.
The case: Rohingya people in Bangladesh 2017
The Rohingya people have long been marginalized (Mahmood
et al., 2017). Maungdaw in Rakhine State of Myanmar has been the
epicenter of violence, and in August 2017, due to an escalation of
the violence, an estimated 624 000 people fled from Rakhine State
to Bangladesh (International Organization for Migration, 2017b).
Some of these asylum seekers crossed the border by land, while
others crossed the Naf River, a natural border between the two
countries, and landed at Shah Porir Dwip, the southern tip of
Bangladesh. Poorly equipped, overcrowded boats often capsized,
and the fleeing population mostly arrived in Bangladesh at night or
in the early morning after sailing the 3–4-km perilous journey
across the Naf River at high tide (International Organization for
Migration, 2017c). Those asylum seekers who managed to reach
the shore were met by the Bangladeshi army, who coordinated
their settlement and the provision of small quantities of food,
water, and non-food items (such as buckets, water containers,
shelter material, and sometimes even cash). Some were offered
medical 
consultations 
and 
drug 
prescriptions, 
which 
were
provided by health teams at the military and local hospitals.
Most of these refugees were relocated to Cox’s Bazar in south-
eastern Bangladesh. Two registered refugee camps (United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): Kutupalong and
Nayapara) and two makeshift settlements existed at Cox’s Bazar
before the refugee surge in August 2017. The influx of refugees after
August 25, 2017 stretched the capacity of the existing camps and
makeshift settlements, and additional spontaneous settlements
were established in Hakimpara, Jamtoli, and Unchiprang (Interna-
tional Organization for Migration, 2017b). The survival of these

 people depends on the already overstretched aid agencies and
their resources (Milton et al., 2017).
Medical and health risks associated with the context
In emergency and crisis settings, water and sanitation, food and
nutrition, shelter and non-food items, access to health services,
and information are the five crucial domains securing the health
and survival of the affected population (Chan, 2017).
Water and sanitation
Although clean drinking water points are available in the
makeshift settlements (e.g., United Nations Children’s Fund), the
international water accessibility standard of “water availability
within 500 meters from households” (The Sphere Project, 2011)
has often not been achievable. Refugees have had to drill holes for
underground water and some have collected water directly from
the river; this water is of questionable quality for basic hygiene
(White, 2017) (Figure 1). Water safety has been compromised, as
people have bathed, washed, and practiced open defecation in the
drinking water sources (Physicians for Human Rights, 2010)
(Figure 2). Recent water testing in the settlements showed that
92% of the water was contaminated with Escherichia coli and that
48% was highly contaminated (>100 CFU/100 ml) (World Health
Organization, 2017a). In 2015, acute watery diarrhea (AWD) was
found to account for 7–9% of morbidity in the refugee camps
(Milton et al., 2017), and the prevalence of AWD was reported to be
around 22% of consultations. An overall upward trend of reported
cases was observed during the first 3 months of the crisis.
Water-borne 
disease 
outbreaks 
such 
as 
cholera, 
bloody
diarrhea, typhoid, and hepatitis E have been a major concern
in the camps. As cholera is considered the greatest health risk
(White, 2017), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)/
World Health Organization (WHO) launched the world’s second
largest oral cholera vaccination campaign in October 2017, and
900 000 doses were prepared for a vaccination campaign in
Ukhiya and Teknaf, two sub-districts of Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh.
As the first round of the campaign, 650 000 doses were targeted at
those aged 1 year or older. Children between 1 and 5 years of age
could opt to receive an additional dose during the second round of
the campaign for enhanced protection (United Nations Children’s
Fund, 2017a,b). However, although a single dose of oral cholera
vaccine has been proven to be efficacious in children older than 5
years and in adults (Qadri et al., 2016), the gaps in refugee
registration, fluidity of the refugee population, and problems in
vaccination record management have continued to affect the
effectiveness of this campaign (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2017a).
Highly contagious fecal oral diseases such as hepatitis A and E
infections are also common. In refugee camps where settlers are
predominantly young and there are pregnant women, hepatitis E
infection is a significant concern. Although the case fatality rate for
hepatitis E in the general population is about 1% (Emerson and
Purcell, 2003), the death rate from hepatitis E infection in pregnant
women can increase to 20–25% if the infection occurs in the third
trimester (World Health Organization, 2017b). Hepatitis E infec-
tion outbreaks have occurred in the region; for example, Nepal
reported 7000 cases in an outbreak occurring in 2014 (Shrestha
et al., 2015). In the displaced camp setting, hepatitis E infection has
been reported in Ethiopia (2014/2015) and South Sudan (2012/
2013) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). Although hepatitis E
infection has not yet been reported in the Rohingya camps, an
increasing trend in reported cases of acute jaundice syndrome
(AJS) has appeared in certain specific settlements (World Health
Organization, 2017a).
Food security and nutrition
Food security and chronic nutrition stress will put the
population at high risk of communicable disease. In Maungdaw,
Myanmar, global acute malnutrition (GAM) was reported to be
24.9% and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) to be 4.7% in 2013
(Rakhine Commission of Inquiry, 2013). In the two registered
UNHCR camps, GAM was reported to be 13% and stunting to be
52–57% in children aged 6–59 months in 2015 (Milton et al., 2017).
Furthermore, a report from November 2017 stated that an
estimated 240 000 children are in need of nutritional support
(International Organization for Migration, 2017d). Children with
SAM complications 
require hospitalization, 
but 
the 
current
medical and health facilities may have limited capacity to manage

 SAM complications. In addition, untreated parasitic intestinal
infections might worsen the nutritional status, as severe and
prolonged 
diarrhea 
may 
further 
induce 
malnutrition 
and
contribute to the vicious cycle of poor nutritional outcomes across
all age groups. Data from the Inter Sector Coordination Group
(ISCG) have shown that the rate of SAM in the refugees could be as
high as 7.5% (International Organization for Migration, 2017b).
The quantity and quality of food are not guaranteed, even with
the daily distribution of 
food. A 2013 report on nutrient
deficiencies in the Rohingya people in Rakhine State, showed that
30% of children under 5 years of age were in need of micronutrient
supplementation (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs, 2013). In 2015, anemia was found to be prevalent in
children (43–49%) and women of reproductive age (13%) (Milton
et al., 2017). In addition, although no specific report has
highlighted food poisoning and safety issues in camps, diarrhea
patterns associated with food-borne/fecal–oral diseases should be
closely monitored.
Environment, shelter, and non-food items
Overcrowding, 
indoor 
cooking 
practices, 
and 
suboptimal
shelters constructed with air-impermeable plastic sheets all
contribute to fire and injury risks, poor indoor air quality, and
the proliferation of infectious diseases such as acute respiratory
infections, measles, and tuberculosis within the camps. Acute
respiratory infection has remained the primary cause of death for
the camp population living in Cox’s Bazar (28%) and for children
under 5 years of age (38%) (World Health Organization, 2017a).
Chronic communicable diseases such as tuberculosis should be of
concern, as Myanmar, from where the recent refugees have come,
was ranked as one of the top 30 countries for tuberculosis in 2016
(World Health Organization, 2017c). A lack of resources, technical
capacity gaps in implementation (e.g., contact tracing), and non-
completion of the 6–9 months directly observed therapy (DOTS) in
this mobile population remain key dilemmas when offering TB
management for the refugee population in suboptimal camps or
unorganized residential settings.
Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, where most of the
refugee settlements are currently located, are prone to natural
disasters. The makeshift nature of the settlements, compounded
by poor water and sanitation infrastructure, has rendered the camp
settlers extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the monsoon and
flooding. Proactive disaster preparedness and mitigation measures
to reduce the population and environmental vulnerability are
urgently needed before the annual rainy and monsoon season: in
this area, over 80% of the annual rainfall falls during April to
October (Bangladesh Water Development Board, 2014).

 In addition, even before the rainy and flooding seasons, poor
water drainage, improper management of non-food items (such as
buckets), and the undulating surface of the plastic sheets of
shelters and bamboo poles may encourage the accumulation of
stagnant water, which may provide an ideal breeding site for
disease vectors such as flies and mosquitoes. Reports have already
indicated fever of unknown origin (FUO) to be the most commonly
reported reason for consultations in various clinics (World Health
Organization, 2017a). Given that the settlements are in areas prone
to malaria and Japanese encephalitis (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2017b), a protracted stay in these camp locations
will expose the population to the risk of vector-borne disease if
environmental measures and awareness are not highlighted. The
distribution of mosquito nets and other measures for mosquito
control (community education regarding the regular clearing of
stagnant water) should also be attempted before the next rainy
season.
Moreover, refugees generally lack essential non-food items to
protect and maintain their health and dignity (e.g., female hygiene
packs, etc.). Most refugees in the Bangladesh camps do not possess
any footwear. Not only does being barefoot predispose the person
to foot injury and trauma in this precarious settlement environ-
ment, but the risks of contracting contagious tinea and parasitic
intestinal infections such as hookworm and whipworm (Chan,
2017) are high. Such infections may worsen any pre-existing
malnutrition, increase the anemia risk, and complicate wound
healing.
Health care
Continuous efforts are required to maintain childhood immu-
nization for vaccine-preventable diseases (Rakhine Commission of
Inquiry, 2013). Recent field reports have indicated measles and
suspected diphtheria cases in the camp area (World Health
Organization, 2017a). In particular, one death from measles and
412 suspected measles cases were reported in November 2017,
with 82% of cases occurring in children under 5 years of age. With
the support of UNICEF and the WHO, the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare of Bangladesh launched a measles and rubella
vaccination campaign in September/October 2017 (United Nations
Children’s Fund, 2017a,b). Nearly 55% of children under 15 years of
age (n = 186 929) have been vaccinated (International Organization
for Migration, 2017b), but to achieve the >95% coverage required
for herd immunity, the vaccination campaign must be continued
and expanded. The constant population movement and lack of
official registration increase the complexity of the field vaccination
operations. Reports on the Rohingya people in Malaysia have
shown that despite the host government’s intention to vaccinate
the refugees, the vaccination rate in children under 5 years of age in
the refugee community is lower than that in the host community
(Mahmood et al., 2017).
Gynecological and obstetric care needs
A report published in 2017 stated that one in seven Rohingya
women in Northern Rakhine State had undergone at least one
unskilled abortion under unhygienic conditions (Mahmood et al.,
2017). Thus, the female asylum seekers may present with various
gynecological and obstetrics needs. Although data on sexual and
gender-based violence are not available, reports from other
displaced camp contexts (Krause, 2015; Iyakaremye & Mukagatare,
2016) have highlighted that gynecological and obstetric services
and the treatment and management of sexually transmitted
diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDs are essential to address the needs of
populations living in camp settlements.
Information needs
The lack of proper documentation of the Rohingya people in
their country of origin has rendered the arrangement of re-
settlement challenging (Mahmood et al., 2017). To reduce health
risks and other medical emergency and disaster vulnerabilities, the
medical response community could provide immunization cards
for children and a basic medical history summary to those who
have sought treatment during their stay in the temporary
settlements. Not only would these documents facilitate future
medical consultations, but they might also serve as valuable proof
of identity.
Conclusions
The situation of the Rohingya people in Bangladesh once again
reminds the medical community of the importance of health
emergency disaster risk management (H-EDRM) (Chan & Murray,
2017) in camp settings. Perpetual violence and context instability
have left the Rohingya population in a dire situation, and global
collaboration is urgently needed to reinforce and facilitate
negotiations between Myanmar and Bangladesh in order to
improve the fate and well-being of the Rohingya refugees.
Ultimately, it is not only about respecting life and preserving
dignity, but also to ensure the survival of 
this forgotten
population.
