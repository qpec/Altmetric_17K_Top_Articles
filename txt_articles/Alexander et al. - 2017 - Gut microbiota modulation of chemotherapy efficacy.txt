Abstract 
Evidence is growing that the gut microbiota modulates the host response to 
chemotherapeutic drugs, with three main clinical outcomes: facilitation of drug 
 efficacy; abrogation & compromise of anti-cancer effects, and mediation of 
toxicity. The implication is that gut microbiota are critical to the development of 
personalized cancer treatment strategies and, therefore, a greater insight into 
prokaryotic co-metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs is now required. This 
thinking is based on evidence from human, animal and in vitro studies and gut 
bacteria are intimately linked to the pharmacological effects of chemotherapies 
(5-fluorouracil, 
cyclophosphamide, 
irinotecan, 
oxaliplatin, 
gemcitabine, 
methotrexate) and novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-PD-L1 and 
anti-CLTA-4. The gut microbiota modulate these agents through key 
mechanisms, structured as the ‘TIMER’ mechanistic framework: namely 
Translocation, Immunomodulation, Metabolism, Enzymatic degradation, and 
Reduced diversity and ecological variation The gut microbiota can now, 
therefore, be targeted to improve efficacy and reduce the toxicity of current 
chemotherapy agents. In this Review, we outline the implications of 
pharmacomicrobiomics in cancer therapeutics and define how the microbiota 
might be modified in clinical practice to improve efficacy and reduce the toxic 
burden of these compounds.  
 
 Key points 
 Evidence is increasing that the gut microbiota modulate the actions of 
chemotherapeutic drugs used in cancer and other diseases 
 We propose the ‘TIMER’ mechanistic framework to explain how gut 
bacteria influence chemotherapy effects on the host: Translocation, 
Immunomodulation, Metabolism, Enzymatic degradation and Reduced 
diversity and ecological variation 
  A number of tools for manipulating the gut microbiota in this context, 
including dietary modifications, probiotics and synthetically engineered 
bacteria, are in development 
 The gut microbiota will be central to the future of personalized cancer 
treatment strategies

Introduction 
Cancer survival has dramatically increased in the past half century, driven by a 
deeper understanding of cancer biology, improved surgical outcomes and 
increasingly efficacious multimodal chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens 
1. Cytotoxic drugs continue to be the mainstay of medical treatment for most 
patients with advanced disease, yet they have an unpredictable treatment 
response and considerable treatment-related morbidity and mortality2. The next 
generation of personalized cancer therapies are now emerging3, which exploit 
advances in molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity4,5, tumour evolution, 
immunotherapy and vaccination. However, even targeted therapies, which 
 have revolutionized outcomes in cancers such as malignant melanoma, suffer 
from novel problems such as acquired resistance, idiosyncratic adverse effects 
and high costs6-8. 
 
Systems medicine science provides multiparametric, time-specific insights into 
complex biological pathogenic states9. A major contribution of systems biology 
to modern medicine has been the rediscovery of the importance of the gut 
microbiota to almost all aspects of human health10. The major focus however 
of ‘oncomicrobiome’ research to date has been on the microbiome’s role in the 
aetiology of cancer and cancer risk11. This focus is because the gut microbiota 
co-develops with the host and it sits at the interface of multiple anti-neoplastic 
and carcinogenic metabolic, immune and inflammatory pathways12. However, 
the gut microbiota also have a major role in defining the efficacy and toxicity of 
a broad range of drugs13,14. Drug metabolism by intestinal microorganisms has 
been well recognized since the 1960s15; for example, microbiota-driven drug 
metabolism is essential for the activation of certain azo prodrugs such as 
prontosil and neoprontosil, and can affect drug disposition16 and toxicity17. 
However, advances in high-throughput sequencing and other ‘–omics’ 
platforms, have led to the concept of ‘pharmacomicrobiomics’, and the 
importance of the gut microbiota for chemotherapeutic drug modulation and 
drug discovery is now increasingly recognized18. 
 
Despite this progress, we are still lacking a complete map of microbiome  –
host–drug interactions in cancer, and biological complexity remains a 
considerable obstacle to the development of these ‘precision’ therapies. For 
 example, the gut microbiota exert both direct and indirect effects on 
chemotherapy toxicity and efficacy through a large suite of chemical signalling 
cascades (figure 1); as a result it seems to exert its influence on almost all 
classes of chemotherapeutic agents and it achieves this on a moving playing 
field. Not only are the gut microbiota niche-specific and highly personalized, but 
their ecology is also dynamic. For example, the majority of cancers strike at 
extremes of age, in which the structural ecology of the gut might be immature 
or perturbed through exposure to a lifetime of environmental modifiers19. 
Moreover, pathological disease states or surgical and medical therapies might 
also create a state of dysbiosis, further exaggerating the influence of 
deleterious bacteria, reducing efficacy and exacerbating the toxicity of 
chemotherapy. A paradox also exists, as chemotherapeutics might further 
exacerbate any dysbiotic state rather than correct it, with potentially serious 
implications for drug toxicity. The gut microbiota must, therefore, have a critical 
role in the development of precision treatment strategies for cancer and they 
are increasingly seen as a target for next-generation cancer therapies.  
 
This Review describes the established mechanisms through which 
chemotherapy treatment efficacy is facilitated and abrogated by the gut 
microbiota, through what we have described as the ‘TIMER’ mechanistic 
framework — Translocation, Immunomodulation, Metabolism, Enzymatic 
degradation, and Reduced diversity (Table 1). We review evidence that 
commensals are implicated in oncological treatment-related toxicity and the 
role of ecological engineering in modulating chemotherapy efficacy. Finally, we 
discuss the implications of such discoveries on future treatment for patients with 
 cancer and outline how the gut microbiota could be modulated for developing 
precision strategies in the treatment of cancer. 
 
[H1] Translocation and immunomodulation  
Almost 1 in 10 patients with cancer will require a hospital visit for an infection 
during chemotherapy20. Translocation describes the process through which 
commensal or pathogenic bacteria pass across the gut barrier into the systemic 
milieu, where they can contribute to the morbidity of chemotherapy21. Although 
it was first described in the 1960s22, and risk factors for its presence were 
established, the microbial and host mechanisms that drive this event are not 
fully defined.  
 
However, studies have begun to question whether translocation modifies not 
only the risk of sepsis, but chemotherapeutic efficacy. Cyclophosphamide  
exerts its anti-neoplastic effects through a variety of immunological pathways23-
25. Viaud and colleagues conducted a series of experiments in mouse models, 
investigating 
the 
role 
of 
small 
intestinal 
commensal 
microbes 
in 
cyclophosphamide treatment26. Both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin cause 
shortening of intestinal villi, focal accumulation of inflammatory cells and 
discontinuity of the intestinal barrier, with accompanying translocation of 
commensal bacteria into secondary lymphoid organs in a mouse model. 
Although there was no reduction in the total bacterial counts in the small 
intestine at 7 days of treatment with cyclophosphamide, there was a reduction 
in the abundance of lactobacilli and enterococci. Furthermore, a specific set of 
Gram-positive bacteria (segmented filamentous bacteria and Lactobacillus 
 johnsonii, Lactobacillus murinus and Enterococcus hirae) was necessary to 
mediate cyclophosphamide-driven accumulation of type 17 T helper (TH17) and 
type 1 T helper (TH1)-cell responses, and long-term treatment with antibiotics 
reduced the capacity of cyclophosphamide  to cure P815 mastocytomas. Pre-
conditioning with vancomycin, which is an antibiotic active against Gram-
positive microorganisms, and to a lesser extent colistin (active against Gram-
negative 
microorganisms), 
inhibited 
the 
anti-cancer 
effects 
of 
cyclophosphamide in mice inoculated with MCA205 tumours. Indeed, a follow-
up study from the same group, in addition to validating the primacy of E. hirae 
in restoring cyclophosphamide-induced anti-tumour effects to microbiota-
depleted mice, also identified the colonic Gram-negative microorganism 
Barnesiella intestinihominis as an orchestrator of cyclophosphamide effects27. 
Interestingly, some of the actions of Barnesiella in this setting, increasing 
systemic polyfunctional Tc1 and TH1 cell responses and re-instating 
intratumoral IFN-�-producing �� tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were distinct 
from those mechanisms previously identified for other microbiota. 
 
Also using mouse models, Iida and co-workers provided further evidence that 
gut bacteria regulate the immune response to chemotherapy28. In mice treated 
with intra-tumoral CpG oligodeoxynucleotides they showed that the microbiota 
primes tumour-associated innate myeloid cells for inflammatory cytokine 
production and that antibiotic treatment or germ-free (sterile) status attenuates 
this response. Moreover, the ability to eradicate tumours and prolong survival 
in control mice was markedly reduced with antibiotic treatment, whereas germ-
free animals failed to respond. For the platinum-salt oxaliplatin, the antibiotic 
 effect manifested within 2 days of treatment, implying that the effect in this case 
was due to direct suppression of early cytotoxicity, rather than as a result of 
later cell death and subsequent immune responses.  
 
The importance of gut microbial facilitation of immune responses in cancer 
treatment extends to novel targeted immunotherapies, such as synthetic 
monoclonal antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 
(CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1). MCA205 
sarcoma progression is controlled by CTLA-4-specific antibodies in specific 
pathogen-free mice, but not in germ-free mice or those treated with broad-
spectrum antibiotics29. In the latter groups, there was a decrease in activation 
of splenic effector CD4+ T cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Clinical 
response to anti-PD-L1, which acts on programmed cell death protein ligand 1, 
is more frequent in patients who show evidence of T-cell response in the tumour 
microenvironment30. This phenomenon was explored by studying melanoma 
growth in genetically similar mice from different facilities (JAX and TAC), which 
differ in the composition of their gut bacteria31. Tumours grew more 
aggressively in TAC mice than JAX mice, but differences in tumour growth and 
immune responses were ablated by co-housing. Transfer of faecal material 
from JAX to TAC mice delayed tumour growth and enhanced immune 
responses in the latter; corresponding transfer in the opposite direction had no 
effect on JAX mice. Furthermore, combination of JAX microbiota and anti-PD-
L1 monoclonal antibody improved tumour control more than individual 
treatment with either in isolation. Furthermore, 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
sequencing demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp. showed the largest 
 increase in relative abundance in JAX -fed TAC mice, and also exhibited the 
strongest association with anti-tumour T-cell responses. Finally, mice treated 
with a Bifidobacterium commercial cocktail markedly improved tumour control, 
with induction of tumour specific T cells and increased T cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. This effect was abrogated by depletion of CD8+ T cells and 
by heat inactivation of bacteria. The absence of bacteria in secondary lymphoid 
organs suggests that systemic immunological effects occurred independently 
of bacterial translocation. Instead, the authors concluded that Bifidobacterium-
derived signals are mediated through dendritic cell activation, as they 
demonstrated using genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional in vitro 
experiments. 
 
CTLA-4 blockade-induced colitis, an unwelcome phenomenon resulting from 
mucosal immune dysregulation, is seen in approximately one-third of patients 
receiving ipilimumab treatment against metastatic melanoma7,32. Dubin and co-
workers have demonstrated that over-representation of the Bacteroidetes 
phylum correlates with resistance to this particular form of colitis, and that a 
lack of genetic pathways involved in polyamine transport and B vitamin 
synthesis is associated with increased risk of this type of colitis33. In line with 
these findings, a cocktail of Bacteroidales and Burkholderiales ameliorates 
CTLA-4-blockade-induced subclinical colitis and colon inflammatory scores in 
antibiotic-treated mice.29 
 
Evidence is also emerging that the interface of innate immunity and the 
microbiota mediates chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 
 are targets for commensal bacteria, and evidence from IBD models suggests 
this interaction acts to regulate inflammation and aids healing in the healthy 
colon34,35. Frank and colleagues showed that mice depleted in gut microbes 
after treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics were more susceptible to 
methotrexate-induced small intestinal injury, but this effect was rescued by 
administration of a TLR2 ligand36. Further experiments pointed to myeloid-cell-
expressed transmembrane p-glycoprotein (p-gp) as critical in this pathway. The 
findings were validated in vitro using human duodenal epithelial tissue. 
Conversely, knockout of Tlr4 in mice is associated with improvement in 
symptoms of toxicity from irinotecan (CPT-11, a topoisomerase I poison), 
despite modestly elevated levels of Proteobacteria, which express β-
glucuronidases and, therefore, might increase reactivation of SN-38 (the active 
metabolite of irinotecan)37. 
 
[H1] Microbial enzymatic degradation and metabolism  
Gastrointestinal toxicity in the form of mucositis, causing diarrhoea, pain and 
weight loss, is a common adverse effect of chemotherapy, resulting in morbidity 
and mortality38. Moreover, it often leads to dose-limitation, which reduces the 
efficacy of anti-cancer treatment. In addition to the multiple host 
proinflammatory and apoptotic pathways activated by chemotherapy, the gut 
microbiota are central to the pathogenesis of mucositis39 and we draw readers’ 
attention to an excellent systematic review on this topic by Touchfeu and 
colleagues40. However, there remains a paucity of effective interventions to 
prevent gastrointestinal toxicity or mitigate against its symptoms41.  
 
 Irinotecan causes severe diarrhoea in up to 40% of patients, requiring dose 
reduction and, in many cases, premature termination of the drug42. The effect 
of CPT-11 on the intestinal microbiota composition has been explored in rats43. 
CPT-11 increased caecal Clostridium cluster XI and Enterobacteriaceae, both 
of which are potentially pathogenic. However, subsequent analysis of the 
beneficial effects of dietary fibres in this context suggests that dysbiotic 
changes might not be a major cause of CPT-11 toxicity, pointing instead to the 
importance of microbial production of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) 
butyrate, which correlates with genetic and phenotypic markers of host health17. 
The implication is that functional, rather than compositional, changes of the 
microbiota are of greater significance. 
 
Irinotecan’s active metabolite, SN-38, is converted in the liver to an inactive 
glucuronide (SN-38G), which is excreted into the gut via the bile44. Wallace and 
colleagues showed that bacterial β-glucuronidases cleave the glucuronide 
moiety for use as a carbon source, releasing the active SN-38 metabolite into 
the bowel lumen, generating diarrhoea45. Bacterial β-glucuronidases (or 
possible candidate structures) are found in 43% of species in The Human 
Microbiome database (http://hmpdacc.org/). Furthermore, the bacterial enzyme 
contains a ‘bacterial loop’ not found in the human form of the enzyme, enabling 
highly selective inhibitors of the bacterial enzyme to be developed, two of which 
blocked the active site of the E. coli β-glucuronidase, but had no effect on 
bovine liver glucuronidase. The quinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin has also been 
shown to inhibit this enzyme, and low doses of amoxapine, a known inhibitor of 
bacterial β-glucuronidases, suppressed diarrhoea associated with irinotecan in 
 a rat model46,47. An analysis of crystal structures of representative β-
glucuronidases from Streptococcus agalactiae and Clostridium perfringens and 
the Proteobacteria Escherichia coli and the Bacteroidetes Bacteroides fragilis 
has demonstrated that these enzymes have marked differences in catalytic 
properties and propensities for inhibition, suggesting that the gut microbiome is 
able to ensure functional diversity in orthologous enzymes. Small changes in 
the structure of designed inhibitors can induce major conformational changes 
in the β-glucuronidase active site48. An alternative strategy to reduce irinotecan-
related 
gastrointestinal 
toxicity 
which, 
in 
contrast, 
requires 
active 
biotransformation via bacterial β-glucuronidase to exert its restorative effect on 
the intestinal epithelium, is provided by a Chinese herbal medicine (PHY906), 
which achieves this step through regeneration of stem cells and potentiation of 
Wnt signalling49. 
 
An interesting microbiome -driven drug–drug interaction, with potentially 
serious consequences, including death, has also been seen with the antiviral 
drug 
sorivudine 
(1-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-(E)-(2-bromovinyl) 
uracil) 
an 
antiviral that was sometimes co-administered with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 
Biotransformation of sorivudine by gut bacterial phosphorolytic enzymes to (E)-
5-(2-bromovinyl) uracil (BVU) occurs (with high hydrolytic activity seen with the 
Bacteroides species, B. vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, B. uniformis 
and B. eggerthii). The effect of the microflora was demonstrated by the fact that 
administration of ampicillin, metronidazole, or a cocktail of bacitracin, neomycin 
and streptomycin, reduced the exposure of rats to circulating BVU whilst 
concentrations were increased after administration of the antibiotic kanamycin 
 (which is selective for aerobes over anaerobes). BVU inactivates hepatic 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is responsible for the 
detoxication of 5-FU. The coadministration of sorivudine and 5-FU (or prodrugs 
thereof) in the presence of an active gut microflora capable of producing BVU 
produces an increase in systemic concentrations of 5-FU, and this combination 
was associated with the death of 16 patients in Japan as a consequence50,51. 
 
The enzymatic functions of specific target bacteria also have a key role in 
modifying the toxic profile of some chemotherapeutics. For example, 
Mycoplasma hyorhinis has been associated with a range of different cancers, 
including gastric carcinoma52. This bacterium encodes a thymidine 
phosphorylase that markedly restricts the cytostatic activity of pyrimidine 
nucleoside analogue compounds such as 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine and 5-
trifluorothymidine in vitro53. However, the opposite is true for the capecitabine 
metabolite 5-fluoro-5’-deoxyuridine, which is more effective in the presence of 
M. hyorhinis infection, as this pro-drug is activated by the same enzyme. For 
the 
cancer 
drug 
gemcitabine, 
Mycoplasma 
pyrimidine 
nucleoside 
phosphorylase and cytidine deaminase enzymes have deleterious effects on 
its therapeutic efficacy54. This example illustrates a major challenge for the 
design of more personalized chemotherapeutic strategies based on microbiota 
modulation, as the same strain has two contrasting influences on two different 
targets based on the same enzyme.  
 
[H1] Reduced diversity and ecological variation 
 Our understanding of novel interactions determining the effects of the 
microbiota on chemotherapeutics must be further developed to account for 
reciprocal modification of the microbiota by these agents. Data from a study in 
rats treated with methotrexate showed that animals that developed mucositis 
also demonstrated a global reduction in microbial abundance, with an absolute 
and relative decrease of anaerobes (13-fold) and streptococci (296-fold) with 
relative increase of Bacteroides, and that this change in microbiota composition 
was associated with diarrhoea and reduced villous length55. The structure of the 
human gut microbiota after treatment with chemotherapy is also characterized 
by reductions in diversity and richness 56,57. Importantly, attempts are now being 
made to understand the functional effects of chemotherapy on the gut 
microbiota. Studying 28 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing a 5-
day myeloablative chemotherapy regimen prior to human stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), all of whom developed gastrointestinal-mucositis-
related symptoms, Montassier and co-workers saw profound alterations in gut 
microbial community structure and reduction in diversity58. Proteobacteria 
abundance was increased, with levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria 
decreased. Taxa known to diminish inflammation by modulation of the NF-B 
pathway and through production of SCFAs were depleted after chemotherapy. 
Enterobacteriaciae abundance increased following chemotherapy, showing 
similarities to the changes observed in an active colitis model59. Metabolic 
pathways associated with intestinal inflammation, including cell motility, glycan 
metabolism and xenobiotic degradation, were negatively correlated with 
Firmicutes58. 
 
 [H1] ‘Pharmacomicrobiomics’ and cancer therapy  
The concept that bacteria or their products have a therapeutic part to play in 
cancer is not novel. In 1891, Coley used the toxins from Streptococcus 
erysipelas and Bacillus prodigiosus to treat sarcoma60, and mycobacteria are 
still used in the treatment of bladder cancer61. Bacteria exert their 
chemotherapeutic effect by competing for nutrients, secreting toxins and 
eliciting host immune responses. However, we are now entering a new age in 
which the entire ecology of the gut could be targeted to influence therapeutic 
efficacy. But, for this vision to be delivered in practice, several critical unmet 
needs must be overcome (figure 2).  
 
[H2] Phenome trials and systems oncology  
Phenome: the sum of all phenotypes expressed by an organism. Phenomics is 
the study of the interaction of genes and the environment.  
The complexity of the gut microbiome means that novel approaches for 
studying its role in drug efficacy are required. This complexity necessitates a 
detailed functional map of the vast number of metabolic and immune functions 
that these bacteria exert on the host, cancer and the drugs used to treat it. 
Moreover, it is clear that many cancer therapies will not only influence the 
metabolism of the host, but also that of the gut bacteria themselves, and the 
unintended consequences of this function remain unknown. This influence is 
critical as modern chemotherapeutic regimens are commonly multimodal and 
the potential for unintended harm to be caused to patients through this route is 
substantial. Longitudinal drug studies that target host–microbiota interactions 
using a suite of metabonomic, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic 
 approaches are required to provide meaningful insights into the mechanisms of 
the microbiome, to identify novel drug targets and to reduce their lead times 
into clinical use.62  
 
[H2] Gut microbiota as a biomarker for outcomes 
Personalized biomarkers are urgently required to help clinicians identify 
dysbiotic states associated with poor or deleterious outcomes from 
chemotherapy, and to identify microbial targets suitable for modification. This 
aim is a major challenge, as these biomarkers must account not only for inter-
individual variation, but also variation in the expression of bacteria according to 
tumour stage and phenotype. For example, the mucosal expression of strains 
of Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with advanced stage and poor 
outcome in patients with colorectal cancer63. The challenge is further 
exacerbated by system complexity and co-dependent functions of microbial 
networks and the very large portfolio of enzymatic functions carried by multiple 
different species, exemplified by the glucuronidase family.  
 
However, evidence does suggest that the gut microbiota could act as a 
predictor of patient response to treatment and that this approach is feasible. 
Montassier and colleagues found that a diverse gut microbiota is associated 
with protection against chemotherapy-related bloodstream infection64. 
Interestingly, decreases in diversity preceded the start of treatment and the 
authors suggest a microbiota-based predictive risk index model, which might 
be used to stratify patients at risk of complications prior to treatment. 
Correspondingly, Galloway-Pena et al. found that microbial diversity at baseline 
 was markedly lower in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia who developed 
infectious complications of induction chemotherapy than those who did not65. 
Furthermore, a deleterious prognostic impact of reduced microbial diversity 
over the course of treatment was sustained – patients in this category were 
more likely to suffer an infection within 90 days after their neutrophil levels had 
recovered. 
 
[H1] Optimizing chemotherapy via microbiota  
Current tools designed to modify the gut microbiota remain fairly blunt, and 
almost all have been aimed at reducing the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents 
rather than improving their efficacy.  
 
[H2] Dietary interventions  
Much work has been done to determine the influence of dietary–microbiota 
interactions on human health in IBD, obesity and in cancer aetiology12. For 
example, pro-inflammatory diets high in fat and protein exert their carcinogenic 
effect through upregulated metabolism of choline, branched-chain amino acids 
and bile salts and a reduction in SCFA metabolism66. Although diet (for 
example, one high in fibre and low in protein and fat) can be an effective method 
of chemoprevention for colorectal cancer, its role in the modification of 
chemotherapeutic efficacy remains poorly understood. This lack of knowledge 
is in part because the analysis of dietary modification of the gut microbiota 
during cancer remains challenging, not only because of variability in the 
adverse effects of chemotherapy (such as nausea and appetite suppression), 
but also because of nutritional interventions (for example, enteral nutrition) and 
 surgical diversion (stoma formation). However, animal data is emerging, and 
mice fed a diet high in protein, L-leucine, fish oil, and specific oligosaccharides 
demonstrated a reduced incidence and severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
translocation during cyclophosphamide-induced immune suppression when 
compared with an isoenergetic control diet67. 
 
Nutritional modulation of cancer metabolism is also an emerging therapeutic 
approach, with fasting68,69, carbohydrate restriction70, amino acid restriction (L-
asparaginase71, methionine72, serine73, tyrosine and phenylalanine74) and 
ketogenic diets75 under investigation. Some evidence suggests that fasting 
might also minimize the adverse effects of some chemotherapies; for example, 
it has been shown to reduce the vomiting associated with doxorubicin treatment 
in dogs76. Although these approaches have yet to be extensively studied as 
diet–microbiota–chemotherapy interactions in cancer, data from human obesity 
and dietary studies clearly shows that the microbiota has a critical role in the 
modulation of cellular metabolism and the disease phenotype through both 
direct and indirect (for example SCFA, branched-chain amino acid metabolism 
and bile acids). It is almost certain, therefore, that the microbiota are modified 
by diet and that an altered oral intake during cancer treatment, in turn, is a 
critical mediator of chemotherapy efficacy. Intriguing evidence from 
experiments in FabplCre;Apc(15lox/+) mice treated with irinotecan support this 
hypothesis. Animals fasted for 3 days were protected from the adverse effects 
of irinotecan, although its efficacy was maintained77. Although the influence of 
the microbiota was not studied in this cohort, it is highly likely that it had a major 
role, and more research is required.  
  
Specific food supplements have also been shown to be modifiers of microbiota-
driven chemotherapy toxicity. Ginseng is a popular herbal medicine that is 
thought to have anti-neoplastic therapeutic potential78. The protopanaxadiol 
group of ginsenosides are metabolised via the enteric microbiota from 
compound K79.  In vitro studies suggest an enhanced effect of 5-FU against 
colorectal cancer cell lines in the presence of ginseng compounds80,81. 
Moreover, protopanaxadiol promotes the anti-neoplastic effects of 5-FU in a 
cell line model, providing further evidence that the microbial metabolism of 
nutritional constituents modifies the efficacy of chemotherapeutic targets. 
 
Ellagic acid, a product of dietary polyphenols found in certain fruits, walnuts and 
wines, is metabolised by the gut microbiota to release urolithins82. Urolithin A is 
purported to have anti-proliferative effects in human colon cancer cells, 
mediating cell cycle arrest83, and co-treatment in vitro with urolithin A 
potentiates the effects of 5-FU and its pro-drug intermediate 5’DFUR84. 
Polysaccharides from the ink of a squid Ommastrephes bartrami also altered 
the intestinal microbiota composition after cyclophosphamide administration in 
mice85. Specifically, it resulted in the enrichment of bifidobacteria and a 
reduction in the levels of Bacteroidetes, further suggesting that nutritional 
modulation of the microbiota during cancer therapy might protect against the 
adverse effects of chemotherapy. 
 
[H2] Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics  
Good evidence in both animal and human studies support that probiotics, 
prebiotics and synbiotics have a role in the prevention of mucositis during 
 chemotherapy, and that they rarely cause sepsis86. Bowen and colleagues 
found that VSL#3, which contains a mixture of Streptococcus thermophiles, 
Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, B. infantis, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. 
delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus, L. acidophilus and L. plantarum, reduced 
diarrhoea and weight loss in irinotecan-treated rats, with associated increased 
intestinal crypt proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis87. L. fermentum, L. 
rhamnosus and B. lactis did not protect against intestinal mucositis in mice 
delivered intraperitoneal 5-FU88.  
 
L. casei, L. rhamnosus and B. bifidum, have all demonstrated that they can 
attenuate chemotherapy associated diarrhoea in a mouse model through the 
inhibition of TNF, IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA expression89. In a randomized study of 
150 patients with colorectal cancer receiving 5-FU-based chemotherapy, L. 
rhamnosus GG supplementation also reduced episodes of severe diarrhoea 
and abdominal discomfort, compared with guar gum fibre90. Motoori and co-
workers performed a randomized study comparing a synbiotic containing 1x108 
living B. breve strain Yakult and 1x108 L. casei strain Shirota per gramme with 
a control substance containing 1x109 Streptococcus faecalis during 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment for patients with oesophageal cancer91. 
Levels of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species decreased in the control 
group compared with the treatment group after chemotherapy, and 
concentrations of SCFAs were higher in the latter. Modest improvements in 
rates of severe diarrhoea and febrile neutropenia were observed in the 
treatment group, but the majority of clinical parameters, including response to 
 chemotherapy, showed no difference between groups. The primary endpoint of 
the study was not stated. 
 
A small placebo-controlled trial of B. breve strain Yakult in children undergoing 
chemotherapy for a variety of malignancies also demonstrated that the 
treatment group experienced fewer episodes of fever and the frequency of 
intravenous antibiotic use was reduced compared with controls92. This finding 
implies that there are multiple probiotic targets with applications in this field; 
however, there is an unmet need for improved methods for treatment 
stratification as not all studies have demonstrated clinical benefit. For example, 
a combination of Enterococcus faecium M-74 with selenium did not prevent 
episodes of febrile neutropenia in patients with leukaemia receiving induction 
or consolidation chemotherapy93.  
 
The use of prebiotics in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs (5-FU, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cytarabine) has been studied 
in mice94. Dietary supplementation with both oligofructose and inulin 
potentiated the effect of all six drugs, increasing the life span of animals with 
the intraperitoneal form of a transplantable liver tumour95. Continuing this 
theme, an inulin–doxorubicin conjugate maintains therapeutic response in vitro 
at lower doses than doxorubicin alone96.  
 
[H2] Antibiotics, ecology and synthetic engineering  
Antibiotic therapy is broadly used as a prophylactic approach for preventing 
sepsis during chemotherapy. However, almost 27% of bacteria causing 
 infections during chemotherapy in the USA are resistant to standard 
prophylactic antibiotics20 and the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in cancer and 
especially during neutropenia is arguable. Importantly, antibiotic use in these 
immunocompromised patients is also an unwanted cause of diarrhoea through 
the potentiation of Clostridium difficile97. Conversely, to date, no trials have 
examined whether antibiotics might preferentially improve chemotherapy 
efficacy, and such approaches have largely been used as a method for 
experimental modulation of microbiota–host drug interactions26,29. However, 
there are two interesting concepts that arise from the clinical use of antibiotics 
in cancer. Firstly, as it is possible that given bacteria might transmit antibiotic 
resistance through horizontal gene transfer98, it is equally possible that 
chemotherapeutic resistance might be transmitted in a similar fashion, for 
example, through the transfer of β-glucuronidase or pyrimidine phosphatase 
functions. Bacteria modify chemoresistance through a large number of possible 
pathways, such as through lipopolysaccharide-modulated upregulation TLR4 
receptors99 and, therefore, this finding suggests that the microbiota is a 
legitimate target for the treatment of patients with metastatic disease. Secondly, 
it also suggests that there is a role for selective antibiotic use, and that retired 
compounds can be repurposed for engineering the microbiota. The precedent 
has been set with amoxapine, a tetracyclic antidepressant, which was re-
purposed 
as 
a 
selective 
β-glucuronidase 
inhibitor 
for 
alleviating 
chemotoxicity47. 
 
A different approach for manipulation of the microbiota is to take advantage of 
ecological engineering, which is the synthetic manipulation of ecology and 
 ecosystems to deliver a desired change or function. One such drastic method 
for modification of the ecology of microbiota is faecal microbiota 
transplantation100. This approach has yet to be used for this purpose, although 
it is probably only a matter of time as data from C. difficile studies suggest they 
have a potentially valuable role101. A note of caution arises from disappointing 
phase II trial results of Seres’s stool-derived bacterial spore treatment to 
prevent recurrent C. difficile infection.102 Moreover, challenges remain in 
regulation103, and extra care will be needed in the oncological setting, for which 
the consequences for cancer survival of re-setting the microbiota during 
treatment are not known.  
 
Another approach is the engineering of target bacteria to deliver drugs or pro-
drugs within target organs and to serve as vectors for gene therapy. The 
production of the tumour suppressor, bone morphogenetic protein 2 by 
transgenic bacteria is one such example104. Spores of anaerobic bacteria can 
also be used for this purpose as they will reach oxygen-depleted regions within 
cancers and will germinate. Din and colleagues demonstrated an elegant 
example of how synthetic engineering of bacteria can be used to improve the 
efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs105. They engineered a synchronized lysis 
circuit based on the quorum sensing feedback loops in E. coli, so that the 
bacteria would lyse at a threshold population density to release genetically 
encoded cargo. After quorum lysis, a small number of surviving bacteria reseed 
the growing population, therefore, leading to pulsatile delivery cycles. When the 
lysis strain, alone or in combination with 5-FU, was orally administered to a 
syngeneic mouse transplantation model of hepatic colorectal metastases, 
 tumour activity was markedly reduced and a survival benefit was obtained. This 
example shows that synthetic engineering now has a major role in the 
optimization of standard chemotherapeutic approaches in cancer.  
 
[H1] Conclusions 
Mechanistic evidence is now available to support the hypothesis that the gut 
microbiota plays a major part in defining both the efficacy and toxicity of 
chemotherapeutic agents. Biological complexity remains a major barrier to the 
full elucidation of the multiple pathways through which host–microbial 
interactions modulate clinical outcomes; however, systems medicine provides 
a tangible methodology for mapping these host oncological–microbiota 
interactions. The implication is that the gut microbiome represents a notable 
target for making chemotherapy safer and for further improving rates of cancer 
survival. Clinicians and translational scientists are likely to make a major 
contribution to this work and will be integral to delivering future trials that are 
essential if the potential of the gut microbiota in this field is to be realized. 
 
  
 
Figure 1. An overview of the TIMER microbiota–host interactions that modulate 
chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity. Chemotherapeutics can exert their 
influence through multiple pathways, and these are outlined here. 
Translocation: cyclophosphamide can cause shortening of the intestinal villi 
and damage to the mucosal barrier, permitting commensals to cross the 
intestinal barrier and enter secondary lymphoid organs. Immunomodulation: 
 intestinal microbiota facilitate a plethora of chemotherapy-induced immune and 
inflammatory responses. For example, Lactobacillus, segmented filamentous 
bacteria mediate the accumulation of type 17 T helper (TH17) and type 1 T 
helper (TH1)-cell response26. Bifidobacteria also modify tumour-specific T-cell 
induction and increase T cells in the tumour micro-environment in patients 
treated with anti-PD-L1 immunomodulator. Metabolism and Enzymatic 
Degradation: Direct and indirect bacterial modification of pharmaceuticals may 
potentiate desirable effects, abrogate efficacy or liberate toxic compounds. The 
microbiota harbour a large suite of indirect metabolic processes (such as 
reduction, hydrolysis, dehydroxylation, dealkylation etc.) which may be used for 
drug metabolism. These secondary metabolites are secreted into the circulation 
and excreted by the kidney, which may in turn cause toxicity. E.coli possess a 
beta-glucuronidase which cleaves glucuronide from the inactive metabolite of 
CPT-11 (irinotecan), releasing active metabolite (SN-38) in the gut causing 
diarrhoea. Reduced diversity: Chemotherapy induces changes in the diversity 
of the mucosal and faecal microbiota through altered biliary excretion and 
secondary metabolism or associated antibiotic use and dietary modifications. 
As a result, pathobionts may predominate, leading to deleterious effects such 
as diarrhoea and colitis. PRR, pattern recognition receptor; TAMC, tumour-
associated myeloid cell; TLR, Toll-like receptor; Treg cell, regulatory T cell. 
 
Figure 2. A model for the future analysis and translation of the oncomicrobiome 
for improved cancer outcomes. The microbiota is highly personalized and niche 
specific. However, its structure and function is dynamic and it is influenced by 
all interventions along the modern multimodal treatment journey. The cancer 
 patient journey is subject to substantial inter-individual and intra-individual 
variation; for example, not all patients will undergo surgery. However, sampling 
methodologies can be standardized, and future microbiome studies should 
seek to sample not only faeces, but tissue and multiple biofluids so that the 
broad systemic array of microbiome functions can be analysed once stored in 
biobanks. Metataxonomic (16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing) and 
metagenomics (shotgun sequencing) approaches and other ‘–omics’-based 
technologies (such as metabonomics and proteomics) are providing notable 
insights into the mechanisms through which the microbiome modifies 
chemotherapy toxicity and efficacy. Given that treatment-induced dysbiosis 
probably affects the efficacy of second and third-line therapies, longitudinal 
studies will be critical in fully elucidating the role of the microbiome in this field, 
and microbiota-augmented clinical trials in oncology are now urgently required. 
There are multiple tools through which the microbiota might be modulated for 
improved clinical outcomes, which could be deployed at all stages of the 
treatment journey. However, evidence to support their use is variable, and trials 
for more controversial interventions such as faecal microbiome transplantation 
(FMT) are ongoing. However, the microbiota serves as a rich resource for 
answering many of the unmet clinical needs in oncology and it represents a 
major new avenue in drug discovery in cancer.
