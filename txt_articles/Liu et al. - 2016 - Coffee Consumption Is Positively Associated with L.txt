Abstract
Background: Coffee is an important source of antioxidants, and consumption of this beverage is associated with
many health conditions and a lower mortality risk. However, no study, to our knowledge, has examined whether
varying coffee or caffeine consumption levels are associated with telomere length, a biomarker of aging whose
shortening can be accelerated by oxidative stress.
Objective: We performed a large comprehensive study on how coffee consumption is associated with telomere length.
Methods: We used data from the Nurses� Health Study (NHS), a prospective cohort study of female nurses that began in
1976. We examined the cross-sectional association between coffee consumption and telomere length in 4780 women
from the NHS. Coffee consumption information was obtained from validated food-frequency questionnaires, and relative
telomere length was measured in peripheral blood leukocytes by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain ORs when the telomere length outcome was dichotomized at the
median. Linear regression was used for tests of trend with coffee consumption and telomere length as continuous
variables.
Results: Higher total coffee consumption was significantly associated with longer telomeres after potential confounding
adjustment. Compared with non-coffee drinkers, multivariable ORs for those drinking 2 to <3 and $3 cups of coffee/d
were, respectively, 1.29 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.68) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.78) (P-trend = 0.02). We found a significant linear
association between caffeine consumption from all dietary sources and telomere length (P-trend = 0.02) after adjusting for
potential confounders, but not after additionally adjusting for total coffee consumption (P-trend = 0.37).
Conclusions: We found that higher coffee consumption is associated with longer telomeres among female nurses.
Future studies are needed to better understand the influence of coffee consumption on telomeres, which may uncover
new knowledge of how coffee consumption affects health and longevity.

Introduction
Coffee consumption is associated with many health conditions
and lower mortality risk (1–4). Coffee contains many antioxidants,
including caffeine, chlorogenic acid, diterpenes, melanoidins, and
polyphenols. In populations that regularly consume coffee,
coffee is a major source of antioxidant intake and constitutes a
high percentage of dietary total antioxidant capacity (5, 6).
Studies have shown that coffee and its component compounds
can protect against DNA damage (7–19). Although caffeine has
antioxidant properties (19), it can also act as a pro-oxidant (19)
and inhibit DNA repair (20, 21) and can shorten telomeres in yeast
(22). Few studies, to our knowledge, have examined the associ-
ation between coffee consumption and telomere length (23, 24).
Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences that protect the
ends of linear chromosomes from chromosomal fusion and loss
of critical genetic information during DNA replication (25).
Telomeres shorten in somatic cells from each round of cell
division because DNA polymerases are not able to fully replicate
linear chromosomes, which is also known as the end-replication
problem (26). Although somatic cell telomeres shorten with age

 because of the end-replication problem, oxidative stress accel-
erates their shortening (27, 28). Shorter telomeres have been
associated with lower life expectancy and higher risks of age-
related chronic diseases (29–33). Because coffee consumption can
reduce oxidative stress and affect DNA integrity, it is plausible
that coffee consumption may be associated with telomere length.
Previous studies on coffee consumption and telomere length
have provided inconsistent findings (23, 24). An intervention study
of 40 chronic hepatitis C patients found that coffee consumption
resulted in significantly longer telomeres (23). However, a cross-
sectional study of 840 predominantly black and Hispanic
participants found no significant association between coffee
consumption and telomere length (24). These studies did not
examine whether decaffeinated coffee consumption or varying
coffee consumption levels were associated with telomere length.
We present here our findings from the largest study, to our
knowledge, to date on coffee consumption and telomere
length, involving 4780 participants of the Nurses� Health
Study (NHS). We used validated FFQs to capture the partic-
ipants� coffee and caffeine consumption levels before they
provided blood samples that were used for relative peripheral
blood leukocyte telomere length measurements. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first study to examine telomere length associ-
ations with decaffeinated coffee consumption or varying coffee
consumption levels and also the first to examine the association
between caffeine consumption from all dietary sources and
telomere length in humans.
Methods
Study population. The NHS is a prospective cohort study that began in
1976, when 121,700 female registered nurses aged 30–55 who were
residing in 11 US states completed an initial questionnaire. Personal
information, such as lifestyle and dietary factors, was subsequently updated
every 2–4 y through questionnaire responses. From 1989 to 1990, blood
was collected from 32,826 participants. Of these blood samples, 97%
arrived within 26 h of being drawn and were centrifuged and aliquoted into
plasma, white blood cell, and red blood cell components. The cryotubes
containing the aliquoted samples were stored in liquid nitrogen freezers.
The analysis population consists of 4780 participants with coffee
consumption information from FFQs and telomere length measure-
ments. These participants were controls from nested case-control studies
in the NHS (34–39). All of the case-control studies matched cases and
controls by age or birth year. However, each of the case-control studies
had somewhat different matching schemes, so we performed a sensitivity
analysis, which additionally adjusted for the identifier of the case-control
studies as an indicator variable in the multivariable model. We found that
the adjustment minimally changed the effect estimates, so we did not
include the case-control study identifier variable in the final multivariable
models. This analysis was restricted to Caucasians, who are the predom-
inant majority of the NHS participants. The NHS protocol was approved
by Brigham and Women�s Hospital�s Human Research Committee.
Telomere length. Relative telomere length in genomic DNA extracted
from peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by use of quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the ratio of telomere repeat copy
number to a single gene copy number (T:S) was determined as previously
described (40). Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and the relative
telomere length was the exponentiated T:S corrected for a reference
sample. The coefficients of variation were below 4% for the telomere and
single-gene assays and below 18% for the exponentiated T:S. In the
Nurses� Health Study, the 3- and 10-y intraclass correlations for reliability
were determined to be 0.80 and 0.60. Although this assay provides a
relative measurement of telomere length, ratios of telomere repeat copy
number to a single gene copy number highly correlate with absolute
telomere lengths determined by Southern blot (r = 0.68; P < 0.001) (40).
Questionnaire information. Coffee and caffeine consumption levels
were obtained from the FFQ administered in 1990. For coffee consump-
tion, categories of 0, <1, 1 to <2, 2 to <3, and $3 cups/d were chosen
because of sample size consideration and because these are the likely
consumption levels for an average person. For caffeine consumption from
all dietary sources, we categorized its continuous measurement in mg/d
into quartiles, because we are not aware of an established threshold of
caffeine consumption level in which caffeine exerts biological effects on
DNA in humans. Questionnaire information for potential confounders
was also obtained from the 1990 questionnaire, except for physical
activity level, which was obtained from the 1988 questionnaire. Smoking
amount was indicated by pack-y. Alcohol consumption level was
quantified by g/d, in which 14 g alcohol equals 1 drink. Physical activity
level was indicated by metabolic equivalent task-h/wk. The Alternate
Mediterranean Diet score was derived from the following 9 dietary
components: vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits, nuts, whole grains,
legumes, fishes, monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio, red and
processed meats, and alcohol. The score ranges from 0 to 9, and a higher
score represents greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (41, 42).
Statistical analysis. We performed a cross-sectional analysis examining
how coffee and caffeine consumption were associated with telomere
length. The extreme studentized deviate many-outlier procedure was
used to exclude outlier telomere length values (43), and z scores were
derived to standardize the distribution of telomere length values across

to obtain ORs when the z score outcome was dichotomized at the
median. The linear regression was used for tests of trend with coffee and
caffeine consumption and z score as continuous variables. Potential
confounders that were adjusted include age (<50, 50–54.9, 55–59.9, 60–
64.9, and $65 y), smoking (0, 0.1–20, 20.1–40, and >40 pack-y),

sured in kg/m2; <25, 25–29.9, 30–34.9, and $35), physical activity
(nominal quartiles, metabolic equivalent task-h/wk), trans fat con-
sumption (continuous, g/d), and Alternate Mediterranean Diet score
(continuous). Analyses of caffeinated coffee consumption were ad-
justed for decaffeinated coffee consumption and vice versa. The SAS
version 9.3 software (SAS Institute) was used for the analyses.
Quartiles were created by use of the SAS rank procedure. All P values
were 2-sided, and the a level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical
significance.
Results
Table 1 presents the age-standardized characteristics of the study
population by different coffee consumption levels. Women who
drank more coffee had significantly more smoking pack-y (P <
0.0001), higher alcohol consumption (P < 0.0001), higher trans
fat consumption (P < 0.0001), higher Alternate Mediterranean
Diet Score (P = 0.046), and lower BMI (P = 0.009) (Table 1).
Total coffee consumption was not significantly associated with
age or physical activity level (Table 1).
Table 2 shows the age-standardized characteristics by quar-
tiles of telomere length. As expected, older age was significantly
associated with shorter telomeres (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). Women
with shorter telomeres had significantly more smoking pack-y
(P = 0.0017) higher trans fat consumption (P = 0.027), and higher
Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (P = 0.042) (Table 2). Telomere
length was not significantly associated with BMI, physical activity,
or alcohol consumption (Table 2).
We examined the categorical and linear associations between
total coffee consumption and telomere length, after adjusting
for the covariates age, smoking, BMI, physical activity, alcohol
consumption, trans fat consumption, and Alternate Mediterra-
nean Diet Score (Table 3). Compared with non-coffee drinkers,
those who drank 2 to <3 and $3 cups of coffee/d, respectively, had
1.29 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.68) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.78) times the
odds of having above-median telomere length (P-trend = 0.02).
We further compared the categorical and linear associations
with telomere length for caffeinated coffee and decaffeinated
coffee consumption (Table 4). We found a significant linear as-
sociation with longer telomeres for higher caffeinated coffee
consumption after adjusting for decaffeinated coffee consumption
and the other covariates age, smoking, BMI, physical activity,
alcohol consumption, trans fat consumption, and Alternate
Mediterranean Diet Score (P-trend = 0.008). There was no signif-
icant linear trend involving decaffeinated coffee consumption
after adjusting for caffeinated coffee consumption and the other
covariates (P-trend = 0.63).
We also examined whether caffeine consumption from all
dietary sources was associated with telomere length (Table 5) and
found a significant association after adjusting for age, smoking,
BMI, physical activity, alcohol consumption, trans fat consump-
tion, and Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (P-trend = 0.02).
However, the association was no longer significant after addi-
tionally adjusting for total coffee consumption (P-trend = 0.37).
The Spearman correlation between caffeine and total coffee
consumption was 0.66, whereas the Spearman correlation be-
tween caffeine and caffeinated coffee consumption was 0.93.

 Discussion
In this large study of coffee consumption and telomere length in
4780 women from the NHS, we found significant linear associ-
ations with longer telomeres for higher total and caffeinated
coffee consumption. We did not find significant linear associations
with telomere length for decaffeinated coffee consumption.
Coffee consumption has been found to promote DNA integrity
in intervention (7–11) and biological studies (12–19). Intervention
studies have shown that coffee consumption reduces sponta-
neous DNA strand breaks (7) and protects against chemical-
induced DNA damage (8, 11) and oxidative DNA damage (9,
10). These intervention studies had study periods ranging from
3 d (11) to 4 wk (7) and coffee consumption amount ranging
from 600 mL/d (8) to 1 L/d (11). Animal and cell line studies
have shown that specific compounds in coffee such as chloro-
genic acid (12, 13) and diterpenes (14–16) may protect against
DNA damage. The role of caffeine on DNA integrity is compli-
cated. Caffeine has been shown by biological studies to inhibit
oxidative DNA breakage (19). However, caffeine can also be a
pro-oxidant (19), inhibit DNA repair (20, 21), and shorten telo-
meres in yeast (22).
Two epidemiologic studies found inconsistent associations
between coffee consumption and telomere length (23, 24). In an
intervention study of 40 chronic hepatitis C patients, telomere
length was found to be significantly longer in patients during the
experimental period of consuming 4 cups of coffee/d for 30 d
(23). A cross-sectional study found no significant association
between coffee consumption and telomere length in 840 white,
black, and Hispanic participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis; however, the focus of the study was not spe-
cifically on coffee but on dietary patterns and food groups, so
coffee consumption level was not clearly described (24). These
previous studies did not examine decaffeinated coffee consump-
tion or compare associations with telomere length across different
coffee consumption levels.
We found a statistically significant linear trend with lon-
ger telomeres for caffeinated coffee consumption but not for
decaffeinated coffee consumption, which is consistent with a
previous finding that the antioxidant capacity of caffeinated
coffee is higher than that of decaffeinated coffee (44). Although
statistical power was lower for analyses involving decaffeinated
coffee than for those involving caffeinated coffee, the categorical
effect estimates for the association with longer telomeres were
generally stronger for caffeinated coffee than decaffeinated
coffee. Caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee may have different
antioxidant concentrations because of the decaffeination pro-
cess, which not only lowers caffeine concentration but can also
lower other antioxidants that form complexes with caffeine,
such as polyphenols (45). In addition, a common decaffeination
process by use of carbon dioxide was shown to produce
melanoidins (46), antioxidants that are also formed during coffee
roasting (47–50). We found a significant association between
caffeine consumption and telomere length after adjusting for
potential confounders but not after additionally adjusting for
total coffee consumption (as an indirect adjustment for potential
confounding by the other antioxidants in coffee). This finding
suggests that compounds in coffee besides caffeine may be
responsible for the association between coffee consumption

 and telomere length. However, the influence of caffeine
consumption on telomere length cannot be entirely ruled out,
because simultaneous adjustment for both total coffee and
caffeine consumption in the model reduced statistical power
(given that coffee is a major source of caffeine), which may also
have contributed to the lack of statistical significance. Besides the
different concentrations of chemicals in caffeinated and decaf-
feinated coffee, caffeinated coffee drinkers have different personal
traits than decaffeinated coffee drinkers (51), and these traits can
modify or be potential confounders of the associations between
consumption levels and telomere length.
There are several strengths of this analysis examining coffee
consumption and telomere length. This is the largest study, to
our knowledge, of coffee consumption and telomere length,
which allowed us to adequately assess telomere length associ-
ations with different coffee consumption levels. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first analysis to examine the association between
decaffeinated coffee consumption and telomere length, which
allowed us to compare the associations involving caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee consumption. It is also, to our knowledge, the
first analysis to examine how caffeine consumption from all die-
tary sources is associated with telomere length. Besides our study�s
large sample size and novel analyses, we also had valid and
reliable measurements for coffee consumption and telomere
length. The FFQ-measured coffee consumption levels were vali-
dated in this cohort to correlate well with the actual consumption
levels (52). In addition, the telomere length assay was performed in
triplicate. Along with the strengths of this analysis, there are some
limitations. Because this is a cross-sectional study, the associations
do not exhibit temporality. We only had one telomere length
measurement for each participant, so we could not assess whether
higher coffee consumption was associated with changes in telo-
mere length. Another limitation is that our findings in female
Caucasian nurses may not generalize to other populations. Al-
though we accounted for important potential confounders, un-
measured or residual confounding could still be present.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that higher consumption
of coffee—especially caffeinated coffee—is associated with
longer telomeres, but additional studies are needed to clarify
how coffee consumption is involved in telomere biology. Future
studies can provide mechanistic understanding by examining
how specific compounds in coffee are involved in telomere main-
tenance. In addition, conducting observational and random-
ized clinical studies that examine other populations or obtain
repeated measurements of telomere length for each participant
will further clarify the shape of the dose-response curve for
coffee consumption and telomere length. Understanding
coffee�s effect on telomeres may help us discover new path-
ways by which coffee consumption influences health and
longevity.
