ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate the possible effects of exposure to 
neuraminidase inhibitors during embryo-fetal life with 
respect to adverse neonatal outcomes and congenital 
malformations.
Design
Population based multinational observational cohort 
study and meta-analysis.
setting
National registers covering information on maternal 
healthcare, births, and prescriptions in Denmark, 
Norway, and Sweden and the EFEMERIS database from 
the Haute-Garonne district in France.
PartiCiPants
All women together with their singleton infants born 
between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010. Only 
infants born at 154 days of gestation or later were 
included. Infants were defined as exposed if the women 
filled a prescription during pregnancy for either of the 
two neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir.
Main OutCOMes
Low birth weight, low Apgar score, preterm birth, small 
for gestational age birth, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, 
neonatal morbidity, and congenital malformations. 
Crude and adjusted hazard ratios of preterm birth were 
estimated using Cox regression models. Crude and 
adjusted odds ratios for other outcomes were 
estimated by logistic regression models.
results
The study included 5824 (0.8%) exposed women and 
their infants and 692 232 who were not exposed. 
Exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors in utero was not 
associated with increased risks of any of the 
investigated neonatal outcomes, including low birth 
weight (adjusted odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence 
interval 0.65 to 0.91), low Apgar score (adjusted odds 
ratio 0.87, 0.67 to 1.14), preterm birth (adjusted hazard 
ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10), small for gestational age birth 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.72, 0.59 to 0.87), stillbirth 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.51 to 1.30), neonatal 
mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 0.56 to 2.28), and 
neonatal morbidity (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 0.86 to 
1.00). No increased risk of congenital malformations 
overall associated with maternal exposure was 
observed during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio 
1.06, 0.77 to 1.48). Similarly, no significantly increased 
risks of any of the outcomes were observed in an 
analysis restricted to oseltamivir alone.
COnClusiOns
This large multinational register study found no 
increased risks of adverse neonatal outcomes or 
congenital malformations associated with exposure to 
neuraminidase inhibitors during embryo-fetal life. The 
results support previously reported findings that the 
use of neuraminidase inhibitors is not associated with 
increased risks of adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes.
Introduction
Pregnant women are at increased risk of severe disease 
and death secondary to influenza infection. In addition, 
influenza and fever may increase the risk of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes.1-4  Despite limited knowledge on 
the safety and effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibi-
tors in pregnancy, the regulatory agencies in Europe 
and the US recommended treatment and post-exposure 
prophylaxis in patients at high risk, such as pregnant 
women, during the 2009-10 influenza A/H1N1 
 
pandemic.5
In Europe, where our study took place, oseltamivir, 
taken orally, and zanamivir, which is inhaled, are the 
two approved neuraminidase inhibitors. Early treat-
ment of influenza with oseltamivir has been associated 
with a reduced risk of severe infection and of admission 
to intensive care units for pregnant women.1 
6  Because 
of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the regulatory  
agencies’ 
recommendations, the number of women exposed to 
neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy increased 
markedly during the 2009-10 influenza pandemic com-
pared with previous years.7 8 Accordingly, in the next 
virulent seasonal influenza pandemic, a large number 
of women may be targeted for post-exposure prophy-
laxis and treatment globally.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Seasonal influenza occurs yearly, and millions of pregnant women risk severe 
illness during seasons with a more aggressive strain
European and American health authorities have recommended treatment and 
post-exposure prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors for pregnant women
Despite the recommendations, information on possible adverse effects on infants 
exposed to neuraminidase inhibitors during embryo-fetal life is limited
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This is the largest study on the topic to date and includes almost 6000 infants 
exposed to neuraminidase inhibitors and around 700 000 unexposed infants
No increased risks of adverse neonatal outcomes including neonatal morbidity or 
mortality, poor fetal growth, low Apgar score, or congenital malformations were 
seen in exposed infants
The study supports previously reported findings that the use of neuraminidase 
inhibitors is not associated with increased risks of adverse fetal or neonatal  
outcomes

No randomised controlled trials on use of neuramin-
idase inhibitors during pregnancy have been con-
ducted. To date, seven observational studies including 
data from a total of approximately 2500 women who 
used oseltamivir during pregnancy found no increased 
risks of congenital malformations or other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes.5 9-14  The largest study so far was 
from Canada and included around 1200 exposed 
women. This study, which apparently had no informa-
tion on timing of drug exposure, found a significantly 
lower risk (adjusted odds ratio 0.77) of having a moder-
ately growth restricted infant (<10th centile) with osel-
tamivir.10  For congenital malformations, exposure 
during the first trimester is of relevance, and four of the 
other studies included exposure in the first trimester, 
collectively including approximately 300 women.5 12-14 
Their inadequate size and the fact that outcomes such 
as infant mortality, preterm births, severe intrauterine 
growth restriction, and congenital malformations occur 
rarely mean that the previous studies had limited 
 
statistical power for more detailed analyses of these 
outcomes.
Although the influenza pandemic in 2009-10 was rel-
atively mild in most cases, the uncertainty about the 
aggressiveness of a next pandemic virus outbreak and 
the possibility of spreading in vulnerable populations, 
such as pregnant women, mean that preparedness is 
critical. This study was set up to assess risks of adverse 
birth outcomes in association with the two major and 
non-intravenously administered neuraminidase inhib-
itors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, when used during 
pregnancy. Its objective was to evaluate possible 
adverse effects of exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors 
in utero on outcomes of low birth weight, low Apgar 
score, preterm birth, small for gestational age birth, 
stillbirth, neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and 
congenital malformations.
Methods
We did a multinational population based register study, 
including all women and their singleton infants born 
between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010 in the 
Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Norway, and Swe-
den) and those recorded in the EFEMERIS database in 
France.15
setting and data sources
The Scandinavian countries have population based 
national registers, which include prospectively col-
lected information for all inhabitants on demographic 
and health indicators such as births, dispensed drugs, 
and hospital contacts. The total population in the 
Scandinavian countries is approximately 20 million 
inhabitants, and the national parliaments have given 
informed consent to be included in the registers on 
behalf of their population.16  All registers include the 
civil registration number of each resident, a unique 
number assigned at birth or immigration, which allows 
linkage of individual data between registers. From the 
Scandinavian countries, we obtained data from the 
medical birth registers, the registers for prescribed 
drugs, and the patient registers. The Scandinavian 
medical birth registers include data on maternal char-
acteristics, pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal 
period, including information on maternal body mass 
index and on smoking during pregnancy. For congeni-
tal malformations, the data came from either the med-
ical birth registers or the patient registers. All 
diagnoses and congenital malformations were 
recorded according to ICD-10 (international classifica-
tion of diseases, 10th revision).17  The prescribed drug 
registers include data on dispensed substances, dis-
pensed dose, package sizes, and formulations accord-
ing to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
classification of drugs together with the date of dis-
pensing.18
From France, we included women recorded in the 
EFEMERIS database, which is described in detail else-
where.14 15 EFEMERIS is a population based database 
that holds health related data in the Haute-Garonne 
district, which has 1 million inhabitants. The register 
contains individual based information on prescribed 
drugs, pregnancy outcome, and neonatal health from 
national health insurance system, Mother and Child 
Protection Service, hospitals, and neonatal clinics. The 
data are anonymised before transmission to the phar-
macology service.
From the various data sources, we constructed two 
separate databases: one including Scandinavian data 
(pooling data from the three countries into one data-
base) and one with French data. Figure 1 describes the 
flow of data into the analysis.
Participants
All women together with their infants born during the 
study period and included in the Scandinavian birth 
registers or the EFEMERIS database were eligible for 
inclusion. Only singleton infants born at 154 days (22 
weeks) of gestation or later were included. We excluded 
all infants (and their mothers) with an ICD-10 code sug-
gesting chromosomal aberrations (Q90-99) or for whom 
the information on gestational age at delivery was miss-
ing. Women who had been admitted to hospital because 
of influenza or pneumonia (ICD-10 code J09-18) during 
pregnancy were excluded from the Scandinavian data-
base. In the EFEMERIS database, information on hospi-
tal admission during pregnancy was not available so

women admitted with influenza were not excluded in 
the French data.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors during 
embryo-fetal life
We defined exposure as having filled a prescription 
after the date of assumed conception (that is, from 14 
days after the first day of the last mentrual period), for 
either of the two neuraminidase inhibitors—oseltamivir 
(ATC code J05AH02) or zanamivir (ATC code JO5AH01)—
as recorded in the prescribed drug registers or the 
EFEMERIS database. Last menstrual period was based 
on gestational age calculated at an obstetric ultrasound 
examination that most of the included women had in 
the first or second trimester. We defined first trimester 
as gestational day 0-90, second trimester as gestational 
day 91-180, and third trimester as gestational day 181 to 
delivery. For congenital malformations, we evaluated 
only exposures during the first trimester in the study. 
We analysed oseltamivir and zanamivir jointly in the 
study and assessed associations with exposure only to 
oseltamivir in sub-analyses. Potential confounders 
included infant’s country of birth (Scandinavian coun-
tries), infant’s year of birth, maternal age, maternal 
comorbidity, and smoking. We defined maternal comor-
bidity as having filled at least one prescription for drugs 
used to treat chronic diseases, such as hypertension or 
 
diabetes, within 365 days before the first day of the last 
menstrual period (Scandinavian data). For the French 
data, the corresponding period was three months 
before the last menstrual period. A complete list of the 
included ATC codes used as proxies for maternal dis-
ease is shown in supplementary table A.
Outcome measures
We assessed the following neonatal outcomes: low 
birth weight, low Apgar score, preterm birth, small for 
gestational age birth, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, neo-
natal morbidity, and congenital malformations. We 
defined low birth weight as weighing less than 2500 g at 
birth regardless of gestational age, low Apgar as having 
an Apgar score of 0-6 at 5 minutes of life, preterm birth 
as birth before 259 gestational days (37 weeks), and 
small for gestational age birth as weighing 2 standard 
deviations or less below the corresponding mean birth 
weight by gestational length and infant sex in Sweden 
(Scandinavian data) or France (French data).19  Still-
birth was defined as recorded in the respective national 
registers or EFEMERIS database, neonatal mortality as 
death of a liveborn infant within the first 28 days of life, 
and neonatal morbidity as having one or more recorded 
ICD-10 codes P00-P99 within the first 28 days of life, 
grouped according to the affected organ system (sup-
plementary table B). We defined malformations diag-
nosed within the first 28 days of life according to ICD-10 
codes and the EUROCAT classification system.20  We did 
not consider minor malformations according to the 
EUROCAT classification.20
statistical analysis
The data in each database (Scandinavian countries and 
France) included information at the individual level, 
and in a first step we analysed the two databases sepa-
rately. The Scandinavian database thus encompassed 
individual data from all three countries. We used logis-
tic regression to estimate crude and adjusted odds 
ratios together with 95% confidence intervals for low 
birth weight, low Apgar score, small for gestational age 
birth, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and neonatal mor-
bidity. We used exact logistic regression for sparse 
data—that is, when no cases were reported among the 
exposed population. We used Cox proportional hazards 
regression models to estimate the hazards ratios 
together with 95% confidence intervals for preterm 
birth, with the gestational length in days as the under-
lying time variable. For the analyses of preterm birth, 
we followed women from gestational week 22 until an 
outcome event or censoring at a gestational age of 259 
days (37 weeks). We considered women to be exposed 
from the day in pregnancy when a neuraminidase 
inhibitor was dispensed and to remain as such until 
delivery.
We adjusted all outcomes for country (Scandinavian 
database only), year of birth, maternal age, maternal 
comorbidity, and smoking. We excluded women from 
the adjusted analysis if they had missing data on any of 
the five covariates. For malformations, we present the 
adjusted odds ratios only from analyses with more than 
five births among exposed infants with the specific mal-
formation or organ system event.
To assess the robustness of the logistic regression 
model and to investigate whether including body mass 
index in the model affected the results, we did a 
restricted analysis including only data from Sweden 
and Denmark, both of which had nearly complete infor-
mation on this variable. As inclusion of body mass 
index in the analysis carried out in the subset did not 
confound the results, we did not consider this variable 
in further analyses.
To combine the adjusted results from the Scandina-
vian and the French databases, we did a meta-analysis 
using the Metan command (version 9) in Stata (version 
11.2).21 
22 We estimated a random effect model. We used 
the χ2 test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic to assess 
the heterogeneity between the Scandinavian and 
French data.
Results
We included a total of 5824 (0.8%) exposed infants and 
692 232 unexposed infants in the study—5502 exposed 
and 672 784 unexposed infants from the Scandinavian 
countries, and 322 exposed and 19 448 unexposed 
infants from France (fig 1 ). Among the exposed

infants, most of the women (4310; 74%) had received 
oseltamivir and 441 were dispensed a neuraminidase 
inhibitor more than once during their pregnancy. 
Among the exposed women, 1220 were exposed in the 
first trimester, 2408 in the second trimester, and 2196 
in the third trimester. Table 1 describes the study par-
ticipants in more detail. Most of the exposed infants 
were born in 2010. The exposed women were slightly 
older and had a higher proportion of maternal comor-
bidity but a lower body mass index than unexposed 
women.
neonatal outcomes
In the entire study population, stillbirth occurred in 4.1 
per 1000 births and the neonatal mortality was 1.5 per 
1000 live births. Similarly, 38 866 (5.6%) were born 
preterm, 24 164 (3.5%) had a low birth weight, 17 539 
(2.5%) were small for gestational age, and 8503 (1.2%) 
had a low Apgar score.
Exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors in utero was 
not associated with increased risks of any of the investi-
gated neonatal outcomes (table 2 and supplementary 
figure A). Exposure was associated with a decreased 
risk of being born at a low birth weight (adjusted odds 
ratio 0.77
, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.91) or small 
for gestational age (0.72, 0.59 to 0.87). We found no 
increased risk of being born preterm (adjusted hazard 
ratio 0.97
, 0.86 to 1.10) or for stillbirth (adjusted odds 
ratio 0.81, 0.51 to 1.30).
The analysis of neonatal morbidity included only 
Scandinavian data. We found no overall association 
between exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors and 
increased neonatal morbidity during the first 28 days of 
life (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 0.86 to 1.00) (table 3). In 
the adjusted analysis, we found a decreased risk of 
respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the 
neonatal period among infants exposed to neuramini-
dase inhibitors during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 
0.84, 0.75 to 0.95). The estimates of risk for the neonatal 
outcomes by trimester of exposure and database are 
shown in supplementary table C.
When we included women exposed to only oseltami-
vir (supplementary table D), the point estimates and 
95% confidence intervals for all the estimated outcomes 
were similar to those derived from the compound expo-
sure (supplementary tables E-H and supplementary 
figure B).
Congenital malformations
The analysis of congenital malformations included only 
Scandinavian data from infants exposed during the first 
trimester, as no congenital malformations were 
reported in the 95 infants exposed during the first tri-
mester in the EFEMERIS database. Of the 1125 infants 
exposed in the first trimester, 44 had at least one con-
genital malformation diagnosed, yielding a prevalence 
of 3.9%. In the unexposed group, 19 509 (2.9%) of the 
672 784 infants had at least one congenital malforma-
tion. Among the exposed infants, three (0.3%) had 
more than one malformation. The corresponding num-
ber for the unexposed infants was 2336 (0.3%). In the 
adjusted analysis, we found no increased risk of con-
genital malformations overall in association with expo-
sure in utero (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 0.77 to 1.48). 
Although the analysis was limited by small sample size, 
neuraminidase inhibitor exposure was not associated 
with increased risk of any of the specific subgroups of 
congenital malformations according to the EUROCAT 
classification. Table 4 shows the absolute numbers per 
organ system and the adjusted odds ratio together with 
95% confidence intervals for malformations with more 
than five exposed births. The adjusted analysis of con-
genital malformations overall including infants 
exposed to oseltamivir in utero found an adjusted odds 
ratio of 1.08 (0.73 to 1.58).
discussion
In this large multinational population based study 
including almost 6000 infants exposed to neuramini-
dase inhibitors in utero, we found no significantly 
increased risks of adverse neonatal outcomes or con-
genital malformations. On the contrary, we observed a 
small decrease in risk of weighing less than 2500 g or 
being classified as small for gestational age after expo-
sure to neuraminidase inhibitors. The decreased risk 
remained after adjustment for possible confounders

such as infant’s year and country of birth and maternal 
age, comorbidity, and smoking during pregnancy. The 
findings of no increased risks remained when we 
restricted the analyses to exposure to oseltamivir only.
Comparison with previous studies
The effect of neuraminidase inhibitors during preg-
nancy on neonatal outcomes and congenital malforma-
tions has been assessed previously.2 5 9-14 23 24  However, 
this study is by far the largest, being almost twice the 
size of all other studies combined with respect to the 
number of exposed pregnant women, and our results 
confirm and expand on the findings in the previous 
studies of no association between neuraminidase 
inhibitors and a broad range of adverse neonatal out-
comes. The previous studies, including a study from

Previous studies that assessed the outcome of con-
genital malformations have collectively been based on 
approximately 300 women exposed in the first trimester 
and reported a total of 30 exposed cases of malforma-
tions.5 
9 
12-14 The 1125 women exposed in the first trimes-
ter and included in our study thus add substantially to 
the body of knowledge on possible adverse effects of 
neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy.
We observed an inverse association between expo-
sure to neuraminidase inhibitors and the risk of low 
birth weight or intrauterine growth restriction, mea-
sured as infants born small for gestational age. A simi-
lar finding was reported in a study from Canada, 
including 1200 exposed women.10 In the Canadian 
study, a significant association with small for gesta-
tional age birth at less than 10th centile was seen 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.77
, 0.60 to 0.98). Other than being 
a true association or a finding by chance, the protective 
effect of neuraminidase inhibitors on fetal growth may 
imply a “healthy user effect.” Women who filled a pre-
scription for a neuraminidase inhibitor may have been 
under closer observation by their attending physician 
than their comparisons, which, at least in theory, could 
reduce the risk of growth restriction in the neonate. 
Despite adjusting the analyses for potential confound-
ers related to health condition, such as age, smoking, 
and co-medication, we cannot preclude residual con-
founding.
In addition, a fetus may be exposed to several viruses 
with an adverse effect on fetal growth, and one may 
therefore speculate as to whether the reduced risk of 
small for gestational age birth could be partly due to the 
neuraminidase inhibitors affecting fetal growth in a 
positive direction through a general antiviral effect.25 
 
Although oseltamivir (which constituted most of the 
exposure in the study) is converted to its active 
 
metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate, which may be 
transferred across the placenta, we find this explana-
tion to be less likely.26-29
strengths and limitations of study
Our study was population based and included data 
from four countries, which suggests good external 
validity of the results. The Scandinavian population 
based registers and the EFEMERIS database have previ-
ously provided robust data on exposure and out-
comes.30 31  The large study cohort with almost 6000 
exposed women and their infants ensured sufficient 
statistical power to detect moderately increased risks of 
low birth weight, low Apgar score, preterm birth, 
growth restriction, and congenital malformations and 
to detect large increased risks of rare events such as 
stillbirth and neonatal mortality. However, with only 
1125 women exposed in the first trimester, the study was 
not sufficiently powered to study specific congenital 
malformations. The information on exposure was col-
lected prospectively, minimising the risk of recall bias. 
In contrast to several of the previous studies, we 
focused on the time period of the most recent influenza 
pandemic and included women and their infants born 
in 2008-10. Accordingly, we could ensure a high number 
of exposed infants in our study cohort, corresponding 
to almost 1% of the study population. An extended 
study period would have increased the number of 
exposed women only marginally, as use of neuramini-
dase inhibitors declined rapidly at the end of 2010.7 
8
We estimated exposure from the day when a prescrip-
tion for a neuraminidase inhibitor was filled. The possi-
bility exists that some of the women included in the 
study filled their prescription but did not take the drug 
or started taking it later than the date it was dispensed. 
This may lead to a possible bias by misclassification of 
exposure and a potential underestimation of the risks.
We did not have information on vaccination against 
H1N1 influenza among the women included in the 
study. All of the Scandinavian countries and France rec-
ommended vaccination for high risk groups, including 
pregnant women, during the pandemic. The vaccina-
tions were free of charge and made accessible for all 
pregnant women, and the vaccination rate has been 
estimated to more than 50% among women in Sweden 
and Norway, although much lower in Denmark and 
France.4 
32-34  Influenza infection is associated with fetal 
death, and immunisation during pregnancy may have 
reduced the risk of influenza related fetal death during 
the pandemic.4 
35 Accordingly, our results of no associa-
tion between exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors and 
fetal death may have been confounded by the vaccina-
tion status of the pregnant women, as exposure to neur-
aminidase inhibitors, presumably, was more prevalent 
among the non-vaccinated women.
In the studied countries, maternal healthcare is free 
of charge and widely accepted by the general popula-
tion. Almost all pregnant women follow the national 
programmes, and post-exposure prophylaxis with 
neuraminidase inhibitors was recommended during 
the influenza epidemic of 2009-10 and was distributed

free of charge or reimbursed to all pregnant women in 
Scandinavia and in France. In Norway (in contrast to 
the other participating countries) post-exposure pro-
phylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors was allowed to 
be dispensed by pharmacists to pregnant women with-
out a prescription by a doctor. The dispensed drugs 
were, however, reported routinely to the Norwegian Pre-
scription Database, and these women are included in 
our study. The internal validity of the study should be 
high, considering the absence of barriers to healthcare 
and access to post-exposure prophylaxis in the study 
population.
We excluded all women admitted to hospital because 
of influenza during pregnancy in the Scandinavian 
database. We did not have information on hospital 
admission during pregnancy for the French data. 
Hence, this much smaller cohort in the study may 
include sicker women than the larger Scandinavian 
cohort. However, the point estimates for the various 
outcomes were similar in both databases. The estimates 
in the meta-analysis show that the risk estimates 
changed only marginally when we combined the two 
sets of data. The rationale for the exclusion of women 
admitted to hospital in the Scandinavian data was to 
reduce confounding by indication, as we can assume 
that admitted women are sicker than women who 
receive outpatient care or post-exposure prophylaxis, as 
well as to safeguard the classification of exposure, as 
in-hospital drug use is not included in the prescribed 
drug registers at the individual level so there was no 
possibility to investigate whether admitted women had 
received neuraminidase inhibitors. In addition, we did 
not have information on the indication for the treat-
ment—that is, whether it was prescribed as post-expo-
sure prophylaxis or treatment for influenza. We assume 
that most the women were either taking the drug for a 
relatively non-severe illness or as post-exposure pro-
phylaxis, as women admitted to hospital were excluded. 
As we excluded women admitted to hospital, our study 
population may have been healthier than those 
included in the previous studies.
This study was based on information from a Scandina-
vian database of almost 700 000 mother and infant pairs 
and the smaller French database EFEMERIS with almost 
20 000 mother and infant pairs. In a previous study that 
was based on data from the national birth registers and 
the prescribed drug registers in the five Nordic coun-
tries—Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden), 
Finland, and Iceland—the results of analyses based on 
pooled data at the individual level were compared with 
those from an aggregate meta-analysis.36 The authors 
concluded that, for multi-database studies, the results 
from the two approaches to analysis would be similar. 
However, when data are sparse the pooled data are supe-
rior to a meta-analysis. We used both approaches in this 
study, optimising the information by pooling individual 
data from the Scandinavian countries and, as individual 
data from the French database could not be provided to 
the study analyst, doing an aggregate meta-analysis 
based on the results of the logistic and Cox regression 
analyses in the two databases.
We found no association between exposure to neur-
aminidase inhibitors and congenital malformations, 
although we did not study malformations in pregnan-
cies ending before gestational week 22. If neuramini-
dase inhibitors cause severe malformations leading to a 
miscarriage or termination of pregnancy, our results of 
no increased risks of malformations may have been 
biased. However, in the French study, which included 
pregnancies ending before 22 weeks, no cases of termi-
nation of pregnancy due to malformation occurred 
among those exposed to oseltamivir.14
Conclusion and clinical implications
In this large multinational register study, we found no 
increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes or con-
genital malformations associated with exposure to 
neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy. Our 
results support previously reported findings that the 
use of neuraminidase inhibitors is not associated 
with increased risks of adverse fetal or neonatal 
 
outcomes.
