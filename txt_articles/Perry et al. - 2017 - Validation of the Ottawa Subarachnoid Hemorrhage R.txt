ubarachnoid hemorrhage is one of the most serious 
causes of sudden headache, yet it accounts for only 1%– 
3% of headaches.1–4 Although the decision to order neu-
roimaging in a patient with decreased level of consciousness or 
new neurologic deficits is relatively obvious, half of all patients 
with subarachnoid hemorrhage are alert and neurologically 
intact at first presentation.5 Making a decison to send these 
patients for imaging tests is difficult, because timely diagnosis 
and treatment result in substantially better outcomes if sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage is the cause of the headache.
However, the desire never to miss a subarachnoid hemorrhage 
contributes to escalating rates of neuroimaging and a dogmatic 
adherence to lumbar puncture if the scan result is negative, 
despite the very high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT).6,7 
However, a population-based study involving patients admitted to 
hospital through emergency departments in Ontario with a most 
responsible diagnosis of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage 
found that over 5% of confirmed subarachnoid hemorrhages were 
missed at initial presentation, especially in smaller hospitals.8 
Therefore, identifying which patients with headache require inves-
tigations to rule out this catastrophic diagnosis, and which do not, 
is a critical decision in emergency medicine.
We previously derived (n = 1999)9 and refined (n = 2131)10 the 
Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Rule (Figure 1) using 
2 successive prospective cohorts of patients with headache who 
visited the emergency department. Clinical decision rules require 
prospective validation in a new patient cohort before their imple-
mentation and use in routine patient care.11–14 In this study, we 
assessed the accuracy, clinical acceptability and potential effect 
on rates of neuroimaging of the Ottawa SAH Rule in a new cohort 
of consecutive patients with acute headache who visited the 
emergency department.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: We previously derived the 
Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule to 
identify subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in 
patients with acute headache. Our objec-
tive was to validate the rule in a new cohort 
of consecutive patients who visited an 
emergency department.
METHODS: We conducted a multicentre 
prospective cohort study at 6 university-
affiliated tertiary-care hospital emergency 
departments in Canada from January 
2010 to January 2014. We included   alert, 
neurologically intact adult patients with a 
headache peaking within 1 hour of onset. 
Treating physicians in the emergency 
department explicitly scored the rule 
before investigations were started. We 
defined subarachnoid hemorrhage as 
detection of any of the following: subarach-
noid blood visible upon computed tomog-
raphy of the head (from the final report by 
the local radiologist); xanthochromia in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (by visual inspection); 
or the presence of erythrocytes (> 1 × 106/L) 
in the final tube of cerebrospinal fluid, with 
an aneurysm or arteriovenous malforma-
tion visible upon cerebral angiography. We 
calculated sensitivity and specificity of the 
Ottawa SAH Rule for detecting or ruling out 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
RESULTS: Treating physicians enrolled 
1153 of 1743 (66.2%) potentially eligible 
patients, including 67 with subarach-
noid hemorrhage. The Ottawa SAH Rule 
had 100% sensitivity (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 94.6%–100%) with a speci-
ficity of 13.6% (95% CI 13.1%–15.8%), 
whereas neuroimaging rates remained 
similar (about 87%).
INTERPRETATION: We found that the 
Ottawa SAH Rule was sensitive for identi-
fying subarachnoid hemorrhage in other-
wise alert and neurologically intact 
patients. We believe that the Ottawa SAH 
Rule can be used to rule out this serious 
diagnosis, thereby decreasing the num-
ber of cases missed while constraining 
rates of neuroimaging.

Methods
Study population and setting
We conducted this prospective multicentre cohort study in the emer-
gency departments of 6 university-affiliated Canadian tertiary-care 
hospitals from January 2010 to January 2014. The combined annual 
census for all sites was 365 000 visits with over 150 attending physi-
cians certified in emergency medicine. Each hospital had previously 
participated in the derivation phase of the study.10 Consecutive adult 
patients (16 yr of age or older) with nontraumatic headache that had 
reached maximal intensity within 1 hour of onset were considered 
for enrollment. We excluded patients who had a Glasgow Coma 
Scale score less than 15/15, who had sustained direct head trauma in 
the previous 7 days, and who presented more than 14 days after 
onset of the headache.15 We also excluded patients with a history of 3 
or more recurrent headaches of the same character and intensity as 
the presenting headache over a period of greater than 6 months (i.e., 
established recurrent headache syndrome); who were referred from 
another hospital with a confirmed subarachnoid hemorrhage; who 
returned for reassessment of the same headache if already investi-
gated with both CT and lumbar puncture; who had papilledema on 
fundoscopic examination; who had new focal neurologic deficits 
(e.g., isolated cranial nerve palsies, limb weakness); or who had a 
previous diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm, subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, brain neoplasm, ventricular shunt or hydrocephalus. Any 
patient not known to meet the exclusion criteria but not enrolled by 
the treating physician was deemed “missed/potentially eligible.” 
Participants enrolled by physicians were informed that they might 
be contacted by telephone in follow-up, and verbal consent was 
obtained from these patients at the time of telephone contact.
Assessment
Patients were assessed by attending physicians certified in emer-
gency medicine or residents in emergency medicine who were super-
vised by attending physicians. Physicians were oriented to the study 
and the standardized assessment form during a 1-hour presentation. 
After assessing a patient, but before making a request for imaging 
tests or analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, physicians were asked to 
explicitly score each element of the Ottawa SAH Rule as present or 
absent and to record other potentially clinical relevant findings on a 
paper study form (we collected the additional variables to obtain a 
better description of the cohort and to have on hand in case any fur-
ther refinement of the rule was required). To assess sensibility, physi-
cians answered 2 questions related to interpretation and use of the 
Rule: Are investigations indicated for this patient according to the 
decision rule? (yes/no); and How comfortable would you be in actu-
ally using the rule for this patient? (based on a 5-point Likert Scale 
from “very comfortable” to “very uncomfortable”). We provided 
training to nurses at each site, using a full-day orientation session 
and ongoing monthly feedback from the central study coordinator, 
to collect data forms, verify data, confirm patient eligibility and per-
form telephone follow-up at 1 and 6 months after the index visit to 
the emergency department when necessary. Research staff also 
reviewed censuses from the emergency department for potentially 
eligible patients not enrolled by the treating physician. Missed 
patients had the same clinical variables extracted from the medical 
record and manually recorded onto standardized study forms. All 
data forms for both physician-enrolled and missed eligible patients 
were reviewed centrally by a single trained nurse coordinator, who 
was blind to outcome, and compared with the medical record from 
the emergency department. This nurse coordinator assessed the 
agreement between the physician assessments of the rule (i.e., inves-
tigations indicated yes/no) as written on the data form and as 
extracted from the clinical documentation.
Outcome measures
Subarachnoid hemorrhage was defined by any one of the follow-
ing: subarachnoid blood visible on unenhanced CT scan of the 
head (from the final report of the local radiologist); xanthochromia 
in the cerebrospinal fluid (by visual inspection); or the presence of 
erythrocytes (> 1 × 106/L) in the final tube of cerebrospinal fluid, 
with an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation visible upon 
cerebral angiography. This outcome was established a priori by 
consensus of 5 emergency medicine physicians and 1 neurosur-
geon, and has been used consistently in prior phases of the devel-
opment of the Ottawa SAH Rule.3,10,16 Patients with a normal result 
both for CT scanning and lumbar puncture testing were classified 
as not having a subarachnoid hemorrhage.17
We could not require all patients to undergo CT scanning and 
lumbar puncture in this observational study. In addition, the 
local ethics boards only allowed us to contact patients who had 
been enrolled by physicians and, as a result, had been informed 
about the subsequent follow-up call. Therefore, only patients 
enrolled by physicians and who were discharged without both a 
CT scan and a normal lumbar puncture were eligible for tele-
phone follow-up. These patients underwent a structured tele-
phone interview at 1 and 6 months after the index visit to the 
Investigation required if the patient presents 
with 1 or more  of the following:
• Symptom of neck pain or stifness
• Age > 40 yr
• Witnessed loss of consciousness
• Onset during exertion
• Thunderclap headache (peak pain instantly)
• Limited neck flexion upon exam

emergency departmentto identify a subsequent subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. In the follow-up telephone call, patients were asked 
about physician visits, changes in diagnosis and subsequent test-
ing with lumbar puncture or imaging. We had previously vali-
dated this follow-up tool for missed subarachnoid hemorrhage 
during the initial derivation phase of the study.16 
All medical records of patients without both normal CT scans 
and lumbar punctures underwent explicit review at the end of the 
study to identify missed subarachnoid hemorrhages. A similar 
review process involving medical records identified all subsequent 
subarachnoid hemorrhages in earlier phases of this study.10,16 We 
also evaluated patients not known to be alive at least 6 months 
after their index visits against the provincial coroner’s records to 
identify any deaths compatible with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the Ottawa SAH Rule for subarach-
noid hemorrhage. Interobserver agreement between treating physi-
cian and the nurse coordinator of the study for the rule as a whole was 
measured using the Cohen κ statistic test for participants enrolled by 
physicians. Univariate analysis used a 2-sided t test for continuous 
variables and the Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables. Because we 
wanted the sensitivity to be close to 100% to be clinically acceptable, 
we planned to enroll about 1200 patients, including 75 with subarach-
noid hemorrhage, based on a prevalence estimate of 6.5%.
Ethics approval
The first research ethics board approval was obtained from the 
Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board (OHSN-REB) 
without the need for written consent, with additional independent 
approval subsequently obtained from each participating site. 
Results
We prospectively enrolled 1153 patients with acute headache, 
including 67 (5.8%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage. We identi-
fied another 590 patients (missed eligible) whose medical 
records were assessed by our research staff after the initial visit 
to the emergency department, including 33 (5.6%) with sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage. There were 8 patients who could not be 
reached for telephone follow-up (Figure 2). These patients did 
not present again to the regional neurosurgical centre nor were 
they reported to the provincial coroner’s office within 6 months 
of enrollment.
Table 1 shows participant characteristics. Characteristics of 
the participants considered missed eligible (mean age 45.4 yr, 
female sex 60.5%, arrived by ambulance 31.0%, had CT 89.8%, 
had lumbar puncture 38.3% and diagnosed with subarachnoid 
hemorrhage 5.6%) were similar to patients who were prospec-
tively enrolled (mean age 43.9 yr, female sex 59.8%, arrived by 
ambulance 26.5%, had CT 87.1%, had lumbar puncture 39.2% 
and diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage 5.8%). Patients 
with subarachnoid hemorrhage were more likely to be older; had 
headaches that rapidly peaked in intensity; had onset of head-
ache with exertion; had arrived by ambulance; had lost con-
sciousness; and had neck pain or stiffness, vomiting and elevated 
systolic blood pressure (Table 2).
We found that the Ottawa SAH Rule had a sensitivity of 100% 
(95% CI 94.6%–100%) with a specificity of 13.6% (95% CI 13.1%–
15.8%) (Table 3). When we pooled patients in this new validation 
cohort with our previous validation/refinement patient cohort 
(n = 3874), the sensitivity of the rule was 100% (95% CI 98.4%–
100%) and specificity was 15.9% (95% CI 14.8%–17.1%) for sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage.10

noid hemorrhage. Neck pain or stiffness was the variable with 
the most frequent disagreement (documented at least once in 
the medical record but scored as absent by the physician).
We assessed the potential effect of the Ottawa SAH Rule on 
neuroimaging rates compared with actual practice. The actual 
neuroimaging rate in this cohort was 88.0%, and another 1.0% 
underwent lumbar puncture without CT, for an overall investiga-
tion rate of 89.0%. If the Ottawa SAH Rule had been followed, the 
investigation rate would have been 84.3%.
Interpretation
We found that the Ottawa SAH Rule was sensitive for identifying 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (i.e., every case was identified when 
the rule was used). With the findings from this study and our ear-
lier work we believe that the Ottawa SAH Rule is ready to use to 
evaluate which patients who are neurologically intact with a new 
rapidly peaking headache require investigation. This rule pro-
vides clinicians with a validated tool to help standardize which 
patients with headache do not require investigation to rule out 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. In our experience, careful application 
of the rule will identify patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage 
while avoiding unnecessary CT scanning and painful lumbar 
punctures. This rule may also help smaller hospitals decide 
which patients with headache are unlikely to benefit from trans-
port to larger centres for imaging.
Overall, the sensitivity of the Ottawa SAH Rule is higher than a 
previous, population-based estimate in Ontario that 1 in 
20 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are missed on their 
first visit to the emergency department, which increases to 1 in 16 
in nonteaching hospitals and includes all grades of severity.8 Phy-
sicians in the emergency department, when surveyed, have stated 
that 99% sensitivity is acceptable for a subarachnoid hemorrhage 
rule, a threshold that acknowledges the pitfall of pursuing diag-
nostic perfection at all cost. The narrow confidence bands of sensi-
tivity for the Ottawa SAH Rule bracket this extremely high thresh-
old, and the point estimate exceeds it.18 This precision was 
achieved only with a sustained and rigorous prospective enroll-
ment campaign at several hospitals over many years.
This study is comparable to a previous retrospective study 
involving 454 patients with acute headache that reported 
9 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. This study found that 
the Ottawa SAH Rule had 100% sensitivity; however, it had a 
wide 95% CI (62.9%–100%).19
We designed and conducted this prospective validation study 
according to the strict methodological standards for clinical deci-
sion rule development.11–14 We carefully defined the outcome, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and it is clinically important. Patients 
were included according to strict eligibility criteria, rather than 
on the somewhat circular logic of having already been selected 
for CT scanning or lumbar puncture, or known to be disease posi-
tive. We enrolled or followed all potentially eligible patients even 
when missed by the treating physician. In addition to accuracy, 
we also evaluated other important measures including interob-
server agreement, clinical acceptability and potential effect on 
clinical practice.
Limitations
We acknowledge some potential limitations to this study. There 
is no established gold standard definition of a positive subarach-
noid hemorrhage. We recognize that some patients with small, 
nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who are often man-
aged conservatively were classified as disease positive using our 
definition, and a more meaningful outcome might be restricted 
to patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who undergo inter-
vention. Nevertheless, we have used the same definition 
throughout and believe that our composite outcome is clinically 
important and relevant.20 As with any decision tool, physicians 
may not apply the rule correctly. This raises the issue of how best 
to put the rule into operation, especially in an era of burgeoning 
health informatics and decision support, as well as use by opera-
tors other than emergency medicine physicians. These important 
issues are often the objective of subsequent implementation and 
knowledge translation studies. 
About 1 in 3 cases were missed and not enrolled by the treat-
ing physician. In these cases, the presence or absence of specific 
elements of the rule were ascertained based on a review of medi-
cal records by research personnel. In these cases, the rule 
appeared to perform almost identically. The baseline clinical 
characteristics of the 2 subgroups including prevalence of sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage were similar, which suggests little selec-
tion bias. 
Validation of clinical decision rules is critical before full clini-
cal use. Ideally, this is done in new patients at different sites from 
the original derivation. In this study, we enrolled new patients, 
but we used sites that had participated in the derivation of the 
Ottawa SAH Rule. This was done for feasibility reasons. Using the 
same sites does not cause bias regarding rule performance; how-
ever, it may overestimate the ability of physicians to use the rule 
correctly. Finally, the Ottawa SAH Rule is only intended for iden-
tifying patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is not a rule for 
excluding other types of headache.

Conclusion
We found that the Ottawa SAH Rule had excellent sensitivity for 
identifying subarachnoid hemorrhage in a new consecutive cohort 
of patients with acute headache. Patients who are neurologically 
intact with a new rapidly peaking headache and who lack each of 
the 6 elements of the rule do not need further investigation to rule 
out subarachnoid hemorrhage. Instead, other diagnoses should be 
considered and managed accordingly in these patients.
