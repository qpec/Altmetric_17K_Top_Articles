Objective: This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal
insufficiency.
Participants: The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of
the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist,
and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the
American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received
no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.
Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recom-
mendations and the quality of evidence.
Consensus Process: The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two
commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies iden-
tified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine
Society’s Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members respond-
ing to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated
changes in response to written comments.
Conclusions: We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in
all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic
(and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors.
This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and
hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 �g) as the “gold standard” diagnostic
tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we
recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH
and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoan-
tibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be
sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25
mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults.
In children, hydrocortisone (�8 mg/m2/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about
stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral
emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticoste-
roids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease. (J Clin En-
docrinol Metab 101: 364–389, 2016)

 Summary of Recommendations
1.0 Who should be tested and how?
1.1 We recommend diagnostic testing to exclude pri-
maryadrenalinsufficiency(PAI)inacutelyillpatientswith
otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of
PAI (volume depletion, hypotension, hyponatremia, hy-
perkalemia,fever,abdominalpain,hyperpigmentationor,
especially in children, hypoglycemia). (1�QQQE)
1.2 We recommend confirmatory testing with the cor-
ticotropin stimulation test in patients with clinical symp-
toms or signs suggesting PAI when the patient’s condition
and circumstance allow. (1�QQQQ)
1.3 In patients with severe adrenal insufficiency
symptoms or adrenal crisis, we recommend immediate
therapy with iv hydrocortisone at an appropriate stress
dose prior to the availability of the results of diagnostic
tests. (1�QQQE)
2.0 Optimal diagnostic tests
2.1Wesuggestthestandarddose(250�gforadultsand
children �2 y of age, 15 �g/kg for infants, and 125 �g for
children�2yofage)ivcorticotropinstimulation(30or60
min) test over other existing diagnostics tests to establish
the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Peak cortisol levels
below 500 nmol/L (18 �g/dL) (assay dependent) at 30 or
60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency. (2�QQEE)
2.2 We suggest the low-dose (1 �g) corticotropin test
for diagnosis of PAI only when the substance itself is in
short supply. (2�QQEE)
2.3 If a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible, we
suggest using a morning cortisol �140 nmol/L (5 �g/dL)
in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test sugges-
tive of adrenal insufficiency (until confirmatory testing
with corticotropin stimulation is available). (2�QEEE)
2.4 We recommend measurement of plasma ACTH to
establish PAI. The sample can be obtained at the same time
as the baseline sample in the corticotropin test or paired
with the morning cortisol sample. In patients with con-
firmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH �2-fold the
upper limit of the reference range is consistent with PAI.
(1�QQQE)
2.5 We recommend the simultaneous measurement of
plasma renin and aldosterone in PAI to determine the pres-
ence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. (1�QQQE)
2.6 We suggest that the etiology of PAI should be de-
termined in all patients with confirmed disease. (For di-
agnostic workup, see Table 2 and Figure 1.) (Ungraded
best practice recommendation)
3.0 Treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency in
adults
Glucocorticoid replacement regimen
3.1 We recommend glucocorticoid therapy in all pa-
tients with confirmed PAI. (1�QQQQ)
3.2 We suggest using hydrocortisone (15–25 mg) or cor-
tisone acetate (20–35 mg) in two or three divided oral doses
per day; the highest dose should be given in the morning at
awakening, the next either in the early afternoon (2 h after
lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and afternoon (three-
dose regimen). Higher frequency regimens and size-based
dosing may be beneficial in individual cases. (2�QQEE)
3.3 As an alternative to hydrocortisone, we suggest us-
ing prednisolone (3–5 mg/d), administered orally once or
twice daily, especially in patients with reduced compli-
ance. (2�QEEE)
3.4 We suggest against using dexamethasone for the
treatment of PAI because of risk of Cushingoid side effects
due to difficulties in dose titration. (2�QQEE)
3.5 We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement
using clinical assessment including body weight, postural
bloodpressure,energylevels,signsoffrankglucocorticoid
excess. (2�QQQE)
3.6 We suggest against hormonal monitoring of gluco-
corticoid replacement and to adjust treatment only based
on clinical response. (2�QQQE)
Mineralocorticoid replacement in PAI
3.7 We recommend that all patients with confirmed
aldosterone deficiency receive mineralocorticoid replace-
ment with fludrocortisone (starting dose, 50–100 �g in
adults) and not restrict their salt intake. (1�QQQQ)
3.8 We recommend monitoring mineralocorticoid re-
placement primarily based on clinical assessment (salt
craving, postural hypotension, or edema), and blood elec-
trolyte measurements. (1�QQQE)
3.9 In patients who develop hypertension while receiv-
ing fludrocortisone, we suggest reducing the dose of
fludrocortisone. (2�QEEE)

 3.10 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, we sug-
gest initiating antihypertensive treatment and continuing
fludrocortisone. (2�QEEE)
Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement
3.11 We suggest a trial of dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA) replacement in women with PAI and low libido,
depressive symptoms, and/or low energy levels despite
otherwise optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorti-
coid replacement. (2�QQEE)
3.12 We suggest an initial period of 6 months of DHEA
replacement. If the patient does not report a sustained,
beneficial effect of replacement after 6 months, the DHEA
should be discontinued. (2�QQEE)
3.13 We suggest monitoring DHEA replacement by
measuring morning serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) levels
(aiming at the midnormal range) before the intake of the
daily DHEA replacement dose. (2�QQEE)
Treatment during pregnancy
3.14 We suggest that pregnant patients with PAI be
monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of glucocorti-
coid over- and under-replacement (eg, normal weight
gain, fatigue, postural hypotension or hypertension, hy-
perglycemia), with at least one review per trimester. (Un-
graded best practice statement)
3.15 We suggest that, based on the individual clinical
course, an increase in hydrocortisone dose should be im-
plemented, in particular during the third trimester. (Un-
graded best practice statement)
3.16 In pregnant women with PAI, we suggest using
hydrocortisone over cortisone acetate, prednisolone, or
prednisone (2�QQEE) and recommend against using
dexamethasone because it is not inactivated in the pla-
centa. (1�QQEE)
3.17 We recommend hydrocortisone stress dosing dur-
ing the active phase of labor, similar to that used in major
surgical stress. (1�QQEE)
Treatment and monitoring during childhood
3.18 In children with PAI, we suggest treatment with
hydrocortisone in three or four divided doses (total start-
ing daily dose of 8 mg/m2 body surface area) over other
types of glucocorticoid replacement therapies, with doses
adjusted according to individual need. (2�QQEE)
3.19 In children with PAI, we suggest avoiding syn-
thetic, long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone,
dexamethasone). (2�QQEE)
3.20 We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replace-
ment by clinical assessment, including growth velocity,
bodyweight,bloodpressure,andenergylevels.(Ungraded
best practice statement)
3.21 In children with PAI and confirmed aldosterone
deficiency, we recommend treatment with fludrocortisone
(starting dosage, 100 �g/d). For infants, we recommend
sodium chloride supplements in the newborn period and
up to the age of 12 months. (1�QQEE)
4.0 Management and prevention of adrenal crisis
in patients with PAI
4.1 We recommend that patients with suspected adre-
nal crisis should be treated with an immediate parenteral
injection of 100 mg (50 mg/m2 for children) hydrocorti-
sone, followed by appropriate fluid resuscitation and 200
mg (50–100 mg/m2 for children) of hydrocortisone/24
hours (via continuous iv therapy or 6 hourly injection);
age- and body surface-appropriate dosing is required in
children (see Table 3). (1�QQQE)
4.2 If hydrocortisone is unavailable, we suggest pred-
nisolone as an alternative. Dexamethasone is the least-
preferred alternative and should only be given if no other
glucocorticoid is available. (2�QQEE)
4.3 For the prevention of adrenal crisis, we suggest ad-
justing glucocorticoid dose according to severity of illness
or magnitude of the stressor. (2�QQEE)
4.4 We suggest patient education concerning glucocor-
ticoid adjustments in stressful events and adrenal crisis-
prevention strategies including parenteral self- or lay-ad-
ministration of emergency glucocorticoids. (Ungraded
best practice statement)
4.5 We recommend that all patients should be equipped
with a steroid emergency card and medical alert identifi-
cation to inform health personnel of the need for increased
glucocorticoid doses to avert or treat adrenal crisis and the
need of immediate parenteral steroid treatment in the
event of an emergency. (Ungraded best practice statement)
4.6 We recommend that every patient should be
equippedwithaglucocorticoidinjectionkitforemergency
use and be educated on how to use it. (Ungraded best
practice statement)
5.0 Additional monitoring requirement
5.1 We suggest that adults and children with PAI be
seen by an endocrinologist or a healthcare provider with
endocrine expertise at least annually. Infants should be
seen at least every 3 to 4 months. (Ungraded best practice
statement)
5.2 We suggest that PAI patients be evaluated annually
for symptoms and signs of over- and under-replacement.
(Ungraded best practice statement)
5.3 We suggest periodic screening for autoimmune dis-
eases known to be more prevalent in PAI patients in whom
autoimmune origin of PAI has not been excluded. The
optimal frequency of screening is unknown but can be

 done annually. These conditions include thyroid disease,
diabetes mellitus, premature ovarian failure, celiac dis-
ease, and autoimmune gastritis with vitamin B12 defi-
ciency. (2�QQEE)
5.4 We suggest patient education about increasing the
dosage of glucocorticoids during intercurrent illness, fe-
ver, and stress. This education includes identification of
precipitating symptoms and signs and how to act in im-
pending adrenal crisis. (Ungraded best practice statement)
5.5 We suggest genetic counseling for patients with PAI
due to monogenic disorders. (Ungraded best practice
statement)
General Introduction
PAI is defined by the inability of the adrenal cortex to
producesufficientamountsofglucocorticoidsand/ormin-
eralocorticoids. PAI is a severe and potentially life-threat-
ening condition due to the central role of these hormones
in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. PAI was first de-
scribedbyThomasAddison(1)andisthereforecommonly
termed Addison’s disease. Cortisol deficiency results in a
decrease in feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
and subsequent enhanced stimulation of the adrenal cor-
tex by elevated levels of plasma ACTH. Consequent to
disruption of adrenal mineralocorticoid synthesis, renin
release by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys in-
creases. This is of clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic rel-
evance because PAI needs to be distinguished from sec-
ondary adrenocortical insufficiency due to insufficient
production of ACTH and without impact on the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system.
The signs of PAI are mainly based on the deficiency of
gluco- and mineralocorticoids and the resultant weight
loss, orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration, hypo-
natremia, hyperkalemia, changes in blood count (anemia,
eosinophilia, lymphocytosis), and hypoglycemia (summa-
rized in Table 1). Enhanced secretion of ACTH and other
pro-opiomelanocortin peptides often leads to the charac-
teristic hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous mem-
branes. In women, loss of adrenal androgens results in loss
of axillary and pubic hair. Except for salt craving, the
symptoms of PAI are rather nonspecific and include weak-
ness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, weight loss, abdomi-
nalpain,depression,andanxiety.Asaresult,thediagnosis
is frequently delayed, resulting in a clinical presentation
with an acute life-threatening adrenal crisis (2). Even with
treatment, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
patients with Addison’s disease receiving standard re-
placement therapy is often reduced (3, 4). Moreover, long-
term HRQoL in these patients appears to be inversely re-
lated to the delay in establishing the diagnosis after disease
onset, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the dis-
ease early (5, 6). This is complicated by the fact that PAI
is a rare disease with a reported prevalence of about 100
to 140 cases per million and an incidence of 4:1 000 000
per year in Western societies (7–10). Nevertheless, recent
health insurance data from Germany report an increasing

Most symptoms are nonspecific and present chronically, often leading to delayed diagnosis. Hyponatremia and, later, hyperkalemia are often
triggers to diagnosis, requiring biochemical confirmation of adrenal insufficiency. Hyperpigmentation is a specific sign, but it is variably present in
individuals and must be compared with the patient’s background pigmentation, such as that in siblings. Adrenal crisis is a medical emergency with
hypotension, marked acute abdominal symptoms, and marked laboratory abnormalities, requiring immediate treatment. Continuing effort to
prevent adrenal crisis is integral to patient management. Additional symptoms and signs may arise from the underlying cause of adrenal
insufficiency, eg, associated autoimmune disorders, neurological features of adrenoleukodystrophy, or disorders that may lead to adrenal
infiltration.

 prevalence, particularly in females (11). The most com-
mon cause of PAI is autoimmunity (up to 90% in Western
countries), followed by infectious diseases such as tuber-
culosis, adrenalectomy, neoplasia, and various genetic
causes; the last are more likely to be present and diagnosed
in children. Moreover, due to the growing number of
chronically and severely ill patients requiring chronic in-
tensive care that includes multiple concomitant pharma-
cological therapies, additional iatrogenic factors (such as
adrenal hemorrhage related to anticoagulants, inhibition
of cortisol synthesis by aminoglutethimide or etomidate,
activation of glucocorticoid metabolism by anticonvul-
sants like phenytoin or phenobarbital, or antibiotics like
rifampicin) increasingly contribute to the ultimate mani-
festation of PAI (12).
The diagnosis and management of adrenal insuffi-
ciency secondary to hypothalamic-pituitary failure have
been recently discussed in an expert review in this journal
(13). Also, the management of congenital adrenal hyper-
plasia (CAH) due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency has
been comprehensively discussed, and a current clinical
guideline on CAH has been published by the Endocrine
Society (14). Therefore, the current guideline focuses on
the diagnosis and treatment of PAI alone; issues related to
secondary adrenal insufficiency and critical illness-related
corticosteroid insufficiency have been excluded. The level
of evidence and strength of recommendations published
in this guideline were evaluated based on the GRADE
system.
Method of Development of Evidence-
Based Clinical Practice Guidelines
The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of the En-
docrine Society deemed the management of PAI a priority
area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task
Forcetoformulateevidence-basedrecommendations.The
Task Force followed the approach recommended by the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international
group with expertise in development of evidence-based
guidelines (15). A detailed description of the grading
schemehasbeenpublishedelsewhere(16).TheTaskForce
used the best available research evidence to develop the
recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent
language and graphical descriptions of both the strength
of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms
of the strength of the recommendation, strong recommen-
dations use the phrase “we recommend” and the number
1, and weak recommendations use the phrase “we sug-
gest” and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the
quality of the evidence, such that QEEE denotes very low-
quality evidence; QQEE, low quality; QQQE, moderate
quality; and QQQQ, high quality. The Task Force has con-
fidence that persons who receive care according to the
strong recommendations will derive, on average, more
good than harm. Weak recommendations require more
careful consideration of the person’s circumstances, val-
ues, and preferences to determine the best course of action.
Linked to each recommendation is a description of the
evidence and the values that panelists considered in mak-
ing the recommendation; in some instances, there are
remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical sug-
gestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring.
These technical comments reflect the best available evi-
dence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this
evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the
panelists and their values and preferences; therefore, these
remarks should be considered suggestions. In this guide-
line, the Task Force made several statements to emphasize
various monitoring and patient education actions needed
to prevent the severe morbidity and mortality of adrenal
crisis and reduce medication side effects. These were la-
beled as ungraded best practice statements. Direct evi-
dence for these statements was either unavailable or not
systematically appraised and was considered out of the
scope of this guideline. The intention of these statements
is to draw attention and remind providers of these prin-
ciples, and these statements should not be considered as
graded recommendations (17).
The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-
of-interest review process for the development of clinical
practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare
any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed be-
fore they are approved to serve on the Task Force and
periodically during the development of the guideline. The
conflict-of-interest forms are vetted by the CGS before the
members are approved by the Society’s Council to partic-
ipate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the
guideline development must include a majority of individ-
uals without conflict of interest in the matter under study.
Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in
the development of the guideline, but they must have dis-
closed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have
reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or
managed all identified conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any
amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of
grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; owner-
ship interest (eg, stocks, stock options, or ownership in-
terest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or
other payments for participation in speakers’ bureaus, ad-
visory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial

 benefits. Completed forms are available through the En-
docrine Society office.
Funding for this guideline was derived solely from the
Endocrine Society, and thus the Task Force received no
funding or remuneration from commercial or other
entities.
Commissioned systematic reviews
The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews
and developed an a priori protocol that included a specific
search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
methods of evidence synthesis. The two reviews summa-
rized data on patients with both primary and secondary
adrenal insufficiency; however, the Task Force used data
derived from patients with PAI because this was the target
population of this guideline.
The first review compared the diagnostic accuracy of
high-dose ACTH vs low-dose ACTH stimulation tests for
the initial diagnosis. Only five studies were available to
estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the high-dose ACTH
stimulation test in PAI, and there were none for the low-
dose ACTH stimulation test. The sensitivity of the high-
dose ACTH stimulation test for the diagnosis of PAI was
92% (95% confidence interval, 81–97%). Data from 30
studies in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency
showed no statistically significant difference between low-
doseandhigh-doseACTHstimulationtests.Thisevidence
isindirectforthetargetpopulationofthisguideline,which
is PAI patients.
The second review compared various glucocorticoid
replacement regimens in patients with adrenal insuffi-
ciency and identified 15 relevant observational studies.
Data on mortality, bone density, and incidence of adrenal
crisis were very sparse or unavailable. In terms of HRQoL,
there was no statistically significant difference between
regimens using glucocorticoid dosages equal to or higher
than 30 mg/d of hydrocortisone vs regimens with dosages
�30 mg/d. Very low-quality evidence (comparison across
studies, methodological limitations, and substantial het-
erogeneity) suggested that extended-release and dual-re-
lease forms of glucocorticoids may have higher HRQoL
scores compared with forms given once, twice, or three
times daily. This evidence was considered insufficient for
decision-making and required verification in a random-
ized trial.
Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency
The diagnosis of PAI is traditionally based on low
morning cortisol concentrations (measured in serum or
plasma) and confirmed by low stimulated cortisol.
DHEAS levels (DHEA less so) that are well below the
lower limit of normal for age and sex are a useful initial
sign of PAI that should not be overlooked, although they
cannot be used in isolation to make the diagnosis of PAI
because levels may be low in some individuals, especially
in older age groups, without PAI. In most cases, the diag-
nosis is highly likely if the cortisol is �140 nmol/L (5
�g/dL) (18) in combination with an ACTH concentration
(measured in plasma) elevated more than 2-fold above the
upper limit of the reference interval for the specific assay.
An ACTH value �66 pmol/L represents a maximum stim-
ulus for cortisol secretion (19, 20). For confirmation, a
corticotropin stimulation test should be performed in
most cases unless basal results are absolutely unequivocal.
The corticotropin stimulation test is currently regarded
as the diagnostic “gold standard” for the diagnosis of pri-
mary (but not secondary) adrenal insufficiency because it
has been reasonably well studied and is validated against
the insulin tolerance test for diagnostic accuracy (21–25).
This test is also known as the cosyntropin test, ACTH test,
or short Synacthen test; Synacthen is the trade name of
tetracosactide, a synthetic peptide consisting of the first 24
of the 39 amino acids of the endogenous ACTH peptide.
However, there is still some ongoing debate over the def-
inition of the cutoff value of cortisol after corticotropin
stimulation to exclude PAI (see below). The test is used in
clinical practice with different protocols, mainly in the
duration of the test procedure, the route of administration
(im or iv), and the dose of corticotropin applied (26, 27).
Commonly, the standard short corticotropin test is per-
formed measuring cortisol levels before and 30 or 60 min-
utes after iv (or im) administration of 250 �g corticotropin
as bolus injection (28). The standard-dose (250 �g) short
corticotropin test is a common diagnostic test in clinical
practice with a high degree of validation. Another varia-
tion of the cosyntropin test uses a low-dose 1 �g of cor-
ticotropin for adrenal stimulation. However, based on the
currently available data, the 1-�g test does not provide
better diagnostic accuracy than the 250-�g corticotropin
test (29). It should be noted that porcine ACTH is used in
some countries, although the evidence for its use is much
less than with synthetic ACTH analogs such as cosyntro-
pin (30).
The interpretation of the cosyntropin test is based on
the peak stimulated serum cortisol concentration. The re-
sults of the corticotropin test are not significantly affected
by diurnal variations, and the test can therefore be per-
formed without time constraints (31, 32). However, cau-
tion is required because adrenocortical function test re-
sults may be severely affected by rare conditions such as
cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) deficiency, glucocorti-

 1.0 Who should be tested and how?
1.1 We recommend diagnostic testing to exclude PAI in
acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms
or signs suggestive of PAI (volume depletion, hypotension,
hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fever, abdominal pain, hy-
perpigmentationor,especiallyinchildren,hypoglycemia).
(1�QQQE)
1.2 We recommend confirmatory testing with the cor-
ticotropin stimulation test in patients with clinical symp-
toms or signs suggesting PAI when the patient’s condition
and circumstance allow. (1�QQQQ)
1.3 In patients with severe adrenal insufficiency symp-
toms or adrenal crisis, we recommend immediate therapy
with iv hydrocortisone at an appropriate stress dose prior
to the availability of the results of diagnostic tests.
(1�QQQE)
Evidence
Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis are
well established by older observational studies and clinical
experience and are summarized in Table 1. Delayed treat-
ment of more severe symptoms will increase morbidity
and mortality. Treatment should therefore not be delayed
by awaiting the results of cosyntropin testing.
Diagnosis of PAI is challenging due to an insidious on-
set of predominantly nonspecific symptoms over months
or years. Therefore, it is essential to keep the threshold for
diagnostic evaluation low (2, 37). The exclusion of PAI is
mainly based on the determination of cortisol concentra-
tions in the corticotropin stimulation test.
In acutely sick patients with clinical signs and symp-
toms, treatment should not be delayed awaiting test re-
sults.Itisimportanttodrawbloodfordiagnosticpurposes
before any steroid treatment is given. A single baseline
ACTH and cortisol before administration of hydrocorti-
sone is essential for diagnosis, or occasionally even a
cosyntropin stimulation test may be performed, but
only if safe to do so. Confirmatory cosyntropin testing
can be performed after treatment, with temporary ces-
sation of glucocorticoid when the patient’s condition is
stable (38, 39).
Although it is more elaborate and requires endocrino-
logical expertise, the corticotropin stimulation test is a
superior diagnostic test with a higher degree of sensitivity
andspecificitythandeterminationofmorningcortisoland
ACTH concentrations and is therefore preferred in all
patients considered with the differential diagnosis of
PAI (28, 38).
Other relatively frequent conditions predisposing pa-
tients to PAI include certain autoimmune disorders (eg,
type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune gastritis/pernicious
anemia, and vitiligo) as well as infectious diseases (tuber-
culosis, HIV, cytomegalovirus, candidiasis, histoplasmo-
sis) (Table 2). Adrenal enzyme inhibitors (mitotane, ke-
toconazole, metyrapone, and etomidate) are examples of
agents that may induce adrenal insufficiency. In addition,
a number of drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine,
mitotane, and St John’s wort may increase metabolism of
cortisol. Therefore, in patients using these agents, the di-
agnostic threshold should also be kept low (12).
Plasma cortisol is 80% bound to CBG and 10–15% to
albumin, so disorders that reduce (inflammation, rare ge-
netic disorders) or increase CBG levels (estrogen, preg-
nancy,mitotane)needtobeconsideredininterpretationof
plasma cortisol levels (36).
The diagnosis of PAI in pregnant women is particularly
challenging due to its extreme rarity, overlapping symp-
toms like nausea and hypotension as well as physiological
changes (eg, increased cortisol production during preg-
nancy; see Section 3.0 and Recommendation 3.14), mak-
ing the diagnosis difficult. Because untreated PAI in preg-
nant women is associated with a high mortality, whereas
sufficiently treated patients can expect a normal preg-
nancy course and outcome, early recognition and diagno-
sis is critical. In addition to a paired sample of cortisol and
ACTH, the adrenal reserve is appropriately and safely as-
sessed in pregnancy by corticotropin stimulation, if indi-
cated (40, 41). Interpretation of the diagnostic results re-
quires thorough consideration of pregnancy-associated
physiological changes of adrenocortical function (42). A
strong recommendation for immediate treatment before
the availability of test results (but after the relevant sam-
ples have been procured) is driven by placing high value on
preventing major harm. A practical diagnostic approach
to the patient with PAI is summarized in Figure 1 (14).
Technical remarks on diagnostic recommendations
1. The range and severity of PAI symptoms can be clas-
sified as indicative of adrenal insufficiency or adrenal cri-
sis, as summarized in Table 1.
2. A heightened level of clinical suspicion of adrenal
insufficiency is warranted in patients with compatible
symptoms who also have disorders associated with the
development of PAI, such as autoimmune disorders or
relevant drugs (major etiologies of PAI summarized in
Table 2).
3. There are several situations requiring specific con-
sideration because cortisol levels can be expected to be
altered by nonadrenal pathologies. These include critical
illness and pregnancy. In addition, reduced CBG levels in
illness and elevated levels in pregnancy may alter the in-
terpretation of cortisol levels.

orders known to affect the adrenal function or who are on

 drugs (eg, T4) that are known to increase cortisol metab-

Evidence
The exclusion of PAI is mainly based on the determi-
nation of cortisol concentrations in the corticotropin stim-
ulation test. There are five primary studies that considered
the diagnosis of PAI in their populations and also met the
inclusion criteria of the systematic review. Using meta-
analysis, the sensitivity of the 250-�g corticotropin stim-
ulation test using a peak response of cortisol (500 nmol/L
or 18 �g/dL) was 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–
0.97). The cutoff values for exclusion of adrenal insuffi-
ciency may vary according to the assay used. Different

 immunoassays use different detection antibodies that pro-
vide results that may demonstrate significant bias between
methods. For example, the low reference limit for cortisol
30minutesafterthecorticotropinstimulationrangesfrom
418 to 574 nmol/L (15.2–20.8 �g/dL) (43, 44). The actual
cutpoint used in clinical practice to make the diagnosis
should be based on assay-specific normative data. The
laboratory providing the result should be able to provide
the performance bias of the cortisol method in use. Tra-
ditionally, a peak cortisol concentration after acute stim-
ulation with corticotropin exceeding 500 nmol/L (18 �g/
dL) is accepted as evidence for sufficient adrenocortical
responsiveness (32, 45–47). It is important to consider
other factors that will affect interpretation of the result,
in particular the factors that alter protein binding of
cortisol to CBG (48) and to a lesser extent albumin (49).
Importantly, the use of the estrogen-containing oral
contraceptives will result in higher CBG with a corre-
sponding rise in cortisol (43, 44). Patients with diseases
such as nephrotic syndrome (43) and liver disease (50)
as well as those who are in the immediate postoperative
period (51) or who require intensive care (52) may have
lower CBG and albumin and hence, lower cortisol
measurements.
2.2 We suggest the low-dose (1 �g) corticotropin test
for diagnosis of PAI only when the substance itself is in
short supply. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
Although the stimulated increase of cortisol after 30 or
60 minutes in healthy individuals is comparable for both
low-dose (1 �g) and high-dose (250 �g) corticotropin
tests, resulting in a lower cutoff threshold (mean �2SD) of
500 nmol/L (18 �g/dL) (46, 53), the stimulated serum
cortisol concentrations differ considerably at 60 minutes
between both conditions, with a further rise in the high-
dose test and a decrease of cortisol in the low-dose test (54,
55). Cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels are slightly
higher at 60 vs 30 minutes; however, the 30-minute time
point has been validated against the insulin tolerance test
(56). Further research is needed to determine whether the
traditionally used 60-minute cortisol level is in fact more
specific for diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Although
thelow-doseandhigh-dosecorticotropinstimulationtests
yield comparable results in the diagnostic workup of PAI
and the low-dose test adds no further sensitivity or spec-
ificity over the high-dose test (47, 57), evidence has been
presented that the low-dose corticotropin stimulation test
Figure 1. Algorithm for the diagnostic approach to the patient with PAI. The most common causes of PAI are autoimmune destruction of the
adrenal cortex in adults and CAH in children. These etiologies can be screened for using 21-hydroxylase antibodies and a baseline serum 17-
hydroxyprogesterone level. Males with negative 21-hydroxylase antibodies should be tested for adrenoleukodystrophy with plasma VLCFAs. If
these diagnoses are excluded, a CT scan of the adrenals may reveal evidence of adrenal infiltrative processes or metastases. The individual’s clinical
picture and family history may render some steps in the algorithm redundant or suggest specific genetic syndromes. The latter includes subtypes of
autoimmune polyglandular syndromes or specific rare genetic disorders where adrenal failure is part of a broader phenotype. A list of differential
diagnoses is provided in Table 2. AHC, adrenal hypoplasia congenita; AI, adrenal insufficiency; VLCFA, very long chain fatty acid. a 17-OH-
progesterone �1000 ng/dL is diagnostic for 21-OH deficiency (14). b VLCFA should be measured in the initial evaluation of preadolescent boys.

 provides higher sensitivity in the diagnosis of secondary
adrenal insufficiency than the high-dose test (18, 29). Al-
though similar arguments for the utility of the low-dose
test have been proposed for other special diagnostic chal-
lenges such as the detection of adrenal insufficiency in
critically ill patients (critical illness-related corticosteroid
insufficiency), more evidence is needed to support such a
formal recommendation (47, 58, 59).
Thus, for practical reasons, the low-dose test may be
applicable to situations when corticotropin is in short sup-
ply or for other structural or economic reasons. Although
dilution and storage of the lower concentrated solution
may be regarded as critical, it is worth noting that diluted
tetracosactide (in 0.9% saline at 1 �g/mL) has been re-
ported to be stable at 2–8°C for up to 60 days (60).
Technical remarks
The diagnostic preparation of cosyntropin is supplied
in ampules containing 250 �g, and injection of this
amount yields a very high stimulus for the adrenal cortex,
resulting in reproducible and valid test results. This test is
also usually well tolerated by the patient. The low-dose
(1 �g) corticotropin test requires dilution of the supplied
corticotropin to the required dose, which can introduce
dosing errors and sources of contamination into the diag-
nostic procedure.
2.3 If a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible, we
suggest using a morning cortisol �140 nmol/L (5 �g/dL)
in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test sugges-
tive of adrenal insufficiency (until confirmatory testing
with corticotropin stimulation is available). (2�QEEE)
Evidence
This suggestion is only applicable in acute situations
when waiting for the corticotropin stimulation would un-
necessarily delay appropriate therapy. It should not be
used for community-based screening for PAI. In the ab-
sence of exogenous glucocorticoids, a cutoff threshold for
basal cortisol concentrations of �140 nmol/L (5 �g/dL)
drawn in the morning (6 to 10 AM) is suggestive of adrenal
insufficiency (18). Unfortunately, most of the primary re-
ports detailing this cutoff value are not based on subjects
with PAI (23, 24, 61–64). In addition, the cortisol of 140
nmol/L (5 �g/dL) is typically below or near the lower limit
of the range of normal subjects (collected between 6 and
10 AM) in reference populations for assays in contempo-
rary clinical laboratories: 113–131 nmol/L (4.1–4.7 �g/
dL) (44, 65). As mentioned in Section 2.1, the variation
between different cortisol methods will affect the actual
cut-point used in clinical practice, and this should be de-
termined in conjunction with the laboratory providing the
assay.
Itshouldbenotedthatthechoiceofwhatmorningcortisol
concentration to utilize to rule out adrenal insufficiency
(100% sensitivity) is controversial, with studies arguing lev-
elsfrom�285nmol/L(10.3�g/dL)(23)to�480nmol/L(17
�g/dL) (62). There is no evidence to support the use of ran-
dom cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
2.4 We recommend measurement of plasma ACTH to
establish PAI. The sample can be obtained at the same time
as the baseline sample in the corticotropin test or paired with
the morning cortisol sample. In patients with confirmed cor-
tisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH �2-fold the upper limit of
the reference range is consistent with PAI. (1�QQQE)
Evidence
A plasma ACTH concentration exceeding 300 ng/L (66
pmol/L) provides maximum stimulation of glucocorticoid
synthesis (19), and accordingly, a low cortisol concentra-
tion (�140 nmol/L [�5 �g/dL]) found in combination
with an elevated concentration of ACTH indicates the in-
ability of the adrenal cortex to respond to ACTH stimu-
lation and is highly predictive for PAI (19, 20, 66, 67). An
elevated ACTH concentration in the presence of a cortisol
in the normal range can be the first sign of early-stage PAI
(68). The challenge with setting a specific cut-point for
ACTH levels suggesting PAI is highly influenced by ana-
lytical bias demonstrated in ACTH assays (69, 70). Only
two studies have reported the ACTH range for PAI at
diagnosis with a control reference population, and in these
studies the ACTH was typically grossly elevated in PAI.
Thus, we have recommended the 2 � the upper limit of the
reference interval, but in some cases of PAI it would be
only above the quoted reference interval but not �2 � the
upper limit of the reference interval (19, 20).
2.5 We recommend the simultaneous measurement of
plasma renin and aldosterone in PAI to determine the pres-
ence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. (1�QQQE)
Evidence
Determination of renin and aldosterone can be of di-
agnostic value because in the early phase of evolving PAI,
mineralocorticoid deficiency may predominate (71) and
may be the only sign (72). Thus, an elevated plasma renin
activity or concentration in combination with an (inap-
propriately) normal or low serum aldosterone concentra-
tion is suggestive of PAI (38, 71–74). Both renin and al-
dosterone measurements have a number of important
challenges from the laboratory perspective and should be
interpreted based on the reference intervals provided on
the report (75). However, in some cases of PAI, eg, in
familial glucocorticoid deficiency or patients with milder

 mutations causing CAH, adrenal mineralocorticoid pro-
duction may not be compromised.
2.6 We suggest that the etiology of PAI should be de-
termined in all patients with confirmed disease. (For di-
agnosticworkup,seeTable2andFigure1)(Ungradedbest
practice recommendation)
Evidence
When PAI has been confirmed at the hormonal level, it
is important for therapeutic reasons to identify the cause
of the disease (Figure 1 and Table 2). Autoimmune adre-
nalitis is the most common cause, accounting for the vast
majority of adult cases, and screening for specific auto-
antibodies against CYP21A2 and for other associated au-
toimmune diseases is important, keeping in mind that the
laboratory tests for the autoantibodies are not standard-
ized and are subject to wide between-method variation (7,
76–79). Finding CYP21A2 autoantibodies, which can be
present several years before biochemical and clinical evi-
dence of PAI, strengthens the suspicion that overt PAI is
likely to develop. Following CYP21A2 autoantibody-pos-
itive individuals revealed that about 30% progressed to
overt PAI during a 5-year follow-up (72).
In children with autoimmune PAI, autoimmune polyen-
docrine syndrome (APS)-1 should be considered with eval-
uation for hypoparathyroidism and mucocutaneous candi-
diasis and measurement of antibodies to interferon � or �
that have a high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (80).
Young males and males without autoantibodies should be
screened for adrenoleukodystrophy by measuring very-long
chain fatty acids (81, 82). Adrenal insufficiency may be the
only presenting sign of adrenoleukodystrophy, which most
often occurs in boys between 2 and 10 years of age. In
CYP21A2 autoantibody-negative individuals with PAI of
unknownetiology,wesuggestacomputertomography(CT)
scan of the adrenals to identify infectious diseases like tuber-
culosis and tumors. CT scanning for these conditions is gen-
erally not specific for the infiltrative disorder, and not all
patients with infiltrative adrenal conditions such as tubercu-
losis causing PAI have enlarged adrenals. Genetic diseases in
which ACTH is chronically elevated result in bilateral adre-
nal enlargement and should be considered in select cases. A
variety of rare conditions may require additional diagnostic
measures like serological or microbiological testing (12, 83).

3.0 Treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency in
adults
Glucocorticoid replacement regimen
3.1 We recommend glucocorticoid therapy in all pa-
tients with confirmed PAI. (1�QQQQ)
3.2 We suggest using hydrocortisone (15–25 mg) or
cortisone acetate (20–35 mg) in two or three divided oral
doses per day; the highest dose should be given in the
morning at awakening, the next either in the early after-
noon (2 h after lunch; two-dose regimen) or at lunch and
afternoon (three-dose regimen). Higher frequency regi-
mensandsize-baseddosingmaybebeneficialinindividual
cases. (2�QQEE)
3.3 As an alternative to hydrocortisone, we suggest us-
ing prednisolone (3–5 mg/d), administered orally once or
twice daily, especially in patients with reduced compli-
ance. (2�QEEE)
3.4 We suggest against using dexamethasone for the
treatment of PAI because of risk of Cushingoid side effects
due to difficulties in dose titration. (2�QQEE)
3.5 We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement
using clinical assessment including body weight, postural
bloodpressure,energylevels,signsoffrankglucocorticoid
excess. (2�QQQE)
3.6 We suggest against hormonal monitoring of gluco-
corticoid replacement and to adjust treatment only based
on clinical response. (2�QQQE)
Evidence
Glucocorticoidsaresecretedinapulsatileandcircadian
rhythm, with the highest peak in the morning, with low
levels in the evening, reaching a nadir around midnight
(84). Mean cortisol production rates are influenced by age
and body composition and have been reported to be about
5–8 mg/m2/d (85–88), which is equivalent to an oral re-
placement with 15–25 mg/d (with a tendency toward the
lower margin to avoid overtreatment) of hydrocortisone
or 20–35 mg of cortisone acetate in adults. In most in-
dustrialized countries, hydrocortisone is the preferred
pharmacological replacement agent, but cortisone acetate
is also in widespread use. In a number of countries, only
prednisolone is available.
Hydrocortisone and prednisolone are active glucocor-
ticoids, whereas cortisone acetate and prednisone require
activation via hepatic 11�-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 1 activity before exerting biological activity. Replace-
ment with inactive precursor glucocorticoids may result
in broader interindividual variability of pharmacoki-
netic parameters (89), but this has not been studied
systematically.
Because of the short plasma half-life of hydrocortisone
(approximately 90 min) (90), multiple dosing is recom-
mended to mimic physiological conditions. The first and
largest dose is suggested to be given upon awakening, the
second dose after lunch, and, in case of a three-dose reg-
imen, the last and smallest dose not later than 4–6 hours
before bedtime. The rationale for this regimen is to try to

 mimic the circadian rhythm and also to avoid high doses
in the evening, which may compromise sleep and insulin
sensitivity (91, 92).
Only small studies have compared dosing regimens.
Using the fluctuating normal range of cortisol throughout
the 24-hour day as a goal, Peacey et al (93) and Howlett
(94) independently recommended 10 mg hydrocortisone
on awakening, 5 mg at lunchtime, and 5 mg in the early
evening. Some patients appear to require higher glucocor-
ticoiddoses,butthesemustbeusedwithcaution.Insingle-
dose morning studies of adrenal insufficiency patients, hy-
drocortisone adjusted by body surface area (5.5 mg/m2) or
by weight (0.12 mg/kg) produced integrated cortisol levels
over 6 hours reliably within the healthy control 95% con-
fidence intervals, whereas fixed dosing at 10 mg hydro-
cortisone did not (95). Hence, dose adjustment by weight
or body surface area may produce more physiological cor-
tisol levels in PAI patients than fixed dose regimens. Lau-
reti et al (96) and Barbetta et al (97) found that thrice-daily
cortisone acetate lowered ACTH levels and gave 24-hour
cortisol curves more similar to the endogenous cortisol
rhythm compared with a two-dose regimen. One double-
blind, randomized, crossover study evaluating two-dose
vs four-dose hydrocortisone treatments (98) concluded
that cortisol pharmacokinetics were more physiological
on the four-dose regimen; surprisingly, participating pa-
tients preferred this regimen. Conversely, Alonso et al (99)
found that HRQoL scores were similar and on some pa-
rameters worse on thrice-daily compared with twice-daily
hydrocortisone. Taken together, because few and mostly
underpowered short-term studies have been performed, it
is difficult to make strong global recommendations on
these different regimens. Based on prevailing evidence and
clinical experience, three or four daily doses give more
physiological cortisol profiles that may be beneficial to
counter long-term complications of glucocorticoid re-
placement. Weight-adjusted dosing will increase the
chance of obtaining a cortisol value within the reference
range. However, outcome studies confirming this hypoth-
esis are lacking, and less-frequent dosing may be associ-
ated with better compliance (100).
Rigorous pharmacokinetic studies have only compared
hydrocortisone vs cortisone acetate in adrenal insuffi-
ciency. The absorption curve of cortisone acetate is less
steep and is delayed compared with that of hydrocortisone
(89, 101), which might be favorable considering the short
half-life of hydrocortisone. Although clinical experience
supports the recommendation of both drugs, individual
patients may prefer one over the other.
When PAI patients fail to recover in terms of HRQoL
and working capacity or have difficulty adhering to a mul-
tiple-dose regimen, prednisolone, 3–5 mg/d administered
in one or two doses, can be prescribed. Retrospective stud-
ies of patients taking higher doses of glucocorticoids in
some cases, including prednisolone or dexamethasone,
appear to show a tendency to adverse metabolic conse-
quences including weight gain, dyslipidemia, and diabetes
mellitus (102). However, prospective studies comparing
thesafetyandefficacyofprednisoloneandhydrocortisone
over time are not available. It is the experience of some
physicians that higher doses of prednisolone achieve good
results is some patients. Dexamethasone should be
avoided because Cushingoid side effects frequently appear
(103). Alternatively, a newly marketed dual-release hy-
drocortisone preparation can be administered once daily
(104). However, whereas this dual-release hydrocortisone
preparation was shown to slightly reduce blood pressure
and HbA1c (104), such results may not always be desir-
able in patients with PAI. Moreover, such variability can
reflect differences in glucocorticoid bioavailability be-
tween the dual-release formulation and the hydrocorti-
sone control dosing regimen. Other slow-release prepara-
tions of hydrocortisone are in clinical development (see
Perspectives and Demand for Future Research below).
Additional, preferably double-blind, studies are needed
to fully evaluate possible advantages of these prepara-
tions over current hydrocortisone and cortisone acetate
regimens.
Monitoring glucocorticoid replacement relies primar-
ily on clinical assessment. Symptoms and signs of over-
replacement are weight gain, insomnia, and peripheral
edema. Insufficient dosing is characterized by nausea,
poor appetite, weight loss, lethargy, and hyperpigmenta-
tion. Detailed questioning about the patient’s daily habits,
working patterns (eg, shift work), general feelings of en-
ergy,mentalconcentration,daytimesomnolence,anddips
in energy can help fine-tune when tablets should be taken,
how often, and at what dose. Compliance and use of extra
doses should be mapped. In cases when malabsorption is
suspected, serum or salivary cortisol day curve monitoring
may be useful to guide dosing.
Measurement of plasma ACTH to guide glucocorticoid
replacement doses is not recommended because patients
who receive appropriate replacement often have elevated
ACTH levels, due to disturbance of the normal close
relationship between ACTH and cortisol secretion and
negative feedback. Use of ACTH levels to adjust glu-
cocorticoid replacement is clinically known to lead to
over-replacement.

 ment with fludrocortisone (starting dose, 50–100 �g in
adults) and not restrict their salt intake. (1�QQQQ)
3.8 We recommend monitoring mineralocorticoid re-
placement primarily based on clinical assessment (salt
craving, postural hypotension, or edema), and blood elec-
trolyte measurements. (1�QQQE)
3.9 In patients who develop hypertension while receiv-
ing fludrocortisone, we suggest reducing the dose of
fludrocortisone. (2�QEEE)
3.10 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, we sug-
gest initiating antihypertensive treatment and continuing
fludrocortisone. (2�QEEE)
Evidence
Mineralocorticoids are vital for maintaining water and
electrolyte homeostasis, and thereby blood pressure. The
synthetic mineralocorticoid 9�-fludrocortisone is used as
replacement therapy, but its use in PAI has not been stud-
ied systematically. Fludrocortisone is routinely taken once
daily in the morning, the rationale being that aldosterone
level is highest at this time because it follows a circadian
rhythm similar to cortisol (105). The fludrocortisone dose
is related to individual fluid and electrolyte intake and
losses. A daily dose of 0.05–0.2 mg is usually sufficient in
adults and adolescents with PAI. In newborns and chil-
dren, mineralocorticoid sensitivity is lower, thereby usu-
ally requiring higher fludrocortisone doses compared to
adults (106). Temporary dose increments of 50–100% or
increased salt intake can be recommended in a hot climate
and conditions that promote excessive sweating. In addi-
tion, the patients should be advised not to restrict their salt
intake. Patients on prednisolone may require more fludro-
cortisone than those on hydrocortisone because pred-
nisolone has less mineralocorticoid activity. Dexametha-
sone does not exert any mineralocorticoid activity.
Mineralocorticoid replacement is assessed clinically by
inquiring about salt craving or light-headedness, measur-
ing blood pressure in the sitting and standing position, and
identifying the presence of peripheral edema, although the
latter is of low sensitivity. General well-being, electrolytes
within the normal range, and normal blood pressure with-
out evidence of postural hypotension indicate adequate
mineralocorticoid replacement. Furthermore, plasma
renin activity in the upper reference range has been found
to be a useful marker for a correct mineralocorticoid dose
(38, 107, 108). Licorice and grapefruit juice potentiate the
mineralocorticoid effect of hydrocortisone and should be
avoided (109). Phenytoin has been reported to increase
fludrocortisone metabolism, leading to a need for higher
replacement (110).
Primary hypertension may also be present in PAI (111).
Assessment of the hypertensive PAI patient should involve
an evaluation of not only the fludrocortisone dose but also
the glucocorticoid dose because overtreatment with either
preparation can lead to hypertension. If hypertension
prevails after adjustment and the patient is euvolemic,
angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-convert-
ing enzyme blockers may be used to counter the vaso-
constrictive effects of elevated angiotensin II (112). Sec-
ond-line treatment can include a dihydropyridine
calcium blocker. Diuretics should be avoided. Aldoste-
rone receptor blockers such as spironolactone and
eplerenone are contraindicated.
Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement

with PAI and low libido, depressive symptoms, and/or low
energy levels despite otherwise optimized glucocorticoid
and mineralocorticoid replacement. (2�QQEE)
3.12 We suggest an initial period of 6 months of DHEA
replacement. If the patient does not report a sustained,
beneficial effect of replacement after 6 months, the DHEA
should be discontinued. (2�QQEE)
3.13 We suggest monitoring DHEA replacement by
measuring morning serum DHEAS levels (aiming at the
midnormal range) before the intake of the daily DHEA
replacement dose. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
In women, adrenal production of the androgen precur-
sors DHEA and androstenedione is a major source of an-
drogen production. Consequently, adrenal insufficiency is
frequently associated with androgen deficiency in female
patients. Serum DHEAS concentrations physiologically
peak between ages 20 and 30 years, followed by a gradual
decline that is independent of menopause (113). The ad-
renal androgen precursor DHEA is activated to sex ste-
roids in a wide variety of peripheral tissues and in the
gonads, but it has also been shown to have neurosteroidal
properties with potential antidepressive action in the
brain. DHEA replacement in PAI with a single oral dose
has been shown to restore circulating levels of androgen
precursors and androgens back to the normal range (3,
114). In addition, some (but not all) studies have shown
that DHEA replacement in adrenal insufficiency may im-
prove HRQoL and mood, with reduced depression and
anxiety scores (114–116). A systematic review and meta-
analysis of randomized placebo controls of DHEA treat-
ment have not shown any substantial clinical benefit, sug-
gesting that the current evidence is insufficient to support
routine use of DHEA in women with adrenal insufficiency
(117).
A number of studies have documented positive effects
on libido, and DHEA replacement restores pubarche in

 adolescent adrenal insufficiency patients (118). Studies on
long-term outcomes of chronic DHEA supplementation in
women with PAI are lacking and are unlikely to be avail-
able soon due to a lack of commercial interest and the
ready availability of DHEA over the counter or through
internet orders.
DHEA replacement (25–50 mg as a single oral dose in
themorning)maybeconsideredinpremenopausalwomen
with PAI and in the presence of reduced or absent libido,
depression, anxiety, and reduced energy levels despite oth-
erwiseoptimizedglucocorticoidandmineralocorticoidre-
placement. In addition to looking at clinical efficacy and
potential side effects, the appropriateness of the DHEA
dose during treatment should be monitored by a morning
blood sample for serum DHEAS, before taking the next
dose of DHEA, aiming at the midrange of a premeno-
pausal female reference cohort.
Treatment during pregnancy
3.14 We suggest that pregnant patients with PAI be
monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of glucocorti-
coid over- and under-replacement (eg, normal weight
gain, fatigue, postural hypotension or hypertension, hy-
perglycemia), with at least one review per trimester. (Un-
graded best practice statement)
3.15 We suggest that, based on the individual clinical
course, an increase in hydrocortisone dose should be im-
plemented, in particular during the third trimester. (Un-
graded best practice statement)
3.16 In pregnant women with PAI, we suggest using
hydrocortisone over cortisone acetate, prednisolone, or
prednisone (2�QQEE) and recommend against using
dexamethasone because it is not inactivated in the pla-
centa. (1�QQEE)
3.17 We recommend hydrocortisone stress dosing dur-
ing the active phase of labor, similar to that used in major
surgical stress. (1�QQEE)
Evidence
During normal pregnancy, circulating cortisol concen-
trations are increased 2- to 3-fold, with a continuous in-
crease from the first trimester onward due to increases in
CBG levels (40, 42). From week 22 of gestation onward,
free cortisol levels also increase significantly, with a fur-
ther rise immediately preterm due to a fall in CBG (42,
119); cortisol levels return to normal after delivery (40).
Adrenal crisis due to insufficient glucocorticoid dose ad-
justment during pregnancy has been reported (120). Al-
though little evidence exists on the exact regimen of op-
timized glucocorticoid replacement in pregnancy, one
common approach is to increase hydrocortisone dose by
20–40% from the 24th week onward to reflect the phys-
iological increase in free cortisol. Glucocorticoid prepa-
rations that can be used in pregnancy are hydrocortisone,
cortisone acetate, prednisolone, and prednisone; dexa-
methasone is usually contraindicated because it is not in-
activated by placental 11�-hydroxysteroid dehydroge-
nase type 2 and thus crosses the placenta to the fetus.
The diagnosis of new-onset adrenal insufficiency in
pregnancy is challenging because symptoms are nonspe-
cific and often are not different from those commonly
present in pregnancy itself, such as fatigue, nausea, and
vomiting. The cosyntropin stimulation test is the test of
choice in pregnant women if adrenal insufficiency is sus-
pected. In a small cohort of healthy pregnant women, the
peak total cortisol response after ACTH injection was sig-
nificantly higher in comparison to the nonpregnant state
(median, 1000 nmol/L [37 �g/dL]) in the second and third
trimesters, whereas their responses returned to prepreg-
nancy levels during the postpartum period (median, 700
nmol/L [26 �g/dL]) (41). Thus, it has been suggested to use
higher diagnostic cortisol cutoffs of 700 nmol/L (25 �g/
dL), 800 nmol/L (29 �g/dL), and 900 nmol/L (32 �g/dL)
forthefirst,second,andthirdtrimesters,respectively(40).
Mineralocorticoid requirements during pregnancy are
more difficult to assess, again due to nonspecific symp-
toms overlapping with those observed in physiological
pregnancy, such as edema or postural hypotension. So-
dium and potassium can be monitored in blood and urine,
whereas plasma renin physiologically increases during
pregnancy and therefore cannot be used for monitoring
purposes. There is some evidence that aldosterone in-
creases during normal pregnancy (41) and serum proges-
terone steadily increases throughout pregnancy, exerting
some anti-mineralocorticoid effect; hence, fludrocorti-
sone dose adjustments are sometimes required (121).
However, in most cases this will be covered by the increase
in glucocorticoid replacement dose in the later stages of
pregnancy.
A hydrocortisone dose equivalent to that used for ma-
jor surgical stress should be initiated at the onset of active
labor (cervix dilation � 4 cm and/or contractions every 5
min for the last hour) with a bolus injection of 100 mg
hydrocortisone iv followed by continuous infusion of 200
mg hydrocortisone/24 hours (40, 122). After delivery, hy-
drocortisone can be quickly tapered back to prepregnancy
doses.
Treatment and monitoring during childhood
3.18 In children with PAI, we suggest treatment with
hydrocortisone in three or four divided doses (total start-
ing daily dose of 8 mg/m2 body surface area) over other
types of glucocorticoid replacement therapies, with doses
adjusted according to individual need. (2�QQEE)

 3.19 In children with PAI, we suggest avoiding syn-
thetic, long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone,
dexamethasone). (2�QQEE)
3.20 We suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replace-
ment by clinical assessment, including growth velocity,
bodyweight,bloodpressure,andenergylevels.(Ungraded
best practice statement)
3.21 In children with PAI and confirmed aldosterone
deficiency, we recommend treatment with fludrocortisone
(starting dosage, 100 �g/d). For infants, we recommend
sodium chloride supplements in the newborn period and
up to the age of 12 months. (1�QQEE)
Evidence
There are no published randomized, controlled trials of
various treatment regimens for PAI in children. Treatment
inchildrenisaimedatcontrollingthesymptomsofadrenal
insufficiency with a dose that allows adequate growth and
pubertal development. No data are available to compare
the long-term effects of various formulations of glucocor-
ticoid. However, hydrocortisone has a short half-life and
is easier to titrate in children. This minimizes the adverse
side effects compared with the more potent longer-acting
glucocorticoids. Most data available on the treatment of
children with PAI are in children with adrenal insuffi-
ciency due to CAH. However, patients with adrenal in-
sufficiency due to CAH have the additional risk of hy-
perandrogenismwithundertreatmentresultingintheneed
for higher glucocorticoid therapy; this risk is not present
in PAI due to other causes. Estimates of normal cortisol
secretion rate can be used to determine an initial hydro-
cortisone dose (85). The daily dose is usually divided into
two or preferably three doses, with a typical daily dose of
about 8 mg/m2. Cortisone acetate may be used instead of
hydrocortisone; however, caution should be used because
11�-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity is vari-
able in childhood (123), and it is uncertain whether the
hydrocortisone dose equivalency used in adults applies in
children.
Overtreatment must be avoided, and daily dose should
be adjusted depending on clinical status and growth. The
glucocorticoid dose will need to be increased to account
forachild’sincreasingbodysurfacearea.Excessiveweight
gain with decreased height velocity or other symptoms or
signs of Cushing syndrome indicate excessive glucocorti-
coid replacement. In patients with CAH, glucocorticoid
dosages exceeding 20 mg/m2/d in infants and 15 to 17
mg/m2/d in adolescents have been shown to result in loss
of height and shorter adult stature (124, 125). Growth
suppression at lower dosages is also possible because dos-
ages above 8 mg/m2/d may exceed the physiological range;
thus, close follow-up of growth and weight velocities and
general clinical well-being are most important for dose
adjustments. Measurement of plasma ACTH is typically
above the normal range and is not useful for routine mon-
itoring. Inadequate weight gain, fatigue, anorexia, and
hyperpigmentation suggest the need for increased medi-
cation dose.
Children with PAI require mineralocorticoid replace-
ment with fludrocortisone. A typical daily dose is 100 �g.
The mineralocorticoid dose does not require adjustment
by body surface area and often remains the same through-
out life. However, infants, especially in the first 6 months
of life, require sodium chloride supplementation of 1 to 2
g/d (17 to 34 mmol/d), divided in several feedings due to
mineralocorticoid resistance in the immature infant kid-
ney and the relatively low sodium content of formula and
breast milk (14).
Signs and symptoms of inadequate mineralocorticoid
replacement include poor weight gain, salt craving, dehy-
dration, hyponatremia with hyperkalemia, and elevated
plasma renin activity or concentration. Excessive miner-
alocorticoid replacement results in hypertension and sup-
pressed plasma renin. Monitoring of blood pressure
should be performed routinely. Assessment of plasma
renin should be done periodically in response to changes
in clinical status or if compliance is in question.
Infants require frequent assessment and should be eval-
uated at a minimum every 3 to 4 months to assess growth,
blood pressure, and general well-being. Over the first
months of life, sensitivity to mineralocorticoid increases;
thus, it is especially important to monitor blood pressure
during the first year of life.
4.0 Management and prevention of adrenal crisis
in patients with PAI
4.1 We recommend that patients with suspected adre-
nal crisis should be treated with an immediate parenteral
injection of 100 mg (50 mg/m2 for children) hydrocorti-
sone, followed by appropriate fluid resuscitation and 200
mg (50–100 mg/m2 for children) of hydrocortisone/24
hours (via continuous iv therapy or 6 hourly injection);
age- and body surface-appropriate dosing is required in
children (Table 3). (1�QQQE)
4.2 If hydrocortisone is unavailable, we suggest pred-
nisolone as an alternative. Dexamethasone is the least-
preferred alternative and should only be given if no other
glucocorticoid is available. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
Patients with PAI are at risk of life-threatening adrenal
crises. Adrenal crisis occurs when the adrenal glands can-
not produce sufficient cortisol in response to an increased
need. The major clinical features of adrenal crisis are hy-

 potension and volume depletion. Combined glucocorti-
coid and mineralocorticoid deficiency results in urinary
sodium loss, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, increased se-
rum urea, and hypoglycemia; the latter is most relevant in
children, but rarely occurs in adults.
Under-dosing of glucocorticoids in an adrenal crisis is
potentially hazardous. However, there are no systematic
dose-response-studies, and therefore the glucocorticoid
doses recommended for the treatment of adrenal crisis are
largely on an empiric basis.
Adrenal crisis in patients with known PAI is best pre-
vented by patient education and increasing the glucocor-
ticoid dosage in situations of stressors known to increase
cortisol requirements (126).
In a retrospective analysis of 444 patients with adrenal
insufficiency, the frequency of adrenal crises in adult pa-
tients with PAI was 6.6 adrenal crises/100 patient years
(120). The main precipitating factors were gastrointesti-
naldiseases(32.6%)andotherinfectiousdisease(24.3%).
Similarly, a postal survey of over 1000 patients with PAI
from four countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand) found 8% of patients experienced an ad-
renal crisis annually, and gastrointestinal infection and
flu-like illnesses were the two most common triggers
(127). In a first prospective study comprising 768 patient
years, 8.3 crises/100 patient years were reported (128).
Based on these data, about one in 12 patients will expe-
rience a life-threatening crisis in the coming year. Further-
more, in this first prospective study, a mortality rate from
crisis of 0.5/100 patient years was reported. Adrenal crisis
isalsoacommonoccurrenceinpatientswithCAH,although
detailed data are only available from pediatric patients. In a
cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of 122 patients
with PAI due to classic CAH, the reported frequency of ad-
renal crises was 5.8 adrenal crises/100 patient years (4.9 ad-
renal crises/100 patient years after correction for a neonatal
salt-wasting crisis) (129). An age-related pattern emerged;
respiratory infections were the main trigger in early child-
hood, whereas gastrointestinal infections were the main
cause at older ages. The median time from recognition of the
first symptoms to overt adrenal crisis was 1 day.
The addition of co-medication that alters cortisol clear-
ance could also trigger an adrenal crisis, and consideration
of a glucocorticoid dose increase and re-evaluation should
occur. Initiation of T4 replacement may induce adrenal
crisis due to increased cortisol metabolism (130). Medi-
cations

 has no mineralocorticoid activity. Based on traditional
studies, 40 mg hydrocortisone are regarded as equivalent
to 100 �g fludrocortisone (132–134), suggesting that
higher hydrocortisone doses are likely to provide replace-
ment levels of mineralocorticoid activity.
High-intensity exercise for 20 minutes did not require
additional hydrocortisone in CAH patients (135). Addi-
tional hydrocortisone (5 to 10 mg) has been discussed for
prolonged intensive fitness training in patients with PAI
(136). However, there is no evidence for a general
recommendation.
Values and preferences
The proposed glucocorticoid regimen in the manage-
ment of adrenal crisis places a higher value on the preven-
tion of underdosage than on reducing potential negative
effects of short-term overdosage.
4.3 For the prevention of adrenal crisis, we suggest ad-
justing glucocorticoid dose according to severity of illness
or magnitude of the stressor. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
Studies provide evidence for an endogenous increase in
cortisol during anesthesia, surgery, trauma, and critical
illness, with great interindividual variation (137–141).
Enhanced glucocorticoid secretion in critical illness is con-
sidered necessary to prevent defense mechanisms (eg, cy-
tokine release) from overshooting with concomitant det-
rimental toxicity (142, 143). There are no randomized
controlled studies evaluating glucocorticoid dose require-
ments in patients with PAI during times of increased cor-
tisol need. Glucocorticoid dose is typically based on the
severity and duration of the stressor. Traditionally, it is
estimated that adults secrete 75–100 mg of cortisol/d in
response to major surgery and 50 mg/d in response to
minor surgery (144). The concept for giving these high
doses is not to mimic median values of normal subjects
during surgery, but also to cover unexpected additional
needs if complications occur. In addition, harm from these
doses has not been shown, and direct studies indicating
that lower doses are safe do not exist. In a review of peri-
operative adrenal insufficiency in glucocorticoid-treated
patients, cortisol secretion in the first 24 hours after sur-
gery rarely exceeded 200 mg, and the secretion rate cor-
related with the duration and extent of surgery (144).
Lower doses of hydrocortisone (25–75 mg/24 h) for sur-
gical stress have been advocated in patients with second-
ary adrenal insufficiency (144, 145). This has not been
studied in patients with PAI.
Reduced cortisol metabolism has been shown during
critical illness (146). In a study of 158 intensive care unit
patients and 64 matched controls, total and free circulat-
ing cortisol levels were higher in the patients than in con-
trols due to a reduction in cortisol clearance of more than
50%andreducedinactivationofcortisoltocortisone.The
implications of this reduced cortisol metabolism on glu-
cocorticoid dosing during critical illness in patients with
PAI has not been studied.
During febrile illness, the glucocorticoid dose is typi-
cally taken orally at double or triple the usual daily dose,
until recovery, usually of 2- to 3-day duration (Table 3). If
the patient is unable to tolerate oral medication due to
vomiting or trauma, early parenteral (iv, im, or sc) injec-
tion of 100 mg hydrocortisone is indicated. Mineralocor-
ticoid replacement is not required if the hydrocortisone
dose exceeds 50 mg/24 hours.
In a single-center, open-label, randomized, crossover
study of 12 patients with PAI, sc and im injection of hy-
drocortisone had similar pharmacokinetics; however, sc
injection required two single injections (vs one im injec-
tion) and had slower time to reach a cortisol level �1000
nmol/L (�36 �g/dL) (22 vs 11 min) (147). Subcutaneous
self-injection was the route of administration preferred by
the patients, and the time delay in reaching peak cortisol
concentrations compares favorably with the time from
contacting emergency help until eventual glucocorticoid
administration by health professionals (148). Rectal sup-
positories (prednisolone 100 mg suppository) or enemas
(prednisolone 20 mg/100 mL or hydrocortisone acetate
enema 10%) have been successfully used but should not be
used with diarrhea; they have not been extensively studied
and are not widely available (eg, not available in the
United States).
Assumed values and preferences
The proposed recommendation places a higher value
on prevention of adrenal crisis than on reducing the po-
tential negative effect of short-term overtreatment.
Technical remarks
See Table 3 for details. Relevant conditions include sur-
gery, trauma, critical illness, and delivery.

roid treatment in the event of an emergency. (Ungraded

Evidence
Mortality of patients with PAI was increased in some
(149, 150), but not all studies (7). However, in all these
reports, adrenal crisis was a significant cause of death.
Thus, patient education for prevention of adrenal crisis
and the use of emergency glucocorticoids is greatly needed
(151). However, it has been shown that a high percentage
of patients (46%) were not sufficiently skilled in steroid
management with physical stress (152). Thus, repeated
education efforts should be part of outpatient visits. A
large international survey found that approximately one-
third of all medical emergencies in patients with PAI oc-
curred outside the home. Only 12% of patients with an
adrenal crisis in the previous year gave themselves an in-
jection; over two-thirds relied on medical personnel for
their first line of treatment (127). In a survey study of 26
patients with Addison’s disease in the United Kingdom
(153), only two patients could self-administer parenteral
hydrocortisone, and 10 responders claimed never to have
received injection teaching, although instruction was pro-
videdasunitpolicy.Inasurveyof60caregiversofchildren
with CAH in the United States (154), 70% had received
written guidelines regarding stress dosing, and half re-
ceived injection teaching. In a survey of 254 patients with
PAI in Germany, only 63% felt well informed about stress
dosing (120).
Still, many patients meet physicians who are unaware
of the need for immediate treatment of an adrenal crisis. A
steroid card can help overcome this hurdle. Recently, a
new Swedish steroid card was introduced, with simple
instructions in Swedish and English, and several European
countries are now introducing the same card with the na-
tional language on one side and English on the other (155).
A number of different steroid cards are in circulation (for
examples, see http://www.ese-hormones.org/professional/
docs/ExistingEmergencyCards.pdf), issued by depart-
ments of endocrinology, patient organizations, and the
pharmaceutical industry. Such cards should be issued to
all patients so as to inform health care providers about the
diagnosis of PAI and how to provide treatment for an
adrenal crisis; a medical alert bracelet or necklace is also
useful. All patients should be provided with injectable hy-
drocortisone for emergency use. Training in self-injection
is likely to lower the threshold for parenteral hydrocorti-
sone use. Rectal suppositories (prednisolone 100 mg) are
an alternative for crisis prevention in the absence of diar-
rhea. Strong recommendations for patient education and
emergency care were made based on placing a high value
on reducing the morbidity and mortality of adrenal crisis
and the knowledge of the existing low awareness levels of
patients and health professionals. Measures to prevent an
adrenal crisis are summarized in Table 4 (122).
5.0 Additional monitoring requirement
5.1 We suggest that adults and children with PAI be
seen by an endocrinologist or a healthcare provider with
endocrine expertise at least annually. Infants should be
seen at least every 3 to 4 months. (Ungraded best practice
statement)
5.2 We suggest that PAI patients be evaluated annually
for symptoms and signs of over- and under-replacement.
(Ungraded best practice statement)
5.3 We suggest periodic screening for autoimmune dis-
eases known to be more prevalent in PAI patients in whom
autoimmune origin of PAI has not been excluded. The
optimal frequency of screening is unknown but can be
done annually. These conditions include thyroid disease,
diabetes mellitus, premature ovarian failure, celiac dis-
ease, and autoimmune gastritis with vitamin B12 defi-
ciency. (2�QQEE)
5.4 We suggest patient education about increasing the
dosage of glucocorticoids during intercurrent illness, fe-
ver, and stress. This education includes identification of
precipitating symptoms and signs and how to act in im-
pending adrenal crisis. (Ungraded best practice statement)
5.5 We suggest genetic counseling for patients with PAI
due to monogenic disorders. (Ungraded best practice
statement)
Evidence
The goal of treatment and follow-up of patients with
PAI is to restore normal well-being, stable weight, normal
sexual function, and full professional activity. Regular
medical examinations allow evaluation of the physical
condition of patients with regard to over- or under-re-
placement, the correct dosage of the replacement therapy,
and HRQoL. Questions on family relations, professional
duties, and self-esteem are relevant. Any adrenal crisis
should be addressed.
The monitoring of replacement therapy is mainly clin-
ical. Most patients will attain a normal pigmentation on
sufficient replacement therapy. Arterial blood pressure
should be normal and the weight stable. Orthostatic hy-
potensionindicatesinsufficientmineralocorticoidtherapy
or low salt intake.
Routine laboratory analyses should include serum so-
dium and potassium determinations. Although not rec-
ommended for routine monitoring of glucocorticoid re-
placement, measurement of cortisol can be useful to

 obtain evidence of adequate cortisol uptake. Drugs that
increase the metabolism of cortisol may influence half-life.
Plasma renin activity or renin substrate is useful to mon-
itor fludrocortisone replacement, which should aim at the
upper normal reference range or a slightly elevated value.
Increased prevalence of other autoimmune disorders
may provide a rationale for surveillance, especially auto-
immune thyroid disease, which is seen in half of females
and 25% of males with PAI (7). Type 1 diabetes is present
in 10–15% of patients in Scandinavia (7), but is less fre-
quent in other populations (156–158). Therefore, annual
assay of TSH, free T4, and HbA1c can help in the identi-
fication and treatment of these conditions. Females should
be informed of the risk of premature ovarian insufficiency,
which was seen in 8% of females in a national Norwegian
survey (7). In an Italian cohort of 258 women with PAI,
20.2% had premature ovarian insufficiency; premature
ovarian insufficiency was diagnosed in 20 of 49 (40.8%)
with APS-1, six of 18 (33.3%) with APS-4, 26 of 163
(16%) with APS-2, but none of 28 with isolated PAI (159).
Additional testing can include measurement of CYP11A1
autoantibodies (160), the presence of which is correlated
to premature ovarian insufficiency, although the protein is
expressed in all steroidogenic tissues. However, the pre-
dictive value of CYP11A1 autoantibodies has not been
assessed.
Using
the
less
sensitive
immunofluor-
escence assay of steroid-cell autoantibodies, Reato et al
(159) found that three of 13 seropositive patients devel-
oped premature ovarian insufficiency during a mean ob-
servation period of 8 years, indicating that the predictive
value is not that high. Unlike premature ovarian insuffi-
ciency caused by nonautoimmune conditions, follicular
function seems to be retained for up to several years after
diagnosis in PAI patients (161). This creates a window of
opportunity to sample ovarian tissue for cryopreservation
for further in vitro maturation and subsequent in vitro
fertilization. Although this approach is currently experi-
mental, further refinement and improved performance of
these technologies can be expected for the near to midterm
future.
Other testing to be considered during the annual eval-
uation of patients with PAI is a complete blood count.
Vitamin B12 deficiency due to autoimmune gastritis is
common (7, 156), and vitamin B12 levels can also be mon-
itored annually. If vitamin B12 deficiency is suspected,
further diagnostic workup is warranted (eg, determina-
tion of holotranscobalamin, homocysteine, methylma-
lonic acid, and/or autoantibodies against parietal cells and
intrinsic factor). Because the prevalence of celiac disease in
PAI is about 5% (156, 162, 163), screening for tissue

Measures for Prevention of Adrenal Crisis
Action Point
Intervention
Identify and define the
problem
Steroid emergency card (check that card is available and up to date)
Medical alert bracelet or necklace: “Adrenal insufficiency – needs steroids!”
Educate patient (and
partner/parents)
Sick day rule 1: need to double the routine oral glucocorticoid dose when the patient
experiences fever or illness requiring bed rest; when requiring antibiotics for an
infection; or before a small outpatient procedure (eg, dental work)
Sick day rule 2: need to inject a glucocorticoid preparation im or iv in case of severe
illness, trauma, persistent vomiting, when fasting for a procedure (colonoscopy!), or
during surgical intervention.
100 mg hydrocortisone iv, im, or sc followed by 200 mg hydrocortisone per continuous iv
infusion, alternatively repeated bolus doses (iv or im) every 6 h
Give special attention to:
Explaining the rationale for dose adjustment in stress/sickness
Discussing the situations requiring dose adjustment
Discussing symptoms and signs of emergent adrenal crisis
Teaching parenteral self-administration of glucocorticoid preparation
Enforcing the need to go to hospital after emergency injection
Provide patient with:
Sufficient supply of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (accounting for possible sick days)
Hydrocortisone emergency injection kit prescription (vials of 100 mg hydrocortisone
sodium, syringes, needles; alternatively, also hydrocortisone or prednisolone
suppositories)
Leaflet with information on adrenal crisis and hospitalization to be shown to health care
staff; clearly advise regarding the need to inject 100 mg hydrocortisone immediately iv
or im, followed by continuous infusion of 200 mg/24 h
Emergency phone number of endocrine specialist team
Follow-up
Reinforce education and confirm understanding during each follow-up visit (at least
annually in a patient without specific problems or recent crises; otherwise, more
frequently)

 transglutaminase 2 autoantibodies and total IgA can be
done occasionally, even when abdominal symptoms are
absent. Vitiligo and alopecia areata are frequent signs and
are considered as markers of autoimmunity.
Other less frequent autoimmune disorders have to be
taken into account in some patients with suggestive clin-
ical features. Several forms of PAI are familial. Ten percent
of Norwegian PAI patients have a relative with autoim-
mune PAI. PAI in the context of adrenoleukodystrophy,
congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and con-
genital adrenal hypoplasia follow X-linked inheritance,
whereas CAH and APS-1 are autosomal recessive (164).
Perspectives and Demand for Future
Research
DiagnosticproceduresandtreatmentstrategiesforPAIare
still far from being optimal. There are a number of unre-
solved questions regarding the validity of adrenal function
tests in PAI. In particular, confounding factors relate to
defining adrenal dysfunction during critical illness and
monitoring adrenal steroids in relation to underlying dis-
eases and concurrent medications. Interpreting abnormal
stress responses in a range of clinical situations will remain
challenging until appropriate research can identify factors
that are more diagnostic than cortisol. Two current de-
velopments may be of benefit. First, salivary cortisol has
been investigated in a number of settings and is showing
some potential as a biomarker. There are some limitations
from the collection and analysis perspective, but these can
be dealt with (165). Second, the introduction of more spe-
cific diagnostic testing involving liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) should provide
better standardization in the measurement of cortisol.
Suchmethodsarerelativelyfreefromanalyticalinterferences
associatedwithmedicationsanddietaryconstituentsandare
not hampered by the cross-reactivity issues associated with
immunoassays. Although isobaric interferences can occur
with LC-MS/MS, particularly for some steroids with identi-
cal elemental formulae, such sources of interference can be
avoidedbyappropriatechromatographicseparationanduse
of multiple mass transitions for identification. Another ma-
joradvantageofLC-MS/MSoverimmunoassaysisitsability
to quantify in a single analysis multiple steroids, in some
methods up to 15 or more, thereby substantially broadening
identification of different forms and underlying causes of
adrenal insufficiency (166).
Regarding treatment of PAI, there are even more un-
resolved issues. Despite optimal steroid replacement in-
cluding glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and andro-
gens as depicted above, a significant number of patients
continue to have objective and subjective complaints. This
includes symptoms of over- or under-substitution with
glucocorticoids, reduced vitality and perception of general
health, and reduced physical function, especially in
women (3), which translates into reduced working capac-
ity. There are also a number metabolic or cardiovascular
complications including hypertension (167).
Current replacement strategies do not restore the phys-
iological feedback regulation of an intact hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis. Circadian and pulsatile hormone
secretion is not normalized. There is an impairment of
adrenomedullary function including the regulation of
catecholamines and neuropeptides (168). This has been
shown to correlate with cardiovascular instability, hypo-
glycemia, and physical activity in patients with PAI due to
CAH (169).
Other modified and delayed-release formulations of
hydrocortisone in clinical development aim to mimic the
cortisol circadian rhythm (170, 171). Dual and slow-
release formulations of cortisol may better mimic circa-
dian hormone release (104) but do not mimic the physi-
ological pulsatile release of cortisol. Cortisol replacement
by means of continuous sc infusion using insulin pumps
provides a similar circadian rhythm, also mimicking the
early morning increase in cortisol (172, 173). Subcutane-
ous infusion utilizing an insulin pump can reconstitute the
circadian variation and was associated with improvement
of HRQoL in an open crossover study (173). In a smaller
double-blind study, no impact on HRQoL was seen (174).
Pump treatment is more cumbersome than conventional
treatment and should be reserved for patients who en-
counter major difficulties with conventional treatment.
Because the late night nadir and the early morning rise in
cortisol is attained, ACTH levels can be used as a bio-
marker to assess correct dosing (173). Recently, the fea-
sibility of pulsatile sc cortisol replacement was studied in
healthy dexamethasone-suppressed individuals (175).
There is a great need for large, randomized clinical trials
to increase the evidence base on what is the best gluco-
corticoid replacement therapy.
At diagnosis, most PAI patients retain a certain cortisol
production (176). Treatment of newly diagnosed autoim-
mune PAI patients with rituximab (176) and established
PAI patients with depot tetracosactide (177) has demon-
stratedthatregenerationofcortisolproductionispossible.
Further exploration of the regenerative potential of adre-
nocortical stem cells combined with immunomodulatory
treatment to stop the autoimmune destruction could po-
tentially provide the ultimate treatment option in autoim-
mune PAI.
Gene therapy may potentially restore the defect in cer-
tain forms of monogenic PAI (178), and there is one report

 in the literature on successful adrenal transplantation
(179). A great potential may involve novel cell replace-
ment and encapsulation technologies (180). This may po-
tentially allow a restoration of hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis function and a possible cure for PAI.
However, to be successful with such an endeavor, a major
interdisciplinary effort of physicians, cell biologists, im-
munologists, and material scientists will be required.
