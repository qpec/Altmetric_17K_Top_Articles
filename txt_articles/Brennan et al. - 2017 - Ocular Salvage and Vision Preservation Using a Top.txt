Purpose
To evaluate topotecan-based therapy for advanced intraocular retinoblastoma.
Patients and Methods
Twenty-seven patients with bilateral retinoblastoma (male patients, n = 14; median age, 8.4 months)
received chemotherapy: two courses of topotecan plus vincristine followed by three alternating
administrations of carboplatin and vincristine for two courses and topotecan plus vincristine for one
course, with optional periocular carboplatin. Focal therapy was applied after cycle 2. Event-free
survival was defined as avoidance of external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and enucleation.
Results
Of 54 eyes, 42 were Reese-Ellsworth group IV to V, and 37 were International Classification of
Retinoblastoma group C to E. Eleven eyes were enucleated: one at diagnosis, nine with progressive
disease including three eyes treated with EBRT, and one that developed neovascular glaucoma after
completion of therapy. One patient was removed from protocol with prolonged infection in course 1;
26 patients (51 eyes) were analyzed. At 10 years, cumulative incidence of EBRT was 5.9% (SE 6 3),
and event-free survival was 69.2% (SE 6 27.2). Ocular survival for Reese-Ellsworth group IV to V
eyes was 77.5% (SE 6 21.2); it was 74.3% (SE $ 18.8) for International Classification group C to E
eyes. Vision testing (median age, 7 years; range, 5 to 10 years) documented 20/70 vision or better in
one eye of 23 patients; 19 (76%) of 25 patients demonstrated 20/40 vision or better in one eye. All
patients experienced thrombocytopenia (41 episodes in 275 courses; 15%). There were 29 epi-
sodes of febrile neutropenia (10%). Grade 3 diarrhea was present in nine of 27 patients, and one
patient had an allergic reaction to carboplatin. All patients are alive at median follow-up 7.4 years
(range, 2.7 to 10 years).
Conclusion
Topotecan combined with vincristine, carboplatin, and aggressive focal therapies is an effective
regimen for the treatment of advanced retinoblastoma and results in globe salvage with vision.
Toxicities were anticipated and managed with appropriate supportive care.

INTRODUCTION
Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular
tumor of childhood and represents approximately
3% of all pediatric cancers.1 Most patients in the
United States present with localized intraocular
disease, with excellent survival. Over the past two
decades, the focus of therapy has shifted toward
ocular salvage and vision preservation.
The goals of chemoreduction are to reduce
tumor burden and facilitate local control with
focal therapy. The selection and duration of
systemic chemotherapy are based on the intra-
ocular disease burden, laterality, and potential
for preservation of vision. The most commonly
administered systemic chemotherapy combina-
tion is vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide
(VCE).2-5 Efforts to minimize the risk of etoposide-
related secondary leukemia6 led to the preclin-
ical discovery that the combination of topotecan
and carboplatin was more effective (additive) in
retinoblastoma cell lines and xenografts than
either drug alone.7,8 Furthermore, periocular ad-
ministration of carboplatin results in high intra-
ocular concentrations with little systemic exposure.8,9
The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy
of systemic topotecan when combined with vin-
cristine and carboplatin in patients with advanced
intraocular disease.10 Patients with residual or

 refractory vitreous seeding were eligible to receive periocular
carboplatin for further disease control. Here we describe longer-
term follow-up, including ocular salvage and vision, after topotecan-
based therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Population
RET5, a protocol for the study and treatment of patients with in-
traocular retinoblastoma, was approved by the St Jude Children’s Research
Hospital Institutional Review Board and open to accrual from February 4,
2005, through November 23, 2010. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from each participant’s parent or guardian. Eyes were grouped and
enrollment was based on the Reese-Ellsworth (R-E) criteria,11 because
the study was designed when the International Classification (IC) of
Retinoblastoma12,13 was still being evaluated. Patients were stratified into
three groups: stratum A (early disease; R-E group I to III), stratum B
(bilateral patients with worse eye R-E group IV or V), and stratum C
(advanced unilateral retinoblastoma requiring immediate enucleation with
risk-based adjuvant therapy dictated by pathologic findings). At the time of
diagnosis, eyes were grouped using both R-E and IC criteria. For analysis,
IC group C eyes were combined with IC groups D and E because of the
increased risk of treatment failure in the presence of vitreous and/or
subretinal seeding. Additional eligibility criteria included life expectancy
longer than 8 weeks, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate liver and renal function (total
bilirubin, AST, ALT, and serum creatinine , 33 normal). Patients with
metastatic disease and active infection were excluded. This report focuses
on patients treated in stratum B; results from stratums C14 and A will be
reported separately.
Treatment Plan
Chemotherapy was administered every 21 days (Appendix Table A1,
online only). Patients in stratum B received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
with two courses of vincristine and topotecan (VT; so-called window
therapy), followed by vincristine and carboplatin (VC) in courses 3, 4, 6, 7,
9, and 10. VT was administered in courses 5, 8, and 11. As previously
described,10 pharmacokinetically guided topotecan dosing was provided to
attain a targeted systemic exposure of 120 to 160 ng/mL per hour. Car-
boplatin dosing was individualized after determination of the glomerular
filtration rate, with an area under the curve of 6.5 mg/mL per minute. One
dose of periocular (subtenon) carboplatin (20 mg/2 mL) was provided in
courses 5, 8, and/or 11 (topotecan-containing cycles) to eyes with per-
sistent vitreous disease at the discretion of the treating team. Focal treat-
ments, including cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermotherapy, and
plaque radiotherapy, could be administered after the second course of
chemotherapy.
Definition of Response
Documentation of retinoblastoma lesions during the examination
under anesthesia using RET-CAM (Clarity Medical, Pleasanton, CA) was
the primary evaluation of response to therapy. In addition, patients un-
derwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both orbits and ultrasound
evaluation of the involved eyes at baseline, after two courses, and at
completion of all protocol therapy. Images were collected for future
analysis of tumor response to systemic chemotherapy. Response to window
therapy was previously reported.10 An event was defined as enucleation or
external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Ocular survival and event-free sur-
vival (EFS) were documented per patient and per eye as follows. Ocular
survival was defined per patient or per eye as the time interval from date of
study entry to date of enucleation or date of last follow-up. EFS was defined
per patient or per eye as the time interval from date of study entry to date of
first event for an eye or to last follow-up date for patients or eyes without
events. For patients with bilateral advanced disease, time to the first event
was used for the per-patient analysis.
Dose Modifications and Adverse Events
Adverse events (grade 3 to 5 or any unexpected grade 2) were
monitored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Termi-
nology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Hematologic parameters
before each course included absolute neutrophil count greater than
750/mm3 and platelets greater than 100,000/mm3 without transfusion. If
chemotherapy was delayed more than 7 days in two consecutive courses
because of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, the doses of all cytotoxic
agents were reduced by 20% in subsequent courses. The protocol was
amended after the first 10 patients to implement granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor administration starting 24 to 36 hours after completion
of each course of topotecan until the absolute neutrophil count was greater
than 2,000/mm3 after the nadir. Any grade 3 or 4 ocular or skin toxicity
after periocular carboplatin precluded additional injections. Transient
periorbital swelling (lasting 6 to 8 days) was expected and was not
a limiting toxicity. Oral dexamethasone with ranitidine was provided after
the procedure. Standard monitoring for nonhematologic toxicities was
included.
Protocol Evaluations
Examinations under anesthesia were performed every 3 to 6 weeks
during therapy, at the discretion of the treating team. MRI and ultrasound
were performed as described. Patients receiving systemic carboplatin
underwent audiology testing pretherapy (baseline) and after every
third course of carboplatin. Glomerular filtration rate was determined
by technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA)
scanning at baseline and after the third dose of carboplatin. Visual acu-
ity testing was performed at each follow-up visit using age-appropriate
measures. MRI of the brain and orbits was obtained at diagnosis, every
6 months for 24 months, and then every year for 3 years. Genetic
counseling and testing for germline RB1 mutation was provided for all
patients. Research participants were referred to psychology and occupa-
tional therapy for additional neurocognitive and developmental research
evaluations at baseline and at protocol-driven assessment time points.
Statistical Design and Analysis
The RET5 protocol was a single-arm, two-stage phase II study
designed to evaluate response to window therapy as the primary objective.
Accrual was slow in the first 2 years and then increased; however, with
lower-than-expected accrual and evidence of efficacy (89%) in the first 27
patients treated with window therapy, the data safety monitoring board
recommended closure of stratum B in June 2010. In the ocular survival
analysis, an event was defined as enucleation, and in the EFS analysis, an
event was defined as enucleation or EBRT. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate ocular survival and EFS distributions. The log-rank test
was used to compare survival distributions among patient groups. Gray’s
test was used to compare the cumulative incidence curves of ERBT between
groups; enucleation before EBRT was considered a competing event in the
cumulative incidence analysis.
RESULTS
Patients
A total of 103 patients were enrolled, of whom 101 were
eligible for protocol treatment (Appendix Fig A1, online only).
Twenty-seven patients (male, n = 14) with advanced bilateral
retinoblastoma were enrolled in stratum B of RET5. Most patients
were white, with a median age of 0.7 years at diagnosis (Table 1).

Ocular Salvage With Vision After Topotecan for Retinoblastoma
 (neutropenic colitis) after course 1, and one patient underwent
enucleation of one eye at diagnosis; therefore, 51 eyes were in-
cluded in the analysis. Of 51 eyes, 40 (78%) were R-E group IV to V,
and 35 (69%) were IC group C to E (Table 2). Not all patients had
advanced disease in both eyes, as summarized in Table 3, but all
were candidates for conservative therapy to attempt bilateral ocular
salvage. Two patients harbored a germline 13q deletion. Response
to window (VT) therapy in this RET5 stratum B population has
been reported elsewhere.10
Course and Dose Modifications
Twenty-four (89%) of 27 patients completed all courses of
prescribed chemotherapy. One patient was removed from protocol
after the first course because of prolonged neutropenia with viral
gastroenteritis. Two patients developed progressive disease before
course 3, requiring EBRT. Therapy, which was scheduled every
21 days, was delayed more than 7 days in five patients because of
neutropenia (median, 12 days; range, 8 to 23 days), but none of the
patients required dose reductions. Vincristine-related cranial neu-
ropathy (swallowing difficulty) resulting in modification of vin-
cristine therapy was noted in two patients.
Focal Therapy
Focal therapy was used to consolidate noncalcified portions of
the tumor. Modality was selected at the discretion of the treating
ocular oncologist. Green or diode laser was used for tumors located
posterior or anterior to the equator of the globe. Tumors more
proximal in location to the ora serrata were treated with cryo-
therapy. All eyes received focal therapy: cryotherapy (n = 107
episodes), green laser (n = 18 episodes), or diode laser (n = 408
episodes) after course 2 (Appendix Fig A2, online only). The
second peak of focal therapy was noted at course 5, when local
delivery of periocular carboplatin (Csc) was allowed for patients
with persistent vitreous or subretinal disease. When adjusted for
total time at risk, there was no significant association between total
number of focal therapies received per eye during chemoreduction
and EFS (P = .0989) or ocular survival (P = .1681). Csc was used in
seven patients (eyes, n = 8): four patients received Csc starting
in course 5 (early group), and three patients received injections in
courses 8 and 11 (late group). Periocular fibrosis was noted in all
patients receiving periocular carboplatin, but it did not limit ex-
amination under anesthesia, nor did it necessitate later strabismus
surgery. Seven patients (eyes, n = 8) were treated with iodine-125
plaque brachytherapy.
Outcomes
Because both patients who received EBRTeventually required
enucleation of the eye(s), the 10-year EFS and ocular survival per
patient were the same: 69.2% (95% CI, 0.158 to 1.0). The 10-year
EFS and ocular survival per eye for all patients were also the same:
82.4% (95% CI, 0.484 to 1.0). Stratified by group, the 10-year EFS
and ocular survival for R-E group I to III eyes were 100%; for R-E
group IV to Veyes, they were 78% (SE 6 21%). By IC, the 10-year
EFS and ocular survival per eye for group C to E eyes were 74%
(SE 6 19%); of note, salvage was achieved in 100% of IC group C eyes.
Salvage was achieved in all IC group A and B eyes. The cumulative
incidence of EBRT for R-E group IV to Veyes (all IC group E) was
5.9% (SE 6 3%) at 10 years, with three eyes in two patients re-
ceiving EBRT for disease progression after course 4 (one patient,
two eyes) or 5 (one patient, one eye) of therapy.
Ten eyes were enucleated: one at diagnosis, one because of
neovascular glaucoma after therapy, one with hemorrhage related
to tumor response during therapy, three (in two patients) that
developed progressive disease during therapy (massive tumor
recurrence, complete retinal detachment, and increased vitreous
and subretinal seeding), and four that developed progressive
disease after therapy (recurrence of main tumor and/or increased
vitreous and subretinal seeding). In all cases of post-therapy
enucleation, the contralateral eye had no active tumor. The three
eyes enucleated after progressive disease development during
therapy were treated with prior EBRT. Enucleated eyes were R-E
groups IV (n = 2) and V (n = 8; IC groups D [n = 7] and E [n = 3])
at the time of diagnosis. No patient required additional treatment
after enucleation (pT0, n = 1; pT1, n = 5; pT2, n = 4). No
metastatic disease or secondary malignancy was reported, and all

 patients were alive at time of last follow-up (median, 7.4 years;
range, 2.7 to 10 years).
Toxicity
Pancytopenia (grade 3 or 4) was the most common adverse
effect. All patients experienced neutropenia, 25 patients experi-
enced thrombocytopenia, and 23 patients experienced anemia.
There were 215 episodes (in 270 courses) of grade 4 neutropenia
(80%) and 41 episodes of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (15%); no
grade 4 anemia was reported. Twenty-one patients received packed
RBC transfusions, and 16 patients required platelet transfusions.
There were two grade 4 nonhematologic toxicities: one patient with
grade 4 diarrhea (after course 2 with topotecan) and one patient
with an allergic reaction to carboplatin in the last course of ther-
apy. Other grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities included diarrhea,
mucositis, anorexia, dehydration, emesis, rash, and non-neutropenic
fever (Table 4). Fever and neutropenia were reported in 16 patients
(67%). When an etiology was identified, viral infections accounted
for 40% (n = 15), whereas bacteremia was noted in three patients
(13%; gram-positive organism, n = 2; nontuberculous Mycobacte-
rium, n = 1). Vincristine-induced neurotoxicity was documented in
two patients who recovered function after dose reduction and/or
omission of vincristine. Ototoxicity (mild conductive hearing loss)
was documented by routine screening in one patient (4%); no
patient required hearing aids. Ocular toxicities associated with
paired systemic topotecan and periocular carboplatin were limited to
postinjection orbital inflammation and periocular fibrosis. There
were no sight-threatening toxicities.
Visual Outcomes
Visual acuity was routinely observed. At a median age of
8 years (range, 5 to 11 years), all 24 patients (48 eyes) who completed
therapy had documented vision: 29 eyes had measurable vision, six
eyes could count fingers, three eyes could perceive hand motion,
and two eyes had light perception only. Two eyes had no light
perception, and six eyes were enucleated. Twenty patients (83%)
had one eye with documented vision of 20/70 or better; 18 patients
(75%) demonstrated at least 20/40 vision in one eye (Fig 1).
DISCUSSION
Topotecan was identified in preclinical testing,7,8 supported with
phase I to II clinical data,15-20a and translated into the RET5
protocol, a clinical trial for pediatric patients with advanced in-
traocular retinoblastoma. Importantly, preclinical pharmaco-
kinetic data identified the effective duration of topotecan
exposure19,20 to penetrate the blood-brain barrier21 and directly
influenced the protocol schedule and dosing. Recommended age-
appropriate dosages for topotecan in young children being treated at
institutions that do not have resources for pharmacokinetic guidance
for topotecan dosing have been previously published.10
Ocular salvage was achieved in 78% of eyes with advanced
intraocular disease, when treatment included systemic vincristine,
topotecan, and carboplatin combined with aggressive focal ther-
apy. Measurable vision was preserved in more than 80% of pa-
tients. Furthermore, this approach limited the use of radiation
therapy. Our results compare favorably with those of historical
standards; EFS for R-E group IV to V eyes (IC groups C to E)
treated with systemic chemotherapy and focal treatments has been
considered to be 30% to 60%, although the reported follow-up has
been limited (median, 13 or 20 months).5,22 Ocular salvage rates of
66% to 85% have been reported for group D retinoblastoma
after intra-arterial chemotherapy, but studies have been limited by
short follow-up, retrospective reporting, variable chemothera-
peutic regimens, and a heterogeneous population.23 One report of
5- to 10-year outcomes indicated 35% to 65% eye preservation for
group C to E eyes treated with intra-arterial therapy.24 One ad-
ditional benefit of systemic therapy is the effect on micrometastatic
disease, as suggested by the 20 published cases of systemic spread of
disease after an exclusive intra-arterial approach.25
Preservation of a globe is not synonymous with preservation
of vision. Formal visual acuity metrics, such as the Snellen eye chart
or Allen figures, are only useful in older survivors of retinoblas-
toma. Electroretinograms after therapy have been reported,26-28
but they are not a surrogate marker for vision; electroretinograms
measure retinal function, not how the brain interprets the light
signals from the retina. Although intra-arterial and intravitreal

Ocular Salvage With Vision After Topotecan for Retinoblastoma
 routes29-33 of delivery have been advocated for use in patients with
retinoblastoma, limited information regarding longer-term ocular
salvage, late effects, and vision preservation in these patients is
available. One report of vision preservation 5 to 15 years after
intra-arterial chemotherapy documented visual acuity greater than
0.5 (better than 20/40) in 51% of eyes when the foveola was not
affected by tumor.24 Another report with 5-year follow-up after
systemic chemoreduction with VCE reported visual acuity better
than 20/40 in 50% of eyes, regardless of tumor location (90% if the
tumor was extramacular in location).34 In RET5, 10-year follow-up
identified vision preservation of 20/40 or better in at least one eye
in 75% of patients overall and 67% of patients with macular
tumors (IC groups B to D) at diagnosis. Vision preservation after
intravitreal chemotherapy has not yet been reported. Therefore,
continued long-term follow-up is necessary to determine the
functional outcomes and the role for each of the local delivery
techniques in the overall treatment plan for patients with
retinoblastoma.
The use of systemic topotecan produces pancytopenia, di-
arrhea, rash, and fever, which are managed with appropriate
supportive care. However, systemic toxicity has been reported even
with intra-arterial chemotherapy; neutropenia was documented in
30% of tested cycles (60% of total cycles).35 There is no ran-
domized study for toxicity comparison, but the prospective trial
using VCE chemoreduction by Friedman et al5 provides a general
overview. Patients in RET5 required more transfusions than pa-
tients receiving VCE. The number of central line infections (9%) in
the Friedman et al study is similar to the three cases (13%) of
bacteremia reported in our study, although no episodes of Gram-
negative bacteremia were identified. GI toxicity (eg, diarrhea,
anorexia, dehydration, and vomiting) was similar, whereas the
incidence of vincristine-induced neurotoxicity was much lower
(8%) than that reported with the VCE regimen (40%). A pro-
spective evaluation of topotecan-based chemoreduction in a multi-
institutional study would provide further insight.
Preclinical evidence of an additive effect supports the ad-
ministration of periocular carboplatin concurrently with systemic
topotecan.7,8 The relative contribution of this approach to the
results of our trial is unknown and is under investigation (SJRET6
trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01783535). Concerns re-
garding inflammation and ocular fibrosis have limited the wide-
spread use of periocular carboplatin36 and are being carefully
monitored. Other methods for local delivery of carboplatin (eg,
intravitreal) may provide the same efficacy with fewer ocular
adverse effects (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02792036).
In summary, the incorporation of topotecan into first-line
therapy for patients with advanced bilateral intraocular reti-
noblastoma and the improved rates of ocular salvage with
useful vision clearly support the efforts to translate preclinical
research into effective patient care. Intensification with topo-
tecan and consolidation with aggressive local therapy provide
a significant improvement in ocular survival with useful vision
for survivors of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma. Topo-
tecan in combination with carboplatin, vincristine, and aggres-
sive focal therapy should be considered as first-line therapy for
patients with advanced intraocular disease to achieve globe sal-
vage with measurable vision.
