Research on beneficial consequences of yoga focuses on the effects of yogic breathing
and meditation. Less is known about the psychological effects of performing yoga
postures. The present study investigated the effects of yoga poses on subjective sense
of energy and self-esteem. The effects of yoga postures were compared to the effects
of ‘power poses,’ which arguably increase the sense of power and self-confidence
due to their association with interpersonal dominance (Carney et al., 2010). The study
tested the novel prediction that yoga poses, which are not associated with interpersonal
dominance but increase bodily energy, would increase the subjective feeling of energy
and therefore increase self-esteem compared to ‘high power’ and ‘low power’ poses.
A two factorial, between participants design was employed. Participants performed
either two standing yoga poses with open front of the body (n = 19), two standing
yoga poses with covered front of the body (n = 22), two expansive, high power poses
(n = 21), or two constrictive, low power poses (n = 20) for 1-min each. The results
showed that yoga poses in comparison to ‘power poses’ increased self-esteem. This
effect was mediated by an increased subjective sense of energy and was observed
when baseline trait self-esteem was controlled for. These results suggest that the effects
of performing open, expansive body postures may be driven by processes other than the
poses’ association with interpersonal power and dominance. This study demonstrates
that positive effects of yoga practice can occur after performing yoga poses for only
2 min.
Keywords: yoga, ‘power poses’, self-esteem, subjective sense of energy
INTRODUCTION
Recent research showed that momentarily assuming open and expansive body postures (‘
power
poses’
) increased the self-reported sense of personal control and power (Carney et al., 2010). The
authors attributed this effect to the meaning of interpersonal dominance that expansive body
postures communicate: people who assume powerful poses look and feel in power. The reliability
of the ‘
power posing’
effects has been recently questioned (Ranehill et al., 2015; Simmons and
Simonsohn, 2017). However, other research also suggests that momentarily performing open and
expansive body poses may bring about changes in psychological states (e.g., Stepper and Strack,
1993; Briñol et al., 2009; Cuddy et al., 2012; Nair et al., 2015).

Yoga Poses Momentarily Increase Self-esteem
In
addition,
research
on
the
practice
of
yoga
– a
non-competitive, physical exercise (asana) combined with
breathing (pranayama) and meditation techniques (Sengupta,
2012) –indicates that practicing yoga is associated with improved
psychological well-being (e.g., Shapiro and Cline, 2004; Kiecolt-
Glaser et al., 2010) and positive self-esteem (Sethi et al., 2013).
Practicing yoga postures improves vagal tone increasing bodily
energetic resources (Wilhelm et al., 2004; Patil et al., 2013). This
suggests that performing yoga postures may increase bodily
energetic resources and the subjective sense of energy, and
positively affect self-views. Thus, we propose that comparing the
effects of ‘
power poses’
to the effects of yoga asanas may suggest
an alternative mechanism underlying the effect of body postures
on psychological states. This mechanism may be related to the
effects of the body alignment on the autonomous nervous system
rather than to the meaning of interpersonal dominance, power
or confidence associated with the posture.
Thus, in the present study we examined whether performing
standing yoga poses with an erect spine and a lifted and open
chest (with open vs. closed front of the body), in comparison
to high and low ‘
power poses’
(expansive vs. constrictive body
postures), would affect two major contributors to psychological
well-being and happiness: positive self-esteem –having a sense of
self-worth and the subjective sense of energy –having energy and
competence to accomplish goals (James, 1890; Ryan and Deci,
2001; Diener and Biswas-Diener, 2005; Lyubomirsky et al., 2006;
Swann et al., 2007; Diener and Diener, 2009).
Body Postures and Embodied
Psychological States
Research shows that practicing yoga improves health and
psychological
well-being
(Woodyard,
2011)
and
increases
subjective feeling of energy, positive affect and self-esteem
(Shapiro and Cline, 2004; Impett et al., 2006; Oken et al., 2006;
Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2010), but why this is the case is yet
not well understood. Research points to beneficial psychological
and neurological consequences of breathing and meditation
techniques derived from yoga practice (Goyal et al., 2014). Less
is known about the role of performing yoga poses (asanas) in
improving psychological well-being. However, such effects can be
inferred from existing literature on cognitive embodiment and on
physiological effects of yoga poses.
Psychological embodiment research suggests that bodily
postures and gestures in three dimensional spaces affect
psychological states and attitudes. It has been argued that
instrumental bodily experiences in one’
s environment are
incorporated into abstract thought. Manipulating bodily states
can affect related, abstract thoughts and feelings (Niedenthal
et al., 2005; Barsalou, 2008; Schubert and Semin, 2009; Meier
et al., 2012). Directly related to personal empowerment, a study
showed that people sitting in upright vs. slouched positions were
more confident in the positive feedback they received and felt
more proud of themselves (Stepper and Strack, 1993, Study 1).
Participants who were sitting upright with a lifted chest vs. sitting
in a slumped, chest collapsed position had more confidence in
their thoughts (Briñol et al., 2009). Additionally, upright (vs.
slumped) sitting increased arousal, positive mood and positive
self-views just after the manipulation (Nair et al., 2015).
Recent research attributed the increase in the sense of power
and personal control to the interpersonal meaning of the upright
vs. slouched body postures. Studies have shown that people
associate both erect, vertical (e.g., Schubert, 2005) and erect
and open body postures (Carney et al., 2005; Hall et al., 2005)
with power and dominance. Assuming high (erect, expansive,
open) vs. low (slouched, constrictive body, arms covering upper
body) ‘
power poses’for 2 min increased sense of power,
confidence and personal control (Carney et al., 2010; Huang et al.,
2011; Adam and Galinsky, 2012). It also increased participants’
testosterone levels –the hormone associated with dominance –
and decreased afternoon cortisol levels, the hormone associated
with responsiveness to stress. After performing the high power
poses, participants also engaged in more risky gambling behavior
(Carney et al., 2010, however, the latter two effects were not
replicated (Ranehill et al., 2015; Garrison et al., 2016). In line with
the associated meaning interpretation, Cesario and McDonald
(2013) found the effects of expansive power poses on risk-taking
behavior only when the poses were performed in a social context:
when participants watched photographs of other people while
holding the poses. In addition, assuming expansive poses elicited
feelings of power in Western participants, but not in East Asian
participants (Park et al., 2013). In some studies, performing
‘
power poses’
did not influence psychological sense of power (e.g.,
Garrison et al., 2016).
It is not yet clear why the observed effects of ‘
power posing’
are inconsistent. However, some research suggests that the
confidence judgment (e.g., how easy or difficult it would be
to climb a hill while standing at its feet) may depend on
available bodily energetic resources (Schnall et al., 2010). When
more of such resources are available people may feel more
empowered and positive about themselves. Thus, it can be
expected that performing body postures that increase bodily
energetic resources may result in a greater subjective sense of
energy and more positive self-views. It has been demonstrated
that performing expansive yoga poses increased confidence in
one’
s own performance because it increased positive emotionality
and the belief in one’
s own ability and efficiency (Kok et al.,
2013). According to BKS Iyengar (1965) –one of the best known
teachers and propagators of yoga in the world –standing yoga
poses that emphasize chest lifting and opening support deep
breathing to the lungs’
capacity, which increases bodily energy,
subjective feelings of energy and positive emotional state. In line
with this proposition, research has linked deep breathing with
increased vagal tone (stronger responses of the vagal nerve) and
with physical and psychological well-being (Porges et al., 1994;
Bowman et al., 1997; Pal et al., 2004; Kok et al., 2013). It has
also been demonstrated that practicing yoga postures improves
vagal tone (Powers and Howley, 2006; Goldstein et al., 2016) and
increases heart rate variability indicative of a better vagal tone
(Wilhelm et al., 2004; Patil et al., 2013).
Thus, performing expansive body postures may affect
subjective feelings of energy and self-views, not because the
poses convey the message of interpersonal dominance but
because they increase bodily energetic resources. Yoga poses

Yoga Poses Momentarily Increase Self-esteem
emphasize opening and lifting of the chest and stimulate the vagal
nerve. They are not associated with competition or dominance1
but they are likely to increase physical energy and subjective
sense of energy and empowerment. Thus, yoga poses offer a
good comparison to ‘
power poses’for investigating whether
the association with interpersonal dominance drives the effects
of body poses on the subjective sense of energy and control.
If performing yoga poses increases the subjective sense of
energy and control when compared to performing ‘
power poses,’
this may suggest that the effects of open body postures on
psychological states may be real (which was recently questioned
by one of the authors of the original research on ‘
power posing’
)2,
but the underlying mechanisms of this effect may not be related
to the meaning of dominance associated with the poses. ‘
Power
poses’
offer a meaningful comparison to test the immediate effects
of momentarily performing standing yoga poses which have been
neglected by research on psychological effects of yoga practice.
The Effects of Yoga on Psychological
Well-Being
Empirical findings indicate that practicing yoga benefits healthy
individuals as well as those suffering from various physical or
mental health problems (e.g., Jayasinghe, 2004; Innes et al.,
2005; Innes and Vincent, 2007; Field, 2011; Roland et al.,
2011). Practicing yoga improves mental health in the context
of depressive disorders (Cramer et al., 2013b); anxiety disorders
(Kirkwood et al., 2005); posttraumatic stress disorder (Mitchell
et al., 2014); and schizophrenia (Cramer et al., 2013a). Yoga
practice reduces stress (e.g., Michalsen et al., 2005) and
performance anxiety (Khalsa et al., 2009). Practicing yoga is
equally as effective as cognitive-behavioral therapy in stress
management (Granath et al., 2006) and improving emotional
health (Ross and Thomas, 2010). Specifically to psychological
well-being, research conducted among patients prone to fatigue
(e.g., recovering from cancer) reported lower fatigue after yoga
practice interventions (Bower et al., 2005). Yoga practice reduces
negative affect (e.g., Bower et al., 2012), increases positive affect
and subjective feeling of energy (e.g., Shapiro and Cline, 2004;
Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2010) and positive self-esteem (Sethi et al.,
2013).
However, studies on the psychological effects of yoga practice
vary vastly in the duration of the examined yoga interventions,
type of control group, and type of practice, and especially in
whether or not they looked at physical practice in combination
with breathing or meditation (Field, 2011). For example, studies
that showed that yoga practice increases self-esteem looked
at a 5-day yoga intervention combining exercising, breathing,
meditation and teaching (Sethi et al., 2013) or 8 weeks of yoga
1It can be argued that the names of some yoga poses such as ‘
warrior’
pose or
‘
child’
s’
pose suggest positions of low vs. high power. In order to ensure that the
meaning that could be associated with the pose did not affect the subjective feeling
of energy and self-esteem we pretested the meaning associated with each pose. The
pretest (below) showed that dominance and confidence was attributed to ‘
high
power poses’
more than to open front of the body yoga poses and to all covered
front of the body poses.

20power%20poses.pdf
practice (also combined with breathing, meditation and teaching)
vs. physical exercise (combined with healthy lifestyle teaching
based on modern Western knowledge) (Deshpande et al., 2009).
Studies that showed that yoga practice improves satisfaction
with life looked at the effects of 2 months of a yoga immersion
program combining exercise, meditation and breathing (Impett
et al., 2006) or a weekly 90-min yoga class and home practice
over 6 months (Oken et al., 2006). Only a few studies have
investigated the consequences of performing yoga poses (asana).
Kiecolt-Glaser et al. (2010) showed that one session of practicing
yoga poses in comparison to other physical exercise significantly
increased positive affect. Shapiro and Cline (2004) showed that
a yoga session containing mostly back bends (which expand the
front of the body and chest area) improved affect and subjective
feelings of energy in comparison to a session of forward bends
(which cover the front of the body). In the present controlled, lab-
based study, we separated the physical aspect of yoga practice –
the performing of the asanas – as the independent variable.
Unlike the previous studies, we examined the immediate effects
of assuming standing yoga postures for 2 min only.
Overview of the Present Study
Standing yoga poses, unlike expansive, high ‘
power poses,’
emphasize the lift of the spine and the lift and openness of
the chest rather than expansiveness of the body. Such positions
allow full capacity of the lungs when breathing, which improves
subjective sense of energy and mental performance (Birkel and
Edgren, 2000). Certain standing yoga poses have arms crossed
and covering the front of the body, making them comparable to
constrictive, low ‘
power poses.’
Thus, standing yoga poses can be
compared to high, expansive and low, constrictive, ‘
power poses.’
Yoga poses are devoid of associations with high or low power
and dominance (they are not performed in order to assert either),
but they are likely to create physiological changes that may affect
psychological wellbeing. High ‘
power poses,’
although erect and
open, do not emphasize lift of the spine and expansion of the
chest. Consequently, expansion of the chest and breathing to the
lungs’
capacity may or may not occur when people are assuming
those poses (which may explain the inconsistent results of ‘
power
posing’
). Low ‘
power poses’
emphasize slumping of the spine and
decreasing the size of the chest.
In the present study, in a two factorial, between participants
design, we compared standing yoga poses with or without arms
crossed in front of the body to expansive, high and constrictive,
low power poses, the effects of which on psychological
empowerment have been demonstrated in previous studies
(Carney et al., 2010; Ranehill et al., 2015). The study used a cover
story to divert participants’
attention from the context of the body
postures. Allegedly the study was examining the effect of fatigue
on social cognition. If it is the meaning of dominance that the
poses convey that affects psychological states, high power poses
should increase the subjective feeling of energy and control and
self-esteem in comparison to low power poses and yoga poses
(both kinds, with the front of the body open and with arms
crossed in front of the body, 3, −1, −1, −1 contrast). However,
if the changes in psychological states are related to the effects of
the poses on the autonomous nervous system, the yoga poses

Yoga Poses Momentarily Increase Self-esteem
should increase the subjective sense of energy and control and
self-esteem (both with the front of the body open and with arms
crossed in front of the body) in comparison to both high and low
power poses (a main effect).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Eighty-two undergraduate students in the UK (64 female,
mean age = 22.99, SD = 6.02) participated in the study,
which ostensibly examined the effects of fatigue on social
perception. Participants were recruited via the University’
s
Research Participation Scheme. No exclusion criteria were
applied. Based on effect sizes reported by Carney et al. (2015) and
a similar study that used a different posing intervention (seated
open chested or slouched poses, Nair et al., 2015, r = 0.37),
based on power analysis by G∗Power, we aimed for a sample
size of 76 participants to reach a power of 0.80 in a two factorial
experimental study. Although we expected the main effect of yoga
poses vs. power poses (which would suggest a sample size of 52),
the literature may suggest an interaction between type of poses
(yoga vs. power poses) and openness of the pose (open front of
the body vs. covered front of the body). Thus, we used a more
conservative sample estimation and collected more data in order
to account for possible data loss. Data collection ceased on a
predetermined date, and the data was not analyzed before this
date.
Fifty-six participants were White, nine Black, six Asian and
nine of mixed ethnicity, and one participant did not disclose their
ethnicity. Park et al. (2013) reported that East Asian participants
may perceive power poses differently to Western participants.
However, excluding data from participants of ethnic minorities
did not change the pattern of the results, thus the data of the
whole sample was retained for the analyses.
Design
A 2 (pose: power vs. yoga) × 2 (openness: open front of body vs.
covered front of body) exclusively between-participants design
was used. State self-esteem was measured as a dependent variable
and the subjective sense of energy and control was measured as a
mediator.
Procedure
After giving their informed consent, participants responded
to demographic questions (including a question regarding
participants’experience with physical exercise) and completed
the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire (Rosenberg, 1965) in
order to assess their base-level self-esteem. They were then led
into a lab cubicle to perform the body postures. The study closely
followed the procedure of Carney et al. (2010) and Ranehill et al.
(2015) using the same study materials and adding the yoga poses
to the procedure. In line with the cover story that the study
was investigating the link between fatigue and social perception,
mock electrodes to measure fatigue were attached to participants’
wrists. Participants performed the poses alone in the lab cubicle
listening to an audio recording with step-by-step instructions
on how to assume the required body pose (Table 1). The order
of poses was always the same. While performing the posture
participants watched a slide show containing six photographs of
people’
s faces. Again in line with the cover story, participants were
asked to form opinions about the people in the pictures (Carney
et al., 2010).
A computer-based random number generator was used to
allocate participants to one of the four experimental conditions.
Participants were asked to hold two standing yoga poses with
open front of the body (Tadasana, Urdhva Hastasana, n = 19),
or two standing yoga poses with arms crossed in front of the
body (Garudasana Right, Garudasana Left, n = 22), or two
expansive, high power poses (Superman, Hands on the Table,
n = 21), or two constrictive, low power poses (Standing, Seating,
n = 20), for 1-min each. The experimenter watched participants
through a webcam to ensure that the poses were performed as
instructed for 1 min and performed to the standards modeled in
pictures presented in Figure 1. All participants complied with the
instructions.
After each pose, participants completed a questionnaire
which asked how comfortable, tiring, and difficult the pose was
(answered on an 8-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 7 = very
much so). Those assessments did not correlate significantly with
the dependent variable or the mediator (ps > 0.17) and were
not analyzed further. Similarly, whether participants exercised
infrequently, moderately or often did not affect the mediator or
the dependent variable (ps > 0.70). Thus, participants’
level of
experience with physical exercise was not analyzed further.
Once the electrodes were removed, participants responded
to the questions assessing their subjective sense of energy,
control, and power and completed the State Self-Esteem Scale
(Heatherton and Polivy, 1991). Finally, participants were probed
for guessing (no one guessed the true purpose of the experiment).
Participants were rewarded with a course credit and a chocolate
for completing the study.
Poses
The first expansive, high ‘
power pose’
was the ‘
superman pose’
(Tremain, 2013), a standing pose with hands resting on the hips
and elbows pointing to the sides. The second expansive ‘
power
pose’
was the hands-on-table pose used by Carney et al. (2010).
The legs-on-the-table ‘
power pose’
used by those researchers was
pre-tested for the present study together with all poses that were
used in the study. However, it was perceived as significantly
less dominant and powerful than other ‘
high power’
poses. The
constrictive, low ‘
power poses’were identical to those used by
Carney et al. (2010): a standing pose with hands covering the
body and the back slightly slouched, and a seated position, again
with the participant’
s back slightly slouched.
The standing yoga poses were chosen by a qualified Iyengar
yoga instructor to be comparable to high and low power poses.
The first open yoga pose was tadasana, or mountain pose:
standing straight with the legs together and the spine and chest
lifted. The second open yoga pose was urdhva hastasana: standing
upright with the spine, chest and arms lifted. To make sure
that this pose was not more physically straining than others,
participants held ropes hanging from the ceiling for support.

Stand between the ropes. Stand straight with your feet hip width apart. Have your feet parallel, toes slightly in.
Straighten your legs. Lift your chest. Lift both sides of your waist equally and straighten your spine. Soften the tops of
your shoulders. Keep your chest broad and lifted. Without disturbing the position of your shoulders and chest, lift your
arms in front of you to the shoulder level, and take hold of the ropes. Hold the ropes extending the arms forward on the
shoulder level. Turn the insides of your elbows toward the ceiling. Cross your right/left arm over your left/right arm. Bend
the forearms up perpendicular to the floor. Lift the elbows to the level of your shoulders. Have your chin parallel to the
floor. Look at the computer screen in between your forearms.
The yoga pose with arms crossed in front of the body was
garudasana, or eagle pose, where the arms are risen to be
level with the shoulders and then crossed in front of the chest
from the elbows upward. Participants first crossed their right
arm over their left arm and then vice versa, again holding
on to ropes for support. See Figure 1 for an illustration of
the standards for all poses and Table 1 for verbatim of the
instructions.
In order to ensure that the poses conveyed the meaning of high
vs. low interpersonal dominance and self-confidence, 22 judges
rated each pose on dominance (‘
dominant’
and ‘
powerful’
) and
self-confidence (‘
confident’
and ‘
self-assured’
) dimensions using
a 7-point Likert scale (“
1”= “
not at all”to “
7”= “
very much
so”
). A repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the mean of the
dominance index ‘
legs on table’
pose was lower than for the other
two expansive, high ‘
power poses,’
F(2,42) = 3.774, p = 0.031.
The pairwise comparisons indicated a significant difference from
the ‘
hands on the table’
standing ‘
power pose’
, p = 0.004, but no
significant differences between the other poses. Thus, this pose
was not used in the Study.
The repeated measures ANOVA (with a Greenhouse–
Geiser
correction) for the dominance index indicated that (1) all
open front of the body poses were seen as more dominant
than all covered front of the body poses and (2) the open
front of the body, high, ‘
power poses’were perceived as
more dominant than the open front of the body yoga poses,
F(2.06,43.24) = 30.88, p < 0.001, η2
p
= 0.60 (Bonferroni
correction, significant ps < 0.002). There was no significant
difference between dominance attributed to covered, low ‘
power
poses’and covered yoga poses, p = 1. A repeated measures
ANOVA for the confidence index showed that (1) all open front
of the body poses were seen as more self-confident than all
covered front of the body poses and (2) the open, high ‘
power
poses’

ps < 0.046), F(2.10,44.12) = 29.55, p < 0.001, η2

(Table 2).
These results are in line with previous studies that indicate that
people in erect, expansive body postures with open front of the
body are attributed with more power than people in slouched and
constrictive body postures (e.g., Carney et al., 2005; Hall et al.,
2005). However, these results also show that people in open yoga
poses are seen as less dominant and self-confident than people
assuming ‘
high power poses.’

Measures
Trait self-esteem
Participants’baseline trait self-esteem was measured by the 10
item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). Participants
responded on a scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly
agree) to items such as “I feel that I have a number of good
qualities” or “I certainly feel useless at times” (reversely coded)
(α = 0.88, M = 1.98, SD = 0.5).
State self-esteem
State self-esteem was assessed by the 20 item State Self-Esteem
Scale (Heatherton and Polivy, 1991). Participants responded on
a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) to items pertaining
to how they felt about themselves in the present moment: “I
feel confident about my abilities” or “I feel that others respect and
admire me,
” (α = 0.89, M = 3.5, SD = 0.62).
Subjective energy
Subjective feelings of energy were measured by six questions
asking participants how they felt at the present moment: “I
feel in control,
” “I feel powerful,
” “I feel energetic,
” and “I feel
empowered.” Participants answered on a scale from 1 (not at
all) to 5 (extremely), (α = .82, M = 2.8, SD = 0.79). The
Principal Components Factor Analysis performed on these items
revealed one factor solution with the factor loading of 2.35
accounting for 58.83% of variance. Item loadings ranged from
0.62 to 0.88.

Yoga Poses Momentarily Increase Self-esteem
RESULTS
Subjective sense of energy and trait and state self-esteem were
positively correlated across research conditions (Table 3). In
order to test the hypothesis that performing yoga poses should
increase state self-esteem through increasing subjective sense of
energy, we first tested whether performing the yoga vs. ‘
power’
poses affected the subjective sense of energy. We performed a 2
(pose type: yoga vs. power) by 2 (openness: expansive, open front
of body vs. constrictive, covered front of body) GLM expecting a
main effect of yoga poses. The analyses included trait self-esteem
as a covariate. Trait self-esteem was found to correlate with state
self-esteem and subjective sense of energy. This is in accordance
with previous studies, which have shown trait self-esteem to be
related to psychological sense of power (e.g., Lecomte et al., 1997,
1999; Corrigan et al., 1999). Thus, controlling the variance due
to trait self-esteem in subjective sense of energy allowed us to
make a clearer assessment of the variance due to the experimental
manipulation of body postures3. This analysis produced a non-
significant main effect of openness of the pose, F(1,77) = 0.06,
p = 0.81, η2
p = 0.001, and a significant main effect of pose type,
F(1,77) = 6.18, p = 0.015, η2
p = 0.07. The interaction of pose
type and openness was non-significant, F(1,77) = 0.01, p = 0.94,
η2
p < 0.001. The mean estimates presented in Table 4 indicate
that the subjective sense of energy was higher after performing
all yoga poses in comparison to all ‘
power poses.’
This effect was
not driven by decreased sense of energy after performing ‘
low
power poses,’
as the difference in the means of the sense of energy
between ‘
high’
and ‘
low power poses’
was negligible (Table 4 and
Figure 2).
Next, we performed a mediation analysis using a multiple
regression approach and Model 4 in PROCESS macro for SPSS
(Hayes, 2013). Pose type (dummy coded 0 for power poses and

p = 0.002, and the main
effect of pose type was marginally significant, F(1,78) = 3.29, p = 0.07, η2
p = 0.04.
The interaction of pose type and expansiveness was non-significant, F(1,78) = 1.31,
p = 0.26, η2

state self-esteem as the outcome variable, and subjective sense

the pose were entered as covariates. The analyses used 1000
bootstrap samples. The overall model was significant, R2 = 0.62,
F(4,77) = 30.77, p < 0.001. The indirect effect of pose type on
state self-esteem mediated through subjective sense of energy was
significant with a point estimate of 0.11, and 95% CI [0.03, 0.27]
(Figure 3). The results showed the same pattern when the analysis
was performed without covariates. The indirect effect of pose
type on state self-esteem mediated via subjective sense of energy
was significant with a point estimate of 0.17, and 95% CI [0.01,
0.39].
DISCUSSION
The results of the present study suggest that momentarily
performing standing yoga poses (with open or covered front
of the body) in comparison to ‘
high’and ‘
low power poses’
(expansive and constrictive body postures tested in previous
studies) improved state self-esteem through increasing the
subjective sense of energy and empowerment: feeling in control,
in power, energetic and empowered. This effect was particularly
pronounced when baseline trait self-esteem was controlled for.
This indicates that the effect of the yoga poses on state self-esteem
was independent of participants’
trait-like self-view and occurred
over and above the effect of participants’
typical self-views.
The present results are in line with previous research pointing
to positive consequences of yoga practice on psychological well-
being. It has previously been shown that regular practice of
yoga (including breathing and meditation) reduced fatigue (e.g.,
Bower et al., 2012), increased subjective feelings of energy
(Shapiro and Cline, 2004), promoted empowerment (Ojha, 2013;
Vyas-Doorgapersad and Surujlal, 2014), and increased self-
esteem (e.g., Sethi et al., 2013). The results of the present study
go beyond such findings and indicate that the increase in the
subjective sense of energy and control and self-esteem can be
experienced immediately after momentarily performing standing
yoga postures. In previous research, Shapiro and Cline (2004)
showed that 90 min sessions of back-bending and standing poses
improved positive affect and subjective feelings of energy. The
present research indicates that 2 min of standing with an erect
spine and lifted chest increased the subjective sense of energy and
self-esteem in comparison to four other open and constrictive,
standing and seated body postures. While Shapiro and Cline
(2004) noted that the immediate positive effects of yoga may be
apparent for about 2 h following a yoga class, the duration of the
immediate effects of only briefly assuming yoga poses had not
been examined.
The current findings suggest that momentarily performing
standing yoga poses (in comparison to other standing and seated
body postures) increases subjective sense of energy which in
turn increases positive self-view. Although further studies are
needed to investigate the physiological correlates of this effect,
the present findings are in line with previous studies suggesting
that yoga practice stimulates the vagal nerve (Wilhelm et al., 2004;

whose improved tone is related to increased subjective feelings of
energy and well-being (Kok et al., 2013) and higher self-esteem
(Martens et al., 2008). Seen from this perspective, the present
results are also in line with studies demonstrating that even short
interventions may improve the vagal tone and bring associated
positive outcomes (Mäkinen et al., 2008; Kok and Fredrickson,
2010; Kok et al., 2013). The present findings indicating that even
momentarily performing yoga poses significantly increased the
subjective sense of energy and control and increased the self-
esteem may hold important implications for those who practice
yoga or work on creating yoga-based intervention programs for
individuals suffering from mental or physical disorders and also
on programs aiming at improving the psychological well-being
of healthy populations. The present findings suggest that even
short practice of simplified yoga poses can have positive effects
on well-being and self-views.
The results of the current study are not consistent with
the proposition that the meaning of body postures – their
association with interpersonal dominance –drives their effects
on the subjective sense of empowerment and self-esteem. The
pre-test of the poses for the British study indicated that people
performing expansive ‘
power poses’
were seen as more powerful
and dominant than those performing ‘
low power,’constrictive
poses and those performing all yoga poses (with the chest open
and with the arms crossed in front of the body). However, the
increase in the subjective sense of energy and self-esteem was not
observed in the ‘
high power’
postures condition in comparison to
all other conditions. If the effects of body postures were driven by
the fact that all expansive and open body postures communicate
self-confidence or dominance (which was not confirmed by the
pre-test), a main effect for the openness of the pose would have
been expected (or the specific contrast of high power poses being
the most effective). However, no such effects were observed.
The increases in the subjective sense of energy and control and
self-esteem were observed when all yoga poses were performed.
This suggests that another mechanism drives the effect of open
body postures on the subjective sense of empowerment and self-
esteem, before the effect of the meaning of the pose can be
observed.

Yoga Poses Momentarily Increase Self-esteem
There was also no noticeable drop in the subjective sense of
energy or state self-esteem in the ‘
low power poses’condition
relative to the ‘
high power poses’
condition. This suggests that
the differences between yoga and power poses were unlikely
to be driven by ‘
low power,’constrictive poses decreasing the
subjective sense of energy or state self-esteem. The lack of
observed differences between constrictive and expansive yoga
poses might be due to the fact that even the constrictive yoga
pose – crossing the arms across the front of the body – may
still expand the chest and holds the spine erect. This pose is
not as constrictive and back-rounding as those used in previous
research.
The study is not without limitations that render cautious
interpretation of its preliminary results. Firstly, it tested the
effects of only four yoga poses. It has been estimated that there
are roughly 840,000 asanas, approximately 84 of which are used
regularly in yoga practice (Jayasinghe, 2004). The presented poses
were chosen to be as similar to the ‘
power poses’as possible
and easy to perform. It is possible that some yoga poses might
affect psychological states differently, and further research is
warranted to investigate this. The study also did not control for
the possibility that yoga poses may have benefits due to placebo,
brought about by positive expectations associated with yoga.
However, as participants did not know the real purpose and aims
of the experiment and were not informed they were performing
yoga poses, it is likely that the observed effects resulted from the
poses alone.
The study did not control for the level of experience in
yoga practice which might have affected how participants
performed the poses. However, the study used the random
assignment to experimental conditions which should prevent the
confounding effect of yoga practice. In addition, participants’
level of experience with physical exercise was not related to the
state self-esteem or the subjective sense of energy which increases
our confidence in the results pointing to the momentary effects of
yoga postures.
It is important to note the variations in the way the yoga poses
were performed. Participants held ropes in the standing poses and
performed the poses in front of the computer screen. The former
variation was added in order to make the yoga poses comparable
to ‘
power poses’in the level of difficulty as unassisted urdhva
hastasana and garudasana require muscle strength and flexibility
which are not crucial to perform the ‘
power poses.’
Indeed there
were no differences between the poses in the perceived level of
difficulty or discomfort. Yoga poses, especially as instructed by
BKS Iyengar, are often performed with the use of props in order to
emphasize alignment over the individual skill or fitness. Thus, the
use of props should have not distracted but rather facilitated the
proper alignment in the pose. Poses were performed in front of
the computer because the study followed closely the methodology
of the ‘
power posing’
studies. Arguably, yoga poses might have
not been typically performed in the presence of screens; however,
nowadays it is not uncommon for yoga to be practiced in gyms.
Whether the effects of the practice are undermined by this
context remains an empirical question.
Finally, despite the fact that the sample size was appropriate
according to the estimation performed a priori based on the
existing literature, replication of the study would be desirable.
Although the sample size was comparable to those used in
previous studies investigating the effects of body postures on
psychological well-being (Nair et al., 2015) and almost twice as
large as the sample in the original study investigating the effects
of power posing (Carney et al., 2010), recent analyses suggest that
effect sizes from ‘
power posing’
studies –on which the sample
estimation for the present study was based –may not be reliable
(Simmons and Simonsohn, 2017).
Relatedly, the findings of the study do not accord with those
reported by Carney et al. (2010), Huang et al. (2011), Tremain
(2013), or Ranehill et al. (2015), despite following the procedure
in regards to inducing ‘
high’
and ‘
low’
power postures in great
detail4. More specifically, participants did not feel more ‘
in power’
and ‘
in control’
after performing the ‘
high’
vs. ‘
low power poses.’
However, unlike the previous studies, the present study was
conducted in the UK, so the inconsistency in findings may be due
to the cultural variation in the interpretation of body postures
(Remland et al., 1995; Kleinsmith et al., 2006; Park et al., 2013).
In addition, the sample in the present study was quite ethnically
diverse, with 69.5% of participants identifying as White, and
the rest of the sample made up of participants from various
ethnic minorities. Previous studies in other domains of embodied
cognition suggest that some embodied effects may be dependent
on specific culturally transmitted metaphorical associations and
differ from culture to culture (Lee et al., 2015). However, the
meaning of dominance and confidence associated with the poses
was pre-tested on a UK sample prior to the study, and the results
indicate that people in ‘
high power poses’were seen as more
dominant and powerful than people in any other body poses. This
suggests that British participants, irrespective of their ethnicity,
saw the high power poses similarly to participants of the previous
studies.
CONCLUSION
The present study demonstrated that momentarily performing
four standing yoga poses in comparison to ‘
power poses’
(expansive and constrictive body postures expressing high vs.
low interpersonal dominance) improved state self-esteem. This
effect was independent of trait self-esteem and driven by an
increase in the subjective sense of being energetic, empowered
and in control. This increase occurred in comparison to ‘
power
poses’
argued to increase the subjective sense of empowerment.
The findings suggest that the effects of body postures on the
subjective sense of empowerment are most likely driven by a
different mechanism than their association with interpersonal
dominance. Although this results are preliminary, they suggest
that yoga poses can positively affect psychological states. The
results have potential applicability in interventions for improving
4The only difference in the procedure of the present study was one of the high
‘
power poses’
participants were asked to perform. Instead of an expansive sitting
pose with arms bent behind the head and feet crossed on the table, the present
study used an expansive standing pose with hands on the hips and elbows bent to
the side. This pose was used in previous research showing that it increases the sense
of power (Tremain, 2013). The poses used in the power constrictive condition were
identical to those used in previous research.
