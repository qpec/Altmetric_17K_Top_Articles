ABSTRACT
Background: Systematic analysis of dietary protein intake may
identify demographic groups within the American population that
are not meeting the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).
Objective: This cross-sectional study analyzed protein intake trends
(2001–2014) and evaluated recent conformity to the DRIs (2011–
2014) according to age, sex, and race or ethnicity in the US popula-
tion.
Design: Protein intakes and trends during 2-y cycles of NHANES
2001–2014 (n = 57,980; ≥2 y old) were calculated as absolute
(grams per day) and relative [grams per kilogram of ideal body
weight (IBW) per day] intakes and as a percentage of total en-
ergy. Sex and race or ethnicity [Asian, Hispanic, non-Hispanic black
(NHB), and non-Hispanic white (NHW)] differences were deter-
mined for protein intake and percentage of the population below the
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and Recommended Dietary
Allowance, and above and below the Acceptable Macronutrient Dis-
tribution Range (AMDR).
Results: Usual protein intakes (mean ± SE) averaged from
55.3 ± 0.9 (children aged 2–3 y) to 88.2 ± 1.1 g/d (adults aged
19–30 y). Protein comprised 14–16% of total energy intakes. Rel-
ative protein intakes averaged from 1.10 ± 0.01 (adults aged ≥71 y)
to 3.63 ± 0.07 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1 (children aged 2–3 y), and were
above the EAR in all demographic groups. Asian and Hispanic pop-
ulations aged >19 y consumed more relative protein (1.32 ± 0.02
and 1.32 ± 0.02 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1, respectively) than did NHB and
NHW (1.18 ± 0.01 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1). Relative protein intakes did
not differ by race or ethnicity in the 2–18 y population. Adolescent
(aged 14–18 y) females and older (aged ≥71 y) NHB men had the
largest population percentages below the EAR (11% and 13%, re-
spectively); <1% of any demographic group had intakes above the
AMDR.
Conclusions: The majority of the US population exceeds minimum
recommendations for protein intake. Protein intake remains well be-
low the upper end of the AMDR, indicating that protein intake, as a
percentage of energy intake, is not excessive in the American diet.

INTRODUCTION
Dietary protein is required for the maintenance of all body pro-
cesses, providing the structural and functional foundation to sup-
port life (1). In humans, 20 distinct amino acids function as sub-
strates for protein synthesis (1). Nine of these amino acids are
essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized by the body
and must be acquired from the diet (1). The Dietary Reference
Intakes (DRIs) for protein, which include the Estimated Average
Requirement (EAR; children aged 1–3 y: 0.87, children aged 4–
13 y: 0.76, boys aged 14–18 y: 0.73, girls aged 14–18 y: 0.71,
adults aged ≥19 y: 0.66 g protein · kg–1 · d–1) and Recommended
Dietary Allowance (RDA; children aged 1–3 y: 1.05, children

aged 4–13 y: 0.95, boys and girls aged 14–18 y: 0.85, adults aged
≥19 y, 0.80 g protein · kg–1 · d–1), quantify specific nutrient in-
take requirements that are the basis for assessing and planning
adequate diets for individuals and populations (1). An inability
to meet the EAR or RDA for any one essential amino acid can
be detrimental, leading to a negative nitrogen balance and a loss
of functional body proteins (2–5). This is particularly important
in populations that are susceptible to loss of muscle mass and
physical function (6–9). An analysis of 2003–2004 NHANES
data showed that 7–9% of older (aged ≥51 y) females and 8%
of young (aged 9–18 y) females were not meeting the EAR for
protein (10). Characterization of protein intake patterns provides
information to inform both policy guidelines and nutrition coun-
seling for various demographics of the US population.
The apparent popularity of diets that are higher in protein has
increased over the past 2 decades. There has been a change from
the idea that higher-protein diets (for adults, >0.8 g protein ·kg–1
· d–1 and ≤35% of total energy) only benefit athletes to an under-
standing of the broader health advantages. In 2015, the Food and
Health Survey reported 89% of Americans agreed with the state-
ment “it is important to get enough protein in the diet,” 81% with
“protein can help maintain muscle during aging,” and 65% with
“high protein diets can help with weight loss” (11). Protein has
been shown to promote weight loss and maintenance while pre-
serving muscle mass (12–14). Increased protein intake is associ-
ated with lower body weight, BMI, and waist circumference and
higher HDL cholesterol levels (15). In the United States, market
trends indicate that protein-containing food product sales have
grown from ∼$600 million in 2008 to ∼$1.1 billion in 2013
and are projected to reach ∼$1.6 billion in 2018 (16). Whether
widespread awareness regarding the advantages of dietary pro-
tein and increased availability of protein-containing food prod-
ucts have influenced dietary protein intake trends in the US pop-
ulation is unknown.
The current study, a systematic update to our previous work
(10), characterizes protein intake trends over the past 14 y (2001–
2014) and assesses recent (2011–2014) conformity with protein-
specific DRIs according to age, sex, race, and ethnicity in the
US population. Importantly, this study evaluates protein intake
trends and DRI conformity parameters by race and ethnicity and
in Americans aged ≥80 y, allowing identification of demographic
groups that may be particularly vulnerable to inadequate protein
intake.
METHODS
NHANES is a large ongoing dietary survey of a nationally
representative sample of the non-institutionalized US population.
The data are collected and released by the National Center for
Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, every 2 y. The Research Ethics Review Board at the
National Center for Health Statistics approved the survey pro-
tocol and all participants or proxies provided written informed
consent. Detailed descriptions of the survey design and the data
collection procedures are reported elsewhere (17). The current
trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com)
as ISRCTN76534484.
Data from NHANES 2001–2014 were used to determine mean
protein intakes during the entire period (2001–2014) and for
each 2-y cycle (2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008,
2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2013–2014). The study sample included
individuals (n = 57,980; aged ≥2 y) with complete and reli-
able dietary records using the USDA automated multiple-pass
method (Supplemental Figure 1). Pregnant or lactating females
(n = 1442) and individuals consuming no calories (n = 34)
were excluded. Individuals were grouped by DRI-specific age
and sex categories (1). Overall and cycle-specific protein intake
means were determined using data from the first 24-h recall. Cy-
cle trends were evaluated using regression analyses with cycle as
the independent variable and regression coefficient (β) represent-
ing change over time.
Data from NHANES 2011–2014 (n = 15,829; aged ≥2 y) were
used to determine current protein intake by age (2–18, ≥19, ≥51,
and ≥71 y), sex, and race/ethnicity [Asian, non-Hispanic black
(NHB), Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white (NHW)]. Usual intake
means were derived from 2 nonconsecutive 24-h recalls, one in
person and the other via telephone, using the National Cancer
Institute method (18). Usual intake analyses were conducted sep-
arately for each ethnicity group and stratified by age and sex. The
covariates used were weekday/weekend intake day and DRI age
groups (with 2 additional groups: ages 71–79 and ≥80 y). Ethnic-
ity was added as a covariate for the ethnicity = all group, and sex
was added as a covariate in the analysis of children. Differences
in usual protein intake between sex and race or ethnicity groups
were evaluated using a z statistic, with P ≤ 0.01 considered sig-
nificant. Data from NHANES 2011–2014 were also used to de-
termine the percentage of the population consuming less than the
EAR, RDA, and Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range
(AMDR) and more than the AMDR for age, sex, and race or eth-
nicity group. Individuals with missing race or ethnicity data or
marking “Other Race” on the survey (n = 652) were omitted from
the race or ethnicity-specific analyses.
Protein intake is presented 3 ways: 1) grams of protein per day,
2) grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight (IBW),
and 3) percentage of energy from protein. For grams of protein
per kilogram of IBW calculations, body weights were adjusted to
the nearest IBW. For example, for adults who were overweight or
obese, body weights were adjusted to a BMI (kg/m2) of 24.9, and
for adults who were underweight, body weights were adjusted to
a BMI of 18.5. For children whose weights were less than the
5th percentile for BMI for age, body weight was adjusted to 5%
of BMI for age. For children whose weights were greater than
the 85th percentile for BMI for age, body weight was adjusted to
84.9%. IBW was used, rather than actual body weight, to align
with previous work (10).
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and SUDAAN release 11.0 (Research Triangle Insti-
tute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Appropriate sample weights
were used to adjust for the complex sample design of NHANES.
Data are presented as mean ± SE, unless stated otherwise.
RESULTS
Absolute protein intake was lowest in children aged 2–3 y
(55.3 ± 0.9 g/d) and highest in adults aged 19–30 y (88.2 ± 1.1
g/d; Figure 1). Relative protein intake was lowest in adults aged
≥71 y (1.10 ± 0.01 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1) and highest in children
aged 2–3 y (3.63 ± 0.07 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1). Protein intake, as
a percentage of total energy intake, ranged from 14% to 16%
across all age groups. The only population to have a significant,

Usual protein intake (mean ± SE) by age in the US popula-
tion (NHANES, 2011–2014; n = 15,829) is presented as absolute amounts

albeit small, increase in all estimates of protein intake from 2001
to 2014 were men aged ≥71 y (1.15 ± 0.35 g · d–1 · cycle–1,
0.02 ± 0.00 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1 · cycle–1, and 0.14% ± 0.05%
total energy/cycle; Table 1).
When males and females from the NHANES 2011–2014
cohort were combined for race and ethnicity analysis, Asian
and Hispanic individuals aged 2–18 y consumed significantly
more protein (72.0 ± 2.7 and 71.6 ± 1.4 g/d, respectively)
than NHB individuals (64.6 ± 0.7 g/d) of the same age range
(Table 2). In terms of protein intake as a percentage of to-
tal energy, Hispanic individuals aged 2–18 y consumed more
protein (14.8% ± 0.1%) than did NHB and NHW individuals
(13.9% ± 0.1% and 14.2% ± 0.2%, respectively), whereas Asian
individuals consumed significantly more protein (15.9% ± 0.3%)
than all 3 groups. However, there were no ethnicity or race dif-
ferences for the population aged 2–18 y when protein intake was
expressed relative to IBW.
In the sex-combined analysis for individuals aged ≥19 y,
Hispanic individuals consumed significantly more protein
(89.5 ± 1.3 g/d) than did Asian, NHB, and NHW individuals
during 2011–2014 (81.8 ± 1.5, 81.5 ± 1.0, and 82.7 ± 0.6 g/d,
respectively; Table 2). Protein intake as a percentage of total en-
ergy intake and relative to IBW were greater for both the Asian
(17.2% ± 0.2% and 1.32 ± 0.02 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1, respec-
tively) and Hispanic (16.5% ± 0.1% and 1.35 ± 0.02 g · kg
IBW–1 · d–1, respectively) populations compared with the NHB
(15.2% ± 0.1% and 1.18 ± 0.01 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1, respectively)
and NHW (15.5% ± 0.2% and 1.18 ± 0.01 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1,
respectively) populations.
In the ethnicity and race combined analysis, no children aged
2–3 or 4–8 y fell below the EAR or RDA for protein (Table 3).
A greater percentage of females aged 19–30, 31–50, and
51–70 y fell below the EAR for protein (4.10–5.34%) than that of
males of the same age range (0.59–1.92%). Similarly, a greater
percentage of females aged 9–13, 14–18, 19–30, 31–50, and 51–
70 y had protein intakes below the RDA (6.92–23.36%) com-
pared with males of the same age range (2.31–11.26%). Fur-
thermore, <5% of any population had protein intakes below the
AMDR, and <1% of any population had protein intakes above
the AMDR (Tables 3 and 4).
When males and females were combined for race and ethnic-
ity analysis, a smaller percentage of the Asian and Hispanic pop-
ulations aged 2–18 y fell below the EAR (0.52% ± 0.54% and
1.63% ± 0.53%, respectively) and RDA (2.02% ± 1.15% and
4.19% ± 0.90%, respectively) for protein than in the NHB popu-
lation (EAR: 5.20% ± 0.86%, RDA: 10.47% ± 1.14%; Table 4,
Figure 2). Furthermore, a smaller percentage of the Asian pop-
ulation aged 2–18 y fell below the RDA for protein than in the
NHW population (7.08% ± 1.58%). In individuals aged ≥19 y,
a smaller percentage of the Asian and Hispanic populations fell
below the EAR (1.30% ± 0.44% and 1.71% ± 0.53%, respec-
tively) for protein than in the NHB population (4.69% ± 0.83%).
In addition, a smaller percentage of the Asian population aged
≥19 y fell below the EAR for protein than in the NHW popu-
lation (3.43% ± 0.51%). In individuals aged ≥19 y, a smaller
percentage of the Asian and Hispanic populations fell below the
RDA (5.10% ± 1.01% and 6.03% ± 1.15%, respectively) for pro-
tein than in the NHB and NHW populations (13.43% ± 1.35%
and 11.07% ± 0.91%, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The current study characterized protein intake trends in the US
population (2001–2014) and evaluated recent conformity with
protein-specific DRIs (2011–2014). This report used data from
more individuals, to our knowledge, than any previous study to
quantify the percentage of the population not meeting DRI stan-
dards for protein by ethnicity and race, and in older adults aged
≥80 y. The current findings indicate: 1) protein intake in the
United States has been generally stable over the past 14 y, with
the only consistent increase in protein intake during that time

being observed in men aged ≥71 y; 2) Asian and Hispanic popu-
lations aged ≥19 y have greater relative protein intake than NHB
and NHW populations of the same age, whereas there were no
race or ethnicity differences for relative protein intake in the 2–
18 y population; 3) adolescent females (14–18 y) and older NHB
men (≥71 y) have the greatest percentage of the population below
EAR and RDA recommendations; and 4) <1% of any population
group had protein intakes above the AMDR for protein.
The current analysis shows that protein intake has remained
largely unchanged over the past 14 y, despite widespread pub-
licity regarding protein-related health benefits (11) and the in-
creased variety of protein-containing food products in the US
food supply (16). Protein intakes continue to exceed both mini-
mum population and individual protein intake requirements (i.e.,
EAR and RDA, respectively), but are far from exceeding the
AMDR. The EAR and RDA are based on the minimum intake

of protein necessary to prevent deficiency (i.e., negative nitro-
gen balance) in 50% of the population and 97.5% of individ-
uals, respectively (1); however, consuming protein above these
minimum requirements may provide health benefits (19). Ad-
equate protein is critical for growth and development in chil-
dren and adolescents (1), with some evidence suggesting that
higher-protein intake (19.9% compared with 16.8% of total en-
ergy) in this age group (5–18 y) may improve waist circumfer-
ence and LDL cholesterol concentrations (20). Higher-protein
diets, particularly in the context of low dietary acid loads,
have been positively associated with bone circumference, con-
tent, and strength in children and adolescents (21). In adults,

higher-protein diets promote maintenance of bone mass and in-
tegrity (22–24), preservation and enhancement of muscle mass
and function in response to a variety of conditions (e.g., exercise,
weight loss, and aging) (13, 25–27), and postabsorptive and post-
prandial glycemic regulation (28–31).
The AMDR, which is a designated range of intake for
each macronutrient as a percentage of total energy intake at a
level determined to both prevent deficiency and minimize the
likelihood of developing chronic diseases (1), may be a more
appropriate benchmark of optimal protein intake (children
aged 1–3 y: 5–20%, children/adolescents aged 4–18 y: 10–30%,
adults aged ≥19 y: 10–35% of total energy intake) (19). In the
current analysis, protein comprised 14–16% of total energy intake
for all age groups (ethnicity and race combined analyses, Figure
1), with <1% of any population group consuming protein above
the AMDR. In adults (≥19 y), current protein intakes (15–16%
of total energy intake) are ≥19 percentage points below the upper
end of the AMDR for protein (i.e., 35% of total energy intake),
indicating protein consumption, as a percentage of total energy
intake, is not excessive in the American diet. Asian males aged
≥71 y had the greatest percentage protein intake, at 19% of total
energy, which is still well below the upper end of the AMDR.
Population-wide dietary guidelines and individual dietary ad-
vice can safely recommend moderate increases in protein con-
sumption to optimize health, with minimal risk of exceeding the
AMDR.
The only population to have a consistent, albeit small, change
in protein intake over the past 14 y were men aged ≥71 y. Protein
intake increased in this group by 1.15 g/d, 0.02 g · kg IBW–1
· d–1, and 0.14% of total energy every 2 y cycle from 2001
to 2014. Despite the increase, 4% of this demographic did not
meet the EAR for protein and 13% had usual intakes that did
not meet the RDA. Furthermore, 7% of females aged ≥71 y
did not meet the EAR for protein and 19% had usual intakes that
did not meet the RDA. Adequate protein intake is especially im-
portant in this demographic because aging individuals are at risk
for sarcopenia, muscle wasting, and frailty (32), all of which are
exacerbated by inadequate protein intake (33). Consuming an ad-
ditional 10–35 g/d of protein improves muscle protein synthesis
(34), physical strength and function (35, 36), and lean body mass
(34–36) in older adults. Higher-protein diets (1.0–1.2 g · kg–1 ·
d–1) are advised for older individuals to ensure consumption of
25–30 g protein/meal, which has been shown to produce an an-
abolic stimulus similar to that observed in younger individuals
(37–39). Dietary interventions to increase protein intake in this
age group may improve age-related morbidity.
A sizable percentage of the population aged 14–18 y, particu-
larly females, did not meet the EAR for protein (11% of females,
5% of males) and had usual intakes that did not meet the current
RDA (23% of females, 11% of males). Compared with our previ-
ous analysis (NHANES 2003–2004), in which 8% of females and
<3% of males did not meet the EAR, the current findings indi-
cate a slight increase in those not meeting the EAR for both males
and females (10). More independence in making food choices and
the high prevalence of dieting in this age group, particularly in
females, may contribute to the occurrence of inadequate protein
intake. In a cohort of adolescents (n = 2287; aged ∼13–16 y),
55–58% of females and 22–29% of males reported dieting in the
past year (40). In another study (41), dietary intake was assessed
in preadolescence (11 y) and then again in adolescence (15.5 y);
it was reported that during adolescence, females (n = 643) con-
sumed less meat and dairy, whereas males (n = 589) ate less
dairy but more meat. Adequate dietary protein remains important
for growth and development in this demographic (14–18 y), de-
spite slowed growth rates after puberty (42). An emphasis on nu-
trition education, particularly related to choosing lower-energy,
nutrient-dense foods, may benefit this population.
In the current study, we found no race or ethnicity differences
in relative protein intake for the population aged 2–18 y. However,
relative protein intake in the population aged ≥19 y was greater
for Asian and Hispanic individuals (1.32 and 1.35 g protein ·
kg · IBW–1 · d–1, respectively) than NHB and NHW individuals
(1.18 g protein · kg · IBW–1 · d–1 for both). Ethnic and racial dis-
parities were particularly evident in ≥71-y-old NHB men who

Percentage of the population (mean ± SE) below the EAR
for protein intake by race or ethnicity and age (NHANES, 2011–2014;
n = 15,177) in both sexes (A), females (B), and males (C). Differences be-
tween race or ethnicity groups were evaluated using the z statistic. Different

consumed less protein (0.99 ± 0.04 g · kg IBW–1 · d–1) than
Asian, Hispanic, and NHW men (≥1.15 ± 0.02 g · kg IBW–1
· d–1) of the same age group and had a disproportionately higher
population percentage falling below the EAR (13%) and not
meeting the RDA (29%) for protein. The reason for this disparity
is unclear, but does not seem related to food insecurity. Based
on findings from one systematic review (43), total protein in-
take was unaffected by food insecurity in adults and children.
However, food insecurity may adversely affect intake of specific
protein foods, such as dairy products (43). Future analyses should
evaluate specific food groups and patterns to characterize differ-
ences in both quantity and quality of protein intake by race and
ethnicity.
The strengths of the current analysis include the large sam-
ple size, comprehensive nature of the NHANES database, and
protein intake comparisons by race and ethnicity. However, de-
spite total sample size, analyses for several ethnicities (i.e., Asian
and Hispanic) and older (i.e., ≥71 y) population groups may be
limited by demographic-specific sample sizes. In addition, the
current analysis does not assess source-specific protein intake. On
average, Americans meet or exceed guidelines for total protein in-
take; however, source-specific protein intake is below guidelines
for dairy (all age groups except 1–3 y) and seafood, and only
meets or falls below guidelines for nuts, seeds, soy products, and
legumes (44).
The majority of the US population is meeting or exceeding
minimum population recommendations for protein intake. Di-
etary protein intake remains well below the upper end of the
AMDR, indicating current protein consumption is within rec-
ommended ranges and not excessive. Finally, a considerable
percentage of adolescent females (14–18 y) and older adults
(≥71 y), particularly older NHB males, fall below the EAR and
RDA. Targeted interventions and education may be necessary to
ensure these demographic groups are, at the very least, meeting
minimum protein recommendations and, ideally, consuming pro-
tein at levels to optimize health.
