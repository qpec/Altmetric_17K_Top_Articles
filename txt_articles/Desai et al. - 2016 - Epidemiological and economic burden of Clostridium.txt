estimates from a modeling approach

Abstract
Background: Despite a large increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) severity, morbidity and mortality in the
US since the early 2000s, CDI burden estimates have had limited generalizability and comparability due to widely
varying clinical settings, populations, or study designs.
Methods: A decision-analytic model incorporating key input parameters important in CDI epidemiology was
developed to estimate the annual number of initial and recurrent CDI cases, attributable and all-cause deaths,
economic burden in the general population, and specific number of high-risk patients in different healthcare
settings and the community in the US. Economic burden was calculated adopting a societal perspective using a
bottom-up approach that identified healthcare resources consumed in the management of CDI.
Results: Annually, a total of 606,058 (439,237 initial and 166,821 recurrent) episodes of CDI were predicted in 2014:
34.3 % arose from community exposure. Over 44,500 CDI-attributable deaths in 2014 were estimated to occur.
High-risk susceptible individuals representing 5 % of the total hospital population accounted for 23 % of
hospitalized CDI patients. The economic cost of CDI was $5.4 billion ($4.7 billion (86.7 %) in healthcare settings;
$725 million (13.3 %) in the community), mostly due to hospitalization.
Conclusions: A modeling framework provides more comprehensive and detailed national-level estimates of CDI
cases, recurrences, deaths and cost in different patient groups than currently available from separate individual
studies. As new treatments for CDI are developed, this model can provide reliable estimates to better focus
healthcare resources to those specific age-groups, risk-groups, and care settings in the US where they are most
needed. (Trial Identifier ClinicaTrials.gov: NCT01241552)

Background
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a gram positive,
spore-forming bacterium with sequelae ranging from
mild diarrhea to life-threatening pseudomembranous
colitis and even death [1, 2]. Persons at increased risk
for C. difficile infection (CDI) have advanced age, recent
antibiotic exposure, proton pump inhibitor use, long
length of stay in healthcare settings, serious underlying
illness,
or
immunocompromised
conditions
[3,
4].
Around 20 % to 30 % of patients will go on to have a
recurrent episode of CDI [5]. In addition to the afore-
mentioned risk factors, prior recurrences and health-
care
acquired
infection
further
increase
the
probability for subsequent recurrences [6, 7]. CDI
most commonly recurs within a week after treatment
cessation but can recur up to 6 to 8 weeks later.
A changing epidemiology of CDI in the United States
(US)
and
other
industrialized
countries
has
been
observed since the early 2000s resulting in a substantial
increase in the incidence and severity of CDI, especially
in patients over 65 years of age [6–9]. Hospitalizations

 with CDI as a principal diagnosis more than doubled in
the US from 33/100,000 population to 115/100,000
between 1993 and 2008 [10]. However, since 2009 a
levelling-off or decline of CDI incidence has been ob-
served in the hospital setting [11], which may be attrib-
utable to increased awareness, leading to improved
environmental controls, hygiene or implementation of
more comprehensive prevention strategies. A recent
study reported an incidence of 48 and 93 per 100,000
population for community-associated and health care-
associated infections, respectively in the US in 2011 [12].
These high incidence rates of disease may be due in part
to the emergence of a highly virulent strain of C.
difficile, known as restriction enzyme analysis type BI,
North American Pulsed Field type 1 (NAP1), or poly-
merase chain reaction ribotype 027. The BI/NAP1/027
strain has spread widely after first outbreaks in the eastern
US, Canada, and the United Kingdom [13]. While CDI is
well-recognized as an infection that is hospital-acquired,
recent studies have increasingly highlighted the import-
ance of CDI in other settings such as the community or
long-term, outpatient care settings [1, 12, 14].
Estimates of epidemiological and economic burden of
CDI have relied on independent studies that vary
considerably in their designs, populations, and method-
ologies or have reported this burden secondary to other
objectives, making comparison and interpretation diffi-
cult [10, 12, 15–24]. One published source of CDI inci-
dence in the US reports 336,600 hospitalizations in 2009
but does not include community-acquired cases or provide
estimates in higher risk groups [10]. Recurrence rates have
been variously reported between 3 % and 65 % (with most
estimates falling between 20 % and 30 %), depending on
period of observation, and risk factors such as episode, age,
strain, or other factors [3, 4, 10, 19, 21, 25, 26]. Mortality
estimates are similarly highly heterogeneous with estimates
ranging from 3 % to 36 % [4, 6, 8, 10, 19, 22, 26–33].
The uncertainty in such estimates makes it difficult to
understand the true CDI burden in the U.S. There is
limited information on CDI burden occurring in the
community, although more data are emerging in this
area, as is the evidence of burden in specific high-risk
patients, like the immunocompromised or organ trans-
plant recipients. Economic burden estimates available
from multiple sources vary widely, capturing different
healthcare cost components in the management of CDI
or cost perspective [34–36]. There are limited estimates
of economic burden that include indirect costs such as
productivity losses.
Our objective was to obtain detailed estimates of the
epidemiological and comprehensive economic burden of
CDI in the US in 2014 using consistent methodology
across different risk groups, healthcare settings and
community.
Methods
Model
We developed a decision-analytic model incorporating
CDI epidemiology, natural history and costs for patients
of different ages, and comorbid conditions from several
healthcare settings and the community for multiple
years, drawing primarily on published literature to
inform model parameters. Focusing on year 2014, the
model estimates the annual number of initial and recur-
rent CDI cases in the US by following the population of
susceptible patients in the US and simulating the natural
history of CDI from the index infection and up to six
recurrences in the subsequent 12 months. The model
also estimates severe episodes, colectomies, treatment
outcomes, deaths, and annual direct and indirect costs
for the population. The model was developed in Micro-
soft Excel (Version 14.0, 2010, Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA).
Settings and patient population
We simulated the incidence of CDI in four settings: hos-
pitals, long-term care facilities (LTC), long-term acute
care (LTAC) hospitals, and the community. Since this
study included modeled incidence of CDI, ethics review
was not required. Patients in each setting were stratified
into eight age groups: <1 year, 1–4 years, 5–9 years,
10–17 years, 18–44 years, 45–64 years, 65–84 years,
and 85+ years. The hospital population was further
divided into 5 groups at high risk for CDI: patients
with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), solid organ trans-
plant (SOT), severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
immune-compromised patients, plus a sixth reference
group
admitted
to
hospital
not
belonging
to
the
previous risk groups. More detail of settings and risk
groups is given in Additional file 1: Appendix A.
Natural history of CDI
The layout of the decision-analytic model is given in
Fig. 1 and follows the susceptible population for one
year. The model consists of chance nodes with associ-
ated probabilities that determine the proportion of the
population that is likely to follow a given natural history
pathway. From the initial chance node representing the
susceptible population, a proportion will experience inci-
dent CDI. Among these incident CDI cases, a certain
fraction is likely caused by NAP1/B1/027 versus other
strains. This strain dichotomization was chosen given
the epidemiologic importance of NAP1/BI/027 in terms
of mortality and recurrence. A proportion of persons
experience a severe episode (intensive care unit care,
colectomy or death attributable to CDI infection). Pa-
tients with the NAP1 strain have a higher chance of an
incident severe episode and death vs. patients with non-

 NAP1 strains. As CDI can be a recurrent disease, a pro-
portion of patients cleared of the index infection experi-
ence a future episode. We assumed that recurrent
episodes were caused by the same strain as the initial
case. Survivors of the first recurrence may experience up
to five subsequent recurrences, where the probability of
the second recurrence and beyond is greater than the
first. Recurrence probabilities additionally depend on
strain and age [4, 10, 25].
Epidemiologic outcomes
The model generates epidemiologic outcomes for the
number of initial CDI cases, recurrent cases according
to order of the episode (first, second, third, fourth or
higher); number of severe CDI cases and deaths attribut-
able to CDI and all-cause deaths. Outcomes are pre-
sented specific to age, risk group and healthcare setting
for year 2014.
Economic burden outcomes
Economic outcomes for primary and recurrent CDI in-
cluded direct costs for hospitalization, pharmacotherapy,
healthcare professionals, and medical procedures, as well
as indirect costs due to productivity losses, number of
hospitalization days, and lost productivity. Costs were
estimated using a societal perspective; direct and indirect
costs for the hospital and community were included.
Direct costs were computed for primary and recurrent
cases. The quantities of each healthcare resource utilized
in the management of a case of CDI were identified
from the literature, and multiplied by unit costs of
each healthcare resource. The cost of a CDI episode
depended on its severity, whether it was primary or
recurrent, whether one or more courses of antibiotic
treatments were required and the patient’s age. Indir-
ect costs included productivity losses associated with
inability to work and were estimated as a product of
national average age-specific wage rate, labor force

 participation, and duration of the episode. All cost
projections from the model were presented in 2014
US dollars.
Model parameters and data sources
Additional file 1: Appendix B gives key demographic,
epidemiologic and economic model parameters, their
base-case values and sources. Demographic parameters
specified the annual number of susceptible pools of indi-
viduals in the hospital, LTC, LTAC, and community set-
tings. Epidemiological parameters included initial CDI
incidence, probability of incident cases due to NAP1/BI/
027 strain, case severity, mortality, and recurrence. Eco-
nomic parameters specified costs and quantities of direct
and indirect costs associated with CDI.
Crude CDI incidence in the hospital setting combining
all age and risk groups was derived from an analysis of
primary and secondary diagnoses of CDI (ICD-9 008.45)
from
the
Healthcare
Cost
and
Utilization
Project
(HCUP) 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample [10]. In
order to avoid over-estimating episodes, we used HCUP
State Inpatient Databases (SID) [37] to estimate inci-
dence of CDI as a primary or secondary diagnosis using
unique patient identifiers for the year 2010 amongst all
susceptible individuals; this analysis generated a correc-
tion factor that was applied to the 2009 data so that inci-
dence rates were derived from individual patients that
were only counted once. Crude incidence in hospital
was also further adjusted downward to exclude 16.2 %
and 25.5 % of CDI cases that occur in LTC and commu-
nity, respectively, who are transferred to hospital to fur-
ther correct for any over counting of cases [22, 38].
In order to assign a relative risk of CDI incidence oc-
curring in hospital to specific age- and risk-groups, we
separately utilized HCUP SID analyses using the same
International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD)
-9 codes which defined the susceptible individuals in the
hospital risk groups. In these separate analyses, patients
who belonged to HSCT, IBD, SOT, CKD, and immune
compromised were at 7.8, 4.1, 3.6, 4.5, and 4.9 times, re-
spectively, greater risk of CDI (all ages combined) rela-
tive to crude CDI incidence (data not shown). We
excluded CDI infection in patients <1 year old since
cases in this age group typically represent colonization
rather than true disease. Similarly, we assumed HSCT is
unlikely to occur in individuals >85 years old; hence sus-
ceptible patients in this age and risk group were set to 0.
Incidence of CDI in LTC, LTAC and community
settings and other epidemiological parameters such as C.
difficile strain, severity, mortality, and recurrence were
based on the literature and assumptions described in Add-
itional file 1: Appendix B. Additional file 1: Appendix B
also lists the healthcare resources consumed in the man-
agement of CDI cases, productivity losses, and their unit
costs sources. In the base-case, non-severe cases of CDI
incurred on average 3 bed-days of hospitalization in the
general ward (GW) [30, 35, 39]. It was assumed that a se-
vere case of CDI required 12 bed-days in the general ward
plus 11 bed-days in an ICU [39]. CDI cases managed in
the community assumed one general practitioner contact
per episode. Costs were also estimated for other proce-
dures including colectomy, abdominal computerized axial
tomography (CT) scans, peripheral intravenous line inser-
tion, endoscopy, and toxin tests. Further details are in-
cluded in Additional file 1: Appendix B. Productivity
losses arising from CDI were calculated according to
the product of duration of the episode; the mean earn-
ings by age of the patient, and labor participation by
age, obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
[40]. Cost inputs from years earlier than 2014 were
inflated using the CPI from BLS.
All CDI-related deaths were costed as severe CDI
cases, while non-CDI related deaths assumed costs of
non-severe CDI.
Base-case and sensitivity analysis
We presented the base-case results for estimated initial
and recurrent cases of CDI by setting, age, and risk fac-
tor in 2014. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed
by varying those parameters which were most influential
on the annual number of primary and recurrent CDI
cases and total economic cost of CDI. Further details are
provided in Additional file 1: Appendix C.
Results
Disease burden
In 2014, 606,058 episodes of CDI were expected nation-
wide in 439,237 patients who would subsequently have
166,821 recurrent episodes (see Table 1). A significant
number of CDI patients, 150,648 or 34.3 %, were esti-
mated to have CDI from community exposure. There
were 112,152 (25.5 %) cases in LTC residents, and
170,229 (38.7 %) had overnight stays in an acute care
hospital. Less than 2 % of cases occurred in LTAC
settings.
High risk susceptible individuals (i.e., HSCT, IBD,
SOT, CKD, other immunocompromised patients) were
5 % of the total hospital population but accounted for
23 % of all CDI patients within hospital. Amongst the
355,780 patients with CKD, over 13,000 patients devel-
oped CDI, and burden was similar in patients who were
immune compromised. Between 1,600 and 6,900 pa-
tients from each of the remaining risk groups (HSCT,
IBD, and SOT) developed CDI. However, the majority of
patients developing CDI in hospital (131,114; 77.0 %)
were not associated with any of the five major risk
groups.

 Combining primary and all recurrent episodes, 13.5 %
of patients had severe CDI, and over 44,500 deaths
attributable to CDI were estimated to occur in 2014,
corresponding to a 10 % attributable CDI case-fatality.
Approximately one patient in four who was associated
with a healthcare setting having a primary case of CDI
had at least one further episode, but only 1 in 10 from
the community experienced a recurrence. Slightly fewer
than one-half of patients who experienced a first recur-
rent episode had a second recurrence, and about half of
those had a third recurrence. Recurrent cases by age are
given in the Additional file 1: Appendix C.
Combining all care settings, the greatest disease bur-
den occurs in patients aged 65 years and over, represent-
ing 68.6 % of all CDI episodes, while 31.4 % of CDI
episodes occurred in those <64 years (Table 2). The ma-
jority of CDI cases occurring in patients up to age 44
were in the community. For patients over age 65 years,
the majority of CDI cases were found in the hospital or
LTC setting (Table 2).
Economic burden
Estimated economic costs of CDI in patients in the hos-
pital, LTC, or LTAC were $4.7 billion dollars (86.7 %)
while the estimated cost of CDI in the community was
$725 million dollars (13.3 %), totaling $5.4 billion
(Table 3). Amongst all healthcare resource components,
overnight stays in the hospital contributed 78 % of the
total direct and indirect costs of CDI cases in healthcare
facilities and 52 % of costs for CDI cases originating in
the community (Table 3). Costs for pharmacotherapy,
healthcare professionals, surgery, and procedures were
each under 8 % as a share of total costs in healthcare fa-
cilities and under 15 % in the community. Productivity
losses associated with inability to work totaled $208 mil-
lion (based on cases from all settings and initial and re-
current CDI episodes combined). The share of economic
burden attributed to either initial or recurrent CDI dif-
fered between healthcare facilities and the community.
In healthcare facilities, 67 % ($3.2 billion) of costs was
due to initial episodes and 33 % ($1.5 billion) was due to
recurrent episodes. For initial and recurrent costs, this
share was 89 % ($647 million) and 11 % ($77 million),
respectively, in the community (see Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis
Additional file 1: Appendix C shows combined CDI bur-
den estimates in all settings, age-, and risk-groups for
year 2014 under alternative parameter assumptions in
one-way sensitivity analyses. Cases of initial CDI were
most
sensitive
to
crude
incidence
of
CDI
(range
351,389 – 527,084). Recurrent CDI was most sensitive
to recurrence rates (range 102,160–261,703), but prob-
ability of severe CDI and prevalence of NAP1/BI/027
strain were also influential on total number of recurrent
cases. All-cause and attributable deaths were most sensi-
tive to crude incidence of CDI and prevalence of NAP1/
BI/027 strain. By varying cost of hospitalization, an-
nual costs of CDI ranged between $3.97 and $6.91
billion dollars in 2014.
Limitations
As with all models, there were a number of limitations
arising from data availability. As our model drew its par-
ameter values from published literature, it was critical to
determine that the published data were based on suit-
able definitions and representative patients that matched
the model definitions. This can be problematic when the
model requires recurrence, mortality, and healthcare re-
source use to be conditioned on strain and severity of
the episode, a level of detail which is not generally avail-
able. This required a very careful selection of data or
combinations of data to run the model. Where values
from non-US studies were used, it was assumed that the
published estimate from Canada and Europe were based
on suitably comparable populations. However, a particu-
lar strength of the model is its use of HCUP SID data,
which permitted estimation of CDI incidence rates by
age and high risk groups for HSCT, IBD, SOT, CKD and
immune-compromised patients. The estimates of eco-
nomic burden depended on assumptions surrounding
hospitalization cost and length of stay, which due to
their uncertainty, led to wide predicted ranges.
Structural and analytic choices were made as in all
modeling projects. In particular, our model used a di-
chotomization of C. difficile strain and a population
stratification that did not include sex and race, which
others have found to be important predictors of inci-
dence in the United-States [12]. Another important ana-
lytic choice was the calculation of productivity loss that
depended on labour participation, which is generally low
in patients over 65 years of age who are most affected by
CDI. This choice has the effect of reducing the estimated
economic burden of CDI compared with estimating the
social value of non-workers and retirees as equal to the
employed population. Productivity losses for caregivers
of children and elderly, which may be important compo-
nents of economic burden, were also not included due
to lack of data.
Discussion
We developed a decision-analytic model in order to bet-
ter understand the current and projected CDI burden in
the US. Our model allowed calculation of the number of
initial and recurrent CDI cases, and mortality rates by
age and risk groups and by setting of care. Previously
published studies have lacked comparability and this
level of granularity, thereby limiting clear interpretation

in 2014, the absolute annual number of incident CDI
cases,
when
combining
all
healthcare

 Centers for Disease Control and Infection (CDC) figure
of 453,000 cases in 2011 [12]. Our model estimates that
25.5 % of these cases originate within an LTC setting,
compared to 26 % estimated by CDC. Furthermore, our
model estimated that 34.2 % of CDI cases occurred in
the community which compares with their figure of
32 % of patients who were defined as community onset
and who did not have a hospital stay in the previous
12 weeks. Estimates of first recurrences were reasonably
similar: our model estimated 96,807 in 2014 compared
to the CDC figure of 83,000 in 2011. However, estimates
of deaths differed. Our model estimates that 44,572
deaths occurred in 2014 which is close to the upper limit
of CDC estimates of 29,300 (95 % CI, 16,500 – 42,100).
One reason explaining this difference is that our model
estimated up to 6 recurrences and hence more CDI-
attributable deaths were possible in our model, while
CDC figures estimated first recurrences only. It is inter-
esting to note that CDI-attributable death estimates
from both our model-based estimates and those of CDC
exceed figures reported by the National Vital Statistics
Reports (NVSS) of 7,994 in 2011. One reason that may
explain the discrepancy with NVSS may be that the re-
corded cause of death in CDI patients with multiple co-
morbidities were attributed to other causes [42].
Previous estimates of the annual economic cost for
CDI in the US ranged from $436 million to $4.8 billion
(2008 US dollars) [34–36]. However, it has been sug-
gested that these are low estimates because they do not
take into account factors such as outpatient costs, indir-
ect costs, and decreases in productivity [36]. Our esti-
mates, which factored these items, were accordingly
higher, indicating a total cost of $5.4 billion annually. In
our study, the main driver of costs was hospitalization,
accounting for between half to three-quarters of total
costs, depending on care setting. Up to one-third of total
costs were associated with recurrent CDI for patients
whose initial episode was associated with a healthcare fa-
cility, but this was much lower when the initial episode
was community acquired. Indirect costs were found to
be small relative to total economic burden, due to low
labor participation in the majority of CDI patients who
are over 65 years.
Conclusions
The results of the model described for this study are
useful for better identification of the settings and risk-
and age- groups in which CDI burden lies. Moreover,
these data permit a greater understanding of the burden
of recurrent episodes which has not been reported previ-
ously. Given the clinical challenges associated with the
of treatment of recurrent CDI and the improved recog-
nition of CDI in high risk groups, these data provide
insights into the potential value of emerging new treat-
ment options that could benefit patients with CDI.
