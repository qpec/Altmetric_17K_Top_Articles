ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To evaluate the efficacy of therapist guided internet 
based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme 
for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD-NET) compared 
with online supportive therapy.
Design
A 12 week single blind parallel group randomised 
controlled trial.
setting
Academic medical centre.
PartiCiPants
94 self referred adult outpatients with a diagnosis of 
body dysmorphic disorder and a modified Yale-Brown 
obsessive compulsive scale (BDD-YBOCS) score of ≥20. 
Concurrent psychotropic drug treatment was permitted if 
the dose had been stable for at least two months before 
enrolment and remained unchanged during the trial.
interventiOns
Participants received either BDD-NET (n=47) or 
supportive therapy (n=47) delivered via the internet 
for 12 weeks.
Main OutCOMe Measures
The primary outcome was the BDD-YBOCS score after 
treatment and follow-up (three and six months from 
baseline) as evaluated by a masked assessor. 
Responder status was defined as a ≥30% reduction in 
symptoms on the scale.
Secondary outcomes were measures of depression 
(MADRS-S), global functioning (GAF), clinical global 
improvement (CGI-I), and quality of life (EQ5D). The six 
month follow-up time and all outcomes other than 
BDD-YBOCS and MADRS-S at 3 months were not 
pre-specified in the registration at clinicaltrials.gov 
because of an administrative error but were included 
in the original trial protocol approved by the regional 
ethics committee before the start of the trial.
results
BDD-NET was superior to supportive therapy and was 
associated with significant improvements in severity of 
symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD-YBOCS 
group difference −7.1 points, 95% confidence interval 
−9.8 to −4.4), depression (MADRS-S group difference 
−4.5 points, −7.5 to −1.4), and other secondary 
measures. At follow-up, 56% of those receiving 
BDD-NET were classed as responders, compared with 
13% receiving supportive therapy. The number needed 
to treat was 2.34 (1.71 to 4.35). Self reported 
satisfaction was high.
COnClusiOns
CBT can be delivered safely via the internet to patients 
with body dysmorphic disorder. BDD-NET has the 
potential to increase access to evidence based 
psychiatric care for this mental disorder, in line with 
NICE priority recommendations. It could be particularly 
useful in a stepped care approach, in which general 
practitioner or other mental health professionals can 
offer treatment to people with mild to moderate 
symptoms at low risk of suicide.

Introduction
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric disor-
der characterised by a pervasive preoccupation with 
perceived defects in physical appearance accompa-
nied by avoidance and time consuming compulsive 
behaviours, such as mirror gazing and excessive cam-
ouflaging to hide perceived defects.1  If left untreated, 
this is a chronic and unremitting disorder that is asso-
ciated with functional impairment across multiple life 
domains, relatively high rates of psychiatric admis-
sions to hospital, substance dependence, and suicid-
ality.2-4  Although the disorder is often underdetected 
and underdiagnosed within the mental health ser-
vices,5 6  epidemiological studies show that it is a com-
mon mental health problem, with a prevalence 
ranging from 0.7% to 2.2% in the general popula-
tion.7-10  It is common for those with body dysmorphic 
disorder to seek non-psychiatric care, such as derma-
tological treatment or plastic surgery, in an attempt to 
“fix” the perceived defects; however, such interven-
tions rarely work and can lead to a deterioration of 
symptoms.11 12

order include psychopharmacological treatment and

cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).13-16  Guidance from 
the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excel-
lence (NICE) recommends that adults should be offered 
the choice of either a course of a selective serotonin 
response inhibitor or specialised CBT that deals with 
the key features of the disorder.17  There is, however, a 
gap between supply and demand of CBT because of 
various factors, such as a lack of trained therapists, 
direct and indirect costs associated with treatment, 
and geographical barriers that prevent people with 
body dysmorphic disorder from receiving specialised 
CBT.18-20  In two surveys, only 10-17% of people with 
body dysmorphic concerns reported that they had 
received an empirically supported psychotherapy 
(such as CBT), and 19-34% reported that they had 
received an SSRI.19 20  Thus, one of NICE’s key priorities 
for implementation—namely, that each primary care 
trust, mental healthcare trust, and children’s trust that 
provides mental health services should have access to 
a specialist multidisciplinary team offering age appro-
priate care—is currently far from reality.17  The growth 
in demand for mental healthcare exceeds available 
National Health Service (NHS) resources in the United 
Kingdom, and this gap is likely to increase up to 2020.21 
 
Cost pressures require that providers find innovative 
ways to deliver services. The UK government’s mental 
health strategy “no health without mental health”22 
 
recommends the increased use of information and 
communication technology to improve care and access 
to services. UK government initiatives such as “Digital 
First” aim to reduce unnecessary face to face contact 
between patients and healthcare professionals.21  Many 
people with body dysmorphic disorder report that one 
important reason for not seeking treatment is related to 
feelings of shame and stigma associated with their con-
cerns about appearance, making telecare options 
potentially suitable.19 20
Internet based CBT is a burgeoning area of mental 
health aimed at increasing access to specialised 
behavioural treatments. In some countries (such as 
Sweden, Australia, and the Netherlands) internet based 
CBT has been implemented as part of the regular 
healthcare system and is efficacious and cost effective 
for a wide range of mental health disorders.23 24  With 
the primary aim of increasing access to evidence based 
care for body dysmorphic disorder, we recently devel-
oped a therapist guided internet based CBT programme 
for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD-NET). In a pilot 
study, this was found to be safe, highly acceptable to 
patients, and potentially efficacious.25 Crucially, the 
treatment required only a fraction of the therapist time 
associated with regular CBT.
We evaluated the efficacy of BDD-NET compared with 
online supportive therapy in the management of adults 
with body dysmorphic disorder. Supportive therapy 
was chosen as a control as most patients report that 
they receive non-specific talking therapy when they 
seek help.19 We hypothesised that BDD-NET would be 
superior to online supportive therapy in reducing symp-
toms, as well as other psychiatric symptoms, and 
improve quality of life.
Method
trial design
This was a single blind parallel group superiority trial 
conducted at Karolinska Institutet from November 
2013 to January 2015. Participants were randomly 
assigned to 12 weeks of BDD-NET (n=47) or online 
supportive therapy (n=47) in a 1:1 ratio without restric-
tion. Both groups were followed for three months 
after the end of treatment (six months from baseline). 
This follow-up point was not included in the trial reg-
istration (clinicaltrials.gov) because of an administra-
tive error but was included in the original study 
protocol. Participants randomised to supportive ther-
apy were offered BDD-NET after the six month fol-
low-up assessments. No changes to methods were 
made after the trial started. The study is reported in 
accordance to the Consolidated Standards for Report-
ing Trials (CONSORT) statement for non-pharmaco-
logical treatments.26
Participants
Eligible participants were individuals with access to 
the internet, aged 18 or over, and with a principal diag-
nosis of body dysmorphic disorder according to the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
5th edition (DSM-5),1  with a score of at least 20 on the 
modified Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale 
(BDD-YBOCS).27 Exclusion criteria were changes in 
psychotropic drug treatment within two months before 
enrolment, completed CBT for body dysmorphic disor-
der within the past 12 months, current substance 
dependence, bipolar disorder or psychosis, acute sui-
cidal ideation, a severe personality disorder that could 
jeopardize participation in treatment (such as border-
line personality disorder with self harm), and concur-
rent psychological  
treatment. Participants who were 
taking psychotropic drugs and had been taking a sta-
ble dose for at least two months before enrolment were 
asked to keep their dose stable during the study 
period.
recruitment and determination of eligibility
Participants were recruited from all over Sweden. Flyers 
were distributed to psychiatrists and general practi-
tioners throughout Sweden with information about the 
study. In addition, the study was advertised in national 
newspapers. Interested applicants had to register on 
the study’s secure website and complete an online 
screening consisting of the Montgomery-Åsberg depres-
sion rating scale self report (MADRS-S),28  alcohol use 
disorders identification test,29  drug user disorders iden-
tification test,30  body dysmorphic disorder question-
naire,31  and general background information. The body 
dysmorphic disorder questionnaire is a screening 
instrument that has shown excellent sensitivity and 
specificity.31  Potentially suitable participants under-
went a structured diagnostic interview with a clinical 
psychologist or with a trained student in the final 
semester of a five year clinical psychology programme. 
The interviews were conducted over telephone, which 
is a reliable administration format for structured

psychiatric assessments.32  To establish a diagnosis of 
body dysmorphic disorder, we used the structured clin-
ical interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders, with an 
added question about the presence of repetitive 
behaviours to reflect the updates made to the diagnostic 
criteria of body dysmorphic disorder in DSM-5. The 
mini-international neuropsychiatric interview was 
used to determine the presence of other comorbid psy-
chiatric disorders.33 All assessors had received exten-
sive training in structured diagnostic interviews. To 
ensure  
reliability of diagnostic procedure and eligibility 
criteria, a consultant psychiatrist reviewed each case 
and made the final decision on enrolment.
interventions
BDD-NET
BDD-NET is delivered through a tailored online plat-
form with a dedicated hospital server with encrypted 
traffic and an authentication login function to guaran-
tee participants’ confidentiality. Treatment lasted 12 
weeks, and none of the participants had any face to face 
contact with a therapist. The treatment protocol is 
based on a CBT model for body dysmorphic disorder, 
emphasising the role of negatively reinforced avoidance 
and safety seeking behaviours (such as mirror checking 
and camouflaging perceived physical defects) as main-
taining factors of body dysmorphic disorder. The treat-
ment protocol has been validated in a previous trial, 
and the treatment effects are comparable with those 
gained in traditional face to face CBT.25 The main inter-
vention in BDD-NET is systematic exposure to fear elic-
iting situations or events combined with response 
prevention until anxiety and urges to ritualise subside 
(such as leaving home and refraining from compulsive 
mirror checking).
In total, BDD-NET consists of eight interactive mod-
ules delivered over 12 weeks, with the first five mod-
ules containing the core treatment components.23 
Each module is devoted to a special theme and covers 
psychoeducation, a cognitive behaviour conceptuali-
sation of body dysmorphic disorder, cognitive restruc-
turing, exposure and response prevention, more on 
exposure and response prevention, values based 
behaviour change, difficulties encountered during 
treatment, and prevention of relapse. To progress to 
the next module participants have to complete home-
work assignments (such as reading text material, 
answering a quiz at the end of each module, filling out 
worksheets, or doing exposure and response preven-
tion) and report to their therapist. The participants 
had contact with an identified therapist throughout 
the entire treatment using a built-in email system on 
the BDD-NET webpage. Participants could log in and 
send emails at any time. All homework assignments 
and questions from the participants were reviewed 
and answered within 36 hours, except on weekends. 
The role of the therapist was mainly to guide and 
coach the participant throughout the treatment, pro-
vide feedback on homework assignments, answer 
questions from the participants, and consecutively 
grant access to the next treatment module. The 
 
participants were notified by an automated text mes-
sage (SMS) when they had a new email in the treat-
ment platform from their therapist.
The therapists guiding the participants through the 
treatment were four clinical psychology students who 
had completed their basic clinical training (320 hours) 
and had provided therapy in milder cases under the 
supervision of a senior psychologist. The clinical psy-
chology students had no prior experience of treating 
body dysmorphic disorder but were closely supervised 
by the lead author (JE) with weekly meetings through-
out the trial. The duration of therapist contact and sent 
emails was automatically recorded by the BDD-NET 
platform. Median therapist time spent weekly per par-
ticipant reading and answering emails was 13.2 min-
utes. To ensure treatment integrity and adherence to 
protocol, the lead author monitored the messages sent 
by the therapists throughout the entire treatment, and 
provided supervision. Appendix 1 shows a screenshot 
of BDD-NET.
Online supportive therapy
Participants had access to the integrated email sys-
tem on the BDD-NET webpage and unlimited access to 
an identified therapist. They were given the opportu-
nity to talk freely about their experiences, thoughts, 
and feelings about body dysmorphic disorder and 
how it affected their life. The therapist sent an email 
at least once a week, encouraging the participant to 
discuss distressing life events and to promote prob-
lem solving. The therapists used skills drawn from 
counselling techniques and included minimal 
encouragers, reflecting, empathising, and summaris-
ing. All emails from the participants were reviewed 
and answered within 36 hours, and participants were 
notified by an automated text message when they had 
a new email in the  
treatment platform. Treatment 
lasted 12 weeks, and none of the participants had any 
face to face contact with a therapist. Non-directive 
supportive therapy delivered via the internet has been 
shown to reduce symptoms associated with obsessive 
compulsive disorder,34 though there are no reports of 
its efficacy for body dysmorphic disorder. The sup-
portive therapy served as a control for caregiver atten-
tion and the possible anxiety alleviating effect of 
sharing one’s distress with a therapist. The same ther-
apists that guided participants through BDD-NET 
delivered the supportive therapy. Therapists spent a 
median of 6.3 minutes per participant per week read-
ing and answering emails. To ensure treatment integ-
rity, the lead author monitored the messages sent by 
the therapists throughout the entire treatment and 
provided supervision. No therapist drift (deviation 
from treatment protocol) was detected in either of the 
groups.
randomisation and masking
Participants were randomised on a 1:1 ratio with simple 
randomisation with no constraints. To prevent potential 
selection bias related to the randomisation procedure, an

a true number service (www.random.org). Allocation 
concealment was ensured through randomisation after 
the decision to include each participant had been made. 
Immediately after randomisation, participants received 
information about which treatment they had been allo-
cated to and how they could log on to the secure website. 
Assessors in the trial remained masked to treatment allo-
cation at baseline and three and six month follow-up. 
Because of the nature of the intervention, participants and 
therapists were not blinded to treatment.
assessment points and outcomes
All participants were assessed at baseline and then 
received 12 weeks of treatment. Follow-up times were 
three and six months from baseline (after treatment and 
three months after treatment, respectively). After the six 
month follow-up, participants in the supportive therapy 
group were offered BDD-NET and reassessed after receiv-
ing 12 weeks of additional treatment with BDD-NET. Par-
ticipants also completed online self report measures at 
these time points, a method that has been shown to be as 
reliable and as valid as written administration.35 
36
The primary outcome was change in severity of symp-
toms of body dysmorphic disorder assessed with the BDD-
YBOCS administered by a clinician.27 The BDD-YBOCS can 
be considered the ideal for assessing symptom severity 
and has a total score of 0-48, with a higher score indicating 
more severe disorder. To ensure quality of assessments, 
clinicians in this trial practiced together on case examples 
with excellent reliability between raters (intraclass cor-
relation 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.98).
Secondary outcomes included responder status 
defined as an empirically derived cut off point of ≥30% 
reduction from baseline on the BDD-YBOCS.37 
 
 
Remission was defined as patients who no longer met 
diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder. 
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 
MADRS-S.28  Clinician rated global functioning and 
improvement was assessed with the global assessment 
of functioning scale (GAF)38  and the clinical global 
improvement scale (CGI-I).39  Quality of life was 
assessed with the EQ5D EuroQol (EQ5D).40
All outcomes other than BDD-YBOCS and MADRS-S at 
three months were not pre-specified in the registration at 
clinicaltrials.gov because of an administrative error but 
were included in the original trial protocol approved by 
the regional ethics committee before the start of the trial.
The occurrences of adverse events were recorded 
mid-treatment and after treatment with a self report 
form.41  Treatment credibility and expectancy of improve-
ment were recorded at week two with the C scale 
(included post hoc after trial registration).42
Patient involvement
We received input from patients from the BDD-NET pilot 
trial on the treatment material. No patients were 
involved in setting the research question or the outcome 
measures, nor were they involved in developing plans 
for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. 
No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or 
writing up of results. We carefully assessed the burden 
of the trial interventions on the patients by collecting 
information about adverse events, quality of life, and 
time spent on the treatment. We plan to disseminate the 
results of the research to study participants and to the 
Swedish OCD Foundation.
Power calculation and statistical analysis
We powered the study to be able to detect at least a 
medium standardised effect size (Cohen’s d). We based 
power calculations on a previous pilot trial of BDD-NET 
and the efficacy of online supportive therapy for obses-
sive compulsive disorder.25 34 A sample size of 39 per 
group was required to give 80% power and a two sided 
5% significance for detecting a mean difference 
between groups of at least 4 and a standard deviation of 
6.24 on the BDD-YBOCS between BDD-NET and sup-
portive therapy. We anticipated a potential 10% dropout 
rate, giving a planned sample size of at least 44 per 
group, or 88 in total. There were no planned interim 
analyses or rules for stopping.
Analyses were by intention to treat, with participants 
analysed in the group to which they had been ran-
domised. Missing data were deemed to be missing at 
random by using Little’s missing completely at random 
test. Linear mixed models with maximum likelihood 
estimations were used to evaluate the effect of treat-
ment group on the different outcomes. Such models 
take into account the differences in rate of change and 
differences in trajectories of change between individu-
als with repeated responses and use all the available 
data for each participant.43 The fixed part of the model 
included a treatment indicator variable (supportive 
therapy/BDD-NET), a time indicator variable (three or 
six months), and an interaction effect of treatment × 
time to allow for differential change between the two 
groups from the three to the six month follow-up. Base-
line (before treatment) scores on each outcome mea-
sure were included as covariates. Participant varying 
intercepts were included as a random effect in the 
model. As therapist support time varied between the 
two treatment arms, it was included as an additional 
covariate in the model. Because it did not predict out-
come, however, (P=0.11-0.98) it was dropped from the 
final model. We used χ2 tests for categorical data and 
independent t tests for assessing differences between 
groups when time was not a factor on the outcome vari-
able. We carried out post hoc analysis of participants in 
the supportive therapy arm who later crossed over to 
BDD-NET after the six month follow-up using paired t 
tests. Effect sizes within and between groups were cal-
culated as Cohen’s d. All statistical analyses were done 
in STATA 13.1.
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the trial. 
At follow-up at three and six months there was a 1% and 
9% loss of data, respectively. Little’s test suggested that 
the missing data met the assumption for missing at ran-
dom (χ2=42.57
, df=52, P=0.82). There were no significant 
differences in dropout rates across conditions at after 
treatment (χ2=1.01, df=1, P=0.32) or at the six month

follow-up (χ2=1.11, df=1, P=0.29), and dropouts did not 
significantly differ from completers on baseline demo-
graphics or on symptom measures. The two groups did 
not significantly differ on any baseline characteristics 
(P=0.08-1.00; tables 1 and 2).
Primary outcome
BDD-YBOCS scores were significantly lower for BDD-
NET than for supportive therapy, both at the end of 
treatment (three months) and at six months (table 3 
 
and fig 2). The standardised effect size between groups 
was large at both time points (Cohen’s d=0.95 at three 
months and 0.87 at six months). The effect size within 
groups at six months was 1.42 (95% confidence interval 
0.95 to 1.89) for BDD-NET and 0.55 (0.13 to 0.96) for sup-
portive therapy.
secondary outcomes
Depressive symptoms, measured with the MADRS-S, 
decreased over the course of the trial with BDD-NET but 
not with supportive therapy, and there was a significant 
difference between groups at both follow-up times 
(table 3). At three months, the effect size between 
groups was small (Cohen’s d=0.43), whereas at six 
months it was medium (d=0.58) There was also a signif-
icant correlation between the change in symptoms of 
body dysmorphic disorder and change in depressive 
symptoms at both follow-up times (rs(92)=0.46, 
P<0.001) and rs(80)=0.41, P<0.001, respectively). Of the 
51 participants with a diagnosis of major depressive dis-
order at baseline, 32/57 (56%) no longer met diagnostic 
criteria for depression at three months and 27/57 (47%) 
were still in recovery at the six month follow-up.
Post hoc analysis of global functioning and quality of 
life showed that there was an increase in global func-
tioning with BDD-NET but not with supportive therapy, 
with a significant group difference on the global assess-
ment of functioning scale at both three and six months 
(table 3 ). At three months, there were no significant dif-
ferences between groups on health related quality of 
life (EQ5D). At six months, however, the health related 
quality of life (EQ-5D) had further improved in BDD-
NET, and there was a significant difference between 
groups, favouring BDD-NET (table 3). Appendix 2 shows 
the observed means and standard deviations at the dif-
ferent time points for primary and secondary outcomes.
treatment response and remission
The proportion of participants classified as responders 
was significantly higher in the BDD-NET group at three 
months (25/46 (54%) v 3/47 (6%), χ2=25.42, df=1, 
P<0.001) and at six months (23/41 (56%) v 6/45 (3%), 
χ2=17
.55, df=1, P<0.001). At the six month follow-up, 
23/41 (56%) of the participants in the BDD-NET group 
were classified as improved or much improved on the 
clinical global improvement scale, compared with 7/45 
(16%) in the supportive therapy group (χ2=15.52, df=1, 
P<0.001). The number needed to treat was 2.34 (95% 
confidence interval 1.71 to 4.35).
The number of participants no longer meeting crite-
ria for body dysmorphic disorder was 15/46 (32%) ver-
sus 1/47 (2%; χ2=15.16, df=1, P<0.001) at three months, 
and 16/41 (39%) versus 4/45 (9%; χ2=10.92, df=1, 
P<0.001) at six months, always favouring BDD-NET.

treatment credibility, expectancy, and acceptability
After two weeks, participants randomised to BDD-NET 
rated the treatment as more credible than participants 
randomised to supportive therapy (t(85)=−2.42, P=0.02), 
but this did not translate in greater expectancy of 
improvement (t(85)=−0.58, P=0.57).
Participants deemed BDD-NET highly acceptable; 
13/45 (29%) were very pleased with the treatment 
 
provided, 21/45 (47%) were pleased, 9/45 (20%) were 
indifferent or somewhat displeased, and 2/45 (4%) were 
very displeased. In total, 37/45 (82%) reported that if 
they were in need of additional CBT in the future they 
would use BDD-NET, and 40/45 (89%) would recom-
mend BDD-NET to a friend with similar problems.
Crossover patients
After the six month follow-up, all participants who had 
received supportive therapy were offered BDD-NET. Two 
participants were lost to follow-up, and four declined. 
Participants who crossed over to BDD-NET (n=41) 
showed a significant decrease on the BDD-YBOCS after 
receiving BDD-NET, with a mean reduction of −7
.14 (95% 
confidence interval −9.06 to −5.23, P<0.001; fig 3). Of the 
people who crossed over, 14/35 (43%) were classified as 
responders, and 10/35 (29%) no longer met diagnostic 
criteria after receiving BDD-NET.
Similar improvements were observed on the 
MADRS-S with a mean reduction of −2.18 (95% confi-
dence interval −4.29 to −0.07; P=0.043) and the global 
assessment of functioning, with mean improvement of 
4.69 (2.93 to 6.45; P<0.001). On the EQ5D, there was a 
non-significant increase of 0.04 points (−0.05 to 0.14; 
P=0.378). The four participants in the supportive ther-
apy group who declined to cross over to BDD-NET had 
made significant improvements after receiving support-
ive therapy, and three of them were classified as 
responders.
adverse events and protocol deviations
No serious adverse events (that is, events leading to 
acute health risks demanding admission to hospital) 
were reported. Fifteen (32%) participants in the BDD-
NET group and six (13%) in the supportive therapy 
group reported mild adverse events (that is, increased 
levels of anxiety and general negative wellbeing) at the 
beginning of the trial, which had subsided for everyone 
at three months, except for four participants in the BDD-
NET group. Of these, two participants reported increased 
sleep disturbances because of heightened anxiety levels 
attributed to the exposure exercises, one reported 
depressive mood, and one reported that the insight 
gained throughout the treatment regarding time spent 
on concerns about appearance was emotionally painful 
but also enhanced motivation to make changes. Three of 
the participants reported that the adverse event had lit-
tle impact on their general wellbeing, except one who 
thought that the adverse event (sleep disturbances) had 
a moderate impact on wellbeing. The occurrence of 
adverse events during treatment was not related to 
responder status at follow-up (χ2=0.91, df=1, P=0.34).
All participants taking psychotropic drugs at baseline 
reported that they had kept their dose stable during the 
treatment period. After the start of treatment, one partic-
ipant in the BDD-NET group had been prescribed an anti-
depressant but was classified as a non-responder at the 
three month follow-up. None of the other  
participants 
reported that they had received any other type of health-
care during the duration of the trial. From the three to the 
six month follow-up, three participants in the BDD-NET 
group and two participants in the supportive therapy 
group had received additional healthcare in the form of 
CBT, pharmacological treatment, or both.

discussion
Principal findings
In this trial, we compared the efficacy of BDD-NET, a 
novel therapist guided internet based CBT programme 
for body dysmorphic disorder, with online supportive 
therapy, a kind of non-specific talking therapy that 
mimics the psychosocial support that most patients 
with body dysmorphic disorder report receiving in the 
real world.19 
20  Overall, BDD-NET was superior to sup-
portive therapy and was associated with significant 
improvements in symptom severity, depression, global 
functioning, and quality of life. These gains were main-
tained for at least three months after the end of treat-
ment. At that point, 56% of those receiving BDD-NET 
were classed as responders, and 39% no longer met 
diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder. The 
number needed to treat to achieve one responder was 
2.34. Participants in the supportive therapy group who 
crossed over to BDD-NET after six months also improved 
robustly on primary and secondary outcome measures. 
No serious adverse events were reported. Some partici-
pants reported mild adverse events (such as heightened 
anxiety levels associated with exposure tasks) during 
the trial, but these were generally short lived and were 
not associated with responder status at the end of treat-
ment. Most participants were satisfied with BDD-NET, 
despite no face to face contact with a therapist, and 
deemed the treatment as highly acceptable. The results 
indicate that BDD-NET has potential to greatly increase 
access to evidence based psychiatric treatment for 
patients with body dysmorphic disorder, in line with 
the NICE priority recommendations.17
strengths and limitations of study
Despite its modest size, this study represents the larg-
est randomised controlled trial ever conducted in peo-
ple with body dysmorphic disorder. The inclusion of a 
control intervention with high ecological validity, the 
use of masked assessors, and minimal data loss are 
other strengths of the study. One potential limitation 
of the trial is that the results might not be generalis-
able to everyone with body dysmorphic disorder as the 
participants were self referred and most had reason-
ably good insight. We also took the precaution, on 
safety grounds, of excluding participants with sub-
stance dependence and severe suicidal ideation. Thus, 
despite the fact that most participants had been ill for 
many years, had had previous contact with mental 
health services, and a fifth had undergone plastic sur-
gery, participants in this trial might have been partic-
ularly motivated to engage in psychotherapy 
compared with more severely affected and delusional 
patients seen in specialist clinics. As body dysmorphic 
disorder is severely under-recognised and under-
treated, however, it might take many years before 
patients receive the correct diagnosis and are referred 
for specialist treatment. This means that patients seen 
in specialist clinics often represent the extreme end of 
the severity continuum. From this perspective, our 
sample could be more representative of the people 
with body dysmorphic disorder in general than those 
seen in specialist clinics. Another potential limitation 
is that participants were informed that if they were 
randomised to supportive therapy, they would be 
offered BDD-NET after the six month follow-up

assessment, although they were not explicitly told that 
we expected BDD-NET to be superior to supportive 
therapy. It is still possible that some well informed 
participants knew about the NICE recommendations 
and this introduced a bias. Participants randomised to 
BDD-NET found the treatment more credible than par-
ticipants in the supportive therapy group, but per-
ceived credibility did not translate to greater 
expectancy of improvement as there were no differ-
ences between groups on how much participants 
thought they would improve at end of treatment. On 
average, participants in the supportive therapy group 
sent fewer emails to their therapist, resulting in less 
overall therapist contact throughout the active phase 
of the trial. The estimated differences in treatment 
effects, however, remained unchanged when we 
adjusted for the amount of therapist contact.
Comparison with other studies
Overall, our results are in line with previous studies of 
face to face CBT for body dysmorphic disorder.14 
15  The 
proportion of comorbidities were the same in our sam-
ple as in previous clinical trials, though symptoms of 
depression were on average of mild severity compared 
with moderate to severe depression as seen in the two 
recent randomised controlled trials of CBT for body dys-
morphic disorder.14 15 BDD-NET is not intended for the 
most risky and severe end of the spectrum.
Conclusions and policy implications
The therapists providing online support had no previ-
ous experience of treating body dysmorphic disorder, 
which indicates that this form of treatment delivery 
could be easily scalable. BDD-NET is delivered online as 
a series of interactive modules, and the role of the ther-
apist is mainly to encourage the participant to engage in 
the treatment, making it reasonable to assume that 
BDD-NET can be used in non-specialist settings. BDD-
NET could be particularly useful in a stepped care 
approach, where mild to moderately affected patients 
can be offered BDD-NET by their general practitioner, or 
other health professionals, thus freeing resources for 
patients in more severe and complex cases to be treated 
in specialised settings. Logistic barriers are also elimi-
nated, as patients receiving BDD-NET do not have to 
travel to the clinic once a week to receive the treatment. 
This makes BDD-NET particularly promising in more 
rural areas, where the access to trained CBT therapists 
is limited.18 Future stepped care trials of BDD-NET in 
non-specialist settings are warranted.
