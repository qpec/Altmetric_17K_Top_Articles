IMPORTANCE Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for treatment of morbid obesity has
increased substantially despite the lack of long-term results compared with laparoscopic
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass are equivalent for weight loss at 5 years in patients with morbid obesity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Sleeve vs Bypass (SLEEVEPASS) multicenter,
multisurgeon, open-label, randomized clinical equivalence trial was conducted from March
2008 until June 2010 in Finland. The trial enrolled 240 morbidly obese patients aged 18 to
60 years, who were randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass with a 5-year
follow-up period (last follow-up, October 14, 2015).
INTERVENTIONS Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n = 121) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass (n = 119).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was weight loss evaluated by
percentage excess weight loss. Prespecified equivalence margins for the clinical significance
of weight loss differences between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy were −9% to +9%
excess weight loss. Secondary end points included resolution of comorbidities, improvement
of quality of life (QOL), all adverse events (overall morbidity), and mortality.
RESULTS Among 240 patients randomized (mean age, 48 [SD, 9] years; mean baseline body
mass index, 45.9, [SD, 6.0]; 69.6% women), 80.4% completed the 5-year follow-up. At baseline,
42.1% had type 2 diabetes, 34.6% dyslipidemia, and 70.8% hypertension. The estimated mean
percentage excess weight loss at 5 years was 49% (95% CI, 45%-52%) after sleeve gastrectomy
and 57% (95% CI, 53%-61%) after gastric bypass (difference, 8.2 percentage units [95% CI,
3.2%-13.2%], higher in the gastric bypass group) and did not meet criteria for equivalence.
Complete or partial remission of type 2 diabetes was seen in 37% (n = 15/41) after sleeve
gastrectomy and in 45% (n = 18/40) after gastric bypass (P > .99). Medication for dyslipidemia
was discontinued in 47% (n = 14/30) after sleeve gastrectomy and 60% (n = 24/40) after gastric
bypass (P = .15) and for hypertension in 29% (n = 20/68) and 51% (n = 37/73) (P = .02),
respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in QOL between groups (P = .85)
and no treatment-related mortality. At 5 years the overall morbidity rate was 19% (n = 23) for
sleeve gastrectomy and 26% (n = 31) for gastric bypass (P = .19).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with morbid obesity, use of laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy compared with use of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass did not meet
criteria for equivalence in terms of percentage excess weight loss at 5 years. Although gastric
bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy was associated with greater percentage excess
weight loss at 5 years, the difference was not statistically significant, based on the
prespecified equivalence margins.

 O
besity is highly prevalent in the US population.
Roughly one-third of US residents have a body mass
index (BMI) exceeding 30 (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and 5% to
10% have BMIs of more than 40.1 Only bariatric surgery
results in substantial and long-term weight loss for very
obese patients. However, outcomes from bariatric surgery
remain uncertain, because few bariatric surgery studies
report long-term results with sufficient patient follow-up.2
The 2 most commonly performed operations are now the
laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy. Sleeve gastrectomy is a simpler operation
than the gastric bypass, and short-term results suggest that it
very effectively treats morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Sleeve gastrectomy is technically easier to perform and has
fewer early perioperative complications, is associated with
less dumping syndrome, and does not involve the risk of
internal hernias based on lack of small bowel rearrangement
also providing access to an intact intestinal passage.
Although outcomes for gastric bypass are reasonably well
described, long-term outcomes for sleeve gastrectomy are
not well known, and it is also not known if outcomes from
sleeve gastrectomy are similar to those for gastric bypass.2
The Sleeve vs Bypass (SLEEVEPASS) trial was designed
as a multicenter, multisurgeon, open-label randomized
clinical trial to test the hypothesis that the long-term results
of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy would be equivalent to
those of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with regard
to weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. The 30-day
and 6-month outcomes of this trial have been reported.3,4
This article reports the findings at 5-year follow-up.
Methods
Trial Design, Participants, and Interventions
The study design, rationale, and methods, including opera-
tive techniques, have been reported.3,4 The complete study
protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by institutional ethics
committees, and written informed consent was obtained from
all patients. The trial was carried out at 3 hospitals in Finland
(Turku, Vaasa, and Helsinki).
Briefly, the trial was a multicenter, multisurgeon, open-
label, randomized clinical equivalence trial involving mor-
bidly obese patients randomized to undergo either laparo-
scopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass from March 2008 to June 2010, with a final 5-year
follow-up date of October 14, 2015. Eligibility criteria in-
cluded age 18 to 60 years, BMI greater than 40 or greater than
35 with a significant obesity-associated comorbidity, and
previous failed adequate conservative treatment. Exclusion
criteria were BMI greater than 60, significant psychiatric or
eating disorder, active alcohol or substance abuse, active gas-
tric ulcer disease, severe gastroesophageal reflux with a large
hiatal hernia, and previous bariatric surgery.
All of the participating surgeons were experienced lapa-
roscopists. The standardized surgical technique for the gas-
tric bypass entailed creating a small gastric pouch and con-
structing an antecolic end-to-side gastrojejunostomy, as
either a circular or a linear anastomosis. The biliopancreatic
jejunal limb was measured to 50 to 80 cm, the alimentary
limb to 150 cm, and a side-to-side jejunojejunostomy was
created. At the time of the study, mesenteric defects were not
routinely closed. The sleeve gastrectomy was created narrow
along a 33-Fr to 35-Fr calibration bougie. The resection was
initiated 4 to 6 cm proximal to the pylorus, preserving the
majority of the antrum.
Objective
The primary objective of the trial was to compare laparo-
scopic sleeve gastrectomy with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity, with a
hypothesis that percentage excess weight loss after sleeve
gastrectomy would be equivalent to that after gastric
bypass. The secondary objective was to test the possible dif-
ferences between the operations regarding resolution of
comorbidities, quality of life (QOL), and overall morbidity
and mortality.
Randomization
Patients were randomized by a closed-envelope method to
undergo either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparo-
scopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Randomization was per-
formed with a 1:1 equal allocation ratio. The opaque, sealed,
and sequentially numbered randomization envelopes were
shuffled and then distributed to each participating hospital.
To randomize an eligible patient after the clinical decision of
proceeding to bariatric surgery for treating morbid obesity,
the surgeon opened a sealed envelope containing the infor-
mation of the assigned randomization group. All of the treat-
ing surgeons were part of the study team.
Outcome Measures
The primary end point was weight loss defined by per-
centage excess weight loss, calculated as (initial weight −
follow-up weight)/(initial weight − ideal weight for BMI
25) × 100%.5 Baseline weight was recorded at the start
of the bariatric surgery evaluation process. At the time of study
initiation, bariatric surgery in Finland was quite novel, and the
Key Points
Question Is weight loss at 5 years equivalent with laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in
patients with morbid obesity?
Findings In this randomized clinical equivalence trial that included
240 adults with morbid obesity, the estimated mean percentage
excess weight loss at 5 years was 49% after laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy compared with 57% after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass, a difference that did not meet prespecified criteria
for equivalence.
Meaning This study did not demonstrate equivalence of
percentage excess weight loss at 5 years between laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass.

 primary end point was originally intended to be assessed at 1
year. Based on increasing understandingof the importance of
long-term outcomes after bariatric surgery, the primary end
pointwasrevisedtobeassessedat5-yearfollow-up,asthishad
no effect on the sample size calculation.
The predefined secondary end points included resolution
of obesity-related comorbidities, improvement of disease-
specific QOL measured by the Moorehead-Ardelt QOL score
(range, −3 to +3, with higher score indicating better QOL),6
and overall morbidity and mortality. Postoperatively, comor-
bidities were assessed as persisting (same medications as
before surgery), improved (reduction in medications), or
resolved (no medications needed). These definitions were
used for all of the recorded comorbidities (type 2 diabetes,
dyslipidemia, and hypertension). In addition, at 5-year
follow-up the remission of diabetes was defined and ana-
lyzed according to American Diabetes Association criteria7
(complete remission defined as glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]
value less than 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and fasting glucose
level less than 100 mg/dL [<5.6 mmol/L]; partial remission
defined as HbA1c value less than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and a
fasting glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L),
both for at least 1 year’
s duration in the absence of active
pharmacologic therapy or ongoing procedures. For dyslipid-
emia,thewholestudygroupwasalsoevaluatedforpossiblelipid
disturbances (changes in levels of total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol [LDL-C], and triglycerides) at all time points.
Thedecisiontodiscontinuedyslipidemiamedicationwasbased
on the treating physician’
s decision using European Society of
Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines.8
At 5-year follow-up, true remission of dyslipidemia as defined
by these guidelines (LDL-C level less than 115.8 mg/dL
[<3.0 mmol/L] and no dyslipidemia medications) was per-
formed for all patients with baseline dyslipidemia.
Postoperative complications were classified as major or
minor. Morbidity resulting in death, reoperation, hospital
stay exceeding 7 days, or need for blood transfusions of 4 or
more units constituted a major complication adapted from a
classification scheme for complications of endoscopic
sphincterotomy.9 All other postoperative adverse events
were classified as minor complications. For the 5-year follow-
up, all late complications recorded between 30 days and 5
years after surgery were also retrospectively classified
according to Clavien-Dindo classification10 (I: any deviation
in postoperative recovery; II: requiring pharmacological
treatment, blood transfusions, or parenteral nutrition; III:
requiring intervention [a: no general anesthesia, b: under
general anesthesia]; IV: life-threatening complication requir-
ing intensive care unit; V: death of patient).
Follow-Up
After the preliminary3 and 6-month early follow-up,4 patient
outcomes were assessed at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, with a follow-up
plan extending up to 20 years (7, 10, 15, and 20 years). Patients
were evaluated at outpatient control visits, and all prespeci-
fied data were thoroughly recorded. Patients lost to follow-up
were contacted multiple times by mail or telephone.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 2.
Sample size calculations were performed for percentage ex-
cessweightlossusinganequivalencedesign.Calculationswere
based on a test of mean difference between gastric bypass and
sleeve gastrectomy, assuming the mean of 60 and standard de-
viation of 20 in the gastric bypass group. An α level of .05 and
power of 90% were used in calculations. The prespecified
equivalence margins for the clinical significance of weight loss
differences between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy
were −9% to +9% excess weight loss11-13; the aim was to evalu-
ate the margins based on minimal clinically important differ-
ence. Based on these calculations, 108 patients per group were
needed, and taking into account 10% dropout rate, a total of
240 study patients were enrolled in the study.
Continuous variables were characterized using means and
standard deviations except for micronutrient levels, for which
mediansandrangeswereused.Categoricalvariableswerechar-
acterized using frequencies and percentages.
Equivalence of percentage excess weight loss between
the operations at different time points was evaluated using
repeated-measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
model included operation, time, center, and diabetes status
as independent variables, excess weight at the beginning of
the study as a covariate, and interaction of operation and
time. Confidence intervals (95%) for the difference between
the study groups were calculated at every time point, and
equivalence was evaluated using the predefined margins of
equivalence (−9 to 9). If the 95% CI of difference is within
equivalence margins, the groups are equivalent.
Repeated-measurements ANOVA was used to analyze
the dependent variables, ie, fasting plasma glucose levels
and HbA1c values for patients with diabetes and levels of
total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides for all pa-
tients. All of the models included operation, time, and center
as independent variables and also included interaction of
operation and time. In the analyses of fasting plasma glucose
and HbA1cvalues, preoperative use of insulin was also in-
cluded in the model as an independent variable. In the analy-
ses of lipid values, diabetes status was also included in the
model as an independent variable. Repeated-measurements
ANOVA tests for general differences across time points and,
withthetestofinteractionofoperationandtime,testswhether
thedifferencebetweentheoperationshaveanydifferencesbe-
tween the time points. According to the idea of repeated-
measurements ANOVA, the difference between the study
groups was evaluated separately at 4 points (0.5, 1, 3, and 5
years) only when the interaction of operation and time was sta-
tistically significant. If the interaction was not statistically sig-
nificant, the results are presented by main-effects operation
and time, meaning that mean estimates for operations are cal-
culated across time points and mean estimates for time points
are calculated for the whole dataset, not separately for opera-
tions. The QOL score was also analyzed using repeated-
measurements ANOVA but including only baseline and 5 years
in the analysis.
Normality of the residuals of the models was evaluated
visually and using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For skewed

 variables (HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose, HDL-C, and triglyc-
erides), logarithmic transformation was used to achieve nor-
mality. The analysis results were quantified using least-
squares mean (95% CI) estimates and difference (95% CI)
between operations. When logarithmic transformation was
used for analyses, estimates were transformed to the original
scale, but for those variables differences are not presented,
because back-transformed estimates for difference represent
the ratio of group means, not the difference. For categorical
variables, differences between study groups were studied
using Pearson χ2 or Fisher exact test. Post hoc analyses
included BMI for the whole study group and percentage
excess weight loss and BMI in patients with diabetes. All post
hoc analyses were performed using repeated-measurements
ANOVA as described above. Differences between groups at
the 5-year point regarding vitamin deficiencies in the whole
study group were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
P values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using
the step-down Bonferroni method of Holm. Analyses were
performed according to the intention-to-treat population,
ie, all patients were analyzed in their original intervention
group, and missing data were excluded from the analyses.
Because of missing values at at least 1 time point (60/240
patients [25%]), a sensitivity analysis using multiple impu-
tation was performed for the primary outcome (percentage
excess weight loss). Multivariate imputation by fully condi-
tional specification method was performed. The predictive
mean matching method was used to construct 10 imputed
datasets, and repeated-measurements ANOVA was per-
formed for each. The results of these sensitivity analyses
were compared with the original analysis of percentage
excess weight loss.
Two-sided P values less than .05 were considered statisti-
cally significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), and all figures were drawn with
R version 3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
Trial Patients
Among 240 patients randomized (mean age, 48 [SD, 9]
years; mean baseline BMI, 45.9 [SD, 6.0]; 69.6% women),
80.4% completed the 5-year follow-up. Of the randomized
patients, 2 in the group undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass did not undergo bariatric surgery, resulting in
a total of 238 operated patients. Baseline characteristics are
presented in Table 1; there were no differences in demo-
graphic characteristics between the study groups regarding
patient age, sex, BMI, and obesity-associated comorbidities.
After 5 years, 24 patients in the gastric bypass group and 23
patients in the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group were
lost to follow-up; the remaining 193 patients (80.4%) were
evaluated at 5-year follow-up. Figure 1 shows the flow of
participants through the trial.
Primary End Point
The estimated mean percentage excess weight loss at 5 years
was 49% (95% CI, 45%-52%) after sleeve gastrectomy and 57%
(95% CI, 53%-61%) after gastric bypass; percentage excess
weight loss data are presented in detail in Table 2, Figure 2,
Figure 3, and Figure 4. At 5 years, the model-based estimate
ofmeanpercentageexcessweightlosswas8.2percentageunits
(95% CI, 3.2%-13.2%) higher in the gastric bypass group than
in sleeve gastrectomy group. Predefined margins of equiva-
lence were −9 to 9; based on those limits, the groups are not
equivalent,becausethewholeconfidenceintervalisnotwithin
the margins. The difference in mean percentage excess weight
loss between the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass groups
did not meet the criteria for equivalence at any of the time
points (6 months and 1, 3, and 5 years). Gastric bypass re-
sulted in statistically greater weight loss than sleeve gastrec-
tomy at 5 years, but the difference was not clinically signifi-
cant, as the minimal clinically important difference of 9 is
within the confidence interval. The results were very similar
in sensitivity analyses in which multiple imputation was used
to fill in the missing values.
Secondary End Points
Type 2 Diabetes
At baseline, 101 patients (42%) had type 2 diabetes (52 sleeve
gastrectomy, 49 gastric bypass), and 29 were using insulin (16
sleeve gastrectomy, 13 gastric bypass). After 5 years there was
no significant difference between the study groups in diabe-
tes remission (P > .99). Complete remission was seen in 5 of
41 patients (12%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group and in 10 of
40 (25%) in the gastric bypass group. Improved glycemic con-
trol was seen at 3 and 5 years after surgery in both study groups
compared with baseline. After 5 years there was no statisti-
cally significant difference between the study groups in mean

 estimated fasting plasma glucose level: 135.1 (95% CI,
124.3-147.8) mg/dL (7.5 [95% CI, 6.9-8.2] mmol/L) in the
sleeve gastrectomy group compared with 120.7 (95% CI,
109.9-131.56.7) mg/dL (6.7 [95% CI, 6.1-7.3] mmol/L) in the gas-
tric bypass group, P = .052). There was no difference be-
tween the study groups regarding glycated hemoglobin; the
mean estimated HbA1c value across the follow-up time was
6.6% (95% CI, 6.4%-6.8%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group and
6.6% (95% CI, 6.4%-6.8%) in the gastric bypass group (P = .93)
(Table 3).
Dyslipidemia
At baseline, 83 patients (35%) had dyslipidemia. At 5-year
follow-up, 14 of 30 patients (47%) in the sleeve gastrectomy
group and 24 of 40 (60%) in the gastric bypass group had
discontinued dyslipidemia medications; 6 of 30 patients
(20%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group and 2 of 40 (5%) in
the gastric bypass group needed less medications; and no
improvement in dyslipidemia medication use was detected
in 10 of 30 patients (33%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group
and 14 of 40 (35%) in the gastric bypass group (P = .15).
All lipid values at all time points are reported in Table 4.
For the whole study group, there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference (P = .053) in total cholesterol values after 5
years between the groups: 189.2 (95% CI, 181.5-193.1) mg/dL
(4.9 [95% CI, 4.7-5.0] mmol/L) for the sleeve gastrectomy
group and 177.6 (95% CI, 173.8-185.3) mg/dL (4.6 [95% CI,
4.5-4.8] mmol/L) for the gastric bypass group. LDL-C values
were significantly lower (P = .02) in the gastric bypass group
at 5-year follow-up compared with the sleeve gastrectomy
group: 96.5 (95% CI, 88.0-100.4) mg/dL (2.5 [95% CI,
2.3-2.6] mmol/L) and 104.3 (95% CI, 100.4-112.0) mg/dL (2.7
[95% CI, 2.6-2.9] mmol/L), respectively. The mean esti-
mates of triglyceride values across the time were 109.7 (95%
CI, 102.7-116.8] mg/dL (1.2 [95% CI, 1.2-1.3] mmol/L) for the
sleeve gastrectomy group and 102.7 (95% CI, 96.5-109.7)
mg/dL (1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.2] mmol/L) for the gastric bypass
group (P = .18). Mean estimates of HDL-C values across time
were 53.3 (95% CI, 51.4-55.6) mg/dL (1.4 [95% CI,
1.3-1.4] mmol/L) and 53.7 (95% CI, 51.7-56.0) mg/dL (1.4
[95% CI, 1.3-1.5] mmol/L), respectively (P = .79), with no sta-
tistically significant differences between the study groups.
Of the 38 patients in the whole study group who discontin-
ued dyslipidemia medication, 22 had true dyslipidemia
remission (LDL-C level <115.8 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L] and no
dyslipidemia medications) at 5-year follow-up; the remis-
sion rate was 20% (6/30) in the sleeve gastrectomy group
and 40% (n = 16/40) in the gastric bypass group.
Hypertension
At baseline, 170 patients (71%) were using medication for
hypertension. After 5 years, 20 of 68 patients (29%) in the
sleeve gastrectomy group and 37 of 73 (51%) in the gastric
bypass group had discontinued hypertension medications;
24 of 68 patients (35%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group and
22 of 73 (30%) in the gastric bypass group needed less
hypertension medications compared with baseline; and no
improvement in hypertension medication use was detected
in 24 of 68 patients (35%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group
and 14 of 73 (19%) in the gastric bypass group (P = .02).
Quality of Life
At baseline, the mean QOL total score (Moorehead-Ardelt
QOL6) was 0.10 (SD, 0.94) in the sleeve gastrectomy group
and 0.12 (SD, 1.12) in the gastric bypass group; mean QOL
total scores were 0.85 (SD, 1.08) at 5 years after sleeve gas-
trectomy (n = 90) and 0.76 (SD, 1.01) after gastric bypass
(n = 86). The change in QOL did not differ significantly
between the study groups (P = .70 for operation × time
interaction). There was no statistically significant difference

 in QOL between groups (P = .85), but total QOL score
increased statistically significantly by 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9)
units from baseline to the 5-year follow-up point (P < .001).
Morbidity and Mortality
The 30-day and 6-month complications have been
reported,3,4 and detailed early complications (<30 days) and
late complications (>30 days) are reported in Table 5. For
this study, the late complications were evaluated from 30
days after surgery until the 5-year follow-up, with an overall
morbidity rate of 19% (n = 23) for sleeve gastrectomy and
26% (n = 31) for gastric bypass (P = .19). The late minor com-
plication rate (Clavien-Dindo I-IIIa)10 was 10.7% (n = 13) in
the sleeve gastrectomy group and 10.9% (n = 13) in the gas-
tric bypass group (P = .96). The late major complications in
both study groups were all reoperations; the late major
complication rate (Clavien-Dindo IIIb)10 was 8.3% (n = 10)
after sleeve gastrectomy and 15.1% (n = 18) after gastric
bypass (P = .10). Seven of the 10 reoperations after sleeve
gastrectomy were performed for severe reflux, with patients
undergoing conversion to gastric bypass at a median of 14
months (range, 6-59 months). In the gastric bypass group, 17
patients underwent reoperation for suspected internal her-
niation; all of these patients had closure of the mesenteric
defect at repeat laparoscopy. There was no treatment-
related mortality during the 5-year follow-up.

 Post Hoc Outcomes
The change in BMI differed significantly between the study
groups (P < .001 for operation × time interaction). At 5-year
follow-up, the mean estimate of BMI was 1.1 (95% CI, −0.5 to
2.6) units higher after sleeve gastrectomy, without statisti-
cally significant difference between the operations (P = .54).
For patients with diabetes, BMI results at 5 years were similar
to the results in the whole study group; the mean estimate of
BMI was 2.1 (95% CI, −0.2 to 4.5) units higher after sleeve
gastrectomy compared with gastric bypass (P = .29). For
patients with diabetes, study groups were not equivalent
with regard to percentage excess weight loss at any of the
points: at 5-year follow-up, the estimate of mean percent
excess weight loss was 11.7% (95% CI, 3.7%-19.7%) higher in
patients undergoing gastric bypass than in those undergoing
sleeve gastrectomy. These results are presented in detail in
Table 2 and Figure 3.
At 5-year follow-up, the median micronutrient levels, re-
gardless of possible vitamin supplementation, after sleeve gas-
trectomy and gastric bypass were 33 (range, 7-61) ng/mL (83
[range, 17-153] nmol/L) and 31 (range, 12-64) ng/mL (77 [range,
30-160]nmol/L)(P = .24),respectively,forvitaminD,54(range,

centage excess weight loss at 5 years. Although gastric bypass
comparedwithsleevegastrectomywasassociatedwithgreater
percentage excess weight loss at 5 years, the confidence in-
terval for the difference extended both above and below the
prespecified equivalence margin, and therefore no conclu-
sion can be drawn about whether gastric bypass is clinically
superior to sleeve gastrectomy. However, both procedures re-
sulted in sustained weight loss, with a mean excess weight loss
of 49% in the sleeve gastrectomy group and 57% in the gas-
tric bypass group. There were no statistically significant dif-
ferencesbetweensleevegastrectomyandgastricbypassforthe
secondary outcomes of type 2 diabetes remission, dyslipid-
emia resolution, QOL improvement, and late morbidity. Com-
pared with sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass resulted in bet-
ter resolution of hypertension, based on antihypertensive
medication use.
The effectiveness of bariatric procedures should be
assessed from long-term outcomes information, since obe-
sity is a chronic disease, as are its comorbidities.2 With 240
patients, the SLEEVEPASS trial3,4 is, to our knowledge, the
largest randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass. The Swiss Multicenter Bypass or Sleeve Study (SM-
BOSS) had a protocol very similar to that of the SLEEVEPASS
trial, included 217 patients, and had findings similar to those
from our study.14 Over long-term follow-up, gastric bypass
showed significantly better weight loss than sleeve gastrec-
tomy at each time point, evaluated by percentage excess
weight loss (Figure 4). These findings are consistent with
most previously published series15-18 and meta-analyses,19,20
taking into account the variation in definitions for reporting
weight loss outcomes after bariatric surgery. The difference
in weight loss between the gastric bypass and sleeve gastrec-
tomy groups increased with time. Longer-term follow-up
may help determine if these differences result from loss of
effect of sleeve gastrectomy or from greater weight loss after
gastric bypass.
In general, bariatric surgery has better outcomes than
does intensive medical therapy for treating type 2 dia-
betes.17,21-23 Using the American Diabetes Association triple
end point of HbA1c value, LDL-C level, and systolic blood
pressure as the primary outcome, the Diabetes Surgery Study
found that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass resulted in
better outcomes than did intensive medical management
using the Look AHEAD protocol.23 The Surgical Treatment
and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently
(STAMPEDE) trial also showed greater efficacy for both lapa-
roscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy than medical therapy alone in decreasing or
resolving hyperglycemia at 5-year follow-up.17 At 5 years,
there were no significant differences in diabetes control
between the 2 surgical procedures, but the single-surgeon,
single-institution STAMPEDE study was not powered for
detecting differences in this outcome.17
In this study, the diabetes remission rate did not differ
between the procedures at 5 years, but the diabetes remis-
sion rate was lower than that in the SM-BOSS trial.24 This
may be attributable to possible differences in preoperative
diabetes duration, because shorter diabetes duration at base-
line is associated with more favorable short-term remission
rates after bariatric surgery.25,26 Neither the current trial nor
SM-BOSS were powered to detect differences for diabetes
remission between sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass.4,24
However, 101 patients (42%) in this trial had baseline diabe-
tes, a rate that was higher compared with other randomized
clinical trials comparing sleeve gastrectomy and gastric
bypass.15,16,18,24,27 As was found in other studies,17 in a post
hoc analysis, the estimated mean percentage excess weight
loss difference between the procedures was higher for
patients with diabetes than for the whole study group, which
also included patients without diabetes.
Although the dyslipidemia remission rate was not signifi-
cantly different between the gastric bypass and sleeve gas-
trectomy groups, LDL-C levels were significantly lower in pa-
tients in the gastric bypass group than in those in the sleeve
gastrectomy group—findings consistent with similar observa-
tions made in other studies.24 Hypertension remission rates
were significantly better after gastric bypass, based on pa-
tients using fewer antihypertension medications. This obser-
vation is tempered by reliance on medication use as an indi-
cator for hypertension, since medication adherence may not
be optimal.28 This may explain the discrepancies observed in
this study between dyslipidemia remission rates estimated
from medication cessation relative to those estimated from
measured LDL-C values.
One potential drawback of sleeve gastrectomy is the ex-
acerbation or new onset of gastroesophageal reflux and high
incidence reported for Barrett esophagus after this pro-
cedure,29-31 although there are discrepancies in rates for
Barrett esophagus between the various studies.32 Neverthe-
less, some authors have suggested that the presence of severe
reflux and Barrett esophagus are contraindications for sleeve
gastrectomy.31,33 In the current study, 7 patients (6%) in the

 sleeve gastrectomy group underwent conversion from sleeve
gastrectomy to gastric bypass for severe reflux, and 11 (9%) re-
quired daily proton pump inhibitors. All of the patients in this
study underwent preoperative upper gastrointestinal endos-
copy and, if severe gastroesophageal reflux disease with large
hiatalherniawasfound,thosepatientswereexcludedfromthe
study; however, there was no standardized evaluation of hia-
tal hernia size or use of a validated symptom questionnaire.
In addition, 3 sleeve gastrectomy procedures were converted
intosingle-anastomosisduodeno-ilealbypassprocedureswith-
out any trial protocol consensus; these 3 cases were consid-
ered protocol violations. In the gastric bypass group, almost
all of the late reoperations were for suspected internal her-
nias. These conceivably could have been prevented by clo-
sureofmesentericdefectsduringgastricbypass,34,35sincethese
defects were not routinely closed in the operations per-
formed in this study.
When this trial was designed in 2007, it was common to
assess bariatric surgical success by reporting excess weight loss
or excess BMI loss. Since the time the study was designed, out-
come reporting standards were adopted, with percentage
weightlossrelativetobaselineweightnowbeingthestandard.5
The findings for percentage total weight loss are presented in
the eTable in Supplement 3 to facilitate comparison of these
findings with those from other studies.
This study has several strengths. Major advantages
include the large number of patients enrolled, the long-term
follow-up of 5 years with a high degree of follow-up (>80%),
and the randomized, multicenter, multisurgeon trial design,
making the study results more generalizable to routine sur-
gical practice.
This study also has several limitations. First, only a
small number (n = 430) of bariatric procedures were per-
formed in Finland (5.5 million inhabitants) at trial initiation
in 2008. A learning curve effect could have accounted for
some of the technical complications observed earlier in the
trial, resulting in a higher reoperation rate for gastric
bypass. Second, the study had a higher reoperation rate for
sleeve gastrectomy than reported in other studies,19 which
also may be based on learning curve effect. Third, insuffi-
cient information was available for patients excluded from
the study. Nevertheless, the trial population can be consid-
ered representative of the average bariatric surgery popula-
tion, because the study group included most patients

 undergoing bariatric surgery at the study hospitals during
the study enrollment period. Fourth, approximately 20% of
the patient population was lost to follow-up, precluding a
strict intention-to-treat analysis. However, the drop-out
rates were similar in both groups. Multiple-imputation
analysis suggested that there was little risk for bias when
percentage excess weight loss was compared between the 2
procedures. Fifth, reliable information regarding diabetes
duration at baseline was lacking, which constitutes a limita-
tion when evaluating the remission rate for type 2 diabetes,
because diabetes duration has been shown to be associated
with predicted long-term remission.36,37
Future studies should focus on assessing all factors affect-
ing the sustainable long-term results of these 2 bariatric pro-
cedures to enhance optimal preoperative selection of the best
possible procedure for each patient.
Conclusions
Amongpatientswithmorbidobesity,useoflaparoscopicsleeve
gastrectomy compared with use of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass did not meet criteria for equivalence in terms
of percentage excess weight loss at 5 years. Although gastric
bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy was associated with
greater percentage excess weight loss at 5 years, the differ-
ence was not statistically significant, based on the prespeci-
fied equivalence margins.
