Abstract
Background: Palliative care is expanding rapidly in the United States.
Objective: To examine variation in access to hospital palliative care.
Methods: Data were obtained from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Surveys� for Fiscal
Years 2012 and 2013, the National Palliative Care Registry�, the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare, the American
Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), web searches, and telephone interviews of hospital
administrators and program directors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine predictors of
hospital palliative care programs.
Results: Sixty-seven percent of hospitals with 50 or more total facility beds reported a palliative care program.
Institutional characteristics were strongly associated with the presence of a hospital palliative care program.
Ninety percent of hospitals with 300 beds or more were found to have palliative care programs as compared to
56% of hospitals with fewer than 300 beds. Tax status was also a significant predictor. Not-for-profit hospitals
and public hospitals were, respectively, 4.8 times and 7.1 times more likely to have a palliative care program as
compared to for-profit hospitals. Palliative care penetration was highest in the New England (88% of hospitals),
Pacific (77% of hospitals), and mid-Atlantic (77% of hospitals) states and lowest in the west south central (43%
of hospitals) and east south central (42% of hospitals) states.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates continued steady growth in the number of hospital palliative care
programs in the United States, with almost universal access to services in large U.S. hospitals and academic
medical centers. Nevertheless access to palliative care remains uneven and depends on accidents of geography
and hospital ownership.
Introduction
H
ospital palliative care programs have been shown
to enhance health care value for seriously ill persons
both in the inpatient and the community (home, nursing
home, office) setting.1 Whereas the growth of risk-sharing
delivery models are shifting care of the seriously ill to
community settings, hospitals are, and will remain for the
near future, a major and costly site of care. We have previ-
ously reported on the growth and development of hospital
palliative care programs.2–5 Building on our four previous
state-by-state comparative reports (published in 2001, 2005,
2008, and 2011), the current report uses newly available data
to track the growth of hospital palliative care programs across
the 50 states over the past four years and identifies areas
where persistent gaps in access remain. Additionally, as in
our prior reports, the study examined hospital and geographic
factors associated with the development of palliative care
programs and for the first time links data to regional health
care utilization and spending.
Methods
The methods were similar to those used in our prior re-
ports,2–5 with several additional modifications to enhance
reporting accuracy as noted below. This study was exempt

Data sources
Data were obtained from the National Palliative Care
Registry� for fiscal year 2013 (registry.capc.org), American
Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey� for fiscal years
2012 and 2013,6,7 the American Census Bureau’s 2013
American Community Survey (ACS),8 and from the Dart-
mouth Atlas of Healthcare (calendar year 2012).9 Supple-
mental data were provided through web searches and from
telephone interviews of hospital administrators and program
directors as detailed below.
Initial data on the presence of hospital palliative care
programs were obtained from the National Palliative Care
Registry. The National Palliative Care Registry is a repository
created by the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) and
the National Palliative Care Research Center (NPCRC) to
collect information about the operational features of hospital
palliative care programs (registry.capc.org/). Hospitals vol-
untarily enter operational data on an annual basis. These data
have been collected annually since 2008 and include 981
participating hospitals. The data are linked to the AHA annual
survey through the AHA hospital ID number.
Data on hospital characteristics were obtained from the
AHA annual survey for fiscal years 2012 and 2013.6,7 The
AHA surveys all member and nonmember hospitals in the
United States and its associated areas on an annual basis and
is considered the most comprehensive and authoritative
source on U.S. hospitals and their characteristics. Among the
almost 900 elements included in the survey, data are provided
on the type of authority responsible for establishing policy
concerning overall operation of the hospitals (federal gov-
ernment, nonfederal government, nongovernment not-for-
profit, and for-profit); clinical facilities and services offered
by the hospitals (e.g., general medical-surgical care, pediatric
care, various types of intensive care units, physical rehabil-
itation, psychiatric services, cardiac programs, AIDS care,
etc.); beds and utilization; revenues and expenses; and pro-
fessional staffing levels. For facilities and services the survey
also requests information on the manner in which a service is
provided (i.e., whether it is hospital owned, provided by the
hospital’s health system, and/or provided through a formal
contract between the hospital and another provider). The
survey also queries hospitals as to the presence of a palliative
care program. Response rates to the AHA Annual Survey
average 80%.7
County-level characteristics were obtained from five-year
estimates of the 2013 ACS from the U.S. Census Bureau;8 the
ACS collects nationwide information such as age, race, in-
come, education, and other important data. Census data were
merged with primary survey data via census bureau county
code. Data used in this study included level of education,
ethnic makeup, age distribution, and percentage of the county
population falling below the poverty line.
Physician supply, hospital mortality rates, and Medicare
and hospice spending rates for Hospital Service Area (HSA)
levels were obtained from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health-
care.9 HSAs are local health care markets for hospital care
and are delineated ZIP codes whose residents receive most of
their hospitalizations from the hospitals in that area.
Hospital inclusion and exclusion
Hospitals were included in this study if they admitted adult
patients and the majority of admissions were identified as
general medical-surgical, OB/GYN, cancer, or cardiac. We
excluded rehabilitation hospitals; psychiatric hospitals; sub-
acute and chronic care facilities; and eye, ear, nose, and throat
hospitals. General medical surgical and chronic disease
hospitals that restricted admissions primarily to children were
also excluded. Hospitals containing fewer than 50 beds were
excluded. A 50 bed cut-off was chosen, as hospitals smaller
than this are unlikely to be able support a full interdisci-
plinary (nurse, social worker, physician) palliative care
consultation team. All hospitals falling under federal control,
(e.g., U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) were excluded.
VA hospitals are under federal mandate to reach 100%
penetrance of palliative care programs.10 Hospitals that were
located outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia
and hospitals that did not respond to the AHA survey were
also excluded.
Identification of hospital palliative care programs
Concerns raised by correspondents to two of the authors
(DEM, RSM) as to the accuracy of the AHA’s reporting on
the presence of palliative care programs in prior reports led to
the development of a new methodology for this study. To
ensure the most accurate and complete representation of
hospital palliative care in the United States we completed a
new multistep process. We began by identifying all hospitals
that participated in the National Palliative Care Registry. We
queried the registry for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 for all
registrants reporting a palliative care program and cross-
matched these hospitals to the AHA survey. Hospitals that
were not contained within the National Palliative Care Reg-
istry underwent a web search to identify the presence of a
palliative care program. A hospital was considered to have a
palliative care program if the hospital website listed palliative
care under ‘‘Services,’’ displayed a palliative care program
page, or referred to palliative care programs/teams on a
health system or hospital webpage.
Finally, remaining hospitals without evidence of a pallia-
tive care program either from the National Palliative Care
Registry or through our web search were contacted by tele-
phone by a trained interviewer. The interviewer contacted the
main hospital number and asked to be connected to the pal-
liative care department or division. If the interviewer could
not make contact with a palliative care program, they also
contacted the following departments (if present) to query as
to the presence of a palliative care program: nursing admin-
istration, case management, geriatrics, oncology, pain man-
agement, spiritual services, hospice, or the office of the chief
nursing officer. Contact with a palliative care team member
or confirmation from the aforementioned departments re-
sulted in a ‘‘Yes’’ for a palliative care program for that
hospital. No contact or denial of a palliative care program
resulted in a ‘‘No.’’ Telephone and web searches were con-
ducted from June 2014 through February 2015.
Analyses
As in our two most recent reports,4,5 states were assigned a
letter grade based on the percentage of hospitals within the
PALLIATIVE CARE IN U.S. HOSPITALS
9
 state reporting palliative care programs. A grades were as-
signed to states in which over 80% of hospitals had palliative
care programs, B grades to states with 61%–80% of hospitals
with palliative care programs, C grades to states with 41%–
60% of hospitals having palliative care programs, D grades to
states with 21%–40% of hospitals having palliative care
programs, and F grades to states with 20% or fewer hospitals
having palliative care programs. Multivariable logistic
regression models were used to examine the associations
between hospital and regional characteristics and the pres-
ence of a palliative care program as described in our prior
studies.3–5 Census data were linked to AHA data at the hos-
pital county level and Dartmouth Atlas data were matched at
the HSA level. Additional analyses focused on large hospitals
(300 or more total facility beds) and Sole Community
Provider hospitals. Although representing only 26% of all
hospitals in the country, institutions with 300 beds or more
account for 56% of all hospital admissions. Sole Community
Provider hospital—a Medicare designation—is defined as a
hospital located more than 35 miles from other like hospitals
or otherwise serving as the sole provider of health care ser-
vices for a region secondary to limitations in local topogra-
phy or prolonged severe weather conditions.9 Analyses were
performed using Stata statistical software version 13.1 (Sta-
taCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Sixty-seven percent of hospitals (1591 of 2293) that met
our inclusion criteria and had analyzable data were found to
have palliative care programs (see Fig. 1 and Table 1).
Seventeen states received A grades (over 80% of hospitals
with palliative care programs) and seven states received a
grade of D (21%–40% of hospitals with palliative care
programs) (Fig. 2). Nine hundred and eighty-one (62%)
palliative care programs were identified through the Na-
tional Palliative Care Registry, and the remaining 610
(38%) were identified through web searches or telephone
surveys. As compared to our results, the false positive and
negative rates of the AHA survey’s reporting of the presence
of a palliative care program within its surveyed hospitals
were 9.0% and 6.2% respectively.
Hospital size
Ninety percent of hospitals with 300 beds or more were
found to have a palliative care program as compared to 56%
of hospitals with fewer than 300 beds (OR = 7.00, 95% CI
5.40, 9.06). Data on hospitals with 300 or more beds are in
Table 2. Hospitals of this size were 7.0 times more likely to
have a palliative care program as compared to smaller hos-
pitals (95% CI 5.40, 9.06, P < .001). Predictors of the pres-
ence of a palliative care program in hospitals with more than
300 beds included region of the country, tax status, county
education level, and being an American College of Surgery
approved cancer hospital or academic medical center. As in
the main analyses, Sole Community Provider hospitals with
more than 300 beds were significantly less likely to have a
palliative care program than non–Sole Community Provider
hospitals.

 Tax status
Tax status also was significantly associated with the
presence of a palliative care program. Not-for-profit hos-
pitals (71% of hospitals) and public hospitals (13% of
hospitals) were 4.8 times and 7.1 times respectively more
likely to have a palliative care program as compared to for-
profit hospitals (16% of hospitals), controlling for other
variables.

As in prior reports,3–5 regional characteristics remain
significantly associated with the presence of a hospital
palliative care program (see Fig. 1 and Table 2). Palliative
care penetration was highest in the New England (pene-
tration in 88% of hospitals), Pacific (77% of hospitals),
and mid-Atlantic (77% of hospitals) and lowest in the west
south central (43% of hospitals) and east south central
(42% of hospitals) states. States with the highest percent-
age of hospital palliative care programs (100%) were
Montana, New Hampshire, and Vermont; and states with
the lowest percentage of programs (less than 33% of
hospitals) were Alaska, Alabama, and Mississippi (see
Table 1 and Fig. 2).
Other institutional characteristics
Institutional characteristics in addition to hospital size were
strongly associated with the presence of a hospital palliative
care program as detailed in Table 2. Forty-five percent of
Sole Community Provider hospitals were found to have pallia-
tivecareprogramsascomparedto69%ofnon–SoleCommunity
Providers (OR= 0.51, 95% CI 0.36, 0.72). Other variables as-
sociated with the presence of a hospital palliative care program
in regression analyses were hospitals with an American College
of Graduate Medical Education accredited residency training
program (OR =1.58, 95% CI 1.14, 2.21); hospital members of
the Association of American Medical Colleges (i.e., those as-
sociated with a medical school) (OR= 2.31, 95% CI 1.10, 4.83);
hospitals operated by the Catholic Church (OR= 3.65, 95% CI
2.44, 5.45); status as an American College of Surgery approved
cancer hospital (OR= 2.09; 95% CI 1.62, 2.71); and institutions

Access to palliative care in the setting
of serious illness
Finally, using Dartmouth Atlas data, we examined access to
hospital palliative care for Medicare beneficiaries with serious

Prevalence and distribution of palliative care programs in U.S hospitals with 50 or more beds. States were
assigned a letter grade based on the percentage of hospitals with palliative care programs. A grades were assigned to states
in which over 80% of hospitals had palliative care programs, B grades to states with 61%–80% of hospitals with palliative

 chronic illness as defined by the Dartmouth Atlas.9 The
Dartmouth Atlas defines persons as seriously and chronically
ill if they have one or more of nine chronic conditions asso-
ciated with a high risk of death and have had at least one
nonsurgical hospital admission in the last two years of life. In
2012, 652,3361 Medicare beneficiaries with serious chronic
illness died in a HSA with a palliative care program (78% of all
hospital deaths of seriously ill Medicare patients).
Discussion
This state-by-state report demonstrates that access to
palliative care has improved considerably over the past
16 years (see Fig. 1). At the end of 2014, two-thirds (67%)
of U.S. hospitals with 50 beds or more were found to have
palliative care programs, up from 53% in our 2008 report4
(fiscal year 2006 data), and 15% in our first 2001 report2
(fiscal year 1998 data). The number of states with A grades
(more than 80% of the state’s hospitals reporting a palli-
ative care program) also increased, from 3% in the 2008
report4 (the first year we assigned grades) to 17% in this
report. For the first time, no state received a grade of F
(20% or fewer hospitals with palliative care programs).
Over three-quarters (78%) of Medicare hospital decedents
with serious and chronic illness who died in hospital died
in a HSA with a palliative care program. Important gaps
still remain, however. As in prior reports, variation in
access to palliative care based on region and hospital size
persists. Thirty-three percent of U.S. hospitals with 50 or
more beds report no palliative care services, and in one-
third of the states fewer than 60% of hospitals have a
palliative care program.
Most large hospitals now offer palliative care
services
As of 2014, over 90% of the nation’s largest hospitals—
those accounting for over half of all admissions—have

 palliative care programs. Even in this category of large
hospitals, however, where you live matters. For example, in
the east south central and west south central regions, fewer
than 75% of large hospitals report palliative care programs
(see Table 3). Nationally, Sole Community Provider hospi-
tals are less likely to provide palliative care, with 45% of
these hospital types having programs.
For-profit hospitals report lower rates of palliative
care services
After geography and hospital size, hospital tax status is the
most significant predictor of access to hospital palliative care,
and the gap between for-profits and not-for-profit hospitals
has widened since our last report. For-profit hospitals of any
size are less likely to provide palliative care services than
nonprofit hospitals. Among hospitals with 50 beds or more,
23% of for-profit hospitals reported a palliative care program,
in contrast to 78% of nonprofit hospitals and 59% of public
hospitals. In hospitals with 300 beds or more, 54% of for-
profit hospitals report palliative care programs, compared to
94% of nonprofit and 93% of public hospitals. In the east
south central and west south central regions, prevalence of
palliative care programs in for-profit hospitals averaged 10%
and 18%, respectively. The reasons are unknown for differ-
ences in palliative care availability in for-profit as compared
to nonprofit and public hospitals.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study that should be
noted. Due to the limitations of the dataset we are only able to
examine the prevalence of palliative care programs and do
not, as yet, have detailed information as to their structures,
staffing, hospital penetration rates (e.g., the number of pa-
tients seen), and the quality of care they provide. Although
our hospital telephone and web surveys reflect 2014 preva-
lence rates, data for our covariates are from the most recent
versions of the AHA survey, the Dartmouth Atlas, and the
ACS, which date to 2012 and 2013. Finally, we should note
that the registry data are self-reported by individual programs
and we did not conduct additional verification of these pro-
grams. Nevertheless, as the registry requires detailed re-
porting of palliative care structures and processes, we are
confident that submission of registry data is an accurate re-
flection of the presence of a hospital program.
Conclusions
This report demonstrates continued steady growth in the
number of hospital palliative care programs in the United

DUMANOVSKY ET AL.
 States, with almost universal access to such services in large
U.S. hospitals and academic medical centers. Nevertheless
access to palliative care remains uneven and continues to
depend on accidents of geography, hospital size, and hospital
ownership. One-third of U.S. hospitals report no palliative
care services of any kind, and access to palliative care in
community settings (home, nursing home, assisted living) is
limited for people who are not hospice-eligible. Ad-
ditionally, the presence of a palliative care program in a
hospital does not necessarily mean that seriously ill patients
needing palliative care actually receive palliative care
services. As a result, most people with serious illness are
unlikely to receive the care they need throughout their
course of illness. Making palliative care available to the
much larger population of the seriously ill who are neither
hospitalized nor hospice-eligible is perhaps the single
largest opportunity to improve value in in the U.S. health
care system. As called for in a recent Institute of Medicine
report,11 opportunities to improve access to palliative care
include broad workforce training in the core principles and
practices of palliative care; regulatory and accreditation
requirements for high-quality palliative care services in
health care settings; investment in research to strengthen the
quality of care; and development of valid, actionable, and
feasible measures of quality of care for this complex and
vulnerable patient population.
