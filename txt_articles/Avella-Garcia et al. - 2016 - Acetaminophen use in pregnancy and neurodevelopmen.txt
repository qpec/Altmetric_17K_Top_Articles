Abstract
Background: Acetaminophen is extensively used during pregnancy. But there is a lack of
population-representative cohort studies evaluating its effects on a range of neuropsy-
chological and behavioural endpoints. We aimed to assess whether prenatal exposure to
acetaminophen is adversely associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1 and 5
years of age.
Methods: This Spanish birth cohort study included 2644 mother-child pairs recruited dur-
ing pregnancy. The proportion of liveborn participants evaluated at 1 and 5 years was
88.8% and 79.9%, respectively. Use of acetaminophen was evaluated prospectively in
two structured interviews. Ever/never use and frequency of use (never, sporadic, persist-
ent) were measured. Main neurodevelopment outcomes were assessed using Childhood
Autism Spectrum Test (CAST), Conner’s Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT)
and ADHD-DSM-IV form list. Regression models were adjusted for social determinants
and co-morbidities.
Results: Over 40% of mothers reported using acetaminophen. Ever-exposed offspring had
higher risks of presenting more hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms [incidence rate ratio
(IRR) ¼ 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.98), K-CPT commission errors (IRR ¼ 1.10,

 1.03–1.17), and lower detectability scores (coefficient b ¼ �0.75, �0.13–�0.02). CAST
scores were increased in ever-exposed males (b ¼ 0.63, 0.09–1.18). Increased effect sizes
of risks by frequency of use were observed for hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (IRR ¼
2.01, 0.95–4.24) in all children, K-CPT commission errors (IRR ¼ 1.32, 1.05–1.66) and detect-
ability (b ¼ �0.18, �0.36–0.00) in females, and CAST scores in males (b ¼ 1.91, 0.44–3.38).
Conclusions: Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with a greater number
of autism spectrum symptoms in males and showed adverse effects on attention-related
outcomes for both genders. These associations seem to be dependent on the frequency
of exposure.

Introduction
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an over-the-counter medi-
cation that is widely used by pregnant women as an anti-
pyretic and analgesic.1 Nevertheless, there is evidence
linking prenatal and early life acetaminophen use with al-
terations of neurodevelopment.2–5
The prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD) and autism spectrum conditions (ASC) has
increased during recent decades,6 reaching around 5% and
1% of children in Western countries, respectively.7,8 The
factors influencing this trend are unclear, but environmen-
tal factors, such as acetaminophen use, may be potential
contributors.6 An ecological correlation between early life
acetaminophen use and ASC prevalence4 suggests an asso-
ciation. Recent cohort studies also report a harmful action
of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment, especially regard-
ing ADHD-related outcomes.2,3,5
Further assessment of the effects of prenatal exposure to
acetaminophen on child development is warranted using
prospective in-person neuropsychological evaluation of
children. Continuous measures of neurological outcomes
are also needed to better explore milder dysfunctions that
may not be severe enough to reach diagnostic thresholds or
require the use of medication. Therefore, the aim of this
study is to evaluate whether maternal use of acetamino-
phen during pregnancy is adversely associated with child
neurodevelopment at 1 and 5 years of age, by using data
from the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) project to
address these issues.
Methods
Study population
The INMA Project’s main objective is to examine the
health effects of early life exposures9 in a birth cohort
including participants from different regions of Spain.
Participants were recruited from four different regions dur-
ing the time periods that follow: Asturias (2004–07),
Gipuzkoa (2006–08), Sabadell (2004–07) and Valencia
(2004–05). Mothers were considered eligible for inclusion
if they were residents in the cohort area, at least 16 years
old, were carrying a singleton pregnancy and were plan-
ning to give birth at the reference hospital. Mothers who
had participated in an assisted fertility programme and
those with communication difficulties were excluded
(Appendix 1, available as Supplementary data at IJE on-
line). For the regional cohorts, the proportion of partici-
pants in INMA out of the women identified as eligible was
60% for Sabadell, 54% for Valencia, 45% for Asturias
and 68% for Gipuzkoa. For Sabadell, there was a higher
educational
level
among
participants
compared
with
Key Messages
• Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase autism spectrum symptoms in male children.
• Maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy may be harmful to attention function and may be associated with
a higher risk of hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms in the offspring.
• Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was not found to be associated with effects on cognitive, motor or social
development.

 non-participants, for Gipuzkoa a higher proportion of
working mothers participated and for Valencia there was
also a higher proportion of older women and working
mothers among participants. There were no differences be-
tween participants and non-participants in Valencia. At 1
and 5 years of age, 88.8% and 79.9% of all children live-
born to recruited mothers were included in the study.
Appendix 2 (available as Supplementary data at IJE on-
line) describes participant disposition throughout the
study. Written consent was obtained from all participants
at recruitment and at each follow-up. Approval was given
by the Institut Municipal d’Investigacio
´ Me
`dica, Barcelona
and the ethics committees of each participating institution.
Acetaminophen exposure
Data were collected prospectively by interviewing the ex-
pectant mothers twice, at weeks 12 and 32 of pregnancy,
using standardized questionnaires completed by trained
evaluators. Exposure information was obtained by asking
the question ‘Have you taken any medication (sporadically
or continuously) since 1 month before becoming pregnant
or during this pregnancy?’ If the answer was positive, the
name of the medication, dose, duration, gestational age at
use and the indication as reported by the mother were
enquired using open questions. All medications taken dur-
ing pregnancy or 1 month before pregnancy were docu-
mented in order to consider the uncertainty of the date of
conception. At week 32, mothers were asked about use of
medication after week 12. Data were coded by a pharma-
cologist. Acetaminophen could have been used as a single
drug or as a fixed-dose combination. Mothers were classi-
fied as users of acetaminophen during pregnancy if they
had taken any dose of acetaminophen at any time up to
week 32 of pregnancy or the month before becoming preg-
nant.
Otherwise,
they
were
considered
non-exposed.
Gestational age at acetaminophen use was used to identify
and determine the number of trimesters of exposure. If
mothers had taken acetaminophen in the month previous
to pregnancy, exposure was considered to have occurred
during the first trimester. Indication for use of acetamino-
phen was classified as analgesia, infection or other indica-
tions. Frequency of acetaminophen use was defined as
never, sporadic (use of any dose in one or two trimesters)
or persistent (use of any dose in all three trimesters).
Measures of neurodevelopmental outcomes
Neuropsychological development was assessed at a mean
child age of 14.84 [standard deviation (SD): 2.69] months
using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID).10
Children were tested again at a mean age of 4.8 (SD: 0.62)
years
with
a
battery
of
tests:
McCarthy
Scales
of
Children’s Abilities (MCSA)11 to evaluate cognitive and
psychomotor development, California Preschool Social
Competence Scale (CPSCS) for assessment of social compe-
tence,12 Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST)13 which
quantifies autism spectrum symptoms in children (each
point represents one symptom of ASC with a cut-off of 15
or more points, having a 100% sensitivity and 97% speci-
ficity for ASC14), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
Criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition form list (ADHD-DSM-
IV)15 for identification of inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity symptoms (which are as valid for ADHD diag-
nosis in children from 2 to 5 years of age as they are in
older
children16)
and
Conner’s
Kiddie
Continuous
Performance Test (K-CPT)17, a computerized test that
evaluates attention function, reaction time, accuracy and
impulse control. Measures on K-CPT include: omission
errors in which a target stimulus is presented but the child
fails to respond to it; commission errors in which the child
responds to a non-target stimulus; HRT-SE (Hit Reaction
Time Standard Error) which corresponds to the variation
in time of latency before a response; and detectability
which shows the capacity to distinguish target from non-
target stimuli. These K-CPT variables have all been corre-
lated to ADHD symptoms and have been repeatedly used
for ADHD research.18,19
A common protocol was followed for evaluation. BSID
and MSCA were performed by a trained psychologist who
also administered the CAST questionnaire to the child’s
parents in order to increase CAST score accuracy. ADHD-
DSM-IV and CPSCS were teacher-rated (for details on all
tests see Appendix 3, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online).
Other variables
Standardized questionnaires were used to collect data
on other variables of interest such as socio-demographic
characteristics, mothers’ medical history, and child health-
related events. Data on other variables such as anthropo-
metric measures or parental mental health and cognitive
scores were obtained through manual review of clinical
records, tests performed by a trained psychologist or self-
completed rating scales (Appendix 3).
Statistical analysis
All outcome scores were treated as continuous variables,
rather than using cut-off points to evaluate the outcomes.
Multivariable linear regression models were used to esti-
mate the effects of acetaminophen exposure on BSID,

 MSCA, CPSCS, K-CPT HRT-SE and detectability scores.
The remaining K-CPT outcomes and ADHD-DSM-IV
symptom scores were evaluated using negative binomial re-
gression models to account for over-dispersion of the data,
and results are shown as IRR (incidence rate ratios) which
should be interpreted as relative risks. CAST scores were
analysed with both linear regression and negative binomial
regression models obtaining consistent results with similar
P-values and are given as linear regression coefficients
which show the difference between groups in terms of the
number of ASC symptoms. Pooled analyses of data from
the four study regions were performed as there was no
interaction (P ¼ 0.658 at 1 year and P ¼ 0.393 at 5 years
of age) between the exposure and the regional cohorts in
relation to the outcome.
To address confounding, we adjusted for a series of pre-
defined variables that were forced to remain in the models.
Predefined variables were selected based on previous litera-
ture2,3,12,19 (i.e. region, child gender, age at testing, gesta-
tional age at birth, quality of test as rated by the
performing psychologist-only for BSID and MSCA, mater-
nal social class, IQ, education and whether the mother re-
ported having any chronic illness, fever or urinary tract
infection-not necessarily related to acetaminophen use-dur-
ing pregnancy; for outcomes at 1 year of age, child age at
testing was adjusted for prematurity). Other covariates
were included in the models only when they showed a
crude association with both the exposure and the outcome
(P-values < 0.20) and caused a change > 5% in the regres-
sion coefficient of acetaminophen when they were intro-
duced one by one in the basic model (Appendix 4,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). See result
table footnotes for the covariates retained in each model
(Tables 2 and 3).
Confounding by indication was addressed by including
reported maternal chronic illness, fever or urinary tract in-
fections at any time during pregnancy in all models.
Sensitivity analyses were performed by: (i) excluding moth-
ers with each of these conditions; (ii) excluding mothers
with any of these; and (iii) including exposed mothers by
indication (analgesia/infection) to evaluate possible ‘within
exposure group’ variations by indication.
We assessed outcome-association differences between
never and ever exposed groups, exposure in specific trimes-
ters (or combinations of these) and frequency of acet-
aminophen use. Finally, because previous literature20,21
suggests gender differences in the prevalence and clinical
manifestations of ASC and ADHD, the exposure inter-
action by gender for the related scales used here (ADHD-
DSM-IV, K-CPT, CAST) was assessed. An interaction was
found in relation to K-CPT and CAST outcomes, so we
stratified these results by gender. The relationship between
ADHD-DSM-IV
and
CAST
scores
was
assessed
by
Spearman correlation. Sensitivity analyses were done eval-
uating the association between prenatal acetaminophen ex-
posure and CAST scores after excluding children who met
ADHD-DSM-IV form list diagnostic criteria for ADHD.
Further analyses examined the association between pre-
natal acetaminophen use and ADHD-DSM-IV symptoms
after excluding children with CAST scores compatible with
a possible diagnosis of ASC (score > 15).
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA Special
Edition 12.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Results
In all, 43% of children evaluated at age 1 (n ¼ 2195) and
41% of those assessed at age 5 (n ¼ 2001) were exposed to
acetaminophen up to gestational week 32. Analgesia was
the main indication for use (66% of reported indications).
Overall, mothers had a mean age of 31 years; 37% had a
university degree, 5% reported fever, 11% reported urin-
ary tract infection and 32% reported having chronic illness
during pregnancy. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the
study population for both follow-ups. Exposed mothers
were younger and had a lower education level than non-
exposed mothers. Compared with the mothers of study
participants, the mothers of children who did not partici-
pate in the follow-ups were younger, more likely to come
from countries other than Spain, presented a lower educa-
tion level and social class stratum, were more likely to
have smoked during pregnancy and were less likely to have
breastfed their children (results not shown).
Hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and attention
function (K-CPT)
In Table 2, we present the associations between prenatal
exposure to acetaminophen and child neurodevelopment
outcomes at 5 years of age. Exposed children showed
a
higher
risk
of
presenting
hyperactivity/impulsivity
symptoms than non-exposed children (IRR ¼ 1.41, 95%
CI 1.01–1.98), a greater risk of K-CPT commission
errors (IRR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.17) and lower
detectability scores (b ¼ �0.75, 95% CI � 0.13–�0.02),
than
non
exposed
children
after
full
multivariate
adjustment.
Table 3 presents exposure-outcome associations taking
into
account
the
frequency
of
acetaminophen
use.
Persistently exposed children showed poorer attention func-
tion as evidenced by greater variability of K-CPT HRT-SE,
and more K-CPT omission errors (IRR ¼ 1.29, 95% CI
1.02–1.64) compared with non-exposed children. Indeed,
such outcomes presented association trends (Table 3

tion function (commission errors and detectability) was
modified by gender (P for interaction in Table 3 footnotes).

tom scores by frequency of acetaminophen use, in which we
observed a significant association trend (P trend ¼ 0.03) for
hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, but no modification ef-
fect by child gender.
ASC symptoms
In exposed male children, there was an increase in CAST
symptom scores (b ¼ 0.63, 95% CI 0.09–1.18), that dif-
fered significantly from the result found in female peers,
who showed a certain decrease in CAST scores (P inter-
action
¼
0.01)
(Table
2).
Furthermore,
persistently
exposed male children presented more autism spectrum
symptoms (b ¼ 1.91, 0.44–3.38), and this association
showed a P for trend ¼ 0.006 by increasing frequency of
the exposure (Table 3). In females there was no clear trend
by frequency of exposure.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding mothers re-
porting: (i) fever (eTable 2); (ii) chronic illness (eTables 3
and 4, available as Supplementary data at IJE online); (iii)
urinary tract infection (data not shown); or (iv) any of
these three conditions (data not shown), during pregnancy;
as well as analyses including only mothers whose indica-
tion for acetaminophen use was analgesia (eTables 5 and
6, available as Supplementary data at IJE online) or infec-
tion (eTables 7 and 8, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). The results of these analyses were similar, fol-
lowing the same direction of the effect and dose-response
trends for acetaminophen.
CAST and ADHD-DSM-IV scores showed a Spearman
correlation of 0.21 (P-value < 0.001). The association by
co-occurrence of ADHD and ASC cases (according to
ADHD-DSM-IV form list and CAST criteria), was moder-
ate (eTable 9, available as Supplementary data at IJE

showed virtually no change (eTable 11, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online), with similar dose-
response trends.
No changes were observed after adjustment for other
maternal medication use during pregnancy (data not
shown). No different association patterns emerged from
analysis by exposure in specific trimesters or their combin-
ations (data not shown).
Other neurodevelopmental outcomes
No differences between acetaminophen exposure groups
(ever exposed vs non-exposed) were found in relation to
the other developmental outcomes, for: BSID evaluating
mental and psychomotor development at 1 year of age
(b ¼ 0.75, 95% CI �0.75–2.25), MSCA assessing cognitive
and motor development at 5 years of age (b ¼ �0.21, 95%
CI �1.70–1.28) or CPSCS examining social competence at
5 years of age (b ¼ �1.15, 95% CI �3.16–0.87) in the fully
adjusted models (eTable 12, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online).
Discussion
In this study, over 40% of children were exposed to acet-
aminophen in utero. Exposure was associated with lower
attention function development as measured by K-CPT par-
ameters and with presenting greater risk for more ADHD-
DSM-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. Exposure was
also related to a greater number of CAST autism spectrum
symptoms in male children. Similar findings were observed
in relation to the frequency of acetaminophen use, suggest-
ing a dose-response effect. No changes in general cognitive
or social development were observed.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to
report an independent association between the use of acet-
aminophen during pregnancy and autism spectrum symp-
tomatology in exposed children. It is also the first paper to
report differential gender effects of prenatal acetamino-
phen exposure on neurodevelopment.
In our study, there was a weak positive correlation
between ADHD-DSM-IV and CAST scores, which was
expected because ADHD and ASC features frequently co-
occur in the same individuals. Indeed, both share similar
neuropsychological substrates despite being considered two
distinct disorders and have similar epidemiological charac-
teristics such as being more prevalent in males and having
increased in prevalence in recent decades.22 Therefore, it
was important to analyse whether the associations between
acetaminophen exposure and ADHD and ASC symptoms
were independent from each other. The results of our sensi-
tivity analyses suggest separate adverse effects of this expos-
ure on each of the outcomes. Different mechanisms may
explain acetaminophen’s harmful influence on neurodevel-
opment. These include the stimulation of the endocannabi-
noid system which could affect neuronal differentiation,
axonal migration, synapse positioning or immune modula-
tion,23,24,25 toxicity due to deficits in sulphation capacity
(reduced during pregnancy and in some autistic chil-
dren)1,4,26 and oxidative stress.27 Finally, acetaminophen
may act as an endocrine disruptor affecting testicular func-
tion and the production of androgens, which could interfere
with fetal brain development.28,29
The contrasting effects of acetaminophen exposure by
gender in this study could be linked to sex differences in the
metabolism of acetaminophen. Animal studies have sug-
gested that male mice undergo greater toxicity than female
mice after being administered a similar dose of acetamino-
phen.30 Furthermore, the male brain may be more vulner-
able to early life stressors20 and this could explain why
neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood, such as ASC and
ADHD, are more prevalent in male children.8,31 Our dis-
similar results by gender suggest that androgenic endocrine
disruption (to which male brains could be more sensitive)
may be a strong candidate as an explanatory mechanism for
the association between acetaminophen use and ASC symp-
toms. Studies on other endocrine disruptors such as
bisphenol A have also documented contrasting effects on
neurodevelopment according to gender,32 but to our know-
ledge this is the first study to report this regarding fetal
exposure to acetaminophen.
Our findings agree with reports of an association be-
tween prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and ADHD
behaviours, diagnosis or medication use in childhood2,3,5
and with an ecological study that reported an association
with ASC prevalence.4 Since we did not use cut-off points
to evaluate the outcomes, a strength of our study is that it
links prenatal exposure to acetaminophen to ADHD and
ASC symptoms in a manner that goes beyond examining
only disorders, to include milder dysfunctions that are
more widespread in the population. A novelty was the use
of standardized in-person evaluation of the children by
trained psychologists, computer-based measures, teacher-
rated scales and specific symptom diagnostic tools for
ADHD and ASC symptoms. These proceedings are more
objective for neurobehavioural assessment than the self-
reported questionnaires used previously.2,3,5,12 Another
strength is the use of a prospective non-clinical birth co-
hort, with increased potential for generalizability of the re-
sults. Finally, the use of multiple endpoints provides a
comprehensive evaluation of different areas of child
neurodevelopment.

 We were unable to evaluate the effects of dosage be-
cause of mothers’ difficulties in recalling the dose taken.
For this reason, we used a proxy of the frequency of acet-
aminophen exposure (never, sporadic, persistent), which
suggested a trend with growing exposure but which does
not allow for differentiating how many doses of acet-
aminophen were taken in each trimester. Since ADHD and
ASC have been associated with maternal infection and in-
flammation,33,34 despite adjustment for reported maternal
chronic illness, urinary tract infection and fever, residual
confounding by indication could still be a limitation.
However, this is unlikely to be a major concern after sensi-
tivity analyses regarding maternal illness and the indication
for
acetaminophen
use
hardly
changed
the
results.
Reduced sample sizes limited our possibility of running
further sensitivity analyses (such as including only: mothers
with fever or chronic illness during pregnancy), which
could have further confirmed that indication bias was not
present. Other limitations include unmeasured genetic con-
founding, as ADHD and ASC may have genetic compo-
nents35,36 (although a previous study that adjusted for this
using data from siblings also documented deleterious ef-
fects of prenatal paracetamol exposure on neurodevelop-
ment3), residual confounding from other sources and
reliance on maternal report (which can be imprecise) for
exposure measurement. Finally, since we have no informa-
tion on acetaminophen use after week 32, there may be
some misclassification of the exposure.
In our study, there was no differential loss to follow-up
related to exposure or socioeconomic status, since preva-
lence was similar at both follow-ups (1 and 5 years), reduc-
ing the likelihood of loss to follow-up bias. However,
about 50% of the women who were approached for re-
cruitment participated, with a slight tendency for higher
socioeconomic status among refusals. Because of this, ex-
trapolation of the results to the general population requires
caution. Also, residual confounding due to higher exposure
prevalence in mothers with a lower educational level can-
not be ruled out. Nevertheless, adjustment for socioeco-
nomic status and education (as well as other covariates),
makes this unlikely.
ADHD is the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder of
childhood and ASC, although less prevalent, can produce im-
portant functional compromise. Comparing persistently
exposed to non-exposed children, we have detected an in-
crease of around 30% in the risk of detriment of some atten-
tion function measures, and an increase of almost two
clinical symptoms of ASC in exposed male children, com-
pared with non-exposed males. Acetaminophen use has been
documented to be present in 46–56% of pregnancies in sev-
eral developed countries.2,3,5 This widespread exposure
could increase the number of children with sub-diagnostic
threshold symptomatology of ADHD and ASC and could
worsen the severity of cases in the general population.
Future studies should use large cohorts with more pre-
cise exposure measurement, examine the potentially harm-
ful effects of acetaminophen use in neonates, assess the
risk/benefit relationship of use in pregnant women and in-
fants undergoing fever or pain-related distress and evaluate
therapeutic alternatives as well as the mechanisms through
which acetaminophen could produce neurotoxicity.
Conclusions
This is the first cohort study to show that gestational ex-
posure to acetaminophen may increase symptoms of ASC
in male children. Our results also suggest that prenatal ex-
posure to this medication can affect attention function at 5
years of age, affecting males and females differently.
Further, our results suggest an association with hyperactiv-
ity/impulsivity behaviours for all children. Finally, these as-
sociations would appear to be dependent on the frequency
of exposure, but further dosage assessments are warranted.

Proper use of medicine is important for public health as
well as clinical medicine. Clinicians need to treat diseases
well and public health epidemiologists should take an
interest in potential side effects of the drugs. Often both
the clinical and public health epidemiologists share inter-
ests in these prognostic and aetiological factors. Due to
concerns of ‘confounding by indication’, the clinical epi-
demiologist will prefer evidence from a randomized con-
trol trial (RCT) if possible. Observational studies on side
effects that are not related to the treated disease, and there-
fore not necessarily subject to confounding by indication,
can often provide valid results, given these studies can suf-
ficiently control for other sources of bias and confounding.
The main concern in Avella-Garcia’s study1 perhaps is
not confounding by indication but confounding by genetic
factors. If genes causing autism spectrum conditions (ASC)
also lead to frequent use of medication, including a com-
mon painkiller like acetaminophen, a non-causal back-
door path is open. The confounding structure is illustrated
in this directed acyclic graph (DAG):
Genes
fi
Child ASC
;
Maternal ASC
fi
Acetaminophen intake
The graph links maternal acetaminophen intake with child
ASC via the non-causal back door; Child ASC / Genes !
Maternal ASC ! Acetaminophen intake. This path can be
closed by adjusting for genes (if recorded and known) or
partly by adjusting for maternal symptoms of ASC, which
is what is done in most studies. Using a sibling-comparison
design may also to some extent address this genetic con-
founding. In the study,1 the authors adjusted for diseases/
symptoms that are treatable by acetaminophen, but not for
ASC status in mothers (or fathers), leaving the possible
genetic confounding open.
Drug use in pregnancy is usually not backed up by
RCTs for ethical reasons. If the drug passed the placenta
barrier–most drugs do–they will expose the developing
fetus, and potential health problems are quite unpredict-
able. Most research interest in this setting has been given
to congenital abnormalities probably related to the thali-
domide disaster in the 1960s,2 but we should keep in mind
that many other side effects are possible. If the drug passes
the fetal blood-brain barrier, mental problems should also
be addressed. It is strange that acetaminophen has not been
well studied concerning the potential transgenerational
side effects. Most people buying a drug over the counter or
even in a supermarket, will consider this drug to be safe
even for their unborn child if taken during pregnancy.
A number of recent research findings indicated this may
not be true, perhaps related to a potential hormonal dis-
ruptive effect;3 but whatever the possible mechanism could
be, these findings give reasons for concern, also for regula-
tory bodies. We have seen prenatal exposure to acetamino-
phen being related to cryptorchidism,4 asthma5 and now
also
functional
effects
especially–but
not
limited
