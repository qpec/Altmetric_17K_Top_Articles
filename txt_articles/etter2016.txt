Effects of Large Financial Incentives
for Long-Term Smoking Cessation
A Randomized Trial
Jean-François Etter, PHD, Felicia Schmid, MA
ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND It is not known whether large financial incentives enhance long-term smoking cessation rates outside
clinical or workplace settings.
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to test whether large financial incentives improved long-term smoking
cessation rates in low-income smokers, in a general population setting, without face-to-face or telephone counseling.
METHODS This was a 2-arm, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial, with follow-up after 3, 6, and 18
months. Participants were 805 low-income smokers enrolled between 2011 and 2013 from the general population in
Geneva, Switzerland. We randomly assigned participants to receive either booklets plus access to a smoking cessation
website (control group, n ¼ 404), or the same intervention plus financial incentives (intervention group, n ¼ 401).
Incremental financial rewards, to a maximum of U.S. $1,650, were offered for biochemically verified abstinence at 1, 2,
and 3 weeks, and 1, 3, and 6 months. No in-person counseling, telephone counseling, or medications were provided.
The primary outcome was continuous abstinence between 6 months (end of incentives) and 18 months (12 months after
the incentives ended), verified by expired carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine. We also assessed biochemically verified
7-day abstinence at 3, 6, and 18 months.
RESULTS Rates of continuous abstinence between months 6 and 18 were 9.5% in the incentive group and 3.7% in the
control group (p ¼ 0.001). Rates of 7-day abstinence were higher in the incentive group than in the control group at
3 (54.9% vs. 11.9%; p < 0.001), 6 (44.6% vs. 11.1%; p < 0.001), and 18 months (18.2% vs. 11.4%; p ¼ 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS In low-income smokers who did not receive face-to-face or telephone smoking cessation counseling,
large financial incentives increased long-term rates of smoking cessation. (Financial incentives for smoking cessation

T
he burden
of
smoking-related
disease
is
borne
disproportionately
by
the
least
affluent people because of the high preva-
lence
of
smoking
in
this
group
(1).
To
reduce
smoking-related health disparities, it is important
to
design
smoking
cessation
interventions
that
reach and are effective in low-income smokers. As
this population may be harder to reach with tradi-
tional
information
and
education
interventions
(2,3), other approaches need to be explored, partic-
ularly those that address the financial stress in this
group.

 Financial
incentives
are
effective
for
smoking cessation while they are in place,
but it is not clear whether they have a sus-
tained effect, possibly because most previous
studies used small incentives and did not
assess long-term outcomes (4). To be effec-
tive, the value of financial incentives should be high
enough
to
compensate
for
tobacco
withdrawal
symptoms and for the loss of a valued activity. In
substance abusers, there is a dose-response associa-
tion between the value of incentives and their effects
on abstinence (5). Two studies of large financial in-
centives in smokers showed that in educated and
relatively affluent employees of large U.S. companies,
financial
incentives
of
$750
and
$800
increased
smoking cessation rates, and that an effect on bio-
chemically verified abstinence
was maintained 6
months after the final distribution of incentives (6,7).
Thus, large incentives appear to elicit long-term
smoking abstinence, but it is not clear whether
these findings apply outside workplace or clinical
settings, or to other populations, or whether the ef-
fect extends beyond 6 months after the final distri-
bution of incentives (4,6,7).
Therefore, the objective of this study was to test
whether large financial incentives improved long-
term
smoking
cessation
rates
in
low-income
smokers in a general population setting, without
face-to-face or telephone counseling for smoking
cessation. As there is a risk that the effects of in-
centives may disappear after the incentives end (4),
our study addressed this important point by assessing
outcome
12
months
after
receipt
of
the
final
incentives.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. Participants were 805 smokers
enrolled in Geneva, Switzerland, between August
2011 and May 2013. The financial incentives study was
advertised via the press; on the Internet; in work-
places, hospitals, pharmacies, and medical and dental
clinics; and by email. After answering the baseline
questionnaire
online,
participants
visited
our
research unit, where eligibility was assessed. Inclu-
sion criteria included: $18 years of age; smokes every
day; smokes $5 cigarettes per day; has smoked for $1
year; expired carbon monoxide $10 ppm; saliva
cotinine $10 ng/ml (NicAlert reading $1) (8); sets a
quit date within 1 month and commits to quit at that
date by signing a quitter contract; commits to take
part
in
all
follow-up
procedures;
and
taxable
income #50,000 Swiss francs (CHF) ($55,000, single)
or CHF #100,000 ($110,000, married), proven by the
most recent tax assessment. These income limits
correspond to the least affluent one-third of house-
holds in Geneva (9).
TRIAL DESIGN. This study was a single-center, un-
blinded, 2-arm, parallel group, individually random-
ized controlled superiority trial with follow-up after 3,
6, and 18 months. We compared an intervention group
that received financial incentives plus Internet-based
support to a control group that received Internet-
based support, but no financial incentives. All partic-
ipants signed a paper consent form during the enroll-
ment visit. The study was approved by the ethics
committee of Geneva University Hospitals, and regis-
tered in Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN04019434).
The study protocol was previously published (10)
(Online Appendix).
RANDOMIZATION. Randomization
was
performed
using sealed opaque envelopes drawn by partici-
pants. Neither the researchers nor the participants
could know in advance the content of the envelopes.
We did not use blocks for randomization. Participants
could not be blinded to their assignment group. Re-
searchers were not blinded, but online data collection
at follow-up was computerized. Follow-up data was
collected by postal mail from nonrespondents to the
online surveys, and for nonrespondents to the postal
questionnaires, a minimal set of questions on smok-
ing behavior was asked over the phone.
INTERVENTION. Financial incentives. In the incentive
group, financial rewards of up to CHF 1,500 ($1,650 in
2013) were paid to those participants biochemically
verified as abstinent. All biochemical tests were per-
formed in person at our research unit. As delayed re-
wards are usually discounted, and as reinforcement
works best when the target behavior is followed
without delay by the reinforcer (5,11), self-reported
quitters with negative tests of both expired carbon
monoxide (0 to 3 ppm) and cotinine (<10 ng/ml; i.e.,
NicAlert
¼ 0)
were
declared
confirmed
quitters,
and
received
their
reward
immediately.
Carbon
monoxide
tests
were
performed
with
a
Micro
Smokerlyzer (Bedfont, Maidstone, United Kingdom),
and salivary cotinine was assessed with NicAlert
(Nymox, Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey) test strips,
which can detect cotinine levels >10 ng/ml (8).
Escalating rewards appear to produce better results
than constant rewards (12). Because we wanted to
reward sustained abstinence, rather than initial quit
attempts, we used an escalating scheme and gave
incentives 6 times during 6 months: CHF 100, 150,
200, 300, 350, and 400 at 1, 2, and 3 weeks, and at

 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively ($110, $165, $220, $330,
$385, and $440, respectively). If participants smoked
or missed an assessment, the value of the next
reward was reset to the value of the previous reward
they had received. Incentives were not paid in cash,
but in Migros gift cards, because Migros, a large
supermarket chain, does not sell tobacco or alcohol.
BEHAVIORAL
INTERVENTION
FOR
BOTH
STUDY
GROUPS. Participants in both study groups were
encouraged to use the Stop-tabac.ch smoking cessa-
tion website, which offers fact sheets, discussion
forums, testimonials, and
an
interactive “coach”
that provides automatically
written, personalized
feedback reports (2). This website has proven to be
effective (2). Baseline and follow-up questionnaires
were collected via Stop-tabac.ch; thus, all partici-
pants visited this website repeatedly. During the
enrollment visit, all participants also signed a con-
tract in which they committed to quit on a target quit
date set no later than 1 month after enrollment; this
contract was countersigned by the research assistant
and by the optional social supporter. Participants who
agreed designated a social supporter of their choice
(family or friend), preferably a nonsmoker. The sup-
porters committed to help and support participants
during their quit attempts, and were invited to send
back a consent form to us. Finally, all participants
received self-help smoking cessation booklets (2,13).
Research
assistants
who
had
not
received
any
training in smoking cessation support delivered the
behavioral intervention to both study groups only
during the enrollment visit, before randomization.
The follow-up visits included only biochemical tests
(in both groups) and the distribution of rewards (in
the incentives group). We did not provide in-person
smoking
cessation
counseling,
telephone
coun-
seling, or stop-smoking medications. In Switzerland,
clinical services and medications for smoking cessa-
tion were not available free of charge at the time of
our study. The intervention was implemented as
described in the published protocol (10).
CONTROL GROUP PROCEDURES. After randomiza-
tion, participants in the control group were informed
about their group assignment, and they were con-
tacted again only for the follow-up surveys, and for
biochemical tests in quitters.
ASSESSMENT
OF
OUTCOME
VARIABLES. Existing
data indicate that the relapse rate is usually relatively
small after 6 to 12 months of abstinence (14,15). We
therefore ended the intervention after 6 months and
conducted the final follow-up 12 months after the
final distribution of incentives. Participants auto-
matically received an email message inviting them to
take part in the online follow-up surveys at 3, 6, and
18 months after their target quit date. After 6 email
reminders, nonrespondents received the follow-up
questionnaires by post; after 3 reminders by post,
nonrespondents were contacted by phone (16). Tests
of cotinine in saliva and expired carbon monoxide
were conducted at baseline in all participants to
verify that they were smokers, and at each follow-up
(3, 6, and 18 months) in participants who declared
that they had not smoked even a puff of tobacco in
the previous 7 days. When it was not clear whether
the NicAlert result was 0 or 1, salivary cotinine was
assessed using gas chromatography (performed by
ABS
Laboratories,
Welwyn
Garden
City,
United
Kingdom). In self-reported nonsmokers who reported
use of nicotine medications at follow-up and had a
negative carbon monoxide test (0 to 3 ppm) but a
NicAlert test $1 (that is, cotinine >10 ng/ml) (17,18),
salivary thiocyanate was used to verify smoking
abstinence (cutoff: 100 mg/ml) (19,20). Thiocyanate
tests were performed at the University of Greifswald
(Germany).
Participants
in
both
study
groups
received a Migros gift card of CHF 25 ($27) for
providing saliva and breath samples at follow-up, but
not at baseline, and not when another financial
incentive was given on the same visit.
ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY. The primary outcome
was continuous smoking abstinence between 6 and 18
months, defined as self-report of no puff of tobacco in

 the previous 7 days at 6 months plus self-report of no
smoking
between
the
6-
and
18-month
surveys,
verified by carbon monoxide and either cotinine or
thiocyanate measurements at both time points (6 and
18 months), as described in the preceding text. Sec-
ondary outcomes were self-reports of not smoking
even a puff of tobacco in the previous 7 days and 4
weeks after 3, 6, and 18 months (point prevalence
abstinence), verified by biochemical tests. Carbon
monoxide can verify abstinence in the previous 24 h
and cotinine in the previous week (21). Thus, our
biochemical tests could only verify abstinence during
the 7 days before each assessment (3, 6, and 18
months).
STATISTICS. All
randomized
participants
were
included in the denominator and participants with
missing data at follow-up were counted as smokers.
We used chi-square tests and odds ratios (ORs) with
95%
confidence
intervals
(CIs)
to
compare
pro-
portions of abstinent smokers. The p values were
2-sided, and were not adjusted for multiple compar-
isons. Despite randomization, there was imbalance
between groups for the distributions of sex and pre-
vious attempts to quit smoking (Table 1). Thus, we
used multivariate logistic regression models to adjust
for sex and previous quit attempts. We used logistic
regression models with interaction terms to assess
interactions between the incentives and the personal

 characteristics of participants. We also conducted a
complete case analysis including only participants for
whom we had complete data. On the basis of previous
research (4–6), we determined a priori that a sample
of 800 participants would enable us to detect a dif-
ference between quit rates of 10% in the control
group and 17% in the incentive group (OR: 1.84;
power ¼ 80%; p ¼ 0.05) (10).
PARTICIPANT INVOLVEMENT. Participants were not
involved in the development, design, or conduct of
the study.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS. We enrolled 805 smokers, 401 of
whom were randomly assigned to the incentive group
and 404 to the control group (Figure 1). The mean age
of participants was 32 years, and many were students.
They smoked a mean of 16 cigarettes per day, and
were moderately dependent (mean score of 4.0 on the
Fagerström
Test
for
Nicotine
Dependence)
(22)
(Table 1).
FOLLOW-UP
AND
BIOCHEMICAL
CONFIRMATION. Of
the 805 participants, 743 (92%) were followed up at 3
months, 742 (92%) at 6 months, and 724 (90%) at 18
months. More participants were lost to follow-up in
the control group than in the incentive group at 3, 6,
and 18 months (Figure 1). Among participants who
said they had not smoked in the past 7 days, rates of
biochemical confirmation of abstinence were similar
in the intervention and control groups at 18 months
(63% in both groups; p ¼ 0.99), but confirmation rates
were higher in the incentive group at 3 months (82%
vs. 67%; p ¼ 0.004) and at 6 months (83% vs. 68%;
p ¼ 0.010) (Online Table 1).
USE OF INCENTIVES AND SUPPORT. In the incentive
group, participants received financial rewards of CHF
1,028 on average ($1,130 � 436); 87% of participants
received at least 1 reward and 48% received all 6 re-
wards. At 6 months, more participants in the incen-
tive group than in the control group reported having
obtained help to quit smoking on the Internet over
the past 6 months (20% vs. 14%; p ¼ 0.03), and having
read a smoking cessation booklet (64% vs. 55%;
p ¼ 0.01). Supporters for 8% of participants in the
incentive
group
and
3%
of
the
control
group
(p ¼ 0.005) returned consent forms.
EFFICACY
OF
THE
INCENTIVES. The
primary
outcome (no smoking in the previous 12 months at 18
months plus no smoking in the previous 7 days at 6
months, biochemically verified at both time points)
was 9.48% in the incentive group and 3.71% in the
control group (OR: 2.72; difference 5.76%; 95% CI:
2.35% to 9.17%; p ¼ 0.001). Rates of 7-day and 4-week
smoking abstinence were higher in the incentive
group than in the control group at 3, 6, and 18 months
(Table 2). These effects remained statistically signifi-
cant and of similar size after adjustment for sex and
past quit attempts (Online Table 2). In subgroup an-
alyses, none of the interaction effects was statistically
significant (Table 3). At 6 months, 82% of participants
in the incentive group reported having made a serious
attempt to quit smoking after entering the study,
compared with 63% in the control group (p < 0.001).
RELAPSE AND CESSATION BETWEEN SURVEYS. For
the analysis of relapse and cessation between sur-
veys, we used the criterion of 4-week biochemically
verified abstinence and counted nonrespondents as
smokers. Among those abstinent at 3 months, rates of
relapse to smoking at 6 months were similar in the
incentive (61 of 204, 30%) and control (16 of 39, 41%;
p ¼ 0.17) groups. Among those abstinent at 6 months,
rates of relapse to smoking at 18 months were also
similar (incentive: 108 of 165, 66%; control: 22 of 39,
56%; p ¼ 0.29). Among those smoking at 3 months,
rates of smoking cessation at 6 months were higher in
the incentive group (22 of 197, 11%) than in the control
group (16 of 365, 4%; p ¼ 0.002). Among those
smoking at 6 months, rates of smoking cessation at 18
months were similar in the incentive (9 of 236, 4%)
and control groups (21 of 365, 6%; p ¼ 0.29).

DISCUSSION
A recent Cochrane review concluded that financial
incentives boost smoking cessation only while they
remain in place (4). This may be because many pre-
vious trials gave small financial incentives and did
not assess the long-term effects. The only 2 previous
trials that achieved biochemically verified, sustained
abstinence several months after the final distribution
of incentives were conducted at U.S. work sites in
educated and relatively affluent workers (6,7), in a
context where smoking cessation counseling was
otherwise available free or reimbursed, and used
large
incentives
($750
and
$800).
The
Cochrane
review concluded that this “approach may only be
feasible
where
independently
funded
smoking
cessation programs are already available, and within
a relatively affluent and educated population” (4).
Our study supports the idea that large financial in-
centives produce sustained results, but it differs from
previous reports in that it showed that this effect was
also observed outside workplace or clinical settings,
in a context where personal counseling was not pro-
vided to participants and was not available for free
elsewhere, and that the effect was sustained 12
(rather than 6) months after the final distribution of
incentives, in relatively low-income smokers (Central
Illustration).
The odds ratios and quit rates at final follow-up
were similar in our study (OR: 2.72; between-group
difference in quit rates: 5.76%) and in the 2 previous
studies of financial incentives with biochemically
verified long-term outcomes (OR at final follow-up:
2.48 and 3.28; between-group differences in quit
rates:
4.0%
and
5.8%)
(4,6,7).
The
congruence
between these 3 studies reinforces the idea that large
incentives produce sustained effects, even though
the studies differed. Compared with these 2 previous
trials, our trial was conducted in the general popula-
tion, rather than in workplace settings; we enrolled
low-income smokers only, behavioral counseling was
not provided and was not available free of charge
elsewhere; we assessed outcomes at 12 (rather than 6)
months after the final distribution of incentives; the
value of incentives was twice as high in our trial;
smoking status was biochemically verified at entry in
the study in all participants; we gave incentives 6
instead of 3 times; we incentivized only smoking
abstinence,
and
not
participation
in
a
smoking
cessation program (6); we gave incremental rather
than fixed incentives (7); and our dropout rates were
lower.
The effect observed in our study (a between-group
difference of 5.76 percentage points after 18 months;
number needed to treat: 17.4) is similar to the 12-
month effects of nicotine gum (6% above placebo),
bupropion (5% above placebo), or intensive smoking
cessation
interventions
by
physicians
(5%
above
usual care) (4,23–25). Studies are needed that directly
compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
financial incentives, medications, and medical in-
terventions. In our study, among those smoking at 3
months, rates of smoking cessation at 6 months were
higher in the incentive group than in the control
group, which suggests that the 6-month reward was
useful. Relapse rates between 6 and 18 months were
high, but similar in both study groups (56% and 66%),
which suggests that relapse at 18 months was not due

 to the discontinuation of incentives. In the 2 previous
long-term studies of financial incentives, relapse
rates were also high (36% to 63% after discontinua-
tion of incentives), and these rates were also similar
in the incentive and control groups (6,7). With stop-
smoking medications, such as nicotine replacement
therapy, bupropion, or varenicline, about half of the
smokers abstinent at treatment end also relapse after
a few months (26–28). Further studies should test
how to increase the long-term effects of incentives,
and could reward not only abstinence, but also
participation in face-to-face counseling and use of
nicotine medications, among others (29). Further
studies should also assess whether this intervention
is effective in other groups and places, whether it
has an impact on health outcomes, and its cost
effectiveness.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Our findings may have limited
generalizability because the participants lived in a
relatively small urban area and many were students
(but the outcome was similar in students and non-
students). Compared with a representative sample of
smokers in Geneva, smokers in this study were
younger, more educated, more motivated to quit
smoking (per inclusion criteria), and smoked more
cigarettes
per
day
(30).
Moreover,
although
we
enrolled participants with the lowest third of earnings
in Geneva, this was still a relatively affluent popula-
tion in international comparison. Also, it may not be
feasible to use large financial incentives everywhere.
It is unlikely that many participants started smoking
to enroll in the study, but we cannot exclude the
possibility that some smokers cheated (29,31,32).
However, participants needed to abstain from smok-
ing for a week before the biochemical tests in order to
get negative cotinine values and obtain the rewards,
and the co-occurrence of incentive distribution and
outcome assessment did not occur at 18 months,
when no incentives were
given. It is, however,
possible that participants in the incentives group
learned how to abstain from smoking before assess-
ments during the incentive period, and transferred
this to the latter assessment point. Also, control par-
ticipants were aware that they were not receiving
financial rewards, which may have introduced a
disincentive in this group. Finally, the biochemical
tests themselves, even without counseling, may have

 had some impact, and control participants were sub-
jected to fewer biochemical tests. Incidentally, the
quit rate observed in our control group was within the
range of quit rates reported in reviews of studies of
unaided smokers (33,34).
This study also has several strengths, including the
longer duration of follow-up after receipt of the final
incentives (12 months) and the larger value of in-
centives than in any previous study (4), the large
number of participants, the very high follow-up rates,
the biochemical testing at 18 months, the assurance
that all participants were truly smokers at baseline,
and the general population setting (rather than clin-
ical or workplace settings). Our criteria for biochem-
ical validation were more stringent than in most
previous studies because we used carbon monoxide
and
thiocyanate
in
addition
to
cotinine
for
the
outcome assessment, and cotinine in addition to
carbon monoxide for the incentive distribution (4).
Finally, this intervention can be easily implemented
elsewhere, without medical staff.
CONCLUSIONS
This study showed that large financial incentives
increased rates of continuous smoking abstinence in
relatively low-income smokers, and that an effect was
maintained
12
months
after
receipt
of
the
final
incentive, in a context where personal counseling for
smoking cessation was not provided to participants
and was not available for free elsewhere. The results
were maintained in a complete case analysis.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Swiss Tobacco Prevention
Fund, which funded the study, suggested that the
follow-up should be extended to 12 instead of 6
months after the final incentives were received, but
had no other role in the conduct of the study.
Vincent Baujard, from the Health on the Net
Foundation, developed the software for data collec-
tion. Dr. Harald Below, at the University of Greifswald
(Germany), performed the thiocyanate analyses.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Substantial
financial incentives have a sustained impact on
smoking cessation among relatively low-income
smokers, both inside and outside of workplace or
clinical settings, even when personal counseling is not
provided. The effect is sustained 12 months after the
final distribution of incentives.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to assess the net health care costs and savings
that accrue from programs that offer large financial
incentives for smoking cessation across a wide array of
socioeconomic groups and practice settings.
