Purpose
Although obesity is an established endometrial cancer risk factor, information about the influence
of weight loss on endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women is limited. Therefore, we
evaluated associations among weight change by intentionality with endometrial cancer in the
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) observational study.
Patients and Methods
Postmenopausal women (N = 36,794) ages 50 to 79 years at WHI enrollment had their body weights
measured and body mass indices calculated at baseline and at year 3. Weight change during that
period was categorized as follows: stable (change within 6 5%), loss (change $ 5%), and gain
(change $ 5%). Weight loss intentionality was assessed via self-report at year 3; change was
characterized as intentional or unintentional. During the subsequent 11.4 years (mean) of follow-up,
566 incident endometrial cancer occurrences were confirmed by medical record review. Multi-
variable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate relationships (hazard
ratios [HRs] and 95% CIs) between weight change and endometrial cancer incidence.
Results
In multivariable analyses, compared with women who had stable weight (6 5%), women with
weight loss had a significantly lower endometrial cancer risk (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95). The
association was strongest among obese women with intentional weight loss (HR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.25 to 0.78). Weight gain ($ 10 pounds) was associated with a higher endometrial cancer risk than
was stable weight, especially among women who had never used hormones.
Conclusion
Intentional weight loss in postmenopausal women is associated with a lower endometrial cancer
risk, especially among women with obesity. These findings should motivate programs for weight
loss in obese postmenopausal women.

INTRODUCTION
Endometrial cancer is the most common gyne-
cologic cancer and the fourth most common
cancer among women in the United States.1 Al-
though endometrial cancer is the cancer most
strongly associated with obesity,2 information
about the effects of weight loss in postmenopausal
women on subsequent endometrial cancer in-
cidence is limited. Several observational studies
have associated self-reported weight loss at some
period during adult life with lower endome-
trial cancer risk.3-6 However, these reports have
not focused on weight loss that occurred in
postmenopausal women or on the potential in-
fluence of intentionality of weight loss on risk.
Unintentional weight loss is highly correlated
with increased morbidity and may contribute to
reverse causality.7,8 To our review, the issue of the
influence of intentional weight loss on endome-
trial cancer risk has only been addressed in one
prospective study—the Iowa Women’s Health
Study.3 In that study, women who experienced
a previous episode, anytime during adult life, of
intentional, self-reported weight loss of greater
than 20 pounds and who were not currently
overweight had endometrial cancer risks similar
to those of nonoverweight women who never lost
weight.
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) ob-
servational study, which measured serial weights
with an associated query about weight loss
intentionality, provides a unique opportunity

 to evaluate the association of weight change and endometrial
cancer risk by weight loss intentionality among an ethnically di-
verse population of postmenopausal women.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
WHI
The WHI was designed to address major causes of mor-
bidity and mortality in postmenopausal women9 and included
both a set of clinical trials and an observational study. Details
of design and implementation of the WHI program have been
published elsewhere.10-14 Briefly, 161,808 women ages 50 to 79
years with anticipated survival greater than 3 years were
recruited at 40 clinical centers throughout the United States
between September 1, 1993, and December 31, 1998. Partic-
ipants in the observational study included 93,676 women who
were ineligible or uninterested in participating in the clinical
trials. The study was approved by institutional review boards
at the clinical centers, and participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Information on covariates of interest was collected from
questionnaires administered at baseline. Information on
menopausal hormone therapy use was collected during in-
terviews that included a review of medication containers.
Race/ethnicity was documented by self-report at baseline.
Weight and height were measured by using a standardized
approach at clinic visits, and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated.
The following participants were excluded from the cohort
for this analysis: women who had a history of cancer (except for
non-melanoma skin cancer; n = 10,197) at baseline; women who
were enrolled in the WHI but provided no follow-up information
(n = 422); women who had undergone hysterectomy before en-
rollment (n = 33,317); women who had a missing value of ex-
posures of interest and major confounders (n = 11,081); women
whose BMI was less than 18.5 kg/m2 (underweight; n = 837); and
women who had an endometrial cancer diagnosis, had a hyster-
ectomy, died, or were lost to follow-up between baseline and the
year-3 visit (n = 1,029). After exclusions, 36,793 women remained
for additional analysis.
Follow-Up and Ascertainment of Cases
Follow-up continued through the original specified com-
pletion date of March 31, 2005. Additional follow-up required two
additional written consents, which were obtained in 78% of sur-
viving participants.
All incident endometrial cancer occurrences diagnosed
after the year-3 visit were the primary study outcome. Endo-
metrial cancer occurrences were initially identified by self-
report from questionnaires administered annually, confirmed
by medical record review, and coded centrally at the clinical
coordinating center according to the SEER guidelines. For these
analyses, participants were observed from the year-3 visit to the
first of either an endometrial cancer diagnosis, a date of hys-
terectomy, a date of death, loss to follow-up, or end of current
follow-up (September 30, 2015).
Measurements
Weight change between baseline and year 3 was calculated
from the measured weights and was grouped into three cate-
gories: stable weight, weight loss, or weight gain. The three
categories were defined in two ways: on the basis of an actual
change in body weight (stable weight, or change within 6 10
pounds; weight loss $ 10 pounds from baseline weight; and
weight gain $ 10 pounds from baseline weight) and on the basis
of percentage change in body weight (stable weight, or change
within 6 5%; weight loss $ 5% from baseline; and weight
gain $ 5% from baseline).
In addition, at the year-3 year follow-up, women were asked in
a questionnaire “In the past 2 years, did you gain or lose 5 or more
pounds?” and “Was the change intentional or unintentional?” The
information was used to categorize weight loss as intentional or
unintentional.
Covariates
We adjusted for the following potential confounders mea-
sured at baseline: age (, 55, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74,
and $ 75 years), race/ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska
Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic/Latino, non-
Hispanic white, and other), level of education (high school or
less, some college/technical training, college or some postcollege,
and master’s degree or higher), smoking pack-years (never, , 10,
10 to , 20, 20 to , 30, 30 to , 40, and $ 40), recreational
physical activity (total metabolic equivalent tasks [METs] per
week: , 5, 5 to , 10, 10 to , 20, 20 to , 30, and $ 30), history of
hormone therapy use (none, estrogen alone, estrogen and pro-
gestin, mixed), parity (never pregnant, never had term, 1, 2, 3, 4,
or $ 5), age of menarche (, 12, 12 to 13, 14 to 15, or $ 16 years),
age at first birth (never had term pregnant, , 20, 20 to 29, or $ 30
years), family history of endometrial cancer (yes or no), and BMI.
Detailed information about the categorizations of each variable is
listed in Table 1.

 Statistical Analysis
x2 tests were used to evaluate differences for categoric
covariates. An analysis of variance was used for continuous var-
iables. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to
evaluate the relationship (hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% CIs)
between weight change and incidence of endometrial cancer. We
also performed analyses of relationships between weight change
and endometrial cancer risk stratified by obesity status, hor-
mone use, and age at baseline. In the final multivariate-adjusted
models, potential confounders included these variables listed in
the Covariates section. Because obesity reportedly has a greater
effect on type I endometrial cancer (endometrioid adenocar-
cinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified, or adeno-
carcinoma with squamous differentiation) than on type II endometrial
cancer (serous/papillary serous and mixed-cell adenocarcinoma),15 we
restricted sensitivity analyses to type I tumors. Our primary study
hypothesis was that intentional weight loss would be significantly
associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer. We conducted
another sensitivity analysis to test whether women who intentionally
lost weight and had a lower BMI at 3 years had the same risk of
endometrial cancer as women who had the same lower stable BMI (at
baseline and 3 years) by analyzing the changes of BMI between baseline
and year 3. The change of BMI was categorized as low-stable BMI
(BMI , 25 kg/m2 at baseline and year-3 visit: reference group); weight
gain or stay-high BMI group (BMI , 25 kg/m2 at baseline and BMI
$ 25 kg/m2 at year-3 visit, or BMI $ 25 kg/m2 at baseline and year-3
visit); and weight loss group (BMI $ 25 kg/m2 at baseline and BMI
, 25 kg/m2 at year-3 visit). We then divided the weight loss group intro
intentional and unintentional.
RESULTS
During a mean 11.4 years of follow-up, 566 women developed
endometrial cancer. Baseline characteristics by percentage of weight
change categories from baseline to year 3 (stable weight [change
within 6 5%]), weight loss $ 5%, and weight gain $ 5%) are listed
in Appendix Table A1 (online only). Compared with women who
had stable weight, women who had weight gain were more likely to
be younger, less physically active, black, less educated, and heavier
smokers. They were also more likely to be hormone therapy users,
have a younger age at menarche, have fewer term pregnancies, and
have a younger age at first birth. Compared with women who had
stable weight, women who had intentional weight loss were more
likely to have a higher BMI, be less physically active, be black, be less
educated, and be heavier smokers. They were also more likely to
never have used hormone therapy, to have had a younger age at
menarche, to have had a greater number of term pregnancies, and to
have had a younger age at first birth (all P , .05).
After analyses were adjusted for baseline BMI and other potential
confounders, women who had weight loss $ 5% had a significantly
lower risk of endometrial cancer than women who had stable weight
(HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; Table 1). This was observed for any
weight loss, but the risk was even lower for obese women who had
intentional weight loss (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.78; Table 2).
These results were similar regardless of weight change measured in
pounds or percentage between baseline and year 3. Women with
weight gain $ 10 pounds had a significantly higher risk of endo-
metrial cancer (P = .049). Weight gain measured by percentage
($ 5%) was not associated with an endometrial cancer risk.
Unintentionalweight loss was not associated with a lower risk (Table 1).
We examined the associations between weight change and risk
of endometrial cancer stratified by potential effect modifiers, in-
cluding BMI (normal weight, overweight, and obese), menopausal
hormone therapy use (never, ever estrogen alone users, or ex-
clusively estrogen plus progestin users), and age at baseline (50 to
59, 60 to 69, $ 70 years). We observed a significantly lower risk of
endometrial cancer associated with weight loss among women who
were obese but not in women who were normal weight or over-
weight (Table 2). There was a 48% lower risk seen for obese women
who lost weight intentionally when weight change was measured in
pounds (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.90), and a 56% lower risk
when weight change was measured as a percentage (HR, 0.44; 95%
CI, 0.25 to 0.78). The P value for the interaction test was .07 when
weight change was measured in pounds and was .10 when weight
change was measured as a percentage.

Intentional Weight Loss and Endometrial Cancer
 We observed a higher risk of endometrial cancer associated
with weight gain $ 10 pounds in women without a history of
menopausal hormone use but not in women with a history of
hormone use (Table 3). We also observed a lower risk of endo-
metrial cancer associated with intentional weight loss measured in
pounds or as a percentage in women with a history of estrogen plus
progestin use exclusively but not in women without hormone use
or with estrogen alone use (P for interaction test =.02 when weight
change was measured in pounds; P = .6 when weight change was
measured as a percentage). The association between weight change
and endometrial cancer risk did not differ by age.
In a sensitivity analysis of weight loss and endometrial
cancer subtypes, a stronger association was seen between in-
tentional weight loss and risk of type I endometrial cancer
compared with overall results. For example, compared with
women who had stable weight (6 5%), women who had in-
tentional weight loss had a 52% lower risk of type I endometrial
cancer (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.76) overall; obese women
who had intentional weight loss had a 74% lower risk compared
with obese women with stable weight (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12 to
0.57). The results from the second sensitivity analysis showed
that women who intentionally lost weight and had a normal
BMI at 3 years (ie, , 25 kg/m2) had the same risk of endometrial
cancer as women who maintained a stable normal BMI (Appendix
Table A2, online only).
DISCUSSION
In this large prospective study of postmenopausal women, after
analyses were adjusted for BMI and other potential confounders,
intentional weight loss was associated with a lower risk of en-
dometrial cancer, especially among obese women.
Previous studies3-6 that investigated the association be-
tween endometrial cancer and weight loss have considered
weight change throughout adult life, without a focus on change
during the postmenopausal period, and have been based on
self-reported weights. One case-control study5 and one cohort
study4 have associated self-reported weight loss with lower
endometrial cancer risk. One case-control study6 reported that
women who had intentionally lost weight and maintained that
weight loss were not at a higher endometrial cancer risk than
women who maintained a normal weight throughout. A similar
result was also reported in the Iowa Women’s Health Study.3
To our knowledge, this study is the first to use measured
baseline and follow-up weights with weight loss intentionality
examined over a relatively short period to temporally link mea-
sured weight change in postmenopausal women. In this setting,
modest weight loss was associated with a significantly lower risk of
endometrial cancer. Additionally, although intentional weight loss
was associated with a significantly lower risk of endometrial cancer,
unintentional weight loss was not. These findings suggest that, in
postmenopausal women, it may not be too late for weight loss to
offer potential health benefits.
In our study population, the lower risk of endometrial cancer
associated with weight loss was more pronounced in women who
were obese at baseline. We are not aware of other studies in which
the associations of weight loss and endometrial cancer risk were
stratified by BMI. However, our finding is consistent with reports
that sustained weight loss after bariatric surgery has been as-
sociated with lower endometrial cancer risk in severely obese
women.16-18
Most previous studies that have examined the relationship
between absolute weight gain during adulthood and endo-
metrial cancer risk have reported positive associations.4-6,19-21
We observed a significant positive association between weight
gain $ 10 pounds and endometrial cancer risk in women
without hormone use. In the WHI randomized clinical trial on
hormone therapy, estrogen plus progestin significantly reduced
endometrial cancer incidence.22 In our current analyses, the
lower risk of endometrial cancer associated with weight loss
was more pronounced in women with estrogen plus progestin
use. Somewhat in contrast, in several prior studies, post-
menopausal hormone therapy use substantially attenuated the
association between obesity and higher risk of endometrial
cancer.20,23,24

 Strengths of this study include the large prospective design with
long-term follow-up, centrally adjudicated endometrial cancer oc-
currences, detailed information on potential confounders, mea-
sured baseline and follow-up body weights, and determination of
intentional or unintentional weight loss linked to the period of
measured body weights. However, limitations deserve mention.
Our findings are limited to postmenopausal women and did not
account for weight change beyond 3 years of follow-up. If
a woman lost weight between years 1 and 3 and then regained or
even increased her weight, she was analyzed as a member of the
weight loss group, a misclassification more likely to make our
findings conservative.
In conclusion, intentional weight loss in postmenopausal
women was associated with lower endometrial cancer risk, espe-
cially among women with obesity. These findings should motivate
programs for weight loss in obese postmenopausal women.
