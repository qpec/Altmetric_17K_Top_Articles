Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable pediatric brain tumor, with approxi-
mately 25% of DIPGs harboring activating ACVR1 mutations that commonly co-associate
with H3.1K27M mutations. Here we show that in vitro expression of ACVR1 R206H with and
without H3.1K27M upregulates mesenchymal markers and activates Stat3 signaling. In vivo
expression of ACVR1 R206H or G328V with H3.1K27M and p53 deletion induces glioma-like
lesions but is not sufficient for full gliomagenesis. However, in combination with PDGFA
signaling, ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M significantly decrease survival and increase tumor
incidence. Treatment of ACVR1 R206H mutant DIPGs with exogenous Noggin or the ACVR1
inhibitor LDN212854 significantly prolongs survival, with human ACVR1 mutant DIPG cell
lines also being sensitive to LDN212854 treatment. Together, our results demonstrate that
ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M promote tumor initiation, accelerate gliomagenesis, promote a
mesenchymal profile partly due to Stat3 activation, and identify LDN212854 as a promising
compound to treat DIPG.

iffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) originates in the
pons and comprises approximately 20% of all pediatric
brain tumors1,2. DIPG remains incurable with a median
survival of 10–11 months3. Failure to identify a successful therapy
for DIPG likely stems from the lack of biological understanding
of the disease, as until recently biopsies were not commonly
performed due to the sensitive location of the tumor. As a result,
many trials have been based upon genetic alterations found in
adult glioblastomas. Recent studies have shown that DIPG is
molecularly
distinct
from
adult
gliomas.
High-throughput
sequencing unraveled mutations in genes encoding histone var-
iants H3.3 and H3.1 (H3F3A, HIST1H3B, and HIST1H3C) in
~80% of all DIPG patients4–7, resulting in the substitution of a
lysine to a methionine at position 27 (K27M), and leading to
abnormal Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) function. As a
result, H3K27 methylation is reduced globally but focally
gained8–11. H3K27M mutations are found primarily in midline
high-grade gliomas and rarely occur in pediatric high-grade
gliomas located in the cerebral cortex or in adult high-grade
gliomas12.
Since the finding of H3.3 and H3.1K27M mutations in DIPG,
we and others have discovered that ~25% of DIPG patients
harbor activating ACVR1 mutations, a gene that encodes for the
ALK2, a receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling pathway6,13–15. ACVR1 mutations were found to acti-
vate the BMP signaling pathway independent of receptor ligation
and commonly segregate with H3.1K27M mutations. Surpris-
ingly, ACVR1 mutations found in DIPG were nearly identical to
those found in the connective tissue disease fibrodysplasia ossi-
ficans progressiva (FOP), an autosomal dominant disease in
which progenitor populations within muscles, tendons, and
ligaments undergo heterotopic ossification or ectopic bone
formation16,17. Interestingly, FOP patients do not develop DIPG,
suggesting that ACVR1 mutations alone are not sufficient to drive
gliomagenesis.
However, the mechanism underlying the effect of ACVR1 and
H3.1K27M mutations on gliomagenesis in the context of DIPG
remains to be determined. To date no one has shown whether
ACVR1 mutations, either individually or in combination with
H3.1K27M mutations, are oncogenic drivers and can lead to
gliomagenesis. In this study, we use the RCAS/tv-a system to
study the effects of these mutations in vitro and in vivo. We
observe that ACVR1 mutations have differential effects on pro-
liferation and survival in vitro with ACVR1 R206H being the
most potent. RNAseq analysis of nestin-expressing brainstem
progenitors infected with ACVR1 R206H demonstrates that
ACVR1 R206H upregulates the expression of mesenchymal
markers and activates Stat3 signaling relative to ACVR1 WT with
and without H3.1K27M. While ACVR1 mutations can lead to the
formation of glioma-like lesions, with H3.1K27M and p53 loss
being required for this process, such genetic alterations are not
sufficient to drive tumor development. Rather, PDGFA signaling
is required for full gliomagenesis, and in the presence of PDGFA
signaling and p53 loss, both ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M
accelerate
gliomagenesis.
Additionally,
the
combination
of
ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M increases tumor incidence, sug-
gesting that these mutations play a role in tumor initiation. Lastly,
we identify the BMP signaling pathway as a potential effective
therapeutic strategy to treat ACVR1 R206H mutant DIPGs as
exogenous Noggin expression at tumor initiation or treatment
with LDN212854 significantly increases tumor latency and pro-
longs survival. We validate our observations in human models by
demonstrating that human ACVR1 mutant DIPG cell-lines are
sensitive to treatment with LDN212854 in vitro and that human
tumors with ACVR1 mutations harbor increased Stat3 signaling.
In conclusion, this study highlights the role of mutant ACVR1
and H3.1K27M in tumor initiation and identifies the BMP
pathway, particularly LDN212854, as a promising therapeutic
agent for further evaluation in ACVR1 mutant DIPG.
Results
ACVR1 mutations affect proliferation and survival. Previously
we have examined ACVR1 mutations in vitro using the RCAS/tv-
a system with brainstem progenitor cells cultured as adherent cell
lines6. To study the effects of ACVR1 mutations on stem-like
progenitors, cells were isolated from the brainstem of postnatal
day 3 (p3) Nestin-Tv-a (Ntv-a);p53fl/fl mice, cultured as neuro-
spheres, and infected with RCAS-ACVR1 WT, R206H, G328V, or
G328E virus. Infection with ACVR1 R206H virus significantly
increased proliferation relative to ACVR1 G328V and ACVR1
G328E (Fig. 1a) and cell survival relative to ACVR1 WT and
ACVR1 G328E (Fig. 1b). To determine BMP signaling pathway
activation, protein levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 and Id1,
a downstream target of BMP signaling, were assessed. Infection
with all ACVR1 mutations led to increased phosphorylated
SMAD1/5/8 expression as compared to ACVR1 WT, with ACVR1
G328E increasing pSMAD1/5/8 modestly but significantly relative
to ACVR1 WT (Fig. 1c). Id1 levels were also significantly up-
regulated by infection with ACVR1 mutations relative to ACVR1
WT with ACVR1 G328V increasing Id1 protein levels the most
(Fig. 1d). In summary, all three ACVR1 mutations increase the
activation of the BMP pathway with ACVR1 R206H having the
most effect on proliferation and survival.
Since
ACVR1
mutations
commonly
co-segregate
with
H3.1K27M mutations, we hypothesized that the two mutations
would have an additive effect on these results. Surprisingly,
neither proliferation nor cell survival levels were significantly
increased when neurospheres were infected with ACVR1 and
H3.1K27M mutations as compared to neurospheres infected with
ACVR1 mutations alone (Supplementary Figure 1). SMAD1/5/8
phosphorylation and Id1 protein levels increased slightly with the
addition of H3.1K27M but were not significant (Supplementary
Figure 1). To determine how ACVR1 mutations were behaving
individually and in combination with H3.1K27M mutations,
RNASeq analysis was performed on neurospheres that were
infected with ACVR1 R206H or ACVR1 WT, both in the presence
and absence of H3.1K27M (Fig. 1e). Surprisingly, only 24 genes
were significantly differentially expressed by ACVR1 R206H
relative to ACVR1 WT without H3.1K27M while 2478 genes were
significantly differentially expressed by ACVR1 R206H relative to
ACVR1 WT in the presence of H3.1K27M (p adjusted < 0.05). As
an example, all 4 ID genes were significantly upregulated by
ACVR1 R206H in the presence of H3.1K27M while only ID1 was
significantly upregulated by ACVR1 R206H in the absence of
H3.1K27M (Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, GSEA analysis
showed a significant enrichment of genes involved in epithelial to
mesenchymal
transition
(EMT)
as
well
as
the
IL-6/JAK/
STAT3 signaling pathway both with and without H3.1K27M
(Fig. 1f, g, Supplementary Figure 1, and Supplementary Data 2),
suggesting that ACVR1 R206H is primarily promoting these
signatures and that H3.1K27M enhances them. These results were
confirmed with ACVR1 R206H having increased expression of
Id1 and Socs3, a STAT3 target gene and one of the 24 significantly
differentially upregulated genes, as compared to ACVR1 WT
alone
(Supplementary
Figure
1).
Furthermore,
increased
mesenchymal gene expression of CD44, tenascin C (TNC), and
Snail2 and downregulation of proneural genes such as Sox10, was
observed, suggesting that ACVR1 mutations might contribute to a
mesenchymal phenotype in the presence of the mutant histone
(Fig. 1h). In light of these results and as STAT3 signaling has been
shown to regulate mesenchymal genes in brain tumors18, we

 examined whether STAT3 signaling was activated by ACVR1
mutations at the protein level. Indeed, cells that were infected
with ACVR1 mutations
had
modestly
increased
levels of
phosphorylated STAT3 Y705 as compared to ACVR1 WT
infected cells, with ACVR1 R206H demonstrating significantly
increased levels (Fig. 1i). However, infection with ACVR1
mutations and H3.1K27M did not significantly increase phos-
phorylated STAT3 Y705 expression compared to infection with
ACVR1 mutations alone (Supplementary Figure 1). Together,
these results indicate that one way ACVR1 mutations contribute
to DIPG pathogenesis is by promoting a mesenchymal profile
which may be due in part to increased STAT3 signaling while

Formation of glioma-like lesions in mice. To date, most studies
examining the effects of ACVR1 mutations have been performed
in vitro while one study has shown that the expression of ACVR1
mutants in p53 deficient astrocytes failed to induce tumor for-
mation in vivo15. To determine whether ACVR1 mutations could
lead to tumorigenesis, nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors of
neonatal Ntv-a;p53fl/fl mice were infected with either FLAG-
epitope tagged ACVR1 WT, R206H, G328V, or G328E and
assessed for tumor formation. These mice did not develop
tumors, regardless of which ACVR1 mutation was expressed
(Supplementary Table 1). However, when ACVR1 R206H,
G328V, or G328E was co-injected along with HA-epitope and
FLAG-epitope tagged H3.1K27M and Cre to induce p53 loss,
mice
were
able
to
generate
glioma-like
lesions
in
vivo
(4/10 = 40%, 4/13 = 31%, and 1/8 = 13%) (Fig. 2 and Supple-
mentary Table 1). Additionally, while p53 loss was not sufficient
to drive lesion formation (Supplementary Table 1), H3.1K27M
and p53 loss together were sufficient for lesion formation (1/7 =
14%). Together, these results indicate that both H3.1K27M and
p53 are required for glioma-like lesion formation.
Multiple virus combinations were tested in an effort to generate
tumors with ACVR1 mutations (Supplementary Table 1). How-
ever, in spite of our best efforts, tumors did not develop. As
ACVR1 mutations increase BMP signaling in vitro, we hypothe-
sized that increased BMP signaling through the addition of
exogenous BMP4 ligand or Activin-A, a recently identified ligand
for ACVR1 R206H in FOP19, could lead to gliomagenesis. While
exogenous BMP4 led to lesion formation in the context of ACVR1
R206H, H3.1K27M, and p53 loss (3/6 = 50%), no tumors
developed (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Similarly,
gliomagenesis did not occur with the addition of Activin A and
surprisingly nor did lesion formation. Similarly, exogenous

 expression of Stat3 inhibited the development of these glioma-like
lesions as well. Additionally, ACVR1 mutations have been
associated with activating mutations in the PI3K pathway in
human
DIPGs,
including
inactivating
pten
mutations
or
deletions6,14. Therefore, we sought to determine whether loss of
PTEN could cooperate with ACVR1 mutations, H3.1K27M, and
p53 loss in Ntv-a;p53fl/fl;PTENfl/fl mice to form tumors. While the
addition of PTEN loss led to the development of glioma-like
lesions (6/10 = 60% for ACVR1 R206H and 6/15 = 40% for
ACVR1 G328V), gliomagenesis did not occur (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table 1). Immunohistochemistry staining of the
glioma-like lesions demonstrated that cells within the lesions were
proliferating and that a subset of cells expressed H3.1K27M and
the mutant ACVR1 (Fig. 2).
Glioma-like lesions express a mesenchymal immunophenotype.
To further characterize the glioma-like lesions, all groups except
ACVR1 G328V, H3.1K27M, and Cre (because they were too
small) were stained for Nestin, Olig2, and GFAP as these markers
have been expressed in at least a subset of human DIPGs20
(Fig. 3). While most cells within the lesions expressed Nestin,
Olig2 staining was minimal. This absence of Olig2 staining sug-
gested that these glioma-like lesions were not DIPGs as Olig2 is a
robust marker of DIPG tumor cells20,21. However, expression
profiling of DIPG biopsies has revealed that DIPGs with
H3.1K27M and ACVR1 mutations exhibit more of a mesenchy-
mal phenotype with a pro-angiogenic signature21,22. In light of
these observations and in combination with our RNASeq results,
we then sought to determine whether the glioma-like lesions fit
into the latter group. Lesions subsequently stained for endothelial
marker CD31 and mesenchymal marker CD44 were found to
express both (Fig. 3). It should be noted that although immu-
nostaining of human DIPGs for CD44 has not been reported,
CD44 mRNA has been reported to be expressed in a subset of
human DIPGs by two independent groups, one of which noted
that CD44 is expressed in DIPG associated microglia22,23. To
further explore a possible mesenchymal phenotype and link to
STAT3 signaling identified in our in vitro experiments18, we
immunostained for pSTAT3 and found it to be expressed

 throughout the lesions as well (Fig. 3). However, due to the small
size of the lesions we were unable to perform double immuno-
fluorescence to determine if the cells expressing H3.1K27M and
mutant
ACVR1
are
also
expressing
pSTAT3.
Additional
mesenchymal markers vimentin and Iba1, which have been
previously reported to stain human DIPGs23,24, were also both
expressed. Collectively, this data suggests that the glioma-like
lesions display more of a mesenchymal phenotype rather than an
oligodendroglial phenotype and is consistent with our observa-
tions in vitro.
ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M reduce survival. Because
ACVR1 mutations, even in combination with multiple additional
mutations, were not sufficient to generate DIPGs in vivo, we
incorporated the PDGFA ligand into our model as PDGFRA
signaling is known to cooperate with H3.3K27M and p53 loss in
other model systems25,26 and as some human DIPGs with
ACVR1 mutations also had PDGFRA amplifications6,15. Mice
infected with ACVR1 R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA had a
median survival of approximately 70 days (Fig. 4a). This was

(Fig.

Table

To
determine
whether
H3.1K27M is unique in its ability to cooperate with ACVR1
R206H, we replaced H3.1K27M with H3.3K27M. Interestingly,
there was no significant difference in survival between mice that
were injected with ACVR1 R206H, H3.3K27M, Cre, and PDGFA
(median survival 101 days) and mice that were injected with
ACVR1 R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA, suggesting that
H3.3K27M can substitute for H3.1K27M in this context.
To determine whether ACVR1 R206H or H3.1K27M was most
responsible for the decrease in survival, mice were infected with
either ACVR1 R206H or H3.1K27M along with Cre and PDGFA.
Those that were infected with ACVR1 R206H had significantly
decreased survival (median survival 86 days) as compared to
those
that
were
infected
with
RCAS-Y
(median
survival
164.5 days, **p = 0.0058, log-rank test) (Fig. 4b, Table 1), while
those infected with H3.1K27M (median survival 157 days) had a
similar median survival to the RCAS-Y group (p = 0.9360, log-
rank test). This suggests that ACVR1 R206H can accelerate
gliomagenesis in the absence of H3.1K27M but not vice versa
(Fig. 4a, b). Furthermore, neurospheres were derived from
ACVR1 R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA primary tumors
and injected into Ntv-a; p53fl/fl mice. Not only did secondary
tumors develop, but gliomagenesis was also greatly accelerated
(Supplementary Figure 2).
While examining the effect of ACVR1 mutations on survival,
we noted that mice not infected with ACVR1 R206H were more
likely to survive to the end of the study and remain asymptomatic
as compared to mice that were infected with ACVR1 R206H.
Therefore, we hypothesized that ACVR1 R206H might have an
effect on tumor incidence. In fact, mice that were infected with
Fig. 4 ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M significantly decrease survival and increase tumor incidence. a–h All mice were injected with RCAS-PDGFA and RCAS-
Cre along with additional RCAS viruses as indicated. a Kaplan–Meier survival curve of Nestin tv-a; p53fl/fl mice that were injected with RCAS-ACVR1

 ACVR1 R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA had increased
tumor incidence (28/31 = 90%) as compared to control mice that
were infected with ACVR1 WT, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA
(10/17 = 59%, *p = 0.0220, Fisher’s exact test) or ACVR1 WT,
H3.1 WT, Cre, and PDGFA (15/26 = 58%, **p = 0.0059, Fisher’s
exact test) (Fig. 4c and Table 2). Surprisingly, mice that were
infected with ACVR1 R206H, Cre, and PDGFA but not
H3.1K27M or ACVR1 R206H, H3.1 WT, Cre, and PDGFA did
not demonstrate an increase in tumor incidence (21/26 = 81%
and 11/25 = 44%, respectively) compared to any group except
each other (Fig. 4d and Table 2), suggesting that H3.1K27M is
required for the effect of ACVR1 R206H on tumor initiation and
is in agreement with our observations with the glioma-like lesions
without PDGFA. Furthermore, H3.3K27M can substitute for
H3.1K27M mutation and cooperate with ACVR1 R206H in
tumor initiation as mice that were infected with ACVR1 R206H,
H3.3K27M, Cre, and PDGFA also had a high tumor incidence
(20/22 = 91%) similar to ACVR1 R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and
PDGFA.
In light of this new information, survival curves were
reanalyzed so that only tumor-bearing mice were examined in
order to understand the effect of ACVR1 mutations on survival
more clearly (Fig. 4e, f and Table 3). Interestingly, ACVR1
R206H; H3.1K27M; Cre; PDGFA tumor-bearing mice (median
survival 71 days) had significantly decreased survival relative to
only RCAS Y; Cre; PDGFA tumor-bearing mice (median survival
115 days *p = 0.0397, log-rank test) or H3.1K27M; Cre; PDGFA
tumor-bearing mice (median survival 129.5 days *p = 0.0128, log-
rank test). This effect appears to be driven by ACVR1 R206H as
ACVR1 R206H; Cre; PDGFA tumor-bearing mice had decreased
survival compared to H3.1K27M; Cre; PDGFA tumor-bearing
mice (*p = 0.0417, log-rank test). Additionally, tumor grade was
also examined by a blinded neuropathologist. Interestingly, the
only significant difference in tumor grade among the different
tumor cohorts was a subset of the comparisons with ACVR1
R206H; H3.3K27M; PDGF-A; p53 loss tumors. As they were
100% high-grade, tumor grade was significantly higher in this
cohort relative to several other cohorts such as ACVR1 WT and
H3.1 WT (Fig. 4g, h and Table 4). Collectively these results
suggest that together, ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M, signifi-
cantly decrease survival and increase tumor incidence, suggesting
a cooperating role for both mutations in tumor initiation.
ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M upregulate BMP signaling and
CD31. To characterize the effect of ACVR1 R206H in vivo,
immunohistochemistry staining was performed examining BMP
pathway upregulation and angiogenesis as Id genes are known to
regulate angiogenesis27. Mice that were infected with ACVR1
R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA had increased staining for
Id1 and Hes1, a component of the Notch pathway and also a
target of the BMP signaling pathway28. It should be noted that
while IHC for Hes1 has yet to be performed in human DIPGs,
Hes1 has been reported to be expressed at both the mRNA and
protein of levels of human DIPGs29. Together, these results
indicated that BMP signaling was upregulated and also appeared
to be driven by ACVR1 R206H (Fig. 5a). These tumors also
demonstrated increased CD31 expression (Fig. 5a), suggesting a
possible role for ACVR1 R206H in promoting angiogenesis.
Staining for Nestin, Olig2, and GFAP revealed no significant
differences among the different genotypes (Supplementary Fig-
ure 3). Western blot analysis of tumor lysates demonstrated
similar results as those observed by IHC staining, with ACVR1
R206H, H3.1K27M; PDGF-A; p53 deficient mutant tumors
having significantly higher protein levels of Id1, Hes1, and CD31
than other tumor types, with ACVR1 R206H contributing most to
these higher levels (Fig. 5b–d). Phosphorylated STAT3 Y705
expression was also analyzed as ACVR1 R206H upregulated these
levels in vitro. While not statistically, ACVR1 R206H, Cre, and
PDGFA
tumors
lysates
showed
increased
phosphorylated
pSTAT3 levels as compared to RCAS Y, Cre, and PDGFA tumor
lysates (Fig. 5e). Together, these results provide additional evi-
dence that ACVR1 R206H promotes a mesenchymal signature in
the presence of H3.1K27M.
LDN212854 decreases proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To
validate our model and determine whether increased phos-
phorylated STAT3 Y705 levels are also observed in the human
disease, human ACVR1 mutant lysates were analyzed for phos-
phorylated STAT3 levels. Indeed, ACVR1 mutant tumor tissue
had significantly increased phosphorylated STAT3 Y705 levels as
compared to their normal brain tissue counterparts (Fig. 6a). As
both BMP and STAT3 signaling pathways appeared to be possible
therapeutic targets for treating ACVR1 mutant DIPGs, mice were
infected with ACVR1 R206H, Cre, PDGFA, and Noggin, an
extracellular inhibitor of the BMP pathway, or STAT3 DN
(Y705F) to inhibit the STAT3 pathway and assessed for survival
benefit. Results showed that mice that were infected with Noggin
had increased survival (median survival 132 days) as compared to
mice infected with RCAS Y (median survival 83.5 days, *p =
0.0271, log-rank test). Mice that were infected with STAT3 DN
showed no significant increase in survival (Fig. 6b). BMP and
STAT3 signaling pathway inhibition was confirmed as Id1 and
phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 protein levels were decreased in
mice injected with Noggin and phosphorylated STAT3 levels
were decreased in mice injected with STAT3 DN (Fig. 6c).
Interestingly, mice that were infected with STAT3 DN also had
significantly decreased TNC and Vimentin levels as compared to
mice infected with RCAS Y (Fig. 6d), demonstrating that
mesenchymal gene upregulation by ACVR1 R206H is partly
regulated by STAT3 signaling. Additionally, no significant
decrease in tumor incidence or tumor grade was seen in STAT3
DN infected mice (Supplementary Figure 4). These results suggest
that inhibition of the BMP pathway would be the more beneficial

 therapeutic strategy than targeting the STAT3 pathway for
ACVR1 mutant DIPGs.
Currently, no pharmaceutical agents exist that specifically
target ACVR1 R206H. Therefore, to determine whether ACVR1
R206H could be used as a therapeutic target, neurospheres
derived from ACVR1 R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA
primary tumors were incubated with LDN212854, an ACVR1
inhibitor that binds ALK-2 more potently than other ALK
receptors30. LDN212854 treatment led to decreased proliferation
(Fig. 6e) and cell survival (Supplementary Figure 4) in all cell
lines. However, it should be noted that LDN212854 had the same
effect on neurospheres derived from primary tumors in mice not
infected with ACVR1 R206H (Supplementary Figure 4). Id1
expression was also decreased in LDN212854 treated neuro-
spheres, indicating that LDN212854 was inhibiting the BMP
pathway (Fig. 6f). To confirm our mouse studies, ACVR1 mutant
and wildtype human cell lines were treated with LDN212854.

 H3.1K27M) and DIPG007 (ACVR1 R206H; H3.3K27M) were
more sensitive to LDN212854 treatment and had decreased
proliferation at lower drug concentrations compared to ACVR1
wildtype line SF8628 (Fig. 6g). All LDN212854 treated human
lines showed significantly decreased phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8
and Id1 protein levels (Fig. 6h and Supplementary Figure 4),
indicating inhibition of the BMP pathway. Mouse neurospheres
and human cell lines were also treated with a second ACVR1
inhibitor LDN214117, an inhibitor that is also a potent inhibitor
of ALK231. In mouse neurosphere lines, while treatment with
LDN214117 did appear to inhibit the BMP pathway as evident by
decreased Id1 expression, proliferation and cell viability levels
were not significantly affected (Supplementary Figure 4). Similar
results were also observed in LDN214117 treated human cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 4). Together, these results suggest that
inhibition of the BMP pathway may not be sufficient for a
significant anti-tumor effect and that observed anti-tumor effects
of LDN212854 may be mediated by off-target effects. Further
studies will need to be done to confirm this.
However, because in vitro treatment with LDN212854 with
mouse and human cell lines proved encouraging, we then sought
to determine the efficacy of LDN212854 in vivo using ACVR1
R206H, H3.1K27M, Cre, and PDGFA infected mice. Pharmaco-
kinetics studies revealed that LDN212854 had good brain
penetration and that LDN212854 treated mice had decreased
Id1 expression and proliferation as compared to vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 6i–k). Survival studies of mice recipient of LDN212854
demonstrated a 2.1× increased survival with a median survival of
15 days compared to vehicle-treated mice with a median survival
of 7 days after the beginning of treatment (Fig. 6l) (*p = 0.0244,
log-rank test). Together, these results show that treatment with
LDN212854 may be a worthwhile strategy to evaluate in a clinical
trial for treating ACVR1 mutant DIPG.
Discussion
The role of BMP signaling in gliomagenesis is complex. Previous
studies support the idea of BMP signaling as a tumor suppressor
pathway in gliomas as it has been shown to block the proliferation
of neural stem cells and glioma-initiating cells32. In contrast, it
has also been shown that BMP signaling can also be tumor
promoting in certain contexts33,34. Herein we study the effects of
mutations in ACVR1, a serine threonine type I receptor in the
BMP pathway, on DIPG biology. ACVR1 has been implicated in
oligodendroglial differentiation, but its role in the development of
the pons is not clear28. To date, most identified ACVR1 mutations
have been restricted to DIPGs with the exception of one reported
case of a pediatric glioblastoma that arose in the spinal cord and
harbored a G328E mutation35.
To study the role of ACVR1 in DIPG pathogenesis, brainstem
progenitors were infected with three common ACVR1 mutants:
R206H, G328V, and G328E which resulted in differential effects
on proliferation and cell survival with ACVR1 R206H being the
most potent mutation, ACVR1 G328V being intermediate, and
ACVR1 G328E being the least potent. Surprisingly, the level of
BMP pathway activation by the different ACVR1 mutations in
brainstem progenitors in vitro did not directly correlate with their
effects on proliferation and cell survival nor did we observe an
additive effect in combination with H3.1K27M. As ACVR1
R206H had the largest effect on proliferation and cell survival
in vitro, we performed RNAseq on brainstem progenitors infected
with ACVR1 R206H or ACVR1 WT to identify target genes of this
mutation. We observed significantly more differentially expressed
genes between ACVR1 R206H and ACVR1 WT in the presence of
H3.1K27M than without and noted that expression of ACVR1
R206H in nestin-expressing brainstem progenitors upregulated
genes that have been previously implicated in the mesenchymal
subtype of glioma, namely CD44, Snail2, and Tenascin C22,36,37.
Furthermore, GSEA analysis demonstrated that Stat3 signaling
and EMT are positively enriched in the ACVR1 R206H infected
cells in comparison to ACVR1 WT infected cells both with and
without H3.1K27M. In support of the GSEA analysis, western
blot analysis confirmed that brainstem progenitors infected with
ACVR1 R206H have significantly higher levels of Stat3 phos-
phorylation than ACVR1 WT. As Stat3 signaling has been pre-
viously implicated in the mesenchymal transformation of adult
glioblastomas,
we
hypothesized
that
the
upregulation
of
mesenchymal markers by ACVR1 R206H in the presence of
H3.1K27M
is
at least
in
part due
to the activation
of
Stat3 signaling. We provide some evidence in support of this by
demonstrating that exogenous expression of a Stat3 dominant
negative (Y705F) during tumor initiation with ACVR1 R206H;
PDGF-A; and p53 loss results in downregulation of two
mesenchymal genes that were upregulated by ACVR1 R206H
in vitro, namely vimentin and tenascin C.
Through the development of our DIPG genetic model that
incorporated ACVR1 mutations, it noted that three of the most
common ACVR1 mutants (ACVR1 R206H, ACVR1 G328V, and
ACVR1 G328E) were not sufficient to induce DIPGs, even in
combination with H3.1K27M, p53 loss, and PTEN loss. We did
observe the formation of glioma-like lesions in a subset of these
mice at 6 months post infection. Through these experiments, we
discovered that the glioma-like lesions induced by mutant
ACVR1, H3.1K27M, and p53 loss express a mesenchymal

 phenotype based on the expression of CD44, CD31, pSTAT3,
Iba1, vimentin, and minimal Olig2 expression. The original
description of the mesenchymal glioma subtype in adult gliomas
noted that mesenchymal gliomas harbor an astrocytic histology,
which is consistent with our observations that a pathway that
promotes astrocytic differentiation such as the BMP pathway can
promote gliomagenesis of the mesenchymal subtype38,39. In
addition,
our
observation
of
significantly
increased
CD31
immunostaining with the addition of ACVR1 R206H to the
PDGF-A; p53 loss driven glioma model is also consistent with the
mesenchymal subtype that is characterized by increased angio-
genesis. Of note, an angiogenesis gene profile was also sig-
nificantly enriched in the GSEA analysis of nestin-expressing
brainstem progenitors infected with ACVR1 R206H relative to
ACVR1 WT in the presence of H3.1K27M. Thus, our findings
add ACVR1 to NF1 deletion as an additional genetic alteration
found in human gliomas that promote mesenchymal transfor-
mation40–43.
As mutant ACVR1, H3.1K27M, and p53 loss were not suffi-
cient to induce murine DIPGs, PDGF-A was added to the model
as PDGFRA amplifications are occasionally seen in human
DIPGs that harbor ACVR1 mutations6,15. While the significance
of the requirement for PDGF-A to develop ACVR1 mutant
DIPGs with this modeling approach is unclear, PDGF-A has
recently been reported to be expressed in at least a subset of DIPG
tumor cells in at least 3 out of 4 different assays (cultured DIPG
RNAseq, primary bulk DIPG RNAseq, primary single cell DIPG
RNAseq)23. It is possible that tumor initiation in utero with these
genetic alterations or in a different cell-of-origin postnatally may
obviate the requirement for PDGF-A ligand (or other similar
genetic alteration such as mutant PDGFRA). Nonetheless,
ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M accelerated gliomagenesis and
increased tumor incidence in the presence of PDGFA and p53
loss. Surprisingly, when we evaluated the effect of ACVR1 R206H
and H3.1K27M separately from each other, ACVR1 R206H
accelerated gliomagenesis without H3.1K27M while H3.1K27M
was able to accelerate gliomagenesis only in the presence of
ACVR1 R206H. These observations support our conclusions that
the two genetic alterations cooperate in DIPG pathogenesis, and
hence their strong association in the human tumors.
To determine whether targeting the BMP pathway is therapeutic
in ACVR1 mutant DIPGs, we sought to inhibit BMP signaling by
expressing exogenous Noggin, an extracellular antagonist of the
BMP pathway, along with ACVR1 R206H, PDGFA, and p53 loss at
tumor initiation. Noggin significantly inhibited the BMP pathway
in vivo and successfully delayed gliomagenesis, suggesting that
targeting the BMP pathway may be therapeutic. As our in vitro
studies unraveled that Stat3 signaling is activated by ACVR1
R206H, we likewise expressed a dominant negative Stat3 instead of
Noggin and observed that dominant negative Stat3 is not successful
in significantly delaying gliomagenesis. Therefore, we proceeded to
evaluate the anti-tumor effects of two ALK2 inhibitors that have
been developed for FOP. LDN212854, was significantly more effi-
cacious than LDN214117 in vitro, in both cell-lines derived from
our murine model and human DIPG cell-lines. The reason for this
is
unclear
and
requires
further
investigation.
Interestingly,
LDN212854 has been demonstrated to significantly inhibit het-
erotopic ossification in multiple mouse model of FOP17,30. We
noted that LDN212854 inhibited glioma neurosphere lines at a
similar IC50s independent of expression of the ACVR1 R206H
mutation. LDN214117 treatment did not reach an IC50 in the
murine cell-lines nor in the human cell-lines even at a dose whereby
Id1 levels were significantly inhibited. Together, these observations
suggest that the efficacy of LDN212854 may be partly through an
ALK2 independent mechanism and inhibition of ALK2 alone may
not be sufficient for robust antitumor effect.
In conclusion, as BMP ligands are currently being used in
clinical trials to treat high-grade gliomas in adults (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier NCT02869243)44, it is important to understand
how BMP signaling is contributing to gliomagenesis in certain
contexts and inhibiting gliomagenesis in others. This may be a
region-specific effect as ACVR1 mutations have only been
observed thus far in the pons and spinal cord (i.e., midline
gliomas). Our observations suggest that ACVR1 mutations have
differing effects on proliferation and cell survival in vitro and
ACVR1 mutations promote mesenchymal transformation in part
by activating Stat3 signaling. Our genetic experiment with Noggin
as well as evaluation of LDN212854 in mouse and human models
suggest that inhibiting BMP signaling may be a successful ther-
apeutic strategy in DIPGs that harbor ACVR1 mutations.
Methods
Mice. Nestin-Tv-a (Ntv-a);p53fl/fl mice were generated by crossing Ntv-a mice with
p53fl/fl mice45. Ntv-a;p53fl/fl;PTENfl/fl mice were generated by crossing Ntv-a;p53fl/fl
mice with PTENfl/fl mice. We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations for
animal testing and research. All animals were used according to protocols approved at
Duke University and Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee and
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Animal Protocol A214-13-8
at Duke University and IS00005105 at Northwestern University).
Infection of brainstem neurospheres with RCAS viruses. Brainstem tissue was
isolated from Ntv-a;p53fl/fl pups at postnatal day 3 (p3) and dissociated with
papain and ovomucoid46. Cells were then cultured under neurosphere conditions
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% pro-
liferation supplement (Stem Cell Technologies), 1% Pen–Strep (Invitrogen),
20 ng/mL human basic FGF (Invitrogen), 10 ng/mL human EGF (Invitrogen), and
2 μg/mL heparin (Stem Cell Technologies) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
Concentration of RCAS viruses was performed per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Clontech). Subsequently, neurospheres were then seeded in 96-well plates and
infected with virus. Proliferation and cell survival assays were performed 3 days
post infection with virus. Proliferation was measured by a bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU)-based cell proliferation ELISA assay kit (Roche) per the manufacturer’s
instructions and read on a Molecular Devices Versa Max tunable microplate. Cell
viability was assessed through the use of a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent cell viability
assay per the manufacturer’s instructions and read on Turner Biosystems Modulus
Microplate luminometer. All experiments were performed in triplicate wells.
Western blot analysis. Virus infected p3 brainstem progenitor neurospheres,
primary tumor-derived neurospheres, or snap frozen tumors were made into
lysates using RIPA buffer that contained 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma
Aldrich), 10 mM PMSF, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO4, and 1 mM DTT46. Following
protein quantification through BCA protein assays (Fisher Scientific) per the
manufacturer’s instructions, lysates were run on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis–Tris gra-
dient gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in Odyssey Blocking
Buffer (Li-Cor) with 0.2% Tween-20 overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with secondary
antibodies occurred at room temperature for 1 h at a dilution of 1:10,000. Anti-
bodies used for Western blot analysis can be found in Supplementary Methods. All
uncropped and unprocessed scans of representative blots can be found in Sup-
plementary Data 3.
qRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from virus infected p3 brainstem
progenitor neurospheres or primary derived tumors through the use of an RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. For qRT-PCR validation, cDNA
was synthesized from total mRNA using Superscript II and OligodT primers
(Invitrogen). All qRT-PCR experiments were performed using triplicate wells.
qRT-PCR analysis was performed on a Bio-Rad iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR
Detection System. Primers for all tested genes can be found in the Supplementary
Methods. Relative expression of target genes was analyzed using the ΔΔCt method.
RNAseq analysis. Paired-end fastq files were imported into Galaxy47, aligned to
the mm10 genome using RNA-STAR, and aligned reads were counted using
HTSeq-count with the Ensembl mm10 transcriptome GTF file as the feature file.
The following HTSeq-count parameters were used: stranded = no, mode = union,
minimum alignment quality = 10, map nonunique or ambiguous reads = none.
HTSeq-count files were imported into R (https://www.r-project.org/), genes with
<10 reads base mean were removed, and differential expression analysis was per-
formed with the DESeq2 package48 using the DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount
function with default settings. DESeq2 analyses were run comparing ACVR1 wild-
type to ACVR1 R206H mutant samples in the presence or absence of H3.1K27M
mutation. GSEA pre-ranked analysis was run using genes ranked according to the

Generation of glioma-like lesions and brainstem gliomas. DF1 cells were cul-
tured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)45. Transfection of DF1 cells
with RCAS plasmids was performed through the use of X-TremeGENE 9 (Roche)
per the manufacturer’s instructions. For generation of glioma-like lesions and
brainstem gliomas, 1 × 105 virus producing DF1 cells were injected intracranially
into the brainstem of neonatal Ntv-a;p53fl/fl or Ntv-a;p53fl/fl;PTENfl/fl pups
(postnatal days 3–5) in a 1 μL volume using a Hamilton syringe. Combination of
viruses were injected at a 1:1, 1:1:1, 1:1:1:1, or a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Mice were mon-
itored daily and euthanized with CO2 when they were symptomatic (including an
enlarged head, ataxia, weight loss up to 25%) or 6 months post injection if they
were asymptomatic.
Immunofluorescence. Preneoplastic lesions were assessed for ACVR1 expression
by immunofluorescence staining. In brief, 5 μM thick sections were deparaffinized
using xylene and decreasing concentrations of ethanol and rehydrated in PBS-T
(0.1% Triton X-100). Following blocking with normal goat serum, slides were
incubated with primary antibody (anti-DDK) at 4 °C overnight. Incubation with
secondary antibody AlexaFluor-594 occurred at room temperature for 1 h. Slides
were then mounted with Vectashield with Dapi (Vector Laboratories) and imaged
using a Zeiss Axio Imager.
Immunohistochemistry staining and analysis. Tumor tissue was fixed in 10%
formalin and embedded in paraffin by the Duke Pathology Core. 5 μm sections
were then cut using a Leica RM2235 microtome. Immunohistochemistry analysis
was performed using an automated processor (Discovery XT, Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc.). Antibodies used for IHC analysis are listed in Supplementary
Methods. For quantification of IHC staining, 10 different high-powered fields (×40
magnification) were captured for each tumor. Images were then analyzed using
Metamorph software in which total nuclear area of positive staining was compared
to total nuclear area.
Tumor grading. Formalin-fixed tumor samples were embedded in paraffin by the
Duke Pathology Core and subsequently cut into 5 μM thick sections using a Leica
RM2235 microtome. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed using
standard protocols. Tumor presence and grading were determined by a blinded
neuropathologist. High-grade tumors were classified on the presence of vascular
proliferation and/or pseudopalisading necrosis. Tumors with no vascular pro-
liferation and/or pseudopalisading necrosis were classified as low grade. Tumors
from found dead animals were excluded from grading analysis.
Bioluminescence and MR imaging. For in vivo bioluminescence imaging, Ntv-a;
p53fl/fl mice were infected with RCAS-ACVR1 R206H, RCAS-PDGFA, RCAS-
H3.1K27M, RCAS-Cre, and RCAS-Luciferase. D-Luciferin was reconstituted per
the manufacturer’s protocol (Gold Biotechnology) and administered intraper-
itoneally (10 μL/g) following sedation with isoflurane. Images were collected until
the peak signal was reached. All bioluminescence imaging was performed using an
IVIS Lumina XR in vivo imaging system. MR imaging was conducted on a 7 Tesla
Clinscan MRI (Bruker, Germany). Ten minutes prior to scanning each mouse was
injected intraperitoneally with gadolinium-based MR contrast agent at 0.3 mmol/
kg to allow for agent to reach the brain and enhance the tumor regions. Each
mouse was then anesthetized using a mixture of isoflurane and 100% O2 and placed
in an MR compatible cradle. Respiration was monitored and recorded (SAI
Instrument, NJ, USA) and body temperature was maintained at ~37 °C using a
heated water system built-in the cradle. MR images were acquired using a dedi-
cated four-channel mouse brain coil (Bruker, Germany) After initial localization
sequences (tri-axial gradient echo sequences) a series of 2D images were acquired
using T2 weighted Multi Spin Echo sequences in all 3 directions (transversal,
longitudinal, and sagittal) with TR = 2000 ms and TE = 40 ms with a spatial
resolution of ~80 μm and slice thickness of 0.7 mm. Finally, a 3D gradient T1
weighted echo sequence with isotropic resolution 150 μm was acquired with TR =
40 ms, TE = 3 ms, and Flip Angle FA = 10 yielding high-resolution 3D picture of
the brain of each mouse. Post-acquisition inspection of the set of 2D and 3D
images enabled assessment of morphological abnormalities associated with wide-
spread tumor progression and detection of tumor masses.
Treatment with ACVR1 inhibitors LDN212854 and LDN214117. For in vitro
drug experiments, primary tumor-derived neurospheres were generated as
described above. Neurospheres were then placed in 96-well plates and allowed to
adhere for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were treated with LDN212854, LDN214117, or
0.1% DMSO for 24 h. BrdU, CellTiter-Glo, and Western blot assays were per-
formed as described above to measure cell proliferation, cell viability, and pathway
inhibition. For short term in vivo treatment with LDN212854 Ntv-a;p53fl/fl mice
were infected with RCAS-ACVR1 R206H, RCAS-PDGFA, RCAS-H3.1K27M,
RCAS-Cre, and RCAS-Luciferase to facilitate the tracking of tumor development
and growth over time. Tumor presence was confirmed through luminescence
imaging as described above. Mice bearing tumors were then randomized and
treated with LDN212854 (10 mg/kg, twice daily, intraperitoneally) or vehicle (PBS)
for 5 consecutive days. Tissue was harvested 4 h after the final dose and fixed in
10% formalin or snap frozen. For in vivo survival studies with LDN212854 Ntv-a;
p53fl/fl mice were infected with RCAS-ACVR1 R206H, RCAS-PDGFA, RCAS-
H3.1K27M, and RCAS-Cre. Tumor presence was confirmed by MRI imaging as
described above. Mice were then administered LDN212854 (6 mg/kg, intraper-
itoneally) or vehicle (PBS) twice a day until euthanasia endpoints were met as
described above.
Human DIPG models. Primary pediatric human glioma cell lines, SF8628 and
DIPG007 (HSJD-DIPG-007), containing H3.3K27M mutations and SU-DIPG-IV
containing H3.1K27M mutations, were obtained from Dr. Rintaro Hashizume at
Northwestern University (Chicago, IL), Dr. Michelle Monje at Stanford University
(Stanford, CA), and Dr. Angel Montero Carcaboso at Hospital Sant Joan de Déu
(Barcelona, Spain), in accordance with institutionally approved protocol at each
institution49–51. SF8628 cells derived from surgical biopsy were maintained as an
exponentially growing monolayer in complete medium consisting of DMEM
(GIBCO 11965, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS with
penicillin–streptomycin and plasmocin. SU-DIPG IV cell culture derived from
DIPG autopsy tissue was grown as tumor neurospheres in tumor stem media
(TSM) consisting of DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), Neurobasal(-A) (Invitrogen), B27
(-A) (Invitrogen), human-bFGF (20 ng/mL; Shenandoah Biotechnology), human-
EGF (20 ng/mL; Shenandoah Biotechnology), human PDGF-AB (20 ng/mL; She-
nandoah Biotechnology), and heparin (10 ng/mL). DIPG007 (HSJD-DIPG-007)
cells were derived from the autopsy and were maintained as an exponentially
growing monolayer in TSM media supplemented with 5% FBS. Human cell cul-
tures were validated by DNA fingerprinting using short tandem repeat (STR)
analysis (PowerPlex16HS—Human specific; includes a mouse marker for detection
of mouse DNA) and checked for mycoplasma contamination. No mycoplasma was
detected. STR analysis can be found in Supplementary Data 4 and Supplementary
Figures 5–7. Proliferation experiments using human DIPG cell lines was measured
by a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) based cell proliferation ELISA assay kit (Roche) as
described above. All experiments were performed in triplicate wells for a total of 3
independent experiments. Additional de-identified human DIPG lysates harboring
ACVR1 mutations were collected upon autopsy at Children’s National Medical
Center as part of an IRB-approved protocol, IRB-1339, PI Dr. Javad Nazarian and
used in our study. For western blot analysis using human DIPG lysates, a total of 3
independent experiments were also performed.
Pharmacokinetic analysis. Snap frozen tissue was collected from Ntv-a;p53fl/fl
mice injected with RCAS-ACVR1 R206H, RCAS-PDGFA, RCAS-H3.1K27M,
RCAS-Cre, and RCAS-Luciferase and treated with LDN212854 (10 mg/kg, twice
daily, intraperitoneally) or vehicle (PBS) for 5 consecutive days. Measurement of
drug levels including sample processing and liquid chromatography tandem-mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay was performed by the Duke Cancer Institute,
Pharmaceutical Services-PK/PD Core Lab as described previously52.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
software (Version 7.0). For p3 brainstem progenitor neurosphere in vitro assays,
Western blots, and qRT-PCR experiments data are represented as the mean with
SEM and analyzed using paired t tests (two-tailed). Sample sizes in figure legends
represent the number of cell lines from independent p3 litters. All survival curves
were analyzed by log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Tumor incidence and grade were
measured by Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed). Quantification of in vivo experiments
including Western blot analysis from tumor-derived lysates, IHC staining, and
tumor-derived qRT-PCR analysis were performed using unpaired t tests (two-
tailed). For all tests, p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.
