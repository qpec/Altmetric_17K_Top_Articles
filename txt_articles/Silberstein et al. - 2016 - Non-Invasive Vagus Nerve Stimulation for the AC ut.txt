Objective.—To evaluate non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) as an acute cluster headache (CH) treatment.
Background.—Many patients with CH experience excruciating attacks at a frequency that is not sufficiently addressed
by current symptomatic treatments.
Methods.—One hundred fifty subjects were enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive nVNS or sham treatment for £ 1 month
during a double-blind phase; completers could enter a 3-month nVNS open-label phase. The primary end point was response rate,
defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved pain relief (pain intensity of 0 or 1) at 15 minutes after treatment initiation for
the first CH attack without rescue medication use through 60 minutes. Secondary end points included the sustained response rate
(15-60 minutes). Subanalyses of episodic cluster headache (eCH) and chronic cluster headache (cCH) cohorts were prespecified.
Results.—The intent-to-treat population comprised 133 subjects: 60 nVNS-treated (eCH, n5 38; cCH, n5 22) and 73 sham-
treated (eCH, n 5 47; cCH, n5 26). A response was achieved in 26.7% of nVNS-treated subjects and 15.1% of sham-treated sub-
jects (P 5 .1). Response rates were significantly higher with nVNS than with sham for the eCH cohort (nVNS, 34.2%; sham,
10.6%; P 5 .008) but not the cCH cohort (nVNS, 13.6%; sham, 23.1%; P 5 .48). Sustained response rates were significantly higher
with nVNS for the eCH cohort (P 5 .008) and total population (P 5 .04). Adverse device effects (ADEs) were reported by 35/150
(nVNS, 11; sham, 24) subjects in the double-blind phase and 18/128 subjects in the open-label phase. No serious ADEs occurred.
Conclusions.—In one of the largest randomized sham-controlled studies for acute CH treatment, the response rate was
not significantly different (vs sham) for the total population; nVNS provided significant, clinically meaningful, rapid, and
sustained benefits for eCH but not for cCH, which affected results in the total population. This safe and well-tolerated
treatment represents a novel and promising option for eCH. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01792817.

INTRODUCTION
Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache
disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral exacer-
bations of severe or very severe pain lasting �15
minutes to 3 hours and accompanied by transient
symptoms such as rhinorrhea, lacrimation, miosis,
ptosis, and periorbital edema.1 The condition is now
classified as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia,1
with the attacks resulting from vascular changes in
cranial circulation driven by trigeminal autonomic
reflex activation.2 A worldwide lifetime CH preva-
lence of 0.12% has been reported;3 most patients
have episodic cluster headache (eCH), and 10% to
15% have chronic cluster headache (cCH).1 The
International Classification of Headache Disorders
(ICHD) recognizes eCH and cCH as clinically

 distinct subtypes.1,4 In eCH, attack periods may last
from 7 days to 1 year and are separated by �1-month
pain-free intervals.1 Chronic CH attack periods last
for >1 year either without remission or with <1-
month remission periods.1 CH imposes substantial
burdens on quality of life and health care resource
utilization, worsens work absenteeism and social
functioning, and is typically accompanied by clinically
significant disability that can engender psychiatric
comorbidities with possible suicidal tendencies.5,6
According to evidence-based recommendations,
the primary symptomatic treatments for CH attacks
are subcutaneous sumatriptan and inhaled oxygen.7,8
Alternative acute CH treatments include intranasal
triptans
and
intravenous
dihydroergotamine
(DHE).7–9 Only subcutaneous sumatriptan and intra-
venous DHE are approved in the United States for
the acute pharmacologic treatment of CH.10,11 Treat-
ment with intravenous DHE is impractical,12 and the
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)-
approved labeling for sumatriptan in CH indicates a
maximum of two doses per day,11 which may be inad-
equate for many patients including those with fre-
quent attacks (ie, 3 to 8 per day)13 and may lead to
medication overuse headache with multiple daily dos-
ing.1,14 The limited therapeutic options for the acute
treatment of CH reflect an unmet medical need.
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromod-
ulation technique, administered via an implantable or
non-invasive method, that affects several central path-
ways including those involved in CH.15 The hypocretin
and orexin pathway has been suggested to have a role
in the dorsal vagal complex and CH pathophysiolo-
gy,16,17 supporting the therapeutic potential of VNS in
patients with the disorder. The investigational nVNS
gammaCoreV
R
device
(electroCore,
LLC; Basking
Ridge, NJ, USA) transfers electrical impulses transcu-
taneously to the cervical branch of the vagus nerve.15
Data from a 1-year open-label study (N5 19) sug-
gested that nVNS is potentially efficacious for acute
and prophylactic management of eCH and cCH.18 In
the randomized controlled study of Non-invasive
Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) for PREVention
and Acute Treatment of Chronic Cluster Headache,
weekly attack frequency reductions were significantly
more pronounced with daily prophylactic nVNS as an
adjunct to standard of care (SoC) than with SoC alone
(P 5 .02).19 On the basis of these previous findings, we
hypothesized that acute nVNS therapy is effective and
safe for the treatment of CH attacks. Here, we report
results from the study of nVNS for the ACute Treat-
ment of Cluster Headache (ACT1).
METHODS
ACT1 Study Design.—This pivotal, randomized,
double-blind, sham-controlled prospective study was
conducted from February 2013 to October 2014
across 20 U.S. centers, including university-based/
academic medical centers and headache/pain/neuro-
logical clinics and institutes (ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fier: NCT01792817). The study was designed to assess
the superiority of nVNS treatment in comparison with a
sham device and comprised two phases: (1) a double-
blind phase in which subjects were randomized to
receive nVNS or sham treatment for 1 month or until
five CH attacks were treated and (2) an open-label
phase in which subjects who completed the double-blind
phase could subsequently receive 3 months of nVNS
treatment. Investigators obtained institutional review
board approval, and subjects provided written informed
consent. Authors had full access to all study data.
Subjects.—Subjects were recruited from investiga-
tor databases and via clinical practice Web sites and
Web advertisement. All subjects were nonpregnant/
nonlactating 18- to 75-year-old adults diagnosed with
eCH or cCH according to ICHD, 2nd edition criteria.4
Key exclusion criteria were a history of aneurysm,
intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumors, significant
head trauma, prolonged QT interval, arrhythmia, ven-
tricular tachycardia/fibrillation, syncope, or seizure;
structural intracranial/cervical vascular lesions; anoth-
er significant pain disorder; cardiovascular disease;
uncontrolled hypertension; abnormal baseline electro-
cardiogram; botulinum toxin injections in the past 3
months; nerve blocks in the past 1 month; previous CH
surgery, bilateral/right cervical vagotomy, carotid end-
arterectomy, or right vascular neck surgery; electrical
device implantation; and current use of prophylactic
medications for indications other than CH.

repeated
once
every 40 milliseconds (25 Hz), generating a 24-V
peak voltage and 60-mA peak output current; users
could adjust the stimulation amplitude. The appear-
ance, weight, visual and audible feedback, and user
application were identical for the sham and nVNS
devices. The sham device produces a low-frequency
(0.1 Hz) biphasic signal that does not stimulate the
vagus nerve or generally cause muscle contraction.
After applying conductive gel to the two stainless
steel contact surfaces, subjects administered three
consecutive 2-minute stimulations (Fig. 2) to the
right side of the neck at the onset of premonitory
symptoms or pain. Subjects self-treated up to five
CH attacks in the double-blind phase; only one
attack could be treated during a 12-hour period.
There were no limitations on the number of attacks
that could be treated in the open-label phase. As-
needed use of abortive or pain-relieving rescue
medications was permitted as soon as 15 minutes
after initiation of each nVNS treatment.
Randomization and Blinding.—Using
indepen-
dent
statistician–generated
randomization
sched-
ules, subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to
receive nVNS or sham treatment (variable block
design, stratified by site). Devices labeled with a 3-
digit randomization number were not outwardly
identified as active or sham and were allocated to
the sites by a third-party distributor according to the
randomization scheme. Trained study site personnel
(investigator or study coordinator) distributed devi-
ces to subjects in chronological order according to
the randomization number. Investigators, subjects,
and study coordinators were blinded to treatment
assignments. After the first treatment and at the end
of the double-blind phase, subjects indicated the
treatment they thought they had received (nVNS or
sham) via blinding questionnaires.
Study End Points.—The primary efficacy end
point was response rate, assessed in the double-
blind phase and defined as the proportion of all
subjects who achieved a pain intensity score of 0 or
1 on a 5-point scale (0, no pain; 4, very severe pain)
at 15 minutes after treatment initiation (Fig. 2) for
the first CH attack; rescue medication use within 60
minutes was considered a treatment failure. The
response rate was also evaluated at the end of the
open-label phase in a post hoc analysis. Secondary
end points, assessed in the double-blind phase,
included sustained treatment response rate (defined
as the proportion of subjects with a pain intensity
score of 0 or 1 without rescue medication use at 15
through 60 minutes after treatment initiation for the
first CH attack) and average of all subjects’ mean

 pain intensities at 15 minutes after treatment initia-
tion for all attacks (up to five attacks per subject). To
enhance understanding of the clinical potential of
nVNS, percentages of patients who were responders
(pain intensity score of 0 or 1) and of those who were
pain-free (pain intensity score of 0) at 15 minutes for
�50% of treated attacks in the double-blind phase
were evaluated in post hoc analyses. Prespecified
exploratory end points in the double-blind phase
included attack duration, rescue medication use, and
perception of the device. All efficacy end points were
evaluated in subgroup analyses of the eCH and cCH
cohorts and in the total study population.
The primary safety end point was the occur-
rence of serious adverse device effects (SADEs) in
the double-blind phase, including those related to
the sham device and/or CH events. Other safety
outcomes included all adverse event (AE) occur-
rences in both study phases.
Sample Size Determination.—A sample size of
120 subjects (60 per treatment arm) was determined
to provide 82% power with respect to the primary
end point, with a significance level of P � .05 for a
2-sided test. To allow for an approximate 20%
attrition rate (eg, subject withdrawals), a total of up
to 150 subjects was planned for enrollment and ran-
domization. Assumed response rates were 25% for
the sham group and 50% for the nVNS group. On
50% completion of enrollment, a review of prespec-
ified interim analysis results by the data safety mon-
itoring board revealed no safety concerns or other
reasons for study discontinuation, and enrollment
of the planned sample size was completed. No P
value adjustments were required after completion
of this interim data analysis.
Data Collection.—After baseline information was
collected during screening, subjects used diaries to
record pain intensity (rated at 15 minutes, 30
minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after treatment),
attack duration, rescue medication use, AEs, device
perceptions, and blinding questionnaire responses
for each attack.
Statistical Analyses.—Statistical efficacy analyses
were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) popula-
tion, defined as all randomly assigned subjects who
treated �1 CH attack. Attack duration and device
perception analyses were conducted on observed
cases (ie, subjects from the ITT population who
provided data for these end points), and attacks
that lasted longer than 180 minutes were excluded
according to ICHD criteria.4 Descriptive statistics
were used for continuous variables. Categorical var-
iables were summarized by frequency distribution
and proportion; Clopper-Pearson (exact) 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for response
rates. Group differences for the primary end point
and other categorical variable comparisons were
performed using Fisher’s exact test (if expected fre-
quency �5 for �1 cell) or the chi-square test. Line-
ar mixed-effect regression models were used to
compare
mean
treatment
group
intensities
to
account for repeated measures per subject. Attack
duration comparisons were performed using the
t test. Comparisons of within-subject response rates
between the double-blind and open-label phases
were performed using the McNemar test for paired
proportions. Missing data were imputed as failures
for response variables and using the last observa-
tion carried forward for attack intensity. For sub-
jects who did not enter the open-label phase, data
for this phase were imputed to failure. For all
response variables, subjects with missing data at
any time point(s) for rescue medication use (ie, 15,
30,
and/or
60
minutes)
were
considered
non-
responders.
Statistical
significance
was
set
at
P < .05. Subgroup efficacy analyses of eCH and
cCH cohorts were prespecified on the basis of dis-
tinct ICHD clinical definitions4 and the possibility
that acute attacks of eCH and cCH might respond
differently to treatment20 but were not indepen-
dently powered to demonstrate statistical signifi-
cance. P values are provided for these analyses
without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Safe-
ty analyses were conducted on all treated subjects.
All statistical analyses were performed indepen-
dently by North American Science Associates Inc.
(Minneapolis, MN, USA) using SASV
R 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Subjects.—A total of 150 subjects (Fig. 3) were
enrolled in ACT1 and randomly assigned to receive
Headache
1321
 nVNS (n 5 73) or sham (n 5 77) treatment, includ-
ing 133 who met criteria for the ITT population
(nVNS, n 5 60; sham, n 5 73). Of the 128 subjects
who entered the open-label phase, 100 completed
the study. Reasons for discontinuation are shown in
Figure 3. Demographic and baseline characteristics
(Table 1) were similar between the nVNS and
sham groups and were consistent with those of a
typical CH population.4 Of all 150 subjects, most
had eCH (67%) and the remaining 33% had cCH,
and 102 (68%) subjects were receiving prophylactic
therapy for CH at baseline.
Response Rates (Double-Blind Phase).—Response
rates (Fig. 4) in the total population were 26.7%
in the nVNS group and 15.1% in the sham group
(P 5 .1).
In
subgroup
analyses,
a
significantly
higher
response
rate
was
demonstrated
with
nVNS (34.2%) than with sham treatment (10.6%)
for the eCH cohort (P 5 .008) but not for the
cCH
cohort
(nVNS,
13.6%;
sham,
23.1%;
P 5 .48).
Sustained Treatment Response Rates and Pain
Intensity (Double-Blind Phase).—Sustained treat-
ment response rates (Fig. 5) for the eCH cohort
and total population were significantly higher with
nVNS than with sham treatment (eCH: nVNS,
34.2%; sham, 10.6%; P 5 .008; total: nVNS, 26.7%;
sham, 12.3%; P 5 .04). For the cCH cohort, sus-
tained response rates were similar between groups
(nVNS, 13.6%; sham, 15.4%; P 5 1.0). For both
cohorts and for the total population, the average of
all subjects’ mean pain intensities at 15 minutes
after treatment for all CH attacks was not signifi-
cantly different between the nVNS and sham treat-
ment groups (eCH: nVNS, 2.0 [95% CI: 1.8, 2.3];
sham, 2.0 [95% CI: 1.8, 2.3]; P 5 1.0; cCH: nVNS,
2.3 [95% CI: 1.9, 2.6]; sham, 1.9 [95% CI: 1.6, 2.3];
P 5 .2; total: nVNS, 2.1 [95% CI: 1.9, 2.3]; sham,

 population, who were responders at 15 minutes for
�50% of treated attacks was significantly higher with
nVNS (34.2%) than with sham treatment (14.9%;
P 5 .04) (Table 2). Results were also significant in
only the eCH cohort for the proportion of those who
were pain-free at 15 minutes for �50% of treated
attacks (nVNS, 15.8%; sham, 2.1%; P5 .04) (Table 2).
Similarly, differences between groups that favored
nVNS for mean duration of the first attack in the
double-blind phase were more pronounced in the eCH
cohort (12.8 minutes; P5 .21) than in the cCH cohort
(3.1 minutes; P5 .82) or in the total population (9.3
minutes; P5 .25) (Table 2).
Device Perceptions.—At the end of the double-
blind phase, subjects rated treatment satisfaction (1,
extremely satisfied; 5, not at all satisfied), their will-
ingness to recommend the device to a friend or
family member, and ease of device use (1, very
easy; 4, very difficult). Proportions of subjects who
were extremely satisfied, very satisfied, or satisfied
with their treatment were 38.3% for nVNS and
31.9% for sham treatment. The percentage of sub-
jects who indicated that they would recommend
their study device to a friend or family member
was similar between groups (�55%). Of all sub-
jects, �90% reported that their device was very
easy or somewhat easy to use.
Blinding.—In the nVNS group, the blinding esti-
mate calculated using the Bang index21 (with values
closer to 0 indicating better blinding effectiveness)
was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.37) after the first treat-
ment, indicating that a considerable proportion of
patients correctly guessed their treatment allocation
beyond chance. However, successful blinding with

 nVNS was achieved at the end of the double-blind
phase, with a blinding estimate of 0.10 (95% CI:
20.08, 0.28). Blinding for the sham group also
became successful during the study with negative
estimates of 20.21 (95% CI: 20.37, 20.05) after
the first treatment, which indicated an excess of
incorrect guesses potentially related to incomplete
blinding, and 20.11 (95% CI: 20.28, 0.06) at the

Efficacy Results (Open-Label Phase).—Rates of
response to nVNS in the open-label phase were

Safety and Tolerability.—No SADEs occurred
during the study. Of all subjects, 48% (72/150) had
�1 AE during the study (double-blind phase, 49/150
subjects [nVNS group, 18; sham group, 31]; open-
label phase, 42/128 subjects). ADEs occurred in 35
subjects
during
the
double-blind
phase
(nVNS
group, 11; sham group, 24) and 18 subjects during
the open-label phase (Table 3). Application site
reactions and nervous system AEs occurred more
frequently with sham treatment than with nVNS in
the double-blind phase. Of 13 non–device-related
serious AEs in the nVNS group, CH pain and hospi-
talization was reported twice by one subject during
the double-blind phase and once by two subjects
during the open-label phase, including one subject
who also reported multiple upper extremity deep
vein
thromboses,
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm,
pneumonia, anasarca, acute respiratory failure, and
urethral trauma in the open-label phase. Mesenteric
ischemia, herniated disk, and ureteral calculus were
reported once by one subject each in the open-label
phase. Only one subject discontinued from the study
because of AEs, which were mild or moderate, were
not device related, and occurred in the open-label
phase.
DISCUSSION
The ACT1 study is one of the first and largest
randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trials to
evaluate the effects of a non-invasive neuromodula-
tion device for the acute treatment of eCH and
cCH. Significant effects of nVNS were not observed
for the response rate in the total population but
were seen in the eCH cohort across a broad range
of end points including response rate, sustained
treatment
response
rate,
and
percentages
of
patients who were responders, and of those who
were
pain-free,

 an initial treatment response to nVNS is an indica-
tor of subsequent consistency of response (ie, for
�50% of attacks). Although significant differences
were observed between the nVNS and sham groups
among the eCH cohort, these differences were not
observed among the cCH cohort, a finding that
affected the consistency of significant results among
the total population (Table 4). A difference of �10
minutes between the nVNS and sham groups in the
total population for mean duration of the first
attack during the double-blind phase may be clini-
cally meaningful (ie, provides practical advantages
that address current therapeutic challenges22) in
CH despite the lack of statistical powering. Acute
nVNS therapy for CH attacks was well tolerated
and achieved clinically meaningful efficacy results
(vs sham).
Study limitations include the analysis of the
cCH cohort as part of the primary end point, the
need
for
careful
interpretation
of
subanalyses
results, challenges with blinding inherent in medical
device studies, and the time to first measurement of
response used to define the primary efficacy end
point. Primary end point results were significant for
the eCH cohort but were diminished overall by the
cCH cohort results. When subanalyses results are
interpreted, the lack of statistical powering and the
potential for type 1 and type 2 errors (in the eCH
and cCH cohorts, respectively) should be considered.
The difference in AE descriptions provided by sub-
jects treated with the nVNS (eg, drooping/pulling of
the lip/face) and sham (eg, burning, soreness, sting-
ing) devices may help to explain results of the blind-
ing analyses, which are similar to those observed in
previous sham-controlled trials.23,24 The burning sen-
sation and other pain-related AEs reported by the
sham-treated group in ACT1 may have led to a pla-
cebo effect based on impressions that the subjects
were receiving active treatment. Sham device–associ-
ated pain may have also produced a diffuse noxious
inhibitory control (DNIC) effect, a phenomenon in
which the application of a noxious electrical stimulus
to remote body regions inhibits dorsal horn activity
and attenuates the original pain.25,26 Potential place-
bo and DNIC effects in the sham group may have
reduced the magnitude of the therapeutic benefit
associated with nVNS treatment.
Another limitation was that the time point used
to
define
the
ACT1
primary
end
point
was
15 minutes after treatment initiation, which has
been used in other CH studies,27–29 rather than
after
treatment
completion.

 15-minute interval comprised an 8-minute nVNS
stimulation period followed by only a 7-minute
period that appeared to be sufficient for significant
treatment effects to become evident in the eCH
cohort but not in the cCH cohort or total popula-
tion (Fig. 2). The 15-minute assessment time point
may have also contributed to the nonsignificant dif-
ference in average pain intensities between the
nVNS and sham groups; other potential contribut-
ing factors include the combined statistical influ-
ence of the responders and nonresponders as well
as the assessment after all attacks (rather than after
the first attack). Therefore, methodological implica-
tions in ACT1 regarding distinct effects among the
eCH and cCH cohorts, the painful sham stimula-
tion, and the use of a longer time to first measure-
ment of response such as 30 minutes, as used in
CH studies of other therapies,20,28,30 should be con-
sidered for future randomized controlled trials.
Findings
from
previous
mechanistic/imaging
and
clinical
studies
may
support
the
different
effects seen between the two cohorts in ACT1 as
well as the apparent treatment refractoriness seen
in the cCH cohort during the study’s double-blind
phase.
In
a
voxel-based
morphometry
study,
patients experiencing eCH attacks had increases in
gray matter (GM) (vs healthy controls) within most
of the brain regions known to be associated with
acute/transient pain, whereas patients with cCH
had GM decreases within several regions known to
be associated with pain processing and chronifica-
tion, such as the posterior part of the anterior or
cingulate cortex and amygdala.31 An observed neg-
ative correlation between GM volume and disease
duration supports an impairment in recovery and
the
treatment
resistance
seen
among the
cCH
cohort in ACT1.31 Similarly, clinical studies have
shown that subjects with cCH had compromised
responses to other acute therapies including suma-
triptan,19,32,33 a primary symptomatic treatment.7,8
Persistent interictal pain and allodynia, a known
marker of treatment refractoriness in migraine,34,35
may
have
affected
responses
in
subjects
with
cCH,33 but the potential association between these
features and treatment response was not examined
in ACT1 and requires further evaluation in CH.
These features, along with the ongoing attacks of
cCH, may have cumulative effects on brain physiol-
ogy31 and patients’ initial ability to respond to
treatment. In contrast to results from the 1-month
double-blind phase of ACT1, findings from the 3-
month open-label phase showed that the response
rate of the cCH cohort (35.4%) was similar to that
of the eCH cohort (29.4%). These results suggest
further benefit with continued acute nVNS use for
patients with cCH, which is consistent with findings
from prophylactic nVNS studies in cCH and chron-
ic migraine as well as VNS studies in epilepsy and
depression.19,36–38
The ACT1 response definition, mild pain inten-
sity or pain-free at 15 minutes, was also used for
primary analyses in a study of subcutaneous suma-
triptan (N 5 49) for a combined eCH and cCH pop-
ulation27
and
a
study
of
an
implantable
sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation device
(N 5 32) for a cCH population.39 However, the
ability to compare data from these three trials is
limited. The subcutaneous sumatriptan and SPG
stimulation studies involved relatively small sample
sizes and did not report results specifically for sub-
jects with eCH, whereas ACT1 demonstrated a sig-
nificant benefit of nVNS in this subgroup. It should
also be noted that SPG stimulation requires inva-
sive surgical device implantation.39 Subcutaneous
sumatriptan and inhaled oxygen are the most com-
monly used pharmacologic acute CH therapies.7,8
In addition to the FDA-approved maximum dosing
of subcutaneous sumatriptan in CH (ie, 2 doses per
day) being inadequate for patients with frequent
attacks (ie, 3 to 8 attacks per day),13 this treatment
is associated with injection site reactions (eg, pain,
swelling) and neurologic symptoms (eg, dizziness,
tiredness)
and
has
cardiovascular
contraindica-
tions.11,27 Inhaled oxygen does not have a maxi-
mum frequency of use or associations with AEs,
but its use may be limited because of the size and
lack of portability of the tanks, coupled with the
need for continuous access to the oxygen sup-
ply.12,13 Considering the tolerability, dosing, and/or
practicality issues associated with currently avail-
able symptomatic treatments, nVNS provides a
safe, well-tolerated, effective, and easy-to-use non-

 invasive option for acute CH treatment that has
produced
significant
and
clinically
meaningful
responses within 15 minutes in patients with eCH.
nVNS can be easily incorporated into the acute
treatment paradigm for eCH. It may be particularly
useful in clinical settings where the use of current
acute treatment options is challenging due to the
risk of medication overuse, a desire to minimize
AEs, or an inability to treat in a timely manner.
CONCLUSIONS
This trial is among the largest randomized sham-
controlled studies of a therapeutic intervention for
the acute treatment of CH. In the total population, a
significant difference in response rates between the
nVNS and sham groups was not observed. In sub-
jects with eCH, nVNS therapy offered significant
and clinically meaningful benefits over sham treat-
ment, including rapid (within 15 minutes) and sus-
tained (through 60 minutes) pain relief. Significant
effects were not observed in subjects with cCH, a
finding that affected results in the total population.
The nVNS device was also safe and well tolerated
and thus represents a novel acute treatment option
with a positive risk-benefit profile for patients with
eCH. A report of a similar large, randomized, sham-
controlled trial completed in Europe is forthcoming
and may validate the results seen in this study.
