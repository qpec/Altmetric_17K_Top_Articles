Introduction
Prevention and management of chronic disease is funda-
mental to improve population-level health outcomes and 
blunt the upward trend in health care spending in the United 
States. Close to three-quarters of physician office and hospi-
tal outpatient clinic visits involve drug therapy.1 The cost of 
drug therapy in the United States has been escalating because 
of increased utilization and drug prices.2 However, the cost 
associated with drug use reaches beyond the purchase of 
prescribed medications to encompass additional medical 
costs of morbidity and mortality resulting from medication 
regimens that are not optimized to effectively treat the indi-
cation resulting in a treatment failure (TF), where the resolv-
able medical problem is not adequately treated, a new 
medical problem (NMP), where a newly prescribed medica-
tion causes or contributes to an incident clinical symptom or 
syndrome, or both a TF and NMP. This cost has most recently 
been estimated as $290 billion equating to 13% of total 
annual US medical costs in 2008.3 Although widely misde-
scribed in the published literature and policy documents as 
the cost associated with “patient nonadherence to medica-
tions,” this estimate and the preceding estimates ($76.6 bil-
lion in 1995 and $177.4 billion in 2000) actually reflect 
medical resource utilization caused by TFs and NMPs that 
arising from nonoptimized medication use. Nonadherence to 
the indicated medication regimen is just one of multiple

Abstract
Background: Public attention and recent US Congressional activity has intensified focus on escalating medication prices. 
However, the actual cost of medication use extends beyond the up-front cost of purchasing medicines. It also encompasses 
the additional medical costs of morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication regimens, including 
medication nonadherence. Objectives: Applying the most current nationally representative data sources, our goal was 
to estimate the cost of prescription drug–related morbidity and mortality in the United States. Methods: Total costs of 
nonoptimized prescription drug use and average pathway costs for a patient who experienced a treatment failure (TF), a 
new medical problem (NMP), or a TF and NMP were modeled in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) 
and TreeAge Pro Healthcare, v2014 (TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA), respectively. Results: The estimated 
annual cost of prescription drug–related morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy was 
$528.4 billion in 2016 US dollars, with a plausible range of $495.3 billion to $672.7 billion. The average cost of an individual 
experiencing TF, NMP, or TF and NMP after initial prescription use were $2481 (range: $2233, $2742), $2610 (range: 
$2374, $2848) and $2572 (range: $2408, $2751), respectively. Conclusions: The estimated annual cost of drug-related 
morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy was $528.4 billion, equivalent to 16% of total 
US health care expenditures in 2016. We propose expansion of comprehensive medication management programs by 
clinical pharmacists in collaborative practices with physicians and other prescribers as an effective and scalable approach to 
mitigate these avoidable costs and improve patient outcomes.

potential causal factors leading to a TF, resulting in down-
stream health services use.4,5
The need for a more current estimate of the cost of 
nonoptimized medication use is clear given the signifi-
cant movements in our health care system since the 2008 
estimate.3 Since then, health care reform has expanded 
medication use in the United States. For example, 
patients who gained coverage via Medicaid expansion 
under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) filled 79% more 
prescriptions.6
Escalating prices of medications in the United States 
have garnered public outcry. However, the limited use of 
systematic and coordinated approaches that reduce costs 
attributable to nonoptimized medication regimens demands 
similar attention. A more current estimate of the cost related 
to nonoptimized medication utilization can serve as a linch-
pin in policy, payment, and health care delivery system 
reform. These are important elements as we contend not 
only with the cost of medications, but also with the impact 
of prescription drugs on overall medical costs, patient out-
comes, and the valuation of interventions to optimize medi-
cation use.
The objective of this article is to update the estimated 
cost of drug-related morbidity and mortality resulting from 
nonoptimized medication therapy from a third-party payer 
perspective.
Methods
Data and Sources
This cost-of-illness (COI) analysis used the original deci-
sion analytic model and probabilities used by all prior pub-
lished estimates (Figure 1), cost data sources most closely 
matching those used in the most recent update, and the 
same source for estimated number of physician office visits 
in the United States.3-5,7 All costs were adjusted for medical 
inflation to 2016.8 Our total cost estimate reflects the most 
current monetary value of medical resources and the fre-
quency of use based on the most current US physician 
office visit estimates. Costs captured in this analysis were 
for resource use spending on treatment of a medical prob-
lem (ie, direct medical costs). For this COI study, we fol-
lowed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines for reporting 
health economic evaluations in construction of this manu-
script. CHEERS recommends description of the incremen-
tal cost per outcome benefit. A priori, our objective was 
completion of a COI study that quantified the cost of the 
medical problem. Hence, incremental cost per benefit was 
not evalulated.9
The original modeling included path probabilities based 
on expert opinion.4 The two published updates of the cost 
analysis retained these probabilities, although Ernst and 
Grizzle5 did search the literature for evidence to revise the 
original proportions and found none.3,5 Similarly, our litera-
ture search did not uncover published data to support modi-
fying the original probabilities in the prior models. Applying 
PubMed database search terms drug therapy problem, med-
ication related problem, drug-related problem, new medical 
problem, and treatment failure with date range January 1, 
2000, to November 17, 2017, produced 90 articles which, 
on review, did not contain updated probabilities for progres-
sion to NMPs and TFs or downstream probabilities for 
health services utilization on review by one of the study 
authors (JDH). Removing date range criteria yielded the 
prior published study by Ernst and Grizzle.
Costs. Base case analyses used the weighted average of the 
mean physician fees for new and established patients of 
$222 per visit (2014; $236, 2016 value).10 Average prescrip-
tion cost of $71 ($74, 2016 value), calculated as total pre-
scription sales divided by total number of prescriptions sold 
in 2015 ($286 797 651 607/4 065 175 064).11,12 Average 
cost of an ED visit was $1233 ($1571, 2016 value) based on 
the 10 most common types of ED visits.13 Average cost of a 
hospital admission was $13 450 ($14 324, 2016 value).14 
The average cost of a long-term care (LTC) admission—$62 
178 in 2016—was calculated using data from the 1999 and 
2004 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
longtermcare.gov.15-17 The NNHS is a validated, nationally 
representative survey that provides estimates of nursing 
homes, current residents, and discharges in the United 
States that include explicit capture of duration of stay. Using 
the NNHS from the CDC resulted in a larger length of stay 
(LOS) than the reference used in prior estimates.4,5 The 
most recent 2004 NNHS included the average time since 
admission (ATSA) not average LOS (ALOS) as in previous 
versions.16 Therefore, 2004 ALOS was estimated to be 254 
days via multiplication of the 2004 ATSA (835 days) by the 
ratio of ALOS (271.5 days) to ATSA in the 1999 NNHS 
data (892.4, 271.5/892.4 = 30.4%). Multiplying the ALOS 
by the 2010 average semiprivate daily cost ($205/day) 
resulted in a value of $52 078 ($62 178 in 2016 dollars).17 
Consistent with prior published estimates, death attribut-
able to a TF or NMP was assumed to be preceded by a hos-
pitalization. Hence, although base case cost of a death event 
was zero dollars, the pathway cost resulting in death result-
ing from TF or NMP included the cost of a hospitalization, 
and death events contributed to the total hospitalization 
count.4,5 The number of physician office visits used as the 
basis for the population scale-up was 928 630 000.18
Data Analyses
Consistent with prior published studies, total costs of nonop-
timized prescription drug use incorporating resource costs

and probabilities were modeled in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 
Corporation, Redmond, WA).4,5 The average pathway costs 
from initial provider visit for a patient who experienced a TF, 
NMP, and TF and NMP were calculated within a decision ana-
lytic model (Figure 1) using TreeAge Pro Healthcare, v2014 
(TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA). Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation were com-
pleted to generate a plausible range around the mean esti-
mates. If available, published standard errors were used in the 
sensitivity analyses. Otherwise, an error margin of 10% of

the mean input estimate was applied for these analyses con-
sistent with the 10% range used in the Ernst and Grizzle 
analysis.5
Population Scale-up to Estimated Cost of Nonoptimized Drug 
Utilization. The total cost of morbidity and mortality result-
ing from nonoptimized drug utilization was calculated by 
multiplying the number of health service events (estimated 
via proportions in the decision analytic model) by estimated 
event costs. Sensitivity analyses were completed to investi-
gate the impact of using other nationally representative 
sources of data for the resource costs. Specifically, cost of 
ED visits, hospitalizations, LTC, and the number of physi-
cian office visits were modified in these analyses. ED visit 
cost was decreased to the reported average cost across all 
types of ED visits of $1116 in 2016 dollars.19 Hospitaliza-
tion cost was increased to $24 600 (net patient revenue 
[$813 437 515 663] divided by total number of admissions 
[33 066 720]) adjusted to $26 199 in 2016 dollars and 
decreased to $10 889 adjusted to $11 597 in 2016 dol-
lars.20,21 The average cost of a LTC admission was decreased 
to $57 158 using average daily cost of $225.22 The number 
of physician office visits was increased to 1.067 billion to 
reflect a recent estimate, which may better reflect ACA 
impact.23 Total pathway costs beginning with initial visit for 
each of the specific scenarios delineated in the decision ana-
lytic model were tabulated (Table 1).
Results
The estimated annual cost of prescription drug–related mor-
bidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medica-
tion therapy was $528.4 billion in 2016 US dollars (Table 
2). Sensitivity analyses using alternate cost inputs revealed 
total costs ranging from a minimum of $495.3 billion in the 
scenario that used a lower estimate of hospitalization cost 
(CDC Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project cost data) to 
a maximum of $672.7 billion using the highest estimate of 
hospitalization cost (American Hospital Association cost 
data).20,21 Using the Department of Health and Human 
Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality esti-
mate for ED visit cost produced a total cost estimate of 
$517.7 billion.19 Applying a larger estimate of physician 
office visits produced a total cost of $607.2 billion.23 Using 
a lower LTC cost estimate derived from the Genworth Cost 
of Care Survey, the total cost estimate was $505.5 billion.22 
Hence, the estimated annual cost of prescription drug–
related morbidity and mortality yielded a plausible range of 
$495.3 to $672.7 billion.
Based on the output from the decision-analytic model 
(Figure 1), the average cost of a physician encounter that 
incorporates costs of patients receiving no drug therapy, 
those receiving successful drug therapy, and downstream 
medical costs of nonoptimized drug utilization was 
estimated to be $850 per encounter (plausible range based 
on sensitivity analyses: $792, $908). The average cost of an 
individual experiencing TF, NMP, or TF and NMP after ini-
tial prescription use were $2481 (plausible range: $2233, 
$2742), $2610 (plausible range: $2374, $2848), and $2572 
(plausible range: $2408, $2751).
Discussion
This analysis has updated the annual cost of drug-related 
morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medi-
cation therapy from a third-party payer perspective and esti-
mated it to be $528.4 billion. Nonoptimized medication 
therapy was also estimated to result in 275 689 deaths per 
year. The cost estimate represents the additional medical 
resources utilized (eg, additional medications, ED visits, 
hospitalizations, LTC stays, provider visits) to resolve prob-
lems attributable to initial indication and utilization of pre-
scription drugs, including nonadherence to indicated 
therapy. The potentially avoidable $528.4 billion estimate is 
roughly 16% of the total US health care expenditure ($3.2 
trillion in 2015).24 This proportion has doubled over the past 
20 years since the original 1995 estimate that represented 
8% of total US health care expenditures (2000 and 2008 
estimates represented 13% of total health care spending).3-5
Medical price inflation alone would account for an 
increase from the 2008 estimate of $290 billion to $370 bil-
lion in 2016, leaving an excess of $158 billion attributable to 
increased numbers of patients with TF, NMP, or a combina-
tion of TF and NMP caused by nonoptimized prescription 
drug utilization. We estimated that a patient experiencing 
TF, a NMP caused by drug therapy, or a combination of both 
costs approximately $2500 considering additional drug ther-
apy and other medical costs needed for resolution.
Our estimate of $528 billion represents only direct medi-
cal costs, which are relevant for a third-party payer perspec-
tive. The estimate does not include direct nonmedical costs 
(eg, transportation or caregiving costs) nor indirect costs 
related to lost productivity or disability. The estimate is 
greater than the direct medical costs reported for many 
prevalent chronic diseases such as heart disease and stroke 
($230 billion), diagnosed diabetes ($197 billion), cancer 
($187 billion), obesity ($147 billion), and arthritis and 
related conditions ($126 billion)—all reported here in 2016 
dollars.25-29
Many factors will continue to drive costs associated with 
nonoptimized medication therapy, not least of which is the 
aging US population and the concurrent surge in the num-
ber of Medicare enrollees to 81.8 million by 2030.30 In 
addition, the pipeline of new medications has been skewed 
to expensive specialty medications with more than 700 in 
development.31 In 2016, specialty drugs accounted for more 
than one-third of total drug expenditures.2 The United States 
will also be challenged by increases in drug utilization rates 
 Watanabe et al 
833
and drug prices for most major disease categories (eg, 
inflammatory conditions, diabetes, oncology).2 Retail pre-
scription drugs along with home health are the 2 sectors of 
personal health care spending with the highest projected 
average spending growth through 2025.32 Payers will also 
likely grapple with increasing prices of medical resources 
(eg, ED visits, hospitalizations) because the rate of medical 
price growth is expected to accelerate in the 2018 to 2025 
period.33 Considering the projected increase in up-front 
costs resulting from additional medications needed for a 
graying US population and escalation in prescription costs, 
optimizing medication use is unquestionable.
Comprehensive Medication Management
Reducing these utilization and cost trends will require a sys-
tematic approach to medication management to mitigate the 
proportion of patients experiencing TF, NMP, or TF and 
NMP resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy. 
Clinical pharmacists, in collaborative practice with physi-
cians and other prescribers such as nurse practitioners and 
physician assistants, will increasingly be relied on to assume 
responsibility for real-time drug therapy decisions in an 
expanding diversity of care settings by delivering compre-
hensive medication management (CMM) services. This

transition has already begun in health systems such as 
Kaiser-Permanente and the Veterans Health Administration 
where pharmacists provide face-to-face patient care in 
collaborative-practice clinics.33-35 The approach will 
directly resolve costly drug therapy problems while address-
ing a shortage of primary care physicians.36 The importance 
of reducing NMPs has been illuminated by clinician inves-
tigators who have focused on the clinical phenomenon 
referred to as the “prescribing cascade,” in which an adverse 
drug reaction (ADR) is misconstrued as a new syndrome, 
resulting in prescribing of a new medication. The proposed 
approach to arresting the prescribed cascade is a critical 
evaluation of the need for the new potential pharmacologi-
cal agent in context of a comprehensive review of the com-
plete medication profile. This evaluation should include 
explicit consideration of the current medication regimen as 
possibly causal on the symptom being addressed. 
Nonmedication treatment should be considered as well as 
alternative agents with lower risk of ADRs. If medication 
treatment is merited, the lowest effective medication dose 
should be prescribed.37 CMM incorporates consideration of 
the prescribing cascade as well as the principles to prevent 
it from occurring.
CMM would also enrich other specialty areas such as 
behavioral health where medication management is playing 
a growing role.38 Seminal work published in 2003 from the 
Asheville Project demonstrated a reduction in days lost to 
sick time, decreased medical costs, and improved achieve-
ment of treatment goals for patients with chronic disease 
receiving CMM.39 Published evidence of the effectiveness 
of CMM has continued to build along with increasing calls 
for pharmacists in the health care team.40,41 A 2011 report to 
the US Surgeon General summarized evidence available for 
return on investment of medication management programs, 
reaching a maximum of 12:1 and averaging between 3:1 to 
5:1.42 One example of a specific CMM program is the team-
based medication use system in Minnesota that has lowered 
per member per month health care costs and increased the 
percentage of patients achieving treatment goals.43 The ben-
efits of CMM extend to improvements in quality of life, 
access to other health care providers, and continuity of care 
as reported in a recent review of CMM in California.44
CMM focused on achieving optimal clinical and patient-
centered goals of therapy is becoming recognized as a cor-
nerstone of delivery and payment reform efforts.45 Hepler 
and Strand46 proposed eight categories of drug therapy 
problems (untreated indication, improper drug selection, 
subtherapeutic dosage, failure to receive drugs, overdosage, 
ADRs, drug interactions, and drug use without indication). 
The CMM process is directly related to recognition and 
resolution of these drug therapy problems (DTPs) that can 
prevent use of unnecessary medical services (Figure 2). A 
general framework has been developed in prior studies in 
which DTPs give rise to TF and NMPs. Johnson and 
Bootman,4 building from the Hepler and Strand work, pro-
posed a causal path where DTPs give rise to TF and NMPs, 
but did not specify the pathway or the probabilities in this 
process. Rather, the prior published COI estimates for non-
optimized medication use focused on the downstream prob-
ability of TFs and NMPs when medication use was 
indicated.4
Drug therapy problems are drivers of medical resource 
use and are frequently cited as the largest cause of adverse 
events post–hospital discharge, and it has been estimated 
that 13% of adverse drug events after discharge from the 
hospital result in an ED visit or rehospitalization.47,48 
Johnson and Bootman4 categorized this specific scenario as 
the ADR DTP producing an NMP.
Whereas inappropriate consumption of medications is 
one important element of DTPs, the existence of untreated 
indications, subtherapeutic dosing, or drug interactions of 
medications are common scenarios leading to NMPs and 
TFs. A large study of commercial insurance patients 
revealed that the most common issues were related to the 
need for additional medications (34%) and doses that were 
too low (20%).49 Considering underuse of appropriate, 
effective, and safe medications as the omission side of 
DTPs in ambulatory care represents a large opportunity to 
improve outcomes and reduce the COI.50 The majority of

metrics hinge on optimized medication use to achieve 
population level goals of therapy.51
Although CMM represents the most rigorous and struc-
tured clinical process to optimize medication therapy, the 
clinical service referred to as medication therapeutic man-
agement (MTM) also entails review of the medication regi-
men with the goal of optimizing medication regimens. 
However, MTM can be conducted in the absence of the 
physical patient and the patient’s complete medical record 
by simple review of the medication list. Whereas in-person, 
real-time MTM can be pursued, in general, MTM differs 
from CMM based on the absence of a few general features: 
CMM requires an evaluation of the patient’s clinical status 
to ensure evidence-based concordance between the patient’s 
syndromes and medication therapy. CMM involves specifi-
cation of a treatment plan that incorporates follow-up eval-
uation to assess timely progression to prespecified treatment 
goals. CMM is designed to operate under a collaborative 
practice agreement with a physician.52
As described, a systematic categorization scheme for the 
major types of DTPs related to indication, effectiveness, 
safety, and adherence is available and accepted.53 Enhanced 
medication therapy management models are now being 
tested by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
that utilize new Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–
Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes to report on medica-
tion management activities and outcomes.54 Lessons learned 
from these pilot programs will expand documentation 
efforts across the range of CMM models to facilitate out-
comes tracking of pharmacist interventions. The coding 
system will also supply policy makers with objective data to 
supplant the current expert opinion–based estimates of TF, 
NMP, or TF and NMP occurrence. Code use will also fur-
nish valuable data to determine resource utilization esti-
mates after clinical interventions. These measurable 
outcomes will support production of real-world data models 
for future estimates of the cost of nonoptimized drug 
therapy and provide pathway probabilities to model the 
chain from DTPs to TFs and NMPs.
There were limitations to this analysis. Medical resource 
costs used in the models were the most current available. 
However, not all were from the same year because of vary-
ing report dates. All were adjusted to 2016 US dollars. 
Because the most recent available data for number of phy-
sician office visits was from 2014, changes in visit volume 
caused by ACA deployment after 2014 were not fully 
accounted for in the base case model. Hence, this estimate 
is likely conservative. However, our sensitivity analysis 
did include an estimation that factored in an increase in 
visits. Model probabilities were based on expert opinion. 
These were maintained for consistency with prior pub-
lished methods and the absence of replacement probability 
values in the published literature. Because of variations in 
available resource cost estimates, we performed sensitivity 
analyses that varied these inputs and reported total costs 
from each of these scenarios providing a range around the 
base case estimate.
Conclusions
The estimated annual cost of drug-related morbidity and 
mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy 
from a third-party payer perspective was $528.4 billion, 
equivalent to 16% of total US health care expenditures in 
2016. This estimate includes neither direct nonmedical 
costs (eg, transportation or caregiving costs) nor indirect 
costs related to lost productivity. On average, a patient 
experiencing TF, a NMP resulting from nonoptimized drug 
therapy, or a combination of both costs roughly $2500 con-
sidering additional drug therapy and other medical costs 
needed for resolution. To reduce these avoidable medical 
costs, improve patient care, and address the primary care 
provider shortage, we propose expansion of CMM pro-
grams as a cost-effective, scalable policy.
1. 
Identify patients that have not achieved clinical goals of therapy.
2. 
Understand the patient’s personal medication experience/history and preferences/beliefs.
3. 
Identify actual use patterns of all medications including OTCs, bioactive supplements, and prescribed medications.
4. 
Assess each medication (in the following order) for appropriateness, effectiveness, safety (including drug interactions), and adherence, 
focused on achievement of the clinical goals for each therapy.
5. 
Identify all drug therapy problems (the gap between current therapy and that needed to achieve optimal clinical outcomes).
6. 
Develop a care plan addressing recommended steps, including therapeutic changes needed to achieve optimal outcomes.
7. 
Patient agrees with and understands care plan, which is communicated to the prescriber/provider for his/her consent/support.
8. 
Document all steps and current clinical status versus goals of therapy.
9. 
Follow-up evaluations with the patient are critical to determine effects of changes, reassess actual outcomes, and recommend further thera-
peutic changes to achieve desired clinical goals/outcomes.
10. Comprehensive medication management is a reiterative process—care is coordinated with other team members and personalized (patient-
unique) goals of therapy are understood by all team members.
