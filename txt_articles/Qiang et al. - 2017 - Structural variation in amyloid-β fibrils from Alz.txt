Abstract
Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue Aβ peptides 
(Aβ40 and Aβ42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril 
growth conditions.1–12 Recent experiments1,13–16 suggest that variations in Aβ fibril structure in 
vivo may correlate with variations in AD phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are 
associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes.17–19 Here we have investigated 
correlations between structural variation and AD phenotype using solid state nuclear magnetic 
resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from 
extracts of AD brain cortex. We compared two atypical AD clinical subtypes, rapidly progressive 
AD (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD), with typical prolonged duration 
AD (t-AD). Based on ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find 
that a single Aβ40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from t-AD and PCA-AD patients, 
while Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional 
structures. Data for Aβ42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient 
categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a 
specific predominant Aβ40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to

Evidence that Aβ fibril polymorphism may correlate with variations in clinical and 
pathological features of AD includes: (i) Aβ40 fibrils with different molecular structures 
exhibit different levels of toxicity in primary neuronal cell cultures1; (ii) Patterns of amyloid 
deposition in transgenic mice, induced by exogenous amyloid-containing biological 
material, vary with the source of this material13,14; (iii) The size and composition of amyloid 
plaques induced in transgenic mice by synthetic Aβ42 fibrils depend on the morphology and 
growth conditions of these fibrils15; (iv) Size distributions and resistance to chemical 
denaturation of Aβ42 aggregates in brain tissue differ in rapidly progressing and slowly 
progressing AD patients.16 Improved characterization of the structures of neurotoxic Aβ 
assemblies in AD and of correlations between structure and disease phenotype would have a 
major impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, on the development of appropriate 
diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, and on drug development.
Data from ssNMR are particularly sensitive to structural variations, allowing two-
dimensional (2D) 13C-13C and 15N-13C ssNMR spectra to be used as “fingerprints” of 
specific fibril polymorphs.1,4,20,21 Since ssNMR requires milligram-scale quantities of 
isotopically labeled fibrils, we amplified and labeled structures in brain tissue by seeded 
growth, using brain tissue as the source of fibril seeds, as described by Lu et al.4
By analogy with prion diseases, in which different strains produce different durations of 
illness, preferentially target different brain regions, and are associated with conformational 
differences in disease-related prion proteins17–19,22, we selected tissue samples from patients 
from two unusual AD subtypes, namely PCA-AD, which is associated with disruption of 
visual processing23, and r-AD, in which neurodegeneration occurs within months and which 
clinically resembles Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.24 We also included tissue from three 
individuals who died without dementia (ND) but who were found to have Aβ deposition at 
autopsy.
We separately prepared Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils by seeded growth from amyloid-enriched 
cortical extracts. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were acquired for all 
fibril samples. ssNMR measurements were attempted for all samples, although in some 
cases the signal-to-noise ratios were insufficient for acquisition or subsequent analysis of 2D 
spectra. Table 1 summarizes the tissue samples, patient categories, and ssNMR 
measurements. Examples of TEM images and full sets of 2D spectra are given in Extended 
Data Figs. 1–3. Control experiments with cortical extract from a non-AD patient who did not 
have significant Aβ deposition are described in the Supplementary Discussion and Extended 
Data Fig. 4.

 Fig. 1 shows representative data for Aβ40 fibrils. In TEM images (Fig. 1a and Extended 
Data Fig. 1), certain fibrils exhibit modulations of their apparent width with a period of 107 
± 20 nm (mean and standard deviation based on 65 measurements). This fibril morphology 
may be more abundant in images of Aβ40 fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue 
samples. However, quantification of the relative populations of fibril polymorphs from the 
TEM images is not possible because only a small subset of the fibrils can be visualized 
clearly. In contrast, all fibrils contribute to the 2D ssNMR spectra. Most 2D spectra of brain-
seeded Aβ40 fibrils contain the same set of strong crosspeak signals, indicated by 
assignments to the isotopically labeled residues in Figs. 1b and 1c, while spectra of certain 
samples contain additional crosspeak signals with varying intensities.
Fig. 2 shows representative data for Aβ42 fibrils. TEM images do not show a single 
morphology that is clearly predominant within any of the tissue categories (Fig. 2a). 2D 
spectra of most samples do not show a single set of crosspeak signals from the isotopically 
labeled residues (Figs 2b and 2c).
We analyzed the 2D ssNMR spectra with two independent methods, both intended to be 
objective and devoid of assumptions regarding the nature of the fibril structures or structural 
variations. Only 2D spectra with adequate signal-to-noise ratios (see Supplementary 
Methods) were included in these analyses. In the first method, we compared each 2D 
spectrum in a given set (13C-13C or 15N-13C, Aβ40 or Aβ42) with all other 2D spectra in the 
same set. Comparisons were quantified by pairwise root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) 
values between 2D spectra, calculated as described in the Supplementary Methods. For 
2D 13C-13C and 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils, plots in Fig. 3 indicate that RMSDs among 
spectra from t-AD and PCA-AD samples are relatively small (blue shades) in most cases, 
while RMSDs between spectra from r-AD samples and spectra from either t-AD or PCA-
AD samples are relatively large (red shades). Thus, t-AD and PCA-AD spectra are similar to 
one other, but contrast sharply with r-AD spectra, which have larger variability.
Statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1a. Mean RMSDs among t-AD spectra are 
not significantly different from mean RMSDs between t-AD spectra and PCA-AD spectra. 
However, mean RMSDs among t-AD spectra or among PCA-AD spectra are significantly 
smaller than mean RMSDs between t-AD spectra and r-AD spectra or between PCA-AD 
spectra and r-AD spectra (p < 0.001, Welch’s t-test). In addition, for 2D 15N-13C spectra of 
Aβ40 fibrils, the mean RMSD value among PCA-AD spectra is significantly smaller than 
the mean RMSD value among t-AD spectra, the mean RMSD value among PCA-AD spectra 
is significantly smaller than the mean RMSD value among r-AD spectra, and the mean 
RMSD value among tAD spectra is significantly smaller than the mean RMSD value among 
r-AD spectra (p < 0.001).
For 2D spectra of Aβ42 fibrils, plots in Fig. 3 do not show clear patterns, and no statistically 
significant differences among mean RMSDs are identified.
In the second method of analysis, we used singular value decomposition to determine 
principal component spectra25 for each set of 2D spectra (see Supplementary Methods). For 
each set, the number N of principal component spectra equals the number of experimental

 2D spectra. The experimental spectra within each set, including both crosspeak signals and 
random noise, can be represented exactly as linear combinations of the principal component 
spectra (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), with coefficients Ck (k = 1, 2,…, N). As shown in 
Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 1b, mean values of C2 for 13C-13C and 15N-13C spectra of 
Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue are significantly larger than the corresponding mean 
values of C2 for both t-AD spectra and PCA-AD spectra (p < 0.01). This indicates that 2D 
spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue differ more strongly from the average 2D 
spectra than do spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue. For Aβ42 
fibrils, differences in mean values of Ck are not significant.
An alternative analysis of the 2D 15N-13C spectra, in which the spectra were fit with a fixed 
number of crosspeaks at fixed chemical shift positions, is described in the Supplementary 
Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7. According to this analysis, on average, the predominant 
Aβ40 fibril structure typically accounts for approximately 80% of the crosspeak signal 
volume in 2D 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue, and 
approximately 65% in 2D 15N-13C spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue. 15N 
and 13C chemical shifts in our spectra of brain-seeded fibrils are compared with previously 
reported chemical shifts for Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils1,2,4,6,7,26–28 in the Supplementary 
Discussion and Extended Data Fig. 8.
We draw the following main conclusions from these ssNMR experiments: (i) Although 
brain-seeded Aβ40 fibrils can be polymorphic, a single structure is most abundant in cortical 
tissue of most t-AD patients and most PCA-AD patients; (ii) Polymorphism of Aβ40 fibrils 
is more pronounced in r-AD samples than in t-AD and PCA-AD samples; (iii) Brain-seeded 
Aβ42 fibrils are generally more structurally heterogeneous than brain-seeded Aβ40 fibrils, 
without a clearly predominant structure even in t-AD and PCA-AD samples. Although the 
small number of samples prevents us from drawing definite conclusions regarding fibril 
structures in ND brain tissue, we have not observed ssNMR signals that are unique to ND-
derived fibrils.
2D ssNMR spectra of the predominant Aβ40 fibril structure, along with the fibril 
morphology in Fig. 1a, match data reported previously by Lu et al. for Aβ40 fibrils from one 
of their two AD patients.4 This patient, called “patient 2”, was a t-AD case. In contrast, 
Aβ40 fibrils from their “patient 1” exhibited distinctive ssNMR signals that are not present 
in any of the measurements described above (Extended Data Fig. 8). The clinical history of 
patient 1 was also different, including an initial diagnosis of Lewy body dementia rather than 
AD. Thus, it remains possible that the Aβ40 fibril structure of patient 1, for which a full 
molecular model was developed4, is associated with a specific AD variant.
The indistinguishability of Aβ fibrils from t-AD and PCA-AD tissue suggests that 
phenotypic differences between these two categories arise from factors other than fibril 
structure, perhaps including genetic factors or differences in nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies. The 
greater polymorphism of Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD tissue indicated by 2D ssNMR spectra has 
at least two possible interpretations: (i) A fibril structure that is prevalent in r-AD tissue has 
enhanced neurotoxicity, through either direct or indirect mechanisms; (ii) In r-AD samples, 
fibrils reside in the tissue for a shorter period than in t-AD and PCA-AD samples, possibly

 allowing fibrils with a greater range of thermodynamic stabilities or resistance to 
degradation to be present at autopsy.
The greater overall heterogeneity of Aβ42 fibrils seeded with t-AD and PCA-AD extract, 
compared with the corresponding Aβ40 fibrils, is conceivably a consequence of imperfect 
amplification of Aβ42 fibril structures from brain tissue under our experimental conditions, 
possibly due to a stronger tendency of the more hydrophobic Aβ42 peptide to spontaneously 
form nonfibrillar aggregates or due to the lower abundance of Aβ42 fibrils in most of our 
tissue samples (Extended Data Table 2). However, 2D ssNMR spectra of a control sample, in 
which Aβ42 fibrils were grown in the presence of extract from occipital tissue that lacked 
detectable fibril seeds, show surprisingly sharp crosspeak signals that indicate roughly 70% 
population of a single structure (Supplementary Discussion and Extended Data Fig. 4). 
Thus, the greater structural heterogeneity of AD brain-seeded Aβ42 fibrils in our 
experiments most likely indicates greater heterogeneity of the fibril seeds within the cortical 
tissue. Recent experiments by Cohen et al. indicate differences in structural heterogeneity 
and sizes of Aβ42 aggregates, but not Aβ40 aggregates, in r-AD and t-AD brain tissue.16
In conclusion, experiments described above represent the first use of ssNMR to screen 
multiple tissue samples for variations in amyloid fibril structure. Similar approaches can be 
applied in other amyloid diseases, where related phenomena exist.20,29,30 Obvious goals for 
future work are to develop a full structural model for the predominant Aβ40 polymorph 
identified above and to determine whether structurally distinct Aβ40 polymorphs can 
consistently seed different patterns of Aβ pathology in suitable animal models.

Extended Data Figure 1. Additional TEM images of brain-seeded fibrils
(a) TEM grids were prepared 4 h after addition of solubilized Aβ40 or Aβ42 to sonicated 
brain extract and were negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Collagen fibrils in the extract 
(40–100 nm width, with characteristic transverse bands) appear in some images. Material 
with an amorphous appearance is nonfibrillar, non-Aβ components of the brain extract. 
Yellow arrows indicate Aβ40 fibrils with an apparent width modulation, attributable to an 
approximately periodic twisting of the fibril structure about the fibril growth direction. TEM 
images of all 37 brain-seeded Aβ40 and all 33 Aβ42 fibril samples are available on-line at

a, Images of negatively-stained fibrils derived from t-AD3f, PCA1o, and r-AD1f tissue, 
recorded 4 h after initiation of seeded fibril growth (out of 37 fibril samples). Single-headed 
arrows indicate the periodic modulation of apparent fibril width in a common Aβ40 fibril 
morphology. Double-headed arrows indicate an additional morphology. b, Aliphatic regions 
of 2D 13C-13C spectra of the same samples (color coded), with assignments of crosspeak 
signals to isotopically labeled residues shown in the 2D spectrum of t-AD3f fibrils. Aβ40 
was uniformly 15N,13C-labeled at F19, V24, G25, S26, A30, I31, L34, and M35. Contour 
levels increase by successive factors of 1.5. 1D slices at 21.0 ppm and 53.5 ppm are shown 
on the right, with double-headed arrows indicating signals that arise from the less common 
fibril structures. c, 2D 15N-13C spectra of the same samples, with assignments of the 
predominant crosspeak signals shown in the 2D spectrum of t-AD3f fibrils and assignments 
of additional signals shown in the 2D spectrum of r-AD1f fibrils. Contour levels increase by 
successive factors of 1.3. 1D slices at 112.7 ppm and 121.0 ppm are shown on the right, with 
double-headed arrows indicating signals that arise from the less common fibril structures.

a, Images of negatively-stained fibrils derived from t-AD3p, PCA1f, and r-AD2p tissue (out 
of 33 fibril samples). b, 2D 13C-13C spectra of the same samples (color coded), with 
assignments of crosspeak signals to isotopically labeled residues shown in the 2D spectrum

 Figure 3. Pairwise differences among 2D ssNMR spectra of brain-seeded Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils
RMSD values are displayed on the color scales shown to the right of each plot, with blue 
shades indicating relatively similar spectra and red shades indicating relatively dissimilar 
spectra. RMSD plots for Aβ40 fibrils indicate that fibrils derived from t-AD and PCA-AD 
tissue have similar 2D spectra in most cases, while greater differences are observed in 
spectra of Aβ40 fibrils derived from r-AD tissue. For Aβ42 fibrils, correlations between 
RMSD values and tissue categories are not observed. Statistical analyses are summarized in 
Extended Data Table 1a. Shades above white represent significant differences between 2D 
spectra.

 Figure 4. Principal component analyses of 2D ssNMR spectra of brain-seeded Aβ40 and Aβ42 
fibrils
For each set of 2D spectra, the coefficients of the first five principal components (C1 through 
C5) are plotted in groups corresponding to fibrils derived from different tissue categories. 
Horizontal bars indicate mean values. The mean value of C2 for Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD 
tissue (n = 8 for 2D 13C-13C, n = 10 for 2D 15N-13C) is significantly different from the mean 
value of C2 for Aβ40 fibrils from t-AD (n = 13 for 2D 13C-13C, n =12 for 2D 15N-13C) or 
PCA-AD (n = 9 for 2D 13C-13C, n = 6 for 2D 15N-13C) tissue. Statistical analyses are 
summarized in Extended Data Table 1b.
