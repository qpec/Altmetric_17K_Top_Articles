ndometriosis is a chronic and estrogen-dependent gyne-
cologic disorder that affects ≈10% of women of reproduc-
tive age in the United States.1 It is defined as the presence of 
endometrium-like tissue thriving outside the uterus, primarily 
on the pelvic peritoneum and ovaries.2 Signs and symptoms 
include chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and 
reduced fertility.3
Endometriosis has been linked to systemic chronic 
inflammation, heightened oxidative stress, and an athero-
genic lipid profile. Various inflammatory factors, eg, inter-
leukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, have been 
observed to be elevated both in the peritoneal fluid4–6 and in 
the peripheral blood4,5,7 of women with endometriosis com-
pared with controls. Studies also have suggested an increase 
of markers of oxidative stress but a decrease of anti-
oxidants in the peritoneal fluid8,9 and peripheral blood10,11 
among women with endometriosis. Moreover, women with 
endometriosis have been suggested to have higher serum 
levels of low-density lipoprotien10–12 but lower high-density 
lipoprotein.10,11
Inflammation, oxidative stress, and an atherogenic lipid pro-
file play key roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic CHD.13–15 
 
Chronic systemic inflammation contributes to vascular insult 
and atheromatous plaque progression.16 Increasing evidence 
supports that reactive oxygen species contributes to the process 
of atherogenesis, as important mediators of signaling pathways 
that lead to vascular inflammation.15 Elevated concentration of 
low-density lipoprotein enhances its retention under the arterial 
wall17; retention and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein are 
fundamental events in atherogenesis.18 In contrast, high-density 
lipoprotein is antiatherogenic, removing cholesterol from cells 
in the arterial intima.19 Therefore, the presence of endome-
triosis may promote coronary artery atherosclerosis formation 
and progression, increasing the risk of CHD.
Background―Endometriosis is a prevalent gynecologic disease associated with systemic chronic inflammation, heightened 
oxidative stress, and atherogenic lipid profile that may increase women’s risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).
Methods and Results―We examined the prospective association between laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and 
subsequent CHD among 116 430 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II (1989–2009). Participants with a history of heart 
disease and stroke were excluded. When compared with women without endometriosis, women with laparoscopically 
confirmed endometriosis had a higher risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–
1.98), angiographically confirmed angina (1.91; 1.59–2.29), coronary artery bypass graft surgery/coronary angioplasty 
procedure/stent (1.35; 1.08–1.69), or any of these CHD end points combined (1.62; 1.39–1.89), independent of potential 
demographic, anthropometric, family history, reproductive, and lifestyle confounders. Relative risk for the combined 
CHD end point was highest among women aged ≤40 years (3.08; 2.02–4.70) and decreased as age increased (40< age 
≤50 years, 1.65; 1.35–2.02; 50< age ≤55 years, 1.44; 1.07–1.94; and age >55 years, 0.98; 0.56–1.72; P value, test for 
heterogeneity=0.001). Having had a hysterectomy/oophorectomy was associated with higher risk of combined CHD 
compared with not having had a hysterectomy/oophorectomy (1.51; 1.34–1.71). A percentage of 42 of the association 
between endometriosis and CHD could be explained by greater frequency of hysterectomy/oophorectomy and earlier age 
at surgery after endometriosis diagnosis. 
Conclusions―In this large, prospective cohort, laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis was associated with increased 
risk of CHD. The association was strongest among young women. Hysterectomy/oophorectomy was associated with 
higher risk of CHD and could partially explain the association between endometriosis and CHD.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual

In addition, the treatments of endometriosis, such as 
hysterectomy or oophorectomy20–24 and analgesics,25 may 
confer increased risk of CHD to women with endometrio-
sis. Hysterectomy or oophorectomy is a surgical treatment 
for endometriosis, thus women with endometriosis are much 
more likely to undergo hysterectomy or oophorectomy and 
also receive the surgery at a much younger age than the gen-
eral population. The surgically induced menopause before a 
natural menopause may increase risk of CHD among women, 
and this elevated risk may be most evident at a younger age 
(ie, before all women reach natural menopause).20–24
In sum, women with endometriosis may have higher risk 
of CHD than women without endometriosis,26 and this asso-
ciation may differ by age group. To test these hypotheses, 
we examined the prospective associations between endome-
triosis and myocardial infarction, angiographically confirmed 
angina, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery/coronary 
angioplasty procedure/stent within the Nurses’ Health Study 
II, a large prospective cohort study.
Methods
Study Population
Nurses’ Health Study II is a prospective cohort study with 116 430 
registered female nurses who were 25 to 42 and resided in 14 of the 
United States at enrollment in 1989. At baseline, participants com-
pleted a detailed questionnaire on demographic, medical, lifestyle, 
reproductive, and other information and have continued to do so bien-
nially. This research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of 
Public Health, Boston, MA.
Assessment of Endometriosis
In 1993, women were first asked whether they had ever had physi-
cian-diagnosed endometriosis. If yes, they were asked during which 
2-year follow-up period the diagnosis had occurred and whether it 
had been confirmed by laparoscopy—the gold standard for diagnos-
ing endometriosis.27,28 They were asked again in each subsequent bi-
ennial questionnaire.
As previously detailed,1 the surgical report validation for self-
reported laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis cases within this 
cohort is 96% (n=101/105). Among women without laparoscopic 
confirmation, evidence of clinical diagnosis or symptoms was found 
in only 54% (n=14/26) of the records. Thus, self-reported physician-
diagnosed endometriosis without laparoscopic confirmation may be 
substantially misclassified, and therefore, endometriosis exposure 
was restricted to women who reported laparoscopic confirmation. 
Those who reported endometriosis diagnosis but never laparoscopic 
confirmation were censored at the report of clinical diagnosis. In ad-
dition, this validation study determined that the average diagnostic 
delay (from symptom onset to surgical diagnosis) was 4 years in this 
cohort, whereas a study in 10 countries observed an average delay of 
6.7 years.29 A shorter diagnostic delay within Nurses’ Health Study II 
compared with the general population may be attributed to the medi-
cal knowledge and greater access to care of this cohort of registered 
nurses.
Assessment of CHD
We assessed incident myocardial infarction cases (fatal and nonfatal), 
angiographically confirmed angina, and coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery/angioplasty/stent cases that occurred between enrollment and 
the 2007 questionnaire cycle (which ended in May 2009). Clinicians 
blinded to the questionnaire information reviewed medical records 
from self-reported nonfatal myocardial infarction events. Nonfatal 
myocardial infarctions were classed as confirmed if they met the 
criteria of the World Health Organization: symptoms and either di-
agnostic electrocardiographic changes or raised cardiac enzymes,30 
as probable if hospital records were not obtained but they were cor-
roborated in writing or a telephone interview. Fatal myocardial in-
farction was confirmed by hospital records, the National Death Index, 
or autopsy. Physician-diagnosed angina confirmed by angiography, 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery/angioplasty/stent, and time of 
diagnosis were self-reported. When myocardial infarction, angiog-
raphy-confirmed angina, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery/
angioplasty/stent cases were combined as the outcome (the combined 
CHD), we used the time of the first CHD event among those 3 to 
define the first age of occurrence.
Statistical Analysis
Those who experienced myocardial infarction, stroke, angiographi-
cally confirmed angina, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery/
angioplasty/stent before enrollment into Nurses’ Health Study II in 
1989 were excluded from this study. Person-months at risk were cal-
culated from age at enrollment to age at death, CHD incidence, and 
end of follow-up for the present aims, whichever occurred first.
Association Between Endometriosis and CHD
First, as the main analysis, we quantified the association between 
endometriosis and CHD using multivariable Cox proportional haz-
ards models. To evaluate potential confounding, we adjusted for age 
at the beginning of each questionnaire cycle and calendar time and 
then additionally adjusted for demographic, anthropometric, family 
history, reproductive, and lifestyle potential confounders including 
known risk factors for CHD to calculate crude and adjusted rela-
tive risks and 95% confidence intervals. All time-varying covariates 
were updated prospectively. Given that most questions were asked in 
every questionnaire across the ≈20 years of follow-up, we observed 
little missing data. For example, there were <1% missing data for 
age at menarche (asked at baseline) and smoking history (asked in 
each questionnaire) among 2 019 360 person-years. The highest per-
centage of missing values observed was for birth weight (5%), body 
mass index (5%), and postmenopausal hormone use (6%). Missing 
covariate values were handled by the missing indicator method.31 
Multiple imputation to handle the missing data was also performed 
as a sensitivity analysis. Standard multivariable Cox models may be 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Endometriosis has been associated with systemic 
chronic inflammation, heightened oxidative stress, 
and atherogenic lipid profile that may increase wom-
en’s risk for coronary heart disease.
• However, to our knowledge, no previous studies 
have explored the association between endometriosis 
and risk of coronary heart disease.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• This is the first study investigating the association 
between endometriosis and risk of coronary heart 
disease, and our data show that endometriosis is 
associated with higher risk of coronary heart disease 
independent of known and hypothesized confound-
ers and coronary heart disease risk factors, especially 
among younger women.
• Moreover, we observed that a portion of this asso-
ciation could be explained by treatment factors asso-
ciated with endometriosis diagnosis, particularly 
hysterectomy/oophorectomy.

biased when there exist time-dependent confounders that are also af-
fected by previous exposure.32 For example, diet and physical activity 
change over time and can be influenced by previous endometriosis 
diagnosis. Therefore, we also applied marginal structural models with 
inverse probability weighting to adjust for potential time-dependent 
confounding.
Age as a Modifier on the Association Between 
Endometriosis and CHD
Second, we examined whether and how age modifies the association 
between endometriosis and CHD. To do so, we stratified the asso-
ciation between endometriosis and combined CHD by age groups 
(<40, 40–50, 50–55, ≥55 years) and tested the statistical significance 
of the interaction between age and endometriosis with likelihood ra-
tio tests.33 We plotted the absolute incidence rate of combined CHD 
against age for women with and without laparoscopically confirmed 
endometriosis, calculated by multivariable adjusted pooled logistic 
regression. This incidence rate was calculated at the mean or mode 
of all covariates.
Relationship Between Endometriosis, 
Hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and Combined CHD
Third, we investigated the relationship between endometriosis, hys-
terectomy/oophorectomy, and combined CHD. As the first step, we 
assessed the association between hysterectomy/oophorectomy and 
combined CHD. In addition to the covariates adjusted in the main 
analysis, to further account for risk factors of hysterectomy, we 
added adjustment for household income, husband’s education, and 
geographic region of residence. We also further adjusted for potential 
indication for hysterectomy including infertility history and analge-
sics use (in addition to oral contraceptive) as indicators of endome-
triosis clinical severity.
As the second step, we calculated whether proportions of the 
association between endometriosis and combined CHD could be 
statistically accounted for by the surgical treatments hysterectomy/
oophorectomy. To do so, we added adjustment for hysterectomy/
oophorectomy to the base multivariate model (ie, now a surgery-ad-
justed model). Then, we calculated the proportion of the association 
between endometriosis and combined CHD that was statistically ac-
counted for by hysterectomy/oophorectomy by dividing the log rela-
tive risk for combined CHD in relation to endometriosis estimated 
from the surgery-adjusted model by the log relative risk for combined 
CHD in relation to endometriosis from the base model. Confidence 
intervals for these estimated proportions account are calculated as 
per Lin et al.34 We repeated this method to calculate the proportions 
of association between endometriosis and combined CHD that were 
statistically accounted for by postmenopausal hormone use (estrogen, 
progesterone/progestin, or estrogen and progesterone/progestin com-
bined) and duration of use, and analgesic use.
Results
Association Between Endometriosis and CHD
At baseline in 1989, 116 430 women were enrolled in this 
cohort. The response rate across the 20 years since enroll-
ment has been consistently over 90% for each questionnaire 
cycle and did not vary by endometriosis status. During the 
20-year follow-up among 1 971 574 person-years, there were 
1438 incident combined CHD cases. At baseline (1989), 
women who had laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis 
history (n=5296) were slightly older, had earlier age at men-
arche, were more likely to be nulliparous, had lower parity, 
were more likely to use oral contraceptives, and more likely 
to have a family history of myocardial infarction aged <60 
years old compared with women who had not been diag-
nosed with endometriosis at baseline (Table 1). Women with 
endometriosis were also much more likely to have had a hys-
terectomy and/or oophorectomy and to have had these at an 
earlier age, be surgically postmenopausal, and use postmeno-
pausal hormones and analgesics.
In age- and calendar year–adjusted analyses, the relative 
risks—comparing women with laparoscopically confirmed 
endometriosis (n=11 903 by end of follow-up) to women 
without—were 1.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.27–2.11) for 
myocardial infarction, 2.07 (1.73–2.47) for angiographically 
confirmed angina, 1.49 (1.19–1.86) for coronary artery bypass 
graft surgery/angioplasty/stent, and 1.73 (1.49–2.00) for com-
bined CHD (Table 2). Results remained statistically signifi-
cant after adjustment for potential confounders (myocardial 
infarction, 1.52, 1.17–1.98; angina, 1.91, 1.59–2.29; coronary 
artery bypass graft surgery/angioplasty/stent, 1.35, 1.08–1.69; 
combined CHD, 1.62, 1.39–1.89; Table 2). Results were 
unchanged when using marginal structural models. Results 
were also unchanged when multiple imputation was applied 
instead of the missing indicator method to address missing 
data in any covariate. The significant association between 
endometriosis and combined CHD remained after adjustment 
for each treatment factor.
Age as a Modifier on the Association Between 
Endometriosis and CHD
We observed a statistically significant interaction between 
endometriosis and age for the combined CHD end point. The 
relative risk was highest among women age ≤40 years (3.08; 
2.02–4.70) and decreased as age increased (40<age≤50 years, 
1.65; 1.35–2.02; 50<age≤55 years, 1.44, 1.07–1.94; age 
>55, 0.98; 0.56–1.72; P test for heterogeneity=0.001). The 
Figure demonstrates that women with endometriosis had a 
higher absolute incidence rate of combined CHD than women 
without endometriosis across ages before late the 50s; the 2 
absolute incidence rates crossed at ages in the late 50s—after 
which the 2 groups had similar incidence rates (Figure). The 
incidence rate difference between women with endometriosis 
and women without endometriosis increased slowly as age 
increased until around the age 50 years.
Relationship Between Endometriosis, 
Hysterectomy/Oophorectomy, and Combined CHD
We observed that women who had a hysterectomy/oophorec-
tomy had higher age-standardized incidence rates of CHD. 
Having had a hysterectomy/oophorectomy was associated 
with higher age-standardized absolute incidence rates of CHD 
than those who had not: 139 versus 60 per 100 000 person-
years; having had a hysterectomy/oophorectomy was associ-
ated with higher risk of combined CHD compared with not 
having had a hysterectomy/oophorectomy (1.51; 1.34–1.71). 
Adjustment for potential risk factors and indication for hyster-
ectomy/oophorectomy did not attenuate this association.
We observed that 42% of the association between endo-
metriosis and CHD was statistically significantly accounted 
for by greater frequency of hysterectomy/oophorectomy 
and earlier age at these surgeries among women with endo-
metriosis (Table 3). Although 31% of the association could 
be statistically accounted for by greater frequency and 
longer duration of postmenopausal hormone use, this was

primarily driven by greater frequency and earlier age at 
hysterectomy/oophorectomy.
Discussion
When compared with women without endometriosis, lapa-
roscopically confirmed endometriosis was associated with a 
significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction, angio-
graphically confirmed angina, and coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery/angioplasty/stent. Adjustment for potential confound-
ers did not attenuate this association. Hysterectomy/oophorec-
tomy was associated with a higher risk of CHD and explained 
a portion of the association between endometriosis and CHD.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study 
investigating the association between endometriosis and CHD. 
One case–control study found null results when investigating 
whether women with endometriosis (n=66) had greater subclin-
ical atherosclerosis than controls (n=66), measured by intima-
media thickness on the common carotid artery.36 As noted by 
the author, the mean age of the study population was only 41 
years. Given the small sample size, the study had insufficient 
statistical power to detect increased atherosclerosis at such early 
age. Also, the control group was defined as women with uterine 
myomas, ovarian cysts, or pelvic pain, who may have greater 
risk of subclinical atherosclerosis than the general population. 
Another case–control study also investigated the association 
between carotid intima-media thickness and endometriosis and 
found null results.37 However, this study similarly had a young 
age group (mean age, 33 years in cases and 35 years in controls) 
and very small sample size (37 cases and 31 controls).
Systemic chronic inflammation, heightened oxidative 
stress, and atherogenic lipid profile associated with endo-
metriosis and the synergistic effect of the 3 may under-
pin the biological mechanism for the association between 
endometriosis and CHD. In addition, endometriosis and 
CHD may share common genetic susceptibilities. Multiple 
independent loci in the CDKN2B-AS1 (also known as 
antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL)) 
region on chromosome 9p21 have been robustly associated 
with endometriosis in genome-wide association studies in 
Japanese and European ancestry populations38,39 and has also

encodes the long noncoding RNA ANRIL, which has been 
demonstrated to regulate cell proliferation, adhesion, and 
apoptosis,43,44—central mechanisms of atherogenesis13,43 and 
endometriosis.2,3
Apart from these biological mechanisms, it is possible 
that the crude association between endometriosis and CHD 
can be explained by CHD risk factors that predate and cause 
endometriosis (eg, diet). However, the small attenuation of 
relative risk from the crude models to the comprehensive 
multivariable models suggests that strong confounding is 
unlikely. Moreover, because the results of multivariable Cox 
models and marginal structural models were almost identical, 
the potential bias that may remain within multivariable Cox 
models for adjustment of time-varying confounding32 was 
negligible.
We observed that the increased risk of CHD in women 
with endometriosis was greatest among younger women, and 
there was no increased risk from endometriosis after women 
reached the late 50s. This association may have important 
clinical and public health implications among women in their 
early 40s to early 50s. It is possible that the observed increased 
risk associated with surgical menopause from hysterectomy/
oophorectomy among women with endometriosis started to 
diminish with age partially because nearly every woman had 
reached menopause by the age of 55 years.

 262  Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes  May 2016
We observed higher risk of CHD among women who had 
a hysterectomy/oophorectomy than women who did not have 
a hysterectomy/oophorectomy. These associations were not 
altered when potential confounding factors, eg, age, parity, body 
mass index, and race/ethnicity,45–47 were adjusted for in the mul-
tivariable analyses. Another important determinant of the deci-
sions on hysterectomy/oophorectomy is education,45,47 which 
is homogenous in this population of nurses, and so we addi-
tionally adjusted for husband’s education level and household 
income, again with no evidence of confounding. Confounding 
by indication of this hysterectomy association could be because 
of severity of endometriosis disease. Therefore, we further 
adjusted for infertility history and analgesics use (in addition 
to oral contraceptive use) as proxies of endometriosis disease 
severity as the main presentations of endometriosis are infer-
tility and pain.1,3 Adjustment did not change the association 
between hysterectomy/oophorectomy and CHD. These results 
were supported by the literature: bilateral oophorectomy at ages 
younger than 50 years has been associated with an increased 
incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases although 
results have been inconclusive for bilateral oophorectomy at 
ages >50 years.20–22 A nationwide study from Sweden showed 
that hysterectomy without oophorectomy was associated with 
an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in women aged <50 
years but not in women aged ≥50 years.23,24 Loss of ovarian 
function and subsequent deficiency of endogenous estrogens 
may be the biological mechanism for association between 
bilateral oophorectomy and cardiovascular diseases, whereas 
simple hysterectomy can interfere with ovarian blood flow 
and may result in premature ovarian failure.23
We observed that ≈40% of the observed significant asso-
ciation between endometriosis and CHD may be statistically 
accounted for by hysterectomy/oophorectomy and age at 
surgery. This may be because (1) women with endometrio-
sis were subsequently much more likely to have a hysterec-
tomy/oophorectomy and had the surgery at a younger age than 
women without endometriosis; and (2) hysterectomy/oopho-
rectomy is associated with higher risk of CHD. The mediation 
proportion estimated from this model can be interpreted as 
the mediation proportion to be observed in this study popula-
tion or any other study population with a similar proportion of 
treatment and a similar age distribution. The remaining ≈50% 
of the significant association between endometriosis and CHD 
was not explained by endometriosis treatments.
These data raise concerns on treating endometriosis with 
hysterectomy/oophorectomy. Physicians need to consider the 
potential long-term impact that the surgeries may cause and 
weigh the risks and benefits of the treatment in dialogue with 
patients, particularly with respect to endometriosis where pain 
recurrence risk remains.48 Although oophorectomy confers 
obvious prevention for ovarian cancer, with which endome-
triosis has been associated,49 CHD is the leading cause of mor-
tality and morbidity in women in the United States and United 
Kingdom. CHD incidence and mortality are orders of mag-
nitude greater than ovarian cancer, with incidence 30 times 
greater and mortality 26 times greater in the United States in 
2010.50 However, we acknowledge that endometriosis man-
agement decisions are not random, and there are many indi-
vidual issues that contribute to treatment decisions between a 
physician and patient.
Strengths and Limitations
About limitations, our unexposed group (ie, never clinically or 
surgically diagnosed with endometriosis) may include asymp-
tomatic endometriosis or symptomatic without confirmatory 
diagnosis. If so, our results would be biased toward the null. 
However, in sensitivity analyses, expanded definition of endo-
metriosis cases by attributing person time from endometriosis 
without laparoscopic confirmation to the exposed group did 
not alter the results. More importantly, as Zondervan et al51 
quantified, the likely prevalence of undiagnosed endometriosis 
should not exceed 2% of the unexposed population, and there-
fore too low to affect the results, particularly in our large study 
population among whom undiagnosed endometriosis become 
diluted among tens of thousands of those with no endometrio-
sis. We did not have information on other hormonal treatments 
for endometriosis, such as danazol (a synthetic androgen) and 
leuprolide (lupron, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog) 
to assess to what extent the association between endometrio-
sis and CHD could have been explained by those treatments. 
We also did not have information on the extent of excision of 
endometriosis lesions during laparoscopy to evaluate whether 
the excision could alter the elevated CHD risk associated with 
endometriosis although no current cohort of sufficient size has 
these data. About generalizability, these medical professionals 
have greater knowledge of and access to medical care, mini-
mizing misclassification of the primary exposure (endometri-
osis) or the outcomes and thus maximizing precision of hazard 
ratio estimation; it is unlikely that the underlying biological 
relation observed between endometriosis and CHD, if true, 
would differ between these women and women in the general

represents the average effect of endometriosis given the distribution of age and 
treatment in the Nurses’ Health Study. The mediation proportion estimated from 
the model presented here can be interpreted as the mediation proportion to be 
observed in this study population or any other study population with a similar 
proportion of treatment and a similar age distribution.

population. Finally, the timing of exposure was defined by the 
time of surgical diagnosis, not by disease onset. However, this 
is true for all studies of endometriosis regardless of design; 
furthermore, sensitivity analyses predating diagnosis time of 
endometriosis for 2, 4, 6, or 8 years did not change our results.
Our study has many strengths. The longitudinal study 
design, large sample size, and 20 years of follow-up allowed 
us to document the prospective association between surgically 
diagnosed endometriosis and subsequent risk of CHD. The 
wealth of time-varying data allowed for detailed adjustment 
for known and suspected potential confounders and risk fac-
tors for CHD. Minimal confounding was seen. We were able 
to assess proportions of the association statistically accounted 
for by various treatment factors. Finally, the results were 
robust across multiple definitions of CHD.
Conclusions
In this large prospective cohort, laparoscopically confirmed 
endometriosis was associated with higher risk of CHD. The 
association was stronger among young women. Hysterec-
tomy/oophorectomy was associated with higher risk of CHD 
and could explain a portion of the association between endo-
metriosis and CHD. These data have implications for clini-
cal management of endometriosis patients, suggesting that 
women with endometriosis may represent a high-risk group 
for CHD—particularly at a young age, indicating the need for 
risk awareness and subsequent screening for CHD and healthy 
lifestyle promotion among primary care and public health 
specialists.
